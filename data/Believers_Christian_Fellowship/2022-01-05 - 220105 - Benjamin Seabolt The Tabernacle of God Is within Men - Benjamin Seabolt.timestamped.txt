[4:46] let's just bow our heads together
[4:49] precious lord jesus we just want to
[4:52] pause here and approach you by way of
[4:54] prayer once more father
[4:56] as we would come to this juncture of the
[4:58] service lord where we
[5:00] step from what mortals can do to what no
[5:03] mortal can do lord
[5:05] for we have to have you now lord we can
[5:08] come and we can sing your praises
[5:10] we could get in our cars by your grace
[5:13] and drive here physically lord but now
[5:16] we come to a point to where there's
[5:17] nothing we can do lord and if you don't
[5:19] come we would have gathered in vain so
[5:22] we would just ask now is that we would
[5:24] yield ourselves to you both hearer and
[5:26] speaker that you would come and have the
[5:29] preeminent sword and that you would do
[5:31] what only you can do we ask this in the
[5:33] name of the lord jesus christ and the
[5:35] bride says
[5:37] amen god bless you so good to be with
[5:40] you this evening
[5:41] if you have your bibles we'll go to the
[5:43] book of revelation chapter 21.
[5:48] revelation chapter 21.
[5:53] and i want to
[5:55] look at a topic
[5:57] tonight
[5:59] by way of a title
[6:01] of the tabernacle of god is with men i'm
[6:05] just a little loud up here if you can
[6:08] turn that down just a little bit thank
[6:09] you so much
[6:11] the tabernacle of god is with men
[6:16] we'll begin reading
[6:18] chapter 21 and verse 1.
[6:23] and he says i saw a new heaven and a new
[6:26] earth
[6:27] for the first heaven and the first earth
[6:29] were passed away and there were no more
[6:31] sea was no more sea
[6:33] and i john saw the holy city new
[6:35] jerusalem coming down from god out of
[6:38] heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[6:40] her husband
[6:41] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[6:43] saying behold
[6:45] the tabernacle of god is with men
[6:49] and he shall dwell with them and they
[6:50] shall be his people and god himself
[6:52] shall be with them
[6:54] and be their god
[6:56] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[6:58] their eyes and there shall be no more
[7:00] death neither sorrow nor crying
[7:03] neither shall there be any more pain
[7:06] for the former things are passed away
[7:08] and he that set up on the throne said
[7:10] behold i make all things new
[7:13] and he said unto me right for these
[7:16] words are true and faithful
[7:18] and he said unto me
[7:20] it is done
[7:22] now let's turn all the way back to the
[7:24] beginning of the bible
[7:26] genesis 1.
[7:33] genesis 1
[7:36] and verse 31.
[7:46] genesis 1 31 and god saw
[7:49] everything that he had made
[7:51] and behold it was very good and the
[7:54] evening and the morning were the sixth
[7:56] day
[7:57] thus the heavens and the earth were
[7:59] finished and all the hosts of them
[8:02] and on the seventh day god ended his
[8:05] work which he had made and he rested on
[8:08] the seventh day
[8:09] from all his work which he had made god
[8:12] bless you as you would have your seats
[8:15] and i've purposely
[8:18] read from revelation
[8:20] and genesis
[8:22] that way i would terrify you into
[8:24] thinking i was going to preach the
[8:25] entire bible tonight
[8:27] and you'll be grateful when i just go a
[8:28] couple hours
[8:32] not really i'm going to do my best to
[8:34] behave
[8:36] but i want to look at this the
[8:37] tabernacle of god is with men
[8:41] and if we look at the word tabernacle
[8:45] a tabernacle is an establishment of god
[8:50] and
[8:52] a tabernacle is not just a foundation
[8:57] a tabernacle has walls
[8:59] tabernacle has a roof and the tabernacle
[9:02] has stuff inside of it
[9:04] so a foundation is good a foundation is
[9:07] excellent we have to have a foundation
[9:10] we have to have a foundation
[9:12] in so much that i think the lord
[9:14] ordained that i couldn't preach this the
[9:16] wednesday a couple back that i was
[9:17] supposed to until our pastor came and
[9:20] preached the message on a solid
[9:21] foundation
[9:23] maybe i'm just fanatical it's possible
[9:24] but we just watch those things
[9:28] but we he came and he preached that
[9:29] message of this of the sheer foundation
[9:32] and now i want to look at what we need
[9:34] to put on a sure foundation what is god
[9:37] trying to do because we know god's
[9:38] purpose and intent is not just to lay a
[9:40] foundation and leave it there but his
[9:42] purpose and
[9:43] his intent is to build something
[9:47] so a tabernacle has walls a tabernacle
[9:49] has a roof and the tabernacle has things
[9:52] inside of it and a tabernacle on the
[9:54] spiritual side is reflecting
[9:57] an establishment of god
[10:00] this is something that the children of
[10:02] israel did when they were coming through
[10:04] the wilderness you remember they were
[10:06] just wandering in the wilderness but
[10:07] there came a point in time that they
[10:09] built a tabernacle
[10:11] so there was a stepping point there was
[10:13] a juncture in time there was a purpose
[10:15] behind that and it was representing that
[10:18] god was trying to establish them around
[10:21] something
[10:22] so the tabernacle was in the middle and
[10:24] then the children of israel were
[10:26] surrounding that and i'm not going to go
[10:29] into all of those those details there
[10:31] but you understand that main principle
[10:34] but this record this represents an
[10:36] establishment of god this represents the
[10:39] stableness of god this represents the
[10:42] confidence of god
[10:44] um a tabernacle
[10:47] is a unmoving structure
[10:50] with walls and a roof
[10:51] now it can be moved
[10:54] at the direction of god
[10:56] so it's not a temple once the temple's
[10:58] there it's not going anywhere
[11:00] you understand
[11:02] but that's not what the voice told john
[11:04] the the voice did not tell john that the
[11:07] temple of god is with men it said the
[11:09] tabernacle of god is with men
[11:12] so it is a movable structure but it's
[11:14] not easily moved it has to be
[11:17] orchestrated by god they're following
[11:19] the pillar of uh fire they're following
[11:21] the cloud so when god would move
[11:24] and and things of that nature then it
[11:26] can be disassembled and it can be moved
[11:29] along but not easily it's it's an
[11:31] establishment it's something that's
[11:33] stable
[11:34] let's turn to
[11:36] ephesians 4.
[11:46] ephesians 4.
[11:53] ephesians 4 and 11 very familiar
[11:58] and he gave some apostles and some
[12:00] prophets and some evangelists and some
[12:02] pastors and some teachers for the
[12:04] perfecting
[12:06] of the saints
[12:08] so this is not just for a foundation of
[12:10] the saints this is for the perfecting of
[12:13] the saints
[12:14] for the work of the ministry for the
[12:16] edifying of the body of christ till we
[12:18] all come into the unity of the faith and
[12:20] of the knowledge of the son of god and
[12:22] to a perfect man unto the measure of the
[12:25] stature of the fullness of christ so not
[12:28] just a partial portion of christ but the
[12:30] fullness of christ an established christ
[12:35] that we
[12:36] henceforth be no more children
[12:40] toss to and fro
[12:42] you're not just going to grab the
[12:43] tabernacle and throw it around it's an
[12:45] establishment it can be disassembled to
[12:47] take it apart but not easily it's not
[12:50] just easily tossed around you're not
[12:51] going to throw it in a duffel bag and
[12:52] take off with it
[12:55] you're not going to be any more children
[12:57] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[12:59] every wind of doctrine by the sleight of
[13:01] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[13:04] lay and wait to deceive
[13:07] so we're obviously
[13:09] spiritualizing this tabernacle and
[13:11] that's what this voice in the book of
[13:12] revelation is doing it's
[13:15] we know that god does not have a
[13:17] physical
[13:19] tabernacle that he's going to cram into
[13:21] your flesh he's not going to take sticks
[13:24] and stones and brick and mortar and cram
[13:26] it into your flesh but he's saying the
[13:28] tabernacle of god is with men
[13:32] so it's a spiritual application very
[13:34] much so
[13:35] but this is true because
[13:37] we can literally become the tabernacle
[13:40] of god to the point that brother branham
[13:42] said that a man can get so full of
[13:44] christ and so full of god that satan
[13:47] does not know what to do with him
[13:50] that's more than a foundation
[13:52] when you get to the point that satan
[13:54] does not know what to do with you that's
[13:56] not just a foundation you're coming into
[13:59] the perfection of christ
[14:05] let's turn
[14:07] back to revelation chapter one i want
[14:09] you to look at this actually written in
[14:10] the bible
[14:16] revelation chapter 21
[14:22] and if we look at
[14:23] if we look at verse one
[14:26] it says i saw a new heaven and a new
[14:28] earth for the first heaven and the first
[14:30] earth were passed away and there were no
[14:31] more sea and i john saw the holy city
[14:34] new jerusalem coming down from god out
[14:36] of heaven prepared as a bride adorned
[14:38] for her husband
[14:40] so that's verse one and verse two but
[14:42] then when you get to verse 3 is the
[14:44] declaration and i heard a great voice
[14:46] out of heaven saying behold the
[14:48] tabernacle of god is with men
[14:53] so it is immediately after john sees
[14:58] the new heaven and the new earth
[15:01] and the holy city the new jerusalem
[15:04] coming down from god out of heaven then
[15:07] the declaration goes forth
[15:09] that the tabernacle of god is with men
[15:14] you say well what does that mean
[15:18] because if you will recollect
[15:20] when brother branham comes and he
[15:22] preaches
[15:24] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[15:25] and the earthly bride
[15:27] he goes through all of these scriptures
[15:29] this is the scripture that he uses for
[15:30] that message but he goes through all of
[15:33] those scriptures and he takes hours
[15:36] and then he gets to the end of it and he
[15:38] says i could drop a little something
[15:40] here if you would like
[15:42] so he goes for hours and hours
[15:45] and then he comes right at the very end
[15:47] and says oh i could tell you something
[15:48] here if you would like and he takes the
[15:50] dimensions of that pyramid of that of
[15:53] that city and he places it on the people
[15:58] and he makes the city now he has the
[16:01] authority to do this i don't have the
[16:03] authority to do this there's nobody in
[16:04] this building that has that authority
[16:06] but he takes this scripture and he takes
[16:08] that city and he literally
[16:12] makes it the people that set him before
[16:14] him
[16:16] so he then declares
[16:20] coincidence coincidentally enough
[16:24] just what the scripture declares
[16:27] because the scripture comes and says i
[16:29] see a new heaven i see a new earth i see
[16:31] the holy city the new jerusalem coming
[16:33] down oh by the way the tabernacle of god
[16:36] is with men
[16:40] you say well i'm sure that was just a
[16:42] coincidence how that worked out he
[16:43] probably just thought of that at the end
[16:45] of the service
[16:46] saints he was literally
[16:48] walking through the scriptures
[16:52] literally
[16:54] fleshing out the scriptures
[16:56] he could not have done anything
[16:59] different
[17:00] because this is exactly what he already
[17:03] did
[17:05] remember this was the angel that showed
[17:07] it to john the first time
[17:10] he can't do anything different so he has
[17:13] to go through verse 1 verse 2 to get to
[17:16] the end of his sermon and finally say oh
[17:18] i could drop a little something here if
[17:19] you would like
[17:20] because this is what he has already done
[17:24] i would almost venture to say that he
[17:26] was riding the trail again
[17:29] this was not the first time that he has
[17:31] done this
[17:32] so he's literally doing this exactly as
[17:36] the scriptures laid in our bible
[17:40] but that declaration comes
[17:44] in the scriptures
[17:46] and in 1964
[17:49] i believe is when he preached is that
[17:51] correct i think it was at the end of
[17:52] 1964.
[17:54] it it comes
[17:56] and it's fleshed out
[17:59] literally in this same pattern that it's
[18:02] written in the scriptures
[18:04] and that it was preached at the branham
[18:06] tabernacle
[18:07] it's very important that we catch that
[18:09] it's not a coincidence
[18:11] so
[18:14] he
[18:15] goes through verse one goes through
[18:17] verse two
[18:18] drops a little something there in verse
[18:20] three
[18:21] but let's continue and read four five
[18:24] and six
[18:25] he says a great voice out of heaven said
[18:27] behold the tabernacle of god is with men
[18:29] and he shall dwell with them and they
[18:31] shall be his people and god himself
[18:33] shall be with them and be their god and
[18:36] god shall wipe away all tears from their
[18:38] eyes there shall be no more death
[18:40] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[18:42] there be any more pain for the former
[18:45] things are passed away
[18:47] and he that set up on the throne said
[18:48] behold i make all things new and he said
[18:52] unto me right for these words are true
[18:55] and faithful
[18:56] and he said unto me
[18:58] it is done
[19:00] you can't get to it being done until you
[19:03] go through verse one through five
[19:06] we're not going to get to the end unless
[19:09] we go through verse one through five
[19:11] but this this voice that's spoken it
[19:13] says behold the tabernacle of god is
[19:15] with men gives a definition for that it
[19:18] says behold the tabernacle of god is
[19:20] with men and then it lays out the
[19:22] definition he will dwell with them
[19:27] they will be his people
[19:30] and god himself shall be with them and
[19:33] be their god
[19:35] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[19:37] their us
[19:40] there shall be no more death
[19:44] neither sorrow
[19:46] nor crying
[19:47] neither shall there be any more pain for
[19:49] the former things are passed away so by
[19:52] the time you get to this portion of
[19:53] scripture you're already saying well
[19:54] that can't already be because i still
[19:56] have that
[19:59] but do you
[20:02] but do you
[20:05] because we can cry
[20:08] we can weep
[20:10] we can get upset
[20:12] but do we not have a prevailing word
[20:16] it's not that all the symptoms just
[20:18] magically disappear the symptoms may
[20:20] still be there
[20:22] but the symptoms are subject to
[20:24] something
[20:26] so whatever is greater takes the
[20:29] precedence
[20:30] and the declaration can be made
[20:34] furthermore how would he wipe the tears
[20:37] from your eyes if you didn't have tears
[20:39] coming from your eyes
[20:42] but the tears coming from your eyes is
[20:44] not the reality it's not the permanent
[20:46] reality him wiping the tears from your
[20:49] eyes is the permanent reality
[20:53] so it's not just all in the future this
[20:55] is very much a present tense living word
[21:00] that has the power christ himself that
[21:03] has the power to do this
[21:06] he shall wipe all tears from their eyes
[21:08] there shall be no more death
[21:11] brother branham says you've already
[21:13] passed from death unto life
[21:16] may there be people in this room that go
[21:18] by way of the grave maybe
[21:20] but you have already passed there is no
[21:23] more death to you
[21:26] a child of god does not die there is no
[21:29] more death
[21:30] remember this is not my declaration this
[21:32] is the angel's declaration
[21:36] i would almost venture to say that he
[21:37] declared that when he preached it's the
[21:38] rising of the son
[21:41] this declaration has been made this is a
[21:44] reality if you want to walk in it
[21:47] if you don't want to walk in it it won't
[21:49] be a reality
[21:50] but there is a presence and there is a
[21:52] word and there is a god a living god
[21:55] among us in the form of his word that
[21:57] can make this a reality
[22:01] neither crying
[22:02] nor crying neither shall there be any
[22:04] more pain
[22:06] for the former things are passed away
[22:10] your new birth
[22:13] and he that set up on the throne said
[22:15] behold i make all things new
[22:19] and he said unto me right for these
[22:21] words are true and faithful and he said
[22:23] unto me it is done
[22:26] so now as we're coming through this
[22:28] scripture and brother bradham takes
[22:31] verse one and two and he preaches that
[22:32] message the future home of the heavenly
[22:34] bridegroom and the earthly bride and he
[22:36] breaks that down and he shows what god
[22:38] is going to do and then he takes that
[22:40] and he places it on the people and he
[22:42] makes them the city and he makes and he
[22:45] identifies their god to them and he
[22:47] makes them aware that god is dwelling
[22:49] with him and that god is there to wipe
[22:51] away their tears
[22:53] not
[22:54] not just a good thought saints not just
[22:57] a good thought in your imagination not
[22:59] your willpower
[23:01] literally the word the person of the
[23:05] word has come to do these things and
[23:08] he's making the people aware of them
[23:11] and there's a declaration that goes
[23:13] forth that says when when the people and
[23:16] the word comes to this point
[23:19] god himself is making a declaration
[23:22] when it comes to this juncture in time
[23:24] and when it comes to this point
[23:27] the tabernacle of god is with men
[23:31] now this is a declaration by god himself
[23:33] you can argue with it if you want to but
[23:35] it doesn't change anything
[23:37] because god himself says when it comes
[23:39] to this juncture in time and to this
[23:41] point and when these words are uttered
[23:43] and when these scriptures are fulfilled
[23:45] i myself am making a declaration that
[23:48] the tabernacle of god is now with men
[23:54] so much so
[23:56] that when he comes to verse six
[23:58] he would say it is done
[24:04] it is done
[24:05] the tabernacle of god is with men
[24:08] a couple more verses
[24:09] it is done
[24:12] there is only three times that i can
[24:14] find that this is mentioned in the
[24:16] scriptures that god makes this
[24:18] declaration the first is we've already
[24:20] read in genesis in genesis 1.
[24:25] he created the host let's just go back
[24:27] up and read it so i don't butcher it
[24:29] and god saw everything that he had made
[24:31] and behold it was very good and the
[24:33] evening and the morning were the sixth
[24:34] day thus the heaven and the earth were
[24:36] finished and all the host of them they
[24:38] were finished
[24:40] and on the seventh day god ended his
[24:42] work which he had made
[24:44] and he rested on the seventh day from
[24:46] his work which he had made so god comes
[24:49] out and he declares it is very good
[24:52] it's finished it's done
[24:54] now this does not mean
[24:57] that god stopped revealing himself
[25:00] because he even moved and put man in
[25:02] flesh
[25:03] so he continued revealing himself but
[25:07] what was done
[25:09] was the tabernacle of god was with men
[25:12] what was done was what god was wanting
[25:15] to accomplish in a relationship
[25:19] because the relationship was what he was
[25:21] after
[25:23] and he creates all of these things and
[25:26] all of these things man and woman even
[25:28] though they have not been separated yet
[25:30] and put in two distinct bodies of
[25:33] flesh
[25:34] even though he hasn't continued in his
[25:37] revelation he has come to a point in his
[25:39] revelation that he himself would step
[25:42] back and say this is very good and i'm
[25:45] done
[25:48] but yet he would
[25:50] continue revealing himself
[25:53] and he would continue revealing himself
[25:56] but the point and the purpose
[26:00] the relationship
[26:02] and the preeminence that he was after
[26:05] he had successfully obtained
[26:08] so that's in genesis then we come into
[26:10] the new testament
[26:11] and christ himself comes on earth
[26:15] and he has his ministry and he goes to
[26:17] the cross and they nail him to the cross
[26:19] and the last words that are uttered out
[26:22] of his mouth is it is finished
[26:25] so he says this in the very beginning
[26:27] when his relationship is correct and
[26:29] then he comes and he obtains preeminence
[26:31] in his son in the man christ jesus so
[26:34] much so that he would lay down his own
[26:36] life and be nailed to a cross
[26:40] and he would utter the words it is
[26:42] finished well we know it wasn't finished
[26:46] because
[26:47] we had to come out of him there was
[26:49] further revelation there was farther
[26:53] there was farther
[26:57] expressions that came forth
[27:00] but what god was after in the form of a
[27:03] relationship he comes and makes that
[27:06] declaration it is done it is finished
[27:09] this is it
[27:12] and then he keeps revealing himself
[27:16] and then he comes to the end of the book
[27:18] that we've just been reading here in
[27:20] revelation chapter 21
[27:23] and he would show the new heavens and
[27:24] the new earth
[27:26] the new jerusalem the holy city
[27:31] and he would show all of that and he
[27:34] declares himself as our god
[27:37] our comforter
[27:39] to take away the sting of death to take
[27:40] away all sorrow
[27:43] and he would have a vindicated prophet
[27:45] standing on the
[27:46] earth that would say by the way you're
[27:49] the city
[27:51] and when that declaration goes forth god
[27:53] himself comes behind that and says it is
[27:55] done
[27:56] what i'm wanting to achieve my purpose
[28:00] here it is done
[28:04] it is finished i am satisfied i am happy
[28:07] it is very good
[28:11] but yet brother branham said he would be
[28:12] revealing himself to us throughout
[28:13] eternity
[28:17] but the relationship that he is after
[28:19] remember he had he had a threefold plan
[28:22] in the back of his mind the whole time
[28:25] he had that in eden that's why he could
[28:27] declare it's done
[28:29] but then it fell so he has to start
[28:31] restoring it and he re he obtains
[28:33] preeminence in christ jesus so he can
[28:35] declare it's done it's finished
[28:38] for the revelation comes out for the
[28:39] revelation further expression
[28:41] now he has his bride again and he
[28:43] declares it is done it is finished it is
[28:45] good i am resting
[28:49] but then remember he's going to take
[28:50] them back to eden
[28:54] but the relationship is what he's after
[28:57] that is what he is uttering the
[28:59] declaration about of it being finished
[29:02] of it being done
[29:12] john 19.
[29:21] i just covered this but i want to read
[29:22] it real quick
[29:26] john 19 28.
[29:40] after this jesus knowing that all things
[29:42] were accomplished
[29:44] that the scripture
[29:46] might be fulfilled
[29:49] that's the important part
[29:51] that this scripture might be fulfilled
[29:54] saith
[29:55] i thirst
[29:56] now there was said a vessel full of
[29:58] vinegar and they filled a sponge with
[30:00] vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put
[30:02] it to his mouth
[30:04] when jesus therefore had received the
[30:05] vinegar he said
[30:07] it is finished
[30:10] remember these are the final words of
[30:12] christ
[30:14] and he bowed his head and gave up the
[30:16] ghost
[30:18] these are the final words of god in
[30:20] flesh these are not trivial words
[30:24] these are not
[30:25] a spontaneous utterance
[30:28] he meant what he said
[30:31] so how can he declare that it is
[30:33] finished
[30:34] but yet there are farther expressions
[30:37] and for the revelation to come forth
[30:39] because what was finished was what was
[30:42] god trying to obtain what was his
[30:44] purpose what was he trying to do
[30:47] remember his threefold plan so now
[30:49] christ god in flesh is coming
[30:53] and he's recognizing that he has
[30:55] obtained preeminence in a man
[30:59] moses couldn't do it abraham couldn't do
[31:01] it jacob couldn't do it isaac couldn't
[31:03] do it joseph couldn't do it they're all
[31:04] building up to that but finally he gets
[31:07] preeminence in one man
[31:10] and that part of the plan he puts his
[31:12] stamp on it and he says it's finished
[31:15] it's done
[31:18] hebrews 12
[31:20] verse 1 says wherefore seeing we are
[31:22] also encompassed about with so great a
[31:25] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[31:27] every way and the sin which doth so
[31:29] easily beset us and let us run with
[31:32] patience the race that is set before us
[31:34] looking unto jesus
[31:36] the author
[31:38] and finisher
[31:41] of our faith
[31:43] who for the joy that was set before him
[31:44] endured the cross despising the saint
[31:47] the shame and is set down at the right
[31:49] hand of the throne of god so jesus makes
[31:52] this declaration that it is finished
[31:56] but remember he's the author
[31:58] and finisher of the faith
[32:01] he's the author and finisher of our
[32:04] faith
[32:05] the author and finisher of our faith
[32:09] but christ knows he has come to this
[32:12] preeminence he has came to this juncture
[32:14] in time he has fulfilled what the
[32:16] scripture has said about him he has
[32:18] fulfilled what god has wanted from him
[32:21] and he knows that if he has done that
[32:24] he has made a way to finish the faith
[32:27] that is why he can declare it as
[32:29] finished
[32:30] he finished his portion yes but that was
[32:33] enabling us to then finish our portion
[32:38] he knows where he's standing
[32:40] he knows what he has accomplished he
[32:42] knows what he has done and he is making
[32:45] that declaration not lightly
[32:47] he is making an emphatic declaration
[32:50] it is finished it is done
[32:56] remember we're speaking about the
[32:57] tabernacle of god being with men
[33:00] jesus came to the point that he could
[33:02] lay his own life down so that the
[33:03] scriptures would be fulfilled to know
[33:06] where he stand to the point that he can
[33:07] declare
[33:09] god's plan in me is finished
[33:13] brother branham says the bride would be
[33:14] the final voice to the final age
[33:17] this was not a flippant voice that jesus
[33:19] used when he declared this
[33:21] the final voice to a final age will not
[33:24] be a flip of voice
[33:26] if i'm going to make it today i might
[33:28] not make it tomorrow
[33:29] i'm okay with christ now not okay with
[33:32] christ now i'm a son of god today i'm
[33:34] not a son of god tomorrow
[33:37] that's not a tabernacle
[33:41] that's a child blown with doctrine back
[33:44] and forth that's a child blown back and
[33:46] forth with their emotional state
[33:49] that's not a tabernacle that's
[33:50] established
[33:53] it's not even a firm foundation to put
[33:55] walls in a roof on
[33:58] if we're to be a final voice to a final
[34:01] age we have to be an established
[34:03] tabernacle that's the that's the
[34:05] declaration from christ the tabernacle
[34:07] of god is with men
[34:09] if the final voice is in the bride which
[34:12] i believe it is we believe that it is
[34:15] it's not going to be an unsteady voice
[34:18] it's not going to be a pup tent
[34:21] that you can take take down and set up
[34:24] in 30 seconds
[34:25] it's going to be the tabernacle of god
[34:29] in men an establishment with walls and a
[34:33] roof and things inside of it
[34:36] not easily moved it can be moved if god
[34:38] directs it to be
[34:39] but not easily moved and only moved
[34:43] when god moves
[34:46] so we can say that
[34:48] and i think we believe that
[34:51] that we're the final voice to the final
[34:53] age
[34:54] but the final voice to the final age is
[34:56] going to be a sure voice
[34:58] it is not going going to declare things
[35:01] flippantly it is going to be very steady
[35:03] it is going to be very established
[35:08] psalm 27 verse 1 says
[35:10] the lord is my light and my salvation
[35:12] whom shall i fear the lord is the
[35:14] strength of my life of whom shall i be
[35:16] afraid when the wicked even mine enemies
[35:19] and my foes came upon me to eat my flesh
[35:21] they stumbled and fell though and host
[35:24] shall encamp against me my heart shall
[35:26] not fear though war shall rise against
[35:28] me in this will i be confident one thing
[35:31] have i desired of the lord that i will
[35:33] seek after that i may dwell in the house
[35:35] of the lord all the days of my life to
[35:37] behold the beauty of the lord and to
[35:39] inquire in his temple
[35:43] for in the time of trouble
[35:45] he shall hide me in his pavilion
[35:47] and the secret of his tabernacle shall
[35:49] he hide me
[35:51] he shall set me upon a rock
[35:55] this is the scripture that brother
[35:56] brandon preached the rapture message out
[35:58] of
[35:59] and look what david's talking about a
[36:01] temple
[36:02] a tabernacle a pavilion
[36:06] established
[36:09] establishments
[36:13] not easily moved
[36:16] things that are put in place and in a
[36:19] certain spot for a reason
[36:22] very stable
[36:29] verse six and now shall my head
[36:32] be lifted up above my enemies around
[36:34] about me therefore i will i offer in his
[36:37] tabernacle sacrifices of joy
[36:40] i will sing yea i will sing praises unto
[36:44] the lord so verse one through six david
[36:47] is nailing it down
[36:48] i am god's son
[36:50] he is with me
[36:52] i am in his pavilion i am in his temple
[36:55] i am in his
[36:56] tabernacle
[36:58] my enemies are around me and i don't
[37:00] care god will deal with them
[37:02] and then it comes to verse 7.
[37:06] hear o lord when i cry with my voice
[37:09] have mercy also upon me and answer me
[37:14] you say well that's a paradox that is a
[37:17] paradox but your answer is in a couple
[37:19] verses right above that because he says
[37:26] in verse 6
[37:28] now
[37:29] shall my head
[37:31] be lifted up above my enemies
[37:35] his head will be lifted up above his
[37:37] enemies
[37:39] not his whole body
[37:44] his head will be lifted up his
[37:46] revelation will be lifted up and
[37:49] established and secure
[37:51] but that does not mean you're not going
[37:52] to have a bad death
[37:56] you're allowed to have a bad day
[38:00] but go back to what's in your head
[38:02] your revelation and overcome the bad day
[38:06] there's nothing wrong with crying out to
[38:08] god to have mercy on me been there done
[38:11] that usually three or four times a day
[38:13] there's nothing wrong with crying out to
[38:14] the lord hear my voice
[38:17] have mercy on me what have i done now
[38:20] why am i like this what's going on what
[38:22] did i do there's nothing you haven't
[38:24] lost your mind
[38:26] david did the same thing immediately
[38:28] after six verses of telling everybody he
[38:30] didn't care where his enemies were at
[38:32] and what they were doing god dealt with
[38:33] them i'm invincible can't touch me i'm
[38:36] lifted up i'm in god's pavilion
[38:40] his head was his revelation was
[38:45] but there was still hybridization
[38:46] attacking it
[38:48] but that doesn't matter
[38:52] because the word can and will prevail
[38:56] if
[38:57] if and only if you get back in the
[39:01] tabernacle
[39:02] back in the pavilion
[39:04] back in the temple
[39:07] you get outside of the pavilion outside
[39:09] of the tabernacle outside of the temple
[39:12] all you're going to do is whine and cry
[39:13] for god to have mercy on you
[39:15] and you should
[39:17] and you should because you're going to
[39:18] need it
[39:20] but he has sent a word an
[39:23] all-encompassing word i would say it
[39:25] this way he has brought a word he didn't
[39:27] just send it he has brought a word
[39:31] to cover that
[39:33] to be a pavilion around you to rapture
[39:36] you up
[39:37] to rapture your revelation
[39:41] to catch you up into his temple to catch
[39:43] you up into his pavilion
[39:46] that even those those things would be
[39:48] real in this dimension they're not real
[39:50] in reality
[39:52] i'm not going to try to explain that
[39:53] statement i hope you got it
[39:56] brother branham speaks
[39:58] about abraham
[40:01] and he says abraham represented election
[40:04] isaac represented justification
[40:07] jacob represented grace joseph
[40:09] represented perfection and he says that
[40:11] is what god built when he said he built
[40:13] on those patriarch those patriarchs
[40:17] but you look at abraham he was elected
[40:20] would anybody deny that abraham was not
[40:22] elected
[40:24] but abraham was so elected
[40:29] that he was terrified to go down into
[40:32] this city with his wife because the king
[40:33] would kill him and take his wife who the
[40:35] promised son was supposed to come
[40:36] through
[40:38] he was so elected
[40:41] that he would tell her to lie like
[40:44] whatever you got to do lie you're not my
[40:46] wife don't let them kill me
[40:48] abraham was full of election
[40:52] undisputed
[40:54] but he was still still fearful
[40:58] isaac the promised son
[41:01] brother says represented justification
[41:03] but he was so justified he would do the
[41:05] same thing as daddy did
[41:06] and go and lie
[41:08] because he was still fearful
[41:11] jacob represented grace
[41:15] but
[41:16] jacob
[41:17] was terrified
[41:19] of his own brother
[41:21] terrified what couldn't even go back
[41:23] home
[41:24] until he had a wrestling match
[41:26] with god himself
[41:29] election
[41:32] justification
[41:34] and grace
[41:36] undeniable
[41:37] but still feel free still fearful
[41:41] but brother randall says joseph was
[41:42] perfection
[41:45] i want to read you this quote about
[41:46] joseph
[41:47] it's one of my favorite quotes it's
[41:49] mind-blowing to me i've read it here
[41:50] before
[41:52] but he says this concerning joseph's
[41:54] daily walk
[41:56] he says now joseph saw it by his own
[41:59] life he's speaking of the resurrection
[42:01] he's speaking of the resurrection of
[42:03] christ
[42:04] he says now joseph saw it in his own
[42:07] life
[42:08] he seemed that he was born a peculiar
[42:11] boy that he was a seer there was
[42:13] something about him he could see visions
[42:14] he couldn't understand it he even went
[42:16] and told his mother and father when they
[42:18] tried to correct him when he seen the
[42:19] sheaves all bowing to his he couldn't
[42:21] understand it but then next thing he
[42:23] found out that he was betrayed by his
[42:24] brethren
[42:26] so joseph has this vision of everything
[42:28] bowing down to him but then he's
[42:30] betrayed thrown in a ditch taken up as
[42:32] dead taken down to egypt and thrown in
[42:34] prison
[42:37] his response
[42:39] his response
[42:42] he said
[42:44] what am i portraying here
[42:47] what is this for knowledge that i am
[42:50] receiving
[42:52] that's a pretty typical response i mean
[42:55] it's probably what i would do
[42:58] totally different than abraham isaac and
[43:00] jacob
[43:02] totally different
[43:04] no fear
[43:06] no fear
[43:07] the only fear that he had was that one
[43:09] scratch on the masterpiece that he told
[43:11] his father to lie
[43:13] because he still had a little bit of
[43:14] pride of life in him but he had to
[43:16] because he wasn't christ jesus
[43:18] so he had to have that little scratch
[43:19] brother and he said
[43:21] but this is a man whose daily walk was
[43:24] so sure and so established that when he
[43:27] would see something that he knew was 100
[43:30] true and then everything else listen
[43:33] everything else would deny that
[43:37] everything that he saw everything that
[43:39] he heard even everything he tasted
[43:43] was denying that revelation
[43:46] and he would still
[43:48] have one question for god
[43:50] not why
[43:51] not poor me
[43:54] what are you trying to reveal through my
[43:56] life right now
[43:58] oh my goodness
[44:02] what a maturity
[44:04] what a state of mind
[44:07] you tell me what the devil does with
[44:09] that
[44:10] he only has one option when you come to
[44:13] that level he has only got one option
[44:15] and he has got to kill the vessel that's
[44:17] carrying that
[44:19] but he can't do that
[44:21] he cannot do that because god says you
[44:23] will not have permission to do that
[44:26] but remember his works to discredit the
[44:28] word and if he can't do that kill the
[44:30] vessel
[44:31] when you come to this level of maturity
[44:34] he has no options but to either run and
[44:37] get away from you
[44:39] or kill you
[44:41] and he can't kill you
[44:42] because you're predestinated for your
[44:44] atoms to change and go into in a
[44:45] physical rapture
[44:48] that's not just a good saying saints
[44:50] that's what the prophet taught
[44:53] a man can get so full of god that satan
[44:56] doesn't know what to do with him
[44:58] remember he's only got the two tactics
[45:02] to discredit the word and make you
[45:04] unbelieve or to kill you
[45:06] so if he can't make you unbelieve and
[45:08] you are so mature to the point that
[45:10] every attack that he brings in your life
[45:12] your response is thank you jesus i love
[45:14] you what part of your word am i
[45:16] portraying right now
[45:20] i'm pretty sure he's
[45:22] recognizing yeah i probably better get
[45:25] them off the scene
[45:27] i think they're believing the word
[45:30] because you may fake that once maybe
[45:32] even twice but you're not going to do it
[45:34] monday tuesday and wednesday by
[45:35] wednesday you'll fall apart
[45:39] if it's a fake
[45:40] but if it's real
[45:42] it'll be a daily life
[45:44] each and every day
[45:46] walking with the word walking with the
[45:49] spirit walking in christ setting in his
[45:51] pavilion setting in his temple
[45:55] allowing god's declaration to be true
[45:59] my tabernacle
[46:01] is with that man
[46:03] my tabernacle is with that woman
[46:06] they have recognized
[46:09] they are my city
[46:11] and i am declaring and oh by the way
[46:13] john write it down
[46:15] because it's true and it's faithful
[46:20] what an example joseph would set
[46:26] i would say i would say to try that
[46:31] start trying that
[46:33] but it's going to have to be more than a
[46:34] try sense
[46:36] it's going to have to be reality
[46:40] but i would say this the same way
[46:41] brother branham said about your physical
[46:44] health
[46:44] you set a well person out in front of
[46:46] you and you walk into it
[46:50] i say go home and put it on your fridge
[46:52] go home and write some post-it notes
[46:54] what part of christ am i portraying in
[46:58] this situation
[47:00] let it become a reality
[47:03] walk into it
[47:04] because it's real it is possible
[47:08] and now i'm going to tell you why it's
[47:09] possible revelation 2 verse 13.
[47:13] revelation 2
[47:16] verse 13.
[47:28] revelation 2 13 i know
[47:31] thy works this is christ himself
[47:32] speaking
[47:33] and where thou dwellest where thou
[47:35] dwellest even where satan's seat is
[47:38] could we all agree that we're sitting in
[47:40] satan's seat
[47:42] we're walking around in satan's seat
[47:45] so much so that the the prophet would
[47:47] say this is satan's eden
[47:49] it's not just his seat it's his eden
[47:54] and thou hold as fast my name and has
[47:57] not denied my faith
[48:01] that's how you can get to the point
[48:05] that your reaction to every situation
[48:07] can be what part of your word and your
[48:10] attributes am i portraying right now
[48:13] because if it was your faith you'd never
[48:15] be able to do it
[48:17] but christ has said
[48:19] i know thy works and where thou dwellest
[48:22] he knows where you're at saints he
[48:24] hasn't forgot you
[48:26] he knows where we're at
[48:28] he knows we're in satan's eden but he
[48:30] says i know your works where thou
[48:32] dwellest even where satan's seed is and
[48:36] thou holdest fast my name remember his
[48:38] name is his characteristics
[48:41] you can run around screaming jesus all
[48:43] you want if you don't have the
[48:44] characteristics of jesus be quiet
[48:48] but if you have the characteristics of
[48:49] jesus you don't even have to say the
[48:51] name jesus
[48:55] satan recognizes the characteristics
[48:58] just like they did with peter and john
[49:00] when they took him before the council we
[49:01] don't know what's going on here we don't
[49:03] know where you come from but i know
[49:05] where their characteristics came from
[49:07] and i know who you've been with
[49:11] thou has not denied
[49:14] my faith
[49:16] big difference from his faith in your
[49:18] faith
[49:20] church age book brother branham says
[49:22] acts 3 16 when peter was asked
[49:25] how the mighty miracle had taken place
[49:26] upon the crippled one at the gate
[49:28] beautiful we explained it in this verse
[49:30] or in this was
[49:32] and in his
[49:34] jesus name
[49:35] through faith in his
[49:38] jesus name
[49:39] hath made this man the former
[49:43] strong yea the faith which is by
[49:47] brother brandon puts in parentheses from
[49:50] him parentheses jesus
[49:53] hath given him
[49:55] the man
[49:57] this perfect soundness in the presence
[49:59] of you all
[50:00] see there it is jesus name and jesus
[50:04] faith brought about the miracle
[50:08] peter did not claim it was his own human
[50:10] faith any more than he claimed that it
[50:14] was his own name
[50:19] he said that jesus name
[50:21] used in the faith
[50:23] which is from jesus
[50:26] performed the great works
[50:30] this is how it's possible saints this is
[50:33] how joseph could have the reaction that
[50:34] he had
[50:37] this face this faith is what the lord
[50:39] was speaking about in revelation 2 13.
[50:43] it was his faith
[50:45] it was not faith in him
[50:49] this is deep saints catch it
[50:53] it was not faith in him
[50:58] but it was his own faith
[51:02] christ's own faith
[51:04] god's own faith
[51:07] that he had given to the believers
[51:12] this is not intellectualism
[51:15] this is literally a portion of god his
[51:19] faith the same faith that he had when he
[51:22] said let there be and believed his own
[51:24] word and it performed is what he has
[51:27] given to the believers
[51:30] his own faith that he has given to the
[51:32] believers romans 12 3 according as god
[51:36] hath dwelt dealt to every man according
[51:39] to verse 1 the men are brethren
[51:43] the measure of faith
[51:45] ephesians 2 verse 8 by grace are ye
[51:48] saved through faith and that faith not
[51:51] of yourself it is a gift of god
[51:57] not just a gift
[51:59] from god
[52:00] it is a gift
[52:02] of god
[52:08] it is a gift
[52:10] of god
[52:13] if i want to give one of you a gift
[52:16] i can
[52:17] bring and i can give you a gift
[52:20] and i can walk away
[52:24] but this gift is a gift
[52:26] of god
[52:30] so if god brings a gift of himself and
[52:34] he gives it to you he can't walk away
[52:39] he's there
[52:40] it's of him
[52:42] you say that's really simple i know it
[52:44] is but praise the lord it excites me
[52:47] it's not a gift from him
[52:50] it's a gift of him
[52:54] this is what you can overcome by
[52:58] because gifts will fail
[53:01] even true gifts
[53:03] true gifts will fail
[53:07] but the gift
[53:08] of him
[53:10] the gift
[53:11] of god
[53:12] will not fail john 13 verse 1 says now
[53:15] before the feast of the passover when
[53:17] jesus knew that his hour was come that
[53:19] he should depart out of this world and
[53:21] to the father
[53:22] having loved his own which were in the
[53:24] world he loved them unto the end
[53:28] and supper being ended the devil having
[53:30] now put into the heart of judah security
[53:33] simon's son to betray him
[53:38] jesus knowing
[53:40] jesus knowing that the father had given
[53:43] all things unto his hands
[53:45] and that he was come from god and went
[53:48] to god
[53:51] that's a revelation
[53:54] jesus knowing
[53:57] that the father had given all things
[54:00] into his hands and that he was come from
[54:03] god
[54:04] that he went to god i would venture to
[54:06] say this is the faith of god
[54:09] this is the revelation of god
[54:14] jesus knowing this
[54:18] rises from supper and laid aside his
[54:19] garments and took a towel and girded
[54:21] himself and after that he poured water
[54:22] into a basin and began to wash the
[54:24] disciples feet and to wipe them with a
[54:26] towel wherewith he was girded
[54:33] that's not a man's reaction
[54:38] that is not a
[54:39] carnal reaction
[54:42] this is a true and accurate reaction to
[54:45] a proper revelation
[54:47] brother branham says true revelation
[54:50] always
[54:51] always
[54:53] always
[54:54] brings humility
[54:58] that's what you can judge revelation
[54:59] about
[55:01] that's what you can judge whether it's a
[55:03] gift from god or a gift of god
[55:08] jesus knowing all things
[55:10] were in his hands
[55:13] and that i'm come from god
[55:15] and that i'm going back to god
[55:18] come here and let me wash your feet
[55:25] that
[55:26] is not a hybrid reaction
[55:31] that is not
[55:33] giving over to the lust of the eye
[55:36] to the pride of life and the lust of the
[55:38] flesh
[55:39] that is a complete and utter
[55:43] death to self
[55:45] and a proper revelation with a proper
[55:47] reaction
[55:50] i want to look at this real quick
[55:53] he told me i could do this myself
[55:58] he beat me to it
[56:03] i want to
[56:06] now look at a big picture
[56:16] i want to look at a big picture of the
[56:19] message
[56:21] and of brother branham's ministry
[56:24] with a
[56:29] understanding
[56:31] that brother branham said
[56:33] when that angel goes forth and begins to
[56:35] declare his message he says now not the
[56:38] healing campaigns
[56:40] he says but when he begins to declare
[56:42] his message
[56:43] when he begins to speak the word
[56:47] when this angel begins to do that this
[56:49] is the message
[56:51] not the minor gifts as great as they
[56:53] were not the discernment as great as it
[56:56] was but he says when he goes out and
[56:58] begins to declare the message
[57:00] that's what this angel is really sent
[57:01] for
[57:02] when this third poll starts getting into
[57:05] getting into action
[57:09] now
[57:10] i would venture to say the majority of a
[57:12] setting here have the understanding
[57:14] that this angel that was revealing these
[57:16] things to john was brother branham but
[57:18] just in case you don't or just beca in
[57:21] case you're on the fence i want you to
[57:23] compare
[57:25] this with your bible
[57:27] brother branham comes at the end of 1960
[57:31] and he begins walking through the book
[57:34] of revelation
[57:36] literally
[57:38] he comes and he preaches the revelation
[57:40] of jesus christ
[57:42] at the in december 1960.
[57:45] he comes and he breaches the patmos
[57:47] vision
[57:49] and guess what
[57:50] he goes right into the church ages
[57:53] you say oh well he's just taking it and
[57:54] breaking it down like any good teacher
[57:55] will do i mean that's just that's just
[57:57] good common sense it is
[58:00] but this is different because any good
[58:03] teacher
[58:05] any good teacher wouldn't go from the
[58:07] philadelphian church age
[58:09] into the 10 virgins 144 000 jews and
[58:12] then come back and do the laodicean
[58:14] church age
[58:15] i guarantee you there is no school grade
[58:17] school high school junior high college
[58:20] that would do that
[58:23] they're going to go from the
[58:23] philadelphia and church age to the
[58:25] laodicean church age
[58:28] but he can't do that
[58:30] because remember he's already ran this
[58:31] trail once
[58:33] and it's in the scriptures that he can't
[58:35] do that
[58:36] whether he knows it or not i don't know
[58:40] i wasn't there to ask him
[58:43] i would venture to say he had at least
[58:45] some kind of inkling
[58:48] but whether he did or whether he didn't
[58:49] i don't know the fact of the matter is
[58:53] he did it scripturally
[58:56] in order with the scriptures
[58:58] so he comes 1960
[59:01] at the end of 1960 and he goes
[59:03] revelation jesus christ patna's
[59:05] patentless vision
[59:06] church ages 10 virgins 144 000 jews
[59:11] and then he goes
[59:13] and finishes the laodicean church age
[59:15] and then he goes immediately into
[59:16] revelation chapter four
[59:19] and if you go home and you follow this
[59:20] through your bible you'll realize this
[59:22] is what you're doing
[59:27] on his message titles
[59:29] literally
[59:31] this is what you're doing
[59:39] it goes from revelation chapter four
[59:42] goes to chapter five does a few parts on
[59:44] each one of those comes to 1963 now this
[59:48] is not an exhaustive list for those of
[59:51] you that are very analytical because i
[59:52] know there's some of you here this is
[59:54] not an exhaustive list
[59:56] if you want i can do that but it's
[59:58] wednesday night
[1:00:00] so i'm having mercy
[1:00:02] he comes and he hits the breach
[1:00:04] first seal second seal third seal fourth
[1:00:06] seal fifth seal and we know this this is
[1:00:08] common to us
[1:00:10] but he comes in between the sixth and
[1:00:12] the seventh seal does questions and
[1:00:13] answers
[1:00:16] and then he comes a couple months later
[1:00:19] does christ is the mystery of god
[1:00:20] revealed
[1:00:21] goes to the feast of the trumpets and
[1:00:23] again if you're following in your bible
[1:00:25] this is what you're doing
[1:00:27] you can literally see his footprints
[1:00:31] walking right through
[1:00:34] walking right through
[1:00:37] but this is where it got interesting for
[1:00:39] me
[1:00:40] because he comes after the seals
[1:00:43] and he hits towards the tail end of 1964
[1:00:47] and he preaches future home of the
[1:00:49] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:00:50] bride
[1:00:52] now remember the scriptures that he used
[1:00:55] for this was in revelation chapter 21.
[1:00:57] there's only one more chapter left
[1:01:00] but he still has over a year of ministry
[1:01:03] left
[1:01:05] but there's only one chapter left
[1:01:08] but he only has a he has he still has a
[1:01:10] year of ministry left and he's still
[1:01:12] preaching
[1:01:13] but there's only one more chapter left
[1:01:17] and
[1:01:19] there has been a declaration by god
[1:01:21] himself that when you come to this point
[1:01:24] you're done
[1:01:27] because the tabernacle of god is with
[1:01:28] men
[1:01:30] and it's finished
[1:01:33] but he preaches future home
[1:01:37] and then
[1:01:38] he says the identified masterpiece of
[1:01:40] god
[1:01:41] well what's the identified masterpiece
[1:01:43] of god
[1:01:45] the earthly bride
[1:01:48] then he comes and he preaches birth
[1:01:49] pains
[1:01:50] well who's going to have the birth pains
[1:01:54] the earthly bride
[1:01:56] and then he preaches god's provided
[1:01:57] place of worship well where's that
[1:02:01] it's in the bride
[1:02:03] it says what's the attraction on the
[1:02:05] mountain
[1:02:08] and in that message he says what we
[1:02:10] looked at for years and what we pondered
[1:02:12] at and studied at he says everything
[1:02:14] that we've been looking at now that is
[1:02:16] history
[1:02:22] remember there's only one chapter left
[1:02:26] 1965 911
[1:02:29] god's power to transform
[1:02:32] to transform what
[1:02:34] an earthly bride
[1:02:37] what house
[1:02:39] will you build me
[1:02:44] i don't know maybe an earthly bride
[1:02:47] if that'll do
[1:02:48] i mean that's what god said he wanted so
[1:02:50] i guess that'll do
[1:02:53] the invisible union of the bride of
[1:02:55] christ
[1:02:58] to what
[1:03:00] maybe a heavenly bridegroom
[1:03:04] and then
[1:03:06] he hits
[1:03:07] the rapture
[1:03:10] because remember there's one chapter
[1:03:12] left
[1:03:13] even so come quickly lord jesus
[1:03:17] but he has one more title right at the
[1:03:19] very end of his ministry
[1:03:22] things that are to be
[1:03:25] and the reason that he has to preach
[1:03:28] things that are to be
[1:03:29] is because he don't have a choice
[1:03:31] because revelation chapter 1 verse 19
[1:03:34] says write
[1:03:35] the things which thou hast seen
[1:03:39] what he saw on the isle of patmos
[1:03:42] the seven-fold person is of jesus christ
[1:03:44] write all those things that you've seen
[1:03:45] john
[1:03:47] and the things which are
[1:03:48] christ through the church ages
[1:03:50] and by the way
[1:03:52] write the things that will be hereafter
[1:03:58] so when he comes and preaches future
[1:04:00] home
[1:04:02] whether he knew it or not i don't know
[1:04:04] but god himself had already made the
[1:04:06] declaration it's done
[1:04:08] your ministry is finished
[1:04:10] my tabernacle is now with men
[1:04:12] your purpose is accomplished he has
[1:04:15] nothing else to preach
[1:04:16] but he keeps preaching
[1:04:18] because remember when god says it's done
[1:04:22] and it's finished and i approve
[1:04:25] he still keeps revealing himself
[1:04:27] but what he's after
[1:04:30] is that relationship
[1:04:32] so when he comes and he takes that new
[1:04:35] heavens that new earth that holy city
[1:04:37] the new jerusalem and he takes that and
[1:04:39] says that is you people
[1:04:43] the tabernacle of god is with men
[1:04:47] he only has one chapter left to work
[1:04:49] with and one verse in chapter 1 verse
[1:04:51] 19.
[1:04:53] anything else would be unscriptural
[1:04:56] so the only thing he can preach about is
[1:04:58] either the heavenly bridegroom or the
[1:05:00] earthly bride or the relationship
[1:05:03] and that's what he does all the way down
[1:05:06] through here
[1:05:07] until he finally says okay i can finally
[1:05:09] touch revelation chapter 22 even so come
[1:05:11] quickly lord jesus
[1:05:13] physical rapture
[1:05:16] and then just because he probably liked
[1:05:18] to preach the gospel he says surely
[1:05:20] there's just a little bit something else
[1:05:21] i can talk about surely i've got some
[1:05:23] standing somewhere and he comes to
[1:05:25] revelation chapter 1 verse 19 it says oh
[1:05:27] by the way you're allowed to talk about
[1:05:28] the things which shall be hereafter
[1:05:30] praise the lord let's preach things that
[1:05:31] are to me
[1:05:35] now
[1:05:36] i say that
[1:05:38] because of this
[1:05:41] i want to stand here today right here
[1:05:43] and right now and tell you that brother
[1:05:45] william branham is my absolute
[1:05:50] because i have a proper revelation of
[1:05:52] who he is and what he did
[1:05:56] and my understanding is far
[1:06:00] far inferior to that
[1:06:04] if a man can be so predestinated by god
[1:06:08] take all the supernatural elements away
[1:06:11] not that we would but hypothetically
[1:06:14] speaking take the discernment away take
[1:06:16] the visions away take all the
[1:06:18] supernatural events away
[1:06:20] and just look at his footprints through
[1:06:23] the scripture and what he preached and
[1:06:26] it matches the scripture
[1:06:28] how foolish would i be
[1:06:31] to say i need to balance this man's
[1:06:33] ministry out with something else
[1:06:36] or
[1:06:37] maybe he was off in some other spot
[1:06:41] he did say this but
[1:06:44] how
[1:06:45] foolish would you be
[1:06:48] but i've heard those statements
[1:06:50] i literally set across a lunch table
[1:06:52] from a man what we would call a
[1:06:55] superpower in the message and two years
[1:06:57] before he fell away he made the comment
[1:06:59] to me that we have to understand that in
[1:07:02] order to properly understand brother
[1:07:04] branham's ministry we have to balance it
[1:07:06] out with all the men of god that was on
[1:07:08] the scene at that time
[1:07:11] and i was naive saints i admit i'm sorry
[1:07:13] i was naive
[1:07:15] i was like well
[1:07:17] that ain't right
[1:07:19] but
[1:07:20] maybe he meant something else
[1:07:23] two years later he completely falls away
[1:07:25] from the message
[1:07:29] but brother bryan says that's what the
[1:07:30] holy ghost was given to you for he says
[1:07:31] that little thing down inside of you
[1:07:34] that you get a little funny feeling when
[1:07:35] somebody says something he says that was
[1:07:37] the holy ghost given to you to keep you
[1:07:39] away from that thing
[1:07:41] but this is a
[1:07:42] superpower within the message and he
[1:07:44] would make that comment just over a
[1:07:45] lunch table and i'm like
[1:07:47] balance it out
[1:07:50] okay
[1:07:51] so in order for me to balance brother
[1:07:53] branham's ministry out and i know you
[1:07:55] all believe this i'm not trying to
[1:07:56] convince you of this
[1:07:58] i'm just wanting you to look and see how
[1:08:00] grateful we should be that we have a
[1:08:01] proper understanding
[1:08:03] but in order for me to balance something
[1:08:06] out with him that means i automatically
[1:08:09] have to take something else
[1:08:12] and use my intellect to reason and
[1:08:16] decide how to balance it out
[1:08:21] that was the whole point of god sending
[1:08:23] me a prophet
[1:08:24] [Music]
[1:08:25] so that i didn't have to do that because
[1:08:28] he knew if i did have to do that i
[1:08:30] wouldn't stand a chance
[1:08:34] so it was the whole purpose to get me
[1:08:36] out of that position
[1:08:38] thank god
[1:08:41] it bum-fuzzles me
[1:08:43] why people
[1:08:45] have an issue with having an absolute
[1:08:50] thank god i have an absolute i would be
[1:08:53] a disaster if i didn't have an absolute
[1:08:56] because then i would have to wonder if
[1:08:58] you were right or if i was right or if
[1:09:00] this other guy was right and all by the
[1:09:02] way he don't even believe that brother
[1:09:03] random was a prophet anymore
[1:09:06] you talk about being tossed to and fro
[1:09:10] this was god's grace to us
[1:09:14] but i say that
[1:09:16] because no doubt
[1:09:18] there's somebody
[1:09:21] that maybe just doesn't have a perfect
[1:09:22] understanding of that yet and maybe this
[1:09:24] will help you
[1:09:26] so i would never do away with the
[1:09:28] supernatural vindication never
[1:09:31] god did that why would i want to do away
[1:09:34] with it but i'm just saying
[1:09:35] hypothetically look what he did with the
[1:09:38] scriptures
[1:09:42] look what he did with the scriptures
[1:09:46] i don't want my own opinion
[1:09:50] i don't want my own opinion now and i'm
[1:09:51] not saying that to get you all right up
[1:09:53] and you know praise god yes that's right
[1:09:55] let's tear the walls down anybody that
[1:09:57] don't believe that's the antichrist i'm
[1:09:59] not i'm not trying to work you up i'm
[1:10:01] just saying that
[1:10:03] in honest humility
[1:10:05] i am so
[1:10:07] grateful and this is what i told our
[1:10:08] pastor around back before i came around
[1:10:10] i said i am just so
[1:10:12] grateful brother brandon says don't you
[1:10:14] ever take this message for granted but
[1:10:16] we do saints and don't try to tell me
[1:10:18] you don't because we do
[1:10:21] but then something like this will pop up
[1:10:23] and you'll do i mean this wasn't an
[1:10:25] in-depth study this was 15 minutes of
[1:10:27] god just having grace and mercy and
[1:10:28] revealing something to me look what he
[1:10:30] did and it's not even what i would say
[1:10:32] new i mean i'm sure somebody's already
[1:10:33] preached this before
[1:10:35] but just to me i started seeing with
[1:10:37] clarity
[1:10:39] oh my goodness
[1:10:40] look what he has done
[1:10:42] literally walking through the scriptures
[1:10:47] that to me
[1:10:49] is the vindication
[1:10:52] because i wasn't there to see the other
[1:10:54] i believe it with all of my heart
[1:10:56] but i'm here to see this
[1:10:59] and i don't care what else you have you
[1:11:01] can't take this away from me
[1:11:03] and i can see a man just in the
[1:11:06] simplicity of his message titles
[1:11:09] walking through the scriptures and
[1:11:11] fulfilling what malachi 4 was to do and
[1:11:14] what revelation 10 7 was to do
[1:11:16] i can see that
[1:11:18] just with the ability to read and god's
[1:11:20] faith in me
[1:11:22] that he put in me
[1:11:24] and i'm thankful for that and this
[1:11:26] blessed me so i wanted to share that
[1:11:27] with you
[1:11:30] we're going to come to a close here
[1:11:32] 1964 the identification identification
[1:11:35] of christ in all ages
[1:11:37] now remember hold that in your mind when
[1:11:39] brother branham preaches future home he
[1:11:41] don't have anywhere else to go
[1:11:43] i won't say you don't have anywhere else
[1:11:44] to go he's got very little room to go
[1:11:47] you understand he's only got one chapter
[1:11:49] to work with at the end of revelation
[1:11:50] and one verse to work with at the
[1:11:52] beginning of revelation
[1:11:54] so in 1964 he says the identific in the
[1:11:57] identification of christ in all ages
[1:11:59] heavenly father we are grateful to see
[1:12:01] the risen messiah 1900 years of all
[1:12:03] kinds of theology and movements but
[1:12:05] still in the darkness of it all you
[1:12:07] promised that you would appear here in
[1:12:08] the last days in this sodom day and you
[1:12:11] would you yourself
[1:12:12] make yourself known to the children of
[1:12:14] abraham the call the elected and here
[1:12:17] you are tonight after 1900 years listen
[1:12:20] to what he's saying here you are tonight
[1:12:22] here you are here you are here you are
[1:12:25] you are just as much just as much alive
[1:12:27] tonight as you was when you talk to the
[1:12:30] woman at the well it's god manifested in
[1:12:33] flesh now in the flesh of his bride
[1:12:37] for the bride and the husband is the
[1:12:38] self-same flesh brother chad just read
[1:12:40] this
[1:12:41] these two are one and the church is
[1:12:44] becoming the bride all the time by
[1:12:46] believing the word
[1:12:48] so don't try to become the bride without
[1:12:49] believing the word
[1:12:51] so that the word and the church becomes
[1:12:53] the same the word and the church making
[1:12:56] it the bride the last sign
[1:13:03] god identifying himself the word
[1:13:06] in the church
[1:13:09] the last sign
[1:13:13] the future home of the heavenly
[1:13:14] bridegroom and the earthly bride the
[1:13:16] last sign the tabernacle of god is with
[1:13:20] men
[1:13:22] the last sign
[1:13:25] 1962 oneness brother brandon says the
[1:13:28] kingdom of god is god's word made power
[1:13:32] so just in case you were wondering what
[1:13:33] the kingdom of god is
[1:13:35] god's kingdom is his word made power
[1:13:38] that means his word fleshed out in your
[1:13:41] life
[1:13:41] made power
[1:13:43] what is the kingdom of god it's within
[1:13:46] you
[1:13:49] that kind of sounds like the tabernacle
[1:13:51] of god is with men
[1:13:53] kind of sounds like you are the city
[1:13:56] kind of sounds like you are the new
[1:13:58] jerusalem
[1:13:59] it kind of sounds like to me we may be
[1:14:02] living the last sign
[1:14:04] and we've only got one chapter left to
[1:14:06] go
[1:14:09] and then we have
[1:14:11] all of the things that are to be
[1:14:13] throughout eternity
[1:14:18] ephesians three you don't have to turn
[1:14:20] there i'm going to i'm going to go
[1:14:21] through this fast for time's sake but
[1:14:23] we're going to close here in just a
[1:14:24] minute i promise ephesians 3 verse 1 for
[1:14:27] this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus
[1:14:29] christ for you gentiles if ye have heard
[1:14:31] of the dispensation of the grace of god
[1:14:33] which is given to
[1:14:35] you word
[1:14:37] how that by revelation he made known
[1:14:39] unto me the mystery as i wrote a four in
[1:14:43] a few words so how he made known to me
[1:14:46] of the mystery
[1:14:48] and i wrote to you a four in a few words
[1:14:52] whereby when ye read ye may understand
[1:14:55] my knowledge in the mystery of christ so
[1:14:58] paul is saying i know the mystery and i
[1:15:01] wrote to you in a few words before
[1:15:04] this is in chapter three
[1:15:06] so what do you do
[1:15:08] you go back a chapter
[1:15:10] ephesians 2 19 because he said i wrote
[1:15:12] to you about this in a few words before
[1:15:16] ephesians 2 19
[1:15:18] now therefore ye are no more strangers
[1:15:23] and foreigners
[1:15:26] but fellow citizens with the saints and
[1:15:28] of the household of god the household of
[1:15:31] god the household of god
[1:15:33] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:15:35] apostles you're built
[1:15:37] you're built upon the foundation of the
[1:15:39] apostles and prophets jesus christ
[1:15:41] himself being the chief cornerstone
[1:15:44] the chief cornerstone what do you use a
[1:15:46] cornerstone for you're building a house
[1:15:49] you're building a tabernacle in whom all
[1:15:52] the building now he just comes out and
[1:15:54] says it in whom all the building
[1:15:57] fitly framed together groweth into a
[1:15:59] holy temple
[1:16:01] remember what he was writing about in a
[1:16:03] few words
[1:16:04] before the mystery
[1:16:07] of god
[1:16:10] in whom all the buildings fitly framed
[1:16:12] together groweth unto a holy temple in
[1:16:14] the lord in whom ye build it together
[1:16:17] for a habitation of god through the
[1:16:20] spirit
[1:16:22] the tabernacle of god is with men
[1:16:26] there's no wonder he said it's done it's
[1:16:29] finished after that because that was the
[1:16:31] mystery
[1:16:32] and paul said i wrote to you about it a
[1:16:34] few words before
[1:16:36] seven or eight verses i wrote to you
[1:16:38] about the mystery of god a few words
[1:16:39] before
[1:16:40] the mystery
[1:16:42] the tabernacle of god is with men
[1:16:46] the
[1:16:47] second phase of his threefold purpose
[1:16:55] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[1:16:57] gave unto him this is revelation 1 as
[1:16:59] the musicians come this is revelation 1
[1:17:02] 1 the revelation of jesus christ which
[1:17:04] god gave unto him to show unto his
[1:17:06] servants things which must shortly come
[1:17:08] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[1:17:10] his angel and to his servant john who
[1:17:12] bear record of the word of god and of
[1:17:14] the testimony of jesus christ and of all
[1:17:16] things which he saw
[1:17:17] listen to this statement that brother
[1:17:19] branham makes in the church age book
[1:17:21] the very beginning of the church book
[1:17:24] this book is usually termed the
[1:17:25] revelation of saint john but that is
[1:17:27] incorrect
[1:17:28] it is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:17:30] given to john for christians of all ages
[1:17:33] it is the only book this is what i want
[1:17:34] you to catch it is the only book in the
[1:17:37] entire bible that is written by jesus
[1:17:39] himself
[1:17:41] so we've got that it is the only book in
[1:17:43] the entire bible that is written by
[1:17:45] jesus himself
[1:17:47] through
[1:17:48] personally appearing to a scribe
[1:17:52] now catch this
[1:17:54] jesus himself
[1:17:56] wrote this book through personally
[1:17:59] appearing to a scribe
[1:18:05] the funny part is is when the scribe
[1:18:07] which was john
[1:18:10] fell down to worship him he wouldn't
[1:18:11] receive worship
[1:18:15] but it was jesus christ himself
[1:18:18] personally appearing to john
[1:18:25] see where it's a razor's edge
[1:18:28] see where it's a razor's edge
[1:18:31] jesus christ himself personally
[1:18:34] appearing to the scribe but when the
[1:18:36] scribe falls down and tries to worship
[1:18:37] him and he says don't do it i'm a i'm of
[1:18:39] you i'm a brother
[1:18:41] but this is jesus personally appearing
[1:18:43] to you
[1:18:44] and write it down because it's true and
[1:18:46] it's faithful
[1:18:48] but don't worship me
[1:18:50] but write it down it's true and it's
[1:18:52] faithful and it's jesus personally
[1:18:53] appearing to you
[1:18:56] see the razor's edge
[1:18:59] see the razor's edge
[1:19:03] there's a scripture in the bible that
[1:19:05] says i will cause all men to come and
[1:19:06] worship at your feet
[1:19:09] bride worship
[1:19:13] i'll give you a couple minutes to
[1:19:14] recover
[1:19:17] why should that shock us that's what
[1:19:19] john tried to do to the angel that was
[1:19:22] representing jesus christ personally
[1:19:24] appearing to him
[1:19:26] because jesus christ is the word
[1:19:30] and the word was indwelling a prophet to
[1:19:34] personally appear to john
[1:19:36] and if you
[1:19:38] are the tabernacle
[1:19:41] of god
[1:19:43] why should it be such a shock that he
[1:19:46] would cause all men to come and worship
[1:19:48] at your feet
[1:19:52] they're not worshipping
[1:19:54] you
[1:19:56] but what they are worshiping remember
[1:19:58] i'm not saying praise
[1:20:00] if they start praising you we got a
[1:20:02] problem
[1:20:05] i said worship that's what the scripture
[1:20:07] says worship is to submit yourself to
[1:20:10] bow down to recognize that's right and
[1:20:13] i'm wrong
[1:20:16] you say i would never let anybody do
[1:20:17] that
[1:20:18] i'll say this that if your true bride
[1:20:20] you've already done it yourself
[1:20:22] because someday somebody came walking
[1:20:24] along your path
[1:20:27] and they said something you never heard
[1:20:28] before
[1:20:30] and you said where'd you get that at and
[1:20:32] they said right here in this book and
[1:20:33] you took the book and you read the book
[1:20:35] and you're like
[1:20:36] i give up my idea
[1:20:39] and i'm going to take that idea
[1:20:43] and i how did that get here by the way
[1:20:46] it's almost like jesus christ personally
[1:20:48] appeared to me himself
[1:20:52] see the razor's edge
[1:20:54] you can get off one side you can get off
[1:20:56] the other let's stand together
[1:20:58] we can get off one side we can get off
[1:20:59] the other
[1:21:01] but there's a truth there
[1:21:04] there's a truth there
[1:21:06] and it's the same truth that the angel
[1:21:08] represented
[1:21:10] please just go ahead and come brother
[1:21:12] it's the same truth that the angel
[1:21:13] represented
[1:21:16] he told john the word that i gave you
[1:21:19] it is true it is faithful it is right it
[1:21:21] will heavens and earth will pass away
[1:21:23] but that word won't fail you write it
[1:21:25] down
[1:21:26] don't worship me
[1:21:29] i'm simply one that's standing nearby
[1:21:30] while he does these things
[1:21:34] it's a razor's edge saints
[1:21:37] but it's true
[1:21:39] and it's possible if we will completely
[1:21:42] die to ourself
[1:21:43] and we will allow
[1:21:45] it to be true
[1:21:47] he didn't do all of this coincidentally
[1:21:51] and if he preached the future home of
[1:21:53] the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:21:55] bride brother chad said it very well the
[1:21:57] other day he said what he was really
[1:21:58] doing was he was also showing you your
[1:22:00] present home
[1:22:01] when he preached future home he's also
[1:22:03] showing you your present home and that's
[1:22:04] what he said in the message he says if i
[1:22:06] get anything over to you i'm trying to
[1:22:08] get over to you how god's redeemed you
[1:22:11] well why wouldn't you title the message
[1:22:13] how god redeemed you instead of future
[1:22:16] because he's walking through the
[1:22:18] scriptures
[1:22:19] and in order to show you your future
[1:22:21] home you first have to come to a proper
[1:22:23] understanding of your present home
[1:22:27] he was a true and a faithful witness and
[1:22:30] i thank god
[1:22:32] i thank god i am so grateful i am more
[1:22:34] grateful today than ever and as time
[1:22:37] goes on and we see the fallacies of men
[1:22:40] we are going to be more thankful and
[1:22:42] more thankful and more thankful that god
[1:22:44] in his simplicity could send us a
[1:22:46] prophet and a gift himself personally
[1:22:49] appearing to us remember john was us
[1:22:52] him personally appearing to us and he
[1:22:55] would place something within us his own
[1:22:58] faith to be able to recognize that
[1:23:01] and say
[1:23:02] that is my absolute that is nothing but
[1:23:05] the truth thank you god
[1:23:08] i so appreciate what god has done for us
[1:23:12] i want to read this last verse
[1:23:16] just
[1:23:18] so if you got
[1:23:19] sidetracked you'll remember this one
[1:23:21] thing
[1:23:23] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[1:23:25] saying behold the tabernacle of god is
[1:23:27] with men and he will dwell with them and
[1:23:30] they shall be his people and god himself
[1:23:32] shall be with them and be their god
[1:23:36] and in verse 6 he says it
[1:23:39] is
[1:23:39] done
[1:23:42] and then i'm going to leave you with one
[1:23:44] question
[1:23:45] that's a good question
[1:23:47] you may have heard it before
[1:23:50] what time is it sirs
[1:23:55] what time is it sirs
[1:23:57] because we've only got one chapter left
[1:23:59] to work with and one verse in the
[1:24:01] chapter one to work with let's bow our
[1:24:03] heads
[1:24:05] precious lord jesus we just want to
[1:24:08] thank you once again father for your
[1:24:09] word
[1:24:10] lord we want to thank you as you said in
[1:24:13] your scripture that you would send us
[1:24:16] the gift of elijah
[1:24:18] so that we would not be cursed
[1:24:20] and father it would be one thing that if
[1:24:22] we would be
[1:24:24] physically cursed and smitten from the
[1:24:26] earth but god how much worse would it be
[1:24:29] that if we would be left on that same
[1:24:31] earth with nothing but our own
[1:24:33] understanding
[1:24:35] lord what a wreck we would be what a
[1:24:36] terrible miserable hell on earth that
[1:24:39] would be to have no absolute but just
[1:24:42] have to rely on our own intellect dear
[1:24:45] god i want to thank you tonight that you
[1:24:47] have sent us that gift that we do not
[1:24:50] have to be in that condition lord and
[1:24:52] that you have placed
[1:24:53] something within us that we can yield to
[1:24:56] that that we can recognize the gift that
[1:24:59] you have sent to us and we do not have
[1:25:01] an issue worshiping that lord worshiping
[1:25:04] the word you yourself that came through
[1:25:07] that the son of man
[1:25:11] lord we are so grateful we are the most
[1:25:14] grateful people on the face of the earth
[1:25:16] we worship you tonight lord we thank you
[1:25:19] for that may we never take that for

[1:27:38] [Music]
[1:27:42] and i'm already
[1:27:47] [Applause]
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:27:58] over
[1:28:09] amen praise the lord
[1:28:12] amen are you already his
[1:28:15] amen i thought the service this evening
[1:28:17] was so interesting because of a
[1:28:18] conversation i had through text today
[1:28:21] with uh brother stephen shimbo brother
[1:28:24] stephen shimbo said something to me on
[1:28:26] the
[1:28:27] uh solomon's temple
[1:28:29] and he and he goes to
[1:28:31] solomon's temple and he shows that there
[1:28:33] was 120 priests ministering at the
[1:28:36] dedication of solomon's temple
[1:28:39] and he made note of it and i asked him a
[1:28:41] question about the 120 priest and he
[1:28:43] tied it to the day of pentecost
[1:28:45] and i asked him a question and he made a
[1:28:47] statement all of a sudden things
[1:28:49] exploded for me
[1:28:51] he said there was the day that solomon's
[1:28:53] temple we know the temple is a type of
[1:28:55] the bride
[1:28:56] as the tabernacle's a type of christ the
[1:28:58] temple is the type of the bride because
[1:29:00] the tabernacle was one tent one laver
[1:29:04] one one altar
[1:29:06] one lamp stand one table but when you
[1:29:10] get to solomon's temple you've got ten
[1:29:12] lavers
[1:29:13] ten lampstands ten tables and ten is the
[1:29:17] number of the church five wise and five
[1:29:19] foolish so you can see one is male and
[1:29:21] one is female when you get to solomon's
[1:29:22] temple it's a type of the church
[1:29:25] many stones amen built together for a
[1:29:28] habitation of god
[1:29:30] so with the dedication of this temple
[1:29:32] there was 120 priests ministering and
[1:29:35] that the dedication the pillar of fire
[1:29:37] come in behind the veil and the smoke
[1:29:39] filled the temple until those 120
[1:29:41] priests could not minister anymore
[1:29:44] but on the day of pentecost when god
[1:29:46] amen was going to
[1:29:48] anoint his new temple
[1:29:51] there was 120 in the upper room and the
[1:29:54] pillar of fire come in and the smoke so
[1:29:56] filled the room um theoretically that
[1:29:58] they could no longer even speak in their
[1:30:00] own language they could never no longer
[1:30:02] minister the way they were because now
[1:30:04] it was the dedication of the new temple
[1:30:07] amen because god wants to be tabernacled
[1:30:10] in man and god wants to dwell with man
[1:30:12] and have fellowship with man
[1:30:14] it's been a theme all through the bible
[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:18] i mean i was i was talking with brother
[1:30:20] ben around back i didn't know what he
[1:30:21] was going to preach on but i was just
[1:30:22] telling him that i've been i've been
[1:30:25] looking at the prayers of the prophet of
[1:30:26] god i've been looking at his prayers in
[1:30:29] the beginning of his sermons and at the
[1:30:30] end and the prayers i find fascinating
[1:30:33] what brother branham's asking for he
[1:30:35] he's asking that the people will get it
[1:30:37] that they'll see amen that they'll see
[1:30:39] what i've tried to say lord would you
[1:30:41] bring this reality into them lord would
[1:30:43] you bring this manifestation into them
[1:30:46] may the bride have their eyes open and
[1:30:47] he's praying amen not that the people
[1:30:49] will recognize him he's praying that the
[1:30:51] people will recognize who they are
[1:30:57] when brother branham starts talking
[1:30:59] about
[1:31:00] that now we have god in flesh
[1:31:04] he's saying now christ is manifest in
[1:31:07] his church and he begins to refer back
[1:31:10] to the plains of memory when god elohim
[1:31:12] would be in flesh and with his back to
[1:31:14] the tent with discern sarah and whenever
[1:31:17] brother madam's talking about that he is
[1:31:19] referring to his present stage
[1:31:21] manifestation
[1:31:22] that now god but he never makes it
[1:31:25] singular he always makes it plural but
[1:31:27] what we have now is god in the church
[1:31:31] because the goal was never for god to
[1:31:33] stop with that one man but the purpose
[1:31:35] was to bring it to a people
[1:31:38] and so brother branham when he's
[1:31:39] referring to now we see the presence of
[1:31:41] god with his people god back in flesh
[1:31:43] again and he every when he speaks of
[1:31:46] that you can only
[1:31:48] see that through the manifestation of
[1:31:49] the day and that's god in that prophet
[1:31:51] but brother branham never speaks
[1:31:53] singular he always speaks plural to the
[1:31:55] church in a whole because that was the
[1:31:58] whole point
[1:32:02] that's why if we leave that in that man
[1:32:05] we've missed the whole point of his
[1:32:06] ministry
[1:32:08] that's why if we make it singular when
[1:32:10] he didn't make it singular he made it
[1:32:12] plural we see it with singular in that
[1:32:15] day but the point was to show the wave
[1:32:17] sheep so that you would have faith in
[1:32:19] the process to bring you to the same
[1:32:21] place
[1:32:21] [Music]
[1:32:23] and because the point of his prayers is
[1:32:25] not that you would see him the point of
[1:32:27] his prayers is that you would see
[1:32:28] yourself
[1:32:30] what brother branham was asking god to
[1:32:31] show us is that we wouldn't recognize he
[1:32:33] was modified for in revelation 10 7 but
[1:32:35] that you would recognize that you're the
[1:32:37] tabernacle of god
[1:32:40] the place where deity wants to dwell and
[1:32:42] manifest through the bride
[1:32:44] [Music]
[1:32:46] so what i told ben around back not
[1:32:48] knowing what he was about to preach
[1:32:51] i said the question is is god answering
[1:32:53] our prayers for the prophet's prayers
[1:32:56] as god is opening our eyes and revealing
[1:32:58] himself to us he's answering our prayers
[1:33:00] surely but i believe he's honoring the
[1:33:02] prayers of that prophet who was praying
[1:33:04] for this day
[1:33:06] he was praying for us to see
[1:33:08] to believe to understand what he was
[1:33:11] trying to say
[1:33:13] and i believed in this day and this
[1:33:14] message tonight and in our hearts that
[1:33:17] god is honoring the prayers of that
[1:33:18] prophet from 50 some years ago and he's
[1:33:21] allowing us to see what he was saying
[1:33:24] what he was trying to get across
[1:33:27] and i say thank you lord
[1:33:32] when you want to talk about worthiness
[1:33:35] we're not worthy
[1:33:37] so
[1:33:39] the worthy one took our place
[1:33:42] and by his blood in the washing of his
[1:33:44] blood he makes us worthy so that we
[1:33:46] don't ever have to worry about worthy
[1:33:47] anymore
[1:33:49] how many times is the devil keeping us
[1:33:51] from our position because of worthiness
[1:33:53] the worthiness issues already been dealt
[1:33:55] with don't worry about it
[1:33:58] faults and failures and mishaps and
[1:34:00] hybridization it's all been paid for
[1:34:02] it's all under the blood god took care
[1:34:04] of it all so that we could have the
[1:34:06] faith in that sacrifice and the shed
[1:34:08] blood for us so that we could be who he
[1:34:10] called us to be without the devil
[1:34:12] putting all these thoughts in our minds
[1:34:13] it was already taken care of let it be
[1:34:15] taken care of and let god do what he
[1:34:19] wants to do in this day
[1:34:21] and just say god
[1:34:23] i see it in your word
[1:34:24] i see the pattern through the scripture
[1:34:26] i see what's supposed to be manifest in
[1:34:28] this day i believe what the prophet
[1:34:31] i receive it in the name of jesus christ
[1:34:33] let it be done in me
[1:34:36] mary had no worthiness to bring that
[1:34:38] prophecy to pass mary had no ability she
[1:34:40] wasn't worthy
[1:34:43] but yet she said beat unto me how many
[1:34:45] would like to say lord be it unto me
[1:34:49] that you'll tabernacle yourself in this
[1:34:51] flesh
[1:34:52] be it unto me according to your word
[1:34:56] be it unto me let it be according to
[1:34:58] what your prophet taught let it be
[1:34:59] according to what you wrote in your
[1:35:00] scriptures i believe it's for me and i
[1:35:03] believe it's for today i can't do it i'm
[1:35:06] not worthy enough i don't have any
[1:35:08] ability i'll never be good enough but i
[1:35:10] still believe it's true and i still
[1:35:12] believe it applies to me be it unto me o
[1:35:14] god
[1:35:15] let me be a tabernacle you can live in
[1:35:18] let me be a dwelling place a holy
[1:35:21] habitation for your presence for your
[1:35:23] spirit
[1:35:24] see friends if we don't accept it that
[1:35:26] way we'll never accept it if we wait to
[1:35:28] be good enough if we wait to see enough
[1:35:30] good works if we wait to see enough
[1:35:32] perfection in our life we will never
[1:35:33] come into the manifestation of the word
[1:35:35] because everything has to be done by
[1:35:37] faith and if you keep looking at
[1:35:38] yourself you'll never have a faith to
[1:35:40] step into this prophecy to manifest this
[1:35:44] part of the word but we have to do is
[1:35:46] look at what god has done look at what
[1:35:48] he did on calvary look at what he did
[1:35:50] when he sent a prophet look at what god
[1:35:52] has done so that we would have
[1:35:53] confidence enough to say it's the truth
[1:35:55] and i'm part of it by his grace
[1:35:58] not by my ability all of this was done
[1:36:01] so that you and i would have the faith
[1:36:03] to step into the word and say let it be
[1:36:06] in being
[1:36:07] [Music]
[1:36:09] praise be to god
[1:36:11] god could not take over mary until mary
[1:36:13] submitted to god until she believed what
[1:36:16] the angel said about her
[1:36:18] and when she believed what the angel
[1:36:19] said about her and surrendered to that
[1:36:21] word then the prophecy from 700 years
[1:36:24] began to take effect
[1:36:26] the same thing's happening today friends
[1:36:29] let's believe what god said through a
[1:36:31] prophet let's take it face value in the
[1:36:34] simplicity i was speaking to a couple
[1:36:36] brothers last sunday about the word and
[1:36:39] i was saying we we feel like we've
[1:36:41] become so advanced in revelation
[1:36:44] i mean we're growing in revelation this
[1:36:46] is true we're growing in revelation but
[1:36:48] we've come so advanced in our revelation
[1:36:52] that we've become childish enough just
[1:36:54] to take the word for the way it's
[1:36:55] written
[1:36:57] that's how advanced we've become
[1:36:59] that we can just read the bible and say
[1:37:01] that's the truth
[1:37:03] not advanced in higher intellectualism
[1:37:06] but the advancement in revelation is
[1:37:08] becoming simple
[1:37:10] becoming childlike to say when paul says
[1:37:13] you are the body of christ you can say
[1:37:16] that's what he meant
[1:37:18] it wasn't an allegory it wasn't
[1:37:19] theoretical it was the truth
[1:37:21] that's how high we've come in revelation
[1:37:24] we've become so great that we can just
[1:37:26] say
[1:37:27] you could read what a fourth grader
[1:37:29] could read and come to the same
[1:37:30] conclusion a fourth grader could come to
[1:37:32] and say that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:37:35] that's what it means to become great in
[1:37:37] revelation
[1:37:38] is to become simple enough to believe
[1:37:40] exactly what he said
[1:37:42] the same thing with the prophet
[1:37:44] just get simple enough to believe
[1:37:46] exactly what he said if he said that you
[1:37:49] are the habitation of god the place that
[1:37:51] god wants to live in the new jerusalem
[1:37:53] that's on earth in this day
[1:37:55] if you are the representation of that
[1:37:58] future home
[1:37:59] the place where he's going now
[1:38:01] can we become so high in revelation that
[1:38:03] we can come like a child and said if he
[1:38:05] said it i believe it that's the truth
[1:38:07] because i see it in the word
[1:38:10] praise be to god what a day we live in
[1:38:14] let's just worship the lord we'll
[1:38:15] dismiss you
[1:38:17] thank god i appreciate the word as it
[1:38:19] feeds our souls and encourages us to
[1:38:22] keep believing and keep moving let's
[1:38:25] just worship god you can be dismissed as
[1:38:27] you choose to go you can stay in worship
