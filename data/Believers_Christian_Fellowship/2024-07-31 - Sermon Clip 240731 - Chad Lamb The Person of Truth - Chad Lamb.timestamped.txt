[0:00] brother B said in God's provided place
[0:03] of
[0:03] worship he said the church will come
[0:06] through justification through Luther
[0:07] through sanctification through
[0:09] Wesley through the baptism of the Holy
[0:11] Ghost or the Pentecostals and go right
[0:13] on into the Perfection of the son of man
[0:15] that when husband and wife will be the
[0:17] same self
[0:19] persons God will be so manifested into
[0:22] his bride his church till they will both
[0:24] be the same they are one now you see
[0:28] where we're at
[0:31] how is that going to happen by embracing
[0:34] the person of
[0:35] Truth by receiving the person of Truth
[0:38] and letting the spirit of Truth come and
[0:42] take up residence in me and begin to
[0:45] live out to
[0:47] truth you know what sometimes we don't
[0:51] maybe quite understand what brother
[0:53] brenon meant by this or what that
[0:55] scripture
[0:56] means but if the spirit of Truth lives
[0:58] in us we will still act out the truth
[1:02] am we will still project
[1:06] truth I may not comprehend how this and
[1:10] this add together and I may not be able
[1:12] to intellectualize it but if the life of
[1:15] that word that I can't intellectualize
[1:16] in me I will still be living the life of
[1:19] the word I'll still be projecting the
[1:21] very life and nature of Jesus Christ
[1:23] even if my comprehension hasn't come to
[1:25] the place yet where I say oh click
[1:27] that's it amen but I'll still be
[1:29] projecting the the very nature of Jesus
[1:31] Christ and along the way the spirit of
[1:33] truth will guide me into all truth and
[1:35] as we're moving down living the life of
[1:37] Jesus Christ one day click oh that's it
[1:40] I got it
[1:44] now what's more
[1:47] important brother B says you have long
[1:51] hair have a long dress down to your
[1:53] ankles and have tempered enough to fight
[1:54] a buz
[1:57] saw that's not truth
[2:01] the dress is Right The Temper is
[2:06] wrong see what I'm saying
[2:09] am this message is Christ
[2:15] am turn it to the
[2:19] right this is the Vindication that this
[2:22] message is right what made it the
[2:24] Vindication that this message is right
[2:27] because it was
[2:28] Christ that's what made it truth is that
[2:31] Christ identified himself in the cloud
[2:34] in the message and he declared to the
[2:37] whole world when brother bam turned that
[2:39] cloud to the right he declared to the
[2:40] whole world it's
[2:42] me this message is
[2:45] me that made this message the
[2:49] truth not because all of a sudden we
[2:51] lined up all the scriptures immediately
[2:53] we could verify it and we could cross
[2:55] reference it and check it no the very
[2:56] person of Jesus Christ being identified
[2:59] in that cloud was the Vindication that
[3:01] this is the truth because this he and
[3:03] this is the same thing making it all the
[3:06] truth cuz he is the truth and when
[3:08] Christ identified himself in the message
[3:10] it Vindicated that this message is the
[3:13] truth not when we figured it out but
[3:16] when he identified himself with it
