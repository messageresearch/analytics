[0:00] you say well this guy did a certain
[0:02] certain thing your brother didn't do
[0:04] that your sister didn't do that that was
[0:06] the devil got into them that did it so
[0:08] don't blame the brother the sister blame
[0:10] the devil that's the one who caused it
[0:14] amen and brother bam said if you can get
[0:16] somebody to realize this they won't have
[0:18] enmity but they'll feel sorry
[0:21] if you can get to the place where
[0:23] somebody actually says something against
[0:25] you I mean they said something wrong and
[0:27] they said something hurtful and they
[0:28] shouldn't have said it they
[0:30] misunderstood a situation they repeated
[0:31] something wrong if you can get to the
[0:33] place to recognize this is a tactic of
[0:36] the devil and I'm not going to fall so
[0:38] easily to the devil's Wiles but I
[0:41] realized that my brother was just a tool
[0:43] in the devil's hands it wasn't him that
[0:45] brother loves me
[0:47] how do you know that brother loves you
[0:49] because if he loves Christ he loves me
[0:51] he can't help it
[0:54] sometimes we've got to fly a little
[0:56] higher On Eagle's Wings and have Eagle
[0:58] Vision and get out of the Cardinal and
[1:00] stop with all the offense and the hurt
[1:01] and he said and she said and fly a
[1:03] little higher and find out who's moving
[1:05] the chess pieces
[1:08] and you realize now I feel sorry for my
[1:10] brother and you know why I feel sorry
[1:12] for my brother because I'm going to
[1:14] forgive him I'm going to let it go and
[1:15] I'm never going to mention it but
[1:17] someday I know that brother's going to
[1:18] feel sorry for what he did
[1:21] yes
[1:24] and now I feel for him with compassion
[1:26] I'm not angry I'm not upset I don't want
[1:28] him to get in trouble I don't want God
[1:30] to spank him I don't want lightning
[1:32] that's Fallen I'm going to only get in a
[1:33] car accident on the way to work I really
[1:35] want to forgive him and let him go and
[1:36] ask God to forgive him and let him go
[1:38] and realize my brother didn't mean to
[1:40] and I know someday he'll be sorry for
[1:42] that and when that day comes I know what
[1:44] it's like because I've been sorry for
[1:46] things I did wrong
[1:47] and I know how horrible it is and how
[1:49] bad you feel and how shamed you are and
[1:51] how you how you feel like you failed God
[1:53] and your brother and I know that my
[1:55] brother is going to go down that same
[1:56] road and I'm feeling sorry for him now
[1:58] see you realize I'm getting the I'm
[2:01] getting the the the the the pity off of
[2:04] myself
[2:07] and I'm turning it outward and saying
[2:09] God help my brother
[2:11] he didn't mean to do that my sister
[2:13] you know
[2:15] what
[2:16] let's say that you assume that they
[2:18] didn't mean to but really they did
[2:21] how will it hurt you to assume that they
[2:23] did they didn't
[2:25] I would rather be found in error
[2:28] assuming my brother and sister didn't
[2:29] mean to then always in error assuming
[2:31] they did
[2:35] well I just don't want to be a fool
[2:37] don't be thinking for a fool I'd rather
[2:38] be taken for a fool than actually act
[2:40] like a fool
[2:45] I'd rather be taken for a foolish
[2:46] childish doesn't understand what's going
[2:48] on around him brother Chad just doesn't
[2:50] get it
[2:52] I'd rather be in that position than be
[2:55] the one who's wise and understand I see
[2:56] what you're doing you're manipulating
[2:57] here and I'm calling it out and I'm
[2:59] wrong half the time
[3:03] then you keep shame and foolishness upon
[3:05] yourself
[3:06] say God help us
[3:09] we got to recognize that these are the
[3:10] tactics of the enemy not tactics of my
[3:12] brother and sister
