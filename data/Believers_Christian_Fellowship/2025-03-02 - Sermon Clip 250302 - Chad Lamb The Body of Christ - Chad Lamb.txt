========================================

brother man begins to tell us about being in the spirit because I want that Spirit to fully possess me he says have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things that are in the world they go to their ball games they sporting events and their dances they enter into the spirit of it they don't sit there like a Wallflower old dried up sticks they enter right into the feeling of things and become a part of things but oh how they hate the Christians for getting into the spirit of God's word they call Fanatics and holy rollers there's nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that you can expect it knowing where it come from just go on and get in the spirit of worship remember remember starts to tell us and he has different places that he describes this but he says you know how they go to a ball game and and the ball game is no fun unless you get in the spirit of the game you can be the guy sitting there trying to read a newspaper and then you know everybody else and they look at you like you're the odd duck and what's wrong with you this is why I don't get invited over to watch football games nobody invites me over because they'll be watching the game I'll be like what's happening and I don't I mean I used to be way into it but that's completely gone out of my heart and my mind now and they'll be like this player this and he did this and he's drafted from this and he's going there and for me there's just an absolute I don't care amen not that you're evil if you care I'm not saying that but I'm no fun at a ball game cuz I'm not going to get into the spirit of it amen but if you're going to get into the spirit of it you've got to enter in yeah you've got to know who's playing on the field yeah amen like you can't enter in unless you know what's going on unless you you you've been involved unless you entered into what's happening and you know the rules of the game and you know you know the odds are the favors this and this and blah blah blah and this is an old rivalry that goes like 30 years and when you get into it it gets more exciting and more exciting and more exciting then all of a sudden you can have grown men amen they see a man carry a piece of leather with air in it across the line and grown men jump up in their plate of nachos and chips and everything goes flying all over the place I mean that doesn't happen every time you sit down to dinner you don't just jump up and throw your food everywhere what happened they got into the spirit amen and that Spirit took control yeah and began to express itself through their vocal cords and through their body if that can happen at a ball game can it happen about the word of God can we get so in the spirit can we get so engrossed in what God's done in this a that we read about it we study about it we talk about it we Fellowship about it we go to church we sing songs about it we worship about it until somebody will come to the pull pit and read a scripture and read a quote and say a statement and you'll jump out of your seat and say amen that's nothing but the truth if you had nachos and hot dogs in your lap guess where they would be amen because we've got to get into the spirit to let the spirit take control and let the spirit have expression and move every other Spirit out of the way I want to become a fanatic for one thing and that's for my bridegroom for this message of the hour which is the anointed word which is Christ himself coming to manifest what was the Word of Promise to Mary it was he himself coming to manifest himself what is this message friends it is he himself coming to manifest himself in the Virgin bride amen and it's not about me it's about him it's not my life it's his life it's not what I do it's what he's already done
