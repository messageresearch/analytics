[0:00] because he's predestinated a bride not
[0:02] to be deceived in this day
[0:04] then what has he done to to make sure
[0:08] that she will not be deceived remember
[0:10] the Holy Spirit you say will receive the
[0:13] spirit but the Holy Spirit was bound in
[0:15] these denominational Waters
[0:18] for nearly 2 000 years but is loosed
[0:20] again in the evening time by the evening
[0:22] time message the holy goes back in the
[0:24] people so what was holding the Holy
[0:26] Ghost what was barring or are locking or
[0:30] or chaining the Holy Ghost away from the
[0:32] people it was Creeds and dogmas
[0:36] it was the church systems
[0:38] and so what released the full measure of
[0:41] the Holy Ghost to come it was the full
[0:43] opening of the word because the spirit
[0:45] and the word or the self same thing it's
[0:47] the life of the word it's the spirit
[0:48] that makes the word live
[0:50] so when the word was released the spirit
[0:53] was released so what was holding the
[0:55] spirit it was when denominations were
[0:57] holding back the word and then holding
[0:59] back the word they held back the spirit
[1:03] so when God said when God the prophet
[1:06] says to us that God will have a bride
[1:09] shall not be deceived like evil she's
[1:11] predestinated not to be then you can say
[1:14] well I'm predestinated not to be God
[1:16] didn't just say you're predestinated not
[1:18] to be you're going to be fine but what
[1:19] God did is he released the word which
[1:21] released the life to ensure that you
[1:24] would not be deceived it's not that you
[1:26] can just say well I can't be deceived
[1:27] brother you can be absolutely deceived
[1:30] by your own self with that attitude
[1:33] that's a wrong attitude you're taking it
[1:36] on the statement like the statement is
[1:38] the only thing that God provided to keep
[1:39] you from deception no the statement
[1:41] shows that God's going to do something
[1:43] in this day that's going to prevent
[1:44] deception of the bride and what's he
[1:46] going to do is give his word back to his
[1:49] bride so that the wall is rebuilt and
[1:51] she by her own free moral agency can
[1:53] stay behind the wall
[1:54] [Applause]
[1:57] I mean we have you have people who will
[1:59] take a statement like that and act like
[2:01] they can say do believe anything they
[2:03] want to believe because I'm bride and I
[2:05] can't be deceived that is absolutely the
[2:08] wrong approach to God wrong approach to
[2:10] the word wrong approach to that promise
[2:15] that's like a Jew when Christ was here
[2:18] saying we're God's chosen people he'll
[2:19] never forsake us
[2:24] what you're saying was true
[2:26] they were God's chosen people and he
[2:28] wasn't going to forsake them
[2:30] they forsook him
[2:36] but the promise created the wrong
[2:37] attitude
[2:42] and we have a promise in this day but
[2:44] don't let the promise create the wrong
[2:45] attitude
[2:48] you can't feed on the things of the
[2:50] world we can't just willy-nilly accept
[2:53] anything everybody preaches and anything
[2:54] that's ever said and said well I'm bride
[2:56] I can't be deceived
[3:00] no God's brought an inoculation against
[3:03] deception and that's the revelation of
[3:05] his word in this hour
[3:07] in in the word came in fullness bringing
[3:12] the fullness of the spirit to make the
[3:14] word live to prevent
[3:16] the bride from deception
