[0:00] while joseph says i am joseph
[0:04] he is
[0:07] revealing himself
[0:10] but while he is revealing himself his
[0:13] family is revealed automatically
[0:16] because while he says i'm joseph they
[0:18] know who they are
[0:20] we're his brothers
[0:23] look for example joseph would go to any
[0:26] kind of an egyptian
[0:29] egyptian
[0:31] uh
[0:32] uh
[0:33] egyptian janitor in his palace or to any
[0:37] kind of an egyptian prince

[0:46] and the man said huh
[0:50] but he goes to his brothers
[0:53] and says i am joseph and the brother
[0:55] said and we are his brothers you get it
[0:59] why
[0:59] joseph
[1:01] the revelation of jesus christ is the
[1:03] revelation of his bride
[1:05] while he is revealing himself the bride
[1:07] knows that i'm part of it
[1:09] hey

[1:12] nobody in the garden of eden could tell
[1:14] if who she is eve could say mr elephant
[1:17] um can you tell me from where i come and
[1:19] he says the elephant said look uh it's
[1:21] it's wonderful here it's perfect but i
[1:23] don't know where i'm what i'm doing here
[1:24] honestly honestly just nice and the only
[1:27] one who could reveal to eve who she is
[1:29] was adam
[1:31] and the only one who can reveal to the
[1:33] bride who she is is the bright room
[1:35] while he is by he says who is this
[1:38] melchizedek
[1:40] the bride knows ho
[1:42] speaks of me
[1:44] amen amen who is this jesus oh i
[1:47] it tells me something it's the right
[1:49] amen can you say amen now joseph could
[1:52] just go even go to pharaoh pharaoh knew
[1:55] a lot of things
[1:56] pharaoh was strong in wikipedia honestly
[1:59] the whole day nothing nothing else to do
[2:00] just wikipedia just searching
[2:03] but joseph could come and say pharaoh
[2:08] joseph
[2:09] and pharah would have said
[2:11] so what
[2:13] he because he was not part of the family
[2:16] but when he said to his brothers
[2:18] he didn't say you are this you are this
[2:20] he says i am joseph
[2:22] and everybody in the family said oh can
[2:24] we a part of it
[2:26] can you say amen
[2:28] this is what this message does with us
[2:30] it shows us our true identity
[2:33] we are born with a purpose god sent us
[2:36] into this earth and this messenger took
[2:38] away our our spiritual amnesia
