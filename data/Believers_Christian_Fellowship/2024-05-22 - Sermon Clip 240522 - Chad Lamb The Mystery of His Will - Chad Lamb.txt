TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and God's purpose in his life was so powerful amen the revelation of God's will was so powerful that when they put him in prison and he couldn't get out and go visit churches anymore that he would sit there and start writing the Revelation that God put in his heart and mailing it out it couldn't be stopped amen there was something God was doing in his life but now we come to the bride God's got a purpose in you and I amen what do we need now we need the same thing the Apostle Paul had we need to go out to a desert place and separate from everybody until we come and encounter the pillar of fire and find out what the will of God is concerning us amen the prophet of God already found this place he went to the Wilderness Sabino Canyon amen he went to Sunset Mountain he already went to the Wilderness place and he got the Revelation amen and he brought the Revelation back amen that was wonderful but I need my desert experience I need my encounter with Christ I need to know not what the will of God is concerning the seventh age I need to know more than that you know the will of God concerning the bride amen and the adoption of the bride and the marriage of the lamb and the opening of the seals all those things are so instrumental but with all of that I must find what God's will is concerning me as an individual am I part of that I can say that's nothing but the truth brother benam was the seventh angel amen he was the he was the one he was the the voice of the seventh angel in Revelation 10:7 absolutely without question amen and he opened the seals the seals are now open we know all of that I you can agree with that all day long but you can still walk defeated in this life amen being train wrecked all the time being s railed and not pressing forward amen and you wonder sometimes why people amen they fall away to the side and they quit trying and quit pressing and get discouraged and want to quit and fall out I say what we need is the mystery of God's will for us because we's no way we're going to have it different than the prophet had it no way we're going to have a different Paul or the or the other churches there's no way we're going to walk through this life without somebody throwing some stones at us amen spitting on us and rejecting us or praising us and telling us we're the most wonderful thing ever we need something more than somebody else's revelation of the will of God I need the revelation of the will of God for me I believe all of it's true but I need to know it's true for me because if it's true for me then I'm his bride I can say in the end time God's calling out his bride that's the truth but I need to know he's calling out me in the end time he sent up Prophet to dress his bride in the Garment of the word I need to know that that prophet's dressing me he sent a prophet now amen to come and bring us to the invisible Union to the marriage I need to know that that prophet's Ministry is bringing me to the invisible Union
