========================================

let's read daniel chapter 12 verse 8. it says and i heard but i understood not then said i o my lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand amen this is the time for understanding friends we've come to the time of the unsealing of these words that were sealed up to daniel sealed up to the time of the end they've now been unsealed and the wicked will do wickedly and shall not understand but the wise shall understand let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this day and for this opportunity lord to look into your word no we don't take it lightly but we look seriously into these things this means more to us than this life that we're living in the natural lord because this is what's going to produce eternal life for us lord this is what's going to take us from this life to the next life i pray lord that you would just quicken your word to us anoint us lord with your word just take this vessel and speak your words across these lips of clay lord we ask that you take preeminence in this place we receive you lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated i also want to welcome back our our brothers who've been away ministering brother mike allen's been gone two sundays in a row so it's good to have him back he preached for brother steve hamilton two weeks ago which is where my mom attends down in springboro and then last sunday he was with his uncle jerry right in hamilton so it's good to have you guys back it's been a while and it's good to have brother benjamin sebolt and his wife back they were going last week in arkansas right for david morse yeah so it's good to have the brothers back and we miss you when you're gone but we understand you gotta go we support you when you go but we're glad to have you back it's nice to be here together and look at this seal together i've got quite a few slides i want to go through and i'm going to go through the first part very quickly because it's a lot of review and so we want to make sure that we stay we stay up as these things build these seals have a way of building and progressing and one moving to another so we want to stay with these as we go you see here i got the clicker i like the clicker in the breach he says now we go to break these seals you're going to see it goes plumb back in the scripture all the way back for each one of those seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right here in these seals every mystery of the bible lays in these seals and the seals cannot be broken until that time so this is this is why we've been focusing on this because he says it goes plumb back into the scriptures in every mystery of the bible lays in those seals so this is a very important subject when brother branham came to break this this wasn't just one of the things he ministered on this wasn't just one of the highlights of his ministry this was the highlight of his ministry amen unlocking this was the book of redemption to show redemption who who's included in redemption who's for redemption how he's been working out redemption amen and for you and i that are the redeemed this is the most important subject that we will ever face that we will ever come in contact with because if it wasn't for redemption we would be separated from god and we come from god and we're going back to god but the path back to god is in this book of redemption and it explains how we fell away and what happened in the beginning and what god's been doing to restore us back to bring us back into that perfect place that we fell from that's why this is an important book this isn't this isn't just we're not wasting our time going over this book and we're not wasting our time going through the seals because it's opening up all of redemption to us now i want to look at this drawing that we had drawn that this seven sealed scroll because i come to find out we had this drawn wrong a brother a brother approached me one of the ministering brothers here at the church with a quote and when i read this quote he was absolutely right and this explains a tremendous mystery so i want to go through this when we were first having this drawn up we pulled together all the quotes and brother branham explains about rolling it up and putting a c on the end and the end stuck out and they put another seal and when you would break the first seal you would unwind it and read it and then you break the next seal and unwind it so we pulled all those quotes together but but we had a question and i was talking to franco i said the question is i don't know if we should put the seventh seal on the outside or the inside because we know the seventh seal is a person amen it's jesus christ who comes and takes the books and loose it christ is the mystery of god revealed he's the open seal to us is the coming of the lord and so now does that have to happen first and you open the other seals or is it in the inside and brother branham starts talking about breaking them in chronological order so you break the first one you undo that then he comes to the second one and then the third one and so i said by default let's put it in the middle because we don't know it's just a picture right and now this brother gives me this quote and now i know why we were having such a problem trying to figure this out because here's the quote and the sixth seal says remember remember these hidden mysteries in the sixth seals together all together is one great big book just six scrolls rolled together not seven scrolls rolled together six scrolls rolled together and it unwinds the whole book of redemption that's how the whole earth was redeemed now let's look at this in the scriptures let's go to revelations chapter 6. we'll explain why this is a big deal to me it may not be a big deal to you but this is a big deal to me let's go to revelations chapter 6 and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder and one of the four beasts saying come and see and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer when he opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see and there was and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword that's the second seal now we come to the third seal that's what we're going to deal with this morning when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and behold and lo a black horse and he that sat on him and a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts saying a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou heard not the oil and the wine when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword with hunger with death and the beast of the earth so we see the same pattern goes all the way through chapter six and the then he opens the fifth seal and i saw souls under the altar and he describes that and then verse 12 and behold when he opened the sixth seal and though there was a great earthquake and the sun became black a sackcloth and hair and moon and so now every time he opens a seal there's a description and under this description is the symbolic meaning of what's in the seal what's written under that seal but if you turn over to chapter 8 verse 1 it says then when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour there's no symbol there's no riding there's nothing when he opens the seventh seal there's nothing he doesn't even open the seventh seal the same way that he opens the six because in revelations chapter 6 he opens all six so you have six open in the sixth chapter amen and god as always you're seeing six come all the way through there's six scrolls rolled together as the whole book of redemption it's the six seals that reveal the seventh seal and we went through that the six revealing the seventh all the way through you find six and the seventh is revealed in the six remember when jesus did his first miracle in cana he turned six pots of water into wine because it was the seventh seal that was doing the work in the sixth right and so we find out also that that when when boaz was measuring out barley amen because he made a covenant with ruth and he was measuring up barley he gives her six measures and there was no seventh because the seventh was the one dealing out the six amen we find pilate when he calls jesus to come forth he brings him forth in the sixth hour and he says behold thy king. see the king is proclaimed in the sixth hallelujah and so now now we find out also it was the sixth hour of the day that he came to the woman of samaria and sat upon the well and as he began to talk to her he began to realize she had six husbands amen and he was going to free her from his condition because he was the seventh amen so the seventh is never declared openly the seventh is the one doing the declaring so there's six measures there there's six days amen and the sixth deal is when the when the seventh seal is revealed it's in the sixth seal because we're we're in the days of the sixth seal now because the sixth seal began at the time of hitler brother branham says at world war ii the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet sound at the same time and the sixth trumpet amen is world war ii so we're in the days of the sixtieth and in the days of the sixth seal which happens to be the sixth thousandth year since the fall of man and man is number six it's all revealing the seventh so it is a six scrolls rolled together to make up this whole document the six scrolls rolled together it unwinds the whole book of redemption because the seventh is the one doing the unwinding this is all the way through the bible and you know that solomon we know was a perfect type of christ in the millennium before he fell and solomon is the son of david he takes the throne of david he brings israel into their golden age and it's a type of the church coming into the millennium and we know that solomon built himself a throne and if you go back and read solomon had a white throne solomon judged from a white throne because it said solomon built a throne made out of ivory what color is ivory it's white so solomon and sat upon a white throne amen and when he built the throne there was six steps on the throne because when you go up the six steps you come to solomon amen all through the bible is telling the same thing the six revealed the seventh when god made man in his image he made them male and female in the image of god he made them he made them on the sixth day the six days of creation declare the seventh the creator himself on the seventh he doesn't do anything he doesn't reveal anything he doesn't make anything he doesn't declare anything because he's been the one declaring it all along in the six days of creation declare him so that's why this is a big deal to me that we get this picture right amen so now we called up joel and and brother franco sent him the text and joel's a superhero because he fixed it in like one day and he comes back and he gave us a six scroll document there is a seventh seal absolutely and the seventh deal has to be broken but the seventh seal is the person brother branham said the seventh seal is jesus christ amen in christ is the whole book not a revelation he's not a revelation he is the revelation he's the one doing the revealing he's the whole thing that's the seventh seal hallelujah oh i love it when you find a mistake like that praise god now we climb up the six steps and come in contact with solomon himself so we're going to review a little bit the first seal the lamb came forth and went over to him that sat upon the throne that held the complete title deed of redemption and the lamb goes and takes the book out of the hand of him that sat upon the throne and and was took and opened the seals and opened the book what book the book of redemption brother branham said your bible is a book of redemption when he opened the seals he opened the book and that's why brother benham said my bible has become a new book to me hallelujah so now he tore the seals off and he opened the book you see the book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world this book the bible was really written before the foundation of the world and christ being the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the members of his bride their names were put in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world but it's been sealed up and now it's being revealed whose names were in there all about it what a great thing hallelujah so so this was written before the foundation of the world this was written before you had done good or evil before your great great great great grandfather your great great great great grandmother was ever on this earth before you ever did anything right or wrong before you made any choice at all this book was already written the bible was finished before the foundation of the world the the sixth scroll document of the book of redemption was already sealed up before before there was one molecule one atom before anything ever happened it was already done you and i aren't going to change what's written in that book it doesn't matter what the devil tries to tell you how much he tries to cause you to to be disrupted in your mind or or fall or fall lay a trap for you and you fall into it and try to tell you it was never for you it doesn't matter what he says it doesn't even so much matter what you do all that matters is what was written and recorded before the foundation of the world and that's what he's revealing now how's he doing it he's revealing the names that were in this book and he says how does he reveal him he reveals the mysteries that's calling the name and when you hear the mysteries revealed and it resonates in you he's calling your name not an intellectual understanding not being able to read through it but when he begins to break it down it becomes real to you it becomes personal to you and you find your identification here in the message then he's calling to you that means your name was written there before the foundation of the world what a great thing isaiah 46 verse 9 remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure i'm glad it was his pleasure to redeem me i'm glad it was his pleasure to call me and justify me call me out and choose me and glorify me because i'm already in a glorified condition because the word says so i'm not waiting i'm already glorified i'm just dropped down into this brother venom said this little hickey called time to measure out some things to accomplish something god's want to accomplish but if you get out of this hickey and get back into eternity i am already there glorified that's what the word says he says this here is just a negative reflecting the positive amen when he said the life you live here is just reflecting another life that's over there praise the lord he already has it all mapped out brothers and sisters and he's giving us his word to reveal who we are so we find out that there were two vines the war started in heaven and then came down to earth the second vine started in heaven it didn't start in the garden of eden amen the cane line actually did not start in the garden of eden it started in heaven when the falling away amen it's amazing that that we live in a day where we can see these things where there's been a prophet on the scene and a prophet doesn't just take the word and study it like a theologian studies it he takes the word and god begins to break visions and he starts to see it connected and interlaced and when he comes and he brings you the meaning of this word he brings it from the back part of god's mind he doesn't bring it from his mind he brings it from god's mind and that's why we don't want to trust intellectual study we don't even want to trust our own study in our own mind that means every time we come to this word and study this word we check it with the message why do we check it with the message because i don't want my mind i want the mind of god hallelujah i want to know what god thought about this bible verse i'm not so interested in what matthew henry said because matthew henry could be right 80 of the time he might be right 20 of the time and i'm not going to use my intellect to decide where he's white right and where he's wrong i'm going to take what came from the mind of god through a prophet because a prophet is just he is just a microphone and it's the spirit of god speaking through that microphone and i'm going to take that for the correct and perfect interpretation of the word anything besides that would lead you down the wrong path matthew henry was a wonderful man clarence larkin was a wonderful man uriah smith was a wonderful man mother venom talked about those and the contribution they made said many men probed at these things some of them did a pretty good job but nobody got it a hundred percent right so i'm not going to spend my time with something that's not a hundred percent accurate but i'm going to spend my time with that that was delivered by the mind of god through a prophetic ministry given to us in the last day to bring us into that full understanding so that we can be rapture ready pure white lily white washed by the water of the word and standing ready for the rapture we're a privileged people we're a blessed people we're the most blessed people that have ever walked the face of this earth i'd be rather be standing here now i'd rather be here now this moment than be walking with abraham because abraham was looking for a city amen whose builder and maker was god and we're part of that city and we're seeing the city begin to materialize we're going to be the ones who slip from this dimension to that hallelujah prophet of god says in the fourth seal look what this is all coming to what is it it's going right back the way it did it started in heaven it's coming to the end time battle the first thing in heaven was a battle lucifer was kicked out and come to the earth then he polluted eden then he's been polluting ever since and now from the battle in heaven it's come to the battle on earth and it is to be finished on earth at the time in the battle called armageddon now anyone knows that the battle started in heaven so they kicked them out michael and his angels overthrew them just run out and when they did dropped right down in eden and here started the battle down here god had his children are fortified up by his word and eve stuck her neck out said i believe you're right maybe and there it went and it's been ever since so what caused what caused the fall in the garden of eden it was unbelief or disbelief of god's word eve's sin was not adultery that was the attribute of sin but sin was unbelief and brother bam starts talking about how satan had had taken his tail and gathered a third of the angels brother brandon said not his physical tale but the tale that he told amen the lie that he weaved together what was it he brought them to unbelief in the word of god so the same thing that happened in heaven happened in eden is the same thing that's happening today it's the same thing again and again and again it just keeps rolling down and unfolding and the further it goes the more it unfolds and the more it unfolds and the more it unfolds and every time you see the cycle of redemption repeating it's more clear and more clear and more clear hallelujah this is not a news story friends this is the old story being told over and over and over and over again hallelujah brother branham said something that's very interesting in the seals i just feel to go into it but i'm not prepared i don't have notes on it i i'm just going to go off the cuff but you can find this in the seals i can't remember even which one but just read it it's all good you'll find something but brother branham said when when the woman first fell when she fell uh by disbelieving the word then the promise was that the word would come again her seed which would be the manifested word and flash would come again and reverse what was done wrong and so now there's a prophecy that says thy seed shall bruise his head and that seed was going to be a physical creation of god it was going to be god in human flesh and that was the seed of the woman and that seed was the word made manifest and when the word comes full fully into manifest it was to bring redemption amen so that's what they were looking for from that promise and he said he built it through the patriarchs he built it through the kings he built it through the prophets and the psalms he built it all the way till finally the head came and jesus christ the man was standing there the word he said but when he came they rejected the word and stuck with the substitutes because while he was building back to the full measure of the word he allowed a substitute offering to take the place so that you could have a goat or an ox or a lamb or turtle doves or something take the place for your sin and that innocent blood being shed for you god would allow that as a substitute for you that but it's supposed to bring you into the full word when the lamb of god would come but when the lamb of god came they rejected the seed of the woman because they wanted their substitute religion they got used to it they got tied down to their own carnal understanding of what was happening in the law and they wanted it and they didn't want him and so the lamb was slain and and then those who held true to the word and never deviated from the revelation for their day they were redeemed they were resurrected they were caught up with him into heaven and then he starts to cycle over again now he's going to deal with the gentiles this is all according to his plan but he said brother bam said then there's another promise amen there's another promise and that promise is the word would come back again he told the woman i see that was a promise of the word amen coming back but when when when the pentecostal church began to fall there was a promise of the word coming back again and he said now at the opening of the seals amen he's come back in full measure of his word what is it it's the word that has come back it was the word that was made flesh in jesus christ and they rejected the word and took the substitutes and now while he's building this this next masterpiece the bride tree while he's been working on that he's allowed a substitute of denominationalism he's worked with it and he's worked in it and he's had a covering for blood for those that were genuine and real and held to the truth and he's allowed the substitute religion of denominationalism but now with the opening of the seals when the word comes back again now they wanted the denominationalism the substitute they didn't want him the cycle keeps repeating over and over and over again and now there's no salvation in the nominational system amen there is this just as much as when jesus came amen there was no longer salvation in the blood of bulls and goats anymore but after he came it was a dispensational change brother branham said john the baptist was there standing between two dispensations the old dispensation of the law and the new dispensation of grace and brother branham comes he's another john the baptist he's another forerunner he comes and he's standing between two dispensations the old dispensation of the church system and the new dispensation of the word and the word only just like john the baptist bridged the gap brother branham bridged the gap and the true seed crossed and went over into the pure word but the false vine stayed with the denominational system because when he came they didn't want him they fell in love with the system and if you had known moses you would know me if you had known the church age messenger you would know me if you had known the true revelation coming down through each age you would know me but they fell in love with the system they built and didn't love the word hallelujah you see the cycle friends keeps repeating over and over and over again so this is war and the seals reveal the battle plan this book there's two stories that run through the theme of this book there's two stories there's a love story for god and his elect seed and there's a war story between the false vine and the true vine and this book is the record of those two stories that are going on simultaneously why is it that every movie that's successful and every book that's successful does the same thing they intertwine a story of war and battle with a love story they're following the pattern if you want to be successful follow the pattern that will always sell tickets that will always be successful because when you take a love story of redemption and getting the the poor humble woman who's been destitute and neglected and forsaken and the king comes in and he rescues her and he fights off the enemy and evil's defeated and good wins that'll always sell tickets in the box office why because the knowledge of that is locked in the human heart because that's the original story now hollywood's making money by perverting the original story but there's two stories running through that a love story amen is running through that the story of redemption of the loved one of god and the story of war the battle between false vine and the true vine so he comes out first as a white horse rider in the first seal and he has a bow but no arrows he receives a crown and he comes forth to conquer let's read that in revelations chapter 6 keep revelation chapter 6 open for a few minutes i'm trying so bad to hurry i really want to get through the third seal but if not we'll pick it up wednesday revelation chapter 6 verse 1 and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and i saw him behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer so the purpose of the white horse rider is to conquer but he comes with a bow with no arrows and he doesn't have a crown how's he going to conquer he can only conquer through deception not by force he's come seemingly innocent brother brenham said he seems to be innocent because he he can't hurt you right he has no authority over you doesn't have a crown he has no arrows he cannot do you any harm so he comes white just like christ comes on a white horse and this is deception brother branham said who is that white horse rider you're not blind you see who it is it's that antichrist that deceitful spirit that's gone now and crept in so he comes in he comes in innocent he comes in harmless he comes in with no authority but the purpose that he comes is to conquer that's the deceptive part of it because it looks like it can't hurt you it looks like this little compromise can't be hurtful can't be painful since the white horse rider went out he's mighty in his conquering power you want me to tell you who he is he's the antichrist that's exactly what he is now because you see jesus said that the two would be so close together until it would deceive the very elect the bride if it was possible antichrist is the antichrist spirit so now he comes as the antichrist but he's coming so close to deceive the elect if it was possible not a million miles away but so close that it would deceive you and i if it was possible so when we're watching for this white horse i gotta we've been through this but i just can't stress it enough we're not looking for the white horse out there in the world we're not trying to be wary that we don't go uh we don't go to the movie theaters and we don't go down to the bar that's not where the white horse is working because that's not deception for the bride he's not deceiving you with alcohol drugs prostitution gambling that's not the deception there's no deception there but the deception is on a white horse amen purity righteousness just a slight deviation from the word just something slightly different than the scriptures just something slightly different than the message that's the only way that he could deceive the bride if it were possible it's got to be that close why because he's vying for the same throne that god's on you got to realize the the lucifer when the war broke out in heaven lucifer wasn't looking for his own throne he wasn't trying to build a kingdom amen he was trying to take the kingdom we've got that so he's not trying to build a serpent kingdom or a cain kingdom he has no interest in those things amen he is trying to usurp god's throne he's trying to take god's kingdom and where is god's throne it's in the human heart of those that are redeemed that's where he's trying to place his seat that's where he's trying to sit as a king he's trying to come on god's throne which is in the bride so where is the white horse going to ride he's going to try to ride in the bride that's why it comes back to judging your own life where was the deception back in the church ages when the white horse began to rise it came right into the true church it came right into that church that paul had established where he had written epistles amen all the way to all of these churches it was that church that he came in and that's where he began to conquer and begin his deception he didn't come through paganism amen he didn't come through through false false religions he didn't come the white horse when he came he came into the true church that paul established if he's going to come today where is he going to come he's not going to come to pentecostalism or the baptist he's going to come amen to the true church that was reestablished on paul's teaching that's where he's going to try to come in our day that's why we've got to constantly watching for him it's easy to stop the white horse easy to stop the white horse because he has no crown he has no authority over you and he has no arrows he can do nothing to you all you have to say is boo back resist the devil and he shall flee with you how do you resist him with the pure word amen with the restored faith of the fathers with the teaching back to what the apostles taught and just preach the word and he has to flee he's easy to stop as a white horse it's harder later white horses compromise slight change of the word deception now what was he given then first he had a bow but he didn't have any arrows but now he's got a mighty sword in his hand he can do something now then he jumps off his white horse the white horse rides on out now this is very important we realize this and just in case you thought that that that we were hijacking what was meant for the church ages the white horse we know that there was a there there was a time that brother branham takes these four horse riders and he lays them over the church ages and he shows us it rode here and it rode there and it changed and it's the same writer all the time just changing his power or changing his tactic or method of operation and so the antichrist gets off a white horse and gets on a red gets off a red and gets on a black gets off a black and gets off a pail but when he gets off the white and gets on the red the white horse rides on out it doesn't stop riding friends he's still using that power to deceive it's still coming in through the church ages that doesn't stop just because now he moved through the church ages that white horse rides on out it's riding today but god sent the lion to combat that when the enemy comes in like a flood the lord will raise the standard against it and he raised the lion which was the pure word which is christ is the teachings of paul amen when they roared out like a lion and when they just took the word amen nothing could stand against that word i'm going to try to just move quickly we've been through this in detail the red horse you find that in revelation chapter 6 verse 3 when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword the red horse takes peace causes war and killing and brother branham says in several places starts a political war in the church has anybody ever seen that starts a political war in the church amen he's going to try where is he coming to the church not the false behind the true vine and he brings political war in the church starts to divide brethren against brethren and so they start to take the sword and fight one another it's not supposed to be that way the second seal he says now notice that they should kill one another they should kill each other his bow had no arrows at first but his great sword did he done his killing later and changed from white horse to red horse the same exactly devil with the sword what did jesus say they that take the sword will perish by it don't fight back jesus that night he said that and peter took his sword and just do like he did just go ahead now now remember he's got a sword he's going forth a sword in his hand riding red horse wading through the blood of everybody that disagrees with him how many times have you killed somebody because they disagreed with you amen how many times because they didn't follow the doctrine you followed or see it the way you saw it or didn't believe in the standard you believed in how many times did you take the sword and kill your brother hallelujah this is coming right here not looking out there i'm looking right here for the for the devil the battle is right here remember there's two vines that that coming from the from the from the battle in heaven all the way through to be destroyed in the end of the book of revelations and those battles are entered those vines are intertwined and they're intertwined in you and i with the outside man and the inside man you don't have to look very far amen you don't have to look very far to find trouble in the church you can find it right here that's the man that has to be killed that's why paul say i die daily he's trying to keep that man dead because that's where satan's trying to come in and work amen he's got a sword he's going forth with a sword in his hand riding a red horse wading through the blood of everybody that disagrees with him now do you understand it how many understands what the seal is now all right what did jesus say they that take the sword will perish by the sword is that right so how many understands now how many understands what the seal is now don't fight back so there's an anointing that comes to combat this is war combat so the anointing that comes to combat this is the ox anointing and the ox anointing is a burden-bearing beast he bears down under the load and he's a beast of sacrifice now i want you to notice he doesn't fight back you can put more on him and more on him and more on him and he'll just bear the load and bear the load and bear the load and you can even come and make him a sacrifice upon your altar and he'll lay down his life willingly but there's one thing about the ox the ox is very strong you will not get the ox to compromise he won't give in for peace he won't give in for peace he won't give in and because he won't give in he won't have peace because you can compromise and give in to have peace but the ox doesn't compromise the ox is strong enough to stay with his commitment to the word no matter what you do to me no matter how much you pile on me whether or not you kill me i will not change from the my confession in the word the ox is strong enough to take it brother madam said now the second beast that the antichrist sent out was a red beast which he rode on was to take peace from the earth in war now the second one that went to combat him was the ox beast the ox means labor a beast of burden and another thing the ox is also a beast of sacrifice they give their lives just as freely as they could give them in the dark ages a thousand years there the catholicism controlled the world and they just went right in yes or no they didn't mind dying if it was death that's all right they went and died anyhow if to stand on the word of god if it means somebody will attack your character if it means somebody will speak evil against you if it means somebody will go around the church and start gathering allies together to wage a war against you because they disagree with what you're saying they disagree with your stand then you don't fight back because you can give your life just as freely and willingly what are you giving it for you're giving it for the word hallelujah you just give up your life it doesn't matter don't compromise but just give up your life we're going to show this we're going to show this in the life of jesus christ here shortly so all three of these beasts the black horse this is the third seal we're finally coming to now when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and i beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou heard not the oil and the wine brother branham says right at the beginning of the seals write in this opening prayer he says in this great hour that we're now living and we see yearly it gets darker and darker to the world and the coming of the lord gets brighter and brighter as he reveals himself in his word and in his manifestation that right there is the third seal so lock in on that that's the third seal he says it right in his opening comments it's so miraculous how many times right in his opening comments right is closing he tells you what the whole seal means to you the word the hour that we're living in is getting darker and darker to the world but the coming of the lord gets brighter and brighter as he reveals himself now we'll study this as we go and you'll see how true that statement is the sixth seal he says perfect just exactly oh i like to make the scripture answer itself don't you the holy spirit wrote it all but he's able to reveal it now let's notice the third seal now this is famine and he takes that out of matthew 24 when they ask him when what shall be the sign of the end and when shall these things come to pass and he starts to break down the seals in matthew 24 and when he gets to the third seal he says they'll be famine and brother branham picks that out of there and says see now this is famine amos 8 11 says behold the days come saith the lord god that i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst of water but of hearing the words of the lord i want you to take special note because this is going to become important as we study this it says in amos there's going to come a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor thirst for water but of hearing the words of the lord so this is a terrible famine a famine where you don't get hungry because you don't have food to eat a famine be where you spiritually wither away because you don't have the word you don't have the hearing of the word so spiritually you wither away in the spiritual famine but i want you to take special note who sent the famine is really important behold the days come saith the lord god that i will send a famine in the land remember when he starts talking about in the palmer worm the kangaroo and the caterpillar and the locust and i mean i have those in order but that's i think that's the right for so he starts talking about them and how they're going to go down and eat this down and how he's going to restore all that they ate but when he refers to them he says the palmer and the kangaroo and the caterpillar locust mine great army that i send don't think god's not in control of all of this don't think he doesn't have the whole thing in his hand when he had to deceive ahab to go up into battle to make his word work he sent a lying spirit don't forget he asked god asked who will go amen who will go and deceive them that they come up amen and unlying spirit said micaiah he unveiled the whole thing he said god sent a lying spirit who sent the famine i send the famine we can't we can't think as redeemed children of god that the devil has anything to do with this we can't think that he's controlling the situations that are going on in our lives that somehow if there's a if there's four that there's four critters that are going to eat the bride tree down to nothing those four things were sent by god to eat it down to nothing that wasn't the devil's work that was god's will [Music] and there's going to come a famine in the land where there's going to be a want for hearing the word of god it wasn't because the devil brought a famine in the land god sent a famine in the land this is revealed this is revealed in this seal let's go back to revelations chapter 6 verse 5. i'm going to get a little head of schedule but but just bear with me and when he had opened the third seal verse 5 chapter 6 i heard the third beast say come and see and behold a low a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and the wine so we find out that this is going to be spiritual famine there's a balance in his hand he's measuring out the weed wheat and the barley we're going to get to that in a minute but notice in verse 6 i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts this is the work of the devil with the the with the balance in his hand it's the work of the devil to measure out wheat for a penny barley for a penny it's the work of the devil but it's the it's a voice from the middle of the four beasts that say you can measure out you can measure out wheat for a penny and barley for a penny but don't touch the oil and wine and brother brennaman the seal says that was the lamb that cried out from the midst of the four beasts the lamb said so who's in control of this famine who's in control of the dark ages who's in control of the black horse what a revelations laying right here in the seals that god has everything under control it's all working according to his plan nothing's out of kilter everything's ticking just right on time there's nothing happens in the life of a believer but first it has to come across god's desk for approval it was it was god who suggested job to the devil to be tempted it was god who set the limits of his temptation it was god who moved back the barriers every time satan came satan couldn't do anything without permission and that's revealed in the seal who's controlling the dark ages who's controlling the measure by which the catholic church can strip the world amen it's the lamb who's controlling it he's the one who says a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny but he also says see thou that thy you don't touch the oil and the wine the oil and wine wasn't even for sale comes without price they can't put a price on the oil and the wine hallelujah one of the great revelations under the third seal is that the lamb is in control he's absolutely in control that's why we get down and get depressed and get angry and get upset about life circumstances what i have and what i don't have and what's happened to me and the people who's mistreated me amen don't don't you forget that the holocaust was the tender hand of jehovah and the holocaust is the sixth seal and the sixth seal was meant to bring the 144 thousand back into position so that they can receive the christ the lamb the messiah the tender hand of jehovah would allow a holocaust to bring redemption back to israel so that they could be blessed in their land so that they could receive their two witnesses under the seventh trumpet so that they could come back into redemption you can't shake your fist and say why or the devil oh the devil was the instrument god used amen just like he sent nebuchadnezzar to destroy the temple to destroy jerusalem he said nebuchadnezzar my servant nebuchadnezzar was not satan's servant nebuchadnezzar was god's servant if you went through a holocaust in your life then the reason was he had mercy on you because he's driving you to your homeland he's driving you to the word brother branham said i've had this tension all my life i used to think this tension was a terrible thing you know this tension is what would cause his reoccurring stomach condition he suffered with it since he was a child he talks about it in the message on the wings of a snow white dove he goes in detail how he suffered and suffered and suffered so this tension i thought it was a bad thing but because i come and realize this tension is a good thing he said it was this tension that drove me to jesus christ and i got to thinking without this tension where would i be see friends nothing's out of kilter with god if you were neglected if you were abused if you were mistreated if people lied about you and told wrong about you if you lost jobs and went into bankruptcy and all of these things that happen god works it all to bring you here down you're here now hearing the word of god by his tender hand that has driven you to this place what would have happened if everything would have been easy there had been no trial that you would never have come into desperation because you needed god where would you be now you have no idea we always think oh if life would just be easy and everything would work out i would serve god with all my heart no you wouldn't proverbs says he says give me neither riches nor poverty because i might be rich and i might forget you or i might be poor and steal and blaspheme your name give me neither riches nor poverty but keep me somewhere in the middle i don't want to fall either way you think rich's riches wouldn't do you one ounce of good. unless he's gifted you to take care of it riches wouldn't do you one bit of good what you need is exactly what you've had those things that you wonder about in your life why did this happen why did i lose this family member why did this circumstance happen why couldn't that have been prevented it was needful to bring you here and if you like where you're at thank god for the trials there's going to come a time that 144 000 are going to be awakened to what god had been doing the trumpets are going to reveal to them what the seals revealed to us and the seals revealed to us the plan of redemption what god's been doing through all these church ages to bring us here to reveal himself to us and the trumpets are going to be those two prophets in revelations 11 are going to teach them what's been happening all down through to bring them to the land to bring them to the feast of atonement to bring them to messiah and they're going to look back and say thank god amen that would end the need for a whole bunch of counseling if we would just look back on our life and thank god thank you god whatever i needed you did if i needed spank there corrected there whatever i needed if i was going the wrong way and you had to flatten me to bring me back over here i say thank you lord you know what's best you know what i needed there was no time in my life that i was not a redeemed son of god why because the book was sealed before the foundation of the world there was never a question of whether or not you would be redeemed you were always a redeemed son of god you just had to come to the revelation of it at some point and the seed in you had to be quickened to life but the seed was already there that seed was there before the book was written not in your tabernacle of flesh but in god and that seed come out predestinated to be in your tabernacle of flesh and that seed was already redeemed because that seed was never lost in the first place that's why brother branham said when you come back to this pure virgin word it brings you back to your virgin condition you've never sinned in the first place it drops it in the blood of the the blood of the clorox bleach and then drops into there and sends it right back to the originator of sin which is satan himself and then he'll stand the judgment for all the sin of the world he's going to be judged for my sin not me because my sin by confession in the blood and believing the word and receiving it for my day that takes my sin and puts it right back to the originator of sin which is lucifer himself it's not on my record it's not on me it's on him because in me me the me that's down on the inside the sea gene of god that's been quick and the life that me was in god before the foundation of the world and by receiving the pure word of god puts me back in my previous condition in my soul which is 100 sinless you are just as righteous as god is right so the question is how righteous is god [Laughter] oh see what the seals mean to us friends it's everything we have to recognize who we are in our position and where we are if we just take away the whole fear of sin then sin loses its hold but if you're constantly afraid of falling and not being saved and not making the rapture then your mind is going to become bound with all these fears and you're going to fall right into the trap you're afraid of the devil is is wrapping your mind and fears and anxiety because i'm not going to make it what if i'm not in the right condition what if i don't go in the rapture whether you make it in the rapture or not was predetermined friends your do's and don'ts are not going to put you in the rapture if you're an attribute of god which is he calling back in the rapture he you were in him before the foundation of the world and that sinless spotless pure as righteous as god is righteous you can no more be lost and god can be lost so just put it back on lucifer and forget about it and walk as a redeemed son of god sanctified by the word cleansed by the blood forget about the do's and don'ts and when you set your course amen and your affections on things that are above and forget about all those things they're just going to fall away friends but if you're constantly worried about falling you're going to constantly be falling brother branham said that this this bleach of the blood of jesus christ will take the sins so far away from the believer back to its original source which is one who deceived the angels in heaven amen back to that original place until you have no more consciousness of sin truth is i didn't sin now this body that i live in that's controlled by a human spirit that thing has sinned a whole bunch but that seed of life down on the inside that's been quickened by the new birth that thing has never sinned once and he cannot sin for his seed remaineth in him that seed can't sin that body you live in it can sin all the time but when that seeds quicken the life now the life that's in that seed is supposed to control your body not your human spirit not your human mind but the life that's inside that quickened by the holy ghost that holy ghost life is supposed to control the body hallelujah how do i get that to happen get more of the word we're going to see that in a minute spiritual food and due season now we're going to type that with the spiritual drought of today now we all know we are very aware that there is a great spiritual drought in the land today spiritually speaking you know that was predicted by the prophets just before the second coming of christ would be said there will come a famine in the land and it won't be for bread alone but for the hearing of the word of god and that day is now hearing the true word of god now this types the natural drought with the spiritual drought and so so we'll get to a few more quotes here because they're really important the third seal i put the paragraph numbers in here because if you want to use the black seal book i was going to read out of them but so many people have so many different versions of the seal book that that half our crowd was getting lost so i put the paragraph number so if you're in the new seal book this is the paragraph 300. thank you lord oh my i'm so glad yes sir all right it's been his grace that's all all right it's a midnight time do you understand that now and here he is charging for the kind of life that he that's his that's this barley and stuff natural it wasn't spiritual now it was barley see and barley bread and wheat bread he was charging for that kind of life that he was giving to his subjects bringing the wealth of the world to himself into the church itself and he's still writing oh sure he is yes sir still riding so he says this this third this third seal this black horse he's charging for the the wheat and for the barley for the kind of natural life he's giving them and brother rams types that with the catholic church selling novenas and penances and and and uh services masses for purgatory and all of this where they started charging for this he said what's he doing he's gathering the wealth of the world into himself the prophet of god says no catholic country is self-sustaining he said because the catholic has went in there and stripped all their resources out what's he doing he's gathering all the wealth of the world why because he's going to bring back his kingdom friends and he's gathering under the black horse he's gathering all the wealth of the world he's still gathering the wealth of the world how by handing out natural food natural life natural things not spiritual things see you've got to pay for the natural things but the spiritual things come without price amen he was started writing him in the time of the dark ages that's what the dark horse represents the dark ages for it was a time of midnight to the true believers that was left so we want to we want to get into here and see this black horse rider for now for ourselves the black horse rider is spiritual famine in its dark ages you see if you follow the progression through he comes in as deception a slight deviation a slight compromise something that seems to be good but is not and he comes in and slips in and after he comes in you yourself take a crown and put a crown on his head because it was the early church that crowned the crown this antichrist and you crown him and then he takes a sword and then you begin to fight for your compromise defend your actions and start war and fighting and it brings it takes away even your own peace you start even warring within yourself sometimes your battle is not even outside of yourself sometimes there's a compromise that you're living with and in your mind you're constantly reasoning and you're trying to stop the still small voice that keeps rising up to say is that exactly right is that what the prophet said and you're at war in yourself it takes your peace away there's no more peace in your heart because you're living in compromise and you know it and as he moves through from from deception coming into getting a crown to taking a sword and taking away peace then he comes to the black horse and he brings you into spiritual famine now every every false denomination every false doctrine has followed the same path all the way through you come in from deception you move into war taking away peace splitting brotherhood splitting churches all kinds of nonsense that would happen that never should be in the church of god and then it brings you into spiritual famine to where now you don't even have the spiritual life now we're living living dry all dried up and just living on a glare from a previous age no fresh manna no fresh life amen and those who have the false teaching they keep selling the same old natural bread but he said don't touch the oil and the wine so the goal is to bring you into spiritual famine because famine will bring death remember he doesn't want to stay on on on the first three horses the antichrist goal is to get to the pale horse it's been his goal from when he started when he comes to you with that little bit of compromise that that just that little bit of texting with a guy who's not a believer or flirting with a girl who's not a believer that little bit of it's innocent it's not going to hurt anything his whole purpose is to bring you from there and then you start the relationship now you put a crown on his head now you're fighting mom and dad now you're fighting other people who are warning you against this relationship now you're fighting because you're unequally yoked you're off the word and now you're fighting with people and after you fight you go into the marriage and you move along and you'll come right into spiritual famine you will move right into your spiritual dark ages amen you might have a house and a car and everything else going fine just like the world the world gets more glittery and more glittery and more glittery and getting darker and darker and darker they have no natural light so they come up with all kinds of led light cfl light look at all the lights they're producing because they don't have any natural light so they keep producing more advanced light more advanced light and it's all darkness friends the compromise moves through and it brings you to spiritual famine and now you're dried up spiritually you're anemic you're poor miserable blind and naked hallelujah but god has a beast to combat that the fifth seal says now the third beast that went out from the devil was that black horse sea now the third beast that went out power from god to combat him to combat the powers of the black horse was a man cunning smart with the wisdom of god now we've got to be careful that that we get this right that he's bringing this anointing of a man to combat the dark ages and we see in the church ages how he did this by inspiring luther and wesley and all the men that come through those reformation revivals they started catching the word amen the word was being printed in their language they were reading it they were catching inspiration but you have to understand it's wisdom from god not man's wisdom god symbolizes it by a man because when you look at the beast as you move each beast has a characteristic and he's capitalizing on the characteristic and the lion has a characteristic of being noble and a king and strong and powerful and able to devour all of its enemies that's what the pure word will do but then he takes the beast of an ox and he shows that now he's got a sacrificial animal that can bear burns that can bear under a load that can sacrifice itself for the word now he comes to the beast of a man because a man is superior to all these other beasts and his intellects in his wisdom and this is not a man's wisdom this is god's wisdom be careful god's not ever telling us go to intellectual understanding he's typing it he's showing the strength of the man as his intellect bill graham says so here in the next quote now the next thing went out to combat that was the beast was the face of a man smart educated shrewd fine anointed with the spirit of that day you notice it now he went to combat him with the cunningness of god's wisdom with him he knew how to take that word and defeat that black horse he knew how to preach against the bread and the barley he knew how to take the oil and the wine and he knew how to to present it so that it would free people from spiritual famine and the physio says now notice the beast come to combat it now was man and we all know that this beast of man this power of man is his intellectuals now oil typifies spirit and wine symbolizes stimulation of revelation remember it was the lamb who said a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley but see thou touch not the oil and the wine so so yes you're going to do this yes it's permitted but you're not going to touch the oil and the wine so the oil in the wine is what is what is going to anoint the man amen he said now oil typify spirit and wine symbolizes stimulation of revelation boy i like to run all over the place it's a wonder i didn't wake up the neighborhood when the lord showed me that stimulation of revelation oil and wine and the bible's associated together always i got the concordance and looked and there's a string of them like that where wine and oil goes together all the time when the truth of a promised word of god has been truly revealed to his saints that's filled with oil they all get stimulated [Music] let's read that again when the truth a be promised word of god like the opening of the seven seals like the mighty angel coming down like the days of the voice of the seventh angel like malachi 4 what like revelations 10 8-11 when the truth of that of the word of god has been truly revealed to his saints that's filled with oil they all get stimulated wine is a stimulation glory i feel it right now amen stimulated with joy shouts amen and when when and wine does upon a natural man because when the revelation has been given of truth of god and the true believer filled with oil and the revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that it makes him behave himself unnormal how many likes to get a little unnormal once in a while hallelujah you know it's just why this is where pentecostalism failed amen in the pentecostal revival i don't mean the original pentecost that fell but i mean the pentecostal revival fell because they put everything in the reaction of stimulation right so the the stimulation by wine it causes dancing and shouting and joy and ecstatic worship and all of these things come out of it and then they begin to think that was what was important amen and they'd left off amen what brought what brought about the stimulation which was the revelation of the word so they left off the revelation of the word and kept trying to keep the things stimulated by the outward works of a drunken man but what are they drunk on they were drunk on emotionalism that's why that's why amen we don't have to we don't have to manufacture and pump up and run the aisles during the song service and shout and holler to feel like we've had something from god that's why a church amen a church under the revelation of the word they'll sit here and as they see that word and it's breaking right before their eyes they'll say amen hallelujah praise god what is it it's stimulation of revelation friends that's what caused the outpouring of the stimulation of revelation on azusa street they saw the promise in the word of gifts come back into the church and that's what stimulated them it was the promised word coming back as what was stimulating them but then when it was time for more promised word all they wanted was the stimulation with no wine a manufactured stimulation but when you get so excited about the word in this day when you see redemption you start to catch what the prophet's telling us it brings an absolute stimulation that brings joy unspeakable and full of glory when you see your position in him before the foundation of the world and that you're never never never never going to be lost it brings such a joy of stimulation you could tap your foot just a little bit raise your hand say amen just a little bit why it's not stimulation with no wine it's the wine that's bringing the stimulation hallelujah the revealed word hallelujah so the man we see has oil the holy spirit whine the stimulation of revelation and spiritual understanding by revelation see friends daniel said the wicked will not understand the whole idea of you don't have to understand is true you don't have to have an intellectual understanding you have to believe but how can you believe what you don't see like i could tell you that i've got a new doctrine i got a revelation from the lord and and i found this scrap scripture in uh this scripture in the bible and i got it wrote down on here and it is absolutely pure it's absolutely perfect now you don't need to understand it you just need to believe it do you all believe it you have to see it to believe it it's got to be revealed to you and it's going to be revealed to you under teaching under the word under the anointing under the oil anointing is going to bring stimulation of revelation you can't just say you don't have to understand it just believe it you've got to see it man you've got to actually have something explained or something quickened or some word brother branham comes and he's teaching he's teaching he's never saying just believe he is saying just believe but not like we think he's saying just believe he's saying you don't have to figure it out you don't have to say well how does that work and i don't have all the details just right this has to add to that you don't have to add it all up you don't have to add it all up you don't have to make the equation come out just right but once he shows it to you you can believe it because you see it's true you've got a witness in the heart you don't have to have intellectual understanding but you have to base your faith on something and your faith is based on the word of god and god wants you to understand he absolutely wants you to understand with the wisdom of god not with man's intellectual understanding but with the wisdom and understanding that comes by revelation but he absolutely wants you to understand he went through a lot of effort for us not to need to understand daniel he says the wicked shall not understand we read this at the beginning shall not understand he said but but the wise will understand i said god make me wise give me stimulation by revelation lord reveal your word to me let me see it god like i've never seen it before oh god stimulate me by a revelation of your word amen praise god that's what makes us strong that's what that's what combats the enemy is when we know what word we're standing on the third seal so now i've got another thing here i want you to notice it was not one of the four beasts that said don't touch the oil and the wine did you notice that the four beasts had been talking but watch let me just read out there just a little bit a measure of a penny for a wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the wine and the oil now look here and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts what was it the lamb amen it wasn't the four beasts the lamb said it why he's going to take his own that belongs to him he's redeemed it see don't you touch that oil no sir not the four beasts but the lamb was the one who said it now oh my the lamb not the four beasts didn't announce this the lamb said itself when the four bees said come and see and they went and they seen it like that and he said a measure of wheat for a penny see much like this and so much barley but then the lamb cried out right among them and said but don't hurt the wine and the oil because the oil and the wine is essential for overcoming the black horse rider you're not going to overcome him without the oil and wine what was it that woke you out of spiritual family what was it that brought you out of your dark ages we come into the world darkened dead into sin under a cloud of darkness not understanding anything but there come a time there was an awakening in our life amen and what was it it was the oil and the wine that's why he said don't touch the old and the wine because the only thing that'll break the power of the black horse when he brings you into spiritual famine in the dark ages the only thing that will break that is oil and wine that's why friends when you find somebody steeped in a denominational system or trapped in darkness of a false doctrine it doesn't do you any good to fight with them it doesn't do you any good to argue or tell them how bad they are all you got to do is give them a little wine amen just give them a little revelation that god's revealing to you share with them something that's stimulating you and see if they can get stimulated don't argue about how wrong the system is don't go back and show them the origin of it and where it fell away blah blah blah blah blah they don't need that they need the stimulation they need the oil and the wine and there you are full of oil full of new wine then you just try to give them a little bit of that wine and see if they're thirsty because if if god brings them oil and wine they'll come right out of that black horse system doesn't do any good to debate intellectual debate isn't going to do you one ounce of good going tis for tad on the doctrines that's not going to do you one bit of good the only thing that will bring anybody out of spiritual famine is the revelation of the hour is the oil and the wine hallelujah and if you want somebody to awaken out of spiritual famine give them a little wine just share with them say this lord's been showing me so many things and i see this in the bible and listen to this have you ever heard of that before oh there's a seat on the inside something's going to quiver just a little bit the outside mind might shut it down real quick but you just keep sowing in there that stimulation that's stimulating you and that seed on the inside is going to quiver just a little bit quiver just a little bit more until all of a sudden there's an awakening of the seed and they receive their own oil and their own wine the only thing that will bring you out of your spiritual funk your spiritual dark ages your spiritual famine is to get back to the word you can't work your way out of it friends you can't you can't work your way out of that it's going to take another inspiration from heaven to break you out of that it's going to take another little bit of that word that quickened something inside of you that brings you back to life to bring you out of your spiritual darkness hallelujah the third seal he says now we find out he he measures it out and charged for it exactly wheat natural natural life that was living on but symbolizing spirit oil and joy of the wine that spirit life don't hurt that leave it alone now we've been talking about this quite a bit but i want to want to show you that this this black horse rider is totally content with you going through the religious motions of church totally completely content in fact prefers it that way if you just go through the religious motions of church come to church and i pay my tithes and i'm a good christian that's not what god wants the lamb didn't say anything the lamb said you can measure out the wheat and the barley the natural just going through the natural part of church there's a natural part of church life you can go just through the natural part of church life but that's not what it takes it takes the oil and the wine you can go you've got to do the natural part of church life there's nothing wrong with that but if that's all there is there's no life yet he wants you to have a spiritual life a life full of the oil with the stimulation that comes from the wine you can go to church every sunday it doesn't mean a thing it's good to come to church every sunday we believe that that's the word but if there's no spiritual life there you're gonna have to get an anointing from the word an inspiration that comes from the message of the hour to quicken something on the inside to stimulate my revelation to give a little life back in there you need to get drunk a little bit amen too stagnant on old stagnant waters and old things and just living a dry life living a black life living a famine life where spiritually you don't have enough spiritual faith to pray for your own family that they'll be healed not enough spiritual faith to stand on your own word amen dry anemic and spiritual famine and you can be that way sitting in the church wanting the other brothers and sisters to do it for you or the preacher to do it for you but god wants you to have the spirit life he wants you to have the oil and the wine he wants you to have the fresh revival going in inside he wants you to get a little bit drunk on this revelation and let it stimulate you into action where you actually get up and shout a little bit say amen once in a while clap your hands or go out on the street and start sharing it with other people not dead formal religion but a spirit life drunk on the wine of revelation hallelujah that's what i want friends it's a lot funner to be drunk on wine than it is be sitting around dead on old stale bread i want to be drunk on the wine of that revelation that stimulates that gives life that excites us all over again amen remember when you first come to the message how excited you were oh i found a source of life i've never heard these things before it's everything inside of me is coming to life well don't you go through this paralysis of of compromise to the red horse to the black horse spiritual family come back to that first love and say lord i'm going to dive into this word right here and i pray that you would stimulate me with new wine get me a little bit drunk and get me back into action where i lose my inhibition i lose my old stale thought process and i just get into action hallelujah the four series says now the power of revelation brings stimulation to the believer for the power of the wine natural wine is to stimulate to bring a person that's all slumped down to a stimulation see when they now know they're a power of the revelation of the word gives stimulation of joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction the stimulation that it's vindicated it's proved it's called in the scriptures we want to refer to it as new wine they always like to that these are drunk on new wine see all right spiritual wine i think the best interpretation would be on spiritual wine as the natural wine reveals itself in a and stimulating power so does the new wine as it reveals the word of god which is spirit see the word itself is spirit that's what brings the life that's what brings the stimulation is the revelation of the word see he says the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form jesus said my word that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life the word itself is spirit it's a spirit in the word form and then you see when it's quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts it's the spirit of the word that goes to work in your life it's not you that goes to work you don't wake up in the morning and and get out your tool bag and say i'm going to work on this old pesthouse and i'm going to clean it up and fix it up and shape it up and make it ready for the rapture it's not you that does that it's the word that does that when the word's been quickened because the word is spirit when that when you receive that word that spirit comes with it and it begins to work and act all we have to do is submit to the word we can't neglect the word we can't neglect the message we can't neglect these things and expect to overcome because it takes the oil and the wine but now you start bringing the word now that's the thing that actually brings life is the word and that brings the joy of stimulation of new wine and that's what it was on pentecost when the word was vindicated i'll tell you friends i read in this book and i'll be reading down and i've got all kinds of things marked up and i'll be reading all of a sudden i'll go to stomping my foot and i'll say oh praise god what was it stimulation by revelation something struck me i just saw myself another way i just saw a clear picture of jesus christ oh that's redemption that's what redemption is i'm seeing it it's coming to me by stimulation by revelation i get more excited about that oh my people will go they'll go get stimulated at a ball game and and you know what it's fine to be excited for whatever you stimulated a ballgame and can't find any stimulation in the seals book how can you be so excited when somebody carrying a piece of pigskin crosses a certain line that you'll stand to your feet in your house and put both hands over your hair and say all right way to go but when the message is coming across and god's revealing the word you just sit there with no life and spiritual famine it doesn't mean anything i read the message like it's a stale book just like it's a textbook i'm reading my math book or i'm reading my history book or the history of the church ages oh my goodness that's life that should bring life if it's not bringing life we say god do something in me that this brings life to me stimulation where i go to patent my foot a little bit i slap my hand on my knee i say oh that's good listening to a tape going down the road and you start pounding on your steering wheels anybody ever done that gets so excited you start pounding on your steering wheel next thing you know you're speeding up and slowing down and speeding up and the people all around you is getting upset why because you're getting stimulated by revelation you're sipping on the wine and it's having an effect on you oh i'm just not that way you're that way of football not everybody has to run the aisles but something inside you should get excited at the revelation of the word something should come to life something should be inspired inside and said oh praise god that's me i'm looking in the mirror i see me that's me mama that's me i don't think that little boy who walked up to that mirror for the first time and he raised his hand and the little boy he didn't say mama that's me when he caught the revelation of what that was that was a reflection of himself he went running mama mama mama that's me oh when i see this word unlocking and unveiling showing what was in the mind of god before the foundation of the world and i find myself there i say it's me it's me it's me right here i'm right here have you read this scripture that's me have you read this scripture that's me hallelujah how can you sit there dead and stiff when god is showing you the whole plan of redemption i say wake up out of spiritual famine and get excited about the word again say god pour your revelation upon me give me a fresh sip of the new wine let the oil flow down all over me again let me be excited about something that's worth being excited about hallelujah i can't think of any other reason to get beside yourself brother branham said i started looking at that and talking about that i go to cutting up a little bit hallelujah why stimulation of revelation let's turn to luke chapter 15. we'll look at just a couple stories as we wind down and we'll close one thing i've noticed about people who drink and get stimulated they like it and you don't ever have to beg them to come to the bar friday night saturday they're going to be there why they like the effects of the wine they like the way it feels they're going to be there you don't beg them nobody sends out special invitations amen nobody goes oh would you please please please come tonight they're there they're first ones in line they're there every time they know their name because they're always here every friday bill's here larry's here why they love it somebody who gets stimulated by revelation you don't beg them to come to church you don't have to coax them in if they like that wine they're going to be here you don't have to beg them to listen to a tape they like drinking wine they like the effects of the stimulation they like the revelation that comes forth they're going to drink and drink and drink and drink and drink no begging a drunk to drink amen after those disciples spilled out of the upper room you didn't have to coax them into another meeting they had tasted the stimulation by revelation in the upper room and they spilled out as those that were drunk on new wine and what was it they talked to peter they said these are drunk on new wine and they mock them peter stood up these men are not drunk as you suppose but this is the fulfillment of scriptures what was it that was causing them to act like that the fulfillment of scriptures friends peter peter stood up on that first day and started breaking out the word to them and brother branham said what was it that got them so excited when they see the promised word come to pass in their life that's what was stimulating them to dance and the shout and to run about in the street and to speak with other tongues it wasn't something that just the spirit just picked them up and moved them about and they had no control of themselves they were stimulated by a revelation coming to pass right now they could see the prophecy of joel they could see what david had talked about that's what that was what peter's referring to in that first sermon he said this is what joel said this is what this is what david said and they could see the word fulfilled then and then they got to cutting up and acting crazy and running around why they were stimulated by the revelation of the word now hallelujah that revelation of that word now should be stimulating us friends it should be exciting us because it's happening now luke chapter 15 verse 11. you're so stimulated i forget what scripture we're going to read and i forget what we're supposed to do but i like it you don't have to beg me to take another drink i'll take another drink luke chapter 15 verse 11 and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me and he divided unto him his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country in their way and there wasted his substance with riotous living when he had spent all their there arose a mighty famine in the land see this boy he moves out and he finds himself in the third seal and there's a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want and he went and joined himself to citizen of the country and he sent him into the fields to feed swine and he would feign have filled his belly with the hust that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him so here we find a man who leaves his father's house and he goes into a far country and he finds himself in famine he finds himself in the third seal and while he's in the third seal amen he he he is so low down in the third seal that he is about ready to eat pig food friends when you get away from god and get to such a spiritual famine condition that you're about to eat pig food hollywood entertainments of the world that's pig food friends you can solo down such in a famine condition famine from he's away from israel away from his father's house in such a famine condition so low down he's about to start eating pig food when you get into that condition wake up when you're just about to be tempted to go to the movie theater about to be tempted to go feast on hollywood wake up you're about to eat pig food and this scripture will determine where you're at you're just about to feed on pig slop that's how much in spiritual famine this man was why because he wasn't feeding on anything that would sustain him he didn't have any nourishment or any sustenance so the only thing that he could get was pig food for a little stimulation when you have to go to pig food to stimulate you there's a problem when pig food is what will excite you and stimulate you and get you to the next weekend is a little more pig food there's a problem you're in spiritual famine verse 15 we'll read it again and he joined himself to the citizen of the country and he sent him into the fields to feed swine and he would feign have filled his belly with the hust that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him and when he come to himself he said how many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough to eat and to spare and i perish with hunger i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants friends when he got into this condition where he was about to eat pig food verse 17 said and when he came to himself when he caught a revelation this is not what i was born for this is not what i'm here for this is not where i came from when he came to himself oh if you're in the if you're in the third seal come to yourself now if you're in spiritual famine come to yourself awaken now and say this isn't what i was born for i wasn't put on this earth to tend to the things of the world and eat pig food i was i'm from my father's house i'll go back to my father's house come back to where the food is good amen come back to where the source is pure yes he said i will go to my father's house but he went humbly broken in humility he passes through the judgment seal and says i'm not even worthy i'm not worthy father just make me a servant he didn't come back proud having conquered the world he'd come back recognizing what he needed verse 20 and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said unto him father i have sinned against heaven in the sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son said to his servants bring forth the best robe amen and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet what did he do he brought him to adoption put a robe on him and a ring on his finger he brought him to holy ghost baptism to adoption bring he said and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it let us eat and be merry for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be merry friends this is the story of our lives this is the story of our lives the son was lost when was he a son he was always a son when he was down in the far country living for the world he was a son when he got so low down he would eat the pig food he was a son when he came to himself he was a son he come back in repentance to his father's house what was it it was the man anointing when he came to himself caught revelation the man anointing brought him to the baptism of the holy ghost to adoption put the robe on him and put the ring on his finger come to ourselves now say i'm from my father's house i don't have to live this way samson had gotten the condition where he began to compromise see samson goes all the way through the seals friends samson sees a woman that's not of israel and he wants her to be his wife there was a commandment that he wasn't supposed to take of the children of the land and make his wife there was a commandment but he could probably reason in a way because moses did it and it was fine right joseph did it and it was fine and it's happened before and it's fine he didn't even understand the word of god that joseph and moses were types of christ who had to take a gentile bride so now he could probably reason away because he saw somebody else do it not looking at the word but looking at what somebody else did and he began to reason because other people have done it and i saw moses and i saw joseph and it'll be okay for me and so he begins to compromise but that compromise takes him all the way to destruction friends because he compromised instead of taking a wife from the daughters of his people he takes a wife from the philistines and after he takes that wife we know the story gets in the conflict and next thing you know he's in the red horse anointing god was using it it was part of the plan of god but now he's at absolute war then he comes in contact with a woman delilah it always progresses sin always progresses and she wants to know the secret of his strength and the secret of the strength was a covenant with god seven locks of hair as a nazarite vow a seven seal covenant and now he's passing just like the early church they come out under a covenant with god but they begin to lose their covenant when they compromise on the word through the church ages he begins to lose and he begins to dabble with the world and go into compromise and go under the red red horse anointing and then they come and they they they start to tempt him with what's the secret what's the secret she asked him multiple times and he goes through four stages of a fall first he says you buy me with green with and i'll be as any man they bind him and he breaks them you tie me with new robes he's going through all four of them friends palmer worm canker room caterpillar locust it's always the same thing through the whole bible same thing four stages of destruction then they come and he says if you plant my hair together and pin it to the beam or you pat my hair together in a web she does it pins it to the beam he arises and pulls it out then finally in that fourth one she says he says if you cut my hair they cut his hair and he was weak as any man and they poke out his eyes next you find him grinding in the mill what is he he's an absolute spiritual famine let's read this in judges turn to judges judges chapter 16. judges chapter 16 verse 19. 19 he started talking about put him to sleep she cuts his hair and she's she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head she began to afflict him and his strength went from him and she said the philistines be upon thee samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said i will go out as at other times before and shake myself and he wished not that the lord was departed from him but the philistines took him and put his eyes put out his eyes and brought him down to gaza and bound him with fetters of brass and he did grind in the prison house how be it the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven so here he comes through the seals and he gets down here and he's in spiritual famine he's working the works he's grinding at the mill he has no eyesight he's in his dark ages but when he's in his dark ages brother branham says something very interesting and i'll read this as we finish he says he says samson prayed this is out of once just once more lord 1963. samson prayed right when he said lord let me die with these philistines he had failed but let me die you must be ready to die in the enemy that's got this victory over you must be willing to surrender your own ideas samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of god again he said yeah i don't want to go into this next part but i want to finish this brother branham says in the message i can't remember i think it's once more he says now samson he said a new shock of hair began to grow back and he says maybe there's a possibility that i can be restored what's a new shock of hair it's the covenant coming back friends it's the covenant coming back he's coming back to a realization of where he'd fallen from where his strength really was samson had deceived himself in thinking that maybe i could maybe it's my muscles maybe maybe it's my strength maybe it's my my good battle skills maybe it's my intellect but it was none of that it was the covenant it was the first love it was the consecration and after he comes down here to blindness and all of a sudden the revelation comes back the seals start coming back friends and at the end of the church ages after it's all fallen and cut off now the seals start coming back and he says maybe there's a possibility brother starts talking to this and once more maybe that church could rise again maybe that church could come back to its first place and and now he says samson now is willing to pay the price samson wasn't willing to pay the price before he wasn't willing to live pure to the word without defilement without compromise he wasn't willing to pay the price but now he's willing to pay the price he said maybe there's a possibility that god will have mercy and it can all come back and i tell you friends there's a possibility you find yourself moved into spiritual famine the message just wasn't what it used to be and i just don't get excited like i used to be there's a possibility friends that that fresh shock of hair can grow out again all that strength and power of the word can come back again all that anointing of the oil and the wine can come back again there's a possibility here friends this morning there's a possibility but you sampson had to be willing to pay the price samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of god again and what was the price he said let me die let me die we've got to die to the things of the world die to all these other thoughts all other ideas we've got to consecrate ourselves back to our nazarite vow and our nazarite vows being pure separated to him alone let's all stand musicians if you could come quite a bit more here but we'll get into it wednesday night we'll continue on in the third seal this felt like i wanted to stop right there say you know what spirit spiritual death is the forced horse i'll just let the cat out of the bag spiritual death but the children of god never go to the fourth horse the fourth horse rider is spiritual death eternal separation from god and the seed of god never go to the fourth horse rider they may find themselves in the journey they may have got caught up in something they may be coming out of the black horse but friends sampson could never go to eternal separation from god you can never go to eternal separation from god but if you find yourself in a famine condition there is a possibility this morning a new shock of hair can grow out stimulation of revelation can come back again the power of the word can come back again the enthusiasm excitement for the word can come back again there is a possibility friends this is power heads dear heavenly father we thank you god for your word lord we thank you for these seals lord how you show us what lucifer is trying to do but you also show us lord how you overcome god i just pray lord that you would just send us that stimulation of revelation let the oil and the wine flow over us lord god you come to reveal your word to us to teach us what was in the back part of your mind from before the foundation of the world you've brought it to us lord let us stimulate us lord give us life and stimulation to live the life you've called us to lord if there's any here that find themselves in spiritual famine going nowhere grinding around the mill with no vision for the future serving the world and the things of the world in a far away country about to eat pig food i pray god that you would just bring us back lord let us be aware lord that you have an open book you have a revealed word that can stimulate us lord you have a baptism in the holy ghost lord that can bring us the oil and the wine and i pray lord if there's any in that condition here that you would just stimulate them now lord awaken within them let them feel in their heart that new shock of hair growing back that excitement lord for the word for the possibility of being restored back the possibility of coming back to the former glory lord god we know that's what you want for your church in this end time you want us to come back come back to what it was when the pentecostal blessing first fell come back to what it was when peter and them spilled out of the upper room drunk on the new wine that's what you want for us lord that's what we want i pray father that you bring it back we love you god we give you our life we ask that you would bless us now in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you saints we'll we'll work on more of the third seal wednesday night come expecting there was a lot more but i just felt a stop right there do you feel a new shock of hair coming back do you feel the potentials all coming back again the potentials for the supernatural the potentials for the super race it comes by consecration friends his nazarite vow was returning his vow of separation of consecration to the word it was coming back do you feel it coming back friends do you feel the second second circumcision coming back bringing you back into the promised land to the redemptive promises a shock of hair just shake your head a little bit just move your head just a little bit you'll find it's just a little scruff right now but you keep believing it's coming back to the full covenant samson was coming back to full power to full strength he was called to be a deliverer he was coming back to full position this church that came out of pentecost was called to go to the rapture was called to be the super church the super race and brothers sisters feel it it's coming back the potential is here you just have to be willing to pay the price you have to be willing to die sing the song open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see i want to see you [Music] so open the eyes of my heart alone open the eyes of

amen let him be awesome let let his word be awesome let the revelation be awesome not old news not something we've heard over and over again but let it be awesome friends submit to it give yourself to it let it be awesome oh i'm so tired of the world i'm so tired of living under my privileges i've caught such a revelation beyond he shouldn't any shadow of a doubt my position in him before the foundation of the world that i know who i am and where i come from and where i'm going and what he's called me for and i'm absolutely so tired of living below that when he's called for the super church i know he's talking about me when he's talking about the restoration back to what the church was in the first place i know he's talking about me and i'm so tired of not having it friends that i want it amen i'm opening myself and saying oh god i know the possibilities have come back you're a loving father you're restoring back almighty god just take me lord let me die cut me up shred me to pieces and build me back the way you want me father oh i'm so tired friends of what the world has labeled me i'm not that what the what i've been trained to believe all my life i don't believe it anymore but i believe what the word says i can feel it i get up in the morning and shake my head and i can feel it see the problem with samson was he lost confidence in the covenant and he started becoming self-confident it's always work god's always blessed and i can play around with my consecration and it won't matter and he woke up and he shook himself as before the scripture says he said i will shake myself as before now tell me if you had never cut your hair in all of your life until you're an adult male and you have seven locks of hair all down your back tell me that you don't wake up every morning and feel it he woke up and shook himself don't tell me he didn't know his covenant was gone he knew it was gone but he thought it was him he thought he could do the job he thought he was the one doing it he forgot it was his consecration [Music] and he gets down and finally he comes to humility in the sixth seal he finally comes to repentance and recognizes it wasn't me it never was me it was always god i've got nothing to do with this it's him and in repentance he comes and he says once more lord take me to i'll die just let it come back brother bam said he felt a new shock of hair going out he said the possibilities of return all shake yourself this morning it's not you shake yourself until you feel the covenant coming back separated to him into him only consecrated to his word separated from the world living his word true to it as i know how to be feel it coming back friends when the consecration comes back the manifestation comes with it it's a promise for our day i'm tired of waiting to be the super church i'm ready now how many says you're ready now that you feel the shock of hair you can feel it when you shake yourself when the word's coming forth you can feel it and you believe there's a possibility how many believes there's a possibility he's a gracious god that we can come back to what the picture of of us was in his mind before the foundation of the world what the church fell from the beginning that we're coming back to that picture of a perfect church i say there's possibilities this morning and i'm excited about the possibilities stay consecrated friends be willing to pay the price and all the strength of the church will come back god bless you we love you lord willing we'll see you again wednesday god be with you we love you so much if we don't see you wednesday maybe we'll meet you in the air because the potential is coming back the super church the super race the amateur gods back on earth again peter and paul walk this earth paul and barnabas they said you're gods they fail to worship them i thought peter was a god oh wouldn't you love it if people were mistaking you for the same thing wouldn't you love it if you lived such a consecrated life under the power of the holy ghost that you walked according to the word so perfectly that when you spoke it came to pass and people were curious whether or not you were a god that had come down you can tell them i'm not god but worship god i'm just the son of god god bless you friends the word is true everything else is a lie praise the lord well then this mission not
