[14:35] Spirit to have
[14:37] preeminence in this
[14:39] service not wanting to be seen or heard
[14:43] of our own selves but just
[14:47] wanting that
[14:49] voice to
[14:51] echo through the corridors of our heart
[14:56] drawing us closer to you and
[15:00] farther away from this
[15:02] world Lord we ask that you would deal
[15:07] with
[15:09] hearts
[15:11] and that you
[15:14] would being the great physician perform
[15:18] heart
[15:19] surgery on each one of us as our song

[17:05] we ask these things to be
[17:07] so in Jesus lovely
[17:10] name
[17:13] amen praise the
[17:16] lord it's uh good to be here

[17:28] before you
[17:29] and trust that uh something will be said
[17:32] to help you on your Christian
[17:37] journey and um I would like to
[17:43] read uh from The Book of Luke the 6th
[17:47] chapter
[17:52] um we could just
[17:56] read um
[18:04] that's uh if we could let's read the
[18:07] 27th
[18:09] verse Luke
[18:11] [Music]
[18:15] 6:27 but I say unto you which hear love
[18:20] your
[18:21] enemies do good to them that hate you
[18:24] which hate you bless them that curse you
[18:28] and pray for them which despitefully use
[18:31] you and unto him that smiteth thee on
[18:34] One Cheek offer also the other and him
[18:38] that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to
[18:42] take thy coat
[18:44] also give to every man that asketh of
[18:48] thee and of him that taketh away thy
[18:51] Goods ask him not
[18:54] again and as ye would that men should do
[18:58] to you do you also to them
[19:01] likewise for if you love them which love
[19:05] you what thank have ye for Sinners also
[19:09] love those that love
[19:11] them and if you do good to them which do
[19:15] good to you what thank have ye for
[19:17] Sinners also do even the same and if you
[19:21] lend to them of whom ye hope to receive
[19:26] what thank have you for Sinners also
[19:29] into Sinners to receive as much
[19:33] again but love ye your
[19:36] enemies and do good and lend hoping for
[19:41] nothing and your reward shall be
[19:45] great and ye shall be the children of
[19:48] the highest for he is kind unto the
[19:51] unthankful and to the
[19:53] evil be ye therefore merciful as your
[19:56] father also is merciful
[19:59] judge not and ye shall not be
[20:01] judged condemn not and ye shall not be
[20:06] condemned
[20:08] forgive and ye shall be
[20:13] forgiven how do we know we're
[20:16] forgiven cuz we
[20:19] forgive give and it shall be given unto
[20:22] you good measure pressed down and shaken
[20:24] together and running over shall men give
[20:27] into your bosom for with the same
[20:29] measure that you meet with all it shall
[20:31] be measured to you again
[20:34] and just uh want to speak to you uh this
[20:39] morning uh by the help of the Lord on
[20:42] the release of
[20:44] forgiveness we just want to ask the Lord
[20:46] to add His blessings to the reading of
[20:49] the word you can be
[20:56] seated the release
[20:59] of
[21:00] forgiveness and when we looked in
[21:05] Luke um the Bible tells us
[21:10] that
[21:11] uh we're not to
[21:15] judge and if we don't want to be
[21:17] condemned then we shouldn't condemn and
[21:20] that if we want to be
[21:22] forgiven we would have to
[21:26] forgive and so that that tells us that
[21:30] we as Believers need to have a heart of
[21:34] mercy and um I just want to go through a
[21:39] couple statements just to
[21:44] um maybe uh lay a just a principle down
[21:49] brother Brenham says as soon as you are
[21:51] sorry you're already forgiven as I was
[21:54] speaking to a brother yesterday kind of
[21:56] got a little mixed up and said look
[21:58] brother if you said something to hurt
[22:01] your wife's feelings immediately you'd
[22:03] feel sorry for her you're sorry you said
[22:06] it you're already repented in your heart
[22:11] Ah that's beautiful isn't it that's
[22:13] right but you got to go tell her about
[22:16] it you got to go and say honey I'm sorry
[22:19] I said that then you're thoroughly
[22:23] repented and you know I I've been
[22:28] uh thinking about Calvary lately has
[22:32] been a heavy on my mind and uh I um I'm
[22:39] seeing Calvary in a different light and
[22:42] I I believe sometimes we as message
[22:46] Believers we can get
[22:47] so
[22:50] uh
[22:51] revelated that we can lose sight of
[22:55] Calvary and its
[22:57] Simplicity um and we don't want to be so
[23:00] predestinated that we don't need
[23:02] Calvary is that right and um and and and
[23:08] so I I want to look at Calvary in a
[23:11] different way cuz I I'm grateful that
[23:15] God no matter how much you look at
[23:17] something in the scripture God will
[23:20] unfold it and he'll show you in a
[23:21] different angle and it'll put a whole
[23:24] different perspective on it and so I
[23:26] hope uh that you'll uh uh maybe see it a
[23:30] little bit differently it's it's I I had
[23:32] to be honest it's it's it's transformed
[23:36] me in a in a way that um I am so
[23:39] grateful for and I'm you know uh you
[23:44] know you sering the Lord for a few years
[23:47] and and then he just unfolds himself in
[23:50] a in a special way and it just renews
[23:53] everything to you and it and it seems so
[23:56] fresh and new and so that's
[23:58] kind of where I'm at this morning and so
[24:02] you know um so when we think about
[24:04] Calvary you know and we think about you
[24:07] know um dying out to ourselves as Paul
[24:11] said that we was to Die daily and he
[24:15] says that uh if after the manner of men
[24:17] I have fought with beasts at Ephesus uh
[24:20] what advantage if me if the dead rise
[24:22] not let us eat drink and uh for tomorrow
[24:25] we die and so Paul I uh there was Beast
[24:29] that he had fought with in his age and I
[24:32] believe that there's beasts that we
[24:34] fight with in our age and uh you know we
[24:39] we we can think about uh this day that
[24:43] we live in and uh we can we can um
[24:48] sometimes we get so caught up uh in in
[24:53] uh focusing on our own selves but uh I I
[24:57] want to ask you something when when
[25:00] Jesus tells us and and he tells us that
[25:04] if any man will come after me let him
[25:07] deny himself and take up his cross daily
[25:11] and follow me and you know we as
[25:15] Believers know that the scripture
[25:18] plainly tells us that um that uh when
[25:23] Christ died he had forgiven us of every
[25:26] one of our trespasses
[25:29] and so this morning we're not hoping
[25:31] that tomorrow we'll be
[25:34] forgiven no matter how bad you may fall
[25:37] tomorrow there's not a hope so that he's
[25:40] going to forgive you there's got to be a
[25:42] no so that he's going to forgive you
[25:44] because when Christ saved you he for he
[25:46] for he saved you and he forgived you for
[25:49] your past sins your present sins and
[25:52] your future sins because he holds the
[25:54] beginning from the end and he knows all
[25:57] about it is that right we as Believers
[25:59] ought to believe that and so if he tells
[26:03] us that we are to he says that if any
[26:06] man would deny himself and take up his
[26:08] cross daily and follow me you know I I I
[26:12] I think that he's trying to uh tell us
[26:15] something in a in a different way that
[26:19] sometimes we we we I say it like this
[26:23] when when
[26:25] you take up your cross
[26:28] what cross are you taking
[26:32] up because if if he
[26:36] died for your past sins your present
[26:40] sins and your future
[26:42] sins what what cross are you supposed to
[26:54] carry and if we're supposed to deny
[26:57] ourselves and take up our cross daily
[27:00] now if if if he carried the
[27:03] cross why would you carry the cross of
[27:06] your
[27:12] sins because if he already carried them
[27:16] why would you try to carry him again
[27:18] yeah
[27:20] right but I but I want you to think he
[27:23] but he is also telling us there's a
[27:25] cross that we have to carry daily
[27:28] so what is that cross that we're called
[27:31] to carry because it's not the cross of
[27:35] our
[27:38] sins so we would have to go back and
[27:43] look at him as a pattern and what I
[27:49] realized when he died on that cross he
[27:53] died an innocent
[27:56] man the man never done anything
[28:01] aess he was the perfect one the sinless
[28:06] one the Spotless one amen Perfection of
[28:12] perfection and so him being the perfect
[28:15] one never doing anything wrong but when
[28:20] he died he died with the sins of the
[28:22] world upon him and
[28:26] so if we're supposed to follow in those
[28:29] same bloody
[28:31] footsteps then what cross do we carry
[28:35] cuz he's he's carried our cross
[28:39] already
[28:41] so
[28:43] what what helped me is I
[28:47] realized the cross that we carry is when
[28:50] we suffer
[28:52] persecution and we've done nothing a
[28:54] miss
[29:01] amen see it's when it's when we've done
[29:05] nothing wrong amen and we're
[29:11] innocent that's the cross he's talking
[29:17] about because we we can say well brother
[29:20] Gabe we die daily and that's true we do
[29:24] have to die to out to ourselves but to
[29:28] me friends is it all just about
[29:35] me is it just about me packing my sins
[29:39] and no
[29:42] stop
[29:44] stop to
[29:46] me what I've seen I have spent so many
[29:52] years carrying my own
[29:55] baggage that I didn't recognize the
[29:57] truth true cross that I'm supposed to
[30:01] carry and it's and it's really when
[30:05] somebody does you
[30:07] wrong that's when the cross is laid
[30:09] before
[30:11] you and and that's really the True Cross
[30:15] that we carry because because we live in
[30:19] lady
[30:20] OA and because things happen to us
[30:31] it's when somebody tries to rob
[30:37] you cuz the Bible tells us suffer
[30:41] yourselves to be
[30:44] robbed that's what defrauded means but
[30:48] in lady OA we've worked too hard
[30:58] you ain't taking nothing from
[31:03] me and the moment we do that we've
[31:08] missed
[31:10] it because remember we're rich and we're
[31:13] increased with goods and we have need of
[31:19] nothing but we
[31:23] miss the
[31:25] opportunity when somebody wants wants to
[31:28] rob
[31:32] you you said brother Gabe I worked hard
[31:35] for
[31:37] this yeah but you're missing the
[31:42] lesson I am missing the
[31:47] lesson he tells you we've read that when
[31:52] they take your
[31:54] cloak don't forget them to take you
[31:57] don't for bid them to take your coat
[32:01] also
[32:04] what it's it's when it he tells us to
[32:09] love our enemies do good to them which
[32:15] hate you and I I want us I want you to
[32:18] ask
[32:19] yourself when's the last time we have
[32:23] done good to somebody that hated us
[32:29] yeah look it's
[32:32] easy for us to do good to those of the
[32:35] household of
[32:37] faith I have no problem doing anything
[32:40] for
[32:42] you because I love
[32:46] you it's not a
[32:50] labor but that's not
[32:54] Christianity even Sinners do that
[32:58] yeah even the hardest of hard has a soft
[33:02] spot for somebody that will do anything
[33:05] for that
[33:07] person so so we can't Merit our our
[33:10] Christianity based upon that but really
[33:15] it's those that curse
[33:18] you and
[33:22] despitefully you know what the word
[33:24] despite it means to insult to treat
[33:26] abusively to revile
[33:30] you but when was the last time when
[33:35] somebody despitefully used
[33:41] you that you prayed for
[33:45] him see CU this is true
[33:49] Christianity and and we can we can have
[33:53] this message friends and we can have it
[33:56] so laid out in our minds and have all of
[34:00] our quote books and we can have
[34:02] everything systematically perfect but
[34:06] many times we spend most of our life
[34:09] trying to make our lives bulletproof so
[34:11] that we don't have to deal with that
[34:14] scripture right
[34:23] there and when we do that we're missing
[34:26] an opportunity
[34:28] to carry the True
[34:31] Cross because the
[34:33] almighty you know when he lived that
[34:36] life that he lived he suffered like no
[34:40] man had
[34:42] suffered but he did it for you and
[34:46] I when he
[34:48] was when when he walked
[34:51] the you know the streets of Nazareth and
[34:55] Galilee
[34:58] the man brother brandham said that of
[35:01] all the emotions that he expressed in
[35:04] life was
[35:06] one and it was that he had wept
[35:11] often and we would think a man that was
[35:14] Perfection of
[35:16] perfection but he wept
[35:19] often no wonder when he was on Earth he
[35:21] was so
[35:23] misunderstood a lot of times like we are
[35:26] misunderstood
[35:29] because we think power and might but
[35:32] what is really power and
[35:35] might the man with the greatest
[35:37] anointing ever you know what when he had
[35:39] the greatest you know what he sat down
[35:43] and taught and precious words proceeded
[35:47] from his mouth there was no shouting
[35:50] there was no running the AIS there was
[35:53] no speaking in tongues but it was
[35:56] precious words proceeded from his mouth
[35:59] and afterwards they wanted to kill him
[36:04] yeah it's right and so so many times we
[36:09] get a a
[36:13] u uh we get a Pentecostal understanding
[36:16] of what power
[36:20] is but really what is
[36:24] power
[36:26] amen you know brother Brenham tells us
[36:30] this he
[36:32] says can you go the Second
[36:38] Mile well I only got time for
[36:43] one cuz it don't fit my schedule brother
[36:48] Gabe can we reschedule that second mile
[36:52] because that's how we live in lady oia
[36:54] right we we got our phone we got the
[36:56] calendar and somebody you know nowadays
[36:59] we we we can't we can't just pop in on
[37:01] somebody and knock on the
[37:04] doorstep cuz they may not have time for
[37:07] us you remember back in the day some of
[37:10] your oldtimers I'm kind of you know
[37:12] remember we just go to the house but now
[37:16] it it's such a way where everybody has
[37:18] got everything so mapped out and laid
[37:20] out that we don't have time to go the
[37:23] Second
[37:25] Mile but brother bham says can you go
[37:28] the Second Mile can you turn the cheek
[37:31] the other side that's the way to test
[37:35] Christianity see how far you can go in
[37:39] love fellowship and Brotherhood that's
[37:43] how you test
[37:46] Christianity it's when we're compelled
[37:49] to go the Second
[37:51] Mile will we pick up that cross it's
[37:55] when we suffer persecution and we go
[37:58] through hard times brother brandom says
[38:00] tell a Dead Man He's a hypocrite and see
[38:04] what
[38:08] happens kick him kick him on the side
[38:11] and say y old
[38:17] hippocrite he'll not say a word and
[38:21] that's right he'll just lay
[38:25] there but that's when we have to fight
[38:29] self-preservation that's right amen
[38:32] that's be because what happens if it
[38:34] gets out on internet land brother
[38:39] Gabe if you stand for the gospel you're
[38:41] always going to be
[38:45] misunderstood but what will the people
[38:48] think about me brother Gabe listen it
[38:51] don't matter right it really doesn't
[38:55] matter what the people think about you
[38:58] what really matters is your heart
[39:00] towards
[39:01] God that's all that matters really but
[39:05] so many times we are worried about our
[39:10] self-image before one another but I have
[39:14] I'm telling you I have found that
[39:18] there's such a liberty in just being who
[39:21] you
[39:23] are because listen I I don't want to get
[39:26] I don't I don't want to miss the Rapture
[39:28] and realize I was sowing I was trying so
[39:32] hard to be something that I wasn't amen
[39:36] I just want to be
[39:37] me right and you you have to come to the
[39:41] place where it's not trying to be like
[39:44] somebody else there's God called you to
[39:47] be you God didn't call you to be your
[39:50] neighbor and you say I admire that's
[39:53] fine look I there's I'm I there's so
[39:55] many here that I admire
[39:58] but I'm I'm not trying to mimic you I
[40:01] want to be a mimic of Jesus
[40:04] Christ and and your nature is different
[40:06] and my nature is different and we're all
[40:08] natured differently but that's the whole
[40:11] point God wants a bouquet
[40:13] bride he doesn't want he he don't it's
[40:16] not a cookie cutter punch everybody out
[40:19] the same he wants us all unique and
[40:22] individuals but you have to embrace your
[40:25] uniqueness and stop trying to be like
[40:28] your neighbor that's right yes sir but
[40:32] just be you
[40:35] amen God called you to be
[40:41] you brother Bram says he'll just lay
[40:46] there if you're wondering what that has
[40:48] anybody figured out what that picture
[40:51] is good thank you if you're in the grave
[40:54] that's what you'd see if you was looking
[40:56] up
[41:02] a man that's dead in
[41:04] Christ you can call him a hypocrite call
[41:07] him anything you want he'll never rise
[41:10] up about it if anything he'll slip off
[41:13] somewhere and pray for you that's
[41:16] right see because a man that has the
[41:20] ability to do that is really a true
[41:23] intercessor that's right he's really
[41:26] found his position on this Earth is to
[41:28] be a
[41:29] mediator when when you look at when you
[41:32] look at Christ when you look at the
[41:34] almighty brother baram says Heaven could
[41:37] not receive him the sin of the world
[41:40] laid upon him the world and the world
[41:43] rejected him as their King there was no
[41:46] place left for him to die he could he
[41:48] couldn't come to heaven for he had the
[41:51] sin of the world on him he was hated and
[41:54] despised and spit on and rejected and
[41:57] and refused of the Earth but he stood
[42:00] Between Heaven and Earth and bridged the
[42:05] way you so so beautifully that that
[42:10] that he was rejected of
[42:15] heaven so much so that when he was
[42:18] standing there he would say my God my
[42:21] God why hast Thou forsaken me
[42:27] but yet in the mid I remember this man
[42:30] you know what kills me you know I love
[42:31] images and I love looking I love looking
[42:35] uh for for Christian pictures and I
[42:37] search so hard I have searched for for
[42:41] decades trying to find a true image of
[42:45] Calvary and I've yet to find it and and
[42:48] it always Grieves me when I look because
[42:50] they'll have a a crown of thorns with a
[42:53] few drops of blood and you know they'll
[42:55] have just a little slit on his side with
[42:57] just a few drops of blood and you know
[43:01] and and when you look at that imagery
[43:04] that is absolutely false
[43:07] amen the Bible
[43:10] says that his bones stared at
[43:17] him the Bible says that his viage was
[43:21] marred more than any
[43:23] man and when that cat of nine Tales
[43:26] struck him
[43:28] that the catanine Tails had chunks of
[43:31] Glass and Metal and just
[43:34] raw grit that when it whenever that that
[43:38] that that that Taskmaster would lash out
[43:41] at him it would wrap around his body and
[43:44] then rip trunks out of
[43:48] him now you get whipped like
[43:51] that and see if you just got a little
[43:53] slit on your side and right
[44:01] but he suffered like that so that we
[44:05] might be healed this
[44:12] morning he was doing it saying father
[44:18] when the Earth was rejecting him he
[44:21] would say he would say my God my God but
[44:24] then he would look and he would say
[44:26] father forgive
[44:29] them and remember he was he was
[44:32] suffocating on that cross to where he
[44:37] would he would he was the way that he
[44:39] was in he would actually with his feet
[44:42] nailed he would have to push up on those
[44:45] Nails in order to grasp a
[44:50] breath and not only just to breathe but
[44:54] he would actually find the words
[44:58] to say
[45:07] father
[45:10] give
[45:14] them and then he have to push up again
[45:18] and his precious
[45:21] feet no
[45:23] you the pain that would run to his
[45:29] body
[45:34] four
[45:39] they oh
[45:42] not
[45:44] what they do
[45:57] and we sit here this
[46:02] morning in the comfort of Lady
[46:07] o air
[46:09] conditioned padded
[46:12] seats nice
[46:15] clothes and that's all
[46:18] fine but don't get led to
[46:22] sleep and forget the cross that we are
[46:26] called to carry
[46:28] because that's the
[46:31] cross we're to
[46:37] carry but too many times we get caught
[46:40] up and dying out I got to die
[46:45] today but remember if we
[46:48] die it's not a dread
[46:50] because after Calvary is a resurrection
[46:57] so don't forget to
[46:59] resurrect don't forget because the Bible
[47:01] says his mercies are new Every Morning
[47:03] amen and so there ought to be a
[47:06] resurrection after that death but we can
[47:09] get C so called up in dying where it's
[47:12] negative negative negative
[47:15] negative and there's no
[47:17] resurrection and we get beat down and
[47:19] beat down and beat
[47:21] down and we miss the Easter amen right
[47:27] because he was interceding to bridge the
[47:31] gap and if he is interceding then what
[47:35] ought we to
[47:37] do he was being a mediator he was being
[47:40] an in between uh somebody that mediates
[47:45] when there's two parties that are in
[47:49] disagreement when when two people cannot
[47:52] get along somebody steps in and they
[47:56] have
[47:57] uh uh that they like brother Chad a
[48:01] pastor stays neutral and and he EDS
[48:05] between the two
[48:08] right we as Believers when we have
[48:11] family or co-workers or whatever and we
[48:14] see a problem somewhere in our life with
[48:17] our family members or uh uh uh friends
[48:21] or whoever it is if we have the spirit
[48:23] of Christ in us that same mediator
[48:26] exists so that we can be the in between
[48:29] that we can stand between them and bring
[48:32] them cuz it's not about division it's
[48:34] about bringing people back into
[48:38] harmony is that right that's that's what
[48:41] ought to be the heart of every believer
[48:44] is to be able to bring brother brandham
[48:47] tells us this he
[48:51] says he says if a man's heart isn't out
[48:54] to save his brother there's something
[48:57] wrong with his
[48:58] heart no matter what condition if a
[49:01] brother hates
[49:04] him what that's
[49:09] right well in this message the moment we
[49:11] don't agree and they well they believe
[49:14] this and I hey
[49:18] stop listen No Matter listen this is
[49:22] that's the time that we are to be an
[49:25] intercessor but you know you know what
[49:27] the the thing of it is is when somebody
[49:29] believes something a little bit
[49:30] different than you you have to have
[49:32] enough
[49:33] confidence in what God has shown you
[49:36] that Hey listen brother if you got more
[49:38] light on it I want it amen and I'm
[49:41] willing to tear down what I had and take
[49:44] truth because I am a seeker of Truth we
[49:49] have to be
[49:51] willing and we have to have enough
[49:53] humility I don't care what it is but to
[49:56] many times we think we got it all
[49:59] figured out because we did this and I
[50:01] did this and I know and buddy I've
[50:03] studied this so many hours and you can't
[50:08] that's
[50:09] right and the moment you do that
[50:14] amen it's to
[50:16] me like like when they when they
[50:19] challenge brother brandom brother BR
[50:21] they said brother Bram said well said
[50:22] when you got brother time brother Bram
[50:24] i' like to straighten you out on you
[50:25] know
[50:27] what did he say he didn't say don't you
[50:30] know I'm look let me show you I'm
[50:33] Malachi 4
[50:37] yeah he he didn't take him to Revelation
[50:41] 10 I'm the
[50:47] mighty right he didn't take him Luke
[50:53] 17:30 but what did he say he a brother
[50:56] well I got time right
[50:58] now I want to be straightened
[51:01] out see to me that Prophet had s and
[51:04] that was an artificial put on that was
[51:07] true
[51:08] humility when I hear that Prophet I hear
[51:12] character
[51:14] right because he wasn't the mighty
[51:17] Angel he was just the mouthpie that's
[51:22] right he was the vessel that that Mighty
[51:26] angel
[51:27] could Minister
[51:30] through and brother Braham says no
[51:32] matter what condition if his brother
[51:35] hates him if his brother's against him
[51:37] if his brothers tried everything he can
[51:40] to tear him
[51:51] down yet that man heart
[51:55] pulls for his
[51:58] brother and I love this brother R said
[52:00] he can't help
[52:02] it there's something in there that just
[52:05] calls
[52:06] out oh my brother you're wrong but I
[52:10] want you to be
[52:13] saved am
[52:15] amen see Eternal what is the essence of
[52:19] eternal life it's living for
[52:24] others and that means means a
[52:28] sacrificial
[52:29] life you know when we talk about Paul
[52:32] fighting with beast at Ephesus and he he
[52:35] was the lion you know we we we we we
[52:38] automatically think well where the
[52:39] Eagles the Flying Eagle brother tear the
[52:45] beak
[52:47] right but really there's another beast
[52:50] in the midst of those four beasts
[52:57] and it was a
[53:00] lamb that had been
[53:03] slain that's right with seven eyes and
[53:06] seven
[53:08] horns and so at I think there's a
[53:12] time
[53:14] to to have that eagle
[53:18] anointing but I think sometimes we fell
[53:21] to miss that slain
[53:23] lamb that gentle
[53:27] sacrificial intercessory
[53:32] lamb see because we spend so much of our
[53:38] Lives having it all figured
[53:44] out you know us brothers are
[53:50] fixers it's broke I'm going fix it
[53:58] and if I can't me and YouTube
[54:02] can don't worry I'll get YouTube
[54:06] certified and I'm on the
[54:09] job give me three or four videos and I'm
[54:12] ready to
[54:14] go right and I'm going to fix
[54:18] it
[54:20] but too many times we rely on our own
[54:25] ability
[54:27] to fix
[54:28] things you know because we have so
[54:32] much understanding
[54:34] and uh really in essence and I I
[54:40] don't um I hope you understand really we
[54:45] are in a
[54:46] sense um I would say this bride is the
[54:49] elite of the
[54:53] elites she's a 1center as we would say
[54:58] right one in a
[54:59] million and and if we ain't careful we
[55:02] can we can take that in a wrong way and
[55:06] get puffed up about it and think that we
[55:08] are going to straighten everybody out
[55:11] when in reality we're the ones that need
[55:13] straightened
[55:15] out right you know be
[55:19] because we as brethren we are so caught
[55:23] up with
[55:24] fixing and
[55:28] I've I've I've found in my own self that
[55:31] sometimes there's things broke in our
[55:32] lives that we just can't
[55:35] fixed and God has designed it
[55:40] so you know because we have the profit
[55:44] well sometimes we can get so independent
[55:48] well we think church is a
[55:54] byproduct and and
[55:57] because uh there's so many resources to
[56:00] pull upon we can come up with our own uh
[56:05] recipe or formula to fix whatever is in
[56:07] our
[56:10] lives and you know uh if you'll if
[56:14] you'll bear with
[56:16] me
[56:17] um what has brought me to
[56:20] this uh you you'll
[56:23] remember uh pastor preached a couple
[56:26] weeks on ago on the the the freedom
[56:30] through
[56:31] forgiveness do you remember that one
[56:33] remember they draw the little stick
[56:36] figures remember
[56:38] that and uh well if you remember he and
[56:43] if you haven't heard it if you wasn't
[56:44] here please go back and listen to
[56:47] it but when he when he started drawing
[56:50] those figures and when he and he started
[56:52] talking to us he said that he is shared
[56:56] it with several people and counseling
[56:59] and he wanted to share it with us this
[57:02] morning well I I confess to you this
[57:06] morning that wife and I was one of those
[57:09] that he had counseled with
[57:11] and wrote those little sck figures out
[57:14] for
[57:15] us
[57:19] and I learned so
[57:23] much because sometimes there's things
[57:26] that's broken in our
[57:29] home and no matter how much we try to
[57:32] fix
[57:33] them you and your own self cannot fix
[57:37] what's
[57:39] broken and we as
[57:42] husbands have
[57:44] to find the place of
[57:47] humility to be able to say it's broke
[57:51] and I can't fix
[57:54] it and it's so hard hard for us as men
[57:59] to be able to come to that
[58:02] spot and the reason one of the reasons
[58:05] why is
[58:07] because we as message believer have a
[58:10] complex of following a
[58:17] man
[58:19] um and if we would be honest with
[58:24] ourselves we would all all say Amen that
[58:27] it's no doubt predominant amongst our
[58:32] ranks because we follow a
[58:37] prophet the moment we talk about it we
[58:39] say no I'm not following them
[58:43] man and you know what that is that's
[58:46] your
[58:47] insecurity that's my
[58:51] insecurity and because we don't want to
[58:55] fall under that following
[58:59] amand
[59:01] instead we'll try in our own CES to fix
[59:06] everything and I
[59:09] found when you get past that of not
[59:12] worrying about what people think about
[59:15] you I
[59:18] follow a
[59:23] man I follow
[59:26] him as he followed
[59:30] Christ I follow that man right there on
[59:33] the third row into any battle the Lord
[59:36] is leading
[59:42] amen and the rest of you that didn't say
[59:45] Amen you need to
[59:50] repent because look I don't need to
[59:54] repent
[59:56] about following a man because that's the
[59:58] way God designed it yeah amen and you
[1:00:02] have to have enough confidence that
[1:00:05] you're not worried about what others
[1:00:07] think about you I know in whom I have
[1:00:11] believed amen yeah look I
[1:00:16] I in my life I have been
[1:00:21] crushed by
[1:00:23] ministers so often
[1:00:27] that when I come to this
[1:00:30] assembly I was so
[1:00:32] broken I thought I would
[1:00:35] never be able to call another man
[1:00:40] pastor and you may look at me and say
[1:00:42] why do you call Brother Chad Pastor I
[1:00:46] call him Pastor because I never thought
[1:00:49] God would heal the Brokenness in my own
[1:00:53] heart and I call him pastor
[1:00:57] to remind
[1:00:58] myself of the healing virtue of Jesus
[1:01:04] Christ you may call me
[1:01:06] unbalanced but I know in whom I
[1:01:11] believed and so when I had this
[1:01:13] Brokenness in my
[1:01:16] home I had to come to my wife and I said
[1:01:19] babe look there's a
[1:01:22] problem and I
[1:01:24] said let's let's go
[1:01:26] talk to
[1:01:33] pastor and she said I said listen listen
[1:01:36] listen I won't say
[1:01:39] nothing because she knows I would be
[1:01:42] trying to fix it before brother
[1:01:45] Chad got a word
[1:01:48] out and I told her I said listen babe I
[1:01:51] promise you I won't say nothing let's
[1:01:54] just go
[1:01:57] and she said
[1:01:58] yes and so I I called brother Chad and I
[1:02:03] talked to him just a little bit I wasn't
[1:02:05] going to try to you know straighten him
[1:02:07] out on the phone before he straightened
[1:02:08] us out on the
[1:02:10] phone but I wanted to stay
[1:02:14] neutral cuz if something was broken in
[1:02:16] me I wanted it to be
[1:02:19] fixed but you have to realize your
[1:02:22] Frailty
[1:02:26] amen and brother it's a hard
[1:02:30] thing to
[1:02:33] face but you
[1:02:35] have to break
[1:02:37] yourself of that
[1:02:40] Pride look I don't care what it
[1:02:43] cost I I I I don't look it could cost me
[1:02:48] my Ministry I don't care as long as I
[1:02:50] have happiness and the love of God in my
[1:02:53] home that's all that matters to me
[1:02:56] it I care what you think about me but in
[1:02:59] reality I
[1:03:00] don't it's a
[1:03:03] paradox because if if I preach one time
[1:03:06] and and it would ruin my Ministry but it
[1:03:08] would help one person it was worth it
[1:03:10] all Amen to me yes sir you understand
[1:03:13] what I'm saying so so I told look we we
[1:03:16] was driving driving to the church and I
[1:03:20] I told I told wifey I said babe listen I
[1:03:24] said
[1:03:25] I may have said it at home too but I
[1:03:27] said God ascended up on
[1:03:31] high and he gave gifts unto man
[1:03:36] amen and he gave some prophets and
[1:03:40] apostles and pastors and teachers praise
[1:03:44] God for the perfecting of us
[1:03:49] amen so when we
[1:03:51] go and set before brother Chad
[1:03:56] brother Chad is we are not going to
[1:03:59] brother
[1:04:01] Chad we are going to the pastor that's
[1:04:05] inside of him amen right now let me par
[1:04:09] let me let me
[1:04:10] just brother Ben let me give a
[1:04:15] disclaimer
[1:04:17] listen this is not ammonition for you to
[1:04:20] run to the pastor every time you have a
[1:04:22] problem that's not what I'm saying you
[1:04:25] know some some people you ever meet some
[1:04:27] people and it's just like they just suck
[1:04:28] virtue out of
[1:04:31] you right that's not listen if you're
[1:04:34] all that's not what I'm talking about
[1:04:36] yeah I hope you understand but it's when
[1:04:39] you have a problem and you can't figure
[1:04:41] it out you have to have enough humility
[1:04:45] I'm not preaching to you if you're
[1:04:47] always running to somebody else for your
[1:04:49] problems don't use this portion of the
[1:04:52] service for ammunition to vindicate your
[1:04:54] shortcomings
[1:04:56] some you got to rustle it out on the
[1:04:58] back side of the desert amen right but
[1:05:01] who I'm bringing this to is you stubborn
[1:05:06] brothers that's who I want to hit smack
[1:05:09] dab in the forehead this
[1:05:10] morning I want to bust you wide open and
[1:05:14] I want to leave a
[1:05:16] mark Cuz you need it I needed it that's
[1:05:21] who I'm talking to this morning I'm
[1:05:23] talking to you that think you got got it
[1:05:25] all figured out and you're the man of
[1:05:27] the home and listen if you have that I'm
[1:05:30] the man of the house complex shame on
[1:05:32] you cuz Jesus Christ is the man of the
[1:05:35] house amen right you are under him yeah
[1:05:41] and and it's when we can humble
[1:05:42] ourselves and be able to say God I don't
[1:05:45] know how to fix what's broken in my
[1:05:50] home and you know when when when we got
[1:05:54] there you know brother ch had set set
[1:05:56] across from us and I just you
[1:06:00] know I tell
[1:06:03] you I get
[1:06:06] I uh I ain't got enough good thing to
[1:06:09] say about you bro I wish you wasn't here
[1:06:10] so I could talk about you
[1:06:15] more uh and uh but you know when he set
[1:06:20] across from us he didn't go to the
[1:06:23] bookcase and pull out 12 steps to a
[1:06:26] better
[1:06:30] marriage he didn't pull out no Dr
[1:06:34] doson but you know what he
[1:06:36] did he sat across from us and he just
[1:06:40] started
[1:06:44] talking
[1:06:48] and that word started
[1:06:53] Discerning my life
[1:06:56] and
[1:06:59] hers and he would do it with such a
[1:07:03] simple illustration as a stick
[1:07:06] figure
[1:07:10] and but it was just that imagery that
[1:07:14] started to unlock something in both of
[1:07:20] us
[1:07:23] and um
[1:07:27] what what it came to when it was all
[1:07:29] said and done there was nothing wrong
[1:07:32] with her or eyes
[1:07:36] relationship but really what was
[1:07:40] broken was a 8 10 12 year old little
[1:07:46] boy what was broken in her was a 10 12
[1:07:51] year old girl
[1:07:59] and sometimes in life we look and we see
[1:08:03] a superficial
[1:08:05] problem and we don't
[1:08:08] realize that it's
[1:08:11] deeper and sometimes it takes
[1:08:14] Ministry really it took humility to be
[1:08:18] able to say I can't fix
[1:08:22] it the same way some of you Brothers
[1:08:26] and maybe
[1:08:28] sisters have to have that same humility
[1:08:31] and say I can't fix
[1:08:34] it see because you can worry about and
[1:08:37] say well yeah but if I confess that and
[1:08:39] I have to talk to brother Chad what is
[1:08:41] he
[1:08:43] I what is he going to think what
[1:08:47] listen
[1:08:49] stop
[1:08:51] stop that right there is pride
[1:08:55] you have to be willing to lay everything
[1:08:57] out and say I don't care what it costs
[1:08:59] me amen I don't care I want deliverance
[1:09:03] and I want
[1:09:04] freedom and I'm preaching these things
[1:09:07] friends because so many times we have
[1:09:09] this pretense that we try to have this
[1:09:12] vade and it's not
[1:09:15] reality look every one of us we come to
[1:09:19] this world
[1:09:23] broken you say no no no no brother Gabe
[1:09:26] my mom and dad's uh we're still together
[1:09:29] brother Gabe that's you you came from a
[1:09:30] broken home look my mom and dad was in a
[1:09:33] we was in the message I listen I don't
[1:09:36] care how you come to this world you come
[1:09:40] to this world
[1:09:43] broken there was only one that came to
[1:09:46] this world that wasn't broken and his
[1:09:49] name was Jesus Christ and he was broken
[1:09:52] for us to heal our broken
[1:09:56] but the problem of it is is we have to
[1:09:58] be honest enough with ourselves and look
[1:10:01] ourselves in the mirror and see our
[1:10:06] Brokenness and when you see it I promise
[1:10:09] you chances are you will not like what
[1:10:13] you
[1:10:16] see and
[1:10:18] most the majority and because remember
[1:10:21] this is a rugged Road of Christianity
[1:10:25] and you have to be able to be honest
[1:10:28] enough with
[1:10:31] yourself in order to look the man in the
[1:10:35] mirror and say something's broken in me
[1:10:38] and I don't know how to fix
[1:10:41] it and then you have to be able to
[1:10:43] humble yourself to the resources that
[1:10:46] are there and not worry about what
[1:10:50] anybody's going to
[1:10:53] say because because it's the hardest
[1:10:56] thing to be able to differentiate this
[1:10:58] Perfection of the message and see in
[1:11:01] this perfect spotless sinless bride and
[1:11:04] then we look in the mirror and we see
[1:11:06] how
[1:11:07] broken that's
[1:11:12] right but what makes us a sinless
[1:11:15] spotless Perfect Bride it's not your
[1:11:19] Perfection it's the blood of the Lord
[1:11:22] Jesus he is the one that makes us
[1:11:27] spotless and perfect in his
[1:11:31] eyes but there has to be enough humility
[1:11:35] for us to be able to Humble
[1:11:41] ourselves
[1:11:43] cuz
[1:11:47] when things happen in life
[1:12:01] now this
[1:12:03] is
[1:12:06] uh brother Chad
[1:12:11] [Laughter]
[1:12:20] 2.0 cuz things happen
[1:12:26] problems
[1:12:30] occur and we have this
[1:12:34] fragile little
[1:12:36] heart that we are
[1:12:39] given and in
[1:12:45] life trauma
[1:12:49] occurs I found it even in my own
[1:12:52] home even with my own children
[1:12:55] no matter how hard you try to shelter
[1:12:58] them Satan will find a way
[1:13:03] in and you have to have
[1:13:07] enough
[1:13:09] um honesty in your own self to
[1:13:12] say I messed
[1:13:15] up and Satan slipped
[1:13:18] in and instead of sweeping it underneath
[1:13:21] the rug like it's so easy for most to do
[1:13:24] you you have to get your hands dirty
[1:13:30] amen and but if we don't and we don't
[1:13:34] deal with that
[1:13:40] trauma we become
[1:13:42] linked to that
[1:13:46] indefinitely now remember you know
[1:13:50] brother Chad brought this he had already
[1:13:52] shared this with us a couple weeks prior
[1:13:55] so I am not trying to fill in the gaps
[1:13:57] to make his message more
[1:14:01] revelated uh please please Mis don't
[1:14:03] misunderstand these things but to me it
[1:14:06] it it it gave me such a look when when
[1:14:10] brother Chad shared that with me I I I I
[1:14:13] ended up preaching it in Dayton and
[1:14:15] Lorraine and now here because it has
[1:14:18] given me such a liberty that I I want
[1:14:21] the world to see those little stick
[1:14:23] figures amen
[1:14:27] amen and if that little guy is starting
[1:14:31] to annoy
[1:14:34] you I did it on
[1:14:37] purpose good I hope
[1:14:44] so and and if he wasn't he is
[1:14:50] now but I'm doing it to make a point
[1:14:55] because how long have you packed that
[1:14:58] unforgiveness in your own
[1:15:03] heart
[1:15:04] 10
[1:15:06] 20
[1:15:07] 40 50
[1:15:11] years whatever that problem is whatever
[1:15:16] that unforgiveness is whatever that
[1:15:19] ought is you fill in the blanks but the
[1:15:22] point of it is you've packed it way too
[1:15:28] long and today I hope is the day that
[1:15:33] you let it
[1:15:35] go because we can be changed cuz
[1:15:38] remember we are a Triune being of Body
[1:15:42] Spirit and soul and brother brandham
[1:15:44] taught that in that Spirit realm there's
[1:15:46] conscience memory reason imagination and
[1:15:48] affection he labeled it different things
[1:15:50] but the whole point of it is it's that
[1:15:52] Avenue of our memories
[1:15:55] right our reasoning the way we weigh
[1:15:58] things and remember you know it's like
[1:16:00] when somebody does something wrong to
[1:16:02] you and and and and and you you have a
[1:16:04] little confrontation something with
[1:16:06] somebody and they blow up and you're
[1:16:08] like what whoa
[1:16:10] whoa and you go I only did this well it
[1:16:14] wasn't what you
[1:16:17] did their
[1:16:19] reasoning is Twisted because of that
[1:16:22] trauma that happened um years
[1:16:28] ago see that's in your spirit
[1:16:31] realm and your
[1:16:33] imagination takes
[1:16:35] control and has preeminence and you
[1:16:38] think what is everybody going to
[1:16:42] think but you have to say I'm not
[1:16:45] worried look you know to me if if if you
[1:16:50] share what's on your heart to me I I
[1:16:53] really I hope you somebody could look at
[1:16:56] this and think well B brother Gabe you
[1:16:58] shouldn't even be preaching well praise
[1:17:00] the Lord maybe I shouldn't and then and
[1:17:02] that's fine too let God get a hold of me
[1:17:04] but I'm not trying to be something I
[1:17:07] don't I want to I want to be TR look
[1:17:10] today is the day of the open book right
[1:17:13] everything's revealed so why would we as
[1:17:15] ministers try to hide something if we're
[1:17:18] an open book you say my life's an open
[1:17:20] book well let it be an open
[1:17:21] book
[1:17:23] right be honest to who you are and what
[1:17:26] you're going through and the struggles
[1:17:27] because listen your neighbor right
[1:17:29] beside you may be struggling with
[1:17:31] something and the moment you open up
[1:17:33] with honesty they
[1:17:35] go yeah amen look when when I came here
[1:17:38] and brother Chad started preaching his
[1:17:40] mistakes when he was preaching on love
[1:17:41] remember that love serious yeah brother
[1:17:44] that gave me such a relief because I
[1:17:46] I've never heard a preacher that could
[1:17:48] talk about his make mistakes and problem
[1:17:51] as openly and say he failed
[1:17:55] yeah the moment that was I was like I
[1:17:59] can follow a man like
[1:18:02] that because I'm not looking for a
[1:18:05] perfect
[1:18:08] Pastor cuz I found
[1:18:10] one and I'm not looking for a perfect
[1:18:13] Prophet cuz I found
[1:18:17] one amen it's the almighty that's right
[1:18:21] he's the perfect Pastor he's the perfect
[1:18:24] Prophet people look to criticize and
[1:18:27] it's because they got their own critical
[1:18:29] spirit on the inside of them and they
[1:18:31] need Deliverance
[1:18:34] amen so in this thing of of conscience
[1:18:38] memory reasoning and
[1:18:40] Imagination the Bible tells us oh
[1:18:43] Jerusalem wash thine heart from
[1:18:46] wickedness that thou mayest be saved how
[1:18:50] long shall vain thoughts Lodge within
[1:18:54] thee
[1:18:57] and I ask you in that spirit in that
[1:19:01] second ring of your
[1:19:04] being how
[1:19:07] long would you let that
[1:19:10] imagination torment
[1:19:15] you see because Susan and
[1:19:19] I after that after that counseling
[1:19:22] section SE SE session
[1:19:25] look we had a couple of them probably
[1:19:27] going to have a few more
[1:19:30] maybe but but the thing of it is after
[1:19:32] it was all said and done we
[1:19:35] realized there wasn't no
[1:19:41] sin there's no problem between her and
[1:19:45] I but the problem
[1:19:49] is that little itty bitty
[1:19:52] boy and that itty bitty girl
[1:19:59] because remember Jesus said take up your
[1:20:04] cross deny
[1:20:06] yourself and follow
[1:20:09] me but if you have
[1:20:14] unforgiveness you can't be
[1:20:20] forgiven cuz remember it's the cross of
[1:20:26] innocency right and where does Satan C
[1:20:30] try to cause the most trauma in our
[1:20:33] lives it's when we're the most
[1:20:36] vulnerable that's right yeah right if
[1:20:39] Satan can break that Little
[1:20:42] Flower at 5 6 7 8 9 I was talking to my
[1:20:46] children the other day and and uh we was
[1:20:49] talking about you know I said listen you
[1:20:51] know we was just having a little family
[1:20:52] talking I told him I said listen I I
[1:20:54] said look if the only thing when you get
[1:20:57] older you got to cry about
[1:21:00] is my my childhood was so
[1:21:03] hard I never got to have a
[1:21:12] sleepover I told him I said you know
[1:21:15] what if that's all you got to go to
[1:21:17] brother Chad
[1:21:21] over praise the Lord Brother
[1:21:28] amen cuz my job is to protect
[1:21:31] them amen and I've heard too many horror
[1:21:34] stories about
[1:21:37] sleepovers amen right right and so my
[1:21:42] job because I know if Satan could break
[1:21:45] that
[1:21:46] flower at 78 n 10 years
[1:21:50] old because I know what was broken in me
[1:21:55] as a little
[1:21:56] boy I know the trauma that happened to
[1:22:13] me pretty cute little boy isn't
[1:22:18] he
[1:22:21] yeah but you know when you look at that
[1:22:23] little boy
[1:22:25] you may see I don't know why mom took a
[1:22:28] picture I'm trying to take care of my
[1:22:29] toes and can't even get a little
[1:22:32] pedicure and
[1:22:40] privacy so you may look at that little
[1:22:43] boy and see a smiling little
[1:22:46] boy but what you fail to
[1:22:49] see is the pain behind that smile
[1:22:55] what you fail to see is the
[1:22:58] Brokenness and the
[1:23:11] confusion
[1:23:12] but I want
[1:23:15] you to go
[1:23:18] back and your memory
[1:23:21] banks when you was a little boy or
[1:23:24] little
[1:23:25] girl and when Mom and Dad should have
[1:23:27] sheltered
[1:23:29] you instead of
[1:23:32] a parent protecting
[1:23:36] you they introduce things into your life
[1:23:39] that should not have
[1:23:44] been and the traumas
[1:23:51] that still haunt you today
[1:23:56] and you say brother
[1:23:58] Gabe I don't want to go back
[1:24:05] there but I
[1:24:07] I I can promise you this one
[1:24:11] thing if you don't go back it's never
[1:24:14] going to get any better
[1:24:25] if you don't go back to those traumas in
[1:24:29] your
[1:24:30] life look you have
[1:24:38] to you have to go back to that little
[1:24:49] boy and those traumas that are in your
[1:24:52] life you say wickedness look Wicked that
[1:24:56] wickedness it says when it talks about
[1:24:58] washing thine heart that means to
[1:25:00] perform the work of a fooler that means
[1:25:02] like a wash person and that wickedness
[1:25:05] is not like we're talking about
[1:25:07] something so much as sinful but that SI
[1:25:09] that wickedness actually could be mean
[1:25:13] sadness unhappiness
[1:25:16] unkind giving pain unhappiness misery
[1:25:20] things that were
[1:25:22] disagreeable so you have to wash your
[1:25:26] heart of all of the bad things that's
[1:25:31] been lodged within your
[1:25:37] spirit you say brother Gabe I don't want
[1:25:40] to if um if if you don't how can you
[1:25:44] have full
[1:25:46] Deliverance if you never go back and
[1:25:50] deal with the trauma that's in your life
[1:25:54] you say brother Gabe do I got to go
[1:25:55] rehash I'm not listen when we're talking
[1:25:59] about forgiveness I'm not talking about
[1:26:02] you having to go to
[1:26:04] anybody I'm talking about you setting
[1:26:07] across the table of
[1:26:12] yourself because in this little stick
[1:26:15] figure when that stick figure has that
[1:26:21] unforgiveness we we can either
[1:26:27] that's what we do in
[1:26:30] life we say you hurt me once and you'll
[1:26:32] never hurt me
[1:26:38] again but really is that
[1:26:44] living because you can bottle up but
[1:26:46] that chain is still
[1:26:50] there but there's a process that you go
[1:26:53] through
[1:26:55] of
[1:26:57] forgiveness and when cuz remember
[1:27:02] justice has to be
[1:27:07] served an eye for an eye and a tooth for
[1:27:10] a tooth and when Justice when somebody
[1:27:14] does you wrong somebody has to
[1:27:18] pay but what we as believers do we
[1:27:22] forgive when brother chadw that line and
[1:27:25] said
[1:27:26] forgiveness breaks that chain and sets
[1:27:30] you
[1:27:34] free but what do we remember forgive and
[1:27:37] you so so what we do is we take that
[1:27:41] Brokenness and we say I forgive you and
[1:27:45] I'm going to pay the
[1:27:51] price put it on my tab m
[1:27:57] amen see Jesus Remember take up your
[1:28:01] cross
[1:28:02] daily and follow
[1:28:05] me and the cross that he's talking cuz
[1:28:09] he was the innocent
[1:28:11] one he did nothing a Miss he did not
[1:28:15] deserve what happened to him it was my
[1:28:18] sins and your sins that put him there
[1:28:20] and listen whatever happened to you you
[1:28:24] have to come to that place and go I did
[1:28:27] nothing a
[1:28:28] Miss many times we'll spend years
[1:28:30] blaming ourselves it was my
[1:28:33] fault they'll twist things and you don't
[1:28:36] get up in your mind and you think it
[1:28:40] no I had to sit across the
[1:28:43] table of that little itty bitty
[1:28:47] boy and I had to say Gabriel Smith it
[1:28:51] wasn't your
[1:28:52] fault right
[1:28:56] you are
[1:28:59] innocent and when I did that it gave me
[1:29:04] such
[1:29:09] Freedom it gave me such
[1:29:12] Liberty to say it was not my
[1:29:18] fault and when you do that then you know
[1:29:22] what then I could I could really
[1:29:24] understand what Calvary was cuz I could
[1:29:26] really say yes Lord I don't need them I
[1:29:29] don't need them to apologize to
[1:29:33] me that's right cuz I'm forgiving
[1:29:39] them
[1:29:40] I I because I am a
[1:29:45] Christian I am Christlike that's
[1:29:48] right and I am forgi I'm not cutting him
[1:29:51] off never to talk to him again but I'm
[1:29:53] Rel releasing them and what that does
[1:29:56] it's really empowering because what you
[1:29:59] say is I am going to pay the
[1:30:04] price is that not what Stephen said when
[1:30:08] he was being stoned all he was doing was
[1:30:10] standing for the gospel and he was being
[1:30:12] an intercessor and he said Lord lay it
[1:30:15] not to their
[1:30:16] charge and and and and Paul Paul was
[1:30:20] standing there holding the coats
[1:30:25] but what he was doing was being an
[1:30:27] intercessor he was mediating he was
[1:30:30] portraying Christ and when we catch a
[1:30:33] revelation and we understand when we can
[1:30:35] go back to when we was a 6 8 10 12 year
[1:30:38] old little boy or girl and the most
[1:30:41] horriblest things happened to us and we
[1:30:44] was broken as broken could
[1:30:48] be but the whole you say brother Gabe I
[1:30:51] can't do it
[1:30:54] we can't that's right in our own selves
[1:30:58] that's right we
[1:31:00] cannot listen friend
[1:31:02] I I I know what pain
[1:31:06] is and I know what Brokenness
[1:31:09] is but I also know what freedom and
[1:31:12] liberty is and there is such a peace
[1:31:15] that happens when you're able to
[1:31:19] lay at that cross and say
[1:31:25] father forgive
[1:31:27] them they know not what they do you say
[1:31:32] brother Gabe how's that even possible
[1:31:34] the way that it's possible is because
[1:31:37] Christ gives us the ability that you can
[1:31:39] enter into one another's
[1:31:41] sufferings and when you enter in
[1:31:43] remember brother Braham says you got to
[1:31:45] take that person or that problem
[1:31:47] shoulder toosh shoulder and then you
[1:31:50] take them up to the presence of God the
[1:31:53] problem of it is is is we never leave
[1:31:55] our prayer
[1:31:56] closet we have to we have to get to a
[1:32:00] spot where we can from the sincerity of
[1:32:03] our heart lay those things out and then
[1:32:06] cry out to God and then the great Holy
[1:32:08] Spirit comes in and begins to minister
[1:32:11] and I'm telling you God will show you
[1:32:15] the reason why that person did you the
[1:32:17] way that that's more than just a quote
[1:32:19] friends it's reality in my life I've
[1:32:21] seen the the God show me the reason why
[1:32:25] my family is the way that they are that
[1:32:28] is more than a quote it's not just
[1:32:29] something brother brandom can do and he
[1:32:30] did it's something that could be done
[1:32:32] today in
[1:32:33] 2025 but you have to get down to
[1:32:36] business and be with with deadly
[1:32:38] sincerity meaning business I want to be
[1:32:42] real amen I don't want to be a victim
[1:32:45] anymore amen too many times we want to
[1:32:49] be a victim and we enjoy being a victim
[1:32:51] instead of being overcomer
[1:32:57] amen I I I've seen people you know you
[1:33:00] ever see some people in your home your
[1:33:01] family not my home family when you're
[1:33:03] sick they got to be
[1:33:09] sick they anything's wrong they got to
[1:33:12] have a they want to be a
[1:33:15] victim I don't want to be a
[1:33:17] victim I want to be a
[1:33:20] conqueror and we have the purpose in our
[1:33:22] heart I am not going to let lady OA
[1:33:25] defeat me I will not be chewed up and
[1:33:27] spit out I am
[1:33:36] victorious and so you have to get in
[1:33:38] that
[1:33:39] closet will it happen there the first
[1:33:42] time maybe
[1:33:43] not may take a time or
[1:33:48] two it depends upon how deep that wound
[1:33:51] really is right
[1:33:54] but if you'll be faithful God will be
[1:33:56] much more
[1:34:03] faithful so you
[1:34:06] take that broken
[1:34:08] heart and you
[1:34:16] forgive the problem of it is is we won't
[1:34:19] forgive till that person
[1:34:21] changes right
[1:34:25] but forgiveness is not based upon what
[1:34:27] that person does Amen you say brother
[1:34:31] Gabe but they was a preach I don't stop
[1:34:34] stop don't put conditions on your
[1:34:37] forgiveness yeah right it don't matter
[1:34:40] what they did it's not
[1:34:43] between the Lord you and them you you
[1:34:46] cut them off it's over with and now you
[1:34:50] are left holding the back broken heart
[1:34:53] in all that's
[1:34:56] right but now with
[1:34:59] that you're starting to understand what
[1:35:02] Calvary was all
[1:35:08] about amen you say brother Gabe that's
[1:35:11] that's that's not easy
[1:35:13] no that's why most people never go there
[1:35:17] right but I believe you're called Amen
[1:35:20] to a higher calling amen you're called
[1:35:24] to rise above all the darkness of Lady
[1:35:26] Osa
[1:35:28] amen amen you are called to be a mighty
[1:35:32] conqueror that's right you're not called
[1:35:34] to be a
[1:35:36] victim you're called to be the Spotless
[1:35:40] chosen amen bride of Jesus
[1:35:43] Christ but in order to come to that true
[1:35:46] position we have to deal with all of the
[1:35:51] Brokenness in our house
[1:35:54] and in our own individual
[1:35:57] lives and it's not
[1:36:01] easy is it going to be a one anddone
[1:36:04] situation probably
[1:36:06] not is it going to be something that
[1:36:09] just you know snap of a finger
[1:36:12] no a lot of times you know a lot of time
[1:36:15] you remember the you remember the the
[1:36:18] Good Samaritan and the man that that was
[1:36:20] uh uh beaten and left half dead remember
[1:36:24] who who was the first person to come
[1:36:26] by it's the priest the ministry and what
[1:36:31] did the ministry
[1:36:34] do I want no part of
[1:36:40] that and then what was the next person
[1:36:43] that come by it's the
[1:36:46] levite just like we do want no part of
[1:36:50] that leave that to somebody else
[1:36:56] and so what could have been handled now
[1:36:58] it's
[1:37:00] multifaceted because instead of
[1:37:01] addressing that problem at the root when
[1:37:04] it first happened now there's time and
[1:37:07] distance and all these variables become
[1:37:10] to get intertwined upon it and now it
[1:37:14] becomes so
[1:37:20] complex but there was a Samaritan
[1:37:24] that said I'll get my hands
[1:37:27] dirty I'll help
[1:37:29] them and the only thing he could do with
[1:37:31] that wound is pulling the oil and the
[1:37:34] wine that's
[1:37:36] right and that's really all that's I
[1:37:39] hope that's what I'm doing this morning
[1:37:41] is just pouring in the oil and the
[1:37:44] wine
[1:37:45] right and then all I can do is take you
[1:37:48] where you're here right now the end
[1:37:51] brother B said that's the church right
[1:37:54] all I can do is put you on the Beast
[1:37:57] which is that lamb that had been slain
[1:37:59] with seven eyes and seven horns that's
[1:38:02] the power that I can take you to and say
[1:38:04] look it worked for me I know it can work
[1:38:08] for
[1:38:12] you and then he says give him two pant
[1:38:14] brother brother said I think he said
[1:38:16] spirit and
[1:38:18] truth right that's all we can really do
[1:38:22] but
[1:38:25] what we have to come to a spot
[1:38:27] is sometimes it's not anybody that's
[1:38:30] done you
[1:38:31] wrong cuz really in reality the hardest
[1:38:34] person to
[1:38:36] forgive is
[1:38:41] yourself you know some some of us would
[1:38:44] make very good
[1:38:47] Catholics
[1:38:51] right all kind of beas and Cat N Tails
[1:38:57] and
[1:38:59] right all well we wouldn't we wouldn't
[1:39:01] say we're Catholics but uh how many
[1:39:04] times do we in in our own on the
[1:39:07] inside constantly beating ourselves up
[1:39:13] and friends you got to let it
[1:39:17] go cuz the thing of it is if you don't
[1:39:21] not only is it going to hinder you but
[1:39:23] it's it's going to hinder your home yeah
[1:39:25] amen and if you never deal with that
[1:39:27] then guess what your pro your family's
[1:39:29] going to have to deal with that problem
[1:39:32] cuz no matter how hard you try it you're
[1:39:33] going to pass it on to
[1:39:39] them we we have to be we have to be
[1:39:43] mindful
[1:39:46] of of the the baggage that we
[1:39:50] carry and a lot of times
[1:39:54] you know in this thing called life we
[1:39:57] can we can be
[1:40:00] so
[1:40:03] um burdened
[1:40:06] down
[1:40:09] with whatever is hindering us that we
[1:40:13] can't see before our
[1:40:15] face and when everybody's happy we're
[1:40:18] miserable right there's never no joy the
[1:40:23] GL glass is always half
[1:40:25] empty and we can have such a pessimistic
[1:40:29] attitude that we miss our opportunity
[1:40:32] for
[1:40:33] Joy when when brother brandham talks
[1:40:36] about Johnny
[1:40:38] Crow you remember Johnny Crow
[1:40:42] right brother
[1:40:44] benam brother benam talked about there
[1:40:47] was a a a cruel man that captured a crow
[1:40:51] one day and
[1:40:53] tied a rope around his leg and tied into
[1:40:55] a
[1:40:56] post poor old
[1:41:00] Johnny he can only go so
[1:41:03] far God sent a
[1:41:08] prophet I can only go this right here
[1:41:11] this is what we believe right God sent a
[1:41:14] prophet denomination look if we're still
[1:41:17] tied we're still
[1:41:19] tied but there was a kind man that saw
[1:41:22] that Crow
[1:41:24] and he set that Crow
[1:41:27] free but Johnny Crow had been tied so
[1:41:31] long that once he was free he could only
[1:41:34] go as far as that string would allow him
[1:41:39] but really where was he
[1:41:41] captive he was captive Amen in the
[1:41:45] prison of his own
[1:41:47] mind Johnny had been chained so
[1:41:50] long that that's all he could see well
[1:41:53] this is the far as I've ever got this is
[1:41:55] for everybody that's not for me that's
[1:41:57] for everybody else and this is right you
[1:42:01] say brother Gabe you you you you you
[1:42:04] know I understand what you've been
[1:42:05] through but my situation is
[1:42:11] different oh
[1:42:18] really can you really be honest with
[1:42:20] yourself and say your situation is
[1:42:22] different
[1:42:23] you say brother Gabe my wound is deeper
[1:42:25] than your wound and that may be
[1:42:30] so and I would never
[1:42:33] ever try to discredit the pain that
[1:42:36] you're
[1:42:36] [Music]
[1:42:38] under
[1:42:41] but are you telling me that your pain is
[1:42:44] greater than the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:42:48] Christ are you telling me that your
[1:42:51] wound your problem whatever it is your
[1:42:54] trauma are you telling me that it that
[1:42:57] right there in itself is greater than
[1:43:00] the
[1:43:02] almighty you know sometimes sometimes in
[1:43:05] life you know we we I love I love the
[1:43:09] discernments brother brandham he is he I
[1:43:13] love the Lord Jesus so much because a
[1:43:16] lot of times we look at people and we go
[1:43:18] well why in the world are they
[1:43:19] struggling you may look and say well
[1:43:21] brother Gabe just you know yeah you ever
[1:43:23] look at somebody and go just get over
[1:43:26] it
[1:43:28] anybody well let let me let me share
[1:43:31] this with
[1:43:34] you and and I'm going to try to wrap it
[1:43:36] up is this
[1:43:38] okay
[1:43:40] so uh just just a portion of it brother
[1:43:44] brandom in 1950 he he's uh he's in
[1:43:47] discernment and as brother brandom is
[1:43:49] Discerning this boy uh this young I'm
[1:43:51] sorry this man he he starts telling him
[1:43:54] that he said that he had a few troubles
[1:43:56] and you can read the whole thing but
[1:43:57] this is just a portion he said inward
[1:43:59] troubles and uh he talks about some
[1:44:01] things that he was trying to overcome
[1:44:03] and overcome and then he had a nervous
[1:44:06] condition and uh but I but I want you to
[1:44:08] look at what he what he starts tapping
[1:44:11] into because when the angel of the Lord
[1:44:15] starts Discerning this man's heart he
[1:44:18] tells him he says when you was a child a
[1:44:21] little boy with knee pants on you got
[1:44:25] problems or something he says I believe
[1:44:26] it's a dog that chased
[1:44:30] you or something isn't that right a big
[1:44:35] dog and you run to a porch is that right
[1:44:38] I see it as a little boy is that the
[1:44:40] truth all right who who would know that
[1:44:42] but God alone isn't that but right
[1:44:46] now so you got to
[1:44:49] think the Almighty
[1:44:53] can you imagine you stand before the
[1:44:55] almighty and out of all your problems of
[1:45:00] life he tells you there was a dog
[1:45:03] chasing
[1:45:05] you now we would look at that and
[1:45:09] go it's just a dog get over
[1:45:13] it toughen
[1:45:18] up come
[1:45:20] on yeah oh yeah yes right but let me ask
[1:45:26] you did the angel of the Lord tell him
[1:45:29] to toughen
[1:45:31] up no see a lot of times we like to
[1:45:36] judge people according to our
[1:45:38] grit right
[1:45:43] right we say he's supposed to be a
[1:45:49] man but see we're all built different
[1:45:52] right
[1:45:53] right and and what may be easy for you
[1:45:56] to
[1:45:57] overcome may not be easy for me to
[1:46:01] overcome and sometimes we have to step
[1:46:04] back and stop with that judgmental
[1:46:08] attitude and realize every one of us is
[1:46:12] made up different and some of us have
[1:46:15] strengths and weaknesses I know some of
[1:46:18] you just got all strengths right
[1:46:21] right you pray for us weak ones that's
[1:46:24] right
[1:46:27] right but when I hear that Prophet say
[1:46:30] these things it gives me
[1:46:33] Insight that when I see my brother or my
[1:46:36] sister my
[1:46:37] wife I I know I know the reason why I
[1:46:41] say one of the reasons the Lord didn't
[1:46:43] give me no
[1:46:48] boys he give me three little angels
[1:46:53] am but the re I believe the reason why
[1:46:57] is because he knew how he knew my
[1:46:59] makeup cuz if I had a boy you know I
[1:47:03] might be a little too hard on
[1:47:05] him so God gave me three little angels
[1:47:10] to Tender me
[1:47:13] up
[1:47:14] see and and so what God gives you he
[1:47:18] places these things in your life so that
[1:47:21] so that you
[1:47:23] will tender
[1:47:25] up and then God points things out like
[1:47:28] these so that we'll have a different
[1:47:30] perspective because when I read that I
[1:47:32] got to go wait a
[1:47:35] minute
[1:47:36] everyone needs
[1:47:39] Grace because what you may think is easy
[1:47:42] to
[1:47:43] overcome that's because you're looking
[1:47:45] through it through your
[1:47:48] eyes when you stand before the if you
[1:47:51] stood before the angel Lord he may
[1:47:52] discern Lear something different but
[1:47:55] what was the core root of that grown
[1:47:58] man his nervousness come
[1:48:01] from him being a little boy right and
[1:48:05] chased by a dog yeah and you would think
[1:48:10] what but but what may be little to
[1:48:15] you was great big to
[1:48:20] him right
[1:48:23] and
[1:48:24] so to me what I love about this message
[1:48:27] is it gives us Insight so that we ought
[1:48:29] to have a heart of
[1:48:32] compassion because what you can overcome
[1:48:35] that may be easy to me it may be a
[1:48:40] struggle amen right and so and so if if
[1:48:45] when when you when you come across
[1:48:48] people that that that have problems or
[1:48:50] there's some kinde of you know
[1:48:53] situation or some kind of
[1:48:55] problem look I I hope this thing to me
[1:49:00] it makes me approach it differently
[1:49:03] sir because not everybody's built like
[1:49:12] you and so we ought to look at people
[1:49:14] differently and go let's have some
[1:49:18] Grace for that
[1:49:20] person because what they're struggling
[1:49:23] with is absolutely real to them it may
[1:49:28] not be real to you but the thing of it
[1:49:31] is what you don't understand is all of
[1:49:35] the intricacy of their life that's cuz
[1:49:40] you can't see you you look at this man
[1:49:43] and he's nervous and he acts up and you
[1:49:45] go why is he acting like that but see if
[1:49:47] you had eyes like that angel did right
[1:49:51] you would be able to see he's just a
[1:49:54] scared little
[1:49:56] boy you know that that that coworker
[1:49:59] that's always blasting you and always
[1:50:02] trying to get you worked up cuz you're a
[1:50:06] Christian you know I hope something like
[1:50:09] this
[1:50:10] maybe makes you look at him
[1:50:13] differently tomorrow
[1:50:16] morning because he may be tatted up neck
[1:50:20] tattoos sleeved out with tats and
[1:50:23] big muscle builder and but you know what
[1:50:26] what he really
[1:50:28] is he's a scared little boy that's right
[1:50:31] that's right he's a scared little
[1:50:34] boy that had some trauma when he was
[1:50:37] little and so what he's trying to do
[1:50:40] he's trying to scare you with his
[1:50:42] tattoos right you know what those
[1:50:45] muscles are they hurt me but they'll
[1:50:48] never hurt me again right that's right
[1:50:51] you know what that shave is head is with
[1:50:53] the see you look at him and go you can
[1:50:55] sit in the seat of the
[1:50:58] scornful you know the problem of it is
[1:51:01] you're looking at your perfect home with
[1:51:03] a perfect mom and dad that was always in
[1:51:05] the message and never you you were
[1:51:08] sheltered and mom and dad always Tu you
[1:51:10] to church and you can you can look at
[1:51:11] that person all tatted out and sleeved
[1:51:13] out and big muscles and all dressed in
[1:51:16] black and you can sit in the seat of a
[1:51:17] scornful but if you have a heart amen
[1:51:21] amen
[1:51:25] you can see them all drugged out do you
[1:51:27] realize those drugs are the only
[1:51:31] happiness that they have
[1:51:37] amen that abuse that they are and
[1:51:39] they're raging out and you know do you
[1:51:43] realize it's because they didn't have
[1:51:46] the
[1:51:46] Sheltering love and protection that you
[1:51:50] had that's right right
[1:51:55] see we no matter how thin you slice it
[1:51:57] there's two sides to
[1:52:00] it and
[1:52:01] we if we would stop cuz remember with
[1:52:05] what judgment you judge it's going to be
[1:52:08] judged back to you and you have a
[1:52:11] greater accountability because what much
[1:52:14] is given much
[1:52:16] is required
[1:52:19] amen and so if anything we ought to have
[1:52:21] Grace for him
[1:52:23] because we don't
[1:52:25] know the pain that that man has been
[1:52:28] through and if we I when when we when I
[1:52:32] see people lashing out like that I look
[1:52:35] at them
[1:52:37] differently when when when people when
[1:52:39] people you know the the the problem the
[1:52:42] problems in in the job those are the
[1:52:45] ones that I try to
[1:52:47] crack because I realize all they are is
[1:52:52] a scared little
[1:52:55] boy and if I could really set across
[1:52:58] across him and talk to him and get them
[1:53:00] to open up I would find a scared little
[1:53:05] boy that's
[1:53:07] right and to me this message has given
[1:53:11] me I believe it's the holy spirit gives
[1:53:14] us a heart but the thing of it is is we
[1:53:17] have to enter in to one another's
[1:53:20] sufferings
[1:53:22] we have to have a heart of
[1:53:24] compassion that even though that that
[1:53:27] that dog chase doesn't seem like a big
[1:53:30] deal we have to be able to realize that
[1:53:33] it was a big deal to
[1:53:37] them you know maybe we could stand
[1:53:45] together you know
[1:53:55] you know a lot of times uh when we uh
[1:54:00] think about um the
[1:54:05] uh the
[1:54:08] acceptable day of the Lord and year
[1:54:10] release and the year Jubilee and and we
[1:54:14] always think you know when we hear that
[1:54:16] you know every seven years the when the
[1:54:18] trumpet sound the the uh the slave could
[1:54:23] throw down his hoe and go free
[1:54:26] right and we always look at that person
[1:54:29] as musicians if they' come and and and
[1:54:32] as as uh as we look at this we look at
[1:54:35] that person and see them throw down
[1:54:38] their hoe and we always look at that
[1:54:39] person and go oh man yeah that's
[1:54:42] me but you know if you think about it
[1:54:45] what about the one that that servant was
[1:54:49] serving
[1:54:55] because that
[1:54:58] man had
[1:55:01] servants he had people that did the jobs
[1:55:03] for
[1:55:06] him amen how many times did that trumpet
[1:55:09] sound and the person that had to let him
[1:55:11] go free goes
[1:55:19] oh can we pray we song that song the Sun
[1:55:21] is up
[1:55:23] you know that this song just touched my
[1:55:25] heart last service they had sung it and
[1:55:28] it and it just went right with it
[1:55:30] because we think the Sun is up and I can
[1:55:33] go free but I want you to look at it
[1:55:35] differently at the one that has to let
[1:55:38] them go free that's
[1:55:40] good because we always look at the slave
[1:55:44] but the one that had him let go was was
[1:55:46] an Israelite
[1:55:47] too right and so it was going to cost
[1:55:52] him yeah that's right amen that's right
[1:55:56] yeah and so when it came to costing him
[1:55:59] as you read in Deuteronomy over and over
[1:56:02] in the scriptures God would tell him so
[1:56:05] beautiful I I I don't I I don't want to
[1:56:07] take time to read it all but but when
[1:56:10] you would when you would look in
[1:56:12] Deuteronomy over and over God would tell
[1:56:16] them
[1:56:17] beware that there be not a thought in
[1:56:20] thy Wicked heart saying the seventh year
[1:56:23] the year of release is at hand and then
[1:56:26] I be evil against
[1:56:32] thy poor
[1:56:34] brother and thou givest him not cuz
[1:56:37] remember when when you let them go you
[1:56:39] wasn't just supposed to send them on
[1:56:40] their own but you were supposed to
[1:56:42] supply them liberally of all your
[1:56:48] flocks see we want to go free
[1:56:53] but there's also a double-edged
[1:56:56] sword forgive that's right and you shall
[1:57:00] be forgiven amen amen right so there's a
[1:57:05] part of this that that that God would
[1:57:09] tell them over and
[1:57:12] over because this thing that the Lord
[1:57:14] thy God shall bless thee they had to
[1:57:17] have faith and
[1:57:19] release yeah amen them knowing that God
[1:57:24] would honor that and then bless them in
[1:57:27] return and all throughout the scriptures
[1:57:31] God would tell them open your hand
[1:57:35] wide amen
[1:57:38] amen right he would also tell them over
[1:57:42] and over in
[1:57:44] Deuteronomy when they would come to that
[1:57:46] year of
[1:57:47] release he would remind them in verse 14
[1:57:51] of of 8 chapter
[1:57:53] then thy heart be lifted up and thou
[1:57:54] forget the Lord thy God which brought
[1:57:56] thee out of the land of Egypt from the
[1:57:59] house of bondage God would tell that
[1:58:02] Passover was a remembrance that you come
[1:58:04] from Egypt and don't you
[1:58:08] forget where you come
[1:58:11] from several scriptures in Deuteronomy
[1:58:13] God would constantly remind them
[1:58:15] remember that
[1:58:17] you was a bondman one time you come from
[1:58:21] the T Masters you had the sin of of of
[1:58:25] the devil upon your life but God was
[1:58:28] merciful enough to set you free now you
[1:58:32] have to have that same forgiveness amen
[1:58:37] and Liberty cuz remember the release is
[1:58:40] in your hands yeah right you have to be
[1:58:44] able to
[1:58:46] release that's to me I I I I just let's
[1:58:51] sing it together
[1:58:55] yeah let's sing
[1:58:58] it son is
[1:59:01] up now I can go
[1:59:05] free these chains that were holding me I
[1:59:11] can no longer see heard A Long trumpet
[1:59:17] sound
[1:59:18] declaring my juile
[1:59:22] all that I once had again is restored to
[1:59:28] me the price has been

[2:01:37] free this
[2:01:40] [Music]
[2:01:43] morning you know I I don't I don't think
[2:01:47] the Lord
[2:01:49] would put this on my heart to bring it a
[2:01:52] couple weeks after our pastor did along
[2:01:54] the same lines just to repeat
[2:02:01] something but if it's something you've

[2:04:08] slice it sometimes we can look at it in
[2:04:10] the wrong
[2:04:12] [Music]
[2:04:14] angle but I pray this morning that God
[2:04:17] would change your angle and your Vantage
[2:04:20] Point

[2:05:05] mediator ask for him to

[2:05:11] it and realize what may be broken is
[2:05:16] what needs to be fixed first in you
[2:05:22] I'd encourage you this morning to humble
[2:05:26] yourself stop pointing at everybody
[2:05:29] else and start looking at the man or the
[2:05:33] sister in the
[2:05:35] mirror we're all but feeble human beings
[2:05:39] there's only one great
[2:05:41] one and he wants to deal with whatever
[2:05:44] is broken in your life but he has a
[2:05:47] provided way

[2:06:27] restoration that I
[2:06:30] see in my

[2:06:35] of my brothers and
[2:06:39] [Music]
[2:06:41] sisters I pray
[2:06:44] that your great Holy
[2:06:47] Spirit would not miss an a this
[2:06:52] [Music]
[2:06:55] morning Lord that you
[2:06:57] would help
[2:07:00] us to open every door in our
[2:07:03] heart even the ones that
[2:07:07] we've had padlock for
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:13] years that one that's way at the end of
[2:07:17] the
[2:07:19] hall help us Lord
[2:07:23] to walk with you down that
[2:07:26] lonely
[2:07:31] Corridor
[2:07:33] God I pray
[2:07:35] that you'd help us
[2:07:38] to grab the
[2:07:42] key cuz you won't force your way in
[2:07:44] you're a
[2:07:47] gentleman but I pray that he' give us
[2:07:51] Grace Grace and Faith
[2:07:53] that we'd be able
[2:07:55] to
[2:07:59] unlock those locks on that
[2:08:05] door and we' open it up
[2:08:08] and as the tears
[2:08:12] flow down our
[2:08:16] [Music]
[2:08:18] cheeks I
[2:08:20] pray that you would be
[2:08:24] there to wipe our
[2:08:27] [Music]
[2:08:30] eyes and
[2:08:32] Minister as only you
[2:08:34] [Music]
[2:08:37] can Lord
[2:08:40] uh I don't know how many's broken this
[2:08:45] morning but I know there's too many here
[2:08:48] for there not just to be at least one
[2:08:53] and I pray
[2:08:56] that wherever that one
[2:09:00] is they
[2:09:03] wouldn't be able to feel the oil and
[2:09:07] wine pouring into that
[2:09:14] Brokenness
[2:09:15] and that healing would begin
[2:09:22] I pray
[2:09:25] Lord young and old alike
[2:09:28] [Music]
[2:09:30] that it
[2:09:33] would be a
[2:09:35] [Music]
[2:09:36] difference and that the change would
[2:09:40] be great in their
[2:09:45] [Music]
[2:09:46] life I pray that a testimony
[2:09:50] [Music]
[2:09:51] may never be spoken in the
[2:09:55] church may just be a personal
[2:09:58] testimony but I pray that there would be
[2:10:02] a quietness and a rest and a peace that
[2:10:06] comes after the trial after the
[2:10:10] counsel after the
[2:10:13] unlocking Lord I I know it's
[2:10:17] possible all things are possible
[2:10:21] possible to them that
[2:10:24] believe and we are believers this
[2:10:28] morning in this Broken Age that we live
[2:10:32] You promis full
[2:10:35] restoration and we by your
[2:10:38] grace are
[2:10:42] recipients help us
[2:10:45] Lord to believe
[2:10:47] that and to continue Lord walking with
[2:10:52] you day by
[2:10:54] day hour by hour minute by
[2:11:00] minute longing
[2:11:04] for that morning between 6 and
[2:11:07] [Music]
[2:11:11] 9 when
[2:11:14] [Music]
[2:11:16] we'll see this world in its condition
[2:11:22] for it last
[2:11:24] [Music]
[2:11:27] time when those Skies
[2:11:30] open wide one
[2:11:33] day I pray that each one of us Lord
[2:11:37] would have this kind of
[2:11:39] forgiveness that you're
[2:11:43] requiring if we'd have this kind of
[2:11:45] freedom and
[2:11:47] liberty and that we could be the right
[2:11:50] kind of an intercessor
[2:11:52] we' take these pains of our lives
[2:11:57] and see
[2:12:00] that we can use that
[2:12:05] pain and see the purpose that it was
[2:12:08] given so that we might be able to
[2:12:12] encourage
[2:12:13] others that suffer those same kind of
[2:12:17] pains and we'd be able to open up Lord
[2:12:20] and not be
[2:12:23] ashamed but see that you're still a
[2:12:26] delivering
[2:12:28] God and that you can take those hurts in
[2:12:31] our
[2:12:32] [Music]
[2:12:35] lives you can bring
[2:12:38] healing you can bring
[2:12:43] forgiveness God we love
[2:12:47] you pray for each one this morning
[2:12:51] we ask these Saints to be
[2:12:54] so the mighty unfailing name of our Lord
[2:12:57] and
[2:12:59] Savior Jesus
[2:13:02] Christ
[2:13:04] amen can we sing it again the Sun is
[2:13:10] up now I can go
[2:13:13] free the chains that were
[2:13:18] holding I can no long mer heard A Long
[2:13:23] trumpet
[2:13:25] sound
[2:13:27] declaring
[2:13:29] my all that I
[2:13:33] want again
[2:13:35] is to me the price has been
[2:13:40] paid all my washed away be happy to pray
[2:13:45] with you now and for
[2:13:48] [Music]
[2:13:52] the
[2:13:54] Sun is up once
[2:13:59] more now the Sun is
[2:14:04] up I can go
[2:14:07] free the chains that were holding me I
[2:14:13] can no longer see heard A Long trumpet
[2:14:18] sound declaring
[2:14:21] my
[2:14:22] jubile all that I once had again is
[2:14:28] restor to me price has been
[2:14:33] paid all my sins washed
[2:14:38] away now and
[2:14:45] for the Sun is up
[2:14:52] amen God bless you all and I appreciate
[2:14:55] brother Gabe and the gift that God's put
[2:14:58] in him and his willingness to open up
[2:15:00] and
[2:15:01] share I
[2:15:03] learned I found that
[2:15:05] God he's a Healer he's a
[2:15:09] deliverer and he wants us to go
[2:15:12] free I believe the same way brother Gabe
[2:15:15] that there's no God's not a waster of
[2:15:17] our time and he's not one who is just is
[2:15:21] going to repeat a subject for the sake
[2:15:23] of repeating it but he brings it
[2:15:25] differently puts it wraps it into a
[2:15:27] different package and he fleshes it out
[2:15:29] in a different way so that we can see
[2:15:31] what he's trying to tell us and I
[2:15:34] believe that's what God is doing for us
[2:15:36] and I personally believe it's because he
[2:15:38] wants us to go
[2:15:40] free God brings these things to us
[2:15:43] because there's a time there's an
[2:15:44] appointed time for God and in that time
[2:15:47] for those of us who are here maybe it's
[2:15:50] not everybody but some at least that God
[2:15:53] has said it's been long
[2:15:55] enough that I want to give you a path to
[2:15:59] freedom but like brother Gabe said it's
[2:16:01] not he's a gentleman he doesn't Force
[2:16:03] he's given us a path to Freedom the
[2:16:05] question is are we willing to go there
[2:16:08] are we willing to take advantage of the
[2:16:10] opportunity that's presented to
[2:16:12] us because I believe God wants an
[2:16:15] expression out of our lives he wants
[2:16:17] these vessels of clay to manifest his
[2:16:20] own life
[2:16:20] [Music]
[2:16:22] and sometimes there's something that's
[2:16:23] hindering that expression because of a
[2:16:25] wound in the spirit realm that's got us
[2:16:28] in a certain frame of mind and we're
[2:16:30] reacting in a certain
[2:16:33] way and if there's anything in our lives
[2:16:35] that's hindering the expression of
[2:16:38] Christ I want it out of my
[2:16:40] life if it's somehow marring that
[2:16:43] expression or limiting how much of
[2:16:45] Christ can be expressed I don't want
[2:16:48] that to remain there because I want to
[2:16:51] an empty vessel that he can fill and he
[2:16:53] can manifest himself through so if God's
[2:16:56] got to bring some healing to my heart
[2:16:58] and deliverance for the spirit realm
[2:17:00] amen I want him to have his way with me
[2:17:03] and free me so that I can more fully
[2:17:05] Express his life in
[2:17:08] me
[2:17:10] amen thought it was so good today I'm
[2:17:13] not going to add any more to that I'm
[2:17:14] just going to just just implore you if
[2:17:16] God's dealing with your heart give him
[2:17:18] some time just give him some time
[2:17:22] give him some time now as you sit in
[2:17:23] your seat and pray or come to the altar
[2:17:26] pray standing give him some time when
[2:17:28] you get home or tomorrow God's dealing
[2:17:30] in your heart give him some
[2:17:33] time and let him work a heart
[2:17:36] surgery it may not as brother Gabe said
[2:17:38] it may not be instant it may not be a
[2:17:40] five minute but if you've recognized
[2:17:42] there's something that God wants to heal
[2:17:44] give him some time to do the work and I
[2:17:48] just want to encourage you with that as
[2:17:49] we part man I just want to pray a prayer
[2:17:52] of Thanksgiving if we could just bow our
[2:17:54] heads together and say Lord thank you
[2:17:56] for your
[2:17:58] word god you deliver a word intending
[2:18:02] for it to be
[2:18:03] received you give it out because there's
[2:18:06] somebody that will be the receiver the
[2:18:09] recipient and God we just want to Bow
[2:18:11] our heads and thank you for giving us a
[2:18:13] portion of yourself
[2:18:15] today understanding and Enlightenment
[2:18:17] and encouragement and
[2:18:19] healing and God I want to be a recipient
[2:18:22] of that word I want to be a receiver
[2:18:24] Lord for you didn't send it in vain and
[2:18:27] your word will not return to your Void
[2:18:30] but you send it out and it will
[2:18:32] accomplish what you sent it for and I'm
[2:18:35] asking Lord that you would accomplish it
[2:18:36] in
[2:18:38] me I bow my head and raise my hands as a
[2:18:42] recipient I want to grab this word and I
[2:18:44] want to I want it to be applied in my
[2:18:47] life Lord I want that
[2:18:49] freedom and I want to be willing to play
[2:18:51] the part of Christ I want to do what you
[2:18:53] did on Calvary I want to let others Go
[2:18:58] free I want to be willing to pay the
[2:19:01] price for there's many who robbed from
[2:19:04] me innocency they took it away from me
[2:19:07] corrupting and polluting my mind abusing
[2:19:09] my spirit realm they took away my
[2:19:11] innocency as a
[2:19:13] child but God they took away your
[2:19:16] innocency for you had done nothing wrong
[2:19:19] they abused you and tortured you so that
[2:19:23] I could go
[2:19:24] free they robbed me of a precious
[2:19:27] innocent
[2:19:28] mind innocent eyes and innocent heart
[2:19:31] and innocent
[2:19:32] body many people here were robbed of
[2:19:35] their innocency
[2:19:36] Lord but you were willing to give your
[2:19:39] innocency for my
[2:19:41] salvation and God I want to give my
[2:19:43] innocency for their
[2:19:46] forgiveness would you forgive them
[2:19:48] Lord and help me to be willing Lord by
[2:19:51] your spirit would you come and Empower
[2:19:53] Us by your own Spirit to model what you
[2:19:56] did you modeled it for us may we now
[2:19:58] replicate
[2:20:00] it and God for we know there's a secret
[2:20:04] that lays inside of us that you've
[2:20:05] opened at the end time God you've
[2:20:08] restored Our
[2:20:09] innocency God it may have been taken as
[2:20:13] a child but you've given it back by your
[2:20:15] blood and you've washed us with this
[2:20:18] word Lord and you've called us your
[2:20:19] sinless virt you a spotless bride and
[2:20:22] you told us we never did it in the first
[2:20:25] place God no matter what man has taken
[2:20:27] from us you've restored it already

[2:20:51] hold of what's permanent and real and
[2:20:53] eternal God help us to come to the
[2:20:56] realization of what you've done for

[2:21:13] us
