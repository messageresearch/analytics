people on the earth father lord i just pray that you would take this evening lord take my inability and my insufficiency and lord as it were like one time with a master that could pick up a violin he

you want to say lord to feed your sheep father we love you we commit this entire evening into your hands in jesus name amen amen you may be seated for just a little bit um well first off always appreciate the opportunity to come and talk with you a little bit this evening and i uh just felt so good today i it's just that how many enjoyed the day yeah oh yeah oh my yeah it's it was a beautiful beautiful day and i can't think of a better way to cap off a beautiful day than to go to church i just can't think of a better way than to be to to go in the evening time and the cool of the evening and just gather one with another our little licks of fire and just feed from his hand i just honestly can't think of a better thing for us to be doing it i hope it's all right i just want to share a few things i had gotten and i do want to say this i brother said you don't know what i'm preaching right yeah so he opened with psalms 100 and i just want to read the last the portion of there know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves ain't nothing i've done in myself i he did it all we are his people and the sheep of his pasture and i i i i wanna brother franco i didn't i don't wanna i said to brother franco don't show this powerpoint i'm just gonna use it as my notes but brother franco maybe you could put up just the first um picture so this is my subject tonight that brother chad knows nothing about and uh i i just was so um i'm just gonna be me i was so enjoying the day and i was really just thanking the lord for my sonship i was thanking the lord that you know hey i belong to you i i'm not like everybody else you know you know the world right now they're in chaos they don't know what to do you know political parties they both got kindergartners as their heads and you know it's just a mess right now you know and and everybody knows and if that's your hope that's your your strength you know you're in trouble and they know they're in trouble like the whole world knows they're in trouble and but we're not in trouble we i i'm one of his sheep and when he called i'm one he elected i'm one he caught he carried me right out of darkness and brought me into this marvelous light you know and that so it's my entire thought tonight it's just my entire thought is just i want to bask in the glory of the sheep of his pasture and i want to talk about that lamb and being one of his lambs the opportunity of being one of his lambs and then the responsibility of being one of his lambs because in his step as a shepherd we want to follow in his footsteps so we're not only lambs but we're shepherds in one sort of way we're not all pastors we're not all ministers but you do have a certain portion of you of god in you that you are shepherding you're helping i think the word shepherd in that i looked it up air force air force guys may know this a shepherd um a plane that is shepherding another one it could be another plane that's wounded i saw this when i was studying it today a a plane that is wounded or it's been hit by emini m yeah fire they'll send forth a shepherd plane and that shepherd plane's whole job and responsibility that point is to be the protection for this wounded plane to get it back to base and i thought well i like that because each and every one of us at different points we're a shepherd and it's in that line and duty of a shepherd god can use us to do things you never thought possible it's in that simplicity it's always hidden in such a simplicity of just taking care of the sheep just taking care of the sheep so we're going to get to that but i was so encouraged you know i was just back there praying lord i don't know how to do this i don't really want to do this maybe brother chad could just keep on going you know he said he like had something ah you know and then he just drops that in there i said well okay if that's what he wants that's what we talk about tonight so we're gonna back up here [Music] and i wanted to say this and i hope this all right i had a little a little thing that struck me today and it was like a little sermonette and i was outside looking at all those beautiful trees and they're just shining in the radiance of their beauty right now with all the colors of the rainbow just shining the way they are and i if you have one ounce of god i don't know inside of you i don't think you can go out inside of nature right now and just be in awe of his presence and i was sitting there looking at and i kind of in my mind was playing a little story i was like you know what if i came in i said now how did you produce such beauty all these trees you know and all their different variabilities you have the oak trees you have the hickories you have every one of them and they're shining in their magnificat magnificence a little bit of a different color and they're all individually different but together they make like this beautiful bouquet this beautiful scenery just like the children of god we're all individually uniquely different in and of ourself but we're feeding off the same life right all life comes from god the life that was in all those trees came from god they all have this portion of life but it's manifesting and it's displaying in a different radiance in a different glory the same life just in a different way just like each and every one of us and if i could ask those trees you know what's making you so beautiful right now it's a it's nothing i've done it's just uh it's just the life that's inside of me manifested this way it's just an expression of the seed that i i was you know and that just gives you kind of a little confidence it's it's really not him that willeth or him that run it's just god it's just god doing something in and through us not anything we've ever done i i can't produce the christian life it's not me it's just something inside of me expressing itself to the world it takes all the pressure off the sum of a christian life is rest it's not me it's just something behind me pushing me expressing itself right and you get to look at those trees and say well praise god you know but you know all of us would look at them and say well they're most beautiful right now they're most beautiful why are they most beautiful right now because they're dying they're expressing death now we know that to be the truth and i don't think i ever have seen something that i have admired more in the lord jesus christ it was beautiful to see him raise the dead i loved it when he could heal the blind and do those many things but when he could stand there and let him them crucify him they never he let them do that let them rip his beard out let them him spit in their face he stood there and took death for you and me and that's when it was most beautiful and i have yet to ever i think in my life see anything more beautiful than to see the christian who starts to take up his cross it says now it's not my will it's thine will be done there could be a lot of things expressed that you said that's awesome you could raise the dead you could do a lot of things but when you stand there before a cross and you say it's not my will but it's thy will be done i don't know if there's anything more beautiful than that i really don't and uh so you know it's just you get sermons just going out in nature right now and and then the only last the last little thought part i had online i said now it's dying but you know if i ask that what's really going on he says oh i'm just going the life inside me is just going back where it was it's just going back you know why because winter's coming i've got a hiding place the storms of life are coming but god provided a way i'm going back to where i came from i'm going back into the roots that i came out of because there's a storm coming i'm safely hidden in his presence psalms 27 see the whole bible speaks it's just a matter of if you're looking for him or not and i just so i was blessed i already had a good sermon preached to me by the trees outside today and i i just enjoyed that that's my sermon i'm not going to say let's stand and close in prayer but that's my little sermonette that i wanted to share with you i was encouraged by it okay brother franco if it's okay i wanted to uh share we haven't had really a missions update for quite a while mainly because nobody could do anything because of the covet and everything else like that most countries are completely shut down and couldn't gather but i had just received some pictures from our brother alfred fury in malawi and a real precious brother real saint of god and i just felt to share him with you here and i hope that's okay you know mainly because you can be in prayer for him and also i thought there was a good little lesson here that kind of fit right in with my thought tonight obviously brother alfred is here in the the blue and i want to give a background here on some of these pictures this brother i asked brother alfred i said can you explain this brother and he said well this is my father he says um not natural though but i've i've taken him as my father and he's taken me as a son the story here is he is a believer and his wife passed away and his other children passed away and he had one son living and six months ago he moved to live with that son whom brother alfred uh ministers to that group that's there and the son died so the man's completely alone and he has no children he has no wife and he's he's got no money he's got nothing and there was a proposition given to him he asked the wife of his son who died her parents if she he could just sleep or stay in their house until he died that was his only request and they said only if you join the baptist church and he said no way i'll sleep outside is what he said i will not do that he vehemently opposed it and just committed himself to die in the hands of the lord and and this is legitimate of the story and and brother alfred found out about this and he said no no my brother i won't let that happen he says i will be your son you will be my father i will take care of you from this point on and so this man was sleeping on dirt so they've arranged for a young a brother in the assembly there and brother alfred is supporting them and we are supporting them because you know we help with our alfred and he was able to get a little um portion of the brother's house that this brother's going to be staying in and we got him a little mattress or he got him a mattress so that he doesn't have to sleep on the ground and a blanket and brother alfred's going to continue care for him and uh i thought that's that's what a good shepherd does he cares for his sheep right next one brother if you can go down um here's the assembly and the uh the church um this one church whether alfred travels like a circuit rider almost you know and travel is throughout those areas lots and lots of small groups there and but here's their assembly and um it's nice huh don't ever take for granted the nice pews don't ever take for granted the nice church that we all we have we have a very nice church i don't think we've ever complained i'm not going to say about being cold or hot because someone's always cold and hot but not too cold or too hot we're not exposed to the elements i don't think we've ever had to move our seats to get out of the rain i don't think we've ever had to do those things so we have a lot to be thankful for don't we um and you know brother alfred i've never heard him preach i don't think any of you have ever heard him preach and you'll probably never be heard preaching but he's faithful to those sheep he's taking care of those sheep next one brother franco um this is the motorcycle we purchased for him quite some time ago and he said it's still still running got a couple issues we're gonna help him get him fixed but he's just wanted to say thank you it's it's this is his workhorse it's still still running next one brother it's another little assembly that brother alfred takes care of and sent a picture of it next one brother and this is um i can't say her name sister charwa or something like that and he sent this picture and he said uh the sister's been praying for a blanket for 12 years and god provided and that's all he said in the text i said brother will you please explain this to me he said so the story goes for this sister she is a believer and she moved from i believe tanzania or somewhere like that into malawi with her husband and three children and after a couple years her husband abandoned her and she had to move in with her very elderly father and she has been there the whole time doing what she can to provide for her three children and also care for her elderly father and there was never any funds to buy a decent blanket she she had a um a cloth i guess you call like a sheet and uh and it came up in conversation that sister has been believing for a blanket and brother i offered her about it he said well let's let's get that for this sister so she she got the blanket this last week and she was overwhelmed with joy she said it's been 12 years that she's been believing god for a blanket and she said god provided and brother alfred had made the comment he said the shepherd takes care of his sheep amen and so that's heavy i'm just going to be honest with you as a human being living in america these things are heavy for me um but i i i so appreciate it's it's it's god mindful of his sheep he this sister didn't need a hundred thousand dollar house and a new car and all these things she just wanted a blanket and god provided and she was thankful and i don't i want to be thankful for what god's provided i i told brother chaplin i may just go out and just tell people how thankful i am to be a christian might take an hour and just express to you some way somehow we're a thankful people we have nothing to complain about nothing to criticize why our father knows what we have need of i'm a sheep and his pastor he called me he sent his angel to me and said behold their lamb has come why don't you go there and he came to the right people he came to shepherds right he went to shepherds that knew that how to care for the lamb they knew he knew that this land these shepherds would care for the lamb in the right way and i believe with all my heart he came to people like us simple uneducated nobodies but we we we view the lamb as precious in our sight he's the most precious thing this message this word this living reality to us is the most precious thing we could have ever came in contact with and i don't think we should ever take it lightly i don't think we should ever not cherish it it with everything we got in us it's not a common thing this is not something that everybody will enjoy this is only for the sheep of his pasture only for those sheep so pray for the sister yes if you don't mind pray for brother alfred he asked for prayers from the assembly and he also wanted me to pass on tremendous thanksgiving from his heart that we've been able to support him many years now and he said so many of these needs could never have been met if if we wouldn't have had a burden to help in the ministry so okay if you'll stand for the reading of the word um psalms 23 1 my opening scripture psalms 23 1 the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness i like this for his name's sake not mine it's his reputation on the line not mine yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i'll fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod thy staff they comfort me thou preparest to table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runeth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever may god add tremendous blessings to his word you may be seated so you can see why i am encouraged you know it's like anything though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil the only reason you can fear no evil is because thou art with me the only way that i can come out here at this point without fear is because i know he's with me and i think you know he's in our presence and as long as we know he's in our presence what do we have to fear what's going to come upon us that could cause us to fret and be upset if i know he's with me we can go through anything it really doesn't matter it's just the way it goes and and i wanted to look at some of these things and we're just going to take some time and i just honestly want to take some time to psalms 23 and i know this isn't deep but i told you i may come out for an hour and just tell you how thankful i am to be a christian i may say that a few hundred times tonight i don't know but i just want to take some time and look at this he says the lord is my shepherd and i got the thing and i says now ain't it good thing that he didn't just say the lord is a is a shepherd he's not just a shepherd you know he's my shepherd like i'm happy for you that he's your shepherd that's a wonderful thing but it's a whole new joy when i know that he's my shepherd and my shepherd promised he'd never leave me nor forsake me i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world i don't care what trial what situation and what you go through you see i'm with you i'm your shepherd i'm the one that's caring for you and it's my reputation on the line if something happens to you that just changes i mean that just so uplifts me what what do we have to be afraid of it's shalom it's good morning do you know who you are you're the beloved you're his beloved you're the sheep of his pasture you're the one that he's going to fulfill this great purpose and plan in that he per he per he purposed in himself to do from before the foundation of the world and you find to be the man and the woman that he's going to do it oh it's just for me i says he's my shepherd yeah that's mine i'm taking ownership of that you know that's me that's that's my shepherd he may be your king but he's not just your king he's my king and the king of kings and lord of lords is watching over me devil do what you want say what you want whisper whatever you want that word says he's mine shepherd oh i like that so i shall not want what do i have want for his reputation's on the line what's going to go wrong that he don't know about nothing he's my shepherd he maketh me to lie down in green pastures and he leadeth me beside still waters he knows what i have need of he knows how to feed me right he knows just the right food at just the right time to give in just the right way and i thought about this today i got to think and i says you know i'm watching my my little girls they're growing so fast and if you've ever known you have girls boys too they grow in spurts they don't grow all at once cali grew i think five inches in the last year right and they start eating everything in sight right well you know growth is coming because there's a lot of appetite and with this desire for a lot of appetite takes a lot of food because we got some growth to go into but you know what's so interesting after the growth stops just stops you know what it is it's acclimating the body is acclimating to the growth and you know that's true and i got to think about this let's just go with me a little journey let's say we're climbing mount everest if anybody know climbing there's some certain things about climate look this up when you're climbing mount everest you don't go from the bottom to the top without stopping you don't you can't you can only i think steve my father-in-law would know but i think it's for every hour climbed it'll between on the body and the shape of the person it'll take one to three hours for every hour climbed that you have to stop so that your body can acclimate to the new altitude otherwise altitude sickness can set in and you you can get really really sick get messed up so with every step higher you have a pause you don't go all the way up in one swoop right and then every time you climb you gotta do i think it's the same way when you scuba dive up right brother rich i don't never done it but from what i remember you saying that one time you can only go down so fast when you're going deep into things you can only you can go down so much and you got to stop and i think your body's got to regulate to the pressures or something like that things got to happen you don't go all the way down to the bottom you go incrementally and when i'm teaching lesson i i teach some math sometimes my daughters i notice you know i i'll teach them a lesson you know and and no school or no teacher would just pour them on okay we're going to do uh add addition today subtraction we're doing multiplication on the third day we're going to calculus on the fourth we're going to geometry on the fifth we're going to this on that and we're going to no good teacher does that nobody does you know what you do you say this is how you add and this is how you subtract now we're going to spend the next week adding and subtracting and then after that we're going to we're going to go into multiplication now it may take us two weeks for you to really grasp how to use multiplication correctly right so that's it's natural those things are natural you think it's any different in the spiritual realm no you ever notice that you notice it as a body it's like boy we just hit the gas and then level off for a moment it's natural it's called body acclimating it means the body has to acclimate to the new spiritual reality that she is now living in right it don't just happen all at once you don't have a baby tomorrow and she gets married on the next day it just don't happen you acclimate you grow in those things god gives you a truth and reveals a portion of himself to you you find yourself in the portion of the revelation and then you walk in it for a while you gotta learn to walk in that new reality for you you gotta learn to walk in it because what is this it's god's great mystery hidden in you hidden in me god unveiling this attribute and this great desire that he had one day at a time one step at a time little at a time now i know sometimes i want to go i want to get the point i want the rapture to mar i want the body change i'm in the process of the rapture but you know what i know sometimes we want the body change tomorrow but i'm going in the rapture word by word brother branham said step by step you ever climb a ladder you take one step and you know what you can't take another step with that same foot you got to bring the rest of the body up to the next level that you just took a step to it's the body acclimating to these new realities all the time right and i i got to thinking about that you know that's how god deals with us that's how god deals with his sheep because you find in here he's dealing with these sheep he's he he had him by these green pastures and if i was a sheep i'd never want to leave a green pasture i'd never why would lord why are we leaving the pasture why are we leaving the still waters because i read in the next line lord you're taking me into the valley of the shadow of death why would you do that you know i don't like shadowy places you imagine a sheep walking through this place he can't identify what's a rock and what's a wolf you know what he has to do keep his eye on the shepherd just keep my eye on that shepherd because i'm afraid to look anywhere else we've all been there you let shadowy valleys come our way and you think now lord what is going on you were here you were moving the mighty way i was beside these green pastures and these still waters and you were just feeding me and i was getting fat and sassy you're just really feeding on the word of god and now he's like yeah now we gotta go walk a little bit we gotta go so we got you know what i got to get you on the other side of this mountain we need some new vitamins over here but you know what before we get there i got to take you through this valley i got to take you through this valley first yeah because i don't know why a shepherd would ever want to leave or bring his sheep away from a green pasture unless he's taken them to another green pasture but he just has to go through a valley sometimes to get there right we all go through those that's just typical that's normal christian life mountaintops and valleys so hey when you know those things you're not surprised because he said i'm with you right there and if you're walking through that valley of the shadow of death and things are looking rough and you get scared and you start to run off the side don't worry the shepherd's rod is going to hit you really good on the side and get you back in line it's going to get you back remember it's his reputation on the line not mine i like that thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil and my cup runneth over in this day and age where my we're to have some enemies and we got some now what they call heresy is the way i'm serving the god of my fathers but i've got a seven course meal that's feeding me daily he's never let me he's never left me go hungry i've got word upon word a meal after meal after meal he take he prepares it all for me i've got nothing to be afraid of my father my shepherd king took care of a sheep me now i also want to look at samuel if it's okay first samuel 17 34. first samuel 17 34 and david said unto saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and i went out after him and i smote him and i delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by the beard and i smote him and i slew him thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seen he hath defiled the armies of the living god you know i like this so much david's just a shepherd david's just about his father's business he's just faithfully doing what he was called to do and then god creates the circumstances to display the mighty power of god through such a simple vessel that it took everybody's breath away he took down goliath in just a man keeping his father's sheep just a little boy just a young fellow brother bannon said he was just a little ruddy fella but he was faithful and he had he was in the line of duty he had a responsibility to take care of them sheep just take care of them sheep so nothing could stop him in his line of duty god was going to see to it that he would help him to overcome whatever obstacle comes in the way and i like that so much because i can identify with david so much because i know i'm ready i know i ain't got nothing i'm not a skilled warrior i'm not a high trained theologian of any sort or shape but i believe god i i've been with him i've been alone with him i've sat beside those green pastures david talked about i've sat quietly with him and i know he's with me and so if he's with me bring it on what does it matter anymore he promised he'd be with me and i loved so much that he was just faithfully keeping his father's sheep god displayed such strength in just keeping his father's sheep and i know we're not all ministers and this isn't just for brother chad or any minister it's for you mommy it's for you daddy you've got some little sheep little lambs you're responsible too you let the devil come in buddy remember you're keeping the father sheep sickness come you're keeping the father sheep just strike that thing down by faith take god at his word he'll guide the stone you'll hit that goliath he'll knock out whatever that is in the way unbelieving children take care of the sheep feed the sheep feed on the word so that your life can speak louder than the words that you're speaking that can feed off the life that you're living so much so that you keep feeding and you're not speaking to them anymore but you're speaking the message is going forth in silence remember god does great big things in silence the voice of a thousand lived lives for christ so keep feeding the sheep god's gonna do great things in that and brother bannon says this in a god called man david was a hunter and a shepherd in the psalms he wrote of green pastures and still waters because there he was alone by himself he wasn't contaminated with the things of the world god has to get a man away from the things of the world so in getting quiet so he can just listen that still small voice then once in contact with god he becomes fearless notice that he don't care what anyone says because he's been in the presence of god he knows god in the power of his resurrection and then david we see him one day god permitted a bear to come in remember god permitted the bear to come in and get to get one of them his sheep david just took after the bear no doubt but what he prayed because a little letter later on he confessed to that that he prayed and he asked god he was the caretaker of that sheep he could not lose that sheep he must save the sheep at all price so he grabbed the little slingshot and took out after the bear and he killed it he must save that sheep see what god had been training him for god wants his shepherds to save the sheep regardless of what they have to be called or what they have to go through you save them sheep i like that you're not living for yourself anymore david wasn't concerned about getting hurt or even killed his responsibility his duty get that sheep out of that bear's mouth if i gotta take some hits for it that's okay i'm living for the sheep okay i hope it's okay right just i'm just pouring out right so shepherd of the sheepful but when a sheep's lost you see he's absolutely helpless i picked up i picked up a sheet uh not standing 300 yards from from the sheepfold there he was and that sheep was absolutely lost he just stands there and bleats until a wolf would get him because he cannot find his way back he's totally and helpless he's totally helpless without a shepherd a sheep can't do a thing that's us don't you ever think you're anything more than a sheep but we're the sheep of the right pasture you ain't ever going to get to the point you don't need the shepherd every day of your life i'm convinced of that more and more every day i have to live with this animal right so i don't trust this thing this flesh here at all and i need him every day to help me overcome every single day we don't ever want to get arrogant we don't ever want to get prideful no we're still sheep i love to had brother tommy i don't see brother tommy i had brother tommy come and talk to the youth the other oh there he is brother tom hope it's okay brother i'm going to use you but brother tommy's a pillar for me and i had him come to talk to the youth last week and it had i had it on my heart to do it because i said now here's a man 82 years old right there's some wisdom there and i want him to talk to the kids and as he talked to the kids you know brother tommy admitted he didn't have an education and for him that was a little bit of a complex a little bit of a weakness and it caused him a lot of headaches and some heartaches but i said brother tommy your weakness was your greatest strength you know why you had to have god do everything for you and he did brother tommy did he has he ever failed you 82 years faithful the shepherd takes care of his sheep don't he yeah i just want to stay a sheep i just want to stay simple i just want to stay a sheep in his pasture he'll take care of me let me go to this john 10 11. you know this scripture very well i am the good shepherd well let's see the characteristics of the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep wow that's a good shepherd the good shepherd you know like even the ministry the ministry there is to serve the people the people don't have to serve the ministry regardless the ministry is there to serve every gift in the body is there to be a help to you every gift that's in the body right and it it's it's there to be a blessing always and it's not looking for any type of accolades or respects or extra respects none whatsoever i don't need any don't want any and i don't believe anybody with a real gift knowing that it came from god would ever have such an arrogancy to think that they need to be served in certain way or bowed in a certain way or you know respected a certain no we're here to serve the people here to serve the bride right that's our goal that's that's what a good shepherd does he serves he helps and he lays himself down on the sheep's behalf he'll take the ridicule he'll take the blame just don't hurt the sheep don't hurt them sheep amen but he that is in hireling and not a shepherd whose own the sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep he fleeth and the wolf catcheth him and scattereth the sheep that's a good way of identifying a hireling may have a gift but he's a hireling he's not a true shepherd difficulty comes and the man takes off this is not you you think of uh balaam man he was willing to sacrifice the people for a little bit more prestige and a little bit more money and let the sheep die he's a false prophet you know what i'm saying but look he didn't care about them people no but when the same thing comes to moses moses says blot my name out lord i threw myself in the bleach you take me out but lord protect your people lord don't forsake your people you see the good shepherd in action he's always willing to lay himself down for the sheep that's okay that's okay as long as the sheep are okay i'll take that punch yeah kick me yeah say that about me that's okay are the sheep okay good hit me again right you do the same for your children right you protect your children we should be like that one to the other right we should care for one another so much so that one person would come in and say did you hear about so and so and such is it brother sister you keep that to yourself i'm gonna hear none of that nonsense that's my brother that's my sister you know what let's pray for him don't don't don't do that to one another remember we're sheep and we're shepherds we're watching over each other you know maybe they're in a down time they probably wounded why don't you be a shepherd like that shepherd planes in the air force and you help them get back to the place where god can restore that man restore that woman right that's what shepherds do a hireling fleeth because he is in hireling and careth not for the sheep i am a good shepherd and i know my sheep and i am known of mine as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay my my life down for the sheep john 12 24 says verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abide alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life will lose it he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there also my servants be if any man serve me him will my father honor and as i'm reading that that picture of that woman in that blanket just popped in my mind you know she's a young woman right she had three children her husband abandons her but she's a believer what does she do she lives alone does the best she can knows that her family is in destitute but that's okay she's a believer she knew the shepherd would take care of her and he did and she her children are raised now and he took care of her you see but she hated she had to hate this natural life if she was looking to appease this natural life she would have found a new husband take care of her do things like that but she would have had to forsake eternal life she had this he's a person she had to forsake the word to do such she would not do that she would suffer more on this earth suffer for a shorter period of time because this is a very sure this is a vapor of a time compared to that time and suffer the reproach for a short period of time to stay true to him the one she really loved so we do these things this is our calling this is what sheep do another thing here i always like this one the great servant moses he got attention of jarius one day little jarius when he wouldn't believe in divine healing he just wouldn't believe it he wanted jarius's heart so what'd he do only thing he could do he struck his daughter and let her die so that jesus could come over and raise her back up again just really get his attention you see god does that sometimes he'll throw you right on your back sometimes make you sick so that you can so that he can make you look up that you will realize like the old shepherd stories had a sheep had to break its leg he said how did the sheep break its leg he said oh i broke it he said now why would a cruel shepherd like you break that sheep's leg he said no said she wouldn't mind me said so i had to go and break her leg in order that i could pack her around a little bit baby her a little bit give her some special food that she would love me and follow me that's the way god has to do sometimes he's got to break us down once in a while just so that he can give us give you some little extra food you know to kind of love on us a little bit do you know that's exactly why i am a gospel preacher tonight it's because i had a spell of sickness and the doctor said that i wouldn't live that's exactly right it changed me you see it shook me that's brother brandon i'm thankful for some broken legs sometimes i had a few i'm sure i got some more coming sometimes but i like that little special fruit and attention i get when he when he picks me up into his arms brother bam also says here in the third exit he said oh the hand of god how sometimes it sure looks cruel the way that people have to suffer it does but see it's the tender hand of jehovah he's leading his little children we thank you for that lord now i pray god as i see the day when the denominations are pressing the believers and excommunicating them saying that if their name is not upon their book they're lost or have nothing to do with the other group you see it's only the tender hand of jehovah just leading them to the tree of life i pray god that each one i know they will because it's your word that it can't fail that they may be led to that tree of life that we might be a possessor of that eternal life see the hand of god in the eyes of faith look beyond those shadows that we're walking in today and see the promised land laying just ahead i've never seen it fail let pressure come let difficulty come let uh whatever come god just uses it to bring him right us closer into his presence i've never seen it fail but bob you ever seen fail no he didn't hear me that's okay sister sam will tell you later we love you brother bob but it's the truth it's true right never seen it fail god's word will never fail i'm sorry we're just home folk tonight it's just going to be real homey right yeah i've never seen it fail always it looks bad it looks real bad i mean bad bad how could it get any bad i'm walking through this valley of shallow depth oh no he's just leading you to new pasture yeah just leading us to some new vitamins so walking into this stepping into psalms 23 though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i fear no evil brother bam says in this day the scriptures fulfill i might could stop here if i had some time and just give you a little tip sometimes you might be sitting out there with cancer you might be setting with the disease you think now why i being a christian would i be in this way why am i sitting like this if i'm a christian sometimes god lets things get so dark till you can't see up around or anywhere else and then he comes and makes a way for you right through it that you may say this day this scripture is fulfilled that he promised to do it man i want to be the fulfillment of his word in no in whatever form it comes i want to be able to say god confirmed his word he did it in me so i want to look at john the baptist for a little bit i just got a couple examples it's wednesday night it'll be short you know yeah the kids got school but brother branham says in the forgotten beatitude see when trouble sets in jesus come and he showed the messiah that he was the messiah but then something went wrong john had introduced the messiah with a fan in his hand and he was going to burn up the chaff but he found out the works of jesus that he was meek and lowly so it worried him he didn't know he didn't know what to say he thought now there's got to be something wrong here somewhere seemed he had believed the wrong thing it seemed like it wasn't working right and there's many a times that we think that too that it isn't working right oh but it's working right as long as we know he's here what difference does it make it's working right maybe it ain't working according the way you may think it ought to work but it's working according to the way that god wants it to work amen i can say amen to that many times i'm like something's wrong something that may work all right oh it's working right is he in our presence then everything's working right everything's perfectly on time nothing's out of cater nothing's out of line so and just looking at john here for a little bit i like this now i can really identify with john you say well john thought well i introduced the messiah that he'd have a fan in his hand and he's going to purge the forest he's going to take the weed into the garter and i told them that axe would be laid to the root of the tree he's going to take all the trash he's going to burn it up and here he is instead of a great mighty man like that here he comes meek and lowly something must have went wrong there's no doubt but something's wrong somewhere he became so dismayed like many of us when we see things going on that it isn't what we think is just right we become dismayed don't worry it will be all right see the devil got a hold of him down in there the devil thought now i've got him in jail now i throwed him in jail so i'll just rough him up real good while i got him in here god isn't using him right now you see i've got him in jail so he just pulled the blanket over him i got him all caged up you see i got that cage that eagle all caged up i'll make him wish he never preached the gospel again you know there's some jail sometime for each of us god ordained some of those things john got dismayed because he thought the plan of god something went wrong and i can't do anything about it i'm in jail i can't confirm what's going on oh but if john could have just realized he was fulfilling the word he was absolutely right on time and in the place that god needed him to be because this one must increase therefore this one must decrease right and it's the exact same way in this message and it's the exact same way in our lives the things that we think ought to be believe me they're just right the way they're supposed to be god's got the whole thing running right on tune but you know like with the symphony right you all know symphony and brother branham talks the symphonies sometimes the symphony it's building up building up and then it just drops down the composer just took at a completely different angle right keeps you on your toes you know what i think i think no matter how well that god makes or even the ministry or god makes things plain he's never going to remove the element of faith he's never going to remove the element because this is the victory that overcome with the world even our faith god had to have something in a way of this great overcoming that we all overcome not because everything is plainly made known to us it can't be that way there's got to always be the element of faith in everything in every revelation there's still an element of faith there because the promise is sure to only the seed the seed of faith so i believe with everything in me i thank god for the ministry i thank god as he continually unveils i thank god as he raises me from word by word by word and i also know that that word is raising a faith inside of me to take him for the nether portion of the word and another part in the land and another portion of the land but he's never going to remove the element of faith it's always going to take a twist you did not expect i mean you just did not see that coming you do it in your own life everything's going real good and then boom everything went real bad everything's just right it's just right i want to use another one i identify with peter i'm going fishing how many ever been that point i'm going fishing i i don't understand what's going on things just have taken turn something's wrong somewhere i mean we beheld him there he was the mighty god the conqueror and he just let them beat him spit at him and rip his face and beard out and shame him i i thought he was setting up his kingdom i thought i thought everything i thought the rapture was tomorrow like the messenger came and the word was preached and he's here and why did it take this turn i mean it looked so weak it looked so simple it looked defeated but it wasn't it was the victory what looked like defeat was actually the victory when it looks like it's all washed up don't worry the victory's right there it looked like that to peter peter got discouraged john 23 1. simon peter sayeth unto them i go efficient they say unto him we also go with thee everybody was discouraged they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing brother brahm says and go tell my disciples he said how could they see a man with that much power hang on a cross of calvary with that great mocking and globs of soldiers spit that had made fun of him and dropping off of his beard while they pulled handfuls of beard out of his faith face and hid him upon the head and said prophesy who hit you when they could see those roman nails drove deep into his hands and his feet how could they see a man like that die because god required judgment and got in christ had to take the judgment oh see how they were disappointed they'd went away to their fishing nets again peter said i'm going fishing the disciples said i'm going with you and they did and they were all together tore up and disappointed there they took his body they had wrapped it in linton they had laid it in the grave and they're not a one of us ain't been that point just i'm done i'm going fishing i've been there many a time like i'm just not that i forsake the truth not that i disbelieve it i know it's the truth i just don't know what to do anymore i just i go fishing and i love how the great shepherd came and comforted the sheep you know we know the story but let's read it john 21 jesus cometh taketh bread give it to them the fish likewise this is now the third time that jesus showed himself to the disciples and after that he was risen from the dead so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonas loveth thou me more than these he sayeth unto them yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my lambs he sayeth unto him again the second time simon son of jonas loveth thou me he saith unto him yay lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my sheep he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas loveth thou me peter was grieved because he had asked him the third time loveth thou me he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee jesus saith unto him feed my sheep because no doubt peter was joyed in the presence of the lord while they were sitting there and dining but he also knew that he had denied him three times no doubt he had known when the pressure came on he forsook the lord in his time of need but the good shepherd didn't come down and beat him good shepherd didn't come down and say well you no good nothing didn't i i revealed myself to you i gave you the kingdom a keys to the kingdom like give them back it didn't do any of that didn't change his position didn't change his calling it didn't change anything amen the master the shepherd just came down and just said you love me feed my sheep love me feeding my sheep you want to express the great love just feed my sheep and it restored him remember and he says now just follow me and he says down here verily verily i say unto you when you were young thou gerdest thyself and walkest wither thou wouldest but when thou art old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee wither thou would it snout this spake signifying of the death he should glorify god by what death he should glorify god and that always has struck me what death he should glorify god god was glorified in peter being obedient to death you know we would say well i mean peter maybe you could have went and had another meeting somewhere that would really bring glory to god no just do what god told you to do and if god wants you to die just die it'll glorify god you know it's what's what we think is up is down sometimes right in the kingdom of god i just have a couple more jesus said if you love me feed my sheep and i never did say sheared the sheep he said feed the sheep he never said educate them he said feed them well sheep if correctly fed with sheep food and what is the sheet food the word for man shall not live by wor for man shall not live by word alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god not just one then and now and then but every word line up online here a little and there a little every word of it give them the sheep food the van says you feed my sheep he never said drive them sheep or kick them sheep feed the sheep that's what sheep needs is some sheet food he never kicked peter never kicked him never said you no good nothing you no just fed him reminded him of his calling and you know the best sheep food i know when a a sick is a sick when you have a sick sheep and is to just get them a great big basket full of the bread basket of god that word of god man shall not live by bread alone but every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god when you're down and spiritually sick go turn on a tape go call a brother call a real sense here brother say brother what you reading i've done it many times and like well i'm rough rough times just we were talking about that brother shy right just call a brother what you've been feeding on i want to lick off of you for a little bit because i know there's some vitamins on that rock of revelation you're you've been feeding on and i need to lick it off you because i just ain't got no much strength right now remember brother bam talks about they got real sick sheep there would be a certain rock with the right minerals that that sheep needs to get well there's a certain rock of the revelation of jesus christ that'll bring you out of whatever spiritual amnesia you've got just sometimes got blue honey on it to get them to start licking right so maybe we just get all in the honey honey jar of the word of god and just be ready when we come in contact with the sick sheep don't have to kick them don't have to criticize them don't have to say hey why don't you get out of that why don't you stop for no i bet you i know the way to get them out of that you just share the revelation you've been feeding off of and i guarantee it has an effect has an effect now brother branham says now if you're a preacher you get a pulpit if you're not live your sermon see that's the best way that you can do it you live your sermon if you're a preacher get a pulpit and go preaching if you're not just live your sermon let your life be your pulpit so you got the opportunity to keep feeding the sheep you just live that word now has a couple little portions here for us as sheep as this pastor sheep are real funny little creatures brother bam says here's another thing we might learn from the sheep tonight when the weather is real hot did you ever see what see sheep they will not separate themselves they will not separate themselves and one go to one place and another one go to another place but right there in the heat of the day the sheep will all stand together what are they doing they're making shade one for the other see they're having fellowship and wouldn't it be good if all of god's sheep when the real heat is on would just stand together when the trials are real hard and the heat is on everything going on everywhere if all of god's little sheep would just stand together we'd have a coolness of the shade of one another a real comfort and ability to lean on one another now someone said is that necessary brother brown it certainly is there is nothing like having a real good dependable friend that when the troubles are blazing and the heat is on you can go to that friend and sit down and explain it to them and talk it over in personal confidence then kneel down and pray together and know that person is a real good god saved man and woman that you can put confidence in oh it's good let us come together the bible says let us stand together i like that yeah i'm not going to criticize if someone walks away her hat feels to separate i'm just going to stand by him i'll just go cast some shade on him maybe the heat of the trial is getting a little hot i'll just go maybe give him a little shade you gotta say nothing sometimes brother bam says here in the orients i've seen the shepherd brings them in by night and he counts them every one that goes in if there's one missing he will not lay down until he goes out into the deserts or wherever those herded lands are and he'll find that sheep and he'll lay it over his shoulders and he'll bring it on into the fold then the shepherd lays himself down at the gap he is the door to the sheepfold there's no other no no other it's a corral to go over it and nothing can come to those sheep until it crosses over that shepherd what a relief that is what a loving thing to know that when we are tucked into his blessed keeping he becomes the door and there's nothing that can happen to you no matter what it is it'll all have to come by that shepherd if it's sickness it might be for your correction it might be for a testimony against the enemy it might be for an exaltation of christ's name but nothing can come to you except he permitted it to come because he is the door to the sheepful i told you i might just tell you i'm just happy to be a christian i'm just happy to be a sheep of his pasture i know who's watching the door musicians will you come i brother brown tells this story i think a few of you know it he said i was driving further and i saw some shepherds coming down the street and there they put their vegetables and so forth right on the street and all their goodies and here come right down the middle of the street a shepherd walking through all these places leading his sheep not by a rope they were just following him by sight well i like that that's interesting didn't have to put a rope around me to bring me to church and put a rope around me to read the message didn't have to put a rope around me to listen to a tape didn't have to put a rope around me to encourage your brother no i just followed the shepherd i was watching what he did and i just did what he did oh i see i like that i don't have to force you to do nothing just something behind me pushing me and they were just following him by sight and i stopped and i was amazed as that shepherd walk he could step a few steps out to one side and then back to the other side and the steep and the sheep next to him would step out and then they would come right back and the sheep behind him would follow and they followed that shepherd the sheep know my voice and i was amazed and i said to the good man with me i said why do they not turn aside and eat some of those pears they look so beautiful and the things that would would entice a sheep he said they would in no wise touch anything until that shepherd first bid them to do so oh my there you are if god sheep would just be so careful about things you know that applies to every aspect of your and my life i'm learning that myself i'm preaching to myself right now too many things we do is not his will and it's not good for us and it looks good but if my shepherd if the sheep if the if the shepherd of this sheep right here says don't touch that i've got to be willing to say don't touch that i got to leave it alone and just follow in his footsteps he knows what's good for me he knows what's good for the sheep he knows exactly what i have need of and when i have need of it so i think we should consult the lord about many more things and maybe sometimes you know my wife never just told my says i think we've left him out of a lot of decisions i think we need to include him in a lot more of the decisions that we were once just making by our human intellect i think he wants all of me amen not just portions i think he wants all of the home all of the family every aspect of our lives and then we need to consult him because he'll many times just say no i am convinced of that and humanly speaking it makes perfect sense sometimes and god will say don't do it just don't do it i think sometimes you're just checking your obedience i really do just obedience obedience is better than sacrifice one more oh where is it yeah okay why it had to be shepherds they found when they found that baby what a joy it must have been to them because the angel had given them a message and they found that it was exactly where the angel said it would be it was just in the place where the angels said it would be what a thing that must have been to them it was in a manger why see how at ease the herdsmen were in the stable what do you think a theologian would have been in there he'd had to put a pen over his nose and say get me out of this place he would have had been he would have wanted to get out of this place he'd been in misery but you see it was just at home for the shepherds god knows where to send his message see just exactly right in this state of shepherds was in was in it was in a stable with their lamb a vindicated message that they had heard how beautiful in the presence of the messiah the vindicated word of their message then the shepherds heard that the messiah was on earth and they came into his presence and they were right in their own environment and they found the message to be true it was vindicated there how that must have made them men feel to god to find that god had done this great thing for them why scholars would have been so out of their place under such circumstances they'd a left right quick i find this message is not so appealing to a lot of people you find that really it's not real appealing it's a pretty rough way it stinks in many people's nostrils it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't do for them what they want god to do for them now they just can't stand the thought of being disrespected or despised or ridiculed and spit upon i just can't stand the thought of we're just too good for that but the king of kings and the lord of lords took it i just can't take that kind of a message am i be despised be rejected the message coming to common herdsmen maybe they could have um not even some of these herdsmen might not have been able to sign their own name very doubtful you know these herdmen that jesus chose when he was here on earth to herd his sheep he says love is thou me peter more than these ye lord thou knowest feed my sheep the bible said that peter was an ignorant and unlearned man he was still choosing shepherds amen i'm really happy to be one of them i'm really really happy to be one that a a lamb is precious in the sight of a shepherd i'm really happy that this message to me is precious in my sight it's so precious i want to care for it i want to do everything i can for it and i want to do everything i can for everybody else around me that also loves this precious lamb that we're feeding on will you stand it's blooding bleeding word it came to the right people at the right time the right people in the right time he knew where to send his word where to send his vindicated message let's just bow our heads and pray heavenly father lord we come before you i'm just so thankful i've said it i'll say it again thank you lord thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy thank you lord that you called us to be your sheep in this great hour father may we never forget how privileged we are and lord may we never forget the responsibility and the opportunity we have to this world and to one another i pray lord god that you would help us lord forgive us for when we've made these mistakes forgive forgive me lord when i've gotten down like peter i want to go fishing or i've gotten down like john the thing isn't going the way i think it ought to go i don't know what to do no nothing's wrong nothing's out of cater everything's right on time father i want to thank you for that i want to thank you lord for your presence in our midst i want to thank you lord for confirming that lord through our pastor even before the service and lord through your word and the preaching father uh it encouraged me as a sheep just to know you're in my presence i can't think of anything more in my life i would rather have than to just know i'm in your presence and i just pray lord that you would lead the sheep lord may you help us each and every one to just feed one another where we can stay in that word stay feeding on that rock so someone else can maybe lick off that revelation and get the spiritual vitamins they have need of lord to continue growing i want to thank you for our pastor i thank you lord for the deacons i thank you for the trustees i'm thankful for so many faces flashing before my eye right now i'm thankful for the body of christ and this local flock that i am walking with and a shepherd that's watching over us i'm just so thankful lord we appreciate you more than words can actually put together for you but lord you know our hearts you know how much we love you lord may we express that love by doing what you've called us to do father i just commit ourselves to you tonight keep watch over us lord as we all travel home i pray be with us tomorrow lord may the word that we fed on today go into action tomorrow so that others lord can see that you're alive and well and in the presence the king is in our midst lord we love you commit ourselves to you in jesus name amen oh think about his love think about his good day think about his grace [Music] foreign [Music] more is oh think about his love [Music] speak about his goodness think about his grace [Music] [Music] is even when i [Music] stray [Applause] is [Applause] his goodness think about his grace foreign [Music] is amen praise god aren't you glad you're a sheep and you have a father that watches over you a good shepherd i love what god was saying there at the end how god brought the message to shepherds because shepherds would value the birth of a sheep and shepherds wouldn't be offended in the way the lord came [Music] you know and in this day we may not have known we were shepherds we might have known we were sheep we didn't know you know maybe we may have been acting like goats or chickens in a chicken yard or you know all the stories that brother banhams tells but he came in such a way that was offensive to denominations it was offensive to the intellectual it was offensive to so many but somehow for us it wasn't offensive it just seemed to fit amen when he says don't go to jerusalem but go to bethlehem and don't go to the synagogue but go to a stable leave you know leave all the systems leave everything leave the wisdom leave the learn and go into the simplicity and find him we said amen i can do that the shepherd when they went they didn't notice the stench they didn't notice the humility it was a homey feeling to them and when we left there all for sake oh amen we didn't go to destitution we didn't go it may have been humble in the world's eyes it may have been humility it may have been what they would deem a maneuver power and a stable but but for us it had a homey feeling amen because two natures were coming together he was bringing us back into identification by this simple humble lamb bringing us back into a true identity of who we are [Music] amen i'm just so thankful for what he's done for me i'm so thankful he put something in me before the foundation of the world there was only one way to call it and if there's only one way to call it in this age he sent the way amen so these two these two parts would come together and there would be an awakening in me and i would know i have a heavenly father and i know i have a good shepherd and i would know though through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me i like what the cows said to the movement through the valley of the shadow of death is only a transition from one good place to another the shepherd is not leading the destruction the shepherd is not leading to starvation the shepherd's just leading from one good pastor to another and many times we go through dark places in our lives and troubles and in transition times that are confusing or frightening amen but all he's doing is moving us through this because he's got something else in his foreknowledge he's trying to bring us to if we could just trust him in those times i mean some of you have served the lord for decades you realize you can look back on your life and there was many transition times
