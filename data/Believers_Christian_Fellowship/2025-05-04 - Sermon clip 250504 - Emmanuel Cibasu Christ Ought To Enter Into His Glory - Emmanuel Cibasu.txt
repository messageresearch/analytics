TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Back in the days of old testament, the prophet of God says we find that after he appeared to his people in different forms, he veiled himself behind all the badger skins. That's right. God hide hiding behind badger skins at his mercy seat. And the prophet of God says that what he was hiding be hiding behind the badger skins was his glory. Amen. Amen. That nobody could approach. Yeah. Right. We find that house that Solomon Solomon when he dedicated the temple of the Lord and the badger skins were hanging there the veil. How that he came in as a pillar of fire, God, as a cloud and went down behind there, behind the badger skins and veiled himself to the outside world. But by faith, not the reality, but by faith, Israel knew that he was back there, though they never seen him, right? They only had one candidate that would go there once a year. Amen. That's Aaron the high priest. So once a year with all the preparation that was made for that day and they had to make sure that he had a string on his leg that he if he forced death there nobody could enter in because going in was death. Yeah. Aaron was allowed once a year in this after dedicated his entire body. He was going through a lot of processes through the year to be able to meet the requirement requirements of what that day. Yeah. I'm going to tell you Aaron was going through a lot. Just to be able to experience one day of the life of a son of God. Yeah. Right. Amen. Of your life. Yeah. Today. If you have the Holy Spirit, you have that every single minute second. You are behind the veil.
