[6:56] like to make an announcement we have
[6:59] another little baby that was born by the
[7:01] grace of god into the assembly amen

[7:29] so it worked out good amen also want to
[7:31] remind you of the meetings up at brother
[7:33] dan ratliffs and near ann arbor michigan
[7:35] this weekend brother ben will be
[7:36] preaching up there saturday and sunday
[7:40] amen let's take a look at colossians
[7:42] chapter 1 verse 25
[7:52] says
[7:53] whereof i am made a minister according
[7:55] to the dispensation of god which is
[7:58] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[8:00] of god
[8:01] even the mystery which has been hid from
[8:03] ages and from generations but now is
[8:06] made manifest to his saints to whom god
[8:08] would make known what is the riches of
[8:10] the glory of this mystery among the
[8:12] gentiles which is christ in you the hope
[8:16] of glory
[8:17] may god bless you as you're seated
[8:19] amen i don't know how many times we've
[8:21] read that scripture i don't i couldn't
[8:23] imagine maybe hundreds of times but it
[8:26] always brings me joy to read that
[8:28] scripture amen that is a passage of
[8:30] scripture brother benham opens with when
[8:31] he preaches christ is the mystery of god
[8:33] revealed and we know that there's been a
[8:35] mystery hid from the foundation of the
[8:37] world the mystery would have been hid
[8:39] from ages and from generations but now
[8:42] is made manifest to his saints to whom
[8:44] god would make known what is the riches
[8:46] of the glory of this mystery among the
[8:48] gentiles which is christ in you the hope
[8:51] of glory
[8:52] i pray that god will help us to
[8:54] understand that that scripture become
[8:56] more of a reality day by day amen and
[8:59] hour by hour in our lives i'd like to
[9:01] read
[9:02] just a little bit out of christ as the
[9:03] mystery of god revealed
[9:06] amen
[9:08] right after brother branham reads that
[9:10] portion of scripture
[9:12] he says now for a text i want to take
[9:14] out of there this for a text basing it
[9:17] upon the entire bible
[9:19] but i want us
[9:20] i want us to title this christ is the
[9:22] mystery of god revealed christ being the
[9:25] mystery of god
[9:26] revealed
[9:28] amen we've talked many many times and
[9:30] talked about this that if we we hear
[9:33] what brother branham's wanting to say
[9:34] but we get the wrong mental picture from
[9:37] the beginning then we're going to miss
[9:38] the rest of what he's bringing us in
[9:40] this message where he's telling us he
[9:42] wants to base he's reads that for a text
[9:45] but he wants to base this sermon upon
[9:47] the entire bible
[9:49] so he's going to be preaching the entire
[9:51] bible and he wants to title it christ is
[9:53] the mystery of god revealed christ being
[9:56] the mystery of god revealed
[9:58] now if we if in our minds
[10:01] as soon as he says that we picture amen
[10:04] the vessel of jesus christ the body that
[10:06] god
[10:07] expressed himself in and we limit
[10:09] everything he's going to say to that one
[10:11] manifestation amen then we're going to
[10:13] miss the rest of the message
[10:15] but we have to understand what he's
[10:17] talking about he's preaching the entire
[10:19] bible and in the entire bible christ is
[10:22] the mystery of god revealed and it's
[10:24] christ amen the anointed word for each
[10:26] age revealing god through the entire
[10:29] bible
[10:30] so
[10:31] it was all of that was wrapped up in
[10:33] jesus christ he was the fullness of the
[10:35] godhead bodily he was the full
[10:37] expression and one vessel of all of that
[10:40] truth was expressed there but it wasn't
[10:42] the only place it was expressed it was
[10:44] also expressed down through the bible
[10:47] amen and it was it's continually being
[10:49] expressed that christ is the mystery of
[10:51] god revealed even being expressed in our
[10:53] day
[10:54] so we can't start amen this
[10:57] understanding
[10:58] this message with the wrong mental
[11:00] picture amen we have to have the right
[11:02] mental picture then we're going to
[11:03] understand what brother banh is telling
[11:05] us amen
[11:06] so christ is the mystery of god revealed
[11:08] amen and it's based on the entire bible
[11:12] he said now i took in an order sunday
[11:14] school lessons so we could all read
[11:15] together and have this fellowship
[11:17] together now god's secret mystery he had
[11:20] before the world began now back in the
[11:22] back part of god's mind there was
[11:24] something there was something that he
[11:26] was trying and was going to achieve and
[11:29] he had a motive in doing it in order to
[11:31] let himself be expressed
[11:33] so
[11:34] so
[11:35] it's self-explanatory but god has had a
[11:38] plan nothing in the bible and nothing
[11:41] through time is happening haphazardly
[11:44] there's so many things that look like
[11:46] they're they're they're in chaos and
[11:48] they're just happening and and things
[11:49] are happening and then there's reactions
[11:51] to actions and and all of it in our
[11:53] perspective from an earthly perspective
[11:55] it looks chaotic amen we can even look
[11:58] at our lives and things that happen to
[11:59] us and it looks chaotic but brother
[12:01] branham said there's nothing out of
[12:03] kilter there's everything's just right
[12:05] on time the clock's ticking right on
[12:07] time with god's plan and nothing happens
[12:10] to a predestinated son or daughter of
[12:12] god without first god giving approval
[12:14] for him because we see that in the book
[12:16] of job when job was going through his
[12:18] crisis and gone giving approval god was
[12:20] in control of job's trial
[12:23] is that right
[12:25] god was in control of job's trial he was
[12:28] putting limits and boundaries and
[12:29] permissions amen to the devil and so god
[12:32] was showing us in job that he is in
[12:35] control amen even when we come into the
[12:37] dark ages and and we see that that that
[12:40] there's a voice that comes from in the
[12:43] in the i think it's the third seal under
[12:45] the black horse rider there there is a
[12:47] voice that comes from the throne amen
[12:49] says that her a penny of wheat for a
[12:52] measure and penny of barley for a
[12:53] measure see thou heard not the oil and
[12:55] wine amen and that voice coming from the
[12:57] midst of the throne amen was the voice
[13:00] of the lamb the lamb was in control even
[13:02] in the dark ages
[13:04] there was persecutions in the church and
[13:07] there was difficulties that they were
[13:08] going through and the true christianity
[13:10] was almost wiped out then but the lamb
[13:13] was still putting boundaries on the
[13:14] trial
[13:16] so it looks like sometimes we look at
[13:20] our lives and it looks like chaos we're
[13:22] standing in situations sometimes we
[13:24] don't know if it's going to go right or
[13:25] if it's going to go left we're standing
[13:27] here and we ourselves have no idea what
[13:29] the next step is going to be and it
[13:30] looks like there's no
[13:32] solution oh i don't know if you've ever
[13:35] lived long enough to get into a position
[13:36] where you could not see a solution
[13:39] if you ever did and you're here now
[13:41] you've been in a good place
[13:43] because you find that god brings a
[13:45] solution where you never expected a
[13:46] solution god knows the next step but he
[13:49] knew the next step before the foundation
[13:51] of the world it's us who didn't
[13:52] understand
[13:54] and so that's been the problem with the
[13:56] bible and bible scholars for all these
[13:58] years is because we had limited
[14:00] perspective trying to understand and
[14:02] make sense out of what we read in the
[14:04] bible and we've looked at it amen it's
[14:07] it's like trying to
[14:09] i i say it this way it's like trying to
[14:11] understand eternity looking through a
[14:14] people
[14:17] you get a little view of this and then
[14:18] maybe you get a little view of that but
[14:20] you can never see the whole picture amen
[14:22] that's why god in the end time came and
[14:24] opened the seals and took the seals off
[14:26] of the bible so we can get more than a
[14:28] people view here in this book and in
[14:30] this book and in this book amen that's
[14:32] what brother branham is doing and christ
[14:34] is the mystery of god revealed he's
[14:35] coming after the seals and he's trying
[14:37] to take the people off of abraham and
[14:40] the people off of noah and the people
[14:43] off of the judges and he's trying to
[14:45] back up and say this is all the same
[14:47] thing
[14:48] this is all expressing the same thing
[14:50] it's expressing what was in the back
[14:52] part of god's mind before the foundation
[14:54] of the world and he's allowed all of
[14:56] this and each one of it has been
[14:58] expressing himself that he's done all of
[15:00] this so that he can express himself
[15:04] so
[15:05] so when we see this picture amen the
[15:08] bible then becomes a new book
[15:11] i'm going to turn over here a couple
[15:13] paragraphs later and continue reading it
[15:15] says now
[15:16] god had a purpose and a hidden mystery
[15:19] and that's what i want to speak on to
[15:21] the church this morning the hidden
[15:23] mystery of god that he had in his mind
[15:25] before the world ever began and how it's
[15:27] unfolded itself right down to this
[15:29] present hour that we're living then you
[15:31] will understand clearly then you'll see
[15:34] on what i believe what is being done
[15:37] so brother branham comes and he tells us
[15:40] uh the the mind that was in god has been
[15:42] unfolding itself right down to this hour
[15:46] so the bible has been the unfolding of
[15:48] god's mind
[15:50] it's been the plan that he had it's been
[15:53] the thought that he wanted to express
[15:55] the thing that he desired to achieve
[15:57] he's been unfolding it down through time
[15:59] amen and bringing it out amen and then
[16:02] in the end time he takes the veil off of
[16:04] it so he can express or he can explain
[16:07] what's been in the back part of his mind
[16:09] so that we can look back and see how
[16:11] perfect everything has been
[16:14] so now nothing's haphazard we understand
[16:17] that
[16:19] he said then
[16:20] it's unfolded itself right down to this
[16:22] present hour that we're living
[16:24] then you will understand clearly then
[16:26] you see on what i believe what is being
[16:29] done
[16:30] so brotherhood is telling us we need
[16:32] this revelation to see what's happened
[16:35] so we can see what's being done
[16:37] so we would understand our day and its
[16:39] message
[16:41] he said god's great mystery of house is
[16:42] secret
[16:44] he kept it a secret nobody knowed
[16:46] nothing about it
[16:47] even the angels didn't understand it see
[16:50] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[16:52] under our seventh mystery when the
[16:54] seventh seal was opened there was
[16:56] silence jesus when he was on earth they
[16:58] wanted to know when he would come he
[17:00] said even the son himself don't know
[17:02] when it's going to happen see god has
[17:04] this all to himself it's a secret and
[17:07] that's the reason there was silence in
[17:09] heaven for a space of half hour and
[17:11] seven thunders uttered their voices and
[17:13] john was even forbidden to write it see
[17:15] the coming of the lord that's one thing
[17:18] he hasn't revealed yet of how he will
[17:19] come and when he will come it's a good
[17:22] thing that he doesn't know
[17:24] he has showed or revealed it in every
[17:26] type that's in the bible
[17:28] now you'll understand why he said i take
[17:30] from my text the entire bible
[17:33] because there's been a great secret in
[17:34] the back part of god's mind and that
[17:36] secret has to do with the coming of
[17:38] christ and and that's been unfolding
[17:40] itself all the way down to this time
[17:43] amen and he hasn't come out plainly and
[17:45] told it no he couldn't do that he must
[17:47] keep it in a mystery form amen but he's
[17:50] showed it in every type that's in the
[17:52] bible so brother branham now is
[17:53] preaching the entire bible
[17:56] but he's preaching this secret
[18:00] so i'd like to title this this morning
[18:01] if i can the mystery in plain sight
[18:06] the mystery in plain sight because it's
[18:09] been unfolding itself in the bible it's
[18:11] been typed in the bible it's been
[18:14] declared in the bible
[18:17] that's why when brother bam comes to the
[18:19] seven seals
[18:20] he's talking before he comes to the
[18:22] preaching of the seven seals and he's
[18:23] talking about the seals inside the book
[18:25] and the seals on the backside of the
[18:27] book and he says you know we can see the
[18:29] seals on the inside and he's talking
[18:31] about you know uh in revelation chapter
[18:34] six when you see the opening of the
[18:35] seals you see a white horse go forth and
[18:37] a red horse hey man he's showing that as
[18:39] the seals on the inside of the book but
[18:41] their seals on the backside are outside
[18:43] the book he said that never written in
[18:45] the bible at all because he's looking at
[18:47] the seven thunders and tying it to
[18:49] revelation chapter eight the seventh
[18:50] seal where there's silence in heaven and
[18:52] john was forbidden to write nothing
[18:54] written nothing spoken and brother
[18:56] bannon said it's not even written in the
[18:58] bible at all
[19:00] that's what he's saying in 1960 and 61
[19:03] amen but by the time that he comes
[19:05] around to preaching the seals they mean
[19:07] he has a greater understanding and he's
[19:09] saying no it can't you can't add to it
[19:11] for this is the complete revelation of
[19:13] jesus christ so the seals have to be in
[19:16] here
[19:18] but god just didn't declare it amen he
[19:20] didn't allow john to write the seven
[19:23] thunders which was the revelation
[19:24] contained in the seven seals but he had
[19:27] him sealed it up but it still has to be
[19:29] in the bible so now brother branham
[19:31] comes to this great mystery of christ
[19:34] amen the seventh seal and he tells you
[19:36] there is silence in heaven nothing's
[19:38] written but it's written in every type
[19:40] that's in the bible
[19:42] so it's a mystery hiding in plain sight
[19:47] amen
[19:48] he goes on and he says
[19:51] he has showed or revealed it in every
[19:54] type that's in the bible therefore the
[19:56] entire bible is the revelation of god's
[19:58] mystery in christ
[20:00] the entire bible is an expression of one
[20:03] goal that god had
[20:05] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[20:07] entire bible and all the acts of the
[20:09] believers in the bible has been in type
[20:11] and expressing what god's great goal is
[20:14] and now in this last day he has revealed
[20:17] it and shows it amen brother didn't say
[20:22] we're hoping he'll reveal it
[20:24] and we're hoping he'll show it
[20:26] but brother branham says here in the
[20:28] last day he has revealed it and shows it
[20:33] so god's great goal is so now
[20:35] i just say it this way basing off this
[20:37] statement brother branham makes in
[20:38] crisis the mystery of god revealed if
[20:40] we're still at the spot where we're
[20:42] wanting god to show us or reveal the
[20:45] seventh seal and show us and reveal the
[20:48] seven thunders he's telling us that he's
[20:50] already revealed it and shows it in the
[20:52] last day so if we're in that place where
[20:55] we're looking for something i would i
[20:57] would i would admonish all of us let's
[21:00] go back to the message amen let's go
[21:01] back to the bible because it's already
[21:03] been revealed it's already been shown
[21:05] it's in the message so let's not stay in
[21:08] the hoping he'll show something he's
[21:09] already revealed and he already shows it
[21:12] so let's go back to that message and say
[21:14] god you have to show me what you showed
[21:17] and you have to reveal to me what you
[21:19] revealed
[21:20] amen because i'm not looking for another
[21:22] messenger i'm not looking for a new
[21:23] message
[21:25] i'm not looking for the hidden message
[21:26] that didn't get on tape
[21:28] then we find in the archive somewhere
[21:30] the one that brother branham preached
[21:32] that explains it all and we've missed it
[21:34] for 50 some years no i'm not waiting for
[21:36] that he has already revealed and he
[21:37] already shows it
[21:39] so i need to go back and say god give me
[21:41] eye savvy man give me ears to hear lord
[21:44] you've already opened the seals you've
[21:46] already revealed it in the ministry amen
[21:49] of that seventh angel god help me to
[21:52] reveal to me what you revealed and show
[21:53] me what you've shown
[21:56] and if we can go with that attitude then
[21:58] you're going to see it keeps opening up
[22:00] and keeps opening up it's all there
[22:03] it's all there
[22:05] so
[22:06] so he goes on to say and now in this
[22:09] last day he has revealed it and shows it
[22:12] and god's help will see it right here
[22:15] this morning
[22:17] that's why i carry this book everywhere
[22:19] i go
[22:21] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[22:23] brother ben said when i preach this i'm
[22:24] preaching the entire bible this is the
[22:26] mystery that god had in the back part of
[22:27] his mind he wants to reveal it i i take
[22:30] from my text the entire bible i'm going
[22:32] to preach to you christ is the mystery
[22:33] of god revealed he shows it in every
[22:35] time it's been revealed it's been shown
[22:37] what was in the back part of god's mind
[22:38] and with god's help this morning i hope
[22:40] you'll see it that's why i never leave
[22:42] home without this book
[22:43] and every time i get to sit down i keep
[22:45] going back to this book amen because
[22:47] brother branham tells us what he's going
[22:49] to tell us
[22:51] and i said god help me to see
[22:53] what you've been telling us
[22:56] and god's help we'll see it right here
[22:57] this morning what the lord has had in
[22:59] his mind all along and has expressed it
[23:02] was brother ben going to talk about this
[23:04] during this message what god has had in
[23:06] his mind all along and has expressed it
[23:09] that's the mystery the goal the plan the
[23:12] purpose the one thing that god wanted to
[23:15] achieve
[23:16] and brother ben's going to preach about
[23:17] it and christ is the mystery of god
[23:19] revealed
[23:20] i love it
[23:22] that's why i said in the beginning you
[23:24] can't start this message with the wrong
[23:26] mental picture
[23:28] or else you'll never get to what he's
[23:30] trying to express
[23:31] we'll see it in one portion of the
[23:34] manifestation when god was all wrapped
[23:36] up in one vessel in jesus christ in the
[23:39] 2000 years we'll see it there but we'll
[23:41] miss it before and we'll miss it after
[23:45] but we've got to see it through the
[23:46] whole thing
[23:48] now he says therefore you can see the
[23:50] great meaning of what it's been to know
[23:52] this and then try to bring it to the
[23:54] people and then you i haven't went into
[23:57] details to try to explain it as god has
[24:00] revealed it to me so brother benham has
[24:02] already received the revelation he
[24:04] hasn't went in great detail yet to try
[24:06] to explain it but with god's help he was
[24:08] going to try to show it this morning
[24:11] praise be to god i think we can all read
[24:13] that book again
[24:14] listen to that tape
[24:16] now i'm going to read a few quotes and
[24:18] and and get into the what i desire to
[24:20] get into here but i want to uh set some
[24:23] background he said in trying to do god a
[24:25] service without it being god's will so
[24:27] now he reveals these things by his
[24:29] foreknowledge to those who he has
[24:31] ordained to these things otherwise they
[24:33] don't see it standing right there
[24:35] looking right at it and he can't see him
[24:38] now how many ever seen the picture of a
[24:40] cow in the bush that you just have to
[24:42] look and look and did you ever see that
[24:44] or seen the picture of christ in the
[24:45] bush or in the sky or clouds see that
[24:47] painter has got that so fixed up till
[24:50] you have to look at it just a certain
[24:52] way
[24:53] well then when you once see it you can't
[24:56] see nothing else but that
[24:58] this is going to become really important
[25:00] amen once you see it you can't see
[25:02] nothing else but that every time you
[25:05] look there it is how many seen those
[25:07] pictures well sure you have
[25:10] well that's the way christ is himself
[25:12] the gospel the message is when you once
[25:14] see the message of the hour there's
[25:16] nothing else you can see but that
[25:19] amen so once you once you catch this
[25:22] revelation brother ben is talking about
[25:24] once you see the picture that he's
[25:26] talking about that's the only thing you
[25:28] can see amen you can't see nothing else
[25:30] so when we go back to read our bible
[25:32] this is why brother branham could say
[25:34] after preaching the seals my bible
[25:36] became a new book amen and we're talking
[25:38] about a prophet of god with prophetic
[25:40] insight on the word and he had prophetic
[25:43] insight on the word for his duration of
[25:45] his ministry amen there's things he
[25:46] preached in the 50s that he confirms in
[25:48] the opening of the seals
[25:50] so the man had prophetic insight on the
[25:52] word he knew his bible thoroughly amen
[25:55] some people you know brother man makes
[25:56] that comment he said you know somebody
[25:58] told him brother brahm you don't know
[25:59] your bible very well he said that may be
[26:01] true but i know the author real well
[26:03] well that's true he knew the author but
[26:04] brother branham knew this bible
[26:08] he knew this bible when brother branham
[26:10] is preaching he may not always be
[26:11] quoting a bible verse but he's always
[26:13] preaching the bible
[26:15] he knows this but he's he knows this
[26:17] bible
[26:18] he knows it better than grammar
[26:21] if i could say it that way i'm probably
[26:23] not saying that right but he knows it
[26:25] better than grammar he knows it better
[26:27] than english he knows it better than
[26:29] greek or latin he knows it better than
[26:32] that amen it wasn't it wasn't the jotted
[26:34] tittles and pen marks that he knew he
[26:37] knew the very nature life character of
[26:40] this word
[26:42] brother branham could read a story about
[26:45] a character in the bible and out of that
[26:48] he could clean and glean a concept about
[26:50] god and carry that concept from that
[26:52] story and start preaching it amen and it
[26:55] sounds like that maybe he's misquoting
[26:57] the scripture or may maybe he uh doesn't
[27:00] remember the details just right so he's
[27:02] adding no he has caught the very core of
[27:05] what that that character is showing us
[27:07] or what that circumstance in the bible
[27:09] is showing us and he's preaching us the
[27:10] core meaning of that story
[27:14] and then somebody will look at the
[27:15] prophet and say you know he got that
[27:17] detail wrong and that wasn't how many
[27:18] people and it really wasn't in that
[27:20] chapter in the bible and i'm saying my
[27:23] goodness what does it matter amen you
[27:25] can know the chapter the verse the jot
[27:26] and the title and have no idea what's
[27:28] expressing what god is expressing from
[27:30] his heart amen to his
[27:32] children and that is where brother
[27:35] bennum knew this bible like nobody i've
[27:37] ever seen know this bible he knew the
[27:39] heart of the bible the mind of the bible
[27:41] the character of the bible the life
[27:43] coming through the bible
[27:45] and everything he preaches preaches that
[27:47] life that character that nature
[27:51] so people want to stumble over
[27:53] mispronunciations and mislocations and
[27:56] and partial scriptures and don't stumble
[27:58] at all get to the heart of the matter
[28:00] what is god trying to say
[28:04] so once you see this message
[28:08] when you see the message of the hour
[28:10] there's nothing else you can see
[28:12] but that
[28:13] that's all everything else is gone the
[28:15] rest of it's just a filler see when you
[28:17] once see this message when you once see
[28:20] this message i mean when you see it amen
[28:22] not see you know that we got 1200 and
[28:24] some tapes and
[28:26] churches here and there we had a prophet
[28:28] and he lived from this year and i'm
[28:29] talking about seeing the message
[28:32] that's not seeing the message that's
[28:33] looking at historical accounts and
[28:35] understanding facts but that is not
[28:37] knowing but once you see this message
[28:39] nothing else compares to it
[28:42] there's nothing else that'll touch it
[28:43] there's nothing else amen once you see
[28:45] this message could you ever go back to
[28:48] your former understanding
[28:50] i'll tell you what i i by the grace of
[28:53] god he opened our eyes 20 some years ago
[28:56] to the message of the hour i was raised
[28:58] all my life in a pentecostal church amen
[29:00] and i can say without a shadow of a
[29:02] doubt i would never never want to go
[29:05] back to where i was
[29:07] to the pentecostal church but where i
[29:09] was was the best i knew at the time but
[29:10] i would never want to go back
[29:13] but i'll tell you this god has continued
[29:15] to unfold himself i don't want to go
[29:17] back one year
[29:19] i don't want to go back to my previous
[29:21] understanding a year ago amen i don't
[29:23] want to go back to what i was five years
[29:24] ago amen once you see the message and
[29:27] keep seeing the message there's no
[29:28] desire to return back even to my own
[29:31] conception two or three years ago
[29:34] i said god i want to see more amen i
[29:37] want to keep moving deeper and further
[29:38] and higher in you i i there's no going
[29:41] back so we can say there's you know
[29:43] there's no going back to a previous age
[29:45] that's absolutely true but for me i
[29:47] don't want to go back to a previous
[29:48] understanding
[29:51] even if you say in the message when i
[29:53] was serving god with all my heart when i
[29:55] was believing the message with all that
[29:57] was in me to believe it and i saw all
[29:59] that i could see i still don't want to
[30:01] go back to that
[30:02] i want to keep moving forward
[30:06] he said now
[30:09] everything else is gone the rest of it's
[30:10] just filler see when you once see the
[30:12] message
[30:14] that was in noah's time
[30:16] we know in his group when they saw the
[30:18] message nothing else mattered
[30:20] when moses group saw it nothing else
[30:22] mattered when john's group saw it
[30:24] nothing else mattered when jesus group
[30:26] saw it nothing else mattered when the
[30:28] apostles group saw it nothing else
[30:30] mattered when luther's group saw it
[30:32] wesley's group saw it pentecostal groups
[30:34] saw it nothing else mattered they pulled
[30:37] away from everything
[30:40] amen
[30:41] can you say that once you saw this
[30:42] message nothing else mattered
[30:45] amen
[30:47] it wasn't
[30:49] uh i could say it
[30:52] express it from my own personal uh
[30:54] experience
[30:55] nobody took anything from me
[30:59] when i saw the message
[31:01] nobody took from us entertainment our tv
[31:05] the clothes we wore nobody took from us
[31:08] our revelation or understanding nobody
[31:10] took anything from me i dropped
[31:12] everything to grab a hold of this
[31:16] that's why if somebody feels like
[31:17] they've given up something from the
[31:19] message then
[31:20] my question is what revelation do you
[31:22] have of the message
[31:24] because if you have to give up something
[31:26] to come to the message then you don't
[31:27] really understand what the message is
[31:29] because the message is christ and
[31:30] there's only gain there's no loss
[31:34] so if we have to feel like we've given
[31:36] up or forsaken or lost something to come
[31:39] to the message then maybe we don't have
[31:41] a clear understanding yet of what the
[31:43] message is maybe to us it's just maybe a
[31:46] better form of understanding and to be
[31:48] in the better or correct form of
[31:50] understanding i've got to uh i've got to
[31:52] adhere to certain standards and certain
[31:55] things that the prophet taught so in
[31:56] adherence to a better or more perfect
[31:59] understanding i'm willing to give up
[32:01] this
[32:03] that's the wrong revelation
[32:07] that is the absolute wrong revelation
[32:10] and i think that's why sometimes people
[32:12] find themselves so frustrated i've
[32:15] talked to people who've been frustrated
[32:17] in the message and frustrated about
[32:19] rules and frustrated about standards and
[32:21] frustrated and i'm wondering why are
[32:22] they frustrating because i i cannot
[32:25] relate because it's not frustrating for
[32:27] me
[32:28] and that's that's not a statement of
[32:31] arrogance or pride it's an actual
[32:33] inability to relate
[32:35] so i've wondered and questioned why why
[32:37] is it frustrating why do you feel so
[32:40] cheated why do you feel so robbed why do
[32:43] you feel like you've missed out on
[32:44] something because for me i feel like
[32:46] paul said i gave it up and to me it was
[32:49] done
[32:50] it was all but done i realized it was
[32:53] worthless it wasn't helping me it didn't
[32:55] do anything for me amen but this message
[32:57] is my life amen it's my origin it
[33:00] expresses to me where i originated from
[33:02] where i'm going to amen there was zero
[33:04] loss amen when the prophet of god
[33:07] started saying something about you know
[33:09] conduct or dress or or television or
[33:12] entertainment for me i was like
[33:14] something inside said that's right
[33:17] now my face my flesh
[33:20] did not enjoy cutting off the
[33:22] tv
[33:24] but my soul was liberated
[33:29] amen
[33:31] your flesh may not enjoy
[33:33] putting down the cigarettes giving up
[33:35] the alcohol or dropping the
[33:36] entertainment
[33:38] but if you really catch this message
[33:40] your soul will fly
[33:43] say this is what i've wanted all my life
[33:45] amen
[33:47] praise be to god
[33:49] god is so good to us friends
[33:52] once you see this message
[33:54] brother bram says
[33:56] there's nothing else that you can see
[33:59] but that
[34:02] amen let's turn to matthew 11.
[34:22] matthew chapter 11
[34:24] and verse 25
[34:30] he says at this time jesus answered and
[34:32] said i thank thee o father lord of
[34:33] heaven and earth because thou has hid
[34:35] these things from the wise and prudent
[34:38] has revealed them unto un them unto
[34:40] babes even so father for so it seemed
[34:43] good in thy sight
[34:46] let's go over to luke chapter 8.
[34:53] luke chapter 8
[34:55] verse 9.
[35:05] luke 8 9 and his disciples asked him
[35:07] saying what might this parable be
[35:09] and he said unto you it is given to know
[35:11] the mysteries of the kingdom of god
[35:13] but to others in parables that seeing
[35:15] they may not see
[35:17] and hearing they may not understand
[35:20] so jesus is saying father i thank you
[35:23] that you hid this
[35:24] from the eyes of the wise and the
[35:26] prudent and revealed them unto babes
[35:28] what babes babes of the kingdom children
[35:30] of god
[35:32] and he tells the disciples i'm speaking
[35:34] in parables
[35:36] because they're not to see the mysteries
[35:38] are only for you so don't forget our
[35:40] title our title this morning is the uh i
[35:43] don't remember what title is let me know
[35:45] the mystery in plain sight
[35:48] the mystery in plain sight remember when
[35:50] brother branham preached god
[35:52] hiding and hidden and revealed in
[35:54] simplicity hiding himself in simplicity
[35:57] revealing himself the same he also hides
[35:59] himself in plain sight but only reveals
[36:02] it to the babes
[36:04] so
[36:05] everybody has the bible
[36:08] everybody who wants the bible has the
[36:10] bible
[36:11] anybody who wants to can read about the
[36:13] seals amen you can read
[36:15] in revelation chapter 6 amen but god
[36:19] must unlock the understanding god must
[36:21] give us eyes to see so he has to put it
[36:24] in plain sight but he must hide it
[36:27] because that's what he chose to do he
[36:29] chose to make it available amen and make
[36:32] it completely unavailable
[36:35] it's available anybody can pick up this
[36:38] bible and read and anybody can find the
[36:40] message you can find it on the internet
[36:42] you can find it from a friend you can
[36:43] get books for free tapes for free go on
[36:46] several different places online and
[36:48] listen to it for free or read it for
[36:49] free anybody can find this message and
[36:52] read it anybody can have a bible who
[36:54] wants to have a bible
[36:55] at least anybody in america
[36:57] and so you see that god made it
[37:00] available amen but he made it available
[37:03] but yet it's hidden because it takes a
[37:05] key to unlock what you're looking at
[37:08] because what you're looking at is in
[37:09] mystery form amen but yet he's been
[37:12] expressing this great mystery all the
[37:14] way through the bible so the bible is an
[37:17] expression of god's one great goal
[37:20] but nobody knows what that great goal is
[37:22] unless god has un given you a key in
[37:25] your heart of faith and that faith will
[37:27] now unlock the program of god and you go
[37:30] back and look at your bible and say it's
[37:32] a new book
[37:35] he says in the in the messy spiritual
[37:37] food and due season we find out that
[37:39] when a man comes sent from god ordained
[37:41] of god with the truth thus saith the
[37:43] lord the message and the messenger are
[37:45] one and the same
[37:47] because he is sent to represent thus
[37:49] saith the lord word by word so he in his
[37:52] message is the same
[37:54] amen
[37:56] amen
[37:58] a denominational man under
[37:59] denominational auspices he in the church
[38:02] is one a theologian under theology made
[38:04] by some denomination he and his message
[38:06] are one church of theology a theologian
[38:09] it's correctly
[38:10] then when a man comes with us saith the
[38:12] lord he in the message is one
[38:15] and when elijah come with us saith the
[38:17] lord he and his message become one just
[38:20] as jesus when he come he was the word
[38:22] saint john 1. so the word of god and the
[38:24] messenger of the age was the self-same
[38:26] thing all the time that's right
[38:30] this is good
[38:31] jesus was the word that was prophesied
[38:33] of he was what the prophet said would
[38:35] happen a virgin shall conceive and bears
[38:38] child way back in the beginning god told
[38:40] him said a woman's seed shall bruise the
[38:42] serpent's head and he'll and he'll
[38:45] bruise her heel all these prophecies had
[38:47] been given david crying all the rest of
[38:49] the prophets down through the ages
[38:51] speaking of him he was the word
[38:53] manifested hallelujah
[38:55] now do you see where i'm trying to get
[38:57] to i spoke with you pretty plain this
[38:59] morning don't you see the authority of
[39:01] the living god in the living church the
[39:03] bride
[39:04] now he's talking about the authority of
[39:06] the living god and the living church the
[39:08] bride
[39:10] the sick are healed the dead are raised
[39:12] the cripples walk the blind seed the
[39:14] gospel goes forth and its power for the
[39:16] message and the messenger are the same
[39:18] the word is in the church in the person
[39:22] now the word the messenger and his
[39:24] message become the same
[39:27] so brother frank if you could help me
[39:28] turn on this uh
[39:30] the whiteboard
[39:33] he says in the feast of trumpets he said
[39:34] look i want to say one more thing
[39:36] closely now don't miss
[39:38] how striking from the seventh angel's
[39:41] message brother ben was talking about
[39:42] something else but he's injecting a
[39:44] statement i want to glean out of this he
[39:46] said from the seventh angel's message
[39:49] to revelation 10 was the seventh seal to
[39:52] the seventh trumpet between those times
[39:53] so he's trying to tell you that between
[39:56] the the the sixth trump and the seventh
[39:58] trumpet revelations 10 is inserted in
[40:00] there
[40:01] so he's trying to tell you that but he
[40:03] injects a thought that i want to catch
[40:05] he says don't miss it how striking from
[40:07] the seventh angel's message
[40:09] messenger of the seventh seal so brother
[40:12] branham the seventh angel is the
[40:14] messenger of the seventh seal
[40:19] and
[40:20] in the messenger and his message become
[40:22] the same thing
[40:25] you catch that
[40:27] he's the messenger of the seventh seal
[40:30] and the messenger and his message become
[40:31] the same thing
[40:33] so he becomes a manifestation of the
[40:35] seventh seal
[40:38] which is what christ in you the hope of
[40:40] glory
[40:42] amen the coming of the son of man
[40:45] amen a son of man revealing the son of
[40:47] man he becomes his life becomes the word
[40:50] for that age his ministry becomes the
[40:53] ministry the he's the messenger of the
[40:56] seventh seal his life becomes a display
[40:59] of the seventh seal the son of man
[41:01] ministry has returned
[41:04] he says now
[41:08] in the questions and answers he says now
[41:10] in that day the prophet was the word for
[41:12] he was the manifestation of the word
[41:15] to
[41:16] the world
[41:18] he was the manifestation of the word to
[41:21] the world
[41:22] amen and then he says
[41:24] who do you say this is say there's a
[41:26] woman standing here i'm a young man
[41:27] waiting to get married she meets me
[41:29] specifically in every way she she's a
[41:32] lovely christian she looks like one she
[41:34] dresses like one she acts like one she
[41:37] lives like one i'll admit she'd make me
[41:39] a good wife but she isn't mine till i
[41:41] take her for mine
[41:44] that's the way the message is you can
[41:45] sympathize with it and say it's right
[41:47] but you've got to take it yourself to
[41:49] become part of it
[41:52] then you and the message becomes one
[41:57] then the anointings with you as it as it
[42:00] is with others
[42:02] amen so we're gonna uh write something
[42:06] here so
[42:07] when in the first coming
[42:15] in the first coming
[42:17] you have
[42:26] a forerunner
[42:30] so that's john the baptist
[42:33] and the forerunner was a voice that went
[42:36] crying in the wilderness prepare you the
[42:37] way of the lord make path and make his
[42:39] path straight he was preparing the
[42:41] people through repentance amen for the
[42:43] coming of the lord and so now in the he
[42:46] had the forerunner ministry he and his
[42:49] message became the same thing because he
[42:51] was the forerunner and he was the he was
[42:53] the message of forerunner he was showing
[42:55] for running and he was ministering
[42:57] repentance and preparing for forerunning
[43:00] but then
[43:02] the thing that he foreran came on the
[43:04] scene
[43:06] and that was jesus christ
[43:10] so you had won
[43:12] two vessels
[43:14] amen when brother eugene brown was here
[43:16] a couple years ago he first went through
[43:17] this with us and that's the first time i
[43:19] i saw this he did a little diagram up
[43:21] here if you remember
[43:23] but when we come over here
[43:25] to the second coming
[43:30] the coming of the son of man
[43:34] you had a forerunner
[43:37] which was elijah
[43:41] but the thing he foreran came in him
[43:49] son of man ministry
[43:54] so this caused some confusion
[43:58] because
[43:59] we're expecting this to be the same way
[44:04] and god always does the same thing but
[44:06] not necessarily the same way
[44:09] so he brought a forerunner an elijah
[44:11] again and and when he brought the
[44:13] forerunner he bought the forerunner and
[44:15] one vessel
[44:16] then he brought amen uh christ in
[44:19] another vessel and so now the forerunner
[44:22] and christ come together in the water
[44:25] and now the ministry moves to the son of
[44:29] man from the forerunner and and
[44:32] john now has to pass off of the scene
[44:36] that right
[44:37] so now when we come to the end of time
[44:39] we're looking for the coming of the son
[44:41] of man the son of man ministry to return
[44:42] on the earth amen and we notice that
[44:44] there's an elijah forerunner that has to
[44:46] come from malachi 4 and we see the
[44:48] forerunner coming so the forerunner
[44:50] comes amen and then then we have the
[44:53] opening of the seals we we have the the
[44:55] fullness of the word returning back into
[44:57] the church and then we have the
[44:59] forerunner amen beginning to say
[45:01] something like now now i if he's here i
[45:04] have to go off the scene two of us can't
[45:06] be here at the same time and so now we
[45:08] automatically start looking for another
[45:10] vessel
[45:13] because we're looking for a replication
[45:15] of the same thing but it's the same
[45:17] thing but not the same way
[45:21] now
[45:22] the very thing that that the ministry
[45:25] was forerunning amen he was here amen as
[45:28] a forerunner to turn the hearts back he
[45:29] was here for the opening of the seals in
[45:31] the opening of the seventh seal but but
[45:33] he becomes a display of the seventh seal
[45:37] the very life of jesus christ the very
[45:40] life that jesus christ lived on earth
[45:42] and galilee he was living through that
[45:44] man
[45:45] he would say i mean brother ben would
[45:47] stay on the platform he said you didn't
[45:48] touch me i'm just a man i'm 20 feet from
[45:52] you who did you touch you touched the
[45:53] lord jesus christ
[45:56] so christ was there amen he was present
[45:58] he was ministering the same way that he
[46:00] ministered 2 000 years ago
[46:04] so it was a sudden man revealing the son
[46:06] of man
[46:07] so now
[46:10] you can get can we can get confused
[46:14] if we look at and looking for a replica
[46:17] now there's a forerunner and brother
[46:20] branham tells us very clearly that he
[46:22] must come
[46:24] amen while the forerunners on earth
[46:28] is that true
[46:31] so like before he must come when the
[46:33] forerunners on earth and he said he said
[46:35] the seventh angel will be on earth at
[46:37] the time of this coming revelation 10.
[46:40] so now when we look at the previous okay
[46:43] we say well where did he go i mean
[46:45] where's he at he he's supposed to come
[46:47] now brother branham passes off the scene
[46:49] and now brother branham's when when god
[46:51] takes that vessel off of the scene now
[46:53] we're we're we're we're finding a
[46:56] question in people's hearts or there was
[46:57] in the past i thought amen he had to be
[47:00] on earth at the time of this coming
[47:02] maybe brother brennan made a mistake in
[47:04] the breach maybe he cleared it up later
[47:06] i don't understand what he's talking
[47:07] about because i didn't see a replica of
[47:10] what i saw
[47:12] 2 000 years ago but i'd say you saw the
[47:15] same thing amen you just didn't see it
[47:17] the same way
[47:20] and that's what causes confusion and he
[47:22] says now i must decrease and he must
[47:24] increase amendment and when john said
[47:26] that he could look to a physical person
[47:28] and he could say now this person his
[47:30] message is decreasing my
[47:32] mind's decreasing i'll go off the scene
[47:34] he continues on amen but now when we
[47:37] come to the end time the end time
[47:40] prophet amen the prophet becomes the
[47:41] word for that age and his message and
[47:43] the messenger become the same thing
[47:47] so now he's talking about the coming of
[47:49] the son of man the coming of the word
[47:51] amen the coming of the mighty angel amen
[47:53] in revelations 10 takes place and
[47:55] everything brother branham said in the
[47:57] breach is true
[48:01] so he comes
[48:04] but
[48:05] brother branham this ministry this time
[48:10] is a bride coming
[48:17] because the bridegroom already came
[48:22] the bridegroom was already expressed
[48:25] this coming was a bride coming of christ
[48:30] and so it said it could set in so much
[48:32] confusion unless we let the prophet be
[48:35] right
[48:36] and if we allow the prophet to be
[48:38] correct in what he says then all of a
[48:40] sudden you say amen brother that's right
[48:43] because now when christ is coming the
[48:46] son of man is coming he's coming in that
[48:48] form because brother branham is part of
[48:50] the bride also he's a forerunner but
[48:52] he's also a bride member
[48:56] brother branham brother branham was
[48:58] there to bridge a gap to take us from
[49:00] the denominational ages into the bright
[49:02] age so he himself was coming out of the
[49:06] denominational ages into the bright age
[49:08] he himself was bride
[49:11] he himself was resurrected out of dead
[49:13] denominationalism
[49:15] he himself amen was brought up by the
[49:18] revealing of the word he himself was
[49:19] part of the bride amen so the very
[49:22] ministry that he had the message he
[49:24] brought amen he and the message became
[49:25] the same thing so when you wanted to see
[49:27] the bright coming of christ you look at
[49:29] the forerunner who had received the
[49:31] fullness of the revelation and he was a
[49:33] member of the bride also
[49:37] amen
[49:38] let me keep going
[49:41] he says
[49:43] very familiar in the rising of the sun
[49:46] christ was the first one to raise from
[49:48] all the prophets and so forth although
[49:50] typed in many places he was the first
[49:51] fruits of those that slept
[49:53] in the bride coming of christ coming out
[49:56] of the church they'll have to be a sheaf
[49:58] waved again in the last days
[50:00] oh waving of a sheaf what is the sheath
[50:03] the first one that come to mature the
[50:06] first one that proved it was a wheat
[50:08] that proved it was a sheave
[50:10] hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm
[50:12] talking about it was waved over the
[50:14] people and the first time there will
[50:15] come forth for the bride age for a
[50:18] resurrection out of dark
[50:19] denominationalism will be a message that
[50:22] the full maturity of the word is turned
[50:23] back again in full power and being waved
[50:27] over the people by the same signs and
[50:29] wonders that he did back there amen my
[50:31] question is did that happen
[50:33] amen the first thing that comes forth
[50:36] here's what he said the first time there
[50:38] will come forth for the bright age
[50:41] for resurrection out of dark
[50:42] denominationalism will be a message amen
[50:46] the message
[50:48] the message that he is here
[50:52] will be a message that the full maturity
[50:54] of the word is turned back again in its
[50:56] full power
[50:58] and being waved over the people by the
[51:00] same sign and wonders so now
[51:03] that message and that messenger became
[51:04] the same thing now he's an expression of
[51:06] his message
[51:08] and his message is being caught called
[51:11] out of dead denomination and brought
[51:13] into a bride age the message is the
[51:15] bride coming of christ and now he
[51:17] becomes a reflection of that message
[51:21] praise be to god
[51:24] that's important
[51:27] all right
[51:28] let's keep going here so now i want to
[51:31] go back to this previous quote that i
[51:32] just read
[51:34] and who do you say this is from 1964.
[51:37] now he says
[51:39] he's talking about a woman that's there
[51:42] and he's saying that she couldn't make a
[51:43] good wife we just read this she meets
[51:45] every qualification every way she's
[51:47] lovely christian she looks like one she
[51:49] dresses like one acts like one she lives
[51:51] like one i'll admit she'd make me a good
[51:53] wife but she isn't mine till i take her
[51:55] for mine
[51:57] that's the way the message is you can
[51:59] sympathize with it and say it's right
[52:01] but you've got to take it yourself to
[52:04] become part of it then you and the
[52:06] message become one so now
[52:09] you and the message brother branham and
[52:10] his message became one but now we in the
[52:13] message have to become one
[52:15] and we can't get this by sympathizing
[52:17] with the message or acknowledging that
[52:19] it's right or probably the better way to
[52:21] live but no we must take the message
[52:24] which is christ with our day and take it
[52:26] into ourselves get in it get under it
[52:28] get in and get it in us however fully
[52:30] surrender fully cement fully give
[52:33] ourselves to this word and embrace it
[52:35] with everything that's in us and then
[52:37] you and the message become one
[52:40] what is the message it's the opening of
[52:42] the seals it's the opening of the
[52:44] seventh seal it's a return of the
[52:46] fullness of the word and life of christ
[52:48] it is the bright coming of christ that's
[52:50] the message and when you take that
[52:52] message into yourself you and the
[52:53] message become one so you become the
[52:56] bride coming of christ
[53:00] it's not something we talk about
[53:04] see the brother men tell us message
[53:05] isn't something we come together to talk
[53:07] about
[53:08] something we get into
[53:10] we get under this isn't teaching this
[53:12] isn't doctrine you know we have doctrine
[53:16] because doctrine is teaching that's
[53:17] that's that's right we want doctrine
[53:19] there's nothing wrong with doctrine i
[53:20] love doctrine
[53:22] doctrine is our teaching on the word we
[53:24] have doctrine amen we we even have a an
[53:28] understanding of what's pleasing to god
[53:30] in the way we fashion ourselves and the
[53:32] way we conduct ourselves so we have
[53:34] order we have structure we have church
[53:36] order we have all of that in the message
[53:38] but all of that is not the message
[53:42] we it's included because you can't have
[53:45] the word without having doctrine you
[53:46] can't have the word without having order
[53:49] you can't have the word without having
[53:50] somebody that obeyed the word and submit
[53:52] to it all of that is part of it but if
[53:54] we have obedience and doctrine and
[53:56] understanding and all of these things
[53:58] that's still not the same as having the
[54:00] message amen because the message is a
[54:02] person amen the message is the person of
[54:04] jesus christ and it's time for him to
[54:06] manifest on this earth in a
[54:09] mini-membered bride that is the message
[54:11] of the hour the bride coming of christ
[54:13] it is not something we talk about it's
[54:15] something we are
[54:18] you can't talk about the message and be
[54:20] in the message the message must be in
[54:22] you and you and the message must become
[54:24] the same thing that's the message
[54:28] so the message is not comparing dates
[54:30] and times brother branham lived this
[54:32] time and he preached these series
[54:34] these series of messages he did these
[54:36] miracles that's that's yet not what god
[54:40] wants in this hour
[54:43] god wants a people
[54:46] and himself the word
[54:48] to become the self same thing
[54:52] so that we become
[54:54] the message
[54:57] so you can say what is the message
[55:01] and you can say by the grace of god i am
[55:03] the
[55:04] message remember brother bam told us
[55:07] that all time when somebody went looking
[55:09] for the welsh revival where's the wealth
[55:10] revival and they were looking for the
[55:12] location of the wealth revival and then
[55:14] you know they went to a policeman and he
[55:16] said i am the welsh revival
[55:18] remember reverend said you've arrived
[55:21] you're here because the revival's in me
[55:24] where do i find the message the messages
[55:26] of people on this earth that have the
[55:28] very life of jesus christ the mind of
[55:31] god has been open to them the mystery
[55:33] has been taken off of the word it's
[55:34] implanted into the hearts of the people
[55:36] and now they're becoming one with it and
[55:38] the thing that they're seeing they're
[55:39] starting to reflect
[55:41] they're starting to live the very thing
[55:43] that they're looking at amen and that is
[55:45] the message friends
[55:48] that's why if we if we stop with some
[55:51] correct teaching and a good church
[55:53] structure amen and get everybody looking
[55:55] right and dressing right and we stop and
[55:57] we set up camp there i'm telling you
[55:59] we're gonna very very quickly find
[56:01] ourselves outside the message
[56:04] we may not even be contradicting what
[56:06] brother branham taught or contradicting
[56:09] his order or saying that he's wrong amen
[56:11] but not moving in with the life of
[56:13] christ as christ is revealing himself
[56:15] and we're not moving and ebbing and
[56:17] flowing with the revelation of the hour
[56:19] we're going to find ourselves stuck back
[56:22] here in an order a structure a form amen
[56:25] and not moving with christ as he wants
[56:27] to display himself in this end time
[56:33] amen that's why i don't want to go back
[56:35] to a former understanding
[56:38] because as god reveals himself more amen
[56:42] i find within me a greater love and a
[56:44] greater desire for him a greater
[56:46] obedience and a greater surrender amen
[56:49] and it didn't come from a stronger
[56:51] willpower amen it come from a greater
[56:53] revelation
[56:56] so as he unvoted himself to me
[56:58] i find in me amen uh just a natural
[57:02] surrender as he reveals himself to me
[57:06] so
[57:08] so we don't want
[57:10] oh i say we don't want structure we do
[57:12] want structure we do want order we do
[57:13] want form
[57:15] we want the doctrine we want we want the
[57:16] standards we want all of it
[57:20] but what god really wanted
[57:22] was to live in a people
[57:25] and fullness
[57:26] on this earth and express the entire
[57:29] mystery through her
[57:31] that's really what he wants in this hour
[57:34] that's why we can give
[57:37] we can give fervent obedience and still
[57:40] have missed the mind of god
[57:45] we can give fervent effort
[57:47] to be in church every time the doors are
[57:49] open
[57:50] pray and read my bible every day
[57:53] but we could still miss the whole
[57:55] purpose and whole plan of god
[57:57] but being fervent
[57:59] in our religious efforts
[58:02] so that's not what we want
[58:04] we want
[58:06] you
[58:07] you've got to
[58:08] well brother brahm's saying you've got
[58:10] to take it yourself
[58:12] to become part of it
[58:15] then you and the message become one
[58:19] then this is the part that's exciting
[58:22] then the anointings with you as it is
[58:25] with others
[58:27] see you we've heard so many people say
[58:30] sometimes i believe the message i just
[58:32] can't live it
[58:33] you ever heard that
[58:35] well i agree with you one thousand
[58:37] percent
[58:38] i believe the message and i can't live
[58:40] it
[58:42] so i quit trying to live it and i just
[58:44] embraced it amen and when i embraced it
[58:46] and received it he lived it through me
[58:48] amen it wasn't anymore me living it now
[58:51] that doesn't mean we never have a choice
[58:52] to make we never have a decision to make
[58:54] we never sacrificed that that's not i'm
[58:56] not saying we still have our own choices
[58:58] to make but really my choice is my
[59:00] feeble effort to make choices would
[59:02] never get me to the destination i would
[59:04] always find myself frustrated trying to
[59:06] live the message saying i believe the
[59:08] message but i can't live the message
[59:10] well really you believe about the
[59:12] message but you not yet met the person
[59:14] of the message because if you meet the
[59:16] person of the message and embrace that
[59:18] person that person will enter into you
[59:20] and live the message out of you
[59:24] that's what brother ben was saying you
[59:26] become you take it to yourself to become
[59:28] part of it then you and the message
[59:29] become one then the anointings with you
[59:32] as it is with the others because you
[59:34] can't do anything without an anointing
[59:36] and if you're trying to use your own
[59:37] human mind and effort you're gonna find
[59:39] yourself failed failed failed failed
[59:41] failed
[59:42] frustrated ready to quit ready to give
[59:44] up knowing that the message is true but
[59:47] i must be serpency
[59:52] i would never in million years confess
[59:54] such a thing
[59:56] no matter whatever passes through your
[59:58] mind never let a statement like that
[59:59] come out of your mouth
[1:00:01] but you say i believe by the grace of
[1:00:04] god i'm one of his and i just want to
[1:00:06] throw my whole self into this word i
[1:00:09] want to receive it with everything
[1:00:10] that's in me amen and we've got to stop
[1:00:13] reading the message looking for rules
[1:00:15] and start reading the message looking
[1:00:16] for him
[1:00:18] [Music]
[1:00:20] because
[1:00:25] the message can be used falsely as a
[1:00:27] safety net
[1:00:32] and it's a wrong concept
[1:00:35] that because i know the message is true
[1:00:38] and if i do all i can to do it brother
[1:00:40] branham said i'll be okay
[1:00:43] and so we're we're not and that's where
[1:00:46] this frustration trying to live the
[1:00:47] message and and always living in
[1:00:50] compromise always trying to find out
[1:00:52] where the gray area is and what's okay
[1:00:54] and what's not okay i mean sometimes you
[1:00:56] talk to people and they're always trying
[1:00:59] to get something to fit
[1:01:02] some habit some lifestyle something they
[1:01:05] enjoy doing whatever it is you find you
[1:01:07] find somebody's always trying to find
[1:01:08] justification in the message for it
[1:01:11] no i said well brother branham said this
[1:01:13] and brother brahm said that and i want
[1:01:14] my justification listen i think we
[1:01:16] should always study the message and we
[1:01:18] should always find the mind of christ
[1:01:19] through the word of god and through the
[1:01:20] message of the hour and when brother ben
[1:01:22] explains something we should take he did
[1:01:23] that and let that influence our lives
[1:01:25] but you can come to that with the wrong
[1:01:27] concept and try to use the message as a
[1:01:30] safety net to say if i can find an
[1:01:32] allowance in the quotes
[1:01:36] if i can find a place where i can still
[1:01:39] do this have this and then enjoy this
[1:01:41] and still be in the message then i am in
[1:01:44] the safety net in the message and i'll
[1:01:46] be okay listen that is zero personal
[1:01:49] relationship with jesus christ that is
[1:01:51] nothing more than using the message as a
[1:01:53] form of religion to find a path to
[1:01:56] heaven
[1:02:01] and it's the wrong concept
[1:02:04] now listen the truth is a razor's edge
[1:02:06] because i believe that god shared his
[1:02:08] mind through that prophet
[1:02:11] and what he said is subject to be lived
[1:02:13] by
[1:02:15] so don't get me wrong i'm not rejecting
[1:02:18] anything that he said i'm telling you
[1:02:19] you can accept what he said and use it
[1:02:22] the wrong way for the wrong kind of
[1:02:23] justification and still not be seeking
[1:02:26] the person of the word
[1:02:30] i want to ask you what did god want
[1:02:33] did god want a correct church that had
[1:02:36] all the doctrine right and could all sit
[1:02:38] in nice little rows and look right or
[1:02:40] did he want a wife
[1:02:43] someone to know him
[1:02:45] to love him to have communion with him
[1:02:49] so we can't use the message as a
[1:02:52] structure to find acceptance with god we
[1:02:54] use the message to find god
[1:02:57] it's the word expressing himself to us
[1:03:01] it's a love letter to us for that we
[1:03:03] would know him we're not here to find a
[1:03:05] structure we're here to find the person
[1:03:08] and to embrace the person and become one
[1:03:10] with the person and then
[1:03:13] the message you and the message become
[1:03:15] one then the anointings with you
[1:03:18] as it was with others
[1:03:21] amen
[1:03:22] let's keep going
[1:03:24] in god's power to transform
[1:03:27] that word has come to pass it's god's
[1:03:29] word plan it in your heart
[1:03:31] if you want to go in a rapture if you
[1:03:32] want to be a christian genuine place
[1:03:34] this word as i believe it was ezekiel
[1:03:36] god said take the scroll and eat it up
[1:03:40] and the prophet in the word would become
[1:03:43] the same and every promise in there has
[1:03:46] to manifest itself because it's god's
[1:03:49] original seed
[1:03:51] so brother ben was telling us he's going
[1:03:52] back to ezekiel where he was told to
[1:03:53] take the scroll and eat the scroll and
[1:03:56] he's saying he told that's the word and
[1:03:58] symbolized the word eat the word to
[1:04:00] become one with the word so that you and
[1:04:02] the word become the same thing
[1:04:04] so you see
[1:04:06] ezekiel wasn't told to read the scroll
[1:04:10] he was told to eat the squirrel
[1:04:14] i'd say it this way i
[1:04:16] i
[1:04:18] i got to be careful how i say this
[1:04:21] i'm not encouraging you to read the
[1:04:22] message
[1:04:24] i want you to eat the message
[1:04:27] i'm not encouraging you to read your
[1:04:29] bible i want you to feed on your bible
[1:04:31] amen i want you to take it inside amen
[1:04:34] take it i mean let's take our the word
[1:04:36] of god and take it inside to us and
[1:04:38] become one with it and embrace it and
[1:04:40] love it and give everything to it and
[1:04:42] receive it in its fullness
[1:04:45] we're gonna i want to stop
[1:04:47] oh
[1:04:48] if somebody would take one little clip
[1:04:49] of what i said i'm gonna be in a big
[1:04:51] trouble
[1:04:55] no longer do i want to read the message
[1:04:58] i want to feed on christ
[1:05:01] i want to eat the book i want to become
[1:05:03] one with it i want to get all of my
[1:05:05] nutrients all of my vitamins everything
[1:05:07] i need for spiritual survival i want to
[1:05:09] become the contents of that book i want
[1:05:11] the contents of the book to be in me and
[1:05:13] i want to live i want it to live outside
[1:05:15] out of me amen
[1:05:18] amen let's go to revelation chapter 10
[1:05:20] and read this in our day
[1:05:36] i i changed something in a prayer of
[1:05:39] mine a couple years ago
[1:05:42] as god was opening the word so much to
[1:05:44] me
[1:05:45] because i had been in the message for
[1:05:46] many years and
[1:05:48] loved the word loved everything about it
[1:05:50] loved every tape i listened to every
[1:05:52] book i read loved my bible loved the
[1:05:54] church loved everything but as god was
[1:05:57] quickly beginning to open the word to me
[1:05:59] i started seeing
[1:06:01] it was just a love affair there was such
[1:06:02] joy in my heart amen
[1:06:04] and that's why brother branham said that
[1:06:06] the wine that they that they get drunk
[1:06:08] on is the stimulation of revelation it
[1:06:10] is exciting it is thrilling when christ
[1:06:12] opens himself
[1:06:14] to us
[1:06:15] and i begin to enjoy that so much amen
[1:06:18] that communion with the lord as he
[1:06:19] revealed himself to me and and as i was
[1:06:22] becoming one with him and i stopped
[1:06:25] reading my bible to understand something
[1:06:30] and i started reading my bible to
[1:06:31] understand someone
[1:06:35] and when i would pick up my bible i said
[1:06:37] lord would you reveal yourself to me in
[1:06:38] this bible
[1:06:40] and that was a simple prayer but it was
[1:06:43] profound for me because my attitude was
[1:06:45] changing
[1:06:46] i wasn't reading any form or to have the
[1:06:49] correct information
[1:06:52] and that's how i used to read the bible
[1:06:54] not because i was bad i wanted the
[1:06:55] correct information
[1:06:57] and you read the bible you'll get the
[1:06:59] correct information there's nothing
[1:07:00] wrong with that
[1:07:01] my main motivation was to get the
[1:07:03] correct information so that i would know
[1:07:05] the truth
[1:07:08] but god gave us his word not so that we
[1:07:11] would sit in the millennium over against
[1:07:13] the tree and hold our bible and read
[1:07:15] this word but so that we would become
[1:07:17] one with him and know him
[1:07:19] and have a relationship with him and
[1:07:20] become his bride in the millennium
[1:07:23] so i love my bible because my bible is
[1:07:26] expressing him and i'm reading my bible
[1:07:28] to understand him i'm reading my bible
[1:07:30] to come into a greater unity with him
[1:07:32] but it's all about a unity with him
[1:07:36] that's why you have some people
[1:07:38] we can be guilty of this both ways we
[1:07:41] can become so intellectual we miss the
[1:07:43] personal relationship and just get the
[1:07:44] information
[1:07:46] and we can become so spiritual we just
[1:07:48] want to write
[1:07:49] a relationship but no information
[1:07:52] so we have we what we have then under
[1:07:55] that when we re leave the word out of
[1:07:57] our relationship no message no
[1:07:59] revelation no bible we just say i just
[1:08:01] love him i just want to know him
[1:08:03] i don't need to know all that
[1:08:05] information i just want him
[1:08:07] well you got to be careful because if
[1:08:09] you leave out the revelation of the word
[1:08:11] and just try to embrace him that you're
[1:08:12] going to find that you have a crush on
[1:08:14] somebody that you're not even in a
[1:08:15] relationship with
[1:08:18] you're infatuated with somebody amen
[1:08:21] that you're not even in a relationship
[1:08:22] with because he is the person of the
[1:08:24] word you cannot leave out the word and
[1:08:26] have the person
[1:08:29] so we must bring this together amen
[1:08:31] where we get the revelation of the word
[1:08:33] because that revelation is unveiling him
[1:08:36] and then we embrace the one who's been
[1:08:38] unveiled to us
[1:08:40] and it becomes a relationship a oneness
[1:08:43] a unity
[1:08:44] then we take the word into ourselves
[1:08:47] and become
[1:08:49] the manifestation
[1:08:51] of the message
[1:08:53] revelations 10 8
[1:09:00] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[1:09:02] spake unto me again and said go
[1:09:04] and take the little book which is open
[1:09:06] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[1:09:07] upon the sea and upon the earth
[1:09:09] and i went unto the angel and said unto
[1:09:11] him give me the little book and he said
[1:09:13] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[1:09:15] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[1:09:17] be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i
[1:09:19] took the little book out of the angel's
[1:09:21] hand and ate it up and it was in my
[1:09:23] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i
[1:09:25] had eaten it my belly was bitter
[1:09:27] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:09:29] again before many peoples nations
[1:09:32] tongues
[1:09:33] and kings
[1:09:35] now we know john here in the vision he's
[1:09:37] told to go and take the book
[1:09:39] and that book was the open book amen
[1:09:41] where the seals had been opened that the
[1:09:42] mighty angel had brought down and he
[1:09:44] goes and he takes the book which is the
[1:09:46] revelation of jesus christ the
[1:09:48] revelation of the mind of god the book
[1:09:50] of redemption the open bible all of
[1:09:52] those things and he's told to take it
[1:09:54] and eat it up and then he's told
[1:09:57] once again the instruction was not to
[1:09:59] read it
[1:10:01] but to eat it
[1:10:03] i said god help us to feast on this word
[1:10:07] but then they're supposed to prophesy
[1:10:09] again so then after they eat it there's
[1:10:11] still a message that goes out and when
[1:10:13] you eat it amen now your message
[1:10:17] and the messenger become the same
[1:10:21] because now what are we prophesying
[1:10:23] again what does the bride when she eats
[1:10:24] this book prophesy again she prophesies
[1:10:27] the contents of the book
[1:10:29] not anything new what she's received but
[1:10:32] now what she received is in her she's
[1:10:34] sharing who she is she's resharing
[1:10:36] what's going on inside of her she's
[1:10:38] sharing the message but she is the
[1:10:40] message sharing the message just like
[1:10:42] brother branham was the message sharing
[1:10:44] the message
[1:10:47] amen
[1:10:50] praise god brother brahman said in the
[1:10:52] crisis the mystery god revealed he said
[1:10:54] that's it christ the word he was the
[1:10:56] word he is the word and the church
[1:10:59] becomes the word by him making her part
[1:11:01] of him and that's the word again
[1:11:06] amen and again in christ as the mystery
[1:11:08] god revealed it says he is expressing
[1:11:10] himself that's his purpose that's why he
[1:11:13] died that's the second fold of his
[1:11:15] threefold manifestation first to express
[1:11:17] himself in christ then express himself
[1:11:20] through the church and the same thing
[1:11:22] christ was the word and the church
[1:11:23] becomes the word when it lets the word
[1:11:26] go through them
[1:11:29] it's a surrender to the word it's a
[1:11:31] submission to the word the church
[1:11:34] becomes the word when it lets the word
[1:11:36] go through them
[1:11:38] i want to turn to luke let's turn to
[1:11:40] luke chapter 1.
[1:11:50] and let's start at verse 34.
[1:11:52] luke chapter 1 and verse 34.
[1:12:06] then said mary unto the angel how shall
[1:12:08] this be seeing i know not a man
[1:12:10] and the angel answered and said unto her
[1:12:12] the holy ghost shall come upon thee and
[1:12:14] the power of the highest shall
[1:12:15] overshadow thee therefore also that holy
[1:12:18] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[1:12:19] be called the son of
[1:12:21] and behold thy cousin elizabeth shall
[1:12:24] she also she hath also conceived a son
[1:12:27] in her old age and this is the sixth
[1:12:29] month with her who was called barren for
[1:12:31] with god nothing shall be impossible and
[1:12:33] mary said behold the handmaid of the
[1:12:35] lord be it unto me according to thy word
[1:12:38] and the angel departed from her
[1:12:40] now
[1:12:41] mary
[1:12:43] became the word
[1:12:45] by letting the word flow through her
[1:12:48] is that right
[1:12:50] mary was predestinated before the
[1:12:52] foundation of the world to be the vessel
[1:12:55] that god would bring the fulfillment of
[1:12:57] isaiah's prophecy a virgin shall
[1:12:58] conceive she was predestinated to be
[1:13:01] that fulfillment but she had to receive
[1:13:03] the message and so one day she was
[1:13:05] walking along and an angel of the lord
[1:13:06] came to bring her the message and that
[1:13:09] message was not information that message
[1:13:12] was her place in the in the plan of god
[1:13:15] so when that angel brought the message
[1:13:17] to mary the angel was positioning mary
[1:13:21] in the redemption plan the redemptive
[1:13:23] plan of god and i'd like to say this the
[1:13:25] messenger that came in this day did not
[1:13:27] come to bring us information about
[1:13:29] somebody else and something else and
[1:13:30] somewhere else he came to position you
[1:13:33] the virgin bride of jesus christ in the
[1:13:35] plan of redemption
[1:13:38] and so now this angel comes to her amen
[1:13:41] not to tell her hey across town guess
[1:13:44] what a virgin's gonna conceive it's time
[1:13:46] for the promise fulfillment the message
[1:13:48] came to her to tell her
[1:13:50] you're the location
[1:13:54] you're the location of the fulfillment
[1:13:56] of the prophecy for this hour it'll be
[1:13:58] in you you're the chosen one you're
[1:14:00] highly favored god has chosen you and
[1:14:03] now from you is going to come the word
[1:14:08] so she is part of the word within her is
[1:14:11] the word because she was in the thought
[1:14:13] of god before the foundation of the
[1:14:14] world
[1:14:16] but now she has to come in contact with
[1:14:18] the message and the messages to unlock
[1:14:20] her
[1:14:22] and she has questions of course
[1:14:26] natural questions how will this be i
[1:14:28] know not a man and and and the angel
[1:14:30] said the holy ghost will overshadow you
[1:14:32] the thing that's formed in you amen she
[1:14:34] says be it unto me according to your
[1:14:35] word
[1:14:37] not
[1:14:38] uh not could i have a textbook on this
[1:14:40] could i have time to think about it what
[1:14:42] actions do i need to take what should i
[1:14:44] do should i
[1:14:45] just
[1:14:46] amen be it unto me according to your
[1:14:48] word i will be that vessel i believe the
[1:14:51] message i believe what you're telling me
[1:14:53] listen you you have to understand if we
[1:14:55] could just put ourselves back into a 15
[1:14:58] or 16 year old girl's body in nazareth
[1:15:00] who's nobody from nowhere amen and she's
[1:15:04] engaged to a man to be married who's a
[1:15:06] bit of an older man amen and she's got
[1:15:08] all this going on in her life and she's
[1:15:09] just going to the well to fetch water
[1:15:11] like she always does and here comes a
[1:15:13] messenger from god to tell her that this
[1:15:16] is the time and the hour and the season
[1:15:17] for the manifestation of the word the
[1:15:19] coming of the lord is now and it's going
[1:15:21] to start in you
[1:15:26] and she goes
[1:15:28] how
[1:15:30] and he gives an explanation that doesn't
[1:15:32] explain
[1:15:36] and she says be it unto me
[1:15:38] according to your word
[1:15:41] this is such a simple statement be it
[1:15:43] unto me according to your word
[1:15:45] but it's not simple friends
[1:15:48] by saying that she's acknowledging that
[1:15:50] i believe you
[1:15:52] that i was in the back part of god's
[1:15:54] mind when he was having isaiah give a
[1:15:57] prophecy he was thinking of me
[1:16:00] that being unto me was loaded with
[1:16:03] meaning friends she was receiving the
[1:16:05] revelation of her hour and she was
[1:16:07] receiving the revelation of herself in
[1:16:10] that hour she was receiving the
[1:16:12] revelation of her position in god in
[1:16:15] that hour and when she said being unto
[1:16:17] me she was saying i believe what you
[1:16:20] tell me that i believe that i'm the
[1:16:22] virgin that isaiah spoke of that god
[1:16:24] thought of before the foundation of the
[1:16:26] world when there was a lamb slain before
[1:16:27] the foundation of the world that you
[1:16:29] were going to bring it through a virgin
[1:16:30] because you knew there was going to be a
[1:16:31] fall
[1:16:33] you see this being unto me is loaded
[1:16:36] with meaning
[1:16:38] she had to accept it she had to receive
[1:16:41] it and then she let she let that word
[1:16:44] flow through her
[1:16:46] she could not produce it
[1:16:49] she could not manufacture it she could
[1:16:51] not copy it
[1:16:53] what could she do there was nothing she
[1:16:55] could do
[1:16:57] well what have we heard in this hour
[1:16:59] there's been a messenger
[1:17:02] there's been a seventh angel messenger
[1:17:05] that come and give us a revelation of
[1:17:08] the word to be performed in this hour
[1:17:10] but that messenger was unlocking the
[1:17:12] mystery in us and placing us in that
[1:17:15] mystery placing us as the vessels the
[1:17:17] word would come through amen and
[1:17:20] you can we can look at this and you can
[1:17:22] see the wave sheath
[1:17:25] and say there's no way i can do that
[1:17:29] i can tell you god's not asking you to
[1:17:31] do that
[1:17:32] god's not asking you to do anything amen
[1:17:35] that's what sometimes becomes so
[1:17:36] discouraging people they they look at
[1:17:38] brother branham's life and they look at
[1:17:39] the maturity he came to and the
[1:17:41] character he had and the manifestation
[1:17:43] say i could never do that i i would
[1:17:45] venture to say he never did that
[1:17:49] that's what he told us he said i'm not
[1:17:51] the one who does this i'm not the one
[1:17:53] who did this i was only standing by when
[1:17:56] he did those things he wasn't looking
[1:17:59] for somebody who could perform to the
[1:18:01] task mary never could perform to the
[1:18:03] task he's looking for somebody who will
[1:18:06] say i believe that's the truth and i
[1:18:08] yield myself to that truth and be it
[1:18:11] unto me according to your words
[1:18:14] now can we listen to the prophet and
[1:18:17] calling out a bride and listen we can
[1:18:20] look at the prophet calling out a bride
[1:18:22] as a story
[1:18:24] we can look at it as a mark in time that
[1:18:27] he's calling on a bride but we need to
[1:18:29] take the message personally he's calling
[1:18:31] me bride
[1:18:33] that messenger come to me and he's
[1:18:35] saying you're the bride you're the place
[1:18:37] of the fulfillment of the word it's time
[1:18:38] for the bride coming of christ and he
[1:18:40] wants to come inside of you and you can
[1:18:42] say but i can never but i this and i've
[1:18:45] got this happen and i'm this and mary
[1:18:47] could do the same thing
[1:18:49] americans say but i'm from a poor family
[1:18:50] i'm from out of the way i'm already
[1:18:52] engaged to a man i i've got this
[1:18:54] circumstance i've got that circumstance
[1:18:56] nobody will believe me listen at that
[1:18:58] point none of that matters because
[1:19:00] there's a prophecy amen there's
[1:19:01] something in the mind of god that'll
[1:19:03] trump every circumstance and bring the
[1:19:05] past the word of god
[1:19:08] so now none of her circumstances
[1:19:10] mattered anymore all that mattered was
[1:19:12] what the angel told her was the truth
[1:19:14] and when she received it and yielded
[1:19:15] herself to it then the holy ghost came
[1:19:17] and brought to pass everything that was
[1:19:19] in the mind of god before the foundation
[1:19:21] of the world
[1:19:23] so when we look at the life of brother
[1:19:24] brahma say i could never i can never i'm
[1:19:27] telling you that you can be whatever god
[1:19:29] has already designed for you to be what
[1:19:32] he's looking for is not effort he's
[1:19:33] looking for a surrender he's looking for
[1:19:35] somebody who will let the word flow
[1:19:36] through them
[1:19:38] and say god i give myself to this word i
[1:19:40] give my mind i give my life i give my
[1:19:42] body i give everything
[1:19:44] just let it flow through me
[1:19:49] praise me to god
[1:19:53] i'm wanting to get to something
[1:19:56] we may have to finish it up on wednesday
[1:19:58] but i got something in my heart we'll
[1:19:59] touch on it today lord willing
[1:20:02] let's turn
[1:20:04] let's turn to luke 24 together
[1:20:24] luke 24
[1:20:28] and verse 25.
[1:20:32] is after the resurrection this is the
[1:20:33] road to emmaus
[1:20:35] when i read in christ is the mystery of
[1:20:37] god revealed
[1:20:38] what i stopped reading there which is
[1:20:40] the first just the first couple pages
[1:20:42] right at the beginning of brother
[1:20:43] venom's ministry at after his greetings
[1:20:45] and after all of that he goes into uh
[1:20:47] prayer he reads the scriptures then we
[1:20:49] read what we read and immediately after
[1:20:51] we read what he read he goes into the
[1:20:53] road to email story
[1:20:55] jesus stepping out from the bushes and
[1:20:57] talking to the disciples asking them why
[1:21:00] they're so grieved as they walk along
[1:21:02] the way so brother branham and christ
[1:21:04] the mystery of god he's telling us that
[1:21:06] there's one mystery the whole the whole
[1:21:07] bible's been expressing one mystery and
[1:21:09] every type has been expressing it and
[1:21:10] here today i'm hoping you'll see it and
[1:21:12] then he goes right into the road to
[1:21:14] email story
[1:21:15] so i just want to grab a couple verses
[1:21:17] out of this let's look at verse 24.
[1:21:20] and certain of them which were with us
[1:21:23] went to the sepulcher they're explaining
[1:21:25] to jesus what had been happening
[1:21:27] went to the sepulchre and found even as
[1:21:29] the women had said but him they saw none
[1:21:32] then he said unto them o fools and slow
[1:21:34] of heart to believe all that the
[1:21:35] prophets have spoken ought not christ to
[1:21:38] have suffered these things and to enter
[1:21:40] into his glory and beginning at moses
[1:21:42] and all the prophets he expounded unto
[1:21:44] them all the scriptures the things
[1:21:47] concerning himself
[1:21:49] so here in the resurrection they're
[1:21:51] confused about what's happening they're
[1:21:53] discouraged because christ has died
[1:21:55] they're walking down to emmaus and he
[1:21:57] steps out of the bushes and he begins to
[1:21:59] to ask them questions and they begin to
[1:22:01] express their trouble and he calls them
[1:22:03] fools and slow of heart to understand
[1:22:05] and he and he says he starts to go
[1:22:08] through the scriptures and he goes down
[1:22:10] brother bam said they had a six hour
[1:22:11] bible study on fulfilled prophecy
[1:22:14] for the journey begins to go down
[1:22:16] through the scriptures and he begins to
[1:22:17] pull out of the scriptures amen the
[1:22:19] scriptures concerning himself amen what
[1:22:22] was he doing he was showing the mystery
[1:22:24] in plain sight
[1:22:27] he goes to moses and no doubt to know on
[1:22:30] to david and he and he goes to the
[1:22:32] psalms and brother bam starts talking
[1:22:34] about some of the scriptures he no doubt
[1:22:36] went to and began to explain and he
[1:22:38] begins to pull out of the scriptures and
[1:22:40] starts to show to them that there's been
[1:22:42] a mystery in this death there's been a
[1:22:44] mystery amen in this coming amen and the
[1:22:47] mystery has been laying in plain sight
[1:22:49] amen but now amen i'm going to unveil to
[1:22:52] you the mystery so you can look back in
[1:22:54] your bible and you can see it was there
[1:22:56] it was there it was there it was there
[1:22:58] and we know that this happens because
[1:23:00] peter and paul and john and james
[1:23:03] they're from then on amen after
[1:23:05] pentecost they're able to go back and
[1:23:06] say this is what the prophecy said and
[1:23:08] this is what the prophet said over here
[1:23:11] because when he unveiled the mystery and
[1:23:14] then he shows that this has all been in
[1:23:16] the bible and then all you had to do
[1:23:18] back is look at what's in plain sight
[1:23:20] it's been laying there for everyone to
[1:23:22] read but until he unlocks the by
[1:23:24] revelation the mystery to you you can't
[1:23:26] see what you're reading
[1:23:30] and here's what brother bram says in
[1:23:32] christ's mystery god revealed he says
[1:23:34] now if you want to mark this down i've
[1:23:35] got so many places i want to read from
[1:23:37] and in the book of saint luke the 24th
[1:23:39] chapter of saint luke we find it's it's
[1:23:42] the two apostles on the road to emmaus
[1:23:44] and jesus stepping out after his
[1:23:45] resurrection and they were on their road
[1:23:48] over to emmaus going along the road
[1:23:50] thinking and talking and weeping on
[1:23:51] account of his death and how they seen
[1:23:53] him suffer to what they thought was of
[1:23:55] no value at all they took their lord and
[1:23:57] crucified him and they were going along
[1:23:59] their weeping
[1:24:01] and he stepped out from the roadside and
[1:24:02] began to talk to them about christ he
[1:24:05] said o fools and slow to understand
[1:24:08] don't you know that all the prophets in
[1:24:10] the psalm see what was he doing
[1:24:12] identifying himself to those apostles
[1:24:15] that all of the prophets and all of the
[1:24:17] psalms and everything was him expressed
[1:24:22] so now
[1:24:23] they get a six-hour bible study on
[1:24:26] fulfilled prophecy
[1:24:30] back to christ as the mystery god
[1:24:31] revealed the prophet says now notice now
[1:24:34] down through the ages he has been
[1:24:36] gradually letting this out slowly
[1:24:38] unfolding the mystery through the
[1:24:40] prophets and through the times
[1:24:42] now we can just go on to that and
[1:24:45] expressing himself
[1:24:48] amen
[1:24:51] now in the message the identified
[1:24:53] masterpiece of god
[1:24:55] says now we notice that god began to
[1:24:57] make a bride for christ
[1:25:00] and the bride must be identified with
[1:25:02] him and in him because it is part of him
[1:25:05] and the brightest part of him she is
[1:25:07] part of him the word for that day the
[1:25:09] bride becomes part of that word for it's
[1:25:12] christ now you believe that
[1:25:14] we have to be in christ in christ we
[1:25:17] have to be of christ in christ part of
[1:25:20] christ
[1:25:21] so i want to go back and just just share
[1:25:24] something that i've been looking at amen
[1:25:26] and this morning things were coming so
[1:25:28] fast i just got a piece of paper started
[1:25:30] jotting it down so i'm just going to
[1:25:31] have to write some things out
[1:25:36] so
[1:25:37] let me see here
[1:25:41] all right
[1:25:43] i'm going to go back to this drawing
[1:25:44] that i've been drawing in this timeline
[1:25:47] so
[1:25:48] i'm not a good artist so when i get
[1:25:49] stuck on something i just kind of stick
[1:25:51] with it so
[1:25:52] you have to forgive me but we on this
[1:25:54] timeline we were drawing this this
[1:25:57] timeline of redemption and we talked
[1:25:59] about what was in the mind of god
[1:26:04] and how it come down into time
[1:26:07] and been expressed all the way through
[1:26:09] it was in fullness here and then it
[1:26:11] began to express it in bright form over
[1:26:13] here
[1:26:15] all the way till we get to the fullness
[1:26:17] again
[1:26:18] all right
[1:26:19] but it's fullness and bright form so
[1:26:21] here we have it
[1:26:26] bridegroom
[1:26:28] form and here we have it
[1:26:30] in bride form
[1:26:32] because he first formed adam and then he
[1:26:34] took out of adam what he needed to make
[1:26:36] the woman
[1:26:38] and so i want to go back and i'm just
[1:26:40] reminding you of that image there
[1:26:42] i want to go back and just draw
[1:26:45] if i can
[1:26:50] i just want to look at the old testament
[1:26:51] for a minute
[1:26:54] so i'm just going to come down here
[1:26:56] and draw the old testament part of this
[1:26:59] now when jesus was on the road to emmaus
[1:27:02] was those two disciples he was there in
[1:27:04] his resurrection and and in the
[1:27:07] resurrection ministry we know that he
[1:27:10] begins to reveal the mystery of what had
[1:27:12] just happened to them
[1:27:14] so you see part of jesus's resurrection
[1:27:16] ministry is to go back to the scriptures
[1:27:18] and reveal their day modern events made
[1:27:20] clear by prophecy
[1:27:22] so that's part of the resurrection
[1:27:24] ministry
[1:27:25] and so now
[1:27:27] today
[1:27:28] well brother ben on the road to him or
[1:27:30] he talks about the road to emmaus how he
[1:27:32] begins to go into the life of david and
[1:27:34] how he's a rejected king and to the
[1:27:36] psalms where he was crying out my god my
[1:27:38] god why is that forsaken me and to the
[1:27:39] songs where they said they parted my
[1:27:41] garments and he starts to show it's all
[1:27:43] been fulfilled amen it was laying in a
[1:27:45] mystery you missed it but with the key
[1:27:47] of faith and with revelation we can look
[1:27:49] back and see it there there there and
[1:27:50] there
[1:27:51] but now we've come to the end time where
[1:27:54] god has unlocked another layer of the
[1:27:57] mystery because in that day he unlocked
[1:27:59] the mystery of jesus christ amen gone
[1:28:02] amen in the form of flesh as his son
[1:28:05] coming to pay the price of redemption
[1:28:07] and he shows that all the old testament
[1:28:08] was speaking of that all the way to
[1:28:10] there amen then when brother branham
[1:28:12] comes and starts showing us that the
[1:28:14] bride was always in him
[1:28:18] the bride was a part of that mystery
[1:28:21] amen when adam came forth he was a
[1:28:23] revelation of the thought of god
[1:28:25] that when adam was made and formed on
[1:28:28] the earth he was a revelation of the
[1:28:29] thought of god but there was a further
[1:28:31] revelation of the father of god that was
[1:28:33] with him
[1:28:35] and then it was expressed out amen and
[1:28:37] it was expressed out into a form and
[1:28:38] united back together with him it was a
[1:28:40] further expression of the mind of god
[1:28:43] and it was a further expression of what
[1:28:45] was with adam all along
[1:28:48] and so
[1:28:49] i want to go back
[1:28:53] and let's look back at the old testament
[1:28:54] i just want to grab a few stories here
[1:28:57] and i want to show
[1:28:58] that this bride this manifestation of
[1:29:02] the female has been all through the
[1:29:04] bible
[1:29:06] so if christ has been there we know that
[1:29:08] christ is going to be expressed male and
[1:29:10] female
[1:29:11] so there's no time that we're not going
[1:29:13] to go into this in depth i'm just going
[1:29:14] to take a few points and i'm going to
[1:29:16] show here
[1:29:17] that we have here an expression of adam
[1:29:21] right
[1:29:22] but there wasn't just an expression of
[1:29:24] adam we know that there was also with
[1:29:28] adam an expression of wife
[1:29:33] and she was mrs adam
[1:29:36] so even from the very beginning
[1:29:38] when god is going to start showing a son
[1:29:40] of god amen and this son of god will
[1:29:43] fall showing that we need to have
[1:29:44] another son of god that won't fall but
[1:29:47] even in that expression there's a female
[1:29:49] expression that goes with it
[1:29:51] so when you see the male the female's
[1:29:53] there
[1:29:54] now we're going to start to see this
[1:29:55] pattern all through the bible because we
[1:29:57] come down here to the end time when we
[1:29:59] come to the revelation of the message
[1:30:01] brother banham starts to express some
[1:30:03] things that that that the the church has
[1:30:06] lost they've lost the fact that christ
[1:30:07] is going to have a bride
[1:30:10] the denominations had a lot it's it was
[1:30:12] all about christ it was all about jesus
[1:30:14] christ and he paid the price in the lamb
[1:30:16] of god but they missed scriptures in the
[1:30:18] new testament that was talking about the
[1:30:20] bride the lamb's wife the marriage of
[1:30:22] the lamb there was all of these things
[1:30:24] that were there but but i ask you which
[1:30:27] of the denominations are preaching about
[1:30:28] the bride
[1:30:30] now i'm not saying none there might be
[1:30:32] some who mention it there might be some
[1:30:33] who talk about it but all of my life
[1:30:36] growing up in churches nobody was
[1:30:37] talking about the bride amen because it
[1:30:40] takes somebody to come on the scene in
[1:30:42] the resurrection ministry and say oh
[1:30:45] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[1:30:47] that the bible had written
[1:30:50] and he goes brother bam says this
[1:30:52] seventh seal was expressed all the way
[1:30:54] back in the beginning in the book of
[1:30:55] genesis
[1:30:57] so when when brother branham comes and
[1:30:58] he starts preaching of a bride age in
[1:31:01] the invisible union of the bride in
[1:31:03] christ an expression of christ in bright
[1:31:05] form the bright coming of christ he's
[1:31:08] not just talking about something that's
[1:31:10] happening then
[1:31:11] you can look all the way down through
[1:31:13] the bible and see that you had this male
[1:31:15] and female all the way through
[1:31:18] i'm just going to take a couple of these
[1:31:21] so
[1:31:22] when you have adam
[1:31:25] then you have the woman she later gets
[1:31:27] the name of eve
[1:31:30] but god's plan has to march on
[1:31:33] she
[1:31:34] falls by deception and produces a cane
[1:31:38] and so
[1:31:41] she produces a cane
[1:31:44] and an abel
[1:31:46] cain kills abel
[1:31:49] and god cuts off cain
[1:31:52] but the plan of god has to continue
[1:31:55] so how's the plan of god going to
[1:31:56] continue from adam and eve now will come
[1:31:59] the next expression god will use seth
[1:32:03] how was god going to get the seth
[1:32:05] without the woman
[1:32:08] the woman
[1:32:09] brought the
[1:32:10] fall produced the cane
[1:32:13] cain killed abel but the plan of god has
[1:32:16] got to continue on so god hey listen god
[1:32:19] is foreshadowing all the way back in the
[1:32:21] old testament that he's going to have to
[1:32:23] use this fallen woman and this fallen
[1:32:26] woman is still going to be instrumental
[1:32:28] in redemption
[1:32:30] so even though the woman fell and
[1:32:32] there's a fallen woman and this fallen
[1:32:34] woman is still with a vessel because
[1:32:37] there's a woman typed with the man
[1:32:39] they're still male and female in the
[1:32:40] expression of christ and although the
[1:32:42] woman has fallen god is still going to
[1:32:45] bring through the woman and keep that
[1:32:47] keep the redemption cycle moving forward
[1:32:51] so now there comes a set
[1:32:53] and seth comes from
[1:32:55] eve
[1:32:57] and adam from seth he has enos then
[1:33:00] began men to call upon
[1:33:02] the name of the lord so you can see that
[1:33:05] god is still moving his program along
[1:33:07] amen but when the woman dropped
[1:33:10] out of grace he didn't cut her off and
[1:33:12] say no i'm going to do it without a
[1:33:14] woman he can't do without a woman
[1:33:16] because all the way at the end time he's
[1:33:18] going to be doing it with a woman so
[1:33:19] he's got to have the woman intact
[1:33:21] through the whole bible
[1:33:23] so now if i could say this without you
[1:33:25] thinking i'm sacrilegious but now as we
[1:33:27] walk down through the road of emmaus
[1:33:29] it's no longer just showing us the
[1:33:31] bridegroom the bridegroom the bridegroom
[1:33:33] but now you can go back and say you see
[1:33:35] the bride here with the bridegroom you
[1:33:37] see the bride here with the bridegroom
[1:33:39] do you see esther amen what is esther
[1:33:41] pointing to
[1:33:45] so now amen under the the resurrection
[1:33:48] ministry of christ in our day amen
[1:33:50] through a prophetic message he has
[1:33:52] brought us back to the understanding
[1:33:54] that god had this plan from all the way
[1:33:56] in the beginning and every type was
[1:33:58] showing the mystery of christ
[1:34:01] but the mystery of christ was not male
[1:34:04] only
[1:34:06] the mystery of christ was going to be
[1:34:07] expressed in male and female just like
[1:34:09] the first son
[1:34:13] so then we come down here
[1:34:16] and now we have another expression
[1:34:19] in moses
[1:34:23] uh no before moses i'm gonna do
[1:34:25] something else
[1:34:27] oh i messed my line up
[1:34:30] i'm such a nervous artist
[1:34:35] now we come to abraham we've been
[1:34:36] talking about abraham a lot so i'm not
[1:34:38] going to spend a lot of time i'm just
[1:34:39] going to touch on it
[1:34:41] but with abraham there's another
[1:34:42] expression with abraham
[1:34:45] that's sarah his wife
[1:34:47] because god says
[1:34:50] god says
[1:34:51] you're going to have a son and he's
[1:34:54] going to come from your own bowels
[1:34:57] right he said it's not going to be
[1:34:59] eliezer but you have a son from your own
[1:35:01] bowels coming from your own body and so
[1:35:04] sarah and abraham come up with a plan to
[1:35:06] take hagar after god says that and he
[1:35:09] produces a son that son technically
[1:35:11] comes from his own
[1:35:12] bowels but yet that's not the
[1:35:15] fulfillment of the prophecy he says no
[1:35:17] in sarah shall thy thy isaac shall come
[1:35:20] from sarah because sarah is part of
[1:35:23] abraham
[1:35:25] so when it says shall come from your own
[1:35:27] bowels abraham and another woman won't
[1:35:30] work amen because it's got to be abraham
[1:35:32] male and female and when you get the
[1:35:34] abraham male and female together in
[1:35:35] god's timing then you can produce the
[1:35:37] promised son
[1:35:38] so it's not just a from abraham's body
[1:35:41] it must come from abraham and sarah's
[1:35:44] body because sarah is part of abraham
[1:35:48] are you enjoying the road to emmaus
[1:35:52] now we can look back and see
[1:35:54] now and sarah
[1:35:56] isaac will come from sarah amen and and
[1:35:59] i don't have time to go into all the
[1:36:01] scriptures but you can look them up
[1:36:03] sarah now she comes uh
[1:36:05] to the seventh seal
[1:36:08] god comes to her privately and he comes
[1:36:10] to her in the appointed time and she
[1:36:12] receives strength and she conceives and
[1:36:14] now she brings forth the promised son
[1:36:16] she's turned young but after she's
[1:36:18] turned young then she has a visitation
[1:36:20] amen from the lord the lord visits sarah
[1:36:23] and she received strength to conceive so
[1:36:25] even when she was turned back young she
[1:36:27] still wasn't conceiving the lord had to
[1:36:29] visit her amen and a private little room
[1:36:32] behind closed doors no public show
[1:36:34] meeting with god and sarah
[1:36:37] and when he did now she was able to
[1:36:38] bring forth the promised sign and she
[1:36:40] conceives but after that she has a clear
[1:36:43] vision
[1:36:45] and after that when it's time for them
[1:36:47] to wean isaac and during the party where
[1:36:49] isaac being winged she sees the son of
[1:36:51] the bondwoman mocking and she comes to
[1:36:54] abraham and she says that cast out the
[1:36:56] bondwoman and her son for the bondwoman
[1:36:58] shall not be heir with my seed
[1:37:03] you said well that was pretty bold
[1:37:05] i mean
[1:37:06] the bible says that we're supposed the
[1:37:08] women are supposed to be like sarah who
[1:37:10] call abraham lord
[1:37:12] but boy she's really telling him what to
[1:37:14] do
[1:37:16] it's because now she has clear
[1:37:18] understanding when she produced hagar
[1:37:21] she didn't have clear understanding and
[1:37:23] then she partially understood the
[1:37:24] promise she partially understood the
[1:37:26] word and she with her own effort tried
[1:37:28] to make the word come to pass but now
[1:37:30] after her visitation from the lord she
[1:37:32] has a clear understanding and she says
[1:37:35] cast out the bondwoman and her son for
[1:37:37] the child of the bondwoman shall not be
[1:37:39] heir with my child
[1:37:42] he said wow that's pretty stiff abraham
[1:37:45] begins to grieve and god tells abraham
[1:37:47] don't grieve over what sarah said but
[1:37:48] listen to her
[1:37:50] she's right
[1:37:52] and then the apostle paul picks this up
[1:37:54] in the new testament and the apostle
[1:37:55] paul says does not the scripture say
[1:37:59] cast out the bondwoman
[1:38:03] does not the scripture say cast out the
[1:38:05] bondwoman
[1:38:07] and her child
[1:38:09] hey i thought all the scripture came of
[1:38:12] holy men of old anointed by the holy
[1:38:14] ghost
[1:38:15] but here's a scripture that came from a
[1:38:17] woman who had a revelation of the
[1:38:20] promisee
[1:38:22] according god told abraham she's right
[1:38:26] and paul picks it up and says does not
[1:38:28] the scripture say
[1:38:31] god was speaking his word through sarah
[1:38:34] after she had come in contact with god
[1:38:35] and god had visited her and she had an
[1:38:37] understanding of what this was and what
[1:38:39] is this foreshadowing which showing amen
[1:38:42] that at the end time amen the word will
[1:38:45] be in the bride
[1:38:47] because you'll eat the book and prophesy
[1:38:49] again and brother baby said she'll be
[1:38:50] the mouthpiece
[1:38:52] of god on earth for the word will be in
[1:38:54] her
[1:38:56] all the way back in the old testament
[1:38:59] male female male
[1:39:01] female
[1:39:11] moses
[1:39:14] when it came time to bring moses
[1:39:18] god for one he needed a woman
[1:39:21] he brought through i believe his jock of
[1:39:23] bed was his mother's name brought moses
[1:39:25] on the scene
[1:39:27] but at the time moses came on the scene
[1:39:29] there was a destruction of children
[1:39:31] and so daca bed hid moses for a little
[1:39:36] while and when she could hide it no
[1:39:37] longer she fashioned
[1:39:41] an ark out of bulrushes and she put him
[1:39:44] in the bulrushes
[1:39:46] so now
[1:39:47] in order for god to move forward his
[1:39:49] redemption plan he must save the life of
[1:39:52] moses but to save the life of moses he's
[1:39:56] going to need a woman
[1:39:59] this woman is going to make the ark
[1:40:01] that's going to hold the word and she's
[1:40:03] going to send it into the bulrushes amen
[1:40:06] but then moses sister miriam is going to
[1:40:09] follow along and watch what happens to
[1:40:11] the ark another woman amen and then god
[1:40:14] is going to allow pharaoh's daughter to
[1:40:16] find the ark
[1:40:18] another woman
[1:40:20] listen there's no men involved this is
[1:40:22] all women amen it's his mother it's his
[1:40:25] sister amen's pharaoh's daughter and
[1:40:27] pharaoh's daughter takes him and adopts
[1:40:29] him as her own and brings him into
[1:40:31] pharaoh's house and what is god doing
[1:40:33] god is moving the plan of redemption
[1:40:35] along and i i would like to say it this
[1:40:37] way when you go back and you begin to
[1:40:39] look at the expressions of christ it was
[1:40:41] brother said it was christ and moses
[1:40:44] it was christ and david it was christ
[1:40:46] here it was christ there when you go
[1:40:49] back and you find christ many times
[1:40:51] you'll find a woman instrumental in
[1:40:53] moving forward the redemption plan that
[1:40:55] if you take the women out of the story
[1:40:58] the plan of god cuts off
[1:41:01] why because he was showing that there's
[1:41:03] got to be a bride all the way back there
[1:41:06] she's part of redemption she's moving
[1:41:08] redemption along god is still working
[1:41:10] through male and female the old
[1:41:12] testament is the expression of christ he
[1:41:14] came as the fulfillment of that amen as
[1:41:16] the bridegroom the new testament is
[1:41:18] building him a bride but the whole bible
[1:41:20] is an expression of christ and wherever
[1:41:22] you find christ his bride is there too
[1:41:26] and that's why brother ben said now my
[1:41:28] bible became a new book our bible is
[1:41:30] constantly becoming a new book because
[1:41:31] when we look at it again we see that's
[1:41:33] christ that's the bride that's what this
[1:41:36] is redemption
[1:41:39] now little miriam follows the basket
[1:41:41] alone sees pharaoh
[1:41:43] daughter and pharaoh's daughter has a
[1:41:45] servant pick it up she says this is one
[1:41:47] of the hebrews miriam runs up and says
[1:41:49] hey do you want me to fetch a nursemaid
[1:41:51] to nurse him
[1:41:53] she said sure gets her mother
[1:41:56] the mother of the baby
[1:41:59] says i'll pay you i'll pay you to nurse
[1:42:02] your baby
[1:42:06] it's the redemption plan of god
[1:42:09] and you cannot see the redemption plan
[1:42:10] of god moving forward without a woman
[1:42:12] involved
[1:42:14] because the bride is part of christ
[1:42:18] she's part of the word she's part of the
[1:42:20] plan of redemption
[1:42:23] he's taken the mystery off the entire
[1:42:25] bible
[1:42:29] now we come into the exodus
[1:42:33] come to joshua
[1:42:36] see
[1:42:37] you look down through all of these
[1:42:39] stories and as you look through them
[1:42:42] at first at first bible reading you see
[1:42:45] christ typed in male male
[1:42:48] male
[1:42:49] male
[1:42:50] moses joshua david solomon
[1:42:55] we got that
[1:42:56] but when you go back and you read it
[1:42:58] again
[1:42:59] you find that when it was time for
[1:43:01] joshua to enter into the land there was
[1:43:03] a stronghold there called jericho
[1:43:06] and when josh was moving into his
[1:43:08] ministry in the exodus and joshua's the
[1:43:10] type of the holy ghost and he's bringing
[1:43:12] the people across to conquer the land
[1:43:13] the first thing they're going to conquer
[1:43:15] is that great denomination of jericho
[1:43:17] amen and it's got high walls around it
[1:43:19] but there's a little prostitute woman
[1:43:21] down in jericho by the name of rahab and
[1:43:24] rahab is going to become instrumental
[1:43:26] into redemption in that city
[1:43:29] so we think the story is just about
[1:43:30] joshua but when we're looking at joshua
[1:43:32] rahab pops up what's rehab doing there
[1:43:36] and then raham takes the two spies that
[1:43:39] come in to look at the land amen and
[1:43:41] then the spies were uh they were after
[1:43:43] the spies they were subject uh they were
[1:43:46] in danger of being captured and men in
[1:43:47] their mission to be exposed and so she
[1:43:49] takes them and hides them and she
[1:43:51] declares i don't have time to go into
[1:43:53] scriptures today but we might sometime
[1:43:54] soon she declares i know that god has
[1:43:57] given you this land
[1:43:59] what is this this is a harlot in the
[1:44:01] middle of the denominational system in
[1:44:03] jericho and she says i know i believe
[1:44:06] the message with all of my heart
[1:44:10] stuck in a lifestyle that is contrary to
[1:44:13] what we would call righteousness i mean
[1:44:15] she's in a bad spot in a bad place but
[1:44:17] there's something on the inside of her
[1:44:19] that when she heard of what god had done
[1:44:21] in the red sea and she heard of how he
[1:44:22] destroyed the armies she said that's the
[1:44:25] truth god has given them this land
[1:44:29] she hid the messengers protected the
[1:44:33] protected them amen but then she asked
[1:44:36] them she said listen before you go give
[1:44:39] me a true token
[1:44:42] give me a true token and they tell her
[1:44:44] you know if you keep the secret and and
[1:44:46] all that and just set the scarlett
[1:44:47] threat outside of your window and get
[1:44:49] all your family under this token and
[1:44:51] when you get all your family we'll not
[1:44:52] destroy anything that's in this house
[1:44:54] but we're not responsible for anything
[1:44:55] outside the token
[1:44:58] and here you have a harlot woman in
[1:45:01] jericho believes the message receives
[1:45:03] the preachers protects them
[1:45:08] and she opens a door of redemption
[1:45:11] the only door of redemption in jericho
[1:45:16] in the accursed city in the place that's
[1:45:18] about to be destroyed in the very thing
[1:45:20] that joshua's coming to level amen
[1:45:22] there's a harlot on the inside who
[1:45:23] believes the message and acts
[1:45:25] accordingly who is opening the only door
[1:45:28] of redemption in that cursed city
[1:45:33] praise god amen we've been fools and
[1:45:36] slow of heart to believe all that god
[1:45:38] had written through the prophets and all
[1:45:39] that he read through the laws because
[1:45:40] he's always placed the woman
[1:45:42] instrumental in redemption all the way
[1:45:44] through
[1:45:47] so now
[1:45:48] they take jericho
[1:45:51] rahab comes out her and her family are
[1:45:53] saved
[1:45:55] and then she marries
[1:45:56] salmon of judah
[1:45:59] and she becomes the mother of boaz
[1:46:04] listen friends
[1:46:06] tell me the bride's not in the old
[1:46:08] testament the bride's in the old
[1:46:09] testament amen where christ is she is
[1:46:12] amen there's male and female all the way
[1:46:14] through
[1:46:17] then a little while later we come into
[1:46:18] the time of the judges and in the time
[1:46:20] of the judges we know that there's a
[1:46:23] famine there's a family that leaves and
[1:46:25] goes to moab the sons married daughters
[1:46:27] amen and they come back and naomi comes
[1:46:30] back with uh with who does she come back
[1:46:33] with
[1:46:34] ruth thank you guys too many names
[1:46:37] she comes back with ruth ruth of
[1:46:39] moabites amen she's a gentile i mean
[1:46:42] just look back at the bible amen when
[1:46:44] joseph was a perfect type of jesus
[1:46:45] christ what kind of wife did he have
[1:46:47] gentile wife
[1:46:49] moses had a gentile wife
[1:46:52] right you're starting to see this
[1:46:56] pattern all through the bible god has
[1:46:58] been declaring his great mystery in
[1:47:00] every time every type in the bible has
[1:47:02] been declaring it he's been slowly
[1:47:04] letting it out but at the end time he
[1:47:06] takes the veil off so you can go back
[1:47:08] and say that's why joseph had to have a
[1:47:11] gentile wife
[1:47:14] that's why moses had to marry a gentile
[1:47:18] this makes perfect sense
[1:47:21] because he's taken the veil off of
[1:47:23] redemption
[1:47:24] and it's christ
[1:47:26] male and female
[1:47:29] so now we come
[1:47:34] now we come into boaz
[1:47:37] and boaz is going to be a picture of the
[1:47:39] kinsman redeemer
[1:47:41] and he's going to paint the picture for
[1:47:43] us of how christ will redeem it all the
[1:47:45] way through to revelation chapter 5.
[1:47:48] so he's another type of christ
[1:47:50] but he's an
[1:47:52] e from all accounts he's an older man
[1:47:54] from the way the scripture is written
[1:47:56] and
[1:47:57] there's a there's a
[1:47:59] a woman by the name of naomi and their
[1:48:01] relatives naomi she loses everything
[1:48:03] goes into the moab and they lose
[1:48:06] everything there she comes back and lost
[1:48:07] her husband lost her sons lost her
[1:48:09] inheritance she needs redemption real
[1:48:12] bad amen but how is this woman going to
[1:48:14] get redemption boaz is able to redeem
[1:48:16] her amen but god is going to use a
[1:48:18] mechanism so it is not only the male but
[1:48:21] it's going to be the female because now
[1:48:23] ruth is going to be instrumental to
[1:48:24] rayomi's redemption
[1:48:27] now this woman from moab moab the
[1:48:29] moabitess woman the gentile bride is
[1:48:32] coming on the scene and through humility
[1:48:35] and service and she's going to serve
[1:48:37] naomi she's going to glean in the fields
[1:48:38] she's going to get the attention of boaz
[1:48:40] and boaz is now going to redeem naomi
[1:48:44] and take ruth and when he takes ruth
[1:48:46] she's going to bring forth a promised
[1:48:47] son that is obed obed's the father of
[1:48:50] jesse jesse's the father of david how
[1:48:52] did they come about because rahab the
[1:48:55] harlot opened the door of redemption and
[1:48:57] jericho married salman because she was a
[1:49:00] believer in the midst of the
[1:49:01] denominational system married the prince
[1:49:03] had boaz boaz takes ruth the moabitess
[1:49:06] woman for the purpose of redemption
[1:49:09] brings forth obed obed reforms jesse
[1:49:12] jesse before brings forth david
[1:49:16] the bible's too perfect too beautiful
[1:49:18] friends for us to miss it anymore i say
[1:49:20] god take the scales off of our eyes and
[1:49:22] see what's been hiding in plain sight in
[1:49:25] plain sight there's been a woman all the
[1:49:27] way through in redemption
[1:49:29] it wasn't the male only but you used a
[1:49:32] woman you used a woman here and you lose
[1:49:33] a woman there and you use the woman
[1:49:35] there and then this day amen it's the
[1:49:37] bride coming of christ you're finishing
[1:49:40] the plan of redemption and you're using
[1:49:41] a female expression of christ
[1:49:44] how can i have such confidence in that i
[1:49:46] can see it strung clear through the
[1:49:47] bible amen
[1:49:49] i have confidence that that's what god
[1:49:51] is wanting to do
[1:49:56] we're on the road
[1:49:58] to emmaus
[1:50:01] we find one here
[1:50:03] running out of room
[1:50:05] but you find esther
[1:50:08] and esther
[1:50:10] opens a
[1:50:12] door of salvation for an entire people
[1:50:15] a nation of israel
[1:50:17] and without her
[1:50:19] amen she's in place
[1:50:21] for salvation she's instrumental to the
[1:50:23] salvation of the jews
[1:50:25] i'm going to go down here
[1:50:27] and add another one
[1:50:29] i'm going to add debra
[1:50:35] deborah was a judge
[1:50:39] and a prophetess
[1:50:45] she was the fourth judge
[1:50:50] in the fourth chapter
[1:50:54] i think god wants us to see the number
[1:50:55] four
[1:50:58] because the fourth stage of the seed is
[1:50:59] back to life again and the fourth beast
[1:51:01] is the eagle
[1:51:03] and the eagle is the prophetic anointing
[1:51:06] and she's from the tribe of ephraim the
[1:51:07] ephraim is a type of the gentiles
[1:51:09] because when god crossed
[1:51:11] when he crossed
[1:51:13] jacob's hands israel's hands amen the
[1:51:16] blessing went crossed from
[1:51:18] manasseh to ephraim showing that the
[1:51:20] blessing's gonna cross from the jews to
[1:51:21] the gentiles so here comes a woman
[1:51:25] who's a prophetess a woman who's a judge
[1:51:28] and she's the fourth judge in the fourth
[1:51:31] chapter
[1:51:32] from
[1:51:33] because the number four is the fourth
[1:51:34] beast which is also the eagle the
[1:51:35] prophetic the prophetic gift
[1:51:38] and she's from the tribe of ephraim
[1:51:40] which represents gentiles
[1:51:41] i wonder what she's doing there
[1:51:44] i wonder why god put her in the bible
[1:51:46] maybe maybe like brother brother shimbo
[1:51:49] was saying god was using david he was
[1:51:50] leaving a signal he says here's the
[1:51:52] signal remember when brother shimbo said
[1:51:54] that he was signaling the combination of
[1:51:56] judah and levite back into one again
[1:51:59] and here god in this debra is leaving a
[1:52:01] signal i've told you all before i used
[1:52:03] to when i used to uh talk i used to
[1:52:06] debate it wasn't right but i did debate
[1:52:09] i had the right word i used to debate
[1:52:10] with denominational people about women
[1:52:12] preachers
[1:52:13] and they would always go to deborah and
[1:52:15] i would say why did god
[1:52:17] if god hadn't put that in the bible
[1:52:19] my debate would have lasted a little
[1:52:21] longer
[1:52:24] but then god opened our eyes to see why
[1:52:27] it's laying there and all of a sudden
[1:52:28] you say i'm so thankful he put deborah
[1:52:31] in the bible so that i can see in the
[1:52:33] end time amen under a prophetic ministry
[1:52:36] god is going to have a woman on the
[1:52:37] earth amen at
[1:52:39] ephraim in the fourth stage of the beast
[1:52:42] amen and when it comes back to life amen
[1:52:45] and the word is going to be in her amen
[1:52:47] the word that the prophet brought is
[1:52:48] going to be in the bride
[1:52:50] she's going to be told to prophesy again
[1:52:54] so now all of these things
[1:52:56] are laying in the bible
[1:52:59] you know in the time of
[1:53:01] judges in the time of deborah
[1:53:04] i'm running out of time so i'm just
[1:53:06] going to give a couple more and then
[1:53:07] we'll we'll close for today
[1:53:09] but in the time of deborah amen there's
[1:53:11] a battle that's taking place the
[1:53:13] canaanites are ruling and dominating
[1:53:15] over the israelites and she tells barack
[1:53:17] to go and defeat them and barack wants
[1:53:19] her to come and then she tells him but
[1:53:21] there's going to be credit given to a
[1:53:22] woman for this victory amen and under
[1:53:25] the time of deborah the prophetess the
[1:53:27] judge the fourth
[1:53:29] amen there's a there's a captain of the
[1:53:31] host of the the the conquering army his
[1:53:35] name's cesara and cesara is giving them
[1:53:37] all kinds of trouble and barack is
[1:53:39] trying to sort them and save the the
[1:53:42] israelite nation and sasera begins to
[1:53:44] run away when he runs away he runs to a
[1:53:46] woman's tent
[1:53:49] and this woman invites him in
[1:53:51] and she comes into the woman's tent and
[1:53:54] he asks for water she gives him milk and
[1:53:56] and she tells him to lie down back here
[1:53:58] and she covers him over and
[1:54:00] he says protect me and she says i'll
[1:54:02] protect you and when he falls asleep she
[1:54:04] takes a tent stake
[1:54:07] this big this big may be this big
[1:54:11] she walks over to him and lays it on his
[1:54:13] temple
[1:54:15] and drives the tent stake through his
[1:54:16] head through his temple
[1:54:18] and pins it to the ground
[1:54:22] amen
[1:54:23] the enemy
[1:54:24] comes into the woman's tent
[1:54:27] and where does she attack the enemy
[1:54:29] where does she defeat the enemy
[1:54:31] in the mind
[1:54:32] because the battle started in the mine
[1:54:35] the serpent came to eve and troubled her
[1:54:37] in her mind and now we have a victory
[1:54:41] under the ministry of deborah
[1:54:44] and under the ministry of deborah the
[1:54:45] final victory that's going to give them
[1:54:47] victory over all the foes is when this
[1:54:49] woman takes this tent stake and drives
[1:54:51] it through the very thinking the very
[1:54:53] mind of this enemy and pins it to the
[1:54:56] ground as earthly carnal thinking and
[1:54:59] she won't be defeated by this enemy
[1:55:00] anymore
[1:55:02] why is that in the bible
[1:55:04] i don't know
[1:55:06] maybe to encourage you and i
[1:55:09] there's another story in in
[1:55:12] judges chapter nine in judges chapter
[1:55:14] dying it's it's a hemolac or abimalac
[1:55:17] a son of gideon gideon was a judge over
[1:55:20] israel he has a son with a concubine so
[1:55:22] it's not a legitimate son it's an
[1:55:24] illegitimate son and this is a little
[1:55:26] illegitimate son amen comes up with a
[1:55:29] scheme so he can become the next judge
[1:55:31] of israel
[1:55:32] and through this political maneuvering
[1:55:34] and scheme he becomes the false judge
[1:55:38] and this false judge begins to terrorize
[1:55:41] and begins to control and then there's a
[1:55:44] war that breaks out and there's a fight
[1:55:46] and he defeats one city and he goes to
[1:55:48] the next when he goes to the next all
[1:55:50] the people run up into a tower
[1:55:54] because we have a tower to run into
[1:55:56] which is christ
[1:55:58] all the people run into the tower when
[1:56:00] the when the false judge is coming along
[1:56:03] the the hybrid one
[1:56:06] he's coming in and he begins to attack
[1:56:09] and he begins to set fire to it
[1:56:11] but there's a woman at the top of that
[1:56:13] tower
[1:56:14] that takes a piece of millstone
[1:56:17] she takes a piece of stone
[1:56:19] and throws it out of the strong tower
[1:56:22] and the stone comes down and cracks him
[1:56:25] in the head and fractures his skull
[1:56:29] listen you could write that story any
[1:56:31] way you want
[1:56:33] but for me
[1:56:34] there's a strong tower that this bride
[1:56:36] can go into and when the enemy comes
[1:56:38] beating on the tower i've got a
[1:56:39] revelation i can roll off the top and
[1:56:41] that revelation will knock him right in
[1:56:43] the head and crack his skull break the
[1:56:45] very thing it's always the thinking the
[1:56:48] mind the reasoning the earthly carnal
[1:56:50] thinking that's always attacking this
[1:56:52] bride so back there in judges and then
[1:56:54] she drives a spike through the thinking
[1:56:56] she rolls a stone out a revelation and
[1:56:59] cracks him in the head i say praise god
[1:57:02] when we look down through the bible i
[1:57:03] can see amen i can see a woman i can see
[1:57:06] a woman of redemption i can see victory
[1:57:08] i can see
[1:57:09] myself
[1:57:14] in this resurrection ministry
[1:57:17] he opened the scriptures
[1:57:21] but he also opened our understanding to
[1:57:23] understand the scriptures
[1:57:26] when we look back down through the
[1:57:28] scriptures
[1:57:30] we can see the bride
[1:57:32] when we look down to the scriptures we
[1:57:34] can
[1:57:35] see the groom i mean
[1:57:37] when we see the groom we can see the
[1:57:38] bride too
[1:57:41] god has been working a plan
[1:57:44] and in that plan he's been expressing
[1:57:46] himself
[1:57:48] and every character in the bible
[1:57:50] and all the types and the shadows and
[1:57:52] the stories it's all been him expressing
[1:57:55] this great plan he had in his mind and
[1:57:57] it's been sealed away from the wise and
[1:57:59] prudent but revealed unto babes
[1:58:02] and we've come to the day where the
[1:58:04] bible's become a new book he's taken
[1:58:06] and taken the seals off of the book and
[1:58:08] we can look back down through and we can
[1:58:10] say
[1:58:10] i see christ there i see christ there i
[1:58:12] see christ there
[1:58:14] but i see he's using a woman too
[1:58:18] there's a woman there and a woman there
[1:58:20] and a woman there
[1:58:22] when you come into the new testament
[1:58:25] the first person that ever knows that
[1:58:27] this time for the coming of the lord is
[1:58:29] a woman mary
[1:58:32] the first person that knows the the the
[1:58:34] first two women to meet one that's
[1:58:36] carrying the forerunner and one that's
[1:58:38] carrying when he's four running they
[1:58:39] come together and when they come
[1:58:40] together the holy ghost takes over and
[1:58:42] they both begin to prophesy
[1:58:44] two women
[1:58:45] right there at the beginning of the new
[1:58:46] testament
[1:58:48] the the first person in samaria that
[1:58:50] recognizes he's the messiah is the woman
[1:58:52] at the well
[1:58:54] and then there was a woman who
[1:58:55] recognized that he needed to be anointed
[1:58:57] with oil for his burial
[1:58:59] it was a woman his disciples were all
[1:59:01] sitting there and they all said what
[1:59:02] waste and he says she has anointed me
[1:59:05] for my burial
[1:59:07] and wherever this gospel goes it will be
[1:59:09] spoken of her
[1:59:10] what did she do she caught the
[1:59:12] revelation of the hour and the
[1:59:13] manifestation in the need and all the
[1:59:16] disciples and the priests everything
[1:59:17] else missed it but a woman caught it
[1:59:21] amen the first person that he talked to
[1:59:24] the first person that he saw in his
[1:59:25] resurrection was mary magdalene who cast
[1:59:27] seven devils out
[1:59:29] he didn't cast six he didn't cast 80
[1:59:31] cast seven
[1:59:32] because in this resurrection there's a
[1:59:34] woman who's been delivered from the
[1:59:35] seven denominations
[1:59:38] the seven church ages
[1:59:40] and he comes to her in this resurrection
[1:59:42] and he reveals his resurrection to her
[1:59:45] i tell you this bible is perfect
[1:59:49] god has showed us this message all
[1:59:52] through it it's not a few scriptures in
[1:59:54] revelation it's not a few scriptures
[1:59:55] here or there when brother branham
[1:59:57] brought to us amen in the opening of the
[1:59:59] seals he took the seals off the entire
[2:00:02] the lord jesus took the seals off the
[2:00:03] entire bible the book has been opened
[2:00:05] and now we can go back with fresh eyes
[2:00:08] and look at all those stories that we
[2:00:10] knew as children and we see him
[2:00:11] differently we used to see him now we
[2:00:13] see the mystery being unveiled
[2:00:16] now we see the plan of redemption moving
[2:00:18] forward
[2:00:19] and i say god give us eyes to see
[2:00:23] this hour that we're living in this
[2:00:25] expression that we're called to in this
[2:00:26] hour
[2:00:28] it's not something that's just happening
[2:00:30] on the side
[2:00:31] or on the sidelines
[2:00:33] this has been god's plan from before the
[2:00:35] foundation of the world
[2:00:37] i said
[2:00:39] be it unto me
[2:00:41] according to your word
[2:00:44] i believe it lord
[2:00:45] i may not be able to produce it i may
[2:00:48] not have
[2:00:49] all all my thinking right all my actions
[2:00:52] may not line up but lord i believe it
[2:00:54] with all my heart just like mary
[2:00:55] believed the voice of that angel i
[2:00:57] believe the voice of this angel
[2:01:00] and i want to say be it unto me let me
[2:01:02] embrace it lord and become one with it
[2:01:04] and let me in the message become the
[2:01:07] same
[2:01:08] now i don't want to walk through life
[2:01:10] trying to get somebody to a doctrine
[2:01:13] i want to bring somebody in contact with
[2:01:15] a person
[2:01:17] amen god bless you let's all stand
[2:01:26] musicians if you could come please
[2:01:30] let's bow our heads and pray

[2:02:05] and at the end of time lord you've come
