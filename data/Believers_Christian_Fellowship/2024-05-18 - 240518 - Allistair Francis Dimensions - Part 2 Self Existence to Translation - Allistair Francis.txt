qualified to speak to people to tell them about who you are I'm not qualified to tell people what your essence is I have no Supernatural knowledge to impart of what you were before the foundation of the world or what the fibers were that you used to create things just IM mortal sinner saved by grace oh God and I pray that I would consecrate myself right now Lord and step out of the way as we speak these wonderful things that was revealed by the prophet messenger in the last days but we can only have the vision because of this visitation that occurred in our time and we are such a privileged people hallelujah I pray today Lord that we would all just give you the preeminence this evening and invite you in Among Us Lord bless the reading of the word and everything that would be said and done as we invite you in Lord take the Liberty to speak to our souls Lord bless us now we pray and for all those who have needs May their faith rise that they might claim what is theirs amen this is our prayer Lord we ask it now in your wonderful glorious and precious name the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you Saints before you take your seats let's read two portions of scripture Ephesians 1:9 we referred to some of it last night Ephesians 1: 99-1 and then also 1 Peter 1 3:5 if you don't want to you don't have to turn to in your Bible you can just follow up on the screens and the word of God reads like this having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times this is now am he might gather together in one all things in Christ amen gathered together in one that's you and this is the dispensation of the fullness of times that means Noah's time had a promise Abram's time had a promise Solomon's time had a promise all of them have covenants but they were incomplete this is the dispensation of the fullness of times he will bring together all things in one all together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the the counsel of his own will amen we're glad for his own will 1 Peter 13:5 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead talking about that inheritance incorruption able to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away that's your theophany reserved in heaven for you who not what it's not a literal Mansion it's a who who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time it's a who that has to be revealed in the last time it's not a what it's a who it's your theophany it's the second man the Lord From Heaven we have born the image of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven amen that's the image we are going to Bear we are bearing right now Heaven and Earth embracing the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated amen we like to greet you once again in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ I just want to say I'm just loving your attitude your love for the word it's it's such a pleasure just to preach to people who love the word I can't tell you how easy that makes one feel and also nervous at the same time so I don't know about relaxing we appreciate uh the song special brother Chad really made me chuckle there he said it's so frustrating these people write songs and put the whole Revelation into one song and it takes us 5,000 words to do the same thing when we have to teach it it's just beautiful amen but we thank God for every gift that is dedicated to the Lord so we appreciate your songs of praise and worship amen and all the labor that's been done to make it possible so uh you know how it is and I'm not very good at at all the these things yesterday I forgot to bring greetings from South Africa from our church I was just so stuck you know getting the word across I forgot all the the usual niceties that we have to get through so uh maybe the Saints back home or forgive me for not conveying their greetings anyway you've been told so uh this evening we're going to again continue the fun that we started last night and uh this evening is going to be very different there's going to be a lot of uh pictures drawings animations uh I don't mean cartoon animation like television just PowerPoint animations uh so and and what we're going to do is um and you don't have to take notes I promise you we'll leave the presentation here with the pastor and the tech team and whatever and you can get it all let's just focus in and pay attention to it so also I want to say um from the very beginning whatever I'm going to tell you tonight and whatever we're going to go through I'm still learning I don't have the absolute on it my I want you to discern my spirit this evening I don't want to deceive people it's not my intention to tell you the wrong thing but I'm compelled to say what I see and all I want to do is give you a boost to go and look into it yourself and should you improve on it you share it with me and then we can get better at this because when we talk about things like this being trapped in light matter time I don't believe I have the ability to tell you what the self-existing one was and describe his Essence and describe his being and his frame of mind and to say that God wanted to do this how do I know what he wanted and I can only e either try to imagine or hear the prophet's words and try to uh express it into our simple language to to bring it across but truthfully I'm I'm just floundering like any other Mortal on this Earth with just a little bit more light because of of Malachi 4 so if it's anything that you've not been taught that way or we're talking about bodies you know Paul says some man will come come and ask you know in what body is this and that and here we are today asking the very questions so I just want to make that clear that uh if it's anything that you're not um um used to or you feel uh firm about something just take it with a pinch of salt um I hope that's an American uh expression as well uh and then we can have wonderful fellowship with it so what we're going to talk about about is something that is very dear to me and opened up my entire uh life into this message into the the the opening of the seventh seal and basically everything so we spoke about Dimensions last night and just that subject of Dimensions did you see how many things open up when you talk about hell you're basically a unveiling demonology amen you're that one entire subject on its own demonology when you talk about the realm of communication and ether you're talking about so much more than just waves through which you hear things uh some hearing some of the things the brothers were sharing including brother Chad last night after the service and the things they picked up from it is it just shows you how much bigger it is than what we can must in just one service and if you speak about heaven you you just can't stop um and it open you're not just talking about the seven seal you're talking about The Throne of God you're talking about the Tabernacle in the wilderness amen we talk about and and things you need to understand is like the dimension of Heaven being here it's not like um when you look at the seventh Dimension being the word the seventh dimension in Moses day was the tabernacle the the the the holy of holies that that was Heaven because that's where God was right and all that made up the seventh Dimension was the ark behind the veil amen the prophet Moses and Aaron they were Heaven the Tabernacle was Earth because he said to Moses you shall be God and Aaron thy Prophet which is why the headship of heaven was the The Ark Moses and the high priest because they they were linked by the holiest of holies so if we just think of Heaven as a place we miss those important aspects amen and the things I don't have the time to to take those dimensions and and talk about it over just the weekend is that you can apply that to everything in the church the pastor is part of Heaven the church is the Earth Amen in your home the the Father the husband of the house is heaven the mother is Earth the children are children of the earth those Dimensions apply and if you know what each designation is you can appreciate so much more what your roles are you can actually apply those dimensions and it's really really beautiful Saints All right so this evening we're going to go into this is just my favorite subject of all subjects so this is Dimensions part two and our title is going to be self existence to translation so this is only half the story the other half you are going to have to do so we're going to start from self-existing God to translation and see how the dimensions develop and after the translation you're going to have to do it all the way to the new Heaven and new earth amen that's that's your homework and I'm just giving you the start and you can enjoy it are you ready God bless you all right so we're going to begin with a quote where I love this because brother R says this in many places the four ways of seeing God I'm going to take about four ways to see God he says then we'll come down and make it in the last part of it a way where you'll be have to see God I'm going to show him to you I'm going to show him to you if I can by the help of the whole of the spirit tonight in our in four different manners now first we want to speak of God in his Universe God in his word God in his son then God here in his people and that's when you when you read that you're already reading about Dimensions right I want to show you God in his Universe show you God in his word show you God in his son then see God in his people he preaches this in show us the father and it suffices you're going to see that brother Bram says this in many places I encourage you those of you who love studying go look at the four ways to see God it's absolutely beautiful so can you agree four ways to see God in his Universe in his word in his son notice in his word in his son amen amen the word was the son's Heavenly existence son brother bam says is an Earthly existence amen the word became the sun on Earth the Sun had a beginning and an ending Hebrews Series right and then God in his people so this is very important to know who Jesus was before he was Jesus he was the word and we are taken because we were in the word before he became Jesus on Earth very important for us when we get to the dimensions all right so quick uh um revision on this all right so there's our diagram of the seven dimensions and you'll see there in yellow I've put in the numbers okay and uh brother Ben reminded me it seems last night in all the excitement I had I forgot to mention the fourth dimension running along the side there I I I know you saw it I know we spoke about it I just forgot to highlight it in the sense that that Dimension I just spoke about what's going up and what's going down but if you see that on the side you'll notice the realm of communication the reason it's been placed there is that it is used by both God and the enemy to contact the first three dimensions so but we did say that last night in order to cont contct us both God and Satan use the fourth dimension amen all right so I want you to all memorize this okay if I say heaven you say seven right you ready ether light matter right [Applause] time hell five well done region of angels and the reason why we're doing that is we're going to use the numbers all through this teaching this evening we're going to use the numbers remember what they are right what's seven seven is heaven amen the Lord bless you so seven is the realm of the word six is the the region of angels and we know it became also the regions of the Blessed because after after Christ every person that died in Christ went up into the sixth Dimension that's what the prophet tells us we know that when Christ died Paradise which was in The Fifth Dimension was emptied out and they were taken up into the six the regions of the blessed are you with me all right so and then of course five is hell so now we're going to begin with self-existing one the self-existing one so this is not my fantastic drawing this is a uh an impression I took off the internet which I generally don't do but because brother bam said he was the self-existing one the Fountain of seven colors right so this is just a representation please don't say brother alist drew a picture of God okay this is the self-existing one amen he brother Ram said the Fountain of seven colors before there was anything before there was time before there was an atom before there was anything that was him we don't understand that existence we don't know their existence it wasn't even Heaven that's right because it was just him amen so this wasn't even the seventh Dimension that's right we don't even know what this was are you with us all right no Dimensions no state of existence with relation to man right blessed be his name then brother Benham says in him were many attributes in him was the attribute to be father to be son to be Redeemer to be savior uh to be the lion of the tribe of Judah uh the warrior to be the trumpeter to be uh wife to be husband all the seeds of every potential that could ever be created was in him amen amen amen and those attributes are Eternal attributes because he is eternal amen glory to God and then out of the fountain he says world the logos so that's my impression of world okay I'm going to put in a picture and don't all shout at once it's also I'm putting it there for a particular purpose because you're used to it all right the logos the word sir he was the word now what you're looking at here is the seventh Dimension coming into existence in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God John 11 so there's our seventh Dimension beginning and notice all the attri rutes that were in the fountain of seven colors the self-existing one is also in the logos he was with God and it was God all those attributes we now now those attributes are changing because the attributes are becoming potential to become word and to become manifested word that's right they're not just Natures existing in a self-existing one they're now becoming the potential to be expressed that's right that's the seventh Dimension this is related to man because God is giving birth to himself with the intent of producing his sons amen that's why this Dimension is coming into existence and this is the seventh Dimension now notice this seventh Dimension like we spoke of last night the seventh Dimension consists of the word Heaven consists of the word this is the word this is his person this is the person of Jesus Christ before he became flesh this is who he really is this is the masculine nature of God who is our husband the husband of our soul before we even knew him amen this is the seventh Dimension he was invisible he was there was nobody to worship him he wasn't even god brother bam says because there was no one to worship him God by the way is an English word it's a terrible English word which uh God didn't even call him self God it is a a designation and a word humans gave I mean what does God even mean something that you subject yourself to something that you worship brother Mar said an object of worship how terrible is it that we can just call him that small word God but it means something to us and he used our understanding to express himself to us through the words we could understand like Elohim yeah right Elohim is a plural meaning Gods it was a canaanitish word which when Abraham arrived he began to speak with that so when you read the first commandment it says I uh am the Lord thy God you shall have no other gods beside me that means I am adoni thy Elohim Thou shalt have no other Elohim besides me that's what the Hebrew actually says Elohim is not actually a name of him it was a word a canaanitish word but he had to express his nature through our words it's wonderful to talk about him amen now this logos means we shared the seventh Dimension with the logos when we were in attribute form amen right we were attributes in him and something happened because in him were masculine attributes and feminine attributes am amen the feminine attributes is that lamb section of the book that feminine those can you see those those dots those attributes within that Circle and so m stands for masculine F stands for feminine right and those names or attributes because they originate from him are the names that can never be blotted out they are not added on right neither can they be blotted out this is not the book of life this is the book of the Lamb's life this is the book of eternal life this is the book of God's life amen and these attributes is who you and I are amen the those attributes found bodies that had come here by permissive will and they lay there by his for knowledge and his predestination till the time he received the Holy Ghost they were dormant and and then they were Quicken to Life by receiving the Holy Ghost and begin to produce and germinate when the word for your day came glory to God you know it's like the book of Psalms somewhere it says Joseph remained in Chains until his word came did you remember that until his word came he couldn't find his position he was doing his own thing he was in prison he was with his brothers was wasting his time he was chosen to save the world in Egypt he remained in Chains fed until his word came that means the the the the time came for his value his election to be made manifest amen amen and this is where every one of your word originated from you can only be what he wants you to be until your word comes amen it's a personal this is why the second coming of the Lord the seven seal is a personal coming I think I may have mentioned it here the last time it's the reason why we don't apply a date to the coming or a time to the coming because I like I said before the first coming to the woman at the well was not the same time as zakus this the first coming to John the Baptist was not the same as it was to Peter it spanned a period of time and even though Peter would have said he hasn't come to John the Baptist he had come right and to the woman at the well if she said he had he had not come to zakus he had come whichever one it was not it didn't have to be a coming where everybody recogniz recognizes it at the same time which is why we don't apply uh doctrines like laws and say well you have to you have to uh understand you have to accept it February 28th 1963 was the coming of the Lord and that's it no the coming of the Lord is when you recognize it to you whether so the date and the time is not significant it's irrelevant it's when it comes to you personally because when it comes to you personally that's when the gene awakens and the coming of the Lord starts working itself inside of you glory to God now this is where it gets better right so there's your seventh Dimension uh Angels brother bam says were created uh and that was the sixth Dimension so Angels was the first creation I love this thought because I I don't know what God was doing I cannot tell you exactly what he had in his mind but he gave the Angels uh free will a lot of people thought they didn't but if they didn't have free will how could they be deceived by uh Satan or Lucifer the son of the morning how could they be deceived if they had no free will if they were just you know programmed things that just stayed there and just bowed down and worship all the time so if you read this this was a new Celestial existence Celestial meaning Heavenly right Angels were just a six Dimension existence Angels were not like the attributes that were in the logos who is us there were an existence of that God created I don't know why brother BR Says angels are messengers why did God need Messengers at that time when he was not sending messenger messages to anyone I don't know I cannot answer that can only tell you what brother bam said there were just a six-dimension existence so remember I told you we just going to use the numbers right so it'll help me if you remember so I don't have to keep saying six Dimension seven Dimension okay there were a sixth existence right not being able to be married to the word angels are cannot be married to the word they don't have a designation where they can be one with the logos are you with us and at that time they were higher than anything else but we're going to see something when Adam is created okay so um we have no idea or evidence to prove what this existence looked like I I just want to I just want to tell you my private thoughts because when I think about when when we we getting to know our husband very well right and and we we get to know his divine nature and we get to know um some of his intentions and and the things that he does he didn't he couldn't have just created uh what I'm saying is I don't want you to imagine in your mind whole bunch of shiny beings that look like light just floating around in in space or standing on some C Cal glass plane with nothing to do except wait for instructions what it more seems like is they had a life right in a sixth Dimension it's it was a physical Celestial Dimension not of light matter time not of flesh but it is nonetheless physical amen they're not Spirits floating around I don't believe they had wings are you with me yes sir the logos made himself visible in this Dimension right that's when it became uh this sixth Dimension he was he was visible to them that means when he made himself visible he took on a 76 existence are you with me this is very very important and hold on to this 76 existence okay hold on God so here's the create he creates the first man from one attribute so to create Adam he takes one attribute and he he says let us make man in our image all right and we know if he was a trinity there would have been three attributes in one but it wasn't it was two right here's the man Adam because I don't want to make a picture of a man there right now just these little oval shapes M is for masculine F is for feminine can you see he's a an exact replica of the logos as the logos is full of masculine attributes and feminine attributes the first theophany was masculine and feminine in the day that they were created male and female created he them and that was dominance you shall be God upon the Earth you shall replenish you shall multiply not just multiply themselves multiply every other species in other words make sure the ecological system is in order make sure they bring forth with order be the light to them this theophany was going to become god of the Earth this he he was powerful because he was two attributes in Perfect Harmony am how do we know because everything in this world operates on the same principle you cannot have electricity without two attributes in Perfect Harmony negative and positive charges you cannot have magnetism without a north and a South Pole in harmony you cannot have flow of water without high pressure and low pressure everything in this life operates on this principle God two attributes in Perfect Harmony which is why it comes in the end time for it to be him complete there has to be a feminine designation of him on Earth Amen to bring everything in Christ both which is in heaven and which is in on Earth in one glory to to God so there is your first man Genesis 1: 12627 and it was 67 right so which means they were a 67 existence yeah right they were theophany joined with the seven word form body that's what theophany is Right amen the word form body so that was the potential that was the Genesis 12627 man beautiful so Genesis 2:7 can you see that Clearly Now watch that God takes that he raises up a body of Flesh and he joins this body of Flesh with the theophany that is the marriage of Heaven and Earth that's Heaven and Earth coming to together by the way brother Lonnie Jenkins preached this for us when I was 16 with two transparencies which he placed one and then placed the other one on top so I'm not telling you something new yeah in case some of you were here I hope you were not sleeping Genesis 2:7 man right so what and this is what we call a glorified Earthly body why is it glorified it's an Earthly body that is in Union with a theophany that's what makes it glorified glorified flesh are we together how do we know this because brother bam says if you take that off the man he is just Beast foot of the bare hand of the monkey right so Genesis 27 man was flesh man this was his new existence Dimensions 1 2 6 and 7 are we together light matter realm of angels and combined with the word this is the existence of man being God In the Garden of Eden 1 267 notice there is no time right because he's Eternal three cannot be included in there because he's got seven this was glorified flesh no time no Third Dimension yet Genesis 221 to2 he then creates the woman notice he makes another body of Flesh which he pulls out of the man but to be glorified all or both of them are covered by the same theophany giving them both glorified flesh because they were one in theophany brother Bram said he just took the feminist attribute out of the man and placed it in the other body but they are one in theophany amen are we together yeah again this is what the prophet said how do I explain this I don't know but he even tells you that you husbands and wives are one in theophany amen God Amen so once again both Adam and Eve have a one 267 existence remember what are dimensions planes of existence linked to man are you with us amen glory to God fleshly glorified condition again and no Third Dimension then we go to the fall Genesis 3 man and woman when she disbelieved when she reasoned and tried to bring forth sons of God by her own will what happens they lose six and seven they lose they they lose their inheritance their Heavenly inheritance what did he say the day you shall eat thereof you shall surely die so immediately they moved into light matter and time began in their existence because now they were dying Fifth Dimension is hell because they had forsaken the purpose of God and because there was no way yet for them to come back to the sixth Dimension if they should die they go to paradise so right then their existence is 1 2 3 5 light matter time and death and Hell begin to set in are you with us amen follow the Thought So they lost the theophany they left with the masculine and feminine nature of fleshly man they lost the feminine and masculine nature of the logos they lost the ability to be God on Earth as they stood they were very powerful they were the apex predator on Earth but now the ground was not going to be conducive to them it was going to bring forth thorns and thistles by the way thorns and thistles is not just plants with aggression thorns and thistles include mosquitoes cockroaches stuff to deal with death and bacteria it begin to evolve into things that should not have been right all this yucky stuff that that occur because of viruses all those things begin into form which were going to work against their purpose just because they chose their own will they went into a 1 2 3 5 existence wow you know it sounds bad it sounds tragic it sounds terrible but this is the Glorious story of redemption they lost eternity time came in and in the day that they eat you shall surely die all right 4,000 years go by from Adam 4,000 years to Christ right in the 4,000 Years brother tells us there were two dispensations of God two dispensations of the Father the age of conscience the age of conscience and the age of law is that right and they were trying to get back to the original the law was even brought in to start training the flesh to come back and prepare for the first coming of the Messiah and and 4,000 years man lived at the mercy of the nature of the flesh by Noah's time it was so corrupted by this 1 2 3 5 existence that God said I've had it I'm going to destroy it had it not been for Noah keeping his lineages perfect it would have all been done he had to restart but because Noah was a faithful man in that regard God could see he could continue it through Noah bring the flood and continue it on the other other side but they lived at the mercy of the nature of Flesh man trying to be moral trying to make their own morality but they had no influence of six and seven why the way to the tree of life was barred so what's God got to do to bring Redemption the whole plan is about bringing six and seven back the whole point is to for us to come back to 1267 they struggled by the law to control the effects of time and hell time and death every religion that is existing on Earth is about how to manage time and death every human of every religion has a solution for what happens after death whether it's Muhammad the prophet uh Shiva in Hinduism Buddha they all have theories about what happens after death each one has one has meditation one has you need to get close to God by being God conscious one has you have to believe Muhammad the prophet one has uh bahaism one has everybody has something uh because they're trying to manage what happens with dimensions three and five we only have this amount of time left if and they're they're telling you if within time you can become more Godly you can transcend in your spirit thereafter the poor state of human beings struggling yeah with Dimensions 3 and five they had not the influence of the theophany to lead the masculine and feminist Natures however look how powerful these masculine feminine Natures are look at the cities we've created the the modes of Transport the scientific advancements without the influence of six and seven look at how powerful man has become right because that feminine and masculine attribute is by definition God God even though it's in now in a corrupted form it's God perverted it had to take the coming of the Messiah to start the first half of the process so that's where we go because what happens when a son of man comes in he starts changing Dimensions so here's the son of man Christ the word veiled in flesh he's born into time born of the Virgin notice he's born in a time because he's born it means it's beginning it means it's time so Christ's body was a one two three existence light matter time but notice there's no hell amen amen now watch this he is 1 23 he's born of the Virgin and we know this because they said he was at 33 they he was trying trying to tell them before Abraham was I am before Moses and they say but you look like you're about 50 years old that tells us his flesh was actually aging that's right it was subject to time that's right and we know that cuz he was born from an infant and began to grow so the Savior himself left eternity the Loos himself left eternity and came into time yeah eternity stepping into time subjecting himself to time to the dimension of time to our existence so he could bring us back to six and seven but there he was 1 2 3 that was his body but he was different he was the word veiled in flesh this is the mystery because the seventh Dimension was within him amen as opposed to Adam who was flesh and the Seven dimension veiling him yeah right remember that seven Dimension veiling him they were naked and they knew it not Christ wore clothes yeah and the seventh Dimension was veiled it was God veiled in flesh praise be to God this body has time in it so it ages even though it veils the seventh doesn't that give you hope am because here we are born of a woman this tells us this is possible possible this tells us at some point should the seven Dimension come down this is a possible existence that I can be the word veiled in flesh glory to God that's why it's so important to understand Dimensions amen beautiful then at Calvary we were just speaking about this the other day in Gethsemane brother Benham says the god part left him leaves him because God cannot die but his body which was the word made flesh had to die on the cross to be the perfect sacrifice to be sacrificed for us for our sin to redeem us back to him then the dimensions shift again because when he dies he descends into hell he leaves his body of matter in the Tomb and his time and and he be and he he moves into the dimension of hell so he's got an existence of being a spirit he's descending into hell to release those who are in the existence of five [Music] Amen brother bam says this by the way I don't have time to read all the quotes I'm I'm taking it that you know it amen in the message in tment his body was left there he went into hell to preach to the souls that were in prison he says that ins Souls that are in prison now you remember that so he enters the fifth Christ the word dies so he can go into the fifth and release those who died in God this was David said you he will never leave my soul in Hell amen I think that was prophecy hell and the keys of death at the time he descended to take the power of death away from man now remember what is 35 35 is what was added when Adam sinned he became 35 to go and release that and take the power of death Hell In The Grave away from man so now we know there's hope for every one of us that is born after Christ it is possible for three and five to be taken out glory amen oh I love him so in the Resurrection now these are the things we love to talk about love to question love to fellowship about what body did he appear and what happened here what happened there how could he disappear how could he go through walls who knows in the resurrection he comes up out of hell he comes into a 1267 light matter his theophany is now veiling him how do we know Mary comes to the tomb he looks like a man her eyes are open he looks like the gner yeah and she says Where have you put the body of my Lord at one point he says why seek ye the living amongst the dead oh that's Dimensions right there why seek you the living amongst the dead and then you know they answer really strangely and then they begin to walk away and he calls her name and then she turns around and re why didn't she see him if he was the same Jesus who resurrected in that body with nail scars and blood all of that stuff on him you you you might be uh theological enough to say well their eyes were Holden why were their eyes Holden because he came up in a glorified form he was now the second Adam 1267 who had just released the 35 from human existence made there a potential to lose the effects of death and hell and he's standing there with them in a glorified condition and they cannot see him they cannot recognize him maybe because he he died like a 33y old man but now he was looking different he had to be different because if he resurrected with with scars and like an old man then that's telling us that that's how we're going to be resurrected the glorified body is a perfect body now you see why I told you that these things can be complicated because for so long we've been told he came out with nail scars and holdes in his hand I know what you think just remember I've read all that too it says but Thomas asked it doesn't say he showed Thomas right he says he discerned Thomas and the moment he discerned Thomas it doesn't even say Thomas looked it says Thomas Fell to his face my Lord and my God now I don't know I cannot tell perhaps he's able to move between here and there perhaps he has the ability to become whatever he wants to because he's the word but he comes up in the resurrection in a glorified Form 1 2 6 and 7 in this Resurrection he was reunited with his theophany he was now glorified flesh like Adam the Eden condition of the masculine restored first coming amen there was no more time in him he's moving toward eternity again this may also explain why it was not easy to recognize him he was able to move at any time between 671 to 67 right because if you're in a dimension faster than this one there's no wall there he just shift and every time they see him they can't recognize him they see a guy there on the shore and he's doing something and the who is he they just saw him they just testified they saw him then they see him again and they can't recognize him what's going on I mean how many times can the eyes be beholden what it's telling you is Shifting between dimensions and then he has to keep revealing himself saying it is I when he appeared in the room they thought it was a ghost again he told them who he was he appears again and they're frightened every time because being in light matter a time this is different to see him in this form you know I hear when brother bam speaks about the Ang standing in his room and brother Billy Paul's testimony of I wow I would have passed out honestly I would have definitely passed out what what would it be like to see his Angelic form to have your eyes open to see into that Dimension W something are you still with us so he leaves his glorified Earthly existence this is now his Ascension 1267 right before their eyes where they're looking at him tangible he's now about to leave their existence and move back to the word form are we together amen went back to the existence he had before he came he remained in the state of existence for the seven church ases right how do we know because Paul meets him on the way to Damascus there's a quote brother brandham said Paul met him in the form that he was before he came yeah he was and he said I am Jesus the first time the Loos identifying himself as Jesus brother bar said that was his word for now I'm telling you again I read all the quotes I know what what the things that brother maram says some of the most confusing things brother man said he went up into heaven his body lay on the Altar for a memorial and his theophany sits on the throne and when we read this we're confused this is a prophet talking yes this is prophets tell you what they see they don't explain what they see how could this happen literally in the form that brother bam said it because if Jesus was alive now his body's laying on the altar while he's sitting in theophany on the throne does it mean Jesus died again that his body is laying dead in Heaven on the altar obviously this is symbolic that the blood still applies that there's always going to be salvation for you whenever you accept it but as to whether the body is literally laying there on an altar in a seventh Dimension lying dead while he's sitting in theophany that really doesn't mesh with who God is I feel like we when we get the open book we need to look with eyes that are much more looking into the vision and understand you know I I like like I told you yesterday I know there might be people who say yeah but there's this quote that he that he spoke about in 53 where he speaks about when he is ascending and brother bam is talking about it in a very romanticized way and he's saying I can see him go past the Moon and the Sun and the Stars you say brother Alistar you were wrong Heaven is a place beyond the stars cuz there's what brother Bram said and that was 53 but then in in after the seals he then tells you Heaven is not there it's here just a dimension faster than this one so which one am I going to take the one after the seals have been open we we can argue as much with quotes everywhere but it you need to place them in perspective in the right context and in the time because brother bam was learning as he was going are you with us glory to God this that we're seeing in the first coming is not even the Glorious part as to what happens to us amen amen glory to God so he ascends he goes back to the word form that he was before the foundation of the world he goes back to his word existence that's what brother bam says so here's the church ages can you all see that this is you this is me this is all the humans in the church ages we have a 1 2 3 five existence right we are light matter time and at any point this body is a child of death going to hell if there is no salvation so which means we are living in light matter time and we are being directly affected by The Fifth Dimension we were Sinners we were being influenced by a lower Dimension so our existence without the word without god without coming to Christ is 1 2 35 do you agree this is what in other words we're in the condition when Adam and Eve sinned all humans have this condition are you with us young people this is why you need the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost given for yeah the Hol the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a temporary gift amen why it was given when you had no Revelation it was a gift to do something amen because as long as you were linked to hell you are not going to be able to believe the B those leaks of Fire in case you didn't realize that might look like a yellow bear porw or something licks of fire just a symbol of the baptism of the Holy Ghost when that comes upon you it blocks and suppresses the influence of hell what does it give you the ability to believe the word that is coming for your age if the Holy Ghost does not come you have no ear to hear what the spirit says unto the churches that's why the Holy Ghost came in the church AG dispensation young people you cannot hear his word without receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen thank God for that so he died and he said I pray the father will send you the comforter who will guide you into all truth the Holy Spirit of Promise he is going to suppress the Beast nature that came by The Fifth Dimension and give you the ability to believe every word that comes by the messenger for your day praise be to God Amen amen seven so what is the Holy Ghost it is the anointing of the seventh Dimension that's what he first sent so before he sends you the seven Dimension before the seven Dimension comes upon you he sends you the Holy Ghost which is the anointing of the seventh Dimension the the seventh Dimension anointing gives you dominance over the effects of death and Hell notice what happened to the people in the church ages when they receive the Gospel of of Christ these people marched forward yeah what people in their right Minds would walk into a circus of lions praising God not afraid of lions bears being chopped in half sorn and under who can do that in a 1 2 3 5 existence everyone would run in fear but they had this holy ghost on them which gave them the ability to overcome death and hell and not be afraid they stood there while being eaten alive praising God and to the the there were spoil Sports to the Romans who were looking at them expecting them to scream and shout and cry and and protest instead these people were dying willingly Oh Glory to God they were in 1 2 35 received the Holy Ghost suppressing the Beast Nature by anointing them with the seventh now they could uh easily lose this anointing this is why if you receive the Holy Ghost by disbelieving you can lose it the baptism of the Holy Ghost remember brother mam said justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost must make way for the person of Christ that's the ultimate the Son of God dispensation that is the Holy Ghost dispensation over 2,000 years is a temporary dispensation it's leading us to move moving into the next part of the disp of the dimensions are you with us so uh you could have the Holy Ghost you could be Anointed with the gift of tongues interpretation prophecy and then you could lose it we've seen that what does this prove the rain falls on the just and the unjust there are many one two three of five people who were in the church in the message under the prophet received the baptism of the Holy Ghost made real prophecies and when the the seven seal came they rejected it and lost it amen this Holy Ghost was a temporary anointing and it was an evolving anointing it started with a lion went to an ox went to a man anointing and went to an eagle anointed but even that comes to an end because it must make way for the lamb glory to God who by the way is the fifth beast in the throne hallelujah amen if they accepted the messenger they received a part of the seven inside that's right because remember the word came in a part portion Paul brought a portion of the word irus brought a portion so if they receive the Holy Ghost he that hath an ear let him hear he receives the word for his day and he's able to overcome he becomes the Overcomer to which there is a reward in the church ages right the reward to every Overcomer and that gave them access to Dimension six that if they kept that until they died they passed into the sixth Dimension beautiful amen glory to God receive the Holy Ghost if you die you have a promise you have an assurance that you pass into the realm of the Blessed refuse and reject the word for your day you just go back to 1 2 3 5 sir and your end is five yes amen amen are you having fun looks like we're going to finish early seven seal brings him back to Earth hallelu here is the seven seal amen now here are you 1 2 3 you've accepted the message of the hour you you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are enjoying the word for your day and now reached the day when the seven seal is about to be opened right he appears yes sir February 28 1963 brother bam said Angels was his wig 6 and Seven Angels were six you you remember that Angels was his it made him visible to mankind what who is it that that's come it's him that's right it's it's him who was there before the foundation of the world it's him who made all things that are glory to God made him visible made him visible to a Son of God standing on Earth waiting to receive ready to receive the word to impart it to the [Music] people so what does he bring he brings an open book amen where is he taking that open book too to the vessel who has the Holy Ghost who's about to receive the open book and what is he giving to him what is the open book it's Heaven he has to eat that right what happens there's the dimensions coming together all that was in Heaven is coming to Earth the dispensation the fullness of times it's about to become one with a fleshly body that has been anointed by the Holy Ghost on Earth this is the marriage the book coming down and it's got to be eaten amen glory to God March 17 to 24 1963 it happens amen and he begins to preach the seals and he reveals the seals this is the part that people stumble at because this is exactly what happens the book descended what you're looking at is Revelations 10 occurring he descended placing one foot on the earth one foot on the sea what is that right suppressing two spirits that are preventing the book what is it out of the sea was arising a beast with seven heads and 10 horns right the other was a beast who is like a lamb but spig like a dragon and both would lead the world to the mark of the beast he comes placing one foot on the land one foot on the sea with an open book in his hand and cries with a loud voice and there's a seventh Messenger on Earth to receive the book and now give it to the people this is a son of man revealing the son of man it's proving to us that a 1 2 3 can receive the seven Dimension it was the first fruits it was the wave sheath that there is a bride to come that there's a crop to grow glory to God we are see we have to see this if we don't see this you cannot believe it for yourself glory to God and that's what happens the book comes inside and for the first time in a long time we see 1 2 3 7 now I'm asking you look at the configuration of the dimensions this is not even Adam from the beginning this is Christ do you remember that in a body of time with the word veiled in flesh this is happening to you this happened in our day this is Dimensions coming together the dispensation of the fullness of times Heaven and Earth embracing we saw it happen there from March 17 to March 24 1963 did he have faults yes did he forget things yes was he still learning yes but he was still eating the book he was still seeing more he is growing the word is growing in him this is leading us to a translation and if that body should die he goes straight back to where he came from Amen to where that book was if you have that book you have the ability to walk out of death you have the ability to take control of all Dimensions you have the ability to cast out every lying Spirit you have the ability to discern all things you have the ability to understand everything in the word because you have seen the revelation of who he is this is the condition one 237 Christ the same state of existence as the first coming but this is not the end because time is there that means seven Thunders have to utter their voices to every person glory to God and this is where we come in we then come in under the third pool Ministry we never met this a son of man revealing the son of man we begin to hear about it but we begin to eat the book because the book has been preached we don't we don't come in under the first and second pool Ministry we are excited we are called by the third pole that's what called us we're not impressed by signs wonders Miracles emotions Sensations we are marry be it unto me according to Thy word let me do as you will amen we are virgin born Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ receiving the word in a virgin womb to bring forth the word like never before it's never been seen in the church ages this is taking place at the end under the third poor Ministry eat the book and now you must prophesy amen speak the word to all generations to all kindreds tongues and tribes and people this is our Revival this is what we're here for this is what's happening does it happen to everyone at once no each one of us is receiving it as we are called each one of us is maturing as it comes more and more and more we don't limit it to a day or a time that's up to God only the father knows when you should receive it only the father knows when you should receive it only the father knows when you should receive it it's not a collective thing it's a secret that even the enemy and The Fifth Dimension knows nothing about because had they known it they would have done something about it those enemy Spirits those evil spirits they tried lies there were preachers that came there were false doctrines that came the bride some of you sat under false doctrines but your womb was closed you didn't receive those false things the womb was closed waiting for the seven seal to open to you personally don't feel bad if you sat under false Doctrine I believe the fact that you are seeing the open book today means that your womb was closed he knew you he predestinated You by for knowledge he knew what part you should take he knew you would be here today receiving the open book praise be to God Amen the bride eats the book and receives the Christ existence she is Messiah sir amen amen that Dimension that existence we moved from a 1 2 35 existence to a 1 237 existence am oh I'm excited amen amen and here's the translation here we are now let's take an individual 1 2 3 7 existence can you see that I hope it's not too small all right some of the brothers complained they couldn't see it last night but I hope it's been fixed up now seven Thunders are to their voices mysterious Thunders which only the bride is able to hear the voice which speaks from Heaven what happens under the seven Thunders it takes out time yeah yes sir time shall be no more yes sir and then the Holy Ghost makes way for the person yes sir the Capstone is setting in amen the body and the unit and and the hand are becoming one unit amen amen this can only happen if youve received the book and began to eat it the head and the body he becomes personal can you see that I'll take it back again you had the Holy Ghost fine but he must make way for the person of the Holy Ghost the calf Stone must become real and personal to you this is leading you into translation this is why the Rapture is a process you are eating you are becoming him your cells are changing your atoms are changing you're coming forth in spiritual multiplication the way the sons of God used to be or should have been right this is spiritual multiplication predestinated sons are receiving the book in the last day you are just receiving six and seven six and seven is right now upon you are you hearing from your theop that you Heavenly existence what does it mean are you hearing from your theophany yes sir it's right here it's influencing you it's feeding you it's your headship your headship is here you're becoming one with it and time is moving out here's your existence one two light and matter time is moving out you are now coming to 1267 which is restored the Eden Eden condition Adam without time death is gone we are no longer in time we're starting to move into eternity this is what translation is Amen self-existence to translation Dimensions forming Dimensions progressing you becoming him going back to the Eden condition Christ the mystery said there are three there a three-fold mystery God in Christ Christ in the bride Adam and Eve going back to Eden here's the process here's the restoration yes glory to God 1 267 it's not finished because we're moving through Dimensions isn't it amazing it's so secret you're receiving the word you got no idea what's happening to you fear of death hell there's no there's peace I'm feeling peace every time depression comes the word releases it I'm constantly eating the book and more and more I'm moving into another State of Mind amen and this is what you become this is what happens in the Rapture you move into your six seven existence because this is the one you bypassed you came from attribute form straight to the flesh brother Bram says you were never the word form you were attribute you are becoming the word amen this is restoration Saints now when the head when you take the Capstone and put it upon the pyramid the whole thing is a headstone that's right amen that's right amen can you see it that's right that means you become him what does it mean that you become him you are taking on his existence he the logos took on a 67 existence his Dimensions his his existence he came away from self-existing one made himself visible in a Celestial dimension you are becoming his existence that's what it means by you becoming him we're not saying you're becoming Jesus Christ physically who was there 2,000 years ago he's giving you his existence six and seven that's what it means by you becoming him you bypass that and the Plan of Redemption takes you back to become that oh Saints it should make you stand on your feet and praise the Lord glory to God 126 was Adam Heavenly glorified body this is going to the marriage supper of the lamb now this is not Spirits floating around the 67 condition is a physical condition yes sir yeah can I explain it no I can't but it's a physical Celestial body when brother bam went beyond the curtain of time he saw them they didn't look like Spirits he he preached they would be like Spirits at you know at sometime when the prophet speaks he speaks about uh uh um what do you call it he speaks about a a a spirit formed body at one time I think he even said they were in theophany in hell did you come across that quote some time ago before the seals were open he speaks about but he he's trying to say it's a spirit body because he had the idea that theophany would be a spirit body until God took him beyond the curtain of time and he said I was so wrong amen if God did not take that Prophet beyond the curtain of time what would we know about anything we'd be leaving we'd be believing Catholic fables Protestant fables Pentecostal anointings Pentecostal fables we'd be trying to find our excitement in those things we'd be ignorant that's why the church Ages was an age of ignorance Grace was available for ignorance but ignorance is over amen because the fullness of the the word has come amen the Throne of God is descended upon Mankind and this is our state we come from Glory we come from the logos we bypassed our theophany because of Adam's sin we come into this body of Flesh he predestines his body by four knowledge to a 67 existence this is what you are predestinated to according to the purpose of his own will you have an inheritance of God incorrect corruptable not our flesh amen and when your eyes are open when that trumpet sounds this in this corruptible will become Incorruptible amen this body of sin goes back into a six s existence which we bypass that's the whole point of the message that's there is no other part of Christianity that can bring you to this there's no hope for mankind unless we finish the race there's no hope hope for mankind unless we take the book did not it say all was lost If no man took the book and John wept and the lion of the tribe of Judah prevailed he turns and he sees 1 2 37 a lamb who was worthy to take the book and lose the seals for mankind for what reason to bring us back to our theophany to restore us back to our inheritance in heaven incorruptible that does not perish that does not fade away glory to God we shared the logos once with him in atribute form but now we share the existence in Celestial form amen he did all that for us Saints I want to close with who is this mzc everything we've been speaking about I want to I want to tell you I didn't you going to say brother Alis how this is you making things up no everything I've showed you is from all over the message right in the beginning before we read this in the beginning whatever I spoke to you about the logos and the light forming the little Halo where's that from cood question one Genesis 1 it's the most amazing thing to read when you read it he talks about God his the whole question is about created man and formed man amen that was the question and then he starts to explain how he begin to make the universe and he took this rock and threw it through space and he says stop and he said the logos was like like the child playing before the father again if you take everything literal then the logos was a child playing before the father no this is the prophet he is using his his human faculties to try and describ something glorious beyond measure whatever God is showing him I don't even know if I would be able to explain that and I had more education than the prophet I had a better vocabulary than him I definitely have better grammar than him but could I explain what he saw with English with French with German with Dutch with any language with Hebrew how could we but he said like a like a child playing before the father throws out something it becomes a Galaxy there goes the sun there goes this thing there goes that thing there's Angels form and then he takes on his form and he says let us create man Saints I didn't make that up that's from Cod amen everything else I spoke did I make up that seven left him in Gethsemane brother bam said he could not die God he had to become a man to to die I didn't make that up did I make up that he went down into a hell condition to take the keys of death hell in the grave no that's in the message did I make up what happened in the church ages with the Holy Ghost with you receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost how would I know the Holy Ghost makes way for the person unless he says that in there's a man who can turn on the [Applause] light nothing that we've said is not from the message so what I want to read to you now I want to show you how easy it is for us to misinterpret a quote right as we close we're closing so brother Chad the musicians can begin to come up but I want to show you how that when we read this be this this quote is so beautiful it starts stirring all those juices inside amen but it's so easy to let humanism take over and misinterpret something which is what what we've done in the past with all the quotes with all the scriptures amen but it's glorious let's read I love this and then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole body subject to that spirit amen what's that 1 2 3 receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost right you become subject to that Spirit you don't become subject to Hell anymore and that spirit is nothing in the world but the seed word made manifest or quickened that's what happens when the Holy Ghost comes upon you the attribute that was dormant becomes starts manifes and gets quickened isn't that right in Rising of the sun he said that sun is upon you now it quickened the dirt it quickened the seed inside he said your soul changed didn't it amen amen Made Alive and when the Bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it there is no question if that Spirit did not come upon you you would not obey the word oh I missed that and what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection amen this body will be raised up again because it's already started started what the resurrection already you have been resurrected from death into life what life seven Dimension is now upon you amen what is it the earnest of the Resurrection so the Holy Ghost was the earnest of the Resurrection The Resurrection has already begun its process did I make that up did we read that together all right that proves we all have gray cells in our head and the Holy Spirit in our hearts amen this body will be raised up because it's already started it was once this body was once subject to sin you agree it was once 1 2 35 and me and Corruption and now it's got the earnest the Holy Ghost it's turned Heavenly that means it's ready to accept seven amen now that's the earnest you're going in the Rapture that's the earnest that there's a translation that you're coming to six and seven it's the earnest the Holy Ghost is the earnest you know what Earnest is he says is the down payment money he says a sick person lying laying dying nothing but left but death that's all can happen it's seen Shadows of people done eat up with cancer and tuberculosis and see them persons a little while after that perfectly normal and strong if there is no Divine Healing then there is no Resurrection cuz Divine Healing is the earnest of the Resurrection amen continuing paragraph 7 6 now this body is subject to the spirit have not yet entered into the word form do you see that which means you're still waiting for the six and seven you've received you're now subject to the Holy Spirit you're subject to the Holy Ghost but you have not entered into the word form yet so there has to be a Breaking of the seven seal because that's the purpose that's what we're waiting for the word form but we are still in the flesh form but subject to the word Death In the Flesh will take us there which means if you die here because you have this you will pass into six existence amen but we that are alive and remain will pass into six seven they're waiting for us to accomplish that amen amen just the same thing think of a little baby you can take a woman no matter how evil she is when she's pregnant fixing to be a mother watch before that baby is born I don't care how cruel the woman is she's gets real kind what some sweet Spirit comes over her there's something about her sound seems Godly to see a little mother fixing to become a mother by the baby why is it that little body now it's not alive yet see the only thing is just flesh and muscles that little jumping that's just muscles jerking but when it comes forth from the womb God breathes the breath of life into it then he screams out see just as sure as there is a natural body being form there's a spiritual body to receive it as soon as it gets there brother B says you can never be in two places at once but you can have two Natures in you amen when you drop this veil of Flesh you take on the next form amen that's what he says let's read on then when a man is Born Again from Heaven brother B says the new birth today in the say is Christ revealed to you personally not a Pentecostal experience not an altar call the new birth for the bride is the person of Christ reveal to you personally if you in there it says if you read the Bible and don't see Christ go back and read it again amen so when a man is Born Again from Heaven he becomes a spirit babe in Christ see you're taking you're eating and then when this robe of flesh is dropped there is a natural body theophany natural so when we read natural look at how easy it is to misinterpret that because we assume natural means flesh amen it's it it looks it looks like Common Sense natural means of nature yeah over nature the has a nature it is a physical Celestial body amen natural does not mean it's only subjected to light matter time a natural body theophany a body not made with hands what does that mean it's not born of the flesh it has not one two three existence neither born of a woman that we go to so if you die you leave 1 2 3 and pass into 67 that's theophonic representation that's the part we bypass and he says then that body what 67 returns back and picks up the glorified body Lord now we have a problem because we don't tend to know what brother Brandon means when he says glorified look how easy it is to misinterpret or interpret any way when you read glorified body because of how we've been taught by Elders for so long you think it's Earthly glorified body there's nothing wrong with that but do you know brother baram says glorified body for both theophany and Earthly glorified body there's quotes where he said your glorified body is standing right there next to you now amen see you can't see it that's right he standing right next to you so which glorified is he talking about but we many ministers took this quote interpreted and there's nothing wrong with that because how we see it in the moment is God revealing it to us but all I'm saying is we need to look at this through dimensions and appreciate it for how God brought it to us perhaps we need to look at it more than we did yesterday amen that body returns back here now look it it doesn't say Earthly glorified body it doesn't even say does it say here that that body returns back for the resurrection does it say that what if that meant for the millennium see it's so easy to take all the quotes and interpret however we want to the truth is most of our questions are irrelevant it doesn't matter if you make it and turn it into any Doctrine and say well this is the Creed of our church then you're in trouble because when it comes time to see what God wants to reveal new to you you cannot do it I don't know how this is to be interpreted all it says is then that body theophany returns back and picks up the glorified this can apply to Resurrection and first resurrection in the Millennium where we come from theophany from Marriage supper to pick up the glorified body on Earth to live in a fleshly glorified body for 1,000 years it could mean that that's why I said the second half of this is your homework amen amen you you can take it from translation from Marriage supper and take it all the way to new heavens and new earth you'll find in new heavens and new earth there's no time amen even light changes apparently there's no need there's no need for light from anything else the city has a light of the Lamb because there is no night things are changing Dimensions will change in the new Heaven and new earth there's no hell there's no five there's no lies there's no doubt amen it's a a new existence dimensions are going to are going to change back to when they never existed before it's going to be a new existence what will the body look like then I don't know I'm sure waiting to find out amen that's the reason look there it is Jesus went to hell when he died and preached to the souls that were in prison turned back into that theophany did I make it up that he said after he came out of hell he went into the offering 1267 I didn't make it up there it is right or marvelous thank God 2 Corinthians 51 if this Earthly body be dissolved this Earthly Tabernacle we have another one see now this is a part I really love we have bypassed that that to come so there it is I didn't make it up again we bypass that to come straight from God the attribute to be flesh to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did but when testing of his word is over then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world that six seven existence it is the word there that we skipped we came from thought to flesh we bypass the word form when your word comes then you begin your purpose amen just like Joseph skipped to right around down here to be tempted and tested if we'd have come through that there have been no temptation we have knowed all things that's the reason Jesus knowed all things cuz he was word before he was flesh then we become the word the purpose of you receiving the book is to turn the sinful flesh to become the word because you B pass the word form glory to God you are made you receive the condition the existence of melkisedek who is melchisedek he was without father without mother without beginning of days without end of life that's where we're going priests Kings and Priests after the order of meiscraft and you worship began praise be to God for we have been made Kings and Priests after the order of melchisedek with no genealogy no earthly birth we have passed that we bypassed it once but we come to it we become the order of melkisedek Kings and Priests of the most high God that's the new song of the Bride when the book is taken glory to God then we become the word amen here we are formed here we are formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning did we make anything up tonight you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey many of you can remember you joined this church and you join that church you tried this and that and nothing satisfy that's right but one day you just recognize it praise be to God Amen we are seated in Heavenly places seven has come down to us by the open book brought into your heart you receive it you eat it you become it you prophesy you become him 1 267 restored back to an Eden condition ready to go back to your word formed body glory to God let's stand together and give him praise praise be to God Amen let's bow our heads as we pray Heavenly Father praise be unto you Lord Jesus how wonderful you are Lord we know father though we are in this flesh in this place Lord with our simple existence of of light matter time we feel so insignificant Lord

have to pay taxes we have to pay bills we have to find medical insurance we have to find things that help us in hospital we've been going through all these things Lord and yet you have brought by a great messenger in this last day an Angelic appearing Lord Jesus that brought to us the book The Book of Life the book of all things the the title deed to our theophany Lord an inheritance that passed
