TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Now listen verse 37. I think this is the most important one. &gt;&gt; Now when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were pricricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do? Listen, to me, this is the most critical part because there has to be somewhere for the fulfillment of prophecy, the mystery to strike. &gt;&gt; Yes. And where does it strike? It struck their heart. &gt;&gt; And they were pricricked in their heart. There was some that day who were not pricricked in their heart. &gt;&gt; This is not about going through the motions. This is not about copy and paste. This is not about repeat after me. This is about when the disposational change was manifest was preached and when he was declared to them the day that they were living in with the fulfillment prophecy for that day, something inside of them began to jump and they were pricked in their heart. THEY KNEW INSIDE THAT WHAT Peter was saying was the truth. &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAID, "NOW WHAT DO WE DO?" &gt;&gt; It wasn't like, "What do I need to do to go to heaven? I'll do what it takes to go to heaven. GIVE ME THE PROCESS." IT WASN'T THAT kind of thing, friends. &gt;&gt; They were hearing the word preached. And when they heard the word for their hour priest and the fullness of the revelation, the mystery, the key, opening up the the the kingdom of heaven TO THEM, SOMETHING INSIDE of them began to move and they were pricricked in their heart. And they said to Peter AND THE BRETHREN, "WHAT DO WE DO NOW?" &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THE TRUTH. AMEN. WE COME TO THIS FEAST. WE COME, WE'VE BEEN FULFILLING ALL THE LAW OF MOSES. We've been looking forward TO THIS DAY FOR GENERATIONS FROM GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS. NOW, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS TOUCHING ME IN MY SOUL. IT'S BRINGING A REACTION OUT OF ME. NOW, WHAT DO I DO? AND HE SAYS, "REPENT. CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT ALL OF THIS. AND COME TO THE OPEN WORD. COME TO THE TRUTH." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of SINS AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; IT STILL WORKS TODAY. THE SAME EXACT WAY, THE SAME EXACT FORMULA, NOT AS A FORMULA LIKE THE BAPTISTS DO. TAKE YOU THROUGH the old Roman road, read to you a couple scriptures, get you to agree with it, and repeat after me PRAYER AND YOU'RE SAVED. NOT THAT KIND OF PRAYER, NOT KIND OF SALVATION, BUT THE KIND FROM THE BIBLE, THE KIND from Pentecost WHEN WHEN YOU PREACH THE PROPHECY FULFILLED IN YOUR DAY, THE WORD FOR THIS DISPENSATIONAL change that we're in RIGHT NOW, PREACHING CHRIST ALIVE IN OUR DAY, AMEN, AND GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THEM, THIS IS THE TRUTH, THIS IS THE DAY, NOT AS OUR FATHERS, BUT GOD HAS BROUGHT SOMETHING TO PASS IN OUR DAY. AND WHEN THEY HEAR THAT, THEY'RE PRICRICKED IN THEIR HEART. WHAT DO YOU DO THEN? REPENT FROM YOUR DENOMINATIONAL UNDERSTANDING. REPENT FROM YOUR WORLDLY IDEAS AND COME TO THIS JESUS CHRIST, THE TRUTH REVEALED before you &gt;&gt; and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus CHRIST. AND YOU [screaming] SHALL WITHOUT ANY SHADOW OF A DOUBT, WITHOUT ANY QUESTION, receive the baptism of the HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; THAT FORMULA STILL WORKS today &gt;&gt; if we approach it the same way &gt;&gt; and if it comes by the same results in effect. It's the revelation of the word.
