Jesus, [singing] [music] you are Jesus, King of Kings, Lord of Lords. [music] I worship you. [singing] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a privilege to come and worship him. Let's bow our heads together this morning. Dear Lord, it's such a privilege for us to be here this morning, God, that you would grant us an opportunity just to sing of your praises, to gather together like this and make our stand for you, Lord, to declare that we love you and we believe you and we want to worship you, Lord. For God, you said one time, Lord, to those who are trying to quiet the praises of your people that if they don't praise, the rocks [music] will cry out. But God, we're determined that you'll not have rocks cry out as long as we're here. We will cry out your praises. We will sing of your glory. We will testify of your greatness, Lord. For your word is true, and you ever remain faithful [music] to it, Lord. And you remain faithful to your people and to your promises. And we're here, Lord, to declare that every word is the truth. And we are here, Lord, to testify that you yet live. You are the resurrected Jesus Christ, every bit alive today as you've ever been and working and moving. And we love you for it, Lord. [music] And we count it a privilege to stand here and sing, God. Now, as we turn to your word, we ask that you would come on the scene, Lord, and that your spirit would operate through [music] a gift in a human body, Lord. We don't look to the body, but we look to you, Lord, who can operate through your mechanism. And we're here to hear from you, Lord. Would you come yourself and break the bread of life for us this morning? May you open our eyes. May we see you, Lord, as you as you feed us this morning upon your word. May that word, Lord, take root in our hearts and our souls. And may it bring forth a bountiful harvest for your glory. [music] For we're here, Lord, to manifest this word, not to just be hearers only, but doers, Lord, to make this word live as your spirit lives it through us. We love you and we ask for these things [music] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. Uh musicians, God bless you all. You can take your Bibles. Amen. I just want to welcome a couple visitors this morning. Uh Evangelist John Burns is here with his wife Miriam. God bless you. They're right back here. I met I met this brother yesterday. He popped in here to the church and as quite a testimony, shared it with me for a little over an hour. But he was pastor here of the of the old building, the old church in the 80s. And so I was quite astonished to meet him and and uh he said about seven years in the 80s he had quite a revival uh here in Lima and he pastored there and then he left. He went to Florida the church dissolved and right after that is when we bought it and it became our assembly here. So it was good to meet him. He's got quite a testimony of what the Lord's done with him since then and he's traveled over. So welcome. It's good to have you here with us. And it was really good for me to hear some more background, some history. Amen. and put some of the P puzzle pieces together for me. So, that was good. So, you're very welcome. Also, right in front of them is Brother Paul and Sister Susie Mass from Tennessee. It's good to have you guys with us once again. We always love it when you come up. Also, any other visitors, you're very, very welcome. We're glad that you're here to worship the Lord with us this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. While we're standing, let's turn to the book of James. James chapter 1. James chapter 1 and we're going to start with verse 13. James 1 and13. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God. For God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed. And when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. And sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me over to Genesis chapter 3. Now, Genesis chapter 3 and verse 4. Genesis 3 and 4. And the serpent said unto the woman, "Ye shall not surely die." He had asked her the question about that tree that the Lord had spoke that they were not to partake of. And he asked the question and and she gave the answer. And and he asked, "Did the servant said unto the woman, you shall not surely die." He begins now to contradict the word. She said, "We're not to touch it. Uh we're not to eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die." But he begins to contradict the word. He says, "You shall not surely die. For God doesn't know that in the day that you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be open, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also to her husband with her, and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were open, and they knew that they were naked, and they sowed figly. They sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons. Amen. God bless you as you take your seats and may the Lord bless the word and bless us as we look at his word and give us eyes to see &gt;&gt; and ears to hear. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we look at here in James, if you go ahead and bring up the PowerPoint for me uh for the overhead, I want to minister on the greatest temptation. Many of you know that I ministered up this uh message up in Edmonton. It's the first time I ever preached on it. And uh so some of you have heard this, but it will probably be a little bit different this morning. Uh because it always is. Amen. God's always expounding on the word, and we're always learning more and seeing more. But God began to deal deal with me on this subject about a week before I went up to Edmonton, maybe two weeks, and uh and I preached it up there. But it had such impact on me personally. It was something that uh God began to deal with me on and I I ended up uh uh it gave me such insight into myself and it it opened my eyes to to the greater need that I have. And so even though some of you archived it, some of you watched it. Amen. I just felt in my heart I want to share it with the whole congregation. I know everybody hasn't had a chance to listen. So I want to share it together. So stay with me. Pull on the word. Even if you heard it before, pull extra hard. Amen. especially if you liked it so your brothers and sisters can get their portion too. Amen. &gt;&gt; But but when we talk about the greatest temptation, I found out that the greatest temptation for me is not necessarily the what I thought it would be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we look in James, James says, "Let no man say when he is tempted, I'm tempted of God. For God cannot tempt be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed." &gt;&gt; Amen. So what's causing the temptation? You realize that there's many things that come in life. Amen. There's many opportunities that you have to do wrong. We're surrounded by opportunities to error. &gt;&gt; It's all over. Amen. Everywhere we go, there's sin. There's things that are contrary to the will of God and the desired nature of God. And we can fall into any kind of trap at any time. Amen. But but what is it, Amen, that keeps us from it? Or what is it that causes us to fall? Well, James gives us an insight and the insight is every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed. So he finds out what causes me to fall. Amen. Is something that's inside of me that has a desire for something contrary than the word of God. &gt;&gt; And it there's some things that don't bother me at all. There's some things I'll never be tempted with. It's not an enticement to me because I don't have anything in me that's attracted to that. But when I fall, it's because there was something in me. me. There was a lust in me and I was enticed by that lust in me and I was drawn away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we can't blame anybody else for our failure. There's nobody else to blame. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't pin it on anybody. You say, "Well, the crowd I was with, hey, listen, the crowd you were with was giving an opportunity for something you were lusting for to manifest." &gt;&gt; And lust is not just sexual. Lust is in any strong desire. Amen. Any desire that you have, that's a strong desire. I mean, you can lust for something to eat. You can lust for some material good of the world. You can lust for a car. You can lust for many things. So, don't just think sexual things here. Anything that you're craving with a strong crave. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So, you say, "Well, my parents or my my coworker, but you can't blame anybody else." And James is saying, "Don't pin that on God either." AMEN. IT'S SOMETHING INSIDE of you that was attracted, that was enticed. there was a lust. &gt;&gt; So he says, "But every man is tempted when he has drawn away of his own lust and entice. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. Sin when it is finished bringeth forth death." This is why the new birth is so important. Amen. Because our first birth was wrong. And we came with a sin nature that loved all of these things. So we must be born again to get a new nature, the life of Christ on the inside, the Holy Ghost living in us to change our desires. Cuz when your desires change, you're no longer tempted with the things you were tempted with. &gt;&gt; Why is it THAT BEFORE YOU WOULD never be able to walk down a certain street? Amen. You were tempted whether it was alcohol or drugs or or sexual things or or perversion, but you were there was places you could not go because anytime you got near there, there was like a magnetic draw to you pulling you to it. But when God converted you and changed you and washed you up and delivered you from those spirits and filled you with his spirit, AMEN, THAT THING DOESN'T HAVE THE MAGNETIC pull on you that it once had. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's the power of God to deliver us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God has to change change us at the core of who we are. We have to become a new creature in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean we're no longer tempted. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. that we're constantly being tempted. Amen. But but the temptation to me starts to change. And we start to look at what becomes the most deceptive kind of temptation. And that's what I want to begin to look at. We know as we look at the word here that Eve was tempted. She had the word of the Lord. The word of the Lord that was given to her said, "Don't eat. Don't partake of this tree. Everything else is free to you to enjoy. But this is one thing that's off limits. &gt;&gt; And it seems as though she never really paid much attention to the tree. This is just reading through the scriptures because then the serpent, amen, begins who's anointed of the devil begins to entice her with questions and he says, "Did not the Lord does did the Lord say that if you eat that, you're not to eat of it?" and and she begins to say, "Well, he said this and he said that." And then the servant says, "But you'll not surely die." That's not exactly the way it's going to happen. Amen. But but God doth know that in the day you eat thereof, your eyes shall be open. Amen. You'll become as gods, knowing good and evil. Amen. And and he began to contradict the word, but he began to tell her, "Amen. It's not exactly like that, but the the the real thing is God's trying to keep you from something. There's something more that you can have and and it's a good thing. And and and if you if you have this, it'll be greater and you'll understand more. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. And then then it says in verse six, "And the woman saw that the tree was good for food." She hadn't seen that before. &gt;&gt; She had in the scripture reading, she hadn't seen that before. She knew she knew it was there. Amen. She was told not to to to partake of it. She left it alone until this enticing thought came along. And the serpent began to work on her reasoning and begin to get her to look at the tree in a different way. Amen. And begin to find out that if you'll partake of this, Amen. Your understanding will grow and you'll BECOME LIKE A GOD. AMEN. And this is what God knows and this is what God's preventing you from. And then she looked at the tree and it was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise. When she looked at those three things, there's nothing in the scripture that tells us that those three things are untrue. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It may be every bit true that it was good for food, a tree to be desired, a a a pleasant to the eyes, and to be desired to make one wise. Amen. God didn't tell her not to partake of the tree because of those things. He told her not to partake of it. He had something else in mind. He knew where that would lead. &gt;&gt; But the devil got her to reason about it. And when her reasoning, she began to consider the commandment of the Lord in a different light. And when she considered it in a different light, she began TO SAY, "WELL, IT DOES look nice and it does look like it's good for food and and it will, you know, MAKE ONE WISE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT ANYHOW? And she partakes and gives to her husband and he partakes. And the Bible [clears throat] says this in in uh Genesis 3:13. And the Lord God said unto the woman, "What is this that thou has done?" And the woman said, "The serpent begoured me, and I did eat." The the word begiled means to be deceived. &gt;&gt; The woman WAS DECEIVED. SHE THOUGHT she was actually doing something good. When the reasoning powers kicked in and she began to look at the tree AND SEE ALL THE POSITIVE benefits of it and all the beauty and all the wisdom and all the things, she began to think, well, this is right anyways. This is the right thing to do. And she was deceived into falling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in 1 Timothy 2:14, it said, "And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression." Amen. Adam knew what he was doing. He did wrong intentionally to save his wife. But she didn't know she was doing wrong. Amen. She was deceived into doing wrong because she considered the tree which she should have never considered. &gt;&gt; Here's what the prophet of God tells us. He says, "And that's what's the matter today. The sleeping virgin staying long enough to get part of the word, but not all of the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The deceived church stays long enough to get part of the word, but not all the word. And they were sincere and honest about it. Eve was deceived. She was deceived. Adam was not deceived. Adam knew exactly he was doing wrong. But his wife doing the things that she was doing persuaded him to partake of the forbidden. Why? He was a man. See, and it was so to him that he understood. He you understand. See, he knowed he was doing wrong. But Eve thought she was doing right. &gt;&gt; He says it this way in another message. Now, Satan, this deceiver spoke of in Matthew 24:24 with so much deceit. Now we find that by his gospel programs of knowledge, better education, higher ethics, civilization and so forth has bewitched the people that wants to serve God into believing his lie. Eve did not want to do that. But he showed her how it was more wisdom in it. She didn't know. She wanted to know. I want you to I want to highlight this. She wanted to know. &gt;&gt; She didn't understand. She wanted to understand. AND GOD TOLD HER NOT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND. God didn't give her a word to understand. He gave her a commandment to keep her safe. AMEN. TO PROTECT her from this danger that was laying there. Amen. But she there was See, she was enticed when she was led away of her own lust. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T KNOW, BUT SHE WANTED TO KNOW. And we began to tell her, "There's more. Your eyes will open. You'll be like a God. You'll understand." And she began to consider. AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT, BUT SHE WANTED to know. He was working on a LUST THAT WAS INSIDE of her. Amen. And she wanted to understand. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he had to work on something that was inside of her. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And 1 John 2:15-17 says, "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. [clears throat] For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the world passes away, and the lust thereof. But he that doeth the will of God abideth forever. &gt;&gt; Who abides forever? He that does the will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the will of God? This is the will of God. &gt;&gt; He's given us his will when he gave us his word. This is his will. And he that doeth the will of God abideth forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. She left the will of God and took her own will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And she was deceived into it. She thought she was doing good. For all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. She was tempted with three things. That the tree was good for food, pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise. She was tested with the things that are in the world. &gt;&gt; The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. Amen. And I've said this before, but I'll say it again. This is what's in the world. &gt;&gt; This is what's worldly. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE TRY NOT to be worldly. We don't want to be worldly. We're Christians. We're sanctified. We're set apart and separated from the world and to service unto the Lord. Amen. But what is the world? We call the world drinking, smoking, carousing, committing adultery, and all these other things. All the debauchery, murder, violence that's of the world. Listen, BY THE TIME YOU GET THERE, you're so far REMOVED FROM THE GOSPEL. AMEN. BUT WHAT STARTED down that path, the world, all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. And I say this, you can be in the world and worldly and sit in your seat every Sunday and Wednesday. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE CHURCH TO BE IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN BE IN THE world and be in church. YOU CAN BE DRESSED RIGHT AND LOOK RIGHT AND ACT RIGHT AND DO RIGHT. BUT IF YOU'RE DEALING, AMEN, with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, and you're giving over to those things, and you're and you're you're YIELDING TO THAT, THAT'S OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; I'LL ASK YOU THIS. THE Pharisees &gt;&gt; in the days that Jesus was on earth, the Pharisees, Amen. Who were they? WERE THEY GODLY or were they worldly? They didn't look worldly. They didn't act worldly. AMEN. THEY PUT ON a a pretense. THEY HAD A FACADE that they were godly. Amen. They were reverent. THEY WERE PIOUS. AMEN. THEY WENT TO CHURCH. They did everything that they were supposed to do. But Jesus could look through ALL OF THAT AND SAID THEIR HEARTS are corrupted. &gt;&gt; They were doing those things for the wrong reason. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when I looked at the greatest temptation, I began to say this. I'm just going to I wrote it down. So, I'll just read it this way. The greatest temptation for a child of God is not to do something evil, but to do something good for the wrong reasons. &gt;&gt; Or to do something that's right, but not according to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; I'm going to repeat that a couple more times throughout this because I believe it's so important &gt;&gt; because the greatest temptation to e, you know, the woman wasn't trying to do wrong. The woman wasn't seeking out wickedness, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; She was deceived into thinking that actually this was the right thing to do and this would bring about the promise of God to multiply and replenish the earth and this is the way to do it and this is wisdom and this is right and this is beauty and it'll be a blessing. Amen. She was deceived trying to do SOMETHING RIGHT BUT NOT ACCORDING TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; And why did she do that? Because there WAS SOMETHING INSIDE OF HER THAT WANTED to know, that wanted to understand. There was a lust for knowledge in her. And he was telling her, "This is the way that you get it." And then she saw those three things that appealed to the world. The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life. AND SHE FELL for it. &gt;&gt; Not trying to BE WICKED. SHE FELL FOR IT TRYING TO DO WHAT WAS RIGHT, &gt;&gt; TRYING TO BRING ABOUT THE WORD, BUT SHE WAS TRYING TO PERFORM THE WORD AND BRING ABOUT THE PROMISE according to her will and not GOD'S WILL BECAUSE GOD'S will is his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his word said, "Don't partake." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'll read that again. The greatest temptation for a child of God is not to do something evil, but to do something good for the wrong reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or to do something right, but not according to the word. &gt;&gt; We're going to look through the scriptures and we're going to we're going to see this as we go. When when Adam and his wife fell, immediately they made fig leaves for themselves. &gt;&gt; Fig leaves to cover their sin, to cover their nakedness, an apron of fig leaves to cover the affected area of sin because their sin was sexual in nature. And they covered their they covered their sin. And they they put on the fig leaves, which is a type of religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's what the Pharisees had put on to cover their lustful heart. Amen. They put on a cloak of religion. That's what man has always done. He's always put on a religion to try to hide his sin nature and try to be right. Amen. By by covering sin. Amen. You can't cover sin. It has to be atoned for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so they put on the fig LEAVES AND NO DOUBT THEY WERE SOMEWHAT SATISFIED WITH their religion. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And their religion was somewhat satisfying because they were moving on. Amen. With their aprons of fig leaves covering their nakedness and and they were they were uh uh in fellowship until their religion worked until they heard the voice voice of the Lord &gt;&gt; walking in the cool of the evening. And when they heard his voice because his voice is his word. When they heard his voice, amen, they hid themselves for they realized they were naked. Amen. WHEN WHEN GOD SAYS, "ADAM, WHERE ARE THOU?" ADAM SAYS, "I hid myself BECAUSE I WAS NAKED." AMEN. TECHNICALLY, he wasn't naked. He was still wearing his fig leaf. But in the PRESENCE OF GOD, THAT RELIGION WAS NOTHING. &gt;&gt; He was bare. He was bare and laid BARE BEFORE GOD. AND FRIENDS, TODAY WE are laid bare before GOD. THE ONLY CLOAK for our sin is the blood OF JESUS CHRIST THAT WASHES it away. To be clothed IN THE WORD, COVERED IN HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS IS THE only thing that will COVER US. RELIGION WON'T DO IT. THE VOICE OF GOD PIERCES THROUGH RELIGION and exposes nakedness. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want TO I WANT MY SINS TO BE WASHED AWAY BY THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST. And I WANT TO BE CLOTHED IN his righteousness. I be shielded with his word, walking in his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the will of God abideth forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. The world passes away and all the lust, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life, it all vanish. &gt;&gt; May he endureth the will of God abideth &gt;&gt; forever. Praise God. Isn't God good? &gt;&gt; So glad he's provided his word for us in this generation. He's restored the word. Amen. Was lost through the dark ages, but brought back through a prophetic ministry in the end time to bring us back to the truth of this Bible. Amen. So the bride can be clothed in his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not religion, not fig leaves, not man-made ideas, &gt;&gt; but the puress of his word. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Man, let's turn together to Matthew chapter 4. Matthew chapter 4. verse one. This is Jesus's temptation in the wilderness. Matthew chapter 4 verse one. [snorts] Just before chapter 4 is his baptism in Jordan where the Holy Spirit descends like a dove out of heaven and rest upon him. And then it says in verse uh chapter 4:1, "Then was Jesus led up of the spirit unto the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. And when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights, he was afterward hungered." Jesus was hungry, &gt;&gt; very hungry, &gt;&gt; and when the tempter came to him, he said, "If thou be the son of God, command these stones to be made bread." But he answered and said, "Is it it is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the devil taketh him up into a holy city, and setth him on the pinnacle of the temple, and saith to him, "If thou be the son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written, he shall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone." And Jesus said unto him, "It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." Again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, and saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down, and worship me. Then said Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the devil leaveth him, and behold, angels came and ministered unto him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus now in the great temptation in the wilderness comes face to face with the devil. And the devil begins to lay temptation to temptation. And there's three temptations. And the three temptations correspond to the scriptures that we just read. &gt;&gt; And then let's go back and and and look at 1 John 2. For all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. And this is what Jesus contends with and overcomes in the wilderness. He was hungry. The lust of the flesh, he was hungry. And he and then he says, "If thou be the son of God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; If thou be the son of God, make these stones into bread." And then you you ask yourself, what what's wrong with that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He is the son of God, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the son of God and he was hungry and HE HAD ALL POWER TO DO IT. AMEN. And so you think he was being tempted, listen, he was being tempted not to do something evil because there's nothing evil about turning stones INTO BREAD. IN FACT, HE WAS BEING challenged to identify himself as the son OF GOD. WHAT WOULD BE WRONG WITH PROVING to Satan he was who he said he was? Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see, THE TEMPTATION WAS NOT TO do something evil, BUT THE TEMPTATION was to do something of his own will, not according to the will OF GOD. BECAUSE GOD NEVER TOLD HIM TO TURN THOSE stones &gt;&gt; into bread. For him to EXERCISE HIS OWN WILL, AMEN. WOULD HAVE BEEN GOING OUTSIDE the will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, it wasn't evil that Jesus was being tempted with. It was to do something good, but to do it for himself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; To serve his own flesh. And then he was taken up on the on the pinnacle of the the temple and he was told in verse six, he said, "Cast thyself down, for it is written." [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Now he's quoting to him the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Don't you THINK THE DEVIL CAN'T quote the scriptures? The devil can quote the scriptures. He has it memorized. And listen, he said, "He shall give his angels charge concerning thee." Oh, I love this. And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time they dash thy foot against a stone. He's reading out of the book of Psalms. And the devil is quoting this scripture accurately. &gt;&gt; He's not twisting THE WORDS. HE'S NOT MANIPULATING the meaning. He's giving you an accurate, verbatim, word by word &gt;&gt; uh repeating of the scriptures. HE'S QUOTING THE SCRIPTURE ACCURATELY, &gt;&gt; but he's trying to get Jesus once again TO TAKE THE PRIDE OF LIFE TO PROVE WHO HE is &gt;&gt; because it he says, "Listen, if you're THE SON OF GOD, IT'S WRITTEN ABOUT THE SON OF GOD. HEY, HE'S NOT GOING TO DASH HIS FOOT AGAINST THE STONE. THE ANGELS HAVE CHARGE over him. Listen, cast yourself down and prove this scripture." &gt;&gt; AND WHAT'S WRONG WITH PROVING THE WORD IS TRUE? HE WASN'T BEING ASKED, AMEN, TO DO SOMETHING WICKED. HE WASN'T DO asked him to do something evil. HE WAS BEING ASKED TO PROVE THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we getting it? &gt;&gt; But that would have been to identify himself &gt;&gt; and to prove himself. &gt;&gt; God never told him to do that. &gt;&gt; That's right. And then he taketh him up on an exceeding high mountain. Mountains always type of a kingdom in the Bible. Shows him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them. And he saith unto him, "All these things will I give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me." Listen, Jesus was the king of the world. &gt;&gt; He was to come into the kingdom, the throne of David, to rule and reign over all of the earth. And that's where he was going to come to bring a righteous reign according to the word of God. And what the devil was offering him was a shortcut to his destination. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not to do evil, but to do good. &gt;&gt; You can be you can go ahead AND BECOME KING OF ALL THE WORLD, ALL THE EARTH, AND YOU CAN SET THE KINGDOM UP. YOU CAN GO TO THE THRONE of David. You can set it up in righteous rule. But he would have had to bypass the word because the word declared there had to be a lamb of God to pay the price for the sins of the world. He would have went WITHOUT REDEMPTION PRICE PAID. HE WOULD HAVE WENT OUTSIDE the will of God. HE WOULD HAVE GOT TO THE DESTINATION, BUT HE WOULDN'T HAVE COME THROUGH THE PATH OF THE word &gt;&gt; and offered him the pride of life. And Jesus overcame all three temptations that the woman failed by, that Eve failed by in the Garden of Eden. He overcame them in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; But it's also worth noting, how did he overcome them? Amen. &gt;&gt; By the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God, Brother Bam, tells us, he says he didn't use any OF HIS POWERS. HE HAD THEM ALL. HE DIDN'T USE ANY OF HIS GIFTS. HE HAD THEM ALL. He didn't use any of his great intellect. He didn't use any of that. What he simply used was, "Thus sayaeth the Lord. Thus sayeth the Lord, it is written. It is written." HE COMBED THE DEVIL NOT WITH WISDOM, NOT WITH REASONING. THIS IS WHERE EVE GOT INTO TROUBLE. SHE BEGAN TO REASON with him and consider what THE DEVIL WAS SAYING. JESUS NEVER CONSIDERED WHAT HE SAID. HE JUST WENT TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; But the WORD SAYS THIS, BUT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THIS, BUT THE LORD SAYS THIS. &gt;&gt; AND THE THE DEVIL WAS USING THE WORD, TOO. BUT JESUS KNEW THE PROPER APPLICATION OF THE WORD FOR HIS DAY AND SEASON. HE KNEW THE HOUR HE WAS LIVING, AND HE KNEW HIS PURPOSE UPON THE EARTH. AND HE KNEW WHAT SCRIPTURES APPLIED AND WHAT SCRIPTURES DIDN'T APPLY. AND THOSE SCRIPTURES WERE TRYING TO GET HIM TO PROVE HIMSELF. AND HE WASN'T THERE TO PROVE HIMSELF. HE WAS THERE TO MAGNIFY GOD. HE WAS THERE TO TESTIFY OF A LIVING GOD AND BE GOD ON the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; He was there to show the father. &gt;&gt; So he wasn't there to prove himself. God would vindicate him and back him up. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we when we look at all of this, we begin to realize the great the great temptation is not to go to a bar and get drunk. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because as we're serving the Lord, God has freed us from those things. God has delivered us from those. Those at one point were our temptations. And and if it's still your temptation, AMEN, CRY OUT TO GOD. HE'LL deliver you. &gt;&gt; HIS SPIRIT WILL WASH YOU. NEW BIRTH WILL MAKE YOU A NEW CREATURE until those desires just fade away. Right. &gt;&gt; BUT FOR FOR US WHO ARE SERVING THE LORD, THOSE who've been born again by his spirit. Amen. We're walking in this LIFE WITH A DESIRE TO serve God, being freed OF SO MANY THINGS, but it doesn't mean we're not going to be tempted. Jesus, after he was filled with the Holy Ghost at the river, was tempted of the devil. &gt;&gt; We're going to be tempted. AMEN. BUT WE GOT TO QUIT THINKING, "As long as I'm not drinking, as long as I'm not smoking, as long as I'm not doing drugs, as long as I'm not fornicating, as long as I'm not looking at pornography, I'M NOT SINNING. I'M NOT IN ERROR." AMEN. We're in danger every day of our lives. AMEN. BECAUSE THE WORLD IS ALL AROUND US. AMEN. Because the things that are in the world is the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We still have this old sticky cockleburn nature. Amen. that sometimes wants to prove itself, &gt;&gt; to serve itself, to magnify itself. &gt;&gt; We got to keep this body A BASE. LIKE PAUL SAID, I I beat my body. Keep it in subjection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Men, we have to realize where temptation's coming and what it's for. Jesus wasn't being temp tempted with a woman. &gt;&gt; He wasn't being tempted with drugs. He was being tempted with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And all of it had a religious tone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If thou be the son of God, &gt;&gt; if thou be, it was all very religious and all around the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "Eve was deceived. She saw part of the word. Moab was deceived. The sleeping virgin was deceived. The church is deceived. The denominations are deceived. See, stay with the word. That's the only way. Stay right with it. Don't move from any of it. Stay right with it. Go right on what God said do. No matter what anybody else says, keep God's line. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the Leodysian church age, he says, "A quick look at these scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition." In Matthew 4, wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil, he overcame the personal temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only. That's right. &gt;&gt; And each of the three major trials that correspond exactly to the temptation of the garden Eden, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life, Jesus overcame by the word. Eve fell to the personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adam fell in direct disobedience to the word. But Jesus overcame by the word. &gt;&gt; And right now, let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer. Also, it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because the word can't fail. &gt;&gt; Listen, this is so good. I love this so much. AMEN. WHAT WOULD IT taken for Eve to overcome in the Garden of Eden? All she would have to SAY IS, "GOD HATH SAID, don't touch. Don't take and eat OF THAT TREE." THAT'S ALL SHE HAS TO DO. YEAH. &gt;&gt; SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE POWER. SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE SKILL. SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE WISDOM. She doesn't have to have might. She doesn't HAVE TO HAVE ANYTHING. ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS REPEAT WHAT GOD SAID ABOUT WHAT THE serpent's speaking TO HER ABOUT. AND THAT'S IT. &gt;&gt; NOT ADD HER OWN THOUGHT. NOT ADD HER OWN OPINION. AMEN. NOT SAY IT IN HOSTILITY. AMEN. NOT NOT CAST THE DEVIL INTO OBLIVION. ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS JUST SAY WHAT GOD SAID. AND SHE would have had victory over that trial. &gt;&gt; Amen. and she WOULD HAVE JUST STAYED WITH THE SIMPLICITY OF the tree that's in the midst of the garden. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't eat of it. &gt;&gt; SIMPLE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S ALL SHE HAS TO DO. AND WHEN JESUS RESISTED THE DEVIL WITH THE WORD, AMEN. When he resisted, THE DEVIL LEFT HIM. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THE DEVIL CAN'T FIGHT THE WORD. THE DEVIL CAN OUTREASON YOU. HE CAN OUTTHINK YOU. HE CAN OUTWEIGHT YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT HE CANNOT FIGHT THE WORD OF GOD. THE WORD OF GOD IS ETERNAL. THE WORD OF GOD IS STEADFAST. IT'S A ROCK OF FOUNDATION THAT WE BUILD OUR HOUSE UPON. AND THE STORMS AND THE WAVES CANNOT BEAT it down. &gt;&gt; Everything else is an idea, IS A THOUGHT, is reasoning of man. &gt;&gt; And it will all crumble. &gt;&gt; But Jesus overcame by the word. Did he have power? Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did he had gifts? Yes. &gt;&gt; Why didn't he use any of those gifts? because he was demonstrating to you and I THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO OVERCOME THE DEVIL IN EVERY TEMPTATION, in every trial, IN EVERY TACTIC OF THE ENEMY. ALL WE HAVE to do is say, "Thus sayeth the Lord, it is written." &gt;&gt; That's our defense, friends. &gt;&gt; That's the wall that we stay behind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is the word of God. John chapter 1 it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life and the life was the light of men. This is referring to Jesus Christ. In verse 14 it says, "And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory, the glory of as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth." Who is Jesus Christ? He is the word. He is the word that was made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we stick WITH THE WORD, WE STICK WITH THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So what does it mean to leave the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the word. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Let's look at this scripture. Matthew chapter 7 verse 21. Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? And in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works. And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you. Depart from me, ye that work iniquity. &gt;&gt; You guys see this statement here? Ye that work iniquity. Why did he cast them out? Because of their iniquitous works. &gt;&gt; Listen, they've come to the white throne judgment. Nobody at the white throne judgment is lying. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Nobody's standing in the presence of God and making things up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Nobody's trying to pull the wool over Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, he said, "Many will say to me that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name?" Jesus never denied that they didn't do it. &gt;&gt; I believe they did. &gt;&gt; Cuz nobody's standing in the face of Jesus, Jud, supreme judge of heavens and earth, and lying to him. &gt;&gt; And in thy name have cast out devils. &gt;&gt; I believe they did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in thy name done many wonderful works. &gt;&gt; Many wonderful works. I believe they did it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't deny any of it. Neither did he judge them for that. Neither were they cast out for any of that. &gt;&gt; He says, "But depart from me, ye that work iniquity." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Iniquity is when you know to do right and don't do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHY did Jesus say, "Depart from me. You you you that work iniquity." Iniquity was not prophesying in his name. was not casting out devils and was not the wonderful works. &gt;&gt; That was not the iniquity. &gt;&gt; The iniquity was something of the word of God they knew to do and didn't do it. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; they were iniquitous. &gt;&gt; They and they did miracles. They did signs and wonders. They did many wonders. And they prophesied in his name. And no doubt people were healed, &gt;&gt; right? And devils were cast out. &gt;&gt; And maybe many people believed on the Lord through their works. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT JUDAS DID. JUDAS WENT OUT WHEN GOD commissioned them to go two by two. Judas went with them. AND THEY ALL COME BACK AND SAID, "THIS THE DEVILS WERE SUBJECT TO US. WE CAST OUT DEVILS and healed THE SICK AND AND AND AND Jesus says, "Oh, that's wonderful. BUT DON'T REJOICE THAT the devils ARE SUBJECT TO YOU. JOYCE rejoice that your names are written in heaven." But later, Judas would turn his back on Jesus, deny him, and sell him out. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He worked iniquity. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; HE DENIED THE WORD. HE DENIED THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. BUT HE CAST OUT DEVILS AND HE HEALED THE SICK AND HE did many wonderful works. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So listen friends, LET'S BRING THIS HOME TO US. AMEN. WE CAN DO ALL KINDS OF WONDERFUL THINGS. AMEN. BUT IF WE KNOW THE WORD SAYS DO SOMETHING AND WE DON'T DO IT, AMEN. THAT IS INIQUITY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be found in iniquity, but I want to be found in his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So, what was the judgment for? Knowing to do right and not doing it. &gt;&gt; Knowing the word and not obeying the word. &gt;&gt; Let's turn to 1st Samuel together. I want to look at this in 1st Samuel 15. We're going to look at the life of Saul, the first king of Israel. 1st Samuel 15 and 13. [snorts] 1st Samuel 15 and verse 13. And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said unto him, "Blessed be thou of the Lord. I have performed the commandment of the Lord. So there was a commandment given to Saul from Samuel from God to Samuel the prophet from the prophet to Saul the king. And that word was go and destroy the Amalachites. And the word was to utterly destroy the Amalachites. &gt;&gt; Every man, woman, child, boy, girl, sheep, goat, &gt;&gt; chicken, &gt;&gt; everything. &gt;&gt; Says spare nothing. And why? Because because the the scripture tells us when when God rescued his children out of Egypt and they were first come along the way. Amen. THEY WERE AMBUSHED AND ATTACKED BY THE Amalachites for no reason. And God DESTROYED THEM. BUT GOD MADE A PROMISE. I'LL NEVER FORGET WHAT THE Amalachites did to my children along the way. IT WAS AN UNPROVOKED ATTACK for no reason whatsoever. And God promised he would wipe them off the map. Now it's time for God to KEEP HIS WORD. THAT WAS A prophecy through Moses. that word has to come to pass. Now, there's another prophet, amen, that's telling Saul, this is the time for the word of the Lord to come TO PASS. AND SAUL receives the word of the Lord from a prophet, rehearsing what another prophet, Moses said, God said. &gt;&gt; This is the word of the Lord. And the word OF THE LORD IS TO UTTERLY DESTROY THE AMALACHITES and leave nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is what Saul says. Saul says, Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto him, "Blessed be thou of the Lord, I have performed the commandment of the Lord." And Samuel said, 'What meanest then this bleeding of the sheep in my ears, and the loing of the oxen which I hear? And Saul said, "They have brought them from," I love this. They &gt;&gt; He takes no responsibility. They have brought them from the Amalachites, for the people spared the best of the sheep out of the oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God. And the rest we have utterly destroyed. Saul is standing here. Oh my goodness. He claims that he's obeyed the word, but the word was specific. &gt;&gt; Utterly destroyed. Listen, 90% of obedience is not obedience. &gt;&gt; 95% OBEDIENCE IS not obedience. And here Saul saying, "I obeyed the commandment of the Lord." And what he did by his disobedience, listen, he broke the word because THERE WAS A PROPHECY come through Moses, a promise that he would destroy THE AMALACHITES. AND GOD ALWAYS WORKS through man. And God is using this man to perform the word. It's more than just his own choice. It's more than just him doing something, amen, OF HIS OWN THINKING. HE'S ACTUALLY BREAKING THE WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE'S ACTUALLY CAUSING THE THE WORD NOT TO COME TO FULFILLMENT. AMEN. AND THIS IS WHAT ANGERS THE LORD SO MUCH. AMEN. IS BECAUSE HE'S BREAKING THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; THIS ISN'T A SMALL MATTER. WELL, WE JUST SAVED WE JUST SAVED A little bit of this and WE JUST SAVED ONE MAN ALIVE, THE KING. WE JUST WE DIDN'T WE LISTEN, WE UTTERLY DESTROYED EVERYTHING, BUT WE JUST SAVED THESE little things. Listen, THOSE LITTLE THINGS WERE CONTRARY TO THE WORD OF GOD. AND GOD IS HIS WORD, AND YOU CANNOT BREAK THE WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And so he says they I love this. &gt;&gt; They This is like the Garden of Eden. Amen. He he asked Adam what happened. The wife thou gavest me. &gt;&gt; Listen, you just said she was bone of your bone and flesh of your flesh. SHE'S PART OF YOU. Don't don't give me that. He comes to the woman and she says WITH THE SERPENT BEG, IT'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY ELSE. NOBODY'S WILLING TO TAKE PERSONAL responsibility for their own actions. And here is here is SAUL SAYING THEY. AND I WOULD ASK SAUL, "WHO'S THE KING? &gt;&gt; DON'T GIVE ME THEY." IT'S LIKE A FATHER IN THE HOUSE. HIS HOUSE IS IN DISORDER. AND HE SAYS, "WELL, THEY LISTEN. YOU'RE THE DAD. GET YOUR HOME IN ORDER. &gt;&gt; They they they. AMEN. IT'S WHAT YOU'VE ALLOWED. SAUL ALLOWED IT." &gt;&gt; SO there's no blaming somebody else. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Saul in verse 15 says they have saved and listen they spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen and the rest to to sacrifice unto the Lord. They had a religious cloak &gt;&gt; for their own lust. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This was a dangerous temptation. &gt;&gt; This was a very dangerous temptation. This was a great temptation. to do something that seemed right &gt;&gt; but for the wrong reasons. &gt;&gt; What's wrong with saving the best animals to sacrifice the Lord? We're going to worship. No, because God didn't tell you to do that. &gt;&gt; God told you to destroy them. You're you're exerting your own will for your own lust for your own reason and you're exerting your will over the will of God. That's wickedness. &gt;&gt; It doesn't look wicked. It looks religious. But that religion was just a cloak for the lust of their own flesh. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We'll read this and find it out as we go on. He says verse 16, "And Samuel said unto Saul, stay." He's saying, "Hold still, and I will tell thee what the Lord has said to me this night." And he said unto him, "Say on." And Samuel said, "When thou was little in thine own sight, was thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel." And the Lord anointed thee king over Israel. And the Lord sent thee on a journey and said, "Go and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalachites, and fight against them until they be consumed. Wherefore then did thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but did fly upon the spoil and did evil in the sight of the Lord?" &gt;&gt; God is cutting through his religious fig leaves &gt;&gt; and exposing his nakedness. You wanted the best of the sheep and the best. Don't give me that. You might have made a trivial token offering to the Lord, but you were trying to fly upon the spoil. The spoil is THE REWARD OF BATTLE, NOT FOR THE LORD, BUT FOR HIMSELF. AND God could see through his religious rhetoric. &gt;&gt; And guess what, friends? IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW GOOD WE ARE AT repeating words and quoting the prophet and re reading scriptures. God can see through our religious rhetoric. If it's just rhetoric and not coming from the depths OF OUR SOUL, GOD KNOWS IT'S JUST A FIG leaf to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; He said ah he said wherefore verse 19 did thou obey the voice of the Lord but did fly upon the spoil and did evil in the sight of the Lord. And Saul said unto Samuel, "Yay, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord." He's trying to argue again. &gt;&gt; I did what the word said. Yay, I obeyed the voice of the Lord. and have gone the way which the Lord sent me, and have brought Aag, the king of the of Amalecch, and have utterly destroyed the Amalachites. But the people took of the spoil. Who's the king? &gt;&gt; Don't become a weakling. &gt;&gt; You were in charge. But the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice [laughter] unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal. And Samuel said, "Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idul. Because the Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; WHY DID SAUL LOSE HIS POSITION? Because he left the word. &gt;&gt; HE REJECTED THE BIBLE. GOD SAID, "YOU REJECTED THE WORD." &gt;&gt; HE THOUGHT HE WAS JUST MASSAGING THE WORD. &gt;&gt; HE THOUGHT HE WAS JUST USING some reasoning, AND IN REASONING, WHY let all these wonderful uh wonderful beasts GO TO WASTE? WHY DON'T WE TAKE SOME AND SACRIFICE THEM TO THE LORD? AND NO DOUBT, SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO HIM. WHY DON'T WE SAVE THE BEST OF THE sheep and the best of the oxen? Amen. And he WOULD HAVE SAID, "OH, OKAY." BECAUSE HE SAID, "THEY said and and he gave him permission." BUT BUT BUT GOD SAID, "WHY DID YOU FLY UPON THE SPOIL? WHAT WAS IN YOUR LUSTFUL HEART? WHAT WERE YOU GREEDY FOR? WHY WERE YOU MAKING political moves with the people to APPEASE THEM? WHY WEREN'T YOU STAYING WITH MY WORD?" &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, wasn't it was the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the PRIDE OF LIFE THAT GOT HIM. IT'S WHAT GOT EVERY ONE OF US. IT'S WHAT STILL GETS US. AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's the world and the things of the world. Amen. That got him. And he HAD A RELIGIOUS CLOAK AND HE WAS DOING THE WORD OF GOD. AND HE WAS IN THE SERVICE OF GOD AS THE KING OF GOD'S PEOPLE RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THE CAMP OF GOD DOING WHAT GOD HAD ASKED HIM. BUT HE DID IT TO 95%. AND THERE WAS SOMETHING in him and something in the people that WOULD KEEP THEM FROM GOING ALL THE WAY WITH THE WORD. AND THAT IS WHEN THEY REJECTED THE LORD. And the Lord rejected him. &gt;&gt; SAID, "GOD, HELP ME. I DON'T WANT 95%. I WANT 100%. I WANT TO YIELD MYSELF ABSOLUTELY TO THIS WORD OF GOD. I DON'T WANT TO TWIST IT AND MASSAGE IT FOR MY OWN PURPOSE. I SAY, "GOD, HELP ME. EXPOSE ME TO ME." &gt;&gt; EXPOSE THAT OLD NATURE THAT WANTS TO GRAB AND BRIDE AND THAT WANTS TO LOOK GOOD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT'S CAUSING US TO FAIL, FRIENDS, IS THAT DESIRE TO LOOK GOOD IN THE EYES OF OTHER PEOPLE. THAT DESIRE, THAT CRAVING TO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE. AMEN. THAT WE WANT. AMEN. IF IT'S CONTRARY TO THE WORD OF GOD, LET THE CRAVING DIE. &gt;&gt; Let it die. &gt;&gt; Oh God, let me die to myself. This is why the Apostle Paul says, "I die daily." &gt;&gt; Why did he have TO DIE DAILY? WHY DID HE HAVE TO KEEP UNDER his body to keep it in submission? That means to beat it bat, black and blue. Why did he have to do that? BECAUSE THE OLD STICKY COCKER NATURE, THE LUST of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, THE PRIDE OF LIFE. PAUL WAS CONTENDING WITH PAUL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. God help us to contend with ourselves. &gt;&gt; To keep the word of God. &gt;&gt; I [snorts] want to look in contrast at David. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; From Saul to David. Acts 13:22 says, "And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king, to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfill all my will." &gt;&gt; And in the book of Samuel, uh, when the book of Samuel, it stops here. He says, 'Ive found David, the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart.' But now when Stephen repeats this, when he's going to be stoned, he's in the Sanhedrin, and he's preaching to them the Bible, he adds this line, which shall fulfill all my will. What does it mean to be a man after God's own heart? &gt;&gt; One that will fulfill his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. David was a man after God's own heart. Saul was not. &gt;&gt; Listen, Saul did many things God told him to do. &gt;&gt; Saul had many victories. He led the army of the Lord into many battles and he won many victories and he did many things, but he didn't fully obey the word. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm going to raise up somebody after my own heart." What does it mean to be after God's own heart? To fulfill all his will. &gt;&gt; What is his will? His word is his will. &gt;&gt; And listen, David wasn't a perfect human being. &gt;&gt; We all know of his sin with Basheba. &gt;&gt; We all know of his failure and his sin and the trying to cover it up and having Uzziah murdered and all the things that he did in that whole orchestra. So to me, when I look at this statement, I realize to be a man after God's own heart doesn't mean I have to be a perfect human being. because I'm not a perfect human being and it doesn't mean I'll never have failure in my life because I'm I will have failure in my life. I have failure constantly in my life. So to be a man after God's own heart doesn't mean I have to have perfect performance. &gt;&gt; Because David didn't have perfect performance, but he was a man after God's own heart. But when David fell and the prophet came to him with the word of the Lord and gave him the story and says, "And you're the man." There was something in David that could say, "I have sinned before the Lord." He didn't say, "Well, Ba Sheba shouldn't have been on a rooftop and she should have pulled the curtains and if they would have just done WHAT I SAID." NO, THERE WAS NONE OF THAT. &gt;&gt; THIS WAS A MAN AFTER GOD'S OWN HEART WHEN HE HAD FINALLY TO COME FACE TO FACE with the word AND THE WORD EXPOSED ALL OF HIS FIG LEAVES AND ALL OF HIS HIDING AND ALL OF HIS COMPROMISING. And when the word of the prophet family came to him and exposed HIM, HE SAID, "I HAVE SINNED BEFORE THE LORD. IT'S ME. I DID IT. I'M GUILTY. I'M WRONG. &gt;&gt; And immediately the prophet said, "And God has forgiven you of your sins." &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. HE DIDN'T LISTEN. GOD HAD FOUND A MAN AFTER HIS OWN HEART. WHAT IS A MAN AFTER his own heart? One that will do his will. What is his will? It's his word. Amen. To be after GOD'S OWN HEART. IS TO LOVE HIS word more than you love your feelings, MORE THAN YOU LOVE YOUR PLEASURES, MORE THAN YOU LOVE YOUR STATUS AND YOUR POSITION AND YOUR IMAGE. BUT TO LOVE GOD IS TO LOVE HIS WORD. TO LOVE HIS WORD IS TO love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT THAT SAUL DIDN'T LOVE HIM. SAUL LOVED HIMSELF MORE. &gt;&gt; THIS HAS BEEN THE CHALLENGE ALL THROUGH THE BIBLE. IT WASN'T THAT THE PEOPLE DIDN'T LOVE GOD. IT'S THAT THEY LOVE THEMSELVES MORE. And they were willing to make THE WORD OF GOD FLEXIBLE FOR THEMSELVES INSTEAD OF MAKING THEMSELVES FLEXIBLE FOR THE WORD. &gt;&gt; BUT OH, PRAISE GOD. AMEN. THERE'S A STONE CUT OUT OF THE MOUNT WITHOUT HANDS, WHICH IS THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST. And in THE END TIME, AMEN, IT'S GOING TO COME AND SMITE THE IMAGE. AMEN. THAT GENTILE WORLD POWER SYSTEM THAT'S MOVED TO THE RELIGION AND IT'S GOING TO SMITE IT AND IT'S GOING TO TURN INTO THE CHAFF OF WHEAT AND BLOW AWAY AND ALL THAT THIS STONE FALLS ON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Which is the REVEALED WORD OF GOD. IT'LL DESTROY IT AND GRIND IT TO POWDER. &gt;&gt; But that HEADSTONE IS A CORNERSTONE. AND THE CORNERSTONE IS JESUS CHRIST, THE WORD OF GOD. AMEN. AND ALL OF US WHO FALL ON THAT STONE WILLINGLY LAY OUR LIVES DOWN AND FALL ON CHRIST WILL BE BROKEN TO PIECES. I WANT TO BE BROKEN TO PIECES. NOT DESTROYED BY THE WORD, BUT I WANT TO FALL ON THE WORD. AND I WANT TO BE BROKEN BY THE WORD so that the word can put me back together. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE BROKEN ON THE FOUNDATION STONE AND BUILT ON THAT FOUNDATION. BROKEN FROM WHAT I AM IN MY SIN NATURE. BROKEN FROM WHAT I AM AND MY MY HUMANITY BORN WRONG THROUGH TWO EARTHLY PARENTS BY SEXUAL DESIRE. I WANT THAT TO BE BROKEN. AND UPON THOSE BROKEN PIECES ON THE ROCK OF REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST, ON THE WORD OF GOD, I WANT GOD TO BUILD THIS VESSEL BACK IN HIS IMAGE, &gt;&gt; ON THE FOUNDATION OF CHRIST, BUILT INTO THE IMAGE OF CHRIST. AND I WANT GOD TO CAP MY LOVE WITH HIS PERFECT LOVE. &gt;&gt; CAP MY LIFE WITH HIS CAPSTONE HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Resting on me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't want to make the word flexible for me. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT EVERY DENOMINATION HAS DONE. THAT'S WHY THERE'S 40OME THOUSAND DENOMINATIONS. THAT'S WHY THEY DON'T LIKE THIS FIT. SO, I'LL FIND MY OWN FIT. I'LL FIND A FIT THAT FITS ME. STOP LOOKING FOR A FIT THAT FITS YOU. &gt;&gt; FIT THE WORD. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE DOING THE SAME THING WITH THE MESSAGE. THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND THE MESSAGE PREACHER, THE MESSAGE CHURCH THAT'LL FIT THEM. STOP TRYING THE MESSAGE THAT FITS YOU. YOU FIT THE WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND IF IT SHAVES SOME OFF, LET IT FALL OFF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'M SO TIRED OF THIS IN MYSELF TRYING TO FIND A WAY. I DON'T WANT TO FIND A WAY. I DON'T WANT TO FIND WIGGLE ROOM OR WORKING ROOM. I WANT TO DIE TO MYSELF. &gt;&gt; That Christ can live in me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. How can Jesus Christ be manifest in this world if we're still uh serving the world &gt;&gt; with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life? &gt;&gt; He has no part in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he that loves the world and the things of the world &gt;&gt; doesn't have the love of God. &gt;&gt; So, I need to hate those things. &gt;&gt; I still find them all around me, but I don't love them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not that I say, "Well, I never find uh lust of the flesh ever in me anymore." NO, I FIND IT ALL THE TIME. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THAT I say, "I've never found the pride of life lurking INSIDE OF ME." NO, I FIND IT ALL THE TIME. BUT I DON'T LOVE IT. I HATE IT. EVERY TIME IT'S EXPOSED TO ME, I HATE IT ALL OVER AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Because I have the love of God in my heart. &gt;&gt; So, I can't love the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bam says she the true bride so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own. His mind of a course is his will and his will is his word. &gt;&gt; So simple. When I tell my children what I want him to do, they don't have to question what my will is. &gt;&gt; If I say, "Hey, can you please, you know, pick up the sticks and start a fire and burn them in the backyard?" They don't have to go out there and say, "I wonder what God's or dad's will is. I gave them my will. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; My will is my word. &gt;&gt; If they don't do that, then they didn't do my will. If they found some other reason not to do it, they exerted their own will over my will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's simple. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's keep looking at David. 1st Samuel 24. These next two passages of scripture is showing us the character that's inside David. We already established that David's not a perfect man and he doesn't have perfect performance, &gt;&gt; but he is a man after God's own will. &gt;&gt; He's a man after God's own heart that will do all his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. So David in 1st Samuel 24:3 says, ' Then Saul took 3,000 chosen men out of the all Israel and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats and he came to the sheep coats. By the way, there was a cave and Saul went into cover his feet and David and his men remained in the side of the cave. Why were David and his men in the cave? &gt;&gt; Because Saul was trying to kill David. &gt;&gt; SAUL WAS JEALOUS. HE WAS envious of David. And he had a bitter envy towards David because David's popularity amongst the people. Amen. So he was trying to kill him. He was chasing him from cave to cave to cave. SO SAUL WHO WAS A FATHER-IN-LAW TO DAVID. And David who had SERVED SAUL. SAUL NOW BEGINS to hate David and persecute David. And David's running away from Saul. And he runs into a cave in the side of the cave. And the cave that he's hiding in, Saul who's chasing him comes into the same cave. It's &gt;&gt; a good story. And the men of David said unto him, "Behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him, as it shall seem good unto thee." Then David arose and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe. I want you to stop for a minute. Don't read on, please. David's men tell him, &gt;&gt; "This is what God promised you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; You're going to become king. You're going to have victory over this. This is it. This is the fulfillment of that promise. &gt;&gt; See, listen. The temptation always has a religious tone. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It has to to deceive the children of God. It has to be religious. &gt;&gt; Has to do with the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he he says David cut his skirt off of Saul wrote priv priv privately. Privy. And it came to pass after the word that David's heart afterward that David's heart smote him because he had cut off Saul's skirt. And he said unto the men, "Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord's anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord." So David stayed his servants with his words and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way. And David also arose afterward and went out of the cave and cried after Saul, saying, "My Lord, the king." And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself. My goodness, look at the humility of David. Listen, it wasn't David's love for Saul that smoteed his heart. &gt;&gt; It was his love for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because it was the Lord who chose Saul. It was the Lord who anointed Saul. It was Samuel who had poured anointing all over HIS HEAD. AT GOD'S BIDDING, GOD MADE HIS CHOICE and he was anointed. And that's what he means. God's anointed. He was anointed by THE PROPHET TO THE OFFICE OF KING. And David said, "How dare his heart smoked him because all HE DID WAS CUT OFF THE SKIRT." AMEN. LIKE HE didn't do anything real, really bad. BUT WHAT WAS HIS FRIENDS TELLING HIM? HIS FRIENDS were saying, "This is what God's been saying. This is the time. This is your deliverance. This is the promise." Amen. And they were trying to make it righteous for David to kill Saul. &gt;&gt; And David did a little disservice to him. And he went out and immediately listen, I don't know what DAVID'S AFFECTION TOWARDS SAUL WAS. IT WAS HIS FATHER-IN-LAW. HE'S MARRIED to his daughter. They had some relationship. But what smoteed him was that David loved the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was a man after God's own heart that do all his will. And if God willed that Saul was the king, who was David to take him out of his position? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David loved the Lord more than he loved himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This was a man who was being bitterly persecuted by Saul, chased away from his home, chased away from his wife, living in caves and dens and rocks and and running where the goat, it says, where the goats were. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Running and hiding from Saul all the time. Amen. This man's life was miserable because of Saul, &gt;&gt; but he would not touch the Lord's anointed &gt;&gt; because that was the word of the Lord for that day. &gt;&gt; Let's go now down a couple chapters later to chapter 26 verse 7. This one, listen, this comes second. And I want you to watch. He's going to face this temptation again. This is the second time. and just watch. It's worse than the first. And in between these two times, there's a whole lot more chasing, a whole lot more threatening, a whole lot more misery. &gt;&gt; All right. Chapter 26:7. So David and Abashi came to the people by night. And behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster. But Abnner and the people lay round about him. Then said Abashi to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day. Now therefore, let me smite him, &gt;&gt; I pray. Let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear, even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him a second time. [laughter] I love this. Listen. They come in and they're all sleeping on the ground in this trench and and they sneak in and there's Saul with his spear stuck in the ground next to him and Abnner and his whole captain his host all around him and they're standing here and Abashai whispers in his ear. This is the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is your chance to be free. This look at God has delivered your enemy to you. Now I know you felt funny last time. So let me smite him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And listen, I'll do IT ONCE AND QUICK. IT'LL BE OVER WITH. NO SUFFERING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL BAD ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; This is what happens in our lives, friends. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you pass THE TEST ONCE, YOU MAY come around and find it again. &gt;&gt; Only it's worse this time because David doesn't have to do the killing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Saul doesn't have to suffer very long. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, keep reading. It gets better. &gt;&gt; Verse nine. And David said to Abashai, "Destroy him not. For who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's anointed and be guiltless?" It wasn't that Saul wasn't guilty. And it's not that Saul wasn't worthy of death. &gt;&gt; David wasn't looking at Saul. He was looking at God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was not answering to Saul. He's answering to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was living a private life &gt;&gt; in obedience to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 10, David said, "Furthermore, as the Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite him. For his day shall come to die, or he shall descend into battle and perish. The Lord forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the Lord's anointing. But I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruise of water, and let us go. And David took the spear and the cruise of water from Saul's bolster, and they got them away. And no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaken, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them. &gt;&gt; This was no ordinary sleep. &gt;&gt; There was an enchantment from God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He had he had sent down a sleeping spirit &gt;&gt; and there was a deep sleep. They would have never woke up. Listen, &gt;&gt; please listen. &gt;&gt; God knocked him out cold. &gt;&gt; So that David could have kicked over the pale and tripped over Abnner's feet and fell on Saul &gt;&gt; and he wouldn't have woke up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God was testing David &gt;&gt; to see what kind of man David was. &gt;&gt; And because God put him to sleep didn't reinforce what Abashai said. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Listen, just because the circumstances seemingly work out, does not mean it's the will of God. &gt;&gt; If it's contrary to the word of God and God still shows a sign or wonder, DON'T CHASE THE SIGN OR WONDER. STAY WITH THE WORD. &gt;&gt; Don't chase emotion. DON'T CHASE FEELINGS. DON'T CHASE ALL THESE THINGS. YOU CAN PRAY AND PRAY AND PRAY AND PRAY YOURSELF INTO A FERVOR UNTIL YOU HAVE A DREAM. &gt;&gt; BROTHER TOLD US THIS. YOU HAVE A DREAM BECAUSE YOUR DREAM IS YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS TRYING TO SORT OUT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ALL DAY. AND YOU'LL TAKE THE DREAM IS FROM THE LORD AND FOLLOW AFTER A DREAM AND LEAVE THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; STAY WITH THE WORD. &gt;&gt; David had everything set UP AND LAID OUT FOR HIM. HE WAS ASLEEP, SPEAR STUCK IN THE GROUND BESIDE HIM. HE HAD THE THE RIGHT GUY ON HIS LEFT OF HIS LEFT SIDE WHISPERING in his ear. &gt;&gt; Everything was perfect. DEEP SLEEP. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WAKE UP. YOU GOT ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD. YOU GOT ABASHAI WHO'S GOING TO DO IT FOR YOU. HE'S GOING TO DO IT QUICKLY and clean. THE WHOLE THING'S OVER. EVERYTHING'S NICE, CLEAN, AND TIDY. AND GOD'S GOING TO MAKE SURE NOBODY'S GOING TO WAKE UP BECAUSE GOD WANTS TO SEE WHAT'S INSIDE OF DAVID. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; God may give you an opportunity. AND IT MAY WORK OUT SUPERNATURALLY. &gt;&gt; Just to see what's inside of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If it's contrary to the word of God, leave it alone. &gt;&gt; I want to be like David, not like Saul. &gt;&gt; What do you think Saul would have done? &gt;&gt; Yeah. WHAT DO YOU THINK SAUL would have done if he come up on a on a a a field and all David and his mighty men are asleep and you can kick the bucket and you can trip over Abashai's feet and you can fall on David. He never wakes up and his spear's laying there and and Abnner's off his left shoulder said the the Lord has delivered your enemy to you. What do you think Saul would have done? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But listen at this stage David was also anointed of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if HE WOULD HAVE KILLED DAVID, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTRARY TO THE WORD of God. WHAT DO YOU THINK SAUL WOULD HAVE DONE? SAUL WAS CAUGHT UP IN PRIDE. THAT'S WHY HE HAD ENVY. SAUL WAS CAUGHT UP IN HIS POLITICAL SCHEMES TRYING TO HOLD ON TO POWER FOR HIS OWN PRIDE. HE WOULD HAVE SMOKED HIM CLEAN. ESPECIALLY IF ABNNER SAYS, "I DON'T EVEN YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO do it. I'll do it. Turn your back." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That way you don't have to tell your daughter that's married to him that you did it. I'll do I'LL MAKE IT NICE, CLEAN, AND TIDY. I BELIEVE SAUL WOULD HAVE WENT FOR IT. &gt;&gt; YEAH. CUZ SAUL WAS TRYING TO KILL HIM WITH A JAVELIN MULTIPLE TIMES. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE SAUL. I WANT TO BE LIKE DAVID. I WANT TO BE A MAN AFTER GOD'S OWN HEART. I MAY MESS UP A THOUSAND TIMES, BUT WHEN I'M CONFRONTED WITH THE WORD, I WANT TO SAY, "I HAVE SIN. IT'S MY FAULT. I DID IT, AND I'M NOT HOLDING ANYBODY ELSE ACCOUNTABLE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, DON'T THINK JUST BECAUSE it worked out in an UNUSUAL WAY, THAT'S GOD GIVING you permission to leave his word. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's the greatest temptation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God might just be testing you to prove what's inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother said God loves to prove his children. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He loves to test him. He loved to test what was inside of Job. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew just what he was doing and he knew what Job could take. And he had confidence in Job. AND HE LOVED to test him to prove that Job's not going to fail me. He's not going to sin against me with his mouth. Amen. He's not going to forsake my word. He may get all kinds of confused. He may even say some things that he regrets saying, but he's not going to leave my word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God loves to test his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God's going to prove what's inside of us. And listen, we're all going to get a chance. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We'll all get a chance to prove what's in us. &gt;&gt; And we need to determine right now, I'm going to stay with this word if it kills me. &gt;&gt; Job said, "Though he slay me, yet will I serve him." &gt;&gt; Though he slay me, yet will I GIVE HIM MY LIFE. I'VE LOST MY CHILDREN. I'VE LOST EVERYTHING. I'VE LOST MY WEALTH. I'VE LOST PRESTIGE. I'VE LOST THE LUST OF THE FLESH. I'VE LOST THE THE LUST OF THE EYES. I'VE LOST THE PRIDE OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHERE JOB WAS. HE LOST IT ALL. HE LOST HIS MATERIAL GOODS. HE LOST THE DESIRE OF HIS HEART. HE LOST HIS CHILDREN. HE LOST HIS PRESTIGE AMONGST THE COMMUNITY. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; And he says, AND HE EVEN LOST RESPECT WITH HIS WIFE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; You can't hardly get any lower than Job was. &gt;&gt; But he said, "Though he slay me, yet will I serve him." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Friends, &gt;&gt; in the message leadership, &gt;&gt; it says in Shreport last week, week before last, at a businessman's meeting, a breakfast there where several hundreds of people had gathered, I took two and a half hours to speak on doing God a service without it being God's will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that sounds strange, but we've got to channel ourselves into God's provided channel and God's way of doing it. No matter how much we think it's right, it's got to be according to the word of the Lord or it's in vain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cain worshiped, but it wasn't according to the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; He the Pharisees worshiped but not according to the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen, when brother Brandham was preaching uh uh doing God a service without being his will, he went back into the Old Testament to the life of David, DAVID HAD A DESIRE TO BRING THE ARK of the covenant out of the enemy's camp and back into Israel. HE WANTED THE WORD BECAUSE WHAT WAS IN THAT ARK? IT REPRESENTED THE PRESENCE of God because in there was the ten commandments, God's original word to his people. &gt;&gt; AND HE WANTED TO BRING THE WORD BACK. ALSO, THE BOOK OF ORDINANCE WAS THERE AND HE WAS TRYING TO BRING THE WORD BACK TO BRING THE PRESENCE OF GOD BACK INTO the camp. &gt;&gt; That's a good thing. &gt;&gt; How many agree that's a good thing? &gt;&gt; David wanted to do a good thing. &gt;&gt; HIS DESIRE WAS RIGHT. AMEN. HIS TIMING WAS EVEN RIGHT. HE WAS IT WAS TIME TO DO IT. HE WANTED TO DO IT. HE WAS THE KING. EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But he didn't do it according to the word. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD COMMANDED THROUGH MOSES that the Levites will bear the ark on their shoulder. Amen. AND AND DAVID DECIDED WHEN CONSULTING WITH THE CAPTAINS OF thousands and the captains of hundreds, HE NEVER CONSULTED WITH THE PROPHET. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T CONSULT THE WORD. AND THEY ALL SAID, "YES, IT'S A GREAT IDEA. YES, LET'S DO IT." AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINES, THEY GOT AN IDEA. LET'S PUT IT ON AN OX CART. &gt;&gt; Who was the last ones to put it on an ox cart? It was the Philistines. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. Right. &gt;&gt; The Philistines put it on an ox cart. That's where that idea come from. &gt;&gt; Not from the word of God, but from another church system. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now he says, "LET'S JUST DO WHAT WE SAW LAST TIME. LAST TIME IT GOT HERE, how did IT GET HERE? IT GOT HERE ON AN OX CAR. LET'S PUT IT ON ANOTHER OX CAR. IT WORKED LAST TIME. &gt;&gt; YEAH, &gt;&gt; THAT MAY WORK FOR THE PHILISTINES TO GET THE WORD OUT OF THE PHILISTINES CAMP AND BACK TO THE EDGE OF ISRAEL. BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK TO BRING THE WORD, THE PRESENCE OF GOD BACK INTO THE CAMP, BACK INTO JERUSALEM. IT'S GOING TO TAKE IT WORD BY WORD, OBEDIENCE to the word. AND WHEN THEY PUT IT ON AN OX CART, AMEN, THE OX BEGAN TO STUMBLE. THE ARK BEGAN TO ROCK. AND ONE MAN PUT HIS HAND ON IT TO STEADY IT, AND HE WAS SMITTEN DEAD INSTANTLY. WHY? BECAUSE sin brings death. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS LETTING DAVID KNOW, YOU GOT THE RIGHT IDEA. YOU GOT THE RIGHT MOTIVE AND OBJECTIVE. AMEN. BUT YOU GOT TO DO IT ACCORDING TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, you and I CAN HAVE THE RIGHT IDEA, THE RIGHT DESIRE, THE RIGHT MOTIVE AND OBJECTIVE. BUT WE BETTER CONSULT WITH THE PROPHET FOR THIS DAY TO FIND OUT WHAT THE WORD FOR THIS DAY IS SO THAT WE DO IT ACCORDING TO THE WORD &gt;&gt; BECAUSE TO GET OFF THE WORD WILL BRING DEATH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Help us, God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay with this word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother says, "And notice Cain, he didn't want no blood sacrifice." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He came down and offered the fruit or the fields of beauty upon his altar. Very religious. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Done everything that just exactly like Abel done offered a sacrifice. FELL DOWN BEFORE GOD IN WORSHIP. Obedient in every way, but without the revelation of the word. And the word was from the beginning God's plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God revealed by revelation the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that it was right. Not religion, not an altar, not belonging to church, not making a sacrifice, not being sincere, but by the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; By faith, Abel offered a MORE EXCELLENT SACRIF. FAITH IN WHAT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; FAITH IN THE WORD. SOMETHING WAS REVEALED TO HIM. WHAT WAS REVEALED? IT WAS THE WORD OF GOD. GOD'S DESIRE FOR THE RIGHT KIND OF SACRIFICE. A BLOOD ATONEMENT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD WORK. HOW DID HE GET THAT REVELATION? IT WAS THE WORD OF GOD. IT'S WHAT GOD DID TO COVER THE SINS OF HIS CHILDREN when they fell in Eden. AND NOW THAT REVELATION CAME TO ABEL AND ABEL BY FAITH. FAITH IN WHAT? FAITH IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; Offered a more excellent sacrifice. &gt;&gt; THEN WHEN GOD TELLS CAIN IN HIS MERCY SAY, "LISTEN, if you'll just do like your brother does, won't want TO BE WELL WITH YOU." HE EVEN TOLD CAIN, "JUST REPEAT WHAT YOU SEEN YOUR brother do, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AND I'LL ACCEPT YOU." BUT CAIN COULDN'T RECEIVE THE REVELATION OF THE WORD. HE THOUGHT HIS IDEA WAS BETTER. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND HIS IDEA WASN'T BAD. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; And his idea wasn't evil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; And his desire wasn't wickedness. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What was Cain trying to do? worship. &gt;&gt; He was trying to worship God. &gt;&gt; What did Cain want to do? He wanted to find acceptance with God. &gt;&gt; He wanted to worship God. &gt;&gt; He He wanted to find pleasure with God so God would find pleasure with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wanted to. And listen, Cain wasn't just trivial in what he did. Cain worked and labored to bring the fruits of the field. &gt;&gt; Amen. his work of his hands, the labor that he labored for, and he was bringing it to the Lord. &gt;&gt; He wanted to worship the true God &gt;&gt; at the appointed time &gt;&gt; in the right place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he didn't do it according to the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And his offering wasn't bad because first fruits will become a good offering. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; First fruits are a good offering, but you can't come to first fruits till you come through the blood, &gt;&gt; through atonement. Yeah. &gt;&gt; His works did him no good that he offered to God until he first had the atonement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Cain's temptation was not to do something evil, but to do something good, but not according to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; David's temptation was to do something good, but not according to the word. &gt;&gt; I hope we're finding &gt;&gt; how dangerous this world is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, our security doesn't come from coming to church. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our security can't come from being with a good group of people or even hearing the truth. Our security has to come from the fact that we have a relationship with a heavenly father. And if I get out of line, he'll correct me with his word. He'll reveal his word to me. He won't let me go wrong. And I've got a desire in my heart to take his word. And when he exposes me, I say, "It's me, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm wrong. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He says here I spoke here in Shreport the other day on a national broadcast across the nation that trying to do God a service without it being his God's will. David tried to bring the ark of God back into the house. He was anointed king. Why he consulted his delegates his captains of thousands 1000 thousands and so forth. They said that's the word of the Lord. And he consulted the priests. That was wonderful. And they all got so inspired. They shouted. They done every religious act that was. And they was absolutely contrary to God's will because there was a prophet in the land by the name of Nathan and he wasn't even consulted about it. And we found out it didn't work though. They were sincere trying to do God a service. And you can be ever so sincere, but until we know what we're doing, you're fighting at the air. Come back into the word of God and get lined up and then go. Then you know like a soldier don't know what to do until he gets orders to do it. We must be Christian soldiers and get orders from the Bible for this hour now. Not the charge yesterday, the charge the day before, but the charge today. Which way we go? Find out the hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. In Matthew 16. Oh man, I'm going to black this out. Matthew 16 is a very famous chapter for us because in Matthew chapter 16, JESUS STARTS TO ASK, "WHO DO MEN SAY that I am? And they say, "Well, some says that are Elias. Some says they're Jeremiah. Some says this prophet or that." But he Jesus, listen, this is the most important question. &gt;&gt; But who do you say that I am? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all OF A SUDDEN, PETER SPOKE UP BY INSPIRATION. He said, "Thou art Christ, the son of the living God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Blessed art thou Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood have not revealed this thing to you, but my father which is heaven has revealed it to you. And upon this rock I'll build my church. &gt;&gt; Listen, Peter just got a direct revelation from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of who Jesus Christ was. Not nobody taught it to him. Not nobody explained it to him. And not that he figured it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the father told him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And under inspiration, he knew you are the son of God. They are Christ, the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then right after that, Jesus starts to tell them, &gt;&gt; this is the next verse, friends. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; From that time forth began Jesus is showing to his disciples how that he must go into Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day. Then Peter, same person, &gt;&gt; took him and began to rebuke him, saying, "Be it far from thee, Lord. This shall not be unto thee." But he turned and said unto Peter, "Get thee behind me, Satan. Thou [clears throat] art an offense to me, for thou savorest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe Peter loved the Lord? &gt;&gt; With all my heart, I believe Peter loved the Lord. &gt;&gt; But Peter just under inspiration declared that you're the Christ, the son of the living God. And that Christ, son of the living God, starts to bring the word for their age. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And starts to tell them by prophesying what's getting ready to happen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he's telling them the same one he declares to be Christ, the son of the living God. Begins to show his disciples that he's got to go to Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elder and the chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again. Listen, what he's giving Peter is thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's giving him the word, the word for the hour that they live, what's about to happen next. and Peter and his zeal and HIS LOVE FOR GOD AND HIS LOVE FOR HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; HE BEGINS TO TAKE Jesus and rebuke HIM AND SAY, "FAR BE IT FROM THEE FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN TO THEE." AND Jesus sees through Peter and he sees the spirit that is anointing Peter AND HE SAYS, "SATAN, GET BEHIND ME." &gt;&gt; PETER WASN'T SATAN. PETER WAS A MAN WITH A LOVE FOR GOD. BUT THERE WAS SOME LUST OR PRIDE OR SOMETHING IN PETER THAT THE DEVIL COULD WORK ON. PETER DIDN'T WANT THIS MINISTRY TO END. HE didn't want Jesus to go away. He didn't want these things to happen. &gt;&gt; But if HE REALLY LOVED GOD, HE WOULD WANT WHATEVER GOD SAID. IF GOD SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO DIE, THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S THE WORD OF THE LORD. NOT THAT I WANT IT TO HAPPEN, BUT I WANT GOD'S WORD MORE THAN I WANT MY FEELINGS. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Get thee behind me, Satan. and thou are an offense to me. &gt;&gt; FOR THOU SAVOREST NOT THE THINGS THAT BE OF GOD. WHAT BE OF GOD? GOING INTO JERUSALEM, BEING EVILLY TREATED BY THE ELDERS, AND BEING KILLED, AND RAISED THE THIRD DAY. THAT'S OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND PETER COULDN'T IMAGINE THIS BEING OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY. WE'VE GOT A GREAT REVIVAL. I JUST FOUND OUT WHO YOU ARE. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OVER THE KINGDOM, AND I'M GOING TO BE YOUR RIGHT-HAND MAN. &gt;&gt; You think Peter wanted all that to come crashing down? No. So that's where the devil had entrance &gt;&gt; to the pride of life, &gt;&gt; to his human affections. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Thou savorst not the things that be of God." Because the things that be of God is the will of God. &gt;&gt; But you savor those that be of men, &gt;&gt; lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh, pride of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing aunderder of soul and spirit and of the joints and the marorrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's discerning your heart? &gt;&gt; The word. &gt;&gt; Amen. How is the word discerning my heart? Listen, when the word comes, &gt;&gt; how you react to that word is discerning your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; When the word of God comes forth and is vindicated and proved for this generation through a prophetic ministry, bringing out the truth of this scripture for the hour we're living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that word comes unto you. The way you handle that word proves what's inside of your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the word of God through this prophet in the end time, if it strips you of your religious covering, &gt;&gt; and you try to hold on to it, &gt;&gt; the word is discerning your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; If this word, Amen. begins to expose, Amen. your religious rhetoric, but you want to keep the religious rhetoric and not come to the word. The word is discerning your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, when this word comes to put you in your right position in place, but you want to keep the position you have and not forsake it for another position. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the word is discerning your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean you don't love God. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean you're not sincere. And it doesn't mean you don't really want to serve God, but there's still something of self that's being mixed in. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And that's what's got to die. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to read a couple more scriptures as we wind down. He says here in Matthew 6, "Take heed that you do not your arms before men to be seen of them. Otherwise, you have no reward of your father which is in heaven. Therefore, when thou doest thine arms, do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may give have glory of men. Verily, I say unto you, they have their reward. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; That's not the reward I'm after. &gt;&gt; To be seen of men and acknowledge as a good person in the eye. That's not the reward I want. &gt;&gt; I want to be pleasing to my father. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to enter his gates. I want to be part of his kingdom. I want to bow at his feet. &gt;&gt; I want to be rewarded with eternal life with my maker. &gt;&gt; But when thou doest thou alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth, that thine arms may that thy arms may be in secret, and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are. They love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward. &gt;&gt; There it is again. &gt;&gt; But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to the father which is in secret, and the father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reward I want. &gt;&gt; Amen. Again he says, "Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you are like whited supplicers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness. Even so you also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity." Who's saying this to them? Jesus. Who's he saying it to? The most religious people in his day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. the most religious to the tops of the religion AND THEY WERE PART OF THE TRUE RELIGION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; They weren't false. He wasn't saying it's the Philistines and Canaanites AND EGYPTIANS. HE WAS TALKING TO JEWS WHO HAD the word of the Lord, who were oracles of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he's telling them, you you use this religion to look good on the outside. You stand and YOU GIVE BIG PRAYERS. YOU BLOW A TRUMPET. YOU GIVE ARMS. YOU BROADEN YOUR FELACTORIES. YOU YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE great men. You give great swelling words and speeches. But but THE SAME VOICE THAT WALKED in the garden of Eden that knew that that that that could see through the fig leaves of Adam was the same one walking amen in Judea that day who could see through the fig leaves of the Pharisees. &gt;&gt; They could see through the arms paying. They could SEE THROUGH THE LOUD PRAYERS. They could see through the broad garments and the &gt;&gt; He could see through it all. &gt;&gt; And he realized their heart was far from gone. They gave appearance. How did he know it? Because he was the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they were rejecting the word but keeping their religion. &gt;&gt; Who are they keeping it for? For themselves. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah says, "But oh Lord of hosts that judgeth righteously, that tryth the reigns and the heart." God's not judging your outward appearance. &gt;&gt; God wasn't judging the outside of the Pharisees. He was judging the inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How did he know the inside was dirty? Because he was there, the word of God, the fulfillment of the prophecy. He was the word made flesh. He said, "You believe in Moses. If you believe in Moses, you'd believe in me. For Moses wrote of me, &gt;&gt; and they denied him, claiming still to believe Moses." And he knew inside you're rotten because I'm giving you the word. I'm giving you the truth. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He said, "You say your father's Abraham, your father's the devil. He's a liar. Was a liar from the beginning and to try to destroy the truth." Abraham, you say Abraham's your father. I'm a man who's told you the truth and you seek to destroy my life. This Abraham didn't do. &gt;&gt; WHAT DID ABRAHAM DO? ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE ENCOUNTERED A LIVING GOD AND GOD GAVE HIM THE WORD FOR THE HOUR HE WAS LIVING, HE BELIEVED GOD. &gt;&gt; NOW, HERE IS GOD IN THE FORM OF JESUS CHRIST GIVING THE WORD FOR THEIR DAY. AND THEY DISBELIEVE the word. THEY DISBELIEVE GOD AND CLAIM TO BE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM. HE SAID, "IF YOU WERE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM, YOU WOULD LOVE ME &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I CAME FROM GOD." WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS NOT WHAT YOUR FATHER DOES. YOU'VE GOT DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES. SO YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT FATHER. YOU'VE GOT THE SAME FATHER THAT'S ALWAYS RESISTED THE WORD. THE ONE WHO RESISTED IN NOAH'S DAY. THE ONE WHO RESISTED IN MOSES DAY. THE ONE WHO RESISTED IT IN JEREMIAH'S DAY. YOU'VE GOT THE SAME ANOINTING ON YOU TO RESIST THE LIVING WORD. SO YOUR FATHER IS THE SAME FATHER OF THOSE THAT RESISTED IN EVERY OTHER DAY. YOUR FATHER'S THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS HE DOING? THE WORD OF GOD BEING MANIFEST IN THAT HOUR WAS DISCERNING THE HEARTS. &gt;&gt; WHAT DID HE FIND? RELIGIOUS LEADERS THAT WERE CORRUPT INSIDE, LOOK GOOD ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT HE FOUND A PROSTITUTE THAT WAS CORRUPT ON THE OUTSIDE THAT HAD SOMETHING DEEP WITHIN THAT WAS HUNGERING FOR A LIVING GOD, &gt;&gt; FOR A REAL GOD, FOR THE TRUE GOD. &gt;&gt; And when SHE CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE SAME THING THE PHARISEES AND JOHN 8 CAME IN CONTACT WITH, SHE SAID, "WE KNOW MESSIAH WILL DO THESE THINGS. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW MESSIAH'S COMING, AND WHEN HE COMES, HE'LL DO THESE SAME THINGS." HE SAID, "I am he that speaketh to you." SHE DROPPED HER WATER POT. SHE DIDN'T GO READ. &gt;&gt; She didn't GO GET AN EDUCATION. SHE DIDN'T GO REASON. SHE RAN INTO THE CITY AND SAID, "COME SEE A MAN THAT TOLD ME ALL THINGS THAT I'VE EVER DONE IS NOT THIS TO CHRIST." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; She accepted it immediately. &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T FIGHT IT. SHE DIDN'T RESIST IT. THEY WERE CLEAN ON THE OUTSIDE, DIRTY ON THE INSIDE. SHE WAS DIRTY ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT PURE ON THE INSIDE. IN HER SOUL, SHE HAD SOMETHING SHE COULD BELIEVE the word with. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND IT TESTIFIED THAT SHE was righteous. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; WHEN THAT HARLOT WOMAN COME along to WASH JESUS'S FEET, WHERE WAS JESUS? HE WAS IN SIMON'S HOUSE. THE PRIEST, &gt;&gt; but the priest invited him, but didn't welcome him. &gt;&gt; Didn't wash his feet. &gt;&gt; Didn't anoint him with oil. Didn't greet him with a kiss. They just let him sit in the corner with dirty feet. &gt;&gt; But there WAS A HARLOT WOMAN, A PROSTITUTE. &gt;&gt; The devil says she if he knew what manner of woman this was. Another place it says her sins were many. &gt;&gt; If he knew what manner of woman this, he wouldn't let her wash his feet. She ran in THERE WITH AN ALABASTER BOX FULL OF OINTMENT AND BROKE IT ON HIS FEET. BEGIN TO WEEP UPON HIS FEET AND CRY AT HIS FEET. WHAT WAS IT? SOMETHING INSIDE OF HER WAS RECOGNIZING THIS IS GOD. THIS IS RIGHT. THIS IS THE WORD. THIS IS WHAT MOSES TOLD US. THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN waiting for. &gt;&gt; AND AS SHE POURED HER LIFE OUT ON HIS FEET AND WEPT AND DRIED HIM WITH HER HAIR, WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN SHE DRIES HIS FEET WITH HER HAIR? His feet were corrupt from the streets. &gt;&gt; It was dirt AND DUST IN HIS SANDALS AND MANURE FROM THE ANIMALS. IT WAS ALL THAT FILTH AND CORRUPTION ON HIS FEET. AND IF THOSE FEET WERE REJECTED FEET BECAUSE SIMON SHOULD HAVE WASHED HIS FEET WHEN HE WELCOMED IN HIS HOME. BUT THOSE DIRTY FEET WERE A SIGN OF THE REJECTED WORD. &gt;&gt; The living WORD OF GOD REJECTED IN THAT DAY. BUT THAT WOMAN, SHE COULDN'T STAND TO SEE THE WORD REJECTED. SHE WENT AND POURED HER SOUL OUT AT HIS FEET AND SHE TOOK THE REJECTION UPON HER HEAD. &gt;&gt; SHE TOOK THAT HAIR, AMEN, THAT BEAUTIFUL LONG HAIR. AND SHE BEGAN TO WIPE THE MUCK AND THE MUD WHERE THE TEARS MIXED WITH THE DIRT AND THE MANURE. AND SHE TOOK HIS REJECTION, HIS SHAME, AND SHE PUT IT WHERE IN HER GLORY. FOR A WOMAN'S LONG HAIR IS HER GLORY. SHE TOOK SHE GAVE HER GLORY TO HIM AND TOOK HIS REPROACH UPON HER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And the Pharisees looked at the outside of her and said, "How can you let that woman touch you?" And Simon, who was judging her, realized he was condemned &gt;&gt; because he didn't receive the word. &gt;&gt; Still had his position in church, still had respect among his colleagues, still had his wealth. He was utterly rejected. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He looked at the woman and he said to Simon, "Simon, I have somewhat to say against thee. When I came here, you gave me no kiss. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You didn't anoint me. My feet you did not wash. But this woman has not ceased to wash my feet with her tears and anoint them and kiss me. &gt;&gt; So, and I say to her, her sins which are many are all forgiven. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; she didn't do good deeds. She didn't have good church attendance. She may not even been dressed right. &gt;&gt; But what was it? Something in her recognized this was God. &gt;&gt; Simon couldn't recognize it. She could recognize it. Something in her could serve this God. Something in her would give her life to this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Simon wanted to keep his pride of life, his lust of the flesh, his love of the eye. It wasn't that Simon I don't think Simon didn't love God. &gt;&gt; Simon may have loved God, but Simon loved Simon more than Simon loved God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Simon couldn't give up his prestige anymore than the the the rest of the ruling party there in Israel could give up their position. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Listen, when it came time to get rid of Jesus, they they they started saying, the chief priests gathered together and the high priest was there and they began to say, "Listen, he's he listen, if we let this GO ON, EVERYBODY'S FALLING AFTER HIM. We're going to have the Romans come down here and take our nation and take our position." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What were they looking at? Natural natural natural things. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We can't HAVE THIS REVIVAL. WE CAN'T HAVE THIS WORD. WE CAN'T HAVE THIS TRUTH INTERRUPTING OUR position &gt;&gt; in our NATION AND WE'RE HIGH PRIEST AND WE LISTEN WE'VE GOT A RIGHT TO RULE AND WE'VE GOT A GOOD THING GOING WITH the Romans. They leave us alone and we still have position. We still HAVE PRESTIGE. WE STILL CAN MAKE OUR MONEY. We can STILL BE HELD IN HONOR AMONGST THE PEOPLE. BUT IF THIS IF THIS KEEPS GOING AND IT BECOMES A CLAMOR, THE ROMANS ARE going to come in here AND TAKE THIS ALL AWAY. And then the high PRIEST ROSE UP CAIAPHAS AND HE SAYS, "SHALL ONE MAN IS IT EXPEDIENT THAT ONE MAN SHALL DIE FOR THE NATION?" AMEN. AND THE THE BIBLE SAYS HE PROPHESIED. HE SAID THAT BECAUSE HE WAS the high priest that year. &gt;&gt; Yeah, sir. &gt;&gt; AND HE GAVE A PROPHECY AND IT WAS A TRUE PROPHECY. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND IT CAME TO PASS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT MOVED HIM TO SAY IT? HE WAS TRYING TO KEEP HIS position &gt;&gt; in his honor. &gt;&gt; He was a right office the wrong person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; God anointed him to speak a prophecy, but he himself was wicked and corrupt. &gt;&gt; And didn't love the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; When they delivered Jesus, listen, after he says a statement like that, you know what that becomes? That becomes a religious cloak &gt;&gt; for having a man murdered, not according to the law, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They were acting completely contrary to the law of Moses. And here they are trying to uphold the law. &gt;&gt; What was their justification? They found a religious reason to kill him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They had a fig leaf covering to cover their true intention of their wicked heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't just God who could see through it. This time when they brought him to Pilot, Pilate could see through it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Cuz it said Pilate tried to release him because Pilate realized that for envy, &gt;&gt; the chief priest had delivered him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is that? Lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, pride of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hid behind a religious cloak. &gt;&gt; Friends, what is the greatest temptation? &gt;&gt; Not going to a house of prostitution. &gt;&gt; I mean, for children of God who are trying to serve God. &gt;&gt; Not going out and getting drunk tonight. Not going out finding a bunch of drugs. That's not the greatest temptation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The greatest temptation is to do something that looks good, but for the wrong reasons. that I get something out of and I look good and my pride and my prestige and my lust and I get to keep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll find a religious reason &gt;&gt; to cover my own worldliness. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What's worldliness? Lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, pride of life. &gt;&gt; Not dressing skimpy. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's a result. &gt;&gt; It's worldliness. So what is that fig leaf religion trying to cover with religion? What's it that's the temptation or in sincerity with a sincere heart wanting to actually do something for God but not doing it according to the word. &gt;&gt; That's the greatest temptation you and I are going to face. &gt;&gt; What's the solution to the temptation? Paul told us, "I die daily." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I die to my wants. I die to my dreams. I die to my ambitions. I die to my pride. I die to all of that and surrender to his word. &gt;&gt; And secondly, I want to walk in a relationship with him to where he can correct me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To where he can come like he did to David and said, "David, you got the right idea in bringing the ark back. You got the right motive, but you're doing it wrong." &gt;&gt; Right. And David would say, "Oh, God." He doesn't go back to everybody and says, "You know, I think um uh I had another idea." Trying to keep his pride and trying to look good. No, I believe David went back and says, "Guys, I got it all wrong. This is where we failed. &gt;&gt; We didn't keep the word." Amen. We had the right desire. We had sincerity. We we wanted to worship God. We wanted his presence among us, but we we failed to KEEP THE WORD. OH, LET'S COME BACK to the word. AND WHEN THEY COME BACK TO the word, look at the revival. Look at the jubilee. Look at the dancing. Look at the singing. LOOK AT THE SHOUTING. AS THE ARK CAME, THE WORD CAME ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE LEVITES MARCHING BACK INTO JERUSALEM, BRINGING THE WORD AND THE PRESENCE OF GOD BACK INTO THEIR MIDST. AND DAVID DANCED BEFORE THE LORD UNTIL HIS WIFE CALLED HIM A FOOL. &gt;&gt; HE WAS SO EXCITED. WHAT WAS EXCITING, DAVID? DAVID WAS SO THRILLED. AMEN. BECAUSE GOD HAD CORRECTED HIM AND GOD HAD TOLD HIM WHAT YOU DESIRE IS RIGHT, BUT YOU GOT TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. AND NOW DAVID KNEW THE RIGHT WAY. AND DAVID COULD HARDLY CONTAIN HIS JOY BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO WORK THIS TIME. IT'S GOING TO WORK THIS TIME. THE PRESENCE OF GOD IS COMING BACK AMONG US BECAUSE WE'RE DOING IT ACCORDING TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVERY FEW STEPS, SLAY OXEN. EVERY FEW STEPS, SLAY, WHAT ARE THEY DOING? REJOICING. REJOICING. REJOICING. BECAUSE THE word's coming back. UNTIL HE DANCED BEFORE THE LORD WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND DISROED HIS OUTER GARMENTS TILL HIS WIFE BEGAN TO MOCK HIM, WHICH WAS SAUL'S DAUGHTER. &gt;&gt; HAD THE SAME PROBLEM HER DAD DID, PRIDE. &gt;&gt; And she said, "IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THAT, COME WATCH ME TOMORROW." &gt;&gt; LIKE, THAT'S NOT PRIDE, FRIENDS. THAT'S NOT ARROGANCE. THAT'S A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT WORD IS GOING TO COME BACK BECAUSE GOD GAVE ME THE WORD AND THAT WORD CAN'T FAIL. AND I KNOW EXACTLY NOW HOW TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT'S IN MY HEART. &gt;&gt; I KNOW HOW TO WORSHIP HIM. I KNOW WHAT HE WANTS. AMEN. CAN YOU IMAGINE ABEL WAITING TO WORSHIP GOD? AMEN. AT THE GATE OF OF EDEN, NOT KNOWING WHAT GOD WANTS AND HOW TO WORSHIP HIM AND HOW TO PLEASE HIM. CAN YOU IMAGINE HIS JOY WHEN HE GOT THE REVELATION, GOD WANTS BLOOD. ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT DAWNED ON HIM. WHAT DID HE DO WHEN MY PARENTS FELL? WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE? WHY AM I IN THIS CONDITION? WHY ARE WE OUTSIDE OF THE GARDEN? ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE REALIZED HE WANTS BLOOD. COULD YOU IMAGINE HIS REJOICING AS HE WENT SKIPPING AND JUMPING AND RUNNING TO GO FIND A LAMB BECAUSE NOW I KNOW WHAT WILL WORK. I KNOW WHAT GOD WANTS. I KNOW HOW TO PLEASE THE LORD. IT WILL WORK &gt;&gt; BECAUSE it's according to the word. &gt;&gt; WE TRY TO SAVE PEOPLE. WE TRY TO DO GREAT WORKS FOR GOD. WE TRY CAMPAIGNS. WE TRY ALL OF THIS AND IT WON'T WORK IF IT'S NOT DONE ACCORDING TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; The word IS THE WAY. IT'S BEEN THE WAY FROM THE BEGINNING. WE'VE GOT TO COME BACK TO THE WORD AND PRAISE GOD, GOD HAS SENT BACK HIS WORD IN THIS DAY BY A VINDICATED PROPHET TO BRING US THE FULL TEACHING OF THE FATHERS OF FAITH. &gt;&gt; So that WE KNOW [screaming] IT WILL WORK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; How do you know it's working? &gt;&gt; Prophet God says that's the only way you know you can overcome &gt;&gt; is by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if we have the word, we know we'll overcome. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He also said, "This is the only way you'll know you are overcoming." &gt;&gt; Let's think about that statement for a minute. &gt;&gt; This is the only way you'll know you're overcoming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought I would know I was overcoming when everything was working out right. &gt;&gt; That would be the obvious answer, but that's not what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The only way you'll know you're overcoming &gt;&gt; is by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that means when I'm following the word and it doesn't look like I'm overcoming, I know I'm overcoming. &gt;&gt; When I'm following the word and everything's going wrong, &gt;&gt; contrary to my idea, opposite of what I was hoping would happen, &gt;&gt; the only way I can know I'M OVERCOMING IS NOT BECAUSE I'M MAKING PROGRESS. &gt;&gt; The only way I KNOW I'M OVERCOMING IS I'M STAYING WITH THE WORD. AND THE WORD CAN'T FAIL. AND IF I STAY WITH THE WORD, I'M OVERCOMING BECAUSE THE WORD IS ETERNAL AND WILL NEVER FADE AWAY. &gt;&gt; I DON'T LOOK FOR RESULTS. I LOOK FOR THE WORD. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, [screaming] PHARISEES HAD RESULTS. THEY WERE PROILITIZING ALL OVER THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, JUDAS HAD RESULTS. HE WAS CASTING OUT DEVILS AND HEALING THE SICK. I'M NOT LOOKING FOR RESULTS. I'M LOOKING AT THE WORD AND I'M TRYING TO STAY RIGHT WITH THE WORD BECAUSE IF I STAY WITH THE WORD, I can't fail. &gt;&gt; Cuz his word can't fail. &gt;&gt; That's true. And I know I'm overcoming when I face opposition, when everything goes haywire, WHEN IT GOES OPPOSITE to what I think is right. If I stay with the word, I know that I'm overcoming. &gt;&gt; But you BE LIKE, "BROTHER CHAD, YOU'RE YOU'RE MILES AWAY FROM YOUR OBJECTIVE, BUT I'M OVERCOMING." &gt;&gt; It doesn't LOOK LIKE IT TO ME. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT TO ME EITHER. BUT I'M NOT LOOKING AT RESULTS, AND I'M NOT LOOKING AT CONDITIONS. I'M LOOKING AT THE WORD. We overcome by the word. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I want to leave you with this scripture. Didn't get to finish, but maybe we will on Wednesday. 1 Peter 1:24. For all flesh is as grass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all the glory of man is as the flower of grass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The grass witherth, and the flower thereof fallth away, but the word of the Lord endureth forever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; What can I rest my salvation on? The word. &gt;&gt; What if I don't feel saved? It doesn't matter how I feel. I'm taking the word. &gt;&gt; What if I DON'T FEEL LIKE an overcomer? I'm taking the word. What if I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M HEALED? I'M LOOKING AT THE PROMISE. I'M STANDING ON THE WORD. I'M OVERCOMING BY THE WORD, NOT MY FEELINGS, &gt;&gt; not by WHAT I SEE. GOD LOVES TO PROVE HIS CHILDREN. HE'LL LET EVERYTHING GO RIGHT. because it's the wrong direction. &gt;&gt; HE'LL LET EVERYTHING GO PERFECT TO SEE if you'll leave the word &gt;&gt; and go after what looks perfect or stay with the word even though that looks perfect. &gt;&gt; He'll put them to sleep. &gt;&gt; He'll give you abashai to tell you he'll do it for you. &gt;&gt; It all work out perfect, &gt;&gt; but it's not the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he can test you with everything being perfect, but not the word. &gt;&gt; Then he can make everything go wrong, &gt;&gt; completely wrong, and look horrible &gt;&gt; and be painful. But it's the word &gt;&gt; to see if you'll take the word. &gt;&gt; And God will test his children with both. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He tested David. He tested Job with opposite tests. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he will, we can expect him to test us with both. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I said that was the last thing, but maybe I was a little wrong. Brother Bam said, "We find now this evil age is to prove to Satan she is not like Eve, &gt;&gt; that she is not that type of woman. &gt;&gt; And she will be tried by his word." And the bride as Adam's bride was tried by the word. And Adam's bride believed every bit of the word, all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever today. See, but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face. And now the people that's called for his name, of course, is his bride. And she is to come in contact again by the same thing. Not by just denominational truth or something, but every word. &gt;&gt; Eve had one commandment to keep, and she fell away from it by reasoning, by lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, pride of life. Amen. Now, the fullness of the word has been restored to us. And how are WE GOING TO OVERCOME? Because the spirit of God is here to make sure. AMEN. BY HIS POWER, NOT BY MIGHT. AMEN. NOT BY STRENGTH, NOT BY MIGHT, BY POWER, BUT BY MY SPIRIT, sayeth the Lord. And the fullness of the word HAS BROUGHT THE FULLNESS OF HIS SPIRIT TO EMPOWER A BRIDE TO STAY WITH THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF YOU STAY WITH THE WORD, THE WORD WON'T FAIL. The word is eternal. It will come to pass. If you leave the word, YOU WILL FAIL. &gt;&gt; SO, HOW do we overcome in this Satan's Eden, IN THE DARKEST HOUR IN LEODYSIA WHERE CHRIST IS ON THE OUTSIDE KNOCKING THE TR? HOW DO WE OVERCOME IN THAT? WE OVERCOME BY STAYING with the word that's been delivered to us. &gt;&gt; Just stay with it. Just obey it. Just get under it. JUST PUT IT ON. JUST DON'T REASON IT. DON'T THINK about it. Just obey the word of God. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's all stand together. Amen. Musicians, if you'll please come forward. I just want to encourage you friends. If you find in you, Amen. something, if I've triggered something in your thought while preaching, if God has come and brought a conviction in you, you find there's a little bit of lust for something and I'm making a religious cloak. There's a little bit of pride and I'm hiding behind a religious cloak. I PRAY THAT GOD will pierce through your fig leaves right now &gt;&gt; and pierce through mine and yours and all of our re religious rhetoric and get DOWN TO OUR HEART AND SHOW US WHERE WE ARE SO WE CAN BE LIKE DAVID AND SAY, "GOD, it's me you were preaching to today. It's me. I've had TOO MUCH PRIDE. I'VE WANTED THIS JOB. I WANTED THIS POSITION. I WANTED THIS AND I was manipulating and moving and willing to COMPROMISE ON YOUR WORD TO HAVE WHAT I WANTED. BUT NOT ANYMORE. FROM this day forward, I'm going to take the word &gt;&gt; and surrender myself. I encourage you as we bow our heads. Amen. Lift your hands to God and say, "God, it's me. I'm the one. I have sinned. I have missed the mark. BUT GOD, WOULD YOU COME AND EMPOWER ME BY your spirit to stay with this word?" &gt;&gt; Let's just lift OUR VOICES TO GOD. DON'T LET ME be the only one praying, friends. You pray, too. Amen. Oh, GOD IN HEAVEN, WE LIFT our hands to you, Lord. And we ask, God, that you would forgive us, God. We've been tempted AND WE'VE BEEN TRIED. WE FIND THE LUST OF THE FLESH, THE PRIDE OF LIFE. I MEAN, THE THE THE THE PRIDE OF LIFE AND the lust OF THE EYES. GOD, IT'S ALL AROUND US. AND THIS OLD NATURE IS TRYING TO DRAG US THE WRONG WAY. BUT OH GOD, YOU HAVE GIVEN US ANOTHER DOSE OF YOUR word this morning. YOU HAVE OPENED OUR EYES TO THE TACTICS OF THE ENEMY, TRYING TO DECEIVE US INTO SOMETHING LIKE HE DID THE FIRST WOMAN. BUT OH GOD, THIS CHURCH ISN'T GOING TO BE DECEIVED BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT YOUR WORD IN FULL LIGHT. YOU'VE BROUGHT IT TO DISPEL ALL THE LIES OF THE ENEMY. AND GOD, WE RECEIVE IT NOW IN Jesus Christ's name. God, let your power come and fill us. LET YOUR WORD COME TO MANIFESTATION IN OUR LIVES. MAY WE BECOME THE VERY VESSELS THAT make this word live. &gt;&gt; May we PUT THE WORD ON. MAY IT BE OUR GARMENT, OUR CLOTHING. MAY WE BE DRESSED IN YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. LORD, BY YOUR GRACE YOU'VE GIVEN US IN THIS HOUR. YOU HAVE GIVEN US WAS YOUR WORD NOT TO MANIPULATE, NOT TO PLAY WITH, NOT TO IGNORE, BUT YOU'VE GIVEN US YOUR WORD TO GET BEHIND. IT'S OUR SECURITY, OUR SAFETY. IT'S OUR GUARANTEE. And God, may we TAKE IT AS A GUARANTEE, a promise, A PROMISE OF RESULTS, A PROMISE of overcoming. Wean us away from senses AND BRING US BACK TO PURE FAITH in your word. &gt;&gt; GIVE US WHAT THAT WOMAN AT THE WELL HAD. FORGIVE US WHAT THE WOMAN WHO WASHED HER FEET HAD. SOMETHING INSIDE OF US THAT COULD RECOGNIZE the word and surrender completely to it. God, forgive us for our failures. Forgive us for doing wrong. God, help us to withstand this temptation in the end time. For God, you have given us everything we need. For you have given us the fullness of your word. &gt;&gt; May we take it may we take it above our reasoning. May we take it above our desires, our personal fleshly desires. [music] May we take it above our pride. May we make that word our king, our Lord, our headship, our savior, our lover, our bridegroom, our husband. It's you, Lord Jesus. You've come to us in the fullness of your word to unite with us to be our headship so you might guide us through this final stage of the journey. For you've washed us with the water of your word, so you could present to yourself a bride having no spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such thing. Let the word do the work in us, Lord. Let the word discern our hearts, Lord. &gt;&gt; And when we come up in the balance and found lacking, Lord, may we just repent, Lord, and move back to your word, for that's where you want us to be. We love you. We ask your blessings over all that was said, over your children who have repentant hearts now. God, if there's anybody who hasn't experienced this baptism of the Holy Ghost, the quickening power to quicken them to life, that they have your power working on the inside to break them free from the lust that have bound them. I pray God that you would quicken them now. That that that Lord that they would reach out to you and they would open their heart and receive you, Lord. That you would fill them with your spirit. that you would transform them, that they would come forth as new creatures in Christ Jesus. God, for we know we have to be born again, God, our first birth is wrong. We must have another birth, a spiritual birth. And God, may you, may you grant it, Lord, according to the promise in your word, as we reach out to you. Fill us all fresh again with your spirit, with the power to overcome, to stay with the word, to surrender to it more and more. We love you, God. We ask for your blessings over all these things in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless you all. Riley, my hope is built on nothing [singing] less than Jesus blood and righteousness.
