[0:00] you know we we think these things all
[0:01] the time you know why do i have so many
[0:04] scars from living in sin why did i do so
[0:06] much why did i go so far well god could
[0:08] have stopped me anytime why didn't he
[0:10] stop me before
[0:14] maybe god wanted to show how deep he
[0:16] could pull a center out of sin
[0:19] maybe you're just displaying how his
[0:22] ability to save is stronger than anybody
[0:24] can imagine
[0:26] that god is a deliverer of every
[0:28] circumstance
[0:30] why did he let me go this way why did i
[0:32] have to go that far why did why didn't
[0:34] he stop me when this happened why did he
[0:36] stop me when that happened amen maybe
[0:38] god amen is just showing how mighty he
[0:41] is and how able he is to deliver and how
[0:44] able he is to save
[0:49] he so he says
[0:52] he let there be sin that he might be a
[0:54] savior he let there be sickness that he
[0:56] might be a healer he let there be hate
[0:58] that he might be love sure he did he's
[1:01] god and that's his attributes and he has
[1:03] to have something to display his
[1:06] attributes
[1:07] how would you ever know there was a
[1:09] night how would you ever know there was
[1:11] any if it was all day light how would
[1:13] you ever know there was a night there's
[1:15] a night so it could prove daylight sure
[1:17] there is
[1:18] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:20] revealed he goes on and he says now he
[1:22] could do that in adam and eve but sin
[1:24] separated them so now there had to be
[1:26] some way to get it back again oh my this
[1:29] is rich to me just even think of it see
[1:32] god had see what god's purpose was now
[1:36] why didn't he just keep adam and eve
[1:37] like that then he would never been able
[1:40] to express his fullness his full
[1:42] attribute
[1:44] because he could have been a father
[1:45] there that is true but also he's a
[1:47] savior
[1:49] how do you know he is he is because i've
[1:51] had the experience see he is a savior
[1:54] and he had to express that
[1:58] my question is is he still a healer
[2:01] does he still need to express it
[2:03] it's still a testimony to the devil that
[2:05] and then there's got to be sickness to
[2:07] prove that he's a healer
[2:09] is he still a delivery man
[2:12] is there still many are there still many
[2:14] afflictions for the righteous but
[2:15] there's still a god to deliver them out
[2:17] of them all
[2:18] then there must still be many
[2:20] afflictions so that he can prove he can
[2:21] deliver from them all
[2:24] not just some but all
[2:27] amen and how is god going to prove that
[2:30] who's he going to use
[2:32] if god still wants to prove his world to
[2:34] this word his word to this unbelieving
[2:36] world and he still wants to defeat dev
[2:39] the devil in every one of his uh
[2:41] every one of his lies he's going to have
[2:43] to lift his word up and prove his word
[2:46] where is he going to do that through
[2:48] what kind of flesh through which
[2:49] individuals will god prove that he's a
[2:51] deliverer that he's a healer amen that
[2:53] he's a savior where will god prove that
[2:55] amen he'll prove it and you and i
[3:00] so let's not allow the devil to bring
[3:02] confusion when troubles happen amen but
[3:05] let's allow amen the eagle anointing in
[3:08] this day to lift us above the carnal to
[3:10] get where the prophet of god has
[3:12] explained these things to us so that we
[3:14] can have proper understanding and say
[3:16] god has not forgotten me amen god has
[3:18] not forsaken me but god is perfecting me
[3:21] he's showing himself he is defeating the
[3:23] devil right now
