[3:15] pleasing oh lord
[3:18] [Music]
[3:22] amen
[3:26] just as we bow our heads to pray i'd
[3:28] like to read a
[3:30] scripture that's
[3:31] precious to me
[3:33] you can turn to it if you wish to it's
[3:34] not our text but psalm 69 verse 5 and 6.
[3:39] musicians you can be seated
[3:41] or you can go stand with the rest of
[3:43] them don't be seated yet
[3:45] god bless you greetings to each one of
[3:46] you here
[3:47] it's good to see
[3:51] our brother from arizona with us this
[3:53] evening
[3:54] and i know i'm speaking to several new
[3:55] faces that maybe have
[3:58] never spoken to or spoken with
[4:00] god bless you each one
[4:03] this has been my prayer for a
[4:06] long time psalms
[4:08] 69 verse 5 and 6
[4:10] oh god thou knowest my foolishness
[4:13] my sins are not hid from thee
[4:15] let not them that wait on thee o lord
[4:17] god of hosts be ashamed for my sake
[4:20] let not those that seek thee be
[4:22] confounded for my sake o god of israel
[4:26] because i stand up here
[4:28] knowing a lot of my faults and a lot of
[4:30] my failures and shortcomings and
[4:34] it would grieve me
[4:36] to uh to know something
[4:40] some of my shortcomings would too hinder
[4:43] the walk
[4:45] or a testimony
[4:46] of one of you or any of god's people
[4:49] even those out in the world
[4:52] to witness
[4:53] my faults and failures and shortcomings
[4:57] and
[4:58] we just want to
[5:00] stay surrendered that the lord can
[5:02] use us
[5:03] especially as i stand before you
[5:07] in an uncomfortable position
[5:09] all eyes upon me
[5:11] and it's easy to revert
[5:13] back to
[5:16] comfort zones that are not
[5:18] convenient for the gospel shall we say
[5:21] so let's just bow our heads and just ask
[5:23] the lord to
[5:25] take the service this evening
[5:27] heavenly father before we even
[5:30] look at our texts this evening
[5:33] we just want to come before your
[5:34] presence lord and just
[5:36] ask you to take the vessel lord
[5:38] on both sides of this pulpit lord
[5:41] and just help
[5:42] the speaker lord to be surrendered
[5:45] out of the way lord and
[5:47] may you take the insufficiencies and the
[5:49] faults and failures and everything that
[5:51] you've
[5:52] molded into this vessel lord by your
[5:55] choice choosing
[5:57] take those lord and get glory unto
[5:59] yourself through them lord
[6:01] and help me father god not to
[6:04] get ron garvin in the way tonight
[6:06] we just pray father that the people will
[6:08] be lifted up blessed helped
[6:10] benefited lord
[6:12] i pray that you'll answer prayers this
[6:13] evening i pray that the people have come
[6:16] expecting something from you not
[6:18] something from me lord but just
[6:20] expecting you to deliver lord even
[6:22] in spite
[6:24] of uh
[6:25] of who would be standing
[6:27] at the pulpit lord we just expect you to
[6:29] be standing here father so we just
[6:31] surrender this vessel lord to you and i
[6:33] pray father that each one out there lord
[6:35] be surrendered
[6:36] can get past their
[6:38] false failures and foibles lord and and
[6:41] they can receive
[6:42] what you have for them tonight lord and
[6:44] i pray that each one of us will be
[6:45] blessed this evening
[6:46] father you know i've got a lot on my
[6:47] heart
[6:48] and
[6:49] and not having the ability to deliver it
[6:51] lord to my satisfaction so i just want
[6:54] to step aside father and i just want you
[6:56] to
[6:58] use the vessel lord
[7:00] if you don't use the notes that's fine
[7:01] lord just use the vessel father for your
[7:03] honor and glory
[7:04] we ask it in jesus name amen
[7:08] praise the lord let's turn to our text
[7:09] while we're standing hebrews chapter 11.
[7:11] [Music]
[7:13] a couple of short scripture readings
[7:15] here
[7:17] hebrews chapter 11 verse 1.
[7:26] hebrews 11 1 says now faith is a
[7:28] substance of things hoped for the
[7:31] evidence of things not seen
[7:33] in hebrews 13 8
[7:37] very familiar scriptures
[7:39] not bringing anything new to you tonight
[7:42] maybe from just a little different angle
[7:44] hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same
[7:46] yesterday and today
[7:49] and forever amen
[7:51] may god's word bless us this evening you
[7:54] may be seated
[7:58] i just pray the lord to help me to tie
[8:00] these things together tonight or to get
[8:02] out of the way and let him tight tie
[8:04] these things together tonight
[8:05] first of all i wanted to apologize to
[8:07] brother kyle i never did get a little
[8:09] note sent to you to
[8:11] saying how much i appreciated
[8:12] wednesday's service
[8:14] and i was right on board with you from
[8:15] the very get-go
[8:18] sometimes we feel like we're bringing a
[8:19] repeat service from brother chad and
[8:22] that's what i feel like i'm doing
[8:24] but as brother kyle said we each bring
[8:27] our own unique perspective to it
[8:30] and if it takes
[8:33] three or four times for us to finally
[8:34] get it through our heads then that's the
[8:36] way it's got to be
[8:38] but
[8:39] paul said in in second corinthians 13 1
[8:41] says in the mouth of two or three
[8:42] witnesses shall every word be
[8:44] established
[8:45] so if i'm repeating what kyle repeated
[8:48] let it be established and i pray what i
[8:51] say is lining up with the word and what
[8:53] brother kyle says it doesn't matter if
[8:55] we line up with what brother chad says
[8:57] if it doesn't line up with the word then
[8:59] we're all off so let's not establish it
[9:02] two or three witnesses together that are
[9:03] off the word let's let's get it on the
[9:05] word
[9:06] and
[9:07] with the message of the hour
[9:08] and and then we can walk in confidence
[9:10] amen praise the lord
[9:13] so let's let this word be thoroughly
[9:15] established uh you know as i have gone
[9:17] over this for i guess a couple weeks now
[9:20] and uh today as i was uh out working on
[9:23] the roads and uh just going over this in
[9:25] my mind all day so
[9:27] somehow i've got to take my
[9:30] sermon that i perfected over eight hours
[9:32] of work
[9:33] and jam it in to just a little short
[9:35] time but there's there's no hope for
[9:37] that i don't even know that i can get
[9:39] all my notes in i mean if i just read
[9:41] through them it would be a short service
[9:42] but uh
[9:44] as i thought on it today it just
[9:48] became precious so let me just get out
[9:50] of the way and and
[9:52] somehow and just allow the lord to take
[9:54] this and i don't know if i'll be able to
[9:56] follow my
[9:57] my notes or not but but just let the
[10:00] lord have her have his liberty uh
[10:02] tonight now i wanted to give you just a
[10:04] little bit of background i haven't given
[10:06] you the title don't get impatient here
[10:08] uh some of you know me some of you don't
[10:10] um
[10:11] i guess those that don't will get to
[10:13] know me so here's a little background
[10:15] for the thought this evening see that
[10:18] brothers and sisters in pakistan
[10:20] they have weekly bible studies and i
[10:22] speak for them about once a month and
[10:24] usually always on a saturday morning
[10:26] well it was the end of july and on a
[10:29] friday morning before as i was leaving
[10:31] for work i checked my whatsapp
[10:33] and there was a text in there says uh
[10:35] could you speak for us on saturday
[10:37] now that gave me less than 24 hours to
[10:39] prepare for a service and i was totally
[10:40] unprepared
[10:41] i'd been busy at work just
[10:44] didn't have a chance to hardly listen to
[10:47] messages i took my message
[10:49] messages and listened to him in the
[10:50] truck while i'm driving a truck spraying
[10:51] tar
[10:52] and uh for the county roads and
[10:55] but sometimes i just have to unplug it
[10:57] because i'm just too focused on what i'm
[10:58] doing and too distracted so
[11:01] this is the way it had been for quite a
[11:03] while so i
[11:04] busy at work busy at home with a big
[11:06] project
[11:08] and here i've been asked to speak for
[11:10] bible study
[11:11] in less than 24 hours or a little over
[11:14] 24 hours i think it was
[11:16] i was totally unprepared
[11:17] and
[11:20] so i went to work and still i thought
[11:22] well i'll just
[11:23] just concentrate on the lord and just
[11:25] get a blessing from the lord today and
[11:26] see what i've got for the brothers and
[11:29] sisters on saturday morning
[11:30] still busy busy busy
[11:32] finally on the way home from work
[11:35] i thought
[11:36] what am i going to do
[11:37] i only have 24 hours left
[11:39] what am i going to do this title this
[11:42] thought came to my mind i'm going to use
[11:43] it for my title it's kind of a
[11:45] unorthodox which i guess is kind of a
[11:48] common place for me
[11:50] the title for tonight is don't
[11:53] do not
[11:55] don't
[11:56] fake it
[11:57] or make it
[11:59] perhaps you've heard that slogan before
[12:01] had a good minister friend that i was
[12:03] told that used to use say that quite a
[12:05] bit fake it till you make it
[12:07] and a good friend of mine
[12:09] and i don't know that i ever heard him
[12:10] say that but that was
[12:12] what i'd heard somebody
[12:14] tell me that was kind of his slogan fake
[12:16] it till you make it and
[12:19] well maybe what he meant by that was
[12:21] claim the promise until you receive it
[12:22] and i'll agree with him on that
[12:25] but
[12:26] as i was preparing for a service
[12:29] for a bible study
[12:31] the thought came to my mind you know you
[12:33] can fake it till you make it but
[12:35] i don't want to do that
[12:36] so let's examine this a little bit
[12:38] tonight uh you know we're all familiar
[12:40] with brother branham's testimony when he
[12:43] was he had a stomach ulcer and he was
[12:44] still living at home with his parents
[12:46] and
[12:47] he claimed his healing and he had eaten
[12:50] i think he had eaten soup beans and
[12:51] onions or something like that he'd
[12:54] swallow that down and i think he maybe
[12:55] vomited it up and just
[12:57] shove it back down and his mother says
[13:00] are you okay so i'm fine
[13:02] now that is that faking it till you make
[13:04] it well he was claiming the promises we
[13:07] want to examine the difference claim the
[13:09] promise even though you don't have the
[13:11] evidence
[13:12] it's not there before you whether it's a
[13:13] physical healing or whatever your need
[13:15] is
[13:16] claim it
[13:17] if there's a promise for it claim it
[13:19] don't fake it
[13:20] we don't want to fake the promise let's
[13:22] claim the promise
[13:24] we also familiar with the blind man that
[13:25] brother branham prayed for and uh
[13:28] brother bram said well you just keep on
[13:30] he said well i'm not healed he went
[13:31] through the prayer line i think he went
[13:32] through twice he said you said you
[13:34] healed me he said well you said you
[13:35] believed me
[13:36] well what do i do i can't see i'm still
[13:38] blind we'll keep claiming your healing
[13:41] so praise the lord i'm healed blind as a
[13:43] bat praise the lord i'm healed blind as
[13:46] a bat
[13:46] now that's not faking it that's
[13:48] believing it
[13:50] faking it
[13:51] would he go would we go get in the car
[13:53] and say i can see i can see as good as
[13:55] anybody else i'm taking off that's
[13:57] faking me because he couldn't see but he
[13:59] was claiming it and he claimed it big
[14:01] till he became the laughing stock of the
[14:03] town but he stood on that promise until
[14:05] it came to pass
[14:07] now we admire someone who stands in the
[14:08] word and claims the promises but i want
[14:10] to draw a distinction between claiming
[14:12] the promises and faking it
[14:14] faith is the substance
[14:17] now maybe we can't really understand
[14:19] that maybe i i don't well here we here
[14:21] we go right here's a good example just
[14:23] use myself as an example
[14:25] i'm not gonna fake it and claim that i
[14:27] understand this
[14:28] faith is a substance you know i can't
[14:31] hold on to faith a substance is
[14:32] something you you can touch and feel in
[14:34] my mind you know faith is a substance
[14:36] but there's a reality to it that is more
[14:40] more real
[14:41] than what you can touch
[14:43] do i understand it with my human mind no
[14:45] i'm not going to fake it but i'm going
[14:47] to claim it faith is a substance
[14:49] things hope for the evidence of things
[14:51] not seen
[14:52] so what's the difference between fake
[14:54] and faith
[14:55] well it's got a snappy little you know
[14:57] my title's got a snappy little uh
[14:59] rhythm to it you'll fake it till you
[15:01] make it so it's an easy little slogan to
[15:03] have there
[15:04] uh
[15:06] so uh but what brought that to mine was
[15:08] you know being having that bible study
[15:10] looking me in the face less than 24
[15:12] hours to prepare
[15:14] what do i do i had some options before
[15:16] me i could decline the invitation and
[15:19] they would accept that i've done that
[15:20] before when i was going to be out of
[15:22] town
[15:24] these
[15:25] bible studies over skype skype meetings
[15:27] so i had to cancel one so i could cancel
[15:30] uh or i could manufacture a bible study
[15:33] you know fake it
[15:34] or i could admit to the brothers that i
[15:37] just don't have anything i i don't have
[15:39] anything just be honest
[15:41] so i hated to decline but
[15:43] even worse than that would be to fake it
[15:46] and that's when this little saying came
[15:48] to mind and i began to examine the
[15:50] fallacy of the statement and that's what
[15:52] uh
[15:53] when viewed from that standpoint that uh
[15:56] not just claiming it but faking it we
[15:57] don't want to do that
[15:59] so
[16:00] i suppose we're all familiar with
[16:01] brother branham's prayer lines and how
[16:02] he stood helpless until the angel of the
[16:04] lord showed up
[16:06] he'd say i can do nothing he'd just kind
[16:07] of him all around and he'd say you know
[16:09] i'm you know i'm i'm stalling i forget
[16:11] how how i express it there you know i'm
[16:13] i'm waiting i'm waiting on something i
[16:15] can't do anything you know if he doesn't
[16:17] come then we'll just uh we'll just have
[16:18] a prayer line and bring it through and
[16:20] lay hands on you
[16:22] why would you try to fake discernment
[16:25] you can't fake that
[16:28] he knew better than that
[16:29] he just admitted that he was helpless
[16:33] you know the human
[16:35] thing to do is to kind of press on
[16:37] because we don't want to lose space
[16:39] and so we just press on you know and
[16:42] somebody says well you're going the
[16:43] wrong way well
[16:45] you get out here on the interstate i'm
[16:46] supposed to head south on 75 and i make
[16:49] the wrong turn and
[16:50] heading north and my wife says uh aren't
[16:53] we going the wrong way i know
[16:55] i know exactly what i'm doing
[16:57] here comes beaver dam you know way out
[16:58] of way out of the way
[17:01] now that didn't really happen
[17:03] but
[17:04] i have made the wrong turn before well
[17:06] what are you going to do you're going to
[17:07] fake it yeah i planned to come down this
[17:09] way i had to check something out you
[17:11] know
[17:12] you're going to fake it
[17:13] or just admit it say yeah i did i think
[17:16] i better find an exit and get back on
[17:17] the right road let's be honest
[17:21] not just fake it till you make it
[17:22] because you may not make it if you're
[17:23] going the wrong direction
[17:25] so
[17:30] so we could
[17:31] manufacture a bible study you could
[17:33] imitate
[17:34] the anointing of the lord impersonate an
[17:36] anointing uh you could stir up the
[17:38] people's emotions with psychology and uh
[17:42] and maybe they'd never know that you was
[17:43] just you know flying by the seat of your
[17:45] pants
[17:47] so i started out this bible study with
[17:49] the pakistan when this
[17:51] thought came to me
[17:53] and it ended up developing over just a
[17:55] few hours i was put it together and
[17:57] i wasn't faking it i was walking in
[17:59] faith at that point god's given me a
[18:01] thought and i'm just going to get up
[18:02] there and i'm going to express it to him
[18:03] the best i know how and that's what i'm
[18:04] doing tonight i got a lot more notes but
[18:06] still i don't know how to put them
[18:08] together i don't know how to touch each
[18:09] heart here but he does so if i can just
[18:11] get out of the way and allow him to do
[18:12] it then he'll touch touch the need
[18:16] so speaking to the pakistanis i wanted
[18:18] to make sure the interpreter was on the
[18:19] same page with me
[18:21] so i make sure he understands my title
[18:23] says do you know what fake is he says oh
[18:25] yes yes
[18:26] fake that is the substance of things
[18:29] hoped for the evidence no no the god got
[18:31] the wrong fake f-a-k-e fake not faith so
[18:35] i explained it to him and as you begin
[18:36] to explain
[18:37] what fake means means
[18:40] it becomes ever more apparent
[18:42] why we do not want to fake it till we
[18:44] make it
[18:47] so we're going to look at a definition
[18:48] of that
[18:51] it's not appropriate for christian to
[18:53] fake it until he makes it definition of
[18:55] fake not genuine
[18:58] counterfeit a forgery or sham
[19:01] the opposite of genuine if there's
[19:03] anything we need in this day and age is
[19:05] genuine
[19:06] we need we do we don't need fake it's
[19:08] just a hindrance to the move of god
[19:11] if you're sitting here as a fake
[19:12] christian tonight
[19:15] don't leave this building in that same
[19:16] condition
[19:17] you say well i can't do it well
[19:19] you're on the right road now because
[19:21] you're admitting that
[19:23] quit faking it admit it and and get down
[19:25] to business with god and he'll uh he'll
[19:27] take care of the rest of it
[19:29] a few synonyms for fake

[19:33] copy sham fraud hoax imitation
[19:37] fraudulent

[19:49] alter
[19:50] or tamper with
[19:53] you don't want that to be your testimony
[19:56] is that our testimony with this word of
[19:58] god are we altering it are we doctoring
[20:00] it
[20:00] so many people can be a fake
[20:03] message believer
[20:05] but to do that they have to alter the
[20:08] message
[20:09] i'm a message believer i go to a message
[20:10] church but
[20:11] that doesn't apply to me
[20:13] i don't need to fulfill that that's not
[20:16] for me this is not my time that's not to
[20:18] be manifested through
[20:20] let's not alter it let's not tamper with
[20:22] it
[20:23] it's not doctored up
[20:25] is there anything that you've heard in
[20:26] that definition so far that would
[20:28] inspire you yes i want to fake it till i
[20:31] make it i don't think there's anything
[20:33] that was uh would be uh
[20:35] uh inspiring us to do that
[20:38] um
[20:39] you know
[20:41] the way i've seen the lord move he'll
[20:43] just uh through me
[20:45] it's not me but just it's just the way
[20:47] he
[20:48] i guess i guess it's every minister but
[20:51] it's always uh
[20:53] stands out to me when he does it
[20:55] takes his finger
[20:56] and puts it right on a sore spot
[20:59] and uh and i'm the tip of that finger
[21:01] you know and it
[21:02] touches so if it touches a sore spot
[21:04] tonight
[21:06] that's him speaking to you
[21:08] he doesn't want fake christians if
[21:09] that's the way you're doing if that's
[21:11] the way you're living
[21:12] uh well let's just go ahead and push on
[21:14] that sore spot a little bit because we
[21:15] don't want you going out of here like
[21:16] that i don't want to meet i don't want
[21:18] me going out here like that
[21:21] so another way to phrase this and fake
[21:22] it till you make it another way to
[21:24] phrase it would be impersonate a
[21:25] christian until you become a christian
[21:28] that doesn't sound very uh
[21:31] good pretend you have the holy ghost
[21:32] until you get the holy ghost
[21:34] why
[21:35] don't do that act like something you're
[21:37] not until you become what you are what
[21:39] you're pretending pretending to be
[21:42] imitate your healing before healing
[21:44] before it happens
[21:45] uh my titles don't do that don't fake it
[21:48] till you make it don't be an
[21:50] impersonator don't be a pretender a liar
[21:52] a pharisee a hypocrite
[21:53] a fake an imposter a counterfeit uh we
[21:58] can fake a physical healing
[22:00] but that's just a hoax
[22:01] you know we can say well i've injured my
[22:03] leg but it's all better and i just walk
[22:05] like this because i like this swagger no
[22:09] uh
[22:09] it's just a it's just a hoax it's a
[22:11] fraud
[22:12] you're falsifying the truth you're
[22:14] you're duping the people and people see
[22:16] through that
[22:18] they see through it it's worthless that
[22:20] was part of our death definitions a dud
[22:22] anybody want to be a dud you know back
[22:24] in
[22:25] back when i was in school the big uh
[22:27] big uh
[22:30] insult to people was to say a loser you
[22:32] big loser
[22:34] uh you big dud
[22:35] i guess that probably goes back before
[22:37] my time but it's all one and the same
[22:39] anybody here want to be a dead a dead
[22:41] christian a dead believer
[22:43] we don't want to fake
[22:45] being anointed for the preaching
[22:47] we don't want to get up and pretend like
[22:49] we've got a message from the lord and
[22:50] just
[22:51] stir the people up and uh
[22:55] jump up and down and and pretend like
[22:57] we're something and god's done something
[22:59] for us and he's got something to speak
[23:01] god has set
[23:02] the gifts in order
[23:04] brother branham set the gifts in order
[23:08] speaking in tongues is to bring a
[23:10] a direct message to the people
[23:12] not just up there entertaining
[23:15] and the
[23:16] the pentecostals could not mature they
[23:19] could not accept that and so they
[23:20] rejected him partly for that
[23:23] we don't want to we don't want that to
[23:25] be the way the ministry is either
[23:27] just getting up here and
[23:29] entertaining you and letting myself or
[23:31] the minister whoever he is get in the
[23:33] way and entertain the people god's got
[23:36] something he wants to speak
[23:38] now let's get out of the way and let him
[23:39] do so and if you haven't got something
[23:41] to speak then just admit it and sit down
[23:44] you say well i would i want to save face
[23:47] not in this situation you don't want to
[23:49] save face
[23:50] you better be honest
[23:52] to be a sham or a con artist that's
[23:54] which is what you would be up here you
[23:56] know you
[23:57] we
[23:58] familiar with the
[23:59] snake oil salesman back in the old days
[24:02] travel around with their wagon had to
[24:04] cure all for everything and that's just
[24:06] a con artist just a sham
[24:09] that's got no place in god's economy
[24:11] especially not behind the pulpit
[24:15] we want to pretend to have the mind of
[24:17] christ on a subject you know it's so
[24:19] easy people come up
[24:21] you know if you're a minister if you're
[24:22] traveling overseas and
[24:24] brother what should i do about this
[24:26] situation you know uh well well brother
[24:29] tell you what you need to do you know
[24:30] we've always got the mind of christ for
[24:32] the other person uh now when it comes to
[24:34] our own situation what i do what do i do
[24:36] but oh brother what you need to do you
[24:37] you need to move here you need to move
[24:39] there you need to go here you need to do
[24:40] this
[24:41] as if god has spoken that directly to us
[24:44] now maybe he has if so then speak it but
[24:47] don't be a fraud
[24:49] don't be a pretender don't be a fake
[24:51] don't fake it till you make it i know
[24:53] exactly what you need to do you're
[24:54] faking it
[24:56] if you're faking it don't do that
[24:57] uh it's that's a dead it's worthless uh
[25:00] you lead somebody astray just like the
[25:02] scripture you read in uh
[25:04] psalm 69
[25:07] your
[25:09] fear of losing face
[25:11] is going to be a stumbling block to
[25:12] somebody because when they follow your
[25:15] uh leadership because that brother had
[25:17] the mind of the lord for me and i've
[25:18] went done this and i wasn't done that
[25:20] and it all falls apart and you're left
[25:22] there holding the pieces
[25:24] how can you ever have faith in that
[25:26] brother again
[25:28] it's worthless
[25:30] be genuine the opposite of fake admit
[25:32] you don't have the mind of the lord if
[25:33] you don't if you do speak it speak it in
[25:35] confidence
[25:38] with two or three witnesses bring it
[25:39] back to the bible bring it back to the
[25:41] word so well the word says brother
[25:44] god can use an honest vessel to speak
[25:46] through and i pray that he does that
[25:48] tonight
[25:50] brother branham didn't pretend to be
[25:52] able to discern the thoughts of people's
[25:54] hearts
[25:55] there's no need to be a fake with that
[25:57] that was a genuine gift it was god's
[25:59] gift it was god operated it
[26:01] it wasn't brother branham's gift it
[26:03] wasn't now i understand what i'm saying
[26:05] here he had the gift but he didn't go
[26:07] acquire that gift
[26:09] god gave that gift to him and that was
[26:12] god's gift
[26:13] to the people through him using him but
[26:16] he could not just operate that by
[26:18] himself he just had to rely upon the
[26:19] lord and he was honest enough
[26:23] to say i can do nothing until he comes
[26:26] and does it through me
[26:29] and we find ourselves in the same
[26:30] position
[26:31] no matter if you're behind the pope or
[26:33] if you're out there whatever you're
[26:34] doing in life it isn't our
[26:35] responsibility to manufacture the holy
[26:38] ghost or any of the gifts of the holy
[26:40] ghost it's not up to us to manufacture
[26:42] our healing
[26:44] our faith
[26:46] uh our revelation we're supposed to pray
[26:48] for revelation
[26:49] brother braham didn't say go
[26:51] conjure up your revelation don't go
[26:53] manufacture your revelation don't go
[26:55] work it up he said pray for it
[26:59] so it's not our responsibility to bring
[27:01] revelation to ourself well if i study
[27:03] this message and i read through it and i
[27:05] dissect it and i
[27:06] work diagram at night
[27:09] you're getting nowhere you're wasting
[27:11] your time
[27:12] go back to the beginning brother brown
[27:13] said if you study a flower for afra he
[27:16] was at 30 minutes sincerely you know
[27:18] more than they could teach in the sunday
[27:20] in the seminaries
[27:22] you know more about god
[27:24] if you just approach things in the right
[27:26] manner
[27:27] it's god's responsibility to keep his
[27:29] word not you
[27:30] just like a wife is not responsible to
[27:33] run out and provide for the man and
[27:36] we understand those situations come come
[27:38] up sometimes the man's able not able to
[27:41] or whatever and the wife has to step in
[27:42] there and help but it's not
[27:44] it's not her responsibility to to do all
[27:46] the work and to defend the man and
[27:48] and
[27:50] as a wife of jesus christ we we're not
[27:53] responsible to make his words come true
[27:57] if the husband gives his word to
[27:59] somebody
[28:00] it's not the wife's responsibility to
[28:02] keep that word
[28:03] he gave his word he needs to be do you
[28:05] want to keep it
[28:06] and if god give his word
[28:08] it's not for us to try to manufacture
[28:12] so if he calls a man to the ministry
[28:15] it's god's responsibility to give him
[28:16] something to say
[28:17] it's god's responsibility to touch the
[28:20] hearts of the people through that gift
[28:22] if it's uh if it's just a man up there
[28:24] faking it
[28:25] you know maybe you'll fool some people
[28:28] maybe you'll
[28:31] maybe you'll do something
[28:33] but in an eternal sense
[28:36] what good is it
[28:39] our responsibility is to be surrendered
[28:41] for his use
[28:43] it's not our responsibility to be uh
[28:45] manufacturing a sermon coming up with
[28:47] something to say because i know that
[28:48] brother's going through this hard time
[28:50] and this sister's doing this and and
[28:52] we've got this situation in the church
[28:53] and i need to to get up there and solve
[28:55] it for the lord that's that's
[28:57] useless
[28:59] you say well shouldn't you do a little
[29:01] bit of studying and praying well i think
[29:02] that's part of being surrendered
[29:04] but our faith and our confidence doesn't
[29:06] come in our ability to pray
[29:07] or to study
[29:09] it's solely upon his calling and that's
[29:12] that's all i can say because
[29:14] the closer i get to coming out for the
[29:16] pulpit you know all
[29:18] had a wonderful time thinking on these
[29:20] notes today and i couldn't wait to
[29:22] deliver them and i sat back there and
[29:23] the time draws near and i think this is
[29:26] a shambles how am i how in the world am
[29:28] i going to get it all together it's not
[29:30] my responsibility
[29:31] it's his
[29:32] he's called me
[29:34] it's his responsibility to use the gift
[29:35] as he would
[29:36] you as he would desire to
[29:39] my responsibility just to get out of the
[29:40] way let him let him do it
[29:42] then i can rest
[29:44] are you a little nervous brother on well
[29:46] yeah there is always that element there
[29:47] but
[29:48] i can nervously rest somehow
[29:52] but we're not going to get up here and
[29:53] fake it till we make it
[29:55] he's already made it for us
[29:57] amen that's where our faith is that he
[29:59] has already made it
[30:02] in trying to get the concept of this uh
[30:05] little slogan over to the brothers of
[30:06] pakistan i used this example
[30:09] i thought that it'd be something they
[30:10] could understand
[30:11] so why would i
[30:13] counterfeit if i was going to go to
[30:15] pakistan why would i make a counterfeit
[30:16] passport
[30:18] i've got i've got the real thing
[30:20] it's genuine it's approved it's been
[30:22] used it's it's good
[30:24] it will work
[30:26] why would i go forge one why would i
[30:28] make a counterfeit one why would i fake
[30:29] one if i've got the genuine article why
[30:33] the only reason you would need to forge
[30:35] a document like that
[30:36] is if you're unable to get the genuine
[30:38] article
[30:39] and the only reason you could not get a
[30:41] genuine passport
[30:43] is maybe you're not qualified
[30:46] well you can get qualified maybe you're
[30:49] an immigrant or uh maybe you don't have
[30:51] all your
[30:52] proper documentations but if you follow
[30:54] them if you just go to the website there
[30:56] and you follow the rules fill out all
[30:58] the documents send them in all the
[30:59] proper
[31:00] things and and you're an upstanding
[31:03] citizen a competent individual a law
[31:05] abiding
[31:07] there's no reason you cannot get
[31:09] a genuine us passport
[31:12] i don't know all the qualifications for
[31:14] those but
[31:15] i don't see any reason why you couldn't
[31:17] maybe you've got something in your past
[31:19] there's ways to get those things cleared
[31:21] from your record and and become a and
[31:24] get a passport
[31:26] so if
[31:27] just go about it legally then you don't
[31:29] have to worry when you go to the when
[31:30] you go to the airport and you hand that
[31:32] to them when i arrived in pakistan and
[31:35] you hand it to the guy and he gets it
[31:37] out he's got his magnifying glasses on
[31:39] he puts it under the light he really
[31:41] examines that and he looks you in the
[31:43] eye and he looks back at that he looks
[31:44] you in the eye
[31:45] there was no nervousness on my part i'm
[31:47] not faking it that's the genuine article
[31:50] if he's got a problem with that then he
[31:51] needs to talk to the state department he
[31:53] needs to talk to the to whoever issued
[31:55] he doesn't need to talk to me that's not
[31:56] my problem
[31:58] if he's got a problem with it then we
[31:59] gotta we gotta go somewhere else
[32:01] uh so i could go with confidence
[32:03] i didn't have to wet uh sweat it out or
[32:06] or worry
[32:07] that uh this is not gonna go through but
[32:09] if you've got a forged document
[32:11] you just hope your forgery is sufficient
[32:14] to get you through
[32:15] now you may forge a document here and be
[32:17] able to pass it through
[32:20] but you're not going to forge
[32:22] your christianity you're not going to
[32:24] fake your christianity and slip that
[32:25] past the lord you may get it past you
[32:27] know i could probably print a
[32:30] a fake dollar bill on a good printer and
[32:33] i might be able to see one of you just
[32:35] pass it off to you and you'd well you
[32:37] just trust me and take it
[32:38] and go on but you know anybody that's
[32:41] really trained would would understand
[32:43] that that's not a real dollar bill you
[32:45] know that's
[32:46] that's just on
[32:47] cardboard you know whatever it is and uh
[32:50] you i may fool you but you're not gonna
[32:52] fool somebody that knows anything about
[32:54] it you know somebody works at a bank or
[32:56] or the uh you know the treasury
[32:58] department you're not gonna fool them
[32:59] and you're not gonna fool
[33:01] the lord with your fake
[33:03] uh christianity
[33:05] you may fool me and i said well that's
[33:07] that's a really good brother he just is
[33:08] so attentive in church and he just
[33:10] really amens and he's really responsive
[33:12] to the word and he's just all about it
[33:14] and he just he's right there for all the
[33:16] things and
[33:17] you may fool me
[33:19] but are really are you who you need to
[33:21] get this approved by
[33:23] you don't need to you don't need to uh
[33:25] get my
[33:26] recommendation to get into heaven we've
[33:28] gotta we've gotta pass this by the judge
[33:31] the lord he knows
[33:33] he knows all the time that that you're
[33:35] just faking it
[33:36] kinda like adam and eve faking
[33:39] their but he knew what was what their
[33:40] condition was
[33:44] so if you just follow all the rules
[33:46] sign all the documents send all the
[33:48] proper documentation in to get your
[33:50] passport you'll get it just trust rest
[33:53] rest is the thing now i know
[33:56] bureaucracy takes a long time to
[33:59] grind around full circle and
[34:02] but if you've filled out everything just
[34:03] just rest don't get impatient because
[34:06] it'll take a couple weeks to get it and
[34:08] don't say i've got to have it i've got
[34:10] to have it now i've got to go print my
[34:11] own i've got to make my own i've got to
[34:12] forge it just rest
[34:14] just rest
[34:16] same thing with the promises of god
[34:18] if you filled out all the if you've done
[34:20] everything that the book says
[34:22] and you've left no stone unturned
[34:24] rest
[34:26] rest on it
[34:27] then you can claim the promise don't
[34:29] fake it say i've got a promise right
[34:31] here it says it says i'm healed it says
[34:34] i'm i've
[34:35] he's promised the holy ghost to me he's
[34:36] promised whatever it is that that you're
[34:38] claiming if you can see it in there you
[34:40] can claim it
[34:41] just rest let him bring it to pass don't
[34:43] try to go out and manufacture and say
[34:45] well i haven't seen you i'm praying for
[34:47] the holy ghost i just haven't seen so
[34:48] i'm going to get up speaking tongues
[34:49] this sunday and i just i've been
[34:50] practicing you're faking it
[34:53] quit that nonsense
[34:56] rest in the lord rest in him
[34:59] takes a while for government to further
[35:01] bureaucracy to
[35:03] finally get that passport back to you
[35:04] but when you get it back it's the
[35:06] genuine article you don't have any
[35:07] worries about it
[35:10] let the lord fulfill his promises
[35:13] then you don't have to worry about it
[35:14] you don't have to if you if you're
[35:17] praying for a physical healing you don't
[35:18] have to imitate them oh i'm i'm better
[35:21] i'm better yeah this this limp is just
[35:23] uh because i kind of got used to it kind
[35:25] of liked it no
[35:26] there'll be no limp you know if god
[35:28] touches you and heals you in that way
[35:29] just
[35:30] just rest on the lord then you don't
[35:31] have to fake anything
[35:35] just follow the procedures
[35:39] the only reason you can't receive a
[35:40] promise from god maybe you're ineligible
[35:43] see there are qualifications
[35:46] uh
[35:48] you want to receive the holy ghost
[35:49] there's a promise for it
[35:51] but you've got to follow the procedures
[35:53] been baptized repented first
[35:56] not penance we don't do penance
[35:58] repentance
[36:00] repent turn from your ways
[36:02] claim that promise is there any stone
[36:04] left unturned
[36:05] uh
[36:06] or do you you know
[36:08] there's a lot of things a lot of
[36:10] documents you've got to do when you when
[36:11] you send off a passport you've got oh i
[36:14] don't know
[36:15] birth certificates and all these records
[36:17] and stuff you've got to send in and and
[36:18] you've got to have a
[36:20] sealed envelope and a self addressed and
[36:22] all the postage paid and that may be for
[36:24] the uh i think i know you have to do
[36:27] that when you're applying for a visa but
[36:28] there's there's procedures that you've
[36:30] got to go through you can't just
[36:32] write on a post you know a sticky note
[36:34] says hey i'd like to have a passport
[36:36] send it off to him it ain't gonna pass
[36:38] well maybe you do follow procedures
[36:40] you'll get it
[36:41] hey hey lord i'd like to have the holy
[36:43] ghost that'd be great you know i'd
[36:45] that'd be that'd be kind of neat
[36:47] you can have it you got to follow the
[36:49] procedures
[36:51] don't leave any stone left unturned when
[36:54] i'm sending off that kind of stuff to go
[36:56] overseas i'm reading through there and
[36:58] re-reading through there and have i
[36:59] missed anything i've got have i got
[37:01] everything have i sent in the right
[37:03] money order in am i
[37:04] and it kind of makes you a little bit
[37:06] nervous have i got everything right but
[37:08] when you get everything right then you
[37:10] can rest
[37:12] you put it in the mail and you just rest
[37:14] you wait
[37:15] upon the lord to uh up on
[37:17] well wait upon the lord to bring it back
[37:19] to you when you're doing a applying for
[37:21] a visa
[37:23] because there's no guarantee that you're
[37:24] going to get a visa but i can rest when
[37:26] i send off for a visa
[37:28] because that's kind of dependent on the
[37:29] country that you're going to it's like
[37:31] whether they'll accept you or not and i
[37:34] said well if they don't then it's not
[37:35] the lord's will but if god wants me to
[37:37] go they'll accept it i don't care how
[37:39] tarnished my record is or whatever they
[37:41] don't like about it uh he'll pass it
[37:43] through so we can we can rest on that
[37:49] you know if you get
[37:50] impatient and you forge
[37:52] a passport that's one of the things
[37:54] that'll disqualify you from getting a
[37:56] genuine passport
[37:57] don't go forward you wonder
[37:59] wonder if that would also disqualify us
[38:01] from getting the holy ghost
[38:03] we go forging
[38:05] faking
[38:06] uh committing fraud
[38:08] getting up and pretending like we're
[38:10] something
[38:12] that may just disqualify us you know and
[38:13] i didn't think about that till now
[38:17] if you're just faking it
[38:19] god may just let you fake it until you
[38:22] get tired of it
[38:23] and finally come to him say lord i gotta
[38:25] be honest i haven't got the goods i
[38:28] don't have what i want i'm tired of
[38:30] faking it lord give me the real deal
[38:32] now you can rest because you finally
[38:34] become genuine
[38:36] you finally become honest
[38:39] amen
[38:43] my original thought for the pakistani
[38:45] bible study was i don't want to pretend
[38:47] to have a bible study if god if god's
[38:49] not giving me one if he doesn't do
[38:51] something for me i
[38:52] i've either got to cancel
[38:55] or i've got to just get up and say well
[38:56] god bless you brothers
[38:58] god hasn't given me anything let's not
[39:00] let's not fake it uh you know as a as a
[39:03] minister there's always a pressure there
[39:04] you've got to get
[39:05] you've got to have a sermon you know if
[39:07] if brother chad asked you could you
[39:09] speak for us
[39:10] well uh
[39:11] yeah sure now i've got to go manufacture
[39:13] something no you don't you better not
[39:16] yeah if god doesn't give it then be
[39:19] better off just get up here and say god
[39:21] bless you saints
[39:22] god is good he hasn't given me anything
[39:25] i don't know what you do but but let's
[39:27] not be faking it amen
[39:30] you know you can get up here and use
[39:32] your impressive preacher's voice i need
[39:34] to practice on that one i guess maybe we
[39:36] could fool the people
[39:37] uh get up here and be dynamic i'd have
[39:40] to practice that one too jump around
[39:41] whatever
[39:44] maybe i'd fool somebody
[39:46] but i think you would probably all see
[39:48] right through that
[39:50] and i think you'd be kind enough to pray
[39:51] for me
[39:55] brother branham didn't fake his gift
[39:58] he was helpless to discern the thoughts
[40:00] of people and he admitted to that
[40:03] hidden he'd say i'm just waiting for the
[40:04] angel to come
[40:07] brother branham had a lot of
[40:08] contemporaries in the uh
[40:11] healing ministries in the temp
[40:12] ministries uh when he was on earth
[40:15] and
[40:16] at the same time it seemed like their
[40:18] ministries were
[40:20] bigger
[40:21] better
[40:22] more powerful more impressive
[40:25] and i wonder how much that was just fake
[40:28] because
[40:30] you know
[40:31] i don't know how true it is but you hear
[40:34] stories where this one fell that one
[40:36] fell this one went here this went there
[40:38] just up there faking it
[40:41] drawing people because there was a
[40:42] spirit on the on the land at that time
[40:44] and and the spirit of god was moving and
[40:47] and men just tapped into that and got up
[40:49] there and faked it and
[40:51] made a name for themselves and they
[40:52] still do today
[40:54] and they could even do it right here in
[40:56] the
[40:56] in the message of the hour
[40:58] and uh
[40:59] make a name for yourself
[41:01] and impress people
[41:04] and pull people but it's worthless if
[41:07] it's not from the lord
[41:10] but satan puts a pressure
[41:12] on a minister to perform
[41:14] i suppose he puts it on all of us as a
[41:16] christian to perform you've got to be
[41:18] there you've got to get to the prayer
[41:19] meeting you got
[41:21] you got
[41:21] you need to sit on the front row you
[41:23] just so you stand up everybody see how
[41:25] religious you are and uh you know
[41:28] people's got to see this and uh he puts
[41:30] a pressure on us to perform like a like
[41:32] a high pressure salesman
[41:34] but we don't have to jump through the
[41:35] devil's hoops
[41:36] you know bose moses didn't remember when
[41:39] janus and jambers
[41:40] uh
[41:41] performed the same miracle that he did
[41:43] uh brother branham said in the anointed
[41:45] ones at the end time it says did moses
[41:47] fuss at him and say here here you can't
[41:49] do that i'm the only one been ordained
[41:51] to do that here you stop that right now
[41:53] he just let him go
[41:55] let him go on remember the bible said as
[41:57] their followers made manifest so will
[41:59] these in the last day be made manifest
[42:01] when the bride is raptured and taken
[42:03] into the sky
[42:07] there's no need to jump through the
[42:08] devil's hoops we don't we don't have to
[42:10] say you know hey you you minister you
[42:12] can't be doing that you're preaching the
[42:13] message you you can't do that that's not
[42:16] our job
[42:17] let's just be genuine and do what god's
[42:19] called us to do
[42:20] and and god will make manifest
[42:22] the true and the false
[42:24] a couple of quotes from uh
[42:27] 1953 series israel in the church
[42:30] brother braham says let's go back now
[42:32] and get the beginning and find out how
[42:33] sure this word is
[42:35] now bear this in mind as we glean
[42:37] through this bible you'll see that the
[42:38] cogs of god's wheels turn slow but sure
[42:41] may look like it's a million miles away
[42:43] but she's grinding right up there all
[42:44] the time and one of these days it'll be
[42:47] here in a couple services later still in
[42:49] that same series he said god's word must
[42:51] every time be fulfilled
[42:53] we could preach on that that is just an
[42:55] astounding statement so that's pretty
[42:57] simple but let that soak in god's word
[43:00] must every time be fulfilled if he's
[43:01] promised in his word
[43:03] that there will be a bride there's going
[43:05] to be a bride
[43:06] if he's promised
[43:08] whatever it is that you have need of
[43:10] it's going to come to pass it's his word
[43:12] the cogs of god's prophecy grind slow
[43:14] but sure
[43:15] if you do wrong you think you're getting
[43:17] by but just remember young man or woman
[43:20] it's going to grind right up to your
[43:21] door one of these days you wonder when
[43:23] and how but it'll be there you'll reap
[43:25] what you sow every time god spoke it
[43:27] it's got to be so
[43:28] thy word is settled in heaven forever
[43:31] it's already said
[43:32] i love this statement here they don't
[43:34] argue about it up there it's already
[43:36] settled we argue about it but in glory
[43:38] it's settled we may want to say well the
[43:41] holy ghost isn't isn't manifested in
[43:43] this day and age but if god said it is
[43:46] it is
[43:47] you can argue with it you can say well
[43:49] it is only for the 12
[43:50] 12 disciples
[43:53] it's settled in heaven it's done deal we
[43:55] don't need to argue about it we don't
[43:57] need to get up say hey hey you can't
[43:58] teach that
[44:00] it's a done deal
[44:03] can't you just settle in your heart
[44:04] tonight lord jesus i believe you
[44:07] that settles it hallelujah i'm coming
[44:09] now i want you to give me the baptism of
[44:11] the spirit and you'll get it right there
[44:13] all right then forever god will seal you
[44:15] by the holy spirit until the day of your
[44:16] redemption all right
[44:19] the cogs of god's machine grind slow but
[44:22] if there's a promise in the bible
[44:23] healing holy ghost salvation
[44:27] salvation your family whatever it is
[44:28] that you're praying about you have need
[44:30] of
[44:31] it's already settled in heaven
[44:33] we don't need to be other people may
[44:35] argue about it but as believers we
[44:37] shouldn't be arguing about it down here
[44:38] if they're not arguing about it up here
[44:39] let's not argue about it down here i
[44:41] said lord i don't understand it somehow
[44:43] you said you'd forgive me for all my
[44:45] past
[44:47] i take you at your word you said you'd
[44:48] fill me with the holy ghost when i was
[44:50] baptized and repented i've done that
[44:52] lord
[44:53] now just let the cogs grind on slow
[44:57] it'll arrive in perfect time
[44:59] the wheels of god's time appeals
[45:01] timepiece real slow but sure
[45:03] this brought an example
[45:05] to mine and as you know done a little
[45:07] farming all my life kind of retired from
[45:09] that now but
[45:10] on this farm i've spent
[45:12] many an hour
[45:13] riding on the hay wagon behind the
[45:15] square baler
[45:16] so i want to just tell you a little
[45:18] story about that
[45:19] now the hay baler
[45:21] it puts out a square bale 18 inches wide
[45:24] 14 inches thick about three feet long
[45:28] and you stand on the wagon and as it
[45:29] comes out of the baler you take it by
[45:31] the two strings you walk with the back
[45:33] of the wagon you set it down you walk
[45:35] back to the front
[45:36] you get the next one it comes off and
[45:38] you walk back and you keep stacking it
[45:39] stacking it you get all the way to the
[45:40] front you get a full wagon you unhook it
[45:42] hook another empty and you keep on going
[45:44] i spent many an hour on that
[45:46] new holland haybaler
[45:48] stacking the hay to take to the barn
[45:51] these bales are about 60 pounds or so
[45:53] unless you get in some wet hay then it
[45:55] may be
[45:56] heavier than that but 60 pounds about
[45:58] right for a little skinny farm boy
[46:00] so i'd like to explain the mechanism i
[46:02] know all you sisters are getting ready
[46:04] to fall asleep we got a spiritual lesson
[46:06] to this
[46:07] so you just we're not just up here
[46:08] telling stories brother branham didn't
[46:09] just get up and tell stories i don't
[46:11] think the lord inspired this
[46:13] just for humor or
[46:15] entertainment or just to pass the time
[46:18] so let me explain
[46:19] now
[46:21] i'm from the 60s era myself and so these
[46:24] balers that we worked on
[46:26] were old at that time they were from
[46:28] from the 60s and 70s
[46:30] i don't know what the new ones they may
[46:31] be set up a little different but i'm
[46:33] talking about the old style now they
[46:35] don't even need a guy on the wagon
[46:36] they've
[46:37] got different setups back in the old
[46:39] days
[46:41] it was the little boys riding on the on
[46:42] the wagon
[46:44] so you hooked this baler square baler
[46:46] hook it up to the tractor put the hitch
[46:48] pin in it
[46:49] hook a pto shaft that's a power takeoff
[46:51] that clicks onto the back of the tractor
[46:54] and then you throw a lever or a clutch
[46:56] there to engage that and that pto shaft
[46:58] begins to spin
[47:00] that pto shaft drives a big flywheel big
[47:03] steel wheel and it begins to spin
[47:05] optimum speeds about 540 revolutions per
[47:08] minute as that's spinning that flywheel
[47:11] is connected to a gearbox that gearbox
[47:14] drives these gathering teeth
[47:17] gathering tines and they pick the hay up
[47:19] off the ground and they pull it into the
[47:20] baler
[47:22] then there's uh i would call them uh
[47:26] crossfeed times is what i'd call them
[47:28] there's these ties that take take that
[47:30] hay as it comes up and they slide it
[47:32] over into the bale chamber
[47:34] and they go over
[47:35] everything's keeping time with the
[47:37] flywheel
[47:38] well also on that gearbox there's a big
[47:40] plunger
[47:41] 14 inches
[47:42] tall 18 inches wide the same size as the
[47:45] bale that's the size of the of the bale
[47:48] chamber the hate comes in there
[47:50] and that plunger punches it
[47:53] and it's just a steady rhythm so i've
[47:55] spent many an hour standing on that
[47:57] wagon
[47:58] the wagon's rocking
[48:00] and the baler is rocking as that plunger
[48:01] big old heavy thing it's a plunging and
[48:04] it's making a it's going at 540 rpm that
[48:07] plunger is making oh
[48:09] 70 or 80
[48:11] strokes per minute
[48:14] one stroke in less than a second
[48:16] big whoop
[48:19] i can hear it now
[48:22] and the wagon is just kind of rocking
[48:24] back and forth because everything's
[48:26] everything's working there
[48:27] that flywheel's spinning the plunger is
[48:29] plunging it's got a big blade so as the
[48:31] hay goes in it got a big blade and it
[48:33] cuts it off plunges it compacts it those
[48:35] tines have got to get out of the way
[48:36] because if they don't
[48:38] that plunger will just snap them right
[48:40] off and then you're done bailing for the
[48:41] day so everything's in perfect time
[48:44] we're thinking of god's timing
[48:45] everything's in perfect time
[48:49] and as the tractor goes down through the
[48:51] through the uh
[48:54] through the hayfield there's big mounds
[48:56] of dried hay in big long rows sometimes
[48:59] those stacks of hay they may be this
[49:01] this big
[49:02] this wide and as that
[49:05] the gathering tines pull it up in there
[49:06] and the cross feed ties they throw it
[49:08] into the chamber and that plunger is
[49:10] just plunging away cutting it and
[49:11] plunging it and everything looks like
[49:13] making a lot of noise and
[49:15] a lot of dust and a lot of things going
[49:17] on but in the back
[49:19] there's
[49:20] a fascinating mechanism to me it's
[49:23] called the knotter
[49:24] it's a little unit there sets up there
[49:26] and it ties the knots in the haystream
[49:29] it's not doing anything
[49:30] it's just sitting there
[49:32] not doing a single
[49:34] thing
[49:35] all this work going on
[49:37] tines are working cross feed going
[49:39] flywheels are spinning the plungers are
[49:41] plunging
[49:42] tractors are grown in the grunting and
[49:43] the guy on the wagon he's a he's a
[49:45] working and the knotters just sit there
[49:48] not doing a single thing there's not
[49:50] much happening on the back of that baler
[49:52] except for one little wheel it's a
[49:54] little star-shaped wheel about that big
[49:56] and it as the hay comes into the chamber
[49:58] that little wheel
[50:00] touches it and it just turns ever so
[50:03] slowly
[50:04] and as that turns slowly it drives a
[50:07] shaft
[50:08] there's a lever on that shaft
[50:10] and as that shaft turns it slowly goes
[50:13] it'll only go up about two inches
[50:15] slowly raises
[50:17] very you can hardly watch it you mean if
[50:19] you're getting a lot of hay going in
[50:20] there you can see the you can see the
[50:22] metering wheel they call it you can see
[50:24] the metering wheel turning very slowly
[50:26] but you can hardly see that lever
[50:29] that lever slowly raises
[50:31] and when it gets to the top
[50:33] it releases snaps a clutch
[50:36] as the plunger comes back out of the
[50:37] chamber two two needles with strings
[50:40] attached to them come up through the
[50:41] bottom the plunger comes back and it's
[50:43] getting ready to come right back in
[50:44] there and snap those needles off that
[50:46] comes up there the knotters flip in a
[50:49] split second tie the knots cut the
[50:51] strings the needles come back out
[50:55] back going at it again
[50:56] and then nothing's happened in the back
[50:58] just that little wheel slowly turning
[51:01] nodders just sitting there
[51:03] needles just sitting there nothing's
[51:05] happening
[51:07] but that metering wheel
[51:09] is slowly turning marking out the time
[51:12] marking out the length of that bale
[51:14] it knows when to tie the bale
[51:16] the guy on the tractor he doesn't
[51:17] determine that the guy on the wagon he
[51:19] doesn't determine that they can adjust
[51:22] it and as they need to
[51:24] but when everything's set properly they
[51:26] just need to wait
[51:27] maybe that tractor not wagon go
[51:30] a quarter mile down the road because
[51:32] because maybe there's not much hay just
[51:33] a little bit and there's not enough to
[51:35] make a bale
[51:36] don't get up there and try to tie the
[51:38] bale
[51:39] the metering wheel knows when it's time
[51:40] to tie the tie the bale
[51:43] just rest
[51:50] so that that flywheel is just hitting
[51:54] and we think you know in our lives
[51:58] nothing's happening
[51:59] he said lord nothing's happening i pray
[52:01] for something nothing happens it's just
[52:04] that same old
[52:05] grind of everyday
[52:07] go to work clock in clock out
[52:11] go to church
[52:13] sunday wednesday nothing's happened
[52:16] lord what are you doing what's happening
[52:18] nothing's happening in my life but his
[52:20] wheel is turning
[52:22] measuring knowing
[52:24] the right time to trigger everything and
[52:27] then when it does everything's got to
[52:28] work instantly within less than a second
[52:31] because that plunger is coming right
[52:32] back in less than a second
[52:35] everything's got to get up there tie the
[52:37] knots get it out of the way and go right
[52:39] back to the same old mundane
[52:41] monday through friday
[52:43] wash the kids face feed them their
[52:45] breakfast clean up after them go to
[52:47] church come home clock in clock out
[52:53] nothing's happening
[52:56] god knows
[52:57] he's got a metering wheel on your life
[52:59] in my life
[53:01] lord what's happening i know i felt that
[53:03] way
[53:05] and this isn't in the notes so we're
[53:06] just going to go with it
[53:10] there was a time
[53:11] oh a long time ago
[53:15] that
[53:15] i was in that same condition
[53:17] go to church come home
[53:19] what's going on just doing the same
[53:21] thing go and run the sound at church and
[53:23] record the services and go home go to
[53:26] church and come home and go to school or
[53:27] go to work and
[53:29] just lord what have you got for my life
[53:31] and i remember i think i've told this
[53:33] here before
[53:34] setting at the family camp down in st
[53:36] mary's
[53:38] just sitting there on the tailgate of my
[53:39] truck playing the guitar somebody walked
[53:42] by me and i don't know who it was
[53:43] and uh because i didn't really know
[53:45] anybody at the camp somebody walked by
[53:48] turn around come back they said
[53:50] if you'll read the message the oddball
[53:51] you'll find the answer to your question
[53:54] and
[53:55] okay thank you brother
[53:57] did i have a question
[53:59] didn't know i had a question
[54:01] uh because i got caught up in that just
[54:04] just the same old mundane everything but
[54:07] in my heart
[54:08] there was a question
[54:10] and so i went home and read that message
[54:13] probably on the first page or two
[54:16] brother branham there's two sermons
[54:18] titled the oddball the one he was
[54:20] speaking to brother jean goad and leo
[54:21] mercer i believe it was
[54:23] he was saying i knew these boys had more
[54:25] that they could do than just make tapes
[54:27] that's what i was doing
[54:29] just
[54:30] tape the service run the sound
[54:32] mail out the tapes to those who couldn't
[54:34] get the service and just
[54:36] just the same old mundane
[54:40] and the question in my heart was lord
[54:42] what have you got for me
[54:44] what what is there
[54:46] and that was the answer to my question
[54:48] everything clicked
[54:49] then it went back to mundane again had
[54:52] they answered my question okay god
[54:53] there's more that i could do
[54:55] what is it
[54:57] it's not your time to get up there and
[54:58] try to tie the strings and force the
[55:00] needles up let's let's go do something
[55:03] just wait
[55:04] you got your answer okay let's wait
[55:07] let that little wheel keep right on turn
[55:08] them then the time come up
[55:11] invited to go to pakistan and uh
[55:14] and that's all history now
[55:16] and there was none of my doing it was
[55:17] just waiting upon the lord that that
[55:19] little wheel turning turning turning
[55:24] well let's let's let's look back
[55:26] remember those times and then don't
[55:28] forget them today
[55:30] because you and i are both going to be
[55:32] sitting here thinking
[55:33] lord what is there there's got to be
[55:35] something more what what can we do here
[55:36] we are sitting uh
[55:38] covered 19 we can't do anywhere we can't
[55:40] go traveling we can't go ministering
[55:42] what what can we do and it just becomes
[55:44] the same old mundane
[55:46] womp won't
[55:49] but everything's working just right
[55:51] that little meter wheel is turning
[55:54] when the time comes
[55:56] it'll click
[55:58] everything will work unless you go
[56:00] faking it till you make it
[56:02] now you're out now you're in trouble
[56:05] you go trying to fake it till you make
[56:06] it you don't mess with that baler
[56:09] there's everything's got to be in time
[56:11] you don't want anything out of time
[56:13] uh the old baylors that i had were not
[56:16] exactly in perfect time and
[56:17] all the time shearing
[56:19] little bolts that are safety bolts
[56:22] in case something got out of time
[56:24] i should have invested my in them as a
[56:26] stockholder in the company i was buying
[56:28] so many of those things because the old
[56:30] balers wore out
[56:31] and there was too much play and slop and
[56:34] and
[56:35] we would shear bolts left and right
[56:38] but when it's perfectly tuned don't mess
[56:40] with it don't mess with the tension you
[56:43] won't cut your strings your knots won't
[56:45] tie tight
[56:46] don't mess with the timing
[56:48] everything's got to work perfectly
[56:50] just sit back rest let it let it do its
[56:52] thing
[56:54] if you're riding on the wagon you just
[56:55] wait the bail will come to you
[56:59] praise the lord
[57:02] you know
[57:03] when that
[57:04] that plunger is going into that baler
[57:08] when the hay is real thick
[57:11] that plunger may
[57:12] it may only make five or ten strokes and
[57:14] you've got a bale
[57:16] and then
[57:17] five or ten more strokes and you've got
[57:18] another bale and it's just pumping them
[57:20] out
[57:21] and you have to run with that bale to
[57:22] the back of the wagon and put it in
[57:24] place run back and get the next one
[57:25] usually you try to have two guys on the
[57:28] on the wagon so that you don't just wear
[57:30] yourself out running back and forth back
[57:31] and forth
[57:32] but then when the hay gets short
[57:35] later in the season or you've got a
[57:37] field that maybe just doesn't have a lot
[57:39] of hay in it maybe you've had a dry year
[57:41] or a different type of hay just grassy
[57:43] hay or something
[57:45] the hay is not very thick but yet you
[57:47] need to gather it because you got to
[57:48] feed the animals
[57:50] and you may drive a long way and that's
[57:52] plunger may it may make 200 strokes i
[57:55] don't know it may make 400 strokes
[57:57] before it actually
[57:58] brings a bale out
[58:00] it doesn't matter we're not counting
[58:02] strokes we're counting the bale
[58:04] it's not how long you've been in the
[58:05] message or how long you've served the
[58:06] lord or or how much you've done for this
[58:09] or that or what you've given in the
[58:11] oftenness that's not it
[58:13] when you're full you're full
[58:15] when you're done you're done he's not
[58:17] going to pull you out of that baler
[58:18] until you're the proper size
[58:21] but
[58:22] we're in a gleaning time now you know
[58:24] back in the philadelphia and church age
[58:25] your back and brother when brother
[58:27] branham was
[58:28] having the healing ministries there's a
[58:29] lot happening
[58:31] there was
[58:32] you could go to the meetings and i
[58:34] didn't i was before my time but but
[58:36] people were coming to the altar filling
[58:38] the altars up
[58:40] and
[58:41] the word of god was spread around the
[58:42] world during
[58:44] the philadelphia and church age and a
[58:46] lot of things happening we're in a
[58:48] gleaning time
[58:50] and when when you get all the all the
[58:52] field bailed
[58:54] all the windrows have been picked up but
[58:56] there's just little bits and pieces
[58:58] around the edges that maybe got missed
[59:00] they fell outside the baler the tractor
[59:02] driver got off a little bit or
[59:04] the wind blew it and scattered it
[59:07] now
[59:08] i was always one that would kind of go
[59:09] around try to clean it up a little bit
[59:11] so you're just driving driving driving
[59:13] all over and that
[59:15] plunger is just plunging constantly
[59:18] that's when the wagon shakes because
[59:20] there's nothing in there to take the
[59:21] impact and just you're just waiting and
[59:24] you're just going
[59:25] and it's uh seems like nothing's
[59:27] happening but the meter wheel is still
[59:29] measuring
[59:30] each one out
[59:34] and we're in a we're in the gleaming
[59:35] time it may not seem like a lot's going
[59:37] on
[59:38] in your life or
[59:39] around the message or
[59:42] however god knows
[59:45] and his timing is perfect and if we'll
[59:47] just wait on him
[59:49] not faking it till we make it you can go
[59:51] grab that lever you know that lever that
[59:53] i said only goes up about two inches and
[59:55] when it gets up to two in gets up to the
[59:57] top
[59:58] it releases because it's under tension
[1:00:00] it's under pressure you've got to have
[1:00:02] test tension and pressure in your life
[1:00:04] it's under tension it's under pressure
[1:00:06] and it goes up and then it gets to the
[1:00:07] top releases that pressure it clutches
[1:00:09] thrown
[1:00:10] and everything works perfectly
[1:00:12] the needles the knotters everything
[1:00:16] you could go up there and you can grab
[1:00:18] that lever and you can jerk it up
[1:00:21] and you get a short bale
[1:00:22] because it's not time
[1:00:24] the metering wheel has not set its time
[1:00:27] but you can jerk it up and sometimes you
[1:00:29] do that at the end of the season and you
[1:00:31] need to get all the hay out of there but
[1:00:32] the last bale is not quite complete it's
[1:00:35] uh it's a short bale it's it's not tied
[1:00:37] it's just waiting for more material
[1:00:39] there's no more material
[1:00:41] all the material's been picked up
[1:00:43] it's late in the season it's time to put
[1:00:44] the baler away you get it running you go
[1:00:47] out there you pull that thing up
[1:00:49] everything ties off and then you pull
[1:00:51] that last bale out of there and it may
[1:00:53] be just a short one
[1:00:54] maybe we're just waiting on that last
[1:00:56] short christian to come in the last
[1:00:58] last seat of god well he'll know when
[1:01:01] it's ready and he'll he can pull the
[1:01:02] lever but but you don't need to be doing
[1:01:04] that the guy on the wagon he can he can
[1:01:06] get all the impatience i i i want to
[1:01:08] stack some hey i'll go down there and
[1:01:09] pull that up he's gonna have a short
[1:01:10] bale now what's he gonna do with that
[1:01:12] it's not gonna fit everything's gonna be
[1:01:13] out in the in the farmer
[1:01:16] one in charge is not gonna be happy to
[1:01:18] have this little short bale
[1:01:24] we don't want to fake
[1:01:26] fake it till we make it
[1:01:28] we don't want to
[1:01:30] try to manufacture
[1:01:32] our own
[1:01:34] experience or however you want to say
[1:01:36] that when god knows
[1:01:38] that you've got everything in you that
[1:01:40] you need
[1:01:41] that metering wheel
[1:01:43] will tell it's time and god can seal you
[1:01:47] and you won't feel fool god's god's
[1:01:49] metering wheel we can't go jerk that
[1:01:51] wheel up and get tied and come out a
[1:01:53] short bale uh no that's faking it it's
[1:01:56] not gonna work
[1:01:58] so we may seem it may seem like it's
[1:02:00] just the same old humdrum
[1:02:02] every day that plunger just working
[1:02:05] working working uh
[1:02:08] and you can look up there and you can
[1:02:09] see the flywheel going you can see the
[1:02:10] tines gathering it up and you can see
[1:02:12] the cross feed tines and the plunger and
[1:02:14] the knife and everything is working
[1:02:16] but you you know if you was the knotter
[1:02:18] you'd say
[1:02:19] i'm not doing anything lord what can i
[1:02:21] do i i've got nothing to do you can't do
[1:02:24] anything you can't do you just wait
[1:02:26] he said well this brother's doing this
[1:02:27] and this church is doing that and
[1:02:29] they've got this ministry over here and
[1:02:30] i've got
[1:02:31] this over here
[1:02:33] lord what's for me
[1:02:35] wait upon the lord
[1:02:44] we don't want to
[1:02:46] impersonate a revelation
[1:02:49] like well everybody else is shouting and
[1:02:51] jumping and when when the pastor says
[1:02:53] this or the visiting minister says that
[1:02:55] and and i don't get it but i'm gonna
[1:02:58] jump up and shout too you're faking it
[1:03:00] forget it
[1:03:02] let's be honest let's be genuine
[1:03:05] we
[1:03:06] god doesn't need fake he doesn't want
[1:03:08] fake he won't have fake
[1:03:10] be honest be genuine
[1:03:12] let god meter out your progress
[1:03:15] not it's not up to you to determine your
[1:03:16] progress it's up to him
[1:03:20] don't try to get ahold of god get ahead
[1:03:22] of god's program he's got everything
[1:03:24] time just right
[1:03:26] just be honest brother bran was
[1:03:28] honest you know we don't need to perform
[1:03:31] let's say as ministers brother branham
[1:03:33] in his early ministry uh
[1:03:36] he he felt that pressure to perform
[1:03:38] and i didn't look it up but if i unders
[1:03:41] i remember right from reading the
[1:03:43] life story books and hearing his
[1:03:44] testimony there was a time when he
[1:03:47] thought he had to get all the worst case
[1:03:49] scenario
[1:03:51] healing
[1:03:52] you know get bring your worst bring your
[1:03:54] wounded bring your lame bring your halt
[1:03:56] your blind bring him up here
[1:03:59] he was under that pressure to perform
[1:04:00] and he got in trouble for it as the lord
[1:04:02] said don't do that
[1:04:04] and he had to mature
[1:04:06] but after he matured there's no need for
[1:04:08] that let's just be honest i can't do
[1:04:10] anything unless the lord shows me
[1:04:14] jesus said the same thing in john 5 19
[1:04:16] the son can do nothing of himself what
[1:04:18] he seeth the father do
[1:04:19] john 5 30 i can of mine in myself do
[1:04:21] nothing i seek not my own will but the
[1:04:24] will of the father and if that's good
[1:04:26] enough for jesus that ought to be good
[1:04:28] enough for us i can do nothing but what
[1:04:30] the lord shows me and if he hasn't shown
[1:04:31] you then you can do nothing
[1:04:33] amen
[1:04:36] so let's not try to manufacture some
[1:04:37] kind of a bible study if god hadn't
[1:04:39] shown anything to to present to the
[1:04:41] you're wasting their time
[1:04:43] and
[1:04:44] and you're being a detriment
[1:04:46] uh you know it's not just that well it
[1:04:49] it'll give them something to think about
[1:04:50] it'll
[1:04:51] no you're
[1:04:52] you're being a detriment
[1:04:54] because you're faking it you're fooling
[1:04:56] you're duping your uh
[1:04:58] you're fooling somebody you're fooling a
[1:05:00] brother and a sister you're fooling a
[1:05:01] child of god a son or daughter of god
[1:05:06] does do any of the parents here want to
[1:05:08] see their children fooled or you wives
[1:05:11] are you husbands who want to see your
[1:05:12] wives fooled by the salesman that comes
[1:05:14] around and i've got the best little
[1:05:15] product here this you just got to have
[1:05:17] this and your husband will love you for
[1:05:18] it
[1:05:19] and then he comes home you paid watford
[1:05:21] what
[1:05:23] well he said it was good
[1:05:25] no honey
[1:05:26] let me take that back
[1:05:28] we don't want to see uh
[1:05:31] psalm 69 5
[1:05:33] that should have been my text i guess i
[1:05:36] it just was on my heart so that's why we
[1:05:37] read it
[1:05:38] don't let me be
[1:05:40] don't let my foolishness
[1:05:42] cause a stumbling block
[1:05:45] you know imitate a message imitate a
[1:05:47] sermon imitate an anointing or a gift
[1:05:51] pretend like you're something that
[1:05:52] you're not
[1:05:54] you're causing a problem there you're
[1:05:56] going to cause somebody to stumble
[1:06:00] and you'll be answering to somebody
[1:06:02] uh that you don't want to be answered to
[1:06:05] in that manner
[1:06:07] we don't need fake
[1:06:10] uh
[1:06:11] i pray that we each take this to heart
[1:06:14] tonight
[1:06:16] god doesn't appreciate it uh
[1:06:18] there'll be no rewards for fake
[1:06:20] christians
[1:06:22] only condemnation judgment
[1:06:24] because you're a hypocrite
[1:06:26] uh you're dead you're worthless
[1:06:28] that's not really politically correct
[1:06:30] well that's we're not here to be
[1:06:31] politically correct we're here
[1:06:32] this is the house of god
[1:06:34] and house of correction and if you're
[1:06:35] being fake uh this is his little
[1:06:38] uh
[1:06:39] wake-up call let's let's get it straight
[1:06:42] let's get it right
[1:06:44] why go on
[1:06:45] with forged
[1:06:47] uh documents when you can have the real
[1:06:48] thing
[1:06:53] there's a power in being genuine brother
[1:06:55] chad read a quote and so this will be a
[1:06:57] repeat if nothing else has but i know uh
[1:07:00] these things that the lord laid on my
[1:07:02] heart was things that brother chad has
[1:07:04] been covering the past few services
[1:07:06] before he went on vacation um
[1:07:10] revelations chapter four verse uh third
[1:07:13] part three
[1:07:15] brother chad read this quote
[1:07:17] brother graham says oh how we need in
[1:07:18] jeffersonville thousands of lived voices
[1:07:21] the thunder of god thundering out in
[1:07:22] sweetness and holiness purity undefiled
[1:07:24] lies walking around in the earth today
[1:07:26] without a blemish yes sir real
[1:07:28] christians that's thunder against the
[1:07:29] enemy the devil don't care how loud you
[1:07:31] can holler the devil don't the devil
[1:07:33] don't care how much you can jump or how
[1:07:35] much you can do this or shout but what
[1:07:37] hurts the devil is to see that
[1:07:39] sanctified holy life consecrated to god
[1:07:42] say anything to him call him anything
[1:07:43] just as sweet as it can be and move
[1:07:45] right on oh my that throws him away
[1:07:47] that's the thunder that shakes the devil
[1:07:51] i wonder if we uh misread that sometimes
[1:07:53] oh how we need in jeffersonville
[1:07:55] thousands of voices that's not what bill
[1:07:57] graham said
[1:07:58] that's the problem too many voices
[1:08:00] thundering out
[1:08:02] he didn't say we need thousands of
[1:08:04] voices
[1:08:05] that's the problem too many people out
[1:08:07] there thundering out their voices trying
[1:08:09] to make something of themselves and
[1:08:10] trying to fake an experience committing
[1:08:12] fraud
[1:08:14] it's just thundering just thundering
[1:08:16] voices that's not going to shake the
[1:08:18] devil
[1:08:19] brother iran said lived
[1:08:21] voices we need thousands of lived voices
[1:08:26] the lived voices that's the thunder
[1:08:28] against the enemy
[1:08:29] lived voices the thunder of god
[1:08:31] thundering out
[1:08:33] your life
[1:08:34] your lived voice your genuine christian
[1:08:38] life
[1:08:39] is the thunder of god
[1:08:41] it's not your own thunder it's the
[1:08:42] thunder of god thundering out your
[1:08:44] manifested life
[1:08:46] manifested word in you is thundering out
[1:08:49] that's the thunder against the enemy the
[1:08:51] best part
[1:08:52] what was this and this is what i always
[1:08:54] liked about this quote how did this
[1:08:56] thunder sound out we'd think of thunder
[1:08:58] we think of a big old booming
[1:09:02] noise that scares little children does
[1:09:03] it thunder out in power and might
[1:09:06] arrogance and pride
[1:09:08] no he says thundering out in sweetness
[1:09:12] and holiness that'll be the quietest
[1:09:13] thunder but that's what will move the
[1:09:15] enemy
[1:09:16] sweetness thundering out and sweetness
[1:09:18] and holiness purity
[1:09:21] purity
[1:09:22] genuine
[1:09:24] not making it to you faking it till you
[1:09:26] make it
[1:09:27] purity undefiled lies walking around in
[1:09:30] the earth today without a blemish
[1:09:33] not faking it till they make it
[1:09:35] let me read that full quote again oh how
[1:09:36] we need in jeffersonville thousands of
[1:09:38] lived voices
[1:09:40] the thunder of god and thundering out in
[1:09:42] sweetness and holiness purity undefiled
[1:09:44] lies walking around in in the earth
[1:09:47] excuse me in the earth today without a
[1:09:49] blemish yes sir real christians that's
[1:09:52] thunder against the enemy the devil
[1:09:53] don't care how loud you can holler the
[1:09:55] devil don't care how much you can jump
[1:09:56] or how much you can do this or shout
[1:09:58] what hurts the devil is to see that
[1:10:00] sanctified
[1:10:01] holy life consecrated to god
[1:10:04] say anything to him call him anything
[1:10:06] just as sweet as it can be and move
[1:10:08] right on oh my that throws him away you
[1:10:10] want to move the devil you want to move
[1:10:12] the devil in your life you will move the
[1:10:13] devil out of your brother's life
[1:10:16] a need in the body
[1:10:18] this body the body of christ
[1:10:21] you need to move a devil
[1:10:23] that's how you do it
[1:10:25] not by faking it till you make it
[1:10:28] that's the thunder that shakes the devil
[1:10:29] that throws him away that genuine
[1:10:33] consecrated lived life
[1:10:36] 1956 why are people so tossed about
[1:10:38] brother braham said i stood a few weeks
[1:10:39] ago where there was a big tent erected
[1:10:42] not slamming god forgive where a man
[1:10:44] said he could cast out evil spirits
[1:10:45] which i have no doubt of that but evil
[1:10:47] spirits are not cast out by cruel
[1:10:50] indifferent living
[1:10:51] the most powerful weapon there is in the
[1:10:53] world is love
[1:10:58] a cruel
[1:10:59] indifferent living i don't know what the
[1:11:01] definition of that would be
[1:11:03] but it's not genuine
[1:11:04] it's not the real deal it's not what
[1:11:06] brother branham just described that
[1:11:07] would thunder out and shake the devil
[1:11:10] move the devil
[1:11:11] a cruel and indifferent life
[1:11:14] faking it till they make it living one
[1:11:16] life
[1:11:17] and then coming
[1:11:18] uh pretending to be something that
[1:11:20] they're not
[1:11:23] evil spirits are not cast out by cruel
[1:11:26] indifferent living
[1:11:28] think about your life
[1:11:32] i hope it doesn't
[1:11:33] fall into the category of cruel
[1:11:35] indifferent
[1:11:36] you can't move a devil that way
[1:11:39] you know
[1:11:40] you're not gonna be able to pray for a
[1:11:41] toothache get it healed
[1:11:43] uh
[1:11:45] you're not gonna move anything
[1:11:46] you can't even move that cruel and then
[1:11:48] different spirit out of your own self
[1:11:50] you need to become genuine and say lord
[1:11:52] i i need the real thing
[1:11:54] so to put it in my words evil spirits
[1:11:56] are not cast out by fake lines
[1:12:00] a christian that lives a cruel and a
[1:12:02] different life is a counterfeit
[1:12:03] christian a fake hypocrite pharisee dead
[1:12:07] worthless
[1:12:09] that kind of life will not move a devil
[1:12:11] i'd like to be able to move a devil
[1:12:13] when when i see a devil on myself
[1:12:17] or brother or sister they have a need in
[1:12:19] their body or in their life
[1:12:21] or in a congregation or in a church or
[1:12:24] for overseas for pakistan
[1:12:27] i want to be able to move a devil but
[1:12:29] i'm not going to be able to do it with a
[1:12:30] cruel
[1:12:31] and different life anything less than
[1:12:34] genuine sanctified holy life consecrated
[1:12:37] to god
[1:12:39] faking it until you make it it's not
[1:12:40] going to make it
[1:12:46] in faith cometh by hearing 1954
[1:12:49] brother man says now faith is burly
[1:12:51] my how i like to think of faith hope
[1:12:54] faith and charity those three things and
[1:12:55] hope what a beautiful thing hope is
[1:12:58] little timid hope lovely and sweet as
[1:13:00] she is yet she's the greatest enemy
[1:13:02] faith has that's right the greatest
[1:13:05] enemy faith faith's got
[1:13:07] is hope
[1:13:08] i don't know that i'm real familiar with
[1:13:10] this
[1:13:11] quote
[1:13:13] because a person becomes so hopeful
[1:13:15] till they leave away from faith well
[1:13:18] hope's a good good thing right
[1:13:20] we need to we need hope we do god gave
[1:13:22] us hope
[1:13:24] but it can become
[1:13:25] where a person becomes so hopeful
[1:13:28] till they leave away from faith
[1:13:30] it says now hope will agree with the
[1:13:32] bible hope will say it's true hope will
[1:13:34] say i believe every bit of it i believe
[1:13:35] that that's the word of god and i
[1:13:37] believe that god will keep his promise
[1:13:38] hope believes all of that but hope then
[1:13:40] says now i believe that god will heal
[1:13:42] but look at my condition
[1:13:44] now faith don't look at that faith comes
[1:13:46] around i don't care nothing about
[1:13:47] conditions god god says so and it's mine
[1:13:51] that's the way faith acts
[1:13:52] you see faith's burly as i once said
[1:13:55] faith's got hair on the chest when it
[1:13:57] stands up and pulls its big muscles out
[1:13:59] everything else vanishes away just takes
[1:14:01] flies away when faith really takes a
[1:14:02] hold nothing else stands i'm telling you
[1:14:05] faith when you've got you've got to have
[1:14:07] hope and charity if you've got real
[1:14:09] burly faith and no love with it you ruin
[1:14:11] your influence before the people if you
[1:14:13] haven't got love mixed with it see
[1:14:15] you've seen people real early what we
[1:14:16] would say excuse the excuse expression
[1:14:18] that bulldog faith to grab a hold but
[1:14:21] it's so rough with it then you see what
[1:14:23] when you do that it does it hasn't got
[1:14:25] the kindness there to move with it so
[1:14:28] what we need is hope faith and charity
[1:14:30] isn't that right hope faith and charity
[1:14:31] together god help our church to have it
[1:14:33] like that the people to have that
[1:14:35] combination but if you just rely on hope
[1:14:37] you hinder faith
[1:14:39] hope looks for something way off but
[1:14:41] faith claims it right now
[1:14:43] see faith says god said so and it's mine
[1:14:45] that settles it see i don't care if i'm
[1:14:47] crippled if i'm still crippled i'm still
[1:14:49] blind if i'm still sick that don't have
[1:14:51] nothing to do with it i believe it
[1:14:52] anyhow it's mine right now god says so
[1:14:55] and that settles it that's faith but
[1:14:57] hope says god says so and i'm expecting
[1:14:59] to get it someday
[1:15:00] you see i'm expecting some day and as
[1:15:02] long as satan can put you off to another
[1:15:04] day that's as good as he wants that's
[1:15:06] right you'll never get it just believe
[1:15:08] that you got it right now it's your
[1:15:10] personal property faith is the substance
[1:15:12] of things hoped for the evidence of
[1:15:14] things not seen is that right
[1:15:15] faith acts now it's positive
[1:15:18] there's no oh my i tell you sickness and
[1:15:20] everything else when faith steps in it's
[1:15:21] just like a snowball on a hot stove it
[1:15:23] just melts away everything goes away
[1:15:25] from faith because faith stands up takes
[1:15:27] over rule when faith speaks everybody
[1:15:29] else keeps still that's right
[1:15:32] and let me
[1:15:35] read another quote here the anointed
[1:15:36] ones at the end time what is faith
[1:15:39] faith is something that's revealed to
[1:15:40] you
[1:15:41] that is not yet but yet but you believe
[1:15:44] it will be faith
[1:15:46] is a revelation of the will of god
[1:15:50] you know it's uh sometimes it's
[1:15:52] uh we we get that confused in our mind
[1:15:55] hope and faith and i'm hoping for this
[1:15:58] but that's the enemy of faith
[1:16:00] but when you can catch a revelation that
[1:16:02] god said so it's settled in heaven he's
[1:16:05] not arguing about it why am i arguing
[1:16:07] about it i'm not hoping for this it's
[1:16:09] mine
[1:16:10] it's my possession now i don't have my
[1:16:12] healing right now
[1:16:14] other than i have a promise and that's
[1:16:15] good enough god's cogs will move around
[1:16:19] and it'll come to pass because god said
[1:16:21] so and he's big enough to keep his word
[1:16:22] and he does keep his word he will move
[1:16:24] it around
[1:16:27] but if you're just hoping i'm hoping
[1:16:29] someday that this will this situation
[1:16:31] will mend itself and you've got a
[1:16:34] promise
[1:16:36] stand on it
[1:16:38] wait on it
[1:16:40] believe in it not hope for it not faking
[1:16:43] it
[1:16:49] you know faith has substance fake
[1:16:51] pretend imitations it has no substance
[1:16:54] when we see a promise of the word of god
[1:16:55] we can claim it by faith
[1:16:57] knowing that god keeps his word
[1:16:59] not hoping he'll keep his word knowing
[1:17:00] he'll keep his word we've got to have a
[1:17:02] revelation of that uh that our heavenly
[1:17:04] father he his promises are true they're
[1:17:06] good his cogs turn slow but they turn
[1:17:09] sure
[1:17:11] don't fake it till you make it you rest
[1:17:13] on him you wait on him
[1:17:15] he promised it
[1:17:16] uh just just get rafe get away from that
[1:17:18] faking
[1:17:20] with the musicians come please brother
[1:17:22] uh blake
[1:17:26] brother branham didn't have a fake
[1:17:28] trust in god
[1:17:32] a fake trust a fake belief would not
[1:17:35] have held him in his time and trouble
[1:17:37] you know i was talking about those other
[1:17:38] ministries back in his day there was a
[1:17:40] lot of healing ministries
[1:17:41] and they were some tremendous uh
[1:17:45] i've i've seen some of the healing
[1:17:47] meetings online i've
[1:17:49] they have those recorded and you can you
[1:17:52] can pull them up some of those other uh
[1:17:55] ministries back in brother branham's day
[1:17:57] uh phenomenal
[1:17:59] uh dynamic
[1:18:00] uh
[1:18:02] i mean you could you could pull it up
[1:18:04] today benny hinn uh
[1:18:06] doing things bigger and better than
[1:18:08] brother branham did
[1:18:09] according to their but he wasn't not
[1:18:10] bringing the word you know that's the
[1:18:12] most important thing to us
[1:18:14] but things happening
[1:18:17] faking it
[1:18:19] but then you see those ministries where
[1:18:21] they get in the tight spot and it
[1:18:22] doesn't hold
[1:18:25] and that's just evidence that
[1:18:26] something's been faked
[1:18:29] brother branham says in 1965 he said he
[1:18:32] let my wife die and me holding her by
[1:18:33] the hands crying for her my daddy in his
[1:18:35] arm in his arms died on on this arm
[1:18:38] right here looking up at me trying to
[1:18:39] get his breath and i prayed as hard as i
[1:18:41] could how could i face the public again
[1:18:43] to preach divine healing how could i
[1:18:44] preach he was a good god and let my own
[1:18:46] daddy die a sinner how could i preach
[1:18:48] that i don't know how but i know he's
[1:18:50] right the word of god shall never fail
[1:18:52] it'll triumph no matter what that is
[1:18:55] then i know there was something inside
[1:18:57] of all the reasons of all reasonings
[1:18:59] something inside of all emotions
[1:19:01] everything else like that there was an
[1:19:02] inside man that held in that hour
[1:19:04] nothing else could have done
[1:19:06] it every reason
[1:19:09] everything
[1:19:10] could be showed everything could prove
[1:19:11] that it was wrong and i was in the wrong
[1:19:13] but the word of god that was
[1:19:15] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:19:16] the world held on the inside
[1:19:18] he had the real deal
[1:19:20] he wasn't faking it he had the real deal
[1:19:23] i felt a little wind come through the
[1:19:24] building her spirit went to meet god
[1:19:26] brother sister let me tell you that's
[1:19:28] the only thing don't try to reason it
[1:19:30] out don't try to have long hair because
[1:19:32] i said so
[1:19:34] i don't know that i've ever heard
[1:19:34] brother bram say that don't try to have
[1:19:36] long hair well let's read the full thing
[1:19:38] don't try to have long hair because
[1:19:40] let's not
[1:19:42] let's not serve god and walk in this
[1:19:44] message of the hour and and believe
[1:19:47] because there was a man named william
[1:19:48] branham and said it was right
[1:19:51] let's let you better get something down
[1:19:52] inside of your heart so it's a real deal
[1:19:54] otherwise you're just faking it well i'm
[1:19:56] trusting that brother brandon was right
[1:19:57] he sounded like and all my friends they
[1:19:59] said right and this church says it's
[1:20:01] right and
[1:20:02] you're on the wrong track you're faking
[1:20:04] it
[1:20:04] and that won't hold in the hour of your
[1:20:06] need don't try to reason it out don't
[1:20:08] try to have long hair because i said so
[1:20:10] don't try to do these things just
[1:20:12] because in your flesh don't try to do it
[1:20:14] just kind of cope up but just wait
[1:20:16] before the lord to something way down on
[1:20:18] the inside
[1:20:19] many of you think because you've got
[1:20:21] long hair that means you're going to go
[1:20:22] to heaven that doesn't mean that
[1:20:24] many of them think because you're a good
[1:20:26] moral woman you're going it don't mean
[1:20:28] that many of them think because of their
[1:20:30] churches and belong to this and this
[1:20:31] great group and great doctors of
[1:20:33] divinity i don't mean that
[1:20:35] many think because they speak in tongues
[1:20:37] they've got the holy ghost that don't
[1:20:38] mean that though the holy ghost does
[1:20:40] speak with tongues but until that real
[1:20:42] genuine holy spirit in there will cope
[1:20:44] with every word if that holy spirit in
[1:20:46] you that makes you speak with tongues
[1:20:48] looks back there and doesn't agree with
[1:20:50] the rest of the word
[1:20:51] then it's the wrong spirit
[1:20:53] it's got to come from the inside which
[1:20:55] is the word from the beginning in the
[1:20:57] beginning of the creation of god when
[1:20:58] god began to create
[1:21:00] bring you into existence you see you
[1:21:03] started back there as a seed and worked
[1:21:05] down to where you are now and then you
[1:21:07] were all in christ and then when christ
[1:21:08] died he died to redeem all of you and
[1:21:11] you're a part of this word and how can
[1:21:12] the bible all of it precept upon precept
[1:21:15] line up online hear little there little
[1:21:17] not one jot or little or tittle shall
[1:21:19] fail how in the world can you
[1:21:21] being part of that word disagree with
[1:21:23] the rest of it or any part of it
[1:21:26] if you're faking it
[1:21:28] and just relying upon your church
[1:21:30] association
[1:21:31] or
[1:21:32] or some favorite minister
[1:21:35] with a good ministry and
[1:21:37] a real genuine gift of god
[1:21:40] uh to teach or whatever he he if that's
[1:21:43] all you're relying on you're just faking
[1:21:45] it
[1:21:45] you need the reality
[1:21:47] because nothing else is gonna hold
[1:21:50] amen
[1:21:52] let's all stand
[1:22:05] if you see a promise in the word of god
[1:22:08] claim it
[1:22:09] claim it don't fake it claim it
[1:22:13] make sure all the documents are right
[1:22:17] send it in and wait on the lord
[1:22:20] there's nothing you need to do
[1:22:23] other than believe
[1:22:25] you don't need to manufacture the
[1:22:27] promise to you
[1:22:29] you don't need to manufacture your
[1:22:30] healing
[1:22:31] you don't need to manufacture the
[1:22:32] baptism the holy ghost
[1:22:36] that's just faking it
[1:22:39] let's buy our heads
[1:22:41] heavenly father
[1:22:44] i just so appreciate lord
[1:22:46] the thought that you gave me and i pray
[1:22:48] that it's been delivered in a way that
[1:22:50] your people will be able to receive it
[1:22:52] father
[1:22:53] and it's not uh up to me it's not my
[1:22:56] responsibility to uh

[1:23:03] would see fit
[1:23:04] father i pray that there's something
[1:23:06] touch the heart of the people lord

[1:23:16] and that it's on the way
[1:23:19] because your word stands true you don't
[1:23:21] argue about it in heaven
