TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if you look at the way jesus handled the word in his day he did not speak the word when he was speaking of what moses taught and all of this and even jonas he was taking scriptures from david and from jonas and from joel and from zechariah and all these things and he was preaching in a way they had never heard it preached like that before they couldn't even understand it applied that way it didn't even make any sense to them the way that jesus was presenting the word because he was presenting it so differently than their intellectual understanding and then the apostle paul comes and does the same thing with the scriptures we read i'm telling you it's hard to go back and think like a jew we've never thought like a jew but if you could go back and think like a jew and then paul would be absolutely tearing the height off of your your understanding flipping your understanding on its heel and messing up everything that you had learned all of your life but i tell you the prophet of god in our day did the exact same thing to the denominational understanding of the word and when the word comes to fulfillment and the interpretation of the word is always different than the humanistic understanding of being able to read words being able to read words and comprehend language amen when when jesus came he tore that to shreds when paul came he tore that to shreds and when brother branham came he tore that to shreds that's why people say i don't need anything else i just want my bible that's wonderful if you've got eyes to see and ears they're here you'll be good but if you're reading it the way the jews read their bible when jesus was here you'll be as lost as the jews who were rejecting jesus because they they didn't want this they just wanted their bible but this was their bible amen and we've come to the end of time where god in his mercy and grace has sent a prophet in this age and that prophet was here to bring the correct interpretation of the word to illuminate the word so that we could see the scriptures the way god wanted the scripture seen and you have people with the audacity to say i don't want that i just want my bible you put yourself right back where the jews were in the day jesus was here because this message is christ
