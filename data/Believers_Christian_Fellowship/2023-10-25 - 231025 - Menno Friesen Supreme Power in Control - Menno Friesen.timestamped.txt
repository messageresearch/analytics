[13:25] you all tonight this uh Tabernacle
[13:29] I feel I need some binoculars to get to
[13:31] see you all I said it last time too I
[13:33] said brother Chad must be all used to
[13:36] that and and um but uh I'm used to
[13:39] seeing the faces of the people we got
[13:41] our people way up closer I just this is
[13:45] far enough so they don't spit into their
[13:46] face but I
[13:48] mean but it is good to be here find good
[13:51] people and I'm sure you're all nice
[13:53] people I can't see you too well but I'm
[13:54] you're you're wonderful people I'm
[13:56] thankful that you're part what I believe
[13:58] is the most glorious part of God's
[14:01] choosing uh if he'd had done any better
[14:03] if he could do any better he would have
[14:04] done better because he's God he wouldn't
[14:07] choose just anybody he knows them that
[14:09] are his and uh he's not ringing his
[14:12] hands trying to figure out who they are
[14:13] he knows them before the foundation of
[14:15] the world and U I got to make a little
[14:18] confession I'm actually here on on a on
[14:20] a uh trip brother Wayne where you at oh
[14:24] yeah way there and um he said come come
[14:28] for a while and and just stay a while
[14:30] and I said all right so we kind of
[14:31] planned October and said let's uh let's
[14:33] put October aside and and so then it
[14:36] went on for a while didn't come to the
[14:38] middle of October and I said well all
[14:39] right then we'll be the two weeks and
[14:41] I'll uh I'll preach once for you on the
[14:43] 15th and then I'll then we'll just uh
[14:46] meet in the restaurant We'll pour from
[14:48] vessel to vessel uh you know what is
[14:51] when preachers get together it's a good
[14:53] time when you can sit down over coffee
[14:55] and just pour from what vessel you learn
[14:57] a lot of things along the way and uh
[14:59] it's good sometimes and then sometimes
[15:01] when I get a little bit out of hand he
[15:03] straightens me out so that's he's a
[15:05] young fell he can do that and U but I
[15:08] let him do that too cuz I kind of I'm
[15:11] I'm very happy for the young ministers
[15:13] that's that I look behind I think my
[15:15] they they just picked up the message and
[15:18] just running with it with all the grace
[15:20] and reality and uh there's so much
[15:23] reality in this
[15:24] message that I I don't think we'll ever
[15:27] be able to digest at all
[15:29] it just just the time you get a good
[15:31] drink and just think oh now that's it
[15:33] from now on that is so then comes
[15:35] another wave and and it just swallows
[15:37] you up to the place to where you finally
[15:40] say Lord there's just nothing left just
[15:42] keep pouring it in pouring it in and
[15:45] giving it out we want to pour in we want
[15:47] to give out what what what's in in us
[15:50] well whether we like to do that or not
[15:52] that's what happens whatever is in you
[15:55] it comes out and I'm glad to say say
[15:58] this I believe it's the grace of Jesus
[16:00] Christ in our heart in my heart here
[16:02] today and I stand before you I'd like to
[16:04] say things that would help you along the
[16:06] way make it easier and I've always
[16:08] believed that uh a real Christian one
[16:10] that's filled with the Holy Ghost has a
[16:13] desire to make life a little easier for
[16:15] somebody and uh though we're not always
[16:17] there like we'd like to be and uh but I
[16:20] do believe it makes a difference if your
[16:22] heart's in the right place he gives
[16:24] opportunity to serve him to serve his
[16:27] people and uh I I believe that the uh
[16:31] the uh the little bride that's on this
[16:33] Earth is the cream of his crop she's
[16:36] he's she's the wonderful people I I
[16:38] don't mean it because that she had
[16:40] anything to offer that's right that's
[16:42] right he offered it
[16:45] all and something inside of your heart
[16:47] said
[16:48] amen and so I'm I'm kind of that kind of
[16:51] person I believe in the god of the
[16:53] amen some people believe in shouting a
[16:56] lot and clapping a lot that's good
[16:57] running around that's that's good that's
[16:59] all has its
[17:00] place uh we don't all always act the
[17:03] same when we're alone or when we're
[17:05] nobody's looking why we might get a
[17:06] little excited but uh but there's one
[17:10] thing you can always do say Amen to the
[17:13] word of God just make sure it's the it
[17:16] is the word of God not the word of the
[17:18] pastor and the minister alone that it's
[17:20] the word of God in season in the time
[17:24] that we're now living and the message of
[17:26] God's word is in season all always in
[17:28] season now God's word is never out of
[17:31] season it's recognizing the day and the
[17:34] hour that we're in and I'm want to just
[17:36] bring greetings brother Dwayne Fair who
[17:38] is the pastor there now in our assembly
[17:41] he said make sure wherever you go greet
[17:43] the Saints and I do that in the LI area
[17:46] and I believe uh you know running down
[17:48] through the road number 75 I was
[17:52] thinking the other day Irene and I were
[17:53] driving and going on to the church there
[17:55] in bluon I said you know there's one
[17:58] thing about this this area they're going
[18:01] to have to quite an account for their
[18:04] lives they drive by they' got the
[18:07] opportunity not for what they've heard
[18:08] but what they could have
[18:10] heard there's a church three major
[18:13] churches here and maybe all different
[18:15] ones that's ones I know and I remember
[18:17] when there was wasn't even one when I
[18:19] first came here in 77 and we laid the we
[18:22] we dug over the uh the the ground where
[18:26] we're laying the foundation for the
[18:29] Tabernacle there and there was they were
[18:32] just coming in from everywhere there was
[18:33] a few Believers here of course you know
[18:35] the Browns and so with the major ones at
[18:37] the time and different ones they I say
[18:39] the major ones the ones that I was
[18:41] associating with the closest and but
[18:43] there I found out later on there were
[18:44] just everywhere laced around the area
[18:46] and now you think of all the saints the
[18:49] lights are shining everywhere but it is
[18:51] of course a lot darker too than it was
[18:53] then we're we're much further down the
[18:55] road now and uh we're we're we're we're
[18:58] beginning to see a lot of the greenness
[19:00] B out of the the uh the church you know
[19:03] that that adoption of the spirit of the
[19:06] Lord where it's moving and getting all
[19:08] the greenness out for the combine to
[19:10] come and take it out and we know that's
[19:13] we are dealing with immortality there
[19:16] and uh but remember before immortality
[19:18] comes upon this elect lady she'll be
[19:21] fully
[19:22] rip there won't be any greenness is my I
[19:25] believe it this way I believe it that
[19:26] way no I we believe it the way God said
[19:29] it that's good enough with me and I
[19:31] appreciate some of the things and
[19:32] brother CH brother Chad said just preach
[19:34] uh he didn't tell me what to preach so I
[19:37] just I want to just take my time I not
[19:40] take my time this is Wednesday night

[20:04] nowaday is come from the East that's
[20:06] just our nation but around the world
[20:08] there's an elect lady that I believe is
[20:10] ripening in the presence of almighty God
[20:14] I believe this message in
[20:16] itself is the power of God working in
[20:20] Souls of men and women that will
[20:21] literally bring them to the condition is
[20:24] bringing them to the condition of
[20:26] immortality I I'm not I'm not young

[20:45] when the soul changes when it picks up

[20:51] glory of God begins to uh shine in your
[20:53] heart you just can't see anything once

[21:13] but but just drop in a little bit in a
[21:15] certain little area I uh I wanted to T
[21:18] entitle my message
[21:20] tonight that we're singing that sweet
[21:23] sweet anointing and I'm going to read a
[21:25] quote after I read the scripture and
[21:27] draw my text from that little quote just
[21:29] to to reflect for a little while but
[21:31] let's read Colossians the 1 chapter and
[21:34] verse 12
[21:37] beginning giving thanks unto the Father
[21:40] which hath made us meat to be partakers
[21:42] of the inheritance of the Saints and
[21:43] light who hath delivered us from the
[21:46] power of darkness and hath translated us
[21:50] into the kingdom of his dear son that's
[21:54] a good place to be your spiritual
[21:56] position in Christ am in whom we have
[22:00] the Redemption through his blood even
[22:03] the Forgiveness of
[22:06] sins who is the image of the invisible
[22:09] God the firstborn of every creature for
[22:12] by him were all things created that are
[22:13] in
[22:14] heaven and that are in Earth visible
[22:18] invisible whether they are Thrones or
[22:19] dominions or principalities or Powers
[22:22] all things were created by Him and for
[22:25] him and he is before all things by him
[22:28] all things consist and he is the head of
[22:32] the body the church and we call her the
[22:34] bride but the church who is the
[22:38] beginning the first born from the dead
[22:41] that in all things he might have the
[22:45] preeminence for it pleased the father
[22:48] that in him should all fullness dwell
[22:51] and having made peace through the cross
[22:53] or through the blood of his cross by him
[22:57] to reconcile all things unto himself by
[22:59] him I say whether things in the Earth or
[23:02] things in heaven and you that were
[23:05] sometimes alate and enemies in your
[23:07] minds by Wicked Works yet now hath he
[23:10] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[23:12] through death to present you holy and
[23:16] unblamable and unreprovable in his sight
[23:20] amen if you continue in the faith
[23:22] grounded and settled and be not moved
[23:24] away from the hope of the Gospel which
[23:26] is which ye have
[23:28] heard which was preached to every
[23:31] creature which is under Heaven whereof I
[23:34] Paul am made a minister amen Lord we ask
[23:38] your blessing on your word it's already
[23:39] blessed but bless it to our hearts and
[23:42] to our souls father thank you now for
[23:45] your word we ask in Jesus Christ's name
[23:47] amen amen you may be
[23:51] seated and I didn't ask them to put this
[23:53] up but let me just read a little a quote
[23:55] here and uh this is an old quote but uh
[23:59] I I kind of
[24:02] uh would like to make it make draw my
[24:05] thought from there and said uh because
[24:08] we're thinking about the sweet anointing
[24:09] that's upon a people brother Bram makes
[24:12] a little comment here said some people
[24:14] gets the wrong impression of what the
[24:16] anointing
[24:18] is did you ever think of that he said
[24:21] when was the greatest anointing ever
[24:23] given to anyone and what did it
[24:26] do when they had that
[24:29] anointing the greatest anointing that
[24:31] was ever given to anyone was Jesus
[24:33] Christ he was the spirit we have the
[24:37] spirit by measure but he had it without
[24:39] measure and one day when he entered into
[24:42] the temple and picked up the scroll and
[24:44] read the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[24:47] for he hath anointed me to preach the
[24:49] acceptable year of the Lord and to bind
[24:52] up the Brokenhearted to heal the sick
[24:53] and give sight to the blind
[24:55] now he laid down the scr scroll you know
[24:58] the scripture well and look there and he
[24:59] laid it down and he stood back and uh he
[25:03] laid the scroll down and he said this
[25:05] day is this scripture fulfilled in your
[25:09] ears now we would think in such an
[25:12] anointing as was on
[25:14] him he had been prophesied 800 years
[25:17] before that it would come and here it
[25:20] was in type and in full anointing the
[25:23] full blessing and the anointing of the
[25:24] Lord upon him we would want to run all
[25:28] over the building screaming
[25:30] holler and that's all right I don't
[25:33] think didn't say it was wrong but that
[25:36] kind of anointing that was built up 800
[25:38] years and that had been prophesied here
[25:40] is the fullness of the word embodied and
[25:43] he standing there takes the scroll and
[25:45] begins to declare himself who he
[25:48] is right that he is the one that created
[25:52] all things yet he took upon the form of
[25:56] humanity to redeem he didn't have to do
[25:58] anything but did all things for his own
[26:00] glory for his own self and here he's
[26:02] standing now and he said it would make
[26:03] us what to shout and scream and
[26:07] holler but the Bible said he laid down
[26:10] the scroll he sat down and precious
[26:14] words proceeded from his
[26:17] mouth that's
[26:19] what's that's what he done under that
[26:22] anointing the anointing is not
[26:25] emotion the anointing is the supreme
[26:28] power in
[26:31] control I want you to just you feed on
[26:34] that during the week let it roll through
[26:36] your heart the anointing the true
[26:37] anointing is supreme power in
[26:41] control now this is if somebody show
[26:43] somebody's going to preach this much
[26:44] better than I ever would or every can
[26:46] make reference to it because I'm not a
[26:48] teacher but uh I can just hear some of
[26:50] the things right think of all the powers
[26:52] they're trying to take control of this
[26:54] day of our human race of the world over
[26:57] what's the biggest what's the struggles
[26:59] it's all going about right now to cease
[27:01] power and be supremely in
[27:07] control it's the nature of man it's the
[27:09] nature of people that want to do that
[27:11] but you know they never will we know who
[27:13] supremely in
[27:14] control but listen I said the anointing
[27:17] is not emotion the anointing is supreme
[27:20] power in control knowing exactly what
[27:23] and
[27:25] how that's what's here now
[27:28] you might not be able to understand it
[27:30] as you walk he's talking about the
[27:32] prayer line he's standing in the prayer
[27:33] line you might not be able to get it but
[27:36] I challenge your faith to this you come
[27:39] and believe what I have told you
[27:42] remember what the angel told him if you
[27:44] can get the people to believe you what
[27:46] you have said that this is the anointed
[27:49] word as was told by the scripture what
[27:51] Malachi prophesied this is that this is
[27:53] our day of visitation if you believe
[27:56] that it's not me a man speaking but it's
[27:58] God speaking through the veil that you
[28:00] can see the man but recognize God one
[28:04] saw a man one saw God the same word now
[28:07] you say oh deifying I'm think I'm
[28:09] preaching a deity here
[28:11] today
[28:12] absolutely I believe I'm preaching to
[28:14] deity being a part of deity and we're
[28:16] all a part of deity to begin with or
[28:18] we'll never
[28:20] be for there's only one form of eternal
[28:23] life right it didn't start it didn't end
[28:27] your body had a beginning and it'll have
[28:28] an end this flesh but not the real Soul
[28:32] that's right amen I love that he said I
[28:35] challenge your faith to this you come
[28:38] and believe what I have told you and
[28:39] watch what'll happen see just just
[28:42] believe what's been told you and see
[28:44] what happens the anointing of the Lord
[28:46] is in the temple in the Tabernacle this
[28:48] morning he said amen and he says Amen to
[28:52] that I say Amen to that I do believe
[28:55] that the greatest that the only way way
[28:57] to see God is to recognize him in the
[28:59] day that you live
[29:01] in oh it's good to preach to God most
[29:04] everybody looks back and they preaching
[29:05] about the God of history and and uh the
[29:08] great things that he
[29:09] did but I do not believe that that and
[29:13] any church AG look at the here's the
[29:15] prophet when he became and he came on
[29:16] the scene and and uh he begins to pull
[29:19] out these doctrines that we so love I
[29:23] remember when we first got the church
[29:24] aid
[29:25] book oh my
[29:28] it was nightly we were just sitting
[29:30] together and comparing notes how did the
[29:33] Lord reveal those seven angels and The
[29:35] Seven Ages and pull them out and bring
[29:37] them and showed forth those Mysteries
[29:39] well we didn't understand it until the
[29:41] Seven Seals was revealed then we
[29:42] understood then when the light began to
[29:44] shine on the
[29:46] word it became a living word in the age
[29:49] that we live
[29:50] in we're not feeding on a
[29:53] man this is not some man's
[29:56] anointing we're feeding on the the body
[29:59] word of the son of man the word word
[30:02] sell body to body it's building a body
[30:05] ready that's fit that's not fit for this
[30:07] Earth the way it's conditioned right now
[30:10] you're not really that's why you
[30:12] everything you see you can look through
[30:15] and you see by Vision Divine Vision
[30:17] what's the nature behind it cuz
[30:19] everything produces of its
[30:21] kind let me read you another another
[30:23] little part and you know just U
[30:25] Fellowship a little bit around uh
[30:27] the things that I that we all do believe
[30:29] amen I believe it's a pure word of
[30:34] God a little message called recognizing
[30:36] your day and its
[30:40] message Jesus was the promise of the
[30:43] scripture Vindicated to the woman he's
[30:45] talking about the woman at the
[30:47] well Jesus was the interpretation of the
[30:51] scripture he was the interpretation of
[30:53] his own life interpreted the scripture
[30:56] yes
[30:58] now you see what's been interpreted this
[31:00] day is the scripture his own life no
[31:03] other it wasn't William bram's life that
[31:05] did it it was Christ veiled interpreting
[31:08] his own word and he's still doing don't
[31:11] you see the message of the
[31:13] Hour his own life interpreted the
[31:16] scripture he said don't you see the
[31:17] message of the hour can you recognize
[31:19] where we're at the message itself from
[31:22] the scripture interprets to you the hour
[31:24] that we're living in praise God oh you
[31:27] say we say that oh well I see that you
[31:29] know in Israel is going on this now I do
[31:31] believe I do believe the prophet said
[31:33] very plainly he said if you want to know
[31:34] what time you're in in the time Piece of
[31:37] Time watch
[31:39] Israel didn't give that Gentiles that he
[31:41] said watch Israel that's natural kingdom
[31:44] and there's going to be people born in
[31:46] one one hour a nation will be born but
[31:49] to the Gentile bride that's not of
[31:51] course that's not the bride
[31:53] sign that say well we see the look at
[31:55] all the world and the sodomite condition
[31:58] they are signs but that's not what we're
[32:00] feeding on we're feeding on the word of
[32:03] God that line upon line pries upon pries
[32:06] is building a body that's maturing as
[32:08] it's laying in the presence of the word
[32:10] look when the prophet went off the scene
[32:11] what did he say what she needs to do the
[32:13] bride right now is not a new
[32:16] message not somebody starting up and
[32:18] saying oh I got you know how it is every
[32:20] time there little the holy spirit moves
[32:22] a little bit watch how wants to go left
[32:24] or right that's right always go over
[32:27] word like there's going to be another
[32:28] oneman Ministry now you know it's not
[32:30] going to be it's not
[32:32] prophesied we've got thus sayith the
[32:35] Lord and the brides got thus say to the
[32:36] Lord or Jesus shuts up she don't say it
[32:39] if if he didn't say it there's no sense
[32:40] saying it because it's not
[32:42] said but if he said it stay with it if
[32:46] he said it just stay right with it see
[32:49] Jesus his own
[32:51] life interpreted the
[32:54] scripture don't you see the message of
[32:56] there can you re as we're at the message
[32:58] itself from the scripture Jesus said to
[33:01] Israel if you had only known your day
[33:05] one time sitting there in Mount of
[33:06] Olives he looked over and said Jerusalem
[33:07] Jerusalem he wept he looked down and he
[33:10] seen it he said oh if you'd only
[33:13] recognize your day not in any comparison
[33:16] maybe that way but the other night he
[33:18] said the other morning about 10:00 I I
[33:21] saw a preview of The Prostitute
[33:25] Church down in my heart he said I felt
[33:28] the Holy Spirit dropping
[33:31] tears he said Jerusalem I said I felt
[33:33] like saying Jerusalem Jerusalem how of I
[33:36] would have hovered you but you didn't
[33:38] want
[33:39] to you killed the prophets that I sent
[33:43] you you murdered them and the message
[33:46] has been sent to the church today and
[33:49] has been murdered by their
[33:50] denominational dogmas and the scriptures
[33:53] been murdered by their dogmas and Jesus
[33:55] said if you'd only known your
[33:58] day but it's too far now it's too late
[34:02] now so is it with the churches I do
[34:05] believe with all my heart that she has
[34:07] passed Redemption then he goes on and
[34:09] begins to indict not spoke the Mage
[34:12] indictment which I'm not going to speak
[34:13] on right now but if they would have only
[34:15] known their day each day God pulled out
[34:19] an elect lady in each day that
[34:20] recognized her day and her
[34:23] hour that's the age I believe we're
[34:25] living in right now this is
[34:28] not a new
[34:30] message we're not preaching anything new
[34:33] you know exactly you go find them every
[34:34] one of I'm not going to read them all
[34:36] but but I do believe it don't you see
[34:38] what I mean he said the message called
[34:40] believing
[34:41] God do you get what I mean then in there
[34:44] is a spirit he's talking about
[34:46] immortality then a man that's born of
[34:48] the spirit of God does not commit sin
[34:52] amen oh I I this makes us feel good
[34:56] because I I believe that there's a spot
[34:58] sinless spotless bride of Jesus Christ
[35:01] on the Earth right now
[35:03] Hallelujah not that makes us sin
[35:06] sinless imperfect but let listen to how
[35:09] he reads it I know you've read this so
[35:10] often you probably shouted around your
[35:12] table when you read you know when you
[35:13] have Fellowship sometimes you read
[35:15] certain things said oh said you know
[35:17] like that little boy said Mama that's me
[35:18] that's how I feel so many times when I'm
[35:20] reading said oh that's me he's talking
[35:21] about yes sir I identify myself right
[35:24] there in the word this message is me
[35:27] that's right we've had all kinds of
[35:29] confusions and all kinds of people
[35:31] rising up and and challenging the
[35:33] message I tell you what I've challenged
[35:35] myself to I believe the message I'm
[35:38] challenging myself every day Lord not
[35:40] just believe in it but it manifesting
[35:43] itself in my
[35:44] life the walking word The Living Word
[35:47] the reality of God in every manner the
[35:50] worshiper once Pur has no more desire of
[35:53] sin that's where I look at myself now I
[35:56] look one things I might get a lot of
[35:57] mistakes but I have no desire for
[35:59] unbelief and sin in my
[36:01] life no
[36:05] turn no more conscious in the Old
[36:07] Testament of course the worshiper
[36:08] offered and he goes back a little bit
[36:10] let me take a little time with that and
[36:11] he went back and but what the Old
[36:14] Testament we know what happened under
[36:15] the blood of bulls and
[36:17] Golds they were sorry for their sins
[36:19] they knew they're Sinners went and made
[36:21] the thing right offered came back with
[36:23] the same
[36:25] desire but it's not so with the blood of
[36:27] Jesus Christ once baptized into that
[36:31] Kingdom once filled with the Holy Ghost
[36:33] you walk away your desire for sin is
[36:35] gone you don't want to disbelieve the
[36:36] word of God the only sin that really is
[36:38] unbelief in the word drinking smoking
[36:41] gambling the prophet said adultery so
[36:43] that's not sin that's attributes of
[36:44] unbelief so if you if you're born of the
[36:47] spirit of God I don't mean to hurt
[36:48] anybody but if you're born of the spirit
[36:49] of God those things are dead in your
[36:51] life so well I'm still tempted yes as
[36:54] long as you're in this body you will be
[36:57] that doesn't mean you're not a Christian
[36:58] being tempted right that just means
[37:01] you're a part of the
[37:02] Overcomer we're talking about Overcomers
[37:05] here people that's overcome all the
[37:07] Creeds and the dogmas that tries to
[37:09] attach itself to the word that's right
[37:12] there's a lot of denominational Spirits
[37:14] trying to attach themselves to this word
[37:16] and use the power of God to verify their
[37:20] Vindication listen we're not interested
[37:22] in that we're interested in one thing
[37:24] Lord you said it and I believe it
[37:26] whether even I understand it or
[37:29] not how many could have how which one of
[37:31] us could say I understand God it's
[37:34] impossible as long as we're in this
[37:36] finite body how can the finite identify
[37:40] it with the
[37:42] infinite you know he's it's so beyond us
[37:45] but something drops way down said but by
[37:48] faith Noah by faith Abraham by Faith by
[37:51] Revelation every one the Church of Jesus
[37:53] Christ is built all the way through she
[37:55] is the revelation ofes Jesus
[37:57] Christ everyone played the part each one
[38:00] looking for the next one to play but now
[38:03] the last one the last trumpet it sounded
[38:06] to the Gentile church here now you know
[38:08] the Israel are not going to we're not
[38:10] going to tie them in here right now but
[38:12] you know what they're longing for where
[38:13] they're at right now all these years
[38:16] sometimes I you know I'm you're sure
[38:18] like me we stop and we think over 70
[38:21] years already they've waited whole
[38:23] Generations have died waiting for the
[38:27] confirmation of the word still trying to
[38:30] start the Old Testament worship the red
[38:32] hepher trying to build not
[38:35] realizing that this is going to be a
[38:37] nation born in a day but what what what
[38:40] the the glory when we when we think of
[38:41] her
[38:43] Deliverance but the little elect lady
[38:45] think oh if you could just go tell them
[38:47] about it but no matter how many you
[38:48] remember how brother B says no matter
[38:50] how Bibles you send there how much you
[38:51] preach Jesus Christ oh there's some Jews
[38:53] saved but not Israel there's Jews that
[38:57] saved I'm thankful for that he said but
[39:01] um a little further in this message of
[39:02] believing God he said but but here it is
[39:06] in the Hebrews when when the worshipper
[39:08] in this case when he puts his hand on
[39:09] the son of God's head and the sins are
[39:11] purged by the sanctifying power of God
[39:13] there is no more desire of sin left
[39:16] there there is where your life lays
[39:19] that's what makes you an offspring of
[39:21] Jehovah amen and Satan can't hurt you
[39:25] without hurting the father
[39:27] father because you're an expression of
[39:29] the Father which one of us and we he
[39:31] said you can't hurt that little girl
[39:33] without hurting me and his little
[39:34] daughter sitting there said you can't
[39:35] hurt her without hurting
[39:37] me I tell you that you can't hurt your
[39:40] children without hurting you and then it
[39:43] he is not willing that any of them
[39:45] should be should perish but now before
[39:47] the flesh here before the flesh is
[39:49] perfected now here's where we're sitting
[39:51] right now before our flesh is even
[39:55] perfected we have to die like our soul
[39:59] dies as long as we're in this flesh
[40:02] there is no perfection in this
[40:04] flesh this Veil is the only thing that's
[40:08] bothering you
[40:10] yet but it too and when we are dead and
[40:15] God has recognized our repentance and
[40:17] recognized our baptism he recognizes the
[40:20] blood of his own son which by faith has
[40:23] been applied and recognized by for
[40:25] ordination and knowed what it would do
[40:28] and has recognized me to be Christ and
[40:30] I'm dead then Christ died in my place
[40:33] when he was slain before the foundation
[40:35] of the world and my name was put in the
[40:37] book as a
[40:38] Christian I like that God oh doesn't
[40:42] that make you feel good baby look way
[40:44] back there when he put up the book and
[40:46] he placed names in
[40:49] there my name is put in the book as a
[40:52] Christian Hallelujah Christ died my
[40:55] Death Christ Christ is my sacrifice and
[40:58] God could not
[41:00] impute to me sin
[41:03] anymore he give me the Seal of the Holy
[41:05] Ghost as a witness that I passed from
[41:07] Death unto life Oh my he said doesn't
[41:09] that make us feel good when they're born
[41:12] been born of the spirit of God they do
[41:14] not commit
[41:16] sin for he that he cannot sin for the
[41:18] Old Testament said so it takes people he
[41:21] goes on to say the Hebrews he said now
[41:24] perfect it forever worship the worshiper
[41:26] one Purge Hebrews
[41:27] 10 has no more conscience of sin so you
[41:31] take the people that runs to church and
[41:32] jump up and down and shout and speak in
[41:34] tongues and then act that anyway like
[41:36] that Christian and run out and the next
[41:37] day they're back next week they're back
[41:38] in they're coming whenever they come see
[41:41] they're only impersonating for the Bible
[41:42] said the holy spirit is a seal to us and
[41:45] Christ and seals us unto the day of our
[41:49] Redemption not till the next
[41:52] Revival amen that's what makes me rest
[41:55] assured cuz God promised
[41:58] it I believe that's this message what
[42:00] what it does it gives such a rest that
[42:03] that there's nothing in the
[42:05] world can separate you from the love of
[42:09] God it's peace it's
[42:12] Joy you can't get so low to where
[42:15] sometimes you feel like is it worth it
[42:18] but check it out where it comes
[42:20] from the voices that speak to try to
[42:22] always trying to contradict the word of
[42:23] God but a real Christian takes it back
[42:26] to the word always no matter what
[42:27] happens I want to just take one little
[42:29] part here a little message called called
[42:31] uh the inner Veil and you know how
[42:33] brother Bram talks about so many things
[42:35] I like to read this when we have
[42:36] communion foot
[42:38] washing you know just to see how far his
[42:41] grace has taken us from sin there's not
[42:45] even the smell of sin around a
[42:48] Christian that doesn't mean your flesh
[42:50] is
[42:52] perfect never look at your flesh to be
[42:54] perfect it never will be
[42:57] I'm not encouraging young people or old
[42:59] people or said then I can do what I want
[43:01] you know what I always do I like what
[43:04] brother baham says well I could do what
[43:05] I want oh said if I knew that if I could
[43:07] live and that would be sin free and that
[43:09] oh I would I ever live it up that's what
[43:12] Christians do they really live it up
[43:16] they live so close to the master they
[43:17] look like the master they walk with him
[43:20] they talk with them they sing with them
[43:22] they're born of another
[43:24] world you can't help it
[43:26] you can never feel at home no matter
[43:28] where you go build the nicest home you

[43:37] through our Treasures are lit UPL
[43:40] somewhere beyond the blue I don't know
[43:42] where they're at but they're laying
[43:43] they're waiting for
[43:46] us you know I'm that telling most of you
[43:49] know but I just turned the the magical
[43:52] number you know 80 to I know a year and

[44:01] thought oh maybe run 70 oh my now I'm 80
[44:04] and I'm thinking oh my I want to live a
[44:05] little
[44:06] longer fact I want to live as long as he
[44:09] lets me I'd like to walk right into the
[44:13] Rapture I like to feel that feel that
[44:16] feeling lift one foot and it wouldn't
[44:17] come
[44:18] down I kind of like to feel the aches go
[44:21] out of it and begin to realize wait a
[44:23] minute what's
[44:24] happening sir I used to have black
[44:26] hair and even more hair now I have to
[44:30] comb them all very carefully so they
[44:31] stay in
[44:33] place but there's a full head
[44:35] somewhere everyone you know don't you
[44:37] love those those uh albums you know the
[44:40] old books you they put them all together
[44:42] you all said wow I take pictures we're
[44:44] not going to be here that
[44:45] long looks pretty good said oh look at
[44:48] me oh look at me why look at that black
[44:51] hair straight
[44:53] shoulders straight ties they hang
[44:55] straight
[44:58] these ones have bubbles in them these on
[45:00] but we had them in those days they were
[45:02] there a but there's a land calling where
[45:06] mortal will be swallowed up to
[45:10] immortality don't ever worry about
[45:12] sowing The Good Seed just walk with God
[45:14] sew it wherever you go tell them about
[45:16] the goodness of God tell them that
[45:17] you're from another
[45:19] kingdom yeah they might call US
[45:21] aliens it's all right we were Alias
[45:25] rather but I like this part he said you
[45:27] know he talking about red through red is
[45:29] white and you know in the little
[45:31] paragraph there in the inner Veil and uh
[45:33] but he gets to that one little part and
[45:34] he said now God looked through the blood
[45:37] he doesn't see you anymore as a sinner
[45:39] amen he sees you
[45:42] redeemed amen you're redeemed
[45:45] because he's always seen you through
[45:50] Christ did you did did do we realize he
[45:53] has always seen you through through
[45:56] Christ that's the reason when the word
[45:58] of God went and struck when the light of
[46:00] the word of God struck your soul
[46:02] something inside says that sounds like
[46:05] home to me I don't even understand it I
[46:07] don't even know what just happened but
[46:09] something begin to move and it begin to
[46:11] draw you like a magnet we sing about
[46:14] that when the Great magnet brother Hank
[46:15] used to sing that when the Great magnet
[46:17] from above and we we took it from the
[46:19] song where brother Bram preached about
[46:20] the great magnet in the Africa said what
[46:22] happens to all the other stuff how come
[46:24] it's not going up said oh that's it's
[46:28] aluminum it's not for
[46:30] everybody you know L message is far from
[46:32] everybody there's a lot of people even
[46:34] around the message is not for them
[46:37] they're just acting like it is but give
[46:39] them the word and start talking about
[46:41] the real Born Again reality they look at
[46:44] you kind of strange said huh what's
[46:47] that but oh if you're ever a born of God
[46:51] you have a new nature a new spirit and
[46:53] then you got his spirit thank you you
[46:56] can get along with one another
[46:59] amen look it doesn't matter to me what
[47:02] church you go to in this area right
[47:06] there's no brand but the brand of the
[47:08] Holy
[47:10] Spirit yes I I tell you what I'm I'm I'm
[47:13] just one of those I tell you don't
[47:15] matter where I go I'm not interested in
[47:17] the brand we're wearing what church we
[47:19] have and we've got nice buildings now
[47:21] day but you know none of those buildings
[47:22] are going in the
[47:24] rapture you're not even going as a
[47:26] church you're going as
[47:29] individuals you're sitting there with an
[47:31] individual birth said yeah he stopped by
[47:34] my place the almighty God saved me and
[47:38] because I preach I'm not saved but Wars
[47:40] me for a greater judgment will be to us
[47:42] preachers than it will be to the rest of
[47:44] you for we have taught the way of
[47:46] life that we might also walk in the way
[47:49] of life not just teach it but here this
[47:52] is a beautiful I I close with this if
[47:54] the musicians want to come up I I'd
[47:56] appreciate that I would like to sing a
[47:58] song at the end of this
[48:00] part but it goes to say
[48:04] this oh he said you're not perfect he
[48:07] said that's the reason uh we can be
[48:10] perfect said you're redeemed because
[48:13] he's always seen you through Christ
[48:14] that's the reason we can be perfect not
[48:17] because we are in the sense of sinless
[48:21] we're perfect in the eyes of God when
[48:23] we're in Christ that's the reason he
[48:25] said be you therefore perfect even as
[48:27] your father which is in heaven is
[48:29] perfect now that's not just put in the
[48:31] Bible just to be the good
[48:33] writing that's there because that's
[48:35] exactly what he's looking for that's who
[48:36] he's coming for the ones that are
[48:38] offsprings of God well God's perfect
[48:41] amise God but he put you in a body so he
[48:43] could become a savior A Healer but most
[48:47] of all he put you there because he's
[48:48] your
[48:50] lord there's a lot of people claim him
[48:52] to be their savior their healer and even
[48:55] Jesus Jus the name but which Jesus the
[48:58] one of the word the one that Vindicated
[49:00] itself in this last day according to
[49:02] Malachi 4 Revelations 10:7 that God that
[49:04] Jesus or the one that the church says is
[49:06] our Jesus
[49:08] right as many many are claiming the name
[49:11] of Jesus but there's one Lord Jesus
[49:13] Christ yes sir there's one Lord Jesus
[49:16] Christ that's the reason be you there
[49:18] for Paul in the 10th chapter of Hebrews
[49:20] was trying to explain the shadow of the
[49:21] law of Good and Evil of the law of the
[49:23] Old Testament and blood of so on but
[49:25] could never make the come or there under
[49:28] perfect because they were looking
[49:30] through animal blood but
[49:32] now looks through the blood of his son
[49:35] Perfection came by Jesus Christ
[49:38] am now I'm not perfect in your sight and
[49:41] you're not perfect in my sight right if
[49:44] we if you came tonight to find fault
[49:46] you've already found quite a
[49:48] bit that's all right because there is no
[49:52] perfection in the
[49:53] humanity our actions are different
[49:55] differ our ways are different some are
[49:58] quiet and some are loud and some don't
[50:00] say anything and some are very
[50:02] energetic but you're a human being just
[50:05] the
[50:06] same never judge a person by their
[50:08] outward actions even watch what their
[50:11] love and desires when it comes around
[50:12] the word of God that's what I that's
[50:14] what's
[50:15] important that's where it lays he said
[50:17] right there he said now said I'm not
[50:19] perfect you're not perfect but what
[50:20] about what God sees what about in God's
[50:24] sight
[50:26] that's where it lays and if you're born
[50:28] again in the body of Christ then God
[50:31] looks upon you as perfect as Christ was
[50:35] himself
[50:38] amen nothing you can do it's not any
[50:43] works that you can do at all it's by
[50:45] grace that God has give you this offer
[50:48] amen amen I like
[50:51] that give you this offer and if you've
[50:54] accepted it in the sight of God you are
[50:58] perfect redeemed washed in the blood of
[51:02] the Lamb without fault without blemish
[51:05] without
[51:07] spot and he stops and said isn't that
[51:11] marvelous isn't that
[51:13] marvelous when he saw the preview of the
[51:16] Bride you know he said earlier here he
[51:19] very
[51:21] discouraged and he was he was crying he
[51:23] said Lord is that the best that all of
[51:27] the
[51:27] Vindication all the signs and the
[51:30] Miracles that have taken around the
[51:32] world and stood there and challenge the
[51:33] entire
[51:35] world if you think this is wrong come
[51:37] here and stand and take my
[51:39] place challenge the leaders the
[51:41] religious people of the world yes come
[51:44] here do the same thing that the holy
[51:46] spirit's doing in the in my
[51:48] life confessing to the world that it's
[51:51] not him doing it it's Christ doing
[51:53] it and all of that
[51:56] and he stood there and he wept and that
[51:58] sweet voice said the bride will come
[52:00] into preview one more time Hallelujah he
[52:03] said I turned to look I heard that
[52:05] beautiful
[52:06] music said here come that bride just
[52:10] like the first
[52:11] one just like that Pentecostal bride
[52:14] that's inaugurated there on the day of
[52:16] Pentecost that same Holy
[52:18] Spirit brought forth another bride
[52:21] through the perp through the purpose and
[52:24] the
[52:25] purpose of almighty God through the
[52:27] shedding of his own life he brought
[52:29] forth that same life in the resurrection
[52:32] look at the message that came up after
[52:34] all of the word died in the first church
[52:37] second third church but in the third or
[52:41] fourth fifth sixth 3 4 5 and come come
[52:45] rather up to the seventh here come back

[53:41] Amen to the word of God no matter what's

[1:02:44] so encouraging to me to know that before
[1:02:48] before that I would come to this earth
[1:02:51] before I would make my first mistake
