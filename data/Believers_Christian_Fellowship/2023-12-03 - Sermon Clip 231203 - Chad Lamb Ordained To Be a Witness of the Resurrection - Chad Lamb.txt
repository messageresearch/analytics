TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what were the disciples looking for they were looking for one qualified to be a witness of this Resurrection they thought in order to witness the resurrection you had to see the ministry in order to witness the resurrection you had to be there you had to hear his voice you had to follow the ministry you had to be there amen when you saw the crucifixion you had to know when he was arrested you had to know the circumstances about amen the stone that was rolled and the seal that was placed and you needed to have firsthand knowledge of all of those things to be a witness and you had to see him after he resurrected and you had to see him in his Corporal body that resurrected and you had to be there during the private conversations when he met his disciples amen and all of a sudden God bypassed all of that to be a witness of the Resurrection you don't need to see with fleshly eyes you don't have to have natural experience and Earthly experience to be a witness amen you have to have an encounter with the Living Word With Jesus Christ to awaken that Eternal part in you that was with him from the beginning to stand in your day to witness of Jesus Christ to witness of the resurrect Paul was a witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ cuz he met Jesus Christ but he didn't meet them the same way that the disciples met him in the resurrection amen he met him amen when he went back into the pillar of fire form that form that was now in the church amen because he says why persecutest thou me that Pillar of Fire was in the body of Believers and that's how Paul met him he didn't meet any other qualifications but he sure met God's qualific and if that was God's qualification to be a witness of the Resurrection then I stand here as a witness of the Resurrection cuz I've met the same qualification by the grace of God cuz I believe by faith that I was with him before the foundation of the world and he ordained me to come forth in this day and I was going Every Which Way But the right way but in some time he came to me and I met the pillar of fire the same one that that was here with the word the same one that had his picture taken over brother Bam's said the same one that brought the word is still here delivering the word and I come in contact with a living breathing Jesus Christ making me qualified to be a witness of his resurrection amen that's what makes me a witness of this message not because I was in the prayer lines not because I was in the meetings I wasn't born yet I didn't have to be born yet we can all be one born out of season praise God we're never born out of season we were born in season this is our season CU we've been ordained to be Witnesses of his resurrection
