[4:33] today
[4:34] amen
[4:36] well praise the lord we all want the
[4:38] same thing let's take our bibles while
[4:40] we're standing let's go straight into
[4:41] the word
[4:43] and let's look at first corinthians
[4:44] chapter three
[4:50] first corinthians chapter three
[4:56] i enjoyed hearing the update about
[4:58] sister marsha
[4:59] and continue to keep her prayers she's
[5:01] got a lot of recovering to do but god
[5:03] has been merciful to our sister
[5:06] he shined his grace and his love upon
[5:08] her
[5:08] and i know that god will bring her
[5:10] through just pray to go strengthen her
[5:12] and bless the family as they take care
[5:13] of her i know she's happy to get home i
[5:16] was able to talk to her for a little bit
[5:17] yesterday and she was cheerful on the
[5:20] phone and in good spirits and i thought
[5:22] after all that she's been through to be
[5:23] in good spirits and cheerful on the
[5:25] phone is amazing so i was encouraged by
[5:27] the call so just keep remembering her in
[5:29] prayer
[5:30] also this weekend saturday there'll be a
[5:32] minister's meeting in brighton michigan
[5:35] hosted by brother dan ratliff and he's
[5:37] invited us up so i'm going to be up
[5:39] there so be praying for that that god
[5:41] will just bless us in our fellowship
[5:42] there with the brothers
[5:44] and
[5:44] brother kyle's going to be ministering
[5:46] for us on sunday he's going to help me
[5:47] out with that so be praying for brother
[5:50] kyle
[5:51] as well
[5:52] amen let's look at first corinthians
[5:54] chapter 3 verse 5.
[5:58] who then is paul and who is apollos
[6:01] but ministers by whom he believed even
[6:03] as the lord gave to every man i have
[6:06] planted apollos water but god gave the
[6:08] increase so that neither is he that
[6:11] planteth anything neither he that
[6:12] watereth but god that giveth the
[6:14] increase
[6:15] now he that planteth and he that
[6:17] watereth are one and every man shall
[6:19] receive his own reward according to his
[6:21] own labor
[6:22] for we are laborers together
[6:24] with god
[6:26] this is interesting term and this is
[6:28] what i want to hone in on they're not
[6:30] laborers together for god
[6:33] they're laborers together with god
[6:36] that means they're in partnership with
[6:39] god
[6:40] laboring together for the church with
[6:42] god for we are laborers together with
[6:44] god
[6:44] you're god's husbandry you're god's
[6:46] field you're god's building god's temple
[6:50] so the work that god is doing working in
[6:52] his field and working in this building
[6:54] apollos and paul were laborers together
[6:57] with god in that field and in that
[6:59] building
[7:00] amen let's just bow our heads and pray
[7:04] dear heavenly father we thank you for
[7:05] your word that you've given to us lord
[7:08] we ask now in the name of jesus christ
[7:10] that you would come by the power of your
[7:11] spirit
[7:12] and take a gift lord that's laying in a
[7:14] clay vessel that you would take it in
[7:16] your hands and begin to minister lord
[7:18] the eternal word of life to us
[7:21] give us the thing that we have need of
[7:22] for this hour lord for this stage in our
[7:24] journey give us the instructions lord
[7:27] the leadership the guidance the
[7:28] correction that we need right now lord
[7:31] that we can be pleasing to you that we
[7:33] can be with your program walking in
[7:35] harmony with your program now you can be
[7:37] blessed lord and we desire to be a
[7:40] laborer with you as well
[7:42] in your field in your vineyard and in
[7:44] your building
[7:45] god use us for that as a tool in your
[7:47] hand we pray in jesus christ's name we
[7:50] pray amen
[7:51] you can be seated
[7:53] i want to take for a subject tonight if
[7:56] i can partnership with god
[7:59] and brother rem says in christ is the
[8:01] mystery of god revealed
[8:03] he says now all the great revelation now
[8:06] now to restore back his kinship to bring
[8:08] back now he had to let them get lost you
[8:11] understand he had to let them sin put
[8:14] them on free moral he he could not make
[8:16] them sin and remain god and then punish
[8:19] them for something he had made them do
[8:22] but when he put man on partnership with
[8:24] him then let men act as a free moral
[8:27] agency the same thing he's got you on
[8:29] today
[8:31] see you act any way you want to you are
[8:33] your free moral agent so therefore if we
[8:36] put the first like that he has to put
[8:38] the second like that he has to put
[8:40] everyone like that or he acted wrong in
[8:42] the first place see but everybody is on
[8:45] the same basis
[8:47] so brother branham is teaching us very
[8:49] clearly here that
[8:50] according to god's will and god's great
[8:52] plan when he knew that there would be a
[8:55] fall amen because he had a lamb slain
[8:58] from before the foundation of the world
[9:00] and if he had already in his mind a lamb
[9:02] slain from before the foundation of the
[9:04] world then he knew there would be a need
[9:06] for a sacrificial lamb
[9:08] and if he knew there would be a need
[9:10] then he knew there would be a fall and
[9:11] the fall worked together in god's great
[9:13] plan amen according to his great purpose
[9:15] that he had in his mind it all worked
[9:18] together but god to remain righteous and
[9:20] the main god he could not force man to
[9:22] sin amen so when god put man on
[9:25] partnership with him he put him on the
[9:27] basis of free moral agency
[9:30] and this is amazing what what what is
[9:32] the basis of our partnership with god
[9:34] the basis of our partnership is free
[9:36] moral agency we can act any way we want
[9:39] there's no forcing
[9:41] and i wrote down this phrase here if
[9:43] you'll just lock this in your mind
[9:47] if if god could not force man to sin
[9:51] then he cannot force them to act in
[9:53] righteousness
[9:57] see if you're going to have one you have
[9:58] to have the other
[10:00] if god could not force man into have
[10:03] fallen to sin then god cannot force man
[10:06] into righteousness amen man is on
[10:09] partnership with god and in that
[10:11] partnership with god man is on free
[10:13] moral agency to make his choice amen and
[10:16] god has partnered himself with man but
[10:19] given the man the power of free choice
[10:23] and so it's much more powerful i think
[10:25] than what we realize
[10:27] um
[10:28] there's a couple quotes here i want to
[10:29] read i want to take just a little
[10:31] deviation
[10:32] and you'll find out why in just a moment
[10:34] but
[10:35] brother bam says in the message adoption
[10:37] so now the book of ephesians as i just
[10:39] sang to my opinion is one of the
[10:41] greatest books of the new testament now
[10:44] when a prophet says something like that
[10:45] immediately radars go off and probably
[10:47] said one of the greatest books in the
[10:49] new testament did not want to be
[10:50] familiar with that book
[10:51] so to my opinion the book of ephesians
[10:54] in my opinion is one of the greatest
[10:55] books of the new testament it leaves us
[10:57] on where calvinism runs out on one limb
[11:00] and armenianism runs out on the other
[11:02] limb but the book of ephesians draws it
[11:04] together and positionally places the
[11:06] church
[11:07] so brother i'm saying calvinism goes out
[11:09] on one limb armenianism goes on on the
[11:11] other but the book of ephesians draws it
[11:12] back together amen where it's correct
[11:15] because calvinism if you look at extreme
[11:18] calvinism uh it is it is everything is
[11:21] purposed and pre-planned by god and
[11:23] really man has no choice in the matter
[11:26] he's just going along with the program
[11:27] and you don't have to worry about
[11:28] anything you don't have to do anything
[11:30] everything's fine
[11:32] god worked it out armenianism is and you
[11:34] know that must that's a crude definition
[11:36] so if there's a theologian in the house
[11:38] you'd be like oh by the chad
[11:40] but that's just in my own words
[11:42] armenianism is on the other hand what
[11:43] brother ben calls legalism
[11:45] armenianism is that you you by your
[11:48] conduct by your actions by your choice
[11:50] by your effort amen you obtain unto
[11:52] yourself salvation by your choice by
[11:54] your will by by exercising your will you
[11:57] you can obtain for yourself salvation
[12:00] and brother brahman says they they
[12:02] they're both wrong but they're not both
[12:04] completely wrong he says that here in a
[12:07] minute they're both wrong but ephesians
[12:09] draws the two ideas together so in order
[12:11] to understand god and understand the
[12:13] word you've got to take those two ideas
[12:14] and draw them together
[12:17] he says in questions and answers from 59
[12:20] i can't make calvinism just believe on
[12:22] the lord and you get eternal security
[12:24] and armenianism that if i just touch not
[12:27] handle not taste not i'd like to do it
[12:29] but but i can't do it armenianism is too
[12:32] far away from calvinism and they both
[12:34] are wrong
[12:36] i've got to see where they both got
[12:38] scriptures but it's got to hit the
[12:40] target
[12:41] now if god said one thing in the bible
[12:42] it's got to hit the target it's got to
[12:44] make every ring in that bible come right
[12:47] straight down to the bull's-eye it's got
[12:49] to do it because it's god's word and
[12:50] he's infinite and he can't change
[12:54] then in the patmos vision from 1960 he
[12:56] says and we use the word sometime it's
[12:58] predestination but it's a sure hanger in
[13:01] this church age that we live in it was
[13:04] certainly a great thing used in the days
[13:06] of the martyrs because they certainly
[13:07] believed it but it's got away from it
[13:09] now to the legalist idea the legalist
[13:11] teaching in the church which was a good
[13:13] thing because all of it had gone
[13:15] calvinistic in england until they didn't
[13:18] even have revivals anymore
[13:20] and john wesley came along preaching the
[13:22] armenian doctrine which balanced it up
[13:24] god will always balance it up
[13:27] so he'd gotten one side too far amen in
[13:30] this extreme calvinism where everybody
[13:33] there's no need to do missionary work
[13:35] there's no need to have evangelistic
[13:37] campaign everything that belongs to god
[13:39] will come to god amen he's already
[13:41] decided there's nothing to do and just
[13:44] they've gotten so lazy they've gotten
[13:46] into uh
[13:47] when when john wesley shows up the
[13:48] church had gotten into a state of such
[13:52] depravity such sin amen and such
[13:55] vulgarity within the ranks of the church
[13:57] because of the misunderstanding of
[13:59] eternal security
[14:01] that god said he'd allow john wesley and
[14:03] john wesley amen come out tearing this
[14:06] down but to do so he went over onto one
[14:08] extreme and now it was all by works and
[14:11] all by effort and and you climb your way
[14:13] up the ladder and you mess up you fall
[14:15] down and get back on the letter and
[14:16] climb your way up to the ladder amen and
[14:18] one an extreme is just as bad as the
[14:20] other in extreme but brother branham was
[14:22] saying they both have scriptures amen in
[14:24] ephesians draws them together
[14:26] so i'd like to take a look at several
[14:28] scriptures in ephesians if we can turn
[14:30] there together and just bear with me
[14:32] like in a bible study so we're in a
[14:34] bible study
[14:36] so
[14:37] i say that so you have the right
[14:38] expectation
[14:39] it means we're going to read a lot of
[14:41] scriptures together
[14:42] in a bible study on this wednesday night
[14:45] but i want to see what brother branham's
[14:47] talking about because this uh this
[14:50] for me uh lays a foundation for what
[14:53] i've been thinking on and meditating on
[14:55] about this partnership with god in
[14:58] ephesians chapter 1 verse 1
[15:01] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[15:03] will of god
[15:05] so right out of the shoot paul starts
[15:07] off paul is an apostle not by anything
[15:10] that he has done paul is an apostle by
[15:12] the will of god
[15:14] paul and the apostle jesus christ by the
[15:16] will of god to the saints which are at
[15:18] ephesus and to the faithful in christ
[15:20] jesus
[15:21] grace be to you in peace from god our
[15:23] father and from the lord jesus christ
[15:26] blessed be the god and father of our
[15:28] lord jesus christ who hath blessed us
[15:30] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[15:32] places in christ
[15:34] according as he hath chosen us in him
[15:36] before the foundation of the world that
[15:39] we should be holy and without blame
[15:41] before him in love
[15:42] now you see right out of the shoot right
[15:45] in the beginning of ephesians paul the
[15:47] apostle paul was laying down amen
[15:49] foundational understanding that that he
[15:53] was apostle by the will of god not by
[15:55] any merit any works that he had done but
[15:57] by god's will and now we are blessed in
[15:59] christ jesus
[16:01] because according
[16:03] as he has chosen us in him
[16:06] when
[16:07] before the foundation of the world
[16:10] that we should be holy and without blame
[16:12] before him in love so god chose us in
[16:16] christ before the foundation of the
[16:17] world so that we would be holy
[16:20] and without blame before him in love
[16:23] now now these are foundational
[16:25] statements that he's going to build the
[16:27] thoughts in the book of ephesians upon
[16:29] this understanding
[16:32] verse 5 having predestinated us unto the
[16:34] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[16:37] himself according to the good pleasure
[16:39] of
[16:40] his will
[16:42] so the same thing that made apostle paul
[16:45] that made paul an apostle is the same
[16:47] thing that's chosen us
[16:49] predestinated us
[16:52] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[16:55] when he hath made us accepted in the
[16:57] beloved who made who
[16:59] he made us accepted in the beloved in
[17:02] whom we have redemption through his
[17:04] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[17:06] to the riches of his grace wherein he
[17:09] hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
[17:11] and prudence having made known unto us
[17:13] the mystery of his will according to his
[17:16] good pleasure which he has purposed in
[17:18] himself
[17:20] so so far how much have you had to do
[17:23] in the book of ephesians
[17:25] nothing you've done nothing not your
[17:27] idea not your thought not your will not
[17:29] your pleasure
[17:30] this these statements so far has nothing
[17:32] to do with you it is all based off what
[17:34] god wanted
[17:37] praise god now remember ephesians is
[17:39] pulling two thoughts together
[17:42] amen
[17:43] so let's keep reading
[17:45] verse 10
[17:47] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[17:48] of times he might gather together in one
[17:50] all things in christ both which are in
[17:52] heaven and which are on earth even in
[17:54] him
[17:55] in whom also we have obtained an
[17:57] inheritance being predestinated
[17:59] according to the purpose of him who
[18:01] worketh all things after the council of
[18:03] his own will that we should be to the
[18:06] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[18:08] christ in whom he also trusted after
[18:10] that you heard the word of truth the
[18:12] gospel of your salvation in whom also
[18:14] that you have believed you were sealed
[18:16] with the holy spirit of promise which is
[18:18] the earnest of our inheritance until the
[18:20] redemption of the purchased possession
[18:23] unto the praise of his glory
[18:26] so praise god i can read ephesians and
[18:29] start feeling pretty good
[18:31] because it's all his purpose his plan
[18:34] his will his design his foreign nation
[18:37] his predestination his work his
[18:40] sacrifice
[18:42] let's go to chapter 2
[18:44] verse 1.
[18:47] and you hath thee quickened who were
[18:48] dead in trespasses and sins
[18:51] where in time past you walked according
[18:52] to the course of this world according to
[18:54] the prince of the power of the air the
[18:56] spirit that now worketh in the children
[18:58] of disobedience among whom also we all
[19:01] had our conversation in times past and
[19:03] the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[19:05] desires of the flesh and of the mind and
[19:07] we're by nature the children of wrath
[19:09] even as others
[19:10] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[19:13] great love wherewith he loved us
[19:15] even when we were dead in sins
[19:18] hath quickened us together with christ
[19:21] by grace are ye saved
[19:26] when you were dead
[19:28] he loved you
[19:29] he chose you in christ
[19:32] not
[19:33] after you decided to do good
[19:36] but when when you were doing
[19:38] everything he says
[19:41] in verse 2 where and in time past you
[19:43] walked according to the course of this
[19:45] world according to the prince of the
[19:47] power of the air the spirit thou now
[19:49] worketh in the children of disobedience
[19:51] that's how we walked
[19:54] that's the condition we were in when we
[19:56] come to this life and in verse 3 he says
[19:58] among whom also we all had our
[20:00] conversation paul includes himself there
[20:05] in past the uh in times past in the lust
[20:08] of our flesh fulfilling the desire of
[20:09] the flesh and of the mind and we're by
[20:11] nature the children of wrath even as
[20:13] others
[20:14] so you realize it was god's mercy by
[20:17] god's grace it was not our merit because
[20:20] we were all lumped into the same place
[20:23] and now no ability to come right in
[20:25] order to obtain god's mercy amen but it
[20:28] was god's grace that shed his mercy but
[20:30] we were yet dead in trespasses and
[20:32] sins verse 6 and hath raised us up
[20:36] together and made us sit together in
[20:37] heavenly places in christ jesus who
[20:40] raised who who did the work
[20:43] what ladder did you climb to get there
[20:46] how much did you sweat
[20:48] how hard was it
[20:50] he raises together
[20:53] amen to sit together in heavenly places
[20:55] in christ jesus then in the ages
[20:58] to come he might show the exceeding
[21:00] riches of his grace and his kindness
[21:02] toward us through christ for by grace
[21:04] are you saved through faith and that not
[21:06] of yourselves it is the gift of god
[21:09] not of works lest any man should boast
[21:11] for we are his workmanship created in
[21:13] christ jesus unto good works which god
[21:16] hath before ordained that we should walk
[21:18] in them
[21:19] so we are god's workman his
[21:22] craftsmanship the thing that he's making
[21:24] we are his whatever he's forming we're
[21:27] created in christ jesus unto good works
[21:29] so god has crafted us and made us to be
[21:31] a vessel of good works but those good
[21:34] works are what he hath ordained that we
[21:36] should walk in them so what we are going
[21:38] to do the good things that we'll
[21:39] accomplish are the things that were
[21:41] ordained before the foundation of the
[21:43] world that he ordained for us to do not
[21:45] that we conjured up in our mind and
[21:47] decided to do because we were good
[21:48] people
[21:50] if we do anything we do what what he
[21:52] leads us to do we do things by his will
[21:54] and by his
[21:56] foreknowledge chapter 3
[21:59] verse 1. i'm just pulling segments out
[22:02] not reading the whole thing to save time
[22:04] but just pulling bits and pieces
[22:06] ephesians 3 verse 1 for this cause i
[22:09] paul the prisoner of jesus christ for
[22:11] you gentiles
[22:13] if you have heard of the dispensation of
[22:15] the grace of god which has given me to
[22:16] you word
[22:18] how that by revelation he made known
[22:19] unto me the mystery as i wrote a foreign
[22:21] few words whereby when you read you may
[22:23] understand my knowledge in the mystery
[22:26] of christ
[22:27] which in other ages was not made known
[22:29] unto the sons of men as it is now
[22:30] revealed unto his holy apostles and
[22:32] prophets by the spirit
[22:34] what the gentiles should be that the
[22:36] gentiles should be fellow heirs and of
[22:38] the same body and partakers of his
[22:40] promise in christ by the gospel
[22:43] wherefore i was made a minister
[22:44] according to the gift of grace of god
[22:46] given unto me by the effectual working
[22:48] of his power
[22:50] so paul's coming back to the same place
[22:52] he's saying now i've received a
[22:53] revelation paul didn't get anything by
[22:55] study
[22:57] and he realized paul had studied
[22:59] paul had studied probably more than
[23:01] we've ever studied coming up through the
[23:04] the ranks of the jewish religion coming
[23:06] up through the school of gamaliel he had
[23:08] studied but he didn't get the mystery of
[23:10] christ by study it was given to him by
[23:12] revelation as a gift and then it was
[23:15] given to him to us word
[23:18] it was given to him so that he could
[23:20] dispense it back to the gentiles because
[23:23] the mystery was that god would be known
[23:25] among the gentiles
[23:28] not because the gentiles were worthy but
[23:30] because god had ordained it before the
[23:32] foundation of the world
[23:34] and now he says
[23:36] therefore wherefore in verse 7 i was
[23:38] made a minister according to the gift of
[23:41] the grace of god given unto me by the
[23:43] effectual working of his power
[23:46] so the apostle paul is claiming nothing
[23:49] but he's stating the absolute truth but
[23:51] he's claiming nothing
[23:53] he didn't do it he didn't work his way
[23:55] up to it he didn't figure it out amen he
[23:57] was just there when god called
[24:00] he was the vessel god chose i mean this
[24:02] is the thing god hid before the
[24:04] foundation of the world god decided to
[24:06] reveal it so paul got it because god
[24:08] paul was the one who was chosen amen to
[24:11] be given a dispensation to go to the
[24:13] gentiles it was all god's doing it
[24:15] wasn't paul's
[24:16] doing he says verse 8 unto me whom less
[24:19] than the least of all saints is this
[24:21] grace given that i should preach among
[24:23] the gentiles the unsearchable riches of
[24:25] christ
[24:26] and to make all men see what is the
[24:28] fellowship of the mystery which from the
[24:30] beginning of the world had been hid in
[24:31] god who created all things by jesus
[24:34] christ
[24:35] to the intent that now
[24:39] to the intent that now the
[24:40] principalities and powers in heavenly
[24:42] places might be known by the church the
[24:44] manifold wisdom of god according to the
[24:47] eternal purpose which he purposed in
[24:49] christ jesus our lord in whom we have
[24:51] boldness and access with confidence by
[24:53] faith
[24:54] by the faith of him
[24:57] praise be to god
[25:00] paul's saying we didn't do it he did it
[25:02] it wasn't our figuring out it was his
[25:04] divine revelation and he's given it now
[25:06] to the gentiles not based off their
[25:08] merit but by his preordained plan
[25:11] so now we've spent the first half
[25:13] ephesians is in six chapters and we
[25:16] spent the first half of ephesians and in
[25:17] the first half of ephesians the apostle
[25:19] paul was laying out very strongly that
[25:22] all of this has been done by god's grace
[25:24] by god's will for god's purpose
[25:27] that we were lost amen we were children
[25:29] of disobedience we were we we were we
[25:32] were we were under the prince of the
[25:34] power of the air we were in darkness we
[25:36] all of these things he's telling us
[25:37] there was no merit of our own but by
[25:39] grace amen and then he's called us to
[25:41] works because we're his workmanship and
[25:43] paul is laying this out using himself as
[25:46] an example and explaining the condition
[25:48] to the church so that that by the time
[25:50] you get halfway through ephesians you're
[25:52] solidly convinced and sure that if you
[25:56] believe amen you believe because god
[25:58] amen before the foundation of the world
[26:01] gave you something to believe with
[26:03] that if you're a child of god it was
[26:05] chosen you were chosen in christ before
[26:07] the foundation of the world and it's
[26:08] god's purpose according to god's plan
[26:11] according to god's good pleasure by
[26:12] god's will and god's already done it
[26:17] now we're going to move into the second
[26:18] half of ephesians
[26:20] ephesians 4 verse
[26:22] 1. i therefore the prisoner of the lord
[26:25] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[26:28] vocation wherewith you are called
[26:31] now paul is making a turn
[26:34] and the first half he's talking about
[26:36] what god has done you couldn't do wasn't
[26:39] you it was him his will his pleasure
[26:42] right but now he's telling you now i'm
[26:44] going to tell you to walk worthy of the
[26:46] vocation
[26:48] wherewith you were called
[26:50] with all lowliness and meekness with
[26:52] long suffering for bearing one another
[26:54] in love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[26:57] the spirit in the bond of peace
[27:00] let's go down to verse 11.
[27:03] and he he gave some apostles and some
[27:05] prophets and some evangelists and some
[27:07] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[27:10] of the saints
[27:11] for the work of the ministry for the
[27:13] edifying of the body of christ
[27:15] so now
[27:17] he's telling us that there's an ongoing
[27:19] work
[27:20] and god has given these ministry gifts
[27:22] for the perfecting the saints for the
[27:23] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[27:25] the body of christ till we all come in
[27:27] the unity of the faith and of the
[27:28] knowledge of the son of god unto a
[27:30] perfect man unto the measure of the
[27:32] stature of the fullness of christ
[27:34] that we henceforth be no more children
[27:36] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[27:38] every wind of doctrine by the slight of
[27:40] men and the cunning craftiness whereby
[27:42] they lie and wait to deceive but
[27:44] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[27:46] into him in all things which is the head
[27:48] even christ
[27:49] from whom the whole body
[27:52] fitly joined together and compacted by
[27:54] that which every joint supplyeth
[27:56] according to the effectual working in
[27:58] the
[27:58] measure of every part making increase of
[28:01] the body unto the edifying of itself in
[28:03] love
[28:04] this i say therefore and testify in the
[28:06] lord that you henceforth walk not as
[28:08] other gentiles walk in the vanity of
[28:10] their mind having an understanding dark
[28:12] and being alienated from the life of god
[28:14] through the ignorance that is in them
[28:16] because of the blindness of their heart
[28:18] who being past feeling have given
[28:20] themselves over into lasciviousness to
[28:22] work all uncleanness with greediness but
[28:24] you have not so learned christ if so be
[28:27] that you have heard him and have been
[28:28] taught by him as the truth is in jesus
[28:31] that you put off concerning the former
[28:33] conversations the old man which is
[28:35] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[28:37] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[28:39] mind and that you put on the new man
[28:41] which after god is created in
[28:42] righteousness and true holiness
[28:44] wherefore pouring putting away lying
[28:46] speak every man truth with his neighbor
[28:48] for we are members of one of another
[28:51] be angry and sin not let not the sun go
[28:53] down upon your wrath neither give place
[28:56] to the devil
[28:57] let him that stole steel no more but
[28:59] rather let him labor working with his
[29:01] hands the thing which is good that he
[29:03] may have to give to him that needeth
[29:06] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[29:08] of your mouth but that which is good to
[29:10] the use of edifying that it may minister
[29:12] grace into the hearers
[29:14] and grieve not the holy spirit of god
[29:16] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[29:17] redemption let all bitterness and wrath
[29:20] and anger and clamor and evil speaking
[29:22] be put away from you with all malice
[29:24] and be kind one to another tenderhearted
[29:27] forgiving one another even as god for
[29:29] christ's sake hath forgiven you
[29:32] men do you see the turn
[29:35] the first half
[29:36] god did
[29:38] god chose god's merit god's grace god's
[29:43] love you were stuck in this condition
[29:45] you were in darkness you were under the
[29:47] prince of power air but while you were
[29:48] there his great love loved you and his
[29:50] mercy was extended because of
[29:52] grace you didn't do it you're his
[29:55] workmanship creating christ he's in the
[29:56] good work but she is the dream you
[29:58] should walk in them he's got it under
[30:00] control he's got a plan here in christ
[30:02] from before you were chosen before the
[30:04] foundation of the world
[30:06] but then after he establishes that
[30:09] after he establishes that principle then
[30:10] he comes down and he says don't do this
[30:13] don't do this don't do this do this do
[30:16] this do this don't do that do this don't
[30:18] do that
[30:20] did you read that or did i just make
[30:23] this out
[30:24] you see
[30:25] this is the age-old debate that goes you
[30:28] know you can't serve god by do's and
[30:30] don'ts you're serving by love and you're
[30:31] saved by grace not do's and don'ts and
[30:33] don't teach me the do's and don'ts but
[30:35] you realize that both go together
[30:39] ephesians is pulling them both together
[30:42] and ephesians is saying you were chosen
[30:44] before the foundation of the world with
[30:46] no merit of your own you were dead you
[30:48] were dead in trespassing sin and his
[30:50] mercy was extended to you by his grace
[30:52] it was what he did by his choosing by
[30:54] his good pleasure
[30:55] not by any deeds or works or merits of
[30:57] your own but now that you have come to
[31:00] the revelation of god choosing you you
[31:02] have come into christ amen you've been
[31:04] baptized in the holy ghost now do this
[31:07] do this do this don't do this don't do
[31:09] that do this
[31:13] let's go on
[31:15] ephesians chapter 5 verse 1.
[31:19] be therefore followers of god as dear
[31:22] children
[31:23] and walk in love as christ also have
[31:25] loved us and hath given himself for us
[31:27] an offering and sacrifice to god for a
[31:30] sweet smelling savor but fornication and
[31:33] all clean uncleanness or covetousness
[31:35] let it not be once named among you as
[31:37] become a saints neither filthiness nor
[31:39] foolish talking nor jesting which are
[31:41] not convenient but rather giving of
[31:43] thanks
[31:44] for this you know that no whoremonger
[31:46] nor unclean person nor covetous man who
[31:48] is an idolater has any inheritance in
[31:50] the kingdom of christ and of god
[31:53] let no man deceive you with vain words
[31:55] for because of these things cometh the
[31:57] wrath of god upon the children of
[31:59] disobedient
[32:01] be not ye therefore partakers with them
[32:05] for ye were sometimes darkness but now
[32:07] are you light and the lord walk as
[32:08] children of light for the fruit of the
[32:10] spirit is in all goodness and
[32:12] righteousness and truth proving what is
[32:14] acceptable unto the lord and have no
[32:16] fellowship with the unfruitful works of
[32:17] darkness but rather reprove them for it
[32:20] is a shame even to speak of those things
[32:22] which are done of them in secret
[32:24] but all things that are that are
[32:26] reproved or made manifest by the light
[32:29] for whatsoever doth make manifest is
[32:31] light
[32:33] wherefore he saith awake thou that
[32:35] sleepeth and arise from the dead in
[32:36] christ shall give thee light see then
[32:39] that you walk circumspectly not as fools
[32:41] but as wise redeeming the time because
[32:43] the days are evil
[32:45] wherefore be not unwise but
[32:47] understanding what the will of the lord
[32:49] is
[32:50] and be not drunk with wine wearing as
[32:52] excess but be filled with the spirit
[32:54] speaking to yourselves in psalms and
[32:56] hymns and spiritual songs singing and
[32:58] making melody in your hearts to the lord
[33:00] giving thanks always for all things unto
[33:02] god and the father in the name of our
[33:04] lord jesus christ submitting yourselves
[33:07] one to another in the fear of god wives
[33:09] submit yourselves into your unhusbands
[33:11] as unto the lord now down to verse 25
[33:14] and husbands love your wives even as
[33:16] christ also loved the church and gave
[33:18] himself for it
[33:20] so we see chapter four do do don't don't
[33:23] chapter five dude don't don't don't
[33:26] chapter six verse one
[33:29] children obey your parents in the lord
[33:31] for this is right
[33:33] honor thy father and mother which is the
[33:34] first commandment with promise that it
[33:36] may be well with thee and thou mayest
[33:38] live long on the earth and your fathers
[33:40] provoke not your children to wrath but
[33:42] bring them up in the nurture and
[33:43] admonition of the lord servants be
[33:45] obedient to them that are your masters
[33:47] according to the flesh with fear and
[33:48] trembling and singleness of heart as
[33:50] unto christ not with eye service as men
[33:53] pleasers but as the servants of christ
[33:55] doing the will of god from the heart
[33:58] with good will doing services to the
[34:00] lord and not to men knowing that
[34:02] whatsoever good thing any man doeth the
[34:05] same shall be received to the lord
[34:07] whether he be bond or free
[34:09] and you masters do the same thing unto
[34:10] them forbearing threatening knowing that
[34:13] your master also is in heaven neither is
[34:15] their respect to persons with him
[34:18] finally my brethren be strong in the
[34:20] lord in the power of his might
[34:22] put on the whole armor of god that you
[34:23] may be able to stand against the wiles
[34:25] of the devil
[34:26] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[34:28] blood but against principalities against
[34:30] powers against the rulers of the
[34:32] darkness of this world against spiritual
[34:34] wickedness in high places
[34:36] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[34:38] of god that you may be able to withstand
[34:40] in the evil day and having done all to
[34:42] stand stand therefore having your loins
[34:44] gird about the truth with truth and
[34:46] having on the breastplate of
[34:48] righteousness and your feet shod with
[34:50] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[34:52] above all taking the shield of faith
[34:54] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[34:55] all the fiery darts of the wicked and
[34:57] take the helmet of salvation and the
[34:59] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[35:01] god praying always with all prayer and
[35:03] supplication in the spirit and watching
[35:06] there unto with all perseverance and
[35:08] supplication for all saints
[35:12] so now
[35:14] i hope now by the time we get to done
[35:16] with this that you see the the the two
[35:18] divisions in the book of ephesians
[35:21] the first three chapters and the second
[35:23] half chapters four five and six
[35:26] and and not just if we could just look
[35:29] at the way it's constructed
[35:31] if the apostle paul had flipped those
[35:34] two sections
[35:36] and you got the last three chapters
[35:38] first
[35:39] we would be an awful discouraged person
[35:42] but the apostle paul lays down the
[35:45] fundamental truth that we are chosen in
[35:47] him before the foundation of the world
[35:49] that we are god's chosen we are chosen
[35:51] unto adoption amen we are predestinated
[35:53] amen because there's no way that you can
[35:56] come to the obedience of the second half
[35:58] without the revelation of the first half
[36:01] the revelation of the first half amen
[36:04] and the security that comes from the
[36:07] first half and the love that is
[36:09] expressed in the first half is what
[36:11] gives us the strength amen and the
[36:13] ability to obey in the second half
[36:17] but see we become awfully tired people
[36:19] when we try to attain to the grace of
[36:22] the first half by keeping the second
[36:24] half
[36:27] and we become reprobate if we hold to
[36:29] the first half with ignoring the second
[36:31] half
[36:34] so this is where brother bram says
[36:35] calvinism went off one way armenianism
[36:38] legalism went off another one extreme
[36:40] grace and predestination amen with
[36:43] extreme legalism they went two different
[36:45] ways but ephesians pulls them back
[36:47] together and says yes you were chosen
[36:50] yes god knew you before the foundation
[36:51] of world yes you can no more be lost in
[36:53] god can be lost
[36:55] you're a child of god names in the book
[36:57] chosen in christ he died for you when
[37:00] you had no merit to produce anything for
[37:02] yourself it's all his choosing by his
[37:04] will according to his pleasure
[37:06] he revealed the mystery not in that day
[37:08] but in this day because this is the day
[37:09] he wanted to let it out and he chose
[37:11] paul to dispensate that that truth amen
[37:14] nothing anybody had anything to do with
[37:16] amen it gets us so secure in our
[37:18] position of god and so confident in in
[37:21] the level that he himself has lifted us
[37:23] out of darkness into life and set us in
[37:26] heavenly places in christ jesus amen and
[37:28] he so lifts us into that position to
[37:31] free us from the bondage of darkness and
[37:33] carnal understanding so that now we
[37:35] become a free people to express god
[37:39] through the second half of the book of
[37:40] ephesians
[37:42] then now when he says
[37:45] don't do that
[37:47] amen now
[37:49] me withholding myself from the things he
[37:52] says to abstain from amen it is not my
[37:55] withholding myself is not going to
[37:58] produce for me salvation
[38:02] it's not going to produce for me amen an
[38:04] elected place with god that is secure no
[38:08] matter how many times i fail in the
[38:10] second half of ephesians will not change
[38:13] the first half
[38:18] me with the revelation of the first half
[38:20] and what god has done for me and who i
[38:22] really am and what he's really done for
[38:24] me amen it unlocks my heart amen in a
[38:27] way that says if he did that for me if
[38:29] that's who i really am if i'm so secure
[38:32] amen and it doesn't matter amen it
[38:34] doesn't matter how many times i've
[38:36] failed or how many times i will fail
[38:38] it's not going to change the first three
[38:40] chapters of ephesians they're set in
[38:42] stone
[38:44] and if i'm not secure and then god's
[38:46] that good to me amen now in my heart is
[38:50] a desire to be all that he wants me to
[38:52] be
[38:54] and that's why the revelation of this
[38:56] message is the true revelation of the
[38:59] heart and mind of god and the conduct of
[39:01] the children is not it's not spoiled
[39:04] children that now are rich kids
[39:08] but we can do no wrong and god keeps
[39:10] pouring blessings in con no we're on
[39:12] partnership with god and that
[39:14] partnership brings a responsibility and
[39:16] the partnership is based on free moral
[39:18] agency and he did something for us that
[39:21] are that
[39:22] is beyond our free moral agency
[39:27] because he knows of the fallen condition
[39:29] that man is going to fall into and then
[39:31] he knew what was going to happen that
[39:33] why he said that's really the reason he
[39:35] secured his election before he put man
[39:39] and woman on free moral agency in the
[39:41] garden of eden he had already secured
[39:43] their election
[39:46] because there's something stronger than
[39:48] free moral agency and the thing is
[39:50] stronger free moral agency is the will
[39:51] of god
[39:53] but when it comes to this life he puts
[39:55] himself in his expression in this world
[39:58] he puts himself amen in partnership with
[40:01] man and that partnership is based on
[40:03] free moral agency and now god in his
[40:06] expression upon this earth is linked to
[40:10] man through free moral agency
[40:14] and now god
[40:15] god
[40:16] wants us
[40:18] to completely and fully obey the last
[40:22] three chapters of ephesians
[40:25] do you believe that
[40:27] that's the desire of god god wants us to
[40:29] completely obey every dot every mark
[40:34] every line every verse in the last three
[40:36] chapters of ephesians don't do this
[40:38] don't do that don't have strife don't
[40:40] have contention amen don't don't even
[40:43] speak about those things that are done
[40:44] of them in secret
[40:46] all of the things that he said god wants
[40:48] us to keep it amen but but god will not
[40:51] force us to keep it because he's
[40:53] partnering himself with us by free moral
[40:55] agency he wants us to do it but he wants
[40:59] us to do it as an expression of our love
[41:01] for him for what he and his grace has
[41:04] done for us
[41:09] so you can't say it doesn't matter what
[41:11] i do it matters to god what you do
[41:14] it very much matters to god what you do
[41:16] he wouldn't have spent spent half the
[41:18] book of ephesians for something that
[41:20] doesn't matter
[41:22] for instance if we say if we use the old
[41:25] phrases you know god doesn't care what i
[41:26] do he's just looking at my heart he's
[41:28] not the do's and don'ts but it's by his
[41:29] grace i mean you're taking two
[41:32] principles amen in your mirror making it
[41:34] either this or that amen and it's not
[41:37] either this or that it's this first then
[41:40] that
[41:41] [Music]
[41:43] first you come to the realization of
[41:45] what he has done for you when you had no
[41:47] ability to do for yourself amen and when
[41:50] you see the goodness and mercy and grace
[41:52] of god and your secure position in him
[41:54] he has unlocked a faith inside of us
[41:57] that he put there
[41:58] and he sent a spirit to us his spirit
[42:00] unto us that would give us the power and
[42:02] ability to keep the second half of the
[42:04] book of ephesians
[42:06] and that that is our partnership with
[42:10] him
[42:14] his partnership do you believe you're in
[42:16] partnership with god
[42:17] like the prophet said
[42:20] his part of the partnership
[42:23] was to secure our salvation
[42:26] do you believe that
[42:29] because you had no ability to do it that
[42:31] was the part of the partnership you
[42:33] couldn't do
[42:38] so his part was to secure our salvation
[42:43] and to give us his word
[42:46] our part of the partnership is to keep
[42:49] his word
[42:52] by what by free moral agency
[42:56] you can do whatever you want
[42:58] and doing whatever you want will not
[43:00] change what's already been written in
[43:02] that book
[43:05] but you're not keeping your end of the
[43:07] partnership
[43:09] you're not giving back to god what he
[43:11] deserves
[43:13] i wanted to lay that
[43:15] as a foundation to go into where where
[43:17] i'd like to go next
[43:19] brother branham says in 1964 the
[43:22] identified christ of all ages
[43:24] he says and then usually man gets it so
[43:27] twisted up and the world gets it in such
[43:29] a shape until he has to send some man
[43:32] anointed
[43:33] all ages has been the same he identifies
[43:36] himself upon the earth and man
[43:39] god does nothing without man the bible
[43:41] said so you know he always takes man
[43:44] because it was man he had to use put him
[43:46] on free moral agency knowing that he
[43:48] would fall in order to display his
[43:50] attributes as savior for there was
[43:52] nothing lost and therefore he chose man
[43:55] he could have chose stars
[43:57] he could have chose trees but he chose
[43:58] man
[44:00] one time standing looking upon the
[44:01] harvest jesus he said the harvest is
[44:03] ripe the laborers are few praise the
[44:05] lord of the harvest to send laborers
[44:07] into the harvest
[44:08] and he was the lord of the harvest
[44:10] you have not because you ask not you ask
[44:13] not because you believe not ask
[44:14] abundance that your joys might be full
[44:17] see
[44:18] he's depending on you asking and
[44:20] believing that you receive what you ask
[44:22] for
[44:27] we have to catch how profound that is
[44:31] he's depending on you asking
[44:35] like god has a plan
[44:38] right in god's plan according to his
[44:40] promise to abraham he promised abraham
[44:42] that his seed was going to sow jordan in
[44:44] a strange land for 400 years but he'll
[44:46] bring him out with a mighty hand that's
[44:48] god's program that's god's plan amen but
[44:51] see so god has to keep his end of the
[44:54] bargain amen in at 400 years he has got
[44:56] to provide amen
[44:58] a deliverer to come on the scene and
[45:00] moses shows up on the scene and moses
[45:03] comes on the scene as the deliverer amen
[45:05] and when he begins to try to deliver
[45:07] them amen they reject moses ministry and
[45:10] moses runs out into the wilderness
[45:13] why free moral agency
[45:16] they didn't have to accept him and moses
[45:18] could run and we know all things worked
[45:20] together for good and all things worked
[45:22] to his plan but god showed up at the
[45:24] right time 400 years he showed up to
[45:27] keep his end of the deal but the people
[45:29] he came to rejected the ministry that
[45:31] came and we know it's because the
[45:32] ministry wasn't in the shape it needed
[45:34] to be yet
[45:36] but still they had to reject it so that
[45:38] moses would run away to the wilderness
[45:40] so that god could beat all of egypt out
[45:43] of moses and get moses ready to be the
[45:45] right kind of deliverer amen but then
[45:48] when god was timed now for god to come
[45:50] down and complete his word because god
[45:52] will keep his word
[45:55] he comes to moses and said i have heard
[45:58] the cry of my people
[46:02] i have heard the cry of my people
[46:05] and i have come down
[46:08] what brought him down what moved him
[46:10] into action what happened 40 years later
[46:12] the people who had rejected the ministry
[46:14] are now crying for deliverance and god
[46:17] needed them to cry
[46:20] so that he could put the wheels in
[46:22] motion to bring about his word
[46:25] because god is on partnership with man
[46:28] they read he sent the ministry they
[46:30] rejected the ministry now they have to
[46:32] cry to god to get it back
[46:38] and you know he says i've come down i've
[46:40] come to deliver them and now he looks at
[46:43] moses and says now i'm sending you you
[46:45] go
[46:48] because god always works through man
[46:51] and moses amen has to a free will go
[46:56] amen god's not forcing him to go amen
[46:58] but he's he's
[46:59] moses is trying to weasel his way out of
[47:02] it
[47:04] because god has finally got him to where
[47:05] he can use him in humility and
[47:07] brokenness amen and desperation with no
[47:09] confidence in himself and he finally got
[47:12] him exactly where he wanted him but he
[47:13] got him in such a state where moses was
[47:15] trying to talk god out of it no sin this
[47:17] one said that when they won't hear me
[47:18] and god says no it's you because god
[47:20] can't choose another it's got to be
[47:22] moses but moses has to do it of his own
[47:24] free choice
[47:31] let's read a couple more quotes
[47:34] 1963 go awake jesus
[47:36] god does nothing without human agency
[47:39] you know that he has to use someone
[47:45] but remember he can't force
[47:48] he can't violate free moral agency in
[47:51] this life on this earth he cannot
[47:52] violate three more ladies he cannot
[47:53] force but he has to use a man
[47:56] somebody's got to surrender somebody's
[47:58] got to be willing somebody's got to obey
[48:00] his voice
[48:03] 1959 my new ministry says now you say
[48:06] well if he knows it then why are you
[48:08] preaching
[48:10] if he knows who's going to be saved
[48:11] who's not why are you preaching
[48:14] he said that's part of god's program
[48:16] preaching is his program
[48:18] when he looked upon the apostle he
[48:20] looked upon the harvest said the harvest
[48:22] is ripe and the laborers are few pray
[48:23] the lord of the harvest that he will
[48:24] send laborers into the harvest how many
[48:26] remember that well why would they have
[48:29] to pray to the lord of the harvest to
[48:30] send laborers into the harvest if the
[48:32] lord of the harvest was standing there
[48:34] knowing it would be done
[48:37] why
[48:38] god has so arranged it that is
[48:40] now listen to this god has so arranged
[48:43] it that his program cannot move without
[48:45] you and i
[48:48] you got that this is partnership with
[48:50] god
[48:52] god is so erased that his program cannot
[48:55] move without you and i and as long as
[48:57] we're not doing what god leads us to do
[48:59] we are paralyzing his program
[49:05] my goodness when he when brother branham
[49:07] said partner he partnered with man he
[49:09] chose man amen that was a profound
[49:12] statement friends and then this
[49:14] statement is i mean it blow me away
[49:16] statement amen if god so arranged it
[49:19] that his program cannot move without you
[49:21] and i and as long as we're not doing
[49:24] what god leads us to do we are
[49:25] paralyzing his program
[49:27] but when the church moves by the
[49:29] anointing of the holy ghost then we are
[49:31] in god's will doing his program
[49:35] why because that's what god wants
[49:38] that's the partnership he's he
[49:41] ephesians one through three god kept his
[49:43] end of the deal
[49:46] ephesians four through six he's asking
[49:48] us to do ours
[49:52] galatians one let's turn there together
[49:54] galatians chapter one
[50:03] galatians 1 15.
[50:13] but when it pleased god who separated me
[50:15] from my mother's womb and called me by
[50:17] his grace
[50:18] to reveal his son
[50:19] in me
[50:22] we've been through this many times not
[50:23] to me
[50:24] but when he chose to reveal his son
[50:27] in me
[50:30] that i might preach him among the
[50:32] heathen immediately i conferred not with
[50:34] flesh and blood neither went i up to
[50:35] jerusalem to them which were apostles
[50:37] before me but i went to arabia and
[50:39] returned again to damascus now now
[50:41] realize when god needed somebody to
[50:44] preach the unsearchable riches of christ
[50:46] and to the gentiles he didn't send out
[50:48] for resumes
[50:51] he already in his mind had that worked
[50:54] out
[50:56] amen and that's what paul is saying god
[50:58] who separated me from my mother's whom
[51:00] god you know god was attentive
[51:04] to paul's birth
[51:08] god knew when he would be born
[51:12] he knew who his mom and dad would be he
[51:14] knew what characteristics would be
[51:15] laying in there he was attentive unto
[51:17] his birth amen because he was a chosen
[51:20] vessel unto the lord that's what he said
[51:23] when he when he went to ananias when he
[51:25] told ananias to go speak to saul he says
[51:28] i'm going to tell him that he's a chosen
[51:30] vessel
[51:32] unto me
[51:34] so paul says when he separated from my
[51:36] mother's womb and called me by his grace
[51:38] to reveal his son and me so there was a
[51:40] purpose amen from before the time he
[51:42] separated from his mother's womb he was
[51:44] going to call him amen because he wanted
[51:46] to reveal his son in him
[51:49] but the apostle paul had to surrender
[51:53] he had to surrender and he had to obey
[51:56] so that that work could be accomplished
[51:59] let's turn to acts chapter 13.
[52:08] acts chapter 13
[52:10] verse 46
[52:12] when paul and barnabas wax bold and said
[52:14] it was necessary that the word of god
[52:16] should first have been spoken to you but
[52:19] seeing you put it from you and judge
[52:20] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
[52:22] lo we turn to the gentiles for so hat
[52:25] the lord commanded us saying i have set
[52:27] thee to be a light of the gentiles that
[52:29] thou should be for salvation into the
[52:31] ends of the earth
[52:32] so now there is an old testament
[52:35] prophecy laying in isaiah and now he's
[52:37] speaking this prophecy and paul is
[52:39] saying that prophecy all the way back
[52:41] there was about me
[52:44] right so paul is a chosen vessel
[52:47] paul is chosen to be the fulfillment of
[52:50] the light to the gentiles from mosaic
[52:52] isaiah i believe isaiah 49 or something
[52:54] like that
[52:56] and so he's predestinated he's ordained
[52:59] he's chosen he's called by a pillar of
[53:02] fire he's separated from his mother's
[53:04] room he's called by his grace he knows
[53:05] his position and he knows his purpose
[53:08] and it's important that we know this
[53:09] about paul because of a scripture we're
[53:10] going to get to in a minute so hold on
[53:12] to that and we're going to get to
[53:13] something here in a few minutes
[53:16] he says now
[53:17] he says
[53:20] in the christ is the mystery of god
[53:21] revealed
[53:27] he says now
[53:28] we come back here and to visit the
[53:30] climate in this place i certainly don't
[53:32] like it because it just breaks me down
[53:35] brother ben's talking here it just
[53:37] breaks me down as soon as i get here
[53:39] and i can cross the tops of the knobs up
[53:41] there and can come down in the valley
[53:43] and i'm here about 10 minutes and i got
[53:45] hives get sick weather swimmy headed
[53:48] everything looks spooky dark i just have
[53:50] to get out of it see and the other day i
[53:52] was talking to the wife but what brings
[53:54] me here first what brings me here is
[53:55] your people see
[53:57] this church
[53:59] i tell you of all the places i've ever
[54:00] went in my life this is my favorite
[54:01] place to preach the gospel
[54:03] it looks like that we can make a tape
[54:05] from here that's ten times better than
[54:07] anywhere else and see that's the reason
[54:09] i say where god is doing something stay
[54:10] right with that but think where the
[54:12] great thing is that was the great thing
[54:15] is that was me failing to go out the
[54:17] first time when he called me
[54:20] and therefore he makes it kind of rough
[54:22] on me when i come in obedience is better
[54:25] than sacrifice
[54:27] now looking at
[54:30] looking at the prophet's life
[54:32] now brother branham was chosen before
[54:33] the foundation of the world ordained to
[54:35] be a prophet god separated him from his
[54:37] mother's womb god called him by his
[54:39] grace god knew he would be here god knew
[54:41] the work he would have him to do it was
[54:42] preordained
[54:46] but yet in all the that was preordained
[54:50] and what god wanted to do when brother
[54:52] branham was called to go out to the
[54:53] pentecostal first time he listened to
[54:56] his mother-in-law and he refused
[54:59] and in his refusing comes a punishment
[55:04] he loses his wife and he loses his
[55:06] daughter
[55:08] and years later years and years and
[55:10] years later he's still suffering and
[55:14] whenever he comes back into
[55:15] jeffersonville amen all of a sudden he
[55:17] gets is swimmy-headed he gets feeling
[55:20] sick amen and he says because i didn't
[55:22] go out when he called it he makes it
[55:24] kind of rough on me
[55:26] remember it doesn't matter how much
[55:28] you're called
[55:30] it doesn't matter what your position is
[55:32] in the body if you disobey the lord
[55:36] you've got a punishment coming
[55:39] it doesn't matter how secure your
[55:41] eternity is
[55:43] it doesn't matter that you're bride of
[55:45] jesus christ amen you're bride of jesus
[55:48] christ that's not going to change
[55:49] brother bennett's position didn't change
[55:50] his eternal destination didn't change
[55:52] amen nothing changed in the first half
[55:55] of ephesians for him but because when he
[55:56] refused to obey the lord god would take
[55:59] a rod of chastisement and strike it upon
[56:02] the back of that son because he needed a
[56:04] son that would obey
[56:06] and we know all things work together all
[56:09] things he makes even brother memphis
[56:11] said he makes even our mistakes work
[56:12] together for his glory and even this
[56:14] mistake of the prophet amen it worked
[56:16] together for god's glory it's part of
[56:18] the program but don't don't be mistaken
[56:21] we cannot because we're we're told all
[56:24] the things we're told in ephesians one
[56:26] through three think that we can ignore
[56:28] ephesians four through 6 and everything
[56:30] god's just going to turn a blind eye to
[56:32] it and nothing's going to happen no we
[56:34] are going to suffer for disobedience
[56:36] because we are his children and we are
[56:38] our own free moral agency and we are in
[56:41] partnership with god and because god can
[56:43] do nothing without us god is going to
[56:46] allow the rod to come down hard because
[56:48] he cannot have us going that way
[56:52] he has got to correct it because he's
[56:54] got to have us in obedience to fulfill
[56:57] his plan
[57:00] so so there's no there's none of this
[57:03] elitism
[57:06] special privileges special position
[57:09] now i'll say it this way it doesn't
[57:12] matter if you get whacked on the tail
[57:14] for your disobedience every day
[57:16] you're still not changing the election
[57:21] right you're still not changing election
[57:24] it doesn't matter how how big the
[57:26] failures is how many times you fall
[57:28] we're not changing the first half of
[57:30] ephesians
[57:31] that's our security that's eternal
[57:33] security
[57:35] but eternal security can never bring an
[57:37] attitude of complacency
[57:40] disobedience or rebellion but the true
[57:43] revelation of eternal security brings a
[57:45] loving heart back to god that obeys him
[57:48] out of love
[57:49] and free moral agency
[57:51] we'll fail we'll make mistakes and he'll
[57:53] make those mistakes work back into his
[57:55] glory but but praise god amen the the
[57:58] revelation should free us to be his
[58:00] children and recognize we're his
[58:01] children and love him back and obey and
[58:04] whenever we don't rest assured you have
[58:06] a heavenly father amen who will not let
[58:09] his program get paralyzed too long
[58:16] brother banham said
[58:19] because
[58:20] moses had the problems he had
[58:24] god gave him a hot-tempered wife
[58:29] to help mold his character
[58:32] to bring correction to him
[58:34] why because god had to have moses
[58:38] and god's got to have you and i
[58:41] he's got to have us and we've got to get
[58:43] in step with his program by free moral
[58:46] agency he's not going to force if he
[58:48] didn't force us to fall he's not going
[58:49] to force us into righteousness he wants
[58:51] us to make that choice but as a good
[58:53] father amen he'll allow us to make wrong
[58:56] choices and suffer the consequences of
[58:58] the wrong choices amen so that we begin
[59:00] to learn
[59:03] we begin to learn that obedience is
[59:05] better than sacrifice
[59:08] see
[59:09] when we live on this life
[59:12] when we live this life we're living out
[59:13] this life
[59:15] it's almost like we're stuck between two
[59:17] worlds
[59:19] almost like we're stuck between two
[59:20] positions in two worlds i mean it's not
[59:23] really that way but in our thinking
[59:24] sometimes we can think that way because
[59:26] in one way i'm i i am a king and priest
[59:30] to god we're a spiritual kingdom i my
[59:32] position is secure i'm seated in
[59:34] heavenly places in christ jesus amen i
[59:37] am secure i have an inheritance
[59:40] in heaven i i'm part of the royal family
[59:47] and here
[59:48] i'm suffering
[59:51] in the flesh i'm suffering and i'm and
[59:54] i'm troubled on every side and i'm
[59:56] afflicted in many ways and things are
[59:59] not working out right and it it in this
[1:00:02] life amen it doesn't look like i'm a
[1:00:05] king and a priest
[1:00:09] oh but that's god's program
[1:00:13] god's program
[1:00:15] is to get us to act like the slave that
[1:00:17] brother benham talked about when he
[1:00:19] talked about the slave buyer comes by
[1:00:21] and he notices a slave that's different
[1:00:23] than all the other slaves
[1:00:26] they're all working in the field they're
[1:00:29] all toiling the same kind of labor
[1:00:31] they're all afflicted in the same kind
[1:00:32] of afflictions but there's one that
[1:00:34] stands out in the crowd
[1:00:36] because he doesn't he doesn't work he
[1:00:39] doesn't mope he doesn't pout he's not
[1:00:41] dragging his feet but he's really
[1:00:43] laboring he's holding his chest up he's
[1:00:45] walking proud and he's diligent about
[1:00:47] his work amen and you don't have to
[1:00:49] don't have to whip him to make him work
[1:00:51] that's what brother branham's saying
[1:00:54] and in the the slave buyers want to know
[1:00:56] why he wants to buy him and he says he's
[1:00:58] not for sale and he says well you know
[1:01:01] this what special treatment does this
[1:01:03] slave get that makes him act the way he
[1:01:05] acts
[1:01:07] nothing
[1:01:08] he just gets eats in the galley with the
[1:01:10] rest and sleeps in the bunk house with
[1:01:12] the rest of him he works all the same
[1:01:13] jobs he's not a boss there's nothing
[1:01:15] different between him and anybody else
[1:01:18] in this bondage
[1:01:19] and there's nothing different between
[1:01:21] you and i'm talking in the flesh i'm
[1:01:23] talking purely carnal there's nothing
[1:01:24] different between you and anybody else
[1:01:26] in this bondage
[1:01:30] he says well what makes him that way
[1:01:33] and the owner says i i wondered myself
[1:01:36] but i found out that over in a foreign
[1:01:38] land his father is the king of the tribe
[1:01:41] and though he's away from home and in
[1:01:42] bondage he conducts himself as the son
[1:01:45] of a king
[1:01:49] that's what he's looking for
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:53] you can't we're just in as much of a
[1:01:56] mess
[1:01:57] as every other human beings in a mess
[1:02:00] just as much
[1:02:02] afflicted by heat and storm and hail i
[1:02:06] mean what special protection do you have
[1:02:08] against the heat wave
[1:02:11] right
[1:02:12] we get afflicted with the same things
[1:02:14] the world gets afflicted why but we
[1:02:15] should act different and respond to it
[1:02:17] different than anybody else in the world
[1:02:19] responds to it
[1:02:22] our conduct should be different
[1:02:26] because he's on partnership with us
[1:02:29] let's turn quickly to joshua
[1:02:32] i want to pick up a little bit out of
[1:02:34] joshua
[1:02:37] chapter 1.
[1:02:39] brother branham says
[1:02:43] that joshua is the ephesians of the old
[1:02:45] testament
[1:02:47] he says some interesting things i'm not
[1:02:48] going to get into much of that i'm just
[1:02:50] going to touch into it we may get into
[1:02:51] more later
[1:02:53] but he says
[1:02:54] joshua's ephesians the placing of the
[1:02:56] church and joshua parallels ephesians he
[1:02:59] preached a message like that one time
[1:03:01] and like i said we won't get into much
[1:03:02] depth in that but i want to touch on him
[1:03:05] and joshua we know joshua is the one
[1:03:08] that god has chosen to lead them into
[1:03:10] the promised land moses died on outside
[1:03:13] across the river and now joshua's going
[1:03:15] to lead them over to possess the land
[1:03:17] and joshua chapter 1 verse 1
[1:03:20] now after the death of moses the servant
[1:03:22] of the lord it came to pass that the
[1:03:24] lord spoke unto joshua the son of nun
[1:03:26] moses minister saying moses my servant
[1:03:29] is dead
[1:03:30] now therefore arise go over this jordan
[1:03:32] thou and all this people unto the land
[1:03:34] which i do give them
[1:03:36] even to the children of israel
[1:03:38] every place that the sole of your foot
[1:03:40] shall tread upon that have i given unto
[1:03:42] you as i said unto moses
[1:03:46] pay close attention to what he says in
[1:03:48] verse 3
[1:03:50] every place that the soul of your foot
[1:03:52] shall tread upon
[1:03:54] that have i given unto you
[1:03:56] as i said unto moses
[1:03:59] now god told moses
[1:04:01] that he had given all the land
[1:04:04] from this border to this border and from
[1:04:06] this border to this border it's all
[1:04:08] yours
[1:04:09] i'm giving it to you
[1:04:11] but now he makes a stipulation
[1:04:16] all the land that you put your foot on
[1:04:21] i've given to you
[1:04:24] now god is going to be in partnership
[1:04:26] with man
[1:04:29] god said i give the land to you it's a
[1:04:32] good land that flows with milk and honey
[1:04:34] i will drive out the inhabitants i will
[1:04:36] give this land to you but then when it
[1:04:38] comes time to cross over he puts himself
[1:04:41] in partnership with the children of
[1:04:42] israel and he says wherever you put your
[1:04:46] human foot i'll give you that space
[1:04:51] which means
[1:04:52] if you come against an army
[1:04:56] with chariots and horses lined on the
[1:04:59] hills
[1:05:01] god has promised you that land that's
[1:05:04] your land it's got your name on it he's
[1:05:06] given it to you but he's in partnership
[1:05:08] with you for you to get possession of
[1:05:11] that land you've got to put your foot on
[1:05:13] that land which means you've got to
[1:05:15] fight that enemy
[1:05:17] this is partnership with god amen amen
[1:05:20] this is free moral agency they can turn
[1:05:23] and run they can hide they can sign a
[1:05:26] peace treaty amen but if they're going
[1:05:28] to get full possession of the land
[1:05:30] they've got to put their foot on that
[1:05:32] place where that philistine is they got
[1:05:34] to put their foot on that place where
[1:05:35] that hit tight is
[1:05:37] which means there's going to be a battle
[1:05:39] which means there's going to be a fight
[1:05:40] which means they're going to labor which
[1:05:42] means they're going to work that means
[1:05:43] they're going to give forth effort that
[1:05:44] means they're going to they're going to
[1:05:46] risk their lives amen they're going to
[1:05:48] they're going to give everything
[1:05:51] and this is the way it is with the word
[1:05:52] of god the promises are ours brothers
[1:05:54] and sisters amen they're ours for the
[1:05:56] taking
[1:05:58] but they're not ours delay in a lazy boy
[1:06:00] and sit back and say well if god ever
[1:06:02] wants me to have it he'll give it to me
[1:06:04] he says you resist the devil and he'll
[1:06:05] flee
[1:06:07] god didn't say if i resist the devil he
[1:06:09] already resisted the devil when he was
[1:06:10] in jesus christ now it's our turn to
[1:06:12] resist the devil
[1:06:15] he's in partnership with us he wants to
[1:06:17] keep his word he wants to keep his
[1:06:19] promises he wants to show up and show
[1:06:20] himself mighty on your behalf but
[1:06:22] there's a place that you've got to be
[1:06:24] willing to extend yourself and get your
[1:06:26] foot out there and put yourself in
[1:06:28] danger and put yourself in exposure amen
[1:06:30] and put yourself by the word by
[1:06:32] obedience and faith in the word there's
[1:06:34] we have to move out to the challenge of
[1:06:36] the day
[1:06:38] and if we'll move out into the challenge
[1:06:40] of the day we've got all the promises of
[1:06:42] abraham that will heap on us amen but
[1:06:44] not sitting back in the house not
[1:06:47] staying in safety
[1:06:50] why because he's on partnership with us
[1:06:53] you move he'll move
[1:06:56] he's already moved
[1:06:57] it's already in his word he's already
[1:06:59] given the promise listen ephesians
[1:07:01] parallels joshua
[1:07:04] they're coming in to get their placing
[1:07:06] they're coming in to get full possession
[1:07:08] of all that their inheritance has
[1:07:10] promised with us and the church is
[1:07:11] moving in the full possession of our
[1:07:13] inheritance
[1:07:15] but in order to move into full
[1:07:16] possession there's battles to be fought
[1:07:18] there's victories to be won those
[1:07:20] mountains to be climbed there's rivers
[1:07:21] to be crossed
[1:07:25] we're no different friends
[1:07:27] there's battles to be fought there's
[1:07:29] mountains to climb amen there's valleys
[1:07:32] of the shadow of the darkness to go
[1:07:33] through amen but if we'll go he'll
[1:07:36] promise he'll make a way if we'll step
[1:07:38] out in faith and resist the devil the
[1:07:40] devil will flee we have the promises we
[1:07:43] just have to be in action
[1:07:46] we have to have the faith to move
[1:07:49] let's go to joshua 13. i want to read
[1:07:52] several scriptures here because this is
[1:07:53] very interesting to me
[1:07:56] joshua 13.
[1:08:04] he makes this statement he says
[1:08:06] verse 6 joshua 13-6
[1:08:08] all the inhabitants of the hill country
[1:08:10] of lebanon unto mistress
[1:08:12] maim
[1:08:13] and all the sidonians and them will i
[1:08:15] drive out before the children of israel
[1:08:17] only divide thou by lot into the
[1:08:19] israelites for an inheritance as i have
[1:08:22] commanded thee
[1:08:23] jesus said i'll drive them out he told
[1:08:25] moses i'll drive them out he told moses
[1:08:27] i've given you the land
[1:08:29] but let's go back and look at
[1:08:30] deuteronomy
[1:08:34] 7.
[1:08:36] i'm going to read two more scriptures
[1:08:37] while we're right here
[1:08:39] deuteronomy 7
[1:08:43] and let's look at verse 20.
[1:08:49] moreover the lord thy god will send the
[1:08:51] hornets among them until they are that
[1:08:53] until they that are left and hide
[1:08:55] themselves from thee be destroyed
[1:08:59] thou shall not be frightened at them for
[1:09:01] the lord thy god is among you a mighty
[1:09:03] god and
[1:09:04] terrible and the lord thy god will put
[1:09:07] out those nations before thee by little
[1:09:09] and little thou mayest not consume them
[1:09:11] at once lest the beasts of the field
[1:09:13] increase upon thee but the lord thy god
[1:09:15] shall deliver them unto thee and shall
[1:09:17] destroy them with a mighty destruction
[1:09:19] until they be destroyed
[1:09:22] you got that
[1:09:24] every israelite needs to hold on to that
[1:09:27] here's the promise i'll send the hornet
[1:09:30] to drive out even the ones that hide
[1:09:31] from you
[1:09:32] i'll drive them out but he says i'll
[1:09:34] drive them out little by little so that
[1:09:36] the land is not overwhelmed by the beast
[1:09:40] then he says and the lord said verse 23
[1:09:42] i'll deliver them unto thee and shall
[1:09:44] destroy them with a mighty destruction
[1:09:46] until they be destroyed
[1:09:50] that's the promise
[1:09:52] now let's go to numbers
[1:09:56] numbers 33.
[1:10:01] just a few pages to the left
[1:10:05] numbers 33
[1:10:11] and verse 51
[1:10:14] 33-51
[1:10:17] speaking to the children of israel and
[1:10:18] saying to them when you are passed over
[1:10:20] jordan to the land of canaan then ye
[1:10:23] shall drive out all the inhabitants
[1:10:27] i'm confused
[1:10:29] god said he would drive them out
[1:10:31] now he's telling them to drive them out
[1:10:34] so how is god going to drive them out
[1:10:37] he's going to use the israelites
[1:10:40] yeah you know
[1:10:41] we get such carnal understanding
[1:10:43] sometimes the scripture i'll drive them
[1:10:45] out i'll move them away i'll drive them
[1:10:48] out and give you the land now you go
[1:10:50] i've come down most deliver the people
[1:10:51] now you go
[1:10:56] i i'm gonna drive out the inhabitants of
[1:10:59] the land now you drive out the
[1:11:00] inhabitants of the land what was it when
[1:11:02] israel was marching that was god
[1:11:04] marching amen when israel was fighting
[1:11:06] god was fighting for them amen this was
[1:11:09] god moving the inhabitants out of the
[1:11:11] land because they would take his word
[1:11:13] and obey his word because god is in
[1:11:15] partnership with man
[1:11:17] and until they kept until they were
[1:11:19] willing to march forward god was god was
[1:11:23] handicapped god's program was paralyzed
[1:11:28] see brother brandon's not just making
[1:11:30] stuff up when he makes statements like
[1:11:31] that he's taking it right out of the
[1:11:33] scripture amen when they refuse to go
[1:11:35] god's system god's program is paralyzed
[1:11:39] because i'll drive the mount i'll move
[1:11:41] the mount i'll move the mount he says
[1:11:43] you drive the mount because i've given
[1:11:44] you the land for a possession now
[1:11:46] wherever your foot lands that's your
[1:11:48] possession i'll give it to you
[1:11:50] god in partnership with man
[1:11:53] nothing has changed today friends
[1:11:59] let's keep reading
[1:12:05] verse 52 again then you shall drive out
[1:12:06] all the inhabitants of the land from
[1:12:08] before you and destroy all their
[1:12:09] pictures and destroy all their molten
[1:12:11] images and
[1:12:12] quite
[1:12:13] pluck down all their high places
[1:12:16] and you shall dispossess the inhabitants
[1:12:18] of the land and dwell therein for i have
[1:12:20] given you the land to possess it
[1:12:22] and you shall divide the land by lot for
[1:12:24] an inheritance among your families and
[1:12:26] to the to the more you shall give them
[1:12:28] more inheritance and to the fewer you
[1:12:29] shall give the less inheritance every
[1:12:31] man's inheritance shall be in the in the
[1:12:33] place whereas lot falleth according to
[1:12:35] the tribes of your fathers you shall
[1:12:37] inherit
[1:12:38] but if you will not drive out the
[1:12:40] inhabitants of the land from before you
[1:12:42] then it shall come to pass that those
[1:12:44] which you let remain of them shall be
[1:12:46] pricks in your eyes and thorns in your
[1:12:48] sights and shall vex you in the land
[1:12:50] wherein you dwell
[1:12:55] god you said
[1:12:57] that all i have to do is believe in you
[1:12:59] and you'll do it all
[1:13:03] you told moses and moses said
[1:13:06] he's going to give us the land
[1:13:08] you're going to you said god you're
[1:13:10] going to drive them out
[1:13:15] now
[1:13:16] god says you drive the mount
[1:13:19] and there's no contradiction in the plan
[1:13:22] of god
[1:13:24] because this is god's chosen nation
[1:13:26] god's chosen people and he promised to
[1:13:28] be with them and when they would march
[1:13:30] forward he was there when they took a
[1:13:32] step he was there
[1:13:35] but god was in partnership with the
[1:13:37] nation of israel
[1:13:39] and we know what happened we know they
[1:13:42] began while joshua was the general they
[1:13:44] began to conquer and conquer and conquer
[1:13:46] and conquer until they utterly destroyed
[1:13:49] nation after nation after nation and he
[1:13:51] began to divide the land and as he
[1:13:53] divided the land there was still
[1:13:55] inhabitants in parts of the land and and
[1:13:57] the the each tribe was supposed to drive
[1:13:59] out the people from their own land
[1:14:02] but we found out when you go to read
[1:14:05] this tribe couldn't drive out this one
[1:14:07] and this drive couldn't fully possess
[1:14:09] the land here and what did they do they
[1:14:12] they they got tired of the fight
[1:14:16] and when they got tired of the fight
[1:14:18] they made a deal
[1:14:21] with the canaanites and the hittites and
[1:14:23] the jebusites and they put them under
[1:14:25] tribute
[1:14:28] and they made a deal
[1:14:29] why because they got tired of the fight
[1:14:31] because it says they could take the
[1:14:34] lowlands but they couldn't take the
[1:14:35] highlands or they could take the high
[1:14:36] and could take the law i don't remember
[1:14:38] but they couldn't take this nation
[1:14:40] because they had iron chariots and they
[1:14:41] couldn't take this one for another
[1:14:43] reason reasoning reasoning reasoning
[1:14:46] reasoning
[1:14:49] and they forgot
[1:14:51] that god said i will drive them out
[1:14:54] little by little
[1:14:56] he didn't promise amen i'll walk in one
[1:14:59] month and the next are running out the
[1:15:01] back door and you just go and settle
[1:15:03] down in the land he said i'll give it to
[1:15:05] you i'll drive them out i'll send the
[1:15:07] hornet i'll give you the
[1:15:09] then he says you go and you possess it
[1:15:12] and wherever your feet is i'll give it
[1:15:14] to you you drive out the inhabitants of
[1:15:16] the land amen and if you don't drive
[1:15:18] them out they'll become pricks in your
[1:15:20] size and thorns in your flesh
[1:15:24] and they forgot they heard the promised
[1:15:27] word but they forgot the stipulation
[1:15:29] that you have to put your foot there and
[1:15:31] it'll drive them out little by little
[1:15:35] and if god promises all the promises of
[1:15:37] abraham why am i still suffering with
[1:15:39] the complex why am i still suffering
[1:15:42] with an old thing from my past that's
[1:15:43] hanging on why am i still he's promised
[1:15:46] to deliver you friends amen but don't
[1:15:49] make a deal with a with an iron chariot
[1:15:53] don't make a deal because the jebusites
[1:15:56] have a strong hold on high
[1:15:58] that strong on high became jerusalem
[1:16:01] that was jerusalem became the city of
[1:16:03] david
[1:16:04] amen god had a tremendous plan for the
[1:16:06] jebusite stronghold but they could never
[1:16:08] take this jebusite stronghold until
[1:16:10] david come on the scene
[1:16:13] and they thought it's too much amen it
[1:16:15] was a hard battle because god had some
[1:16:17] glory for that place
[1:16:20] and the most glorious places are
[1:16:22] sometimes the places we fight for the
[1:16:24] most
[1:16:28] see if you if they heard everything that
[1:16:31] was said i'll drive them out little by
[1:16:34] little
[1:16:35] then if they didn't get them out this
[1:16:37] battle they'll try it next battle
[1:16:40] because it's got to go
[1:16:42] there's see me realize god make no
[1:16:45] provision for not driving them out amen
[1:16:48] if they weren't droven out it wasn't
[1:16:50] god's fault because god would keep his
[1:16:52] end of the deal in the partnership amen
[1:16:54] but the free moral agency part on theirs
[1:16:57] amen was that was the was the cause
[1:17:00] of
[1:17:00] partial success
[1:17:04] and i wonder today
[1:17:06] what is the cause of partial success
[1:17:10] is it god
[1:17:12] or is it us
[1:17:15] it may be
[1:17:17] that you know god saw in his wisdom that
[1:17:19] when we came to the lord he wouldn't
[1:17:21] remove every obstacle in our life
[1:17:24] because we couldn't fully possess all
[1:17:26] that land all at once
[1:17:29] but god in our life is taking out
[1:17:32] complexes
[1:17:33] and habits and desires
[1:17:36] little
[1:17:36] by little
[1:17:38] is that true in your life
[1:17:42] one of the most discouraging things for
[1:17:43] us when we give our heart to the lord we
[1:17:45] see god do such a miraculous work in our
[1:17:47] life everything changes and then few
[1:17:49] months or a year down the road amen we
[1:17:51] find ourselves struggling with something
[1:17:53] we didn't think we ever struggle with
[1:17:54] again
[1:17:56] we thought god was going to just drive
[1:17:58] out there and say god was going to take
[1:18:00] care of all of it amen but he didn't
[1:18:02] realize amen god said where you put your
[1:18:04] foot you've got to go into that complex
[1:18:07] you've got to go into that habit and
[1:18:09] you've got to face it head-on and move
[1:18:11] into that so that god can move the enemy
[1:18:14] out
[1:18:15] we don't put it under tribute we don't
[1:18:17] ignore it acting like it's not living
[1:18:18] there
[1:18:22] but we keep facing it
[1:18:24] and keep pressing the battle
[1:18:26] and keep pressing the battle because
[1:18:28] he's promised to drive it out little by
[1:18:30] little
[1:18:34] if we don't drive it out
[1:18:36] that old thing that come from our
[1:18:38] childhood and that complex and that old
[1:18:40] habit
[1:18:41] if we don't drive it out
[1:18:43] it'll become a prick in our eyes and a
[1:18:45] thorn in our flesh
[1:18:48] and most of us have lived long enough to
[1:18:49] serve the lord to realize that's nothing
[1:18:51] but the truth
[1:18:55] don't put it under tribute
[1:18:57] keep pressing the battle
[1:18:59] keep taping the sword of the word and
[1:19:00] keep pressing that sword of the word
[1:19:02] amen and god will move it out of there
[1:19:04] we can't make a deal with it we can't we
[1:19:07] can't act like it's not there we've got
[1:19:09] to deal with these things in our lives
[1:19:10] because god is on partnership with us if
[1:19:12] you put it under tribute god won't move
[1:19:14] it
[1:19:16] if you let it stay and don't fight it it
[1:19:18] won't go
[1:19:23] but we gotta fight it friends
[1:19:25] and fight it
[1:19:27] and fight it and fight it how long fight
[1:19:30] it until it's gone
[1:19:32] not gone today fight it tomorrow if it's
[1:19:34] not gone tomorrow fight it the next day
[1:19:36] if that old complex is still tripping up
[1:19:38] a week for now fight it again
[1:19:41] press the battle amen if you can get
[1:19:43] your foot there you can have it
[1:19:45] if you reason if you resist the devil
[1:19:47] the devil will flee god's already done
[1:19:49] it now he's telling us to do it we're in
[1:19:50] partnership with god
[1:19:52] god does nothing without man
[1:19:55] brother branham said in possessing the
[1:19:56] gates of the enemy after the trial from
[1:19:57] 1964 but what did joshua do he stilled
[1:20:00] the people
[1:20:02] he said wait a minute we are more than
[1:20:03] able to take it no matter how little we
[1:20:05] are how much in the minority what was he
[1:20:07] doing he was standing true to that
[1:20:09] promise i give you this land but you
[1:20:11] fight every inch of it
[1:20:13] do you believe that mother god has given
[1:20:15] you your healing but you'll fight every
[1:20:17] inch of it everywhere the soles of your
[1:20:19] feet sets that i give you for possession
[1:20:21] footprints means possession it's all
[1:20:23] yours every promise belongs to you but
[1:20:25] you'll fight every inch of the way in
[1:20:28] now
[1:20:30] in adoption brother brahman says
[1:20:33] in his promised land everything belongs
[1:20:35] to us in the promised land see brother
[1:20:37] collins see everything in the promised
[1:20:39] land when israel crossed over jordan
[1:20:40] into the promised land fought down
[1:20:42] everything now remember in this promised
[1:20:44] land that don't mean that you're immune
[1:20:46] from sickness that don't mean that
[1:20:47] you're immune from troubles but it does
[1:20:50] spell this oh let this sink deep it says
[1:20:53] this that it's yours just rise up and
[1:20:55] take it see
[1:20:57] we've crossed over amen we've crossed
[1:20:59] over into the promised land we've
[1:21:01] crossed over into the word we've crossed
[1:21:03] over into the fullness of the holy ghost
[1:21:04] but that doesn't mean you're immune from
[1:21:06] sickness and immune from troubles what
[1:21:07] it means is all the promises are yours
[1:21:12] and remember the only way that israel
[1:21:14] ever lost a man is when sin got in the
[1:21:17] camp
[1:21:18] that's the only way we could ever lose a
[1:21:19] victory is for sin to get in the camp
[1:21:21] something wrong somewhere when aiken
[1:21:23] stole that wedge and that babylonian
[1:21:25] garment sin was in the can and the
[1:21:27] battle went wrong
[1:21:29] in adoption part two he says joshua said
[1:21:31] god i want you right in here lays your
[1:21:34] place according to the blueprint your
[1:21:35] place lays here right here you get in
[1:21:37] there gad and stay in here benjamin you
[1:21:39] go right down here and now you all stay
[1:21:41] away from the border of the philistines
[1:21:44] joshua comes back here they all are over
[1:21:46] in the philistines having a big old
[1:21:48] shindig just dancing up like that and
[1:21:50] all the women painted up and dancing
[1:21:51] around having a big time and joshua
[1:21:53] scratches his head and says now what now
[1:21:56] that's just exactly what's taking place
[1:21:58] not all thank god not all but too many
[1:22:02] what he's saying is he divide up the
[1:22:03] land he gave the borders he wanted
[1:22:05] separation and then they begin to mix
[1:22:07] and then they begin to lose everything
[1:22:10] it wasn't joshua's fault
[1:22:13] it wasn't god's fault
[1:22:17] amen
[1:22:22] let's go to first corinthians
[1:22:26] and when we go to read this i want to
[1:22:27] remind you
[1:22:29] of all the things we read about the
[1:22:30] apostle paul
[1:22:33] first corinthians 9.
[1:22:36] the apostle paul
[1:22:39] said he was an apostle by the will of
[1:22:40] god
[1:22:42] he was chosen by the grace of god that
[1:22:44] the dispensation of the mystery would be
[1:22:46] given to him not through study by
[1:22:48] revelation
[1:22:50] he knew that god separated him from
[1:22:51] another woman and called him
[1:22:53] and he was ordained to do a work to take
[1:22:55] to be a light unto the gentiles to
[1:22:57] fulfill isaiah
[1:22:59] he knew he was fulfilling prophecy he
[1:23:01] knew he was called by god he knew he was
[1:23:02] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:23:04] world he knew he was predestinated
[1:23:07] but look what he says in first
[1:23:08] corinthians 9
[1:23:10] and 24
[1:23:13] know you not they that which run in a
[1:23:15] race run all
[1:23:17] but one receiveth the prize
[1:23:19] so run that you may obtain
[1:23:21] and every man that striveth for the
[1:23:23] mastery is temperate in all things now
[1:23:25] they do it to obtain a corruptible crown
[1:23:27] but we are incorruptable
[1:23:29] i therefore so run not as uncertain so
[1:23:32] finally not as one that beateth the air
[1:23:34] but i keep under my body and bring it
[1:23:36] into subjection lest that by any means
[1:23:39] when i have preached to others i myself
[1:23:41] should be a castaway
[1:23:45] paul's
[1:23:46] revelation of his calling his election
[1:23:50] his position
[1:23:52] paul knew he wasn't changing his mind on
[1:23:55] ephesians 1.
[1:23:59] but
[1:24:00] paul's revelation of his security and
[1:24:02] his position
[1:24:03] never allowed paul to get laxed in his
[1:24:06] own life
[1:24:09] the apostle paul kept under his body the
[1:24:12] apostle paul brought his body in the
[1:24:14] subject and the apostle paul ran so that
[1:24:16] he would be the one to win the prize he
[1:24:19] wasn't a lazy christian he wasn't a soft
[1:24:21] christian amen he didn't pretend god was
[1:24:23] a doting grandpa who would never punish
[1:24:25] him or correct him amen he didn't have
[1:24:27] that attitude he had the attitude that
[1:24:29] i'm running to win this race i'm running
[1:24:32] i am denying myself i'm being temperate
[1:24:34] in all things i'm controlling my
[1:24:35] passions my lust my likes my appetites
[1:24:39] to win this race the apostle paul he was
[1:24:42] very secure in his position amen but he
[1:24:45] recognized that in the security in his
[1:24:48] position that if he does not keep under
[1:24:50] himself and control himself and deny
[1:24:53] himself that he was going to lose this
[1:24:55] race
[1:24:58] that he was going to fall short
[1:25:01] not change his predestination
[1:25:05] but fall short
[1:25:08] the remember says in the uniting time
[1:25:10] and sign some people tries to introduce
[1:25:12] christianity that you're free from worry
[1:25:14] no you're not
[1:25:15] you're free from tension oh no you add
[1:25:17] tension when you become a christian
[1:25:19] because you're kind of a slop go happy
[1:25:21] go lucky whatever it was out there not
[1:25:23] caring what you did
[1:25:25] but when you become a real christian
[1:25:27] every moment you're wondering am i
[1:25:29] pleasing my lord
[1:25:30] if i could hear from him it puts you on
[1:25:33] tension put you on guard
[1:25:37] it doesn't say i'm eternally secure i
[1:25:39] can no more be lost and god can be lost
[1:25:41] i can sit here and watch this nascar
[1:25:43] race all day long and god don't care he
[1:25:45] loves me
[1:25:48] nobody puts you on guard and says is
[1:25:49] this pleasing to god
[1:25:51] is this what he wants me to do is this
[1:25:55] is this going to get me where i want to
[1:25:56] go am i having victory over the devil
[1:25:59] am i pressing the battle
[1:26:01] you see it's it doesn't change i mean
[1:26:04] brother ben said i could go down on the
[1:26:05] river and i could fish every day of my
[1:26:07] life and not lose my salvation
[1:26:09] he'd be just as saved as he's always
[1:26:10] saved he's just a child of god as he
[1:26:12] always that was secure before the
[1:26:13] foundation of the world amen so brother
[1:26:15] benham wasn't out there suffering amen
[1:26:18] he wasn't suffering rejection suffering
[1:26:21] hardship suffering the the lack of his
[1:26:23] family's love amen suffering the
[1:26:25] rejection the the hostile environments
[1:26:28] the hot meeting crowds the exhaustion
[1:26:30] the sore throat
[1:26:32] the sicknesses
[1:26:34] you realize he wasn't doing all that to
[1:26:37] gain more merit with god to secure a
[1:26:38] position in heaven he was doing that
[1:26:41] because he loved god
[1:26:43] because he saw the program of god he
[1:26:45] knew that he could go sit on the bank of
[1:26:47] a river and fish every day of his life
[1:26:48] and have the same salvation
[1:26:52] but what did he sacrifice for he
[1:26:53] sacrificed for god
[1:27:00] brother man says in hebrews chapter 6.
[1:27:04] grace is what god did for me
[1:27:06] works is what i do for god
[1:27:08] now they'll make a doctrine out of it
[1:27:10] they think that the works is what wins
[1:27:11] your merits
[1:27:13] if it is it isn't a free gift grace is
[1:27:15] what god did for you by grace you're
[1:27:17] saved and works is what you do in
[1:27:18] appreciation of the grace that he showed
[1:27:21] to you
[1:27:22] if you love him you like to do the works
[1:27:24] of the lord certainly because then you
[1:27:26] love him
[1:27:33] brotherhood says in 1965 and knoweth it
[1:27:35] not
[1:27:36] and what are we coming here for what are
[1:27:38] we doing are we coming here playing a
[1:27:40] game are we coming here meeting out as a
[1:27:42] lodge it's christ
[1:27:45] can't come
[1:27:46] until the church is perfectly right
[1:27:50] he is waiting
[1:27:52] on us
[1:27:55] when did he say that
[1:27:56] august 15 1965
[1:28:03] he is waiting on us
[1:28:04] i believe we're at the end
[1:28:09] he can't
[1:28:10] finish this work
[1:28:13] until the church is perfectly right
[1:28:16] because the bride has made herself ready
[1:28:19] she's in partnership with god god has
[1:28:21] given the word and she's putting it on
[1:28:24] he gave her the word she's putting it on
[1:28:26] amen and as he's unveiling more of the
[1:28:28] word she's putting it on
[1:28:30] the bride has made herself ready
[1:28:33] let's turn to philippians i want to read
[1:28:34] this last scripture as we go
[1:28:42] philippians
[1:28:43] chapter 3.
[1:28:49] philippians chapter 3 and verse 12.
[1:28:55] before we read i want to remind you
[1:28:56] again of the apostle paul
[1:28:58] the apostle paul was secure in his
[1:29:00] position he knew his calling and
[1:29:02] election he knew who he was and what he
[1:29:04] was called for he met the pillar of fire
[1:29:06] the pillar of fire called him amen then
[1:29:08] he sent ananias a prophet to tell him
[1:29:10] that his position was he was a chosen
[1:29:12] vessel of god and what he must suffer he
[1:29:14] went into the the wilderness of arabia
[1:29:17] and received the revelation from jesus
[1:29:18] christ himself on the mystery of god to
[1:29:20] the old testament
[1:29:22] he wasn't worried about whether he was
[1:29:24] predestinated or not
[1:29:26] he wasn't worried about whether he was
[1:29:28] chosen and elected or not
[1:29:30] so that keep that in mind when we read
[1:29:32] philippians 3
[1:29:34] 12
[1:29:36] not as though i had already attained
[1:29:39] either were already perfect
[1:29:41] but i follow after if that i may
[1:29:43] apprehend that for which also i am
[1:29:45] apprehended of christ
[1:29:47] brethren i count not myself to have
[1:29:49] apprehended but this one thing i do
[1:29:51] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:29:52] and reaching forth into those things
[1:29:54] which are before i press toward the mark
[1:29:56] for the prize of the high calling of god
[1:30:00] in christ jesus
[1:30:06] if we had been called by a pillar of
[1:30:08] fire
[1:30:10] and heard the voice of god and had god
[1:30:12] meet us in arabia and give us divine
[1:30:14] revelation by himself and if we had seen
[1:30:17] miracles and and all kinds of things
[1:30:21] it would be easy to get relaxed and say
[1:30:23] god loves me
[1:30:25] chosen me
[1:30:26] everything's fine with me and god
[1:30:29] but paul says i run this race to win it
[1:30:34] i am temperate in all things i keep
[1:30:37] after my body so that i'm not a cast
[1:30:39] away i don't claim to have already
[1:30:41] attained that thing that apprehended me
[1:30:43] but i'm pressing
[1:30:45] i'm
[1:30:46] pushing i'm climbing i'm striving to the
[1:30:49] mark of the high calling in christ jesus
[1:30:54] why
[1:30:55] god is in partnership with man
[1:30:58] and as long as we're not doing what god
[1:31:00] leads us to do we are
[1:31:02] paralyzing the program of god
[1:31:07] he is waiting
[1:31:08] on us
[1:31:15] when the canaanites wouldn't move
[1:31:16] because they had iron chariots
[1:31:20] what was god waiting on
[1:31:22] he was waiting for them
[1:31:24] to keep pushing them back
[1:31:28] push them back
[1:31:29] if you win an inch it's yours
[1:31:35] they could just keep that mentality
[1:31:37] go to battle again but they're iron
[1:31:39] chariots but i'm not you know what i'm
[1:31:41] not hoping to see them turn down and run
[1:31:43] away i just need to get another inch
[1:31:49] why because if i can walk there it's
[1:31:52] mine he promised it to me
[1:31:55] they got lazy because it was hard it was
[1:31:57] hard work it was labor intensive it was
[1:32:00] difficult and they wanted to go ahead
[1:32:02] and enjoy the privileges and the
[1:32:03] promises that they had already got they
[1:32:04] wanted to settle down with their little
[1:32:06] kids they wanted to play with their kids
[1:32:07] in their yard and grow food in their
[1:32:09] garden and
[1:32:11] nothing different than what you and i
[1:32:12] want
[1:32:14] don't want to always be in strife i
[1:32:15] don't always want to be fighting a
[1:32:17] battle i don't always want to be pushing
[1:32:18] against evil i just want to enjoy my
[1:32:20] kids i just want to play
[1:32:23] human beings i've been human beings for
[1:32:25] 6 000 years they haven't changed all of
[1:32:27] a sudden
[1:32:30] so they put them under tribute they made
[1:32:31] a deal we won't fight you you don't
[1:32:33] fight us but the very children that they
[1:32:36] wanted to play with and the
[1:32:37] grandchildren they wanted to enjoy were
[1:32:39] the ones that became in bondage to the
[1:32:41] same canaanites that they wouldn't drive
[1:32:43] out
[1:32:45] and you think your complex and your
[1:32:47] compromise is not going to affect your
[1:32:48] children and your grandchildren
[1:32:54] see what is it what is it you want what
[1:32:56] are you coming back again
[1:32:58] one inch
[1:33:00] i want to get another foothold
[1:33:03] i want to resist the devil
[1:33:05] i want to be free from this complex free
[1:33:08] from this habit
[1:33:09] free from this thinking i want to be
[1:33:11] free
[1:33:12] the only way for my freedom is for me in
[1:33:15] partnership with god he promised me he's
[1:33:18] kept his and he'll always keep his end
[1:33:22] i just want to get another inch
[1:33:25] that's all the farther i get today
[1:33:27] that's okay because he's promised little
[1:33:29] by little he'll drive them out the
[1:33:30] promise is it'll go
[1:33:32] sickness will go i just i just want to
[1:33:34] get another inch
[1:33:39] realize friends
[1:33:40] he's on partnership we're not waiting on
[1:33:43] god god's done everything he's going to
[1:33:44] do he's waiting on us
[1:33:50] partnership with man
[1:33:54] ephesians one through three
[1:33:57] that gives me complete rest in my heart
[1:34:00] total rest and satisfaction that no
[1:34:03] matter what if i fail tomorrow nothing's
[1:34:05] changed with god
[1:34:07] my position with god will a rod come
[1:34:09] down yes will i suffer yes amen will i
[1:34:11] get sick every time i come up over the
[1:34:13] knobs maybe
[1:34:16] you realize brother branham had to go
[1:34:17] visit a grave and lay flowers at a grave
[1:34:19] of a baby and a wife because of
[1:34:21] disobedience
[1:34:23] will you suffer absolutely will it
[1:34:25] change your sonship no
[1:34:30] what did he have to do keep pressing the
[1:34:32] battle
[1:34:34] keep pressing yesterday's failures or
[1:34:35] yesterday's failures keep pressing the
[1:34:37] battle
[1:34:39] the suffering from the mistake i made is
[1:34:41] the suffering i'll suffer if i suffer
[1:34:42] the rest of my life i'll suffer but i'm
[1:34:43] going to press the battle
[1:34:47] because god's in partnership with me and
[1:34:49] he's depending on me to take the second
[1:34:52] half of ephesians and put put it into
[1:34:54] flesh and live it out
[1:34:56] by his grace by his spirit amen he's
[1:34:59] given us his spirit he's given us his
[1:35:01] word now he's waiting for the bride to
[1:35:02] put the word on
[1:35:04] and display it to the world
[1:35:07] say friends let's not quit fighting
[1:35:10] let's not quit pressing
[1:35:13] it sounds good
[1:35:14] god put man on partnership with him
[1:35:16] we're partners we're joint heirs 50 50.
[1:35:22] that just gives you a position of
[1:35:23] responsibility
[1:35:27] who much is given
[1:35:28] much is expected
[1:35:31] and i said god
[1:35:33] help me to have the attitude of the
[1:35:34] apostle paul
[1:35:36] i don't claim to have attained where i
[1:35:38] need to be
[1:35:39] i don't claim to have gotten a hold of
[1:35:42] this thing that's gotten a hold of me
[1:35:44] but i'm pressing toward the mark of the
[1:35:46] high calling in christ
[1:35:48] i'm not running just hoping that i'll
[1:35:51] make it across i'm running to win this
[1:35:53] race
[1:35:55] i'm beating this body and putting
[1:35:57] subjection i'm denying myself pleasures
[1:35:59] that the flesh wants thoughts that the
[1:36:01] flesh wants to think on denying them
[1:36:03] fighting the battle pressing the iron
[1:36:05] chariots again and again and again
[1:36:08] winning one foothold by one foothold by
[1:36:11] one foothold until eventually it's gone
[1:36:15] many of you have fought battles for
[1:36:17] years family situations complexes
[1:36:19] sicknesses in your body fought it for
[1:36:21] years but you got deliverance didn't you
[1:36:25] it didn't come instantly it might have
[1:36:26] been weeks it might have been months
[1:36:28] might have been years but god moves on
[1:36:30] that thing if we're willing to stick
[1:36:32] with it with the word of god and keep
[1:36:33] moving forward
[1:36:37] we want things out of our lives god's
[1:36:38] own partnership with us
[1:36:42] we want things to change around us god's
[1:36:44] own partnership with us
[1:36:47] we want to climb higher god's own
[1:36:49] partnership with us
[1:36:51] you understand
[1:36:52] we've got to keep climbing friends we've
[1:36:55] got to keep pressing we've got to keep
[1:36:56] striving we're caught to keep breeding
[1:36:58] our body into obedience we've got to do
[1:37:00] the thing we can do because god will do
[1:37:02] the thing we can't
[1:37:04] but the thing god can't do
[1:37:07] is force you
[1:37:09] because he put us on a law a free moral
[1:37:11] agency
[1:37:13] if i'll do what god's asked me to do
[1:37:15] he'll do what he promised he'll do
[1:37:18] but god cannot pick me up stick me here
[1:37:22] so he can bless me
[1:37:24] he can tell me to go here for a blessing
[1:37:26] and i have to move over of my own free
[1:37:29] moral agency to receive it
[1:37:36] you know what
[1:37:37] i wish
[1:37:39] i don't really wish but i could say this
[1:37:41] way many wish you could have lazy boy
[1:37:43] religion
[1:37:45] kick the legs up
[1:37:46] if god wants me to have it i'll have it
[1:37:48] if he doesn't i won't
[1:37:50] what do you mean he already said he
[1:37:51] wants you to have it
[1:37:53] if he wants me to be healed i'll be
[1:37:54] healed if he doesn't want me to be
[1:37:55] healed i won't be healed
[1:37:57] his word already says he healed your
[1:37:59] disease he wants you to be healed his
[1:38:01] word is his will
[1:38:03] his will is his word well if it's the
[1:38:05] will of god i'll get better if it's not
[1:38:06] the will of god i won't that's not the
[1:38:08] attitude he wants the attitude he wants
[1:38:10] is it's his will i'm healed i'm pressing
[1:38:12] this thing until i'm completely
[1:38:13] delivered
[1:38:20] see no no
[1:38:22] no bowing out of the partnership
[1:38:25] no
[1:38:26] bowing out of our commitments say it's
[1:38:28] all on him whatever he wants will happen
[1:38:30] if he wants if he wants this to happen
[1:38:32] to him if he wants that to happen it'll
[1:38:33] happen
[1:38:36] what about us just keeping his word and
[1:38:38] believing him
[1:38:39] what about us exercising our faith and
[1:38:41] his promises and watching them come on
[1:38:43] the scene
[1:38:44] what about us crying out for deliverance
[1:38:47] like they did in israel in egypt
[1:38:51] god is waiting for us to ask
[1:38:53] and believe what we ask for so that he
[1:38:56] can come on the scene
[1:38:57] you realize when god was recreating the
[1:39:00] earth and repositioning the earth amen
[1:39:02] to be inhabited now for a garden of eden
[1:39:04] he had to speak his own word and believe
[1:39:06] his own word before it would come to
[1:39:07] pass and he's put us the same way he's
[1:39:10] asking us to take his word to speak his
[1:39:12] word and believe his word so that he can
[1:39:14] bring it to pass
[1:39:17] he's looking for somebody to take him
[1:39:19] out of his word so he can come on the
[1:39:20] scene
[1:39:22] how do you call jesus on the scene
[1:39:24] believe his word and stand on his word
[1:39:25] you'll call him on the scene
[1:39:28] god bless you let's stand musicians
[1:39:30] should come
[1:39:34] god is so good to us friends
[1:39:36] he's so good to us to give us his word
[1:39:41] you realize
[1:39:42] god's goodness is expressed in his word
[1:39:47] sometimes we think god's goodness is
[1:39:49] expressed
[1:39:53] in a way that a grandfather would spoil
[1:39:56] a grandson
[1:39:59] but god's goodness is expressed in his
[1:40:01] word
[1:40:04] and if we'll just take that word which
[1:40:06] is the goodness of god and put it on us
[1:40:09] apply it stand on it press forward with
[1:40:11] it we'll see god do everything that he
[1:40:14] said he'll do
[1:40:15] and he wants to
[1:40:17] but he's got to be somebody that'll
[1:40:19] believe it and act on it man let's just
[1:40:22] pray
[1:40:24] lord jesus we thank you father for your
[1:40:26] word
[1:40:28] and god what a simple lesson today
[1:40:31] but what a profound lesson

[1:40:36] word and through the message lord that
[1:40:39] would change our lives if we could apply
[1:40:41] it
