same your word ever Remains the Same and we're so thankful we can gather again sing your Praises hear your word and feast at your table God we're asking that you would come on the scene and you would come yourself and break the bread of life for us you've been so faithful to feed us Lord and we're so confident and your faithfulness that we've come again with great expectation to feed from you again pray that you give us what we have need of Lord and that you would take preeminence Among Us take these lips under your control and speak your words of eternal life may we leave from here better than we came closer to you in a closer fellowship with a clear Direction God strip away everything that's unlike you and bring us into Lord that perfect realization that you want for us in this day may become more real day by day in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this is fun we go straight from Retreat to special after Retreat meetings so while we're standing let's take our Bibles and turn to Second Timothy this reminds me of the past we were in here about 18 years ago and so a lot of memories flooding back and so we thank God when the sound system they're they're not finished they're still doing some connecting and some tuning to that should be ready to go by Sunday but while they're finishing that I thank God we got a place we can still gather and hear the word so this place is just waiting here to be used amen uh let's look at second Timothy 1:9 who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which he has given us in Christ Jesus before the world began man God bless you as you take your seats just want to say once again what a wonderful time we had at The Retreat for all those who were able to gather there it was quite a blessing and and really had great impact on me I felt like I grew quite a bit so I thank God for the word that was preached and for the fellowship that we shared but as I was giving thank yous I forgot one and I forgot registration and you know who did registration it was my son Blake so of everybody I forgot I forgot my own son but anyways we appreciate Blake doing registration again and this year sister Nita Hatfield helped him quite a bit and she took a lot of responsibility so we appreciate that and I'm sorry for forgetting them but if your brothers and sisters have to forgive you your children have to double so it's good amen the parking lot looked nice didn't it appreciate the trustees taking care of that and even the mistake worked out for good so praise God all things are good just wanted to remind you that I'll be traveling this weekend up to um BC in Canada preaching for uh brother Chris meritz at Living Word Fellowship for their Thanksgiving meetings and if you didn't know Canada uh they celebrate their Thanksgiving in October so this year I get two thanksgivings am amen when it works out it's really good so so I've asked brother Gabe Smith to take the Sunday service so he'll be ministering Lord willing this Sunday and then the following Sunday after that I'll be back Lord willing for the Wednesday service then the following Sunday brother Danny dundo will be with us so he'll be taking that service so praise the Lord be praying so the guinea pig for the new sound system is brother Blake and brother Gabe I pray it all works out for you brother but brother gab you got such a deep voice you can just throw away the microphone and just go brother so it'll work good so just be praying about that also we have some visitors here tonight all the way from Jacksonville Florida Brother David sister Margarita and their daughter Valentina God bless you right over here amen they came up uh to to visit Jeffersonville and wanted to come a little further north North and visit here so God bless you you're very welcome and their their fellow shipping down there at Victory Tabernacle with brother Keith Brown but they brought some very special greetings from brother emanuel's brother Nick and his sister-in-law sister Anna Marie we bring greetings to everybody they're in fellowship with them down there so many of you remember them when they were here that's good also I want to say hi to Sister Karen Sanders God bless you she's here with uh some friends of hers some friends that we just met brother Derek and sister Denise right and their family so it's good to have you guys here and so what a Time visit this isn't what it's normally like so this is a special visit on a special day but praise God anyhow amen when um when I come to this service I was thinking about the weekend and um something struck me and many things struck me of course but I was wanting to take something that brother Eugene had said early on uh I think it was Friday night and uh I wanted to capitalize on it because there was so much that was said I felt like through the weekend there was so much new revelation and new understanding so much territory being gained it was almost like the borders were just pushed wide open for us and I don't want to just blow by that but I I have a desire in my heart to go back over that again so that we don't lose what God had showed us I really want to spend some time in that and there was something that he said Friday night that I just wrote down and he didn't spend a lot of time on it and I thought I want to go back because I don't want to miss that there was a profound statement that he made and I don't want to miss that so I'm going to do that tonight Lord willing so we started in 2 Timothy 1:9 and it says who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace so now the the reason that God has called us was not because of us as far as our ability or our works or anything that we've done or earned but according to his purpose and Grace and his grace is his love expressed so that's why we're saved and that's why we're called uh that's the single reason is because he purposed before the foundation of the world and he extended Grace amen so so with that I want to come to Romans chapter 5 so let's turn so keep your Bibles handy we're going to go to quite a few scriptures here really quickly but this next one will be Romans chapter 5 and this is the scripture that brother Eugene had us turned to Friday night when he made this statement that struck me in chapter 5 verse one of the book of Romans it says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith un to this Grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God uh and when brother Eugene read that if you'll remember he says we have access by faith so the access we have to God's grace and this purpose the access is Faith how do we get in touch with that Grace how do we get in touch with God's purpose amen it's through faith amen and God bless you brother Derek sister Farah I'm sorry we can't even get you into a regular service yet you just move here and go to retreat and then come here but hey just be patient amen you'll get you'll get into the main sanctuary eventually we're just testing you to see if you'll hang with us so therefore being justified by faith that's an interesting statement justified by faith because we know that by his blood he justified us so are we justified by faith or we justified by his blood the answer is yes so I'll just give it to you now the answer is yes amen we are saved by grace amen but we're saved by his blood brother B says over and over we're saved by the blood of God Amen but but we know that we're saved by faith and is it by the blood or is it by faith and the answer is yes because where's my access what's my access to all that God has given me all that God has provided for me I could never provide for myself God has provided but where do how do I access what God has given me and the access point the portal the door is Faith praise God so this is the scripture that he opened with and when he went into that subject and then let's go to back to Ephesian uh Ephesians chapter 2 and then we're going to come back to Romans Ephesians chapter 2 verse 8 Ephesians 2 and8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself eles it is the gift of God so if you ever had Faith to believe if you ever have faith to access the things of God that was a gift of God it also wasn't something we earned or worked our way into or had willpower enough to uh come to Faith that also was a gift of God Amen and God We Know by the message of the hour that God Amen planted a seed of predestination within us and that seed of predestination was his Gene his attribute his word a portion of himself and that's what we believe with amen not with our mind and not with our will and we believe with that part of God he's deposited in us before the foundation of the world Amen so you know remember when brother bam talked about um the woman at the well in Samaria who comes to the woman at the well amen and immediately she begins to recognize this is a special gift speaking to me and she goes I perceive you're a prophet and when when she perceives he's a prophet she wants to know the right way to worship God because a prophet can tell her the right way to worship God God and after that he begins to discern her life and and and and and he begins to tell her about the father seeketh such this worship Him these that Worship in spirit and in truth and then she goes Messiah cometh and when he comes he'll tell us these things and then all of a sudden Jesus said I am he she dropped her water pot and went running into the city to tell them all that she had heard and she said is not this the Messiah she believed amen but but the Pharisees brother man went and compared the Pharisee the Pharisee looked at him do the signs and wonders show the sign of the Messiah connect the dots on the word and the Pharisees said you're be elub she said you're Messiah and what brother B said she had representation in heaven she had something to believe with the Pharisee had nothing to believe with but she had something to believe with amen and listen the faith that she had amen that was given to her of God was her ACC access to the grace that was available in that day because the Pharisee had nothing to believe with he had no C Gene of eternal life he had no access to the mercy that was in his day amen to the grace that was available he could not access it because he could not believe let's go back to Romans Romans chapter 4 Romans 4 and: 16 therefore it is a faith that it might be by Grace so listen God gave it by Grace not by works but by his eternal love for his elect that's Grace so he wanted it to be by Grace so he had to have a mechanism to where he can make it by Grace not works not effort not abilities not not anything you would do but strictly by his grace but he can he has to have the grace out there because he wants to give it by Grace but he's got a way he has to have a mechanism by which he can get this Grace only to the elect and not to the nonel so he has to come up with a mechanism or an access point he gives the grace now there has to be an access to that Grace and so he makes the access by faith am let's read it again there therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to all that also which is of the faith of Abraham which is us the faith seed who is the father of us all God wanted to make sure that you would get this grace and so the the mechanism by which you access this grace is by faith so he deposited a portion of himself in you a part of the word so when the word came con contact with the word it could believe the word and that would be our access to Grace oh praise be to God let's turn over to First Peter we're going to do some flipping back and forth but oh it's good 1 Peter chapter 1 1 Peter chapter 1 verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you it's interesting what would your inheritance reserved in heaven for you be we'll move on who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time amen so what are we kept by the power of God are you kept by the power of God how are you kept by the power of God through faith you understand that it's not it's the power of God keeping us we can't keep ourselves but how do we come in contact with the power of God how does the power of God keep us the power of God keeps us through faith so how are we saved by grace through faith how do we access grace through faith amen all of this is through faith it is the portal it is the mechanism it is the access to all the things that God has and now Faith is the access to the power of God I mean think about it when brother vom told us he said if if he said if Jesus Christ was standing here on on the platform wearing this suit that I'm wearing today amen he could do no more for you than I can Bo I mean you talk about a statement brother that's an unbelievable statement he said if he was standing here in the suit and you come to him and said Jesus heal me he said I can't heal you I already healed you 2,000 years ago you have to accept it by faith or access it by faith because the power for healing has already been made plain the power for healing has already been purchased amen but the a to that is by faith amen let's go all the way back to Romans chapter 1 Romans chapter 1 verse 16 Romans 1 verse 16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the the power of God unto salvation so is the gospel of Christ the power of God to absolutely unto salvation to everyone that believeth think about that the gospel of Christ is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth am but what if you don't believe then it's not the power of Salvation so this is for a specific group those who can believe let's read it again for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek so Peter says we're kept by the power of God through faith the gospel of Christ is the power of God unto salvation to all them that believe so there is a power that will keep us there is a power power that will save us there is a power of God available amen but how do I access the power I access it through faith how do I have faith it is a gift of [Music] God I hope when we walk away this afternoon or this evening we don't walk away saying oh I wish I had Faith but I hope we walk away realizing that God has given me something to access everything I have need of not that we go oh if I could believe a little more if you if God put inside of you the capacity to believe this end time message you've got what's inside the the access to everything that God has is already laying inside the ability to believe is is the key in your hand Amen to every promise of God because if you can believe one promise of God you can believe all the promises of God why because to believe Amen to believe this message to believe what God has done in this day amen is going to take something more than intellect something more than teaching something more than willpower it's going to take a deposit of the C Gene of God Amen that was there before the foundation of the world and if that's there it gave you access to Christ in this day but it gives you access to the power of God Amen in the adoption part three brother B says by faith are you saved that's your faith in God now brother Rim's going to say something so strange here by faith are you saved that's your faith in God the blood keeps you clean from sin because it makes a sacrifice the blood doesn't save you the blood keeps you clean that's right how do you say saved by faith are you saved and that by God's forn knowledge calling you you are saved and the blood makes an atonement constantly keeping you clean now brother B here says the blood doesn't save you the blood keeps you clean but you can find a dozen maybe or more quotes where he says we're saved by the blood of God so does the blood save us or do the blood not save us yes we're saved by the blood of God because that's the price that was paid for our Redemption There's No Redemption without the shedding of blood so we are saved by the blood of God but the question is God came and he shed his own blood amen and when he shed his own blood why isn't everyone saved he shed his blood he purchased the whole World why why when he came as a sacrifice and shed his blood if we're saved by the blood of God when the blood of God spilled why wasn't everybody automatically redeemed and saved you know brother bam says that that only the elect is considered in Redemption amen that was what drove him to Calvary was the elect and so now now you know it's not that brother brenham's contradicting himself it's not that he's right in one spot and wrong in the other spot we don't believe that mean we don't believe the message that way but what he's trying to show you is if you're only saved by Blood then everybody who can recognize amen that God shed his blood that Jesus Christ died would automatically be saved but there has to be an access to what that blood purchased and that access is by faith and that's why brother Brenham says you're saved by faith well when you go to the scripture the scripture actually says you're saved by grace amen Ephesians 2 you're saved by grace so am I saved by the blood or am I saved by grace or am I saved by faith and I'll key you off the answer is yes because there has to be some way for you to access the grace amen and that Grace amen brought the blood on the scene by grace to purchase my Redemption and my salvation so I am saved by the blood I am justified by the blood I am saved by faith I am justified by the faith because though justification is available how do I know it's available to me how do I know I'm Justified because I'm justified by faith but there's another scripture that we justified by the blood of Christ am I justified by the blood of Christ or justified by faith and the answer is yes because I have to have an access because he had the way to make it by Grace but he had to ensure that the promise would come to all the seed so he made it by faith so that it could be by Grace because he didn't want us working our way into it cuz he knew in hybrid flesh we would fail we could never climb the ladder fast enough and high enough for our own salvation so he had to set the scenario where he would pay the price where he would have the power of Salvation where he would shed the blood but he would have to have an access point where you can access all of those benefits and that was by faith you might say brother Chad it's rigged and I say yes it's rigged and sometimes that troubles people but don't let that trouble you because if it was not predetermined predestinated rigged there's not a soul on this planet that would have ever been [Music] saved we say oh that's not fair some get it some don't listen we don't you don't understand only the elect is considered in Redemption amen remember the parable of the pearl of great price amen when the merchant found the Pearl amen he sold all that he had he gave up everything and he bought the field amen why did he buy the field because he wanted the Pearl he didn't it's not the field he was after it was the Pearl in the field that Parable is a parable to the kingdom amen Jesus Christ gave up everything he had and paid the ultimate price he paid all that he could pay he paid with his his own blood he paid with his own life he gave up everything and in that in that giving up he bought the field which is the whole world and everything that's contained in the world now belongs to him that right why did he do that for the rede the Redemption of the elect because there was a pearl in the field and he bought the field for the Pearl but if you go to the church age book now all of the sudden we go to the white Throne judgment and realize that as Jesus I mean as as Jesus is administering judgment you have people there who are not the predestinated elect seat of God Amen they weren't even considered in the Redemption as far as the whole purpose for buying the fieldes that makes sense but the but brother bham tells us but because he owns it all amen he can decide what he wants to do with what he owns follow me and that's at the white Throne judgment there are multitudes of people who enter into eternal life not previously having had it because the elect previously had it there's a whole slew of people that come into eternal life not previously having had eternal life and what are they at the white Throne judgment they're saved they enter in he said they enter in to to eternal life to enter into life that that has no End Amen cuz time is abolished at this point so they enter into eternal life although they didn't have eternal life that make sense we together none of those people would enter in if there was not an elect that was lost that needed redeemed not one of them would go in not one of them would pass beyond the portal of time and go beyond the barrier of time not one of them if there wasn't a pearl in the field he was with willing to sell all to buy what looks like is unfair is the greatest Mercy that's ever struck the Earth it amen it is the most wonderful thing that's ever happened that God would give himself to save himself and in the process he would buy it all giving himself the right Amen to choose Amen to allow himself to set the parameters where those who were not initially intended to come in can come in it opened the door to Salvation it blew wide open the door to Salvation this gospel is beautiful this message this message takes everything we've known to a whole another level it makes God so wonderful so powerful so Majestic let's go to Luke Chapter 7 Luke chapter 7 in verse 47 this is the story of Simon's the Pharisees home when they did not wash jesus' feet neither gave him kiss or anointing and we know the Harlot did that for him in verse 47 it says wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little was forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that sat at meat with with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said to the woman thy faith hath save thee go in peace she was saved by faith which is saved by grace thy faith has saved thee what was it she believed in what was it she did he never said because you anointed me it wasn't her works that the works were an expression of her faith it wasn't because if that's all it took to be saved I would grab a bottle the next chance I had and break it on his head and break it on his feet if that would guarantee me salvation I would go through the motions you understand what I'm saying if there's a work that you can do amen that would guarantee salvation it wasn't the fact that she anointed him with oil it was the fact that she believed this was the Messiah is the reason she anointed him with oil she recognized who he was amen and she was willing to serve him amen and he says you know he he he's there and he he's talking to Simon and Simon you never greeted me Simon you never anointed me Simon you didn't recognize me but this woman has not ceased since I came Amen to anoint my feet and wash him with tears and wipe him with her hair kiss my feet and I say you know in this day in the day that Jesus is saying this all the Pharisees all the Jews they they understand salvation only one way and that is through a substitute tionary lamb or a dove or a goat amen and Jesus is standing here who is the word and you know what blew their minds is that he forgave their sin but he didn't require her to go make an offering he didn't require her to go to the temple to go to the priest to buy a dove to take a goat she didn't have to do anything that they expected her to need to do to be forgiven he was abled simply because he was the word amen he was able to say because you believed Faith was her access to Salvation Faith was her access to forgiveness of sins amen let's go to Matthew chapter 9 we don't have any PowerPoint we don't have a whiteboard this good oldfashioned Bible study Matthew chapter 9 verse 18 and while he spake these things unto them behold there came a certain ruler and worshiped him saying my daughter is even now dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live and Jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciples and behold a Wom a woman which had which was diseased with an issue of blood 12 years came behind him and touched the Hem of His Garment for she said within herself if I may be if I may but touch His Garment I shall be whole but Jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good Comfort thy faith hath made thee whole and the woman was made whole from that hour and brother bham references this in the message is the rising of the Sun he says now how many has got quickening power now lay your hands upon one another if that quickening power is in you now there is only one thing to keep it from hindering that's your unbelief a woman touched His Garment was made whole a Roman soldier spit in his face and went to hell it depends on where you're at do you believe it am see when when Jesus turned around to the woman he says go thy way and be healed because you touched my hem you're whole right because if that was the case I would throw myself through the crowd and crawled my way over there and it was never going to be a formula it was never going to be a work it was never going to be something that can be replicated to guarantee success it was always going the the mystery was that this grace is going to be sure to the seed by what access by faith and he says he turns around he says your action he didn't say your action made you whole he didn't say your touching made you whole he didn't say your perseverance you're crawling on your knees you're pushing through the crowd it was none of that all of that was an expression of her faith but when he turned around he said daughter be of good Comfort thy faith ha made thee whole what was her access to Healing Faith why did she crawl on her knees and push through the crowd and touch the him of His Garment anyways because she believed in her heart it was an expression of her faith she believed praise God let's go to Hebrews chapter 11 now Hebrews chap 11 verse one now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear the world was framed by faith yes question is was it framed by the word of God or by faith the answer is yes yes you guys can pass this test you all get a 100 it was the word of God but here's what brother brandom says he says do you know that everything that you see tonight is God's word materialized do you know your body is God's word materialized do you know that be them beans there is God's word materialized do you know that concrete is God spoke and word materialized do you know this whole earth is God spoke and said let there be and he believed his own word and the Earth came into existence if it didn't where did it come from well you say it come off the sun well who spoke the sun into existence see everything is God's word the worlds were framed by the word of God the Bible says so God just spoke it and he believed his own word and that's what it was amen if God Amen if God had to believe his own word and then it come into manifestation what do we need to do with his word to bring it into manifestation believe it let's go to Mark chapter n Mark chapter n verse 23 Mark 9 and 23 says Jesus said unto them if thou cast believe all things are possible to him that believeth what is our access to the supernatural Faith simple faith if thou cast believe all things are possible to him that believeth if you can't believe it's not possible but if you can believe it's possible believe in what brother Chad I just said believe not in want just believe Amen brother B said perfect faith will bring the word into manifestation amen what part do I need to believe just believe whatever you believe you can have not believe here but believe deep down here when it drops from the head to the soul amen then that's god let's go to uh Mark 11 Mark 11:20 and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou curses is withered away and Jesus answered saith unto him have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be ye be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you whatsoever what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them that that word Can't Fail that Absolut that's a promise of God Amen that if you can believe in your heart and not doubt let's read that again cuz here's the key therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believing you re I'm sorry let's go let's go up one more verse 23 for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them amen that word Can't Fail that's right brother brandham was musing over this scripture remember he said I never preached on it really because I didn't know I didn't know how to understand it I didn't know how to take it and while he was musing on that while he was thinking about that that's when God came to him and said he started speaking to him about this scripture he's going to show him amen how this works and he begins to tell him amen if you speak it'll be and then he starts saying speak and he doesn't know what to speak for and he says you're hunting you have no squirrels what do you have need of and he starts encouraging him to speak amen and then he speaks the squirrel here and a squirrel there and a squirrel there and whatsoever he said came into manifestation we know this happened five times for him and and we know all of that the squirrels twice and then the salvation of hady writes boys and and then the storm in Colorado and the tumor and his wife amen but every time time God come to him and told him to speak amen and when God came to him and told him to speak how could he doubt in his heart he didn't come up with it it wasn't his idea it wasn't his imagination it wasn't even his own desire amen it was it was something that God wanted to manifest so God come to him and and told him what to do told him it was time and he had no doubt in his heart that it was going to come to pass and that scripture came to life see this scripture this what he's talking about is not trying something I think I'll try to say it and see what it happens I think I I'll conjure up uh uh some emotion and then I'll speak something real forcefully and don't happen that's a failure just waiting to happen this is when God drops something into your heart that's so solid that there's not a doubt in your heart that it'll come to pass this is the faith of God this is not just something that we're working up that's right this is a reality but it is a reality wasn't just a reality in a prophet is a reality for anyone who can believe Amen brother B says the great triumphant General who came down and was made the word made flesh took that word and defeated Satan on every ground and said you destroy this Temple I'll raise it up the third day and why David and the word said that I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell and he knew that that was one promise of God that he'd be raised up and he took that word and went to death with it and knowed that that word had to come to pass listen this is the Faith of Christ being expressed in the word of God brother bam tells us in other places he went to Calvary with one scripture saying that he would raise from the dead amen but he believed it amen and here he expresses it he expresses they destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up in the third day amen why brother B said because he he knew David said right David said amen I'll not suffer my Holy One to seek corruption neither shall I leave his soul in hell and he took that scripture and made that Proclamation and went to Calvary knowing that he would raise because of that scripture so Romans 10 says so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen and you know we hear the word of God all the time but but you know so many people in this world can hear the word in these years you can play you can play a audio version of the Bible and you can play it with all kinds of different voices deep masculine voice you can have one that have different voices as the characters change you can put on the audio and you can play the Bible and you can hear the word but it may not bring you faith that's right because you have to have another set of ears and you have to have ears down on the inside that can hear more than these ears can hear the whole world can hear through these ears if it's spoken in their language but there's a select few that can hear with different ears and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God why because it's the word coming to the word it's a connection of two parts of the same thing praise God so that's why we have to hear the word in the message the Feast of trumpets brother B says and how will the people that's believing him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know that to know what he is Daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know they shall know their God now how he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know know her husband know her mate the revealed word that's why this has to happen what's he talking about he's talking about the third pool the latter rain he's talking about the The Awakening of the Bride he's talking about the Capstone coming down he's talking about the opening of the word he's talking about the opening of the seals why does this has to happen it has to happen because she needs to hear the word amen to give her faith so that she'll recognize her husband the revealed word said it wasn't in the reformers wasn't in Luther Wesley and the Pentecostals in them scripture says it wasn't but it will come that is his promise for this age we're living in the age that his coming will be in she must be identified in him any woman must be identified with her husband for the two R1 and Christ's bride has to be identified with him for the two R1 and he is the word amen not the denomination the word we are to be the children of of the light and the light is the word which is made light for this age how do we know light except it comes from the word all right the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it and the Bible said so why did this light have to come so that she would recognize her mate the revealed word why she had let me just say it this way the bride needed access to Christ so there had to be something to give her faith to come into an invisible Union because by his grace he came am amen by his grace he presented himself by his grace the word came in our day and presented itself to the bride amen but the bride had to have access to Christ amen and what was going to give her access it was going to be faith that would give her access and bring her to an invisible Union listen just because Christ came didn't mean everybody on Earth that day come into an invisible Union and married him is that right just like when his blood was shed on the earth it didn't mean everybody was automatically saved when Christ returned it didn't mean everybody was automatically married there had to be access to that there had to be a way to connect to that what was the way to connect to it it was Faith how was God going to bring us Faith he was going to open the word and show us the mystery amen because in showing us the mystery he was going to awake and the faith that's laying down inside of us so that we can move out into an invisible Union with Christ amen if it wasn't for the opening of the word we would never have access to the Christ that came praise be to God let's go to Hebrews chapter 3 Hebrews chapter 3 in verse 16 did Brother brandom tell us this is uniting signs and times right is this the return of the word is the word Christ is the bridegroom here is the fullness of the word here so that's our Promise Land the word but here in Hebrews 3:16 he says for some when they had heard did provoke how be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses but with whom was he greed 40 years was it not them was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they would not enter into his rest but to them that believed not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief they came all the way to the promised land what God told him he would do to bring them out of Egypt and in Exodus and pave the way and bring them safely across the desert and bring him to the promised land god did everything he said he would do he sent a pillar of fire he sent a prophet he gave him this word he gave him safe passage he gave him Mana he brought them all the way to the border of the promised land but they could not go in because they could not access the promised land because they didn't believe because of unbelief they were kept out of the promised land but I want to asked you a question 40 years later who of that original group went in and accessed the promised land it was the two who believed Joshua and Caleb they went all the way in what gave them the access what preserved their life when everybody else died in the wilderness amen they died they their carcasses fell in the wilderness because they couldn't access the promises of God because of unbelief but there was two who could believe and that was their access to the promised nothing has changed that's the true yeah the dates few of the circumstances but everything else Remains the Same amen we've had a prophet of God a pillar of fire promises and signs and wonders and brought us right up to the promised land brought us right to the promise for the hour right to the invisible Union right to the marriage brought us right to Christ we're standing right before him who can enter in who can enter into the visible Union who can go in and who can't go in the ones who have access are the ones who believe amen the ones who don't believe don't have access to what's standing right here praise be to God now we realize that if God has placed a seed in me that can believe if I have something to believe with think about this if I have the capacity within me to believe the word for this day then God has already guaranteed me access into the promises the access is by faith but it's not my faith it's his faith amen it's his seed it's his attribute it's his word that he placed inside of me before the foundation of the world there's guaranteed access the keys in the hand the gate will swing open why amen because of who I what church I go to where I was born who my parents were how hard I tried or because I repeated everything brother B no because of Faith amen faith is the access to everything the prophet brought brought us right to Promised Land but we can go in because we have access amen oh praise God let's go to Matthew 13 Matthew 13 and verse 53 Matthew 13 and 53 and it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these Parables he departed then when he was coming to his own country he taught them in their in their synagogue in so much that they were astonished and said when hath this man this wisdom in these Mighty works is not this the carpenter son is not this his mother called Mary and his Brethren James and Joseph and Simon and Judas and his sisters are they not all with us whence then hath this man all these things and they were offended in him but Jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor save in his own country and his own house and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief believe it wasn't because his power was diminished it wasn't because he couldn't heal it wasn't because it wasn't even because he didn't want to heal what hindered was unbelief man it's not as though God didn't want his children to go to the promised land what hindered them was unbelief it's not as though God didn't want to heal anybody in capernium or anybody in his hometown it wasn't that he didn't want to it's that he was hindered by belief amen they lost their access to the power that was standing there was the power of God there to heal was the power of God there to deliver nothing changed in the power of God it wasn't as though all of a sudden his batteries were low the power was there but they had no access to that power because they couldn't do what the Harlot woman do wash his feet they couldn't do what the Samaritan that the well could do they couldn't receive who was in their midst they couldn't see it they couldn't believe believe it they then they were cut off from the access to the power that would heal them say God give me eyes to see ears to hear Faith to believe all that you're doing in this day in the message the identification of Christ in all ages he says this heavenly father we are grateful to see the the Risen Messiah 1900 years of all kinds of Theology and movement but still in the darkness of all of it you promised that you would appear here in the last days in this Sodom day and you would make yourself known to the children of Abraham the called the elected and here you are tonight after 1900 years you are just as much alive tonight as you was when you talked to the woman at the well if he's just as much alive as he was amen then that means the power is here amen but we have to have the same access she had to get the benefit of him being here it's God manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband is the same self flesh these two are one and this is what I want to hone in on and the church is becoming the bride amen are you becoming the bride and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word what's her access to be bride her access is Faith amen the ability to believe the word is what's putting her in the bride what's changing her from church from denomination to bride how is she making this move how is she moving from denomination into bride she's moving that way by believing the word what's her access to brideship her access is by faith it's not going to a message church it's not getting along with the Saints it's not agreeing with the pastor that's not access believing the word is access and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word I'm becoming the bride all the time because as he shows me the word there's something in me that says Amen to it amen that's the truth that's the truth I didn't know that before I never saw that before somebody turned to a Bible and they opened the Bible and they showed me something I never seen before but there was something in me that said that ain't nothing but the truth what is that that's my access to be bride not good works not good deeds not going to the right place not a mental agreement with all the right things not dressing right none of that is my access that all is secondary that's a manifestation of the faith that I have in my heart but what's my access to be bride my access is faith in the word and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word so that the word in the church becomes the same the word in the church making it the bride the last sign God identifying himself the word in the church we are not bride because we claim to be bride I'm not bride because my lips can say it I'm bride because my faith and my soul can receive it and believe my access is Faith amen when that word comes and I know I'm not worthy I'm not good enough I didn't get it right I still don't get it right he should have picked a dozen other 10,000 others before he picked me it doesn't change the fact that I still believe I'm one of them by faith I can say I'm one of them that's my access to bride that's my access to Christ Christ is here amen how do I access the Christ that is here by faith let's go to Hebrews 11 we've preached on this quite a bit recently but I don't want to miss it here Hebrews 11 chapter 11 verse 11 through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised listen we know that Sarah was struggling with faith is that right and she wasn't conceiving is that right Sarah was struggling and not conceiving and struggling and not conceiving and she got so old her wound was dried up and and there is no possibility anymore amen but what was her access to the promise her access to the promise was by faith and we've been through this before and we know that Sarah had doubts Sarah had doubts about the promise she had and really when it comes down to it Sarah's doubts all revolved around herself her doubt was whether or not she was part of the promise she wasn't doubting the promise to Abraham she knew God talked to Abraham and she knew from Abraham's seed there would be H the promises were given to Abraham's seed she believed that that's why she came up with the whole thing with Hagar and creating ishmail is because she believed the promise was to Abraham and and her struggle was not as the promise uh uh to Abraham the the struggle is she didn't see herself as part of Abraham you see what happens when we realize we say Amen this is the this is the day for the elect seed God's calling out a bride there's a bride standing on the earth there's an invisible Union amen all of that is fine but if you can't see yourself as part of that word amen there's not a faith to give you access to that word and the devil's going to do everything he can to try to disrupt you and throw doubts into your mind amen because he knows your access is by faith going to make you feel like you're unworthy and no good and condemned but I would like to take him back to the scripture because I am saved by the purpose of God by grace before the foundation of the world so before I was ever unworthy I was declared worthy hallelujah amen and he knows the end from the beginning so if he knew amen that I would I would come down in a polluted State and in a polluted corrupt state I would continue to walk in corruption even knowing that he would choose me before it must say that his purpose is already fixed amen his intent is already fixed his Grace is sure so whatever the devil points you to point back to the word before I did one dirty deed he already declared and wrote my name and the Lamb's Book of Life with indelible ink in his own blood and it cannot be erased so the easiest thing to do is agree with the devil he says you're no good you say you're so that's right you're right do you know what you did the other day you're absolutely right and how can you be bride I don't know you know what I wouldn't pick me but oh I'm so thankful he chose me before the foundation of the world I don't have to argue about it I don't have to prove anything I don't have to defend myself the only thing I have to do is say I I can't help it I believe I mean and that's my access that's all I need is to believe and if I believe amen then the life of the word comes in and begins to live its life out of me amen and there's an expression of my faith that takes place amen so Sarah she herself had to receive strength to conceive the promise was given to Abraham the promise was sure when God told Abraham I'm going to give you a land and your seed shall possess the land he knew it was coming through Sarah the problem was Sarah didn't know it was coming through Sarah the problem was Sarah's Faith the hindrance was Sarah's Faith the block was Sarah's faith it was all about Sarah's Faith so God in his grace he visits Sarah and in this visitation to Sarah something takes place in Sarah and remember Sarah was already turned back young that happens on the plains of memory brother B said they woke up the next morning and they were young they went down to Gar in chapter 19 and and that and that and that young king wanted this young she was already young but still no conception she would turn back back young and there was still no promise amen the promise was waiting for one thing it was waiting for Sarah to access the promise friends the word's been given the promises went forth the message has been declare what's it waiting for it's waiting for the bride to access the promise amen and we become the bride all the time by believing the word and Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is I thought the Rapture would go just whenever God decided the Rapture would go isn't this amazing when God said Abraham you're going to conceive and it's just going to happen God said it God's all powerful God can make anything happen amen but there was something that was waiting something that was waiting some Abraham no seed no seed no seed no seed until there was a certain Junction of time that God came to Sarah herself and unlocked something that was locked up in Sarah's heart and it was the faith to believe and through faith she received strength herself to conceive seed and then the promise come into manifestation what was the promise waiting for it was waiting for Sarah to believe oh if the church only knew its position what are we waiting on oh if the church only knew its position it will one day you believe that oh day by day word by word we're getting there friends Revelation upon Revelation we're growing to it amen it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is I asked you the question what is our access to the Rapture in the first seal he says but think now he wrote this but when he started to write those other seven Thunders he said don't write it he'd been commissioned to write everything he seen But when these seven Thunder Over in Revelation 10 under he said don't write them at all they're mysterious we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they'll be revealed right away and when it do it'll give faith for that rapturing Grace for the church to move out am has the rapturing grace come amen has the church started moving out amen it's going to be under those seven Thunders amen under the revelation of the word because Faith cometh by hearing the word amen Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word and this this as those the Mysteries are revealed it'll give faith for the rapturing grace for that church to move out do you mean there's rapturing Grace amen is Grace something you do or something he gave is Grace earned or is Grace a free gift I want to ask you has the Rapture already been given to the church it's already been given to the church by rapturing Grace now if I've been saved before the foundation of the world Amen and I was saved by the blood of Calvary amen but there was a mechanism that tapped me into my salvation amen I was saved by grac amen yeah through faith I'll be raptured by grace through faith praise be to God it's that simple and the count on he said and father so many things could be said right here maybe the church wouldn't understand but I pray that you'll give them such a crave for it Lord that they'll come and see we're at the end time the astronaut age I pray father that they'll realize it isn't trying to condemn what they had it's only trying to give them more rapturing grace what is the message trying to do give rapturing Grace for the hour will come when we'll have to have Rapture power not only to heal the body but to change it in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Christ will be so real into our bodies till he can change it by his great death what he purchased so that means there's rapturing Grace and there's rapturing power I don't think we should be waiting for rapturing Grace it's here I don't think we should be waiting for rapturing power right it's here all that was given at the opening of the seals amen that's all here what do I need I need access to it that's what's catching us up right now yeah that's what's changes from a denomination to the bride that's what when we heard the eagle scream brother B said you Rapture it up quickly to meet it what he says your soul raptured didn't it what happened in the opening of the seal something in me went to a whole another level and now it's changing my body amen it's bringing this body subject to the word until it finally brings it completely subject and changes my atoms let's go to Hebrews 11 now five let's go up a few verses by faith Enoch was translated right how was Enoch translated by faith how was Enoch Changed by faith how was Enoch raptured by Faith by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he please God and without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him how was Enoch translated by the power of God yeah was he translated by Grace yeah by the power of God yes by the will of God yes but what does the scripture say by faith Enoch was translated how did Enoch access Grace the will of God the power of God he accessed it by faith amen and how did he get that faith it was already in him how did it come to manifestation because he walked with God he was walking with the word brother benam he he dramatizes it for us he said he was walking with the word for hundreds of years walking with the word and finally he got so far down the road what was he doing down the road he was walking with the word what is the bride doing she's walking with the word amen and and by that the word the word that he was walking with amen was unlocking the faith that was in him as he was walking with the word and hearing the word it was increasing his faith until he got so far down the road this is what brother Brenham says he got so far down the road and says I think I'll just go on and not go back home this time God all a sudden you say what what was it was it the will of God was it the decision of God was it the power of God the answer is yes but the way brother Brown describes it is when Enoch realized I don't have to go back something un locked inside of him and a faith that said I'm so far down this walk with God that I'm just going to go on and not go back what was it to Enoch it was Faith sometimes we think it's going to be God pulling a big lever chunk and then the atoms are going to change no it's going to be the power of God Amen it's going to be by Grace is that right it's going to be by his will but how is it all going to come into manifestation by faith brother B says in the Rapture message he says but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture now it is a revelation for the Revelation is Faith you cannot have a revelation without a being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation the Rapture is a revelation to her amen how many believe that the Rapture has come that's a revelation to her we're not waiting for the Rapture to come we're waiting for the Rapture to go and the going of the Rapture is another level of revelation will it be will it be by will it be by faith or will it be by the power of God will it be by faith or will it be the will of God will it be by faith or will it be by grace and the answer is yes but it's going to take the mechanism of Faith because faith is the access and the message absolute all the way back in 1962 right at the end of 62 this is December 30th says and I remember when he swept down here in that big light standing Yonder at the bottom of the river 1933 in June when he said as John the Baptist was sent forth and forrun the first coming of Christ I send you with a message to the world to forerun the second coming of Christ and around the world she went when Revival fires had been built for 15 years in nearly every Mountain Divine Healing across the Nations and the power and restoration and now I believe she is ready to strike that final climax Yonder what's he preaching he's preaching right at the end of 1962 what's going to happen the next month the next month he's going to put the sword in his hand and then he's going to send him right back then he's going to get caught up in a constellation of angels and he's going to get sent right back for the opening of the seals what is this climax that's coming it's the opening of the word it's Christ coming to his bride he said now I believe she is ready to strike that final climax Yonder to bring forth a faith that will Rapture the church in the glory amen and she is laying in the messages we are really at the end time we've talked about it and everything but the thing has moved upon us now it's upon us now it's all around us now rapturing Grace is here the power of the Rapture is here what's our access faith and the and the bride goes up word by word why are we coming to church because he's constantly unveiling himself and unveiling himself he's unveiling us to us so that we have the faith to conceive we have the faith to walk into the Promise by the word of God and God is constantly unveiling himself to us you know there's there's no point in worrying about whether you're going to make the Rapture or not because if you're in the Rapture you're going to make the rapture if you've if you've resurrected out of dead denomination and you've been caught up out of Leo DEA and moved into Christ amen don't worry the same faith that took you into that transition is going to change your atom someday and how's it going to come it's going to be a revelation that strikes amen it's going to be the same thing that lifted you out of leoda the same thing that lifted you out of a denominational way and brought you into a bride and brought you into a union with Christ that same thing the faith on the word of God that brought you there is the same thing that's going to bring the culmination of the Rapture in your life and change your Adams you don't have to worry about missing it you can't miss it you are it you're in it it's all around you amen the faith that he's delivering to us is going to match the faith that's in the seed and unlock access to a body chain amen you don't have to worry about missing it you're not going to miss it if God's already placed inside of you something that's been able to make all of these moves how do you think you got here you got here by the faith of God that he's placed down inside of you and when he brought the revelation of the word there was something in you to respond to that Revelation and move out you've left false ideas you've left false Notions you've left selfishness you've left family you've left church Traditions you've left it all and moved into Christ what did that amen how did you access Christ in our day by faith where did you get the Faith from the seed where did you get the seed from God Amen praise God don't worry he that's begun a good work in you he that's begun a good work with you will not cease till he's completed it it's no fear and will I make the message will I will I make the Rapture listen don't let anybody preach that to you you know it could be today you may not make the Rapture amen I made the Rapture before the foundation of the world and the mind of God I already made the rapture nobody's going to preach me in and nobody's going to preach me out it was determined by the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world and he planted something inside my soul to secure my access to the Rapture and that was a part of himself a part of the word that when the word is unveiled this word and that word they come together like magnetism and they unlock a faith inside to reach out and obtain whatever the word is if you've moved thus far you should Rejoice amen there's no fear not going to make it the same thing that brought you here is the same thing that take you all the way oh God is good amen once God unlocks that Revelation he takes fear out of the equation we have nothing to fear oh the future's bright oh the world's getting dark but the future is bright bad things are going on all around but that's the setting for the wonderful things that are transpiring in our day Shalom little bride good morning all is well this is a wonderful day to be alive this is a wonderful day to be on earth yes sir amen we're going to go far beyond far beyond what the church has ever done am amen that's right that right we're we're we're going to an AB absolute change in the body and the moment and the twinkling of an eye when the atoms the very cell structure changes into a glorified body can you fathom it no can you figure it out no do you understand the mechanics of that if you do please come and explain something to me because I have no clue how that's going to happen What will be the circumstances what will it look like what exactly will happen I don't know are you afraid you'll miss it abs absolutely not because there's no chance of me ever making it there's not even a chance of me being saved if he didn't predetermine I'd be saved and if he didn't put something in me to believe with the very fact that I can believe in my salvation I can believe in the change of my adom because it's the very same mechanism that caused me to believe in healing caus me to believe in Salvation is the very same access I'll get to the change of my ad do I need to worry about it no what do I need to do stay in the word hear the word stay under the umbrella of the word and let the word wash away everything that's not there and have it keep unlocking the faith that's on the inside until this this brid tree keeps growing and blooming and producing fruit praise God I don't know about you but I'm happy to be alive I'm happy that this reality is already struck and I'm not worried about what comes next I'm so excited with what's here amen there's no doubt in my mind that what comes next I'm a part of as well it's the same mechanism the same access what gave us access all along will continue to give us access to every promise of God it'll be by faith amen let's all stand that was one statement that brother Eugene made he made a lot of other statements friend we may have a series called post Camp statements oh I don't want to miss what God's given to us I don't want to miss even the weekend that we just had and the tremendous preaching I don't want to just move on to more I want to say Lord what was that you were showing us what was it you wanted us to catch because the preaching of the word is not entertainment the preaching of the word is not so we can go home with an enthusiasm and excitement and the preaching of his word is not so we can go home and pick it apart and criticize it well he forgot that quote and he forgot this quote and he should have taken it from that angle no the preaching of the word is to change us from Glory into glory to bring the word so that so something in us can respond back to that word amen because the bride goes up word by word are you going up do you feel yourself going up amen let's bow our heads and pray as the musicians come dear heavenly father we thank you so much for this this word that you've given to us and God we are overwhelmed Med by your grace we are overwhelmed Lord when there's a world in darkness amen there's absolute complete darkness in the church world that's right Le oia has gone into absolute Darkness complete apostasy but God somehow you gave us eyes to see and ears to hear and you've leted us walk into the brightest light that has ever shined on this Earth and God we are aware we recognize that so few believe so few see oh God I thank you Lord that you've given me eyes to see I could have never done it on my own but it's something you deposited in me and you determined and you purposed by your grace God I'm so thankful God we know there's still things that you're
