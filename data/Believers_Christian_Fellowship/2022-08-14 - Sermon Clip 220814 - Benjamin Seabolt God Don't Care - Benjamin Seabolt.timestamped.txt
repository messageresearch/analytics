[0:00] god did not care about anything else as
[0:03] much as he cared about revelation 5.
[0:06] brother branham says the most sublime
[0:08] portion of scripture in the bible
[0:11] if it's the most sublime portion of
[0:13] scripture in the bible i'm going to
[0:15] venture to say this is what god cares
[0:16] most about
[0:18] and everything else he does not care as
[0:21] much about even though he cares about it
[0:24] he cares saints
[0:26] nobody can leave here this morning and
[0:28] say brother ben told me god don't care
[0:30] i did
[0:32] but i'm telling you he does care
[0:34] about everything
[0:36] but he don't care about everything as
[0:38] much as he cares about revelation 5.
[0:42] revelation 5 verse 6
[0:44] and i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[0:46] throne and of the four beasts in the
[0:48] midst of the elder stood a lamb as it
[0:50] had been slain that's the portion of
[0:51] scripture that we just spent a half an
[0:53] hour on isaiah 53.
[0:57] so when it says as a lamb slain don't
[0:59] take that as just simple oh it was a
[1:01] lamb slain remember isaiah 53.
[1:05] as it had been slain having seven horns
[1:07] and seven eyes which are the seven
[1:08] spirits of god sent forth unto all the
[1:10] earth and he came and he took the book
[1:12] out of the right hand of him that set up
[1:14] on the throne and this is what god cared
[1:17] about
[1:21] this is all that god cared about
[1:25] because within this is the very essence
[1:28] and being an expression and character of
[1:30] god
[1:31] to express himself
[1:33] to have the preeminence
[1:35] and to bring redemption
[1:37] brother branham says
[1:39] all redemption
[1:41] hinged
[1:43] on this lamb taking the book
[1:45] john was weeping
[1:48] doesn't anybody care
[1:50] doesn't anybody care doesn't anybody
[1:52] care
[1:53] but there was one who cared saints
[1:56] more than anything in the world
[1:59] and remember this was not this was not a
[2:02] book saints this was not a book that was
[2:04] in his hand
[2:06] what is in his hand what is written in
[2:08] his hand what did jesus declare is in
[2:10] his hand
[2:12] me and you are in his hand
[2:19] i
[2:20] understand what i say when i say this i
[2:22] could take a lot of verses out of isaiah
[2:24] 53 and make it read this way
[2:27] god sent his only begotten son
[2:30] into the world and they did everything
[2:31] imaginable unto him because he cared
[2:34] about me and you being redeemed
[2:38] that is what isaiah 53 says
[2:42] that is what revelation 5 says
[2:46] because
[2:47] the lamb that was slain
[2:50] the price for the book was a slain lamb
[2:54] remember what we said if you give a
[2:56] price for something that means that that
[2:58] price
[3:00] was you did not care about that price as
[3:02] much as you did about the something
