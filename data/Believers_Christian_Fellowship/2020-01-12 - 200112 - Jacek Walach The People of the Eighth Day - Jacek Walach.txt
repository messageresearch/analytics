the type of the church did you notice that the bride and ella easier found rebecca in the evening time the sign was performed in the evening time that's the time we're living in i trust that you get this it was in the evening time when rebecca came out led by the spirit do you believe that how otherwise would she have come there might have been many before but she was led by the spirit in the evening time and eliezer the messenger the minister the true servant to his master was led in the evening time and the true servant had left his creeds and things behind and it made up his mind that he was going to trust god in the evening time wonder why that rebecca came before any of the other girls did you know that rebecca and isaac was blood relation cousins and the bride of jesus christ is blood relation to him a blood bought bride no wonder she was led by the spirit there was a connection coming together there was a union coming together my days i was doing what i done so many times i heard of someone who lived i was asked if i would go and be his chosen bride i went with his servant it was in the evening time when i heard his servant cry [Music] behold your isaac this man i've brought you to behold there he stands my promise was true and now rebecca my time with you is done [Music] united time [Music] are you in love with this wonderful word of [Music] life a virtuous wife

is there really is the rising of the sun no it was and it will be but is the rising of the sun the veil is raining too and we can see who is here right now what a privilege that the quickening power allows us to to see him in this age god bless you this morning i greet you in the name of lord jesus christ this is truly again the privilege and joy for me to stand here knowing responsibility for every word but trusting him that he is here and takes under control me myself and you and he is present here to deal with our hearts and just say quicken again the word of god word of promise for our hearts and just change us yes because we are looking for the change we know that god promised as a change of the body but the change of the body is the result of many changes in our lives and anytime when the word of god comes and doesn't change us i'm sorry it went over the head but when it comes to your heart and changes you and me this is the purpose of the coming of the world because the world is a different concept than the concept around us so i i really i'm looking for him just to use me for his glory to use uh you for his glory because we are on the same boat we are just on the same boat so god bless you i really enjoyed the song and the song service and the atmosphere that is here i really uh depending on that because i know that all of us as a christians we are creators of the atmosphere if we can just uh create the right kind of atmosphere there is a really great possibility that god will do something for us so i appreciate this atmosphere here your expectation and the fellowship with your pastor his family and the brothers and sisters i met in the meantime it's really really great god bless you all of you i have a little a small testimony and an announcement since many many years we publish uh messages of bradley branham uh in polish language since almost 30 years uh and about a year ago over a year ago the lord placed on our hearts to publish the messages in english language because as we travel we are aware of the shortage of these books and literature maybe not in the united states maybe not in europe but in the dozens and dozens of countries people they don't have books of the prophet to read and just to exercise their faith and to go into the mystery of god so the purpose of this little presentation in a few minutes is if you know some believers in the third world countries in asia or africa that is interested to get the books of the prophet um in english free of charge would be more than glad to send them we are sending the books to more than 20 countries and we publish almost 80 000 books of the prophet last year and we've got a lot of books and we don't want to keep it in our storage we want to just send it to the people but we want to just send it to the right kind of people hungry and they will use it for the glory of god we've got the books like choosing of the bride praise god for the song this afternoon i really appreciate it and uh does god change his mind it's also available we can send it one in a million amen you are one in a million if you are a believer you must be one in a million and god doesn't change his mind about you the same way how he doesn't change his mind about his word amen because the choosing of the bride amen it was his choice and someone was beyond the curtain of time and describes the the you know the dimension eternal dimension and he he was there and he saw you and he came back he said i saw you there so so interesting so interesting beyond the curtain of time amen we're going to this place because we are coming from this place resume of the seven church ages is also available we can send it gladly this is a consummation of all ages resume of all ages we are coming we are leaving the seven and we are coming to eight amen present stage of my ministry why malachi for profit such a vindicated prophet as no one else before with a purifying cloud in the consummation of the ages he was rejected misunderstood why he explained that in the present stage of my ministry jesus was rejected at the end paul was rejected at the end and every true prophet malachi 4 was rejected amen you know that the voice of the sign people are looking for the signs they are looking for the signs but there is a voice behind every true sign this is the message that's what we believe we receive the message which is the result of the signs and wonders in the ministry of malachi 4. god sent us elijah prophet to turn our hearts back to the hearts of the fathers but there's a message behind the sign amen the voice of god the last days amen amen is still the voice of god sounds around the world it was the prophet now he's a bride because the voice of god is in the bride this is the voice of god the last age last days amen how we can know it we have to go into the world there's a revelation unveiling of god not unveiling of man not unveiling of prophet is unveiling of god through a prophet amen satan's eden this is really key to understand why there's such troubles around us why there's such a bad atmosphere it's a nice atmosphere in the church good atmosphere when you do study of your bible you listen the word but there is a sentence in around us we are right in the midst but we are a selected group of people we cannot be deceived there's no way for a bride to be deceived it's just impossible satan's eden and christ is the mystery of god revealed christ the mystery of god revealed amen christ is the mystery of god revealed and the bride she is the mystery of christ revealed amen so we'll be glad just uh having a again possibility to send some new addresses if the people will listen uh streaming or whatever they can just come to about the chat and that's on the only our motive we don't have any organization just to propagate just the message of the hour we are so happy we are so blessed you are so privileged in poland just god open our eyes and we want to do something real for the kingdom of god amen so god bless you i ask you to stand up please my subject is for this morning the people of the eighth day the people of the eighth day is not just a doctrine of the eighth day or the scripture describing the eighth day but they are people of the eighth day amen so let's open the book of leviticus leviticus 23 because book of leviticus 23 from verse 33 33 and 34 is kind of background 4 and 35 background for the 36. let's read it and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel saying the 15th day of the seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the lord we know the feel of the feast of tabernacles was the seventh feast in a seven month tishri it was a consummation of the whole religious year for jews and we know the fifth um feast was the feast of uh trumpets for ten days calling the people for the feast of yom kippur feast of atonement the the sixth feast and the seventh feast the feast of tabernacle was the last one and the last three feasts uh in the seven month history was connected with the second part of the year after the drought it was a harvest time the second harvest in the year and i we don't have a time to go into the details of the all seven church ages but we want to be focused on the seventh one uh but this is only background because the seven one is leading uh to the eighth day and just to understand those things we know that the first four uh feast in the bible jewish feast was connected with the first coming of the lord and the last three ephes in the seventh month was connected to the second coming of the lord but we will we will skip many things i'm sure that you are taught those things here and the those things will be familiar for you but let's go on and uh uh 35 the bible says on the first day shall be a holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord on the eighth day so seven feasts but on the eighth day of the seventh feast shall be a holy convocation unto you and you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord it's a solemn assembly and you shall do no servile work therein amen no work no struggling no human efforts in the first day and the eighth day it was a very special day of the rest but there was a holy convocation people they have to come together recognize you know there is a feast that god ordained for them and the book of ephesians book of ephesians chapter one book of ephesians chapter 1 from the verse 6. to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to their riches of his grace so the problem of your sin is over because you are accepted in the beloved one and redemption came through his blood redemption your redemption and the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace his grace is so rich even this morning so rich the problem of your sin is over but there is a sort of full redemption full restoration on your original position that you had before you sin had abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ amen the change of dispensation coming to the fullness fullness of times the final dispensation of the fullness of times this is the result of the redemption perfect redemption by christ by his blood let's borrow a headway of prayer precious heavenly father once again we deem this as a wonderful privilege to be in your presence there's no better place this morning than to be here because we are gathered here in thy name the name that is above every name oh god we know that every door is open everything is available all things are possible in thy name lord jesus we invite you just let me myself to put myself aside oh god this is the greatest gift father i don't want to be a visible i don't want to be in the midst oh god i ask for the same for my brothers and my sisters may all of us or father to recognize you are the center you are the main theme you are the main purpose you are the main uh center of the whole bible father let us to see you let has to be focused on you let us recognize this morning better than ever before our position in christ because this is the result and the purpose of your redemption to let us know who we are father bless your people here every knee that is here we know there's a boundaries of your grace you know there's abundance of your riches in glory but you shared your glory with your people father you shared your glory with your wife with the bride we are connected together when we ask you for mercy but you will just provide a mercy for every sick person every person in need of god maybe someone doesn't know you in the power of a resurrection there is a power of deliverance there is a power of redemption by your blood oh god there is a power in the revelation of the rapture the quickening power in the last day the new day new beginning of father bless us we ask for that may everything will be for thy glory we ask for that in the precious name of lord jesus christ amen god bless you take your seeds amen so definitely we are living in time definitely we are surrounded by time definitely just we are linked with many things around us on daily basis that uh we cannot deny that we are living in flesh we cannot deny that we are human beings we cannot deny that we are living in time that we cannot deny there is the beginning of this meeting there is the end of the meeting we cannot deny that soon there will be a lunch time soon you will talk with someone you are thinking about to meet someone we are living in time we are time beings but this is a part of the truth because it would be a whole truth entire truth wouldn't be really a reason to come together here there is a mystery in the bible there is a mystery even uh beyond the redemption beyond the uh you know that his holy blood that was for you and me how we are living for uh for years in sin we've been bound by sin bound by circumstances bound by human thoughts and the feelings and the things it was like a prison but he redeemed us from our prison because his sacrifice was so perfect but it was not the end of the story when his blood was shed it was the beginning of the new story because we've been so veiled by tradition of so many years that we could just confess i believe in the blood i believe in jesus i believe he died for me but we saw very by tradition of christianity that the results of the word of god and the results of the shed blood didn't come even to us unless the veil was ranked in two and you saw that different picture you saw the reality of the redemption you saw the results of the blood of jesus christ because we know the chemistry of the blood cannot be proved today no one have it but we know that as a christian we've got the excess of life that was in the blood the chemistry of the blood of jesus christ was broken yes two thousand years ago but their life was released we've got access to life this is a different story than having a sandals or nails of the piece of the cross that jesus hung all the tradition blind the people so there is many many issues that uh in our life uh that we are dealing with but soon it will be uh finished many things will abolished uh disappear completely and it's like the week when we are living usually is from one to seven we know that uh this is uh earthly order this is even the order it got established from one to seven but i want to just talk about the eighth day and people of the eighth day that there is a day that represents the eternity we know the number eight is so simple you know that exactly but just to remind you you know that all the old order from one to seven is always the beginning and the end with every every number always the beginning and the end from one to seven all the time you go the beginning and the end and the end always like this but we are coming to the number of eight there's no beginning no end we know that exactly but this is really type in the bible but we want to see the reality god promised us not only symbols and types symbols in the bible are right because they are placed there by god through the prophets but we know that we need to get the understanding of of of the meaning of the symbol and then the revelation strikes your heart then the bible becomes a new book then you are not a traditional nominal christian but are a true believer but the symbol must be broken for you must be an interpretation understanding only by the holy ghost not by a man the bible is not written by a man is written through a man by god so god is the only one that is able to give you understanding real understanding of the word of god all the symbols all the shadows amen so we know that from one to seven is just the old order and we are physically still in that order we are living in the seven church h this is a physical uh final audition hh there is no eighth church h because with the seven is over this is a physical realm from one to seven seven church ages seven weeks or seven days in the week and but we know that the eight cannot be counted with the week see it cannot be counted eight days in a week there is no something like that you can do it because there is only seven days in a week count it any way you want to sunday is the first day of the week amen sunday first day of the new week new order this is the eighth day amen and we know the sunday the eighth day it was exactly you know god's show it in the bible we know that people like david just shortly touching only david david was the eighth son in the family you know that when the prophet samuel came to to find the king for israel he was looking and himself he was impressed by one he was impressed by the first one so he said probably this is the the biggest the tallest you know representation is the best he is the person god said no don't put the oil upon the first one so then he looked around you know and he found the second one you know this is a human thoughts that's how we are operating that's how we understand we we try the best we we've got our intellect and we are choosing the best not the worst you're choosing the best you are coming to church like this at the morning you don't take the the old clothes you choose the best because if the lord gave you something good you take the best coming here amen you don't take kind of rocks upon yourself with the like a sister will not just take a uh too short uh a skirt no you you you know that it will not please the lord you will grieve the holy spirit you take the best amen and also you don't want to live a double life you don't want to just clothing properly in the church and not properly outside of the church this is a double standard double life it doesn't work so we understand why we have to just catch really the vision of reality something that will be in us going together with god and that's how david he you know when he was there he was not even considered at the beginning because he was not part of the original group of the seven ones we know that so not the second not the third not the fifth and sixth and the seven and you know the prophet was looking around and god said even the seventh one is not the one i'm going to anoint so then he asked isai where is is there any more sans amen yes there is the eighth one but we didn't consider the eighth one the eight one is among the sheep he is a shepherd call him when he came from the wilderness he was alone privately he was with god he was a spiritual man writing the psalms and talking with god and he was a shepherd and you know he found the grace in the sight of god from the beginning only people they didn't recognize that that he was in the midst from the beginning he was a real shepherd real king but the people they couldn't comprehend it because he was not even over there when he came the eighth one david the eighth one god such a prophet annoyed him amen and all this wonder is from the beginning the part of the family that was not recognized is the one the eighth one david typing jesus christ amen noah in the bible noise called in the bible noah the eighth person amen noah the eighth person eight is an eternity no i was a man like you and me subject to the failures and different things but he was the eighth person it means he was coming from eternity and he was going back to eternity because number eight means eternity david was coming from god he had to come back to god doesn't matter how many failures he did he was predestinated person that's the reason number eight deals with a predestination for knowledge jesus he was the eighth person jesus we know he was resurrected not in the day of sabbath the seventh day but when the week was accomplished he was resurrected on the eighth day on sunday morning hallelujah jesus was the eighth day person he himself he said i came from the father i'm coming back to my father it was his identity amen you understand that when jesus was on the earth first time you've been in him i was in him not yet expressed but we've been in him when he said i came from the father i came back to the father it was your voice in those days when he said you said when he got quiet you kept quiet whatever he did you did amen in those days the first coming of the lord we've been silent because we've been hidden in him but the bridegroom was your voice christ was your voice we've been hitting him we didn't have our own voice we passed by our theophany we didn't know who we are we've been hitting him but he was our voice but today he is hidden jesus he said the world will not see me anymore you will see me because i will be with you even in you to the end of the world today people that are looking for jesus they cannot see him because he is hidden in his bride 2 000 years ago he was your voice today you are his voice the bride of christ god promise she will be the final voice for the final age under her messenger amen so if he was the eighth person jesus eternal jesus we've been in him and now we are recognized so we can see the number eight it deals with eternity you understand that when i was preaching seven seals uh 24th of march 1963 when he was was sunday 24th of march sunday and the morning was the questions and answers on seals people they could express brother he asked just please just stay with that kind of questions connected with this people always they've got a different kind of questions even this morning maybe you've got a different question not connected with that but god had at his own root his own journey and 24th of march 1963 on sunday and the morning was a question answers on seals but sunday evening was a seventh seal it was not the seventh day it was the eighth day it was on sunday evening the evening time the eighth day was already presented and then the seventh seal from revelation eight 1 was open the bible says in revelation 8 1 it was open the silent was in heaven but not on the earth because the seven thunders of their voices brother he said the seven thunders they don't utter their voices in heaven they are today voices on the earth amen when god and the man can come together as a result of redemption and people are coming to understanding we are not just human beings we are human beings but we are not just human beings you are more than a man you are more than women you are more than child more than teenager you are not a typical teenager you are more a teenager if you can recognize who you are all the battle today is around to recognize who i am not by the physical abilities not my mental understanding by my personal revelation of jesus christ to you god when he is able to take you from the seventh day of or maybe fifth day the fifth church age lutherans just justification this is right in the bible we believe it but you have to move on from the fifth day to the sixth day sanctification john wesley this is important we believe it but we have to just move on to the seventh day the seven days the baptism of the holy spirit this is part of the bible god promised that amen seven church h seventh day pentecostals this is all right but you have to move on there is more than these the seven series open showing the whole concept that was hidden in the mind of god before the foundation of the world mystery of god how god wanted to put together what was in heaven with what was on the earth in him in christ in the world in the revelation of the world in the living bible living book amen and you recognize this is not just the information that's me brother that's me my name is in the book the promises the verses in the bible that's me that's the reason why i listen a minister on the anointing of the holy spirit i'm gonna announce the eagle anointing he's preaching the mystery something jump up in my heart because that's me that's me this verse that's me the prophecy is me i understand my journey through all these days i can describe you when i was the first day on the second day third day but now i'm coming to something that i never even imagined will be available for me but the seventh seal was opened in revelation 8 1. it was a silence in heaven for a space of about half hour maybe 28 minutes of silence who was silent angels amen not human beings because we recognize we dealt last wednesday with the seventh unwritten song of solomon that was not written by him he overlooked it he had to do it he was a human being but when the great and the solomon came jesus christ he was great and the solomon was not just a gift of wisdom it was a spirit of wisdom and revelation and the spirit of wisdom and revelation cannot fail but the gift can fail and the seventh song of solomon unwritten one was sung in revelation 5. that's what we are talking last time about amen so there was a silence from the side of angels they didn't understand what was going on but something happened it was not a heaven group it was a bride amen brides group amen hallelujah so we are human beings yes but you are made for an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in god amen the thought of you and express you so he thought about you express you a certain age maybe your forefathers in the past but now express us because we have been his attribute and expressed us in that age to live under the messenger of that age to recognize the word of that age to manifest god for the dying people around us in that age but you are made for the eternal purpose remember that and the eternal purpose the eternity is eight eternal purpose must be eight number eight revelation eternity and he made a earth to take you out of and to make you a human being amen future home future home he made the earth for the purpose he made the earth to take you out of the earth hallelujah the purpose was not the earth the purpose was to create make the earth and take you out of the earth in the united states or or ukraine or china or congo or poland or czech republic or whatever this is the purpose why he placed us there amen to recognize one day that even when he made the globe you know and he just made my flesh out of the ground that's not me because i existed before you existed before he made the earth to just extract the portion of the of the minerals and he created a body but he placed you into the body you that existed before your body this is really connection with the egg day we have to understand we are coming from eternity we are coming back to eternity as jesus was we are in this world as he was we are equal why this is a power and the result of redemption not because i'm holding myself not because i'm perfect myself but i'm reside of his perfection i am just reside of his perfect sacrifice you are resolved outcome hallelujah praise god you know maybe you know the story maybe you heard it but there's a story about the little boy let's say a teenager he was a teenager and he dreamed to have a boat his own boat and one day he designed the boat in his mind and put it on the paper and then he collected materials and just made his own both it was a size like that he really enjoyed he put himself into that let's say he he reflected himself in the boat he loved it so much because no one just told him just do it like this or like that it was his own concept that he put it to the piece of the wood so every day after the school of course of course not during the school but after the school he was going to the lake and he was just playing with this boat and he really he really enjoyed to see how he's working what was in his mind he made it and he was working but after a certain time you know there was a strong wind like i i found it in the ohio you've got a strong winds like in poland uh so the strong wind came and blow the boat away so the boy he was really really crying he was really in desperation because part of his life his dream and everything was in the boat so some some weeks passed you know and he was going through his town you know and he looked there was a pawn shop and he looked through the glass and he looked and he saw his own boat he saw it again he thought his laws but it was there so he just rushed inside and he said to the salesman this is mine this is mine he said i'm sorry this is mine so he was a double despairer because he was looking at this and he couldn't just get it so he got the price he uh you know understood the price you know it was quite high it was a really really extraordinary vote so he just said he went very very discouraged to his home but the certain idea came to him just you i will take all things i have my bicycle my my my my toys my whatever instrument the tools whatever little things you know i will just sell it collect the money and go to a punk shop and try to redeem my boat that's what he did he collect the money he went there and he paid for the boat second time when he took the boat he was so excited he was so happy he just just ran out from the punk shop and he shouted you are mine you are man you are double mine because i made you and i redeem you you are double mine amen this is even greater now the feeling i have because i made you i lost you for a while but now i redeem you you are double mine my friends if you believe in the lord jesus christ as a reality i tell you if you receive the word the way it was presented for us in that age revelation must track your heart your double mine this is the voice of god today your double mind double mind i made you i redeem you you are double mine [Applause] devil never had the right to you but for a while it seems like in the order of the one to seven you can be up and down up and down you can be just too late you can be too early you can just miss the the the the train you can miss your job you can miss your even a marriage you can miss you can miss different things you can you can miss to be not to be millionaire doesn't matter what you mean from the one to seven but don't miss the revelation of the eighth day [Applause] don't misunderstanding that you are coming from eternity and jesus he became sin giving revelation that now you can become him by accepting his own righteousness righteousness of the eighth day that god himself not the man he paid the price for you he took a stand for you not the man jesus no was not the man he was more than man he was god in flesh he paid the price amen and he introduced after his crucifixion burial and resurrection he introduced a new order [Applause] new order order of melchizedek order of the eighth day order of eternity because he was rise up on the eighth day sunday morning a day outside of the old order understand that you love it oh brother and sister this is a great revelation why he placed you united states why he plays me in poland why he plays someone else in in china whatever it was his decision he made the earth around you know for that purpose amen to manifest some of us we are white some of them we are black some of them we are red or or yellow whatever it doesn't matter it's for the purpose god designed you amen he lost us for a while but now we are double he's hallelujah the book of colossians book of colossians chapter 3 first four verses just to see if the poll he taught us to walk in the new concept because if jesus he was resurrected on the eighth day so it means that we've been resurrected with him on the eighth day if jesus was the eighth person if noah was the eighth person as a shadow in the old testament david was the eighth person as a shadow in the old testament jesus was not any shadow he was a reality when he was resurrected not on the seventh but on the eighth day we've been in him and paul he caught the revelation he caught understanding and he says book of colossians chapter three from the first one if you then be rised or risen i'm sorry if you then be risen with christ seek those things which are above if you are risen with christ if you are a person of the eighth day look up look for the things from above when a christ sitteth on the right hand of god you will say brother i don't understand exactly let's let's let's think like let's move now quickly in the history to the dark ages when our brothers and our sisters they were killed murdered by lions you know they had chopped off suffering alone not having a you know nice chair not having three meals or five meals or whatever is your diet or no meals they were really suffering really suffering no hope no joy nothing around you understand that nothing to touch and get a little consolation separated from mom separation from dead children separated from the parents parents from children they are separated from the pastor separated from the church killed summer caught killed tortured what do you think what you read right now was a cancellation for them or not question is maybe we don't understand having so many things that we can touch if you are sick you call to doctor okay if your car doesn't run you just you you don't lay hands on you on your car and pray because you've got the money in the pocket you go to the garage to repair it so our concept is completely different if i i've got a problem on friday and i'm the depths i've got a credit card what's the problem what's the problem more debts more debts you know this is the old concept this is wrong all those things around this this concept is wrong amen we use many things but we have to be prepared and trained because the seven number seven the seventh church h is the worst one of all seven it's allowed this yeah church h it's a wrong concept the people they follow especially the churches and so-called christians because we know that all the seven church ages east was the letters for christians so god rejected completely this concept even spewed out it was so bad and so wrong the seventh one is so corrupted but you know there are if we would be in such a conditions desperate in need you'd be so thankful to understand that you can accept the things from above there's reality above today they would say oh this is a spiritualism or whatever just why you think like that you're crazy yes i'm crazy yes i'm crazy for the for this world seek those things which are above where christ sitted on the right hand of god hallelujah the above things are real not what i taste touch see smell is not a reality reality is coming from above set your affections on the things above not on the things on the earth amen hallelujah can we do that france this morning put our affections on the things from above not those things that passes away earthly timely limited for you are dead amen and your life is hid with christ in god can you say amen when christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory amen in glory that's what the paul he called the revelation he taught romans in eighth chapter he said oh let go god foresaw and those that even saw before the foundation of the world he has chosen he predestinated them he called them he justified them he glorified them in the past tense we can dispute with this but it's not my problem it's not your problem it's a problem the people with the bible they don't accept the bible as a new book as a reality as christ that came down amen to be united with his bride this is a new age this is a you know the new age of the of the of the old age is a new age this is a new mystery that was hidden in the bible uniting time and sign when the christ the bride that well [Applause] every scripture in the bible every prophecy depicts jesus christ but you cannot stop with this you have to see christ in every verse of that bible every verse but then don't put a full stop continue have a fellowship with him don't be afraid of him don't be afraid of the world don't be afraid of the message don't be afraid of the eagles anointing that is leading you to a throne to the reality of god be open discover that you can have a relationship not with a doctrine with a person we've got relationship today with that person of the lord jesus christ and then he will find the grace in his side then he will lead you deeper because you will not see only christ in every verse of the bible you will see also yourself in every verse of the bible and then the perfect faith rapture in faith is rising up your heart supernatural element something not from this earth every theologian can study every day i don't know how many hours but it comes by grace and abundance of grace it comes by his sovereign choice that he has chosen us before the foundation of the world in himself no one was able to steer up stir up his feeling or his decision or his love it was his own love towards the bride he's chosen you in himself privately it was his decision that's the reason no one can stop it if you have been in god and chosen in god no one is able to stop it there's no demons no darkness power nothing no negative no complex nothing not your breakdown no whatever nothing can stop you for the love of god because you've been chosen in love before the foundation of the world amen so the paul he's teaching those things and he said for you are dead and your life is healed with christ in god when christ who is our life shall appear we are living in the time of appearing of the son of man he christ himself he appeared amen he tear the sky scientists not the believers not will scientists prove this was real who can question that tell me inside person that's all right this is reality it was real it was tested from every angle amen now after years they can say whatever they want with an insane condition [Music] like a pharisee is a sad disease when they rejected jesus christ nothing happened directly but 40 years later they paid for every word they spoke against it amen you can say something against the son of man but when he appears himself christ the holy ghost amen he's so gracious for us friends when he shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory it doesn't mean you'll be a glorious angel like that no no but you'll appear in glory you'll have access to glory the bride she's his glory because the woman the wife she's the glory of the husband and he was revealed you've been revealed that's the reason how can bridegroom come and wouldn't be the bride it's a bright coming of christ when he was manifested wherever is christ i am i'm identified hallelujah we've been there two days ago on the ohio river in the place in 19 in 1933 the lord came down you know the pit of fire and the voice came as the john the baptist was sent before the first coming of the lord your message before around the second coming of the lord i was just happy not in my emotions but in my inner being i said about the child and by the nathan i said i'm here the second time when a commission the great commission was spoken i was there because the pit of fire the logos is the fullness of god's attributes [Applause] fullness of god's attributes moses jeremiah paul amen all of them you and me we've been part of a pit of fire but everyone was expressed in his own age so in 1933 we've been there not yet expressed in the flesh now is a greater time wonderful time you've been a thought attribute of god in the period of fire but now it's a greater time because the thought of god is expressed you've been spoken to existence by the powder spoken word that's the reason god sent the monarchy for prophet he spoke the word he said it was not me god only use my vocal vocal chords my vocal cords but it was he himself was standing inside of me he was using my voice but it was himself revelation of the seals is not a revelation of so-so message kind of message he was a revelation of christ christ he put off seals of himself when he was unveiled you've been unveiled because you are identified with him paul he said you are dead you are dead and your life is hit with christ in god wherever christ is manifest revealed you are there you are there this is our identification this is our unity with him that we know wherever he is i am as he is as he is in this world we are amen the bible says as he is i am that i am not i was i i will be i am the eighth day eternity in flesh as he is as jesus is in this world that's what john said the eagle eagle's anointing reveals that he said as jesus is in this world we are amen he was the word 2000 years ago we are the living word today that's what the paul he taught we are the open book we are the open book people can read they supposed to read the word am i right we're supposed to live a life his own life nothing less amen when christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory amen we are identified recognized in him hallelujah do you love him you know that jesus he he said verily verily i say unto you let's open this this is not my language i want to be sure saint john chapter 5 24. it's important but it's also wonderful saint john chapter 5 24. verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believe it on him that sent me hath at everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death and to life we can believe it or not but if he is zoe zoe life we are so alive as well because by accepting his word revelation of his word by accepting him himself in the fullness of his word you will not go to condemnation you will not go to tribulation period you pass from death and to life you've got the life literal life of god right now right now the eighth day you pass from the seventh day to eight day amen from the old order the new order amen from the order of levites one to seven to the order of melchizedek he was without the father without the mother without the beginning without the end amen like a circle without the father without the mother we are the beginning we have the end hallelujah and he's got the children mercy without the father without the mother without the beginning without the end of the days and he's got the children amen we are his children we are the children of melchizedek amen we've got the beginning and the end of this earthly journey but inside of you there is an eternal being and you pass from death unto life there is no condemnation for the bride there is definitely condemnation for the seventh h but there is no condemnation for the people of the eighth day because amen is coming so many things when the seven was over there was a revelation for one come up higher john come up higher and he found himself in the rapture in the eternity after seven church ages he was lifted up raptured amen and he saw someone he saw someone amen when he was in the spirit hallelujah can you see you understand that we can only explain everything we don't want to even do it but just we are touching here and there in the world different places and the holy spirit is here to put it together just to to give you a clear-cut picture that you will not live under condemnation of the seventh-day condemnation of the laodicea we are in a different time we pass from the death to life he is zoe life we are so alive because we are coming from him and coming back to him amen future home amen we lived through all these types in here but when you hit the eight you go on into eternity but now he describes you know that all this seven and different uh you know sabbats and full moons and different things you know it was all connected with time but he said we just we we passed when you hit the eight you go on into eternity okay you you think that maybe this future brother this future you understand i'm hungry you understand i i feel pain it has nothing to do with this because your inner being is is eternal god's attribute expressed in flesh in your flesh my flesh and flesh has nothing to do this is part of the earth it is a dying it is it can be a this or that shape you know troubles up and down but you are more than the flesh when you hit the age you go on into eternity you don't come by laws and rituals and orders you come by predestination you come by predestination amen there is a genuine holy convocation see and we are ending the seventh church age we the people not the doctrine not the kind of teaching but we are ending the seventh church age are you with me are you able you are willing to end the worst one we are ending the seventh church age the pentecostal age we are ending we are finishing why because we recognize i'm not any more part of it if my jesus the word was rejected only in the seventh church edge he was kicked out from the church he was kicked out and now going beyond the camp i'm identified with him i'm going with him from the seven to the eight he is misunderstood i am misunderstood that's obvious whoa whoa unto us ministers if everyone will talk nicely about us whoa whoa unto you christian if everyone is speaking nicely about you some of them they will speak nicely god bless them some of them they will be nasty god bless them anyhow but play your role don't be wishy-washy don't be compromising be christian don't be afraid don't be discouraged i criticize you friends this is part of life wait a little don't worry we are ending the seven church age pentecostal age we are entering the holy convocation we are entering into the real genuine eternity where the church is cult you understand that this is a present tense let's carefully listen watch yourself what the time you're living right now the pentecostal church age is over for the bride of christ because we pass on the seventh to the eighth holy convocation we are entering into the real genuine eternity where the church is called not to some station some denomination but into eternity with day eternal king amen we are not alone we are entering to the eternal kingdom with our eternal king our husband we are one uniting time and sign in this evil euro of the bride of christ amen the token literal life of christ christ the mystery of god revealed pride is a mystery of christ revealed amen we are the prisoners of christ prisoners of love amen what the hourly right now praise god the rapture and the things that are to be but he said i would like to connect it together rapture is a revelation for the bride revelation not only event this is revelation we're supposed to be under revelation of the rapture he's supposed to move all in our hearts how you know how you know that the rapture is not going on all the time how do you know you know by revelation amen but god is hiding and revealing himself in simplicity showing the passage from the seventh to the eighth how you know that the rapture is not going on all the time this is a different dimension it's a circle all the time eternity you are part of it or not amen we are living in the seventh i call the flesh there is the feast of tabernacles we are observing right now feast of tabernacles amen that's for the church we've been the time for thousand years in a feast of tabernacles still a time we've got to steal the thousand years of time ahead of us but god not by accident he put the seventh together with the eight and he didn't introduce the eighth feast but the seven feasts but he said when the seventh feast after seven days will be finished he will come to the eighth day the seventh and the eighties coming together this is just a breach you are living something and going into something and this is the biggest challenge because the christian tradition tradition of the pentecostal church age is so heavy on people but by the grace of god eternal king is here king god king jesus king theophany king theophany amen he came down as a thief in the night to be connected with you do you love him hallelujah you are in eternity with eternal king not a station no denomination we came to reality like a projectile son we came to ourselves we just discovered something from the another dimension we are discovering something doesn't matter what kind of education you have what kind of background you have you are wealthy or poor or or or beautiful or not beautiful doesn't matter it doesn't matter this is this is the level when the devil tries to distract us but he will just recognize the eternal king made me part of eternal kingdom and i am his kingdom i am the place of his rest he came down to be identified with me and he's calling me out of the seventh to the eighth and he teaches me how to walk in the conscious of the being the eighth person amen hallelujah eight days deals with the new creation amen see not old creation eight days is new creation who is really a christ jesus is a new creation what kind of creation i lift up my hand i joined to the church this church other church no i am creation of the world amen god thought spoke i'm here and i believe the world i believe the bible i love the world i love to feed my soul with the living word of god because i'm coming from the eighth day and i know that soon i will go back to a day [Applause] lord just by purpose he dropped me into the time but i'm not the creature of time that's the reason we can have two voices paul he said the flesh is fighting against the spirit the spirit against the flesh that's really what i'm talking about the flesh we tell you always you are just early bound sober you'll never get out of the problem you will never get out of the sin you will never just overcome it yes you did it already in jesus christ you did it already what you need is your personal revelation that you are free [Music] you just want to pray you have to pray right now in your heart quietly lord help me amen let me see myself in the eighth day even if i i will troubles in my seventh day in the laodicea church age let me see something more since he will lift you up higher you will see what the john he saw what he saw in the revelation 4 1 after seven in the eighth in eternity he saw someone on the throne but you will see jesus christ on the throne on your life your heart your problem doesn't matter what it is it's over your sickness is over because you know that your sickness is timely your complex is timely everything is timely depth timely i don't know what what what next is timely but you will see the vision of christ himself sitting on the throne this is the eighth day hallelujah jesus rise from the dead for our justification on the eighth day we know that after the seven sabbaths or seven days seven church ages jesus rised from the dead amen again i know it's blowing the minds of the people easily how can jesus be resurrected again he's resurrected in the form of the bride because a seed was planted two thousand years ago and jesus he said if the seed will just say by one seed just uh and you will never die stay one seed it was christ christ was the word the seed the wheat there's the reason the gentiles the greeks they couldn't see him but he said one day you will see it when the the the sea will be put to the ground and the dark ages will come and it got rotten and and and redestroyed by the germ the mystery the germ in the seed stays doesn't matter how the church was weak in the seven church ages in the dark ages through luther wesley pentacostas up and now is the time of reproduction complete seed is again on the on the earth does the reason jesus christ rise up from the dead in the form of the bride amen you understand that the church is standing right the side of him amen the bride the bridegroom in the marriage union hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah jesus rise from the dead how can bright room come and wouldn't be the bride it's the brightest coming of christ friends brother branham he called it even eternal age bright's age new age we are still in the bible we are still in the bible we still preach from the bible if we still preach from the open book nothing can stand against it because this is a living word in flesh again amen people around us they know it what the grace that was given to you not to be just a witness but to be eyewitness not only watch the word of god manifest in that age but be part of it by the marriage being part of it when you left the seventh when you left the laodicea when you left the position of vashti you came to the position of esther in the eighth day amen marriage you know your partner your husband your wife is eternal partner in glory am i right amen so jesus christ is our eternal partner in glory we are his eternal partners in glory amen this is our victory friends because the world around us is so deceived so corrupted but we've got something not from here not from the seven church ages not from the seven messengers there's a mighty one came down we've got something directly from the headquarter hallelujah amen the first episode of john i will finish soon but by the chat he told me this is sunday one meeting and he just doesn't preach uh shorter than two hours i don't have no concept you know what's the hour because my clock is polish time i don't know i can see a clock over there but i cannot see very well just a little time please a little time just to finish first epistle of john chapter 3 from verse 14 first epistle of john chapter 3 from verse 14 amen we know that we have passed from death and to life we know we know you know the paul he was a hebrew and you know new testament is in greek old testament is in hebrew we know there is a difference between uh to know in the old testament to say i know being a hebrew and i know being greek because for uh greek to know something is just a knowledge but for a hebrew to know something it's experience that's the reason the bible says when the adam he he known known if okay so it's even is going to the personal intercourse it's really really genuine to know and when the when the john when john he was he was hebrew as well and the bible the new testament was in greek but i believe he understood what he said john he said we know that we have passed from death and to life we know we know by personal experience we experience that what it means to have a zoey life inside we understand that jesus that we walk with is walking in us right now we understand that he was above us one god with us one god and he's in us one god they understood constant condescending of god we know we passed from death unto life because we love the brethren he that loveth he that loved not his brother abided in death whosoever hated his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer had eternal life abiding in him amen so now he's just showing you know how god's life can be in us it must be love of god because eternal life is the holy spirit holy spirit is a capstone capstone is a christ himself holy ghost and christ the same person if he is in us he must do exactly the same what he was doing before what he was doing when he was on the cross in the third pool of his ministry there was a signs wonders prophecy and the third part of his ministry what jesus was doing on the cross he said father forgive them what about stephen stephen was not jesus but jesus was in stephen when jesus was when stephen was accused in the book of acts that he trespassed law and telling evil things against moses and so forth you know he was doing uh signs and wonders bible says he was discerning the condition by prophecy but the third pool of his ministry when astonishing stephen what he was doing steven was not jesus but jesus the holy spirit was in stephen how we know it because when he was stoned he prayed for the enemies and the heaven was open it was a third pool of his ministry he was not the preacher he was he was a deacon amen he was not jesus but jesus was in stephen and jesus in the form of the holy ghost the same one that was above with now was he stephen what he was doing was praying for the enemies why the capstone christ not yet completely unveiled like we've got today was in him but a character must be the same jesus was he blessed the enemies what the stephen did he did the same by the spirit that was living in him that's the reason john he said we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love brothers amen amen we love brothers we laugh even those that don't love us because this is a condition for adoption jesus he said that how you can be considered as a son of as a son of god and the spirit adoption will be upon you he will not just if you will greet only the brothers we greet the brothers and we we we greet also the enemies if we cannot do it we say lord jesus help us help us help me to live a life like that help me not to be you know limited by by my own conscious my own thinking understanding but let me take something from the eighth day like jesus did on the calvary he knew exactly who he was he he knew exactly it must be this way that's the reason he prayed for the enemies stephen he knew that he must be this way because the paul was a part of the group he knew that if i would be stoned i would be faithful to the end he saw jesus he saw heaven open and he blessed those people and he prayed for them and the paul was there but he said since this moment paul he couldn't sleep he couldn't just live a normal life he was so much against the church but you know really the death of stephen troubled him and this is really like this when jesus was crucified devil he thought oh it's over we know that if he would have a concept why jesus died he would just protect him and never just allow him to come to the cross because when jesus was crucified with the first shot was 120 rise up with the same spirit it was a really trouble for the kingdom of satan there was a three thousand five thousand what about stephen you cannot you can stop messenger you cannot stop the spirit in the messenger you cannot stop the message when the pharisees sadducees they stoned stephen they thought it's over such a bad evil doctrine heresy we stop it we kill the guy it was like the biggest mistake because instead of stephen paul rise up [Applause] amen whatever devil does is losing always never think never think that you are losing you cannot lose if you see heaven open you have a spirit of god spirit of christ in you if you know that you pass from death unto life you love your brothers you love your enemies you are not losing you cannot do that you are winning you will see amen when the devil will deceive one minister just one minister you know instead of this minister rise up the other ministers the real ones amen because god promised that the bride the last day she will be without the spot without a wrinkle should be perfect so whatever was in the one to seven doesn't matter how many impersonations existed will be a bride amen nothing can stop us friends be brave have revelation be thankful don't be discouraged eternity is like a ring you can't find no corner to eat you can't find no stopping place in the perfect circle you go on and on why not to start right now why not to to identify myself my my way of believing my confession my my my tongue my my expression my song with eternity because it's it's going on all the time i don't care how far you go you are still going you can start going around like this go through the floor go through the earth go beyond the earth you are still going this is just that you recognize i am part of the eighth day i am the eighth person i am part of the eighth group amen praise god hallelujah but the problem is uh the problem is that we are living the time of the different opinions and the people are standing between the two opinions and if you stand too long between the two opinions it causes troubles you know because the standing between the two opinions is a similar to you heard maybe about the bully dance donkey who heard about the bulldogs donkey they are from my church okay okay you can go to wikipedia you can find it bury dance bury dance donkey it was a donkey donkey that was standing in the middle there was a two uh box of the hay on the right side and the left side food on the right side and left side you never heard it how it's possible okay you are more practical in the states i know that you don't go to school too often just too long i'm sorry too long they are very practical people okay i'll explain try to do that quickly but you can find the wikipedia easily okay so there's a donkey between standing and just on the right side is a hay and on the left side the hay in the same uh the same uh length this the same uh yeah so close you know and the donkey is looking on the right looking on the left looking on the right and on the left and doesn't know how to take decision because both sides are enough tempting for him to get it but you know it's if one will be closer you just take a bite of this and later take a bite of this but because the two of them they are enough close to the bullet dance donkey you know he's standing between and doesn't know what to do only looking like this looking like this looking like this and cannot take decision finally after a certain time you know the the the decision there is a power decision but you can reverse it and it overwhelms you and finally the bully dance donkey losing strength and dying after some days dying having excessive food but he is not able to take decision sometimes people they are standing between the two they say okay the seven one there's also something in the seven one there's also somebody eight one i don't know really what to do take from the seventh church h or maybe from the new church h or just uh eight h i don't know what to do standing between the two opinions taking from here or taking from here no i don't know some of them they say it's better from here some of them they say better from here so i'm standing i don't know i'm looking here i'm looking here i'm looking here i'm looking here i'm dying here don't play a bury dance donkey position amen take decision amen there's a power of decision you will take the right kind of decision you will take stand for the world you will win absolutely because we are already in christ we only just play something that was already made in his mind before the foundation of the world and he has chosen you in christ jesus before the foundation of the world and he has chosen you to live in that age when he is going to unite together what is in heaven what is on the earth together when it will happen in the fullness of dispensation when the fullness of times has come and the dispensation of the change from the seventh the eighth you are ready to receive it you say lord jesus is going beyond my understanding but i believe your word i believe those things because that's in the bible the scripture from the old testament to the new testament jesus who was the eighth person david was the eighth person amen no i was the eighth person i want to be eighth person right now because you open the seven seals on the eighth day the evening time you gave the understanding to me something that my brothers and my sisters for ages they waited for that they pray for that they pray for the revival and the greatest revival but the smallest one but the greatest is going on right now right now when jesus came the first time the eighth person it was such a great revival it was so small a handful of people recognized that what do you think it was not so mysterious as the second coming you know when the alpha becoming omega amen now i'm going to finish but you know the octave in latin is the eighth octave in the musical terminology octave is the eighth because it's a is a turn whole turn from one key up to the eighth one and his turn around alpha became omega we supposed to sing on a higher octave we supposed to sing the higher octave the new song the seventh song we're supposed to understand what's going on right now because the main thing doesn't go in heaven the main thing is going on right now on the earth we are the people of the seventh song the redeemed ones not the heavenly group but i said i'm sorry i'm sorry i was mistaken holy spirit was present i thought it was a heavenly group in revelation 5 that sung a new song but in the bible you redeem us you redeem us you made us kings and priests the new song is sung here the octave turn amen octave the eighth hallelujah we are the eight people amen we came from eternity coming back to eternity praise god you love him he's so precious to us god bless you god bless you let's stand up amen hallelujah let's bow our heads lord jesus we are so thankful again coming before your face knowing that you loved us so much before the foundation of the world and you made it possible for us to come in this age i'm so thankful father you even created the earth because of us and you place us here we are here gather in thy name father we know that the the bride must be drawn together the bride must be taken up in the midst of the seventh seal the mystery of going father we believe that we are living in that season open our eyes lord let us be honest in our hearts to see scripture how is fulfilling on our eyes how the word of god is real genuine how we didn't come to certain station between but we came to a reality genuine genuine feast genuine uniting time and sign genuine word that became flesh in the bride father we've been in your mind before the foundation of the world but it's such a privilege to worship you in our flesh knowing that we've been sinful born in a wrong way oh father we came through the wrong channel but now we've got a different birth we are born by this power of a spoken word we've got the immaculate birth you had it you've been the only one only one you just came not through sex but now you provide a way for us that we've got the birth by the power spoken word

pentecostal age into the bride age i wanted to be more than knowledge more than understanding i want it to be a life how many want to be people of the eighth day with eight day revelation living an eighth day life every day amen stuck in time but eternity fleshed out in a time realm the eighth day made manifest in the seventh day because the two are together blending from one into the other it's an overlap time do you believe in your overlap time then it's time and the overlap time for eternity to be manifest in time i want to be people of the eighth day not knowledge not a concept not a doctrine but a living reality lived in flesh let it be lived in me o god oh i appreciated the word how many love the lord for the word how many are encouraged by the word oh let's sing this song the
