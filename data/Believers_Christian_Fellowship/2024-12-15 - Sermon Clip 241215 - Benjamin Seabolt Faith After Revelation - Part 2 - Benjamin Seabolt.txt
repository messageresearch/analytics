TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Souls that are in prison now brother Bram says a man that's got the spirit of God in him or a woman lives the word that's the heartbeat the predestinated for the word of God comes to them and they are the word to the people what a statement that's the heartbeat that predestinated for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word to the people written Epistles read of all men is that right could the Third be on is the third poll to preach to the Eternal doomed that's rejected the message of Salvation And this is where he makes this statement the six seal has produced itself uh speaking of the judgments coming on the earth The Sixth Seal has produced itself the seventh seal brings him back to Earth I find it extremely interesting that he makes that statement immediately after he says that the word of God comes to this group of people and they are the word to the people what is the seventh seal the seventh seal is not a piece of paper wrote up with a stamp on it the seventh seal is when Christ comes back to Earth Earth that's why brother brandom said I can take one of these seals and I can go from Genesis to Revelation and I can preach it around and around and around the clock because the seventh seal is not a definition of the interpretation of these symbols the seventh seal is an event and the seventh seal was all the way back in Genesis it wasn't just in Revelation it's just not now it's now that we understand it's now that we can see that was all the way back but it was still going on back then because why because the seventh seal is when Christ comes back to Earth let me say it this way the seventh seal is when Christ shows up in your situation amise amen the seventh seal is not when you show up in your situation the seventh seal is Christ coming into your situation amen amen he says the six seal has produced itself obviously six comes right before seven what's the Sixth Seal judgment what brings the seventh seal judgment we've got to judge ourselves understand that we're not worthy understand that we don't stand a chance understand that we can't fix this problem amen mechanically approach the seventh seal the mechanics have to be in place the mechanics are judging ourselves coming to the appropriate conclusion that I have no human ability to fix this or to Manifest this or to make this word of God live and then and only then the seventh seal can come back to earth
