[6:44] yeah oh yeah oh my yeah it's it was a
[6:46] beautiful
[6:47] beautiful day and i can't think of a
[6:48] better way to cap off a beautiful day

[6:53] of a better way than to be

[6:57] cool of the evening and just
[6:58] gather one with another our little licks
[7:00] of fire and just feed from his hand
[7:02] i just honestly can't think of a better
[7:04] thing for us to be doing it
[7:06] i hope it's all right i just want to
[7:08] share a few things
[7:09] i had gotten and i do want to say this i
[7:13] brother said you don't know what i'm
[7:14] preaching right
[7:16] yeah so he opened with psalms 100
[7:20] and i just want to read the last
[7:23] the portion of there know ye that the
[7:27] lord he is god
[7:28] it is he that hath made us and not we
[7:31] ourselves
[7:33] ain't nothing i've done in myself i
[7:37] he did it all we are his people
[7:40] and the sheep of his pasture
[7:43] and i i i i wanna brother franco i
[7:47] didn't i don't wanna
[7:48] i said to brother franco don't show this
[7:50] powerpoint i'm just gonna use it as my
[7:52] notes
[7:52] but brother franco maybe you could put
[7:54] up just the first um
[7:56] picture so this is my subject tonight
[8:00] that brother chad knows nothing about
[8:02] and uh
[8:04] i i just was so um i'm just gonna be me
[8:08] i was so enjoying the day and i was
[8:11] really just
[8:12] thanking the lord for my sonship i was
[8:15] thanking the lord that you know
[8:17] hey i belong to you i i'm not
[8:20] like everybody else you know you know
[8:22] the world right now they're in chaos
[8:24] they don't know what to do you know
[8:25] political parties they both got
[8:28] kindergartners as their heads and you
[8:30] know it's just a mess right now you know
[8:32] and
[8:32] and everybody knows and if that's your
[8:34] hope that's your your strength
[8:36] you know you're in trouble and they know
[8:38] they're in trouble like the whole world
[8:39] knows they're in trouble and
[8:41] but we're not in trouble we i i'm one of
[8:45] his sheep
[8:47] and when he called i'm one he elected
[8:49] i'm one he caught
[8:50] he carried me right out of darkness and
[8:52] brought me into this marvelous light
[8:54] you know and that so it's my entire
[8:58] thought tonight
[8:59] it's just my entire thought is just i
[9:01] want to bask in the glory of the sheep
[9:03] of his pasture
[9:05] and i want to talk about that lamb and
[9:07] being one of his
[9:08] lambs the opportunity of being one of
[9:10] his lambs
[9:11] and then the responsibility of being one
[9:13] of his lambs because
[9:15] in his step as a shepherd we want to
[9:17] follow in his footsteps so we're not
[9:19] only lambs but we're shepherds
[9:21] in one sort of way we're not all pastors
[9:24] we're not all ministers but you do
[9:26] have a certain portion of you of god in
[9:29] you that you are
[9:30] shepherding you're helping i think the
[9:32] word shepherd in that i looked it up air
[9:34] force
[9:34] air force guys may know this a shepherd
[9:37] um
[9:38] a plane that is shepherding another one
[9:40] it could be another plane that's wounded
[9:42] i saw this when i was studying it today
[9:44] a a plane that is wounded or it's been
[9:46] hit by emini
[9:48] m yeah
[9:51] fire they'll send forth a shepherd plane
[9:53] and that shepherd plane's whole job and
[9:56] responsibility that point is to be the
[9:58] protection
[9:59] for this wounded plane to get it back to
[10:00] base
[10:02] and i thought well i like that because
[10:04] each and every one of us at different
[10:05] points
[10:06] we're a shepherd and it's in that line
[10:09] and duty of a shepherd god can use us to
[10:11] do things you never thought possible
[10:13] it's in that simplicity it's always
[10:15] hidden in such a simplicity of just
[10:18] taking care of the sheep just taking
[10:20] care of the sheep so
[10:21] we're going to get to that but i was so
[10:23] encouraged you know
[10:25] i was just back there praying lord i
[10:26] don't know how to do this i don't really
[10:27] want to do this
[10:29] maybe brother chad could just keep on
[10:30] going you know he said he like had
[10:32] something
[10:33] ah you know and then he just drops that
[10:35] in there i said well
[10:36] okay if that's what he wants that's what
[10:38] we talk about
[10:39] tonight so we're gonna back up here
[10:43] [Music]
[10:44] and i wanted to say this and i hope this
[10:46] all right i had a little a little thing
[10:48] that struck me today and it was like a
[10:49] little sermonette
[10:51] and i was outside looking at all those
[10:52] beautiful trees and they're
[10:54] just shining in the radiance of their
[10:57] beauty right now with all the colors of
[10:58] the rainbow just shining the way they
[10:59] are
[11:00] and i if you have one ounce of god i
[11:03] don't know
[11:03] inside of you i don't think you can go
[11:05] out inside of nature right now and just
[11:06] be in
[11:07] awe of his presence and i was sitting
[11:10] there looking at and i kind of in my
[11:11] mind was playing a little story i was
[11:13] like you know
[11:14] what if i came in i said now how did you
[11:16] produce such beauty
[11:18] all these trees you know and all their
[11:20] different variabilities you have the oak
[11:22] trees you have the hickories you have
[11:24] every one of them
[11:25] and they're shining in their magnificat
[11:27] magnificence a little bit of a different
[11:29] color
[11:30] and they're all individually different
[11:32] but together they make like this
[11:33] beautiful bouquet this beautiful scenery
[11:35] just like the children of god we're all
[11:37] individually uniquely different
[11:39] in and of ourself but we're feeding off
[11:41] the same life right all life comes from
[11:43] god the life that was in all those trees
[11:45] came from god they all have this portion
[11:47] of life
[11:47] but it's manifesting and it's displaying
[11:50] in a different radiance in a different
[11:52] glory the same life
[11:54] just in a different way just like each
[11:55] and every one of us and if i could ask
[11:57] those trees you know what's making you
[11:59] so beautiful right now
[12:00] it's a it's nothing i've done it's just
[12:02] uh it's just the life that's inside of
[12:05] me
[12:05] manifested this way it's just an
[12:08] expression of the seed that i
[12:10] i was you know and that just gives you
[12:12] kind of a little confidence it's
[12:14] it's really not him that willeth or him
[12:15] that run it's just god it's just
[12:17] god doing something in and through us
[12:19] not anything we've ever
[12:21] done i i can't produce the christian
[12:24] life
[12:25] it's not me it's just something inside
[12:27] of me expressing itself to the world
[12:29] it takes all the pressure off the sum of
[12:32] a christian life is rest
[12:33] it's not me it's just something behind
[12:35] me pushing me
[12:36] expressing itself right and you get to
[12:39] look at those trees and say well praise
[12:41] god you know
[12:42] but you know all of us would look at
[12:43] them and say well
[12:45] they're most beautiful right now they're
[12:47] most beautiful
[12:48] why are they most beautiful right now
[12:50] because they're dying
[12:52] they're expressing death now we know
[12:55] that to be the truth and i don't think i
[12:57] ever have seen something that i have
[12:59] admired more in the lord jesus christ
[13:02] it was beautiful to see him raise the
[13:03] dead i loved it when he could heal the
[13:05] blind
[13:06] and do those many things but when he
[13:07] could stand there
[13:09] and let him them crucify him they never
[13:12] he let them do that let them rip
[13:15] his beard out let them him spit in their
[13:18] face
[13:19] he stood there and took death for you
[13:22] and me
[13:23] and that's when it was most beautiful
[13:25] and i have yet to ever
[13:27] i think in my life see anything more
[13:29] beautiful
[13:30] than to see the christian who starts to
[13:33] take up his cross
[13:34] it says now it's not my will it's thine
[13:37] will be done
[13:38] there could be a lot of things expressed
[13:39] that you said that's awesome you could
[13:41] raise the dead you could do a lot of
[13:42] things
[13:43] but when you stand there before a cross
[13:45] and you say it's not my will
[13:47] but it's thy will be done i don't know
[13:50] if there's anything more beautiful than
[13:51] that i really don't
[13:53] and uh so you know it's just
[13:56] you get sermons just going out in nature
[13:58] right now and and then the only last the
[14:00] last little thought part i had online i
[14:01] said now
[14:02] it's dying but you know if i ask that
[14:04] what's really going on he says oh i'm
[14:06] just going
[14:06] the life inside me is just going back
[14:08] where it was
[14:10] it's just going back you know why
[14:11] because winter's coming i've got a
[14:13] hiding place
[14:14] the storms of life are coming but god
[14:16] provided a way
[14:18] i'm going back to where i came from i'm
[14:19] going back into the roots that i came
[14:22] out of because there's a storm coming
[14:24] i'm
[14:25] safely hidden in his presence psalms 27
[14:28] see
[14:29] the whole bible speaks it's just a
[14:31] matter of if you're looking for him or
[14:33] not
[14:33] and i just so i was blessed i already
[14:37] had a good sermon preached to me by the
[14:38] trees outside today and i i just enjoyed
[14:41] that
[14:41] that's my sermon i'm not going to say
[14:43] let's stand and close in prayer but
[14:45] that's my little sermonette that i
[14:47] wanted to share with you
[14:48] i was encouraged by it okay brother
[14:51] franco if it's okay
[14:53] i wanted to uh share we haven't had
[14:56] really a missions update for quite a
[14:57] while
[14:58] mainly because nobody could do anything
[15:01] because of the covet and everything else
[15:03] like that
[15:03] most countries are completely shut down
[15:05] and couldn't gather but i had just
[15:06] received some pictures
[15:08] from our brother alfred fury in
[15:11] malawi and a real precious brother real
[15:13] saint of god and
[15:14] i just felt to share him with you here
[15:16] and i hope that's okay
[15:17] you know mainly because you can be in
[15:19] prayer for him
[15:21] and also i thought there was a good
[15:22] little lesson here that kind of
[15:24] fit right in with my thought tonight
[15:27] obviously brother alfred is here in the
[15:29] the blue and i want to give a background
[15:31] here on some of these pictures this
[15:33] brother
[15:34] i asked brother alfred i said can you
[15:36] explain this brother and he said well
[15:38] this is my father he says
[15:41] um not natural though but i've i've
[15:44] taken him as my father and he's taken me
[15:46] as a son
[15:47] the story here is he is a believer and
[15:50] his wife
[15:50] passed away and his other children
[15:53] passed away and he had one son living
[15:56] and six months ago he moved to live with
[15:58] that son whom brother alfred
[16:00] uh ministers to that group that's there
[16:02] and the son died
[16:04] so the man's completely alone and he has
[16:06] no children he has no wife and he's
[16:08] he's got no money he's got nothing and
[16:10] there was a proposition given to him he
[16:12] asked the wife of
[16:16] his son who died her parents
[16:19] if she he could just sleep or stay
[16:22] in their house until he died that was
[16:24] his only request
[16:26] and they said only if you join the
[16:28] baptist church
[16:31] and he said no way i'll sleep outside is
[16:35] what he said
[16:36] i will not do that he vehemently opposed
[16:38] it and just committed himself
[16:40] to die in the hands of the lord and and
[16:42] this is legitimate of the story and
[16:45] and brother alfred found out about this
[16:47] and he said no
[16:48] no my brother i won't let that happen he
[16:51] says
[16:51] i will be your son you will be my father
[16:54] i will take care of you from this point
[16:56] on
[16:56] and so this man was sleeping on dirt so
[16:59] they've arranged for a young a brother
[17:01] in the assembly there and brother alfred
[17:03] is supporting them
[17:04] and we are supporting them because you
[17:07] know we help with our alfred
[17:09] and he was able to get a little um
[17:11] portion of
[17:12] the brother's house that this brother's
[17:13] going to be staying in and we got him a
[17:15] little mattress
[17:16] or he got him a mattress so that he
[17:18] doesn't have to sleep on the ground and
[17:19] a blanket
[17:20] and brother alfred's going to continue
[17:22] care for him
[17:24] and uh i thought that's that's what a
[17:26] good shepherd does
[17:28] he cares for his sheep right next one
[17:30] brother if you can go down
[17:33] um here's the assembly and the uh the
[17:35] church
[17:36] um this one church whether alfred
[17:38] travels like a circuit rider almost you
[17:39] know and travel is throughout those
[17:41] areas
[17:42] lots and lots of small groups there and
[17:44] but here's their assembly
[17:45] and um it's nice huh
[17:49] don't ever take for granted the nice
[17:51] pews don't ever take for granted the
[17:53] nice church that we all
[17:54] we have we have a very nice church i
[17:56] don't think we've ever complained
[17:57] i'm not going to say about being cold or
[17:59] hot because someone's always cold and
[18:00] hot
[18:01] but not too cold or too hot
[18:05] we're not exposed to the elements i
[18:07] don't think we've ever had to
[18:09] move our seats to get out of the rain
[18:12] i don't think we've ever had to do those
[18:14] things so we have a lot to be thankful
[18:16] for don't we
[18:17] um and you know brother alfred i've
[18:20] never heard him preach
[18:21] i don't think any of you have ever heard
[18:22] him preach and you'll probably never be
[18:23] heard preaching
[18:24] but he's faithful to those sheep he's
[18:27] taking care of those sheep
[18:28] next one brother franco um this is the
[18:32] motorcycle we purchased for him
[18:33] quite some time ago and he said it's
[18:35] still still running
[18:37] got a couple issues we're gonna help him
[18:38] get him fixed but he's just wanted to
[18:40] say thank you it's
[18:41] it's this is his workhorse it's still
[18:44] still running
[18:45] next one brother it's another little
[18:49] assembly that
[18:50] brother alfred takes care of and sent a
[18:52] picture of it
[18:54] next one brother and this is um i can't
[18:58] say her name sister
[18:59] charwa or something like that and he
[19:01] sent this picture and he said uh the
[19:03] sister's been
[19:04] praying for a blanket for 12 years and
[19:06] god provided
[19:07] and that's all he said in the text i
[19:08] said brother will you please explain
[19:10] this to me
[19:12] he said so the story goes for this
[19:14] sister she
[19:15] is a believer and she moved from i
[19:19] believe
[19:19] tanzania or somewhere like that into
[19:22] malawi with her husband and three
[19:23] children
[19:24] and after a couple years her husband
[19:25] abandoned her and
[19:28] she had to move in with her very elderly
[19:30] father and she
[19:31] has been there the whole time doing what
[19:34] she can to provide for her three
[19:35] children
[19:36] and also care for her elderly father and
[19:39] there was never any funds to buy a
[19:40] decent blanket
[19:42] she she had a um a cloth i guess you
[19:44] call like a sheet
[19:46] and uh and it came up in conversation
[19:49] that sister has been believing for a
[19:50] blanket and brother i offered her about
[19:52] it he said well
[19:53] let's let's get that for this sister so
[19:56] she
[19:56] she got the blanket this last week and
[19:58] she was overwhelmed with joy
[20:01] she said it's been 12 years that she's
[20:03] been believing god for a blanket
[20:04] and she said god provided and brother
[20:07] alfred had made the comment he said
[20:09] the shepherd takes care of his sheep
[20:11] amen
[20:13] and so that's heavy
[20:17] i'm just going to be honest with you as
[20:19] a human being living in america these
[20:20] things are heavy for me
[20:22] um but i i i so
[20:25] appreciate it's it's it's god mindful of
[20:28] his sheep
[20:29] he this sister didn't need a hundred
[20:31] thousand dollar house and a new car and
[20:33] all these things she just wanted a
[20:34] blanket and god provided
[20:36] and she was thankful and i don't
[20:40] i want to be thankful for what god's
[20:41] provided i i told brother chaplin
[20:43] i may just go out and just tell people
[20:45] how thankful i am to be a christian
[20:48] might take an hour and just express to
[20:50] you some way somehow
[20:52] we're a thankful people we have nothing
[20:54] to complain about
[20:55] nothing to criticize why our father
[20:57] knows what we have need of
[20:59] i'm a sheep and his pastor he called me
[21:02] he sent his angel to me and said behold
[21:05] their lamb has come
[21:06] why don't you go there and he came to
[21:07] the right people he came to shepherds
[21:09] right
[21:10] he went to shepherds that knew that how
[21:11] to care for the lamb
[21:13] they knew he knew that this land these
[21:15] shepherds would care for the lamb in the
[21:16] right way
[21:17] and i believe with all my heart he came
[21:19] to people like us
[21:20] simple uneducated nobodies
[21:24] but we we we view the lamb as precious
[21:27] in our sight
[21:28] he's the most precious thing this
[21:29] message this word this living reality to
[21:32] us is the most precious
[21:34] thing we could have ever came in contact
[21:36] with
[21:37] and i don't think we should ever take it
[21:39] lightly i don't think we should ever
[21:41] not cherish it it with everything we got
[21:44] in
[21:44] us it's not a common thing
[21:48] this is not something that everybody
[21:50] will enjoy
[21:51] this is only for the sheep of his
[21:53] pasture only for those sheep
[21:56] so pray for the sister yes if you don't
[21:59] mind pray for brother alfred he asked
[22:01] for prayers from the assembly and he
[22:02] also wanted me to pass on
[22:04] tremendous thanksgiving from his heart
[22:06] that we've
[22:07] been able to support him many years now
[22:10] and he said so many of these needs could
[22:11] never have been met
[22:12] if if we wouldn't have had a burden to
[22:15] help
[22:16] in the ministry so
[22:19] okay if you'll stand
[22:22] for the reading of the word
[22:26] um psalms 23 1 my opening scripture
[22:47] psalms 23 1 the lord is my shepherd
[22:51] i shall not want he maketh me to lie
[22:54] down in green pastures
[22:56] he leadeth me beside still waters
[22:59] he restoreth my soul he leadeth me
[23:03] in the paths of righteousness i like
[23:06] this
[23:06] for his name's sake not mine
[23:10] it's his reputation on the line not mine
[23:15] yea though i walk through the valley of
[23:17] the shadow of death
[23:18] i'll fear no evil for thou art with me
[23:21] thy rod thy staff they comfort me
[23:24] thou preparest to table before me in the
[23:26] presence of mine enemies
[23:28] thou anointest my head with oil my cup
[23:31] runeth over surely goodness and mercy
[23:34] shall follow me
[23:36] all the days of my life and i will dwell
[23:38] in the house of the lord
[23:40] forever may god add tremendous blessings
[23:43] to his word you may be
[23:44] seated so
[23:48] you can see why i am encouraged you know
[23:51] it's like anything though i walk through
[23:52] the valley of the shadow of death
[23:55] i will fear no evil the only reason you
[23:57] can fear no evil
[23:58] is because thou art with me the only way
[24:01] that i can come out here
[24:02] at this point without fear is because i
[24:04] know he's with me
[24:05] and i think you know he's in our
[24:07] presence and as long as we know he's in
[24:09] our presence what do we have to fear
[24:11] what's going to come upon us that could
[24:14] cause us to fret
[24:16] and be upset if i know he's with me we
[24:18] can go through anything
[24:20] it really doesn't matter it's just the
[24:22] way it goes and
[24:23] and i wanted to look at some of these
[24:25] things and we're just going to take some
[24:26] time and i just honestly want to take
[24:28] some time to psalms 23 and i know this
[24:30] isn't deep but i told you i may come out
[24:32] for an hour
[24:33] and just tell you how thankful i am to
[24:34] be a christian i may say that a few
[24:36] hundred times tonight i don't know
[24:38] but i just want to take some time and
[24:40] look at this he says the lord is
[24:42] my shepherd and i got the thing and i
[24:44] says now ain't it good
[24:46] thing that he didn't just say the lord
[24:47] is a is a shepherd
[24:49] he's not just a shepherd you know he's
[24:52] my
[24:52] shepherd like i'm happy for you that
[24:54] he's your shepherd that's a wonderful
[24:56] thing but it's a whole new joy when i
[24:58] know that

[25:01] promised he'd never leave me nor forsake
[25:03] me
[25:03] i'll be with you even in you to the end
[25:06] of the world

[25:10] you see i'm with you i'm your shepherd
[25:13] i'm the one that's caring for you
[25:16] and it's my reputation on the line if
[25:18] something happens to you
[25:20] that just changes i mean that just so
[25:23] uplifts me
[25:24] what what do we have to be afraid of
[25:27] it's shalom
[25:29] it's good morning do you know who you
[25:31] are
[25:32] you're the beloved you're his beloved
[25:35] you're the sheep of his pasture you're
[25:37] the one that he's going to fulfill this
[25:39] great purpose and plan
[25:40] in that he per he per he purposed in
[25:43] himself to do
[25:44] from before the foundation of the world
[25:45] and you find to be the man and the woman
[25:47] that he's going to do it
[25:49] oh it's just for me i says he's my
[25:52] shepherd
[25:53] yeah that's mine i'm taking ownership of
[25:54] that you know that's
[25:56] me that's that's my shepherd he may be
[25:59] your king but he's not just your king
[26:00] he's my king
[26:02] and the king of kings and lord of lords
[26:04] is watching over me
[26:07] devil do what you want say what you want
[26:09] whisper whatever you want
[26:10] that word says he's mine shepherd oh i
[26:13] like that
[26:15] so i shall not want what do i have want
[26:16] for his reputation's on the line
[26:20] what's going to go wrong that he don't
[26:21] know about nothing
[26:24] he's my shepherd he maketh me to lie
[26:28] down in green pastures and he leadeth me
[26:30] beside still waters
[26:32] he knows what i have need of he knows
[26:35] how to feed me right
[26:37] he knows just the right food at just the
[26:39] right time to give in just the right way
[26:42] and i thought about this today i got to
[26:44] think and i says you know
[26:46] i'm watching my my little girls they're
[26:48] growing so fast and if you've ever known
[26:50] you have girls boys too they grow in
[26:54] spurts
[26:55] they don't grow all at once cali grew i
[26:57] think five inches in the last year
[26:59] right and they start eating everything
[27:02] in sight right
[27:03] well you know growth is coming because
[27:05] there's a lot of
[27:07] appetite and with this desire for a lot
[27:10] of appetite
[27:10] takes a lot of food because we got some
[27:13] growth to go into
[27:14] but you know what's so interesting after
[27:16] the growth
[27:18] stops just stops you know what it is
[27:21] it's acclimating the body is acclimating
[27:25] to the growth and you know that's true
[27:28] and i got to think about this let's just
[27:30] go with me a little journey let's say
[27:32] we're climbing mount everest
[27:33] if anybody know climbing there's some
[27:35] certain things about climate look this
[27:37] up
[27:38] when you're climbing mount everest you
[27:39] don't go from the bottom to the top
[27:41] without stopping
[27:42] you don't you can't
[27:45] you can only i think steve my
[27:48] father-in-law would know but i think
[27:50] it's for every hour climbed it'll
[27:52] between on the body and
[27:53] the shape of the person it'll take one
[27:55] to three hours for every hour climbed
[27:57] that you have to stop so that your body
[28:00] can acclimate to the new
[28:03] altitude otherwise altitude sickness can
[28:06] set in and you you can get really really
[28:08] sick
[28:08] get messed up so with every step higher
[28:12] you have a pause you don't go
[28:15] all the way up in one swoop
[28:18] right and then every time you climb you
[28:20] gotta do i think it's the same way when
[28:22] you scuba dive up right brother rich
[28:23] i don't never done it but from what i
[28:26] remember you saying that one time you
[28:27] can only go down
[28:29] so fast when you're going deep into
[28:31] things you can only you can go down so
[28:32] much and you got to stop and i think
[28:34] your body's got to regulate to the
[28:35] pressures or something like that things
[28:37] got to happen you don't go
[28:38] all the way down to the bottom you go
[28:41] incrementally
[28:42] and when i'm teaching lesson i i teach
[28:44] some math sometimes my daughters i
[28:46] notice
[28:47] you know i i'll teach them a lesson you
[28:49] know and and no school or no teacher
[28:51] would just pour them on okay we're going
[28:52] to do
[28:53] uh add addition today subtraction we're
[28:55] doing multiplication on the third day
[28:57] we're going to calculus on the fourth
[28:58] we're going to geometry on the fifth
[29:00] we're going to this on that and we're
[29:01] going to
[29:02] no good teacher does that nobody does
[29:06] you know what you do you say this is how
[29:07] you add and this is how you subtract now
[29:10] we're going to spend the next week
[29:12] adding and subtracting and then after
[29:15] that we're going to
[29:16] we're going to go into multiplication
[29:17] now it may take us two weeks for you to
[29:19] really grasp how to use multiplication
[29:21] correctly right
[29:23] so that's it's natural those things are
[29:26] natural
[29:27] you think it's any different in the
[29:28] spiritual realm no
[29:30] you ever notice that you notice it as a
[29:32] body
[29:33] it's like boy we just hit the gas and
[29:35] then
[29:36] level off for a moment it's natural it's
[29:40] called
[29:40] body acclimating
[29:43] it means the body has to acclimate to
[29:45] the new spiritual reality that she is
[29:47] now living in
[29:48] right it don't just happen all at once
[29:52] you don't have a baby tomorrow and she
[29:54] gets married on the next day it just
[29:56] don't happen
[29:57] you acclimate you grow in those things
[30:00] god gives you a truth and reveals a
[30:02] portion of himself to you you find
[30:04] yourself in the portion of the
[30:05] revelation
[30:06] and then you walk in it for a while you
[30:09] gotta learn to walk in that new reality
[30:11] for you
[30:12] you gotta learn to walk in it because
[30:14] what is this it's
[30:15] god's great mystery hidden in you
[30:18] hidden in me god unveiling this
[30:21] attribute
[30:22] and this great desire that he had one
[30:24] day at a time
[30:26] one step at a time little at a time
[30:29] now i know sometimes i want to go i want
[30:32] to get the point i want the rapture to
[30:34] mar
[30:35] i want the body change i'm in the
[30:36] process of the rapture but you know what
[30:38] i know sometimes we want the body change
[30:40] tomorrow
[30:40] but i'm going in the rapture word by
[30:43] word brother branham said
[30:45] step by step you ever climb a ladder you
[30:48] take one step
[30:49] and you know what you can't take another
[30:51] step with that same foot you got to
[30:52] bring the rest of the body up to the
[30:54] next level
[30:54] that you just took a step to it's the
[30:57] body
[30:58] acclimating to these new realities all
[31:00] the time right
[31:03] and i i got to thinking about that you
[31:05] know that's how god deals with us that's
[31:08] how god deals with his sheep
[31:10] because you find in here he's dealing
[31:12] with these sheep he's
[31:13] he he had him by these green pastures
[31:16] and if i was a sheep i'd never want to
[31:17] leave a green pasture
[31:19] i'd never why would lord why are we
[31:21] leaving the pasture
[31:22] why are we leaving the still waters
[31:24] because i read in the next line
[31:26] lord you're taking me into the valley of
[31:28] the shadow of death
[31:30] why would you do that you know i don't
[31:33] like shadowy places
[31:35] you imagine a sheep walking through this
[31:36] place he can't identify
[31:38] what's a rock and what's a wolf you know
[31:40] what he has to do
[31:42] keep his eye on the shepherd just keep
[31:45] my eye
[31:46] on that shepherd because i'm afraid to
[31:48] look anywhere else
[31:50] we've all been there you let shadowy
[31:52] valleys come
[31:53] our way and you think now lord what is
[31:55] going on you were here you were moving
[31:57] the mighty way i was beside these
[31:59] green pastures and these still waters
[32:00] and you were just feeding me and i was
[32:02] getting fat and
[32:04] sassy you're just really feeding on the
[32:07] word of god and now he's like yeah now
[32:09] we gotta go walk a little bit
[32:11] we gotta go so we got you know what i
[32:13] got to get you on the other side of this
[32:14] mountain we need some new vitamins over
[32:15] here but you know what before we get
[32:17] there
[32:17] i got to take you through this valley i
[32:19] got to take you through this valley
[32:21] first
[32:22] yeah because i don't know why
[32:25] a shepherd would ever want to leave or
[32:28] bring his sheep away from a green
[32:29] pasture
[32:30] unless he's taken them to another green
[32:32] pasture
[32:34] but he just has to go through a valley
[32:35] sometimes to get there right
[32:37] we all go through those that's just
[32:39] typical that's normal christian life
[32:41] mountaintops and valleys so hey when you
[32:45] know those things
[32:46] you're not surprised because he said i'm
[32:48] with you right there
[32:50] and if you're walking through that
[32:52] valley of the shadow of death
[32:53] and things are looking rough and you get
[32:56] scared and you start to run off the side
[32:58] don't worry
[32:58] the shepherd's rod is going to hit you
[33:00] really good on the side and get you back
[33:01] in line
[33:02] it's going to get you back remember it's
[33:04] his reputation on the line
[33:06] not mine i like that thou preparest the
[33:10] table before me in the presence
[33:12] of mine enemies thou anointest my head
[33:15] with oil
[33:16] and my cup runneth over in this day and
[33:19] age where
[33:21] my we're to have some enemies
[33:24] and we got some now what they call
[33:26] heresy is the way i'm serving the god of
[33:28] my fathers
[33:30] but i've got a seven course meal that's
[33:31] feeding me daily he's never let me
[33:33] he's never left me go hungry i've got
[33:36] word upon word a meal after meal after
[33:39] meal
[33:40] he take he prepares it all for me i've
[33:42] got nothing to be afraid of
[33:44] my father my shepherd king took care of
[33:48] a sheep
[33:48] me now i also want to look at
[33:52] samuel if it's okay first samuel 17 34.
[34:04] first samuel 17 34
[34:10] and david said unto saul thy servant
[34:13] kept his father's sheep
[34:14] and there came a lion and a bear
[34:18] and took a lamb out of the flock and i
[34:21] went
[34:21] out after him and i smote him and i
[34:24] delivered it out of his mouth
[34:27] and when he arose against me i caught
[34:29] him by the beard and i smote him and i
[34:31] slew him
[34:32] thy servant slew both the lion and the
[34:34] bear and this
[34:36] uncircumcised philistine shall be as one
[34:38] of them
[34:39] seen he hath defiled the armies of the
[34:41] living god
[34:43] you know i like this so much david's
[34:46] just a shepherd
[34:48] david's just about his father's business
[34:51] he's just faithfully doing what he was
[34:54] called to do
[34:55] and then god creates the circumstances
[34:58] to display the mighty power of god
[35:01] through such a simple vessel
[35:04] that it took everybody's breath away he
[35:06] took down
[35:07] goliath in just a man keeping his
[35:10] father's sheep
[35:12] just a little boy just a young fellow
[35:14] brother bannon said he was just a little
[35:15] ruddy fella
[35:17] but he was faithful and he had he was in
[35:19] the line of duty
[35:20] he had a responsibility to take care of
[35:23] them sheep
[35:26] just take care of them sheep so nothing
[35:29] could
[35:30] stop him in his line of duty god was
[35:32] going to see to it
[35:33] that he would help him to overcome
[35:35] whatever obstacle comes in the way
[35:38] and i like that so much because i can
[35:40] identify with david so
[35:42] much because i know i'm ready i know i
[35:45] ain't got nothing i'm not a skilled
[35:47] warrior i'm not a high trained
[35:48] theologian of any sort
[35:50] or shape but i believe god i i've been
[35:53] with him
[35:54] i've been alone with him i've sat beside
[35:56] those green pastures david talked about
[35:59] i've sat quietly with him and i know
[36:00] he's with me
[36:02] and so if he's with me bring it on
[36:06] what does it matter anymore he promised
[36:08] he'd be with me
[36:10] and i loved so much that he was just
[36:12] faithfully keeping
[36:13] his father's sheep god displayed such
[36:16] strength in just
[36:17] keeping his father's sheep and i know
[36:20] we're not all ministers and this isn't
[36:21] just for brother chad or any minister
[36:23] it's for you
[36:24] mommy it's for you daddy you've got some
[36:27] little sheep
[36:28] little lambs you're responsible too you
[36:31] let the devil come in
[36:32] buddy remember you're keeping the father
[36:35] sheep
[36:36] sickness come you're keeping the father
[36:38] sheep just strike that thing down
[36:42] by faith take god at his word he'll
[36:44] guide the stone
[36:46] you'll hit that goliath he'll knock out
[36:47] whatever that is in the way
[36:49] unbelieving children take care of the
[36:52] sheep
[36:54] feed the sheep feed on the word so that
[36:56] your life can speak louder than the
[36:58] words that you're speaking that can feed
[36:59] off the life that you're living so much
[37:01] so
[37:02] that you keep feeding and you're not
[37:03] speaking to them anymore
[37:05] but you're speaking the message is going
[37:08] forth
[37:09] in silence remember god does great big
[37:11] things in
[37:12] silence the voice of a thousand lived
[37:15] lives for christ
[37:16] so keep feeding the sheep god's gonna do
[37:20] great things in that
[37:24] and brother bannon says this in a god
[37:26] called man david was a hunter
[37:28] and a shepherd in the psalms he wrote of
[37:30] green pastures and still waters because
[37:32] there he was alone by himself
[37:35] he wasn't contaminated with the things
[37:37] of the world
[37:38] god has to get a man away from the
[37:40] things of the world so in getting quiet
[37:42] so he can just listen that still small
[37:45] voice
[37:46] then once in contact with god he becomes
[37:48] fearless
[37:50] notice that he don't care what anyone
[37:52] says
[37:53] because he's been in the presence of god
[37:55] he knows
[37:56] god in the power of his resurrection and
[37:58] then david we see him one day god
[38:00] permitted a bear to come in remember
[38:02] god permitted the bear to come in and
[38:05] get
[38:05] to get one of them his sheep david just
[38:09] took
[38:09] after the bear no doubt but what he
[38:11] prayed because a little letter
[38:13] later on he confessed to that that he
[38:15] prayed and he asked god
[38:17] he was the caretaker of that sheep he
[38:20] could not
[38:21] lose that sheep he must save the sheep
[38:24] at all price so he grabbed the little
[38:27] slingshot and took out after the bear
[38:29] and he killed it
[38:31] he must save that sheep see what god had
[38:34] been training him for
[38:36] god wants his shepherds to save the
[38:38] sheep regardless of what they have to be
[38:41] called
[38:41] or what they have to go through you save
[38:44] them sheep
[38:46] i like that you're not living for
[38:48] yourself anymore david wasn't concerned
[38:50] about getting hurt or even killed his
[38:51] responsibility his duty
[38:53] get that sheep out of that bear's mouth
[38:55] if i gotta take some hits for it that's
[38:57] okay
[38:58] i'm living for the sheep okay
[39:02] i hope it's okay right just i'm just
[39:04] pouring out right so
[39:07] shepherd of the sheepful but when a
[39:09] sheep's lost you see he's absolutely
[39:11] helpless
[39:12] i picked up i picked up a sheet uh not
[39:16] standing 300 yards from
[39:18] from the sheepfold there he was
[39:21] and that sheep was absolutely lost he
[39:24] just stands there and bleats until a
[39:26] wolf would get him
[39:27] because he cannot find his way back he's
[39:29] totally and helpless
[39:31] he's totally helpless without a shepherd
[39:34] a sheep can't do a thing that's us don't
[39:37] you ever think you're anything more than
[39:39] a sheep
[39:39] but we're the sheep of the right pasture
[39:42] you ain't ever
[39:43] going to get to the point you don't need
[39:45] the shepherd every day of your life
[39:47] i'm convinced of that more and more
[39:49] every day
[39:50] i have to live with this animal right so
[39:53] i don't trust this thing this flesh here
[39:55] at all and i need him every day to help
[39:57] me overcome
[39:58] every single day we don't ever want to
[40:00] get arrogant we don't ever want to get
[40:02] prideful
[40:03] no we're still sheep i love to had
[40:05] brother tommy i don't see brother tommy
[40:07] i had brother tommy come and talk to the
[40:08] youth the other oh there he is brother
[40:10] tom hope it's okay brother i'm going to
[40:11] use you but brother tommy's a pillar for
[40:13] me and i had him come to talk to the
[40:14] youth
[40:15] last week and it had i had it on my
[40:17] heart to do it because i said now here's
[40:18] a man
[40:19] 82 years old right there's some wisdom
[40:22] there
[40:23] and i want him to talk to the kids and
[40:25] as he talked to the kids you know
[40:27] brother tommy admitted he didn't have an
[40:29] education and for him that was a little
[40:30] bit of a complex a little bit of a
[40:32] weakness and
[40:33] it caused him a lot of headaches and
[40:34] some heartaches but i said brother tommy
[40:36] your weakness was your greatest strength
[40:38] you know why you had to have god do
[40:40] everything for you and he did brother
[40:43] tommy did he
[40:44] has he ever failed you 82 years
[40:48] faithful the shepherd takes care of his
[40:50] sheep don't he
[40:51] yeah i just want to stay a sheep i just
[40:54] want to stay simple i just want to stay
[40:56] a sheep
[40:57] in his pasture he'll take care of me
[41:04] let me go to this john 10 11. you know
[41:06] this scripture very well
[41:08] i am the good shepherd well let's see
[41:09] the characteristics of the good shepherd
[41:11] the good shepherd giveth his life for
[41:13] the sheep
[41:14] wow
[41:18] that's a good shepherd the good shepherd
[41:21] you know like even the ministry the
[41:23] ministry there is to serve the people
[41:25] the people don't have to serve the
[41:27] ministry regardless
[41:28] the ministry is there to serve every
[41:30] gift in the body is there to be a help
[41:32] to you
[41:33] every gift that's in the body right and
[41:36] it
[41:36] it's it's there to be a blessing always
[41:40] and it's not looking for any type of
[41:42] accolades
[41:43] or respects or extra respects none
[41:46] whatsoever i don't need any don't want
[41:48] any and i don't believe anybody with a
[41:49] real gift knowing that it came from god
[41:51] would ever have such an arrogancy to
[41:53] think that they need to be served in
[41:55] certain way or
[41:56] bowed in a certain way or you know
[41:58] respected a certain no
[42:00] we're here to serve the people here to
[42:01] serve the bride right
[42:03] that's our goal that's that's what a
[42:05] good shepherd does
[42:07] he serves he helps and he lays himself
[42:10] down on the sheep's behalf he'll take
[42:13] the ridicule he'll take the blame just
[42:16] don't hurt the sheep
[42:17] don't hurt them sheep amen but he that
[42:20] is in hireling and not a shepherd
[42:23] whose own the sheep are not seeth the
[42:25] wolf coming and leaveth the sheep
[42:28] he fleeth and the wolf catcheth him and
[42:31] scattereth the sheep
[42:33] that's a good way of identifying a
[42:35] hireling may have a gift but he's a
[42:37] hireling
[42:38] he's not a true shepherd difficulty
[42:40] comes
[42:41] and the man takes off this is not
[42:44] you you think of uh balaam man he was
[42:48] willing to sacrifice the people for a
[42:50] little bit more prestige and a little
[42:51] bit more money
[42:52] and let the sheep die he's a false
[42:55] prophet you know what i'm saying but
[42:57] look he didn't care about them people
[42:59] no but when the same thing comes to
[43:01] moses moses says blot my name out lord
[43:04] i threw myself in the bleach you take me
[43:06] out but lord protect your people
[43:08] lord don't forsake your people you see
[43:11] the good
[43:12] shepherd in action he's always willing
[43:14] to lay himself down for the sheep
[43:17] that's okay that's okay as long as the
[43:19] sheep are okay
[43:20] i'll take that punch yeah kick me yeah
[43:23] say that about me that's okay
[43:25] are the sheep okay good hit me again
[43:29] right you do the same for your children
[43:30] right you protect your children
[43:33] we should be like that one to the other
[43:35] right we should care for one another so
[43:37] much so
[43:38] that one person would come in and say
[43:40] did you hear about so and so and such is
[43:41] it
[43:42] brother sister you keep that to yourself
[43:44] i'm gonna hear none of that nonsense
[43:46] that's my brother that's my sister you
[43:48] know what let's pray for him
[43:50] don't don't don't do that to one another
[43:52] remember we're sheep and we're shepherds
[43:55] we're watching over each other you know
[43:57] maybe they're in a down time they
[43:59] probably wounded
[44:00] why don't you be a shepherd like that
[44:01] shepherd planes in the air force and you
[44:03] help them get back to the place where
[44:04] god can restore that man restore that
[44:06] woman right
[44:07] that's what shepherds do
[44:14] a hireling fleeth because he is in
[44:16] hireling and careth not for the sheep
[44:18] i am a good shepherd and i know my sheep
[44:20] and i am known of mine
[44:22] as the father knoweth me even so know i
[44:25] the father
[44:26] and i lay my my life down for the sheep
[44:31] john 12 24 says verily verily i say unto
[44:34] you except a corn of wheat fall into the
[44:36] ground and die it abide alone but if it
[44:38] die it bringeth forth much fruit
[44:41] he that loveth his life will lose it he
[44:44] that hateth his
[44:45] life in this world shall keep it unto
[44:48] eternal life
[44:49] if any man serve me let him follow me
[44:52] and where i am there also my servants be
[44:55] if any man serve me him will my father
[44:58] honor
[44:58] and as i'm reading that that picture of
[45:00] that woman in that blanket just popped
[45:01] in my mind
[45:02] you know she's a young woman right she
[45:05] had three children
[45:07] her husband abandons her but she's a
[45:09] believer
[45:10] what does she do she lives alone does
[45:14] the best she can
[45:15] knows that her family is in destitute
[45:17] but that's okay she's a believer
[45:19] she knew the shepherd would take care of
[45:21] her and he did
[45:23] and she her children are raised now and
[45:25] he took care of her
[45:27] you see but she hated she had to hate
[45:30] this natural life if she was looking to
[45:32] appease this natural life she would have
[45:33] found a new husband
[45:35] take care of her do things like that but
[45:37] she would have had to forsake
[45:38] eternal life she had this he's a person
[45:41] she had to forsake the word to do such
[45:44] she would not do that she would suffer
[45:46] more on this earth suffer for a shorter
[45:48] period of time
[45:49] because this is a very sure this is a
[45:50] vapor of a time compared to that time
[45:53] and suffer the reproach for a short
[45:55] period of time to stay true to him
[45:57] the one she really loved
[46:01] so we do these things this is our
[46:03] calling
[46:04] this is what sheep do
[46:08] another thing here i always like this
[46:10] one
[46:11] the great servant moses he got attention
[46:14] of jarius one day little jarius
[46:16] when he wouldn't believe in divine
[46:17] healing he just wouldn't believe it
[46:19] he wanted jarius's heart so what'd he do
[46:23] only thing he could do he struck his
[46:25] daughter and let her die
[46:27] so that jesus could come over and raise
[46:29] her back up again
[46:31] just really get his attention you see
[46:34] god does that sometimes he'll throw you
[46:37] right on your back
[46:38] sometimes make you sick so that you can
[46:41] so that
[46:42] he can make you look up that you will
[46:45] realize
[46:46] like the old shepherd stories had a
[46:48] sheep had to break its leg
[46:50] he said how did the sheep break its leg
[46:52] he said oh i broke it
[46:54] he said now why would a cruel shepherd
[46:56] like you break that
[46:57] sheep's leg he said no said
[47:00] she wouldn't mind me said so i had to go
[47:03] and break her leg in order that i could
[47:04] pack her around a little bit
[47:06] baby her a little bit give her some
[47:08] special food
[47:09] that she would love me and follow me
[47:13] that's the way god has to do sometimes
[47:15] he's got to break us down
[47:17] once in a while just so that he can give
[47:19] us give you some little extra food
[47:21] you know to kind of love on us a little
[47:24] bit
[47:25] do you know that's exactly why i am a
[47:28] gospel preacher tonight
[47:29] it's because i had a spell of sickness
[47:32] and the doctor said that i wouldn't live
[47:34] that's exactly right it changed me you
[47:36] see it shook me
[47:38] that's brother brandon i'm thankful for
[47:41] some broken legs sometimes
[47:43] i had a few i'm sure i got some more
[47:45] coming sometimes but i like that little
[47:47] special fruit and attention i get when
[47:49] he
[47:49] when he picks me up into his arms
[47:54] brother bam also says here in the third
[47:56] exit he said oh the hand of god how
[47:58] sometimes
[47:58] it sure looks cruel the way that people
[48:01] have to suffer
[48:02] it does but see it's the tender hand of
[48:04] jehovah
[48:05] he's leading his little children we
[48:07] thank you for that lord
[48:09] now i pray god as i see the day when the
[48:12] denominations are pressing
[48:13] the believers and excommunicating them
[48:17] saying that if their name is not upon
[48:19] their book they're lost
[48:21] or have nothing to do with the other
[48:23] group you see it's only the tender hand
[48:25] of jehovah just leading them to the tree
[48:27] of life
[48:28] i pray god that each one i know they
[48:30] will because it's your word
[48:32] that it can't fail that they may be led
[48:34] to that tree of life that we might be a
[48:36] possessor of that eternal life
[48:38] see the hand of god in the eyes of faith
[48:40] look beyond those shadows that we're
[48:42] walking in today and see the promised
[48:44] land
[48:44] laying just ahead i've never seen it
[48:47] fail
[48:48] let pressure come let difficulty come
[48:50] let
[48:51] uh whatever come god just uses it to
[48:54] bring him right us closer into his
[48:55] presence i've never seen it fail
[48:58] but bob you ever seen fail no
[49:01] he didn't hear me that's okay sister sam
[49:03] will tell you later
[49:06] we love you brother bob but it's the
[49:10] truth
[49:11] it's true right never seen it fail
[49:14] god's word will never fail i'm sorry
[49:16] we're just home folk tonight it's just
[49:18] going to be real homey
[49:19] right yeah i've never seen it fail
[49:22] always
[49:23] it looks bad it looks real bad i mean
[49:25] bad bad
[49:26] how could it get any bad i'm walking
[49:27] through this valley of shallow depth oh
[49:29] no he's just leading you to new pasture
[49:32] yeah just leading us to some new
[49:34] vitamins
[49:38] so walking into this stepping into
[49:40] psalms 23
[49:41] though i walk through the valley of the
[49:43] shadow of death i fear no evil
[49:45] brother bam says in this day the
[49:47] scriptures fulfill i might could stop
[49:49] here
[49:50] if i had some time and just give you a
[49:51] little tip sometimes you might be
[49:53] sitting out there with cancer
[49:55] you might be setting with the disease
[49:57] you think now why
[49:59] i being a christian would i be in this
[50:02] way
[50:03] why am i sitting like this if i'm a
[50:06] christian
[50:07] sometimes god lets things get so dark
[50:10] till you can't see up around or anywhere
[50:14] else
[50:14] and then he comes and makes a way for
[50:16] you right through it
[50:18] that you may say this day this scripture
[50:21] is fulfilled that he promised to do it
[50:25] man i want to be the fulfillment of his
[50:27] word
[50:28] in no in whatever form it comes i want
[50:31] to be able to say
[50:32] god confirmed his word he did it in me
[50:36] so i want to look at john the baptist
[50:38] for a little bit i just got a couple
[50:39] examples
[50:40] it's wednesday night it'll be short you
[50:41] know yeah the
[50:43] kids got school but
[50:46] brother branham says in the forgotten
[50:47] beatitude see when trouble sets in jesus
[50:51] come and he showed the messiah that he
[50:52] was the messiah
[50:54] but then something went wrong john had
[50:56] introduced the messiah
[50:58] with a fan in his hand and he was going
[51:00] to burn up the chaff
[51:02] but he found out the works of jesus that
[51:04] he was meek
[51:05] and lowly so it worried him he didn't
[51:08] know
[51:09] he didn't know what to say he thought
[51:11] now there's got to be something wrong
[51:13] here somewhere
[51:15] seemed he had believed the wrong thing
[51:17] it seemed like it wasn't working right
[51:20] and there's many a times that we think
[51:23] that too
[51:24] that it isn't working right oh but it's
[51:26] working right
[51:27] as long as we know he's here what
[51:30] difference does it make
[51:32] it's working right maybe it ain't
[51:34] working according the way you may think
[51:36] it ought to work
[51:37] but it's working according to the way
[51:40] that god wants it to work
[51:42] amen i can say amen to that
[51:45] many times i'm like something's wrong
[51:48] something
[51:48] that may work all right oh it's working
[51:50] right is he in our presence
[51:52] then everything's working right
[51:54] everything's perfectly on time
[51:56] nothing's out of cater nothing's out of
[51:58] line
[52:01] so and just looking at john here for a
[52:03] little bit i like this
[52:04] now i can really identify with john you
[52:07] say well
[52:08] john thought well i introduced the
[52:10] messiah that he'd have a fan in his hand
[52:13] and he's going to purge the forest he's
[52:14] going to take the weed into the garter
[52:16] and i told them that axe would be laid
[52:17] to the root of the tree he's going to
[52:19] take all the trash he's going to burn it
[52:21] up
[52:21] and here he is instead of a great mighty
[52:23] man like that
[52:24] here he comes meek and lowly something
[52:27] must have went wrong
[52:28] there's no doubt but something's wrong
[52:30] somewhere he became so
[52:32] dismayed like many of us when we see
[52:34] things
[52:35] going on that it isn't what we think
[52:38] is just right we become dismayed
[52:41] don't worry it will be all right see the
[52:45] devil got a hold of him down in there
[52:47] the devil thought now i've got him in
[52:49] jail now
[52:50] i throwed him in jail so i'll just rough
[52:52] him up real good
[52:54] while i got him in here god isn't using
[52:57] him right now
[52:58] you see i've got him in jail so he just
[53:01] pulled the blanket over him
[53:03] i got him all caged up you see i got
[53:05] that cage
[53:06] that eagle all caged up i'll make him
[53:08] wish he never preached the gospel
[53:10] again you know there's some jail
[53:14] sometime for each of us
[53:16] god ordained some of those things john
[53:18] got dismayed because he thought the plan
[53:20] of god something went wrong
[53:22] and i can't do anything about it i'm in
[53:24] jail i can't confirm what's going on
[53:26] oh but if john could have just realized
[53:28] he was fulfilling the word
[53:30] he was absolutely right on time and in
[53:33] the place that god needed him to be
[53:35] because this one must increase therefore
[53:38] this one must decrease
[53:40] right and it's the exact same way in
[53:43] this message and it's the exact
[53:44] same way in our lives the things that we
[53:47] think ought to be
[53:49] believe me they're just right the way
[53:51] they're supposed to be
[53:53] god's got the whole thing running right
[53:55] on tune but you know like with the
[53:57] symphony right you all know symphony and
[53:59] brother branham talks the symphonies
[54:00] sometimes the symphony it's building up
[54:02] building up and then it just
[54:05] drops down the composer just took at a
[54:08] completely different
[54:09] angle right keeps you on your toes you
[54:11] know what i think
[54:12] i think no matter how well that god
[54:15] makes or
[54:16] even the ministry or god makes things
[54:17] plain he's never going to remove the
[54:19] element of faith
[54:20] he's never going to remove the element
[54:22] because this is the victory that
[54:23] overcome with the world
[54:24] even our faith god had to have
[54:27] something in a way of this great
[54:30] overcoming that we all overcome
[54:32] not because everything is plainly made
[54:35] known to us
[54:36] it can't be that way there's got to
[54:39] always be the element of faith in
[54:40] everything in every revelation there's
[54:42] still an element of faith there
[54:44] because the promise is sure to only the
[54:47] seed
[54:48] the seed of faith so i believe with
[54:51] everything in me
[54:52] i thank god for the ministry i thank god
[54:54] as he continually unveils i thank god as
[54:56] he raises me from word by word by word
[54:58] and i also know that that word is
[55:00] raising a faith inside of me to take him
[55:02] for the nether portion of the word and
[55:04] another part in the land and another
[55:05] portion of the land
[55:07] but he's never going to remove the
[55:08] element of faith it's always going to
[55:10] take a twist you did not expect
[55:12] i mean you just did not see that coming
[55:16] you do it in your own life everything's
[55:17] going real good and then boom
[55:20] everything went real bad everything's
[55:24] just right it's just right
[55:31] i want to use another one i identify
[55:33] with peter
[55:35] i'm going fishing how many ever been
[55:38] that point
[55:39] i'm going fishing i i don't understand
[55:42] what's going on things just have taken
[55:45] turn something's wrong somewhere i mean
[55:48] we beheld him there he was the mighty
[55:51] god the conqueror
[55:53] and he just let them beat him spit at
[55:57] him and rip
[55:58] his face and beard out and shame him i i
[56:01] thought
[56:02] he was setting up his kingdom i thought
[56:03] i thought everything i thought the
[56:05] rapture was tomorrow like the messenger
[56:07] came and
[56:07] the word was preached and he's here and
[56:10] why did it take this turn i mean it
[56:12] looked so weak
[56:13] it looked so simple it looked defeated
[56:16] but it wasn't it was the victory
[56:20] what looked like defeat was actually the
[56:21] victory when it looks like it's all
[56:24] washed up
[56:25] don't worry the victory's right there
[56:29] it looked like that to peter peter got
[56:31] discouraged
[56:32] john 23 1. simon peter sayeth unto them
[56:35] i go efficient
[56:37] they say unto him we also go with thee
[56:40] everybody was discouraged they went
[56:43] forth and entered into a ship
[56:45] immediately
[56:46] and that night they caught nothing
[56:49] brother brahm says and go tell my
[56:51] disciples he said how could they see a
[56:53] man with that much power
[56:55] hang on a cross of calvary with that
[56:58] great mocking and globs of soldiers spit
[57:00] that had made fun of him and dropping
[57:02] off of his beard
[57:04] while they pulled handfuls of beard out
[57:06] of his faith
[57:07] face and hid him upon the head and said
[57:10] prophesy who hit you
[57:12] when they could see those roman nails
[57:14] drove deep into his hands and his feet
[57:17] how could they see a man like that die
[57:20] because god required judgment and got
[57:23] in christ had to take the judgment oh
[57:27] see how they were disappointed
[57:29] they'd went away to their fishing nets
[57:31] again
[57:32] peter said i'm going fishing the
[57:34] disciples said i'm going with you
[57:36] and they did and they were all together
[57:38] tore up
[57:39] and disappointed there they took his
[57:41] body they had wrapped it in linton they
[57:43] had laid it in the grave
[57:46] and they're not a one of us ain't been
[57:48] that point
[57:49] just i'm done i'm going fishing
[57:53] i've been there many a time like i'm
[57:55] just
[57:56] not that i forsake the truth not that i
[57:58] disbelieve it i know it's the truth
[58:00] i just don't know what to do anymore i
[58:03] just i go fishing
[58:05] and i love how the great shepherd came
[58:09] and comforted the sheep
[58:10] you know we know the story
[58:13] but let's read it john 21
[58:17] jesus cometh taketh bread give it to
[58:19] them the fish likewise
[58:21] this is now the third time that jesus
[58:23] showed himself to the disciples and
[58:24] after that he was risen from the dead
[58:27] so when they had dined jesus saith to
[58:30] simon peter
[58:31] simon son of jonas loveth thou me more
[58:34] than these he sayeth unto them yea lord
[58:38] thou knowest that i love thee
[58:39] he saith unto him feed my lambs
[58:42] he sayeth unto him again the second time
[58:45] simon son of jonas
[58:46] loveth thou me he saith unto him yay
[58:49] lord
[58:50] thou knowest that i love thee he saith
[58:52] unto him feed my sheep
[58:55] he saith unto him the third time simon
[58:57] son of jonas
[58:58] loveth thou me peter was grieved because
[59:02] he had asked him the third time
[59:03] loveth thou me he said unto him lord
[59:06] thou knowest all things thou knowest
[59:10] that i
[59:10] love thee jesus saith unto him feed my
[59:13] sheep
[59:14] because no doubt peter was joyed in the
[59:17] presence of the lord while they were
[59:18] sitting there and dining
[59:20] but he also knew that he had denied him
[59:22] three times
[59:23] no doubt he had known when the pressure
[59:25] came on he forsook the lord
[59:28] in his time of need but the good
[59:30] shepherd didn't come down and beat him
[59:32] good shepherd didn't come down and say
[59:34] well you no good nothing didn't i
[59:36] i revealed myself to you i gave you the
[59:39] kingdom a keys to the kingdom
[59:41] like give them back it didn't do any of
[59:45] that
[59:46] didn't change his position didn't change
[59:48] his calling
[59:49] it didn't change anything amen
[59:52] the master the shepherd just came down
[59:54] and just said you love me
[59:56] feed my sheep love me feeding my sheep
[1:00:01] you want to express the great love just
[1:00:03] feed my sheep
[1:00:04] and it restored him remember
[1:00:07] and he says now just follow me and he
[1:00:10] says down here
[1:00:12] verily verily i say unto you when you
[1:00:13] were young thou gerdest thyself and
[1:00:15] walkest wither thou wouldest
[1:00:17] but when thou art old thou shalt stretch
[1:00:19] forth thy hands and another shall gird
[1:00:21] thee and carry thee wither thou
[1:00:23] would it snout this spake signifying of
[1:00:25] the death
[1:00:27] he should glorify god by what death he
[1:00:30] should glorify god and that always has
[1:00:31] struck me
[1:00:33] what death he should glorify god
[1:00:36] god was glorified in peter being
[1:00:39] obedient
[1:00:40] to death you know we would say well
[1:00:44] i mean peter maybe you could have went
[1:00:45] and had another meeting somewhere that
[1:00:46] would really bring glory to god
[1:00:48] no just do what god told you to do and
[1:00:50] if god wants you to die
[1:00:52] just die it'll glorify god
[1:00:56] you know it's what's what we think is up
[1:00:59] is down sometimes right
[1:01:01] in the kingdom of god
[1:01:04] i just have a couple more jesus said if
[1:01:08] you love me feed my sheep
[1:01:09] and i never did say sheared the sheep he
[1:01:12] said feed the sheep
[1:01:13] he never said educate them he said feed
[1:01:16] them
[1:01:17] well sheep if correctly fed with sheep
[1:01:19] food and what is the sheet food
[1:01:21] the word for man shall not live by
[1:01:24] wor for man shall not live by word alone
[1:01:28] but by
[1:01:28] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:01:30] mouth of god not just one
[1:01:32] then and now and then but every word
[1:01:35] line up online
[1:01:36] here a little and there a little every
[1:01:38] word of it
[1:01:39] give them the sheep food
[1:01:45] the van says you feed my sheep he never
[1:01:48] said drive them sheep or kick them sheep
[1:01:51] feed the sheep that's what sheep needs
[1:01:54] is some sheet food he never kicked peter
[1:01:57] never kicked him never said you no good
[1:02:00] nothing you
[1:02:01] no just fed him
[1:02:04] reminded him of his calling and you know
[1:02:07] the best sheep food i know
[1:02:08] when a a sick is a sick when you
[1:02:11] have a sick sheep
[1:02:13] and is to just get them a great big
[1:02:16] basket full of the bread basket of god
[1:02:19] that word of god man shall not live by
[1:02:22] bread alone but
[1:02:23] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:02:24] mouth of god when you're down and
[1:02:26] spiritually sick
[1:02:27] go turn on a tape go call a brother
[1:02:31] call a real sense here brother say
[1:02:33] brother what you reading
[1:02:34] i've done it many times and like well
[1:02:37] i'm rough rough times just
[1:02:39] we were talking about that brother shy
[1:02:40] right just call a brother
[1:02:42] what you've been feeding on i want to
[1:02:45] lick off of you for a little bit because
[1:02:46] i know there's some vitamins on that
[1:02:48] rock of revelation you're
[1:02:49] you've been feeding on and i need to
[1:02:51] lick it off you because i just ain't got
[1:02:52] no much strength right now
[1:02:54] remember brother bam talks about they
[1:02:55] got real sick sheep there would be a
[1:02:57] certain
[1:02:57] rock with the right minerals that that
[1:02:59] sheep needs to get well
[1:03:01] there's a certain rock of the revelation
[1:03:02] of jesus christ that'll bring you out of
[1:03:04] whatever spiritual amnesia you've got
[1:03:06] just sometimes got blue honey on it to
[1:03:08] get them to start licking right
[1:03:10] so maybe we just get all in the honey
[1:03:11] honey jar of the word of god and just be
[1:03:13] ready
[1:03:14] when we come in contact with the sick
[1:03:16] sheep don't have to kick them don't have
[1:03:17] to criticize them don't have to say hey
[1:03:19] why don't you get out of that why don't
[1:03:20] you stop for no
[1:03:21] i bet you i know the way to get them out
[1:03:23] of that you just share the revelation
[1:03:25] you've been feeding off of and i
[1:03:27] guarantee it has an effect
[1:03:29] has an effect
[1:03:34] now brother branham says now if you're a
[1:03:36] preacher you get a pulpit
[1:03:38] if you're not live your sermon see
[1:03:40] that's the best way that you can do it
[1:03:42] you live your sermon if you're a
[1:03:44] preacher get a pulpit
[1:03:45] and go preaching if you're not just live
[1:03:48] your sermon
[1:03:49] let your life be your pulpit so you got
[1:03:52] the opportunity to keep feeding the
[1:03:54] sheep
[1:03:56] you just live that word
[1:04:01] now has a couple little portions here
[1:04:02] for us
[1:04:04] as sheep as this pastor sheep are real
[1:04:06] funny little creatures brother bam says
[1:04:08] here's another thing we might learn from
[1:04:10] the sheep tonight when the weather
[1:04:12] is real hot did you ever see what see
[1:04:14] sheep
[1:04:15] they will not separate themselves
[1:04:18] they will not separate themselves and
[1:04:20] one go to one place and another one go
[1:04:21] to another place
[1:04:22] but right there in the heat of the day
[1:04:25] the sheep will all stand together
[1:04:26] what are they doing they're making shade
[1:04:28] one for the other see they're having
[1:04:30] fellowship and wouldn't it be good if
[1:04:33] all of god's sheep when the real heat is
[1:04:35] on would just stand together
[1:04:37] when the trials are real hard and the
[1:04:39] heat is on everything going
[1:04:41] on everywhere if all of god's little
[1:04:44] sheep would just stand together
[1:04:46] we'd have a coolness of the shade of one
[1:04:48] another
[1:04:49] a real comfort and ability to lean on
[1:04:52] one another
[1:04:53] now someone said is that necessary
[1:04:55] brother brown
[1:04:56] it certainly is there is nothing like
[1:04:59] having a real
[1:05:00] good dependable friend that when the
[1:05:03] troubles are blazing
[1:05:04] and the heat is on you can go to that
[1:05:06] friend
[1:05:07] and sit down and explain it to them and
[1:05:10] talk it over in personal confidence
[1:05:12] then kneel down and pray together and
[1:05:15] know that person is a real
[1:05:16] good god saved man and woman that you
[1:05:19] can put confidence in
[1:05:20] oh it's good let us come together the
[1:05:23] bible says
[1:05:24] let us stand together i like that
[1:05:31] yeah i'm not going to criticize if
[1:05:33] someone walks away
[1:05:35] her hat feels to separate i'm just going
[1:05:37] to stand by him
[1:05:39] i'll just go cast some shade on him
[1:05:40] maybe the heat of the trial is getting a
[1:05:41] little hot i'll just go maybe
[1:05:44] give him a little shade you gotta say
[1:05:47] nothing sometimes
[1:05:51] brother bam says here in the orients
[1:05:55] i've seen the shepherd brings them in by
[1:05:56] night and he counts them
[1:05:58] every one that goes in if there's one
[1:06:01] missing he will not lay down
[1:06:03] until he goes out into the deserts or
[1:06:05] wherever those herded lands are
[1:06:06] and he'll find that sheep and he'll lay
[1:06:08] it over his shoulders and he'll bring it
[1:06:10] on into the fold
[1:06:11] then the shepherd lays himself down at
[1:06:13] the gap he is the door to the sheepfold
[1:06:16] there's no other no no other
[1:06:20] it's a corral to go over it
[1:06:23] and nothing can come to those sheep
[1:06:26] until it crosses
[1:06:27] over that shepherd what a relief that is
[1:06:30] what a loving thing to know that when we
[1:06:32] are
[1:06:32] tucked into his blessed keeping he
[1:06:35] becomes the door
[1:06:36] and there's nothing that can happen to
[1:06:38] you no matter what it is
[1:06:41] it'll all have to come by that shepherd
[1:06:44] if it's sickness
[1:06:45] it might be for your correction it might
[1:06:47] be for a testimony against the enemy
[1:06:50] it might be for an exaltation of
[1:06:52] christ's name
[1:06:53] but nothing can come to you except he
[1:06:56] permitted it to come
[1:06:57] because he is the door to the sheepful
[1:07:02] i told you i might just tell you i'm
[1:07:04] just happy to be a christian
[1:07:06] i'm just happy to be a sheep of his
[1:07:08] pasture i know who's watching the door
[1:07:13] musicians will you come
[1:07:19] i brother brown tells this story i think
[1:07:22] a few of you know it
[1:07:23] he said i was driving further and i saw
[1:07:25] some shepherds coming down the street
[1:07:28] and there they put their vegetables and
[1:07:30] so forth right on the street and all
[1:07:32] their goodies
[1:07:33] and here come right down the middle of
[1:07:34] the street a shepherd walking through
[1:07:36] all these places leading his sheep
[1:07:38] not by a rope they were just following
[1:07:41] him by sight
[1:07:42] well i like that that's interesting
[1:07:45] didn't have to put a rope around me to
[1:07:47] bring me to church
[1:07:48] and put a rope around me to read the
[1:07:50] message didn't have to put a rope around
[1:07:52] me to listen to a tape didn't have to
[1:07:53] put a rope around me to encourage your
[1:07:55] brother
[1:07:56] no i just followed the shepherd i was
[1:07:57] watching what he did and i just did what
[1:07:59] he did
[1:08:00] oh i see i like that i don't have to
[1:08:02] force you to do nothing
[1:08:05] just something behind me pushing me and
[1:08:08] they were just following him by sight
[1:08:09] and i stopped and i was amazed
[1:08:11] as that shepherd walk he could step a
[1:08:13] few steps
[1:08:14] out to one side and then back to the
[1:08:16] other side and the steep
[1:08:17] and the sheep next to him would step out
[1:08:19] and then they would come right back
[1:08:21] and the sheep behind him would follow
[1:08:23] and they followed that shepherd
[1:08:26] the sheep know my voice and i was amazed
[1:08:29] and i said to the good man with me i
[1:08:30] said
[1:08:31] why do they not turn aside and eat some
[1:08:33] of those pears
[1:08:34] they look so beautiful and the things
[1:08:36] that would
[1:08:37] would entice a sheep he said they would
[1:08:40] in no wise touch
[1:08:41] anything until that shepherd first bid
[1:08:43] them to do so
[1:08:45] oh my there you are if god sheep would
[1:08:47] just be so careful about things
[1:08:51] you know that applies to every aspect of
[1:08:53] your and my life
[1:08:54] i'm learning that myself i'm preaching
[1:08:56] to myself right now too
[1:08:58] many things we do is not his will and
[1:09:00] it's not good for us
[1:09:02] and it looks good but if my shepherd if
[1:09:04] the sheep if the if the
[1:09:06] shepherd of this sheep right here says
[1:09:07] don't touch that i've got to be willing
[1:09:09] to say don't touch that
[1:09:11] i got to leave it alone and just follow
[1:09:14] in his footsteps he knows what's good
[1:09:16] for me
[1:09:17] he knows what's good for the sheep he
[1:09:18] knows exactly what i have need of
[1:09:20] and when i have need of it so i think we
[1:09:23] should consult the lord about
[1:09:25] many more things and maybe sometimes you
[1:09:27] know my wife never just told my says
[1:09:28] i think we've left him out of a lot of
[1:09:30] decisions i think we need to
[1:09:32] include him in a lot more of the
[1:09:34] decisions that we were once just making
[1:09:37] by our human intellect
[1:09:39] i think he wants all of me amen
[1:09:42] not just portions i think he wants all
[1:09:44] of the home all of the family
[1:09:46] every aspect of our lives and then we
[1:09:49] need to
[1:09:50] consult him because he'll many times
[1:09:51] just say no
[1:09:53] i am convinced of that and humanly
[1:09:56] speaking it makes perfect sense
[1:09:57] sometimes
[1:09:58] and god will say don't do it just don't
[1:10:01] do it
[1:10:01] i think sometimes you're just checking
[1:10:02] your obedience i really do
[1:10:05] just obedience obedience is better than
[1:10:07] sacrifice
[1:10:09] one more
[1:10:15] oh where is it
[1:10:18] yeah okay why it had to be shepherds
[1:10:24] they found when they found that baby
[1:10:26] what a joy it must have been to them
[1:10:28] because the angel had given them a
[1:10:30] message and they found that it was
[1:10:32] exactly where the angel said
[1:10:34] it would be it was just in the place
[1:10:36] where the angels said it would be
[1:10:38] what a thing that must have been to them
[1:10:41] it was in a manger
[1:10:42] why see how at ease the herdsmen were in
[1:10:45] the stable
[1:10:46] what do you think a theologian would
[1:10:48] have been
[1:10:50] in there he'd had to put a pen over his
[1:10:53] nose and say get me
[1:10:54] out of this place he would have had been
[1:10:57] he would have wanted to get out of this
[1:10:59] place he'd been in misery
[1:11:01] but you see it was just at home for the
[1:11:05] shepherds
[1:11:06] god knows where to send his message
[1:11:09] see just exactly right in this state of
[1:11:12] shepherds
[1:11:13] was in was in it was in a stable
[1:11:16] with their lamb a vindicated message
[1:11:19] that they had heard how beautiful in the
[1:11:22] presence of the messiah
[1:11:24] the vindicated word of their message
[1:11:27] then the shepherds
[1:11:28] heard that the messiah was on earth and
[1:11:30] they came into his presence
[1:11:32] and they were right in their own
[1:11:34] environment and they found the message
[1:11:36] to be true
[1:11:37] it was vindicated there how that must
[1:11:40] have made them men feel
[1:11:42] to god to find that god had done this
[1:11:45] great thing
[1:11:45] for them why scholars
[1:11:49] would have been so out of their place
[1:11:52] under such circumstances
[1:11:54] they'd a left right quick
[1:11:57] i find this message is not so appealing
[1:11:59] to a lot of people you find that
[1:12:01] really it's not real appealing it's a
[1:12:04] pretty rough way
[1:12:06] it stinks in many people's nostrils
[1:12:09] it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't do
[1:12:12] for them what they want god to do for
[1:12:14] them
[1:12:16] now they just can't stand the thought of
[1:12:17] being disrespected or despised or
[1:12:19] ridiculed and spit upon
[1:12:21] i just can't stand the thought of we're
[1:12:23] just too good for that but the king of
[1:12:25] kings and the lord of lords took it
[1:12:27] i just can't take that kind of a message
[1:12:30] am i be despised be rejected
[1:12:35] the message coming to common herdsmen
[1:12:37] maybe they could have
[1:12:39] um not even some of these herdsmen might
[1:12:41] not have been able to sign their own
[1:12:43] name
[1:12:44] very doubtful you know these herdmen
[1:12:47] that jesus chose when he was here on
[1:12:49] earth to herd his sheep
[1:12:51] he says love is thou me peter more than
[1:12:53] these ye
[1:12:54] lord thou knowest feed my sheep the
[1:12:57] bible said that peter was an ignorant
[1:12:58] and unlearned man
[1:13:00] he was still choosing shepherds amen i'm
[1:13:03] really happy to be one of them
[1:13:06] i'm really really happy to be one that a
[1:13:09] a lamb is precious in the sight of a
[1:13:11] shepherd i'm really happy that this
[1:13:13] message to me
[1:13:14] is precious in my sight it's so precious
[1:13:18] i want to care for it i want to do
[1:13:19] everything i can for it
[1:13:21] and i want to do everything i can for
[1:13:23] everybody else around me that also loves
[1:13:25] this precious lamb
[1:13:26] that we're feeding on will you stand
[1:13:30] it's blooding bleeding word
[1:13:35] it came to the right people at the right
[1:13:37] time
[1:13:39] the right people in the right time he
[1:13:41] knew where to send his word
[1:13:42] where to send his vindicated message

[1:13:51] heavenly father lord we come before you

[1:16:35] think about his grace
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:17:00] foreign
[1:17:06] [Music]
[1:17:15] more is
[1:17:18] oh think about his love
[1:17:23] [Music]
[1:17:24] speak about his goodness
[1:17:30] think about his grace
[1:17:49] [Music]
[1:18:03] [Music]
[1:18:10] is
[1:18:15] even when i
[1:18:17] [Music]
[1:18:24] stray
[1:18:33] [Applause]
[1:18:38] is
[1:19:00] [Applause]
[1:19:07] his goodness
[1:19:12] think about his grace
[1:19:34] foreign
[1:19:44] [Music]
[1:19:48] is
[1:19:52] amen praise god aren't you glad you're a
[1:19:55] sheep
[1:19:57] and you have a father that watches over
[1:19:59] you a good shepherd
[1:20:01] i love what god was saying there at the
[1:20:04] end how god
[1:20:05] brought the message to shepherds because
[1:20:07] shepherds would value the birth of a
[1:20:08] sheep and
[1:20:09] shepherds wouldn't be offended in the
[1:20:12] way the lord came
[1:20:14] [Music]
[1:20:15] you know and in this day we may not have
[1:20:18] known we were shepherds we might have
[1:20:20] known we were sheep we didn't know you
[1:20:22] know
[1:20:22] maybe we may have been acting like goats
[1:20:23] or chickens in a chicken yard or
[1:20:25] you know all the stories that brother
[1:20:26] banhams tells
[1:20:28] but he came in such a way that was
[1:20:31] offensive to denominations
[1:20:33] it was offensive to the intellectual it
[1:20:36] was offensive to so many
[1:20:38] but somehow for us it wasn't offensive
[1:20:41] it just seemed to fit
[1:20:44] amen when he says don't go to jerusalem
[1:20:48] but go to bethlehem and don't go to the
[1:20:51] synagogue
[1:20:52] but go to a stable leave you know leave
[1:20:55] all the systems leave everything leave
[1:20:57] the wisdom leave the learn
[1:20:59] and go into the simplicity and find him
[1:21:01] we said
[1:21:02] amen i can do that
[1:21:06] the shepherd when they went they didn't
[1:21:08] notice the stench
[1:21:10] they didn't notice the humility it was a
[1:21:13] homey feeling to them
[1:21:15] and when we left there all for sake oh
[1:21:18] amen we didn't go to destitution we
[1:21:20] didn't go it may have been humble
[1:21:21] in the world's eyes it may have been
[1:21:23] humility it may have been what they
[1:21:24] would deem
[1:21:25] a maneuver power and a stable but but
[1:21:27] for us it had a homey feeling
[1:21:29] amen because two natures were coming
[1:21:31] together
[1:21:33] he was bringing us back into
[1:21:34] identification
[1:21:36] by this simple humble lamb
[1:21:39] bringing us back into a true identity of
[1:21:41] who we are
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:43] amen i'm just so thankful for what he's
[1:21:45] done for me
[1:21:47] i'm so thankful he put something in me
[1:21:49] before the foundation of the world
[1:21:51] there was only one way to call it and if
[1:21:53] there's only one way to call it in this
[1:21:54] age
[1:21:55] he sent the way amen so these two
[1:21:58] these two parts would come together and
[1:22:00] there would be an awakening in me
[1:22:03] and i would know i have a heavenly
[1:22:04] father and i know i have a good shepherd
[1:22:07] and i would know though through the
[1:22:08] valley of the shadow of death
[1:22:10] i will fear no evil for thou art with me
[1:22:16] i like what the cows said to
[1:22:20] the movement through the valley of the
[1:22:21] shadow of death
[1:22:23] is only a transition from one good place
[1:22:25] to another
[1:22:28] the shepherd is not leading the
[1:22:29] destruction the shepherd is not leading
[1:22:31] to starvation the shepherd's just
[1:22:34] leading from one good pastor to another
[1:22:37] and many times we go through dark places
[1:22:39] in our lives and troubles and
[1:22:40] in transition times that are confusing
[1:22:43] or frightening
[1:22:44] amen but all he's doing is moving us
[1:22:46] through this because he's got something
[1:22:48] else in his foreknowledge he's trying to
[1:22:49] bring us to
[1:22:51] if we could just trust him in those
[1:22:53] times i mean some of you have served the
[1:22:55] lord for decades you realize you can
[1:22:57] look back on your life
[1:22:58] and there was many transition times
[1:23:00] shadowy places
[1:23:01] tight spots amen and every time he
[1:23:04] brought you out to another good pastor
[1:23:06] [Music]
[1:23:08] it's good to have a shepherd it's good
[1:23:10] to be a child of god
[1:23:12] it's good to rest in him and let him be
[1:23:16] in charge
[1:23:17] and i just think it's a good time to
[1:23:19] reflect on that
[1:23:20] it's a good time tonight on a wednesday
[1:23:22] night just to tell him we love him
[1:23:25] for doing all that he's done for us and
[1:23:28] just to let him know
[1:23:29] we're satisfied we're satisfied god with
[1:23:33] the way you chose to do it
[1:23:34] we're satisfied with who we are in the
[1:23:36] age we live in
[1:23:37] where you've placed us and what you're
[1:23:39] doing we're satisfied lord
[1:23:41] we're satisfied that you're a good
[1:23:43] shepherd and we're not just satisfied
[1:23:44] we're
[1:23:45] thankful lord and we're prospering under
[1:23:47] your care
[1:23:48] [Music]
[1:23:49] amen let's just sing this song again as
[1:23:51] we're dismissed you'll be dismissed in
[1:23:53] the name of the lord but sing this
[1:23:55] and let's be satisfied and thankful and
[1:23:57] worship him with a heart full of
[1:23:59] gratitude
[1:24:00] amen like the sins
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:08] think about his goodness
[1:24:14] think about his grace
[1:24:19] that's brought us through
[1:24:22] [Laughter]
[1:24:25] for as high as the heavens of
[1:24:30] us great
[1:24:33] is the measure of our father's
[1:24:42] love

[1:24:48] our father's love
[1:24:55] how could i forget
[1:25:10] is

[1:27:07] my desires
[1:27:11] so think about his love
[1:27:18] think about his goodness
