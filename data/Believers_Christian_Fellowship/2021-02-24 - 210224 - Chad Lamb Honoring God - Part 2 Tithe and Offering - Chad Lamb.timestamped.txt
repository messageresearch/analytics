[6:35] that was a tip off remember it's good to
[6:37] have them here
[6:39] i accuse them of every time they're
[6:40] coming back have another child i don't
[6:41] know that's exactly true but
[6:43] they are coming back with four and so
[6:45] praise god for that god has been good to
[6:47] them
[6:48] amen we're going to continue on from
[6:50] where we were last wednesday in the
[6:52] message i titled honoring god
[6:56] and uh i want to begin here first samuel
[6:58] this is the scripture we started with
[6:59] last time first samuel chapter 2
[7:01] and verse 30. first samuel chapter 2 and
[7:05] verse 30
[7:07] wherefore the lord god of israel saith
[7:10] i said unto thee i said and i said
[7:13] indeed that thy house in the house of
[7:15] thy father
[7:16] should walk before me forever but now
[7:18] the lord saith be it far from me
[7:20] for them that honor me will i honor and
[7:23] they that despise me shall be lightly
[7:25] esteemed let's just bow our heads and
[7:28] pray
[7:29] dear heavenly father we thank you for
[7:30] this word for this opportunity to be
[7:33] here lord we just appreciate it so very
[7:35] much
[7:36] and god we come to this time now where
[7:38] we're looking to you
[7:39] defeat us from the manna from heaven
[7:41] lord while we're not looking to any
[7:43] human being do
[7:44] anything lord because the human being's
[7:46] incapable
[7:48] the lord we're looking to your provided
[7:49] way lord i pray that you would come down
[7:52] with your own hand and
[7:53] feed your sheep today that we might
[7:55] receive from you the portion that we
[7:57] have for this
[7:58] hour we might be strengthened by your
[8:00] word
[8:01] have your way have preeminence among us
[8:03] we pray in jesus christ's name
[8:05] amen you can all be seated
[8:10] amen we started here last time and uh
[8:14] talked about he that honors me
[8:18] will i honor and he that despise me
[8:21] shall be lightly esteemed and so we
[8:23] talked about many things and i'm going
[8:25] to
[8:26] back up and kind of do just a little bit
[8:29] of a review lay again a little bit of a
[8:31] foundation and move on to the next one
[8:33] but i'm going to end up preaching on a
[8:34] subject that i don't know that i've ever
[8:36] preached on before i've touched on it
[8:38] but i wanted to preach on tithe and
[8:40] offering and tithe and offering is not
[8:42] something that's fun for a preacher to
[8:43] preach on especially a pastor
[8:45] it's an uncomfortable thing but it's
[8:48] still part of the gospel and it's
[8:49] needful
[8:50] and when i didn't mean to go into that i
[8:52] was just searching something else and
[8:53] god
[8:53] caught my attention with something and
[8:55] it was profound to me and i really
[8:56] appreciated it and
[8:58] once i saw that it became easy for me to
[9:00] preach on the subject
[9:01] so we're going to wind up there but i
[9:03] want to back up a little bit and talk
[9:04] about this
[9:06] honoring god who you who honors me i
[9:08] will honor and he that despise me
[9:10] shall be lightly esteemed let's turn
[9:13] while we're in sir samuel over to first
[9:14] samuel 24.
[9:16] i want to look at a couple of examples
[9:19] out of david's life
[9:21] as we lay the foundation here and move
[9:23] on
[9:24] first samuel 24 and verse 4.
[9:30] now in in this part of samuel david
[9:33] has already been anointed king he has
[9:35] already been with saul saul he's been
[9:38] one of saul's
[9:39] uh mighty men of valor he put him as a
[9:42] captain
[9:42] in the army and he's had a lot of
[9:44] victory and then all of a sudden saul's
[9:46] jealousy rose up and
[9:47] he becomes jealous of david and he
[9:49] starts to attack david physically and
[9:51] threaten david and david's on the run
[9:52] and
[9:53] and saul is chasing him from place to
[9:55] place
[9:56] well david happens to be hiding in a
[9:57] cave that saul comes into
[9:59] amen and this is where we pick up the
[10:01] story and saul is asleep in the cave
[10:03] where david and his men are
[10:05] and let's look at verse 4 and the men of
[10:07] david said unto him behold the day of
[10:09] which the lord said unto thee behold i
[10:11] will deliver thine enemy into thine hand
[10:13] that thou mayest do to him as it shall
[10:16] seem good unto thee
[10:17] then david arose and cut off the skirt
[10:19] of saul's robe
[10:20] privily now he all his friends david's
[10:24] mighty men and his friends that are with
[10:25] him are saying
[10:26] this is the day this is your deliverance
[10:29] god said he'll deliver your enemies
[10:30] go get him god's brought him right into
[10:32] your hand
[10:34] and he went down there and he didn't
[10:36] kill saul but he just cut
[10:37] the the edge of his skirt
[10:40] uh in verse five
[10:44] and cut off saul's skirt in verse six
[10:45] and he said unto his men
[10:47] the lord forbid that i should do this
[10:49] thing unto my master
[10:51] the lord's anointed to stretch forth my
[10:54] hand against him seeing he is the
[10:56] anointed of the lord
[10:57] so david stayed his servants with these
[10:59] words and suffered them not to rise
[11:01] against saul
[11:02] but saul rose up out of the cave and
[11:04] went on his way
[11:06] so david told him he said don't do this
[11:09] far be it for me to do this to the
[11:10] lord's anointed and we realize that the
[11:13] attitude of
[11:14] david david would not do this because of
[11:16] the lord not because of saul
[11:19] saul was not worthy of this kind of
[11:21] treatment saul and his attitude saul and
[11:23] his
[11:24] uh and his and his conduct he was
[11:27] worthy of the repercussions of david
[11:30] he had done evil to david he had done
[11:33] wrong to david
[11:34] and he deserved whatever he was going to
[11:36] get in the way of deserving something
[11:38] but david it wasn't for the merit of
[11:40] saul that he withheld his hand
[11:42] it wasn't because of saul's nature or
[11:45] even his love for saul
[11:46] but it was his love for god he loved god
[11:48] more than he loved anything else and he
[11:50] honored god
[11:51] because god had anointed this man to be
[11:53] king and i will not touch
[11:54] whom god has anointed it was him
[11:57] honoring god not him honoring saul
[12:02] see this is why david was a man after
[12:04] god's own heart
[12:06] but now let's go to his failure here in
[12:08] second samuel ii samuel chapter 12.
[12:11] we read this scripture last time but i
[12:12] want to bring it to your memory again
[12:15] ii samuel chapter 12
[12:22] and verse 9. wherefore how thou despised
[12:26] the commandment of the lord
[12:28] to do evil in his sight thou has killed
[12:31] uriah the hittite with the sword and has
[12:32] taken his wife to be thy wife
[12:34] and has slain him with the sword of the
[12:37] children of ammon
[12:38] now therefore the sword shall never
[12:39] depart from thine house because thou has
[12:42] despised
[12:43] me and has taken the wife of uriah the
[12:45] hittite to be thy wife
[12:48] see when we look at the story
[12:51] in just in a human carnal way as we look
[12:53] at the story
[12:54] we would think that david had wronged
[12:57] uriah
[12:58] that he had despised uriah but when god
[13:01] looks at this story and although that's
[13:03] still true
[13:04] god takes a personal offense to david's
[13:06] actions
[13:07] and says why did you despise me when you
[13:09] did this
[13:11] see to honor god amen is critical and
[13:15] the the despise god is to not
[13:18] honor his word and not obey his word and
[13:20] not keep his commandments
[13:21] is to despise god so david here was
[13:24] honoring god
[13:24] by honoring god's anointed but here he
[13:27] was despising god by breaking god's
[13:29] commandment
[13:30] so we find out for us to honor god as we
[13:33] honor god by his word
[13:34] amen honor god according to his word and
[13:37] we dishonor god we dishonor god by
[13:39] dishonoring his word
[13:41] it becomes really simple now amen and
[13:44] it's not
[13:44] it's not it's not even so much about
[13:47] doing right acting right speaking right
[13:49] it's about understanding who god is and
[13:52] loving god right and giving god his
[13:54] first place
[13:56] because you know in in religion we can
[13:58] get into religion into a religious mode
[14:00] where we think we can be honoring god
[14:03] amen by doing right speaking right
[14:05] acting right and
[14:06] living right and all these other things
[14:07] but we can be doing that and still not
[14:09] honoring god
[14:11] because it goes deeper everything we're
[14:13] understanding now
[14:14] and the reason i wanted to bring this
[14:16] last time and this time
[14:17] is it goes deeper than what's just on
[14:19] the surface
[14:21] what's just on the surface all the
[14:22] christian picks up amen but for the
[14:24] child of god
[14:25] amen all these things go deeper amen
[14:28] it's a love between you and god
[14:30] i won't honor i will not dishonor god
[14:32] because i love him amen not just because
[14:34] i fear repercussions or just because i
[14:36] free
[14:37] fear hell but it's my love for him that
[14:39] causes me to honor him
[14:44] let's go to isaiah 29.
[14:48] there's two scriptures i want to compare
[14:50] so i'm going to have you first turn to
[14:51] isaiah 29.
[14:58] isaiah 29 and verse 13.
[15:02] but i want you to hold your place in
[15:04] isaiah 29 and 13
[15:06] and go ahead and turn to matthew 15
[15:09] and hold your finger if you can in both
[15:11] of these places we'll start by reading
[15:13] in isaiah but then we're going to come
[15:14] to matthew 15 quickly
[15:17] so matthew chapter 15 verse 7 will be
[15:20] the next reading
[15:21] so if we found that let's go back to
[15:23] isaiah 29
[15:25] and 13. isaiah 29 and 13 says wherefore
[15:28] the lord said
[15:31] for as much as this people draw near me
[15:34] with their mouth
[15:35] and with their lips do honor me better
[15:38] remove their heart far from me
[15:40] and their fear toward me is taught by
[15:42] the precept of men
[15:45] now he he's speaking through isaiah and
[15:47] he says these people
[15:49] they draw near me with their mouth we
[15:52] call it giving lip service
[15:55] they draw near me with their mouth and
[15:57] with their lips they do honor me
[16:00] they're saying the right thing
[16:03] what they're saying sounds right they're
[16:05] saying the right thing
[16:07] he said but their heart that's the
[16:08] problem he says their heart
[16:12] they have moved they have removed their
[16:14] heart far from me
[16:16] and their fear toward me is taught by
[16:18] the precept of men
[16:19] so their fear honor or reverence and all
[16:21] towards me is taught by the precept of
[16:23] men
[16:23] it's not coming from the heart it's
[16:25] coming from the rules
[16:28] let's pick this up over in in matthew 15
[16:31] jesus is going to quote this same
[16:33] scripture in matthew 15 verse 7
[16:37] he says ye hypocrites well did isaiah
[16:39] prophesy of you saying
[16:41] this people draw nigh unto me with their
[16:43] mouth and honor me with their lips
[16:44] but their heart is far from me but in
[16:47] vain they do worship me teaching for
[16:49] doctrines the commandments
[16:50] of men this is what jesus was dealing
[16:54] with
[16:54] they had had a religious system so long
[16:57] that the religious system had
[16:59] taught men how to honor god with their
[17:02] lips
[17:05] how to honor god and they had they had
[17:08] sacrifices and ceremonies and washings
[17:11] and
[17:11] and feast and they had all of that and
[17:13] it was given by god
[17:14] and then men through their own reasoning
[17:16] they would con they would attach
[17:18] extra things onto the things that god
[17:20] had given them and they came up with a
[17:22] whole order where men were now
[17:23] fearing the lord by precept or teaching
[17:25] of men
[17:27] and now they would keep the order they
[17:29] would keep the
[17:30] order of the church and they in the
[17:32] washing of hands and the washing of pots
[17:34] and
[17:34] and the serving and all the extra things
[17:36] that were added on
[17:37] by the by the by the priest over the
[17:40] hundreds of years that they've been
[17:41] adding on to this
[17:42] and now they have been taught they've
[17:44] been taught to fear
[17:46] the fear of the lord by the precept of
[17:48] man
[17:49] i must wash hands to be pleasing to the
[17:51] lord i must give this
[17:52] offering i must do this and i must say
[17:54] this and i must attend this
[17:56] amen and we have absolutely done the
[17:59] same thing in christianity
[18:03] but their heart wasn't in it amen and
[18:05] god said amen your tables have become
[18:07] full of vomit to me
[18:08] god despised even the offering they were
[18:11] giving because they were only doing it
[18:12] by commandment they were
[18:14] only doing it by order they were only
[18:15] doing it by church system
[18:17] but it wasn't a reverence in their heart
[18:19] for god
[18:21] there was no honor in their heart for
[18:22] god and god
[18:24] and he looked past all of that and it
[18:26] didn't matter
[18:27] uh how right the conduct and correct to
[18:29] the teaching and
[18:31] and the honor with the mouth amen god
[18:33] was saying your heart is far from me
[18:35] you're not honoring me and fearing me
[18:36] from the heart you're honoring and
[18:38] fearing me from the outward
[18:40] commandments rules and all of these
[18:42] other things
[18:44] but god wants a deeper honor than that
[18:47] he wants more than that
[18:50] amen
[18:54] brother brother brahms says in the
[18:56] message god's power to transform
[18:59] i read this before but there's a phrase
[19:00] i grabbed out of this and i want to
[19:02] refresh your memory with this also
[19:05] so which is all right to have wisdom but
[19:07] if the wisdom is contrary
[19:08] if the wisdom isn't correct wisdom from
[19:10] god divine wisdom
[19:12] and becomes natural wisdom i don't care
[19:14] how much science we have and want more
[19:16] education it's of the devil
[19:18] i'll prove it to you the lord willing in
[19:19] a few minutes it's of the devil
[19:21] civilization is of the devil i just got
[19:24] through preaching on that
[19:25] all culture in the earth all powers of
[19:27] science and everything is of the devil
[19:29] it's his gospel he preached of knowledge
[19:32] in the garden of eden
[19:33] and he has took that knowledge perverted
[19:35] knowledge
[19:37] contrary to the word and will and plan
[19:39] of god that's the phrase that i
[19:41] we grabbed last time and repeated over
[19:43] and over but i want to lock that in
[19:45] his perverted knowledge was contrary to
[19:47] the word
[19:48] the will and the plan of god and i think
[19:51] what's been given to us this day
[19:53] is not a new church system the message
[19:56] is not a new church system
[19:58] not a new denomination not a new set of
[20:00] rules or
[20:01] code of conduct or our mode of operation
[20:04] what it is it brought
[20:05] back the mind of god so that we would
[20:07] have the word with the will
[20:09] and the plan of god so that we would be
[20:12] able to take every commandment deeper
[20:15] amen
[20:15] everything we there's a greater
[20:17] understanding amen because god has
[20:19] opened himself he's
[20:20] it's the unveiling of god god has
[20:22] revealed himself he's revealed his plan
[20:24] the mystery of god amen has been
[20:27] unsealed
[20:28] has been revealed amen and it gives us
[20:30] more than a
[20:31] new set of doctrine or a new set of
[20:34] rules or a new church order
[20:37] but if all the message becomes is a new
[20:40] church order or the best church order or
[20:43] the correct church order
[20:44] we could find ourselves in the same
[20:46] place amen the jews found themselves
[20:48] when
[20:49] in jesus day because if it's just an
[20:51] exchange of a baptist order or a
[20:53] pentecostal order for a message order
[20:57] then we've done the exact same thing but
[20:59] god didn't want to give us a new order
[21:01] he wanted to reveal himself to us so
[21:03] that we would know him that we would
[21:04] know the why behind the why
[21:06] behind the why why
[21:09] because this is time for uniting amen
[21:11] christ is uniting with his bride
[21:12] he's whispering the love secrets in her
[21:14] ear he's telling her
[21:16] why he's showing her his word and his
[21:18] will and his plan
[21:19] and his plan and for her when she
[21:21] catches the word the will and the plan
[21:23] of god
[21:24] amen it is no struggle amen to follow
[21:27] the commandments of the lord
[21:29] the struggle goes away because now all
[21:31] of a sudden you understand
[21:32] what he's saying why he's saying it what
[21:35] it means
[21:38] amen so he he took his knowledge
[21:42] perverted knowledge contrary to the word
[21:44] and the and will and plan of god and now
[21:46] he had
[21:47] he has had six thousand years to do just
[21:49] exactly what god did
[21:51] you notice satan is always a copycat
[21:55] he's not original in any way he just
[21:57] takes what god does he copies god only
[21:59] does it in a perverted fashion
[22:03] and now he has 6 thousand years to do
[22:05] just exactly what god did
[22:07] only in a perverted way so he's done
[22:10] exactly what god did god for six
[22:12] thousand years brought about in eden
[22:14] placed his man there to rule over and
[22:16] and the satan has done the same thing
[22:18] only in a perverted way
[22:20] and he took the same amount of time to
[22:22] bring his own eden and now he has gotten
[22:24] eden here on earth and it's filled with
[22:25] wisdom knowledge
[22:26] that was his gospel at the beginning
[22:28] knowledge wisdom science
[22:29] never did god ever cater to such
[22:33] he says in the message the god of this
[22:34] evil age says civilization
[22:37] knowledge perverts god's word to suit
[22:39] their own taste
[22:41] that's the truth
[22:45] every denomination does the same thing
[22:49] satan then preaches his own gospel of
[22:51] knowledge in his church
[22:52] amen they pervert god's word
[22:55] to suit their own taste and that's why
[22:58] now you can get over 40
[23:00] 000 different flavors
[23:03] baskin robbins can't even come close
[23:07] because whatever flavor of christianity
[23:09] you want to suit you you can find it
[23:12] because you've been taught the man has
[23:14] been taught to the fear of god by the
[23:16] precept of man
[23:19] but their heart is far from him their
[23:20] heart is still in their cells
[23:23] i want to turn to genesis chapter 3
[23:25] there was a thought that i didn't get to
[23:26] fully express and i'm going to back up
[23:29] and hit this and then move on
[23:32] genesis chapter 3 verse 21.
[23:37] we were talking about morality we talked
[23:39] about so many things last time morality
[23:41] and divorce and marriage and
[23:43] illicit relationships and homosexuality
[23:45] transgenderism
[23:49] abortion we talked about all kinds of
[23:50] things and why
[23:52] god hates those things and why they're
[23:54] wrong and we we talked about they're not
[23:56] just wrong
[23:57] because uh they're repulsive they're
[23:59] wrong because they don't match god's
[24:01] word and his will and his plan remember
[24:04] last time we talked about
[24:05] desensitization and how desensitization
[24:07] makes
[24:08] things that were one time sickening
[24:10] normal
[24:12] one time we were repulsed by certain
[24:14] things we saw uh
[24:16] tattoos and piercings and certain
[24:18] lifestyles that were flaunted in front
[24:20] of us
[24:20] they were sickening but but now those
[24:22] things have become normal by
[24:24] desensitization
[24:25] at one time everybody agreed that this
[24:28] was wrong
[24:30] just a few generations ago everybody
[24:31] agreed that this was wrong
[24:33] amen now but by desensitization by the
[24:35] devil creating his own eden and
[24:37] perverting the word of god
[24:38] to suit man's own taste he's now got man
[24:40] to where now
[24:41] now things that were wicked before are
[24:44] now
[24:45] good the things that were good are now
[24:48] evil
[24:49] sounds like the scripture to me
[24:53] and so but we found out we can't
[24:56] we cannot begin to describe to people or
[25:00] explain to people
[25:02] why it's wrong using reasoning
[25:06] statistics intellects
[25:09] uh history none of that matters anymore
[25:13] amen we've had so much evil and so much
[25:15] corruption in the last
[25:16] in my lifetime in the last 40 50 years
[25:19] amen that they now
[25:20] have data to prove that their way is
[25:23] better
[25:27] data can be manipulated right whatever
[25:29] you're looking for you can get it to say
[25:30] what you want
[25:31] and now they can prove alternate
[25:33] lifestyles i mean used to be christians
[25:34] would say
[25:35] it's not healthy amen there's more
[25:37] disease amen the couples don't stay
[25:39] together a long time hey but now they're
[25:41] proving all of that
[25:43] differently by their statistics i don't
[25:45] know where they come from but
[25:46] i don't really care i don't need
[25:48] statistics my point is
[25:50] it wasn't in the original plan of god
[25:52] and if it wasn't in the original plan of
[25:54] god
[25:54] it's wrong if it wasn't part of god's
[25:58] word his will and his plan
[26:00] it's wrong it's contrary to his word his
[26:02] will and his plan
[26:03] it is therefore wrong i don't need
[26:05] statistics i don't need reasoning i
[26:06] don't need proofs i don't need evidence
[26:08] i don't need exhibit a and exhibit b all
[26:10] i need to say is in god's original plan
[26:13] that wasn't what he intended therefore
[26:15] it is wrong
[26:19] and if we try to get sucked into debate
[26:22] amen on anything else than that
[26:24] we're going to eventually find ourselves
[26:26] that we lose because we're not going to
[26:28] be able to out debate the devil
[26:31] and you can't out fact the devil
[26:36] so you might as well just take him to
[26:37] something that defeats him any time
[26:40] under any condition in any place
[26:43] brother brahm told us amen the word will
[26:45] defeat him anywhere
[26:46] anytime under any condition so we just
[26:49] stick with the word of god has been
[26:51] revealed to us in the day by the opening
[26:53] of the seals
[26:53] we know why god did what he did we know
[26:56] what god's heart purpose was
[26:58] what he wanted in creation what he was
[27:00] after what he was expressing
[27:02] and that was what he wanted and that's
[27:04] what he still wants
[27:08] praise god
[27:12] so i want to go back here and look at
[27:14] genesis 3 21
[27:15] after the fall of man the veil of
[27:18] innocence
[27:19] innocency has now been torn and now
[27:22] the the the woman and the man are under
[27:24] a lust veil
[27:26] because of that god is going to
[27:28] institute clothing here
[27:30] in genesis chapter 3 verse 21 said unto
[27:32] adam also and to his wife did the lord
[27:35] god make
[27:35] coats of skins and clothe them so it's
[27:38] interesting that god made coats of skins
[27:41] and clothe them and i told you last time
[27:43] that this word
[27:44] coats in the hebrew is taken from an
[27:47] this is right
[27:48] out of the concordance strong's
[27:49] concordance it says
[27:51] uh this word that's translated codes
[27:55] is from an unused root root word meaning
[27:58] to cover
[28:00] so god's in god's purpose
[28:03] and intent with clothing who created
[28:06] clothing
[28:08] who's the first fashion designer
[28:14] the first one to create clothing started
[28:17] when god did it god did it with a
[28:20] purpose god did it with his will and
[28:22] mind with his plan in mind
[28:24] he did it for his children because they
[28:25] they had lost the veil of innocency and
[28:27] now
[28:27] they were trapped under a lust veil and
[28:29] god was going to now institute something
[28:31] that would be for their protection amen
[28:33] and when he did he put them under coats
[28:35] of skin
[28:36] that coach means to cover our covering
[28:39] and god's intention in clothing was to
[28:42] cover
[28:45] and this is the this is the thing that i
[28:47] wanted to get i wanted to get it to
[28:49] everybody because it's a tool that we
[28:51] can keep in our hands
[28:52] god intended for clothing to conceal
[28:58] right because once the veil of innocency
[29:01] had been torn
[29:02] and they were under a a veil of lust now
[29:05] under a lust veil
[29:06] and now god's intention was to take the
[29:10] body that would be tempting and he was
[29:11] to use clothing to conceal or to cover
[29:15] but remember the devil always does what
[29:18] god does
[29:18] only in a perverted way so now the devil
[29:22] is going to pervert the word of god
[29:24] which will the man a covering for his
[29:26] nakedness
[29:28] and now he's going to take the very
[29:30] covering that god
[29:31] made him and he will pervert the
[29:33] covering and what god intended to
[29:36] conceal
[29:37] the devil will use to reveal
[29:42] see how tricky he is so
[29:45] it's not just about the amount of skin
[29:48] that's covered
[29:51] you see what i mean it's about what was
[29:54] god's original purpose for clothing
[29:56] in him is my attire lined up with god's
[29:59] original purpose for clothing
[30:02] or has the perverted purpose begun to
[30:05] influence me
[30:06] and now i'm taking from the world amen
[30:08] and what god
[30:09] intended to conceal the devil's trapped
[30:11] me into revealing
[30:14] and so i just wanted to give that to you
[30:17] as a tool because i have no desire in my
[30:20] heart to become a fashion police and and
[30:22] start measuring and
[30:23] you know you need this and that and this
[30:25] much fabric and this many inches
[30:27] and to me i don't want to do that that's
[30:29] not my job i don't want to do that amen
[30:31] that's what started
[30:32] you know all these other movements
[30:34] that's gone into legalism amen because
[30:36] now
[30:37] you know we want to make sure we're safe
[30:38] we want to make sure we're all right we
[30:40] don't want to be deceived
[30:41] amen and and so we've come up with one
[30:43] pattern of dress and everybody in our
[30:45] church has to have this pattern of dress
[30:46] and these are the approved colors
[30:51] teaching teaching the fear of the lord
[30:54] by the precept of man
[30:56] that's exactly what that is teaching
[30:59] honor to god by the precept of man
[31:01] and not the original plan and purpose of
[31:04] god give the word amen and let the holy
[31:06] ghost go to work on the word
[31:07] amen and lead and guide you into all
[31:10] truth what did god want amen now that's
[31:12] what i want
[31:15] and then you don't have to explain how
[31:17] many inches this and how many fabric of
[31:19] this
[31:19] and tight and loose and this and that
[31:22] what's the point of explaining it go
[31:23] back to the original the original
[31:25] explains it
[31:27] and under the leadership of the holy
[31:29] ghost when you have the revelation of
[31:30] god
[31:31] on the word of god with his original
[31:32] intent you just say god
[31:34] lead me in your original intent lord
[31:38] and now you have something which to
[31:40] judge amen
[31:41] judge yourself judge your motives judge
[31:44] your clothing judge the influences that
[31:45] are around you
[31:46] now you can stand in front of a mirror
[31:48] and you can say
[31:49] is this god's original intent and
[31:52] purpose and clothing
[31:54] or is this something else and so
[31:58] please don't call me because i don't
[32:01] know
[32:02] i don't care what style
[32:06] before i talked about fashion you know i
[32:08] don't care what fashion trends go as
[32:10] long as it's modest and it matches god's
[32:12] original purpose
[32:13] as long as you don't get caught in the
[32:14] spirit of fashion because the spirit of
[32:17] fashion will take you the wrong way
[32:19] the styles change i mean look around
[32:21] we're not dressed the same way we were
[32:22] in the 70s
[32:26] style change i could care less if they
[32:27] change as long as is what i put on
[32:29] matches god's original intent and
[32:31] purpose
[32:32] i don't even care about the colors just
[32:35] let the lord lead you in his original
[32:37] intent and purpose
[32:39] so don't ask me i don't want to answer
[32:41] any questions
[32:43] i will plead the fifth and point you
[32:44] right back to genesis 3 21
[32:47] and say what i said again that doesn't
[32:50] mean i won't
[32:51] if you really have a question i'll talk
[32:53] to you but don't call me every time you
[32:55] get dressed for church please
[32:59] just let god work on your heart with his
[33:00] original plan and purpose
[33:02] so i just wanted to leave that with you
[33:04] as a tool i want to leave it for for all
[33:06] the brothers and the sisters and the
[33:07] young ones coming up
[33:08] that god's original purpose for clothing
[33:10] was to conceal
[33:11] and the devil's perversion of god's
[33:13] provided way
[33:14] is to reveal
[33:18] praise god now i want to move on
[33:22] in the second seal brother brahm says
[33:25] now watch
[33:26] satan's duty is to pervert the word of
[33:28] god to wisdom's reasoning
[33:31] then he marks his subjects by rejecting
[33:33] the original word
[33:35] that's how he marks the subject by
[33:37] rejecting the original word
[33:38] what did we go back to in genesis 3 the
[33:40] original word
[33:42] and that gets rejected by wisdom's
[33:44] reasonings
[33:46] wisdom's reasoning on clothing was you
[33:47] know well other people are doing it and
[33:49] you know
[33:50] i've got so much surface area of my body
[33:53] covered
[33:55] that's wisdom's reasonings but it gets
[33:58] them to reject the original word
[34:00] the original word comes with the
[34:02] original purpose
[34:04] now brother bram says in enticing
[34:06] spirits from 1955 give me a preacher
[34:08] give me a christian give me a housewife
[34:10] that's a christian give me a farmer or a
[34:12] factory worker that'll put god first in
[34:15] everything
[34:15] i'll show you a man that'll be
[34:17] successful in spite of all the devil can
[34:19] put on him
[34:20] this is what we're coming down to put
[34:23] god first
[34:23] what was the second fold purpose of his
[34:25] threefold plan
[34:27] and then the one purpose the one plan he
[34:28] had in the back part of his mind it was
[34:30] to have preeminence in a body amen and
[34:32] he's doing that now
[34:34] what's preeminence first place in
[34:36] everything
[34:37] and that's what we're desiring to give
[34:39] him amen but if we'll give him first
[34:41] place
[34:42] mother said if you give put god first in
[34:44] everything i'll show you a man that will
[34:46] be successful in spite of all the devil
[34:48] can put on him now let's get into the
[34:50] subject of tithe and offering let's go
[34:52] to malachi
[34:53] malachi chapter 3.
[35:04] malachi 3 many of us know this but i
[35:07] want to go over it together
[35:15] malachi chapter 3 verse 7
[35:21] even from the days of your fathers you
[35:23] are gone away from mine ordinances
[35:25] and have not kept them return unto me
[35:27] and i will return unto you saith the
[35:29] lord of hosts
[35:30] but you said wherein shall we return
[35:33] will
[35:34] a man rob god yet ye have robbed me
[35:38] but you say where and have we robbed
[35:39] thee in tithes
[35:41] and offerings you're cursed with a curse
[35:44] for you have robbed me even this whole
[35:47] nation
[35:49] and i'm going to read two more verses
[35:51] verse 10 bring you all the ties into the
[35:54] storehouse
[35:55] that there may be meat in my house and
[35:57] prove me now herewith saith the lord of
[35:59] hosts if i will not open
[36:01] open you the windows of heaven and pour
[36:03] you out a blessing that there shall
[36:05] not be room enough to receive it and i
[36:07] will rebuke the devourer for your sakes
[36:09] and he shall not
[36:10] destroy the fruit of your ground neither
[36:12] shall your vine cast her fruit before
[36:14] the time
[36:15] in the field saith the lord of hosts and
[36:17] all nations shall call you blessed for
[36:19] you shall be
[36:20] a delightsome land saith the lord of
[36:22] hosts
[36:23] amen i've i've never
[36:26] really taken a service to preach on
[36:28] tithing offerings
[36:30] one because i really never felt the need
[36:31] to because i don't see it as an issue
[36:33] for the believers here me personally i
[36:35] haven't seen it as an issue
[36:37] and but as i was reading and studying
[36:39] and meditating god dropped this in my
[36:40] heart
[36:41] so i want to preach it in a way to
[36:42] encourage you amen because it's very
[36:45] exciting when we begin to look at this
[36:46] scripture and what god has promised us
[36:49] but first he says will a man rob god
[36:52] ye have robbed me when we talk about
[36:54] honoring god
[36:55] i can't think of any worse way amen to
[36:58] show dishonor
[36:59] than to steal from god
[37:02] so we're talking about honoring god amen
[37:05] god has says you have left me amen come
[37:07] back to me
[37:08] return to me and i'll return to you and
[37:09] they say where have we left you and they
[37:11] says
[37:11] shall a man rob god he goes right to
[37:13] this he says shall a man rob
[37:15] god and he says you have ye have robbed
[37:18] me
[37:18] but you say where have we robbed thee
[37:21] in tithes and in offerings
[37:24] you're cursed with the curse if you have
[37:26] robbed me even this whole nation
[37:29] so now he who honors me i will honor but
[37:31] if you despise me
[37:34] i will lightly esteem you what they were
[37:36] showing was they despised god because
[37:37] they weren't keeping his commandment and
[37:39] tithe and offerings
[37:40] and they were cursed with a curse and i
[37:43] began to look at this scripture and it
[37:45] became very fascinating to me
[37:47] because you cannot you cannot steal
[37:51] something that was yours
[37:55] is that true
[37:58] so we have to lose the concept and i
[38:02] know most of us have
[38:03] because of the your lives and i i see
[38:06] the way you demonstrate your faith
[38:08] but we've got to get away from the idea
[38:10] that god wants you to give 10
[38:12] of your money to him
[38:16] because with that mentality if you keep
[38:19] it back you haven't robbed god because
[38:21] it's yours
[38:23] but if you've robbed god it means it
[38:25] never was yours it always was his
[38:28] because you can't rob what's yours
[38:32] so we can't have the mentality god is
[38:34] asking me to give 10
[38:36] of my money to him god doesn't need your
[38:38] money
[38:40] so god is not begging for money
[38:44] god is not in need god is not in need of
[38:47] your money
[38:48] you're in need of a concept here
[38:51] the children of god are in need of a
[38:53] revelation and understanding god is not
[38:56] in need
[38:56] god has never had a need for money or
[38:59] resources if you if you
[39:00] if you if you doubt me just think of
[39:02] this god with his spoken word created
[39:05] everything that exists
[39:08] does he need your money he has never had
[39:12] a need he has never had a lack a for
[39:14] material substance amen
[39:15] god creates it all by his spoken word
[39:18] and then he created it from nothing
[39:19] there was nothing and he created
[39:21] everything that is
[39:22] from nothing by his power of his spoken
[39:24] word god does not need your money
[39:27] you need to understand a principle
[39:31] this is not for god this is for you and
[39:33] i friends
[39:35] so we've got to get away from the notion
[39:37] amen that god is asking me to give 10
[39:39] of my money to him because to start the
[39:42] premise is wrong to begin with
[39:44] because you can't rob what's yours it's
[39:47] not yours praise god
[39:52] and he didn't ask for 10 he asked for 10
[39:56] plus offering
[39:59] 10 still isn't enough because you've
[40:02] robbed me and
[40:03] tithe and offering
[40:08] praise be to god
[40:11] why you just said why does god lay down
[40:14] these principles if he doesn't need my
[40:16] money
[40:17] he doesn't need my resources because
[40:20] we need to understand who's the creator
[40:23] of the world and who gave us
[40:25] everything
[40:28] god when when when when he was bringing
[40:32] the people
[40:33] uh the nation of israel into the land
[40:36] you realize that even to this day that
[40:39] land is not palestinian land
[40:43] that land is not canaanite land that
[40:46] land
[40:46] is not jewish land god
[40:49] calls that his land
[40:54] i don't care what the deed says on your
[40:58] property
[40:59] you didn't create it
[41:03] how can you own what you didn't create
[41:06] only by privilege of the creator
[41:11] the whole world thinks they own god's
[41:13] creation they own poor
[41:14] portions of it i have this field i have
[41:17] this
[41:18] i dug out of the earth and i got the
[41:19] minerals and i i built blocks and i
[41:21] built this tower
[41:22] and i have this factory this is my house
[41:25] and
[41:26] my factory and my this and you don't
[41:28] realize
[41:29] none of it is yours
[41:32] because you didn't create it you're only
[41:34] allowed to possess it by permission of
[41:36] the creator
[41:39] this is the principle that's got to be
[41:40] drove down into us
[41:42] because any time we move off of this
[41:43] principle we are not honoring god and
[41:45] we're not
[41:46] recognizing where the source of
[41:48] everything comes from
[41:50] so when god moved them into the land god
[41:53] moved them into
[41:54] his land amen not their land his land
[41:58] that he gave to abraham and to abraham's
[42:00] descendants
[42:02] but it was god's land to give he didn't
[42:04] give them the canaanite land
[42:08] he gave them his land
[42:12] and when he gave him his land and he
[42:13] moved them into the land he started to
[42:15] give them
[42:16] principles by which they should live and
[42:18] and part of those principles was
[42:19] to take the increase of their flocks and
[42:22] take the increase
[42:23] of their fields and they would give him
[42:24] a tithe of the increase and they would
[42:26] bring it to the storehouse
[42:27] and they would give a tithe to the
[42:29] levites and give an offering into the
[42:30] storehouse
[42:32] now realize god didn't need
[42:35] the grain god didn't need the sheep
[42:41] god needed their understanding
[42:44] he needed their honor he needed their
[42:46] reverence he needed them
[42:48] not just for him for them they needed to
[42:50] understand who he was
[42:53] and that maintains the right
[42:54] relationship
[42:56] you know even the israelite who would
[42:58] move into the land
[42:59] he would begin to sow seed and there was
[43:02] a principle
[43:03] a law of reproduction that was working
[43:06] and the law of reproduction
[43:08] he would take the seed that was
[43:10] germanized by the law of reproduction he
[43:11] would put it in the ground
[43:13] and then the laws that were in nature
[43:15] and then we'd begin to work and
[43:17] and the cycle of the cycle of weather
[43:19] would begin to change and the sun would
[43:21] come and the
[43:22] rain would come and then the mid the the
[43:24] the dermatized seed would begin to
[43:26] sprout forth and then we begin to suck
[43:28] minerals out of the ground and it would
[43:30] begin to grow amen and it was god who
[43:32] created the minerals and god who created
[43:34] the soil
[43:35] god who created the sea god who created
[43:37] the cycle god who put the laws that hold
[43:39] the whole earth
[43:40] together god who created the law of
[43:41] reproduction and the law of increase
[43:45] so the man who would go and work in the
[43:47] field and and he would labor and he
[43:49] would sow the seed and he would keep the
[43:50] weeds out and keep the animals out
[43:52] build a stone fence and do all the labor
[43:54] that he did and he would make this
[43:57] increase in his crop and he would bring
[43:58] it back to god and said
[44:00] god i'm giving you my seed ha
[44:03] you're giving god what i'm giving you a
[44:07] tenth of my seed
[44:08] no you're not that's the principle here
[44:12] you're not giving god anything
[44:16] you're giving back to him honor and
[44:18] reverence
[44:19] and respect
[44:22] you're not giving him material goods
[44:24] amen
[44:25] you're not giving him something you're
[44:27] not giving him anything
[44:28] other than honor reverence and respect
[44:33] i hope that makes sense this is what was
[44:37] becoming alive to me
[44:40] well i worked who gave you life
[44:46] i labored who gave you health who gave
[44:48] you strength
[44:50] in him we move and breathe and have our
[44:52] being amen
[44:54] i did this by my intelligence who gave
[44:56] you intelligence amen who gave you a
[44:58] mind
[44:58] who allowed your mind to work right amen
[45:02] who gave you eyesight amen who gave you
[45:04] breath in your lungs who gave oxygen for
[45:06] you to breathe who created everything
[45:08] and every principle by everything that
[45:09] works by nature works amen it all works
[45:12] by the law and the word of god it was
[45:14] all given by god
[45:15] you have done nothing when it comes down
[45:19] to it
[45:19] you've done nothing on your own he's
[45:21] given you life he's given you strength
[45:23] he's given you a mind he's given you
[45:25] eyes he's giving you hands he's given
[45:26] you feet
[45:27] he's given you material to work with
[45:29] he's given laws by which you can operate
[45:31] under his laws and his laws are so
[45:33] consistent amen because it's his word
[45:35] that it brings forth every time
[45:37] amen and we begin to work in his law by
[45:40] his life
[45:40] by his breath by his strength by his
[45:43] eyesight and we think we're going to
[45:44] give him something we're
[45:46] giving him nothing
[45:49] he's giving us everything
[45:53] and so you see why it is so
[45:56] wicked to withhold the tithe
[46:02] it is so evil i don't say that
[46:06] because i want you to pay more tithes
[46:07] it'll affect me not one drop whether one
[46:10] or two or 10 or 20 of you quit paying
[46:12] ties or don't
[46:14] what it is is it shows a disrespect and
[46:17] dishonor for god
[46:19] that's why it's wicked and that's why
[46:21] it's evil to withhold the tithe
[46:23] and the offering what it does
[46:27] is you begin to take the place of god
[46:31] i worked i earn my money
[46:35] i have sounds like lucifer i will
[46:41] i will i will
[46:48] see when we come to the principles we
[46:51] get down to the core of things
[46:52] we begin to realize
[46:56] every time i open my eyes i can see it's
[46:58] god's grace
[47:01] every time my lungs expand and take in a
[47:04] little bit of air
[47:05] it's by god's grace it's by his laws and
[47:08] by his word and by his will
[47:10] i have nothing i created nothing i've
[47:14] done nothing all i've done is yield
[47:18] surrender take what he's given
[47:21] use it according to his purpose and his
[47:23] plan and when i bring my tithe and
[47:25] offering back to him
[47:26] all i'm doing is acknowledging who has
[47:29] everything
[47:30] and who has given everything
[47:35] praise god i just want to hit
[47:38] so many things in this principle it's so
[47:41] much more
[47:42] than 10 of my income it's not even your
[47:44] income
[47:46] it's just what god's given you and you
[47:49] know it's
[47:49] it's like it's 10 percent
[47:55] and no more
[47:58] 27 32 and a half cents
[48:12] wrong approach
[48:17] because what we're doing when we when we
[48:19] do that with tithe
[48:20] and offering what we're acknowledging is
[48:24] that i have the fear of god by the
[48:25] precept of man i've been taught to give
[48:27] a tithe
[48:28] and so i'm just going to give exactly a
[48:30] tithe and put it in
[48:31] and i'm not even going to be super
[48:32] thrilled about it
[48:35] and it's going to be painful every time
[48:36] i do it
[48:43] do we see the principle do we see how
[48:46] easy it is with denominational and human
[48:48] understanding to miss the principle
[48:53] we do the quick calculation to the penny
[48:56] now some people just like things to the
[48:57] penny and and that doesn't matter
[48:59] because they give an abundance of
[49:00] offering that's not what i'm talking
[49:01] about
[49:02] but i'm talking about when we just
[49:04] barely do
[49:06] what the precept of man has taught us to
[49:07] do
[49:09] just so i'm okay with god that's not
[49:12] honor
[49:13] that's not respect that's not evident
[49:15] reverence
[49:17] so we need to get to the place where we
[49:18] understand where everything comes from
[49:20] and get really happy with joy in our
[49:23] hearts
[49:24] that we get the privilege of recognizing
[49:26] where everything comes from
[49:28] the privilege of i have a privilege of
[49:31] giving baptize and offering according to
[49:33] the will and commandment of god
[49:34] i have some way to express my honor and
[49:38] reverence for god
[49:39] who created all things and sustains all
[49:41] things and sustains my very life
[49:44] and now it becomes now it's not a
[49:46] treasury not a chore not a
[49:48] precept of man that we must keep in
[49:50] order to please god now it becomes
[49:52] something we do with joy amen with
[49:54] expectation because
[49:55] this is how i show god that i know who
[49:58] he is
[49:58] and i know what he's given me and i know
[50:00] how much i love him
[50:02] it becomes a form of worship it becomes
[50:04] a form of
[50:05] adoration
[50:08] amen i really want to labor on the
[50:11] principles i'm going to get into some
[50:12] details that brother branham gives us so
[50:14] that we just understand
[50:15] how things are to work but really the
[50:17] principle is what matters most to me
[50:22] amen i'm going to read a couple quotes
[50:24] here out of god being misunderstood from
[50:26] 1961.
[50:30] he says but now this is a question he's
[50:33] getting
[50:34] does a christian not get to heaven
[50:36] because they do not pay tithe
[50:39] good question he said i could not say
[50:42] yes
[50:43] or no to that but i do believe that
[50:46] every christian is obligated to pay
[50:48] tithes because it's a commandment of the
[50:49] lord
[50:51] and blessed are they that do all his
[50:52] commandments that they might have a
[50:54] right to enter into life the tree of
[50:56] life now
[50:56] i do believe that tithe paying is
[50:58] essential to a christian experience
[51:02] why is it essential to a christian
[51:03] experience because without it you don't
[51:05] understand who god is and what god has
[51:08] done for you
[51:11] then he goes down a little bit further
[51:12] in the same message he gets another
[51:14] question he's doing our questions and
[51:15] answers here
[51:16] and he says brother branham don't you
[51:18] feel that everyone who claims to be a
[51:20] christian should pay tithes
[51:21] pay their tithe into the storehouse of
[51:23] the lord please give scripture
[51:25] to to this question is that all right
[51:28] that's right that's that the bible said
[51:31] in malachi the fourth chapter
[51:32] will a man rob god and you say where
[51:34] have we robbed thee in tithe and
[51:36] offerings
[51:37] bring all your tithe and offering into
[51:38] my storehouse and prove me saith the
[51:40] lord
[51:41] if i will not open up the windows of
[51:43] heaven and pour out a blessing that
[51:44] there
[51:44] will not be room enough to receive
[51:47] that's a
[51:48] challenge to to any individual
[51:51] and if only i had time we would not get
[51:53] to this little scripture that i wish to
[51:54] get to
[51:55] in about the next 10 minutes i would
[51:57] like to give you a personal testimony of
[51:59] how that i was even hungry
[52:00] my mother and them hungry and my daddy's
[52:02] sick but i took my
[52:04] tithes on ties out first and give it to
[52:06] god
[52:07] and you ought to see what happened i
[52:09] have never seen in my life
[52:11] that any man or a woman that if they
[52:13] only make one dollar a week
[52:14] will bring that 10 cents of that money
[52:16] and put it into your storehouse your
[52:18] church where you come
[52:19] if god don't bless that call me a
[52:21] hypocrite
[52:22] yes sir that's a challenge to anybody
[52:25] and every christian
[52:26] that goes into the that goes to this
[52:29] other question every christian should
[52:31] pay tithes that's right
[52:32] it should be done now brother branham is
[52:35] talking about the promise that comes
[52:37] with it so i want to come back to
[52:38] malachi 4
[52:39] and look at this again and i want to
[52:41] look at verse
[52:42] 10. he had just finished saying you've
[52:44] been withholding the tithes you've
[52:45] robbed me
[52:46] and you're cursed with the curse this
[52:48] whole nation but he comes to verse 10
[52:50] and he says bring you all the tithes
[52:52] unto the storehouse
[52:53] that there may be meat in my house and
[52:55] prove me now herewith saith the lord of
[52:57] hosts
[52:58] if i will not open you the windows of
[53:00] heaven and pour you out a blessing that
[53:02] there shall not be room enough to
[53:03] receive it
[53:05] and i will rebuke the devourer for your
[53:07] sakes and
[53:08] he shall not destroy the fruits of your
[53:10] ground neither shall your vine
[53:12] castor fruit before the time in the
[53:13] field saith the lord of hosts
[53:15] and all nations shall call you blessed
[53:17] for you shall be a delight in some land
[53:19] saith the lord of hosts god is
[53:23] now listen this is amazing
[53:26] god says you're robbing me of tithe and
[53:28] offering
[53:30] so if you're robbing god you've stolen
[53:32] what's his
[53:35] he's not asking you to give him anything
[53:38] he's asking you to give
[53:39] back what's already his and he's
[53:42] promised to bless you
[53:47] you know if i gave you 10 bucks i said
[53:50] here hold this for me i don't have any
[53:51] pockets
[53:53] here's 10 bucks and i come to you later
[53:55] and i say can i have my 10 bucks back
[53:57] and you give me 10 i'm not going to say
[54:00] i
[54:00] thank you here's a 5.
[54:05] you get the point but god so
[54:08] loves the reverence the respect the
[54:11] understanding he said if you get this
[54:13] part right
[54:14] if you understand i will bless you amen
[54:16] your vine will not cast forth early amen
[54:19] i will not let the devourer destroy
[54:21] amen i will bless you if you just honor
[54:24] reverence and respect me and understand
[54:26] where everything comes from
[54:29] now when i look at malachi chapter 3
[54:33] there's of course there's a rebuke there
[54:35] of course there's a curse there
[54:37] but that's not the part that gets me
[54:38] excited what gets me excited is when he
[54:40] begins in verse 10.
[54:42] god himself what he does is he fills out
[54:45] a contract
[54:47] he takes a contract a binding contract
[54:51] and he lays it right in front of you
[54:55] and he's saying do you want to sign it
[55:01] is that what he's done in malachi he's
[55:05] made himself a
[55:06] binding contract he said prove me
[55:11] see if i won't pour out a blessing that
[55:13] you cannot contain
[55:15] this is a contract friends and this
[55:18] contract
[55:19] in order to seal the contract all you
[55:22] have to do is give the tithe an offering
[55:24] that's your signature on the contract
[55:27] and if you sign this contract god
[55:30] himself
[55:31] has obligated himself to this contract
[55:34] and all you had to do
[55:36] amen in order to initiate the contract
[55:39] and the action
[55:40] was to give the tithe and the offering
[55:41] and when you give the tithing offering
[55:43] you put god into action because his word
[55:45] won't fail his promises
[55:47] won't fail amen he will never fail to
[55:49] keep his into the bargain
[55:50] amen and when you give your 10 percent
[55:53] and an offering
[55:54] what you have done you know none of this
[55:56] money is
[55:57] ours we've established that we all
[55:59] understand that we're all in agreement
[56:01] it's not our
[56:02] that god has allowed us energy strength
[56:04] jobs all of these resources so that we
[56:06] can have some goods
[56:07] and then it all comes from god amen it's
[56:09] not ours but god is going to ask us
[56:12] to return unto him a portion to signify
[56:14] that we know where this come from and
[56:16] who he is and that we give honor and
[56:17] respect unto him
[56:18] and in return he says i will let you
[56:21] keep
[56:23] 80 to 90 percent depending on how much
[56:26] your offering is
[56:28] i will let you keep the rest
[56:32] but the 10 in the offering you give to
[56:34] me
[56:35] is security against the rest that you
[56:38] won't lose the rest
[56:40] i'll prosper the rest i'll bless the
[56:42] rest i'll grow the rest of
[56:44] it and it's not yours anyways
[56:48] this is the best deal going if you could
[56:51] find a business model like this you
[56:52] would sign people up in droves
[56:55] it can't fail it won't fail it's a
[56:58] promise of god in the word of god and
[57:00] all he's asking for you to do is catch a
[57:01] revelation of who he is and where
[57:03] everything comes from who the creator is
[57:05] and who god is
[57:07] and to acknowledge it amen by signing
[57:09] the contract by getting yourself
[57:11] in contract with god by paying the tithe
[57:14] and the offering and whatever he's
[57:16] allowed you to remain
[57:17] he says now i'll bless it i'll prosper
[57:20] it i'll stop the devourer from taking
[57:21] from it i'll plug your bag with holes in
[57:24] it now
[57:29] see when we take the mentality it's mine
[57:33] and god's asking for 10 or more of mine
[57:39] then we now enter into contract with god
[57:41] we have no protection
[57:44] i'm going to ask you what you'd rather
[57:46] have would you rather have 85
[57:49] of your earnings under the protection
[57:50] and prosper prosperity of
[57:52] god's promise or a hundred percent under
[57:55] your own protection
[57:59] which would you rather have now listen
[58:02] you don't have to have
[58:03] you don't have to have a master's degree
[58:05] in finance to understand through this
[58:06] question
[58:08] you have one that has a guarantee by god
[58:11] almighty opponent
[58:12] and you have another one that has no
[58:14] guarantee it's based on your strength
[58:16] your intelligence
[58:17] amen i would say
[58:20] luck but we don't believe in luck but
[58:22] anyways you see what i'm saying
[58:24] circumstances you're taking i'm going to
[58:26] hold 100
[58:27] by having the concept that it's mine or
[58:29] being stingy with god and just barely
[58:31] letting out
[58:31] just enough to keep the precept of man
[58:36] you're not even acknowledging who god is
[58:41] but god said if you'll just acknowledge
[58:43] me
[58:45] i will secure whatever remains
[58:48] it won't get lost it won't be devoured
[58:51] your vine won't cast forth
[58:53] everything that you have will grow
[58:59] i i'm not a business major but i would
[59:02] sign that contract
[59:06] giving up you see realize we come back
[59:10] to human understanding
[59:13] you're giving up nothing to gain
[59:16] everything
[59:19] well no i'm giving up 10 15 to 20 you're
[59:22] giving up nothing it's not yours
[59:28] you're giving up nothing to gain
[59:30] everything
[59:32] to gain god's promise and security over
[59:35] the portion that remains in your hand
[59:38] is now absolutely protected
[59:41] by a promise of god
[59:45] i said god i'm going to sign the
[59:46] contract
[59:48] i'm going to sign the contract and god's
[59:50] not looking for lip service he's not
[59:52] looking for somebody who honors me with
[59:53] their mouth
[59:54] he's looking for somebody who
[59:55] understands who he is and demonstrates
[59:57] it by their obedience to his word
[1:00:00] and says i am so excited i hope what
[1:00:03] happens
[1:00:04] amen next week or next two weeks or next
[1:00:06] month whenever you get paid
[1:00:08] and you go to give the first portion of
[1:00:09] that to god i hope now you fill out that
[1:00:11] check and you're whistling and your
[1:00:13] foot's patting on the ground and you're
[1:00:14] thinking i'm going to secure
[1:00:16] everything that's left over in my
[1:00:18] account
[1:00:19] amen this is the best investment i've
[1:00:21] ever made in my life amen
[1:00:23] all i have to do is give god back what's
[1:00:25] already his
[1:00:26] and the portion of his that he lets me
[1:00:28] keep he's promised to prosper
[1:00:30] protect it shield it from danger protect
[1:00:32] it from loss
[1:00:36] you know when you start with the premise
[1:00:41] god wants me to give him 10 of my money
[1:00:44] you miss the whole point of how loving
[1:00:47] how wonderful
[1:00:48] god is how magnificent and how much he
[1:00:52] loves us and how much he cares for us
[1:00:54] amen we miss the whole picture of who
[1:00:56] god really is
[1:00:58] and how much god loves us when we start
[1:01:00] with the idea
[1:01:01] that god wants me to give him 10 of my
[1:01:03] money
[1:01:04] amen you already have a wrong
[1:01:06] understanding of who god is
[1:01:09] but when you say god is giving me the
[1:01:12] opportunity to express
[1:01:13] my faith in him my love for him my
[1:01:15] appreciation for him
[1:01:17] and god has given me a physical way to
[1:01:19] do this i can't wait to show him i do
[1:01:21] love him i do believe him i do know who
[1:01:23] he is and i know where all blessings
[1:01:25] come from
[1:01:27] and in doing in just in obedience he is
[1:01:30] so good and so wonderful
[1:01:32] that he's promised to take care of the
[1:01:33] rest amen
[1:01:36] you don't need a federally insured
[1:01:39] savings account
[1:01:42] you have a heavenly insured savings
[1:01:44] account
[1:01:46] you don't need the government to protect
[1:01:47] your assets you got god who will protect
[1:01:49] your assets
[1:01:54] praise be to god god's just looking for
[1:01:56] somebody with faith enough to take him
[1:01:58] up on the contract
[1:01:59] not by the precept of man botanize the
[1:02:02] words of their mouth but by the
[1:02:03] expression of faith in their heart
[1:02:06] that they can take god at his word
[1:02:09] man i'm going to read a couple more
[1:02:10] quotes and then i want to get in a few
[1:02:12] more scriptures
[1:02:13] he said message 1959 let us see god
[1:02:17] but you know i feel like this that a
[1:02:19] member of a church their first
[1:02:20] obligation is with their tithe and
[1:02:22] offerings is to support their church
[1:02:24] if you're members of these fine churches
[1:02:26] that's represented here you support your
[1:02:28] church
[1:02:28] that's your first duty to god bring your
[1:02:30] tithe and offerings into the storehouse
[1:02:32] and the storehouse you surely know what
[1:02:34] that is that's where you get your food
[1:02:36] so there's where you get your spiritual
[1:02:37] food and your obligation is to your
[1:02:39] church
[1:02:39] and not to an evangelist like me it's
[1:02:42] taken up somewhere along in the meetings
[1:02:44] when we have campaigns like this where
[1:02:46] you have a little laying aside
[1:02:48] to help support it that takes care of me
[1:02:50] so brother branham is there at a
[1:02:52] campaign meeting that's a gathering of
[1:02:53] many churches that come together to
[1:02:54] support him and he's telling the people
[1:02:56] don't give your tithe an offering to me
[1:02:58] amen you give it to your local church
[1:03:00] the storehouse where you get your food
[1:03:02] see these are still the principles of
[1:03:04] god joseph would tithe an offering
[1:03:06] he says now there's a little bit on the
[1:03:08] side that you've got a little extra you
[1:03:09] give to the campaign that's what helps
[1:03:11] me
[1:03:12] but his brother branham is making the
[1:03:14] first priority of the local
[1:03:16] church that's the story but the man
[1:03:19] tells us in many places that that's the
[1:03:20] storehouse
[1:03:22] now let's go to genesis
[1:03:28] genesis
[1:03:32] chapter 14.
[1:03:44] genesis 14
[1:03:47] and 18.
[1:03:51] and melchizedek king of solomon saw
[1:03:54] salem sorry brought forth bread and wine
[1:03:57] and he was priests of the most high god
[1:03:59] and he blessed him and said blessed be
[1:04:01] abram of the most high
[1:04:02] god possessor of heaven and earth and
[1:04:04] blessed be the most high god which hath
[1:04:06] delivered thine enemies into thy hand
[1:04:08] and he gave him a tithe of all
[1:04:11] so this is the first time that we see in
[1:04:14] the scriptures
[1:04:15] that there's a pang of tithe and it's
[1:04:17] abram and abraham gives ties to
[1:04:18] melchizedek when he meets melchizedek
[1:04:20] who's priest of the most high
[1:04:21] he gives him he gives him tithe of all
[1:04:24] and he's blessed by melchizedek
[1:04:26] and we're going to get into this a
[1:04:27] little bit more but i
[1:04:29] pointed this out to show why brother
[1:04:31] branham is so adamant on paying tithes
[1:04:33] because there's such a discussion in
[1:04:34] christian churches that tithe paying was
[1:04:36] part of the law entire thing was old
[1:04:38] testament
[1:04:39] not new testament but abram precedes the
[1:04:42] law
[1:04:43] so this is before the law and then we
[1:04:45] are all children of abraham by faith
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:48] so abraham is absolutely displaying the
[1:04:52] faith seed amen how the faith seed
[1:04:54] operates and before there was a law
[1:04:57] abraham paid tithe to melchizedek
[1:05:00] so tithe precedes the law so it's not
[1:05:02] just
[1:05:03] the law this was before the law amen so
[1:05:06] it's after the law
[1:05:09] and brother ben's clear on that it's old
[1:05:11] and new testament it's it's a
[1:05:13] it's part of the christian experience
[1:05:16] let's go over to hebrews chapter 7.
[1:05:18] we'll read about this in hebrews chapter
[1:05:20] 7 where paul
[1:05:22] writes about it
[1:05:28] hebrews chapter 7
[1:05:32] and verse 1.
[1:05:41] hebrews 7 and 1 for this melchizedek
[1:05:44] king of salem priest of the most high
[1:05:45] god who met abraham
[1:05:47] returning from the slaughter of the
[1:05:49] kings and blessed him
[1:05:51] to whom also abraham gave a tenth part
[1:05:53] of all
[1:05:54] first being by interpretation king of
[1:05:56] righteousness and after that also king
[1:05:58] of salem
[1:05:59] which is king of peace without father
[1:06:01] without mother
[1:06:02] without descent having neither beginning
[1:06:05] of days nor end of life
[1:06:06] but made like unto the son of god
[1:06:08] abideth a priest continually
[1:06:11] now consider how great this man was unto
[1:06:13] whom even the patriarch abraham gave the
[1:06:15] tenth of the spoils
[1:06:17] and verily they that are of the sons of
[1:06:19] levi who receive the office of the
[1:06:21] priesthood
[1:06:22] have a commandment to take tithes of the
[1:06:24] people according to the law
[1:06:25] that is of their brethren though they
[1:06:28] come out of the loins of abraham
[1:06:30] but he whose descent is not counted from
[1:06:32] them receiveth tithes of abraham and
[1:06:34] blessed him
[1:06:35] that had the promises and without all
[1:06:38] contradiction the less is blessed
[1:06:40] of the better now brother branham is
[1:06:42] going to
[1:06:43] talk about this in the message hebrews
[1:06:45] chapter 7 part 1
[1:06:46] from 1957 he says now watch this if you
[1:06:49] want to see something
[1:06:51] but he whose do sin is not counted
[1:06:55] from them receiveth tithes of abraham
[1:06:56] and blessed him that had the promise
[1:06:59] and brother bram says abraham had the
[1:07:01] promise and this man blessed abraham
[1:07:03] who had the promise who was this the
[1:07:06] sons of levi paid tithes
[1:07:08] or their brethren paid tithes to them
[1:07:10] they had a commandment of the lord to
[1:07:12] take a tenth of what their brothers made
[1:07:14] for their living because they were the
[1:07:15] priesthood now that lets out the
[1:07:17] melchizedek priesthood as you talk about
[1:07:19] right there
[1:07:20] that's right but even the one who had
[1:07:23] the promise the greatest man on earth
[1:07:25] abraham met this man and paid ties to
[1:07:27] him
[1:07:28] he had to be greater listen and without
[1:07:31] any contradiction the less is blessed of
[1:07:32] the better
[1:07:33] certainly watch who he is and here men
[1:07:36] that die receive tithes that's the
[1:07:37] priesthood of the order of the priests
[1:07:39] and preachers so forth
[1:07:40] men that receive tithe die see but here
[1:07:42] he receiveth them of whom and his
[1:07:44] witness that he liveth
[1:07:46] what would a man take tithings for if he
[1:07:49] never was born
[1:07:50] and never will die and was from
[1:07:52] beginning to end and never had no father
[1:07:54] or mother or descent or own the whole
[1:07:56] heavens and earth and all
[1:07:57] why would he take tithe why would he ask
[1:07:59] abraham to pay tithes
[1:08:01] see i love this principle brother
[1:08:03] branham's driving down he said
[1:08:05] why did melchizedek take ties
[1:08:07] melchizedek didn't need tithes
[1:08:10] he had no beginning of days he had no
[1:08:12] ending of life he had no father no
[1:08:14] mother brother bram said whoever he was
[1:08:16] he's still alive today
[1:08:19] and the brother of mum says it this way
[1:08:21] he says
[1:08:22] no father or mother or descent and owned
[1:08:24] the whole heavens and earth
[1:08:26] and all in it why would he take ties
[1:08:29] why would he ask abraham to pay tithes
[1:08:32] you see what a strict thing it is to pay
[1:08:34] tithes
[1:08:36] tithing is right every christian is duty
[1:08:39] bound to pay tithe that's right
[1:08:41] never has been changed brother venom is
[1:08:44] taking us
[1:08:45] back a little bit deeper and he's going
[1:08:47] back before the law
[1:08:48] he's going back to melchizedek who is
[1:08:51] the priest of the most high god
[1:08:52] and we know that that it was a it was a
[1:08:55] pre-figure of jesus christ god come down
[1:08:57] in the flesh
[1:08:58] as the priest of heaven he had no father
[1:09:00] no mother no beginning of days no ending
[1:09:01] of life
[1:09:02] brother ben said he owned all of heaven
[1:09:03] and earth he didn't need
[1:09:05] abraham's tithe
[1:09:09] it wasn't about melchizedek's need it
[1:09:12] was about
[1:09:13] abraham's need
[1:09:18] paying tithe is not about god's need
[1:09:21] it's about your need my need
[1:09:25] amen to recognize who we stand before
[1:09:29] and who's in control of everything
[1:09:32] so why would he ask abraham to pay
[1:09:34] tithes he really said you see what a
[1:09:35] strict thing it is to pay tithes
[1:09:38] brother is bringing us back to the
[1:09:41] principles
[1:09:43] that when he come in contact with god
[1:09:45] and he began to commune and take
[1:09:47] communion
[1:09:48] he paid tithes and when we begin to
[1:09:52] commune with god a sure sign that you've
[1:09:54] met melchizedek that can commune with
[1:09:55] him as you pay tithes
[1:09:58] amen now i'm going to go through some
[1:10:01] more principles that brother benham lays
[1:10:03] out
[1:10:04] he says would it be wrong to use ties on
[1:10:06] church building funds
[1:10:08] he said now here's a touchy little thing
[1:10:10] for the church now
[1:10:12] no correctly tithes go to the minister
[1:10:15] that's right
[1:10:16] in the bible they had a box they set up
[1:10:18] at the door of the old testament in the
[1:10:19] building this box was
[1:10:21] a fund where the people put in there for
[1:10:23] the repairing
[1:10:24] you've read it many times in the old
[1:10:25] testament they kept up the building and
[1:10:27] things like that all the repairs on the
[1:10:28] building
[1:10:29] was taken care of out of the fun but a
[1:10:31] tenth of that tenth
[1:10:32] of the tithings all the tithings went to
[1:10:34] their priest their pastors yes tithings
[1:10:37] are to go for nothing else
[1:10:39] i know people take their ties and give
[1:10:41] them to a widow woman
[1:10:43] that's wrong if you got anything to give
[1:10:46] to the widow woman give her but don't
[1:10:48] give her god's money
[1:10:49] that's not yours in the first place
[1:10:51] that's god's
[1:10:53] if you sent me down down to get a loaf
[1:10:55] of bread and you give me 25 cents to get
[1:10:56] that loaf of bread and i met somebody on
[1:10:58] the street
[1:10:59] wanted something else and i give him the
[1:11:00] 25 cents i give them your money
[1:11:03] if they ask me for something let them
[1:11:05] get it over here
[1:11:06] in this pocket and give them my money
[1:11:08] but this is your money
[1:11:10] and a tenth of it is the lord's and levi
[1:11:12] the priest could live by the tenth
[1:11:14] the tenth is to be a tithing that's to
[1:11:17] be brought into the storehouse
[1:11:18] with a promise of god to bless it and a
[1:11:21] proof he said if you don't believe it
[1:11:23] come and prove me and see if i won't do
[1:11:25] it see that's right
[1:11:26] the tithing goes into the church for the
[1:11:28] pastor and so forth like that to live on
[1:11:31] and the building funds and things like
[1:11:32] that is a separate fund all together
[1:11:35] now that is scriptural i say that
[1:11:37] because it's a question that comes up
[1:11:38] many times
[1:11:39] amen you cannot take your tithe and send
[1:11:42] your tithe anywhere else
[1:11:43] amen the tithe has to come to the
[1:11:45] storehouse amen
[1:11:46] your local church where it's fed amen
[1:11:48] and that tide has to go to the levites
[1:11:51] that's that's the way it's set up that's
[1:11:53] the way brother branham explains it to
[1:11:54] us
[1:11:55] so you can't determine where your tithe
[1:11:57] goes but you can determine where your
[1:11:58] offering goes you can bring it into the
[1:12:00] storehouse and you can say i want to
[1:12:01] give the missions i want to give to the
[1:12:03] general fund i want to give to this but
[1:12:05] tithing is tithing it comes to the
[1:12:07] storehouse and it goes for the levites
[1:12:10] and there's a really good reason for
[1:12:12] that
[1:12:14] i'm going to read this this other quote
[1:12:16] here and then get into this
[1:12:20] 1961 the church choosing law for grace
[1:12:23] god will provide the works if you if
[1:12:25] you'll just walk in grace you'll be more
[1:12:27] at work
[1:12:28] than you are right now with the ladies
[1:12:29] aid society and all this other nonsense
[1:12:31] that's been added to the church
[1:12:32] soup suppers to pay the preacher where
[1:12:34] you'd ever get such a thing as that
[1:12:36] in scripture tithes pay the preacher
[1:12:38] he's delivered by the tithes of the
[1:12:39] people
[1:12:41] i want to pick this up in scripture go
[1:12:42] to first corinthians chapter nine
[1:12:44] we'll see what paul says here in first
[1:12:47] corinthians chapter nine
[1:12:50] and then i want to get to the principle
[1:12:53] so i always like to go deeper than the
[1:12:55] surface
[1:12:56] and go down to the underlying principle
[1:13:01] first corinthians chapter 9.
[1:13:04] verse 9
[1:13:09] for it is written in the law of moses
[1:13:11] thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the
[1:13:13] ox that treadeth out the corn
[1:13:15] does god take care for an auction or say
[1:13:18] it all together for our sakes
[1:13:20] for our sakes no doubt that is written
[1:13:22] that he that plows should plow in hope
[1:13:24] he that thresheth and hope should he be
[1:13:26] partaker of his hope
[1:13:28] if we have sown unto you spiritual
[1:13:29] things is it a great thing if we shall
[1:13:31] reap your carnal things
[1:13:33] if others be partakers of this power
[1:13:35] over you are not we rather
[1:13:38] nevertheless we have not used this power
[1:13:40] but suffer all things
[1:13:41] lest we should hinder the gospel of
[1:13:43] christ do you not
[1:13:45] know that they which minister about the
[1:13:46] holy things live of the holy things of
[1:13:48] the temple
[1:13:49] and they which wait at the altar are
[1:13:51] partakers with the altar
[1:13:53] even so hath the lord ordained that they
[1:13:55] which preach the gospel
[1:13:56] should live with the gospel what paul
[1:14:00] just did right there is he took a
[1:14:02] principle that was laying in the old
[1:14:03] testament
[1:14:04] and he brought it right into the new
[1:14:06] testament
[1:14:08] because he said verse 13 do you not know
[1:14:11] the day which minister about the holy
[1:14:13] things he's talking about the levitical
[1:14:15] priesthood and the levites
[1:14:17] do you not know that they that which
[1:14:19] minister about the holy things
[1:14:20] live of the holy things of the temple
[1:14:22] and they which wait at the altar are
[1:14:24] partakers
[1:14:25] with the altar and then he goes on to
[1:14:28] say
[1:14:29] even so that even so hath the lord
[1:14:31] ordained that they which preach the
[1:14:32] gospel should live with the gospel
[1:14:34] this is a super important principle amen
[1:14:37] because the principle is god
[1:14:39] after after the the pattern is laid down
[1:14:42] with abraham and melchizedek melchizedek
[1:14:44] being priests of the most high god
[1:14:46] then god is going to come along later
[1:14:48] and establish an earthly priesthood with
[1:14:50] men
[1:14:50] and that priesthood is going to be able
[1:14:52] to receive tithes
[1:14:53] and only excuse me only that levitical
[1:14:57] priesthood is going to be able to
[1:14:58] receive tithes
[1:15:00] now you think how important this is if
[1:15:02] there's a commandment to pay ties
[1:15:06] there has to be a way to pay tithes
[1:15:09] you have to be able to get tithes to god
[1:15:12] but how are you going to get your
[1:15:13] physical coins and paper
[1:15:15] to god understand
[1:15:19] when abraham come in contact with god in
[1:15:22] the form of a priest a man and a
[1:15:24] priesthood
[1:15:25] abraham gave the tenth of all to him
[1:15:28] because now he can give to god through
[1:15:31] this priest in flesh and it was accepted
[1:15:35] by who
[1:15:36] it was accepted by god that's why
[1:15:40] brother bannon says your tithe can't go
[1:15:42] to the widow it can't go to this
[1:15:43] it's got to go to the storehouse and go
[1:15:45] for the pastor for the preachers for the
[1:15:47] levites
[1:15:48] because he's picking up paul's principle
[1:15:50] where paul brought it over they that
[1:15:51] preached the gospel must live of the
[1:15:53] gospel those that attend to the altar
[1:15:55] eat of the altar
[1:15:56] amen he's bringing it in because if
[1:15:58] you're going to give god tithes amen
[1:16:00] there's a contract laying there that if
[1:16:02] i give tithes and offerings to god
[1:16:04] if i give god tithes god has secured the
[1:16:06] rest of it so how do i get
[1:16:08] ties to god i've got physical money i
[1:16:12] live in a physical body
[1:16:13] how do i get ties to god the only way to
[1:16:15] get ties to god is find a place where
[1:16:18] god has ordained somebody
[1:16:20] to receive those tithes and when god has
[1:16:23] ordained somebody to receive those
[1:16:25] tithes
[1:16:25] it has closed the loop of blessing for
[1:16:27] you
[1:16:30] that's the scriptures so brother them
[1:16:33] says that's why you can't pay tithes to
[1:16:34] an institution or to an organization
[1:16:37] even if there's not a levite there to
[1:16:38] receive the tithes
[1:16:41] does that make sense this is the word
[1:16:45] that's why we don't just pay tithes into
[1:16:47] an organization and we don't just pay
[1:16:49] tithing to a program
[1:16:50] that's not god's way amen the tithes are
[1:16:53] to go to the levites amen
[1:16:55] to the preachers those that preach the
[1:16:56] gospel live of the gospel
[1:16:58] there has to be somebody that can
[1:16:59] receive tithes
[1:17:01] on behalf of god and tell me
[1:17:04] who can do that today
[1:17:08] we live in a day who can do that only
[1:17:11] god's ordained ministry can do that
[1:17:14] they're the only ones that can do that
[1:17:17] you know
[1:17:18] i say this but for me this is a very
[1:17:20] uncomfortable thing to say
[1:17:22] you know i mean i remember when i first
[1:17:24] became pastor
[1:17:26] amen you have no idea how hard it was
[1:17:28] for me to take tithe
[1:17:29] i would rather work
[1:17:32] but that was back when i had a wrong
[1:17:33] concept of things
[1:17:35] i would rather labor because i felt like
[1:17:37] that was my money
[1:17:40] and i could take my money and do what i
[1:17:41] wanted with it and when i when i thought
[1:17:43] of other people
[1:17:44] laboring other men laboring
[1:17:48] taking what they labored with and what
[1:17:50] they gave to god and now i take that
[1:17:53] and i use it you know for food and i use
[1:17:55] it for housing and
[1:17:56] and and you know what was really hard
[1:17:58] for me is to take a vacation with my
[1:18:00] children with tithe money
[1:18:03] that may sound funny but put yourself in
[1:18:05] that place
[1:18:06] all the men around you are working hard
[1:18:08] and working hard jobs and working
[1:18:09] overtime
[1:18:10] and they're they're struggling and
[1:18:12] they're making it and god's blessing
[1:18:13] them but
[1:18:13] they're taking what what they earn by
[1:18:15] the sweat of their brow they're giving
[1:18:17] it to god you're taking it
[1:18:18] and you're going to go play with your
[1:18:21] children
[1:18:22] for a vacation
[1:18:26] that is so hard harder than you could
[1:18:28] ever imagine
[1:18:31] but if there's not somebody in flesh
[1:18:35] that's been ordained of god to receive
[1:18:37] tithes
[1:18:38] then the contract is not fulfilled
[1:18:44] there has to be there has to be an
[1:18:48] ordained
[1:18:48] way for god to keep the cycle
[1:18:53] there has to be a plan of god for your
[1:18:55] blessings
[1:18:57] and part of that plan is there's got to
[1:18:59] be a storehouse for you to bring
[1:19:01] your tithe and offering to and in that
[1:19:03] storehouse there has to be a priesthood
[1:19:05] there that can receive
[1:19:07] tithe and offering and when i began to
[1:19:11] understand that
[1:19:12] then i began to understand god's
[1:19:14] principles it's deeper it's
[1:19:15] more than just i wish i wish i could
[1:19:18] work and earn my own money that wasn't
[1:19:20] my own money anyways
[1:19:23] it was all a concept in my mind given to
[1:19:26] me by the world
[1:19:29] but those who preach the gospel must
[1:19:31] live off the gospel
[1:19:32] and why amen why is it so important
[1:19:35] there's levites on earth to receive
[1:19:36] tithe
[1:19:37] amen so that the circle of blessing can
[1:19:39] continue so that the contract can be
[1:19:41] fulfilled
[1:19:43] when abraham gave tithe
[1:19:46] he was blessed because there was
[1:19:49] somebody physically there to receive
[1:19:51] them
[1:19:52] there's a there's a symbiotic
[1:19:55] relationship that god wants
[1:19:57] and then god wanted the levites to be
[1:20:01] selected and separated unto him for his
[1:20:04] service
[1:20:06] and in doing that they were serving on
[1:20:08] behalf
[1:20:09] of the whole nation but the rest of the
[1:20:12] nation would support the levites so the
[1:20:14] levites could be separated out
[1:20:15] amen to do what god had called them to
[1:20:17] do amen and they were doing it
[1:20:19] on behalf of the whole nation
[1:20:23] right and they were the only ones
[1:20:25] authorized to receive tithe
[1:20:28] nobody else that's why i stress it's so
[1:20:31] important
[1:20:32] that tithe does not go to organizations
[1:20:34] institutions
[1:20:36] programs they've got to go to the local
[1:20:39] storehouse
[1:20:40] where there's a pastor ministry there
[1:20:42] that can receive tithes
[1:20:44] because that's god's plan
[1:20:48] too many times we get the wisdom of man
[1:20:50] injected and we mess everything up
[1:20:53] amen but that's god's plan and it closes
[1:20:56] the loop
[1:20:58] and it keeps the blessings of god
[1:21:00] flowing
[1:21:02] levi depended on his brethren for his
[1:21:05] support
[1:21:06] and his brethren depended on levi to
[1:21:08] serve in the temple
[1:21:10] it's a symbiotic relationship
[1:21:13] shepherd god has set this up where the
[1:21:15] shepherd is not independent of a sheep
[1:21:18] and the sheep are not independent of the
[1:21:20] shepherd
[1:21:23] where does the shepherd get his clothing
[1:21:26] from the sheep
[1:21:27] where does the shepherd get his milk
[1:21:29] from the sheep where does the shepherd
[1:21:30] get his meat
[1:21:31] from the sheep what does the shepherd
[1:21:33] get is where does the shepherd get his
[1:21:36] income from the sheep where does the
[1:21:39] sheep get their leadership from the
[1:21:40] shepherd
[1:21:41] where do they get their security from
[1:21:42] the shepherd
[1:21:45] you see what i mean there's a symbiotic
[1:21:47] relationship and god will not allow
[1:21:49] either one to operate independent of the
[1:21:52] other
[1:21:53] that is god's plan whether there they're
[1:21:55] mute there's a mutual dependency
[1:21:57] and god wants it that way
[1:22:01] so that the shepherd can't run off and
[1:22:03] leave the sheep
[1:22:05] and the sheep can't go without the
[1:22:06] shepherd but god put the two together
[1:22:10] and when the two come together and work
[1:22:12] right god blesses it on both sides
[1:22:16] that's why this principle is so much
[1:22:18] deeper than just the surface you better
[1:22:20] pay your tithe
[1:22:22] it's a it's a program of god it's a plan
[1:22:24] of god it's recognizing god's plan and
[1:22:26] recognizing god's program
[1:22:29] and being thankful for it
[1:22:32] i want to go back to genesis 14 and i
[1:22:35] want to show you something that really
[1:22:36] blessed me in genesis 14.
[1:22:42] this has become my desire here
[1:22:49] i'm going to go right back to verse 18
[1:22:52] what we just read before
[1:22:56] and melchizedek king of salem brought
[1:22:58] forth bread and wine
[1:23:00] and he was a priest of the most high god
[1:23:02] and he blessed him and said
[1:23:04] blessed be abram of the most high god
[1:23:06] possessor of heaven and earth
[1:23:08] and blessed be the most high god which
[1:23:10] hath delivered thine enemies into thy
[1:23:11] hand
[1:23:12] and he gave him tithe of all
[1:23:17] now melchizedek said blessed be the most
[1:23:21] high god
[1:23:22] which would deliver thine enemies into
[1:23:24] thy hand
[1:23:26] so was it abraham's victory or was it
[1:23:27] god's
[1:23:29] was it abraham's effort or was it god's
[1:23:31] victory
[1:23:33] or was it god's deliverance where did
[1:23:35] all this spoil come from
[1:23:37] anyways from abraham or from god
[1:23:41] i say according to scripture it all came
[1:23:43] from god
[1:23:48] which had delivered thine enemies into
[1:23:50] thine hand and he gave him
[1:23:52] tithes of all and the king of sodom and
[1:23:55] said
[1:23:55] king of sodom said unto abram give me
[1:23:58] the persons and take the goods to
[1:23:59] thyself
[1:24:00] and abram said to the king of sodom i
[1:24:02] have lift up my hand unto the lord the
[1:24:04] most high god
[1:24:05] the possessor of heaven and earth that i
[1:24:07] will not take from a thread even to a
[1:24:09] shulachim
[1:24:10] and that i will not take anything that
[1:24:12] is thine
[1:24:14] lest thou should say i have made abram
[1:24:16] rich save only that which the young men
[1:24:18] have eaten and the portion of the men
[1:24:20] which went with me anor eshko and mamrie
[1:24:24] let them take their portion so
[1:24:27] abram he gets the spoil and he
[1:24:29] recognizes that this all comes from god
[1:24:31] it's not his anyways it's come from god
[1:24:34] amen he pays a tithe of it all amen and
[1:24:36] he takes what's left and he gives it
[1:24:37] back to the kings of sodom
[1:24:39] and they want to get they want to take
[1:24:40] the people and give him the goods
[1:24:42] and he says i've lifted my hand to god i
[1:24:44] will not take anything
[1:24:46] lest it's be said that you made me rich
[1:24:48] and i want all my blessings to come from
[1:24:50] god
[1:24:51] this is basically what he's saying and
[1:24:53] god honored this he had paid the tithe
[1:24:55] he had recognized who gave him the
[1:24:57] deliverance he had recognized
[1:24:58] who was standing for him in the before
[1:25:00] him in the melchizedek priesthood and
[1:25:02] when he saw god in flesh
[1:25:03] he gave him tithes of all and then he
[1:25:06] refused to be enriched by man because he
[1:25:08] wanted to be blessed by god
[1:25:09] and look at what happens in the next
[1:25:11] verse 15 verse 1
[1:25:14] after these things the word of the lord
[1:25:15] came unto abram in a vision saying fear
[1:25:17] not abram
[1:25:18] i am thy shield and thy exceeding great
[1:25:21] reward oh this is my prayer
[1:25:25] he says i'll open up the heavens and
[1:25:27] give you a blessing that you cannot
[1:25:28] receive it
[1:25:29] i said god don't just give it in
[1:25:31] material things amen don't just give it
[1:25:33] in good things
[1:25:34] but let my portion be you
[1:25:37] amen if i can have the faith of abram
[1:25:40] amen of abraham if i can recognize you
[1:25:42] and i can recognize your way and i can
[1:25:44] recognize who's delivered me and where
[1:25:46] all these goods come from
[1:25:47] and i can recognize your plan on how i
[1:25:49] can actually give you tithe
[1:25:51] and who is able to receive it and i
[1:25:53] operate in that
[1:25:54] faith oh god would you open the windows
[1:25:56] of heaven and give me what you gave
[1:25:58] abraham
[1:26:02] i am thy shield and thy exceeding
[1:26:06] great reward
[1:26:10] what do you want your reward to be for
[1:26:12] recognizing god and obeying tithe and
[1:26:13] offering do you want me more money
[1:26:16] is that all you want or do you want it
[1:26:17] to be him
[1:26:19] i want my reward to be him god almighty
[1:26:21] amen
[1:26:22] and this is the chapter where he
[1:26:23] promises him the son amen
[1:26:25] i want him to be my portion and i want
[1:26:27] to give him them to give me the promised
[1:26:28] son
[1:26:30] amen it's a it's a bigger picture than
[1:26:33] 10
[1:26:33] of a paycheck it's a bigger picture than
[1:26:36] giving money into a church or supporting
[1:26:37] a worker doing it
[1:26:38] it's so much more than that it is
[1:26:40] recognizing who god is and who we
[1:26:43] are and how it all fits together amen
[1:26:45] and where god's working and where god's
[1:26:47] speaking through it who's able to
[1:26:48] receive
[1:26:49] dies on behalf of god how can i come and
[1:26:51] contract with god
[1:26:52] how can i fulfill this contract with god
[1:26:55] to receive his blessings and the
[1:26:56] blessings i want
[1:26:57] are the blessings that abraham got i
[1:26:59] want him to be my shield and my great
[1:27:01] reward
[1:27:03] exceeding great reward
[1:27:08] so much more than a pool for money or
[1:27:10] somebody who needs your money and
[1:27:12] brother bam said i don't need your money
[1:27:14] i can work yet for that
[1:27:17] it's not about enriching it's not about
[1:27:19] a church it's not about a program
[1:27:21] it's about you recognizing god and you
[1:27:24] fulfilling amen the desire of your heart
[1:27:26] to honor and respect and reverence god
[1:27:28] and who honors god god will honor and
[1:27:30] who despises god he'll lightly esteem
[1:27:36] we can thank god
[1:27:39] we can thank god that he has made a way
[1:27:43] for us to enter into this contract
[1:27:48] and that way is still open and that he's
[1:27:51] promised
[1:27:51] us he'll open the windows of heaven
[1:27:54] listen friends when he opens the windows
[1:27:57] of heaven
[1:27:58] amen that's not just material goods
[1:28:03] but heaven is consistent of the word and
[1:28:05] i want to do
[1:28:07] i want to recognize god in all things i
[1:28:09] want to give him the do
[1:28:10] and the honor and the respect and i want
[1:28:12] to do it his way
[1:28:13] according to his plan through the
[1:28:15] priesthood he's put on earth
[1:28:16] and i want him to open the windows of
[1:28:18] heaven like he promised and pour out on
[1:28:20] me a blessing that i'm not even
[1:28:22] able to receive it to your heart and
[1:28:25] soul is so
[1:28:26] bursting forth your flesh cannot even
[1:28:28] contain the revelation
[1:28:29] because he's poured open the windows of
[1:28:31] heaven and he says i am your shield
[1:28:33] and i am your exceeding great reward you
[1:28:36] weren't looking for riches
[1:28:37] abraham wasn't looking for riches he
[1:28:39] didn't give ties to get rich he had his
[1:28:41] opportunity
[1:28:42] he turned it down all he wanted was god
[1:28:44] amen
[1:28:45] he didn't want more money and more goods
[1:28:47] and more this but because all he wanted
[1:28:49] was god
[1:28:50] god gave him more goods and more money
[1:28:52] and more servants
[1:28:54] because he got the first things first
[1:28:56] and honored god and god honored him
[1:29:00] we don't enter into this contract with
[1:29:02] god so that i can get
[1:29:03] more money and more goods and more of
[1:29:06] this
[1:29:06] i entered this contract with god because
[1:29:08] god has promised me he'd
[1:29:10] open the windows of heaven he would
[1:29:12] protect my livelihood he's given me he
[1:29:14] would protect the gifts that he's given
[1:29:16] to me but he would open up the
[1:29:18] windows of heaven and pour out a
[1:29:20] blessing
[1:29:21] and i could receive the promise of
[1:29:23] abraham because i'm seed of abraham
[1:29:27] say god you are my
[1:29:30] shield and my exceeding great reward
[1:29:34] and above everything else of course
[1:29:37] i don't want the devourer to devour the
[1:29:39] things you've given me of course i don't
[1:29:41] want
[1:29:41] my vine to cast forth it's fruit of
[1:29:44] course
[1:29:46] but the thing i want more than anything
[1:29:49] is for you to be my shield and my
[1:29:51] exceeding great reward
[1:29:53] what you gave abraham is what i want if
[1:29:56] i can have the faith of abraham
[1:29:57] and do as abraham i want to receive what
[1:29:59] abraham received
[1:30:03] let's go to revelation 21.
[1:30:19] revelation 21 and verse 23
[1:30:23] when we talked about the principle of
[1:30:24] clothing we started there
[1:30:26] god initiated clothing to cover because
[1:30:29] the lust veil had come upon his children
[1:30:31] and the veil of innocy has been taken
[1:30:32] away and that
[1:30:34] that god began according to the
[1:30:36] scriptures continues all the way through
[1:30:38] to new heavens and new earth
[1:30:42] but when god initiated tithe tithing
[1:30:45] runs
[1:30:46] all the way through new heavens and new
[1:30:47] earth it's a principle that's before the
[1:30:50] law
[1:30:51] in the law after all the old testament
[1:30:53] after the millennium
[1:30:55] all the way in new heavens and new earth
[1:30:57] because it's a principle of god it
[1:30:59] doesn't fade away
[1:31:02] let's look at chapter 21 verse 23
[1:31:06] and the city had no need of sun neither
[1:31:08] of moon to shine in it
[1:31:10] for the glory of god did lighten it and
[1:31:12] the lamb is the light thereof
[1:31:14] and the nations of them which are saved
[1:31:15] shall walk in the light of it and the
[1:31:17] kings of the earth do bring their glory
[1:31:19] and honor into it
[1:31:20] and the gates of it shall not be shut at
[1:31:22] all by day for there shall not be night
[1:31:24] there
[1:31:25] and they shall bring the glory and honor
[1:31:27] of the nations
[1:31:28] into it brother tells us the glory and
[1:31:31] honor of the nations that they're
[1:31:32] bringing into it these are not the
[1:31:33] people who live in the city
[1:31:34] these are those who are saved that are
[1:31:36] outside the city that were saved
[1:31:37] at the white throne judgment and the
[1:31:40] nations that are outside the city are
[1:31:41] bringing their tithe and offering their
[1:31:44] glory and their honor into the city
[1:31:46] there is a perpetual tithing all the way
[1:31:49] through
[1:31:49] eternity and the new heavens and new
[1:31:52] earth
[1:31:54] let's skip down now verse chapter 22
[1:32:00] uh verse 2
[1:32:03] and in the midst of the street of it and
[1:32:05] on either side of the river was there
[1:32:06] the tree of life
[1:32:07] which bear 12 manner of fruits and yield
[1:32:10] her fruit every month
[1:32:11] and the leaves of the tree were for the
[1:32:13] healing of the nations
[1:32:16] the leaves of the tree were not for the
[1:32:18] healing of the elect
[1:32:20] the leaves of the tree were for the
[1:32:22] healing of the nations
[1:32:24] what are the nations doing they're
[1:32:26] breathing their tithe and offering
[1:32:27] into the city here's what brother benham
[1:32:29] says in future home
[1:32:31] the leaves will be for the healing of
[1:32:33] the nations
[1:32:35] that is the kings that live and there
[1:32:36] bring their honor in
[1:32:38] when they bring their honor in and lay
[1:32:39] it before the throne of god just like
[1:32:42] the 11 tribes brought it in every one of
[1:32:44] them attempt to levi
[1:32:45] what's brother branham doing he's
[1:32:46] bringing the principle of tithing
[1:32:48] all the way here to new heavens and new
[1:32:50] earth in the new jerusalem
[1:32:53] just like the 11 tribes brought every
[1:32:55] one of them
[1:32:56] attempt to leave i see when they bring
[1:32:58] their honor in from the blessed land
[1:33:00] they'll reach from the reach from the
[1:33:03] tree of life and break off
[1:33:04] a holy leaf or a tree of life leave and
[1:33:07] they'll walk out together there is no
[1:33:08] more war
[1:33:09] everything is at peace the leaves are a
[1:33:11] memorial for the healing of the nations
[1:33:14] this principle is so important to god
[1:33:17] amen that the
[1:33:18] the the regions of the saved outside the
[1:33:20] city when they bring of the increase of
[1:33:23] the land they bring their
[1:33:24] their tithe and offering into the land
[1:33:26] their their uh
[1:33:27] their glory and their honor into the
[1:33:29] city and they lay it before the throne
[1:33:31] they can reach over of the tree of life
[1:33:35] what's happening here there's an
[1:33:37] exchange taking place
[1:33:40] because they honor and reverence god
[1:33:44] god honors them with eternal life
[1:33:51] this principle goes all the way through
[1:33:54] the bible friends
[1:33:56] if you honor me i'll honor you
[1:34:00] and the new heavens and earth there's
[1:34:01] still an honoring our reverence and
[1:34:03] respect of god
[1:34:04] and god is allowing them to partake of
[1:34:06] the tree of life
[1:34:07] for the healing of the nations
[1:34:08] perpetually month after month
[1:34:10] new moon after new moon and i say
[1:34:14] god be praised if that
[1:34:18] if that cycle if that picture of that
[1:34:20] principle is that effective
[1:34:23] i want it to work in my life i believe
[1:34:26] it do you believe it
[1:34:29] how many of you are excited to write out
[1:34:30] your next title
[1:34:34] oh i hope you leave from here not beat
[1:34:37] down not feeling like somebody was
[1:34:39] correcting but you you have an
[1:34:40] opportunity to show my love for god and
[1:34:43] to have that exceeding great portion
[1:34:45] which is him
[1:34:47] let's all stand musicians if you would
[1:34:49] come
[1:34:50] brother ben if you would come
[1:34:55] i want to prove that i've met
[1:34:56] melchizedek
[1:34:58] and i've communed with him and i want to
[1:35:01] prove it
[1:35:01] in bringing my glory and my honor to god
[1:35:05] now it's not about i have to the precept
[1:35:08] of man
[1:35:09] fear of the lord but now i recognize who
[1:35:12] he is
[1:35:13] and who i am and what his program is and
[1:35:15] who honors him he honors and who
[1:35:17] despises him
[1:35:18] he lightly esteems i say god i recognize
[1:35:22] just like just like melchizedek told
[1:35:25] abraham
[1:35:27] god delivered the kings to you
[1:35:31] abraham didn't do anything he was just
[1:35:32] the hands that god used
[1:35:35] i've not earned anything i'm just the
[1:35:38] hands that he uses
[1:35:39] it's a life he's given me it's the job
[1:35:41] he's gave me the mind he's given me
[1:35:43] the tongue the eyes the hand it's all
[1:35:45] what he's given me
[1:35:46] and i want to give back to him honor and
[1:35:48] glory and respect
[1:35:51] and in return he'll open the windows of
[1:35:53] heaven
[1:35:54] he'll curse the devourer he'll not let
[1:35:57] the vine cast forth
[1:35:59] he'll protect me you know protect what
[1:36:01] he's given me
[1:36:02] and he'll give me of himself i say thank
[1:36:05] god for that
[1:36:08] i hope tithing i don't believe it was
[1:36:11] for most of you a negative
[1:36:13] thought or idea but i hope it's flipped
[1:36:16] completely to the wonderful positive
[1:36:18] absolutely fantastic plan of god
[1:36:23] for his children to express their love
[1:36:25] for him
