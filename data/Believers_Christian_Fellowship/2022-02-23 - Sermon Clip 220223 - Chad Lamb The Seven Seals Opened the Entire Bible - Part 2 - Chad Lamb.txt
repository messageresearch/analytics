========================================

something not my flesh my flesh is rotten you know this is one of the problems we run into when we start talking about the bride is the expression of christ people start to look to flesh and they say you make a mistake and you do something wrong that's not the part i'm talking about i'm talking about something down in the soul amen that seed gene of god that expresses the word of god amen and so when you see me if you see me make a mistake and you see me do something contrary to the word i just want to tell you right now amen that's not god that's me that's my old hybrid flesh amen as my old nature raising up that's not god that's me but when you see an expression of christ come through me amen and it matches the word it surrenders to the word and expresses i want you to know that's not me that's him see we have a hard time separating the outer man from the inner man the hybrid part from the sea gene of god and if we could just do that we would realize so much of what we struggle with is the outer man and the outer man is going to crumble to pieces one day be dead or be changed amen this is not the part that we're worried about it's the part down on inside that came from god god will refashion the outside amen so that he can live in a full expression on the inside but that's where the confusion comes in you know how can i be the manifestation of christ and i just i mean i talked hateful with my wife yesterday that's not the manifestation of christ that's you in your hybrid form but when you surrender and humble yourself amen and the holy ghost moves you back and you surrender and you make things right that's not you that's god in you when you surrender to this word when you hear the prophet straighten out the scriptures and you say that's right when he straightens out the doctrine and you ditch your ideas and you say that's nothing but the truth that wasn't you that was him if we recognize that a lot of the manipulation that the enemy tries the tactics he tries on us will begin to go away and say listen i know i messed up that's not god's faultless mind i know i failed to manifest christ today that wasn't his fault that's mine but there's something in me that's going to come back and say i'm sorry god amen i'll give myself to you and i'll lay myself at your feet and take me and do your will with me and manifest yourself through me and let this word live in me that's him that's the seed that's rising up and saying it's got to be him and not me
