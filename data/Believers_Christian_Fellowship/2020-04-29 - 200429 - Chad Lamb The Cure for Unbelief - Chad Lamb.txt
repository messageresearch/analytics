========================================

oh you are holy holy the holy holy the lord all together now sing lovely oh you are lovely is [Music] the lord your holy [Music] you wear [Music] [Music] his name is he's god with us grieving i like that oh i love that for his name is gone amen is is his name is amen amen praise the lord amen god with us god in us amen let's take our bibles while we're standing and turn to hebrews chapter 11. i want to continue on with the thought we had on sunday sunday we talked about the worst sickness of all and we found out that the worst sickness of all is unbelief worse than anything that we can experience whether physical or mental or any other kind of sickness that we could possibly have the worst sickness of all is unbelief and if we could be free from that everything else is fine amen but today i'd like to talk about the cure for unbelief the cure for unbelief and we're going to go into this maybe a little bit deep if the lord will bless us and help us with that i want to thank brother john for taking the song service and it's nice to have him step in we found ourselves in need of a song leader and he jumped right in and thank god for him amen i also want to let you know brother tim and sister miami dean hart along with joshua dean hart made it safely to idaho so thank you for praying for them they moved they're moving there to be with the family and they arrived sunday morning and they wanted to thank you all for the cards and everything that you've said and done for them they appreciate that but they're there safely now and we thank god it was a it was a strange time you know they've been planning they had their house for sale for a while they've been planning on moving for quite a while to be out there with brother tim's parents and uh with brother david but it all happened right in the middle of a pandemic and we would have loved to have had a big send-off had a party for him and done all that but it just wasn't possible but we appreciate all of you who gave cards and sent cards and brought them in for them they appreciate that and hopefully they can come back for a visit when all this passes and we can have a big gathering for them but god bless you let's read hebrews chapter 11 and verse 6. but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so without faith it's impossible to please him let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you for this day we thank you for this privilege to be gathered together we thank you for this privilege lord to be able to hear your word and we ask all that you would just anoint the lips of clay that are speaking now god that it wouldn't be the mind of a man we've not come here to hear from the mind of a man we've come to hear from you and we know that this is your provided way lord and we just ask that you would move the man out of the way and that you would come and speak yourself that you would feed your hungry sheep from your own hand we just pray that god would lord that you would have preeminence and lord that you would be blessed and always say or do in jesus name we pray amen god bless you as your seated i'd like to read from the message why from 1961 it says i will say today the number one killer they say that number one killer is heart disease i don't believe the number one killer is heart disease i believe the number one killer is sin disease that's the killer that unbelief that's what's killing people we got the best doctors we ever had the best medicine we ever had certainly the best hospitals was ever had the best medicines to practice with we ever had and we got more sickness than we ever had because we got more unbelief than we ever had that's exactly true number one killer isn't heart trouble it's sin trouble is the number one killer he goes on to say in the invisible union of the bride of christ he says what is sin sin is unbelief in what the word unbelief in god which is the word so when we disbelieve the word it's unbelief in god amen when we have unbelief in god amen that's the killer that's the number one killer that there is is that unbelief and so that's what we're fighting that's what we're still fighting today is unbelief we live in a civilization steeped in unbelief we're surrounded in unbelief immersed in unbelief our eyes our ears all of our senses pick up unbelief all day long but we're trying to live by a sick sense we're called to live by a sixth sense and that sense is faith that abides in the soul let's look at galatians chapter 5 i want to use this as a context for what we want to say from here on out galatians chapter 5 verse 5. i'm sorry i have to be in galatians to read from galatians not second corinthians galatians chapter 5 verse 5 for we for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love so i want to lay that down as a foundation tight now we're looking for the cure for unbelief and we would say the opposite of unbelief is faith and that is true brother brahma said you've got two choices unbelief or faith amen so those are the two things we're operating by but when we look at galatians here it says that that neither circumcision availeth anything or uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love so we're going to find out that there's a working of faith or the thing that works faith is love so we want to go deeper than just the faith and we want to go what is it that that works faith what is it that makes faith operate what is it that brings faith to the surface and that is love amen you'll know that i've said many times that i've had an aversion to love preaching in the past not now but in the past because of the way it was handled it was always an emotional thing an emotional tie-in love in the in the human realm and human type of love which is such a fickle frivolous kind of love that comes and goes and and it's not one that can be trusted or dependent on and so when it was preached that way i always recoiled a bit because i never i never felt that way you know i never i didn't like it i couldn't measure up because i couldn't be nice all the time and so when i would hear that kind of preaching about be nice to the neighbor and be sweet to those who you work with and all of that kind of preaching when i would hear that i would recoil because i was never capable of being nice all the time i was never capable of being friendly all the time i was always finding myself falling short and the emotional kind of love because it goes up and it goes down that emotional love even for your children even for your spouse it ebbs and flows it never stays at a constant it's always moving and flowing because the emotions change and so that kind of preaching always left me feeling a little inadequate because it was always preached up here and i could never stay up here for a whole day i might hit five minutes or less and then it would come back down but but praise god this is a different kind of love that's not based on emotions it doesn't move with emotions amen it's the love of god god's own love and that's what we're looking for but faith which worketh by love not by our emotions but by that solid constant of god's love and god's love is a solid constant amen it's not movable it's not flexible it's not changing it's rock solid and dependable because he loved us from before the foundation of the world when we were yet in sin he loved us when we were yet unrighteous he loved us amen before we were born he loved us after we were born he would loved us when we were in sin he loved us when we repented he loved us it's been a constant stable steady unmovable unshakable love and if we're going to base our experience on anything let's base it on that friends not our emotion but on the love of god amen and faith worketh by that love not our emotional love but it worketh by that love let's go to first corinthians chapter 13. first corinthians chapter 13 and verse 1 though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i can become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol this word charity is the same love agapo love and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not love i am nothing so there's something supporting faith there's something amen we could have all faith that we can move mountains but if we had that without the love of god then it would still fall short and we put so much emphasis on the things that we see the things that can be done that things that can be accomplished and the manifestations and there's so much emphasis on manifestations that when we see manifestations we assume that that that individual or that church or that moment has come to the pinnacle amen to the highest point that they can come with god right it's a it's an old pentecostal idea that transfers over but if we can see manifestation if we can see divine healing working of miracles if we can see something and see something on a consistent basis we believe that we've come to the highest but if we have all faith that we can move mountains and have not love we are nothing because if you look at the stature of a perfect man the foundation is faith amen and from faith we move our way up to the capstone of love amen so paul is telling us that that love is everything it is the capstone it is the love of god it is god because god is love and god is the word so the word is love and god is love and the word is love and you're part of the word so that means you're part of god's love praise be to god that's what we want to base our faith on let's turn to uh first john first john chapter two want to lay in several scriptures and want to get to the thought i had this thought sunday and i never could get to it and it was the main thing i wanted to preach praise the lord first john chapter 2 verse 15. first john 2 and 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world so right here he is showing us that that you're not supposed to love the world or the things that are in the world but if we love that then the love of the father is not even in us and so he's naming the things that are in the world and it's interesting he doesn't go into adultery and it's not smoking and drinking and fornication and extortion and that's not the list he goes into he lists three things he says these are the things that are in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride and the pride of life and let's turn back to genesis and we're going to look at this because this is the original fall so what john has done is he's taken us right back to the temptation of eve in the in the garden and he's showing us what caused the fall genesis chapter 3 and verse 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food the lust of the flesh and it was pleasant to the eyes the lust of the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise the pride of life so john's taking us right back to the original fall in the garden of eden and he's saying this is what the love of the world consists of and when you realize what the love of the world consists of it's always based on self the the the it's based on the love of the flesh the love of the eyes and the pride of life and so the show down here between the woman and the serpent was really it was it was based off we would say would she stick with the word or would she move to her own desires and her own lust and the question is will she love the word which is god so will she love god more or will she love herself more and so when we really come down to it when we get down to the boil it all the way down amen the real trial in the garden of eden was between love of god and love of self and john picks it up and says amen if you love the world amen the love of god's not even in you and this is what the love of the world consists of the same thing that he fell behind the garden of eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and the question is do you love yourself more than you love god because every time every time at least for me every time that i fail on the word of god i failed by my own lust and my own desires i wanted something for me i wanted i wanted a pleasure i wanted i wanted to be well thought of i wanted to have a reputation i wanted to have some desire or something easier and it was always putting self above god which is the word so you realize it's not about a rule-keeping because rule-keeping is not going to accomplish anything amen but the scriptures amen the word is god and it's a love for god that's greater than my love for myself so i will always abase myself under that word because i love the word which is god more than i love myself i mean it's the same thing i mean no matter what what we we what trouble we run into in life it's always love of self i mean if it's if it's if it's whatever i mean if it's stealing then you love yourself more than the person you stole from if it's lying you love yourself more than a person you lied to so it's the same thing we're coming down to the same thing so the battle we face is the same one that he faced in the garden of eden this isn't anything different it's the same exact thing it's playing out daily in our lives i mean the serpent's coming to try to deceive us amen and he's trying to use reasoning and love of self amen he says god doesn't know that when you eat thereof i mean your eyes will be open you'll become like gods what is he trying to do he's trying to give her something more than what seemingly god gave but the more always equals less so seemingly she was going to get something more than what god was holding back she was going to get a little something more by going the route of reasoning and self-love but what she got was less she lost everything she had she had dominion she was as a god co-heir co-equal to adam and she lost it all right and so this is the battle that we're still in it was where is our affection where is our love amen is it on us on him so let's go to matthew chapter 4. these still aren't the things i want to preach just laying the foundation for what the lord's laid on my heart what i would really like to say if god will help me matthew chapter four verse one matthew chapter 4 verse 1 then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward a hunger and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command these stones to be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of god then the devil taketh him up on the into the holy city and setteth him on the pinnacle of the temple and saith to him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against the stone jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou will fall down and worship me then saith jesus unto him get thee hence satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god in him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him brother branham says concerning this scripture he says in the laodicean church age out of the church age book a quick look at these those scriptures which involve the lord jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in matthew 4 where jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptations of satan by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life jesus overcame by the word he fell he fell to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say this that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word can't fail because the word is greater than me because the word is god right and so the word is god so the word is greater than me amen and the problem we run into many people will take and make excuses for why they don't keep the word make excuses for why they disobey the word and really all that's being expressed is i love me more than i love god if we really come down boil it down really we're all friends what really is happening is we're saying i really love me more than i love god so i'll make an exception to god's law and the god's word and i'll find some reasoning amen and i'll find some way to manipulate a quote or manipulate a teaching so that i can work my way into doing what i want to do anyways that's why we have so many debates on so many issues in the message issues about fashion issues about marriage and divorce and issues all these issues would begin to go away quickly if we'd be willing to completely die to ourselves but there's so many fighting over marriage and divorce and over fashion and hair and all of these things that really i mean some of these things are petty and they're trivial but all they are is an opportunity to express what's really in the heart and so we'll look for a quote amen that matches exactly what it is we already want to do and that becomes our foundational quote for doing what we want to do and we have to ignore several others and almost it's almost like we take the quotes and set them my idea a different idea i choose to believe this and those i'm not going to even talk about when the reality is we were not ever looking to be fully obedient to god we were looking for a way to do what we wanted to do anyways and then we got to be real so we just got to be honest with ourselves i mean we're going to get to a point where we don't need the preacher to preach about it before we start repenting for it to where we realized that was selfish we realized that was me i was defending myself i was promoting myself i was feeding my own pleasures god forgive me and i we've got to get to that point as the bride of jesus christ to be just like him and not wait and come to church and bite our nails and sit on our heads and hope that that he doesn't preach on that that sunday or wait till he finally preaches on it so we repent but our hearts already condemning us we already know there's something wrong inside i mean we've got to get real and start loving god which is the word more than we love this flesh which is made out of the world so if you love the world or the things that are in the world even then the love of god god's not even in us so there's a real battle there's a real showdown that we're coming to every day you wake up in the morning in the middle of a showdown amen right smack dab in the middle of it are we going to deny ourselves and take the word and let the word amen be god amen praise be the praise be to god [Applause] to me everything is becoming i want it to be real that's all i can say i i'm so tired of religion i grew up in religion all my life was in religion i've seen the genuine i've seen the false i've seen people with a heart to do good i've seen people just going through the motions and playing the game i played the game myself and i'm i'm so tired of that we don't need any of that what we need is a reality to strike our hearts to say i'm willing to give up everything for him i'm willing to die to him i'm willing to surrender all to him and if it means that i've got to go without ever getting married the rest of my life if that's what i think he wants that's what i'm willing to do i'm not going to try to twist or manipulate something to justify me satisfying my own flesh if it means i remain single all my life i'll go that route if it means that i can never do this thing that i so enjoy doing i'm going to give it up because i want to be right and real i don't want to look good to my brothers and sisters i don't want to have to defend the position with a quote i want it to be real amen from the depth of my soul all the way out i want it to be the reality of his word in me i hope i trust i know that you're just as tired of formality and religion as i am because that's not what's going that's not what's going to win the day that's just going to propagate the same thing i mean that we've had for 2000 years [Music] we don't want any more of that we want to be real if we want to be honest we got to get to the point where we're really honest with ourselves we're really honest with god because the fig leaves aren't working adam made his own religion the fig leaves amen and it wasn't working it didn't fool god and all of our religion and our excuses and our manipulating of quotes and scriptures it ain't working god sees right through it we may fool the brother next to us or the or the sister but we're not fooling god and it comes down to where we really got to spend enough time in prayer before god and make a real connection with him to where we we know when we're in front of him we're naked in his presence and everything is exposed i mean that everything is exposed you know that thing that i said the other day amen every word i said was true but my intent was to deceive you and we need to spend enough time in the presence of the lord where all of a sudden he puts a red hot poker right in that thing and you can't stand it anymore not the excuse of i said the truth i told the truth but you told the truth with the intent to deceive somebody that's a lie i don't care if every word coming out of your mouth was a hundred percent truth amen your intention was to put somebody in the wrong direction it wasn't the truth and i i say god expose it in us lord god rooted out of us until we die every day die die die till we get used to dying so he can have the greater preeminence brother braham says in the message balm and gilead is there no balm in gilead is there no physician there then why is my people still wade in sin why are they still moping around for the things of the world isn't there enough satisfaction in my gospel to take care of every longing that they have that's the question let's listen to the question again isn't there enough satisfaction in my gospel to take care of every longing that they have is there enough joy when they receive me don't i give them enough joy and love that i take all the love of the world out of them i said you know if you love the world or the things of the world the love of the father is not in you is there enough joy in serving god to take you away from the things of the world then why isn't the daughter of my people recovered from her sin sickness i mean what has god given us in this day we have the gospel the true gospel the fully restored word is there not enough joy in that gospel to take away every other joy to supersede and override every other joy or pleasure of the flesh praise be to god so so we have a a showdown and we know that faith worketh by love so unbelief is the worst sickness there is in the world the most horrible thing there is in the world the most deadly sickness is unbelief because in the beginning amen we know eve was deceived but she was deceived into leaving the word she was deceived into leaving the word for her own pleasures and unbelief entered in if she would have believed the word correctly she would have never been deceived she would have stayed with the word if she would have just stayed with the word with no understanding there would have been no problem if if he would have said that you know did god say surely not he does know that you'll be his gods and and she would say if she would have looked at him and says i have no idea what you're talking about you sound really smart mr serpent and you've already proved to me you know a lot of stuff and you're you may be right i mean she could have just talked like this you may be correct that might be right i don't know all i know is adam told me he said this and so i'm just going to say that if she would have just done that amen she wouldn't have had to prove anything defend anything outsmart anybody all she would have had to do was say what he said and the devil would have left her because that's what happened when jesus was tempted in the same way with the same three temptations amen when he resisted by the word each time amen the devil departed so if she could have just stayed with the word the problem with the real issue the real issue was what the serpent was saying sounded nice that was the real issue and it was appealing to a part of her there was an appealing part to what he was saying and it was appealing to her her flash and it was appealing to her understanding amen and and in that appealing she she i would i would say it this way based off my own temptation and my own failures not speaking for eve but based off me she wanted what he was saying to be the truth so it was easy for her to leave the word and take this reasoning because she wanted what he was saying to be the truth because the word was seemingly limiting her seemingly to the human reasoning she was being limited or held back amen uh uh she couldn't have full expression of her desire she couldn't have full expression of all her wants amen with the word so it's seemingly the word was holding her back amen not realizing it was the word that was preserving her for the greatest manifestation but it seemingly was holding her back and what the serpent was saying looked like he was giving a correct interpretation to the word although he was slightly modifying what she had heard before but she was taking it because she wanted that to be the truth oh pray god i love it when the word exposes me exposes the fallacy and the humanity and and the foolishness of a human mind and human desires it's exposing and i like to be exposed i said god give me give me that portion i need give me that thing amen let your love become more of a reality to me because faith worketh by love amen and if your love for me can become more of a reality in me then that faith can go to work amen and push away all the unbelief out of my life praise god let's go back to numbers we read this sunday but i'd like to read it again numbers uh 14 numbers 14 and verse 1. we at cadiz barnea we went through this sunday where the spies had went over come back 10 bring an evil report 10 bring an evil report by telling the truth well no they didn't tell the truth how do we say this they gave correct facts you couldn't argue with their facts if they would have had the right equipment they would have video and pictures to prove what they were saying they would had video and pictures they'd could have put together a scientific documentary they could have taken measurements with a laser measuring device they could have vindicated and proven all the facts that they were giving but the way they put the facts together was telling a lie because they were saying something different than what the word said and because it was different than what the word said it was a lie even though the facts were true [Music] that's why we have to be careful with facts especially scientific facts hey i was scrolling through the news today and i just flipped through to see what the articles were and i read an article that absolutely intrigued me today nasa is planning on shooting a laser to the moon to look for water have we heard that before brother branham said in the antelubivian today in noah they shot the moon with the laser and they said there's no water up there it was like a quote out of the message on the headlines nasa is going to shoot the moon with the laser to look for water on the surface of the moon hey too late in noah's day they already shot the moon with the laser nasa is way behind praise be to god and they told noah there's no water up there and noah said i don't know if it's up there down there where it's at he just said it's going to rain praise god noah didn't have any scientific information and he didn't have any and he didn't have any articles to prove that what he's saying was true he couldn't back it up with any facts or any science but the science was contrary to what god had told him so he rejected science and stayed with what god told him and now you know 5 000 years 4 000 years however many thousand years later they're still trying to shoot the moon and look for water man these guys are slow praise be to god but we go here they give the facts here at katy's barnea but the same set of facts brought two different responses in two groups of people same facts you realize it wasn't that that it wasn't that caleb and joshua went to a different part of the promised land and saw short people in villages with no walls it's like they saw you know all the pygmies and they're like oh we can do this no you realize they saw the same thing they saw the giants they saw the walled cities they saw the same thing they had the same facts amen but one one group joshua and caleb had faith in the promise because there was something in their heart to activate their faith the other ones were missing a key ingredient let's look here verse one we'll read this again chapter 14 verse one and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people went that night and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would god that we had died in the land of egypt or would god we had died in the wilderness and wherefore hath the lord brought us unto this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not better for us to return into egypt and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return unto egypt man that's how good wisdom is that's why wisdom and man always takes him right back to the mother right back to egypt we'll run away get away a move of god brings us out amen and brother branham said every daughter from the church started off a virgin she's born every little girl is born a virgin and she's born from a she's born a virgin but when she matured and grew up amen because she didn't want to move on into the promised land because there was giants and walled cities and it would create hardship keeping the word is not easy on the flesh because of that they would always turn back to the mother and become a harlot and so the wisdom of man has always gone back to egypt from this time all the way through the wisdom of man has always gone back to egypt that's the best that man can do go back to bondage number four verse four and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into egypt then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of israel and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephena which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake unto all the company the children of israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good land if the lord delighted us then he will bring us into this land and give it to us a land which floweth with milk and honey only rebel not ye against the lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bred for us their defenses is departed from them and the lord is with us fear them not oh i love that response one of them says it's terrible it will never make it for grasshoppers in their sight and the other one says they're bred for us why because at the top of verse 8 if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land you know what joshua and caleb had they had a correct revelation of their position in god they recognize that god loves us he delights in us he takes pleasure in us look at what he's done amen he kept his word for 440 years he told abraham we're abraham's descendants he promised he kept his promise after 400 and some years he kept his promise he brought us out with a mighty hand he's fed us along the way he's protected us he's watered us he's given us everything can't you see the love of god and they couldn't see the love of god all they could see was a god who hated them and they wished they had already died because god was asking them to do something beyond their reasoning something their flesh did not want to do something that was a challenge to everything in their mind and everything in their psyche was being challenged by the word and when they met the challenge all of a sudden they didn't see a god who loved them they saw a god who hated them they saw a god who brought them for them to fall by the sword for their wives to be slain for their children to be taken my you know that sounds horrible but what happens when we get into a really tight spot into a dark place and then all of a sudden our health is gone our mind all of a sudden the devil comes with the same thoughts comes in your mind with the same thoughts amen and you start to have to fight those doubts of whether or not god loves you and sees you and knows where you're at and whether or not he's left you to your own whether or not you really are a child of god or he really delights in you amen and you've got to fight through that thing because what is it that's the serpent whispering in your ear trying to get you to look at the preservation of the flesh and we were never to preserve the flesh we were always to let it die let it die let it go naked i mean job but he lost everything he said naked came out into this world and naked shall i leave it amen blessed be the name of the lord the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord oh god help me get to that place this is the desire of my life friends to get to this place where if he takes it all away i say god bless you lord i still love you and i know you still love me but when we get to the same place they got here we have to fight the same kind of devils they had to fight why is this happening you've sinned away your day of grace god's left you you're on your own all the same same devils you got to fight through them and say no the lord delights in us and it's got to go past that until you can get to the place by revelation you say the lord delights in me he's called me he's pulled me out he's revealed his word to me he's preserved me so many times i know by a revelation that's down in my soul that i am his and he is mine and he delights in me and no matter what happens on the surface is not going to change the love that is in my heart because he first loved me we love him because he first loved us and with that kind of understanding joshua and caleb had a totally different response to the same set of facts i said i want to be a joshua and the caleb not the other spies so faith workers by love what was working joshua and caleb's faith their understanding of god's love he delights in us they didn't say joshua and caleb wasn't saying we're stronger we're better that's not what he was saying he doesn't say we have better armament because they had none you know you realize he was all he said if he delights and thus he'll give us the land it's all him i mean he said it didn't he do all that i mean didn't are we here i mean where were we a couple months ago guys i mean where were we did you forget i mean you say he loved you at the red sea but he doesn't love you now he loved you at the smitten rock but now god's fickle with his love like he loves one minute and doesn't love the next like he used to love me god's eternal he's never changing he's constant i mean how could we say god used to love me or back when god loved me when god used to love me [Music] he ported the red sea because he delighted in us he fed us manna cause he delighted in us he gave us water from the rock because he delighted in us he gave us his word because he delighted in us he led us with a pillar of fire because he delighted us and if he ever delighted in me he's always going to delight in me if he's ever loved me he'll always love me when things go completely wrong it doesn't change god's love for me because it's a constant friend it's more constant than the earth you're standing on it's more constant than anything you've ever seen with your eyeballs the love of god is more constant than that it's more constant than a government it's more constant than anything that you've ever seen or known the love of god is constant steady and sure and it's strong and it's powerful and it's not based on emotions [Applause] [Music] praise god it was the love of god that kept jesus christ nailed to a cross when he could have delivered himself love is not it's not pink flowers and red roses it's not bows and pretty cards that's not love that's emotion amen to human love human emotion that gives you twitter painted and butterflies in your stomach and all of those things that's not this kind of love this is the kind of love that though he was being absolutely tortured and abused amen he could have delivered himself amen if he would have twitched his finger brother branham said there was legions of angels all around hanging in every tree on every limb and if he would have twitched his finger they would have delivered him but what held him amen through the brutal punishment and the torture and the abuse and the mocking and the scourging and hanging it was his love for you and me his delight in us that held him there that's a strong burley amen his faith is burly and has hairs on his chest and muscles what is love god because faith work is by love [Laughter] [Applause] that's the kind of love even men like praise be to god it's constant steady sure and strong amen if he loved you enough where were we six years ago friends what kind of garbage were we rolling around in what did he deliver us from did he love us then and not now he loved us enough to pull us out of reasoning and denominational understanding but now all of a sudden his love never changes how did we get here don't forget where we were don't forget where you personally were where has god brought you from in your lifetime where has he brought you from in the last couple of years amen he says in the stature of a perfect man 1962 now in building the virtue building this monument building this statue see it starts off with the foundation stone faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness now what does it do then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for god is love and he controls and he is the strength of every one of these things god is love and he's the strength of what faith temperance virtue it's love it's it's love faith work is by love love is the strength of every one of these virtues and it's the capping off it's the ceiling together it's the molding it together it's all operated by faith and it's all sealed by faith and it's by love and it's all capped off by love so love is the working of these things it's the strength of every one of these things that's right yes sir right in here right in here you see i got in between all these works in here and here this little little waves come what is it the holy ghost coming down through christ see the holy spirit the holy spirit is above all this welding this together building a what a perfect church for the capstone to cap it off what's been building it love it what's the strength of it all love what does faith operate by love what does temperance operate by love what does virtue operate by love it's a revelation of who we are in christ jesus he says in the message desperation 1963 now the word plainly states if you want to put this down in galatians 5 6 that faith worketh by love see faith worketh by love and the only way that you can have faith is have love first because after all faith is love's incentive incentive that's exactly what faith is it's an incentive to love now if you don't have love you can't have faith further in desperation says we must have love before we can have faith when we have genuine love what does it do it pushes our faith out on the battlefront for god see genuine godly love for god and for his word and for his people will push faith out there love just takes a hold of faith and just come on let's go and out it goes because that's what love does john 14 23 jesus said if a man loves me he'll keep my words now you can't keep his words without having faith in what he said so you see if so so you see if he loves god then he keeps god's word if he said i am the lord that healeth thee he believes that love makes him believe it love makes him believe it because love dominates all though i speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not love it is nothing though i have faith to move mountains and have not love it is nothing love dominates all because god is love a god of love now yes sir if jesus said if a man loves me he will keep my words why because a lot you have to have love before you can have faith so there's so much expressions of faith but that may not be a love expressed faith oh i hope i can i just hope it can come from here out god help us because there's a human faith brother bam talked about a faith where people could get healed in a beatles con a concert brother bam talked about a faith that could make the chandelier go this way and that way and he said now that's just human faith that's just my faith we understand that so that's why we have to be careful seeing dynamic things happen right can be very deceptive it's got to be faith that workers by love and so we can see a human faith do tremendous things but we can't be deceived by that it may be genuine it may not be genuine i don't know but for me i have to my faith has to be based on love and we love him because he first loved us that means before that i can have the right kind of faith i have to know he first loved me that means i have to know where i was before i have to have a revelation of where i come from i have to have a revelation of who i am to have this right kind of faith i have to know where i came from i have to know who i really am i have to know i have to know why god loves me why does god have this unmovable unshakable love for me amen if it's not based on my conduct amen it was here before that i came into my earthly existence amen i didn't do anything to earn it amen i have to understand this kind of love it's different than any other kind of love i've ever experienced in this earthly journey and so the only way to understand this love is to go back to the origin of the love and then when you find that origin i find myself in that love in the origin i was loved there i am love there do you understand it's not that just i'm loved i am love because that's the word and i'm there and that makes me part of the word part of love i am love there i am the word there [Applause] i'll say it this way i am god there [Applause] i'm not talking about this but i'm talking about the sea gene of god on the inside was with god before the foundation of the world and when it was there you would look at it and say that's god you wouldn't say that's god's pieces you would just say that's god and one of those pieces he designated to come down amen and come forth in this body of flesh amen and so what is it that's where his love for me originates from there's a connection that transcends time that transcends distance that transcends actions that transcends everything else and that revelation is what will work true faith because if i was there and he brought me here is he going to lose me is he going to forget about me am i going to act so bad that he'll decide not to love me anymore you realize what the message came to do the message came to take every scare away from god's people so that they could actually move in the true genuine faith of god because they could never fully move into faith because there was always that scare that uncertainty that unknowing amen but he came and opened the seals so you could hear your name called so that you would know that your name is written on the lamb's book of life which means it was written before the foundation of the world which means when god was there alone with his attributes i was there amen and he loved me then and i was part of his love then and i'm part of his love now [Applause] and with that revelation what part of the word word won't work amen what's the problem [Applause] there is no problem i mean it looks like a problem but it's really not a problem with these eyes and this mind and this ears and this body and all the the fears and anxieties and worries and all these things that go on in us it looks like a big problem but if we could just go back to the foundation back before the foundation back when we were in him and look from that vantage point at what we're having we would say this is no problem [Applause] praise god praise be to god that's why faith work is by love because your love we love him because he first loved us and that's the only way we can have the right kind of love not emotional amen not up and down it's a love that's constant and solid it is the very love of god that is alive in our hearts amen praise be to god praise god let's go to first john chapter 4. now you see how vital the message was what else has ever been preached besides the ministry of jesus christ the apostle paul that told us these things where else are you going to get an understanding of where we came from and god's love for us where else will we know where else can you catch the revelation of where we come from and where we're going how else can we have the right kind of love that work as faith amen if we can't have that right kind of love that worketh faith then we cannot ever have the right working of faith or temperance or virtue or knowledge or brotherly kindness you realize without the revelation amen that the message the understanding that the message is given to the children of god we can never have the right operation of all of these virtues because they all the strength of all of these is love amen and we love him because he first loved us we have to have a revelation and and when he opened the seals he tore loose all the misunderstanding all the misconceptions and denomination and showed us who we really are [Applause] so that there can be a full expression of the stature of a perfect man couldn't be till now amen just to take the scare away so this message isn't optional this message didn't come to just add a little more understanding this message actually came so that there can be a manifestation of the life of jesus christ the stature of a perfect man [Music] and without this message is never going to happen first john chapter 4 verse 15 whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he in god that's a pretty safe place now i don't think that's temporary or changes all the time whosoever shall confess that jesus the son of god god dwelleth in him and he and god and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god i'm sorry and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us now you get the picture now you see what john's talking about amen john amen brother brahma said john amen he went on the isle of patmos and he got the revelation of jesus christ he saw the opening of the seals he heard the thunders amen he got the revelation he saw amen from the church ages all the way to the new heavens and new earth and he come back brother bam said he come back saying little children love one another he come back the apostle of love why because once you've seen that once you see what the reality is once you see god's already determined it it's already preset the names are already in the book he already knows who's going to be there he already knows what it's going to look like how many houses are there he already knows it all once you see that and you see that your position is secure then he can come back and say just love everybody everything's gonna work out just fine the one who hates you the one who likes you the one who's in between don't worry about it just love everybody love one another love your neighbor love everybody because the destination is already secure by revelation you've got a place by revelation you're there and if you're there who cares what's happening here because i'm there i've already made it i'm already in glory i'm already seated in heavenly places in christ jesus so if somebody spits on me who cares i've got a place reserved in a new heavens and new earth i'm already there if i lose everything i've already got everything i'm not going to lose anything there that's why with that kind of revelation the revelation the bride is supposed to be receiving now with that revelation he comes back and says love everybody love one another just love love love love love love it's not because he became a doting old man it's because he saw it's a finished work remember john saw 24 elders seated on the throne he saw he didn't see 23 he saw 24 and those elders are the apostles and the patriarchs meaning john was one of those seated on the throne so brother baptist said my brother said he looked to pass the current time and john saw john he said there's john amen so now he comes back to earth and he's like i got no problem what's the problem cut my head off no problem take all my money no problem put me in prison no problem hate my guts no problem are you not going to give me to hate you back because i've already i john saw john i'm already seated over there i know i'm already seated in heavenly places in christ jesus right now see if we could just catch the right revelation the love of god is so secure that before the foundation of the world he already saw you there if you can see yourself from before the foundation of the world to firmly plant it there then all the sudden faith worketh by that kind of love everything is secure everything is stable it's not shifting it's not moving it's all okay this life is a vapor it's a myth it's a few days and full of trouble [Music] it's the it's the shortest part of our of our journey right this earthly journey is the shortest part of our journey and so it's a blip on the radar friends it's a moment it's a hickey in the circle of eternity and we're getting all bent out of shade about the hickey when we're on the circle going round and round and round and eternity i'm already there my position is secure i'm already seated there i've already arrived i've already made it so let's not get bent out of shape about the hickey if there's giants he's going to have to take care of him because he already predetermined what i'm going to do in this life i don't know how he's going to do it but he still loves me your house burnt down he still loves me i mean i might cry because there's some things i like but i won't need none of those things over there you realize love is the basis for everything and if we could have that kind of love if we could recognize his love for us the security of the believer then all of a sudden our blood pressure would go back to normal we wouldn't need the pills to get through the night you realize we we we do this to ourselves because we forget who we are brother bravo says in the message spiritual amnesia from 1964 now in this amnesia we're told cause you to be a place where you cannot identify yourself oh my we came into this world with spiritual amnesia but when we come in contact with the word for our age what did it do it took away the spiritual amnesia so that we could identify ourselves that's why brother branham comes to the end of his ministry he said i'm so happy when i realized i was not the son of charles and elle branham why because he could properly identify himself now his identity wasn't with the flesh his identity was not with the natural his identity was found in god which is the word he says now they cannot you cannot identify yourself now it's it's an unusual thing it don't happen too often but the causes is from shock somebody that don't even know who they are you find it from war sometimes soldiers get it sometimes people get it another thing causes it is worry oh bring it home right now amen i wasn't in war i didn't get a shock another thing that causes amnesia is worry worry will cause it worry has no virtue to it at all yeah just skip worry and accept faith that sounds easy i mean tell that to somebody who's got anxiety say just skip worry and accept faith they're like tell me how as they ring the skin off of their hands the only way is to go back to revelation of who you really are anxiety is a real problem worry is a real problem different temperaments with different genetic makeup struggle with different things and some may really struggle with worry but the cure for worry is revelation it's not pills it's not a vacation it's not a nap the cure is revelation because you can take a pill and feel better but it's going to come back you can take a nap but the next time you're tired it's going to come back i mean you realize those are just cycles that we fall into but the only thing that will break the cycle amen is a revelation of who we are we've got to go back to the fundamentals where did i come from why am i here where am i going and does he delight in me and if we can answer those questions that's the thing to fight worry and anxiety with worry has no virtue to it at all yeah just skip worry and accept faith someone said well now what if you're going to be shot in the morning would you worry i said nope don't think so praise god paul and silas were worried when they were beaten and now i mean they hung in chains what were they doing worshiping not worrying [Music] what a lesson for us they were arrested they were beaten i mean somebody saying something bad about me is enough to get me worked up for a week what if they laid you over a stump and they beat you across the back to your skin was hanging off and you were bleeding that would hurt your feelings and a little more but somebody says something not nice about us or misjudges us or misquotes us or misunderstands our intention in something and we can't we can't think right for days but here they are taken beaten rejected amen chained to a wall amen and they're worshiping why because god was still delighting in them i mean it didn't feel like it if you're going off emotions and feelings i doubt you know the pain when they would wince every time that they would move it probably didn't feel like god's love but they they were basing love on something other than the situation they were in they were basing his love on a revelation of who they were and that wasn't changing with the beating that didn't change by arrest and that didn't change my imprisonment he said well what if you were going to be shot in the morning would you worry nope don't think so why said worry couldn't do nothing it couldn't do nothing but make me worse this is the point worry won't change it what's the value and worry brother said there's no virtue strength into it at all it cannot improve your situation in fact those who struggle with anxiety or worry we've all worried from time to time we've all had anxiety but i want to ask you a question the thing that you worried about most did it ever happen the way you worried about it happening never at least for me like i said before i'm 100 accurate at being wrong about the future so most of the time it's vanity it's a waste of time it's a waste of mental energy it's a waste of emotional energy all we do is waste our time waste our minds waste our emotions on nothing and the majority of the time the thing we're worried about comes to not by the time we get there anyhow we would have been better off just acting like everything's fine and keep walking because in walking usually the problems begin to resolve themselves just by moving forward worry could do nothing but make me worse it makes the situation worse why why does it make the situation worse because brother branham said amnesia can come on by worry you can't properly identify who you are we're so mentally bogged down in the trial we're in we're so uh we're so encapsulated all we can see is problems problems problems trouble trouble and i can see no way out of this situation and we begin to worry and what we do is is that worry the situation is blinding us to the revelation of who we are if god be for us who can be against us but that's not what we say when we're worrying worry has no virtue word could do nothing but make me worse well what good is it going to do to have faith i said it might deliver me and that's right see so worry has no virtue to it at all but faith has all virtue believe just believe it's going to work out okay no i can't do that because that's kind of foolish i mean just assume it's going to work out and move forward yeah assume it's going to work out and move forward assume god's going to take care of it assume god's going to answer the question assume god's going to give you some wisdom assume god's going to turn the light on just keep moving forward and assume that it's going to work out but isn't that kind of childish i mean you don't have a plan you don't know what's coming next amen just assume that god's going to take care of it and keep moving forward why no i can't do that no okay then just you just sit there and wring your hands and worry about it for another week and see if that changes anything it'll change nothing but what will faith do i'll just get in motion what if i'm going the wrong way god will turn me because he delights in me what if you're making a mistake god will correct me because he delights in me his love for me hasn't changed but nothing's going to happen with me sitting on my hands crying weeping wishing the situation would change or i wasn't in this predicament nothing will change and if i sit here afraid to do anything well i'm afraid to do that because that might happen i'm afraid to do this because am i and i'm afraid to do that so i'll just stay here well how fast does that change things file a pile of bones sitting right here worry can do nothing but make it worse but why don't we just assume that he delights in us why don't we just assume that he knows the way that i take and when i'm tried i shall come forth as gold why can't we assume that's just the truth for us why can't we assume the fossils of the righteous order of the lord need the light in his way why can't we assume that he knows where i'm at he knows the situation he knows i don't have any answers he knows i'm not smart enough he knows that i cannot figure it out i'm just going to move trusting that he'll show me he'll do something he'll move friends that's the way to get something done that's the way to get out of your trouble into a different situation is to move forward when moses began to cry out he says why christ speak speak to the children of israel that they move forward move forward where do you realize when he says speak to the children of israel that they move forward there was no forward to move to there was cliffs here army here water here but he told them to move forward anyways amen so they just started moving amen somewhere along the movement somewhere in their motion i don't know when and i don't know where i don't know if a few of them got ankle deep before the waters farted i don't know but he told him to move before he told him to lift his rod he told him go forward and then god said now lift up your rod he told him to get in action before he provided the way through [Music] why cry speak and go forward whatever situation you're in why cry i mean it's not changing anything why should one more tear why worry another night why not just move forward and say god you know the way that i take i i don't know what else to do this is the only thing i see all i know is you say why christ speak and go forward and i'm saying god i'm going forward in your name if i'm wrong move me if this is a mistake correct me amen i'm still your son and you still love me nothing's changed praise be to god friends worry will bring spiritual amnesia back on a believer where they can't properly identify themselves and they'll take measures that start looking like an unbeliever what do you mean they'll run around they'll try to provide for themselves they'll rack up credit cards trying to pay bills they'll do all they'll start acting like an unbeliever trying to take care of themselves provide for themselves go to the means of the world to fix everything instead of just moving forward and letting god make a way where there seems to be no way brother branham says in the message marriage and divorce now when i go overseas to make it right my little family gathers around and we pray with one another and i commit them to god and they commit me to god and when we do we go oversea i go overseas now i know she loves me i have confidence in her and her love and i love her she's got confidence in me as long as i love her like that she don't have any worry about me taking any other woman out and as long as she loves me right why there is no need of me thinking about any other man going out with her because she is my wife and i believe her i believe if i would actually do something wrong make a mistake and go out with some woman and return back and would confess it to her and tell her media i didn't mean to do that i just got caught in a trap this woman just ran right up to me and grabbed me by the arm and started sewing so i believe she would be understanding i believe she would forgive me for it but i wouldn't do it for nothing because i love her remember faith worketh by love i wouldn't do it because i love her though she would forgive me i wouldn't do it i wouldn't hurt her for nothing though i know she would forgive me for it i don't want to hurt her and that's the way it is with god if philia love which is human love fellowship love can make a man feel that way about his wife what about agape love the greek word meaning the love of god how would that make me do about jesus christ you see faith work is by love temperance by love patience by love amen all of these things work by love because if i've got the foundation of the love of god and i've got a revelation of of of my my position in christ then all of a sudden i wouldn't do anything to hurt me would he forgive me yes he would forgive me but i wouldn't do anything to hurt him i wouldn't do anything to displease him not on purpose not because i don't want to ever hurt him why because of love this this this kind of love and this kind of desire he is showing it with the desire between a husband and wife he said though my wife would forgive me i would never do nothing to hurt her i wouldn't want to hurt her he says in another place if i would do something wrong i'd feel the guiltiest man and i couldn't wait till the moment i could tell her what i did to make it right he said if that works that way with a man and a woman what about with god what about with you and god how is it supposed to work see this is the killer to religion the destroyer of religion the destroyer of rule keeping the destroyer of phariseeism because to be a to be a pharisee it's like trying to have a good marriage by doing everything right you're going to be tired i'm gonna have a good marriage because of everything right every tuesday i buy flowers every thursday we go on a date i remember every morning to say i love you honey i never leave without kissing her i know i always tell him i'm proud of him i never made a mistake we have a good marriage no you have a superficial marriage you have a marriage that can't endure hardship you have a marriage that's based on a surface level that's not very deep because if you if you make a mistake if you stroke the cat backwards one time see what happens see but a marriage that's based on true genuine love says if i did wrong she'd forgive me but i would as hard as i could never do anything to hurt her because i love her he says as long as i love her that way she's got confidence in me and as long as she loves me that way i've got confidence in her and though somebody would say something wrong or say something that hurt or i you would just forgive him and say that like brother branham did when mita slammed the door in his face oh lord you know she didn't mean that she's had a hard day she's always standing between them what's he doing he's interceding for her because they've got the right kind of love for his wife and if that works with marriage what about with god [Music] though he would forgive me everything in me wants to please him everything in me wants to keep his word if that's what he wants everything in me wants what he wants friends anything short of that is not right yet i just want to say it that way if anything short of that desire that everything inside of me wants to please him everything in me wants to do what he wants me to do wants to keep his word and if i ever fail it makes me miserable if i ever not because somebody found out about it or not because i had to confess it because i hurt him if i ever fail and not another living soul ever knows of my failure i have just as much grief that's true that's the real reality to loving god amen sometimes people only have grief when they're caught and when it makes a personal cost to them that's still loving self more than loving god but when not another soul will ever know what you've done and how you failed it but you're just as miserable and weep just as much amen and you go through just as much agony that's when you're starting to hit the right kind of love and say god i want to please you not man you see religion is a it becomes a form and a structure to where we can look like a christian without really being one religion is where we can look like a christian without really being one but an invisible union with christ is really being a christian a marriage union between us and christ is really being a christian and that is based on love love that comes back to a revelation of where i started and where i'm going to wind up amen it's not based on my conduct all of my conduct matters the seeing religion conducts the only thing that matters but in christianity love is the only thing that matters because love faith worketh by love and if you love him you keep his words works follow brother brahma says i i'm saved by faith faith worketh by love i'm saved by grace through faith he said but works is an expression of my love to him works are not required for the imputation of righteousness righteousness is imputed by my faith and faith worketh by love but my works my keeping his word and obeying and doing all in that that pleases him is an expression of my love so the cure for unbelief we say faith but i think the cure for unbelief is love because faith worketh by love and not an emotional love but a revelation that comes from god himself a real love of god that's dropped into my heart brother branham says and a greater than solomon is here the most horrible thing that there is friends is unbelief that's the only sin that there is there is no other sin but unbelief i was preaching on that some years ago in a methodist church he says and i was a nice big methodist church and most of them some of them believe in holiness and southern methodist and i was preaching about said committing adultery is not a sin telling lies not a sin taking lord's name is not a sin that was just too much for some dear old sister sitting there with her little collar all up around she said i pray you tell me what is sin that's right she just couldn't hold it any longer i said sin sin is this my sister sin is unbelief they do those things they commit adultery they tell lies they do those things it's the attributes of unbelief it's the attributes of unbelief see so many times we're chasing the attributes of unbelief trying not to smoke trying not to swear trying not to lie trying not to look trying not we spend so much time chasing the attributes of sin and not dealing with sin if i could just quit smoking if i could just quit if i could just turn my head like mother bear said turn my head if i could just stop this if if i didn't have those are attributes you know if i could just remember to be nice to my wife i could just remember if i could just think of her from time to time or if she could just think of me if i could remember or if i could say something nice if i would those are attributes of a problem that's not the problem the problem is there's something broken in the relationship and if the relationship gets right all the attributes of that relationship go right you think of one another you say nice things to one another you say nice things about one another you look to do things for each other because you have expressions of love because the relationship is right but when the relationship is broken all of a sudden we don't think of one another right we don't say nice things about one another we don't say nice things to one another we forget about one another and we don't put each other first and so we could try to make a list i've gotta make sure that i say i love you honey and i i like this and uh thank you for dinner see we're chasing the attributes and not going to the heart of the problem and we're trying to get the attributes right this is how religion works trying to get the attributes right and not realize we have a broken relationship with god and we've got all these attributes of unbelief because there's we've never come into unity with christ we've never gone into the third chamber which is the bedroom and become one with christ where relationships never went deep enough amen and so we're dealing with all kinds of attributes of unbelief but we're not getting down to the heart of what the problem is and if it works in a marriage amen what about with us in christ and if we can dig down a little bit deeper and we can move past all the superficial stuff amen saying hallelujah and showing up to church on time every time and never saying a bad word and always saying please and thank you if we could get past that and get down to the heart of it amen and find out where we came from and why christ died and who he died for and where was i when he was on the cross where was was i in him or out of him if i was in him then he loves me and always loves me if i was out of him i could never put myself in him if we could get down to the root of it why does he love me where does his love originate why is it i love him so much and we get down to the heart of it and we have a mended relationship when the relationship is mended all the attributes of unbelief begin to disappear because why would i lie why would i lie i was in him before the foundation of the world i'm going to eternity i come from eternity he loves me i have no desire to lie i have no desire the attributes begin to vanish away when we get down to the heart of the matter [Music] religion is man trying to live good but the reality is you'll never make it but the revelation of who we are unlocks a whole new dimension to us and we realize i'm a predestinated sea gene of god a part of god is living on the inside all i've got to do is deny myself amen and then live for him and out of this will come everything that will kill the attributes of unbelief and so we've got to get down to sin is unbelief amen what's the opposite unbelief faith faith worketh by love love is a revelation of who he is and who we are in him praise god amen brother branham went beyond the curtain of time and he comes back and he tells us you know there was people there i shook their hands i hugged their neck and he tells us about this experience he has beyond the curtain of time and he comes back and in the message adoption 1960 says oh lord that's when i'm here at the church for trying to set the church in order telling your brother and sister there's only one thing that can enter that that's perfect love he went there he saw what the reality was beyond the curtain of time and he came back and he said the only thing they can enter there is perfect love to me that's a religion killer i believe the message that's not what's required to enter there i mean you'll believe the message do you understand you can intellectually believe the message and not have what's required to enter there i was always a good boy i never sinned i never did anything wrong when when this man came to jesus the rich young ruler and he said hey what can i do to have eternal life he says you know the commandments honor father and mother do all this he said i've done all of that from my youth and the scripture says jesus beholding him loved him loved him and this man was talking religion what can i do what can i do to have eternal life what can i do have you turned a line we'll do this up yes got it in the bag i've done that since i was a kid jesus looking at him loved him loved him he said one thing you lack sell all that you have give it to the poor and come follow me what did jesus do he went right past his religion right to his heart right past the looking good right past the formalism right past the keeping the commandment and dressing right he went right past everything on the surface and went right down to his heart and when he when he got down to the heart this man loved his riches in position loved himself more than he loved the manifested word which was god jesus was god the manifested word on display and when it came down to he said take all those riches sell them all and come and follow me he got the greatest opportunity that a human being could receive and he walked away grieved because he had great riches and he come to the same showdown and he and he found out and what he realized what was real what we realized through all of this is he loved himself more than he loved jesus christ he loved himself more than he loved god amen that's what god wants to come to in every one of us he wants to cut past i've listened to 1200 sermons he wants to cut past i believe the message and cut past i dressed right and i act right and i go to church every time the doors are open he wants to cut all past that and says i want you to give up everything that you hold dear and come and follow me i want you to sell out everything i want you to die to everything i want to get down to the core of who you are and i want you to be willing to lose it all to come and follow me that's when we're getting past religion friends and getting down into a restored relationship amen and when that relationship goes from broken to restored you don't have to worry about the attributes they just come out when two people really love one another and they get married and they're based on a genuine or genuine real love for one another you don't have to worry about them being nice to each other it just happens amen you don't have to worry about it it's a it's an outcrop of a restored relationship the worst sickness in the world is unbelief the opposite of unbelief is faith but faith which worketh by love let's stand we'll just stop there we're not done but we're stopping for tonight musicians if you could come brother john make your way up i'll tell you what i was sitting today just looking out my window study and i was just meditating on this and i was thinking about john john caught up in the heavens through the open door beyond the church ages moving into the seeing the breach moving from the breach to the seals amen hearing the thunders seeing the millennium seeing the new heavens and new earth amen seeing it all he comes back he's not puffed up he's not arrogant he's not antagonistic he got the revelation we're supposed to be receiving and he comes back the apostle of love brother baby said in the quote i have it here but i didn't read it he says brother says i'm told when john got too old to preach he would just sit there and scream little children love one another couldn't preach no more but the most important thing you could say is little children love one another why god is love love if you have the right kind of love you don't have to worry about stealing why would you steal when god provides for me why would you lie when god has ears right right why would you do secret things in the dark when nobody's watching because god sees all you know if we're able to do those things if we're able to cheat people we're able to manipulate situations if we're able to deceive in secret and we're able to hide behind closed doors or do things in dark that we wouldn't do in the line amen all that we're doing is showing that we really don't believe god can see me now and hear me now and it's an expression of unbelief amen but when we come into the realities and contacting a real god oh you can get spiritual amnesia it can creep back through worry you can get a shock in your life you can fail you can fall you can do all of those things but you're going to get snapped back to reality before too long you're going to realize he saw me he heard me he knows the way i take and i'm going to repent right now we're not going to continue with a revelation of who god is we're not going to continue in those things you don't have to worry about it because you know he loves you and you've connected to him and you made a real connection and you know he always sees he always hears and he always knows and with the right kind of love we're going to say i don't want him to be displeased i don't want him to be hurt i don't want to do anything to hurt my lord because i love him you see how that fixes everything the problem just goes away if eve would have loved the word more than she loved herself we wouldn't be in this situation right now but the cure for the situation the atoning blood of jesus christ came because jesus loved the word more than he loved himself setting an example for us that we can follow in his footsteps oh i want the real i'm so hungry for the real i'm so i'm starving for the reality not to put on not the phony not the show i'm so sick of the show i'm starving for the realities of god for myself amen to live in that reality all the time to dwell with the people who have made contact with god they don't need to be prodded they don't need to be coached they mean they don't need all they need is to make that connection with god and god takes over all you got to do is point to the word and everybody's made that connection they run through the word amen there's no poking prodding there's no i mean there's no leading along with a carrot amen what should we be like as the bride of jesus christ amen i want the reality i say god give me the reality make me the reality of this love and this word on display let's bow our heads and pray lord god you've heard our prayer you see the hands that are raised you know the desire of our hearts we want the reality of this life lord god you've made every provision for us lord you've saw it all before you made sure everything was laid out just right and god we love you lord we thank you for the word that you've given in this hour to waken us out of spiritual amnesia so that we can see the realities so that we can properly identify who we really are now we ask oh that you would make us live in that lord let us live in that reality we love you father forgive us lord for our spiritual amnesia forgive us for our worry forgive us lord for our doubts and our fears and all of those things we just repent now lord help us to walk secure in your love for us help us lord to be reminded of your love every moment of every day so that we can react accordingly lord so that we can react with faith that worketh by love not by worry not by anxiety not by self-love but we can abandon ourselves because you love us oh god how we love you we ask that you have your way with us move upon your people so we go from here lord let us walk in the realities of your love and let it be on display in this world in jesus christ's name we pray amen i tell you friends there's no way to do that justice by preaching i'm done now and i know that i totally failed to preach it right but i hope that it hit the heart right i hope that between these lips and your heart that the the interpreter of the word come along and planted it right in your heart because i i don't know how in human words to express it i don't know how to explain it i don't know which angle to take it from to make it hit but we've got to get past the superficial and down to the reality back to the root amen back to the living god living in his people it's got to be real amen are counting me out amen everything that we see happening is just trying to move us back to where we're supposed to be not to have spiritual amnesia but to have an awakening of who we really are moving past the worry or worrying about when anybody else thinks if god saw me before the foundation of the world and he saw me in this predicament from before the foundation of the world then i don't have to take care of myself i don't have to provide for myself i don't have to protect myself i you realize we can actually abandon self it's not reckless it's not foolish it's the only option it's the only choice that makes any sense when you catch a revelation if he brought me here if he backed me into this corner if he brought all these situation to pass to get me here amen that it's then he decided to put me here before the foundation of the world i'm an expressed attribute of him he's not going to lose one he's already decided how he's going to win this victory and what comes next what i need to do is forget all my ideas quit trying to preserve my life quit trying to save my reputation and just say god it's all you i take my hands off the wheel isn't that dangerous it's the safest thing you can ever do i just just trust him we've got to just speak and move forward say i trust you lord to direct my steps i'm moving with no idea where i'm going but i can't sit still anymore i'm moving but i'm trusting that as i pick my feet up that you'll put them down in the center of your will your rod and your staff they come from me you can guide me you can correct me but i'm not going to sit here and worry i'm going to be in motion and ask you to steer the ship oh god i want the realities so so so sick of everything else so much pretense so much showmanship so much egotistical trying to make ourselves look good and so much i mean so much hedging so we look a certain way in front of a certain person i'm so sick of all of it i'm so sick and tired of every bit of my humanity and all the humanity around me i just wanted to be jesus christ on display i just want to give it all up amen i look like a fool that's okay all it does is express what i am on my human side anyways nothing but dirt amen look childish that's okay i'm a child of god amen look ignorant perfect i have no idea he has all the ideas you see we've got to get away from this posturing and hedging and just forget it friends just live for him just live the reality of the word let's sing a song so i'll quit preaching your song brother amen i preach every service like it's my last i don't know how to do any different friends if god would take me from this earth i want the last thing that you hear to say get the rio and forget the fake amen we don't want the phony we want the reality we don't want the show amen i don't care about the show and i don't care how it looks and many of you realize the true christianity never looked good the hybrid is what looked good the reality didn't ever look good but it was good i'm tired of what looks good i want what is good i'm tired of everything man has done and everything has man is done with religion man is done with the word and man is done with the message i'm sick of all of it i just want him what attracted me to the message it was his voice calling me what attracted me to this life it was him i could see him i could see him the one i've heard about since i was a child the one i've read about in the bible it was him expressing himself to me and that's all i want i want it with everything that's in my heart and i want to connect to that and stay connected to that and forget everything else he'll take care of it what'll happen next i don't know but i i do know i can say accurately what will happen next exactly what he predestinated to happen next and if that's the truth can't we rest in that oh you're in a bad situation what's going to happen next whatever he determined before the foundation of the world to happen next is exactly what's happening next then why worry why fret why spend so many sleepless nights i'm not preaching to you i'm preaching to me [Music] what's going to happen is what he's determined to happen i'm just going to work to stay out of his way and humble myself and be still and quiet and let him do what he's already determined to do and it's going to be perfect and i'm going to be amazed and he's going to get all the credit let's sing a song circle preaching let's try this again [Music] oh by his word i'll never
