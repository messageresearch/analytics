[0:00] for when God had you in his thinking at
[0:02] the beginning you have to be some part
[0:04] of you your life that's in you now had
[0:07] to be with God before there well when he
[0:10] before he even became material on Earth
[0:13] before there was anything but God you
[0:15] were one of his attributes he knowed
[0:17] what your name would be he know the
[0:19] color of your hair you would have he
[0:20] know all about you the only thing
[0:22] happened is when you being a sinner many
[0:24] of you can fellowship with me on this
[0:26] thought when you was a little boy or
[0:27] little girl you walked you would walk
[0:30] walk around there and would be certain
[0:31] things that would just where it wouldn't
[0:33] bother the other kids it seemed like
[0:35] there was something in you that cried
[0:36] out there was God somewhere yet you were
[0:39] a sinner you remember that certainly now
[0:42] what was that that was that little form
[0:45] of life in you then and then after a
[0:48] while you heard the gospel maybe you
[0:50] went to church you picked out this and
[0:52] that you went from denomination to
[0:54] denomination but one day you being part
[0:56] of God you had to be part of the word
[0:59] and when you heard the word you know
[1:02] where you come from you know what was
[1:04] the truth you were always the seed was
[1:07] in you always the word seen the word
[1:10] that was in you that was before the
[1:11] foundation of the world saw the word and
[1:13] you came to it amen so why are you
[1:16] sitting here tonight as a c gen of God
[1:19] Amen because you were part of God you
[1:21] were in God's thinking before the
[1:22] foundation of the world you always had
[1:24] eternal life you were always part of God
[1:26] but amen that part that seed was in you
[1:28] then but at some point the word called
[1:30] to the word amen and it come together
[1:33] and activated the word inside and that
[1:35] seed come to life and what caused that
[1:36] seed come to life when you died to the
[1:39] outside man and you recognized who you
[1:40] were and you surrendered your life to
[1:42] God and you died out and that seed came
[1:44] to life yeah but I don't believe that
[1:47] seed came to life which is a part of God
[1:50] only for you to have life right but
[1:53] maybe that seed came to life so that
[1:56] others could have life as well am so so
[2:00] many times we take an entrical view of
[2:02] everything in the gospel everything's
[2:04] about me God died for me God come to
[2:06] save me and there's truth and all of
[2:08] that but the problem is we keep getting
[2:10] so focused on self on self on self but
[2:12] Christ was never focused on self he was
[2:15] focused on the purpose of God he came to
[2:17] save that which was lost he came for
[2:19] Redemption everything he came for was so
[2:21] that he could give up everything Earthly
[2:24] amen for Eternal
[2:26] purposes he came to be the Lamb of God
[2:29] that takes away the sin of the
[2:30] world so the question is why did you
[2:33] come
[2:36] amen maybe to serve an eternal
[2:39] purpose and maybe that Eternal purpose
[2:41] is more than just so that we could feel
[2:44] good and we could be happy and we could
[2:46] have a nice family and we can go to
[2:47] Heaven
[2:49] someday maybe there's more at
[2:52] stake maybe there's more to be expressed
[2:55] maybe there's more life that he was
[2:57] maybe there's more life that can come
[2:59] when I die died yeah and he lives
