[0:00] there's these ties that take take that
[0:01] hay as it comes up and they slide it
[0:03] over into the bale chamber
[0:05] and they go over
[0:07] everything's keeping time with the
[0:08] flywheel
[0:10] well also on that gearbox there's a big
[0:11] plunger
[0:13] 14 inches
[0:14] tall 18 inches wide the same size as the
[0:17] bale
[0:18] that's the size of the of the bale
[0:19] chamber the hate comes in there
[0:22] and that plunger
[0:23] punches it
[0:24] and it's just a steady rhythm so i've
[0:27] spent many an hour standing on that
[0:28] wagon
[0:29] the wagon's rocking
[0:31] and the baler is rocking as that plunger
[0:33] big old heavy thing it's a plunging and
[0:35] it's making a it's going at 540 rpm that
[0:39] plunger's making oh
[0:41] 70 or 80
[0:43] strokes per minute
[0:45] one stroke in less than a second
[0:51] i can hear it now and that plunger is
[0:53] just plunging away cutting it and
[0:54] plunging it and everything looks like
[0:56] making a lot of noise and a lot of dust
[0:58] and a lot of things going on but in the
[1:01] back
[1:02] there's
[1:03] a fascinating mechanism to me it's
[1:06] called the knotter
[1:07] it's a little unit there sets up there
[1:09] and it ties the knots in the haystream
[1:12] it's not doing anything
[1:13] it's just sitting there
[1:15] not doing a single
[1:17] thing
[1:18] all this work going on
[1:20] tines are working cross speed going
[1:22] flywheels are spinning the plungers are
[1:24] plunging
[1:25] tractors are groaning grunting and the
[1:27] guy on the wagon he's a he's a working
[1:29] and the knotters just sit there
[1:31] not doing a single thing there's not
[1:33] much happening on the back of that baler
[1:35] except for one little wheel
[1:36] it's a little star-shaped wheel about
[1:38] that big and it as the hay comes into
[1:40] the chamber that little wheel
[1:43] touches it and it just turns ever so
[1:46] slowly
[1:47] and as that turns slowly
[1:49] it drives a shaft
[1:51] there's a lever on that shaft
[1:53] and as that shaft turns it slowly goes
[1:56] it'll only go up about two inches
[1:58] slowly raises and when it gets to the
[2:01] top
[2:02] it releases snaps a clutch
[2:04] as the plunger comes back out of the
[2:06] chamber two two needles with strings
[2:08] attached to them come up through the
[2:10] bottom the plunger comes back and it's
[2:12] getting ready to come right back in
[2:13] there and snap those needles off that
[2:15] comes up there the knotters flip in a
[2:17] split second tie the knots cut the
[2:19] strings the needles come back out
[2:23] back going at it again
[2:25] and then nothing's happened in the back
[2:27] just that little wheel slowly turning
[2:29] nodders just sitting there
[2:32] needles just sitting there
[2:33] nothing's
[2:34] happening but that metering wheel
[2:37] is slowly turning marking out the time
[2:40] marking out the length of that bale
[2:42] it knows when to tie the bale
[2:44] the guy on the tractor he doesn't
[2:46] determine that the guy on the wagon he
[2:48] doesn't determine that they can adjust
[2:50] it and as they need to
[2:52] but when everything's set properly they
[2:54] just need to wait
[2:56] maybe that tractor not wagon go
[2:59] a quarter mile down the road because
[3:00] because maybe there's not much hay just
[3:02] a little bit and there's not enough to
[3:03] make a bale
[3:05] don't get up there and try to tie the
[3:06] bale
[3:07] the metering wheel knows when it's time
[3:09] to tie the tie the bale
[3:11] just rest
[3:12] and we think you know in our lives
[3:15] nothing's happening
[3:17] i said lord nothing's happening i pray
[3:19] for something nothing happens
[3:21] it's just that same old
[3:23] grind of every day
[3:25] go to work clock in clock out
[3:29] go to church
[3:31] sunday wednesday nothing's happened
[3:34] lord what are you doing what's happening
[3:36] nothing's happening in my life but his
[3:38] wheel is turning
[3:40] measuring knowing
[3:42] the right time to trigger everything and
[3:45] then when it does everything's got to
[3:46] work instantly within less than a second
[3:49] because that plunger is coming right
[3:50] back in less than a second
[3:53] everything's got to get up there tie the
[3:55] knots get get out of the way and go
[3:57] right back to the same old mundane
[3:59] monday through friday
[4:01] wash the kids face feed them their
[4:03] breakfast clean up after them go to
[4:05] church come home clock in clock out
[4:11] nothing's
[4:12] happening god knows
[4:15] he's got a metering wheel on your life
[4:17] in my life
