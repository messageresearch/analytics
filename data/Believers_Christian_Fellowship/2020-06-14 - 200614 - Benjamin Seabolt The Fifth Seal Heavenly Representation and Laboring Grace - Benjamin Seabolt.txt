TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Applause] we're partakers of his grace we shall need him to be like him we shall see him face [Applause] kings and priests to god we shall reign with him forever [Applause] we are family i lift it up my soul overflow fill it up oh my soul fill it [Music] me my is is let's just pray together precious lord jesus lord we're so thankful that you've provided something with inside of us lord that you could feel lord because we know if it wasn't for that that it would just be like water on a duck's back father and it would have no effect on us but by your love and your predestination you've gave us a receptor on the inside of the inside that we could hear your voice lord and it could have an effect on our life lord we would never want to underestimate the value of that lord never under appreciate what that really means for we know without that there would be no purpose lord we would just pray that you would come at this point in the service and just do what only you can do father lord we stand here as a mere mortal father totally incapable of doing what is required father but we know that you can so we just pray that you would come that you have your perfect will that you would speak what you want spoken father and that you would just hear through each and every one that's here that your divine purpose for this service will be accomplished we just commit ourselves to you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you this morning if you have your bible we'll go straight to the scripture we're going to turn to the book of revelation chapter 6. i'm going to go ahead and apologize for taking so much time for preaching this morning so that way here in about six hours i don't have to apologize again and now that i've scared you to death about six hours worth of preaching when i only go two or three it won't seem near as bad at least that's my thought process i don't i don't know if that will manifest or not but we definitely come with a full heart a lot of information a lot of material and we just want the lord to have his way more than anything if if he would just come and speak for 10 minutes it would be more than me standing here reciting an intellectual speech for all day or just reading quotes and scriptures we have to have to have a supernatural element and that's what we desire for him to have his perfect will but i'd like to speak this morning on on the fifth seal and there's a couple topics that that we'll get into underneath of this fifth seal as we move forward but as our pastor was ministering two sundays ago on the sixth seal there at the crucifixion there was just so many things that clicked during that service it was really overwhelming to me and i've kind of been beside beside myself for the last two weeks because it just keeps unfolding so as kyle said you know wednesday we're starting to bite off more than we can chew on a regular routine basis now but i think that's scriptural because even john in the book of revelation it comes to a point he's seen all these things and finally he comes and there's this great group of people and the angel asked him you know who are these and john just says i don't know you tell me so i think that's kind of the point that we're coming to even as we go higher and higher and higher in revelation and it's so wonderful and we can see that portion so clearly but it opens up so other so many other avenues and other questions that it's just astounding but we just have to keep walking in the channel that he's in and he'll make known what is needed to be made known and we trust him to do that so in revelation chapter 6 beginning in verse 9. [Music] it says and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled may god add his blessing to the reading of his word as you would have your seats and the thought that i want to start with that just really struck me a couple sundays ago when he was dealing with the sixth seal there at the crucifixion and he was really laboring on the sixth seal and what that meant at the time of the crucifixion but the thought that just clicked with me during that service was not only was the sixth seal being manifested at that time but for that particular situation speaking specifically of the crucifixion and the times surrounding right around the crucifixion literally every seal was made manifest at that time and we know that that's not an uncommon thing because as we go back and look at the scriptures we can track those seals through every situation through each person through each pattern through each time element but the one that i just really want to focus on this morning is surrounding the first crucifixion of jesus christ and let's go to matthew 26 and we'll begin there and i think by doing this we're going to i think it will help us and enable us to realize how simple that these seals are made manifest and how simple they can be made manifest in our lives on a daily basis and that's what i want us to catch matthew 26 verse 1 it says and it came to pass when jesus had finished all these sayings he said unto his disciples ye know that after two days and this is the feast of the passover and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified then assembled together the chief priest and the scribes and the elders of the people unto the palace of the high priest who was called cataphasis caiaphas i'm sorry and consulted that they might take jesus by sebtility and kill him so if we remember a couple years back when brother when our pastor preached on the series of the seals and he exposed that pattern that was laying in the seals of how brother branham would come and even before he would get into the scriptures and the information of the seals he would start dropping parables in there and he'd say now just the other day i was talking to so and so and he would actually loose the seal 30 seconds into preaching and it just goes over the top of the heads of people sitting there and it went over the top of our heads for years and years and years and years but thankfully now that we see that key we can recognize what was going on and we know that as he took that and he laid that over each seal how simple but yet how profound that key was because now you realize brother branham will spend an hour and a half breaking the seal in such simplicity that when he acts that when he gets to the information of the seal he'll spend 15-20 minutes on it and he's done with it so it's just astounding that he would waste all of this time beforehand take 15 minutes and break the seal and then close the service so we have to as we get into this topic this morning we have to really let that bear on our mind and if we will we'll recognize right here in verse 4 the white horse rider just wrote consulted they may take jesus by subtility and kill him there went the white horse rider deception going forth sneakiness going forth and you can see that the white horse rider never wanted to stay the white horse rider because immediately it said that their goal was to kill him who would have thought two of the four horse riders were right there in that verse but they're clear as they right there they consulted that they might take jesus by septility and kill him skipping to verse 14. then one of the twelve called judas iscariot went unto the chief priest and said unto them what will you give me and i will deliver him unto you and they coveted with him for 30 pieces of silver so now just in verse 14 and 15 we recognize that this third horse rider rides because he's dealing with the clergy and he's trying to sell them salvation in such simplicity these patterns lay right in there so now we've already had the first horse rider run it showed he was going to end up on the fourth one we've got the third seal going forth let's go to verse 47 in the same chapter matthew 26 26 47 and while he yet spake lo judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and stabs what horse you reckon that's right from the chief priest and the elders of the people now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever i shall kiss the same as he hold him fast and forthwith he came to jesus and said hell master and kissed him notice when that white horse rider rode he didn't stop riding just because the goal was to get on the fourth horse and just because the third horse had rode that white horse kept riding so here he came to this to the scribes and the pharisees and they consulted with deception and subtility full-blown white horse but yet judas keeps writing to the point that he comes up into the very face of christ himself and kisses him so here's the white horse standing kissing jesus and the red horse is right behind him at the same time i'll just say it like our pastor says it we have to let carnal thinking just completely go away we have to get out of the chronological one two three okay now the third one's over the fourth one's got to be coming it's not like that at all it's nothing like we thought saints when that first horse starts writing it just keeps writing and it keeps writing you can have multiple situations in your personal life that you are in full-blown spiritual famine in and there'll be another situation going on that's coming to you on a white horse at the same time it happened right here in the scripture to christ himself coming at him at the same time same thing will happen in our lives hell master and kissed him and jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come then came they laid hands on jesus and took him let's skip down to verse 59 now the chief priest and the elders and all the council sought false witness against jesus to put him to death what do false witnesses not have let me rephrase the question so you'll be sure to catch it what are false witnesses in famine of black horse rider riding for all he's worth one two three four just right down through there in such simplicity and it lays right here in one chapter of the bible in a few verses in one situation in one scenario sought false witnesses against jesus to put him to death but found none they were so false they was in famine of false wrap your mind around that but found none yea though many false witnesses came yet found they none at the last came two false witnesses and said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days and the high priest arose and said unto him answer us now nothing what is it which these witness against thee but jesus held his peace and the high priest answered and said unto him i adjure thee we touched on this a couple services back but this is just such an incredible passage of scripture to me and the high priest answered and said unto him i adjure thee by the living god that thou tell us whether thou be the christ the son of god so as we said last time here is the high priest of the day standing in front of the living god demanding he in the name of the living god that he tell him if he's the living god or not if this is not a pale horse riding in its full force you tell me what else is he's standing in the face of god himself literally and using his name to injunct him and to demand that he tell him who he is and if you don't think it's a pell horse look at what jesus does he says thou has said he answered him he gave him the desire that he was wanting he gave the the high priest asked him a yes or no question yes or no in the name of the living god tell me yes or no jesus says thou has said see saints once you get on that pale horse god himself can stand and look you in the face and tell you the truth and you'll never recognize it when you hit the pale horse you're done brother branham says death means eternal separation from christ god himself cannot get you amen he asked him a yes or no question in the name of the living god and jesus said yes thou has said and he couldn't comprehend it pale horse nothing follows but hell thank god a believer cannot get on that horse i cannot think of anything that would be worse than standing before the face of the living god asking him if he is the living god and he tells me yes i'm the living god and i would be so spiritually dead i would not be able to comprehend that there could be nothing worse than that saints because you're beyond hope and if you have hope if you don't even have hope what do you have nothing you're done you're finished there is nothing worse there is nothing left but hell praise god a believer cannot get there he'll cut the legs off of that black horse he'll chop its head off he'll do whatever he has to do to a believer when they're riding that black horse to keep them from getting on a pale horse amen jesus said unto him thou has said nevertheless i say unto you hereafter shall you see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven then the high priest rent his clothes saying he hath spoken blasphemy what father need have we of witness behold now ye have heard this blasphemy what thank thee they answered and said he is guilty of death why do you think they thought he was guilty of death because that's what the pale horse thinks the pel horse thinks he's guilty of death each and every time let's skip to matthew 27 just the next chapter over verse 45. matthew 27 verse 45. now from the sixth hour there was darkness what seal do you think we're talking about here we've just spent our pastors spent multiple services on it i'm not going to lay heavy on this we see this very clearly we know what seal this is there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying ella ella lama sabbath i may not have said that right that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me clearly the sick still demonstrated us here so now here's a very interesting thing we've had the first seal correct second seal third seal the fourth seal and we've had the sixth seal we've had five of the seven seals here in matthew but if you look you'll not find the fifth or the seventh seal in matthew let's go to john 19. john 19 verse 28 after this jesus knowing all things were now accomplished what seal does that sound like to you you will not find that in matthew mark or luke jesus knowing that all things were accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst now there was a set of vessel there was a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost it's astounding to me that matthew mark and luke does not record jesus saying it is finished matthew records him saying my father my father why has thou forsaken me luke records him saying that into your hands i commit my spirit matthew mark and luke did not catch the seventh seal and it wasn't even their fault because the pattern already be laid out that the bride would be the only one to catch that seventh seal you have to go to john to catch the seventh seal he said the same thing saints it wasn't like there was two different times going on and some of them heard one thing at this time and then at another time somebody heard this this was the same situation the same time but yet john's the only one that thinks it's important to record he says it's finished wonder why the scripture is so precisely perfect it's astounding it's astounding there's a couple other things we'll get to along those lines later on but john is the only one that recognizes that these scriptures have been completed my purpose is fulfilled it is finished seventh seal but you notice we're still missing the fifth seal do you think matthew mark luke or john has that one let's skip down to verse 31 same chapter verse 31 the jews therefore because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for that sabbath day was on on high day besott pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might take them away then came the soldiers and break the legs of the first and and the other which was crucified with him but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they break not his legs but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water this is in the book of john who just loosed the seventh seal comes to verse 34 and you will not find this in matthew mark or luke john is the only one that recounts that there was one of the soldiers that came took a spear and thrusted into the side of jesus christ he had a nail in this hand he had a nail in his hand he had a nail through each feet that's four but the fifth seal comes because the fifth seal is me and you and that roman soldier even though he was already dead has to has to has to take that spear and run it through the ribs of jesus right into his heart and loose that fifth seal that was his fifth wound saints he had to have five wounds because the fifth seal is heavenly representation and laboring grace heavenly representation and laboring grace those first four seals those first four horse riders put jesus laying down on the earth on a cross and tacked four nails three nails through four parts of his body the extremities of his body one through each hand one through each foot a total of four wounds but now now the scene changes because he's lifted from the earth and he's put into the heavens and the fifth seal is ran into the bottom of his heart and blood and water comes out that blood and that water was you and i saints and we did not come out on the earth because we are not an earthly people the jews are an earthly people that's why the jews says where did you get these scars in your hands the bride is a spiritual people they are heavenly people their representation is a heavenly being he's put into the heavens and that spear ran into his side brother branham said that he didn't die of the wounds he died of a broken heart he he said the chemistry of his body was so made that you and i could not have the reaction in our bodies that he had he said that it would be impossible for our blood and our water to do that only jesus christ was physically capable of the blood and the water separating in his body he said he did that he died of a broken heart his heart was so broken that the literal blood and water the chemistry of his body broke apart and separated and that's what killed him because the wounds did not kill him the wounds did not kill him and it's proven because the soldiers were coming to him because they needed to get him off the cross they needed to kill him they needed to finish killing him so they broke the legs of the others but when they come to him they said he's already dead but to make sure they thrust the spear into this side and the blood and the water comes out but brother branham says his body had a reaction that ours couldn't have because sea saints no matter how lonely you are and how depressed you are you can never be as lonely and depressed as he was because he was god see we can get as low as loki and i'm not belittling that we can get low i'm not saying it's not a real situation but we still have god to look to he came to the point that he says my father my father why hast thou forsaken me he got to the point that he his father had forsaken him and it caused he had no more hope saints he was done if if his father for if our heavenly father forsakes us you tell me what hope we have we are done but he comes to that situation and it causes see the reason we can't have that reaction in our body is because we can never get that low i say thank god thank god i can't have that reaction thank god that i no matter how low that we get we will always be able to look to him and have a hope but he has no hope and this causes a reaction that no other human being can have because no other human being can get in that position only he can and it separates and it causes his death but even though he's dead he is dead saints not struggling for life not a little bit of life he is dead and that's still not good enough now even though he's dead they take the spear and thrust it through his ribs into his heart and blood and water comes out brother branham says that we were identified in that blood and water he said because when they pierced his side they loosed the bride that was the whole purpose of that event they pierced that side where is the bride's position saints where was eve's position why didn't they stab him in the stomach why didn't they stab him in the head why didn't they stab him anywhere besides right in the heart of god don't ever belittle your position saints god himself thought so much of you and i that even after he had died he allowed a spear to be ran into his heart so that we wouldn't miss our position amen even after he was dead he had already paid the price there was no more price to be paid it was finished he said it was finished but i wonder he was really on his mind when he was on the cross that he would die of a broken heart and that still wasn't good enough he would allow them to run a spear into his heart and loose that fifth seal see all the other seals had been loose saints we just went through them all the other ones had been loosed but the fifth seal the fifth seal was heavenly representation and laboring grace and the fifth seal always goes into full manifestation after a crucifixion after a crucifixion let's go to the fourth seal brother branham speaking he says here's the fourth seal open and the rider to the four horses is revealed to the best of my knowledge i have to give a disclaimer here i'm leaning a little bit more towards teaching this morning as you can tell and brother brandon says when you go to teach and you're already on thin ice so he has to have a good pastor to keep him in line so i am perfectly fine if i get out of line for the pastor to correct me from the pulpit i have no shame he can come up and say brother benjamin said this and it's not right it's actually this now i have a real freedom and a liberty i can just speak my heart to you so i'm perfectly fine with that because it's it's not about being right saints it is about being right but it's not about being right for the sake of being right it's about really being right so we're leaning that way this morning and there's a lot of things that are heavy and they're deep and we're going to get into them and if i could just speak it the way that i see it in my heart there would be zero issues i know for a fact because the picture and the revelation is precise and it's pure and it's accurate but i'm immortal and i'm a human and i may say something wrong so i've got the pastor has full permission to clean up any mess that i make no shame on my part he says in the fourth seal it's open the riders the four horses is revealed to the best of my knowledge now this all takes place on earth speaking of the first four seals this all takes place on earth next seal we see is in heaven where souls under the altar now just in closing i want to say these few words here i got wrote down we have skipped about on these four seals now tomorrow night we change the scene from the earth things going on he looks up here and sees these souls under the altar the sacrifice altar he says we've been on earth dealing with these four seals the first four seals but he says tomorrow night when we come to the fifth seal the scene changes it's no more earthly it's he's saying this in the fourth seal so they'll come with a prepared mind because if you approach the for the fifth seal with earthly thinking you'll never catch it he says the scene changes and it goes into the heavenlies see this is this is why jesus had to be lifted off of the earth by the four horse riders and put into heaven because the scene was changing the pattern had already been laid down in the seals see the word was written the seals were written well before jesus arrived on earth the principles and the pattern is already there when he comes he's going to come in that pattern when we come we're going to come in that pattern the pattern is not going to change they couldn't have left jesus jesus could not have died while he was laying on the earth on that cross he had to be lifted into the heavens had to be and that's why john was the only one to record that because john was the only one that was lifted into the heavens to see it and now brother branham comes to preach the seals and he thinks it's important to let them know when they're finishing up the fourth seal that the scene is changing and we're going into the heavenly dimension tomorrow i wonder why he thinks that's important because he sees the pattern in the scripture clearly we change the scene from the earth things going he looks up here the souls under the altar the fourth seal spiritual death why did there have to be four soldiers at the foot of the cross fluke somebody called off work no saints it was there so we wouldn't miss it the four lifted him off of the earth into the heavens i'm not making that up it's in the scripture there were four soldiers you can go back and look at that the the spiritual death of the clergy in that day was what put him on that cross there were four soldiers tacked him to that cross lifted him up into the heavens when we see in this situation if we can just grasp if the word of god is so precise and so perfect that it's right down to these nitty gritty details that there has to be four soldiers and they have to lift him off the earth to run to display the fifth seal by creating that fifth wound in his side this is not just some ideas we're following saints this is so profoundly perfect it's astonishing and you can look at that on one hand and say okay well so what but if you catch the principle under that you can look at and apply it to you that if he's that accurate and that precise over these little bitty details what about his bride what about your life what about my life is there anything going on by chance if he's that concerned about these little details if his eye is on the sparrow what does he think about the details of what you're going through right now you think it's by chance i would say that if you would get out of carnal thinking and get into heavenly atmosphere you'll probably see how some of these seals are being displayed in that situation you're in right now i would venture to say that's true john's the only one to catch this fifth and seventh seal because the fifth and the seventh seal is where the bride's located we know the bride's located in the anointings that combat the horse riders but you're not identified in that seal are you identified on a white horse with deception a red horse taking peace a black horse of spiritual famine you're not identified there you've remember brother brown says the seals loose the entire bible and the end of time message was this revelation of the seals so everything is encompassed in the seals so if you exist you're in the seals you pick which one you want to be in i don't want to be in any of the first four i sure don't want to be under a judgment seal we know that that judgment still has an effect on the believer to bring them back but i'm not identified in trials and tribulation i'm identified in the fifth seal of grace and the seventh seal of his coming and completion that's where i'm identified at so those are the ones that john funny those are the ones that john only john speaks about because that's john's message let's go to john 12. john chapter 12 verse 20. i know i'm not running around up here and jumping and screaming and clapping my hands and sweating up a storm but that really won't do you any good truth be told what will do you good if you catch the spiritual principle under this seal that's what will do us good john 12 and 20. and there were certain greeks now up to this point they've been dealing in the jewish country they've been dealing with jews but now at this point in john 12 here comes some gentiles i wonder if the scene's changing verse 20 and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast and the same came therefore to philip which was of bethesda of galilee and desired of him saying sir we would see jesus philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew and philip tell jesus and jesus answered them saying the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified gentiles come and say we want to see jesus and jesus's response is okay yeah bring him on over no no it wasn't his response when his deci his his disciples come to him and said there's gentiles wanting to see you his immediate response it is the hour for the son of man to be glorified you think he said this by chance no no he knows the scene is about to change the son of it is the hour the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified that is his response when a gentile comes to him verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life if any man serve me let me follow let him follow me and where i am there also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour but for this hour but for this cause i came unto this hour i thought he said the son of man was going to be glorified there's nothing glorious sounding about that to me a corn of wheat unless it falls in and dies it abideth alone he that hateth his life and loses it he just said it's the hour the son of man should be glorified see god's interpretation of glory and glorification is his word being fulfilled not us walking around with a smile on our face skipping our heels on the clouds all the time we have to take a scriptural definition of what he means and he gives it to us immediately gentiles come son of man is to be glorified unless a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone forever i'm skipping ahead but this is the first crucifixion and remember we had a prophet come and given an indictment for a second crucifixion what pattern do you think that's going to follow what glorification do you think that bride's going to receive if any man no let's skip on down father verse 28 father glorify thy name then came there a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and i will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered it thundered while he's speaking to these about these gentiles that's probably coincidence others said an angel spoke to him oh that's probably coincidence too because there surely wouldn't be an angel speaking about thunders when there's a gentile present it is so precise it's shocking saints it is shocking and jesus answered and said the voice came not because of me but for your sakes therefore i send you elijah prophet and if i don't i will smite the earth with a curse it didn't come for his sake it came for our sake now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be castel verse 32 and i if if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me you tell me how important it was that he was lifted up from the earth you tell me how important it was that he displayed that fifth seal of heavenly representation not earthly representation heavenly representation at the time of his crucifixion if i be lifted up from the earth i will draw all men unto me if i be lifted up from the earth we know that those first four horse riders overlapped the church ages and rode through the church ages i'm speaking specifically about that context now those those horse riders rode through the church ages but jesus says if i be lifted up from the earth i'll draw all men unto me how important do you think it is that the end of chapter 3 at the end of the laodicean church age that voice says to john come up higher how important do you think it is that we come up higher because jesus says if i be lifted up from the earth i will draw all men unto you me how do you think that you're going to be drawn under him under a laodicean condition it is totally against the pattern of the word of god from genesis to revelation it will not work we are a spiritual people we have got to get into a spiritual dimension have to and that spiritual dimension will only come by going through that open door and there is only one person that opened that door and that was the lamb through his vindicated prophet nothing else will work anything else will leave you in an earthly condition and you will not be drawn to him it is impossible in the fifth seal this is where i want to re remind you to reflect back on the principles on the key that was given us for those other seals where brother branham would loose it in the parables look how simply he loses this seal to us he comes to paragraph 44 right at the beginning of the seal some of the best friends that i know are catholics do you realize and the man may be sitting here tonight perhaps is the only way that we got this tabernacle built because a roman catholic stood on his feet in the court there and went to the front for me boy like nobody would do that's right and they couldn't turn it down well that's nice we appreciate that brother he just loosed the seal saints see the seal oh god help me the seal was not the information written in let me say the seal was just not was not just the information written there in chapter six adam didn't remember the seals that were restored to us is what adam lost adam did not walk around in the garden with a book that says the sixth seal is such and such the fifth seal is this this adam walked around with spiritual principles brother branham says that in the garden of eden there was those two trees standing there in the church book and he says those were not literal trees those were those represented spiritual principles so when we come to this fifth seal the information that is laying there in symbolic form yes that has to be interpreted yes that has to be loosed but the seal itself is anytime the spiritual principle that is under that seal is being spoken about that is when that seal is being loosed does that make sense so now we can clearly see here in paragraph 44 he just loosed the fifth seal because the fifth seal is heavenly representation and laboring grace see he's telling a story about how this roman catholic this dear friend of his went to the court for him and he went to the front for him like nobody else could do nobody else could do this nobody else nobody else was found worthy to do this but when he did they could not turn it down i thought he was telling a story about how this man helped him get the tabernacle he was and if you stay on earth that's all you'll get but if you will allow him to be lifted up before you you will be drawn to him and you will see what is he really saying to a spiritual people it's not that he's not really saying this about the tabernacle he really is but that is not what we're after what we're after is we want the seal loosed we want the seal loose and he's loosing it let's not just think he's telling us stories heavenly representation this roman catholic went to the front for him stood like nobody else could do and when he did they could not turn him down skips down to verse i'm sorry paragraph 46. just a few paragraphs after that a boy that is catholic a real royal friend of mine was talking to me remember those are those key phrases we're looking for when we're reading those seals whenever he says now the other day i was just the other day i was talking to sojo there it is saints go back and read your seals book it's there every time he's getting ready to loose the seal was talking to me he had a certain hardware store before i left he said billy i know you don't believe in our system of religion he said but i'm telling you right now god has honored your prayers so much for us i believe that if you get in trouble has anybody been in trouble anywhere in the nation said every catholic in the country would come to you have you ever been in trouble that you needed somebody to come to you spiritually speaking saints we know those things happen natural but spiritually speaking have we ever been in a condition of trouble that we needed somebody to come to our rescue we needed some type of assistance from another dimension we needed some type of heavenly representation we needed somebody to come and go to the front for us like nobody else can do and not be turned down paragraph 134 i read the other day you did that's interesting what did you read brother branham tell me another story i would have loved to have been sitting there with the understanding that we have now because when he would have said this i would have probably laughed and i would probably say no you're not going to fool me i know what you're getting ready to do and he would have enjoyed it i know he would have enjoyed it i read the other day the letter that mary herself wrote to polycarp remember saints let me back up for a second remember he's in the fifth seal he's talking about jews under the altar what does this and what i just wrote read to you have to do with jews under the altar seals are to gentiles trumpets are to jews seals are to gentiles even if it looks like it's to jews because what the seal is is a spiritual principle and if god wants to use jews to unlock a spiritual principle and a seal to his gentile bride he can do that and if he wants to use a trumpet that looks like it's to a gentile to loose it to bring christ to the jews he can do that as well brother branham said seals are to gentiles trumpets are to jews it doesn't matter if we think it looks opposite brother branham said seals are to gentiles trumpets are to jews and if we allow that to be true whenever we pick up this fifth seal we'll no longer say oh saul is under the altar what's the sixth seal about no we'll say oh fifth seal sun souls under the altar what is the spiritual principle of that to me a gentile that's the question to ask i was reading the other day the letter mary herself wrote to polycarp commending him for being a gallup man that who could teach and accept the teaching of jesus christ of who was born of her from god polycarp was burned and on his road coming down he was walking with his head down and the roman centurion said you're an old man and well respected why don't you denounce that thing he just kept looking towards heaven and a voice spoke from somewhere they couldn't understand where and said polycarp don't fear i am with you why is he telling this story while he's preaching the fifth seal polycarp is coming down to be burned at the stake and there is a voice from heaven that comes and says polycarp do not fear i am with you well if he's with me what do i have to fear it's the spiritual principle under the seal that's being loose to us polycarp is on his way down to be burned at the stake this is a natural event this is going to take place on earth you tell me one thing on earth that could have gave him comfort nothing why didn't the scripture say or why didn't it say that the voice spoke to him from earth it's not an earthly voice we're looking for saints an earthly voice won't help us an earthly voice won't help us unless it's backed by heaven but if it's spoken heaven first an earthly voice is just a microphone that picks it up and gives it to us it'll do us a lot of good a voice spoke from heaven and said polycarp don't fear i am with you don't leave that at polycarp saints we all have earthly problems we all were going to have problems that there will be no earthly answer to if you haven't had them yet you will have them if you aren't having them right now you will have them i assure you of that each and every one of us are going to face earthly real problems they're not going to be made up they are going to be real you are going to cry yourself to sleep at night you are going to worry about it throughout the day it is going to be real and it is going to be earthly it is going to be natural and it is going to be tangible some of those you may be able to fix yourself but i assure you each and every one of us will have at least one that we can't fix because we're the gentile broad and as christ displayed all the seals we have to display all the seals and we are going to be put in that position to where we have to have heavenly assistance we have to have a heavenly representation come and help us with that problem like nobody else can we can look at that in the broad spiritual application and that's true we know that's true christ came he died on a cross for us he came from heaven he died on a cross from us for us he paid our price and he went back to glory we know that's in a broad sense but it's going to be precise in your life it is going to be specific to you your brother and your sister will not be able to help you with that one because this fifth seal god is going to make sure you have a revelation of this fifth seal god is going to make sure you have a revelation that you personally have heavenly representation he will make sure that paragraph 319 in the fifth seal brother branham says five if you know your numerals of the bible five is the number of laboring grace we knew it was the number of grace but he puts a definition here laboring grace and that's what he has done now watch you want to know where it is nah now i'm hungry he's preaching the fifth seal he says what's your numbers five is the number of labor and grace do you want to know where it is yes brother branham i most certainly do want to know where it is where is the revelation of this seal was jesus a labor of love i'm sorry was jesus a labor of grace j e s u s five l a b o r five is that right labor for love for you and if you get to him how do you come by what f a i t h n l a b o r faith in labor is that right labor is the number of grace that's what he said he didn't say five is the number of grace he said labor is the number of grace all right to the believer faith in what he has done through his labor it is the foundational cornerstone of any true walk with christ if you cannot have faith perfect faith in what in the simplicity of the gospel just christianity 101 if you could not have perfect faith in what he labored to do for you and paid that penalty in full regardless of anything you have done or will do you will never walk with christ it is impossible brother random just said so he says if you come to him how will you come faith in labor you have to have a perfect revelation of that remember he also says in the church age book if you if you accept that you also accept the fact that you are his righteousness he says to reject one is to reject the other see that's how you can check your revelation if you really have a true perfect faith in what he's done for you is if you can look yourself in the mirror and say i have perfect faith that i am the very righteousness of god because if there's a hiccup in that you need to go back and check your first revelation and faith in what he did because you don't have it yet if you do not brother branham said so and i'm not making that up it's in the church age book he says if you accept one you have to accept the other if you reject one you have to reject the other they are intertwined you cannot have one without the other that's how you can check your revelation and it's not that we're not going to slip up and mess up and make mistakes brother branham says you will even willfully sin i'm not going to try to preach on that because i don't have a clue how that works but he says you will even willfully sin but a perfect revelation of of perfect faith in the labor that christ displayed will fix that problem it will fix it every time faith in labor comes down to paragraph 345 he says now my time's exactly up if i let out a little little early but i got a few more little things to say if you can stand it okay if you have to it's it's just comical saints thank god for a revelation i mean no doubt there were people sitting in this meeting that couldn't stand it i mean seriously there had to have been people you know they had their supper cooking they had friends coming over they had plans they had a long trip back home whatever the situation was no doubt there was somebody sitting there that couldn't stand anymore but we can look at this now and we're like i got you i got you i know what you're fixing to do right here i've got a few more little things to say here if you can stand it i know it's hot and i'm sweating but listen i just got something to tell you it's just so good it's just burning right in my heart i hope you haven't forgotten it let me say this in the presence of him oh my oh my by his grace what's the fifth seal by his grace he also let me see my people now remember he just spent hours talking about souls under the altar the jews under the altar but then he comes to the closing says i've got a few more little things to tell you if you can stand it i hope you haven't forgotten it by his grace he also let me see my people oh he did tell me more not long ago in white robes what were those souls under the altar given wonder if that's a coincidence i am not going to go start preaching on robes because we will be here for six hours you study that yourself praise god i'll preach on it some other time if our pastor don't you remember it you remember the story not long ago the gentile bride they're there now okay this is not a wishy-washy statement saints this is an emphatic direct statement they're there now what did he just reference before that the gentile bride i'm not going to put you in or are you out you put yourself in or out i'm going to put myself in there though you say well i don't know how that works i haven't died yet quit worrying about how it works it's a paradox but he's vindicated and me and you aren't yet they're there now paragraph 390 and so he said he's referring back to this translation he calls it a vision a couple times and he says no i don't want to call it a vision but i don't want to say translation because people will think i'm making myself like paul he's he's referring back to this situation i'll say it that way he says and the people said you he said i want to see jesus if i'm here i want to see jesus he says you can't see him now he's still higher see it was below the altar oh that's where the jews were at and that's where you saw the gentile bride maybe this fifth seal is not just about jews under the altar but this is just a little thing he has to tell us if we can stand it it's not really that important so don't get excited praise the lord i'm already do back flips they're below the altar yet i'm going to preach now praise the lord the sixth place where man goes not the seventh where god is seventh dimension they're in the sixth and they were all there and they was passing by and i said looked like there were actually millions of them what a group what a crowd and his earthly ministry hasn't even ended yet but yet he's already got millions of his people over there that's interesting his people are these branhams no these aren't branhams these are your converts these are your people now the scripture he that accepts a prophet in the name of a prophet receives a prophet's reward takes on a whole new light what was brother branham's reward remember the the prophecy interpretation through danny henry a huge portion of heaven awaits thee brethren says well it's not sectioned off like i owned this much and i'm this much heaven consists of the word and what are the believers the words on the page the words in the book the loose words in the book the spiritual principles under the seals which in is the entire bible which is the last angel's message see i'm not ashamed to say that i am william branham brother william branham's people and if you're ashamed of that i got real serious questions he that will receive a prophet in the name of a prophet it doesn't say to receive a prophet in the name of god it says he that will receive a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward i am not ashamed to be identified with him i am not a sh i'm not a brand of might but i'm not ashamed to be called a brand of knight i am a christian but if you want to call me a branhamite and you want to call me whatever word it is that associates me with him i praise god that just puts me in this vision this translation it puts me in this dimension [Applause] i'm not ashamed of that dimension and anything that it entails paragraph 411 oh this is wonderful see we're right under the altar that's almost like he's saying present tense we're right under the altar see that see where were we at when christ was here on earth where did the spear go it went right under the altar for what purpose to loose the bride why would we have a problem wrapping our minds that we're right under the altar we were right under the altar before the the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world where do you think we were then i'm to say maybe under the altar where were we when he was here literally in a physical body he proved it by running that fifth that fifth wound up into his side it showed where we were at the book of revelation that was praised god the book of revelation that was given to john was to do what three things show what has been what is and what will come why can we always believe what is i'm sorry what has been no problems with what has been when we start getting to what is and what will be oh boy better be careful no saints if you have a revelation of what has been you have no fear of what is and what will be i was in the same place before the foundation of the world that i was when he was here on earth and i am now in the sa in the position that i will be same place my my and your position never changes it is right under the heart of god [Applause] amen you tell me how that mistake i'll say it real harshly you tell me how that willful sin that you did two weeks ago is going to change that pattern [Applause] you're trying to tell me that your hybrid human willful carnal self can somehow disrupt the entire mind of god your position is sure your pos my position is sure there is nothing we can do to change that position you say well what about that scripture in hebrews where it says if you willfully sin you bypass and there's no more brother bran says that don't even apply to a believer oh praise god if you want to put yourself in that chapter you go ahead i'm not putting myself in that chapter our position will not change god made sure it wouldn't change to the fact that he would send a prophet and say that portion of scripture does not apply to my bride because it's impossible for them to get there praise god for that i hope you're starting to see how the fifth seal was not just some jews that was killed by eichmann stalin mussolini and hitler under this altar wanting vengeance for their brothers what principle did it lose to us it loosed us that there's living people in that dimension and the same dimension that john saw those people in is the same dimension that brother branham saw me and you in study the message study the message tell me if i'm out in left field you tell me i'm open to that it's it's not just in the message it's through the scripture saints to the point that that there had to be four soldiers lift him into the heavens before they could display the fifth seal it's so precise it's shocking 411 see we're right under the altar see that was it we're right under the altar he's not stuttering he says it twice we're right under the altar waiting for the coming when he when go get the body sleeping in the dust to raise us again again i'm not going to get into the whole body's side channel i'm going to try not to get into the whole body's side channel of this because we just don't have time for that what i want you to catch is the principle under this fifth seal of heavenly representation it's not a frivolous representation saints that representation is more real than me and you sitting and standing here today that representation is the whole reason you're able to sit there and me stand here today it is more real than what's happening right now it's not just a thought it's not just a myth it's not just uh i hope that's right or that's exciting i wish it's that way no saints that is the reality this is the vapor paragraph 4 32. i'm going to have you stand up with me i'm nowhere near done but i want to get your blood circulating again while we read this and then i'll have you sit down 4 32 it says i just thought it would be a good place to inject that just before closing see if john looked over there and then was his brethren see his brethren that he had that had to suffer a little then see the lord permitted to see my brethren and the saints that were waiting for the coming of the lord are you his brother are you waiting for the coming of the lord in the physical corporal body in the seventh dimension we know we've seen the spiritual coming he's speaking here of the seventh dimension wait they're under the altar waiting to go in the sixth dimension waiting to go to the seventh waiting for the corporal body and the saints that were waiting for the coming of the lord notice they were not under the altar of sacrifice mine wasn't but speaking of the jews but these was speaking of the jews they were martyrs see mine wasn't under the martyr's altar now i want you to listen real close the praise of the lord the ones that the lord showed me the bride she was not under the martyr's block no the sacrifice altar of the martyrs but had received white robes by accepting the pardoning grace of the living word christ had given them a white robe you can sit down if you're able to the jews in the sixth dimension were given what white robes when when were they given white robes they did not come back to an earthly dimension to receive those white robes he says he gave them to them then but he says mine wasn't under that martyr's block mine had already received white robes by receiving praise god the living word for their day you tell me how secure your position is he says i have glorified him and i'll glorify him again if he did it at the first he has to do it at the second if he's glorified the bride once he will glorify the bride again he says mine were not under the martyr's block mine already had white robes they had already received the living word for their day so now we have the key to why those jews under the altar were given white robes while they were in the sixth dimension they received the revelation of jesus christ i'll prove it to you here in a second see how powerful the revelation of jesus christ is saints it surpasses dimensions i can't i'm not even going to try to preach on that i've got no way to understand that that's just astonishing they had already been martyred under the holocaust now these were not all the jews brothers says these were not all the jews he says these were the true jews the true in heart that kept the law just as much as they could keep it so it's not everybody that was martyred under the holocaust it was the elect jews the true jews but he said they kept everything they could and they were truthfully blinded and they couldn't see see christ because he's the one that blinded them but they go to the sixth dimension and they receive a white robe in the sixth dimension the same as we their robe that john saw is let me say it this way your robe that you have on now the white robe you have on now of the living word is just as real as those robes that they had on that john saw that's written in the scripture you tell me how real your representation is you tell me how powerful accepting the message of the hour is surpasses earthly thinking surpasses carnal thinking totally heavenly dimension even now we are seated with christ jesus in heavenly places not will be we are now praise god i do think rather by the opening of this this is the end of this quote i do think rather by the opening of this seal as i believe that it's open to us i did it with a good conscience with clear revelation before god not trying to just make it think because i always against organization never would belong to them but it's open to me now what did he just read right above that what did he just say right above that why would he make a comment the fifth seal is now open oh what did he just say right above that my group that received the living word is in the same position as those jews under the altar that received white robes heavenly representation by faith in a laboring grace paragraph 436 and i do think another thing by the opening of this fifth seal in this day straightens up a doctrine right here that i might speak of of soul sleeping now i realize that there's people in here that does believe that sea in the soul sleeping i think this disproves that they're not sleeping they are alive their bodies are sleeping but the soul not in the grave they're in the presence of god see under the altar you say oh okay now i can understand it because i'm kind of there but my body's here and when i die my bodies will go there brother brandon says i hugged these people i felt those people i spoke to those people you tell me how real that body is it's more real than the one you have right now it's imperative that we have faith in that because our intellects will not get us into that position we must have faith in what the prophet has told us we must have faith in the loosing of this seal we cannot allow it to be just some information about jews killed under the holy under the holocaust it's now under the altar we have to be a spiritual gentile people and let this seal be loose to us we have to have the courage to accept the challenge of the hour which is the message of the hour we have to get away from carnal traditional thinking of it's kind of like and it's maybe so no it is real it's more real than real and there's nothing you can do to change that there's no mistake there's no hybrid dna there's no family tree that can change that your faith in a perfect sacrifice in a perfect and don't leave that sacrifice two thousand years ago your faith in a perfect bleeding bloody word gives you a white robe now that is represented there in heaven it is true and it is real and we must have faith in that because carnal human intellectual faith will not change your atoms it will not happen we must have a have a faith that is only loose to us by the loosing of this seal he did not just loose this to us so that we could understand who the jews were under the altar he loosed it to us for rapturing faith we must accept that that's paragraph 4 36 he goes to paragraph 445 and he says notice the bible says if this earthly tabernacle of our dwelling be dissolved we have one all ready waiting you tell me how real already waiting is brother branham says it was just slightly above my bed i was there and i could look back and see the other but while he's there he talked to them he felt them his position was recognized he recognized them he even said some of them were ministers and i didn't recognize them at first because they had been turned back young but when i got when i got the revelation that they'd been turned back young i started to recognize them and some of them were the ministers that i knew i wonder if they were dead or alive i wonder if it matters it was real praise god i'm going to finish reading that quote notice the bible says if this earthly tabernacle of our dwelling be dissolved we have one already waiting direct quote emphatic statement that's where i seen those saints it is not optional to think it's a kind of like or a maybe so he said that is where i saw them he's vindicated he was laboring with the message thousands of his friends will leave him i'm going to have faith in his labor you say well what good does that do you it gets me a nice piece of clothing that's more real than this more real than this see i can tear this one i can ruin this one i can get spots in i can get wrinkles in it nothing that i have done or ever will do can change that garment amen that is his grace brother branham says we talk so much about mercy and grace he says they thought god's grace was like a parent and nothing would ever happen to their baby he says god's love and his grace to us is his election the fifth seal has everything to do with the election you cannot change election saints not even if you try you can't and i thankful is not even the word for that i can't put a word on that how can you put a word on god electing to love you and there's nothing you can do to change that it is unconditional the human mind i tell you if our human minds would ever really get a full comprehension of that we would blow this building apart that's why we have to have a body change saints because our body will not when we receive that revelation in its fullness we will not be able to handle it this hybrid condition cannot handle that revelation it has to change it has to and that's more real than we think of it saints you know as well as i do you sit in service after service after service and when the true inspired revealed word of god comes in its fullness to you and you accept it things start happening in your body you start sweating you start shaking your body cannot handle this revelation in this hybrid condition you tell me which is more real [Applause] it is so real and so powerful that for thousands of years of hybridization and carnality and sin that just a god have mercy a mortal man with faults and failures nothing good within him can pick up this spiritual principle a spiritual principle that fell off the tree of life and in his hybrid condition can give it to you in your hybrid condition and your atoms will start having a reaction and expressing itself in a physical way [Music] do not deny the reality of that that is the same reality that the evil one displays every day in walmart when they pierce themselves and tattoo themselves and cut themselves what is it it is that spirit in reality on their being bringing their body into subjection of that it has a physical effect on their body and there is nothing they can do to control it they can't help but cut themselves and pierce themselves and put ink on themselves they can't help it their body cannot help it you tell me which is more powerful that satanic false expression or the true expression of the word of the living god that same situation that we experience as the word is coming forth that is the same situation that we're going to be put in when our atoms change what is it it is stimulation by revelation it is oil and it is wine and it is real and it has a real effect even in a hybrid condition that's the truth praise lord i know you know that god have mercy on us paragraph 455 now or to settle it those souls now watch this under the altar of the breaking of this seal that had been slain in the time between the death of christ and the going up of the church the eichman group and all that them true jews with their names on the book if you'll watch my brother according to the scripture they could talk cry out speak here and had all five senses not sleeping in the grave unconscious they were very much awake and could talk and speak and hear anything else why is that important because of the quote we've read just before that he says the same dimension these were in my people were in i'm going to read this quote and try not to have a screaming fit halfway through it this is all the way back in 1953. questions and answers on genesis and bef and god before the world was ever formed chose you and i in him before the world was ever formed now the first man now he made the first man in his image and we are returning back to that image that's right to our first created image when god created me william branham i was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit i wasn't conscious of anything as far as i know of but i was there oh i don't believe you're getting it you know why he said that it's because the walls of the building didn't blow out because if they would have got what he was really saying they would have blew the walls of the building out but now just a minute jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and paul said here he chose us in him before the world began now there was some part of me ormond neville and the rest of you all here that's in christ jesus before the world ever begin and here's to my analysis of that i think that the people today that are possessed of this spirit or the spirit a part of these angelic beings spirits which rotated off of god that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven you say okay it was a part of me it was something that rotated off of god it's kind of like forget it saints just forget it there was some part of you and me that resisted the devil's lie in heaven and kicked him out [Applause] quit trying to put terminology on it or where i won't say quit trying to put terminology we should that revelation will come don't lose the principle just because our intellect cannot put terminology on it allow it to be true and allow it to be real this is all the way back in 1953 and his preaching never changed all the way to the fifth seal you say well we kind of did that we may maybe in a way okay i'm good with that because i'll say this whatever kind of that was or maybe it was or however it was it was real enough that it kicked the devil out of heaven you tell me how real that is and he didn't just kind of come out of heaven god himself said i see you falling like a star you tell me how real that was the scripture says jesus says those that i've justified i have also glorified that's right say well yeah he will he will he said those that i have justified i have already glorified when you can explain to me how that works i'll explain to you how this works should we be so worried about the mechanics that we leave the dynamics alone because we can't understand the mechanics and put it in a nice little box and explain it to somebody no we are a spiritual people who live on spiritual principles off of the tree of life whether i can explain that to you or somebody else or not it doesn't change the spiritual principle and the truth that lies therein allow it to be true saints be comfortable with saying there was some part of me there [Music] even if i don't have the terminal the revelation of the terminology to use in that there was some part of me there and if there was some part of me there that's in an eternal position so eventually some part of me has to go back there i worry about the terminology then if i need to i'm pretty sure i won't be concerned about it and i'm going to go one step farther i'm not so convinced that he won't give us that revelation shortly if we will allow the dynamics to be true why wouldn't he give us the mechanics see you tell me which which takes more faith a clearly mechanical approach to something that results in a dynamic or believing in the dynamics and having the mechanics follow which takes more faith what is the one thing the son of man is after why would he why would he not put us in a position to make us have faith and make it more difficult to have faith that's what he's after he wants to put us in a position that we have to have something revealed to us in our heart and speak it as true and believe it is true and allow him to manifest the mechanics later because we're a spiritual people not a natural people and he is after a spiritual bride praise the lord we've resisted the devil's lie praise god i'm only an hour and a half in praise the lord we've resisted the devil's lie in heaven do you know what that means brother branham said the same tale that he's telling now he didn't say it was elah he said it was lie he says the lie that he told the tale that he told he says the same lie that he told there is the same lie that he's telling now so if i was in a position that some part of me resisted the lie there what is the chances that i'm going to somehow not identify and resist the same lie now [Music] and i kicked him out there what are the chances i'm not going to kick him out here and what are the chances my mistakes and failures is going to disrupt that plan pretty slim i'm going to say one last question on that topic i love this quote like i could preach for days on this quote i love it if we resisted the devil's lie there in heaven and kicked satan out that sounds like a battle to me he said what happened in heaven spilled over and now takes place on earth in us so is this the first time or the second time you fought this battle revelation chapter 19 he comes with his army you reckon that's a different army or maybe the same army you say well i'd like one more witness okay there was this man and he was looking at these pile of bones and he says can these live he says thou knowest prophesy that sounds like a familiar commandment sounds like maybe in my position in revelation 10 8 through 11 prophesy and he says i began to prophesy and the bones came together but then some different skin from somewhere else from somebody else came on them and some different muscle from a different portion came oh no he said the bones came together and sinew formed on them and muscles formed on them and tissue formed on them and they stood and were a mighty marching army that was not a different army that was the same army that was laying there you say okay well so what so what get out of the chapter get out of the first four seals look how secure your position is saints he said you can go and be nothing more than a teaspoon of ashes and that will not hinder your position in christ those 16 elements will will be quickened those same 16 elements that went down will be quickened if they go down by way of the grave if we're not translated if we are translated it'll be those those same 16 elements that make you up right now will be translated naughty different same ones that's how secure your position is in and that's why your body reacts the way that it reacts when the preaching is going forth the whole earth groaneth for the manifestations of the sons of god he's not just talking about planet earth saints what is your and my body made of we are a spiritual people that the spiritual principles off of the tree of life have a natural reaction and effect on our bodies continuing in the fifth seal he says now but there is determined yet to the people speaking of the jews another three and a half years well during this time he's speaking from the end of the church ages to the three and a half years to the jews beginning well during this time why see what happens is the gentile bride is selected in the seven church ages and goes up he's still in the fifth seal saints he's talking about a gentile bride and the church ages going up and when it does that way all these jews that's martyred along here there because of blindness laying under the altar god comes over and says you see what it was now i give each one of you a robe when did they receive a robe after they saw what it was what was it he just told you in between this time the gentile church goes up up where i want to see jesus you can't see him now he's a bit higher saints when we're translated we do not go to the sixth dimension we see him as he is what does that do to the sixth dimension i'm not just making this up he says it it's just common if the gentile church which he says i already seen them there where in the sixth dimension and he says now in this time period they go up what does that do to the sixth dimension why do you think the jews were crying how long lord how long is now the time you think they just woke up one morning well they don't sleep there so they couldn't woke up you think that they just had an idea let's ask them how long no saints they saw something what they saw was the the sixth dimension emptied out of the gentile bride and they said oh how long lord how long is now the time and he says you see what it was now yes i give you a robe what did they see saints there's only one way to get a robe and that is to recognize the true atonement the living word [Music] you tell me what the bride is the bride's position is so powerful that when the jews recognize the revelation that laid within them he gives them a robe of righteousness they did not see christ on a cross 2000 years ago only the sixth dimension emptied out that's what caused them to ask the question and he come over and he says you see what it was now how did they see what it was because of his position in his bride you say that's far-fetched the scripture says he declares in heaven what he does before he declares it on earth then brother branham says this gentile men this gentile bride will take this same message and give it back to the jews he has to do it in heaven before he can do it in earth that's right allow it to be true saints you say i've never heard anything like that before neither have i praise the lord but you know what what i heard before has not changed my atoms so i'm going to keep looking for that city and i'm going to keep looking for that city and i'm going to keep probing and i'm going to keep looking and i'm not going to go out in left field i'm allowed to i'm going to allow it to be by revelation but when it's revelation i'm going to say it whether somebody said it before or not i don't care i know it's true it's in my heart that's why i say i know that if i could just say it the way it's in my heart it would be true and perfect because that's what revelation is you tell me if your heart tells you it's true or not allow your heart to tell you don't trust my words allow your heart to tell you and if your heart tells you that don't worry about the mechanics allow him to fill in the mechanics [Music] it's true saints the reason they were asking that question wasn't for a frivolous reason they saw something there was a reason they started asking that question why brother branham told us why he says because my people are in the same dimension as those people i've already saw them there and the gentile bride goes up and they ask is now the time lord is now the time oh you finally saw what it was that's powerful saints it's powerful see if we ever really catch a revelation of this the bobbed hair and the makeup and the shorts and the tv and the carnality just goes away look at the position he has gave us and look at what is hinging on it this is so much more than your trials and tribulations while you're alone by yourself look is what is look what is hinging on this the robes of the jews see if we can get off of earth out of carnality recognize our spiritual position the things of the world fade away and take care of themselves as i've said before there will come a day that we will not have to preach sanctification from the pulpit the bride is going to catch a revelation they do not need that and i'll say one more thing just because it's not preached from the pulpit doesn't mean you're still not going to be held accountable just because something's not still preached doesn't mean that god's overlooking it it just maybe he's done dealing with that and you best be moving on or you're going to end up on the pale horse you allow that to speak to your heart god is serious about this position the bride holds and he's going to make sure that we fulfill that position it's laid before the foundation of the world it's laid when christ was here at his first crucifixion it was laid when the prophet revealed the seals and then brother brown says he'll take that same thing that he revealed himself in before and reveal himself again do you think those thunder stopped whenever they sounded what is the thunders it's the voice of god where did he say the voice of god was look at our position saints look how secure it is what are the chances out of the billions of people that are on the face of the earth this morning that we are privileged to set and hear these things not because i'm speaking it god knows that i'm you understand what i'm saying i'm just saying what he said but i thank god for a revelation that i'm not a parrot and that i can speak by inspiration about what he said look at our position i've got to move on he says he comes over and he says you see what it was now i give each one of you a robe they said how long lord are we going in now why would they ask if they were going in now nuff said no no no no your fellow man the jews has got to suffer a little bit yet they got to be martyred like you was martyred the beast has got to get them when he breaks his covenant see gentiles as individuals jews are together even in that dimension it doesn't change even in that dimension this same word of god applies the jews are saved together feast of trumpets paragraph 253 notice speaking of the jews they'll know their messiah when they see him he is coming in power this time the one they looked for he is coming in power for the gentile bride and the jews are going to recognize him [Applause] that's funny it's kind of like what happened in the 6th dimension it's exactly like what happened in the sixth dimension you just keep walking in the light the mechanics will manifest that don't try to make it be something you just keep walking in the light it'll manifest itself and the jews are going to recognize him that must mean him hmm that's male hmm that's not what they saw in the 6th dimension or was it or was it thank god for a prophet she is him and then the bible says when they say where did you get those wounds he said in the house of my friends i wonder this is just me i wonder in the sixth dimension when the bride goes up and the jews see them go up and they recognize who they are and they have to because he comes over and says you see what it was now and they say yes and they were given rose i wonder if that gentile broad has scars and i wonder if they ask the same question and i wonder if the response is the same maybe that explains why i came and preached a message called indictment see the first crucifixion had scars there's no way to avoid scars at the second crucifixion you say oh brother brandon manifested that yep he sure did brother branham's not here anymore what's going to be slain now where the star where are the scars going to be implemented now you tell me who hurts you the most the stranger at walmart or your friends and your family the ones that's walked with you for years and then denounce the very essence of this message i wonder if those jews see some scars on that gentile bride i wonder if they say where did you get those let's say within the ranks of the message patterns laid saints we're not going to avoid it better get used to it who else can give you scars you tell me that the stranger at walmart is he may hurt your feelings you may be embarrassed he's not going to scar you you're going to forget about it in a couple weeks the house of your friends 65 trying to do god a service without it being god's will you see a tree struggling to live and that means there's a tree that don't die you see a man struggling for life it shows that there's a tabernacle waiting somewhere that don't die if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting the good heavenly father permitted me to walk behind that curtain one day and see it this is in trying to do god a service without it being god's will why is he talking about the fifth seal you recognize that as the fifth seal praise the lord this isn't trying to do god a service without his will in 1965 at the end of his ministry and he's going back to this same translation when he talks about we already have one there prepared a body already prepared he goes back to the exact same thing do you think that's coincidence not a chance father permitted me to walk behind that curtain one day and see it how many heard looking past the curtain of time there it was just the same as i'm preaching to you all there they stood souls under the altar crying how long go back and look at that translation you will find nowhere in there their soul saying how long maybe he's trying to tie something together maybe let's get off of the earth into heaven and see it there's nowhere in the recount of that translation that there's anyone anybody saying how long lord how long but yet when he comes to the end of his ministry in 1965 trying to do god a service without it meaning god's will and he starts recounting this he says father father allowed me to see that and that's where they were those souls crying how long how long not just a myth somebody who had intelligence how long lord see they were real saints that's what he's trying to get us to see and they were there in that dimension 1965 god's only provided place of worship you who trust me to tell you the truth the dear lord jesus one morning about eight o'clock let me see that land now it wasn't a vision this is at the end of his ministry he's not mincing words now it wasn't a vision but i don't want to say that okay ever what it was it was just as real as i'm speaking to you here now i seen the faces of those people and i couldn't recognize them they had turned back young again and they were just real i'd hold their hands and things just as real i think he's trying to tell us something and it helped me because i used to have an idea when a person died just their soul went off but when but then when he quoted that to me that if this earthly tabernacle of our habitation be dissolved we have one already waiting that wasn't even a scripture the prophet put to it he said he quoted that to me you tell me how real that is see and we've got to have everything in threes to make a perfection see and there's one body here then there's that body there which is the celestial body and then the glorified body in the resurrection i'm not going to get into that i promised i wouldn't see that makes it complete see it's not a myth not an idea it's not a spirit it is man and woman like you are just exactly in heaven or this place wherever it was i don't know what to call it he referred to it there as souls under the altar [Music] so you just thought i was making that up the whole time the one that was speaking to brother branham brother branham says he referred to that place as souls under the altar and that's where me and you were at and that's where he saw us and he said it's real it's real and then he said it again it's real what's the spiritual principle under the fifth seal heavenly representation laboring grace while i could feel them i'm going to skip this one because we've already got that point and i looked at all the women looked like millions of them there and they all had long hair and white garments down and this one that was talking to me said don't you recognize her i said no said she was in her 90s when you led her to christ he starts singing amazing grace how sweet the sound what seal do you think he's talking about see just no way of ever explaining what it is just take my word if you believe me well i'm one of your people so i'll just believe be sure to burn every bridge of the world behind you 65 things that are to be i said well if i've passed over i want to see jesus i'm going to skip that one because we've laid that down he just makes reference again that even in 1960 i'll just read it well i've passed over i want to see jesus said you can't see him now this is the scripture said souls under the altar 1965 end of his ministry he goes back and says that fifth seal that translation that i had this is that scripture see there's there's no wiggle room now he gives a description he places it in the scripture souls under the altar he's just a little higher someday he will return we're going to go back to earth we don't eat or drink here 1965 it is the rising of the sun and one day you all know some of you know this quote i know you do you just contain yourself and one day when i was weary myself i said boy you'd better go ahead and do something you're 50 years old if you're going to do anything for the lord you better hurry up and do it you're getting old see and there that morning the quickening power come and he let me look over the curtain and i seen all of you over there no wonder everything in heaven and beneath the heavens and in earth and beneath the earth and in the scene everything heard john screaming [Music] if that doesn't do something for you i've got nothing else to offer zero let's get some collaring books and some coffee and talk about a man on a cross 2000 years ago if that doesn't do something to your soul i've got nothing else to offer you is at the end of his ministry he's just laid out the spiritual principle is what was underneath that fifth seal and he says that's where i went and i saw all of you over there saints he was not preaching to a bunch of dead people these were still alive during his earthly ministry and he said i've seen you all there praise the lord what else can you say thank you jesus what else can he say is it sure saints are you seeing it it's not intellectual i'm not making this up this is real it's in the scripture it's in the message it's so true and accurate that was jesus christ was here displaying it in his earthly ministry he had to act out each one of those and they had to be precise but yet we come and that low to see in spirit tries to creep over us and we start trying to make it a kind of like or a maybe no it is real and there's nothing you can do to change nothing i can do to change it and i say thank god i cannot mess this up [Applause] he said that second eve is not like the first she will not fall that's wonderful and it's glorious but look at why she won't fall he said because she's predestinated not to fall if we could mess this up we would mess it up but i thank god we can't mess it up that's the spiritual principle under the fifth seal don't ever look at it as jews under the altar again don't ever just look at it as jews under the altar again praise the lord oh my [Music] we're still in a time moment cursed would be time i'm going to stop i wanted to get into the second crucifixion of the bride but if i do we're it's just going to be really long let's musicians come let me read this and we'll close we'll get to the other some other time god willing i can give you the principle and the principle is what happened at the first crucifixion will happen at the second crucifixion and the reason they preached indictment is because there was a second crucifixion and that second crucifixion didn't end brother branham that second crucifixion is in me and you and that's why he would come and he would start quoting scriptures like she is smitten she is afflicted no you can't do that brother brandon the scripture says he was he was afflicted he wasn't stuttering and he wasn't making up words she's smitten smitten from the denominations don't leave that in the denomination a world put that in your own mind she is smitten from our own carnal thinking she is smitten from just thinking it was jews under the altar she is afflicted of god see remember what i told you before the fifth seal always comes into full manifestation after a crucifixion who do you think it is extending mercy and grace to this world right now and if this if this fifth seal if we're if we're displaying grace to this world laboring grace it's not just grace it's laboring grace see the book was oh lord have mercy the book was sweet in the mouth and bitter in the belly it was great what did the headstone cry when it came grace grace w i w i can't spell forgive me w h i t e s-t-o-n-e grace grace why isn't one grace good enough because under that fifth seal when the headstone came with this revelation there was grace extended to the jews and there was grace extended to the gentiles same headstone no different grace grace from a white stone if i be lifted up from the earth is he still drawing men to him then where is he being lifted up at because the only way to draw men is for him to be lifted up from the earth you say i want to win a soul to christ do you do you really because he says the only way to do that is if i be lifted up from the earth you see oh that's when he was glorified it was look at the definition that he put to glorification if a corn of wheat fall under the ground and die if a man forsake his life totally opposite than what we think but if we're in one position that automatically puts us in the other position out of your belly will flow living waters oh that's wonderful praise god hallelujah what do you have to do to get living waters to come out of your belly you have to have a spear thrust into your side right into your heart and allow water and blood to come out and that's real saints and that works how are each and every one of you sitting here how did you get here how did i get here it was faith in somebody else's laboring grace somebody labored and brought you this message you say oh it's just my dad you know he was racist no no no saints maybe it was but it just wasn't that there was a labor of grace that took place for you to hear these words the prophet labored to bring us this message and it didn't end there that laboring came forth in the people that were on earth at that time that believed that message they may not have understood everything but that's okay they believed what they could and they labored in that through grace and they gave it to the next generation and that next generation picked it up and they labored in grace clueless until this time that they were manifesting the revelation of the fifth seal but now we're privileged to look back and see it why that's the question why why is it important that we see it now i'll tell you why praise the lord i get i really wanted to preach on this but here's a good opportunity i'll tell you why because a month ago you can go to the news and find it yourself a month ago the first privately built spacecraft was sent into orbit with no public show because the coronavirus [Music] that's a coincidence is it it was a blip on the radar saints because there was the whole coven 19 thing and then there was all the riots on the earth and just in the middle of all this spacex a private company not a government property a private a private show no public show they usually have tens of thousands of people with those launches not a one i won't say not a one there may have been a few there but it wasn't like it used to be it wasn't like it usually is there was no big public show i'm not going to make any more out of that than what it is i'm just going to that's what the news said i'm just saying what the news said you if you make it something else that's your fault i mean if you think that has to do with something in a little room that's your problem not mine praise the lord that's why it's imperative that now we catch this revelation that's under the fifth seal that's why it's imperative that we understand the grace that was released to us please start playing something or i'm going to preach all day that was released to us it is so imperative that we are secure in our position because our atoms are not going to change saints if we are not perfectly sure in our position we have to be and the only way that we will be perfectly secure in our position is if we recognize the spiritual principle under that fifth seal that was loose to us and that principle was grace grace heavenly representation demonstrated in laboring grace you allow your heart to tell you if it's true you allow your heart to tell you it's true [Music] i'll ask you this question have you ever received scars in the house of your friends were they real scars [Music] were they real scars or were they in your spirit see they're not going to thank god our lot is not the physical crucifixion we're a spiritual people so i just want to say that to bolster your faith saints if they're crucifying you on a spiritual level that must mean there's something there to crucify and by default by default that establishes your position so even if you can't bolster enough faith to say yes that's me i'm praise god i'm in that position allow the negative to bolster your faith allow the negative to bolster your faith because i know one thing the white horse rider didn't have no scars and the red horse didn't and the black horse didn't and the power horse didn't so i can't identify there but i come to the fifth ceiling and i'm not i'm not identified in the sixth seal just causing trials and tribulation everybody but i can identify somewhere in that fifth seal i am and i can identify what that means in regards to the seventh seal see it's by default if you can't bolster enough faith just to proclaim it do it by default because i'm pretty sure none of you want to walk out of here saying yep i am clearly in those first four i don't think any of you want to say that so by default just say the other and keep saying it and keep saying it until you believe it or we can just say i'm one of his people i'm just going to take his word for it i'm just going to believe what he has said about me and i'm going to believe what was loosed to me praise the lord a lot more can be said i want to stop there because i don't want you to walk out of here confused about the point that i was trying to make do you get the point i was trying to make do you understand your position do you have faith in that position against all odds have faith in your position because that position has a heavenly representation and it doesn't matter how much or what you do to change that you can not it's already there before the foundation of the world it was demonstrated when christ was here on earth in his corporal body and it's demonstrated again as this message came forth confirmed multiple times let's not go away doubting as brother branham said it would be a sin for us not to believe at this point let's not be sinful as we stand together let's be believers let's be believers let's just allow it to be true i had you stand up so that means i get to preach for a while longer right just couldn't i thank you for your time i thank you for your patience i believe you've caught the point that's to be made and i don't say that of myself it's imperative that we understand this saints brother branham says the book was tied together from genesis to revelation by those seven seals and those seven seals were the end of time message those seven seals were to us don't leave the fifth one to the jews understand why that fifth seal applies to us praise the lord god bless you brother please sing sing the original life god's attributes were manifested to his bride in this last age we have caught the revelation by the last prophet's message and we know who we are and what we're raised up for praise the lord [Applause] today it's what the scriptures [Applause] inspired by our god the son of man is [Applause] and we have responded to our god [Applause] is praise god praise the lord amen is your position secure you know when brother branham there at the end of his ministry he looked out that crowd of people and he said and i saw all of you over there do you know there would be people in that crowd who would disbelieve right was he saying every individual in that building was guaranteed to be in the fifth dimension under grace i don't believe that's what he was saying who was his audience and who was he preaching to he was preaching to the bride and if there happened to be somebody in that building who wasn't part of the bride that's not who he was addressing [Music] after the opening of the seals brother venom quit amen trying to preach two different messages and evangelistic to this way when he come back home just preached something a little deeper he finally got to the point where he was just preaching the seventh seal mystery just preaching bride food wherever he went and he was preaching bright fruit and the bride would catch it the sheep would catch it and he'd go over the heads of everybody else and he got to the point he didn't care anymore and he can come and make a statement like that and i've seen all of you over there who is he talking to the bride so when i listen to the tape and he says i've seen all of you over there who's his audience he saw me over there i believe with all my heart he saw me over there amen what's the mechanics of it like brother ben said i'm not going to try to explain it but i just believe it that there's a representation over there of something that represents me in the heavenly dimension it's before in god part of god returning back to god we can use all kinds of english words to mess it up we can try to explain it till we explain it away we can try to categorize it and put it in timelines but this is an eternal revelation forget the timelines first it'll be like this and then it'll be like that it's always been in the mind of god the same thing god his attributes his family [Music] do you believe you're part of that amen then you have representation in heaven then you're sealed then you're under the fifth seal and the loosing of the fifth seal brought a revelation of your eternal position and now i'm secure if i get sick it doesn't change that if i lose everything it doesn't change that and my family falls apart it doesn't change that if my church falls apart it doesn't change that nothing's going to change that that's a revelation that we needed under the seals so that we can move with confidence the way god wants us to move brother man what did he say he he's trying to take the scare away all this fear and scare that the denominational ages created all this fear and scare you better get it right or you'll be lost if you make a mistake and be lost you better come to the church you'll be lost you better listen to the preacher you'll be lost what's the seals trying to do what's the revelation they are trying to do take all the scare away amen there's nothing for me to be scared of there's nothing to be afraid of amen my position is secure in him amen i've come from him i go back to him whatever he is i am amen she is him praise god how much how much of you the flesh i don't care how much one spec's enough for me one dot one drop one how do you measure it how do you put it in the portion how do you divide it up i don't know how to divide up i don't know how to separate it i'm not interested in separating it three parts one part i'm part of him that's enough for me amen however he wants to manifest it in whatever way and through whatever terms it doesn't matter i'm part of him period i'm secure i'll go back to him i love him do you love him man let's just bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you god for the revelation that you gave us lord when you when you sent that prophet to us according to your word that was you lord we can look and see a man but that's just the vessel you chose it was you who was losing the seals it was you who was bringing the revelation to us and god now it's not us it's not the man behind the pulpit or the people in the seat it's not the clay it's you on the inside lord it's not us that's persecuted as a human being they love us people like us it's not the flesh it's not us it's it's the word that is inside of us lord we're not rejected you're rejected and because we're identified with you it just passes right on we feel it because you're abiding within it's your presence with your bride god and it's not the mistakes it's not the wrong thoughts it's not the ill-tempered words that's not what it's all about it's about that life on the inside god give us more lord more understanding of your grace so that we can quit looking to the outside and look to the inside for the revelation of this truth it will solve all problems lift us up in a higher plane as your people lord give us a different eyesight than natural eyesight a different understanding than natural understanding that we might see the reality of these things and we might perceive the real truth of this reality lord and may it change our walk may it change our talk may it change our everyday actions lord not change lord by force not changed by governments not changed by rules lord but changed by revelation may you have preeminence by revelation god may you have your position your place because you've come and revealed to us so that you so that we can yield to you and that you can have your way forgive us lord for our blindness lord but now as you shine the light lord let us come to the light and walk in the light god we love you we ask you to take us from here to higher places to higher realms as we physically walk out of the building let us not leave the position you placed us in well let's not leave that heavenly realm no matter where we go or what we do let us never lord in our revelation leave our position let us walk on this earth as you would walk lord doing what you would have us to do we surrender to you lord we ask you to have preeminence bless our brother ben lord for his sacrifice and his labor god as we fed lord from what you've done through him we just pray that you restore to him strength and energy lord and revelation and blessing for god we desire to walk a walk of faith by revelation not not just mechanical what we can see and feel and touch but what we can receive by faith let that be the greater reality lord god take us use us mold us and make us lord what you've always predestined for us to be help us lord to get with the program so your program can continue to move forward more quickly we love you god and ask for your blessings over all said and done in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you saints i tell you i've been praying a prayer for me personally that prayer is that god will let me preach by revelation and it it's risky seemingly it's seemingly risky to the human mind because if you're going to preach by revelation you're going to preach things that you can't always prove and you're going to preach things that you haven't always known and you're going to preach things that may not be easily understandable to the intellect but i want to get away from all of those things and i want to preach by revelation and god blessed our brother today to be able to preach by revelation amen because the denominations have been able to preach by intellect by schooling and by education but we want to do away with all of that and we want to preach and speak and testify by revelation because revelation is everything and then trust god amen to lead us by revelation it seems risky but it's the most solid foundation you can ever be on is beyond the solid foundation of revelation amen understanding is the tricky part understanding's the deceptive part this intellectual understanding that can all fade away and fall apart but revelation will last forever true revelation from god i said god let us be led let us preach let us speak let us testify let us read your word let us listen to tapes all by revelation let us forget all that we've ever known to know him praise be to god let's sing your songs oh i sing praises to your name o lord praises to your name for your name is for your name is great and greatly to be [Music] to praised name for your name is great and greatly to be praised glory to your name for your name is great and great [Applause] oh lord for your name is i give honor to your name r [Music] for your name is great and greatly to be praised is oh [Music] [Music] remember when moses had broke the tables of stone and he got two more told to cut two more out and he was going to go unto the mountain and god was going to ride on those stones it says god came down in a cloud and declared the name of the lord what is the name of the lord it's not being able to spell jesus christ or just say it amen but his names denotes his person who he is and he is the person of the word amen and he came down in a cloud in this generation amen so that he can declare his name who he is and that's the opening of the seals that's the message of the hour that is the seventh seal he has come himself to declare his name and when we bring honor to his name
