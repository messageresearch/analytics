[0:00] see the preaching of the seven seals
[0:03] had to go all the way back
[0:07] to what was in the mind of god but god
[0:10] had to send a surveyor
[0:12] [Music]
[0:12] [Applause]
[0:15] to let us know what i'm spot so yeah but
[0:18] you know what's so beautiful
[0:20] in the new development sometimes people
[0:25] move quick and they will have their
[0:27] house and a bunch of bushes
[0:29] come around and like nobody's going to
[0:30] move out there
[0:33] and they would decide ain't nobody
[0:35] moving there i could use a little extra
[0:36] room
[0:38] i'm going to go and put some stuff here
[0:40] put some stuff here they people do that
[0:43] but then all of a sudden they know that
[0:46] the land is being cleared off and they
[0:49] walk out what are you doing
[0:50] somebody's gonna move here they say
[0:53] um well you can't come here
[0:57] they say yeah that's what their land is
[0:59] no this is my land
[1:00] see they don't make claims but the
[1:03] record ain't going to show up that is
[1:05] there
[1:08] so what to do all he has to do
[1:11] say look i ain't even gonna argue with
[1:12] you i'll be back
[1:15] go back to the records get the plaque
[1:19] go out to that person see that little
[1:21] stick right there
[1:24] yeah so according to my transit
[1:28] and according to the record you moved it
[1:30] over four feet
[1:33] yes you did you moved it over i got the
[1:36] records
[1:38] could we say amen see that's what god
[1:40] were doing through the prophet
[1:43] then let you know you got gifts
[1:46] you got that but the word want to move
[1:48] you back here
[1:50] you don't want too far that's what
[1:52] you're doing with the pentecostals
[1:53] can we say amen positioning everything
[1:57] in the book of joshua jeremiah why when
[2:00] he bought that property
[2:02] they sealed everything up can we say
[2:05] amen
[2:05] put everything sealed it up so when they
[2:08] came out of babylon
[2:10] squatters don't get on their land but
[2:12] they got the evidence
[2:15] and they can prove this belongs to me
[2:19] can we say amen that's why god gave us
[2:21] the opening of the word
[2:23] so you'll know your boundaries you know
[2:26] what the devil don't supposed to be
[2:27] what the devil trying to be i don't give
[2:29] all of that to you
