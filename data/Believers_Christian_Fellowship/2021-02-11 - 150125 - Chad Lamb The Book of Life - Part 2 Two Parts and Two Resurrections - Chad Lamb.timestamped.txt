[0:00] amen let's just take our bibles and turn
[0:03] to revelations chapter 20.
[0:10] we're going to continue on in the book
[0:12] of life i had mentioned that you might
[0:14] want to bring your church age book today
[0:15] we're going to read several patches
[0:17] out of the church age book and
[0:20] take a look at this subject of the book
[0:22] of life revelations chapter 20
[0:26] and we will read at verse 11.
[0:32] revelations 2011 reads and i saw a great
[0:34] white throne in him that sat on it
[0:36] from whose face the earth and the heaven
[0:39] fled away
[0:40] and there was found no place for them
[0:42] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[0:44] before god and the books were open and
[0:45] another book was opened which is the
[0:47] book of life
[0:48] and the dead were judged out of those
[0:50] things which were written in the books
[0:51] according to their works
[0:53] and the sea gave up the dead which were
[0:54] in it and death and hell delivered up
[0:56] the dead which were in them and they
[0:58] were judged every man according to their
[1:00] works
[1:01] and death and hell were cast into the
[1:02] lake of fire this is the second death
[1:05] and whosoever was not found written in
[1:07] the book of life was cast into the lake
[1:09] of fire
[1:10] let's just pray their heavenly father as
[1:13] we turn our attention to your word we
[1:15] just ask lord that you would open the
[1:16] pages of this word
[1:18] lord it's not the ability to read or to
[1:20] comprehend or understand that we're
[1:21] looking for
[1:22] lord we're looking for something much
[1:24] greater than that we pray lord that you
[1:26] would give us a revelation of what your
[1:27] word is really telling us in this hour
[1:30] and god i pray that you would use these
[1:31] lips lord and use this vessel for your
[1:33] glory
[1:34] and give us all ears to hear and our
[1:35] heart to receive all the truth that you
[1:37] have for us
[1:38] we ask your blessings over this service
[1:40] in jesus christ's name
[1:41] amen you can all be seated
[1:45] now last time we talked about we started
[1:48] in the book of life
[1:49] we started with the sovereignty of god
[1:51] because we see in here there's a book
[1:54] called the book of life and at the white
[1:55] throne judgment all
[1:57] those whose names are on the book of
[1:59] life enter into eternal life but if your
[2:01] name is not found on the book of life
[2:03] then you're you go into the lake of fire
[2:06] so this is a really important book right
[2:10] i say this is the important book of all
[2:12] important books in all the bible
[2:14] because it determines eternal
[2:16] destination
[2:17] and so we wanted to find out if if this
[2:20] is an important book and whether my name
[2:21] is on there or not determines
[2:23] what my eternal destination is going to
[2:25] be then i must
[2:27] find out how to get my name on that book
[2:29] and last week we found out that you
[2:31] can't do anything to get your name on
[2:32] the book
[2:33] that if your name was ever on the book
[2:34] your name was put there on that book
[2:36] before the foundation of the world
[2:38] when the lamb and the mind of god was
[2:39] slain to redeem those who are on the
[2:41] book
[2:43] so nothing is being added to this book
[2:45] now there are names that can be removed
[2:47] from the book but we're going to talk
[2:48] about that next week
[2:50] this week we want to move from the
[2:51] sovereignty of god in the book of life
[2:53] and start talking about two parts and
[2:56] two resurrections
[2:58] because there's two parts to the book of
[2:59] life and for the gentiles there are two
[3:02] resurrections so we want to we want to
[3:03] look at those
[3:04] because those two parts have everything
[3:06] to do with the two resurrections
[3:09] all right just to back up for a minute i
[3:13] want to talk about the
[3:14] church age book because last time we
[3:16] talked about there there are some
[3:18] opinions about the church age book
[3:20] different ones have different opinions
[3:21] and feelings on it
[3:22] but really the opinion that matters most
[3:24] to me is brother banham's opinion of
[3:25] this book
[3:26] and so i read a couple quotes and i'll
[3:28] read a couple more
[3:30] the one that i had read last time was
[3:32] anointed ones at the end time in 1965.
[3:34] brother branham says now lee there comes
[3:36] your name on the book
[3:38] and see this is the subject that we're
[3:40] wanting to go into his name on the book
[3:42] and names taken off the book the book of
[3:43] life is the subject
[3:45] and brother branham's going to start
[3:46] talking about this subject
[3:49] he said you see you've got it fixed out
[3:50] and you that's not here and out in the
[3:52] hookups it's dr lee vale sitting here he
[3:54] is grammarizing this book of the seven
[3:56] church ages
[3:57] and the problem come up or the question
[3:59] about your name taken off the lamb's
[4:00] book of life
[4:01] see it's puzzled a lot of ministers but
[4:04] wait till you get the book
[4:05] which book this book but wait till you
[4:08] get the book you'll understand it if you
[4:10] just got any light
[4:12] in you see see that's brother branham's
[4:14] opinion of this book
[4:16] that is going to answer this question
[4:17] this question in particular is one that
[4:19] he said it's going to answer
[4:20] then in 1965 a man running from the
[4:22] presence of the lord
[4:23] he says and then the seven church ages
[4:26] has been finished is that right brother
[4:27] veil he's talking about the printing of
[4:29] the book
[4:30] and on print now and i know you'll want
[4:32] to get them
[4:33] because they answer a lot of questions
[4:35] that's been in your hearts
[4:37] all right that's what brother branham
[4:39] thought of this book
[4:41] and here's another one another brother
[4:42] in the church gave me after the service
[4:44] he emailed it to me
[4:45] i thought it was fantastic he said you
[4:47] all seen in my book it'll all be drawn
[4:49] out in the seven church ages
[4:51] so he's talking about the writing of
[4:52] this book you all see in this book
[4:54] and he said it will be all drawn out in
[4:56] the seven church ages
[4:58] which he told me which i stand by as a
[5:01] witness to god to be judged at the day
[5:02] of judgment for it
[5:04] it come from god not from my thinking
[5:07] all right that's pretty solid stance
[5:10] on this church age book so a lot of
[5:13] people may have opinions but this is the
[5:15] opinion that matters most to me
[5:17] and so i have no trouble learning from
[5:19] the
[5:20] church age book and what i told the
[5:25] the young people we had a youth meeting
[5:27] at the house friday we had a really nice
[5:29] time
[5:29] but i told him that this is what matters
[5:33] most to us the word of god
[5:36] but this came to shine light and
[5:38] highlight
[5:39] portions of the word of god that were
[5:41] laying there dormant to be exposed in
[5:43] this age
[5:44] to create in us a faith and
[5:45] understanding of faith that'll build a
[5:47] rapture
[5:48] so this is illuminating this
[5:52] this is the source the bible
[5:55] not this right and i told them a little
[5:58] a little analogy if you want to better
[6:00] absorb vitamin c then you need to eat
[6:02] vegetables with calcium in it
[6:04] like broccoli or whatever green
[6:05] vegetables with calcium and if you have
[6:07] calcium in your body
[6:08] you'll absorb vitamin c so what we want
[6:10] is vitamin c
[6:13] but to fully absorb vitamin c if we take
[6:15] a little broccoli with it
[6:17] amen get the calcium will fully absorb
[6:20] what's in the vitamin c and get the full
[6:21] benefit out of it
[6:23] amen all right
[6:27] now let's just go to our church age book
[6:28] and start with the two parts
[6:31] of the book of life we're going to go to
[6:33] page number 267 so if you've brought
[6:35] your book and want to turn
[6:37] to page 267
[6:40] we'll start at the first paragraph
[6:47] and he says here page 267 paragraph one
[6:50] to begin with there is no basis for the
[6:52] claim that the lamb's book of life is
[6:54] not the same
[6:55] as the book of life the book of life
[6:58] might be called the lamb's book of life
[6:59] or christ's book of life
[7:01] or even thy book and book of liv of the
[7:04] living
[7:04] only names are written in it see in
[7:07] revelation 13
[7:08] it says and all that dwell upon the
[7:09] earth shall worship the beast whose
[7:11] names
[7:12] were not written in the book of life of
[7:14] the lamb slain from the
[7:15] from the foundation of the world and
[7:17] revelation 17
[7:18] 8 says the beast that thou saw was not
[7:21] was and is not and shall ascend out of
[7:23] the bottomless pit and go into perdition
[7:25] and they that dwell on the earth shall
[7:27] wonder whose names were not written in
[7:28] the book of life from the foundation of
[7:30] the world
[7:32] when they behold the beast that was and
[7:34] is not and yet is
[7:36] then in revelations 20 12-15 says and i
[7:38] saw the dead small and grace stand
[7:40] before god
[7:41] and the books were opened and another
[7:42] book was opened which is the book of
[7:44] life
[7:44] and the dead were judged out of those
[7:46] things which were written in the books
[7:47] according to their works
[7:49] and the sea gave up the dead which were
[7:51] in it and death and hell delivered up
[7:52] the dead which were in them
[7:54] and they were judged every man according
[7:56] to their works and death and hell were
[7:58] cast into the lake of fire
[7:59] this is the second death and whosoever
[8:02] was not found written in the book of
[8:03] life was cast into the lake of fire
[8:06] you can see that though there are other
[8:07] books mentioned there is always the
[8:09] reference to one book
[8:11] containing names in revelation it is
[8:13] called the lamb's book of life
[8:15] or the book of life so what is he saying
[8:17] he's saying that there's really just one
[8:19] book of life
[8:21] and the reason this is important is
[8:22] because when brother branham is
[8:23] ministering
[8:24] he he's making a distinction between two
[8:27] parts in the same book and i'll get to
[8:28] some quotes on that in a minute
[8:30] and we'll explain that but it's not
[8:32] really two books it's one record of book
[8:34] of life
[8:35] so all that will that will be in eternal
[8:37] life all that will be
[8:39] living beyond time is recorded in this
[8:41] book called book of life
[8:42] but it's it's got a diff two different
[8:44] parts to the book of life
[8:46] and he says that well first thing
[8:50] i wanna i wanna make note of here is he
[8:52] says it only has
[8:54] names recorded in that book all right
[8:57] it's just names it's not works because
[9:00] it says here that they were judged
[9:01] according to their works
[9:03] in revelations 20. if we go back up a
[9:06] little bit where it says revelations 20
[9:08] 12 to 15
[9:10] it said i saw the dead smaller great
[9:11] stand before god and the books
[9:13] were opened so there's multiple books
[9:15] were open and we see this
[9:17] in daniel's vision of the ancient of
[9:19] days coming and there was books
[9:21] and another book right so there's
[9:23] there's multiple books that are open
[9:25] but then another book was opened which
[9:28] is the book of life
[9:30] and the dead were judged out of those
[9:31] things which were written in the books
[9:33] according to their works so their works
[9:35] and the deeds and the things they've
[9:36] done
[9:37] were not recorded in the book of life
[9:39] they were in the other books
[9:41] the only thing in the book of life is
[9:43] names
[9:45] all right just names is in the book of
[9:47] life
[9:48] the other books are holding other things
[9:50] records of what was done
[9:52] deeds done and things like that are in
[9:54] the other books
[9:55] so we're clear on that moving forward
[9:58] okay
[10:00] brother branham says in 1965 works as
[10:03] faith expressed
[10:05] the baptists believe there are two
[10:06] separate books
[10:08] and in one way it is two separate books
[10:10] and another way it isn't two separate
[10:13] books
[10:14] that makes perfect sense to me what
[10:16] about you
[10:18] he said i'm body soul and spirit three
[10:20] separate people
[10:21] but it only makes me as one being so
[10:24] he's saying just like i'm one being but
[10:26] there's different parts to me
[10:28] the book of life also has two different
[10:30] parts can
[10:31] many people would think it's two
[10:32] different books but it's just
[10:34] two parts of the same book or like two
[10:37] chapters of the same book
[10:39] all right and so you know even in the
[10:42] torah the torah was one book
[10:44] the bible the old testament bible was
[10:45] one book but that book was made up of
[10:48] multiple scrolls that were rolled
[10:49] together
[10:50] right and that made up one book but you
[10:52] had a scroll for the book of isaiah and
[10:54] you had a scroll for the book of ezekiel
[10:55] and a scroll for the book of jeremiah
[10:57] and for the the writings of moses and
[10:59] all that but they were all rolled up
[11:00] together and made one
[11:01] torah or one bible which is one book
[11:04] and the book of life is one book but it
[11:07] has two sections
[11:09] all right there's
[11:12] only real one book of life like there
[11:15] was one germ of wheat that come
[11:17] up through the stalk and went through
[11:18] the tassel and out through the hosk and
[11:20] into the wheat
[11:21] all the way along there you say now
[11:23] that's wheat laying there it
[11:24] isn't the wheat it's the stalk but
[11:26] together it's the wheat see
[11:28] it's the wheat become because it's all
[11:30] one stalk but the wheat is what you're
[11:31] talking about the grain at the end of it
[11:33] the others was a carrier it must perish
[11:35] and that's the one
[11:36] one place it sounds like you can have
[11:38] your name taken off the book of life
[11:40] and the other place you can't do it so
[11:42] that's where it is
[11:43] it's all that great revelation there
[11:45] which was made known during the time of
[11:47] the seven seals
[11:48] why is it how some people can't believe
[11:50] it
[11:52] why is that how some people can't
[11:53] believe it this revelation that was
[11:55] under the seven seals is what answers
[11:57] the question of the two books
[11:58] and that's why i tell you that this
[12:00] church age book has the seven seals in
[12:02] it
[12:03] because it was edited and it was
[12:05] assembled after the seals were preached
[12:07] and brother branham could not have wrote
[12:09] this section about the lamb's book of
[12:11] life
[12:11] being two parts to one book until after
[12:14] the seals were opened
[12:16] all right all righty
[12:21] so he says in one place it sounds like
[12:24] you can have your name taken off
[12:25] the lamb's book of life that's one part
[12:28] and in another place it sounds like no
[12:30] matter what you can't have your name
[12:32] taken off the book of life both are true
[12:36] we're talking about two parts of the
[12:37] same book
[12:39] what's important is what revelation you
[12:42] have of which part you're on
[12:45] amen i don't know about you but if i
[12:48] found out there's a part to the book of
[12:49] life
[12:50] that no name can ever be taken off of no
[12:52] matter what you do
[12:54] past present future nothing can ever
[12:56] erase that name
[12:57] that that's the book that i'm really
[12:59] interested in
[13:00] amen that's the one i want to be part of
[13:04] he says in the invisible union of the
[13:05] bride of christ in 1965
[13:08] god had to open up those seven seals not
[13:11] in a denomination
[13:12] i've always been against it but out of
[13:14] denomination he might take a bride
[13:16] not a denominational bride he couldn't
[13:18] do it it's against his own word
[13:20] he opened those seven mysteries in there
[13:22] that shows forth
[13:23] brings forth those things that's been
[13:24] hid since the foundation of the world
[13:26] might be revealed in the last
[13:28] days to the sons of god they brought
[13:31] that forth now before the people
[13:33] that they see it there you know you know
[13:36] to this undenominational bride oh my
[13:39] there is your two books one of them is
[13:42] the lamb's book of life your name on
[13:44] there is predestinated on there
[13:45] can't go because you can no more take
[13:48] that away than nothing
[13:49] because it was for ordained to be on
[13:51] there but the regular book of life
[13:53] see this is how brother brenham's
[13:55] talking about the two parts of the same
[13:56] book
[13:57] but we know that he says multiple times
[14:00] that there's really only one book
[14:01] but there's two parts right this is why
[14:04] this is one of the reasons why the
[14:05] church age book is so important because
[14:08] this is where he took his time not in
[14:10] preaching
[14:11] but took his time to read over the notes
[14:13] and to place things in the right order
[14:15] because sometimes when he's preaching
[14:16] he's bouncing from subject to subject
[14:18] and it's really hard to know what he's
[14:19] talking about because many times when
[14:21] brother branham is preaching
[14:22] he makes a designation between these two
[14:24] parts in the book of life
[14:26] and most of the time when he's talking
[14:28] about the record of the eternal life
[14:30] or that that record of the life of god
[14:32] coming forth where your name cannot be
[14:34] removed from the book
[14:35] when he's talking about that more often
[14:37] than not he's saying
[14:38] the lamb's book of life and then
[14:42] more often than not when he's talking
[14:43] about that portion of the book of life
[14:46] where your name can be removed from the
[14:48] book of life he calls it the book of
[14:50] life
[14:51] but not always sometimes he crosses them
[14:55] because when he's just preaching he's
[14:56] just preaching right and so you have to
[14:59] know the subject you have to know what
[15:00] he's talking about
[15:01] but to me the thing that settles it all
[15:03] is when he had his time to review what
[15:05] was written in the book of life and to
[15:07] edit it
[15:07] and to correct it and make it right he
[15:09] lays it out really plain
[15:11] so now when you're listening to the
[15:12] tapes you know what he's talking about
[15:14] right so this is he says there
[15:17] there is your two books now we know he
[15:20] doesn't believe there's two books he
[15:22] just told us
[15:23] he doesn't believe there's two books but
[15:25] when he's preaching he's talking about
[15:27] two books
[15:28] because he's talking about the two parts
[15:30] to the same book of life
[15:33] one of them is the lamb's book of life
[15:34] and that's the term that he uses more
[15:36] often than not
[15:38] and the other one he calls the regular
[15:39] book of life
[15:41] he said in the but in the regular book
[15:43] of life you can take that off at any
[15:45] time what does that take your name off
[15:47] can be taken off
[15:48] at any time see you don't repent it's
[15:51] off anyway because you're going to stand
[15:53] the judgment
[15:54] the bride don't even stand the judgment
[15:56] goes in the rapture
[15:59] so let's take another look back in our
[16:00] church age book at page 281.
[16:20] so
[16:25] well i think i got the wrong one
[16:39] i don't have it correct so i'll just
[16:41] have to read this to you
[16:42] the church age book you might find it
[16:44] thus if god has so designed
[16:46] that there be those whose names are
[16:48] placed in a section of the book of life
[16:50] and cannot be erased for they are the
[16:51] names of his bride
[16:54] 282 okay
[16:58] yes 282 right in the middle i'm going
[17:01] right down to the middle
[17:02] you'll see some word and i italicized
[17:04] but i'm going just below that
[17:06] thank you brother bob thus
[17:09] if god has so designed that there be
[17:11] those whose names are placed in a
[17:12] section of the lamb's book of life
[17:14] so here he's making it clear that it's a
[17:16] section of the lamb's book of life
[17:19] and cannot be erased for they are the
[17:21] names of his bride
[17:23] then we must accept that if it also
[17:25] states that there are those whose names
[17:27] are placed in the record of the book of
[17:29] life
[17:29] but in the foreknowledge of god they
[17:31] were to fall and have their names
[17:32] removed
[17:33] we must accept that do you accept that
[17:38] and i'll show you in the scripture how
[17:39] that's really really clear you can see
[17:40] in the scripture
[17:41] it's not clear until god opens your eyes
[17:45] and a an a prophet of god who knows the
[17:49] mind of god
[17:50] can dive into the mind of god and bring
[17:51] out things pertinent to the age
[17:53] and as soon as he says it you go back to
[17:54] the bible and it's all over the place
[17:57] but we would have never seen it on our
[18:00] own
[18:00] never now even here he's talking about
[18:04] the one book of life but he's giving it
[18:05] two different titles
[18:07] he's calling the lamb's book of life
[18:09] that portion where your name cannot no
[18:11] matter whatever at any time be removed
[18:13] from that
[18:14] portion then he's talking about the book
[18:15] of life where your name
[18:17] can be removed
[18:20] okay and he says hey god did that
[18:23] and we go back to the sovereignty of god
[18:25] and if god did that
[18:27] who are we to argue with what he did and
[18:28] say why did you do it that way
[18:30] who are we to say fair who are we to say
[18:33] not right who already say bad idea god
[18:36] right we just simply accept it and we
[18:38] trust the lord that he knows what he's
[18:40] doing
[18:40] because he's infinite in wisdom and he's
[18:42] infinite in knowledge and he's just and
[18:44] he's righteous and he's holy
[18:46] and none of that's going to change so we
[18:49] can't from our perspective look at a
[18:51] just righteous holy
[18:52] perfect god perfect in wisdom perfect
[18:54] and understanding perfect in knowledge
[18:56] and try to judge him better whether or
[18:58] not we think he's fair or right or doing
[19:00] things the way we would do it
[19:02] right we just must simply accept it
[19:07] right in the middle and if there are
[19:09] those whose names were never placed upon
[19:12] a record of life
[19:13] we must accept that also and if there
[19:16] are those who will enter into life
[19:17] eternal after the white throne judgment
[19:20] solely on the grounds of being good and
[19:22] kind and just to the elect of god who
[19:24] are his brethren
[19:25] then we cannot but accept that for who
[19:28] knoweth the mind of the lord that we he
[19:29] should instruct him
[19:31] rather let us be subject in faith to him
[19:33] who is our father
[19:34] and live all right so we have
[19:38] these two sections which he typically
[19:41] calls the lamb's book of life the
[19:43] he also calls it the eternal record or
[19:45] that which came from god
[19:47] that which can never be removed from the
[19:49] book of life and then he's got this
[19:50] other portion that he typically
[19:52] calls the rest of the book of life or
[19:53] the regular part of the book of life
[19:55] he's got all kinds of names for it
[19:57] and your name can be removed off that
[19:59] and then there's a whole group of people
[20:01] that never ever had their name recorded
[20:04] on the book of life
[20:06] so you have names recorded in what he
[20:09] calls the eternal or the bride section
[20:11] of the book
[20:11] you have names recorded in the rest of
[20:13] the book and you have names that were
[20:15] never recorded in the book
[20:16] and if they were never recorded in the
[20:18] book they will never be recorded in the
[20:20] book
[20:21] they had no chance at eternal life they
[20:23] never will have a chance at eternal life
[20:25] and and that's for god to decide
[20:29] and we look at that and say how can he
[20:31] do that he happens to be god
[20:34] right he tells us the parable of the
[20:37] seed sower he said i saw
[20:39] in in the in the uh the seed
[20:42] the seed tour went out and he sowed some
[20:43] seeds and an enemy come along behind and
[20:46] he sowed some seeds
[20:47] and over the course of time it came up
[20:49] and there was tears
[20:50] and with the wheat right
[20:54] and they said what should we do should
[20:55] we pull out the the wheat he says no
[20:58] he says wait till the harvest time
[20:59] gather the tariffs first
[21:01] set them aside for the burning and then
[21:02] gather the wheat now
[21:04] what he's talking about there is serpent
[21:06] seed he's going right back to serpent
[21:08] seed
[21:09] that god was sowing his seed into the
[21:11] earth and he intended for adam and eve
[21:13] to bring forth a god race
[21:15] to bring forth a super race to bring
[21:16] forth christ but that satan got in
[21:19] through the serpent and
[21:20] interjected through adultery another
[21:22] seed line which became the tares
[21:25] and so because that the enemy that satan
[21:28] came down
[21:28] and worked through a vessel on earth and
[21:31] began a hybriding process that brought
[21:33] forth a mixed seed line
[21:34] how is god now responsible to save the
[21:36] tares
[21:38] it wasn't god who sowed the tares
[21:41] god did not sow the tares god is not
[21:44] responsible for the tares
[21:45] that's why god has the right to record
[21:47] names on a book
[21:48] and put some in a portion that will
[21:50] never be erased some in a portion
[21:52] knowing that there will be some that
[21:53] fall away from this book
[21:54] and be erased and some that never made
[21:56] it to the book
[21:58] right because god is not responsible for
[22:01] what satan has done
[22:03] and he's not responsible to accept what
[22:06] is not his
[22:08] amen that's why the revelation of
[22:12] serpent seed makes
[22:13] everything else makes sense amen
[22:17] that was the hardest revelation for me
[22:19] to get
[22:21] i mean it took me some time i labored
[22:23] and labored and labored
[22:24] but just as soon as god dropped that in
[22:26] my heart and i knew it it made the whole
[22:28] bible make perfect sense
[22:30] amen
[22:35] brother branham says in the invisible
[22:37] union of the bride of christ
[22:38] here it brings into view the two books
[22:40] that's going to be mysterious to you
[22:42] when you read the book of the seven
[22:43] church ages
[22:45] here again he's pointing us back to the
[22:47] book of the seven church ages this book
[22:48] that was written
[22:49] and he's talking about this book right
[22:50] here he said here it brings in the view
[22:52] the two books that's going to be
[22:54] mysterious to you when you read the book
[22:56] of the seven church ages
[22:57] so brother branham saying it's going to
[22:58] be a mystery to you
[23:00] it's a mysterious thing these two books
[23:03] are these two parts of the same book
[23:05] and but you're going to read it where
[23:08] in the book of the seven church ages
[23:11] the two books book of life said one says
[23:13] you can put your name on
[23:14] you never come off the other one says
[23:17] that you take his name
[23:18] out of the book of life all right
[23:28] let's go to john chapter 5 in our bibles
[23:32] saint john chapter 5.
[23:42] actually before we go to saint john
[23:44] chapter five i'm sorry if we can go to
[23:47] first thessalonians first
[23:55] first thessalonians chapter four
[24:07] first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13
[24:09] but i would not have you to be ignorant
[24:11] brethren concerning them which are
[24:13] asleep
[24:14] that you sorrow not even as others which
[24:16] have no hope
[24:18] now we're talking about two parts to the
[24:20] book of life
[24:21] but i said we're going to talk about two
[24:22] parts and two resurrections we're going
[24:24] to talk about two resurrections today
[24:26] and this is really the dividing line
[24:29] there
[24:30] we know that there's two resurrections
[24:31] in the scriptures right there's more
[24:33] there's a lot of resurrection in the
[24:34] scriptures
[24:35] but for the gentiles there's two
[24:36] resurrections there's the resurrection
[24:38] that we're talking about here
[24:39] in 1st thessalonians when christ comes
[24:42] and gathers the elect to himself and the
[24:43] bride meets him in the air
[24:45] so we know we have that and we know that
[24:46] after that the rest of the dead live not
[24:48] for a thousand years and we'll get into
[24:50] that
[24:50] then after that there's what's called a
[24:52] general resurrection when
[24:54] all the dead come and stand before
[24:56] christ and the bride at the white throne
[24:57] judgment
[24:59] all right and so what separates those
[25:02] two resurrections
[25:05] how come some go now and some go later
[25:08] because we find at the white throne
[25:09] judgment
[25:10] there are theirs that those at the white
[25:12] throne judgment that are called
[25:13] righteous
[25:14] and that are given entrance into eternal
[25:15] life
[25:17] so if there's those that stand before
[25:19] the the white throne judgment of christ
[25:21] and they're standing there
[25:22] and he declares them righteous he
[25:24] separates them from the rest
[25:25] and he gives them entrance into eternal
[25:27] life they're allowed to come into
[25:29] eternal life
[25:30] then what's different between those and
[25:33] that group that's raptured the first
[25:35] time and doesn't go to white throne
[25:36] judgment
[25:38] that's the difference of the two two
[25:40] parts of the book that's what separates
[25:42] those two parts
[25:43] the one which is the the bride's book or
[25:46] the record of the eternal
[25:48] or what he calls most often lamb's book
[25:50] of life
[25:51] that is the one that takes the first
[25:53] resurrection
[25:55] the rest of the book will be judged when
[25:58] they come up in the general resurrection
[26:00] but that general resurrection isn't only
[26:02] for those that are declared righteous in
[26:04] that judgment
[26:04] the general resurrection is for all the
[26:07] dead the righteous
[26:08] and the unrighteous that's why we know
[26:11] that there's two separate
[26:12] it's easy to see two separate
[26:14] resurrections because
[26:16] the the dead in christ shall rise that's
[26:17] not those who are going to the lake of
[26:19] fire
[26:20] right the dead in christ shall rise then
[26:23] at the end of the thousand years
[26:25] though all the dead shall rise all right
[26:28] let's look at this in first
[26:29] thessalonians
[26:31] but i would not have you be ignorant
[26:33] brethren concerning them which are
[26:35] asleep this is a funny word and this is
[26:37] what we're going to pay attention to
[26:38] right now
[26:40] he says sleep it's just like jesus when
[26:42] when he was talking about lazarus after
[26:44] lazarus passed away he told the
[26:45] disciples
[26:46] lazarus our friend is asleep i said oh
[26:49] great you know he's resting he's going
[26:51] to get better
[26:52] and he he finally out of frustration
[26:54] jesus had said
[26:55] no he's dead okay
[26:58] you're not catching what i'm talking
[27:00] about but jesus is making
[27:02] you know jesus wasn't wasting words he's
[27:04] not out here just saying funny little
[27:05] things jesus wasn't a man
[27:07] who just spilt words all over the place
[27:09] he said what he meant he meant what he
[27:11] said
[27:12] he said lazarus our friend is asleep
[27:14] because he knew that there was something
[27:16] in lazarus that could be resurrected
[27:17] that could be called back
[27:19] lazarus wasn't part of the dead now it's
[27:21] funny that lazarus had died in his
[27:23] natural life lazarus was dead
[27:25] but yet jesus says he's asleep
[27:28] because you're going to go call him from
[27:29] the dead but yet there come a man one
[27:31] time to him he wanted to be a disciple
[27:33] and follow
[27:34] him and and jesus says come follow me
[27:36] and he says let me go first
[27:37] and dare bury the dead in my family like
[27:40] he had a relative who had died
[27:42] and jesus says let the dead bury
[27:45] the dead what
[27:49] how are dead people going to dig a grave
[27:51] to bury dead people
[27:52] unless he's talking about you which are
[27:54] dead yet where you while you live
[27:59] there are those who are dead yet while
[28:03] you live
[28:05] and he said let the dead bury the dead
[28:07] what is he talking about
[28:09] those who do not have representation in
[28:11] the book of life
[28:14] are already dead
[28:18] and jesus knew who they were let the
[28:20] dead bury the dead
[28:22] come and follow me lazarus has died
[28:26] no he's asleep
[28:30] see jesus is being very specific these
[28:33] are the little love secrets that's
[28:34] laying in the bible
[28:36] you know paul came in the new testament
[28:40] paul and peter and them
[28:42] there they have the old testament you
[28:43] know you have the writings of moses you
[28:45] have the law and you
[28:46] you have the prophets and you have all
[28:47] this and what was
[28:49] veiled in there it was veiled the
[28:51] mystery
[28:53] of how god was going to bring salvation
[28:55] through christ
[28:57] and bring it to the gentiles and it was
[29:00] laying in a mysterious form it was all
[29:02] written
[29:02] out it was all prophesied but it was
[29:04] laying in a mystery and as it happened
[29:06] they never recognized it but after that
[29:08] happened the apostles who had actually
[29:10] caught the mind of christ
[29:12] would look back and say this prophecy
[29:14] means this and this prophecy means this
[29:16] so the new testament is revealing
[29:19] the mystery that was laying in the old
[29:22] testament
[29:24] but while they were revealing the
[29:26] mystery of the old testament
[29:28] they were laying in the new testament a
[29:30] mystery for the end time
[29:33] right so there was an exodus and they
[29:35] were having a nexus they were having a
[29:36] passover lamb and they were putting
[29:38] blood on a door
[29:39] and they were having bitter waters uh uh
[29:42] uh
[29:42] out there they have a striking a rock to
[29:44] get water and they were having this
[29:46] problem with balaam and they were having
[29:47] all this
[29:47] that was really what was happening at
[29:49] the time it was a record of what was
[29:51] taking place but it was also a
[29:53] foreshadow
[29:54] of what to come so that in the bible
[29:56] could be laying a mystery
[29:57] so that the other end when the disciples
[29:59] got to this fulfillment of the mystery
[30:01] they could look back and say see it's
[30:02] been laying there all the time
[30:06] and the same exact thing has happened in
[30:08] our day the apostles were writing about
[30:10] what was really happening
[30:11] the great falling away paul going into
[30:13] prison the persecutions and the
[30:15] all the things that were happening at
[30:16] the time he was talking about that
[30:19] and at the time he was revealing what
[30:20] had happened before he was laying down
[30:22] what was happening now
[30:23] and he was hiding in there a mystery
[30:27] so that a prophet of god could come at
[30:28] the end time and go back and say see
[30:31] this is that and this is that and this
[30:33] is that
[30:35] so everything happens exactly the same
[30:37] way over and over and over again
[30:41] god is the same he says i changed not
[30:43] and that's what this prophetic
[30:45] ministry is it's the same thing that we
[30:47] saw happening in the new testament
[30:48] pointing back to the old it's the same
[30:50] thing happening now looking back at the
[30:51] new testament
[30:52] and looking back at the old testament
[30:53] and pulling out of there the mysteries
[30:55] that were laying there the love secrets
[30:57] for the bride
[30:59] right amen
[31:02] so this is one of those love secrets he
[31:04] sleeps
[31:07] rather concerning them which are asleep
[31:08] that you saw not even as others which
[31:10] have no hope
[31:11] for if we believe that jesus died and
[31:13] rose again even so them
[31:15] also would sleep in jesus what do they
[31:17] do in jesus
[31:18] sleep in jesus he's not talking about
[31:20] lazy people
[31:24] right those also that sleep in jesus
[31:27] will god bring with him for this we say
[31:30] unto you by the word of the lord that we
[31:32] which are alive and remain unto the
[31:33] coming of the lord shall not prevent
[31:35] them which are
[31:36] asleep they are not
[31:40] dead
[31:43] they are asleep
[31:46] why is it that they are not dead because
[31:48] if you possess within your vessel the
[31:50] seed gene of eternal life you
[31:51] can not die
[31:58] that's the portion of the book called
[32:00] the lamb's book of life that's the
[32:02] portion of the book
[32:02] called the record of the bride that's
[32:04] that portion and that portion doesn't
[32:06] die
[32:07] that portion sleeps
[32:12] hallelujah
[32:15] 16 for the lord himself shall descend
[32:17] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[32:18] of the archangel with the trump of god
[32:20] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[32:22] see he calls him dead but he calls him
[32:24] a specific kind of dead dead in christ
[32:28] if you're dead in christ you're only
[32:29] asleep
[32:31] hallelujah then we which are alive and
[32:34] remain shall be caught up together with
[32:35] them in the clouds to meet the lord in
[32:37] the air
[32:38] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[32:42] that's very important that we know that
[32:43] we'll ever be with the lord who is the
[32:45] only group that will ever be with the
[32:47] lord
[32:47] his bride we'll never leave aside
[32:51] never leave his presence but will serve
[32:53] him and minister to him throughout
[32:54] eternity the
[32:56] bride are the ones who dwell in the city
[32:57] when new jerusalem comes down
[32:59] everyone else dwells outside of the city
[33:01] everyone at the white throne judgment
[33:03] who's given entrance into the kingdom
[33:05] entrance into everlasting life they are
[33:07] outside the city bringing their glory
[33:09] and honor into the city but the only
[33:11] ones who dwell
[33:12] in the city are the bride of jesus
[33:14] christ the lamb
[33:15] and the 144 thousand okay
[33:19] so there's distinctions there's
[33:22] distinctions
[33:24] then 18 says wherefore comfort one
[33:27] another with these words
[33:28] i don't know about you but i'm comforted
[33:30] right now amen
[33:35] let's go now let's go to john 5.
[33:38] saint john chapter 5.
[33:46] excuse me saint john chapter 5. and
[33:52] we'll read
[33:52] verse 24. verily verily i say unto you
[33:56] he
[33:57] that heareth my word and believeth on
[33:59] him that sent me
[34:01] hath important word very important word
[34:04] you might want to underline that those
[34:08] that were able to
[34:09] to hear jesus's word
[34:12] now when jesus was speaking was he
[34:15] speaking audibly
[34:18] he was speaking the crowds of thousands
[34:20] of people at a time
[34:22] did they hear his word right
[34:25] he's not talking about natural hearing
[34:28] because many heard and rejected but he's
[34:30] talking about somebody who heard and
[34:32] knew what he was talking about
[34:34] heard and believed heard and perceived
[34:36] heard and received the word
[34:38] that's the hearing that he's talking
[34:40] about he that heareth my word and
[34:43] believeth on him that sent me
[34:45] hath everlasting life and
[34:48] shall not come into condemnation but is
[34:50] past from death
[34:52] unto life this is why he says you're
[34:54] asleep
[34:56] because if you hear his word believing
[34:59] on him that sent him
[35:00] then you have hath you already have it
[35:03] now you're going to get it
[35:04] not at some future date will you receive
[35:06] it see that's the difference between
[35:08] those who come in the first resurrection
[35:09] and the second resurrection
[35:11] the first resurrection are those that
[35:12] sleep that are dead in christ
[35:14] and all that are dead in christ when he
[35:16] returns will rise if you're not dead in
[35:18] christ if you're not asleep
[35:19] you stay in the ground until the
[35:21] thousand years are up and then come for
[35:23] the general resurrection
[35:24] because you hath not life
[35:28] how do we know that keep your place in
[35:30] saint john
[35:31] and let's go back to revelations 20.
[35:40] revelations 20 verse 11. don't lose john
[35:43] because we're going back
[35:47] and i saw a great white throne in him
[35:49] that sat on it from whose face the earth
[35:51] and the heaven fled away
[35:52] and there was found no place for them
[35:55] verse 12
[35:56] and i saw the dead the sleeping
[35:59] the dead in christ who did he see
[36:03] the dead small and great stand before
[36:05] god and the books were open
[36:06] and another book was opened which is the
[36:08] book of life and the dead
[36:10] not the sleeping not the dead in christ
[36:13] not the sleeping saints
[36:14] but the dead
[36:19] but the dead were judged out of those
[36:20] books which were written in the books
[36:21] according to their works
[36:22] and the sea gave up the sleeping
[36:26] the dead in christ the sleeping saints
[36:29] no the sea gave up the dead which were
[36:31] in it and
[36:32] death and hell delivered up the dead
[36:34] which were in them
[36:35] and they were judged every man according
[36:37] to their works
[36:39] see if you have life everlasting
[36:44] if you have life everlasting you will
[36:46] come up in the first resurrection
[36:51] because he says you shall not come into
[36:54] condemnation
[36:55] now that word condemnation in the greek
[36:57] is crisis
[36:58] increases is used 48 times in the new
[37:01] testament
[37:02] and out of 48 times that it's used 41
[37:05] times
[37:05] its interpreted judgment
[37:09] you shall not come into the judgment
[37:12] why because you have life already
[37:14] there's nothing to judge
[37:17] you have been washed by the blood of the
[37:18] lamb you have eternal life dwelling
[37:20] inside
[37:21] all your sins have been remitted by that
[37:23] by calvary there is nothing left to
[37:26] judge on you
[37:27] you cannot be judged because god cannot
[37:30] judge
[37:30] through blood if there's blood there's
[37:32] no judgment
[37:34] right and so those that have received
[37:37] that have received his word and believed
[37:39] on him that sent him
[37:40] half life half everlasting life
[37:44] all right and shall not come into the
[37:46] judgment
[37:47] but has already passed
[37:50] from death unto life
[37:54] that's why he says they're asleep
[37:59] amen if you're not asleep you're dead
[38:05] all right back to john john 5.
[38:13] he says and let's read 24 again just to
[38:15] stay in context verily verily i say unto
[38:17] you that he that heareth my word and
[38:18] believeth on him that sent me
[38:20] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[38:22] into condemnation
[38:23] but is passed from death and to life
[38:26] first resurrection
[38:28] 25 verily verily i say unto you the hour
[38:30] is coming and now is
[38:32] when the dead shall hear the voice of
[38:34] the son of god
[38:35] and they that here shall live what he's
[38:38] talking about is not the second
[38:40] resurrection in this verse he's talking
[38:42] about those that become born again
[38:45] he's talking about becoming born again
[38:50] then we go down and skip down to verse
[38:51] 28 marvel not at this for the hours
[38:54] coming in which
[38:55] all that are in the grave shall hear his
[38:57] voice
[38:58] now stop right there
[39:01] when christ comes the first time and
[39:04] there's a there's a rapture of the
[39:05] saints
[39:07] right and the dead in christ shall rise
[39:09] the dead in christ
[39:11] shall rise those that are asleep shall
[39:13] rise and meet him in the air
[39:15] at that time do all that are in the
[39:17] graves hear his voice
[39:20] no this is
[39:24] this is talking about the second
[39:26] resurrection when he's this
[39:28] verse 28 he's no longer talking about
[39:30] the first resurrection he's talking
[39:31] about the second resurrection
[39:33] when all the dead come up out of the
[39:36] graves
[39:36] marvel not at this for the hours coming
[39:38] in which all that are in the grave shall
[39:40] hear his voice
[39:41] and shall come forth they that have done
[39:43] good unto the resurrection of life
[39:45] and they that have done evil unto the
[39:47] resurrection of damnation
[39:49] that's the second resurrection
[39:52] because in the second resurrection of
[39:54] white throne judgment you have those on
[39:56] the right hand and those in the left
[39:57] hand and those that are given entrance
[39:58] into the
[39:59] eternal life and those that are cast
[40:00] into the lake of fire verse 28 and verse
[40:03] 29
[40:04] is speaking of the second resurrection
[40:07] are we clear on that see how once once
[40:11] god exposes it through the mouthpiece of
[40:13] a prophet you can go to the word you see
[40:14] it over
[40:15] and over and over and over and over
[40:18] again
[40:19] amen all right
[40:24] let's go to john 6. just turn over
[40:28] to the next chapter john 6 43.
[40:36] john chapter 6 verse 43 reads jesus
[40:38] therefore answered and said unto them
[40:40] murmur not among yourselves no man can
[40:42] come to me
[40:43] except the father which has sent me draw
[40:45] him and i will raise him up at the last
[40:47] day
[40:48] and i want to ask you what raise up in
[40:50] the last days he talking about
[40:53] okay he this
[40:56] is not talking about the general
[40:58] resurrection where
[40:59] those that are declared righteous go
[41:01] into eternal life and those that are
[41:02] unrighteous go into eternal damnation
[41:05] what he's saying here is i will raise
[41:07] him up he is speaking of the first
[41:09] resurrection for those that are in
[41:10] christ
[41:11] those that have everlasting life those
[41:13] that have passed
[41:14] from death unto life right those that
[41:17] shall not come into the judgment
[41:19] that's what he's speaking of when he
[41:20] says i shall raise him up at the last
[41:22] day
[41:23] right because we know everybody's going
[41:26] to be raised up in the last day
[41:28] right you can be the most vile wicked
[41:30] person that's ever walked the face of
[41:32] the earth hate god spit in his face
[41:33] curse and blaspheme every day of your
[41:35] life
[41:35] and guess what you're going to get
[41:36] resurrected
[41:39] is that true every
[41:42] one that ever lived on the earth whether
[41:44] you had your name in the book of life or
[41:46] you never had your name in the book of
[41:47] life or you had your name in the book of
[41:48] life and it was removed it doesn't
[41:50] matter
[41:50] everyone before the white throne
[41:53] judgment at the end of the millennium
[41:55] everyone will be resurrected so when
[41:58] jesus is saying
[41:59] i will raise him up he is not talking
[42:01] about general resurrection
[42:03] he can only be talking about the
[42:05] resurrection of the dead in christ
[42:10] this is so important because
[42:13] how do i become
[42:17] in christ
[42:20] because it says everyone all the dead in
[42:23] christ so you have to be in christ
[42:24] and so if i'm not in christ i'm not
[42:26] taking part of that first resurrection
[42:28] when we know first corinthians tells us
[42:29] by one spirit we are all baptized into
[42:32] one body
[42:33] and you have to get into christ in this
[42:36] life through the new birth through the
[42:37] baptism of the holy ghost
[42:38] you have to get into christ that way
[42:40] when you go to the grave and are
[42:41] sleeping
[42:42] you're considered dead in christ because
[42:44] you were in christ
[42:46] and if you were ever in christ with your
[42:48] dead in christ living in christ any time
[42:49] you're in christ
[42:50] it means because you were in christ
[42:52] before the foundation of the world
[42:54] means your name was recorded in the
[42:55] section of book of life that's called
[42:57] the bride's book or the eternal portion
[42:59] that part
[43:00] that can never ever never
[43:03] be removed and all of them
[43:07] will come into christ by the new birth
[43:11] that's who he's talking about here verse
[43:13] 45
[43:14] it is written in the prophet prophets
[43:16] and they shall be all taught of god
[43:18] every man therefore that hath heard and
[43:20] hath learned of the father cometh unto
[43:22] me
[43:23] not that any man has seen the father
[43:25] save he which is of god
[43:27] he hath seen the father verily verily i
[43:29] say unto you
[43:30] he that believeth on me hath
[43:34] everlasting life
[43:38] they receive the new birth they're born
[43:40] again they're in
[43:41] christ if they die they sleep or they're
[43:44] dead in christ
[43:45] those are the ones that already have
[43:48] everlasting life
[43:49] that when christ comes back to gather
[43:51] his bride they will resurrect we which
[43:54] are alive and remain our bodies will be
[43:55] changed
[43:56] we will go to meet him in the air and
[43:58] forever be with our lord
[44:02] that's that section of the book of life
[44:06] that section that can never be removed
[44:08] amen
[44:12] they want to read one more passage in
[44:13] john 6. let's go to verse 53
[44:19] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[44:20] i say unto you except ye eat the flesh
[44:23] of the son of man and drink his blood
[44:25] you have no life in you
[44:30] for my flesh is meat and deed and my
[44:32] blood is drink indeed
[44:33] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[44:35] blood dwelleth
[44:36] in me and i in him
[44:40] as the living father has sent me and i
[44:42] live by the father so he that
[44:44] eateth me even he shall live by me this
[44:47] is that bread which came down from
[44:48] heaven not as your fathers did eat manna
[44:50] and are dead
[44:52] he that eateth this bread shall live
[44:55] for ever
[44:58] that's those who are in christ that's
[45:02] those if they should pass away before he
[45:04] returns that will
[45:05] sleep not die
[45:10] how do you drink his blood and eat his
[45:13] flesh
[45:15] see that he said it's requirement right
[45:18] that's why many left him because they
[45:19] thought how
[45:20] what's he saying how can we eat his
[45:23] flesh and drink his blood
[45:25] amen and we know that his blood was
[45:27] spilt was the new testament was the new
[45:29] covenant for us
[45:30] and he said he is the bread of life that
[45:32] comes down from heaven he is the manna
[45:34] he is that portion that sustains us he
[45:36] is the word
[45:37] in the beginning was the word and the
[45:38] word was with god amen we know that
[45:40] there was a body made and that word was
[45:42] but that that word became a body and
[45:44] that body
[45:45] bled and died for us amen and now
[45:48] brother branham said you're feasting on
[45:50] the body word of the son of man you're
[45:52] feasting on christ the word
[45:54] not that we're cutting up the body that
[45:56] was on the cross and we're eating it
[45:58] but that body that was on the cross
[46:00] represented the full word of god
[46:02] and the full word of god was crucified
[46:04] for us why because we're part of the
[46:06] word of god
[46:06] because that record of eternal life is
[46:08] part of the word of god and it had to be
[46:10] paid for
[46:11] it had to be redeemed because of what
[46:12] happened in the garden of eden
[46:14] threw it into chaos and so now something
[46:16] has to come and redeem it back
[46:18] but what redeemed it back it has to be
[46:19] the same kind
[46:22] has to be the word in the form of flesh
[46:25] crucified
[46:26] amen so we're not eating flesh we are
[46:29] eating the word
[46:31] but you must eat the word
[46:35] not spit it out not refuse it
[46:38] and not say that doesn't suit my taste
[46:41] because if we're rejecting the word
[46:44] we're rejecting christ
[46:45] if we have a portion that doesn't suit
[46:47] our tastes and we're spitting it out
[46:48] we're spitting out christ
[46:53] and you do not have eternal life you do
[46:55] not already have eternal life
[46:57] if you're taking the word and spitting
[46:59] it out if you're looking at it and says
[47:01] i don't think i like that
[47:05] those who are on that record of eternal
[47:07] life do not have a picky appetite
[47:12] they come to the smorgasbord of god's
[47:14] word and they say give it all i want i
[47:16] want one of everything
[47:18] give me one of each i may not understand
[47:20] it it may go against my flesh
[47:22] it may cost me a whole lot to fulfill
[47:24] this word and let it live in my life it
[47:26] may cost me my relationships it may cost
[47:28] me my job it may cost me my
[47:29] status my prestige whatever it costs me
[47:32] but so be it because i want to eat
[47:34] every part of christ amen
[47:40] that's why you can see those who are
[47:42] rejecting this word and those are
[47:44] rejecting parts of it and spitting it
[47:46] out
[47:46] they do not have life already they will
[47:49] not be part of the first resurrection
[47:51] because the only way to be part of the
[47:52] first resurrection is the half-life to
[47:54] be passed from death and to life
[47:57] to be in christ you can't get in christ
[48:00] if you're rejecting christ
[48:01] it's impossible now i want to i want to
[48:04] read a passage this is a long passage
[48:06] but let's read together
[48:07] the church age book on page 282 and i
[48:11] think that's right
[48:19] yeah 282 and i'm going to start at the
[48:21] last paragraph of 282
[48:23] and we're going to read a couple pages
[48:24] together so hang with me follow along in
[48:26] your book
[48:26] this is really really good this is one
[48:29] of my favorite sections right here
[48:31] page 282 last paragraph to understand
[48:35] this subject even more clearly
[48:37] it will now be wise to approach it from
[48:39] the standpoint of the church through the
[48:40] ages
[48:42] up until now we have been thinking in
[48:43] terms of the removal of the names of
[48:45] individuals
[48:46] now we want to consider not the
[48:48] individuals but the groups represented
[48:50] in the church
[48:51] to do so we will liken the church
[48:53] through the ages to the wheat plant
[48:56] a grain of wheat is planted to the end
[48:57] that a single grain of wheat will
[48:59] produce and multiply itself through a
[49:00] certain process during a certain period
[49:02] of time
[49:03] that single seed will die but in dying
[49:06] the life that was in that
[49:08] will come up into a plant which in turn
[49:10] will be the bearer or carrier of that
[49:12] life which is to come back to
[49:14] originality
[49:15] in a multiplied form so that's the whole
[49:17] purpose we live in farm country we're
[49:18] surrounded by wheat in the summer
[49:20] the purpose of putting the wheat in the
[49:21] ground is so you get a whole bunch more
[49:23] wheat
[49:24] and there's a process to that you don't
[49:26] put wheat in the ground and come back in
[49:28] a couple months and there's a bunch of
[49:29] wheat laying on the ground
[49:31] there's a whole process by which the
[49:33] wheat matures and becomes wheat again
[49:35] and that's what he's talking about all
[49:37] this process
[49:38] processes that goes back to reproducing
[49:41] the life
[49:46] jesus the great royal seed died that
[49:48] matches one who is the life of the
[49:50] church stands in the midst of the church
[49:52] for all seven church ages
[49:53] giving his life to the church the
[49:55] carrier or bearer
[49:57] to the end that his very life will
[49:59] reproduce in bodies like unto his in the
[50:02] resurrection
[50:03] it is at the resurrection that the royal
[50:05] seed will see many royal seeds
[50:07] like unto himself and they will be even
[50:09] as he is
[50:10] for says john we shall be like him that
[50:13] is what john the baptist was referring
[50:14] to when he said that jesus would gather
[50:16] the wheat into the garner
[50:18] that was the resurrection where the
[50:19] redeemed who had been elected unto
[50:21] eternal life
[50:22] came in so jesus when he's talking about
[50:26] gathering the wheat into the garner we
[50:28] realize that when the seed goes in
[50:30] it comes up and there's an entire plant
[50:32] and brother brenham here calls it the
[50:34] carrier or bearer of life
[50:35] because we know that seed life is coming
[50:37] up through the stalk
[50:39] coming up through the uh the tassel
[50:41] coming up through all this
[50:43] but the only thing that we're interested
[50:45] in is seed again right
[50:47] that's the part we want we won't see it
[50:50] again
[50:50] so god what brother branham here is
[50:53] saying is
[50:54] that when he gathers the the wheat into
[50:57] the garner
[50:58] he is not gathering the entire plant
[51:00] into the garner
[51:02] he is coming back to gather the wheat
[51:06] into the gardener the rest of it doesn't
[51:09] get gathered into the garner
[51:11] now there's a purpose for that and we'll
[51:12] read that here but he says this is the
[51:14] whole church
[51:16] but he's only coming for the wheat
[51:21] second paragraph now then the record of
[51:23] this wheat plant
[51:24] whose end is to reproduce the original
[51:26] seed in multiplied form
[51:28] is the book of life
[51:31] so he's telling us and this really makes
[51:32] it easy for me he's telling us that the
[51:34] book of life both
[51:36] sections the book of life is really
[51:39] the record of the wheat plant coming
[51:41] forth
[51:42] the wheat plant that's supposed to
[51:44] produce wheat again
[51:46] it is not the record of everything
[51:47] that's going in the first resurrection
[51:49] and everything that's going to be
[51:50] gathered and garnered gathered into the
[51:52] garner that's the first resurrection and
[51:54] that's wheat
[51:55] seed only
[51:58] but this book of life is the record of
[52:00] the whole plant
[52:02] from blade to tassel to stalk to tassel
[52:04] the whole plant
[52:06] right and you can't have wheat without a
[52:08] plant
[52:11] second paragraph now read the first
[52:14] sentence again now then the record of
[52:15] this wheat plant whose end is to
[52:16] reproduce the original seed in
[52:18] multiplied form
[52:19] is the book of life i repeat the history
[52:22] or record of this wheat plant is the
[52:24] book of life of which a part of the book
[52:26] of life
[52:27] is the record of the eternal life a
[52:29] section of the book of life this is
[52:32] convincingly seen by examining the wheat
[52:34] plant
[52:34] a bear seed is sown soon a blade is seen
[52:37] but that is not the wheat yet
[52:39] then it grows into a stalk this is not
[52:41] yet wheat life is there but not the
[52:43] wheat
[52:43] then at the end of the stalk is a little
[52:45] spike that sends out a tassel
[52:47] still a wheat plant but no wheat yet
[52:50] then the plant is pollenized and we see
[52:51] the chaff grow
[52:52] this looks mighty like the wheat but it
[52:54] is not yet seed
[52:56] then forms the wheat and the husks it is
[52:58] now back to what it was originally
[53:00] now the ripened wheat is harvested
[53:04] next paragraph jesus christ died he gave
[53:06] his life that life was to come back upon
[53:08] the church and bring many sons
[53:10] like unto himself into glory in the
[53:12] resurrection
[53:13] but as the wheat seed had to have a
[53:15] carrier to bring forth multiplied wheat
[53:17] seed
[53:17] even so there had to be a church which
[53:19] would be the carrier of life of christ
[53:22] as the blade stalked tassel and husk
[53:24] were the carriers
[53:25] for the seed but not the seed itself so
[53:28] the church
[53:29] corporate through the ages has been the
[53:30] carrier of the true seed
[53:32] though not the seed itself that is why
[53:35] we can say that the book of life is the
[53:37] whole
[53:38] wheat plant
[53:42] keep reading let's go and let's go over
[53:44] that again here is that original seed
[53:46] that was planted it produced a blade
[53:48] that wasn't it it produced a stalk not
[53:50] it either
[53:51] here comes husk in which the wheat is to
[53:52] form that isn't it the tassels appear
[53:55] then pollen falls on those pistols part
[53:58] of that plant is quickened
[54:00] something of that original seed that
[54:01] came up through the rest of that plant
[54:03] turns into seed why didn't the whole
[54:05] plant go into seed
[54:07] because it was created to that end
[54:10] just part of that plant can go back to
[54:12] being seed because just part of that
[54:14] wheat plant
[54:14] is eternal life wheat
[54:18] you have a perfect type of that in
[54:20] israel leaving egypt
[54:22] they came out about 2 million strong all
[54:24] escaped through the sacrificial blood
[54:26] all were baptized in the red sea all
[54:28] came up out of the water enjoying holy
[54:30] spirit manifestations and blessings
[54:32] all late angel food all drank of the
[54:34] rock that followed them
[54:35] yet except for a very few they were not
[54:38] but carriers for the children who should
[54:40] follow them and go into canaanland
[54:42] all israel is not israel and all but a
[54:45] tiny minority had their names
[54:47] blotted out of the book of life
[54:50] see they came out they came out but the
[54:53] purpose of coming out was to go in
[54:55] so if you came out but don't go in you
[54:57] failed the purpose of god
[54:59] so the purpose was to come out and to go
[55:01] in but he said they're just
[55:03] carriers carrying the life all but just
[55:05] a tiny portion of what came out
[55:07] which we know was caleb and joshua all
[55:10] but a tiny portion they were just
[55:11] carrying the life
[55:12] for that next generation who would go in
[55:14] because they didn't go in they rejected
[55:16] the plan of god
[55:17] they rejected the prophet of god they
[55:19] turned to idols they turned to this they
[55:20] turned to that
[55:21] and they were killed they were dead
[55:23] jesus said dead he didn't say they sleep
[55:25] he said they're dead
[55:27] brother branham said eternally separated
[55:29] from god
[55:30] names removed from the book of life they
[55:33] were just there to support to bring
[55:35] what was really israel into the land
[55:45] third chapter or third yeah
[55:48] no paragraph we have the same right
[55:51] today in the church names are going to
[55:52] be blotted out of the book of life
[55:54] no names will be blotted out of the book
[55:56] of eternal life for that is another
[55:58] record
[55:58] though contained in the book of life
[56:00] this is the record god has given us
[56:02] eternal life and this life is in his son
[56:04] he that hath the son hath life
[56:08] period if you're in christ you have life
[56:13] your name can never be removed that's
[56:14] why the baptism of holy ghost is called
[56:16] a seal that will seal us to the day of
[56:17] redemption
[56:18] because you cannot come to that seal
[56:20] unless you're part of that life
[56:22] and if you're part of that life then you
[56:24] come through near birth into that seal
[56:26] that's why you can be sealed because
[56:27] there's names that can be removed from
[56:29] the book of life
[56:30] but not the names that can be sealed or
[56:32] not the names that can be removed
[56:34] it's a different part of the book of
[56:35] life altogether
[56:38] amen
[56:41] so he that hath the son
[56:45] this is the record god hath given us
[56:46] eternal life and this life is in his son
[56:49] he that hath the son hath life eternal
[56:51] and he that hath not the son hath not
[56:53] life
[56:54] eternal and those who have the life were
[56:57] in him before the foundation of the
[56:59] world
[56:59] they were chosen in him before the
[57:01] foundation of the world that great royal
[57:03] seed jesus christ was planted he died
[57:06] and that life that was in him came up
[57:07] through the wheat plant and is
[57:09] reproducing itself in multitudes of
[57:11] wheat seeds
[57:12] having the same life in them and being
[57:13] like the original
[57:15] because by spirit they are the original
[57:19] that's why he could seal the book before
[57:24] that's why god could put names in the
[57:26] book and he could he could have the lamb
[57:28] slain in his mind before or seal the
[57:29] names in the book
[57:30] before you made a choice because he knew
[57:33] where that life was
[57:34] he knew what the life was he knew where
[57:36] the life was and he knew where the life
[57:38] was going to come up at
[57:39] god's not guessing nothing god does is a
[57:41] guess
[57:45] you think he didn't know who was and who
[57:47] wasn't when they came out of egypt
[57:51] when they came out of egypt to mixed
[57:53] multitude do you think
[57:55] that he was worried that none would go
[57:58] in
[57:59] do you think he was worried about joshua
[58:01] and caleb or do you think he
[58:02] he really wanted a bunch of that first
[58:05] generation to come in but they just
[58:06] didn't see it they just didn't make it
[58:08] god knew he knew who would come out he
[58:11] knew he would fall away in the
[58:12] wilderness journey and he knew he'd go
[58:13] in
[58:14] because known unto god are all his works
[58:15] from before
[58:19] if we don't have god seated firmly on
[58:21] the throne and we don't have him as
[58:23] creator
[58:23] creator and sovereign over all things
[58:25] this gets really complicated
[58:28] but if we set god on the throne have him
[58:30] omniscient knowing all things from
[58:31] before the foundation of the world
[58:33] and giving him the right to choose then
[58:35] this is really really easy
[58:37] it just depends on what your perspective
[58:39] of god is
[58:42] last paragraph now we see why the
[58:45] redeemed
[58:46] bought back by original owner bride
[58:48] that's really important
[58:50] let's read that slowly now we can see
[58:52] why the redeemed who are redeemed
[58:55] the bought back by original owner who
[58:58] bought it back
[58:58] the original owner who did he buy back
[59:00] the bride
[59:02] who is the bride the redeemed that the
[59:04] original owner
[59:05] bought back hallelujah
[59:09] now we can see why the redeemed bought
[59:10] back by original owner bride
[59:13] she was in him as eve was in adam cannot
[59:17] ever have her
[59:18] member names taken off the record why
[59:20] because you were
[59:21] in him is christ going to lose part of
[59:25] himself
[59:27] you were in him before the foundation of
[59:29] the world that's why he could take that
[59:31] record of that which was in him which
[59:33] was going to be sewn into the earth
[59:34] which was going to come forth at
[59:35] different stages and times
[59:37] in different eras and in different
[59:38] places that's why he could record that
[59:40] that's why he could in his mind have the
[59:42] lamb slain from before the foundation of
[59:44] the world to redeem that back
[59:45] because he had to redeem it back because
[59:47] it's his
[59:48] he's not going to lose it hallelujah
[59:55] she is part of him she is in the throne
[59:58] she can never be judged
[59:59] everyone in the bride is a member of him
[1:00:01] and he loses none
[1:00:02] but that is not so concerning the all in
[1:00:04] the book of life for amongst them are
[1:00:06] even those like judas etc
[1:00:08] who have pardoned the record but their
[1:00:10] names were removed
[1:00:11] we can see those who come in the last
[1:00:13] days and after having done wonderful
[1:00:15] works jesus will say
[1:00:16] that he never knew them it is not that
[1:00:19] he was not aware of them his omniscience
[1:00:20] precludes that
[1:00:22] but they were not foreknown as in the
[1:00:23] bride and neither were they foreknown as
[1:00:25] amongst the righteous of the second
[1:00:27] resurrection
[1:00:28] they bore no fruit because they were
[1:00:30] outside the word
[1:00:31] did not abide in it and they therefore
[1:00:34] were sentenced to death
[1:00:35] then as we have previously shown there
[1:00:37] are those who stood for the bride
[1:00:39] and were an aide and a comfort to her
[1:00:41] those had their names remaining on the
[1:00:43] book of life and go
[1:00:44] into it into life everlasting finally
[1:00:47] there are those
[1:00:48] such as pharaoh who never had their
[1:00:49] names on the book of life and these are
[1:00:51] cast into the lake of fire also
[1:00:54] this is the last paragraph we're going
[1:00:56] to read thus the grain of wheat that
[1:00:57] became a plant for the harvest
[1:00:59] is the record of the church and even as
[1:01:01] not all the wheat plant is wheat seed
[1:01:03] and not all the plant is used in the
[1:01:05] harvest so with the church
[1:01:08] all the church is not the bride and
[1:01:09] neither is it all given eternal life
[1:01:12] but a part of is it is gathered into the
[1:01:13] garner and a part of it is kept that it
[1:01:16] might enter into light eternal life
[1:01:18] and in the second resurrection and part
[1:01:20] of it which is a counted chaff is burned
[1:01:22] in the lake of fire
[1:01:24] and this is exactly what john the
[1:01:25] baptist and jesus said
[1:01:27] for john said that the wheat would be
[1:01:28] garnered and the chaff burned
[1:01:30] and jesus said bind the tares and then
[1:01:32] gather the wheat
[1:01:33] the ecumenical move will bind the tear
[1:01:35] churches together for the tares must be
[1:01:37] bound first
[1:01:38] and though their end is burning they are
[1:01:40] not burned at their binding but are
[1:01:41] reserved to a
[1:01:42] later date which is at the end of the
[1:01:44] thousand years or the second
[1:01:45] resurrection
[1:01:46] but once the tares are bound the rapture
[1:01:48] can take place and does so
[1:01:50] at some time between the binding and the
[1:01:52] revelation of antichrist
[1:01:54] then will come the day when all stand
[1:01:56] together as seen in daniel the king will
[1:01:57] be there with his bride
[1:01:59] and in front of them will be the
[1:02:00] multitudes hard to be judged
[1:02:02] yes all are there all the books are
[1:02:04] opened a final disposition
[1:02:06] of all is made the harvest is indeed
[1:02:08] over the books once opened
[1:02:09] are closed see this analogy
[1:02:14] just makes it so much easier for me
[1:02:17] the book of life is the record of the
[1:02:18] entire plant but not the entire plant
[1:02:21] has eternal life or wheat seed right
[1:02:25] it's there to support the coming forth
[1:02:27] of the wheat seed
[1:02:28] the easiest way for me to explain this
[1:02:31] is take a look at what we have right now
[1:02:32] in israel and the situation we have
[1:02:34] right now in israel
[1:02:36] over in israel we've got a little over
[1:02:37] six million i believe it is six to eight
[1:02:39] million people
[1:02:40] i think six million of them are jews
[1:02:43] right now so if the bride would rapture
[1:02:47] right now today there would be six
[1:02:49] million jews in palestine
[1:02:52] and then when we rapture there would be
[1:02:54] two witnesses with the spirit of elijah
[1:02:56] and moses that would go
[1:02:57] and start preaching to those jews
[1:03:00] how many of them were elected seed
[1:03:04] 144 000 out of how many
[1:03:08] about 6 million and they're gathering in
[1:03:10] that maybe
[1:03:11] by the time that happens it may be 8
[1:03:12] million 10 million who knows how many
[1:03:14] million
[1:03:16] so there's only 144
[1:03:20] 000 of the elect
[1:03:24] only 144 000 will receive the message of
[1:03:27] those two prophets
[1:03:30] only 144 000 will live in the millennium
[1:03:32] with christ and the bride
[1:03:34] is that true so what about why
[1:03:38] what's the big deal why is god doing it
[1:03:40] like this why did
[1:03:42] god bring 2 million out of egypt only to
[1:03:45] have a handful go in with a second
[1:03:47] generation
[1:03:50] you know there was prophecies laid in
[1:03:53] this scripture
[1:03:54] about the return of the diaspora the
[1:03:56] returning of the nations and
[1:03:57] and israel coming into its place and its
[1:03:59] nation and and its people and all that
[1:04:01] and we're watching that fulfilled before
[1:04:03] our eyes we've taught on that and you've
[1:04:04] seen it
[1:04:06] 144 000 people can't do that
[1:04:10] 144 000 people can't build a country
[1:04:15] can't form an economy can't have a
[1:04:17] government
[1:04:18] can't have a military can't have all the
[1:04:21] things that you need to have an entire
[1:04:22] nation to fulfill the word
[1:04:24] you need a lot more than 144 000 but god
[1:04:28] knew that he was going to call 144 000
[1:04:31] but in order to get the 144 000 in the
[1:04:33] right place at the right time
[1:04:35] for the right message he had to have
[1:04:37] this support system
[1:04:38] that was going to build an economy that
[1:04:40] was going to build a government that was
[1:04:42] going to have a military that was going
[1:04:43] to offer protection that was going to
[1:04:45] have religious orders of the day and
[1:04:46] that was going to have spiritual
[1:04:47] teaching that was going to have all
[1:04:48] these things
[1:04:48] so that at the right time he could come
[1:04:50] down and call out his 144 000.
[1:04:54] the rest of them are not elect
[1:04:59] and if that hurts our feelings we just
[1:05:01] have to look at god sitting on a throne
[1:05:04] and say god are you just and are you
[1:05:05] right and is your word true
[1:05:07] so what about the rest they are the
[1:05:10] support
[1:05:11] system and we know
[1:05:16] that only the elect will be gathered
[1:05:17] into the garner
[1:05:19] but what about the rest of the record
[1:05:20] what's going to happen to them
[1:05:22] well if you want to know what's going to
[1:05:23] happen to them you have to go to white
[1:05:25] throne judgment
[1:05:26] and you have to go to matthew 25 the
[1:05:27] separating as the sheep and the goats
[1:05:30] and then you'll know what's going to
[1:05:31] happen to them and we're going to get
[1:05:32] into the judgment
[1:05:33] the great white throne judgment next
[1:05:35] week maybe wednesday or
[1:05:36] next week i don't know but the point is
[1:05:40] they're not all lost
[1:05:44] when you get to the white throne
[1:05:46] judgment some of them
[1:05:49] those whose names remain on the book
[1:05:50] those whose names are on the book of
[1:05:52] life
[1:05:52] go in to eternal life
[1:05:55] those whose names are not on the book
[1:05:59] they go to the lake of fire so it's not
[1:06:02] the end of the story
[1:06:03] so we live here in farm country we have
[1:06:05] wheat growing up right
[1:06:06] when we gather the wheat is the rest of
[1:06:08] the wheat plant thrown away
[1:06:11] no has anybody ever heard of straw
[1:06:15] this is what brother ben was talking
[1:06:17] about there's a portion of that wheat
[1:06:19] plant
[1:06:19] is the chaff and it's just blown to the
[1:06:21] wind it's just gone
[1:06:23] there's no hope for it it's burnt or
[1:06:25] it's it's got blown to the wind
[1:06:27] but the stalk that stalk is saved it has
[1:06:30] value still and it had a purpose what
[1:06:33] was the purpose of the stalk
[1:06:34] that grain would never dry if there was
[1:06:36] no stalk
[1:06:38] right it was important to the process
[1:06:40] and because it's important to the
[1:06:42] process
[1:06:43] god will give it a reward it will
[1:06:45] receive
[1:06:46] entrance into eternal life and be
[1:06:48] allowed to dwell
[1:06:49] in the new heavens and the new earth
[1:06:51] just like when the farmer goes out
[1:06:53] and he gathers his harvest he plants the
[1:06:55] seed and the purpose of planting the
[1:06:56] seed is to get seed
[1:06:58] right he's not planting wheat to get
[1:07:00] straw because straw doesn't bring the
[1:07:01] income that wheat does he would go
[1:07:03] bankrupt
[1:07:04] he plants wheat to get wheat but in the
[1:07:07] process of planting wheat
[1:07:08] he had this whole support system this
[1:07:10] whole plant that he needed that needed
[1:07:12] the whole plant
[1:07:13] to hold the hold it up to take care of
[1:07:15] photosynthesis to protect it from the
[1:07:16] wind
[1:07:17] all these things had to happen so that
[1:07:18] the sea could reproduce and
[1:07:20] some of that is the chaff blown in the
[1:07:22] wind or burned up with unquenchable fire
[1:07:24] but some of it is reserved
[1:07:29] and give an entrance into into the into
[1:07:32] the kingdom prepared for them from
[1:07:33] before the foundation of the world
[1:07:35] give an entrance into eternal life so
[1:07:38] it's not all lost
[1:07:40] everything that has its name on the book
[1:07:42] every name that's on the book
[1:07:44] will be in the new heavens and the new
[1:07:46] earth
[1:07:48] the one section is the section of
[1:07:50] eternal life
[1:07:51] or the record of the the seed the wheat
[1:07:53] coming forth
[1:07:55] the other record is the record of the
[1:07:56] support system that it takes
[1:07:58] to bring this seed forth and the support
[1:08:00] system as long as they don't do anything
[1:08:02] to get their name removed off the book
[1:08:04] they'll go in you want to talk about
[1:08:07] mercy
[1:08:08] that's mercy not part of christ from
[1:08:12] before the foundation of the world
[1:08:14] not in him not dead in christ not first
[1:08:17] resurrection not
[1:08:18] part of god from before the foundation
[1:08:20] of the world but yet
[1:08:22] because they served the purpose with
[1:08:24] which god purposed them for
[1:08:26] and because they did it faithfully and
[1:08:28] never rejected the bride never rejected
[1:08:30] the word and the coming forth of the
[1:08:31] word
[1:08:31] god in his infinite mercy
[1:08:36] gives them entrance into eternal life i
[1:08:39] love a god like that
[1:08:41] he'll go far beyond gathering his own
[1:08:43] harvest far beyond just going either his
[1:08:45] own children
[1:08:46] but anybody who is a support and a help
[1:08:48] and an aid
[1:08:49] to the coming forth of that life he will
[1:08:51] reward
[1:08:53] amen and i'm grateful for that
[1:09:08] let's look at this in church book
[1:09:11] page 272. we're just about finished here
[1:09:14] we're almost done
[1:09:17] 272 the very last paragraph in 272
[1:09:24] now i'm sure that you have noticed that
[1:09:26] those whose names were in the book of
[1:09:28] life
[1:09:28] were part of the religious order of that
[1:09:30] day that centered around the true god
[1:09:32] and worship of him
[1:09:34] though they did not worship according to
[1:09:35] truth or word
[1:09:37] like judas they didn't go all the way
[1:09:39] see how judas was chosen of god
[1:09:41] he was instructed in truth he shared of
[1:09:43] the mysteries
[1:09:44] he had a ministry of power granted unto
[1:09:46] him he healed the sick and cast out
[1:09:48] devils in jesus name
[1:09:50] but when the showdown came he sold out
[1:09:51] for gold and political power
[1:09:53] he did not go up to pentecost to receive
[1:09:55] the spirit of god he was devoid of the
[1:09:57] spirit
[1:09:58] make no mistake about it a person that
[1:10:00] is truly baptized by the holy ghost into
[1:10:02] the body of christ
[1:10:03] receiving the fullness of the spirit
[1:10:05] will be in the word
[1:10:06] all the way amen
[1:10:10] that is the evidence of being baptized
[1:10:13] with the holy ghost
[1:10:15] that's why if you believe that you have
[1:10:17] the baptism of holy ghost
[1:10:18] but you can see the word and brother
[1:10:20] brennan will bring a revelation of the
[1:10:21] word and
[1:10:21] it'll bring it out and it just doesn't
[1:10:23] suit your taste or you just don't like
[1:10:24] it or you have a different opinion
[1:10:26] or you don't you don't want to go that
[1:10:27] way that's not clear evidence that you
[1:10:30] received the baptism of holy ghost it's
[1:10:31] time
[1:10:32] to get down on your knees and say lord
[1:10:34] do i really have it because i'm having
[1:10:36] a hard time fulfilling your word i'm
[1:10:37] having a hard time believing your word
[1:10:42] amen
[1:10:44] that's why god came and restored his
[1:10:45] word
[1:10:47] full word full life
[1:10:51] when the word was restored in fullness
[1:10:53] now the life of christ could come back
[1:10:55] in fullness on the believer
[1:10:57] amen that's why once the full word is
[1:11:00] revealed
[1:11:00] you know when you have partial word you
[1:11:02] can accept partial word and receive the
[1:11:04] baptism holy ghost
[1:11:07] they did it luther's day they did it in
[1:11:08] wesley's day they did it in every day
[1:11:11] if there's only partial word available
[1:11:13] partial believing the partial word will
[1:11:15] will give you a a seal a seal until your
[1:11:18] day of redemption of the baptism holy
[1:11:19] ghost
[1:11:20] but once the full word has been revealed
[1:11:22] partial word won't work anymore
[1:11:26] because now full word gives us access to
[1:11:28] full life
[1:11:29] and because full life is available it
[1:11:31] requires accepting full word to access
[1:11:34] full life the partial word won't work
[1:11:37] anymore
[1:11:39] that's why when god came down and christ
[1:11:41] came down and opened the seven seals
[1:11:43] now it's a full manifestation of the
[1:11:45] revelations that's been sealed in the
[1:11:47] book
[1:11:47] that's been hid in the new testament and
[1:11:49] now that's been clearly unveiled before
[1:11:51] our eyes
[1:11:52] and now a partial or a pentecost or a
[1:11:54] wesleyan or a lutheran
[1:11:56] accepting of truth is not going to work
[1:11:58] anymore
[1:12:00] that's why he says have no doubt about
[1:12:02] it those that are really the wheat seed
[1:12:04] those that are the german predestinated
[1:12:06] germ of eternal life
[1:12:07] they will receive all the word they will
[1:12:09] be in in the word
[1:12:10] all the way partial there's no more time
[1:12:14] for partial
[1:12:15] brother branham said in the most message
[1:12:17] token he said in luther's day you had
[1:12:19] the lamb
[1:12:21] and in wesley's day you had the lamb but
[1:12:24] today
[1:12:25] we have the life
[1:12:28] you have to receive the life full word
[1:12:32] full life amen
[1:12:41] all right let's read one
[1:12:44] one more section out of here
[1:12:50] and this will set us up for next time
[1:12:53] 276.
[1:13:01] we're going to start second paragraph
[1:13:02] which is middle of the page
[1:13:06] the question now arises why are these
[1:13:08] righteous ones in the judgment
[1:13:10] so when you go to matthew 25 and you go
[1:13:13] to revelations 20 at the white throne
[1:13:14] judgment
[1:13:15] you see some were considered righteous
[1:13:17] and some are considered unrighteous
[1:13:19] and so now he's going to answer the
[1:13:20] question why are these righteous ones in
[1:13:22] judgment
[1:13:24] because we know the bride's not in
[1:13:25] judgment right the bride's present but
[1:13:27] the bride's not being judged
[1:13:29] and we'll get into that next week the
[1:13:31] question now arises why are these
[1:13:33] righteous ones in the judgment
[1:13:35] there is no other place that they can
[1:13:36] come up for there are but two
[1:13:38] resurrections
[1:13:40] that's pretty easy if you didn't make
[1:13:42] the first resurrection and only those
[1:13:44] that are in christ
[1:13:46] that were in him from before the
[1:13:47] foundation of the world that were sealed
[1:13:48] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:13:50] they're the only ones going in the first
[1:13:51] resurrection everyone
[1:13:53] else must wait for the second
[1:13:56] resurrection
[1:13:58] but there are but two resurrections and
[1:13:59] since they could not qualify
[1:14:01] for the first resurrection they must
[1:14:04] come up in the second which is a
[1:14:05] resurrection
[1:14:06] unto judgment the ones who qualify for
[1:14:09] the first resurrection the bride are not
[1:14:11] in the judgment john 5 24 says verily
[1:14:14] verily i say unto you he that heareth my
[1:14:16] word
[1:14:16] and believeth on him that sent me half
[1:14:18] everlasting life
[1:14:20] that is the believer is already the
[1:14:22] recipient of eternal life
[1:14:23] which he has in his possession now and
[1:14:26] shall not come into condemnation
[1:14:29] shall not come into the judgment is what
[1:14:31] it really says
[1:14:32] but is passed permanently from death
[1:14:35] unto life
[1:14:36] but notice carefully jesus must have yet
[1:14:38] another group in mind
[1:14:39] who at a certain resurrection will
[1:14:41] receive eternal life
[1:14:43] they will receive it at the resurrection
[1:14:45] not having previously received it
[1:14:47] as a member of the bride john 5 28 29
[1:14:50] marvel not at this for the hours coming
[1:14:52] in which all
[1:14:53] that are in the graves shall hear his
[1:14:55] voice and shall come forth
[1:14:57] they that have done good unto the
[1:14:59] resurrection of life and they that have
[1:15:01] done evil unto the resurrection of
[1:15:02] damnation
[1:15:04] now we all know that john 5 28 29 is not
[1:15:07] the rapture
[1:15:07] for only the dead in christ will arise
[1:15:10] from the graves at the time
[1:15:11] along with the living bride who is still
[1:15:13] on the earth first thessalonians 4 16
[1:15:16] says for the lord himself shall descend
[1:15:18] from heaven with a shout
[1:15:19] with the voice of the archangel with the
[1:15:21] trump of god
[1:15:22] and the dead and christ shall rise first
[1:15:24] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:15:26] be caught up together with them in the
[1:15:27] clouds
[1:15:28] to meet the lord in the air and so shall
[1:15:30] we ever be with the lord
[1:15:32] but it says in john 5 28 29 that all are
[1:15:35] going to come forth from the grave
[1:15:36] this is the very same resurrection that
[1:15:38] is spoken of in revelations 20
[1:15:40] 11-15 wherein the dead were brought
[1:15:44] before the lord and judged according to
[1:15:46] the works
[1:15:46] and all whose names were not in the book
[1:15:48] of life were then cast into the lake of
[1:15:50] fire
[1:15:51] see where he puts the dead in all
[1:15:53] capitals here
[1:15:54] because they don't already have eternal
[1:15:56] life they are going to
[1:15:58] a portion of them are going to receive
[1:16:01] eternal life
[1:16:02] or receive entrance into eternal life
[1:16:06] but they don't already have it because
[1:16:08] they don't already have it
[1:16:09] they are called dead
[1:16:12] that's why when a saint goes to sleep
[1:16:16] they're not dead
[1:16:19] amen you know what if the lord should
[1:16:22] tarry
[1:16:23] and i shouldn't make it all the way to
[1:16:25] the rapture and they have to bury me out
[1:16:27] here somewhere
[1:16:28] don't ever put on my tombstone that i
[1:16:32] died
[1:16:35] see right here
[1:16:38] the body of chad lamb is asleep
[1:16:42] because i can't die
[1:16:48] i cannot die jesus is looking at his
[1:16:51] disciples
[1:16:52] and say you know if you believe on me
[1:16:54] you should never die
[1:16:57] every one of them died
[1:17:01] right every one of them in the natural
[1:17:03] life
[1:17:04] died and jesus was telling him you can't
[1:17:06] die he said neither shall anything harm
[1:17:08] ye
[1:17:10] do you know how some of them died
[1:17:13] neither shall anything harm thee he's
[1:17:15] not talking about the natural life the
[1:17:17] natural life has nothing to do with it
[1:17:19] he's talking about the spiritual life
[1:17:21] nothing can harm thee you can never be
[1:17:23] separated from god
[1:17:24] you can never die
[1:17:27] oh hallelujah which part of the book are
[1:17:29] you in
[1:17:30] where do you see yourself in that you
[1:17:32] know i i'm so grateful
[1:17:35] that i believe beyond a shadow of a
[1:17:36] doubt that i'm in the portion of the
[1:17:38] eternal life record
[1:17:39] and my name no matter what filthy vile
[1:17:41] nasty thing i would do tomorrow
[1:17:42] my name can't be taken out of that book
[1:17:45] why because i was part of him before the
[1:17:47] foundation of the world why what token
[1:17:49] what evidence
[1:17:49] because i want to eat every part of
[1:17:51] christ
[1:17:53] i want to there's a desire in me not
[1:17:55] from my flesh not from my mind but a
[1:17:57] desire in me
[1:17:57] that i want every part of christ i want
[1:18:00] to take it in i want to enjoy it i want
[1:18:02] to eat it
[1:18:03] hallelujah why because it's who i am
[1:18:07] i came out from him now when you show
[1:18:10] him to me
[1:18:11] i'm going to go into him that's what the
[1:18:14] message of the hour is
[1:18:15] it's christ an expose
[1:18:18] it's christ it's jesus christ exposed to
[1:18:21] your very eyes
[1:18:22] and if you came out from christ and you
[1:18:24] were part of christ
[1:18:25] when you see christ exposed you want
[1:18:28] christ
[1:18:29] that's why the message of the hour is
[1:18:31] not a challenge it's not hard it's not
[1:18:33] i can barely believe it all i wish i
[1:18:35] could not if you were in him from before
[1:18:36] the foundation of the world
[1:18:38] you might struggle at first because it's
[1:18:40] different than your thinking your mind
[1:18:41] but in the inside oh my i came out from
[1:18:45] him
[1:18:45] there he is i'm going into him amen
[1:18:50] that's consolation to me god has been
[1:18:53] good to us
[1:18:57] amen i told you i'd get you out early
[1:19:02] i will let's stand we want to make sure
[1:19:05] we beat the bad weather
[1:19:07] musicians if you could come as they're
[1:19:09] coming i'll just
[1:19:10] share a little story the other day i was
[1:19:12] listening to a message i think it was
[1:19:14] invisible union of the bride in christ
[1:19:15] i'm not quite sure on that
[1:19:17] i may have that a little bit wrong
[1:19:20] but he was talking about the story
[1:19:23] of the chicken or the the chicken that
[1:19:25] hatched out the eagle in the nest and
[1:19:27] the eagle that was born in the chicken
[1:19:29] with the chickens and he's out there and
[1:19:31] he's an odd chicken and nothing's going
[1:19:32] right and he can't eat like the rest of
[1:19:34] he doesn't like what they like but he
[1:19:35] doesn't know what else to do
[1:19:36] he just thinks he's a chicken he just
[1:19:38] thinks he's a bad chicken
[1:19:40] and he's typing it with a denominational
[1:19:42] believer and when when one of these
[1:19:44] seed of god elect seed of gods you know
[1:19:45] they're in these churches and they're
[1:19:47] trying to do what they think is right
[1:19:48] and being zealous and all that
[1:19:50] but he says one day another eagle flew
[1:19:53] over and screamed and something inside
[1:19:55] of him quivered
[1:19:57] that sounded right he heard cluck cluck
[1:20:00] and cock-a-doodle-doo and that wasn't it
[1:20:02] but when he heard that scream from the
[1:20:04] eagle something said that's it
[1:20:06] he didn't have to be taught he didn't
[1:20:08] have to have verses explained to him
[1:20:10] when it screamed he identified with the
[1:20:12] scream
[1:20:13] right and the the
[1:20:16] the eagle didn't have to water down the
[1:20:18] scream to attract the eagle
[1:20:20] and the eagle didn't have to kind of
[1:20:22] halfway sound like a chicken and halfway
[1:20:24] sound like an eagle so i wouldn't scare
[1:20:25] away the eagle
[1:20:26] the eagle screamed and the eagle liked
[1:20:28] it
[1:20:29] and the same thing's true today if we
[1:20:31] want to attract eagles we've got to
[1:20:32] scream like an eagle
[1:20:33] we've got to say what the eagle said
[1:20:35] what the eagle ministry is not something
[1:20:37] halfway in between
[1:20:39] amen eagles are attracted by an eagle
[1:20:42] scream
[1:20:43] and so i've always listened to this
[1:20:44] story and i've always enjoyed it because
[1:20:46] i've always put myself
[1:20:47] in the perspective of the eagle in the
[1:20:49] chicken yard
[1:20:51] you've been there too right but this
[1:20:53] time when i listened to it it struck me
[1:20:55] different
[1:20:56] i caught the perspective of the mother
[1:20:58] eagle
[1:21:00] and brother branham said that mother
[1:21:02] eagle knew
[1:21:04] she laid two eggs
[1:21:10] she wasn't hoping she wasn't wondering
[1:21:12] if there was another eagle out there
[1:21:14] somewhere
[1:21:15] she wasn't wishing that i just had more
[1:21:17] seed if i had more family
[1:21:19] she knew by foreknowledge
[1:21:22] she knew that there was two eggs
[1:21:27] and god knows exactly how many seed
[1:21:31] there are
[1:21:34] that little eagle never went looking
[1:21:37] for his identification
[1:21:41] he was in the barnyard as far as he knew
[1:21:43] he'd have been in barnyard
[1:21:44] the rest of his life but brother branham
[1:21:47] said that mother eagle
[1:21:48] went hunting for that other baby
[1:21:52] because she knew it was on the earth
[1:21:55] hallelujah
[1:21:56] it wasn't us who were seeking out god
[1:21:59] it's not us one day decided i don't fit
[1:22:01] in here i'm going to go and i'm going to
[1:22:02] find an eagle scream somewhere and i'm
[1:22:04] going to climb on high
[1:22:05] we had no idea what we were we had no
[1:22:07] idea what god's plan was for us
[1:22:09] we had no idea why none of this fit us
[1:22:11] until god
[1:22:12] came hunting for us because he knew
[1:22:16] that he had more eggs he knew that there
[1:22:19] was more seed
[1:22:20] and because he knew there was he went
[1:22:22] hunting for us
[1:22:23] and then we heard the eagle scream and
[1:22:25] something inside said
[1:22:26] oh my what do i do
[1:22:30] and the mother eagle said just jump and
[1:22:32] flap your wings i'll take over from
[1:22:33] there
[1:22:35] hallelujah we look at this and we say
[1:22:40] but you know there's only so many in
[1:22:42] this book and there's so many in this
[1:22:43] book and
[1:22:44] what about what about so and so and
[1:22:46] every time you start talking about
[1:22:48] god's right to choose and predestination
[1:22:50] and the election
[1:22:51] and the eternal seed of god and those
[1:22:53] that are in the book that can be removed
[1:22:54] and
[1:22:55] and those what about the person in the
[1:22:57] jungle and the thing and the thing and
[1:22:59] the thing and
[1:23:00] what about so-and-so is raised here
[1:23:01] never heard this and only heard that or
[1:23:03] had a bad experience what about what
[1:23:05] about what about
[1:23:07] is god god or is god a man
[1:23:11] and if that mother eagle knew that she
[1:23:12] laid two eggs and she was so inspired by
[1:23:15] the knowledge she had two eggs that it
[1:23:16] would send her out hunting for that
[1:23:18] other egg
[1:23:18] what about god who knows where his
[1:23:21] children are
[1:23:22] he knows how many he's going to have he
[1:23:24] knows when they're going to come forth
[1:23:26] and he knows we're going to go to land
[1:23:28] and it's god's responsibility to find
[1:23:30] his seed
[1:23:31] it's not the seed's responsibility to
[1:23:33] find god
[1:23:36] see if we could just let god be god
[1:23:40] if we could just let him be perfect wise
[1:23:44] infinite righteous holy just
[1:23:47] if we could just let him be all of those
[1:23:48] things and quit using our brain about
[1:23:50] all the possible scenarios of who heard
[1:23:52] what
[1:23:53] and then this this and the wrong this
[1:23:54] and a jungle pygmy in the jungle in
[1:23:56] africa
[1:23:57] god's got it all in control he knows
[1:24:01] exactly what he's doing
[1:24:03] we just have to let god be god
[1:24:07] and how many are you thankful that god
[1:24:09] is god
[1:24:10] and he knew where you were hiding out
[1:24:14] under a bush somewhere
[1:24:16] it wasn't adam went looking for god it
[1:24:18] was god came looking for adam when he
[1:24:20] was hiding out in the trees in the
[1:24:21] bushes
[1:24:22] trying to cover himself and hide himself
[1:24:25] we were hiding out in our bush somewhere
[1:24:27] in a little shack or shiny somewhere or
[1:24:29] up in a mountain or over in a hall or
[1:24:31] down in the woods or wherever we were
[1:24:33] he came hunting for his seed
[1:24:37] hallelujah and we heard the eagle scream
[1:24:41] hallelujah i just pray that god will use
[1:24:44] me
[1:24:45] to hunt the rest of his seed that i can
[1:24:48] be an instrument in his hand
[1:24:50] for spreading this message and screaming
[1:24:52] out the last day message
[1:24:54] screaming out pure and true and
[1:24:56] unadulterated and uncompromising and
[1:24:58] unwavering just say it
[1:25:00] say what the prophet said
[1:25:04] because if there's eagles out there
[1:25:06] that's what they'll be attracted to
[1:25:09] not scream cluck scream cluck no
[1:25:12] just the scream of the eagle is all that
[1:25:14] they want to hear
[1:25:16] amen let's just pray dear heavenly
[1:25:19] father we thank you lord for your word
[1:25:22] your word has been so good and so true
[1:25:24] and we just asked lord that you would
[1:25:25] just
[1:25:26] reveal it to us in a greater way let us
[1:25:28] really see our portion lord and what
[1:25:30] we're here for
[1:25:31] what you've called us to god let us be
[1:25:34] positionally placed in this body

[1:26:13] i don't know about you i'm not a chicken
[1:26:17] i can fly and one of these days
[1:26:20] i'm going to find out what these wings
[1:26:22] of faith are really all about
[1:26:24] it's not about feeling better on this
[1:26:26] earth it's not about claiming my healing
[1:26:28] or
[1:26:28] it's not about these situations what
[1:26:30] these wings of faith really are for
[1:26:32] is for a rapture and one of these days
[1:26:35] i'm going to set these wings and figure
[1:26:36] out
[1:26:37] what these big old wings are actually
[1:26:38] for and i'm going to fly away
[1:26:41] let's start that some
[1:26:44] glad morning when this life is
[1:26:51] [Music]
[1:27:00] [Music]
[1:27:02] god
[1:27:12] [Music]
[1:27:14] before i die hallelujah
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:27] of this life has grown out
[1:27:34] [Music]
[1:27:54] [Music]
[1:28:12] away to
[1:28:16] a land where joy shall never end
[1:28:19] oh i'll fly away
[1:28:25] i'll
[1:28:40] i
[1:28:44] amen let's put a correction on that song
[1:28:49] brother jim can you bring up the chorus
[1:28:51] again
[1:28:53] it says before i die we have no
[1:28:55] guarantee of that
[1:28:57] we have no guarantee that some of us
[1:28:59] won't be here then we might be in the
[1:29:01] grave the day the resurrection takes
[1:29:02] place we don't know
[1:29:04] but one thing we know for sure is i
[1:29:06] can't die
[1:29:09] i might sleep but i can't
[1:29:12] die brother jim if you can change that
[1:29:15] fast we'll change it we'll sing it right
[1:29:20] according to the revelation of the hour
[1:29:22] no matter what happens in this life
[1:29:24] persecution troubles my own failures my
[1:29:27] own faults
[1:29:29] disgrace honor joy
[1:29:32] wealth poverty it doesn't matter i
[1:29:36] can't die why
[1:29:40] because i hath already eternal life
[1:29:44] when did i get it eternal life doesn't
[1:29:47] start
[1:29:48] i got it before the foundation of the
[1:29:50] world when i was in him
[1:29:53] and because my existence comes from
[1:29:55] before space and time
[1:30:00] i had a life i have a life within me
[1:30:03] that goes all the way out back before
[1:30:06] space and before time
[1:30:08] that's eternal life and though
[1:30:11] time and space fall away guess what i
[1:30:14] still have
[1:30:15] that same life and that's why it has
[1:30:18] nothing to do with merit
[1:30:20] conduct nothing to do with intelligence
[1:30:22] thank god
[1:30:23] all it has to do with is where was i
[1:30:26] before the foundation of the world
[1:30:28] that's what matters most and if i had
[1:30:30] representation in christ then
[1:30:32] then i can't die
[1:30:37] you see why god had to come to paul the
[1:30:39] apostle
[1:30:41] on the road to emmaus because paul was
[1:30:44] doing things he was being rotten really
[1:30:47] when he was saul
[1:30:48] he was a bad guy is i'm gonna tell him
[1:30:51] the truth
[1:30:52] he was rotten he was persecuting the
[1:30:54] christians he was hauling him in the
[1:30:55] jail
[1:30:56] he was doing all these things and you
[1:30:57] know for that for doing that
[1:31:00] god would have to remove his name from
[1:31:02] the book because he was fighting against
[1:31:04] the bride he was fighting against the
[1:31:06] truth only there was a problem with saul
[1:31:10] he wasn't part of the book where your
[1:31:12] name could be removed
[1:31:14] his name was written on the part of the
[1:31:16] book where your name couldn't be removed
[1:31:19] and so although he deserved to have his
[1:31:21] name blotted out
[1:31:23] he happened to wind up in the portion of
[1:31:24] the of the book of life
[1:31:26] where god could not wipe his name out
[1:31:29] that's why there was a lot of people
[1:31:31] rejecting the christians in that day
[1:31:33] there was a lot of people doing what saw
[1:31:35] what paul was doing
[1:31:36] hauling them into jail persecuting them
[1:31:38] running them from city city studying
[1:31:39] them
[1:31:40] but god didn't care about them he just
[1:31:42] blotted their name off the book
[1:31:43] but god had an obligation to the one who
[1:31:45] his name was on the book of life
[1:31:47] who could not be blotted out so god came
[1:31:50] down
[1:31:51] and personally revealed himself to paul
[1:31:54] [Music]
[1:31:56] because paul can't die
[1:32:00] paul couldn't go to the lake of fire
[1:32:02] paul couldn't have his name removed from
[1:32:04] the book
[1:32:05] so god came down you know the first time
[1:32:08] i heard this message i didn't love it so
[1:32:09] much
[1:32:10] and i didn't say all nice things about
[1:32:12] it
[1:32:12] [Music]
[1:32:15] and if i would resist the truth if i
[1:32:17] would resist god
[1:32:18] if i would resist christ being made
[1:32:20] manifest god would write strike my name
[1:32:22] from all the book of life
[1:32:24] but but
[1:32:28] my name's not on that part of the book
[1:32:30] of life
[1:32:31] my name's on the part of the book of
[1:32:33] life that he can't erase
[1:32:35] and so god was obligated to come down
[1:32:37] and reveal himself to me
[1:32:39] personally amen
[1:32:42] how many are thankful for the
[1:32:43] predestination of god for the election
[1:32:46] of god
[1:32:47] let's sing this the right way and you
[1:32:49] can be dismissed as we sing this
[1:32:50] let's start
[1:32:54] fly away o glory

[1:35:53] pointing souls to calvary to the crimson
[1:35:57] flow
[1:35:58] many arrows pierce my soul from without
[1:36:01] within
[1:36:03] but my lord leads me on through him
[1:36:06] i must win oh i want to see
[1:36:10] him look upon his face

[1:36:36] give me life for
[1:36:38] satan snares may vex my soul turn my

[1:36:54] forever
