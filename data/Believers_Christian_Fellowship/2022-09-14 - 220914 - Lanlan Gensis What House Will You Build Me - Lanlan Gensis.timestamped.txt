[18:44] it's a
[18:46] nice to be back here in BCF
[18:51] it's always my
[18:53] my longing and I cannot afford not to
[18:57] come to visit when I come to the United
[18:58] States
[19:00] and uh to see and to meet and have
[19:04] fellowship with the
[19:06] brothers and sisters and
[19:11] with the friends
[19:14] and uh
[19:16] but yesterday while
[19:18] [Music]
[19:20] uh
[19:21] and I got a message from Brother Kyle
[19:25] and asking me when am I going to to come
[19:29] and I was so happy
[19:31] but when uh
[19:34] he talked to me
[19:37] yesterday evening
[19:40] that I'm going to to preach
[19:44] it seems that I I changed my mind
[19:49] and I feel so nervous especially when
[19:52] brother Jada
[19:55] when he called me and uh
[20:00] just pray for me
[20:02] Hallelujah
[20:03] and while we will remain standing
[20:07] let us open our Bible in the book of
[20:14] First Kings
[20:16] chapter 6.
[20:19] verse 7.
[20:28] it says
[20:30] and the house when it was in building
[20:32] was built of stone made ready before it
[20:36] was brought lighter so that there was
[20:38] neither Hammer nor ax nor any tall of
[20:42] iron heard in the house while it was in
[20:44] building
[20:47] and uh another scripture in the book of
[20:49] Acts chapter 7
[20:52] and beginning at verse 47
[20:57] it says but Solomon built him and house
[21:01] albeit the most high dwilleth not in
[21:04] temples made with hands as said the
[21:07] prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is
[21:10] my footstool what house will you build
[21:13] me saith the Lord or what is the place
[21:16] of my rest
[21:17] may the Lord a blessing upon the reading
[21:19] of his word you may be seated in the
[21:21] presence of the Lord
[21:24] and uh in behalf of my
[21:27] Church in kalbayog City the island of
[21:30] Samar Philippines I
[21:33] I bring greetings
[21:36] Hallelujah
[21:38] and uh
[21:40] tonight I would like to
[21:44] title my message
[21:48] what house will you build me
[21:52] what house will you build me
[21:56] Hallelujah it was uh David one time
[22:02] maybe he was relaxing in his house
[22:07] and uh
[22:11] enjoying Alleluia
[22:14] in his Palace
[22:17] in this beautiful palace made with
[22:20] Cedars and everything
[22:23] and one day maybe he looked down and uh
[22:28] he saw the Ark of God dwelling just in
[22:32] curtains
[22:34] and
[22:35] he decided to build a house for the Lord
[22:39] Alleluia in second Samuel chapter 7
[22:43] beginning at verse 1 he says and it came
[22:46] to pass when the when the king sat in
[22:48] his house and the Lord had given him
[22:51] rest round about from all his enemies
[22:54] that the king said unto Nathan the
[22:57] prophet
[22:57] see now I dwell in an House of Cedar but
[23:01] the Ark of God dwelleth in within
[23:04] curtains
[23:05] and Nathan said to the king go do all
[23:09] that is in thine heart for the Lord is
[23:11] with thee
[23:12] and it came to pass through that uh
[23:15] it came to pass that night that the word
[23:17] of the Lord came unto Nation saying go
[23:20] tell my servant David that says the Lord
[23:24] shalt thou build me and house for me to
[23:27] dwell in
[23:30] verse 8 now therefore so shall thou say
[23:33] unto my servant David that saith the
[23:36] Lord of hosts I took thee from the sheep
[23:39] goat from following the ship to be ruler
[23:42] Over My People Israel Over My over my
[23:45] people over Israel and I was with thee
[23:48] with us so ever the winters and have cut
[23:52] off all thine enemies out of thy side
[23:54] and have made thee a great name like
[23:57] unto the name of the great men that are
[24:00] in there
[24:02] Hallelujah
[24:04] it is his desire
[24:06] to help God
[24:09] to build a house for his God
[24:13] and it is a good thing
[24:17] to
[24:18] make plans and to have desire to do
[24:22] things for God
[24:23] and being a human or it's a human nature
[24:31] to make plans for the work of the Lord
[24:35] but brothers and sisters
[24:37] we need to consult God first we need to
[24:41] seek his perfect will
[24:44] and in this particular
[24:46] ah
[24:51] David one time he was he thought of
[24:55] helping God
[24:57] Hallelujah
[25:01] God is pitiful he is uh he is just
[25:03] billing in the curtains well I am
[25:07] Hallelujah dwelling in a house made with
[25:10] sedans
[25:11] but God said I don't need your help
[25:14] David
[25:15] you are the one who need my help
[25:17] Hallelujah maybe you are thinking how
[25:21] great you are
[25:22] being a man of Valor
[25:26] and uh Hallelujah and he became
[25:30] successful in everything
[25:31] Hallelujah but God said it is not you
[25:36] David
[25:37] it is me Hallelujah it is it is not the
[25:41] I am the one who fought for you
[25:43] Hallelujah and you are just my my
[25:46] instrument
[25:47] I am he says hallelujah and I was with
[25:51] thee with her so ever the winters and I
[25:55] Hallelujah have cut off all the enemies
[25:58] it was not your David
[26:00] Hallelujah
[26:01] and uh
[26:04] and he said what house are you going to
[26:07] build me
[26:09] you are planning you are
[26:11] thinking
[26:13] to to build a house
[26:16] in order for me to live it to live in
[26:20] Hallelujah in Isaiah chapter 66 verse 1
[26:23] he says
[26:25] that says the Lord the heaven is my
[26:27] throne and there is my foot soul
[26:30] where is the house that he built unto me
[26:33] and where is the place of my rest
[26:36] okay David
[26:38] you are planning to build a house for me
[26:42] and imagine
[26:44] how big would be that house that you are
[26:46] going to build me
[26:49] Heaven is my throne
[26:52] and Earth is my footstool
[26:54] where I'm just sitting down it is
[26:57] already heaven
[26:59] and how about if I will stand
[27:02] so imagine how big would be that house
[27:05] that you are planning to build for me
[27:08] Hallelujah
[27:10] but you see brothers and sisters
[27:13] uh
[27:14] but God promised to David that uh
[27:20] he said
[27:22] the son of David he shall build he said
[27:26] he he shall build a house for my name
[27:30] Hallelujah
[27:31] and uh he did not allow David though to
[27:35] build the house for the Lord because uh
[27:38] his hand shed a lot of blood Allelujah
[27:41] and in second Samuel chapter 7
[27:45] verses uh
[27:46] 12 and 13 He said and when they days be
[27:50] fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy
[27:52] fathers I will set up thy seed after
[27:55] thee which shall proceed out of thy
[27:58] bowels and I will establish his kingdom
[28:02] he shall build an house for my name and
[28:05] I will establish the Throne of his
[28:08] kingdom forever
[28:11] out of thy bowels
[28:13] there would be a seed coming
[28:16] Allelujah and he shall build a house for
[28:21] my name
[28:22] and I will establish the Throne of his
[28:24] kingdom forever
[28:27] and I believe brothers and sisters if
[28:29] God will promise something
[28:33] God will not fail Hallelujah to do God
[28:38] will not fail to fulfill his promise
[28:41] I will establish the Throne of his
[28:43] kingdom
[28:45] and I believe brothers and sisters that
[28:47] this verse does not speak to the Natural
[28:51] seed of David which was Solomon because
[28:54] if we read the Bible in First Kings
[28:57] chapter 11 Hallelujah that uh God he
[29:01] said that I will Rend
[29:04] thy kingdom
[29:07] Hallelujah
[29:10] he will not promise that he is going to
[29:13] establish and then he will uh take back
[29:16] his promise
[29:18] I will establish the Throne of his
[29:20] kingdom and then I will rent it
[29:22] Allelujah First Kings chapter 11 31 and
[29:26] 32 and he said to jeroboam take the ten
[29:31] pieces 10 pieces for that says the Lord
[29:33] the god of Israel behold I will reign
[29:36] the kingdom out of the head of Solomon
[29:38] and will give them tribes
[29:41] to thee
[29:42] but he shall have one tribe for my
[29:45] servant David's sake for and for
[29:48] Jerusalem sake the city which I have
[29:50] chosen out of the tribes of Israel and
[29:54] if you read the first Kings chapter 12
[29:56] that the kingdom was divided Allelujah
[30:00] and
[30:01] he reigned Judah and jeroboam reigned
[30:05] the rest of the tribes of Israel
[30:08] what house are you going to build unto
[30:10] me and where is the place of my rest
[30:13] Hallelujah the scripture that we read in
[30:17] Acts chapter 7 from verse 47 to 49
[30:21] Allelujah but Solomon built him and
[30:23] house
[30:24] how be it the most high dwell it not in
[30:28] temples made with hands as says the
[30:30] prophet
[30:31] so Solomon built him and house but God
[30:35] does not dwell in a house made with
[30:38] hands Allelujah but the temple that
[30:42] Solomon built it only speaks or it it is
[30:47] only a type of the spiritual Temple that
[30:51] God is going to build for him
[30:54] Hallelujah
[30:56] because uh God will not do anything
[30:59] unless he he spoke it first Hallelujah
[31:03] by the law and by Psalms and by the
[31:07] prophets
[31:08] like for example we have
[31:10] Elijah in this last days
[31:14] Hallelujah but before he fulfilled
[31:16] Hallelujah that that uh that thing he
[31:20] already had spoken it
[31:24] long ago
[31:25] Hallelujah because God will not do
[31:28] anything unless he had spoken it first
[31:31] just like the flood during the time of
[31:34] Noah Hallelujah Before the Flood came
[31:36] Noah had been telling the people had
[31:39] been uh he had been uh preaching about
[31:43] the coming flood because God will not do
[31:45] anything the prophet said ah
[31:50] he will uh he will not do anything
[31:54] unless he had spoken it first just like
[31:56] uh the time in when the Messiah was
[31:59] coming
[32:00] Allelujah
[32:01] and the Bible said and all the prophets
[32:05] the law and the prophets Hallelujah had
[32:07] spoken about the coming Messiah
[32:09] even the lives of the of the of the
[32:13] prophet in the Old Testament like for
[32:15] example the life of Joseph
[32:17] Hallelujah everything that happened in
[32:20] in the life of Joseph was was speaking
[32:23] Hallelujah concerning the coming Messiah
[32:26] he was hated by his Brethren but he was
[32:29] loved by the father
[32:31] Allelujah he was thrown into a pit and
[32:34] declared he was dead Alleluia and Jesus
[32:37] Christ
[32:37] Allelujah he was uh put into into the
[32:41] tomb and declared dead but after three
[32:45] days
[32:46] Hallelujah he was alive
[32:48] and everything Hallelujah he got a
[32:50] gentle bride Jesus Christ he he got a
[32:52] gentle bride
[32:54] everything in the Old Testament
[32:56] Allelujah or God will not do anything
[32:59] unless he had spoken it first by the law
[33:03] by Psalms and by the prophets so
[33:07] God hallelujah he will have a Dwelling
[33:11] Place
[33:14] and Solomon built him a temple
[33:17] and that's only a type of the dwelling
[33:20] place that God is going to have
[33:23] but God
[33:24] doesn't dwell in a temple made with
[33:27] hands
[33:30] in Isaiah chapter 66
[33:33] verses 1 and 2.
[33:37] it is God himself who had this Christian
[33:40] that says the Lord heaven is my throne
[33:43] and there is my footstool where is the
[33:45] house that you build unto me
[33:47] where is the house that he built into me
[33:49] and where is the place of my rest
[33:53] he got a house he will be he will have a
[33:56] house and he will have a place of rest
[33:58] but what it is
[34:01] where it is
[34:02] Hallelujah and he also answered this
[34:05] question in verse 2. for all those
[34:08] things that mine had made and all those
[34:11] things have been says the Lord
[34:13] but to this man will I look even to him
[34:17] that is poor and of a country spirit and
[34:20] dreamlet at my words
[34:23] where is the place of my rest
[34:26] where is what kind of house Allelujah
[34:30] that I am going to have

[35:25] what knowing not that your body is the
[35:27] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you

[35:33] your own
[35:35] Hallelujah
[35:37] that is the temple that he is looking
[35:41] Allelujah
[35:42] but the problem brothers and sisters and
[35:45] birbraham said that our body is designed
[35:48] to be a Dwelling Place of God
[35:51] but the problem is when we came to this
[35:55] world
[35:56] Barbarian said we were born in sin
[36:00] shipped in iniquity come to this world
[36:03] speaking lies
[36:05] and this body is no longer fit to be his
[36:08] Dwelling Place
[36:12] in the church age book Ephesian Church
[36:15] AIDS he says now why did this have to be
[36:20] so
[36:21] why was it that the seed of the serpent
[36:23] must come this way
[36:25] Man was created for God man was to be
[36:30] that temple of God the place of God's
[36:33] rest was man
[36:36] Alleluia
[36:37] God's rest the Holy Ghost the Holy
[36:40] Spirit was man the temple
[36:42] and then verbraham ah he used this uh
[36:46] scripture uh Acts chapter 7 for from 46
[36:51] to 51 he says who found favor before God
[36:55] and desired to find a tabernacle for the
[36:58] god of Jacob but Solomon built him and
[37:01] house albeit the must-hide will it not
[37:04] in temples made with hands as says the
[37:06] prophet Heaven is made throne and the
[37:08] Earth and Earth is my footstool what
[37:11] house will you build me says the Lord or
[37:14] what is the place of my rest hath not my
[37:17] hand made all these things
[37:19] then he says ye is stiff neck and
[37:24] uncircumcised in heart and ears you
[37:28] don't always
[37:30] resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers
[37:33] did so do ye
[37:35] Allelujah
[37:38] and uncircumcised in the heart and ears
[37:42] we know that
[37:44] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[37:47] Hallelujah it was it is when the Holy
[37:50] Ghost is uh is up to dwell in a man and
[37:55] Paul said that our circumcision is not
[37:58] influence but Allelujah by the by the
[38:03] Holy Spirit by the baptism of the Holy
[38:05] Ghost and he says
[38:07] he uncircumcised it means
[38:12] you are not
[38:14] baptized with the Holy Ghost
[38:16] you know always resist the Holy Ghost
[38:18] you know always Hallelujah resist it
[38:21] means you don't like that the Holy Ghost
[38:23] will
[38:25] Hallelujah
[38:26] make your body your heart
[38:29] as his Dwelling Place
[38:31] as your father did so uh as your father
[38:35] did so do ye then
[38:40] Satan has known this alone all along it
[38:44] means
[38:45] shaytan he knows that man is designed to
[38:50] be a Dwelling Place of God
[38:53] Satan has known this all along
[38:56] he also wants to indwell man even as
[39:00] Gods so does
[39:03] but God has reserved to himself that
[39:06] right
[39:07] it is not for Satan to dwell in a man
[39:10] Hallelujah that's right God he received
[39:14] to himself
[39:16] Satan cannot do that God Alone appeared
[39:19] in human flesh
[39:20] Satan could not and cannot do that he
[39:23] does not have the creative Powers the
[39:27] only way for Satan to accomplish what he
[39:30] wanted to do was to enter
[39:33] the serpent in Eden even as he entered
[39:36] by evil spirits into the swine at
[39:39] gadhara
[39:40] God does not enter animals but Satan can
[39:45] and will to accomplish his ends
[39:49] he could not have a child directly by
[39:53] Eve as did God by Mary so he entered
[39:56] into the serpent and then begalled him
[39:59] he said just her and by her did Satan
[40:02] have a child vicariously can board the
[40:06] full spiritual characteristics of Satan
[40:10] and the animalistic sensual fleshly
[40:13] characteristic
[40:15] of the serpent no wonder the holy spirit
[40:18] said
[40:19] that Cain was of that Wicked one he was
[40:24] Alleluia
[40:26] now
[40:29] he said God does not enter animal
[40:33] it's only
[40:34] Satan
[40:36] who enters animal he entered into the
[40:39] serpent
[40:40] in the Garden of Eden he enters into the
[40:43] swine at gadhara but God will not do it
[40:47] God does not enter animals
[40:50] Hallelujah but the problem brothers and
[40:53] sisters
[40:54] data
[40:56] after Satan or show the serpent he got
[41:01] his
[41:02] children
[41:05] halleluia
[41:07] and Bethlehem said ah they are
[41:10] animalistic sensual fleshly
[41:13] characteristic of the serpent
[41:16] was on that
[41:18] Lane age of gain
[41:20] and then although Abel was killed by
[41:23] Cayenne but God had a substitute it was
[41:28] said
[41:30] of God
[41:33] through Adam said but the problem when
[41:36] Genesis chapter 6 came Hallelujah that
[41:39] the sons of God saw the daughters of men
[41:41] that they were Fair
[41:43] and they began to choose Hallelujah
[41:46] Jesus 1 chapter 6 verse 1 and it came to
[41:50] pass when men began to multiply on the
[41:52] face of the Earth and daughters were
[41:55] born unto them that the sons of God saw
[41:57] the daughters of men that they were fair
[41:59] and they took them wives of all which
[42:04] they chose
[42:06] now
[42:09] the sons of God and the daughters of men
[42:12] began to mingle themselves
[42:15] Allelujah
[42:17] and after that
[42:19] in verse 3 and the Lord said my spirit
[42:22] shall not always strive with man
[42:25] for that
[42:27] Hallelujah
[42:29] he also is flesh yet his day shall be
[42:32] 120 years my spirit
[42:36] shall not
[42:38] dwell in man anymore
[42:40] Allelujah for he is flesh
[42:43] and we we inherited that Allelujah
[42:48] Barbara have said animalistic sensual
[42:52] fleshly characteristic of the serpent
[42:58] and since we have that
[43:00] kind of nature we have that kind of
[43:02] character and Bible said God does not
[43:05] enter animal
[43:07] Hallelujah
[43:12] it's only Satan who enters animal
[43:16] and when we come to this world there is
[43:19] already spirit that worketh in the
[43:22] children of these obedience
[43:24] the prince of the air
[43:26] Alleluia and birram say that we are just
[43:30] like uh
[43:34] we were sold in a pawnshop of Satan
[43:38] already and he is
[43:40] Allelujah
[43:43] in our first birth
[43:45] we became Sinners and alienated with God
[43:50] Psalms 51 verse 5 behold I was shaping
[43:53] in iniquity and in sin did my mother
[43:55] conceive me
[43:57] I was born in sin
[43:59] shaped in iniquity come to this world
[44:02] speaking lies
[44:04] in Romans chapter 3 verses 10 to 12 as
[44:08] it is written there is none righteous no
[44:11] not one no no no
[44:14] three times in one verse that all said
[44:16] no no righteous no not one there is none
[44:20] that understandeth there is none that
[44:22] seeketh after God there is all they are
[44:25] all gone out of the way and they are all
[44:28] become all together become unprofitable
[44:32] there is none that do with God no not
[44:35] one
[44:36] Hallelujah it means
[44:37] they are all they are together become
[44:41] unprofitable
[44:44] say that God hallelujah created man to
[44:49] be a Dwelling Place of God
[44:51] a house of God a place of God's rest but
[44:55] then when we were born in sin when we
[44:58] came to this world born in sin and he
[45:00] said they are together become
[45:03] unprofitable it means
[45:05] everybody all
[45:08] became useless
[45:10] Hallelujah
[45:17] that's why brothers and sisters
[45:20] when God
[45:22] when Solomon built the first temple
[45:27] and it was so glorious
[45:29] Allelujah
[45:34] they dedicated the temple
[45:37] and the glory of the Lord came down
[45:41] and even the ministers could not even
[45:43] stand to minister because of the glory
[45:46] of God
[45:48] had filled the place
[45:51] Alleluia it's the same thing Brothers
[45:53] says Jesus when God created the first
[45:55] creation
[45:57] Allelujah
[45:59] and the Bible said and God so that it
[46:03] was very good
[46:05] in the sixth day after he created man
[46:08] and God said
[46:11] and the Bible said that and God saw that
[46:14] it was very good
[46:16] but brothers and sisters Hallelujah
[46:21] and uh Barbara said when God created his
[46:25] first family his first
[46:28] ah Soldier
[46:30] he gave them the best weapon that they
[46:33] ever have
[46:34] already which is the word
[46:36] if they will only are
[46:40] stay with that word
[46:42] there would be no death no no nothing no
[46:45] sin no no hungry no
[46:48] no there's no old age Hallelujah no
[46:51] sickness
[46:53] no death Hallelujah but when
[46:57] they stepped out from the word halleluia
[47:01] all sorrows and problems came in
[47:04] in the same thing brothers and sisters
[47:06] when Solomon built the first temple and
[47:10] even the Queen of Sheba when he heard
[47:13] the report Alleluia
[47:17] she can Chronicle chapter 9 verse 3 and
[47:20] when the Queen of Sheba had seen the
[47:22] wisdom of Solomon when he came to
[47:25] Solomon Hallelujah
[47:27] and
[47:29] see
[47:30] had seen the wisdom of Solomon now
[47:33] the Bible was talk was talking about the
[47:36] wisdom of Solomon
[47:38] and the house
[47:40] that he had built
[47:42] the wisdom of Solomon
[47:45] and then they speak concerning the house
[47:47] that
[47:49] he had built and the myth of his table
[47:52] and the sitting of his servants and the
[47:55] attendance of his ministers and their
[47:58] apparel his cup bearers also and their
[48:01] apparel and his decent decent and his
[48:05] ascent
[48:06] by which uh he went up into the house of
[48:10] the Lord there was no more spirit in her
[48:14] when the Bible talk about the wisdom of
[48:17] Solomon it is not how you know how
[48:21] ah very intelligent Solomon was
[48:25] but when the Bible talk about the wisdom
[48:28] of Solomon it was how the ACT hallelujah
[48:33] how they go to to the house of the Lord
[48:36] the order hallelujah how they live
[48:40] the word of the Lord
[48:42] but Hallelujah
[48:45] but after all living
[48:47] Solomon himself himself he box lit and
[48:51] all of them Hallelujah backslid
[48:54] and God used the he allowed the King of
[48:58] the North to destroy that first temple
[49:03] Allelujah
[49:04] but
[49:05] God promised
[49:07] Hallelujah in the time of Nehemiah
[49:10] Israel and haggai
[49:13] Alleluia
[49:16] chapter 2 verse 9. the glory of this
[49:20] later house shall be greater
[49:22] than of the former
[49:24] says the Lord of hosts and in this place
[49:28] will I give peace says the Lord of hosts
[49:31] so there will be a rebuilding of the
[49:34] temple to restore or restoration of the
[49:37] temple Hallelujah and God promised that
[49:40] the second temple the glory of the
[49:43] second temple shall be greater the glory
[49:46] shall be greater than the former
[49:51] Hallelujah and although we were born in
[49:54] sin
[49:55] Allelujah we became useless
[49:59] but down inside of us there is a seed
[50:03] predestinated before the foundation of
[50:05] the world
[50:06] and we are
[50:09] predestinated to be a part of his plan
[50:11] as part of that body of his Dwelling
[50:14] Place
[50:15] Ephesians 1 4 7 1 47 according to say ah
[50:20] no
[50:22] before the foundation of the world that
[50:25] we should be holy and Without Blame
[50:27] before him in love
[50:28] having predestinated us until the
[50:30] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[50:33] himself according to the good pleasure
[50:34] of his will
[50:36] to the praise of the glory
[50:38] of his grace were in he had made us
[50:41] accepted in the Beloved in whom we have
[50:44] Redemption through his blood
[50:46] the Forgiveness of sins we have
[50:50] Redemption
[50:51] when we talk about Redemption Redemption
[50:53] means is to bring back
[50:55] Allelujah to its original position
[50:59] to restore to bring us back Allelujah
[51:04] Hallelujah to fulfill his plan in US
[51:08] second Corinthians

[51:13] for he had made himself he made him to
[51:17] be seen for us who knew no sin that we
[51:20] might be made the righteousness of God
[51:22] in him
[51:24] he took my judgment he took your
[51:26] judgment Hallelujah upon him
[51:29] and when that body was judged at Calvary
[51:32] and when you are a part of that body
[51:35] you've been judged together with him at
[51:37] Calvary

[51:40] and uh there is no
[51:44] so-called uh double dopa Jeopardy

[52:51] continue in in jail cooking
[52:55] producing drugs

[53:11] party
[53:12] and when the body of Jesus Christ was

[53:29] by the process
[53:32] of that new birth
[53:33] we become we became a part of that body
[53:36] through justification sanctification and
[53:39] then the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[53:42] we become a part of that body
[53:44] First Corinthians 12 13 for by one
[53:48] Spirit we are all baptized into that
[53:51] body we become a part of that body and
[53:53] if we are a part of that body then
[53:57] Allelujah when he took the Judgment
[53:59] there was no more there is no more
[54:01] judgment
[54:03] for every part of that body
[54:06] Allelujah just like I like what I
[54:09] remember
[54:11] uh an example that brother Looney had a
[54:15] when he used the Lazarus as
[54:18] an example he said that lazarusa
[54:22] he might have maybe he after he was
[54:25] after he died and was resurrected
[54:30] then he he got a wife and then got
[54:34] family got children
[54:37] Hallelujah
[54:39] but those children that he got
[54:43] before they were born they were seen
[54:48] Hallelujah in him
[54:51] that said were in him
[54:54] Allelujah and when Lazarus died
[54:57] all the seed that were in him died
[55:01] Hallelujah but when Lazarus
[55:07] was risen
[55:09] all the seed that were in him were
[55:11] raised into
[55:13] Hallelujah
[55:14] that's why Abraham said I was I died
[55:18] with him at Calvary
[55:19] Hallelujah but after three days
[55:22] and he was resurrected I was also
[55:25] resurrected with him
[55:28] Allelujah and
[55:31] for by one Spirit we are all baptized
[55:33] into one body
[55:35] Hallelujah whether we be Jews or
[55:37] Gentiles whether we'll be banned or free
[55:39] and have been all made to drink into one
[55:43] spirit
[55:44] and
[55:46] once we are a part of that body baptized
[55:49] into that one body and we are in Christ
[55:52] the Bible says that therefore If any man
[55:55] be in Christ he is a new creation he is
[56:00] a new creature Hallelujah Although our
[56:03] old our first Birds we came into this
[56:07] world with
[56:08] the problem said it was a problem who
[56:11] said this animalistic sensual fleecily
[56:14] nature but when Hallelujah we become a
[56:19] part of that body there is there are
[56:21] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[56:24] a new creation all things are passed
[56:28] away behold all things are become new
[56:32] Allelujah and the Bible says in in
[56:34] Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 that Jesus
[56:37] Christ he is the beginning of the
[56:40] creation of God
[56:41] he is the beginning of that creation
[56:44] Hallelujah in the message marriage the
[56:48] marriage of the Lamb
[56:50] he says
[56:51] all that was
[56:53] all that God was he poured into Christ
[56:56] and all that Christ was he poured into
[56:59] the church
[57:01] to continue the work of the Gospel then
[57:04] we become not by artificial name but by
[57:08] a reality of the Holy Spirit of Life
[57:10] connecting us into Christ
[57:13] then through the power of his
[57:15] resurrection we are raised from the dead
[57:18] things of the world and sitting in him
[57:20] in Heavenly places
[57:23] amen I like that
[57:25] tonight we are sitting in Heavenly
[57:27] places in Christ Jesus see resurrected
[57:30] with him died to the things of the world
[57:32] and took on Christ and when we take on
[57:37] Christ then the world's the world is
[57:40] dead
[57:41] then we no more care for the world the
[57:45] world is dead to us and it's dead to us
[57:47] and we are dead to it
[57:50] you are a different person
[57:53] different personality because you are a
[57:56] new creation not the same creation
[57:59] polished up not a man that's turned a
[58:02] new Leaf but a man that's died and been
[58:05] born again and become a new creation in
[58:10] Christ Jesus
[58:11] the spirit of the Living God lives in
[58:15] the person

[58:38] what house are you going to build me
[58:41] Hallelujah
[58:44] Heaven is my throne and Earth is my food
[58:47] soul
[58:48] he is just
[58:50] telling hallelujah how big he is
[58:54] but brothers and sisters praise the Lord
[58:57] and thank God
[58:58] that big God hallelujah can enter into
[59:02] our heart
[59:06] Hallelujah
[59:10] God's provided place of worship

[1:00:34] in IV Bible is a
[1:00:40] when you read the NIV Bible
[1:00:43] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:00:45] to them which are in Christ Jesus period
[1:00:49] Allelujah
[1:00:53] but brothers and sisters
[1:00:55] the
[1:00:57] cut that phrase who walked not after the
[1:01:00] flesh but after the spirit and then they
[1:01:03] found out the translation translator is
[1:01:06] again
[1:01:08] Hallelujah but no condemnation telling
[1:01:12] which are in Christ Jesus and you can
[1:01:13] see Hallelujah they're the fruit of
[1:01:16] their lives they are not walking
[1:01:18] Hallelujah by the flesh but after the
[1:01:22] spirit
[1:01:23] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:01:25] Christ Jesus had made me free from the
[1:01:27] law of sin and death
[1:01:29] Hallelujah Colossians 1 14-18 in whom we
[1:01:34] have Redemption through his blood
[1:01:37] Although our first burden was messed up
[1:01:41] but through his blood we have Redemption
[1:01:44] he had bring us back to our original
[1:01:48] position even the forgiveness of sin
[1:01:52] who is the image of the invisible God
[1:01:54] the firstborn of every creature
[1:01:57] for by him were all things created that
[1:02:00] are in heaven and that are in Earth
[1:02:02] visible and invisible with their
[1:02:04] division or Dominion or principalities
[1:02:07] or Powers all things were created by Him
[1:02:10] and for him
[1:02:12] and he is before all things and by him
[1:02:16] all things consist and he is the head of
[1:02:20] that body Hallelujah we are a part of
[1:02:24] that body and he is the head of body who
[1:02:26] is the beginning the firstborn
[1:02:29] from the dead and in that in all things
[1:02:33] he might have the preeminence
[1:02:36] so Jesus Christ Allelujah is the head of
[1:02:41] that building Jesus Christ is the head
[1:02:44] of that body the church and the fullness
[1:02:47] of the godhead dwelled in him bodily
[1:02:50] and if you are a part of that body we
[1:02:52] have it by measure
[1:02:54] Hallelujah we are all although all the
[1:02:58] fullness of the godhead will it in that
[1:03:00] head bodily Allelujah but if you are a
[1:03:03] part of that body
[1:03:05] we have the same God
[1:03:07] the same quality that was in that head
[1:03:11] is the same life Hallelujah that is in
[1:03:14] the body
[1:03:15] Hallelujah
[1:03:17] like the example of a
[1:03:19] like the ocean
[1:03:22] when you get this big
[1:03:27] machine and examine the chemicals that
[1:03:31] are in the ocean
[1:03:33] Allelujah and then you take a spoonful
[1:03:36] of
[1:03:36] water from the ocean and then examine
[1:03:40] the chemicals that is in that spoon
[1:03:43] there's no difference we have the same
[1:03:46] Hallelujah chemicals that are in the
[1:03:49] ocean and
[1:03:52] on that spoonful of salt water so it's
[1:03:56] the same thing brothers and sisters
[1:03:57] Hallelujah
[1:04:01] the spirit that is
[1:04:03] the godhead that is in in that in the
[1:04:05] head Allelujah is the same
[1:04:08] God that is Allelujah in every part of
[1:04:12] that body only we have it by Mission and
[1:04:15] we have the fullness of the godhead
[1:04:18] now
[1:04:21] Christ is the mystery of God revealed he
[1:04:23] said God is pressed in Christ Jesus who
[1:04:27] both Father Son and Holy Holy Ghost the
[1:04:31] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:04:33] then he says now the complete fullness
[1:04:37] of the godhead bodily dwells in his
[1:04:41] church the pre-minences all that God was
[1:04:45] he poured into Christ and all Christ was
[1:04:48] he poured into the church the Believers
[1:04:51] Hallelujah
[1:04:53] now we are a part of that body not a
[1:04:57] building made with hands
[1:05:03] in Matthew chapter 24 verses 1 and 2.
[1:05:08] when uh
[1:05:10] maybe the disciples want to impress our
[1:05:15] our Lord
[1:05:17] look at this Temple
[1:05:19] how beautiful it is
[1:05:27] just in verse one and Jesus went out and
[1:05:30] departed from the temple and his
[1:05:31] disciples came to him for to show him
[1:05:34] the building of the Temple
[1:05:37] look up
[1:05:39] the temple Allelujah and Jesus said unto
[1:05:43] them you see not all these things verily
[1:05:46] I say unto you there shall not be left
[1:05:49] here one stone upon another that shall
[1:05:52] not be shown down
[1:05:54] see
[1:05:56] that is a glorious Temple that is a
[1:05:58] beautiful Temple but I say unto you
[1:06:02] Hallelujah verily I say unto you there
[1:06:05] shall not be left here one stone upon
[1:06:08] another that shall not be thrown down
[1:06:12] and Barbara Ham went on and says shows
[1:06:15] that God doesn't dwell in houses made
[1:06:18] with hands
[1:06:19] God dwells in human hearts
[1:06:22] for a body has thou prepared me the holy
[1:06:26] the Holy Ghost don't dwell in a house it
[1:06:30] dwells in the heart that's that Temple
[1:06:33] Allelujah
[1:06:36] you know not that you are the Temple of
[1:06:38] the Living God Amen
[1:06:41] Hallelujah but brothers and sisters
[1:06:44] the building or the natural Temple that
[1:06:47] Solomon had built
[1:06:49] was a very type
[1:06:51] how they build it and how they you know
[1:06:56] uh in everything in the temple
[1:06:59] is a very type of the spiritual Temple
[1:07:02] that God is going to have
[1:07:06] Allelujah the verse that we on our
[1:07:09] scripture reading
[1:07:10] First Kings chapter 6 verse 7
[1:07:13] and the house when it was in building
[1:07:16] was built of stone made really before it
[1:07:20] was brought tighter so that there was
[1:07:22] neither Hammer nor ax nor any toll of
[1:07:25] iron heard in the team in the house
[1:07:27] while it was in building
[1:07:31] when they were building the Temple all
[1:07:35] the stones and the Timbers it came from
[1:07:38] it comes from different places of the
[1:07:40] world
[1:07:41] and when
[1:07:43] those materials were brought into the
[1:07:46] site
[1:07:48] there's no more shaping
[1:07:49] Hallelujah no more hammering
[1:07:53] Alleluia
[1:07:54] no more adding or no more
[1:07:57] cutting
[1:07:59] it was already
[1:08:01] shape before it was all brought into
[1:08:04] that into the uh
[1:08:07] Temple site
[1:08:09] how
[1:08:11] perfectly engineered hallelujah what
[1:08:14] what an architecture
[1:08:18] you know
[1:08:24] well I was uh
[1:08:26] troubling in the states
[1:08:29] I I saw some
[1:08:33] some buildings
[1:08:35] some people are they are building and
[1:08:38] the first thing you know
[1:08:40] uh that video is uh just plot in the
[1:08:45] the ground
[1:08:46] fill it with dirt and then use uh this
[1:08:49] uh heavy equipment and to make the the
[1:08:52] place flat
[1:08:55] because when it is flat it is easy to
[1:08:58] to build the
[1:08:59] the building
[1:09:01] Hallelujah but in Jerusalem you can
[1:09:06] imagine the place where they are going
[1:09:08] to build the temple
[1:09:10] and it is a Rocky Mountain you know it
[1:09:13] is not living
[1:09:15] Hallelujah
[1:09:17] but
[1:09:18] everything every part of the temple when
[1:09:21] it is brought into the place
[1:09:25] it is
[1:09:27] fit Hallelujah to its place and no more
[1:09:30] cutting
[1:09:32] you can imagine how how they did it
[1:09:35] Hallelujah
[1:09:40] a greater than Solomon is here
[1:09:42] now the days of Solomon asked any
[1:09:45] Theologian scriptural man knows that
[1:09:47] that was the Golden Age of the Hebrew
[1:09:50] they had no words
[1:09:53] the it it was almost like a millennium
[1:09:56] to them great day
[1:09:59] they built the temple All Nation Nations
[1:10:02] fear them they was afraid to do anything
[1:10:05] because they know that the people was
[1:10:09] with one heart and one Accord God gave
[1:10:14] that gave them a gift and they believe
[1:10:16] it
[1:10:17] they accepted it and with one heart and
[1:10:20] one Accord they work with it
[1:10:23] Allelujah
[1:10:25] when
[1:10:28] the building
[1:10:30] when they were working for the building
[1:10:34] there was Hallelujah the wisdom of
[1:10:37] Solomon
[1:10:40] and All Nations always differed
[1:10:43] Hallelujah
[1:10:47] they are afraid
[1:10:49] to make war with Israel because the
[1:10:53] people were in one heart in in one
[1:10:56] Accord
[1:10:57] but brothers and sisters
[1:10:59] this time we are not just building
[1:11:02] a building of a
[1:11:05] House made with hands
[1:11:08] but this is the building Hallelujah
[1:11:11] which is the body of Jesus Christ
[1:11:15] and if we have Solomon there
[1:11:18] but everyone said greater than Solomon
[1:11:20] is here
[1:11:21] Allelujah if we only believe
[1:11:25] the condition of that time should be
[1:11:27] also the condition of this time he says
[1:11:30] they were in one heart
[1:11:32] they were in one Accord
[1:11:34] and that should be brothers and sisters
[1:11:37] Hallelujah
[1:11:39] that should be happened
[1:11:41] in this in this time
[1:11:44] Hallelujah
[1:11:47] take away all the princess
[1:11:50] there should be no rivalry in the body
[1:11:54] of Jesus Christ every everything every
[1:11:57] part they have their own place
[1:12:00] Hallelujah
[1:12:02] Israel and the church listen when they
[1:12:05] build the Temple of Solomon they any of
[1:12:08] your missions here uh
[1:12:11] no
[1:12:12] could get the pretty uh this pretty good
[1:12:15] they brought the Cedars down from
[1:12:19] Lebanon they floated them in as far as
[1:12:22] jupa and how them by Oxford and so forth
[1:12:26] you know then they cut out all their
[1:12:30] Stones all around the world but when
[1:12:32] they come together they were such
[1:12:34] perfect Masonry
[1:12:36] and in 40 years in the building of the
[1:12:39] temple there were there wasn't a bus
[1:12:41] abaso or a sound of a hammer
[1:12:45] every stone went one was cut this away
[1:12:49] one was cut that way one was cut back
[1:12:53] this away but every one of them went
[1:12:57] together they started lying the thing
[1:13:00] putting the building up getting along
[1:13:02] fine
[1:13:03] and they found a funny looking Stone
[1:13:06] they didn't want that thing said that
[1:13:09] don't belong here
[1:13:11] and they kicked it out throwed it over
[1:13:14] in the wheat pile and come to find out
[1:13:19] the belt on and on and on and on and
[1:13:22] come to find out the very Stone they had
[1:13:25] rejected was the Chief Cornerstone
[1:13:30] brothers and sisters
[1:13:33] Maybe
[1:13:37] some brothers are funny to you
[1:13:40] or some sister they are funny to you
[1:13:44] they are old
[1:13:46] Hallelujah but every part of that body
[1:13:50] is very important
[1:13:52] [Music]
[1:13:53] Allelujah
[1:13:55] there is a purpose
[1:13:58] you might be just uh you know you are
[1:14:01] just sitting at the back
[1:14:03] and you don't
[1:14:05] Hallelujah
[1:14:09] maybe you said
[1:14:11] oh I like to be like the musician like
[1:14:14] the singer and like the the preacher
[1:14:17] Hallelujah
[1:14:19] they are good because uh they are
[1:14:21] blessed because
[1:14:23] they are always in front and I'm just
[1:14:26] sitting here
[1:14:28] brothers and sisters
[1:14:30] you are important
[1:14:32] to God you are important in the body
[1:14:35] imagine brothers and sisters if all of
[1:14:38] us will behave and nobody is sitting
[1:14:40] there
[1:14:43] so what kind of a church we have
[1:14:47] Alleluia all of us
[1:14:50] everybody is important
[1:14:53] you might be just sitting there
[1:14:57] and you might be just uh you know
[1:15:00] praying secretly
[1:15:04] but don't you know brothers and sisters
[1:15:06] that there is no preacher that can
[1:15:09] preach A good sermon here
[1:15:11] Hallelujah
[1:15:14] except there is someone praying for him
[1:15:20] you maybe say that this church is doing
[1:15:25] uh some missionary missionary Works in
[1:15:28] different places of the world
[1:15:31] but
[1:15:33] without somebody who is
[1:15:36] secretly giving doing their parts
[1:15:40] contributing their parts Hallelujah
[1:15:51] there will be no missionary work will be
[1:15:55] done for this church
[1:15:57] every part of the body is very important
[1:16:01] Hallelujah
[1:16:03] tell me
[1:16:05] any part of the body that
[1:16:09] got no purpose
[1:16:12] I am making this an example just like
[1:16:16] your eyebrow
[1:16:20] you may say what is he he doing there
[1:16:27] I tell you shame it and you will know
[1:16:33] Hallelujah
[1:16:37] what is the purpose of that eyebrow but
[1:16:40] it has a you know a more important role
[1:16:44] in our body the eyebrow
[1:16:48] because uh when you work
[1:16:51] and then you will sweat and win your
[1:16:54] sweat come into your eyes it will damage
[1:16:57] your eyes
[1:16:58] so God put an eyebrow
[1:17:01] and it did not just grow this way
[1:17:05] it grow this way
[1:17:07] Hallelujah so that when
[1:17:11] the sweat start dropping
[1:17:13] it will go this way and
[1:17:16] will not come to your to your eyes
[1:17:19] Hallelujah
[1:17:22] every part of the body is very important
[1:17:26] and we should do and babraham said as
[1:17:31] long as you serve your purpose you will
[1:17:33] come up in the resurrection as long as
[1:17:36] you serve your purpose remember
[1:17:38] Hallelujah God did not put you there
[1:17:40] without a purpose
[1:17:43] and
[1:17:45] you know
[1:17:46] just like our watch
[1:17:49] this watch maybe if you will be given a
[1:17:52] chance to choose which part of this
[1:17:55] watch you want to be
[1:17:58] maybe you will see I I would like to be
[1:18:00] the diamond
[1:18:02] because it it's always on display I
[1:18:05] would like to be the second hand or the
[1:18:07] minute hand because the owner is always
[1:18:10] looking at me
[1:18:12] Hallelujah but brothers and sisters
[1:18:14] don't you know that the most important
[1:18:16] part of this watch is not this
[1:18:20] things that are seen
[1:18:22] there are parts of this watch that
[1:18:25] even our eyes could not see it
[1:18:29] that's why the was repairer he uses lens
[1:18:33] just to see this very small part
[1:18:36] but when you misplace that small part
[1:18:41] this watch will no longer
[1:18:43] work and what you are going to do with
[1:18:45] your diameter and with with this display
[1:18:47] display in in your hands you have to
[1:18:50] take it off from your hands and you will
[1:18:52] you know
[1:18:53] if it is not working anymore
[1:18:57] so brothers and sisters Alleluia
[1:19:00] whatever our part in the body we have to
[1:19:03] support Allelujah we have to do our part
[1:19:07] and God will bless you
[1:19:10] Hallelujah Ephesians chapter 2 verse 21
[1:19:12] in home all the building fitly framed
[1:19:16] together growth unto Unholy temple in
[1:19:20] the Lord
[1:19:21] groweth unto and holy Temple Temple
[1:19:25] means Dwelling Place
[1:19:27] Allelujah in the Lord
[1:19:29] Ephesians 4 16 from whom the whole body
[1:19:33] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:19:36] that which every joint supplies
[1:19:38] according to the effectual working in
[1:19:41] the measure of every part make it
[1:19:44] increase
[1:19:45] of the body unto the defying of itself
[1:19:49] in love
[1:19:51] in love
[1:19:53] Hallelujah
[1:19:57] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday to
[1:19:59] them forever
[1:20:01] he says and it was so masterly built
[1:20:04] that when the temple went together it
[1:20:07] had all kinds of little funny looking
[1:20:10] stones in it
[1:20:12] but when they began to read the
[1:20:14] blueprint it was all in the blueprint
[1:20:19] and there wasn't not even a boss of a
[1:20:21] soul or sound of a hammer for 40 years
[1:20:26] in building the Temple I think that's
[1:20:30] the way God's got his people all cut out
[1:20:34] Allelujah
[1:20:36] God before it was brought into the place
[1:20:40] Allelujah it was already shaped
[1:20:44] my
[1:20:47] we are not con I am not contacting bar
[1:20:50] Chad what I'm going to preach tomorrow
[1:20:52] or on Sunday and
[1:20:56] Hallelujah or he also he don't contact
[1:20:59] anybody any person any any Minister what
[1:21:03] is going to preach
[1:21:05] he just pray
[1:21:07] we just pray
[1:21:09] Hallelujah and then
[1:21:11] you know by the grace of God I was
[1:21:15] uh
[1:21:20] privilege to travel and to see to meet
[1:21:24] Believers in different churches and
[1:21:28] every time I come to church Hallelujah
[1:21:31] I feel the same Spirit as we have been
[1:21:34] in my church you go to other churches
[1:21:36] they have the same spirit
[1:21:38] they have the same life why
[1:21:41] Allelujah because there is only one
[1:21:43] architect
[1:21:45] who designed the building
[1:21:47] Alleluia
[1:21:52] I think that's the way God's got his
[1:21:55] people all cut out once God and nature
[1:21:58] of one kind one another but they are all
[1:22:02] Christians fitted Stones joined together
[1:22:05] upon the cheap Corner Cornerstone
[1:22:09] Christ Jesus Hallelujah Maybe
[1:22:13] one stone is one sister is
[1:22:16] looks like funny to you
[1:22:20] Hallelujah maybe one stone is
[1:22:23] is black
[1:22:25] and
[1:22:27] some Stone were cut in
[1:22:31] Lebanon or in Africa
[1:22:36] and then some Stone are white and some
[1:22:38] Stone are black and some Stone are brown
[1:22:40] maybe from the Philippines
[1:22:43] Hallelujah and
[1:22:46] you cannot see that I will not sit
[1:22:48] beside you because you are brown and I
[1:22:50] am white and
[1:22:52] I cannot be sit beside you
[1:22:54] Hallelujah because
[1:22:56] I am Brown and you are black
[1:22:59] always you can do nothing there is
[1:23:01] someone who designed it
[1:23:03] and when the building is finished oh
[1:23:06] there's a lot of colors Hallelujah a
[1:23:08] beautiful building
[1:23:10] imagine brothers and sisters you have a
[1:23:12] big garden and
[1:23:14] because you only like a white flower and
[1:23:18] all your flowers in the big Garden are
[1:23:21] are all white
[1:23:25] that's not a beautiful garden
[1:23:27] but when we see the red pink
[1:23:31] White
[1:23:33] yellow
[1:23:36] you will get Hallelujah a beautiful
[1:23:38] garden and that's the same thing with
[1:23:40] God
[1:23:42] maybe uh you don't like the way
[1:23:47] he shape
[1:23:50] but Hallelujah
[1:23:53] there is somebody who did it
[1:23:56] I think that's the way God's got his
[1:23:58] people cut out once got a nature of one
[1:24:02] kind one another but they're all
[1:24:04] Christian fitted Stones joined together
[1:24:06] upon the Chief Cornerstone Christ Jesus
[1:24:09] oh there's the main thing so many reject
[1:24:12] the precious Cornerstone
[1:24:14] where we are all built together cemented
[1:24:18] together with God's love that's right
[1:24:20] God's love
[1:24:22] Hallelujah and when we have that there's
[1:24:26] nothing will separate us there's nothing
[1:24:28] can divide us as long as we love one
[1:24:31] another but I've been a minister for 71
[1:24:35] years I've seen all kinds of gifts I've
[1:24:37] seen God do great things but the
[1:24:41] greatest thing I
[1:24:43] I ever seen in my life was love
[1:24:47] it's the most powerful force
[1:24:50] that stops anything there is is love
[1:24:54] love that moved almighty God God so
[1:24:56] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:24:58] begotten son love is a great K note
[1:25:02] thing we lived out it's something that's
[1:25:07] eternal
[1:25:08] hallelujah it's something love
[1:25:10] hallelujah it's something that's eternal
[1:25:14] hope
[1:25:15] Faith charity
[1:25:19] Hallelujah
[1:25:26] but love
[1:25:28] it's something that's eternal
[1:25:30] so we have to be fitly joined together
[1:25:34] in love Hallelujah
[1:25:37] because uh
[1:25:39] you will not be ruptured without me
[1:25:43] and I will not be ruptured without you
[1:25:47] God bless you all and I now give back
[1:25:49] the time to our beloved pastor
[1:26:08] let's all stand musicians if you would
[1:26:10] come and brother Ben make your way up
[1:26:13] amen how many is happy to be part of
[1:26:15] that house
[1:26:17] that God is building amen not a house
[1:26:21] made with hands not even necessarily the
[1:26:24] part you see
[1:26:25] but the part you don't see is where he's
[1:26:27] dwelling in me amen what you see is just
[1:26:30] the manifestation on the outside God
[1:26:33] bless you brother Jonathan golf it's
[1:26:35] good to see you amen God bless you
[1:26:37] amen what a good reminder
[1:26:39] amen that we all must fit together
[1:26:43] and I need your little odd Quirk and you
[1:26:45] need my little odd Quirk it's there for
[1:26:47] a reason and we would learn to depend on
[1:26:49] one another instead of criticizing one
[1:26:51] another and be thankful that we're not
[1:26:53] all the same because if we're all the
[1:26:55] same we would all have the same blind
[1:26:57] spot we'd all be taken by that same
[1:26:58] blind spot but because each of us view
[1:27:01] things a little bit different it's there
[1:27:03] for God's protection and if we'll just
[1:27:04] love one another trust one another and
[1:27:06] respect one another God will use all
[1:27:09] those little differences to keep us
[1:27:11] going in the right direction and keep us
[1:27:13] guarded against evil man God bless you
[1:27:16] man thank you so much I'm so glad you
[1:27:18] came by amen he's been here many times
[1:27:21] but it's the first time he's preached

[1:27:28] praying for him amen he'll be going home
[1:27:30] on the 20th pray for him that God will
[1:27:32] bless him and bless his ministry at home
[1:27:34] and his church and his family
[1:27:36] men
[1:27:39] when brother Ben comes back we'll sing
[1:27:41] turn around on my song that was gone and
[1:27:44] I'm not going to attempt to do it by
[1:27:45] myself

[1:29:43] way he was and God knew where he fit and
[1:29:46] we may not even understand ourselves
[1:29:48] completely and why we have the
[1:29:50] temperament and the things we like and
[1:29:52] things we don't and the way we act and
[1:29:54] we may not always understand it but I'm
[1:29:56] so glad he knows where I fit amen and if
[1:29:59] I can just trust him the great architect
[1:30:02] to place me in the right spot if I can
[1:30:04] just yield to him he'll put me right
[1:30:06] where I belong and use me exactly the
[1:30:08] way he wants to use me for his glory I'm
