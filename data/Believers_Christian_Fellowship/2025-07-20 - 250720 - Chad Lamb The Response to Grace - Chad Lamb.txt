We bless your name. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. Let's bow our heads together and pray. Dear heavenly father, we're so thankful, Lord, that we can bless your name, Lord. You've been so good to us. And God, it's with love in our hearts and great joy, Lord, that we can lift our hands and say, "We bless your name. We love you, Lord, for you are wonderful and your mercies are new every morning. And you've been so good to us, Lord." And God, here we gather this morning, Lord, to sing your praises. You've drawn us, Lord, to yourself. For no man can come to you unless you draw, Lord. God, I pray now that you would feed us as we come, your waiting sheep, hungry, Lord, for more of you. Lord, would you come and break the bread of life with your own hands? Lord, I yield this vessel of mine unto you that you might use it for this purpose, Lord. For God, you determined, Lord, that you would preach the gospel and that you would use man. And God, I want to be a vessel that you can take full control of and have preeminence and use for that purpose. And may the words, Lord, of eternal life come forth. May they strike our hearts, Lord. And may they root down deep and bring forth a bountiful harvest unto your glory. For we give ourselves to that purpose. May you come and have preeminence among us as we yield and surrender to you. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you all. It's certainly good to be here together again this morning. Amen. If you want to take your Bibles with me and we can turn to the book of uh Romans. We can turn to Romans chapter 3 together. Just want to remind you that uh brother Gabe Smith is away preaching. He's across town preaching for Bible believers. So, we want to remember him and his family today. And also, we got a few visitors here with us today. So, uh we just want to say hi to the Ritter family. It's good to have you guys back with us again in fellowship. God bless you. And I saw Daniel Ber and his family here. God bless you. They're from Junction City. So, it's good to have you all here once again. And uh also, we've got visitors that are from the Chicago area. Brother Peter and Sister Sharon Art. They're passing through this uh area on vacation and they stopped in. So, wherever you are, God bless you. It's good to have you. Want you to feel very welcome here today. Also want to remind you that we have a fellowship dinner after service immediately after service down in the uh fellowship hall. So all of you who are visitors, we hope that you can stay and join us and we'd love to share the time of fellowship uh with you all. Amen. Let's look at Romans chapter 3. Romans chapter 3 verse uh verse 21. Let's start at verse 21. says, "But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets, even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe. For there's no difference. For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God, to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness, that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. Amen. Praise God. By what law? Of works? Nay, but by the law of faith. &gt;&gt; Therefore, we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. Amen. God bless you as you take your seats. Amen. Amen. So, we're going to continue on. Brother Frank, if you want to bring the first slide up. Uh we're just going to continue our thought and carry over from Sunday. Sunday we talked about the strength of grace and talked about what God has done for us uh unmmerited of ourselves without our input. God did it for us. Amen. Before we were born. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He sent Christ Jesus to die as a propitiation for our sins before uh before we were born. If you want to turn with me, let's go ahead and turn to Ephesians chapter 2. Yeah. Ephesians chapter 2 verse 8. Verse 8. For by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God. Not of works lest any man should boast. Amen. This is a continuation of the the thought that we had over in Romans because in Romans it was it was telling us that we are saved. We are justified by faith. Amen. By grace in God. Now, we we're considered righteous and justified by faith. But we can't take credit for that faith. We can't be proud. We can't be puffed up. We can't be overly zealous because I believe the word. We believe the word because it was given to us by grace. Amen. By grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves. It is a gift of God. Amen. Where is boasting then? It's excluded because we can't say I'm I'm great because I believe. No, you're not. You're not great because you believe. You believe by the grace of God. You believe by his greatness, not our greatness. &gt;&gt; He says in Romans 9 verse1 15 says, "For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion." So then it is not of him that willth, nor of him that runth, but of God that showeth mercy. So this is important for us to understand it. It's not that the it's not in my efforts. It's not in what I could do. was not in and how I achieved anything because there was there was no achievement. Amen. That brought me to this place of salvation. And it's so important. That's why there's no boasting. What should we boast in? Because it wasn't my achievement that earned anything with God. It wasn't it wasn't uh uh what I had learned or what I God bless you, Sister Anne. Sister Anne Gibbs is here with Brother Wesley. Amen. Sorry, I got distracted. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so it's not in what we can take credit in. Amen. So, all glory goes back to God who saved us by his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's what brother Bham says in the message of grace. Says he can save a wretch like me. And he did. What is it? Grace. William Brand. I'm a drunkard son. That don't make any difference. The grace of God saved me. &gt;&gt; Me, I'm a woman's daughter that was no good. don't make any difference. The grace of God saved you. It's sovereign. Has to It doesn't has to ask nobody nothing. And I'm so glad of that. Hallelujah. Can take the violet sinner and make him white as snow. Don't have to ask anybody about it. Oh, it can do it because it's sovereign. &gt;&gt; Listen quickly now. That was proved at the cross when there was the vilest thief. He deserved to die. God had never come come across his mind. He never thought nothing of it. There on the cross through through his bloody lips in between the groans there came a sound. Lord be merciful to me. And there came another one back through uh blood, tears, agony, grace took a hold and said, "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise." Grace did that. &gt;&gt; Amen. How could that thief help himself? No more than Adam could help himself. No more than Eve could help herself. No more than you can help yourself. No more than I can help myself. No more than we could jerk ourselves up the milky white way with our bootstraps. We couldn't do it. But the grace of God can do something about it. And it does it. The grace of God, the sovereignty of the grace of God. Come to that dying thief today. Shalt thou be with me in paradise. Oh, think of it. That's wonderful. &gt;&gt; So, let's go and look at Luke chap 23 together. And we're going to look at the story of the thief. Luke uh 23 and verse 39. All right. Luke 23:39. And one of the malifactors which were hanging railed on him, saying, "If thou be Christ, save thyself and us." So we It's It's a picture we want to see. We've got Jesus Christ. Amen. And he's he's nailed to the cross. He's the propitiation. He's the sacrifice. He's there shedding his blood to pay the price of redemption to buy back all that was lost. And on one side is one malifactor, one thief, it says. And on the other side is another malifactor. Amen. And both of these people have lived vile lives and they're getting they're getting just fruits, rewards for their deeds. &gt;&gt; So neither one of them are clean living people. &gt;&gt; All right. It's a perfect picture. We want to see this picture. Amen. Because amen, we don't want to we don't want to find ourselves as the Pharisees walking in front of the cross wagging our heads. We want to find ourselves, Amen, nailed to the cross because of all of our sins. We want to find ourselves, Amen, under judgment because of all our false deeds. And the question is, which one of these thieves are you going to be? &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now he comes on and says, "But the other," that's what the first thief said. "The other, but the other answered, rebuking him, saying, Dust thou, does thou, does not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? But we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds. But this man hath done nothing a miss." And he said unto Jesus,"Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom." And Jesus said unto him, "Verily I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with me in paradise." &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this picture because in this picture you have the dying thief on the cross, two of them. And then you have the propitiation for sin standing in between of them or not standing, nailed in between of them. And in and in and the one malifactor, he he's he's just saying, you know, why don't you do some sign? Why don't you just save us? Why don't you just give it get us off of this cross? A and he's mocking the Lord and and he's telling them if you if you're so great, Amen. save us from this. But the other malifactor, he's not saying he's saying, you know, I I getting exactly what I deserve. &gt;&gt; I I've done this. He's done nothing wrong. Don't you fear God? And then he looks at Jesus and he says, "Lord, amen." He acknowledges who this is hanging on the cross that this is his Lord. Amen. And he says, "Remember me when thou come into thy kingdom." All of a sudden, his confession is, "I believe you're the Messiah. I believe you're coming to the kingdom. I believe you're the Lord." And all of a sudden, Amen. his faith was expressed in his confession. And he was saved by faith. &gt;&gt; There wasn't a thing he could do to get right first. There wasn't a thing he can do to live a clean life and come to the church. There wasn't anything he can do to straighten up what he had done wrong so that he was meat or worthy to meet the Lord and to go into paradise. He wasn't worthy to go into paradise. He didn't do any deed that would justify him entering into paradise. There's only one thing that he did that granted a pardon and that pardon came because he believed in the word for his day that was nailed there to the cross. &gt;&gt; What condemned the other one? The other thief was not condemned because he smoked, drank, swore, stole, committed whatever he committed. That's not why he didn't enter into paradise. He didn't enter paradise because when he had opportunity to come in contact with the word, he mocked it and railed against it and disbelieved. &gt;&gt; Because they both had done the same deeds. &gt;&gt; They were both there for the same sedition. They were both there for the same for the same crime. Amen. And lived a similar life. How could one be saved and the other could not be saved? It was completely by grace. Amen. Well, what do you mean by grace? Why would God give grace to one and not the other? This is why God is just &gt;&gt; and the justifier. God cannot in order for God to be just, he doesn't just say, "I'm going to let you off, but I'm not going to let you off &gt;&gt; because that would violate his justice." But what he says is anybody that can believe in me, anybody that can receive my word, anybody that can accept me gets the benefit of me, which is Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the word was made flesh, &gt;&gt; dw among us. And that word, amen, was nailed to the cross. That word made flesh was crucified and bled and died for us to atone for us. And when every age when the believer was able to accept the word in their day, amen, they got the benefit of the word bleeding for them on Calvary. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't because of we did good deeds. &gt;&gt; I mean, read the Bible. &gt;&gt; They didn't always do good deeds. &gt;&gt; I mean, they did good some good deeds, but they did some bad deeds, too. And the bad deeds were worthy of punishment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But why were why were they able to bypass? Why were they why why when uh Jesus died, Amen. Why was there a resurrection of the saints of old and and many that were in the grave slept? Amen. Not all but many. Who were those that came forth? They were the ones who were able to accept the word for their day. &gt;&gt; They were able to accept Christ for their day, the anointed word in their day. And they held to it despite all opposition. They didn't live a perfect life, but they believed the word and held to the the faith they had in that word. And that faith was a gift of God. &gt;&gt; It was God's grace. Amen. To give them the ability to believe the word. And by faith, they were justified. &gt;&gt; Amenise &gt;&gt; when the price was paid. So, so when we look at the two thieves on the cross, listen, when it comes to the Lord, I I don't want to be the church member out in front. I want to find myself as one of these two thieves. guilty as charged. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Before salvation, condemned to die, &gt;&gt; because every one of us has exercised our free moral agency to choose sin. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's not one of us who've passed through life and not forsaken the word. &gt;&gt; We've exercised the free choice God gave us. And many times we chose the wrong thing. and for exercising our free moral agency and choosing the wrong thing. We are condemned. We've condemned ourselves. &gt;&gt; But I'm so thankful that there's a way to be free. &gt;&gt; And that way is through the blood of Jesus Christ. And access to that grace is by faith. &gt;&gt; But that not of ourselves. &gt;&gt; It is a gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's so for me so important to remember that it's not what we did. It's it's the faith that God believe us to latch on to his word. And that's what brings us into life. That's what brings us brings us into that place where we can be justified by his grace. And so that's how we all begin our journey and that's how we move into this great revelation of of the grace of God by his mercies. And so as we continue on, I want to build on that and and keep looking at what brother Benham says because we know that we preached on on uh on Wednesday. Amen. I never know what day of the week it is. We preached on Wednesday that that the strength of God's grace was stronger than our failure. &gt;&gt; It was stronger than our misunderstanding. It was stronger than our backslide. His grace has been stronger than anything that we could do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So he was able to save us. Amen. So now we want to look at our response to that grace. What is the response to grace? If we look at this uh quote here from the prophet of God, he says, "Yet that's the same thing that stands today. Men and women can go to church and have the long face and pious as they can be and never lie, steal, and try to live the religion as best they can, but unless they are believers, they're lost." Right. &gt;&gt; That's so important. Brother's trying to show us that it's not just doing right. It's not just coming under a code of operation and keeping all the ordinances of the church and doing all of that. That's all fine. Amen. But that doesn't mean you're saved. &gt;&gt; Unless you are a believer, you're lost. &gt;&gt; So there's no scratch of legalist in the Bible. Calvinism is grace is what God did for you and works is what you do for God. It's absolutely separated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now this is what I want to start talking about today. It's something that we all know very well. But grace is unmmerited. Grace is based off God's love. Grace is what God did for me. Amen. Despite any action from me. Amen. And and the and the and the the path the connection to that grace is through faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's a gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But then what about works? Why are there commandments in the Bible? Why does God tell us to do stuff? Why does Paul tell the church to do this and don't do that? Why did brother Benham come and tell us the mind of God that he wants this and he doesn't want that? Why all of that if that doesn't matter for salvation? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because brother Brennan breaks it down and he's going to keep breaking down as we go. Grace is what God did for me and works is what I do for God. &gt;&gt; And he says they're totally separate. We don't want to mix one of these into the other. I don't want to mix my works into salvation because then when I fail in my works, I question my salvation. &gt;&gt; It doesn't do any good to mix legalism into grace. Amen. Because as soon as we do, we start to go up and down and back and forth. And we're saved one day and not saved the next day. And we have no stability to keep pressing on because we're constantly two steps forward and a step back. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because why? We still live in a hybrid condition. We still can be tempted by the world. We still can and and make all kinds of mistakes. We make them all the time. Amen. But that's why there has to be a separation of grace and a separation of works. And we're and you come to it from two completely different angles. Amen. want is something that God did for me completely independent of my works. &gt;&gt; Completely independent of my merit, my worth, or anything that I could do in the flesh. It's completely separated. It's 100% what God has done for me. Amen. But over here, amen. My response to that love and my response to that grace is a desire in my heart to please him, to do anything I can for him. He gave his life for me. Now there's something in me that wants to give my life back to him. And those things, brother said, are separate, but they go together. So, we'll talk about that. &gt;&gt; He says, if you quit lying, quit smoking, quit stealing, quit committing adultery, quit all, done everything, keep the commandments, and went to church, baptized every Sunday, took the communion, washed the feets of the saints, done everything, healed the sick, and done all these other things. Unless you're born of the spirit of God, elected, you're lost. &gt;&gt; Not him that willth, nor him that runth, but God that showeth mercy. So the prophet uses this scripture. Amen. So we know uh we know that it was God's will. Amen. Not our will. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean we don't have a will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But no matter how much we want to be saved, Amen. If if God doesn't will, it wasn't God's will to show mercy. It's not him that willth nor him that runth, but God that showeth mercy. &gt;&gt; But we have a will. And what is our will? and how would he exercise our will? The prophet of God told us you have to will to do the will of God. You have to have a desire to want to serve him. &gt;&gt; And to me, that's an appropriate response to grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, we're going to talk about that in Romans 8 29. He says, "For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called. Whom he called, then he also justified. Whom he justified, then he also glorified. What shall we then say to these things? If God before us, who can be against us? &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If God has already determined, Amen. is he already by fornowledge predestinated me to be conformed to the image of his son? Praise God. Amen. I've got the mind of God and the will of God on my side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And whom he predestinated, he also called. whom he called, he justified. Whom he justified, he also glor in and God, it's a finished work. Amen. In the mind of God, you've already been glorified. It's a finished work. We're just here acting out what was in his mind. And so, praise God. If if I'm already arrived, Amen. then I'm not trying to arrive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I'm just here fleshing out what God has already determined in his mind. &gt;&gt; So, what shall we say to these things? If God gone before us, who can be against us? And then he starts going down into who can condemn us? Who can lay a charge to the elect of God? How can you accuse them of anything? For Christ died for them. Christ paid for them. Amen. How how can you blame them? &gt;&gt; I mean, we can look at deeds done and say, "I that was wrong and this is wrong and that's not right." But how do you condemn them to hell? How do you tell them they're not a believer and they're a sinner when Christ paid the price of redemption? &gt;&gt; So, if God is for us, who can be against us? In the message of grace, the says, "Think of it. Love and grace is sisters." We read this Wednesday night. Twin sisters. You can't have grace without having love. They're twin sisters. That's exactly right. Before you can have grace, you have to have love. Before you can actually show somebody a favor, you love them. Right or wrong, you have to love them anyhow or you can't see. So, love and grace is the same thing. They're just twin sisters, that's all. Love and grace. There's one quote of the prophet where he says grace is love &gt;&gt; because it's the expression of love. It's God showing favor with without merit because based on his love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's where his election is based on a love and the proof of his love is found in election because God loved us. &gt;&gt; In marriage and divorce, brother Bram says it's just like today. There are two great schools of doctrine in the church. One of them is Calvinism. The other one is Armenianism. One of them is legalist and the other one is grace. And we come to find out that people who believe in grace, the Calvinist say, "Bless God. It don't hurt me to smoke. It don't hurt me to drink. I can do these things. I've got eternal security." Then we find the other side on the legalist said, "Oh, I would like to ball him out. I would like to show him a piece of my mind, but I'm a Christian. I have to keep still." See, you find yourself on two different roads and neither one of them is right. &gt;&gt; I I love this. &gt;&gt; Amen. And here's the problem. The problem is human reasoning. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that first part of of Calvinism of of of what would be extreme grace or what goes beyond the scriptures in grace, Amen. is is the the thought, well, if without merit, he saved me and I'm saved by his grace apart from my works and it's not of works but only his faith. So if I believe in him, that's all I need. So now it doesn't matter what kind of life I live. Amen. Because of his grace. And you see how slick the devil is because there's a truth there. There is something that is true that they're talking about because it was never based on your merit. And even your mistakes do not put you outside of God's love and grace. &gt;&gt; So they're right. The problem is, Amen. I'm just going to let brother say it here in a few minutes, but the problem of it is, Amen. You're using human reasoning and human logic and you're responding to a gospel truth and human reasoning and now you've perverted the truth of the gospel &gt;&gt; by human reasoning. Now, brother Bram's going to tell us how this works and I think it's so beautiful because the simplicity of the word is always so good. He says, now the last thing he said in the quote here was, "And neither one of them is right." So, I'm going to pick up and read from where he left off. Now, this is hard to say that, but it's the truth. We find ourselves on two different roads. One going one way, one another. Now, let's see what the truth is. So, the prophet of God constantly had a ministry that would pull from both sides, back to this gospel truth, back to the Bible. And he said, "Now, let's see what the truth is." So, now he's going to tell us what the truth is. So listen, this debate has been going on for quite some time between Calvinism and Armenianism. Amen. There were different schools of thought. Amen. Calvinism, Amen, went into grace and then and it went extreme. It went into extreme grace. Amen. So then Armenianism was fighting back against the extreme grace and saying, "No, you have a choice. You have to choose. You have to live right. You have to do right. You can be an outcast from the economy of God if you don't obey God's word." Amen. And these two things, amen, that this is where the Wesleyan movement came in and started with Methodism and the works program. Amen. Was Armenianism. And brother Brenham said they had to come and strike a blowup against Calvinism because it needed a blowstruck against them. It was too far one way. And God brought Wesley and Methodism to counterbalance it. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; but he said then they went too far the other way. Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; So, this debate has been going on and it's been going on in theological circles and there's been scriptures tossed around to and back and forth and everybody every theologian who holds their position has his stack of scriptures that he can use to support his scripture his his position and they've been doing theological studies and they've been doing papers and they've been doing PhD programs on the debate between Calvinism and Armenianism. Which one is right? So here God sends a prophet with a seventh grade education and he's going to settle the question with a theological discussion. &gt;&gt; And here's how he does it. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Now listen and see if this sounds sensible to you. Now get ready. We're going to have an essay, theological essay on which is right, Calvin's Armenianism. For instance, if I get ready to go overseas and I take my own family and I call my wife up to me and I'll say, "I'm going overseas, dear." Now, here is the legalist side. Now, my wife, I'm going to lay the law down to you. If you flirt with any man while I'm gone, when I come back, you're a divorced woman. And I don't want you to make eyes. Don't uh don't want you to flirting. You understand that I'm your husband. If you if you do it, I'm going to put you away when I come back. Then she reaches and gets me by the tie and says, "My good man, I'm going to tell you something. See, that if you make eyes at any woman or take any woman out or flirt with any woman, you're going to be a divorced man when you come back." Now, wouldn't that be a happy home? That's legalist. So now he explained the Armenian side. I mean, was that complicated theological discussion on the truth of the scripture? Then he says,"Now the other side is that if I go overseas and I make a mistake, go over and say, 'Now look, I'll take this woman out. Oh, it's all right with my wife. She don't care. My wife says, "I'll go out with this man. It's all right with Bill. He don't care. If I don't care, then there's something wrong with me. I don't love that woman, right? And if she don't care, there's something wrong with her. She's my wife. I don't want other men fooling with her. She's my wife. Now the correct way of it is all right are you listening &gt;&gt; now the correct way of it is there's both of them has got a truth but not the exact truth &gt;&gt; so brother Bam just gave us two examples to explain Calvinism and Armenianism and he didn't use any difficult words &gt;&gt; we didn't have to have a degree to understand what he's saying and we didn't even have to use our dictionary &gt;&gt; right so now he says both of these have a truth, but they're both wrong. And he's going to show us the correct way. Now, here's the correct way. When I go overseas to make it right, my little family gathers around and we pray with one another and I commit them to God and they commit me to God. And when we do, we go overseas. I go overseas. Now, I know she loves me. I have confidence in her and I love her. She's got confidence in me. And as long as I love her like that, she don't have any worry about me taking any other woman out. as long as she loves me right, why there is no need of me thinking about any other man going out with her because she's my wife and I believe her. I believe if I would actually do something wrong, make a mistake and go out with some woman and return back and would confess it to her and tell her ma I didn't mean to do that. I just got caught in a trap. This woman just run up to me and grabbed me by the arm and started so and so. I believe she would be understanding. I believe she would forgive me for it. But I wouldn't do it for nothing because I love her. Though she would forgive me, I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't hurt her for nothing. Though I know she would forgive me for it, I don't want to hurt her. And that's the way it is with God. If filio love, which is human love, fellowship love, can make a man feel that about his wife, what about agapeio love, the Greek word, which means the love of God, how would that make me do about Jesus Christ? As long as I want to go do it, it's in my heart to do. And as long as it's in my heart to do it, I I go do it. Legalism won't let me do it. Is because that I I know I'd get punished for doing it. But the real truth of it is is when the love of God comes into your heart till you want to do it. That's the truth of it. There's the two schools. Not legalism or the other or Calvinism. It's both. &gt;&gt; Amen. So listen, don't rail on the Calvinist. They got truth. &gt;&gt; Don't rail on the Armenianism. Armenianist. They've got truth. Brother Benham said they both got truth. He says, "Which is it? Calvinism or Armenian?" both. &gt;&gt; And the reality of it is that the grace of God and what God has done for me puts such a love in my heart and such a trust for him who loved me so much. My reciprocal love for him. Amen. It it changes me in the on the inside to where I don't want to hurt him. I don't want to displease him. I don't want I don't want to I I I don't want to hurt him in any way. I don't want to hurt his name. I don't want to hurt his image. I I don't want to hurt his reputation. Everything about me doesn't want to do it. So I restrain the desires of my flesh. Not because I'm going to go to hell. Not because I'm going to get punished. Not because church people will find out. But I restrain the lust of the flesh because I don't want to do anything to displease my Lord who by grace has saved me despite my merit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know, I mean, we know good and well that God, he's promised to forgive us of all of our sins. I know God will forgive me if I make a mistake. I believe with all my heart that God will forgive me if I repent. But that doesn't lead me into premeditated sin. That doesn't lead me into fulfilling the lust of the flesh by a concept that I know that he'll forgive me. He has to forgive me anyways. So because he has to forgive me, I'm going to intentionally fulfill this lust of the flesh because now God has to forgive me. Amen. That thinking is a wrong understanding of grace. Amen. something in our relationship with the Lord has to go deeper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's got to be like marriage. It's got to come to the place where if if brother Bam said, "If I believe if I got caught in a trap and I got stuck in a situation and I made a foolish decision, if I come back to my wife, I believe with all my heart that she would forgive me, this is brother Bam talking." Amen. But he says, "But I wouldn't do anything in the world to hurt her." Amen. There's nothing in me that wants to hurt her. And he said, "That's the truth of it." Amen. Praise God. I think to me one of the one of the uh the the greatest tragedies I it's in marriage too but in our relationship with the Lord is selfishness. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When when I look at this selfishness that I do something knowing it's going to hurt my wife but I do it anyways because we're already married. She took a vow. She has to forgive me. She can't leave me anyhow. And so I'm going to do what I want to do anyways, knowing it hurts her, but knowing that she has to forgive me. &gt;&gt; Listen, if that's the truth, then I don't love that woman the way I should love her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If that's the way I think I do not love that woman, right? I love myself more than I love her. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; And listen, uh, none of us should have, I hope none of us did, choose our wives. Amen. Based off their application. &gt;&gt; I mean, how many of you took application? I got 10 applicants. I mean, some of us were lucky to find one who we begged to say yes. I mean, so we may not have got 10 applicants. Amen. But you didn't go through the application. Okay, she's got this much education and this and she can bake this and she knows so many recipes. My goodness, when it come down to getting married, I didn't care if she knew any recipes. I didn't care if she burned everything that came out of the oven. There was something in my heart that loved her and had to have her regardless of anything else. I didn't care if she could cook, if she could clean. I didn't care. I didn't care if she had education or money or anything. That didn't matter to me. What mattered to me was her. I was in love with her, not her attributes or abilities or &gt;&gt; accomplishments. I was in love with her. So it was never about merit. It was always about love. &gt;&gt; Amen. But then once I married that woman, Amen. I loved her so much. Amen. Then there was then as soon as you get married, the moment you're married, you no longer live for self. You live for spouse. And the days of doing whatever I want to do whenever I want to do it are gone out the window. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we can take a you can take a chauvinistic idea and say, "Well, I'm the man. I'm the head of the house. I make decision." Blah blah blah blah blah. Well, yeah, that's the truth. It's your responsibility for the home. You're the one who makes the decision. You make leadership. But if you take that attitude towards it with unconsideration of somebody else and only considering yourself and your selfishness, amen, you've taken the word of God and you perverted it for your own use and you're no longer reflecting Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how many scriptures you quote and how right you are about headship if you take the wrong concept because remember the logos is the word with the including the thought God's thought when he mentioned it and when he put a man under uh to take the headship of a woman he was wanting man to reflect Christ's relationship with the church &gt;&gt; and when we start to by selfishness and arrogancy and start to say my way or the highway and I'm the man you do what I say with no consideration for the heart, for the love of a wife, then you've just taken the scriptures and perverted them &gt;&gt; and manifestation. &gt;&gt; But the moment we're married, all of the sudden, Amen. My a friend calls up, hey, you want to go here today? I mean, uh, you know, months before before we started the relationship, it was whether I wanted to go or not. It was all about my own feeling. Do I want to go out with my buddy tonight to dinner? Or do I not want to go out with my buddy tonight to dinner? But the moment I'm married and enter into this love covenant, this relationship, as soon as my buddy asks me, I'm starting to think, what do we have tonight? What is my wife got? Is it going to be okay with her? Would it be a hardship with her? Put her out in any way. Is this a responsible thing to do for her? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now I'm restraining my own desires and my own passions. Why? because I have a greater love than the love I have for myself. It's the love I have for my wife. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram took such a deep theological subject and he broke it down so simple. &gt;&gt; This is the way it's supposed to work that I will restrain my desires. I will tell myself no. Listen, don't think because you're saved and born again and filled with the Holy Ghost, every thought that passes through your mind is God and every desire you have is holy. &gt;&gt; Don't you dare. Don't trust your flesh for a second. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be deceived by that. Amen. But the relationship is correct. what what I do my works that I do for God the self-restraint the obedience to the word the giving up even uh uh desires of the flesh for God telling myself no amen that is because I love him and I want to please him not so I can go to heaven not not so I can get a reward and not because I'm afraid of punishment &gt;&gt; but simply because If he said it, there's a good reason he said it. And I love him and I trust him. &gt;&gt; I trust his word. I trust what he taught us. And I trust what he taught us through a prophet. &gt;&gt; I trust it. I don't think God would send a prophet and that prophet would start screaming out against different sins and different things that were going on in the Leoian church age. I don't think he would do that. Amen. And make himself untrustworthy unless that's exactly what was in his mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe I can trust him and even he even who he chooses to be the prophet of the age. &gt;&gt; I can trust his voice. &gt;&gt; And then there's something in me that wants to do his will. &gt;&gt; And listen, let's let's not be childish either. Let's not think that you'll never have another desire. &gt;&gt; Because we're still in flesh. &gt;&gt; We still have a carnal human spirit. You can still your body can still want something, but that doesn't mean that you want it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let's let's let's say that again slowly. &gt;&gt; Your body can still scra and want something, but that doesn't mean you want it. &gt;&gt; Because who's the real you? It's that seed gene of God on the inside. that it's that child of God that's been born again and is still living in a vessel of clay that was born under perversion and still has influence from the world. Amen. So, so listen, I I I'll give you this example. I'll give you another highly theological one because brother Brandon went so deep. I'll give you another one. Amen. I found that as I as I age, not old, but I can't say young. somewhere in the middle. &gt;&gt; I can't handle sugar and carbs like I used to. &gt;&gt; I don't know what's wrong with my metabolism. My body's completely backsliden and perverted and it doesn't work right anymore. But anyways, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; So, the reality is I've made a decision that if I'm going to be healthy and if I'm going to have longevity and I know God can pull my card at any time, but I've got to make some choices. Amen. for the right reasons. Amen. So that I can be productive and I can be healthy and I can be there for my family and I can be here for the church. So I have to avoid sugar and carbs &gt;&gt; because I know that that's not going to lead me down the right road. That there's a danger at the end of that. Amen. And you might be able to handle them fine, but I can't handle them very well at all. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That does not mean I don't want sugar and carbs. You set out a whole load of pies and you get the fruit pies and the stuff that I like and you and and and the small family brings ice cream. It's a lovehate relationship, brother. I love it. I hate it. I love it. I hate it. It doesn't mean I don't want it. It doesn't mean I don't have a craving for it. And just because I have a craving for it doesn't mean I have to cave into my craving and take it like my craving's right. But there's something else inside of me, a true me that says I don't want to go down that path because that path is not good. It's not healthy. It's going to harm me in the long run. So there's part of me that has to overcome another part of me. &gt;&gt; I mean, have you ever stood in front of the fridge and fought with yourself? &gt;&gt; Like you're nuts. Like there's two people. Like you really got the devil and an angel on either shoulder while you're standing there. Do it. Don't do it. Do it. Don't Don't do it. I You know, I'll walk an extra mile tomorrow. &gt;&gt; But yet I I make a decision not because I don't want it, but because I don't want it. &gt;&gt; I want it, but I don't want it. Has &gt;&gt; anybody ever been in that spot? &gt;&gt; I want it, but I don't want it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But now you can your body can crave something or or or or look at something or be attracted to something, but there's something else that's been born again on the inside that wants nothing to do with that. Nothing to do with the world. Doesn't have an attraction to it. Doesn't have a desire for it. Doesn't want it at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's stronger than just a desire not to eat or not that. It's a born-again experience that really at the root of you, there's nothing in you that wants the world. There's nothing in that seed that wants anything to do with Satan's Eden. Amen. Any desire comes from the outside man, not the new man, because that's a new creature with new desires. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the me that wants to reign in the flesh. That's the me that tells myself, "No, that's the me that says that's not pleasing to the Lord. We're not going to entertain that thought. We're not going to say those things. We're not going to go to those places. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. Brother Benham says this in Luke 7:47. He says, "Wherefore I say unto thee, her sins which are many are forgiven, for she loved much, but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little." This is why I said it's better to find ourselves when we start our journey with Christ as one of the thieves on the cross. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because when we realize what we are before redemption, Amen. We realize we were hopeless. We could never do anything to save ourselves. We were as lost as loss could be in this world, in this humanity. Amen. But the grace of God is what saved us. &gt;&gt; And if we could find ourselves as the thief on the cross, amen, that could just say, "Lord, I I'm condemned. I'm guilty. I've done everything wrong. A and there's nothing in me that's right. Amen. But Lord, &gt;&gt; when you come into your kingdom, remember me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just implore him. Amen. And then receive his mercy and receive his grace in our lives. And then, you know, I love this. This is the woman who washed Jesus' feet in Simon's house. Simon was a religious man who had, let's say, he had his home in order and his ducks in a row. And he didn't realize the depravity of his heart because he didn't believe in the Messiah. He didn't believe how lo he didn't understand how lost he was. Amen. But this woman who was a ranked sinner, she knew exactly how bad off she was. She knew exactly how hopeless her case was. And she knew exactly Amen. She wasn't accepted in the church. She wasn't even welcome into Simon's house because of her dirty life. Amen. So, she knew full well what she was. But she wasn't looking at what she was. She was looking at who this was that's sitting here. And this is the Messiah. This is Christ. This is the Lord. And she just listen. She just went in love to serve him. She didn't go for reward. She went for love. &gt;&gt; There was a revelation in her heart. Brother Benham said she just thought in her heart, I've got to get to him. What was moving her? There was a seed on the inside. Amen. That was pulsating when the word was made flesh in front of her. There was a reaction on the inside and she just had to get to him. It wasn't about I think he'll give me money, he'll give me a reward, he'll bail me out of my bad life. That I don't think those were preconceived ideas. There was something in her that had to respond to the word. And when she responded to the word, her action was an act of her faith that she believed that this was the Messiah and worthy to have his feet washed and he was rejected by everybody else. But something in her could not reject that man sitting there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And she was as filthy as filthy can be. She was the most unworthy person to wash his feet. She was less worthy than the footwash flunky that was the servant of of of Simon. &gt;&gt; But yet by faith by by an inspiration by something that was moving within her, she had to get to him. And when she got to him expressing her faith in him and wept at his feet and did a service unto him, Jesus said, Simon, her sins which are many are all forgiven her. &gt;&gt; Listen, Simon Simon prepared a feast. Simon invited the Lord. Simon fed him. Simon did a service to the Lord, but his service to the Lord didn't get him anything because it wasn't based on faith. It was just works. This woman, she did the Lord a service, but it had nothing to do with reward and it had nothing to do it had everything to do with faith. And what did she receive? She received forgiveness of her sins. She was saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then brother Brandham or And then the Lord Jesus Christ teaches us. He says, "Listen, her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little." Oh, if I if if I could just make this scripture more more real to me, &gt;&gt; if we could really realize what we are left to ourselves &gt;&gt; and how destitute and how broken and how how our heart is failed and when we are completely failed without Christ. If it wasn't for his grace, we are hopeless. &gt;&gt; We're all on the same page. Hopeless. Not that I have some willpower that can. No. Hopeless. &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for his grace, without grace, we wouldn't have faith to believe. Without faith to believe, we would never come to. We are hopeless. &gt;&gt; That's where this woman was. I don't want to be of those that feel like God chose me to be his bride because I was pretty good and I was already loving his word, so he just gave me a little more. So, I just came into the kingdom. Because that kind of love loveth back little. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; But but the one who realized and this is the one I want to be. The one who realizes I was a hopeless case. I was destined for hell. Every decision I made was a wrong decision. I had no ability to save myself or help myself. I kept falling into the same traps and I would for the rest of my life until I utterly ruined my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; If it was not for his grace, if it wasn't for him coming to me, if it wasn't for him giving me a seed of faith, if it wasn't for him, I'd be completely lost. And when I realize how destitute I was and how depraved I was and how helpless I was, Amen. It makes me want to do nothing but serve him and serve him and serve him and serve him. &gt;&gt; Amen. You take you go back to Brother Benham's marriage example. You know, you get a you get a a girl who's got a a high estimation of herself and she thinks she's a beauty queen and she's all doalled up all the time and she's always flirting and trying to attract guys and she thinks she's God's gift to mankind and she dupes some poor soul, amen, into marrying her and she gets married and now she sees that husband as her servant to provide her with fineries, provide her with all the elegance that she needs because in her mind, amen, this man chose me because I'm so great and now she can never move into loving that man right and serving him like a wife should serve her husband because in her mind she's special &gt;&gt; and she'll never be the right kind of wife because she'll never serve her husband. She wants her husband to serve her cuz she's special. &gt;&gt; Well, guess what? When we go to marry Jesus Christ with the same mentality, amen, he chose me because I was the prettiest. He chose me because I was the best. He chose me because I could believe his because I had a mental capacity to accept his gospel. No, no, no, friends. That's not why he chose you by grace. Despite all of your failures, by grace. And when you know you're married to him, by unmarited favor, you were going the wrong way. You weren't worthy of his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. When a you take you take a different story in marriage. You take the washer woman who was chose by the boy uh the son of the man who owned the armor company. &gt;&gt; Yeah. She was a poor girl stuck in poverty. She was now being mistreated by all her cousins because she was an orphan. Amen. She had no hope of ever rising above the position she was in. She was the chief servant amongst all servants. She didn't get the nicer dresses. She didn't have any money. She didn't have anything. She was living on the charity of family members and they were pushed her down to a place that was below them. And she had no hope of ever having a different life. That's the woman who washed Jesus's feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No hope. She was trying. She was trying to climb out. And with all her effort, she could never escape it. Here, this woman, Amen. But she she was just serving. She was just accepted her life. Amen. She was washing the dishes and they were getting ready for the dances and they were going to do all that and and she was put out of all of it. She wasn't accepted with them and wasn't allowed to come. &gt;&gt; But this man who was a mighty man, who was a rich man. Amen. He come down and above everybody else, he chose her. &gt;&gt; Not for her dress. I mean, not for her singing, not for her dancing, not for her talent show. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He chose her because there was something in him he was attracted to and he just loved her really for no good outward reason. &gt;&gt; It wasn't her status in life and her ability. He just chose her because he loved her. Listen, you you know, humanity and you know how people are. Amen. I believe with all my heart that girl, Amen. in and in in gratitude for what God had done for her and what her husband had done for her, I guarantee she had no problem serving her husband. &gt;&gt; And I don't want to see myself. Amen. Listen, the the the the truth of predestinating election is an absolute truth and it always will be true. But don't you dare forget that it was the segene of God in your soul that was elected and predestinated chosen before the foundation of the world. Not. Amen. Your flesh. &gt;&gt; God knew it would come in this flesh. But that doesn't make your flesh being right. &gt;&gt; Makes it wrong. Just as wrong as anybody else's is wrong, cuz you came the same way. &gt;&gt; We got to realize if it wasn't for what he did, I'm hopeless. Can't change my condition for forever be this way. But he chose. He knew before the foundation of the world. He came to me. He found me. He chose me. That's why these things are so important for us to remember. Because he who's forgiven much loveth much. &gt;&gt; I want to be one who loves much. &gt;&gt; I don't want to treat Jesus &gt;&gt; as though he was lucky to get me &gt;&gt; and that I think he made a good choice. And now I want him to serve me. &gt;&gt; I want him to keep me in comfort. And I want him to provide everything I need. And I want him to serve me because I'm pretty sure he made a good choice and he's lucky to have me. Now, I don't think we're going to ever say that to anybody. But we don't want to take that attitude. &gt;&gt; And I think it's I think it's possible should say it that way. I think we've seen it before where brother Ben says, "I I know my wife, you know, if I'll go out with this girl, my wife don't care. It's the wrong attitude. &gt;&gt; Even though she would forgive him, he says his attitude's completely wrong. He don't he don't love that woman right. &gt;&gt; And if I know that I can do whatever I want and God will forgive me for it and he loves me anyways, I don't love God, right? maybe I don't really understand grace. And that's what I think happens sometimes is we don't really comprehend grace because if we really comprehended grace, I think we would realize he is my all in all &gt;&gt; and he is my only hope and chance and I owe him everything. &gt;&gt; I owe him everything. Not in a way that I begrudgingly have to pay back a debt, but I owe him everything because I have nothing without him. And now I want to give him everything. &gt;&gt; This is what the Apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15. And last of all, he was seen of me also as one born out of due time. For I am the least of the apostles that I'm not me to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain. But I labored more abundantly than they all. Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. The Apostle Paul now recognizes, hey, listen. I was not worthy. I'm the least of the apostles and not worthy because of my deeds. He knows because he we we know about the conversion of Paul going absolutely the wrong way 100% contrary to the word of God and fighting the very thing he claimed to love. He was in a bad place. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he knew that he was least of the apostles and not worthy not meat to be called an apostle because of his deeds. But he knew by the grace of God he was what he was. And now he says I love I love the way he says this. But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than they all. He's saying, listen, because I understand where I came from and I wasn't worthy and I'm I shouldn't even be here right now, I gave all myself to the work he called me to. And then he checks himself &gt;&gt; and he says, "Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me." &gt;&gt; He said, "I didn't even do that by myself. Even me giving myself to him completely. Amen. Because of my gratitude for him, because of my unworthiness. And then then I I gave myself more to the labor than them all. But he but he checks himself. But not I. It was the grace of God that was with me. I can't even do that by myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. What do I want to give God? My absolute devotion and love. I want to give him first place preeminence on all my life as my gratitude for his salvation. As my recognition of what grace has done for me. Even that I can't do without his grace. &gt;&gt; I can't even get that right unless he helps me. &gt;&gt; So is my desire, but it's still his grace. &gt;&gt; Paul makes this statement of himself and and Filament or Phileman says Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ. Brother will pick up on this statement because brother Paul uses it in different places. He uses it again in Filament later, but he picks up on that statement and shows how Paul called himself a prisoner of Jesus Christ. And then he begins to expound on it and he says, "Why? He was a predestinated seed. God said, I have chose him." Yeah. And I'm going to show him what great things he'll suffer for my name's sake. I'll send him to the Gentiles and disgrace him in every way that they can be disgraced, but yet he'll bear my name. Paul went down then till he got all of his ecclesiastical stuff cut off of him down at the backside of the desert for three years and a half down there in Arabia until he learned the word and the word became he and he became a prisoner. He came back in chains of love. All my seminary experiences gone. I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ. Amen. Phileman, my brother, I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ. I only can speak and say what he tells me. God needs prisoners today that will prison yourself to his will, to his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, we can take what brother Bram says here in the last line. God needs prison. You say, "Yep, that's what God needs today." Amen. I'm going to become one of them because that's what God needs today. But the way it was done was by chains of love. Not chains not not chains of turning over a new leave, not chains of forcing yourself into something. It was actually a response of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. He bound himself by chains of love. Which means Paul was free to do anything Paul wanted to do &gt;&gt; because the bond that the chains that bound him to Jesus Christ were not chains that Jesus Christ put on Paul, but they were chains that Paul put on Paul to by love attach himself to Jesus Christ and be bound to Christ and to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ. And so now his whole life was subject to Jesus Christ by what? By works. No. Did he do works? Yes. But what was the motivation behind it? Love. &gt;&gt; It was this reciprocating love. He knew what he was and he knew where he was going and he knew what would have happened if he hadn't met the pillar of fire. Amen. And that he could not have made happen. That was the grace of God coming into his life. And he knew what he would be without that event. And so now he could bind himself by chains of love. It wasn't a begrudging thing. It wasn't a I have to do this and if I don't do this I won't. It was nothing like that for the Apostle Paul. And there was hardship involved. There was difficulty. There was self-denial. &gt;&gt; There was suffering. All of that. But Paul willingly went through all of that because of his gratitude for the grace of God. Amen. Nobody slapped chains on his wrist. He handcuffed himself to Christ. &gt;&gt; The jail cell was open. He went in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he closed the door behind him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because that's what he he wanted to serve God. &gt;&gt; And even that he couldn't do without the grace of God in his life. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just love it. Let's turn to uh Philippians 3 together. Philippians chapter 3. Philippians 3 and4 says, "Though I might also have confidence in the flesh, if if any other man thinkketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the law, a Pharisee, concerning zeal, persecuting the church, church, touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. But what things were gained to me? Those I counted loss for Christ. Yay, doubtless. And I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the And Paul was so willing to give up everything. Not because somebody stood up to next to him and says, "You've got to get rid of this and you got to get rid of that and you got to get rid of this and you got to get rid of that." But he says, "I count it all loss &gt;&gt; that I might win Christ. My reputation and my position and everything that I forego and everything that I let go and everything that I turn my back on, I count it but dumb. and don't want it anymore. I only want one thing. I want to apprehend this thing I've been apprehended by. I want to press towards a mark of the high calling in Christ. I want more of him. Amen. I want to give my life to him. I want to share my life with him. I want to do all I can for him because it was love. That to me is so important. That's the way I want to serve him. Friends, that's the desire of my heart. Abraham says he only reveals his word in the predestinated. Now when I use the word predestinate now it's a bad word to use public especially when we have mixed crowds between Armenians and Calvinist and I've asked you not to think I not to think I know it all but they're both wrong according to the scripture. Grace is what God did for me. Works is what I do for him. And the book of Titus 3:3 says, "For we ourselves, for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceiving, serving, diverse lust and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. But after that, the kindness of love of God our Savior toward men appeared, not by works of righteousness, which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our savior. That being justified by his grace, we should be made hes according to the hope of eternal life. This is a faithful saying, and these things I will, that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. Remember, Paul is teaching that your works has nothing to do with your salvation. &gt;&gt; We're on the same page. All right? Paul's not changing his mind to Timothy. Amen. But Paul clearly understands, Amen. where he stands. We are justified by his grace. He's sitting there telling Timothy once again that that we have been saved. We ourselves were in foolishness and disobed we were all of this. Amen. But after the kindness and love of God, our savior, amen, to man appeared not of works of righteousness, not by anything we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us. So he's telling Titus, your works has nothing to do with your salvation. Your works has nothing to do with God's love for you. God's love for you is secure from before the foundation of the world and will not change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he's establishing this first. &gt;&gt; But being justified by his grace, we should be hes according to the hope of eternal life. You've already got eternal life. He said, "This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men." It's like, so do I have to do it or do I not have to do it? I don't have to do works for salvation or to earn God's love. I don't have to do it to be part of his grace. I don't have to do it to have his grace bestowed upon me. But this is a good thing. &gt;&gt; This is your love for God. This is what the believers should be doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what's Paul saying. Be careful to maintain good works. Amen. There's so many churches today. Amen. They've moved over to grace to make grace disgrace where the grace of God puts no requirements on me. And because I have no requirements, I just go live exactly like the world lives. Like Leodysia, dress, act, talk, listen to, do everything else they do. And I'm banking on the grace of God. Amen. For everything. Because it's not by works. Amen. And brother Bam's going to show us in a minute. He says, "You're not even saved yet if you can live like that. &gt;&gt; You haven't even come to a revelation of what grace is. If you can live like that, you haven't even come to a revelation of what grace is. &gt;&gt; And I'm not the only one who says that. So, so just bear with me. &gt;&gt; He says in questions and answers, I'm your father in the gospel. As Paul said there, this is brother Brenam now talking to the church. I've begotten you to Christ and now I espouse you to Christ. That's engaged you to Christ as a chase virgin. Don't let me down. Don't let me down. You stay a chase virgin. How will I do it, brother Ben? Stay right with the word. live clean and pure, have nothing to do with the things of the world. If the love of it's in your heart, say, "Oh, Jesus, please take that away from me. I don't want to be like that. I don't mean just to to be some person that's saying this." I mean to be a genuine believer. Believe Jesus Christ and live for him every day. Don't do no evil. Now, a lot of times I speak of Calvinistic belief. Now, don't think that lets you loose to do anything you want to do. &gt;&gt; No. Because God is still God. He's still our father. Christ is still our husband. He still has instructions for us. And his instructions for us should be I mean it should be a delight for us to know what he wants. &gt;&gt; Amen. It should be a delight. Sometimes I'm amazed at how much my wife loves serving her family and what she'll go through and what she'll do to serve us. Amen. She'll she'll stay up late. She'll get up early. And sometimes I'm overwhelmed. Amen. Because I don't put those requirements on her. Nobody's demanding that she does that. In fact, there's things that around the house I would do myself. I don't mind doing them, but she doesn't want me to do them. She wants to do them for me. And sometimes I'm blown away about how much she wants to do for me. And it takes me back a little bit because her love is a sacrificial love, but she wants to do it not to earn anything for me because she doesn't need to earn anything from me. &gt;&gt; She does it purely based off love. &gt;&gt; And sometimes it takes my breath away. And when I see that kind of love and an earthly relationship, all of a sudden, I realize what what it is that my heart longs for to give back to Christ. I want to go the extra mile. I want to do the extra deed. I don't want to just check off the list of things I have to do. I want to do whatever can be pleasing to him. &gt;&gt; I want to do I don't want Listen, I I don't want somebody to give me the checklist. If you do this, this, and this, and this, you're a believer and you've pleased God. Listen, I I don't want to just check check. Now, I'm done. Now I can go on and do what I want the rest of the day. I fulfilled my obligations as a believer. I don't want to live like that. Amen. I want to live every minute. Is this pleasing to him? Is this pleasing to him? Is this pleasing to him? Not a rulebook, but a desire to please him in every situation because you can live a rulebook and be displeasing in your attitude and your actions &gt;&gt; because you're going to face situations that aren't spelled out. You're going to face situations that you don't have a quote for. You're going to come into circumstances that it's just going to be your desire to please him that'll help you navigate that situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Too many times we dive into the message and we try to find out, you know, I have this desire to do this. Now, I want to find out if it's acceptable in the message to do this. So, I don't see brother Bam say anything about this. So, I'm going to do this. And it's all based on a selfish desire to do something, not based on the desire to be pleasing to God. All right. &gt;&gt; And if you go to the message looking that way, you're going to find the loophole that you're looking for. &gt;&gt; I guarantee it. You look long enough, you'll find the loophole you're looking for. I don't want a loophole. &gt;&gt; I just want to know what's pleasing to him. &gt;&gt; I just want to be sensitive to his spirit. I want to listen to the voice of God, right? And he explains to us what God likes, what God doesn't like, and the character of God. And I want that to become a reality to me to where every situation I face, I'm not looking at what do I want versus what I'm allowed to do. I'm looking at what do I want versus what he wants. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; That's the way I want to live my faith. That's the desire of my heart. And I failed in it thousands of times. I'll probably fail in it again. But in my soul, that's what I'm longing to be to him. I'm longing to be chained by chains of love. Not a have to on anything, but a great desire to be pleasing to him. &gt;&gt; I believe that's the desire of the bride in the end times. She's going to be a genuine true bride of Jesus Christ. And he was a true son of God because he only did that which pleased the father. &gt;&gt; So, how am I going to be a true genuine bride of Jesus Christ when I only do that which pleases my husband? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the life I want to live. &gt;&gt; And so, it's it's not simple. It's not simple. Do all this and don't do all that. It's more than that. It's a desire of the heart, a reflection of the heart. And the message of grace, the prophet says, "We are saved by grace and that through faith, not by works." Works shows that you have been saved. You catch that statement? Works shows that you have been saved. But what saves you is the grace of God. Grace saves you. Grace is what God does for you. works is what you do for God to show appreciation of what God did for you. But but by grace are you saved. Romans 12:1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service, not even above and beyond. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just can presenting your bodies as a living sacrifice. &gt;&gt; That means completely dying to self all the time. selfish desires, selfish wants. Amen. And live holy, that means separated, consecrated, and acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. &gt;&gt; And be not conformed to this world, but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. For I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. I love this. I'm going to read this th this verse three again because I don't want to go so fast we miss it. For I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to. but to think soberly according as God had dealt to every man the measure of faith. We don't think I'm this and I'm this and let's be sober minded. Let's not, you know, be too far gone in our mind. Let's come back to sobriety. I'm only this because God has dealt to me a measure of faith. &gt;&gt; That that's to be sober minded. Don't think more of let's not think more of ourselves than we ought to. I'm special and I'm like that's that is true. But that's only true by the grace of God. That's not true by anything I've done. &gt;&gt; Not one thing I've done puts me in the position he put me in before the foundation of the world. He did it independent of my actions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we're going to offer our lives as a reasonable service to him, we recognize that offering my life is just a reasonable service. It doesn't put me in a better position. &gt;&gt; I'm here by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's dealt to me the measure of faith. So, I ought not to think of myself more highly. I not I don't want to go back to being the wife that thinks he's lucky to have me for a wife. &gt;&gt; I want to be sober minded and realize he just chose me. He could have chose somebody else, but he chose me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here you him. It says, "When you really love God, my brother, you don't want to get by with nothing. &gt;&gt; Please God, let that be my heart." &gt;&gt; When you really love God, my brother, you don't want to get by with nothing. You love him. And you serve him because that you love him because that he loves you. Period. &gt;&gt; End of story. Not because I have to do anything to earn his love or anything to climb to a better position, but simply because I love him. And I love him because he loved me. We love him because he first loved us. In the message, you must be born again. He says, "So not trying to squeeze in a Calvinistic belief." Now, you see, I'm not in saying this now that I'm talking to a legalist people. That's not it at all because I'm a legalist, too. So, Brother Brandon preaches grace and Calvinism all the time, but he calls himself a legalist. I love it. But I believe this that Calvin had something and so did Armenian have something and they both had something but they run off the deep ends of it. The Calvinist says, "Well, I'm saved and just that settles it." His life proves that he isn't. When he isn't saved and the legalist says, "I've got to do this and I must do this and I must do that." Then if you're not born again, you're still not saved. &gt;&gt; So there you are. It's between in the middle of the road is where we've got to stay. What are you? What Calvinism is, what grace is, is what God did for you. What works is is what you do for God in appreciation of what he did for you through grace. That's the whole answer. Then if I'm saved, then I live like I'm saved. But I couldn't live like I but I could live like I was saved and not be saved. See, so it's the fact then that brings it to the spot that we must be born again. So the born again experience tells us what we are. It doesn't mean I believe in shouting and all the manifestations and demonstrations of the spirit, but yet that's not it. See, it's something different from that. It's a new creature, something in the heart. &gt;&gt; It's not that I do all these works or I have to do all of this or or I'm just saved and I can do anything I want. It's none of that. It comes down to a born-again experience where the revelation strikes you and you realize who you are and what God did for you and what you are without him. And then there's a love response that comes from the soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the born again experience. And then the new life, new nature doesn't want the world. Doesn't want the selfish desires of the past. Doesn't want the lust of the flesh. It wants to please the Lord. That's the born again experience. He says in 1 John 4:19 says we love him because he first loved us. If a man say, "I love God," and hateth his brother, he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God who he has not seen? And this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God loveth his brother also. If I could, I just want to take a minute and I want to share another thought with you if that's okay. I want to tie it in with this, but just another side thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we talk about the response to grace, I've been talking about love and I've been talking about the response of love and giving our lives out of love. But there's another response to grace that I see. This is just me. But my response to God's grace for me dictates how I treat everybody else. &gt;&gt; Because if I realize what God did for me and what I am without him, &gt;&gt; it makes it impossible for me to go around condemning everybody else. &gt;&gt; It changes my approach. It changes my mentality. It changes everything because but by the grace of God, there go we &gt;&gt; Where would I be without him? I mean, where we we would be just like Paul. Where would I be? I mean, where would Paul be if God had not come to him in a pillar of fire? Where would I be if God had not come and brought the true revelation around and woke me up to the real? If God's grace had not come to me to bring me to the word, where would I be? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if God can do that for me, and if I could just remember what I was before, &gt;&gt; there's no way that I could look down my nose at humanity and condemn everybody else walking around. Amen. If God can have grace on me, God can have grace on them. They can be a recipient of grace, too. Amen. So, it changes my dealings with humanity. This to me is is a response to grace also. Amen. In Luke, he says, Luke 17:3, "Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him. And if he repent, forgive him. And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him." I love this because how many times have I repented to God? &gt;&gt; How many times have I failed him in one day? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many times in one day have I told him I'm sorry? &gt;&gt; And if God will forgive me and have grace on me, then what right do I have to not extend grace for a brother? I have no right to treat somebody else with no grace because I've been God's bestowed so much grace upon me continually. &gt;&gt; Continually. Listen, I don't want God to treat me the way I've treated other people. I want God to treat me according to this word. &gt;&gt; And I want him to give a grace in my life to help me treat others the way he's treated me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that I can be an extension of his life to others. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if my brother offend me, how many times? 70 times seven in a day. But yet he turned and repent, forgive him. Amen. And don't ask him to pay a price. Don't ask him to I mean, we don't put him in in in in lockdown and put him in prison and make him serve so much and then pay back. No, remember the brother Brandham told the uh uh not Jesus Christ told the parable and the parable he said those all uh there was a debtor and they all had debts and they owed to the to the Lord and and the Lord uh forgave a man of his debt. He kneel down before him. He said please forgive me. I got women and children. I can't pay the debt. Forgive me my debt. And he says he forgave him. That forgiveness was an act of grace &gt;&gt; because his Lord had every right to persecute him, every right to sell him into slavery. every right. I mean, he he this man did nothing to get forgiveness, &gt;&gt; nothing to have his debts abolished. He couldn't have earned it. He couldn't pay for it. He couldn't pay it back. He had nothing to to He had nothing to help himself in this situation. So, the Lord said, "I forgive you of your debt." And forgave him of it all. &gt;&gt; And this man runs out and it was a huge sum of money. This man runs out and he finds a friend who owes him a tiny amount of money. And that tiny amount of money, he takes him by the throat and he threatens to take him into the magistrate to have him locked up until every penny was paid. And the servants of the master went back and told him what this this unruly servant did. And he called him up and he said, "I freely forgave you of all this and you wouldn't forgive a friend of this small debt." &gt;&gt; Grace has been bestowed upon us. &gt;&gt; It should be nothing for us to bestow grace on Amen. &gt;&gt; Everyone else, &gt;&gt; not just each other in the church. Of course, it should be our brothers and sisters, but it should go beyond our brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Cuz I don't know who's who. And I don't know who's in God's economy, but I know I receive grace. Anybody else can. &gt;&gt; God can save me. He can save anybody. He can save the vilest. He can save the most unruly. He can save the filthiest &gt;&gt; and make them white as snow. So it should change my response to grace, my understanding of grace, my re revelation of grace should change the way I view my brothers and sisters and view the world. In Ephesians 4:32 says, "And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you." &gt;&gt; This is how he tells us to act. This is how he tells us we should respond to his forgiveness by forgiving one another. In 1 Corinthians 6:9, he says, "Now know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolattors, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkers, nori revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God." And such were some of you. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Let us never forget that truth. &gt;&gt; And such were some of you, but ye are washed. But you are sanctified. But you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a reminder he lays down. Listen, don't don't be deceived. None of these people are going to inherit the kingdom of God. But that doesn't mean we go out in the world and write it. You're out. You're out. You're out. You're out. because he makes this this statement clause that will stop us from that attitude. He says, "But such were some of you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And don't forget it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you are washed. You're sanctified. If God could capture me and pull me out of that life, he can pull anybody out. In the great commission, he says, "Though he's absolutely wrong, before you leave the throne of God, you'll be feeling sorry for that man." Brother Bam's telling us, if somebody's done you wrong and really done you wrong and you don't know why they've done it, you just take them to the throne of God and you stand there with them shouldertoshoulder. &gt;&gt; And listen to what he says. He says, "Before you leave the throne of God, you'll be feeling sorry for that man. You'll be sympathizing with that brother. And when you get back down here where earth again, you'll go over to that brother and shake his hand because you know what he's been through. You can't stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody. &gt;&gt; I don't believe. No sir. Even if he's a rank sinner. &gt;&gt; And what about a brother that has made a mistake? Though I say he's wrong, sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not wrong. But if he is wrong, well, if we will take him to the throne of God, standing there shoulder-to-shoulder with our brother, knowing he's immortal, and maybe his destination rest upon our attitude towards him. When we come back from the throne of God, we'll realize that we're everyone guilty and we all need help one from the other. &gt;&gt; I believe the revelation of grace changes our approach to people. changes the way we approach. It doesn't mean there's no correction. Paul, listen, Paul was the one who taught grace. Brother say Paul was the apostle, the prophet who separated law from grace and established the church under the grace covenant of Abraham. Amen. And set it up that way without works. It was Paul who did that. But it was Paul who taught the church how to administer church discipline to somebody who wasn't living the word. &gt;&gt; So it doesn't mean there's no correction. It doesn't mean there's no calling out out against sin. It doesn't mean that there's not things that are still wrong and things God wants us to do. It has nothing to do with that. Amen. It has to do with the fact that we we we by love want to serve God. And if we make a mistake, God has not kicked us out of grace. He's not taking our name off the book. God still loves us. Amen. And he's going to bring us back into fellowship with him. And if he does that for me over and over and over again, he'll do it for my brother. &gt;&gt; Remember Paul? Remember the Apostle Paul, he's telling a story to the Corinthian, a story, he's giving instruction to the Corinthian church that there's a man there that's committed a sin that's not even mentioned among the Gentiles that he would have his father's wife. And Paul says, "Listen, that's wrong. And you guys not dealing with it, that means you're puffed up, you're proud, and you think you can just bear with it." He says, "Listen, when you're gathered together in my spirit with you, commit such a one to Satan for the destruction of flesh." He's telling them church discipline. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he expects them to administer it. But then we come later in Corinthians and we find out that this man repented with sorrow. He made it right. And there was some who were keeping him at arms length. And Paul comes back to the one who told them to put him out. Now he rebukes them for not taking him back in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love the word of God. Amen. There's nothing that my brother can do that that God cannot reconcile. God cannot bring him in because God's forgiven me of all kinds of stuff. &gt;&gt; And listen, most of the thing God forgives us for, nobody else knows. If we had a list, &gt;&gt; if we had a list of everything God has forgiven you for and we could pass it out before church on a day we had to make a judgment, &gt;&gt; I think we'd be a little softer in our approach. &gt;&gt; I think we'd be more retrospect. I don't think we would be riding on our high horse end to condemn. &gt;&gt; Paul wanted correction for the saving of the soul to save a brother because of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the brother Amen. When the brother repented and wanted to come back, it was love and grace that wanted to be restored. The whole purpose was to be one. And it was not condemnation. The whole purpose was oneness. salvation, healing was the whole purpose. &gt;&gt; And so the message of grace, the the revelation of grace to me, the true revelation, it demands a response. Not demands a response in the way I did this, you have to do that. That's not what I mean by demands response. I mean the true revelation of what God did for us of grace. We cannot help but respond to that. &gt;&gt; When we really catch a revelation of what grace really is and what God did for us, there is no way we cannot respond to that. There's no way we cannot give him our love in our life. There is absolutely no way we can't. Amen. Because his love is drawing it out of us because of what he's done for us. And it changes the way we talk about one another. Changes the way we deal with one another. Changes the way we deal with all of humanity. because of our revelation of God's grace. Amen. If you could turn to Zechariah with me, I want to finish one one last thought and we'll finish with this. Zechariah chapter 4. We're going to go to Zechariah chapter 4 and we're going to start reading from verse 6. says, "When he answered and spake unto me, saying, this is the word of God of the Lord unto Zerubabel, saying, not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord of hosts. Who art thou, oh great mountain before Zerubabel, thou shalt become a plain, and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, grace, grace unto it." Brother Brandham takes this scripture and and he brings it into a message called the message of grace. He preached in in o uh August of 1961 and he refers to this scripture and I love the way he referred to it because here we see a crying of grace grace. Amen. Not just grace but grace grace. It puts double emphasis and everything in the Bible that they wanted to be heavily emphasized was repeated like verily verily. So here the emphasis is on grace, grace, grace. And it has to do with Zerubabel. And Zerubabel, Amen, is the prince. He's the governor that's over Jerusalem at the time of coming out of Babylon. They're returning from Babylon. Amen. After they've they've fallen away from God. The temple's destroyed. They've gone captive in the Babylon. Now the a remnant of them is returning and they're going to rebuild the temple. And Zerubabel is the captain. He's the leader, the governor under that rebuilding process. and he's going to he's going to lay the foundation, but he's also going to bring forth the headstone or the capstone with shoutings of grace, grace. And God wants them to know that this is grace. &gt;&gt; This return and this restoration is grace. So, brother Bam picks it up in the message of grace. I love this. He says, "We are we are all acquainted with this scripture that reads the Bible. We know that this was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple and Zerubbabel was a great prince amongst the people who had laid the foundation of the building. Now I want you to put on your spiritual thinking anointed jackets this morning as we think. And this great prince had determined to rebuild the house of the Lord. And then when he did he had laid the foundation. Now, there's a reason the prophet tells us to put on your spiritual thinking anointed jacket &gt;&gt; because he wants us to understand something more than what happened in the book of Zechariah and what happened hundreds of years ago. He wants to bring it right up to what's going on right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says now he laid the foundation. And as we read on farther, we find out that God said Zerubabel has laid the foundation with his hands. He also shall bring forth the headstone. I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone. He shall bring forth the headstone. And we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the chief cornerstone. And he's also the headstone. Now, if we will think for a few minutes, the seventh church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers. In other words, rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit. Not by power, not by might, but by my spirit. He's quoting Zechariah. By my spirit, sayith the Lord, not by organization, not by denomination, but by the Holy Spirit. God will bring forth the church in the last day. Zerubabel the prince with Joshua was the one that was to bring forth this headstone. He had laid the foundation. He had to took the people back to the foundation in type. Brother Re's telling us now, this seventh angel is going to do the same thing that Zerubbabel is doing. He's tying the ministry of Zerubbabel to the ministry of the seventh angel. and the ministry of the seventh angels, the seventh church age messenger which is William Brham and he came to do what? Bring us out of Babylon which was denominationalism &gt;&gt; and bring us back to a restoration of the temple of God. What is the temple of God? The church is the temple of God. You are the habitation of God. You are the temple of the Holy Ghost. And he goes back to the foundation because Paul says, "I laid the foundation." And he brings us back to the foundation that Paul laid. That's why brother Brenham taught what Paul taught. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tied together the loose ends. And so he brought us back. Amen. And begin to build on that. But at the end of his ministry, he's going to bring forth. Amen. What? Christ again. The headstone's going to come down to cap off this church, to cap off this temple in the end time under the ministry of the seventh angel. And what is going to be crying? Amen. Unto that unto that that that that headstone that's coming down, the headship that's coming to the church. It's going to be crying out grace, grace unto it. Amen. Because this building realizes it's your grace. Your grace. A double emphasis on grace. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a church, a bride at the end time. And she's going to know she had nothing to do with it. It's purely by the grace of God. And we've come to the capping of the the pyramid, the capping of the temple, the headship of Christ to unify with his body. And what is the what is the major declaration at that time? Grace. &gt;&gt; Grace. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the church had went into ruin. Why? Because they took wrong ideas. &gt;&gt; They left the word of God. They left what Paul had taught. They added to. They took away. They got deceived by the Antichrist spirit. They went far away and did horrible things and made grace a disgrace. And they they they trashed the word of God. They did all of that. And why didn't God just leave them like that? because he had a predestinated plan and he had grace. Amen. And by his grace, he said, "I will restore." &gt;&gt; That wasn't because anybody earned it. That was because he he had already put his love upon his elect and already put grace upon them. &gt;&gt; That's why when we come to the end of the message, Amen. What is the capping off? What is the response from Zerubabel? What is the response? What's being cried unto this headstone that's coming down? The cry is grace, grace. We don't deserve this. We haven't earned this. We are unworthy creatures, but you're choosing to live in us. You're choosing to unify with us. You're bringing us into the invisible union. And the only thing that we can cry at the capping time is grace. Grace, marvelous, abundant, overwhelming grace. How could we as human beings making mistakes? How could we, those of us who hands have done such evil, minds have thought such wickedness, mouth have spoke such evil things? How dare we say that we're the bride of Jesus Christ and the tabernacle and dwelling place of God? How dare we, as filthy as we have been, and willfully so, how dare we say that? There's only one way we can say it. It's not by intellectualism. It's not by merit. It is by grace. Grace. abundant grace. There's no way the bride in the end time could feel special like I'm special and God chose me cuz I'm special. No. God chose me despite how despicable I was. But he did it by his grace. &gt;&gt; He had before the foundation of the world chose me. He had placed something in me to sure his choice won't get lost. And it's by grace through faith. &gt;&gt; And that not of ourselves. It is the gift of God. I say God, help us keep the true attitude of love and response to grace by a true revelation of grace. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham goes on to say, "In the message of grace, but now according to the prophecy, there will come the headstone." And I want you to notice that when the headstone comes, the prince that's going to cry out the message will cry out, "Grace! Grace! For it's by grace are we saved, that not of works, lest any man should boast. And the message of grace has been tramped under the feet of men until it's become a disgrace. Some of them runs out on eternal security. Some runs out into oh everything. But the true message of grace remains the same. And there's where Satan tries to knock it out from the church. But it's the grace of God that we're all saved by. One of the most fundamental teachings in the word of God becomes the great cry when the headstone is descending. One of the basics, the basic understanding that in the New Testament that we're saved by grace depart apart from works. At the end of it all, Christ is the cornerstone and the buildings all fitly framed together with Paul laid the foundation and then brother Brandham brought us back to the foundation of what Paul taught. build back the church from there all the way to the capping time where the headstone comes down. And when it comes down, all the revelations and all that build upon this word comes back to a declaration at the capping time. A cry that goes out, grace, grace. &gt;&gt; Oh, how we should love grace. Brother Benham calls the church the bridegrace because it's all by grace. You and I can't be bride by effort, merit, good conduct, knowledge, skill, right living. We can only be bride by grace. And if God can have grace on me, we can have grace on everyone else. Last scripture, musicians, if you want to come, please. And brother John. For this is the love of God that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievious. How can they be when we have a revelation of grace? How can the Lord's commandments be grievious? When when brother Brandham, he tells us a story. He takes us back in the Old Testament to when David and his mighty men were holed up in a cave. And between them and Bethlehem was a garrison of Philistines. And that garrison of Philistines was was there and they were trapped in the spot. And and David, he was thirsty. He was hot. Brother Beam dramatizes the whole thing and begins to share it. And and he says, "Oh, I just long. Oh, I just would love to drink from the water of the well of Bethlehem one more time. And and brother Ben Brandham said, there's three men that overheard him say that. That wasn't a command from a captain to soldiers. That wasn't anything that had to be carried out. That wasn't a command. That wasn't an order. That was a desire that was expressed. And and when that desire was expressed, there was three. And brother Brandham said they three, they loved him so much that his least desire was a command to them. And he said they took off without saying a word to anybody. And those three, they fought their way through an entire garrison of Philistine sand soldiers cutting right or left, went to the well, dipped a bucket of water out, and fought their way all the way back. They hazarded their lives. They risked every they listen you realize they risked absolutely everything because there was a man named David that they loved so much and respected so much that just his desire became a commandment to them. They weren't bound by a pecking order. They weren't bound by a general and subordinates. They were bound by chains of love. Amen. &gt;&gt; And chains of love moved them to do what is is it moved them to do what is irrational, irresponsible, moved them beyond what would ever be expected of a human being. But what motivated them? It was their love and desire to please David. It was their desire to serve him. They loved him that much. Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us to be Hey, listen. If that's an earthly love for an earthly man who was res resembling the king, representing the king that would come, what about when we're serving the true king? What about when we're married to the through the son of David? Amen. What about him? Can we have the same desire that it's not what I have to do? It's not what he makes me do. It's not what the orders are. But if I see the slightest desire, oh God, help me to give my life to please him. Help me to give my life. Why? Because I have to know because I love him that much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has fought for me. He has saved me. He went into the pit. He He overcame. He slew Goliath. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's coming to his kingdom. He's allowed me &gt;&gt; to be one of his mighty men. Listen, that's the way I want to serve my Lord. Your least desired to me to just to me that's the response to grace. That's a true revelation of grace. Not that I can do whatever I want. I can make my own decisions. Of course, you can. God doesn't force anything. But oh, when I lay down my rights, I become a lamb. When I give up my life and when I surrender all, that's when I show God, I I understand what you did for me and this is the least I can do for you. And God bless you all. Let's stand together. All I can say at the end of this is God help me. Amen. &gt;&gt; What's in my heart, what my desire is, my great longing to please him, to sacrifice myself, to stop giving in to the the whims of the flesh, to to to to give up anything that's selfish, to give myself completely to him. That desire is there, the want is there, but oh, I can only do it by his grace. So, I'm asking, Lord Jesus, would you please come and make this desire in my heart a reality in my life? I can't do it. Even though I want to, even though I've been born again, even though I have the desire, I can't do it without his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads and pray. Lord Jesus, we thank you for your grace. God, we live in the hour, Lord, where we've heard the cry, grace, grace. God, you established the foundation on grace. You've built up your bride through seven church ages. You've come to the capping off with the great revelation of yourself. And that great revelation that comes with the shouting of grace. Grace. Not just an understanding of grace that was in the foundation, but through it all at the end when we look back and see where the church has always gone wrong, where your people has always failed, where you've brought us from. And by your love and grace, you covered our sins. And you brought us out again and again and again. And you built us up. You sent a prophet, Lord. And you gave us a heart to believe. And you've done a restoration work that we could never do ourselves. When we look at that Lord, there was grace at the foundation, but there's something in our hearts crying grace. Grace at the capping. This is nothing but pure grace. And God, I love you, Lord. You know my heart. God, I long to serve you. I long, Lord. I I I get so disappointed in myself because I see selfishness. I see self-des. And I see little excuses I make to allow myself little desires. And Lord, that's not really what I want. But Lord, from the depths of my soul, what I want is to be like those three captains that served David. Lord, if I just knew that's what you wanted, commandment or no commandment, that's what I want to do. God, would you bestow your grace upon me and help me overcome my flesh and help this desire in my heart, Lord, to come into manifestation? For I want to cry, Lord, seeing your capstone descended in this day. I want to cry grace, grace, abundant grace. And I want that revelation of grace to have an effect in my life. God, help us as we deal with your people, as we deal with humanity. May the grace you bestowed upon us, may we bestow that upon others. Lord, may we be tenderhearted, forgiving as you've forgiven us. May we never forget, Lord, may we be sober minded and never think of ourselves more highly than we ought to. But may we realize, Lord, that this is nothing but your grace in our lives. Not any merit of our own or works that we have done. There's no boasting and work, Lord. There's only boasting and grace. We're bragging on you for you've done it all. Your shoulders were broad enough. Your back was strong enough to bear our iniquities and sins. And you did it yourself. And Lord, we're so thankful. We love you. Bless your people as we go from here. May these realities go deeper and deeper into our souls. And may the outflow become a life that reflects this word. We love you, Father, and we ask your blessings in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Brother John. Marvelous grace of our loving Lord. It's grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt. For yonder on Calary's clown out there where the blood of the lamb was spilled. Praise God. Grace, grace that will garden and cleans within grace. Praise. God's grace. grace that is greater than all our seed. Amen. I'd like to sing this again, but I I just want to bow our heads and pray for the fellowship that we're about to have that God's presence would remain from here into the fellowship and we'd feast on the things that we've heard. Let's pray together. Lord Jesus, God, as we've set this day aside, Lord, to spend the day together as a body, God, you have so fed us on your word and we're so thankful for the truth and reality. I now pray that you would bless, Lord, the food we're about to partake of and bless the fellowship. And God, may you be the central theme of all of our fellowship. For we recognize you abiding in these tabernacles of flesh. As we fellowship with one another, may we recognize what's going on deeper, but its attributes connecting again that came from your mind and now we're enjoying Lord fellowshipping with you and our brothers and sisters. May there be a sweet atmosphere and presence and may you bless us and may we take courage from it and strength from the fellowship. May we go and render to you back a life of service, Lord, as our love gift back to you. We thank you for this opportunity and pray you'd bless us in it. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. And God bless you. And I just want to remind you any visitors here, you're very welcome to stay. We'd love to have you join us. And also, if we could let our seniors go down first in line so they don't have to stand. Amen. God bless you all. We'll see you in a little bit. Oh sin and despair like the sea waves cold threatened the soul with infinite loss. Grace that is greater. Yes. Grace untold points to the reuge the mighty cross. Praise God. Grace that will pardon and bliss with the grace. Praise God's grace. Grace that is greater than all our sin and dark is the sea that we cannot hide. What can I wash it away? Oh Lord, there is flowing a crimson time wher snow you may be today great praise God praise to Garden [Music] within grace praise. God's grace, grace that is greater than all our sin, oh marvelous, infinite, matchless grace, freely bestow on all who You that are longing to see his face. Will you this moment his praise receive grace? Praise God. Grace, grace that will pardon and place within grace. Praise God. Grace that is greater than all our sin. Grace, praise.
