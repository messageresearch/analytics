========================================

when Jesus resurrects from the dead is seen of his disciples he gathers them together he speaks to them right before he leaves in Acts chapter 1 he says tear you in Jerusalem and wait for the promise of the father that I spoke to you about what is the promise of the father he spoke to him about this was the promise that the comforter is coming right he he said it many ways in many ways he said my father will come to you and I will come to you and we'll make our Abode in you all right now brother Brandon is preaching Christ is the mystery of God reveal after the opening of The Seven Seals and he's talking about the day in which we live in today and he's going to grab the same scripture amen and he's going to bring the same scripture to a fulfillment today he said Jesus said at that day that's this day at that day when when this Revelation is made known you will know that I am in the father and the father in me I in you and you in meall when the Revelation is made manifest at that day you shall know that I and the father are one I am in the father and the father is in me then when the revelations comes forth then it's I in you and you and me there you are see the manifold three-fold manifestation what for what for to bring it back praise God back to what back to what it was at Pentecost amen amen praise God Amen now oh God help me I get so fooled that I don't know how to bring it out it just gets so full so you're going to have to bring it out work a little harder now praise God at that day at the Feast of Pentecost that's right when they were hiding in the upper room when they were afraid of the Jews when they weren't certain what to do when they had this confusion now they're waiting and they don't know exactly what they're waiting for they know exactly what it's going to look like don't what it's going to happen and then they're nervous about the authorities and they've got all this going on listen at that day they knew that he was in the father and the father was in him they knew that they knew he was the Messiah they knew he was the son of the Living God they knew he alone had the words of eternal life they knew he had died and that he had resurrected and that he ascended on high they knew all of that they had faith in all of that they witnessed to that and they believed it all but it seems like they needed something a little higher in the Revelation because that Revelation had them hiding that Revelation had them uncertain that Revelation I mean still had Peter going back to fishing and all kinds of stuff but they needed the next step in the Revelation and that next step in the Revelation would come in that day you'll know that I'm in the father you and me and I in you now you're part of the mystery you're part of the plan what changed it Pentecost at Pentecost God by filling them with his Spirit made them the Fulfillment of the word and part of the prophecy then they rush out with boldness then they know the word then they speak the word then they preach with boldness then they look into the then they look unto the lame man that says look unto us look unto us why they're now part of it it's inside of them they're in Christ and Christ is in them and it changes everything for them and at this day amen at that day that's this day
