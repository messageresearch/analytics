you're standing let's take our bibles and turn to the book of ephesians and i just want to while we're turning there thank everybody who came out to brother tommy's celebration on sunday and everybody who was able to help it was a real blessing amen and i think everybody who was there really enjoyed it i enjoyed worshiping and singing in the pavilion and it was good to hear brother tommy's voice leading in worship again and i was refreshed by it and enjoyed it very much he and sister barb have gone to their daughter charity remember the richest place for a visit so they're not here right now but we thank god that we were able to enjoy that together also i want to let you know that brother emmanuel sabasi will be traveling this friday to northern idaho to go to that group he goes to occasionally to minister for them so i know he'd cover your prayers he'd appreciate it if you'd be holding him up in prayer for traveling mercies in for the ministry this weekend man let's look at ephesians chapter 4 verse 11. we're going to continue with the same thought and just maybe take a little different vein but in the same same general direction ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men in the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into unto him and all things which is the head even christ so the goal all along has been to grow into the head to come into the full stature of christ let's bow our head and ask the lord's blessing over the word lord jesus we thank you father for this opportunity to come lord and read your word and father we ask all that you would come now and just minister unto us that you would speak things lord that that would direct us in the path that we should walk that would encourage us lord in the way you want us to live that would open our eyes lord and help us to see more clearly i pray you take preeminence and you would use this vessel for your glory hear through our ears lord and help us to grow by this message today in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated amen i just want to start with a quote in reading from blasphemius names it says the first foundation is faith second add to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge from knowledge temperance from temperance patience to patience godliness from godliness brother love brotherly kindness and then love being the capstone seven of those things seven church ages see seven stars of the church ages and all of it is tempered together by the holy spirit now that's what it takes to become a servant of christ christ builds his church in seven church ages his bride a person woman church seven church ages constitute and make the bride some out of this age and some out of that age and some out of that agent all together and shaping it like a pyramid so brother venom is taking this he's drawing an analogy here from statue of a perfect man he's now preaching blasphemous names but he's saying now god is building the individual amen from faith and all of these characteristics are building in and being molded and locked in amen until they come to the to the full stature of christ the full measure of a mature son or daughter of god up to adoption to the capping off amen of the great capstone of love the capping off saying this is this is one that i can now use they can speak for me they can do a work in my place amen but he's saying the way he built the individual is also the way he built his bride he's built his church through seven church ages amen and bringing them up and and he describes it so many different ways but you know coming from the feet through the thighs to the to the arms all the way up to the shoulders and to the head and he says that's the way he's been building his bride through seven church ages so he takes this uh growing uh individual and growing the church and capping it off and he he relates them to one another and while we're here i want to turn to uh ii peter let's turn to second peter chapter one and he says he built his bride through seven church ages he's got these uh these virtues that are here and and he's had seven church ages and he ties it together with seven messengers coming all the way up but let's look here at second peter chapter 1 verse 5. and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue so faith number one virtue number two virtue knowledge knowledge temperance temperance patience patience godliness calling this brotherly kindness so now we've come to seven so brother branham is typing these virtues with god bringing us to a mature an adopted son a place son he's doing the same thing with the church bringing the church up through seven church ages to a placing to an adoption amen and he says seven virtues and and he's saying seven church ages and seven messengers but but peter's not done we come to seven the seventh is brother the kindness and it says in verse seven and to to and to god in his brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity love divine love agape love charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ so we see brother i'm showing building up through seven says seven virtues and he says seven church ages but there's a great capping off of that and we can't miss the capping off as number eight and it's the whole thing amen it's not i mean i say if we could say it this way it's not an additional virtue all of these virtues come out of god's love amen god is love it is the very nature of love the very head the capping off the thing that builds each one of these comes out of that capstone of love amen and so the eighth is back to him the headship amen christ love and so now we see i just want you to see that i want you to see that number eight and i don't want you to miss that as we go on a little bit farther he says in the message desperation and all the things that he hasn't done now through the ages in the church ages he is now doing back to the word so what he wasn't doing all the things that or he says were left off back there he says or that he hasn't done through the church ages he is now doing back to the word because the messages and the messages and the messages has to wind up in the entire word and the last days the seven seals being opened was to pick up every straggle that's been left off in it and make the whole thing in one great big body of the bride that them who lived back there was not perfect until this church be perfected this bride group in the last days to bring them in and all together be taken up so brother branham is showing us that there's been a there's been a building amen from the ephesians church age all the way through there's been a building up a building up into the stature of the measure of christ's stature the fullness of christ till we all grow into the head which is the capstone which is charity which is love amen and now this bride in the end time has got to come to a headship amen and this bride has to manifest the headship the capping off the ceiling together of the entire of all the church ages have to come up to this amen and when this church comes into perfection it'll bring them all in and bring the resurrection and bring the whole thing up so what is god doing today that's the thing that he's doing today he's getting amen he's grown a church all the way through but he's brought the the headship now of the word the headstone christ has come and whereas he's come he's come in the formation of a bride amen to display that same nature that same life on display in a farmer a mechanic a housewife the young the elderly the single the married and then he's come to take that very nature and put it on display in a mini-member body to bring the perfection and the image of perfection amen to bring out the resurrection amen christ left off a portion of the work that he didn't complete in his earthly ministry but he left it he left a portion to be done in and through the bride amen because when jesus christ was here in his earthly ministry he never portrayed amen he never portrayed what it was like to be a mother amen he didn't portray what it was like amen to be wherever you are put yourself in whatever position you're in amen god christ didn't portray that full nature in that spot amen so now it's not just going to be in one man doing only what one man does but every facet of life every age every demographic every color every race amen poor and rich and single and married and weak and strong and sick and healthy it doesn't matter all through is going to have this same nature of jesus christ it's going to be the perfection of the bride on display on earth in this day praise be to god showing whatever he was in that form he will be down in bride form praise god so that i just wanted to back up and catch that so we can move from there let's turn to revelation chapter 2. we'll get into the thing that i really would like to share tonight i got a strange title but i titled it the missing acknowledgement the missing acknowledgement we'll take a look at why we said that so let's look at a revelation chapter two verse one unto the angel of the church of the ephesians write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works and i labor and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars and as born and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love now when we read through this it's interesting because if you just read it with with a normal natural mind you can if you understand english and you know basic grammar you read this and come with a certain understanding but without a prophet of god we would have the wrong understanding it looks almost like jesus is saying to to somebody uh it almost looks like he's taking an individual and saying you're doing good here you're laboring here you're doing good here but you've lost your first love but that's not what he's saying and we'll show you in the message it's not as though he's taking an individual saying you're doing good here but you're not doing good there but he's actually addressing two different groups of people amen it's not like he's speaking to his bride there in the first church and said you've done pretty good here you've done pretty good here but you lost your first love his bride didn't lose her first love but the church lost its first love so it's not like he's saying well you're doing all right here and you're not doing all right here speaking to like you as an individual he's not doing that he's speaking to a church he's got a message to a body of people and he's saying you've done this you've done this and he's speaking to his bride on the positive part but when it comes to the negative part he's speaking to the false vine brother brahm says in the out of the church age book in the ephesians church age now to get the real meaning of what we are are about to go into i must caution you to ever keep in mind that religion spiritual matters if you like is composed of two parts that intertwine but are opposite as black and white religion and the spirit and the spiritual world are made of these two trees which had their roots in eden both the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil stand in the midst of the garden and no doubt their very branches intertwined each other so if their very branches intertwined each other you have two trees in the garden they said no doubt their very branches intertwined each other and if you if you weren't paying attention just looking up at this big ball of of leaves and trees intertwined together i mean jesus could look and say you're a perfect tree there's nothing wrong with you amen everything is perfect your fruit is perfect it brings eternal life and he says and you're a cursed tree amen and if you eat if anyone eats of view they'll not live they'll die and it looks like he's speaking out both sides of his mouth if you don't recognize those are two trees there they're laced together and that's what he's doing here in the church he's speaking to two vines that are woven together so it can be confusing it's like his children doing good and doing bad doing good and doing bad amen now it says now thus in the ephesians church age is that same paradox the church is made up of good and bad two vines make the church they're like the wheat and the tares growing up side by side but one is the true the other is the false now god will speak to each one and he will talk about each one he will call them the church and only the elect will really know which is the true spirit only the elect will not be deceived in the resume of the ages at the end of the church age book he says from our studies we have already learned that much of the revelation is totally misunderstood because we have not formally known that the church spoken of and spoken to in this book does not refer to the pure ecclesia the elect the body of christ the bride but it speaks to the entire body of people who are called christians whether they be true or merely nominal to catch that so let's now that we've got to the end of that sense let's go back to the beginning so we can catch it again from our studies we have already learned that much of the revelation is totally misunderstood why is it misunderstood because you didn't know when he was speaking he was speaking to two groups of people amen we thought you were just talking to the elect but he wasn't just talking to the elect he was talking to the elected and non-elected at all come under the heading of christian praise god as all israel is not israel so all christians are not christians that's a novel concept just because you take the label go to a church say the right thing doesn't make it so thus we learn that the church is made up of two vines the true and the false the two vines are motivated by two kinds of spirits one has the holy spirit while the other is endued with the spirit of antichrist both claim to know and be known of god both purport to speak for god both believe certain very basic truths and differ on others but since both bear the name of the lord being called christians and by such name-bearing obviously claim a relationship to him in parentheses as god calls it marriage god now holds them both responsible to him and therefore speaks to each so because they come under the heading because they're part of the seemingly part of the church i mean they've come under that title and given themselves the title and joined themselves to assemblies with that title amen now he speaks to them because they've come under the title of christian not because they are christian he speaks to two groups and now we didn't know that much of the revelation would be misunderstood if we don't know that so now when he's coming through and then we find in each church age now as you go through and read you'll find that he gives a praise he gives he gives a compliment or an acknowledgement he acknowledges if you if you watch now through each of the the church ages in chapter 2 and chapter 3 he acknowledges both vines is that right he acknowledges and he'll say you i know your works and i know your charity i know your tribulation and i know your patience i know this and i know that but i also know that you've got the deeds and the nicolaitans there i also know that you allowed that jezebel there so now he acknowledges both groups and he's speaking to both and you can catch him you can catch him speaking on the positive and the negative through each church age but now let's go to chapter 3 and look at the last church age the laodicean church age revelation chapter 3 verse 14 and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know that i worked at thou are neither cold nor hot i would that were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth now usually he'll start off by saying i know thy works and he starts to speak to the true vine right then i know thy works i know that patience i know that tribulation i know that you cannot bear them that are false but here there's no acknowledgment of good amen there's nothing that acknowledges a true vine amen he's only acknowledging a false vine right out of the bat i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor high i could that thou were cold or hot do you think the genuine body of jesus christ would neither be cold or i know she's red hot on fire for christ all the time amen amen neither cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and either cold nor hot i will spew thee out of thy mouth at any time has god ever spewed his elect out of his mouth would he ever will he ever reject his bride will he ever cast her away will he ever spew the elect out of his mouth no because thou sayest i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knoweth not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked don't think he's speaking to his bride verse 18 i counseled you to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i said that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chase and be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as even as i also overcame in him set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches so brother bam picks this up in the church age book in the laodicean church age he says this age is the last of the seven church ages what began in the first or ephesians age must and will come to full fruition and harvest in the last are laid to see an age the two vines will yield their final fruit the two spirits will terminate their manifestation in each of their final destinations the sowing the watering the growing is all over summer has ended the sickle is now thrust into the harvest further down he says the harvest time yes harvest time the two vines that grew together and intertwined their branches are now to be separated the fruits of these vines which were at such variance will be gathered into separate garners the two spirits will go to their separate destinations now it is time to heed the final call that comes only to the wheat bride come out of her my people that you be not partakers of your sins that you we receive not her tares plagues so now brother i'm saying now now we've come to the end everything when we get to the seventh church age everything that began both vines have grown it's gone through the seed planting through the growing through the watering through all phases now it's come to full maturity and now the sickle is thrust in now it's separation time now we go into a harvest cycle not a growing cycle but now we've moved into a harvest cycle and in the harvest cycle he will separate the two and he's got a call that goes forth and revelation 18 says come out of her my people amen we know the prophet of god amen he was calling from earth come out of her and he said it echoed from heaven come out of her my people now now brother van comes further down and or actually earlier in the same message later seeing church age and he reads what we just read uh this portion verse 15 through 19. and he says as we have read this together i'm sure that you have noticed that the spirit has not said one kind thing about this age he makes two indictments and pronounces his sentence upon them i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew the out of my mouth we are going to look at this carefully it says that this laodicean church age group is lukewarm this lukewarmness demands a penalty from god the penalty is that they will be spewed out of his mouth there is where we want to we don't want to go astray as a lot of folks do the very unwise say that god can spew out of his mouth and that proves that there is no such thing any truth to the doctrine of the perseverance of saints he's speaking of eternal security i want to correct your thinking right now this first is not given to an individual it is given to the church he is talking to the church so don't we'll misunderstand revelation if we don't catch this understanding will miss much of the revelation that he's not speaking to the individual he's speaking to the church and he's saying i will spew you out of my mouth amen he cannot spew his elect out of his mouth he's promised there's precious promises they cannot be separated from his love nothing shall separate us from the love of god amen but now he's speaking to the church and is he's indicting them for the wrong and he's pronouncing judgment and that judgment is a spewing out or a separating from the person of christ himself so now there's a separation that is going to take place and we see because they put him out amen at the end of the age he said behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my knock if any men hear my voice in the garden of eden when adam and sinned god came knocking and he heard the voice of god come walking in the garden he didn't see his footsteps he didn't see his legs through the tree amen he heard the voice of god come walking in the garden amen and now christ has come in the last age amen and he's come to a church that has pushed him to the outside and he comes knocking on the door if you hear my knock no he's knocking on the door by his voice when you hear his voice that's the knock on the door and brother man said not to the individual heart but to the church he's trying to get back into the church and the church refuses to let him in when he comes as a son of man ministry a son of man revealing the son of man and the church shut the door to him and wouldn't let him in and what was he doing service after service revelation after revelation he was knocking on the door of the laodicean church and they would not and he pronounces a judgment and i will spew thee out of my mouth because you're neither cold nor hot you'll just take it and that will go to the surface and not hear the doctrine say it's fine and whatever it's one of these you can have this way or that way you can have it any way you like i'll spew you out of my mouth so now we see in the seventh church age a harvest cycle an absolute separation christ is separated from the church and the church is separated from christ you notice i didn't mention the bride because brother venom didn't mention the bride this is speaking to the church he back in the quote we just read he says as we have read this together i'm sure that you have noticed that the spirit has not said one kind thing about this age that's interesting because if you come to the end of the age which is the end that brother brother branham came to the end of the age the messenger always comes at the end of the previous age to bring him to another age so he comes at the end of the age and at the end of the age you find the laodicean church in this condition now that doesn't mean there wasn't bride in the laodicean church in the pentecostal church it doesn't mean they weren't there but by the time this pronouncement comes by the time the prophet comes to declare this and show this at the end of the laodicean church age she's gone into absolute apostasy there's no light there the moon's gone into a total blackout so now when brother brahma says he doesn't have one nice thing you know the spirit hath not one kind thing to say about this age my question is where is the bride how can the spirit look down and in every age i i know your work i see your patience i see your tribulation i see this but when he comes to the legacy and church age at the end of the legacy in church he looks and says i've got nothing good to say about this church i mean how can he say that if his bride is there [Music] i'd be like brothers if you come into if you come into a group of people and your wife is sitting there and you're looking at a group of women over there and your wife is there and you say i don't see one good thing over there i'll point here these would be full of ladies your wife's sitting in the middle you say i don't see one good thing over here not one characteristic that i can point out you have an interesting conversation when you get home be the same thing as as brother branham looking here the spirit calling out amen to this age and not one good thing to say about this age it shows that the bride is not there at this time if the bride was there the spirit would have to acknowledge it amen in every age there's acknowledgement of the true vine until you get to the seventh age and there's no acknowledgment of the true vine it means that there's a harvest time a harvest cycle where the true vine is separated from the false vine and now this declaration is to the church not to the bride brother says god hiding himself in simplicity i believe the laodicean age is the pentecostal age where she comes to the place of lukewarm and god spews her from his mouth and there's where she comes right now the pentecostal movement has come to that place lukewarm not red hot not ice cold you're not cold and formal neither are you hot you're in the spewing stage and you're going jesus the only age he stood on the outside the church the dogmas had put him out knocking trying to get back in the door lo i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice then back in the laodicean church age he says now he has cried out to this age you have the word you have more bibles than ever but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it in pieces taking what you want and leaving what you don't want you are not interested in living it but debating it i would sooner you were cold or hot if you were cold and rejected it i could stand that if you would get white hot to know its truth and live it i would praise you for that but when you simply take my word and don't honor it i in return must refuse to honor you i will spew you out of my i i will spew you out for you nauseate me he's not talking about his bride now anybody knows that it is a lukewarm water that makes you sick at the stomach if you need a medic lukewarm water is about the best thing to drink a lukewarm church has made god sick and he's declared he will spew it out remind us how he felt just before the flood doesn't it all would to god the church were cold or hot best of all she should be fervent hot but she's not sentence has been passed she is no longer god's voice to the world she will maintain that she is but god says not oh god still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride that voice is in the bride as we have said and we will talk more about that later we'll get we're going to get more into that but what i want to point out is what brother branham said you nauseate me he's not talking to his bride he's talking to a church now something has transpired here in the seventh church age amen that will give the spirit amen the spirit now is declaring a true judgment not a false judgment and that true judgment has not one kind thing to say about the age in fact it declares that i will now spew you out of my mouth we find christ on the outside amen he's on the outside of the church but i rest assured he's not on the outside of his bride because this is the age in which he comes in fullness to his bride so he's not on the outside of the bride he's on the outside of the false vine amen he's not spewing out the true body spewing out the false vine this is harvest time this is capstone time this is adoption time this is every seed coming to full fruition time amen the spirit is declaring accurately there's nothing to acknowledge because there's no part of christ left in this age hey amen the sickle has been thrust in and he's pulled his bride out with what a voice the same voice that come looking for adam adam adam where are you adam was hiding amongst the trees amen hiding in the population hiding amongst the people he was hiding and he clothed himself in religion oh friends where did god find you when he came in the cool of the evening the evening time in the setting sun where did he find you he found you hiding out amongst humanity covered in some form of religion adam was not able to respond to that voice the way he should have but it's different this time friends because the lamb has been slain the book of redemption has been taken now we've come into the full cycle of redemption and now instead of running away amen we're running to that voice because now there was cherubims that were keeping them from the tree of life but those same cherubims are now driving them back to the tree of life and now we've heard a voice in this day amen to a fallen humanity amen i mean they've gone through the cycle of destruction the cycle of fall and a voice came in the evening time and that voice was calling adam adam where are you adam where are you i hid myself because i was afraid because i was naked who told you you were naked it's a different call now friends god has exchanged our religious covering of fig leaves for the covering of his word and now by the washing of the water the word he's washed all the filth he's washed all the pollution away amen and now he now he has dressed us in the wedding garment of his word amen spotless white amen without shame amen now she can run to him because she has on the wedding garment when she hears the voice she can drop the fig leaves and run and be clothed amen and their shame be taken away but not in laodicea do you understand this not happening later to see is being spewed out he's talking to a church let's look at revelation chapter 17. revelation 17 1 and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither i will show unto thee the judgment of the great that sitteth upon many waters so now we have one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and we know this is brother branham's ministry he's the one who shows us the great he shows us the judgment of the how's the judged by atomic fire who drops the bomb russia how do you know that right the only way that you will be shown the destruction amen of the great is if there's been one of the seven angels with the seven last vials that has come and told you who is this talking all the way through the book of revelation did brother branham only have a ministry in the first three chapters of the first four now you can find that ministry from the from the very beginning all the way through you can find that ministry so now he comes in in 1804 he says and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive none of her plagues this is important that that we understand that brother branham is the one he's the angel on earth calling this out but he's saying when he calls it out it's echoed from heaven when he calls it out and it's echoed from heaven whose voice is that saying come out of her my people whose people who does the bride belong to she belongs to christ amen this is god's children god's seat the bride of jesus christ and when he's when when brother branham says come out of her leave these denominations leave these creeds leave these dogmas it's echoed from heaven and you're not just hearing the voice of the seventh angel but there's something echoing from heaven and if you have the receiver to pick up the voice of him knocking at the door you can receive the message from heaven [Applause] you heard it through naturals it came through natural lips it's on a natural tape amen but it's echoed from heaven and that echo from heaven is what awakens the seed on the inside we drop our fig leaves and take the wedding garment let's go to second corinthians chapter six brother branham ties these two scriptures together in the church age book revelation 18 4 and second corinthians 6. ii corinthians chapter 6 verse 17. wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty now brother venom comes in the laodicean church age in the church age book and he lists these two scriptures one on top of the other romans 18 4 and second corinthians 6 17 and 18. and he actually reads verse 14 all the way to 18 and second corinthians 6. but before that he says and that and that is what the church has constantly done through the ages she has left the word of god and taken her own creeds and dongles she has organized and joined herself to the world thus she is naked and god is judging her lewdness the only way she can get out of this dread situation is by obeying the word the lord to come back to his word the only way she can leave this is by obeying the lord by coming back to the word and then he reads two scriptures revelations 18 4 come out from among her my people and in second corinthians 6 14 to 18 which says come come come out from among them and be separate saith the lord he reads those two together and then he says after the end of those scriptures he said there is a price to pay for those garments and that is the price of separation because there was not one good thing to say to the laodicean church age to the church of laodicea you cannot get the garments there the price to pay for putting on those garments is separation you must leave the laodicean church to get these garments because if you could have got the garments there he'd have something good to say about that church but there's a missing acknowledgement what's missing the bride is missing it's obvious in the scriptures god does everything he sets patterns in the scriptures he sets him for a reason to catch our attention amen and in every in this first six church age he's got this pattern laid down acknowledge the good acknowledge the evil and knowledge the true vine acknowledge the false fine until he gets to the seventh there's no acknowledgement for the true vote meaning the true vine is not there you can't find the garment there the price to pay for those garments that is the price of separation now brother benham in the church age book he begins to to share for this curse that now i will spew you out of my mouth you're neither lukewarm you're neither cold or hot but you look where i spew you out of my mouth and brother branham takes it and he begins to explain amen that spewing out of the mouth it's a rejection because you nauseate me but it's also a declaration that you will no longer have my word or speak on my behalf because what comes out of the mouth of god is the word and so what's happening is i'm spewing you out of my mouth i'm separating you from my word because god is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god so god is the word so when he spews you out of your mouth he's actually separating you from himself by separating you from the word oh friends this is so important to recognize because when he wants to marry you he marries you by uniting you with the word amen when he wants to separate from you he separates you from his word so many people want to be married to jesus christ and in their imagination they imagine a a a robe clad garment a robo a robe clad individual a man with a beard and they want to go up and put their arms around him married to that but you can't marry that form in this day you can't wrap your arms around that flesh body amen you cannot go up and hug you cannot kiss his feet the only way that you can come in contact with that body that body was the word made flesh and now the word has been restored and the only way to embrace that being is to embrace that word amen and because they refused to embrace the word he spewed them out of his mouth and he separated from his word and said you will never no longer speak on my behalf because you don't have the word because you've put me out and i've thrust you from being the mouthpiece so now they can they cannot without the word speak for god they cannot without the word be the bride they cannot without the word be united to god it's so clear friends there's such denominational concepts that creep in and still want to hang on and we've got to get rid of them because if i love jesus christ with all my heart and i want to embrace jesus christ i've got to take this fully revealed word and wrap my whole self in it and take it in me and pour myself in that and become with the one with that and when i do i am united with the lamb when i do that i'm married to god but if i reject that word i have rejected my mate if i reject that word i've rejected my husband and because they rejected their mate rejected their husband the revealed word and put him on the outside he was knocking with a voice to get in but they would not take him in and so he spewed them out of his mouth and said you will not speak for me so now there's going to be another people that can speak because there is not a church age that can speak for him anymore the laodicean church cannot give the word of god you understand cannot give the word of god cannot bring people to the blood because they refused the path to the blood which is the word and they've been separated from the word and spewed out of the mouth of god and no longer have the word and now they cannot the laodicean church cannot bring people to the blood [Music] it doesn't matter how much blood they talk about in the sermon and blood sacrifice because we know that when that blood was shed it released a life that life is attached to the word the words that i speak are spirit and life to get that blood you have to get that life that life is attached to the word without the word you don't get the life without the life you have not the blood so the laodicean church the church ages is finished amen he's capped it off by bringing a bride out of laodicea into that eighth portion which is him christ himself the headship and now she is declaring the headship the capstone charity and that is the place amen to find the mouth of god that is the place to find the word of god she is now the voice of god the final voice to the final age praise be the god why because she's received jesus christ the manifested word for her day and she's united with her husband her mate the manifested word for her day and now amen now she is in the mouth of god not spewed out of the mouth of god but in the mouth of god speaking the words of god she has the words of life they do they brother brahm says they think they're getting people to the blood but they've rejected the path to the blood which is the word all we have to do is accept the scriptures that there is no acknowledgement of a bride in laodicea [Music] so now we've got to go somewhere else to find this bride we have to look somewhere else than the latest in churches to find this bride now listen friends i am not talking about segments of time on calendars i'm talking about dispensations of operation and god is no longer operating in the laodicean church that laodicean church is in the laodicean age continuing on today the world the church the church is in the laodicean age you accept that but i want to say the bride is not because if the bride was there he would have something good to say about it i love the word of god i love it it reinforces everything brother banh said amen brother branham he was seeing these things and he was explaining it in the way that he had the limited vocabulary and understanding and he just was explaining it the way that he could but he was speaking directly what was in the scriptures he saw it in the word amen and we can look in the word and see the same thing and now our confidence is not in well i heard somebody say this no no but our confidence that prophet brought us back to the word the word is my mate the word is my husband i'm united with the word because i see it in the word praise be to god now in the literacy and church age he says but thank god at this moment this age is not over he is yet crying and his cry is not only in the spiritual ears of men by a spirit but once again a prophet is in the land once more god will reveal the truth as he did to paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the laodicean age its messenger will reveal the mysteries of god as revealed to paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the beneficent effect of the prophet's ministry and they that hear him will be blessed and receive part that then become part of the bride of the last day who are mentioned in revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the bride say come what are the spirit and the bride bidding them to come to to come to the river of life so they're bidding them to come to the source of life to the river of life and drink so at the very end amen now now the the laodicean church has been spewed out of his mouth separated from him he's been put on the outside but the bride now is standing as the final voice of the vinyl age and she's saying come come come where come to what come to her she no she's not saying come to me she's saying come and drink of the water of life freely she must know where it's at she must be with it because she's saying come she's not saying go come the corner wheat the bride wheat that fell in the ground at nicaea has come back to the original word grain again praise god forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of god who appears in the last stage what he says from god the bride will say amen the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the word they are saying it now come out from among her now and be ye separate brother branham just said the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing what they will be saying will have already been said in the word what word revelation 18 4 and 2nd corinthians 6 17 put together those are the two scriptures he put together he says come out from among her and be separate why that cry could not be made in the laodicean church because the laodicean church has been spewed out of his mouth and can no longer speak for god so the only way that that cry can go forth is we have to find that bride of revelation 22 17 and where are we going to find her we've got to find her somewhere where there's an acknowledgement that she's there because there's no acknowledgement that she's in the laodicean church age so we've got to find her and when we find her amen then we can find that final voice to the final age we can find that cry that the spirit and the prophet and the bride are saying the same thing becoming the mouthpiece of god now speaking come to the river of life come to the fountain of life praise god brother branham in the first seal we all know this but i'm just going to read it because it's so good so now watch he said it would be known in the last day but it comes forth in a church symbol do you understand in it church it comes forth in a symbol of a church that they know there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's the white horse rider now i love this because brother ben is about ready to say something but he's prefacing it and he's saying now it comes forth in a church seal in a church seal the church sees the symbol but doesn't have the interpretation of the symbol that's a church seal i'm not interested in church seals i want the bride seal amen you realize it the church for 2 000 years has been seeing amend seals in symbol form the church has had the seven seals open in symbol form because the lamb took the book in revelation chapter 5 chapter 6 he opened the seal when he opened the seal a symbol came out and the church has had amen the seal the church seal has been the symbol of the white horse rider but now he's rejected the church he separated the two vines he could not give the interpretation to the mixed audience so first he must stand at the door and knock when they refuse he spews them out of the mouth the sickle is thrust in he separates it to the vine when he gets the bride off to himself now he can begin to whisper love secrets to her what the church can't have the bride can have that's why he sent a prophet in our day and that's why he sent a prophet with such an unusual ministry that he would declare every sign that jesus showed so that the church would be without excuse for denying him but he would speak things in such a form they would confuse the theology it would confuse the learning it would confuse the understanding and they would be so bent out of shape that although they could see all the works of jesus christ they could not hear the voice of jesus christ knocking in the age because they would say what's this he saying i don't understand about this and serpent seed in it we know it was an apple what do you mean adultery in the garden amen so i mean so speaking such a foreign language to the churches they had so corrupted and polluted the word until he was speaking in an unknown language and they rejected him not because of the works jesus said for which of the works do you condemn me they didn't condemn brother brennan for one of his works but for making the bride equal to christ [Music] [Applause] for making her him for making amen the final voice in the final age amen come through her we'll condemn you for that you making yourself equal to god that's why we condemn you you making yourself equal to christ you say amen this is christ in feminine form this is the bride form of christ this is christ in the formation of the bride because you draw an equal sign between christ and the bride we'll condemn you for that we'll reject you for that but not for your works they were rejecting his teaching and standing in line to get healed it's the same thing friends there's been a church seal for 2000 years he couldn't give it to the laodicean church age he couldn't give it to the latest in church the pentecostal age they couldn't handle it he says it's come forth in the symbol of a church that they know there's a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a white horse rider and it only is to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to christ but to the church notice oh my that just makes me tremble i hope that the church truly understands it see what i mean you people i'm going to call you bride see that you'll understand because now what are we doing we're separating to two vines amen it was a church symbol but now it's going to be revealed to the true church amen but but you're not going to get it if i just say church because for 2 000 years we've said church church church church and the church was kind of good kind of bad kind of good kind of bad amen in the church in that form with two vines intertwined could not catch the revelation of the symbol so now there's going to come forth it's going to break into the actual seal it's going to be revealed to who not the christ amen is going to be revealed to who to his bride i'm going to call you bride so that you'll understand that this is not coming to the laodicean church it's coming to those that have gone beyond the camp because he was crucified beyond the camp and then they put jesus christ out of jerusalem and then they put him out of the religion they took him outside the camp and they crucified him outside the camp and in this day they've done the same thing because jesus christ came a son of man revealed through the the son of man revealed through a son of man and they put him outside of their camp and they crucified him and now they've been spewed out of the mouth he's been put out and now the only way to catch this actual seal being broke it cannot be broke to the church because it's been in church symbol amen it can only be broke to the bride and the bride has to come out of the church system it has to be united to christ and says i'm going to call you bride so that you're gonna so you'll understand it's going to be broke to you the love secrets are going to be whispered to you that's why brother ben and when he starts down this path he said it's been broken in symbol form but when it's actually broke he knows he's coming to the actual break he's in the first seal amen the lord's already come to him and already gave him the revelation of the first seal and when he gets there he starts saying it's been in a church form it's been in a church symbol form i mean they've had it they've known it's a white horse because now it's going to be actually broke broke do this just makes me tremble why because he realizes if it's broke actually broke now he's looking at a people that's been separated out of laodicea he has come to the bright age he's speaking to the bride of jesus christ to a people in a harvest cycle the sickle's been thrown in the lamb has taken the book and now he's trembling not because he knows what a white horse means but the fact that the seal is actually breaking declares where we are in time amen we've gone beyond these things he's moved from those things he's not working through the church ages anymore he's not working through the churches but now he's pulled out his true vine and he's got her off to the side and he's going to whisper the love secrets to her it's like you know when you used to have a girlfriend and you like to get her off by yourself and tell her little things and and you'd be in a group of people and all of a sudden people be coming and going and you just want them all to go away because you got something you want to tell her and you look at her kind of like this you're trying to get her to take the i want to i want to tell you something you got to get off here by myself by yourself there's things i'm not going to speak openly sometimes my husband and wife they'll just have that look you know they'll be you know they may have company or their kids might be around and all of a sudden one will look this way won't look that way next thing you know the two of them disappear into the other room they both have to get something why he had to get her drawn off to the side without bringing the false mind he couldn't say it outright he couldn't bring somebody with a wide vocabulary could easily explain it all but he had to get it said in a certain way that the false vine wouldn't come along then only the bride would catch the innuendos and they'll catch the movement of the eyes and catch all of these things that were slipped in so she will come away amen and go what was that you wanted to say yeah it's the separation of the bride from the church he says in works his faith expressed from 1965 god to the pentecostal church of this day the restoration of the gifts he's in prayer now may lord those men maybe some of them present here some of them hearing the tape around the world may they realize that this is the calling out of the bride not a pentecostal message the pentecostal message was to restore the gifts back in the church but this is the calling forth of the bride another message that was to come just before sodom was to be burned he says in jehovah jireh from 62 oh we realize that the pentecostal church age in the last day is the laodicean church age the only one that christ was put out of the church standing knocking trying to get back in oh god be merciful he goes on jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever in 1963 but this is the lord jesus christ in the form of the holy spirit moving among his people doing the same thing that he did when he was here on earth identifying himself with his bride not the church there is a difference between the church and the bride when we come to this spot now there's a difference between the church and the bride and he's no longer going to talk to the church anymore now he's going to talk to the bride the sickle's been thrust in the bride has been pulled out of the church and now he's speaking to the bride not to the church every other church age he had a message for both but in the last church age he just was acknowledging that there's just the false vine there in shalom 1964 he says god is a jealous god he is jealous and he wants his wife pure he wants her a virgin chase nothing in the world into her at all altogether his word part of him we must be part of the word not part of the creed a part of the word not a part of the church a part of the bride church is condemned we know that she goes out to outer darkness but the bride goes up brother brahm would then point to the the newspapers carrying the blackout of the moon the eclipse of the moon and he shows that there's only six pictures there and those six pictures match exactly what he drew on the board when he drew out the church ages as moons with little lights and and and the holy spirit drew it on the back wall of the church to confirm it and then he said the third is a witness too and god drew it in the skies but he says you see the one that god do in the skies didn't have that seventh picture he said because when god showed it in the skies it was completely blacked out showing the church the laodicean church had gone into complete apostasy there was no more light there why was there no more light there because the bride had already been called out for them it was the setting of the sun for her it was the rising of the sun shalom good morning so he pulls her out to the rising of the sun but the rest of the world moves into the setting of the sun now you're not part of the church part of the bride the church is condemned now let's go to revelation 19. revelation 19 and verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready and her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints not miserable poor blind and naked but there's now a people that have got eyes to see ears to hear she's got all the riches that the word can give and all the promises that were given to abraham as the royal seat of abraham she's got it all and she's clothed in the righteousness of the saints she's clothed in the word of god let's go over to revelation 21. revelation 21 we'll read verse 9. now i want to say this before we begin reading we came through seven church ages and in six of the seven church ages we saw an acknowledgment of the true vine acknowledgement of the false mind come to the seventh church age we see no acknowledgment of the true vine you have to ask yourself where did she go where did she go if she's not there if there's nothing good to say at all they can't say one kind thing about the laodicean church and then where did she go because there's got to be a bride somewhere and she's not there where is she so there's got to be a voice amen that can give the right acknowledgement the spirit speaking the latest in church age couldn't acknowledge but there's a voice of the seventh angel can acknowledge and show you where she's at revelation 21 and nine and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife if you can't find her in in the in the message of the spirit to the laodicean church amen then you have to listen to the message of the seventh angel because the message of the seventh angel will tell you where she's at [Applause] the spirit speaking in the seventh church age cannot have one kind thing to say about the latest in church saying that the bride's not there amen but there's a voice amen there's a voice on earth that will declare who she is and where she is and it's the voice of the seventh angel one of the seven angels having the seven bibles says i will show you i will show you the bride the lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and he showed me the great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and her light was likened to a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal so the seventh angel amen begins to tell you amen that that this bride is now the new jerusalem this bride is that city that's four square this is the bride that has the lamb sitting on the throne where the lamb is the light thereof and that lamb is emanating the light of the lamb is emanating from out of that city that's why brother venom will come to future home and he begin typing typing the future home the renovation of the earth and the city coming down and he starts to type it with your conversion why is he drawing a parallel between god renovating the earth and bringing this city down to rest upon our earth that's burnt over and renovated and he's typing it to your conversion amen because he's trying to show you're the city you're the dwelling place you're the temple you're the habitation of god you are the place on earth where this city is resting and he gets into that place and he says now amen i would like to i could drop a little something here if you'd like me to and he says and when he drops a little something he says now this these so many cubits and furlongs this and that he says it's like 1500 miles by 1500 miles he said about what we have here in the church from maine down to to arkansas and whatever about 1500 miles square a little over half of the united states and he said about what we got represented right here this morning what's he showing you he's showing you the lamb's wife the ones who have been called out of laodicea called out by a voice that was knocking called out by a son of man amen a son of man revealing the son of man the son of man himself knocking at the door calling out those who have gone outside the camp those who have heard the seventh angel and now he's telling them about the future home typing it with their conversion now he's drawing the parallels and saying now what we've got in the church what's the what was in jeffersonville all the people who were listening to that voice and had gathered out of the churches who were coming to the word for their day they were representing the bride he says what is this what are these dimensions he said it's about what we have right here this morning i'd like to propose to you that one of the seven angels having the seven last violence has showed us the lamb's wife and the called out elected group who have gathered to the voice who have left traditions who have left the nomination who have left the church systems who have left the pentecostal age and come into the bright age so there's been an acknowledgment and he goes and begins to describe she's built on the foundation of the apostles her gates are the patriarchs her light amen is the glory of the lord what an acknowledgement friends the prophet of god goes on to say i'd like to just read this in the invisible union of the bride of christ november 25th 1965. brother ben's coming to the last couple sermons that whoever preached the last part of his ministry he's got one month more until he leaves the earth and i like if i read this i'd like for you to read it with this thought in mind there was a no acknowledgement given to the latest in church age but when when there's a people pulled out and united to christ christ is going to give them their acknowledgement christ now will speak to the true vine and i'm going to read this and let it be christ speaking to the true vine not a mixed multitude not the true and false interwoven but now speaking to a called out separated out harvest time vine he says the apostles them who set forth the bible here here come luther out in reformation his words that this church won't work today wesley's won't pentecost won't it won't work it worked in their day but it's another day this is the opening of the seven seals i know it sounds strange to you but god has vindicated so perfectly there is no question in it just perfectly i ain't scattering that to the local assembly i'm speaking to the people out across the nation do what you wish to now notice the anointed word of this day of which you are apart by predestination you immediately like knew when you heard that you knew right quick that you was an eagle you always realized that you wasn't a denominational chicken to begin with you know there is something wrong there there is something wrong that's right for you know that you were trapped into it at the beginning he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you has washed you by the washing of the water by the church no that don't sound right does it no you might find that in the almanac but not in god's bible by the washing of the water by the word in the word see you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning what is this this is the acknowledgement christ what he couldn't say to the laodicean church age but when the sickle is thrust in and the bride's pulled out now he's reserved his acknowledgement now so he can pull the bride out to himself whisper the love secrets now he's going to tell her he's going to give her the praises that weren't in laodicea he's going to give her the acknowledgement that he couldn't give in laodicea but now he's going to pour it upon her you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now as we go off the air just in a minute you are standing if you're standing on god's word and with god's word every amen every jot every tittle this is not to the laodicean church this is not the hybrid religion this is not the denomination this is only to the bride every amen every jot every tittle where are you standing i'm trying to tell you pull away from the shocks get out here in the wheat where you can get right before the sun i hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place talk about a thanksgiving i feel real good i'm more thankful for that than anything i know of you see why he could not speak this to the laodicean church age he could only speak it to a separated bride he can't say that to the false vine but he can say that to his elect to his to to the portion of himself that is reserved to be expressed in this day he says you never did it in the first place talk about a thanksgiving i feel good i'm more thankful for that than anything i know of you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god amen oh i'm so glad he didn't say anything in laodicea i'm glad he waited till now you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and washed in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect the blood of jesus christ oh how can you if a man if i was supposed to die in the morning and a man took my place i cannot die for that sin somebody took my place and jesus the word took my place he became me that a sinner that i might become him the word it's not just that i'm going to embrace the word i'm going to be the word he took my place a center so that i could take his place the word amen the word is god the word the anointed word on display is jesus christ amen he took my place as sinner he took me as a sinner's place he became like a sinner to die for me as a sinner so as a sinner i died on calvary so that i could become him which is the word made manifest in my day which is the bride age a bride day a bride time beyond the laodicean church this is his acknowledgement to his bride what he couldn't say in laodicea to those who have come out and come into the bride and come into union with christ he can now say what he couldn't say there you are the sinless spotless virtuous bride of the son of god hallelujah and jesus the word took my place he became me that a sinner that i might become him the word amen let me hold true to it not the church the words you see the separation not the church it's the individual who is the word on display in this day the individual that christ is dwelling in christ in you the hope of glory as an individual all hell is against this revelation not to the church to the individual the church is rejected the church is condemned but the individual the bride amen each one that composes that bride as an individual has been put in place in the age of adoption and now he's telling you what you are you're perfect you've come to the headstone amen you're the capping off of the church agent you're the finishing up whatever jesus christ was when he capped off the old testament you are the same thing capping off the new testament [Applause] and he's going to show in the housewife and he's going to show and an elderly sister he's going to show it a married man a married woman he's going to show in the labor he's going to show in the professional he's going to show it to mom he's going to show it to daddy what is it everything that church was supposed to be in the beginning but failed is now coming back to the full manifestation of the whole gospel in individuals who are the word hallelujah not the church the word oh that spiritual union of christ in his church now now not coming now the spiritual you know christ in his church now when the flesh is becoming word what flesh what flesh what flesh is becoming a word tense yourself where the flesh is becoming word how's the flesh becoming word because he will have a bride in his very own image and he's going to do it through your flesh that's the word that's the promise and the promise is coming into manifestation and you and i the word is becoming flesh the flesh is becoming word and the word the promise for this day is becoming flesh in you and i manifested vindicated just what the bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day why it's culminating so fast out there in those deserts and things taking place that i couldn't even keep up with it we're near the coming of jesus to be united with this church where the word becomes the word call of the holy spirit searching the hearts you're standing completely you're standing completely listen friends let all the denominational ideas of climbing up a ladder and failing and falling back to the bottom rung and all of that striving amen let it all fade away you've already been declared perfect you've already been you've already arrived you've already come to the place he wants you to come to amen we fail absolutely fail we've messed up but he's already declared us perfect why because he's given a perfect word to make a perfect bride and we become that perfect expression by a perfect faith and a perfect word and he's working out day by day it's working in our lives friends just let it work amen don't complicate it just let it work you're standing completely you never send it the first place god don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it i want to tell you right now that thing that plagues your mind that thing that troubles you that thing that the devil flashes in your face and causes a shiver to run down your spine whenever you remember that horrible sin you never did it oh come to terms with this how can we ever be what he's called us to be how can we ever stand and speak when he says speak and live the very life of jesus christ if we're constantly condemned all the time by things that happened in the past he said you never did it you never did it you never did it i never did it the body i lived in did a few things but there's been a price paid for that but the real genuine me the seed of god i've never done that only the body i lived in that was anointed by a hybrid spirit that was anointed by an evil spirit of the world it did some things and i remember some of those things because i still have that mind but there's another mind that's the mind of christ that's been awakened by an awakening of the sea gene on the inside and i'm remembering further back than that sin and the word of god is breaking my amnesia to take me back a few more steps than when i was a 17 year old boy when i was a 15 year old boy moving me back back before my natural birth all the way back to i was one with god and i never did it then and he's bringing me back to that position you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of god you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely put out of existence even in the mind of god i tell your friends if we keep bringing old things from the past up and making them excuses for our failures today and the reasons we can't accomplish what god calls us to do you are bringing disgrace to the blood of jesus christ you're absolutely spitting in the face of god saying you're not powerful enough to forget it couldn't absolutely be washed away there's no way i could be completely forgiven it's got to still be an effect you i can't be what you call me to be i can't do because everybody knows my past they all know what i've done i'm telling you quit mocking god if he said you never did it you never did it if it's in the sea of his forgetfulness then forget about it do we suffer consequences in the flesh and absolutely will those consequences continue probably but we're not looking to the flesh this flesh is going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye i'm not worried about this flesh god's got a plan for this flesh but there's a life on the inside that'll take dominion over this flesh if i will let it but i have got to believe the word that if i am sinless if i am guiltless if i've been free if he actually took my place then how effective was the work of jesus christ on calvary if i make it partially effective i do disgrace to the word of god what's he done at the end of the age he's pulled off his bride and he's saying there's some things i couldn't say in a mixed audience there's some things i couldn't say to the laodicean church when the valspar was mixed in i didn't want the false mind to think this was about them because they're going to be judged out of the things that are written in the book according to their deeds but you'll never be judged according to your deeds you are judged according to your faith being able to believe the word and receive it for your day and you will not be judged according to your deeds the things that are written in the book like they will at the white throne judge i can't say this to laosea but i can say it to you now that i've thrust in my sickle and pulled you out friends really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son or daughter of god you're standing there washed your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of god you're the virtuous bride of christ washed in the blood of christ precious virtuous sinless son of god standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he washed by the water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was i'm going to read that again slowly why did he wash you so that he could take you he could not take you until you're washed that's why he could not come in an invisible union until the redemption was complete and he had finally washed all the falseness and washed all the pollution out of the church he washed you so that he could take you you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was your predestination is the same as his predestination i'll put it this way you are just as predestinated as jesus christ is predestinated predestinated is predestinated i don't know that he has degrees of predestination this is a predestination fifth degree this is a predestin you're predestinated in the bosom of the father the same as he was he was that great attribute of god called love whatever you are you are servants of god whatever god wants you to do where your place is god placed in the church some apostles prophets teachers pastors he placed that by virtue of his own predestination and you were you were that to begin with your first wedding was annulled it was you've never done it in the first place because there's only one thing could do it that would be the god come down himself and took your place in the form of the son of god christ jesus christ and washed you by the water of the washing of the water by the word the word not the denomination the word washed you but if you won't stand in the water of the word how you're going to get washed you're still as spotted as eve was that's why you couldn't say this to the laodicean church there was no pure water there to wash with it was a polluted corrupted water he had to restore the pure water of the word to wash the bride in what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in god which is the word pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word the word became blood the word bled for you and you are washed in bleeding word the word bleeding the life of god in the word and the word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleansed and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stayed on god and on his word i say the spirit of god through the seventh angel gave an acknowledgement and i want to i want to remind you that when the spirit spoke in revelation 3 to the 7th church age it had not one good thing to say but when the spirit spoke in the invisible union it didn't have one bad thing to say because there's been a complete separation of the two vines god sees you as he predestinated you god sees you as he willed you to be as he predestinated as he paid for you his plan is a finished plan before the foundation of the world and everything now is working into that plan even our mistakes he works together for his glory so let god be god and let what he said be true and say whatever happened to me in the past whatever i failed and all that does is put in me a character to love him more all that does is make me cling closer to his word it doesn't put me on the outside it doesn't make me unusable it doesn't make me a second-rate christian or believer of bride of jesus christ all it does is give me a greater love for his grace a greater understanding a greater revelation amen a greater experience even my current failure that i just fail at amen all it does is make me appreciate him more and want to stick with his word more and more i want to be closer to him more brother brethren said christ the man the message of christ is the mystery god revealed he said the new birth is christ is a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is you notice he didn't say the rapture will come because the rapture has already come the rapture's come the adoption has come the invisible unions come uniting with individuals awakening them to the to the taking away the spiritual needs and waking them to the reality from before but when this church oh if the church only knew its position take all the scare all the worry all the fear away if we knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is god bless you saints let's all stand musicians if you could come i'll just remind you in the message to the laodicean church age he didn't have one good thing to say that means there was no bride there to address but after he separates his group out it brings out the sickles thrust in the harvest time comes he begins to separate the two vines when he gets the true vine off to himself he begins to say not you did good here but you need to improve here he doesn't say you got this right but but you're allowing this when he gets his bride off to himself he says you're the sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ you never did it in the first place you were trapped into it you were born into it god already paid for that he's washed it away he's put it in the sea of his forgetfulness never to remember it no more but you're standing now completely you're standing now virtuous sinless spotless bride of jesus christ oh she only knew what she was amen she could only recognize her position she will she will and i believe she is i believe she's catching it by predestination by grace not by merit not by effort not by wisdom not by teaching but by grace amen by grace he brought a revelation that revelation awakened us from our stupor from the from the denominational mindset and the carnality in our mind and brought us back to a greater revelation a greater realization of who we were before we were on this earth who we were always meant to be before we made our first mistake so she can recognize her position what's her position bride of jesus christ united jesus christ sitted in heavenly places in christ jesus already she's been justified and whom he justified he hath glorified i'm not hoping to make a glorification someday i'm not hoping to get a glorified body amen it's a finished work in the mind of god because who he called he chose who he chose he justified who he justified he hath glorified it's finished friends i'm glorified in the mind of god i'm only here acting out my part in the great drama to manifest the headstone that's come down christ in the form of his bride pushing a mower hammering on a frame of a house dropping off the mail washing a baby do you realize don't make it don't make it super complicated make it every day make it you don't make it the super duper christian superhero you know that's what the bride looks like no the bride looks like a humble woman going to the grocery store to get all the groceries to feed her children that next week what's she doing she's in her position she's in her post of duty she's doing exactly what god called her to do and she's doing it according to the word not our own reasoning not our own mind i mean she's dressed like jesus christ with dress she's she's greeting other people like she would greet other people she's stopping and letting somebody else go there's not compromise on her body there's not compromise in her cart [Applause] don't make it complicated make it every day normal living jesus christ in the formation of his bride what about the supernatural that's supernatural but i believe if that bride stays in her position anything that stops you from fulfilling your purpose on this earth you can speak to that mountain and it has to move why because you're in your post of duty amen you're doing what god called you to do and any devil that stands against you and resists it you can push against that devil and it has to flee amen you can you can work every work that jesus christ work if you stay in your post of duty in any force any devil anything that would hinder you in your calling in your position amen that thing will have to move in the name of jesus christ and the supernatural will have to take place in your life don't put it in superheroes super believers a super future there's a super seat on earth right now and there's a super sign on earth right now what was the super sign a virgin shall conceive that was a super sign and god will come in the form of flesh that's a super sign i tell you there's a super sign on earth right now jesus christ is here he has returned and he's in the form of his bride a super sign upon a super seed don't throw it away don't make it unattainable amen there's as soon as you throw it to a super christian a super believer a super work then then you'll go to the grocery store with compromise on your body and compromise in your cart because you've put living for jesus christ and manifesting christ in some super-duper atmosphere somewhere but when you make it every morning when you wake up and the alarm goes off you say lord jesus help me today what is that that's jesus christ living in you lord take the preeminence in me today help me with my word help me that's the capstone everything that the church built up to capped off with love god himself jesus christ here he's united with his bride and now he's finishing the work he didn't finish in his earthly ministry he left a portion to do in and through the bride he's doing it now is there more to do probably may there be supernatural things there's been supernatural all alone i don't doubt one thing but i say god let me stay in my position and do what you called me to do and do it the way you would do it if you were in my flesh amen let's sing brother ben you got a [Music] song [Music] [Music] he is [Music] [Music] he's in me his name again he's in me listen closely me oh hallelujah friends if we could just catch that and remember it all the time it'll change every moment of our life just not forget what he said about us if we could just accept it as true don't figure it out just accept it as true just believe it that god wants to use me that christ wants to live in me christ in me the hope of glory i accept it i don't know what it i don't know what all you want to do lord but whatever you want to do do it i yield to it lord in the routine and the mundane and the super in the in this and the strange i just give it all to you lord and whatever you want to do just do it and this is bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father for your word lord oh how rich lord how god

program lord and let us be with your program every moment and every day let us yield to your program yield to your will in our life oh how i love you lord i thank you for what you speak is beyond us

free from laodicea let us be lord united only with you you are the word let us recognize and see that day by day the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming the word that you're actually changing us lord that you're actually changing our thoughts you're changing our actions you're changing our reaction because the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming the word let it manifest in full measure lord complete the work lord that you left for this day we yield ourselves to you that you might complete it in us we give ourselves wholly over to you lord and ask that you would accomplish your great purpose and what we want to say we thank you god we thank you that you sent a prophet you spoke through that prophet you called our name and you told us who we really are without that voice lord we would never know we'd be completely incapable of rising out of laodicea without that voice without your voice speaking through that voice of a man we'd be stuck lord but you've lifted us out of that and broke away all the humanistic ideas and you've risen us to another potential you've spoken it and there's another level another potential and we're thankful for that lord have your way with us let that image you had of us before the foundation of the world let it come lord into full focus now finish developing that picture in us until the picture on earth is
