TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we cannot say we believe this mess this is not a denomination this is not i you can't go to a message church and be a believer you have to be a believer it's not there's not admittance you know i walk into the doors of a message church and i'm a believer and i believe god sent a prophet i mean there's multitudes that believe god sent a prophet amen but that's not really the goal of the message that's not what god wanted god wanted a people that would come to the full life of jesus christ in bride form that it would be christ in bride form manifesting himself to the entire world that was the purpose of the message that's the seventh seal that's why brother branham opened the seals that's why god sent a prophet that's why the supernatural that's why there's a cloud that's why all the stuff that happened happened that's why there was raising of dead that's why there was opening of blinding eyes everything that happened happened for this purpose to get a bride to full maturity and it takes a full word the full light to bring her to full maturity to express the full life and that's the purpose of the message [Music] to stop somewhere short and say i believe god sent a prophet i go to a message church but you know i'm not so sure about brother benham said about this and i'm not so sure about that and i think i've got a right to remarry and i think it's okay for me to wear this and i you see really quickly that the devil has got in somewhere and a temptation in the wilderness because now we're hanging out over here my want my desire what i like the way i want to look the way i want to live and we we we've rejected the very message well we haven't rejected men's i believe god said no no no no you haven't taken the authority of a prophet in your life the voice that god gave us in this day to bring the bride to full rapture of faith to full harvest maturity [Music] and then somehow we get comfortable in compromise because i'm the bride i believe the message i'm the bride if you're comfortable and comfortable if you're comfortable living contrary to what the prophet of god taught us to live then i would go back and repent and say god there's something wrong with i've accepted a lie somewhere [Music] amen i've accepted something the devil has whispered to me somewhere he's used something to get me to stop in my growth to be coming to this perfect image of a bride and i've gotten comfortable being in the message and being part of the bride but they're never to be comfortable being in the message the message has to be in you amen and furthermore the message has to come out of you [Music] you you and i are called to be the living message the living expression of the living word everything brother branham preached is supposed to be alive and you and i and manifested and demonstrated
