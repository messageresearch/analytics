[0:00] well I'm one of the few I'm one of the
[0:05] few and my faith in God's word I can
[0:09] claim it and though the way may seem
[0:13] long and the opposition strong for the
[0:17] bride there's a way
[0:20] robited and if I plan to go through
[0:24] Mr hope will not do I must be firmly
[0:30] decided
[0:32] to follow the Lord by obeying his word
[0:37] and believe that I'm
[0:40] once a few
[0:42] years
[0:59] away provided
[1:02] and if I plan to go through just to hope
[1:07] will not do I must be firmly decided
[1:13] to follow the Lord by obeying his word
[1:18] and believe that I'm one of the few
[1:22] thank you
[1:23] and if I plan to go through just to hope
[1:27] will not do I must be firmly decided to
[1:34] follow the Lord by obey his word and
[1:40] believe that I'm one of the few
[1:44] well God has got a bride that's marching
[1:48] through the sled with praises in her
[1:52] mouth and healing in her hand there's
[1:56] Everlasting joy and gladness in her
[1:59] heart and in this bride I've got apart
[2:05] well God has got a bride that's marching
[2:09] through this land through its Praises in
[2:12] her mouth and peeling at her hand
[2:16] Everlasting joy and gladness in her
[2:20] heart and in this bride I've got a part
[2:24] one more time God has got a bride that's
[2:29] marching through this land with praises
[2:32] in her mouth and healing at her hand
[2:37] Everlasting door and gladness in her
[2:40] heart in this bright I'm out of heart
[2:47] amen good evening God bless you you can
[2:50] all be seated just for a moment
[2:52] amen as you know we've got brother Noel
[2:55] Johnson ministering for us this evening
[2:56] so we're very glad to have him back with
[2:59] us again he and his wife sister Shirley
[3:01] God bless you Sister Shirley amen they
[3:03] become good friends of ours and we're
[3:04] always glad to see him come by it's
[3:07] always about this time of year that they
[3:08] come up to work and put their support
[3:11] behind the believer's youth camp in
[3:13] Indiana and so often it works out the
[3:15] way they can stop in so we're glad it
[3:17] worked out this time and with him taking
[3:19] the Wednesday night service it gave me
[3:21] an opportunity to get away for a couple
[3:22] days and I had the privilege of taking
[3:24] my youngest son Jonathan on a
[3:26] backpacking trip so since Monday till
[3:28] this early this morning we were in
[3:30] Manistee National Forest backpacking it
[3:33] amen so if you see me get up and down
[3:35] kind of slow you'll know why I'm Just a
[3:37] Touch sore I've had the privilege of
[3:41] taking each of my sons when they
[3:42] returned about 14 15 on a camping trip
[3:44] just them and I and it's been glorious
[3:46] it's been a wonderful time that we spend
[3:48] just two of us each time but the first
[3:51] time I did it was nine years going those
[3:54] Hills get steeper and my pack gets
[3:55] heavier
[3:56] and so I don't know if I'll be taking my
[3:59] grandchildren or not we'll just see how
[4:01] that goes but we had a wonderful time a
[4:03] little bit sure good to us and and so
[4:05] everything just worked out great the
[4:07] weather looked like it was going to be
[4:08] bad and it turned out to be wonderful it
[4:10] was beautiful so God was good to us but
[4:13] we noticed it got Smokey hazy up there
[4:16] starting yesterday like it's been today
[4:17] and I understand that it's all from
[4:20] wildfires up in Canada I don't know a
[4:22] whole lot about it but I've heard and I
[4:24] thought my this world is under judgment
[4:28] it's reeling under the judgments of God
[4:30] that began when a prophet threw a rock
[4:32] in the air and the earthquake struck
[4:34] Alaska and we're seeing the signs of The
[4:37] Sixth Seal in effect all around us and
[4:39] this is nothing compared to what will
[4:42] happen when the vials pour out under the
[4:43] tribulation period
[4:45] and it's not going to get better
[4:48] but it's going to get worse but I thank
[4:50] God he's already prepared us and he's
[4:52] told us and he's given us a word that'll
[4:55] take us out of here before the full
[4:57] power of that 60 on leashes in the
[4:59] tribulation period so we have to deal
[5:01] with some of these things just like in
[5:04] the judgments that fell upon Egypt you
[5:06] know the first part of the judgments
[5:07] also affected the children of Israel
[5:10] but then there came a time that there
[5:12] was a separation and for us there'll
[5:13] come a time we get the ultimate
[5:15] separation we get a translation and a
[5:18] wedding supper and we have our
[5:20] separation completely from this world
[5:23] amen we thank God God's sure been good
[5:25] to us we're thankful to have brother
[5:27] Noel I really appreciate brother Nolan
[5:29] sister Shirley and the sacrifices that
[5:31] they make their dedication to the
[5:33] ministry that God's given brother Noah
[5:35] and also all the work and the help that
[5:37] they do they're very instrumental
[5:39] helpful with their home Church they help
[5:41] with the missionary Camp they help at
[5:43] byc they travel to India many many times
[5:46] and I'm so thankful for people that are
[5:48] faithful and just willing to be a help
[5:50] anywhere they can be a help and
[5:52] consistent I mean I don't know how many
[5:53] years they've been going to byc to work
[5:55] in the kitchen but how many sister
[5:57] Shirley
[5:59] over 20 years I said God bless them amen
[6:03] and thank you all for your service so
[6:05] they just help wherever that they can
[6:07] help amen and I love that I appreciate
[6:09] that this is your hands

[14:37] we are called unto adoption

[14:51] Gentiles days soon will be over Glory
[14:54] Hallelujah to our God

[15:04] life
[15:07] okay that's all I'm not a singer so I
[15:10] have to call you let you guys rest
[15:12] but I wanted that because that's the
[15:15] message
[15:17] in reality that is the message
[15:20] we're called unto adoption
[15:23] we are called to a changing of our
[15:25] bodies
[15:26] we are called where we will no longer
[15:28] dwell in these temples of flesh but
[15:30] there will be change in the moment and
[15:32] the twinkling of an eye and we will have
[15:34] no more sickness we'll have no more pain
[15:36] we'll have no more Satan we'll have no
[15:38] more troubles we'll have no more
[15:39] problems that is what's coming
[15:42] that is what's coming and it's here
[15:46] but we have to believe that
[15:51] well I'll do that at the end okay
[15:53] um
[15:55] well you're standing I don't like to
[15:57] keep everybody standing um turn over to
[15:59] Hebrews the 10th chapter
[16:01] and read verses 5 through 10.
[16:04] the subject matter is the bride coming
[16:06] of Christ
[16:08] this is something that I've been
[16:10] studying for the last
[16:11] couple three months really I ministered
[16:14] India every other week on an average
[16:18] and this has been the focus I've been
[16:21] trying to teach them
[16:24] and really it's very simple
[16:27] but it takes a revelation from God to
[16:29] understand the simplicity
[16:31] of what God was trying to tell us
[16:33] through the prophet
[16:35] Hebrews chapter 10 starting at verse 5
[16:37] it says wherefore
[16:39] when he cameth into the world he say his
[16:41] sacrifice and offering thou what is not
[16:43] but a body hast thou prepared me and
[16:46] burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin
[16:48] thou Hast no pleasure then said I lo I
[16:51] come in the volume of the book it's
[16:53] written of me to do thy will
[16:56] oh God
[16:57] and let's pray
[17:00] Heavenly Father it is our privilege
[17:03] to gather ourselves together and sing
[17:05] songs of worship and praise and
[17:06] adoration unto you
[17:08] and to realize Lord who you are and what
[17:11] we are in you
[17:13] because Lord you called us you have
[17:15] chosen us you have elected us for the
[17:17] hour in which we are now living that
[17:19] Lord you might fully express your life
[17:21] through us
[17:23] so take me Lord as your servant this
[17:25] evening move me aside I got many
[17:27] thoughts going through my head so Lord
[17:29] you have to organize them and take it
[17:31] and present it in the way that will be
[17:32] understandable to the people
[17:34] Bless the people I pray through your
[17:36] word for I ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[17:39] amen
[17:41] you can be seated
[17:43] just a little update my wife and I went
[17:46] to India this year we left the middle of
[17:48] January we got back into February
[17:53] um I did not want to go I'll be honest
[17:55] and but the Lord opened the door the
[17:59] Lord provided the means the Lord God
[18:01] serves us he managed to supply all the
[18:03] funds and then some
[18:04] and so I felt obligated if you will to
[18:06] obey what I felt the leading of God was
[18:10] so he went over to India and we managed
[18:13] to have traveled around I ministered
[18:15] about every other night when it comes
[18:17] out the average comes down to
[18:19] we did a lot of traveling we went uh we
[18:22] stayed around a Hyderabad area then we
[18:25] went up into the forest area which is up
[18:27] north above well it wouldn't make any
[18:30] difference but anyway and then from
[18:33] there we went over to the east coast we
[18:34] traveled down the East Coast we
[18:36] ministered a bunch of churches that are
[18:37] that we have established
[18:39] one of the things I felt impressed on
[18:42] about three four years ago is we have to
[18:44] take the message and get into their
[18:45] language
[18:47] so I talked with Freddie gray the
[18:48] brother I work with
[18:50] and by my
[18:52] prodding I'll put it that way
[18:54] we managed to have over 350 messages now
[18:57] in the Telugu language which is
[18:59] available to the people that speak that
[19:01] language through the Hub that the
[19:03] Cloverdale house
[19:06] and uh I have been
[19:09] I I prod them periodically to keep it
[19:13] going
[19:14] trying to be nice
[19:16] and uh
[19:18] I mean Shirley and I we went there for
[19:20] the first three weeks it was fine the
[19:22] last three weeks we were sick every day
[19:25] but I went because I felt led
[19:28] I know that where I went to places I I
[19:30] went I said we felt led to go I saw God
[19:33] answer prayer I saw how God moved I saw
[19:35] God working in different things and so I
[19:38] know it was God's will we went why we
[19:40] had to be sick half the time I don't
[19:42] know that's between
[19:43] God maybe we'll reveal that in
[19:46] eternities but I felt had to go so I
[19:48] went I mean there was one time just to
[19:50] let you know what it's like over there I
[19:52] ate something that severely disagreed
[19:54] with me
[19:55] then I got up and I started ministering
[19:57] and 15 minutes into it I had to leave so
[19:59] I could go outside and get rid of some
[20:01] things and then go back and for the next
[20:03] 20 or 30 minutes finish my sermon
[20:06] I was not going to let Satan win
[20:09] I was there I had a message on my heart
[20:11] say you're not going to stop me I'm
[20:13] going to do what I feel led
[20:15] so anyway that was our trip it was very
[20:17] difficult for us this year it really was
[20:19] but I felt led to go I accomplished what
[20:22] I felt God wanted me to accomplish and
[20:24] he brought us back safe and for that I
[20:26] was so grateful
[20:28] when we look at the at the message that
[20:31] the bride coming of Christ
[20:33] like I say I started studying this
[20:35] brother Branham and the rising of the
[20:37] sun he makes a statement as Christ was
[20:39] the first one to raise from the phrase
[20:41] from all the prophets and so forth
[20:42] although typed in many places he was the
[20:45] first fruits of those that slept
[20:47] in the bride coming of Christ
[20:50] coming out of the church they'll have to
[20:52] be there will there will there'll be a
[20:54] chief waved again in the last days and
[20:56] we know that that was the message that
[20:57] was what God had done to us through the
[20:59] prophet but when we talk about the bride
[21:01] coming of Christ
[21:03] it means Christ is going to come and so
[21:05] live in the bride until he will live his
[21:08] life and he will manifest his life
[21:10] through us
[21:12] it's not about us it has nothing to do
[21:16] about us it's about us taking our bodies
[21:19] and yielding them to God so that God can
[21:22] do what God wants to accomplish
[21:25] it's like I say he needs vessels God is
[21:28] a Spirit in order for that Spirit to
[21:30] express itself he has to have a body to
[21:33] live in that's you
[21:35] that's us
[21:37] and but we have to learn to yield to
[21:39] that
[21:40] we have to learn to grasp hold of who we
[21:42] are and what we are brother Brown says
[21:45] we we as the bride we live below our you
[21:47] know below our privileges
[21:49] we have power and we have authority and
[21:52] we sit on it
[21:53] because we don't believe it
[21:55] we don't either believe the word or we
[21:58] don't believe it applies to us or we
[22:00] don't believe Who We Are
[22:02] but once we begin to grasp hold of who
[22:04] we are and what we are and the authority
[22:06] God has given to us and that we have we
[22:09] have the ability to command Satan and
[22:11] when we command Satan he has to obey us
[22:14] not because it's us because it's because
[22:16] as God himself speaking through us
[22:19] and if we can grasp hold of that like I
[22:21] said then all of a sudden our approach
[22:22] to things completely changes
[22:29] you know when we when uh when we read
[22:31] there in Matthew it talks about God has
[22:33] prepared a bride or prepared a body
[22:36] you know God has always prepared bodies
[22:39] we don't we it talks there about Jesus
[22:41] Christ that that is true but do you
[22:43] realize God prepared Moses
[22:46] Moses was a special person God had Moses
[22:48] born at a specific time for a specific
[22:50] purpose but Moses was going to do it on
[22:53] his own God says oh no no I have told
[22:56] Abraham what's going to happen when all
[22:58] of a sudden you deliver them out and you
[23:00] becoming the the Pharaoh and you
[23:02] releasing them without the Judgment
[23:04] coming upon that Nation no that is not
[23:06] what I had told Abraham when you leave
[23:08] Abraham I'm going to judge that Nation
[23:09] I'm going to spoil that Nation
[23:12] and so all of us said Moses had to be
[23:14] willing to submit to God and be able to
[23:17] have God speak to him and that's why the
[23:19] plagues and that's why all the other
[23:20] things came down
[23:22] we go and you look at the prophets you
[23:24] have to realize they when you look at
[23:26] that when you go through the history of
[23:27] Israel you have to begin to realize God
[23:29] chose them for the hour in which they
[23:31] lived because there was the spoke to
[23:33] they were going to speak to a specific
[23:35] group of people and God was going
[23:37] through that prophet he was going to
[23:39] deliver unto them a message
[23:41] and generally speaking the only time the
[23:43] graphite is necessary is when the people
[23:45] begin to drift away from the word of God
[23:46] they begin to do their own things and
[23:48] all of a sudden God has to bring a
[23:50] prophet in the line to bring everything
[23:51] back to the word bring everything back
[23:53] to their focus on God why did God send
[23:55] us a prophet get us back to the word
[23:57] what is he going to do be I will send me
[23:59] Elijah the prophet before the great and
[24:01] Dreadful day of the Lord what was the
[24:03] purpose of that get them back into the
[24:04] word get them back to the faith of the
[24:06] fathers that's why God sent the prophet
[24:08] and so we could we could by looking at
[24:10] the prophet we could understand who we
[24:12] are
[24:14] if you put it all in the prophet you've
[24:15] missed it
[24:16] you say oh that was wonderful God sent a
[24:19] prophet look at all the Miracles God did
[24:20] through him if that's all you see you've
[24:22] missed it because that has to now come
[24:24] down unto us because the god that lived
[24:25] in him also lives in you and the god
[24:28] that delivered in him that lives in you
[24:29] wants to express himself through you the
[24:31] same way he did through that prophet
[24:34] I'm not talking about having the visions
[24:36] and having some of the other Miracles
[24:37] that God had with him but what I'm
[24:39] saying is God Lives in You
[24:41] and if you can be able to grasp the fact
[24:43] that it's gone you know I was at I was
[24:46] raised to trinitarium the father-son
[24:48] Holy Ghost so when we talk about the
[24:50] Holy Ghost living in you that that's
[24:51] fine but that was always the third
[24:53] person of a trinity
[24:54] so I just reverted back no it's God
[24:57] because that's who he is the holy spirit
[24:59] is God so I have God living inside of me
[25:02] but I have to learn how to release him
[25:05] rather than having him all bottled up
[25:07] and and doing my own thing whatever it
[25:10] is all of us said I have to give him the
[25:12] Liberty to take my body and use it where
[25:14] he could express himself through me
[25:16] and so that's opening my heart up that's
[25:18] opening my mouth up and say Lord here I
[25:21] am speak through me
[25:22] it's not about me it's about him it's
[25:24] not what I can do for him it's all about
[25:26] what he what I allow him to do through
[25:28] me why do we go to India we've been
[25:30] there we went there for 15 years or more
[25:33] why do we go
[25:35] God let us
[25:37] what has been accomplished like I say
[25:39] right now there's over 325 or 50
[25:41] messages in the Telugu language
[25:44] that that if nothing else that's
[25:46] something we managed to accomplish and
[25:48] all I did was Supply the money they had
[25:50] to do all the work
[25:52] but I had to prod them periodically
[25:55] okay but but I mean but it's not about
[25:58] me it's not about what I have done it's
[26:00] like one person he came through he was
[26:01] he came in from Canada and says oh look
[26:03] at these are the fruits of your ministry
[26:05] I says it's not my Ministry I don't have
[26:08] one
[26:10] no this is God this is God's work this
[26:12] is what God has accomplished I just
[26:14] happen to be the donkey that carried the
[26:16] carried the the you know the grain or
[26:18] whatever it was
[26:20] you know one of the things with just
[26:21] this way of testimony
[26:24] um I was talking with Freddie gray a
[26:26] couple days ago
[26:28] and about four years ago I guess there's
[26:30] been maybe five we had went out into a
[26:33] remote area and the people didn't have
[26:35] any food
[26:37] and so we went and bought some two bags
[26:39] of rice I don't know how many kilos they
[26:42] were but they were big bags
[26:44] we brought that to the to that Village
[26:47] and gave them food
[26:49] and then the minister we were working
[26:50] with left his wife married somebody else
[26:52] and we can't work with him anymore and
[26:54] so we figured well all the work that
[26:55] we've put into that is gone
[26:57] but then Freddie when he was up in a
[26:59] remote area all of a sudden somebody
[27:01] came and visited with him and he says he
[27:02] says you don't know who I am and Francis
[27:04] but do you remember that time that you
[27:06] took that rice and gave it to those
[27:08] people
[27:09] I said well yeah
[27:11] he said now there's two there's two
[27:13] different congregations forty con 40 in
[27:15] each congregation
[27:19] why do we bring the rice
[27:21] God directed
[27:23] because he had a reason for it to be
[27:25] directed he had a reason for it to be
[27:27] given okay it's not about us it's not
[27:30] what we do it's not we plan all of this
[27:33] stuff
[27:34] basically what we just go along as we we
[27:36] feel that and then just pray well Lord
[27:39] do do something good with it
[27:42] we know that Jeremiah that God had
[27:45] formed God had called him from the from
[27:47] before he was even born
[27:50] and we can read in the Bible and we can
[27:52] read about the prophets we can read
[27:53] about Moses and Jeremiah and all the
[27:55] rest of them and oh yeah they lived in
[27:57] their generation and God used them but
[27:59] you understand that God has raised you
[28:00] up for this purpose
[28:02] do you realize God has called you God
[28:04] has elected you specifically you
[28:07] to be able to accomplish something that
[28:09] he cannot accomplish without you
[28:11] you are to be the full expression of
[28:13] Jesus Christ in this generation
[28:16] and how are you going to do that yield
[28:18] to God
[28:21] when we look at Jesus Christ we
[28:23] understand that he had to come that he
[28:25] that
[28:28] Jesus Christ came different than the
[28:30] rest of us came
[28:32] God took and he created a seed in Mary
[28:34] and from that said that formed the body
[28:37] in which God would come and he would
[28:38] dwell in
[28:39] and when I was thinking about that you
[28:41] realize all of all of us here that when
[28:43] we have kids
[28:45] we can look at our kids well yeah I can
[28:47] see my attribute in this one or my
[28:49] wife's attribute in that one because
[28:51] they're part of us
[28:53] in Adam there was it was the only
[28:55] attribute that was in him was God
[28:58] in Jesus Christ he wasn't he didn't give
[29:01] it anything for Mary
[29:02] all he got was because God himself that
[29:05] was God's attributes living out that out
[29:08] that man when he was born he was the son
[29:11] of God when you were born you were Sons
[29:14] and Daughters of God
[29:16] God ordained you to be who you are and
[29:18] what you are but Jesus Christ he had to
[29:21] overcome his flesh Adam had to overcome
[29:25] his flesh and he failed Jesus Christ had
[29:28] to overcome his flesh
[29:30] and because he did he was sinless
[29:32] because he never doubted he was always
[29:34] obedient to God
[29:36] because it says what in Isaiah 9 and 6
[29:38] it says For unto us a child is born unto
[29:40] us the son is given and the government
[29:42] shall be upon his shoulder his name
[29:44] Shall be Called wonderful counselor the
[29:47] Mighty God the Everlasting father the
[29:50] Prince of Peace
[29:51] when he was born that's who he was
[29:55] but do you realize who you are
[29:58] you are Sons and Daughters of God you
[30:00] are attributes of God that has come into
[30:02] full manifestation
[30:10] in Hebrews one and two it says hath in
[30:13] these last days spoken unto us by his
[30:15] son whom he hath appointed heir of All
[30:17] Things by whom he made the world he made
[30:19] the world when he was in the logos form
[30:21] in the form of the logos that's when he
[30:23] began to speak and everything he spoke
[30:25] it came into manifestation brother
[30:27] Bradham said he had to believe his own
[30:28] word for that word to come into
[30:30] manifestation
[30:31] if he had to believe his word and if we
[30:34] can come to the place we can believe our
[30:35] word if it's anointed by God then that
[30:37] word also becomes creative and that word
[30:39] will create whatever it's sent out to
[30:41] create
[30:43] but we have to believe that
[30:49] and it goes on in Hebrews two and three
[30:51] he says through the brightness of being
[30:53] the brightness of his glory and the
[30:54] express image the exact exact in every
[30:57] aspect
[30:58] being the express image of this person
[31:01] and upholding All Things by his power
[31:02] and when he had prayed when he had when
[31:04] he by himself sat down and purged our
[31:07] sins
[31:08] so he had to ex he had to succeed where
[31:11] Adam himself had failed
[31:13] Jesus Christ God had to take God took on
[31:16] Humanity in Jesus Christ amen
[31:19] amen God did could not understand us
[31:22] until he came in Jesus Christ
[31:24] he he manifested himself through the
[31:27] prophets that is true but until he came
[31:30] in a bodily form and he became flesh
[31:32] like we are he could never understand
[31:34] the things which we go through
[31:36] he could never understand Temptations He
[31:39] could never understand pain he could
[31:40] never understand hunger he could never
[31:42] understand all the things which we
[31:44] experience because the Bible says he was
[31:46] tempted at all points just like we are
[31:48] but yet he never yielded to you never
[31:51] yielded to those Temptations
[31:54] he had in he in order for him to redeem
[31:57] us he had to become our Kinsmen Redeemer
[32:00] that's why God had to be had to come
[32:02] flesh in Jesus Christ
[32:04] he also you know he had to suffer the
[32:06] things he suffered so he could become
[32:08] our high priest
[32:10] I mean if an angel was standing right
[32:11] here how many of you would go up to him
[32:13] and say hey I gotta I got a headache or
[32:15] I got I'm not feeling good could you uh
[32:17] I wouldn't I'd be scared to even
[32:20] approach the man
[32:21] or the being or whatever
[32:24] but I can go to Jesus Christ
[32:27] because I know he understands me
[32:30] he understands who I am he understands
[32:33] my problems he understands my
[32:34] frustrations
[32:36] and so I have no problems going to him
[32:38] and because and and because of that I I
[32:41] lay out my life before him I lay out all
[32:43] my petitions before him
[32:47] but it goes on in Hebrews it goes on
[32:49] also in starting in chapter five
[32:51] starting at six
[32:53] and as he saith also in another place
[32:55] thou art a priest Forever After the
[32:56] order of Melchizedek who in the days of
[32:59] his flesh when he had offered up prayers
[33:00] and supplications with strong crying and
[33:02] tears unto him that was able to save him
[33:04] from death and was hurt and that he
[33:06] feared
[33:08] though he were his son yet learned he
[33:09] obedience by the things that he suffered
[33:12] and being made perfect he became the
[33:14] author of Eternal salvation and all them
[33:16] that believe
[33:17] he feared
[33:19] he knew the cross awaited him
[33:22] he did not want to go there he prayed
[33:25] father if there's any other way let this
[33:27] cup pass
[33:28] in The Gardener of Gethsemane is when he
[33:30] fully surrendered to the will of God
[33:33] because once he had fully surrendered to
[33:35] the will of God then from that point on
[33:37] then then then events would just
[33:40] continue to unfold
[33:41] but he feared that
[33:44] I mean he knew he I mean he knew the
[33:46] scriptures he knew he was going to third
[33:48] day he was going to raise up and you
[33:49] know he knew what was waiting him but
[33:51] yet the process of death was something
[33:53] he had never experienced God didn't God
[33:55] could not experience death because he's
[33:57] God and so this was something which was
[34:00] totally different which would be totally
[34:01] foreign to him
[34:03] he had to be born of the seed of David
[34:05] in order to be able to sit on the throne
[34:08] of David during the time during the
[34:09] Millennium he also had to become the
[34:12] seed of the woman that God had promised
[34:14] Adam in the Garden of Eden
[34:20] depending upon when you go and you read
[34:22] through the scriptures depending upon
[34:24] what you read depends upon how you
[34:27] perceive God to be
[34:28] the Jewish Nation when they looked at
[34:30] God God was a god of wrath and he was a
[34:33] god of judgment
[34:34] they couldn't look Beyond and we also
[34:36] realized he was the god of mercy and
[34:37] Grace and love because the law was there
[34:40] and the law was very judged very judged
[34:42] one guy was down he he wanted to cook
[34:45] his meal
[34:46] happened to be the Sabbath day he went
[34:48] out Gathering a few sticks so he could
[34:49] light them on fire so he could cook his
[34:51] meal
[34:52] because he broke the laws of the Sabbath
[34:54] he was taken out and stoned
[34:57] he wasn't hurting anybody he just wanted
[34:59] to have a hot meal
[35:01] but he broke one of The Commandments of
[35:03] God
[35:04] that cost him his life
[35:07] the law is very severe
[35:10] I mean how many times do we break the
[35:12] law how many times do we do things which
[35:14] we know is displacing to God
[35:17] but yet God gives us grace and mercy and
[35:20] brother Branham he relates that why
[35:21] because we are the wife of Jesus Christ
[35:24] God cannot judge us because he because
[35:27] because he would be judging he would be
[35:29] judging himself
[35:31] and so that be because of who he is and
[35:34] because of who we are in relationship to
[35:36] him that keeps the Judgment off of us
[35:39] until all of a sudden we come to
[35:40] confining reach what God had intended
[35:43] for us to be
[35:45] Jesus Christ was given a commission in
[35:47] his life
[35:49] he talks about that in Luke the fourth
[35:51] chapter
[35:51] so there was delivered unto him the book
[35:53] of the prophet Isaiah and when he had
[35:55] opened the book he found the place where
[35:57] it was written the spirit of the Lord is
[35:59] upon me because he hath anointed me to
[36:00] preach the gospel to the poor he has
[36:02] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[36:04] preach Deliverance to the captives and
[36:06] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[36:08] a liberty them that are bruised and
[36:09] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[36:12] and he closed the book and he sat down
[36:14] and said this day
[36:15] this scripture is fulfilled
[36:18] and John later on when John was in
[36:21] prison and he saw Jesus was they were
[36:24] expecting the king
[36:26] if you go back and you look at the
[36:28] prophecies concerning the birth of John
[36:29] the Baptist they were expecting him to
[36:31] be the Forerunner they were expecting
[36:33] Christ to come they were expecting God
[36:35] to come and set up his kingdom upon the
[36:37] face of the Earth and he was going to
[36:38] rule the world from Jerusalem they were
[36:40] looking for a king
[36:42] not somebody not somebody nice and
[36:44] gentle and meek and Mild going around
[36:46] Healing The Sick and raising the dead
[36:48] and doing good deeds
[36:50] and so John sent his disciples he says
[36:52] are you who are you the Messiah or
[36:54] should we be looking for someone else
[36:56] so Jesus performs a miracle he healed
[36:59] the sick he he cast out demons he did
[37:01] this and he did that and he says now you
[37:04] go and show John what you've seen
[37:06] because what he was doing he says tell
[37:08] John because I am fulfilling what my
[37:10] commission is I am doing what God has
[37:13] sent me here to to do and to fulfill
[37:17] do you understand that is our commission
[37:21] what God we are the continuation of
[37:24] Jesus Christ we are his body literally
[37:26] on the face of this Earth so what are we
[37:28] supposed to be doing we are supposed to
[37:31] be going around and and preaching the
[37:32] gospel of the poor we're supposed to be
[37:34] out um priests delivering so the
[37:36] captives recovering of sight to the
[37:38] blind several Liberty them that are
[37:39] bruised we're supposed to go around and
[37:41] heal the sick and raise the Dead
[37:44] because that was that was what that was
[37:46] the commission of Jesus Christ well that
[37:48] is our commission you go through the
[37:50] book of Acts what did they do they
[37:52] carried on the commission of Jesus
[37:53] Christ well what is it supposed what did
[37:55] Brother Branham do he carried on the
[37:57] commission of Jesus Christ
[37:59] with brother Branham it was never
[38:01] anything about him
[38:02] in one place he says not about me he
[38:05] says I'm just standing there when he
[38:06] does it all of a sudden when somebody
[38:08] comes in their prayer line all of a
[38:10] sudden brother Branham gives his body
[38:11] over to God and God begins to speak
[38:13] through him and begins to reveal the
[38:15] secrets of the heart that wasn't brother
[38:16] he would have no way of knowing that
[38:19] no that was gone
[38:21] but see now it comes down into us we
[38:23] don't have that discernment but I've met
[38:25] a couple of ministers which do I mean
[38:27] there was one guy
[38:30] um he called up and was talking to the
[38:32] minister and kind of telling you know
[38:34] reading him the riot act so to speak and
[38:36] all of a sudden God gave him a vision he
[38:38] says you're sitting in front of your
[38:40] computer and you're looking at
[38:41] pornography where you're looking at
[38:43] pornography and you've done this and
[38:45] this against your wife about that time
[38:47] the other guy hung up
[38:49] God revealed to that brother what the
[38:51] other brother was doing because
[38:53] discernment is still there it's still
[38:55] within the body of Jesus Christ
[38:57] I know when I was preaching there in
[38:59] India this time all of a sudden I got on
[39:01] a subject I had didn't even have it in
[39:03] my notes and I covered the subject and
[39:05] went on and and and brother Freddie told
[39:08] me afterwards he says you may not
[39:09] realize it but there were some people
[39:11] that were believing this false Doctrine
[39:13] and you hid it
[39:14] well okay I didn't know
[39:17] I was ignorant but yet God God saw fit
[39:20] to do it that way
[39:25] Jesus Christ took 12 men
[39:28] and had them follow him wherever he went
[39:32] he wanted them to follow him so that
[39:34] they could see Miracles being performed
[39:36] so they could see their demons being
[39:37] cast out so they could see the dead
[39:39] being raised up
[39:40] so that they could begin to realize the
[39:43] power that God that the power that Jesus
[39:45] Christ possessed
[39:47] but then he goes on he says I'm giving
[39:49] you the authority to do the same thing
[39:51] you see it in me
[39:53] he sent him out two by two in the
[39:55] surrounding communities where they went
[39:58] out all of a sudden they came back with
[39:59] it with the praise report oh yeah we
[40:02] prayed for this and all of a
[40:03] sudden he walked we prayed for this
[40:05] person they rose from the dead we prayed
[40:07] for this person we prayed for that
[40:08] person and they could repeat all the
[40:10] Miracles
[40:11] they had the authority by Jesus Christ
[40:13] he gave them that Authority amen
[40:17] we have the same Authority
[40:21] but do we are we willing to exercise
[40:23] that Authority
[40:25] I mean everybody you know if somebody is
[40:27] sick they call for the pastor why don't
[40:30] you pray
[40:31] the same God dwells in you dwells in him
[40:35] I'm not you know trying to say we don't
[40:37] need a pastor don't get me wrong on that
[40:38] but what I'm saying is the same God that
[40:40] dwells in him dwells in you so what is
[40:43] why don't you think your prayers have
[40:45] any value
[40:46] do you think you have to get somebody
[40:48] super spiritual and you think so highly
[40:50] of him and you think he's he's an angel
[40:52] sent from God down here that's sinless
[40:54] no he's like he's a human being just
[40:56] like you are he has he has
[40:59] well he has frozen I have faults and
[41:02] failures I'll leave him alone
[41:06] but we have to begin to understand who
[41:09] Who We Are
[41:10] we have to begin to have faith in what
[41:12] God has told us we can do
[41:15] I mean there there have been there there
[41:17] have been times and I'm well one example
[41:19] just there was a
[41:22] couple of months ago anyway my wife was
[41:26] coughing
[41:28] well it was late I was tired I wanted to
[41:31] go to bed get some sleep
[41:34] because her coughing was keeping me
[41:36] awake
[41:37] she went into the front room she laid
[41:39] down in the easy chair
[41:41] she was trying she was trying to get
[41:43] some sleep too
[41:45] and finally I I got mad
[41:48] so I went into where she was laying down
[41:49] I said Satan I am tired of you keeping
[41:52] me awake I am tired of you harassing my
[41:55] wife you have no business in this house
[41:57] get out
[41:58] I wasn't even nice to him
[42:01] you know what she stopped coughing I got
[42:04] some sleep and she got some sleep
[42:07] but it's that simple
[42:10] it is that simple
[42:13] it's like we were we were we were at a
[42:15] meeting recently
[42:17] this brother showed me his hand and he
[42:19] had it had been crushed slightly and he
[42:22] had lost he had lost feeling in two of
[42:24] his fingers
[42:26] and uh so I looked at it and says do you
[42:29] believe God can heal and
[42:30] he kind of looked at me and so I just
[42:32] put my hand on his and I said Lord the
[42:34] name of Jesus Christ restore their
[42:36] feeling
[42:38] he looked at me and I says
[42:40] I believe that when I pray God hears
[42:44] and I believe in God and I believe God
[42:46] hears I believe God answers my prayer
[42:48] not because I am anything
[42:51] but I am I am a vessel that I'm trying
[42:54] to yield myself to God so that God
[42:57] through me can express himself to others
[42:59] it has nothing to do with me I am not
[43:02] super spiritual I am not super righteous
[43:04] in fact one of the examples that that
[43:06] when we were in India
[43:09] a number of years ago and and I like to
[43:12] be punctual
[43:13] anyway I was with brothers and they like
[43:15] they after we had a meeting a service
[43:18] they sat down to eat
[43:21] and I looked at my watch every I knew
[43:23] how long it's to go to the next meeting
[43:25] so about an hour and a half two hours
[43:27] later we left
[43:30] and the sun was setting in the village
[43:31] we were coming to and I was fit to be
[43:33] tied
[43:34] okay
[43:36] and all of a sudden we get there and as
[43:38] we're going into the village all of a
[43:39] sudden this guy stands up and waves at
[43:41] us emergency pray emergency pray and I
[43:44] figured great
[43:45] now what
[43:47] so they would walk me down this pathway
[43:50] you know I mean it did to a shack
[43:53] I mean they don't have nice houses and
[43:55] he's not out in The Villages
[43:57] anyway went in there and there was this
[43:58] young lady probably mid-20s it'd be my
[44:00] guess her husband had died a couple of
[44:02] her kids had died and so
[44:05] preacher zelder you have an evil Wicked
[44:08] Spirit in order for that Spirit to go
[44:11] you have to fast 40 days and 40 nights
[44:15] and she did
[44:17] but they
[44:19] she didn't have the mass she didn't have
[44:21] the nutrients and within her body to
[44:23] sustain her
[44:25] and so after a while I don't know how
[44:27] long it had been but they had taken her
[44:28] the hospital the hospital says we can't
[44:30] do anything
[44:31] all of her organs are shutting down
[44:34] take her home and you know put her in
[44:36] the casket and bury her
[44:37] so I went in and
[44:39] I looked at the situation and I said
[44:42] I said Lord don't look at the stupidity
[44:44] of the ACT but look at the sincerity of
[44:46] her heart
[44:47] and give her her life back
[44:50] and God honored that
[44:54] I was in a very I was upset I was mad
[44:59] but yet even in spite of that God
[45:01] managed to get through me to minister to
[45:04] her
[45:05] you don't have to be in the best of
[45:07] moods you just have to learn how to
[45:09] yield to God you have to learn to
[45:11] release the god that is within you
[45:14] without the authority Jesus Christ had
[45:16] given them they could have done nothing
[45:19] without that Authority we can do nothing
[45:22] but if you realize you have that
[45:24] Authority
[45:25] you have the authority to pray for the
[45:27] sick and to raise the dead and cast out
[45:29] demons freely he said you've received it
[45:31] freely give it out but you have to
[45:33] believe that you have to believe that
[45:36] God is in you you have to believe that
[45:38] God will hear and answer your prayer
[45:41] it goes on and just before the just
[45:43] before Christ's crucifixion he goes he
[45:46] makes a prayer he says neither I pray
[45:48] for these alone but for them also which
[45:50] Shall Believe on me through their word
[45:51] that they may be one as thou father art
[45:54] in me and I indeed that they also may be
[45:58] one in us that the world may believe
[46:00] that thou has sent me and the glory
[46:03] which thou gavest me I have given them
[46:05] that they may be one even as we are one
[46:07] i in them thou in me that they me may be
[46:10] perfect in one
[46:13] he had told them you need to be you
[46:15] there needs to be a Unity a Oneness not
[46:19] necessarily amongst themselves but there
[46:21] has to be a unity and a Oneness with God
[46:24] as Jesus Christ and God is because God
[46:27] dwelt in Jesus Christ that's what made
[46:29] him and the him and him and the father
[46:30] won
[46:32] well when you receive the Holy Spirit
[46:34] what did you receive
[46:36] you received God
[46:38] well if you received God that means God
[46:40] dwells in you
[46:42] well this is what Jesus Christ was
[46:44] saying that I will be in them and they
[46:45] will be in me and we all together will
[46:47] be in being be in the father
[46:50] and this didn't happen to them actually
[46:52] until the day after today a Pentecost
[46:54] and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit came
[46:55] upon them in the upper room and if you
[46:58] notice their life from that point on it
[46:59] changed they were debating who is going
[47:02] to be the great one they weren't going
[47:03] to be debating who is going to sit on
[47:05] the right hand and who's going to sit on
[47:06] the left hand no they realize now they
[47:08] had a commission and now God was living
[47:10] in them and God was guiding and
[47:12] directing their lives
[47:18] they came just as Jesus Christ was
[47:21] ascending they said are you gonna when
[47:23] are you going to restore the kingdom to
[47:24] Israel
[47:26] Jesus says it it's not for you to know
[47:28] the times of the seasons
[47:31] um which the father put into his own
[47:32] power but you will receive power after
[47:34] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[47:36] and then you'll be Witnesses
[47:39] Jesus Christ could not begin his
[47:41] ministry until the River Jordan when God
[47:44] came down and dwelt in that body in its
[47:47] fullness that's when Jesus Christ became
[47:49] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[47:52] when you receive the Holy Spirit what
[47:54] have you received God now of living in
[47:56] you if God is now living in you it's the
[47:59] same thing as what God did in Jesus
[48:02] Christ same thing as when God did and
[48:04] brother Brad I'm saying thing that God
[48:05] did in Paul say anything that God has
[48:07] done all through in everybody within the
[48:09] church
[48:10] because now the church is the literal
[48:12] body of Jesus Christ
[48:14] you know I studied you know what is the
[48:16] function of a church
[48:18] God took a numerian place to seed
[48:21] Mary was the carrier of that seed
[48:25] she had to nurture that seed until that
[48:28] seed could come to maturity and be born
[48:31] through seven Church ages what has
[48:33] happened that seed was planted on the
[48:35] day of Pentecost it had to go and it had
[48:37] to die but then all of a sudden in
[48:39] Luther all of a sudden there's that
[48:41] surgery that seed began to germinate and
[48:43] what was what was the what was the
[48:45] purpose of the function of what was the
[48:47] purpose of the functional during this
[48:48] time to take that seed to take the life
[48:51] of God itself and to nurture it and to
[48:54] carry it all the way through those
[48:55] Church ages until finally we come into
[48:57] this church age
[48:59] and what is in this church age that seed
[49:02] has to come to maturity
[49:03] the seed has to come into full
[49:05] manifestation the full expression that
[49:08] could not happen until this age that's
[49:10] why we're talking about the bride coming
[49:11] of Jesus Christ that's why we're talking
[49:13] about God coming to full manifestation
[49:15] expression in the bride because we that
[49:19] seed has to come to full expression in
[49:21] you
[49:23] but you have to believe that
[49:34] it says in what in second Corinthians
[49:36] therefore If any man be in Christ he's a
[49:37] new creation all things are passed away
[49:39] and everything has become new
[49:45] in Philippians 2 and 5 it makes a
[49:47] statement
[49:49] it says Paul writing he says let this
[49:52] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[49:54] Jesus
[49:55] who being in the form of God thought a
[49:57] not robbery to be equal with God
[50:00] but he made himself of no reputation and
[50:02] took upon him the form of a servant and
[50:05] was made in the likeness of men and
[50:08] being found in fashion as a man he
[50:10] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[50:12] death even the death of the cross
[50:15] we look at that at Jesus Christ and we
[50:18] know that that is true have you ever
[50:20] began to try to apply that to you
[50:25] let this mind be in you which was also
[50:27] in Christ so being in the form of God
[50:29] you are an attribute of God isn't that a
[50:31] form
[50:32] you are an attribute of God
[50:35] yes okay so where does God live he lives
[50:38] inside of you
[50:39] and so Jesus said he did not think it
[50:41] robbery to reclaim equality with God
[50:45] for us to claim equality with God's a
[50:48] big step
[50:50] but the equality with God doesn't make
[50:52] us proud it doesn't make us puffed up it
[50:54] doesn't make us think we're all powerful
[50:55] and we can go and do our own thing
[50:57] because the only way the only way that
[50:59] the only way that the power of God works
[51:01] through us is if God anoints that
[51:03] anoints the word of us and he and he
[51:05] begins to anoint our body and he begins
[51:07] to guide and direct us to the things
[51:08] which we say
[51:10] the brother Branham could have gone out
[51:12] any day and when he goes squirrel
[51:14] hunting he could have gone out and you
[51:16] know it wasn't it was not within him to
[51:18] speak squirrels
[51:21] until God gave him the unction
[51:23] what are you out here for get some
[51:25] squirrels well how many do you need well
[51:28] I need three
[51:29] well
[51:30] so he spoke
[51:32] one came and
[51:34] the angel says I said I thought you said
[51:36] three
[51:38] well
[51:39] so then he spoke the next one
[51:42] and finally he spoke the Third
[51:44] but that was under the unction and the
[51:46] anointing of God himself God directed
[51:50] we cannot go out and just speak
[51:53] unless it's under the unction of the
[51:54] direction of God
[51:56] but there are times when actually that
[51:58] happens within our lives we happen to be
[52:00] down in Jamaica one year and there was a
[52:03] there was a hurricane which was coming
[52:05] and approaching it it was going to go
[52:07] right over the top of us
[52:09] and we just we began to pray not only me
[52:12] but some other ones he says well Lord we
[52:14] want you to direct the path instead of
[52:15] going this way we want to have it do
[52:17] this way
[52:19] and that's exactly what it did
[52:23] because we
[52:24] commanded it for lack of a better way of
[52:27] putting it
[52:29] I know I was with my brother and we were
[52:31] in Arkansas there was a tornado coming
[52:34] and he was going right where we were at
[52:35] I said Lord that thing has to go around
[52:37] us
[52:39] it splitted into two went around us
[52:41] joined back together again and continued
[52:43] going
[52:46] why did God honor that
[52:49] I don't know I'm thankful he did because
[52:51] tornadoes I'll pick you up and send you
[52:53] where you don't want to go
[52:56] but that power lies in you
[53:00] but you have to believe that
[53:03] you have to believe that whatever you
[53:05] say if it's under the unction and the
[53:07] anointing of God God will perform
[53:09] exactly what came out of your mouth
[53:12] now it's like we've been cautioning some
[53:14] people
[53:15] um
[53:15] be careful what what you say with your
[53:18] mouth
[53:19] because you might get something you're
[53:21] not anticipating
[53:23] you know there was well where there was
[53:26] one sister oh I want to experience ever
[53:28] everything every any everything possible
[53:30] that you can experience as a woman in
[53:32] childbirth
[53:34] I said lady you don't know what you
[53:36] opened up your mouth and said I haven't
[53:39] had any babies my wife has had plenty
[53:41] yeah okay
[53:42] so now all of a sudden when she has
[53:44] morning sickness and she has this pain
[53:46] and she has that pain I figured
[53:48] you asked for it lady you know I mean we
[53:51] still pray try and be nice but
[53:54] um
[53:55] anyway
[53:56] but like one one guy he was saying he
[53:58] says well Lord he says why am I having
[54:00] all these problems God says you asked
[54:02] for it
[54:04] what do you mean I asked for it well
[54:06] didn't you pray Lord whatever it takes
[54:10] you asked for it
[54:13] okay believe that alone
[54:18] but see
[54:21] if we could begin to understand what
[54:23] what dwells in US
[54:27] we are in the for we are an attribute of
[54:29] God expressed we were in the mind of God
[54:32] in the beginning in the process of time
[54:34] we came into manifestation
[54:36] well so because we are an attribute of
[54:39] God because we are Sons and Daughters we
[54:41] are coming to adoption
[54:43] adoption is what we say is the same as
[54:46] God himself speaking
[54:48] that is where this generation is come
[54:50] this we are predestinated to adoption we
[54:53] are predestinated to come into that
[54:54] manifestation
[54:57] but do you believe that
[54:59] because if you believe that you would
[55:01] begin to act that way you would begin
[55:02] you would begin to to function in your
[55:04] mind and begin to begin to go through
[55:06] the scriptures and begin to realize what
[55:08] is God where does he dwell how does he
[55:10] live in me how am I going to express him
[55:13] how am I going to do this and but and
[55:15] the closer you get to him
[55:18] the more you realize that you're nothing
[55:21] that all you are is the vessel he wants
[55:24] to use
[55:25] you have to die so he can live his life
[55:28] through you in fact the only life that
[55:30] says you know we we're supposed to live
[55:33] lives as Christians
[55:35] the only life that God honors and
[55:37] respects is his own
[55:38] because there's no way I mean
[55:42] we make mistakes every day we make
[55:44] mistakes sometimes just before we even
[55:45] get out of bed
[55:47] but if we begin to understand well Lord
[55:49] I'm here at your service today use me
[55:52] however you see fit and then all of a
[55:54] sudden I mean we get up and I have I
[55:56] make a list of things I want to
[55:57] accomplish all of a sudden something
[56:00] will come up we'll throw away that list
[56:01] now we'll learn you obviously had
[56:03] something else planned for today so lead
[56:05] me where you want me to go
[56:07] but there has to be a willingness to
[56:09] yield
[56:11] instead of a stubbornness no I'm going
[56:13] to do this today because I've got to get
[56:15] this done
[56:16] well you may have just missed God
[56:20] it says and but Jesus Christ
[56:23] um
[56:24] when he was put in the form of a man
[56:26] in every aspect he was a servant
[56:30] he served others
[56:34] we are to serve others
[56:37] it's not about us gaining ourselves it's
[56:40] not about us using the power for
[56:42] ourselves it's not about us gaining
[56:43] things no it's about us learning how to
[56:45] serve and meet the needs of other people
[56:49] because I mean that's what Jesus Christ
[56:51] did
[56:52] well if somebody has a need and you have
[56:54] the ability to fulfill it you should be
[56:56] doing that
[56:57] I mean why do we go to India because
[56:59] there's needs over there and so we take
[57:01] what we can and we try to supply what we
[57:03] can to them as much as God will give me
[57:05] to give to them I mean
[57:08] um
[57:09] but this is where we all have to be we
[57:11] have to learn to be servants
[57:17] and then being found in fashion as a man
[57:19] he humbled himself and became obedient
[57:21] even to die on a cross
[57:24] there are times that God asks us to do
[57:26] things that to us make no sense
[57:30] are you willing to submit
[57:32] are you willing to go where he would
[57:34] guide and direct you to go regardless of
[57:36] the circumstances
[57:38] like I say I didn't want to go to India
[57:40] this this year
[57:42] God directed
[57:44] and like I say it was very difficult
[57:45] here for us
[57:48] but I went because I felt God you
[57:50] directed you supplied the needs you
[57:52] opened the door I have no choice but to
[57:54] follow I didn't know what was waiting
[57:56] for me when we got there
[57:58] I'm glad he didn't tell me ahead of time
[58:00] I for sure wouldn't have gone
[58:02] but I mean but here again we're servants
[58:05] to other people we go we minister to I
[58:07] mean
[58:08] when when we go into India there's
[58:10] places and and I have to speak through a
[58:12] translator
[58:13] and then I look at the people that are
[58:15] out there and a lot of those people are
[58:17] borderline literate
[58:19] and I figure how much of the message do
[58:21] they understand or comprehend
[58:24] and because I I was wondering what why
[58:27] am I putting forth the effort why am I
[58:29] going and doing the things that I'm
[58:31] doing
[58:32] and and they don't have to understand
[58:34] the message they have to understand who
[58:37] they are in Jesus Christ
[58:39] because if they can understand who they
[58:41] are in Jesus Christ that is the message
[58:43] they don't have to understand the
[58:45] mystery of the Seven Seals and all the
[58:46] other types of things all they have to
[58:48] do is realize that God has called them
[58:50] God has chosen them and they are trying
[58:52] with everything that they can to live a
[58:54] life that they believe is pleasing unto
[58:56] God
[59:08] in the padma's vision brother Bradham
[59:10] makes some statements
[59:12] he says this morning was more of the
[59:14] sermon type placing the foundation upon
[59:16] the deity of the revelation God being
[59:19] revealed in Christ
[59:21] oh how many believes it God was revealed
[59:24] in Christ Jehovah revealed in Christ now
[59:28] where is God to be revealed in his
[59:30] church with his people
[59:32] in US
[59:34] so the same way that God lived and
[59:36] expressed himself in the body we call
[59:39] Jesus Christ in the same way he wants to
[59:42] express himself through you
[59:46] he wants to manifest the same healing
[59:48] the same Miracles the same
[59:49] manifestations but also when you get
[59:51] into it he also he gets into he says the
[59:53] same Spirit the same works the same
[59:56] manifestation the Same Love
[59:58] the same forgiveness the same
[1:00:01] long-suffering gentleness patience peace
[1:00:05] Mercy all that all that all that was in
[1:00:09] Christ is now in the church
[1:00:11] it's the character
[1:00:14] it's the character you you met you the
[1:00:17] way you live and the way you act
[1:00:19] manifest what you are
[1:00:22] if Christ is in you you will you will
[1:00:25] those attributes of God will be made
[1:00:27] manifest
[1:00:28] there are some days I don't succeed
[1:00:31] and everybody reminds me I didn't
[1:00:33] succeed
[1:00:35] but yet there's something inside of me
[1:00:37] that is changing me from what I was to
[1:00:40] what I am
[1:00:41] I am not what I used to be last year I'm
[1:00:44] different than what I was
[1:00:46] and if God tarries I'll be different
[1:00:48] next year
[1:00:49] because there's something inside of me
[1:00:52] that is beginning to change me and to
[1:00:53] mold me not it's not me trying to
[1:00:56] conform
[1:00:57] Conformity he doesn't doesn't do any
[1:00:59] good because you're still you
[1:01:01] no but it's something inside of you
[1:01:03] where your very nature is being changed
[1:01:05] into the very nature of God himself and
[1:01:08] when the nature of God himself comes a
[1:01:10] full manifestation expression in you
[1:01:12] then people will go and they begin to
[1:01:13] look at you and know why are you so
[1:01:15] different
[1:01:16] you know it's like when we go and we you
[1:01:19] go grocery shopping
[1:01:21] I don't like the spirits of most of the
[1:01:23] people that I meet
[1:01:24] and then okay
[1:01:27] but brother Branham says we can create
[1:01:29] our own world and go live on it
[1:01:32] well I've asked to go to Mars although
[1:01:34] there's air is not real good there Venus
[1:01:38] is too hot Jupiter is too cold well Lord
[1:01:41] I mean what else can I do you know
[1:01:43] um so what I try to do is I create my
[1:01:46] own world
[1:01:48] a world I live in
[1:01:51] and so in that world that I live in
[1:01:53] there's gentleness there's patience
[1:01:54] there's meekness there's kindness
[1:01:57] and so wherever I go I we like we go to
[1:02:00] the grocery store and with one lady
[1:02:01] they're always supposed to say how are
[1:02:03] you doing
[1:02:04] and depending on how they act well I
[1:02:06] know what kind of day they're having you
[1:02:08] know
[1:02:09] but I ask well how are you doing
[1:02:12] oh
[1:02:14] um I'm all right
[1:02:16] isn't it a beautiful day outside
[1:02:18] well
[1:02:20] yeah isn't it great to be alive
[1:02:23] well
[1:02:24] um yeah
[1:02:26] you know and so you begin to change
[1:02:28] there I'm inviting them into my world
[1:02:32] I'm inviting them to experience what I
[1:02:34] live in
[1:02:35] because what the world are what our
[1:02:38] world is doing now I want nothing to do
[1:02:40] with it
[1:02:41] but yet I want to take I want to present
[1:02:43] I want to take my world and I want to
[1:02:45] create my world such that such that all
[1:02:48] the attributes of Jesus Christ is now
[1:02:49] living within this world
[1:02:52] and then wherever I go I want them to
[1:02:54] see that world I want them to experience
[1:02:56] as much as they can because you know
[1:02:58] you're the only God they'll still see
[1:03:01] people are looking for sincerity their
[1:03:03] people are looking for truth
[1:03:05] well we're the only ones that have it
[1:03:08] so unless you present it to them they'll
[1:03:10] never they'll never see it
[1:03:16] in Christ The Mystery of God revealed or
[1:03:19] if God can get him prisoners like that
[1:03:21] speaking of Paul now that's when he can
[1:03:23] express the pre-evidence you see he's
[1:03:26] got the man or the person's so that he
[1:03:29] knows nothing but Christ you get what I
[1:03:32] mean he said first to express himself
[1:03:34] completely that was God in Christ second
[1:03:37] to have the preeminence by this in his
[1:03:39] church which is his body the bride until
[1:03:42] he that being God can have the
[1:03:44] preeminence to express himself through
[1:03:46] them
[1:03:48] it's God coming in you it's God
[1:03:50] expressing himself through you it's God
[1:03:53] taking possession of your body and using
[1:03:55] your body where he can begin to reach
[1:03:57] out and speak unto other people
[1:04:01] you know when you when you go and you
[1:04:03] begin to look in the book of Acts
[1:04:06] you know Paul was a mighty man of God he
[1:04:09] was led by the spirit
[1:04:11] and uh but when you begin to look at
[1:04:13] Paul's life you realize Paul was still
[1:04:15] Paul
[1:04:17] he still had a temper
[1:04:19] he still had his opinions he still had
[1:04:21] his likes and his dislikes
[1:04:24] but yet he had to take and surrender all
[1:04:26] of that to God he said I have to Die
[1:04:28] daily
[1:04:29] so that God can express himself through
[1:04:31] me
[1:04:32] brother Branham was a man
[1:04:34] he had things he liked he had things he
[1:04:36] didn't like he hated cats I know he
[1:04:39] mentioned that more than once but
[1:04:41] but what I'm trying to say is in his
[1:04:45] Humanity he was a human being
[1:04:48] but yet look what God was able to do
[1:04:50] through him
[1:04:52] because all of a sudden when God had
[1:04:54] need of him like brother Brandon made
[1:04:55] mention one place they were up they were
[1:04:57] driving up to the Alaskan Highway and
[1:04:58] they stopped in to get something to eat
[1:05:00] and there they were there and they had
[1:05:02] ordered some food I think it was and all
[1:05:03] of a sudden another car pulled up and
[1:05:05] brother Bradham realized that was the
[1:05:07] guy in the meeting that was in the army
[1:05:10] or Air Force and he was trying to commit
[1:05:11] suicide
[1:05:12] and all of a sudden the the what I heard
[1:05:15] from the other ministers is all of a
[1:05:17] sudden the whole expression of the
[1:05:19] Branham changed
[1:05:21] and he went over to that man
[1:05:24] and he ministered to his need
[1:05:27] it wasn't brother Branham doing
[1:05:29] it was God doing through him
[1:05:32] and see this is where we come
[1:05:35] we all of us that we come to we come
[1:05:37] across other people and they have needs
[1:05:40] I mean it's like we were this lady she
[1:05:43] brought she brought some stuff to my
[1:05:44] wife for alterations and she had a
[1:05:46] severe headache and we're part of an old
[1:05:48] folks choir okay we're old enough to be
[1:05:51] part of it
[1:05:53] and anyway so this lady had brought my
[1:05:55] wife some alterations
[1:05:58] and my wife looked at her and says
[1:06:00] you're not feeling good I said well I
[1:06:02] got a headache
[1:06:04] so surely just reached out and put her
[1:06:05] hands on her and prayed
[1:06:07] okay and the lady said instantly he was
[1:06:11] gone
[1:06:12] instantly
[1:06:14] and that was a witness to this old folks
[1:06:16] choir
[1:06:18] when Noel and Shirley come and they pray
[1:06:20] man God hears God will answer you know
[1:06:23] so that's the witness that we have to
[1:06:26] them
[1:06:28] but now we have to live lives
[1:06:30] making it so that they will they can
[1:06:33] look past our humanity and realize okay
[1:06:35] that it's God doing something through
[1:06:38] but we there to minister
[1:06:41] I mean we didn't put in prayer requests
[1:06:43] at our church and read it call it the
[1:06:44] pastor
[1:06:45] no I mean God lives in us why not use
[1:06:48] why not release him okay
[1:06:52] and the lady I see in church age brother
[1:06:54] about it makes the statement
[1:06:55] it says as he stands here revealing who
[1:06:58] he is in this last age he calls himself
[1:07:01] the author of the creation of God
[1:07:05] Jesus Christ in this age is the author
[1:07:08] of the creation of God okay
[1:07:12] this is another creation this has to do
[1:07:14] with the church special designation of
[1:07:16] himself he is the creator of that church
[1:07:19] the Heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:07:21] bride
[1:07:23] what was he doing he was creating God in
[1:07:26] us
[1:07:32] says it goes on down here he says what
[1:07:35] was Jesus Christ he was the god man he
[1:07:38] was the son of God he was of the new
[1:07:40] creation man and God met and joined he
[1:07:43] was the first of a new race and he was
[1:07:46] the head of that race he said there you
[1:07:48] can see through Matt though man was of
[1:07:50] the old order of creation Now in Union
[1:07:52] with Christ he because he became a new a
[1:07:56] new creation of God
[1:07:58] his new creation is not the old creation
[1:08:00] made over it could not be called a new
[1:08:02] creation this is exactly what he says
[1:08:03] it's a new creation it's another
[1:08:05] creation distinct from the old one no
[1:08:07] longer is he dealing by the ways of
[1:08:09] Flesh that is how he dealt with Israel
[1:08:11] he chose Abraham and Abraham's issue
[1:08:13] Through The Godly line Isaac line but
[1:08:15] now out of every Kindred tribe and
[1:08:17] Nation he has purposed a new creation he
[1:08:19] was the first of that creation he was
[1:08:22] God created in the form of man
[1:08:24] Now by his Spirit he is creating many
[1:08:27] sons unto himself God the Creator
[1:08:29] creating himself a part of his creation
[1:08:33] God is creating himself in you
[1:08:40] where you literally become a full
[1:08:42] manifestation and expression of God
[1:08:44] himself
[1:08:46] I mean that's that's that's
[1:08:48] hard and hard to grasp and understand
[1:08:50] but how is this possible
[1:08:53] because he plays within you a seed
[1:08:56] that seed can only produce the life that
[1:08:59] is in it the life of the seed that was
[1:09:01] in you was God what can it produce it
[1:09:04] can only produce God now that seed has
[1:09:06] to come to full manifestation has to
[1:09:08] come to full maturity and so what is it
[1:09:10] trying to do now that seed that was
[1:09:12] placed in you is trying to come into
[1:09:14] full manifestation expression where you
[1:09:16] yourself will be the full expression of
[1:09:18] God himself just like God came in Jesus
[1:09:20] Christ now God is coming in you
[1:09:22] because God wants to express himself
[1:09:25] through you
[1:09:26] but you have to yield to him
[1:09:30] it isn't what's it isn't you trying to
[1:09:32] do something for God it's you dying out
[1:09:34] to yourself so God can live his life
[1:09:36] through you so all of a sudden now God
[1:09:37] has a vessel so that so that he he can
[1:09:40] do what he's wanting to do through you
[1:09:42] I mean you you look at what I'm part of
[1:09:45] the fire department I volunteer
[1:09:48] um
[1:09:49] we go to the biggest problem we have is
[1:09:51] is the drug overdoses
[1:09:54] and when you go into a house and you see
[1:09:56] these guys which have been which have
[1:09:58] that Spirit on them
[1:10:00] that Spirit controls that body
[1:10:04] I mean he has no he has no control of
[1:10:06] himself that Spirit literally controls
[1:10:08] that body
[1:10:09] and so we give him Narcan try and bring
[1:10:12] him around and and sometimes we're
[1:10:14] successful sometimes we're not
[1:10:16] but it's interesting to look and to look
[1:10:18] at the household and look at the the way
[1:10:20] they're living and all the other that
[1:10:22] that demon is so has so possessed them
[1:10:24] where really they have no control over
[1:10:26] any aspect of their life
[1:10:30] well flip that over to the other side
[1:10:33] if we will take and allow God to have
[1:10:35] total possession of us
[1:10:37] then then then he can do through us the
[1:10:40] same thing he did through brother
[1:10:41] Branham or Jesus Christ or Paul or Peter
[1:10:43] or any of the rest of them if it's us
[1:10:45] yielding to him it's us allowing him to
[1:10:48] have total preeminence and control in
[1:10:50] our lives
[1:10:51] and that's where we have to come
[1:10:54] because we're the Bride of this age
[1:10:56] we're this is this is what we're
[1:10:58] predestinated to we are predestinated to
[1:11:00] be conformed to the image of his son we
[1:11:02] will be exact image exact replica of him
[1:11:05] but also remember Paul was still Paul
[1:11:07] brother Brandon was still brother
[1:11:09] Branham okay they still lived in temples
[1:11:10] of clay they still had them I mean there
[1:11:13] was there was still a lot of them around
[1:11:14] there's a lot of me around I know that
[1:11:17] and the more I eat the more of me there
[1:11:19] is
[1:11:20] but we have to begin on
[1:11:23] never mind
[1:11:29] but the more the more I can yield to God
[1:11:33] the more he can use me
[1:11:36] is whenever I decide I'm going to do you
[1:11:39] know if I say I'm going to do something
[1:11:41] for God he's saying I don't want you to
[1:11:44] I want you to yield to me so I can do
[1:11:46] something through you
[1:11:54] in perfect faith brother Banner makes a
[1:11:56] statement he said they had the word and
[1:11:57] the Word was flesh then that was in
[1:11:59] Jesus Christ and the word told them I
[1:12:02] give you power I power amen I give you
[1:12:05] power and they have the power but they
[1:12:07] didn't have the faith to operate the
[1:12:09] word that was in them the word that
[1:12:12] Jesus Christ had given to them the
[1:12:13] authority that God Jesus Christ had
[1:12:15] given to them yeah they had the
[1:12:17] authority but they did not have the they
[1:12:19] did not have the faith to believe in
[1:12:21] that Authority which was just given unto
[1:12:23] them
[1:12:24] and going on in that says he had Faith
[1:12:27] talking about Jesus Christ he had he had
[1:12:29] Faith with his power how did he he said
[1:12:32] I can do nothing but in myself why he
[1:12:35] relied upon what he was he relied in
[1:12:38] knowing that he was the word and that he
[1:12:40] had the faith in The God Who had made
[1:12:42] him the word and so and so now that is
[1:12:45] what God is trying to do in us do you do
[1:12:47] you under you claim to be the bride
[1:12:51] you claim to be the wife of God
[1:12:54] you claim to be an attribute of the
[1:12:56] father
[1:12:57] he claimed to have been a part of him
[1:12:58] from the beginning
[1:13:00] you claim that God has taken and has
[1:13:02] placed his seed in you at the time of
[1:13:04] your birth
[1:13:05] and that seed is what God has watched
[1:13:07] over all the way through your life
[1:13:09] bring it to the place where it is now
[1:13:12] but that seed has to come into
[1:13:13] manifestation the seed has to come to
[1:13:15] full expression
[1:13:16] but it can only do that as the
[1:13:19] when a seed in order for it to germinate
[1:13:22] the shell around it has to die
[1:13:24] for the life inside can be manifested
[1:13:27] well the shell has to die die to itself
[1:13:30] so the life that is inside can come into
[1:13:33] full manifestation come into full
[1:13:35] expression
[1:13:36] okay brother Branham in one place that
[1:13:38] says you have to have to will to do the
[1:13:40] will of God
[1:13:42] amen you have to make a conscious effort
[1:13:44] that you are going to do as God directs
[1:13:46] you to do in your life and so whenever
[1:13:48] God comes and he directs you to do
[1:13:50] something you have to be willing to
[1:13:51] submit to that directive
[1:13:57] brother Branham goes on he says talking
[1:13:59] about God coming in manifestation to us
[1:14:01] he said this is the true revelation of
[1:14:03] God this was his purpose this purpose
[1:14:05] took the form through election
[1:14:08] which means God chose
[1:14:12] that is why he could look right down in
[1:14:14] the last stage when he would all he
[1:14:16] could see all over himself still in the
[1:14:17] midst of the church as the author of
[1:14:19] this new creation of God his Sovereign
[1:14:22] power brought it to pass by his own
[1:14:24] decree he elected the memories of this
[1:14:27] new creation he predestinated them to
[1:14:29] the adoption of children according to
[1:14:31] the good pleasure of his will and by his
[1:14:33] omniscience and his omnipotence he
[1:14:35] brought it to pass
[1:14:38] it's not about you
[1:14:41] it's not about what you do
[1:14:44] it's about you learning to yield to the
[1:14:47] god that is in you
[1:14:49] it's about you committing your lives to
[1:14:51] Jesus Christ it's about Jesus Christ
[1:14:53] becoming the very Central focus of your
[1:14:55] life
[1:14:56] where everything else and everything
[1:14:58] else in life is secondary to Jesus
[1:15:00] Christ
[1:15:03] this is where the bride has to come
[1:15:09] brother random in in the rising of the
[1:15:12] son he says in the bride coming of
[1:15:14] Christ coming out of the do not out of
[1:15:16] the church there'll be there'll have to
[1:15:18] be a Sheaf waved over again in the last
[1:15:19] days waving of the Sheaf what was
[1:15:22] deceive the first one that come to
[1:15:23] maturity the first one that proved it
[1:15:25] was wheat that proved it was it was a
[1:15:27] sheep Hallelujah I'm sure you see what
[1:15:29] I'm talking about it was waived over the
[1:15:31] people and the first time they will come
[1:15:33] forth for the bride age for a
[1:15:35] resurrection out of dark
[1:15:36] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:15:39] the full maturity of the word has been
[1:15:41] turned back again in his full power
[1:15:43] having been waived over the people
[1:15:46] because I live you live also speaking of
[1:15:48] speaking to his wife because I live you
[1:15:51] live also in what direction that was and
[1:15:53] what erection this is to be quickened
[1:15:55] from the dead to be made alive in Jesus
[1:15:57] Christ by God's quickening power
[1:15:59] amen why did God send the prophet
[1:16:03] so I could see what I am
[1:16:06] so I could see that what power lies in
[1:16:09] me
[1:16:10] and if I can yield to the spirit of God
[1:16:12] that is in me that same God that's in me
[1:16:15] can express himself through me the same
[1:16:16] way it did in the prophet
[1:16:19] and the same in you
[1:16:21] it's not about you and who you are and
[1:16:23] what you're what you're wanting to do
[1:16:24] you know we've attended a lot of
[1:16:26] graduations before it's a wrong time of
[1:16:28] year to speak this probably but you know
[1:16:31] all of the the ones that get into high
[1:16:33] school and they're going to graduate and
[1:16:34] they got all these plans made to go to
[1:16:35] college and become a great person this
[1:16:37] that or the other
[1:16:39] and then all of a sudden it's like my
[1:16:41] one of my uh nephews
[1:16:44] he was a football player
[1:16:46] and he was doing well in college
[1:16:49] until all of a sudden he was on a motor
[1:16:51] scooter and he got hit with a car
[1:16:54] and that laid him up for a year over a
[1:16:56] year
[1:16:58] he had to fight within himself to gain
[1:17:00] his strength back
[1:17:01] and then he was finally getting to the
[1:17:03] place that they wanted to actually put
[1:17:04] him back on the football field
[1:17:07] as soon as he did that all of a sudden
[1:17:08] in practice all of a sudden he twisted
[1:17:10] or pulled a muscle or something like
[1:17:12] that and that sent him right back to the
[1:17:13] hospital
[1:17:14] all of his plans where did they go
[1:17:17] nowhere
[1:17:19] my brother when he was going to retire
[1:17:21] he was going to still work in computers
[1:17:23] and and ham radio stuff
[1:17:25] and all of a sudden he had a heart
[1:17:26] attack
[1:17:29] um that heart attack changed his life
[1:17:32] all of a sudden he didn't have the
[1:17:34] stamina he couldn't he could not go and
[1:17:36] he could not continue to design and work
[1:17:38] on the problems that he had in designing
[1:17:40] different electronic stuff
[1:17:43] so then he got into the word
[1:17:45] he established a close relationship with
[1:17:47] God
[1:17:49] and now he preaches at Tucson Tabernacle
[1:17:51] at least every other week
[1:17:54] and now he I mean he preaches the
[1:17:55] message all of a sudden now he has a
[1:17:57] revelation of who God is he has a
[1:17:59] revelation of who he is he has a
[1:18:01] revelation and brother Branham was a
[1:18:02] prophet he had his Revelation what God
[1:18:04] was trying to tell us through that
[1:18:05] prophet and he's preaching this message
[1:18:08] if it hadn't been for the heart attack
[1:18:10] he would have still been working in
[1:18:11] computers
[1:18:12] but because of that now he's working in
[1:18:14] the ministry now he's working developing
[1:18:16] messages now he's trying to preach and
[1:18:18] encourage the people
[1:18:20] so that that heart attack it changed his
[1:18:22] whole life
[1:18:23] in fact one after he'd had the heart
[1:18:25] attack he didn't have any energy
[1:18:27] he would he would the church would have
[1:18:29] and they would he you know they he would
[1:18:31] sing the first song and he'd have to sit
[1:18:33] down and he didn't have any energy
[1:18:35] and that went on for I don't know a
[1:18:37] couple weeks months whatever it was
[1:18:39] and all of a sudden God spoke to his
[1:18:41] heart he says stand up and give me
[1:18:42] praise
[1:18:44] so he did
[1:18:46] he got up and he lifted his arms into
[1:18:48] God and he began to worship and praise
[1:18:49] God
[1:18:51] he saw the heart doctor about a week
[1:18:53] later and the doctor looked at him and
[1:18:54] says what's happened to you he says your
[1:18:56] heart's like a 20 year old
[1:19:01] but he had to be willing
[1:19:03] to obey the voice
[1:19:06] he had to be willing to submit himself
[1:19:08] to what God was telling him to do
[1:19:11] it changed his whole life
[1:19:13] well other things that goes on in my
[1:19:15] life it's changed my whole life the
[1:19:16] things that gone on in my wife's and our
[1:19:18] families and then things have changed
[1:19:19] theirs but here again is being willing
[1:19:22] to submit to the god that dwells in us
[1:19:24] because he knows what he wants done with
[1:19:26] us
[1:19:30] restoration of the bright tree
[1:19:33] see like he says like husband and wife
[1:19:35] is one person you and I are going to be
[1:19:36] one at that day that's this day yes
[1:19:41] you'll know that I am in the Father the
[1:19:43] fathers and made you I and you and you
[1:19:45] and me oh I love that and Satan gets so
[1:19:47] angry at that see the Oneness of God
[1:19:52] Oneness of God you know what he's
[1:19:54] placing us in
[1:19:56] he's making us part of the godhead
[1:19:59] he's making us so we are the expression
[1:20:01] of God himself
[1:20:03] he's elevating us to the place of where
[1:20:05] where we are in that realm of
[1:20:08] for lack of a better way we we become
[1:20:10] part of the deity
[1:20:12] this flesh no this flesh will never
[1:20:15] I cannot die for somebody else's sins I
[1:20:18] can that that that's different this that
[1:20:20] isn't what it's talking about here but
[1:20:22] it's talking about a one as a talking
[1:20:24] about a Unity with God it's talking
[1:20:26] about right where are we and God so
[1:20:28] become United together where we are
[1:20:30] literally one
[1:20:31] where I no longer do my will I do his
[1:20:33] will I no longer follow my thoughts I
[1:20:35] follow his thoughts I no longer follow
[1:20:37] my directors I follow his directives
[1:20:40] that's the unity that's the Oneness that
[1:20:43] he's talking about here
[1:20:45] but see once we fully yield ourselves to
[1:20:47] the spirit of God and in us it's no
[1:20:49] longer us but now it's God himself in us
[1:20:51] and God cannot be defeated
[1:20:54] so why do we are being defeated the
[1:20:57] weather balance is in one place he says
[1:20:58] when the bride realizes who what she is
[1:21:00] and what she stands for she'll do the
[1:21:02] Greater Works and Satan will be
[1:21:03] powerless before her
[1:21:05] okay so why are we why don't we have the
[1:21:08] power
[1:21:09] because we don't believe what we are
[1:21:12] we failed we failed to comprehend God
[1:21:15] sent the prophet to show me what I am to
[1:21:18] show me what I possess to show me the
[1:21:20] power that dwells inside of me
[1:21:22] when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:21:24] him for we'll see him as he is
[1:21:27] well okay I saw him I saw him in the
[1:21:29] prophet he that was the appearing to me
[1:21:31] of Jesus Christ I looked at brother
[1:21:33] Brown's life that's that's how God
[1:21:35] appeared into me and I look at that at
[1:21:37] that man I look at the image I look at
[1:21:39] how he lived his life I look at at how
[1:21:41] he dealt with other people
[1:21:44] I enjoy some of the older sermons
[1:21:46] because I as I go through those I glean
[1:21:48] this is how the Prophet this is what he
[1:21:50] whenever he went to the hotels he didn't
[1:21:52] want to get say in the you know five
[1:21:54] stars he went down to the where the
[1:21:56] common people
[1:21:57] when he was flying he didn't go business
[1:21:59] class no he went to the back of the
[1:22:01] plane with everybody else
[1:22:04] when he would he you know he could have
[1:22:05] driven Mercedes and mozzaratis in the
[1:22:08] whole nine yards would he drive he drove
[1:22:10] a Ford
[1:22:11] okay
[1:22:12] he did not want to be special he wanted
[1:22:15] to be like everybody else
[1:22:17] somebody was going to build him a house
[1:22:18] in a retirement community up in in
[1:22:20] Arizona in Tucson Arizona and brother
[1:22:22] Brown says I can't live there
[1:22:24] he says because they have somebody at
[1:22:25] the gate so somebody wants to come and
[1:22:27] see me I have to have called them I have
[1:22:29] to give them a written pass and
[1:22:30] permission for them to come and visit me
[1:22:32] he said I'm not going to live there
[1:22:34] I want to be open to the public I want
[1:22:36] them to be able to come freely to me I
[1:22:37] want them to be able to and he said why
[1:22:39] do I drive it Forward he says I'm if I
[1:22:40] was driving an air-conditioned Cadillac
[1:22:42] and all these the the people in the
[1:22:44] church what are they doing out there
[1:22:45] they're picking cotton
[1:22:49] and I'm driving in an air-conditioned
[1:22:50] Cadillac
[1:22:52] no no
[1:22:54] I want to be common I want to be like
[1:22:56] everybody else because I don't want to
[1:22:57] be different
[1:23:00] and because that was his attitude I mean
[1:23:03] shouldn't do that be kind of the way the
[1:23:04] rest of us are why do we why do we try
[1:23:06] to pretend to be something we're not
[1:23:09] anyway
[1:23:17] in John 17 neither pray I for these
[1:23:19] alone but for them also which Shall
[1:23:21] Believe in Me through their word that
[1:23:22] they me that they all may be one as thou
[1:23:24] father are in me and I in thee that they
[1:23:26] also may be one in US
[1:23:29] and brother Brown goes on who do you say
[1:23:31] this is he says he said be one as I and
[1:23:34] the father one yeah be that kind of one
[1:23:36] then how will that be he said the word
[1:23:39] in us would be the anointed word
[1:23:42] that is the Oneness of God say the
[1:23:44] Oneness of God is the word anointed in
[1:23:47] you and then you become a sonary messiah
[1:23:50] of the age
[1:23:52] so if you take the message and you begin
[1:23:54] to feed on the message and you take that
[1:23:56] word and you store within your bit
[1:23:57] within your heart
[1:23:59] then when God has need of it it's there
[1:24:02] I know when that time my brother was in
[1:24:05] the Air Force and
[1:24:06] I fell down my heart to go and visit him
[1:24:09] and uh
[1:24:11] anyway I managed to read through the
[1:24:13] knit through the Old Testament up to the
[1:24:15] Psalms I think once and I read through
[1:24:16] the New Testament twice then I got an
[1:24:19] airplane I flew over to see my brother
[1:24:20] in in England
[1:24:22] and he had joined the Mormon church
[1:24:25] and so my brother says are you you're
[1:24:28] interested in learning about the Mormon
[1:24:29] church I said well curious yeah so they
[1:24:32] brought these two young elders
[1:24:34] early 20s
[1:24:36] elders
[1:24:38] and uh they they had their flip chart
[1:24:40] you know
[1:24:42] and they would bring up something and
[1:24:44] all of a sudden the word everything I
[1:24:46] had read in that last few months
[1:24:49] but doesn't the word also say this
[1:24:52] well yeah but uh and what about this
[1:24:55] scripture what about what Jesus said
[1:24:57] here what about
[1:24:58] well let's go on to the next point
[1:25:01] and after an hour I think an hour and a
[1:25:03] half and they'd only gone part of the
[1:25:05] way through their present day he says
[1:25:06] you need to go talk to somebody in San
[1:25:08] Francisco he can answer all your
[1:25:09] questions
[1:25:11] but that was an eye-opener to my brother
[1:25:14] well they are not they are not staying
[1:25:17] with the word
[1:25:19] and so my brother left that
[1:25:21] that was the whole reason why I went
[1:25:24] to take my brother to get him out of
[1:25:26] Mormonism and get him back into the word
[1:25:28] but I didn't know I was going to do that
[1:25:31] I just you know
[1:25:33] I I was I'd received the Holy Spirit
[1:25:36] earlier and I was anxious to read my
[1:25:38] Bible and get into the word and study
[1:25:40] and you know
[1:25:41] so I put enough up there where it you
[1:25:44] know God could find it
[1:25:48] brother Branham says see she was not
[1:25:51] talking about Mary she was not the seed
[1:25:54] Mary was not just the shuck the tassel
[1:25:56] and the star carriers of parts of the
[1:25:58] word not not all of the word
[1:26:01] and he goes on further down he says and
[1:26:03] he says but then come Pentecost the
[1:26:05] restoration of the gift of speaking in
[1:26:06] tongues they call it the initial
[1:26:08] evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in
[1:26:10] tongues there and they call that the
[1:26:11] initial the initial evidence which which
[1:26:13] they brought forth he said what was that
[1:26:16] he said that was to suck but they
[1:26:18] denominated
[1:26:19] but when you come to say I and my father
[1:26:21] are one
[1:26:25] and these other things then the shuck
[1:26:27] pulls away from it
[1:26:29] but the real January bride church will
[1:26:33] bring forth the entire word of God in
[1:26:36] its fullness and in its strength for
[1:26:39] he's the same yesterday today
[1:26:42] and forever
[1:26:45] so have you come to the place you can
[1:26:47] say I and my father are one
[1:26:50] have you come to the place in your
[1:26:52] relationship with God where all of a
[1:26:53] sudden you can say I have so I have I
[1:26:56] have I have so become Oneness with my
[1:26:58] father
[1:26:59] it's no longer I who live and now it's
[1:27:01] God himself living his life through me
[1:27:04] and I'm under the full obedience I'm
[1:27:06] under full subjection to my father and I
[1:27:08] go and I do as my father directs us as
[1:27:10] as God did in the body we call Jesus
[1:27:13] Christ
[1:27:14] that's the Oneness that's talking about
[1:27:16] I and my father are one but see this is
[1:27:19] where we're coming
[1:27:21] this is the Prophet this is why he's
[1:27:23] taught this is I mean this is the third
[1:27:24] poll this is us because this is
[1:27:26] literally becoming him
[1:27:29] and that's what we are predestined to
[1:27:31] become
[1:27:43] I I didn't I made a study on habakkuk
[1:27:45] about three four years ago
[1:27:48] and that changed my whole approach to My
[1:27:50] Life as a Christian
[1:27:52] habakkuk lived during the time when God
[1:27:54] was going to bring judgment upon his
[1:27:56] Nation
[1:27:57] and hybrid cook was afraid
[1:28:00] because he says when the Chaldeans come
[1:28:02] in he says what are they going to do
[1:28:04] based on men women children they don't
[1:28:06] care
[1:28:07] and habakkuk was living in that City
[1:28:11] would he survived what was coming
[1:28:14] he had no guarantee
[1:28:16] the Bibles in in habakkuk where it talks
[1:28:19] about you know the just shall live by
[1:28:20] faith it also talks about there and I'll
[1:28:22] have to paraphrase he says the man who
[1:28:24] the man who has confidence in himself
[1:28:26] God says fine I'll take my hands off let
[1:28:29] him do it
[1:28:31] but he says if you will put your faith
[1:28:33] in me
[1:28:34] I will take care of you
[1:28:38] and so I after I read that and have a
[1:28:41] good he got to the end and if you read
[1:28:42] it's only four chapters he goes to the
[1:28:44] end he says though there'll be nothing
[1:28:45] in the cell there will be there'll be
[1:28:47] total devastation yet I will worship my
[1:28:49] God as if I possessed everything
[1:28:52] what he had did not determine how he
[1:28:55] worshiped what he had or had not done
[1:28:58] not determined his relationship with God
[1:29:01] and so Isis will Lord take hold of my
[1:29:04] hand
[1:29:05] and from this point on you lead Wherever
[1:29:08] You Lead I'll follow and I've tried to
[1:29:11] be obedient to that
[1:29:13] because I don't know what tomorrow's
[1:29:15] going to bring
[1:29:16] I don't know what our government's going
[1:29:18] to do to us
[1:29:19] I don't even want to think about what
[1:29:21] they're going to do to us
[1:29:23] but all I know is I did my God has
[1:29:25] already been
[1:29:27] yes tomorrow
[1:29:29] he knows what my life will be like
[1:29:31] tomorrow he's already been there
[1:29:34] so if he has my hand and he's leading
[1:29:36] and guiding me through tomorrow he
[1:29:37] already knows what's coming and all they
[1:29:39] have to do is be obedient to follow
[1:29:42] and that is that's my concept
[1:29:44] am I perfect no do I make mistakes oh
[1:29:47] yeah
[1:29:48] do I have my faults and failures I got
[1:29:50] plenty
[1:29:52] but I'm not relying on me
[1:29:55] I'm relying on Calvary
[1:29:57] I'm relying upon what Jesus Christ did
[1:30:00] for me on that cross
[1:30:02] I am righteous because he said I am
[1:30:05] I am Holy because he said that I am I am
[1:30:09] saved because he said that I'm saved I
[1:30:12] am bride because he said I was bride
[1:30:17] that's the only thing I can rely on is
[1:30:19] what he told me I am
[1:30:21] en and I'm sorry and I'm willing to
[1:30:23] accept that
[1:30:26] and he swore by himself brother Manor
[1:30:28] makes this makes a statement
[1:30:30] he listen I'm going to say something
[1:30:32] look faith is unconscious
[1:30:34] amen you believe it I've learned that in
[1:30:37] the years of travel around the world and
[1:30:39] meeting the people of all different
[1:30:41] walks but faith is unconscious you got
[1:30:44] faith and you don't even know it that's
[1:30:46] right Jesus Christ no matter if he was
[1:30:48] in a storm and the Gale knocking the
[1:30:51] boats about from side to side or the
[1:30:53] other or he was standing in the face of
[1:30:55] a mess of demons if he was hanging
[1:30:57] anywhere it never moved him
[1:30:59] he he walked right along just as calm
[1:31:02] and quiet as he could be why he was
[1:31:05] simply unconscious of fear of anything
[1:31:07] around him that's right whether it was
[1:31:09] going to happen or whether it wasn't
[1:31:11] going to happen he knewed it was going
[1:31:12] to happen because God had said so
[1:31:15] and he said you're here to fulfill this
[1:31:17] too just walk unconscious of fear walk
[1:31:20] unconscious of criticism walk
[1:31:22] unconscious of the world walk as you
[1:31:24] walk in Christ walk with him not paying
[1:31:26] any attention to the right hand to the
[1:31:28] left just keep moving on he said you'll
[1:31:31] have your ups and your Downs he says
[1:31:32] don't worry
[1:31:33] you got to go through those Briar
[1:31:35] patches over sharp rocks and over Bluffs
[1:31:37] and down the hillsides and up through
[1:31:38] the mountains over Waters but walk with
[1:31:40] God yes sir there's so many Hills to
[1:31:42] climb upward you heard that old song
[1:31:45] you're going to have troubles
[1:31:47] we're all going to have troubles
[1:31:50] but who are we trusting
[1:31:53] if you're trusting yourself good luck
[1:31:56] if you're trusting your bank account
[1:31:58] good luck
[1:31:59] you're trusting your 401k good luck
[1:32:03] if you're trusting the government to
[1:32:06] help you out
[1:32:07] good luck
[1:32:11] but if you're trusting in God
[1:32:14] he promised
[1:32:17] and if you can believe in him
[1:32:20] it is like to me Faith is not believing
[1:32:22] for something it's believing in someone
[1:32:26] I believe God's more than able
[1:32:28] I believe God will I believe he will
[1:32:31] honor his word I believe he will supply
[1:32:32] my needs I believe he will heal me when
[1:32:35] I ask him to heal me I believe that he
[1:32:37] will do all the things that this word
[1:32:39] has promised that he will do and why do
[1:32:40] I believe that because God sent a
[1:32:42] prophet into me in this generation and
[1:32:45] that Prophet showed me what Jesus Christ
[1:32:46] was
[1:32:48] and to have that Jesus Christ now wants
[1:32:51] to live his life through me
[1:32:53] it's not about me it's about him it's
[1:32:55] not about what I do it's about what he
[1:32:57] does it's not about all my faults and
[1:32:59] failures and all my my Hang-Ups no it's
[1:33:02] all about him and the more I can die
[1:33:03] unto myself and the more I can yield
[1:33:05] myself to him
[1:33:09] the more the more that I can be
[1:33:10] victorious in my Christian Life

[1:36:20] there's a statement that brother Noel
[1:36:21] made early on that really impacted me he
[1:36:24] said God is a spirit
[1:36:26] in order for him to be expressed he has
[1:36:28] to have a body
[1:36:30] well I believe by faith he's called me
[1:36:32] to be part of that body I believe that
[1:36:35] he wants this body
[1:36:36] [Music]
[1:36:37] but God is also a gentleman
[1:36:41] you know my brother Venom told us the
[1:36:43] Holy Ghost is a gentleman he doesn't
[1:36:44] Force
[1:36:45] so what he needs is a yielded vessel a
[1:36:48] yielded body and I want to be yielded I
[1:36:52] said God help me to yield more God help
[1:36:55] me to surrender more God help me to
[1:36:57] forget my own ways my own Ambitions my
[1:36:59] own ideas and help me to take your way
[1:37:01] above everything else
[1:37:03] amen
[1:37:06] we must truly Die daily
[1:37:09] amen and that's becoming more of a theme
[1:37:12] in my life to Die daily and I didn't
[1:37:15] realize you know Brother Kyle made that
[1:37:17] statement I think he was quoting and I
[1:37:19] believe it was Dwight Moody but he may
[1:37:21] be wrong when he said the problem with
[1:37:23] the Living Sacrifice is it keeps
[1:37:24] crawling off the altar
[1:37:27] remember when he said that
[1:37:29] oh if that isn't the truth the problem
[1:37:31] with the Living Sacrifice is it keeps
[1:37:33] crawling off the Altar and I say God I
[1:37:35] don't want to keep crawling off the
[1:37:37] altar but I want to stay here yielded
[1:37:39] completely to you you know what I
[1:37:43] believe
[1:37:44] that the things our brother Noel
[1:37:45] preached is the the word for this day
[1:37:48] and I believe it's the thing that God
[1:37:50] wants to accomplish in this hour he
[1:37:52] wants to manifest himself
[1:37:54] in the formation of the Bride in Bride
[1:37:57] form he wants to manifest his life
[1:38:00] through her till she will so reflect him
[1:38:03] she will be him
[1:38:05] if that's what he calls for then this
[1:38:07] hour then it's possible it's here it's
[1:38:10] his desire and I want to be one of those
[1:38:12] yielded vessels that he can use
[1:38:15] amen
[1:38:16] thank God
[1:38:18] I thank God for the word I thank God for
[1:38:21] what he's doing in my heart and giving
[1:38:22] me that desire and when I hear the word
[1:38:24] preached like this I say that's what I
[1:38:26] want that's really what I want
[1:38:28] I may have failed in it today I made
[1:38:30] fail yesterday I may fail in it tomorrow
[1:38:31] but that's actually what I want
[1:38:34] it's the way I want to be and that's God
[1:38:37] drawing that life from us praise God
[1:38:41] amen God bless you it's good to be here
[1:38:43] remember to keep brother Noel in prayer
[1:38:46] and then they'll be heading to the camp
[1:38:48] here next week so pray for the camp as
[1:38:51] well

[1:39:00] you and God bless you God's attributes

[1:39:07] last day we have caught the Revelation
[1:39:10] by the last prophet's message
[1:39:27] I don't see
[1:39:29] the original

[1:41:59] not going to preach again
[1:42:02] in Hebrews the fourth chapter it makes a
[1:42:04] statement
[1:42:05] let us therefore fear
[1:42:08] as the promise of being left us of
[1:42:10] entering into his rest any of you should
[1:42:13] seem to come short of it
[1:42:15] For unto us was the Gospel preached as
[1:42:18] well as unto them
[1:42:19] but the word preached did not profit
[1:42:21] them
[1:42:22] not being mixed with faith
[1:42:25] and then that heard it
[1:42:27] God sent us a prophet
[1:42:29] to increase our faith to get us back to
[1:42:32] the faith of the fathers
[1:42:36] let us fear lest the promise being left
[1:42:38] us
[1:42:39] we reject it God bless you
[1:42:44] for a long time I travel
[1:42:51] down along Lonely
[1:42:53] Road
