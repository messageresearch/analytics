[15:39] you we commit this time into your hands
[15:41] in jesus' name
[15:44] amen God bless you I'll let you have
[15:46] your seats for just a
[15:48] moment I have to get used to the new
[15:50] Acoustics up here it's a little
[15:52] different so brother Emanuel brother gab
[15:55] you already experienced it so I got to
[15:57] get used to it so
[15:59] well God bless you it's good to see you
[16:01] all tonight and uh so I'm good glad you
[16:04] made it back home brother Gabe airplane
[16:07] didn't go down you made it home safely
[16:09] so it's it's good to see you and so had
[16:12] a lot of people traveling and I'm sure
[16:14] everybody was blessed up in Oregon
[16:16] brother brother Ben was up in
[16:19] Michigan and um I'll be honest with you
[16:22] tonight I I got a lot of text today and
[16:25] I really appreciated the text messages I
[16:27] I kind of needed them and because I
[16:29] really didn't want to preach tonight and
[16:31] uh just being honest and sincere um some
[16:35] of you knew that my uh my cousin we had
[16:38] a little tragedy in our family my
[16:40] 16-year-old cousin he's the youngest of
[16:42] the cousins I'm the oldest um last
[16:46] Monday night he went to bed said good
[16:48] night to the family his mom and dad
[16:50] perfectly healthy uh 16-year-old boy
[16:53] went to bed and never woke
[16:55] up and uh uh they did autopsy and
[17:00] there's absolutely nothing wrong they
[17:02] said he's perfectly healthy we don't
[17:05] know and uh so it was a complete shock
[17:08] to my little family my little unit my
[17:11] aunts and my uncles and my cousins and
[17:14] then um we had the showing all day on
[17:17] Sunday that's why I couldn't be here
[17:18] brother Emanuel and and uh so the
[17:21] showing was from 11:00 a.m. till 8:00 at
[17:24] night and the line kept coming through
[17:26] with people um they were from bluon and
[17:30] small little community and they were
[17:31] greatly loved in their little community
[17:34] and so it was quite a turnout of support
[17:36] to try to comfort the mom and the dad
[17:38] and I don't know in this life if I I I
[17:42] don't think there's too many things
[17:44] probably more painful than to see a son
[17:47] or a daughter in a
[17:49] casket um if there is I don't know of it
[17:51] and I don't want to know of it
[17:53] personally I don't want to ever
[17:54] experience something like that and um it
[17:58] was really tough um not because I was so
[18:01] close to El Elijah there was a gap
[18:04] between us and the age but I I mean to
[18:07] see someone's heartbreaking like that it
[18:09] does something to you you know and um I
[18:13] have a feeling for people and anytime I
[18:15] see somebody hurting it just I hurt I it
[18:18] breaks my heart and so it was a very
[18:21] difficult week and it was a difficult
[18:23] Sunday and the funeral was Monday and it
[18:26] was just difficult and I was emotionally
[18:29] just flatlined and I was thinking oh man
[18:32] I got to call somebody but everybody's
[18:35] ministering everybody ministered on
[18:37] Sunday and they're probably tired and
[18:38] they're worn
[18:39] out and so I thought well I'll just go
[18:43] and I'll just share whatever's on my
[18:44] heart and then um and you know how when
[18:48] you go through certain things in life it
[18:50] kind of changes your perspective on
[18:52] things sometimes we get a little out of
[18:54] balance I think that's safe to say um we
[18:58] can get get a little bit too focused uh
[19:00] view we get a little bit too narrowed
[19:02] view of our life and our surrounding and
[19:05] those who have contact with and those
[19:06] who we have an influence with and my
[19:09] great takeaway from even this last
[19:11] weekend is um I I'm I'm definitely going
[19:15] to make sure that I have an involvement
[19:17] in my extended
[19:18] family and that extended family is the
[19:21] family that God chose for me to be a
[19:23] part of and I love my church family but
[19:25] there's a reason why I'm a part of that
[19:27] extended family yeah and I was thinking
[19:29] about Jesus you know when he came he
[19:31] came into his own and his own received
[19:33] him
[19:34] not I didn't stop
[19:37] him just CU he was rejected just because
[19:40] he was despised just because he was
[19:42] challenged in the things that he was
[19:43] saying it didn't stop him interceding on
[19:45] their
[19:47] behalf and I think we should never stop
[19:50] ever in our pursuit to be a light to our
[19:53] families I think the scripture said the
[19:55] sick need a physician not the whole
[19:59] and um my wife and I both kind of
[20:02] settled within ourselves that if our
[20:05] light's going to shine it's going to
[20:06] shine brightest in the darkest of
[20:08] spots and so I'm going to continually
[20:12] make an effort to be an influence
[20:14] forever I can be and I um I had shared
[20:19] it was interesting You Youth know I had
[20:21] shared a the last youth meeting uh I'm
[20:24] on part six of adoption and uh I my
[20:28] title was the purpose of
[20:30] pain and I had told my wife after the
[20:34] service that night I says something's
[20:36] wrong I says that wasn't for
[20:39] them that wasn't for them something
[20:42] wasn't right and I you know I any
[20:45] Minister you want to minister in such a
[20:46] way that the people get something
[20:48] they're helped that's the only objective
[20:49] in Ministry is to minister to people and
[20:52] at that night I was sitting there and I
[20:54] was bothered I'm like man maybe maybe
[20:57] they're too young maybe they haven't
[20:59] experienced enough pain yet to
[21:01] understand maybe what I was saying
[21:04] and and then I just you know I just been
[21:06] thinking about that for days and days
[21:09] and then then this situation happens
[21:11] this tragedy hits our home or our family
[21:15] and like wow the purpose of
[21:19] pain and uh we were there on the funeral
[21:23] on
[21:25] Monday and everybody is heartbroken like
[21:27] no nobody can speak Carrie was there
[21:30] with me and everybody was just sitting
[21:32] down there and child's and son is just
[21:34] just the family Aunts Uncles and cousin
[21:36] that's it nobody else there and it was
[21:39] just silence everybody's just weeping
[21:43] tears and just heartbroken you know and
[21:47] then my aunt says if anybody would want
[21:49] to say something you're more than happy
[21:51] to say something
[21:54] now and obviously I'm sitting there and
[21:56] I'm like oh man ah
[21:58] the purpose of
[22:00] pain and I didn't say nothing I I I was
[22:03] like I'm not going to say anything I'm
[22:04] just going to sit here and one my uncle
[22:07] would speak and then my cousin would say
[22:09] something and another cousin say a
[22:12] couple things
[22:13] and and it was still just so sad and I
[22:17] was sitting there just breaking in my
[22:19] heart just just heartbroken you know
[22:21] just seeing everybody in such a
[22:22] heartbroken condition it it breaks you
[22:25] down and then finally I just said I hope
[22:28] purp is okay but I just would like to
[22:29] share with you a thought that I shared
[22:31] with our youth on the purpose of pain
[22:35] and I says I don't believe in times of
[22:38] great pain there's a choice I says pain
[22:41] can either point you to the Lord and
[22:44] draw you closer to him or it can drive
[22:46] you farther away um but I don't believe
[22:49] that's ever the purpose to drive you
[22:51] away I believe it's always there
[22:53] intending to pull you closer into his
[22:55] presence and I said I know two things
[22:57] things about
[22:59] pain every human I know tries to avoid
[23:03] it and every human I know will never be
[23:06] able
[23:07] to we will all at some point in this
[23:10] life if the Lord terries and we live
[23:12] long enough we will come in contact with
[23:15] times of great great
[23:17] pain almost at times it feels like
[23:20] unbearable
[23:22] pain and it's never there I believe that
[23:26] God always has a purpose in it and
[23:30] there's things that come into view when
[23:32] you're in times of great pain and I told
[23:35] him I said my scripture that I was
[23:37] inspired by was Hebrews 12 looking unto
[23:40] Jesus the author and the finisher of our
[23:42] faith who for the joy that was just
[23:44] before him endured the cross despising
[23:48] the shame and has sat down at the right
[23:50] hand of the Throne of God and I said he
[23:52] knew the joy that was right before him
[23:55] but this was one time in history where
[23:57] this one didn't bypass the pain this was
[24:00] one time in history where he embraced
[24:02] the pain cuz he knew that he was
[24:04] embracing that cross not for himself but
[24:06] for
[24:07] others and I says at this time I think
[24:11] this is a great opportunity for us to
[24:13] just look to him CU he's the only one
[24:15] that can really bring you comfort I
[24:18] can't comfort you the uncles the cousins
[24:20] nobody knows what to say nobody can
[24:23] bring a comfort at a time like that only
[24:25] Christ can bring Comfort at those times
[24:28] he's the only one that can do it and
[24:31] so
[24:32] it's then I began to realize I says you
[24:35] know what God gave me that inspiration
[24:37] he let me study it out for the Youth but
[24:40] that was for them that was for my family
[24:44] and then that began to think my I
[24:47] thought inspiration would come so I
[24:48] could minister to
[24:50] you I had inspiration came so I could
[24:53] minister to my extended family and it
[24:55] just hit me I'm like wow
[24:58] I need to broaden my perspective a
[25:00] little
[25:01] bit and I believe we're Witnesses we're
[25:03] lights in this
[25:05] world and I think that like um I was
[25:09] thinking you know the
[25:10] sun and the word of God came and it was
[25:13] a light and it drove back the darkness
[25:14] and you're thinking that Son of God the
[25:16] fullness of the godhead bodily when he
[25:18] came manifest on the earth there was a
[25:20] little orbit of people that were around
[25:22] his life at that time that he was having
[25:24] an influence on and we not the fullness
[25:26] of the godhead L but if you have an
[25:28] ounce of God one little inkling of God
[25:31] you're the light to somebody in this
[25:33] world that you're coming in contact with
[25:35] there's little Earths and there's Little
[25:38] Moons going around your sunlight and
[25:40] you're having an effect on them and I I
[25:43] believe it's all part of a purpose and
[25:45] God had a purpose in the family I have
[25:48] he has a purpose in the family you have
[25:51] he has a purpose in the place he's got
[25:53] you living in the place that he's got
[25:55] you working he's got a role for you to
[25:59] play and I think it's good to be mindful
[26:02] of that at all times
[26:04] and so I hope it's okay and then as I
[26:06] began to meditate on it I I had a
[26:09] certain direction that I thought I would
[26:10] Minister and then um I had went
[26:14] ministered a month ago to the youth on
[26:17] another picture that I saw in adoption
[26:19] and adoption for me has been interesting
[26:22] it's like a putting a jigsaw puzzle
[26:24] together it's like I can't see the next
[26:27] piece until the picture develops just a
[26:29] little bit more you ever do that you
[26:31] look into doing a jug jigsaw puzzle and
[26:33] you see one piece you're like where's
[26:35] that thing go and then just in a couple
[26:37] moments you'll put two other pieces
[26:39] together and you're like that's where
[26:40] that goes didn't realize it and that's
[26:44] what I've noticed here in adoption
[26:45] there's certain things that I I couldn't
[26:47] place until the picture developed for me
[26:49] just a little bit
[26:51] more and so I hope it's okay tonight I'd
[26:53] like to take these last two thoughts
[26:55] that I ministered to the youth because
[26:57] now I see how they actually connect
[26:58] together and I'd like to minister that
[27:01] to you if that's okay I can't minister
[27:04] to you but the word god Christ can
[27:07] minister to you and my whole heart's
[27:09] desire I've been praying I said Lord
[27:11] just give me something to strengthen the
[27:12] people just a little food that's all we
[27:14] need just a little food and so if you
[27:16] don't mind will we all stand with me
[27:20] tonight and we will uh oh brother gab
[27:23] will be so proud of me I did a
[27:24] PowerPoint brother I did a I knew he'd
[27:27] be proud of me I'm nervous as a wreck
[27:29] brother you know how difficult it is for
[27:31] me to stay on task with running this one
[27:33] and then this one and this one but I had
[27:36] a lot of quotes after I've been
[27:37] meditating on it last night and today
[27:39] and I thought Wednesday night or it's
[27:41] already getting dark at 5:00 it's very
[27:44] cold it's really warm in here I know how
[27:46] the eyes get a little tired I've been
[27:48] there done that so I thought maybe
[27:50] hearing my voice and seeing some quotes
[27:52] and seeing a PowerPoint might help a
[27:54] little bit tonight and trust that it
[27:56] will be so if you will please turn in
[27:59] your Bibles to Hebrews 12 for the Franco
[28:01] you can I have the PowerPoint you're
[28:03] more than welcome to look at
[28:18] that yeah all right say Amen if you're
[28:23] there or if you're looking up
[28:25] above scripture says wherefore seeing we
[28:28] are also compassed about with so great a
[28:31] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[28:34] every weight and every sin that does so
[28:36] easily beset us and let us run with
[28:39] patience the race that is set before us
[28:42] looking unto Jesus the author and the
[28:44] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[28:46] that was set before him endured the
[28:48] cross despising the shame and is sat
[28:51] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[28:53] God for consider him that endured such
[28:57] cont contradiction or opposition of
[28:59] Sinners against himself lest you be
[29:02] wearied and faint in your minds you have
[29:04] not resisted unto blood striving against
[29:07] sin and ye have and ye have forgotten
[29:10] the exhortation which speaketh unto you
[29:13] as unto children my son despise not thou
[29:16] the chastening of the Lord nor faint
[29:19] when thou art rebuked of him for whom
[29:21] the Lord loveth he chasteneth and he
[29:24] scourgeth every son whom he receive
[29:28] amen you may be
[29:31] seated so for a title tonight I'd like
[29:34] to take the witnesses of
[29:36] adoption and as a subtitle the purpose
[29:40] in the
[29:41] pain and I wanted to put this picture up
[29:45] because this is the picture of Mount
[29:48] Transfiguration where in brother bham
[29:49] said this was Jesus's
[29:51] adoption this is when a cloud came down
[29:54] Moses and Elijah was there beside him
[29:57] representing the law and the prophets
[29:59] the raptured and the
[30:01] resurrected and there was also three
[30:03] other witnesses there these were the
[30:05] Earthly Witnesses Peter James and John
[30:09] whom Christ took up there with him to
[30:11] witness this adoption where a cloud
[30:14] descended and a voice came out of the
[30:15] cloud this is my beloved Son hear ye him
[30:20] and also in this day and in this age
[30:23] we've also had a cloud come
[30:25] down and in this age brother brandham
[30:27] went up there and he said there was
[30:29] three of us there was me Fred sofman and
[30:31] Jee Norman because there had to be in
[30:34] the mouth of two or three Witnesses
[30:36] because God was getting ready to do
[30:38] something
[30:39] great and we look at these Witnesses and
[30:42] the thing that I want to bring into view
[30:43] is this is Jesus's adoption and in this
[30:47] adoption we have Peter James and John
[30:49] and we know that Peter James and John
[30:51] represent
[30:52] what faith hope and charity
[30:58] the witnesses of a mature Son of
[31:02] God not so much how well you can quote
[31:04] the Bible not how well you know the
[31:07] message but there's three things that'll
[31:09] be standing screaming a witness of your
[31:12] maturity in Christ and its Faith its
[31:15] hope and its
[31:17] charity those three are the Earthly
[31:20] Witnesses of an adopted
[31:22] son and i' like to take some time to
[31:25] look at that Through The Eyes of pain
[31:28] because every time you see these
[31:30] Witnesses come into view it's during a
[31:32] very difficult
[31:35] moment faith is usually expressed when
[31:38] you have need of it when you're
[31:42] sick hope you have to look beyond the
[31:45] circumstances and the reasoning of your
[31:47] own mind because everything around you
[31:49] looks
[31:50] hopeless but your hopes are in Christ
[31:53] and in the promises of his word that
[31:55] he'll fail not he always keeps keeps his
[31:58] promises and we all know that charity
[32:01] must be present for an adopted mature
[32:03] son without charity you're nothing
[32:07] you're a tinkling symbol and a sounding
[32:09] brass though you have knowledge of all
[32:10] the Mysteries and you have all Faith to
[32:12] move the mountains without a genuine
[32:14] charity that loves even your enemies
[32:17] you're
[32:18] nothing these are the witnesses of an
[32:20] adopted
[32:22] son and these must be present so I hope
[32:26] it's okay
[32:28] I wanted to look at the last portion
[32:30] because I've realized something with
[32:32] adoption as I've been meditating on it
[32:34] now for
[32:36] months adoption is
[32:41] painful when a baby is born we come up
[32:44] through justification sanctification and
[32:46] the baptism of the Holy Spirit you have
[32:48] water blood and spirit you have the
[32:49] ingredients for a
[32:51] birth do you ever spank a
[32:54] baby no do you ever correct a baby no it
[32:59] can do no wrong it can do whatever it
[33:02] wants however it wants as loud as it
[33:04] wants when it doesn't matter the baby's
[33:06] never corrected because it's under
[33:09] complete dependency of a mother and
[33:11] father to do everything for it it can do
[33:13] no wrong because it has someone doing
[33:15] everything for
[33:18] it but we know that there must come a
[33:21] chastening of a son as a son
[33:24] matures right and so as the son is
[33:27] maturing he's got to get ready for some
[33:30] chastisement that's part of the maturing
[33:34] process and what God deems is the right
[33:36] kind of Correction and pain needed
[33:39] that's on him we don't all have the same
[33:42] race set before us you have a certain
[33:44] course I have a certain course and I
[33:47] must run with patience the race that's
[33:49] before
[33:50] me but each of us are going to
[33:53] experience great pain amen as we come to
[33:56] great maturity yes there's just no other
[34:00] way faith can only be expressed through
[34:03] difficult situations charity can only be
[34:06] expressed when someone actually hates
[34:08] you you know these Witnesses can't stand
[34:13] and witness on your behalf unless
[34:16] there's a reason to do
[34:19] so and so in just backing up for a
[34:22] moment the Bible says in Galatians 4:4
[34:25] but when the fullness of time was come
[34:27] God sent forth his son made of a woman
[34:29] made under the law to redeem them that
[34:30] were under the law that we might receive
[34:33] the adoption of sons and because you are
[34:35] Sons God has sent forth the spirit of
[34:37] his son into your hearts crying ABA
[34:39] father wherefore Thou Art no more a
[34:41] servant but a son and if a son then an
[34:44] heir of God through
[34:47] Christ right now have we come to the
[34:49] fullness of
[34:51] time yes we have come to the fullness of
[34:54] time Revelations 10:1 and time was no
[34:57] more he put one foot upon the sea and
[34:59] one foot upon the the Earth right you
[35:02] had the image of the Beast and the and
[35:04] the the Beast himself and he put both
[35:06] feet upon both images and he stood there
[35:08] and he swore there's time no more the
[35:11] fullness of time has come and so in this
[35:14] fullness of time we know that there must
[35:17] come a complete maturity of the Bride
[35:19] because everything must wrap up and I
[35:22] believe that this age is an adoption age
[35:24] just as you had justification you had
[35:26] sanctification you have the baptism the
[35:29] Holy Spirit the fourth stage is an
[35:31] adopted mature son maturity is what
[35:35] we're talking
[35:36] about and just like a wheat that matures
[35:39] brother bam says modern events made
[35:41] clear by prophecy we're at the end of
[35:43] denomination the wheat's taken shape but
[35:46] what's the matter with the wheat now you
[35:48] can't you can't lay in the presence of
[35:51] the sun to ripen before the combine
[35:53] picks it
[35:55] up so we know that there must come a
[35:57] great time of heat a great time of uh
[36:01] discomfort for the little wheat to get
[36:04] completely ripened up so that it can be
[36:07] harvested and another interesting thing
[36:09] about how they used to harvest back in
[36:10] the days used to use a threshing floor
[36:13] you know what a threshing floor is they
[36:15] beat the tar out of it they beat it and
[36:19] beat it and beat it and it's all part of
[36:23] the
[36:24] process you can't actually get the wheat
[36:26] in proper condition until it goes
[36:28] through the threshing
[36:30] floor so in continuing on here brother
[36:33] bham says hear ye him here God was going
[36:37] to do something great because he was
[36:39] bringing forth Peter James and John now
[36:42] I'd like I'd call it hope faith and
[36:45] charity and these three great gifts of
[36:47] God say take Peter for Faith James for
[36:50] Hope and John always love which is
[36:52] charity and he takes faith hope and
[36:54] charity with him and he goes up into a
[36:56] mountain because because he's fixing to
[36:57] do something he's going to make an
[36:59] expression he wants it to be confirmed
[37:02] and he always confirms it with three
[37:04] Witnesses two or three
[37:06] witnesses that was an Old Testament
[37:08] statement that out of the mouth of two
[37:10] or three Witnesses let every word be
[37:12] established and he goes up to the
[37:13] mountain calling these three men three
[37:15] outstanding gifts of the people that was
[37:18] with him and brings them up to the
[37:20] mountain and then he has three Heavenly
[37:23] beings something must going to take take
[37:27] place he's got three Earthly Witnesses
[37:30] and three Heavenly Witnesses there's
[37:32] Moses Elijah and Jesus transfigured or
[37:36] transformed and there was Peter James
[37:39] and John the Earthly and the Heavenly
[37:42] all meeting together
[37:44] now amen and that's exactly what's been
[37:47] taking place in this day and it's
[37:50] exactly what's going to be present as
[37:52] Witnesses now um if you've ever bought a
[37:54] car or bought a house uh there's a
[37:57] witness you ever noticed that there's
[37:59] never a transfer of ownership from one
[38:02] hand to another unless there's Witnesses
[38:04] present right you get a notary public
[38:07] and he's he's identified by the the
[38:09] local governments as a true witness one
[38:12] that can be trusted to oversee this
[38:15] transfer of ownership from the hands of
[38:17] one to the hands of another and so if
[38:20] there's going to be Witnesses on the
[38:22] scene there must be going to be a great
[38:24] transfer here of responsibility and
[38:26] ownership from one's hand to another's
[38:28] hand and if I would like to recall to
[38:31] your mind take the book eat the book out
[38:34] of the hand of him that sth so there's
[38:37] going to be a great transfer of
[38:39] responsibility here as brother brandham
[38:42] said in Jesus's Mount Transfiguration
[38:44] when he said this was his adopted moment
[38:46] he said now father could sit down and
[38:48] rest his son would complete the work and
[38:51] so now we know that God is wanting to
[38:53] take a rest he's waiting for your
[38:55] witnesses to arrive on the scene to
[38:58] witness the transfer of ownership and to
[39:00] enforce redemption's
[39:02] rights and those Witnesses very simple
[39:06] faith hope and
[39:09] charity not how well you understand the
[39:11] Seven
[39:12] Seals a living epistle being read of all
[39:16] men a life lived a life
[39:20] expressed taking the book and eating the
[39:23] book and thundering out the mystery of
[39:25] Christ in your own life
[39:26] life that's the Thunder I think prophet
[39:29] of God said the voice of what a thousand
[39:32] lived
[39:33] lives
[39:35] red and so these Witnesses must be on
[39:37] the scene there's also another time that
[39:39] you bring Witnesses on a scene it's in a
[39:41] court case have
[39:43] judge if you're on a prosecution or
[39:46] defense both sides produce Witnesses
[39:50] both against and or for and we know when
[39:53] Jesus was condemned to death they
[39:55] brought forth false
[39:56] Witnesses because he death could not be
[39:59] pronounced unless there was
[40:01] Witnesses but we also know that in
[40:05] 1963 when that cloud came down it was
[40:09] the white wigged one the judge for the
[40:11] judge is here to enforce redemption's
[40:13] rights and if redemption's rights is
[40:16] changing hands from him that sth upon
[40:18] the throne to him that was told to take
[40:20] the book and eat the book and prophesy
[40:22] again there must be three Witnesses
[40:25] witnessing and enforcing life amen
[40:29] testim testifying that life is here as
[40:33] there was false witnesses to condemn him
[40:36] there is true Witnesses here to testify
[40:39] that life has come to you and to me and
[40:44] those Witnesses are faith hope and
[40:51] charity so I'll read this the Life
[40:53] Magazine packed the article of it the
[40:54] mystical circle of light goes up into
[40:57] the air above Tucson and Phoenix in the
[40:59] same way that I told you nearly a year
[41:01] before it happened now it would be and
[41:03] like a triangle the picture hangs in the
[41:05] church down there you that took that
[41:07] magazine has it there it was just
[41:10] exactly they said it's 27 M high and 30
[41:13] Mi across they don't understand yet what
[41:16] happened it appeared mysteriously and
[41:18] went away mysteriously Fred
[41:21] sofman brother Jean Norman and I
[41:24] standing there three is a witness
[41:27] look he took them up on top of a
[41:29] mountain Peter James and John to give
[41:32] witness they stood there and watched it
[41:34] when it happened they seen it
[41:39] done I know that I am not fully
[41:43] grasping this picture but I know there's
[41:46] something here I know something's
[41:48] developing for me I know there's
[41:51] something taking place and I know I'm
[41:53] not doing justice but yet I can feel it
[41:55] and yet I I can't seem to grab it for
[41:58] you and so I guess we just wait for the
[42:02] jigsaw puzzle to continue to
[42:06] develop it says when that which is in 1
[42:08] Corinthians says when that which is
[42:10] perfect is come then that which is in
[42:11] part shall be done away when I was a
[42:13] child I spake as a child and I
[42:15] understood as a child and I thought as a
[42:17] child but when I became a man I put away
[42:20] childish things for now we see through a
[42:23] glass Darkly but then face to face now I
[42:26] know in part but then I shall know even
[42:28] as I am known and now abideth faith hope
[42:33] and charity these three the greatest of
[42:37] these is Charity so we can see that as
[42:40] we are becoming
[42:42] mature we're moving from being a child
[42:45] to being an adult to being one that has
[42:48] the
[42:50] responsibility to bear his name and we
[42:54] have this transfer of ownership
[42:56] and we have a job to do we see these
[42:59] three Witnesses continuing to come into
[43:02] view and so the Bible or I'm sorry a
[43:07] Greek word for Te witness is to testify
[43:10] or to be a testimony before a
[43:13] judge and I think that's exactly what's
[43:16] happening and so I'd like to take a look
[43:18] at the first Earthly witness
[43:21] hope this is so simple and yet so
[43:24] profound to me
[43:27] um we know that for a a mature son he's
[43:31] got to have his hope in the right things
[43:34] just simply has to have his hope in the
[43:36] right
[43:36] things you're not in maturity if your
[43:39] hope only lies in what you can
[43:41] understand around you or happening to
[43:43] you your hope must go Way Beyond what
[43:46] you mentally can understand our hopes
[43:48] are built on nothing less than Jesus
[43:50] words of righteousness so this must be a
[43:53] constant testifying witness in your life
[43:56] testifying no matter what situation you
[43:58] find yourself in no matter what
[44:00] difficulty that you can't seem to figure
[44:02] your way out of it does not matter
[44:05] because your hopes lie in his promise it
[44:08] does not matter all things work together
[44:11] for the good to them that love God
[44:13] everything's going to work out for the
[44:15] good in the end I know it is see There's
[44:19] Hope Hope's a wonderful thing it's a
[44:22] good thing and we got to have hope
[44:26] I mean when you come in contact with the
[44:29] world they're
[44:33] hopeless I mean what kind of witness are
[44:36] you if you're
[44:38] hopeless miserable and sad and
[44:40] despondent and
[44:42] upset I'm sorry your witness isn't
[44:45] testifying very well of your
[44:49] maturity because the dark and dying
[44:52] world all around you they're looking for
[44:53] something real they don't want to or
[44:56] corrected that they're wrong they want
[44:58] life they need life they need something
[45:02] they can get a hold of that won't
[45:03] conform them into an image but it'll
[45:05] transform them from the inside out I
[45:09] still believe the gospel of Jesus Christ
[45:11] has the transforming power to make a
[45:13] sinner a saint we either believe that or
[45:16] we don't why are we coming here why do
[45:18] we believe this message if there's no
[45:19] power in it why do we do the things that
[45:21] we
[45:22] do if we're Believers we believe that
[45:25] what we are hand holding in our hands is
[45:27] the literal life of Jesus Christ
[45:29] available to
[45:30] somebody if we don't don't talk about it
[45:33] and don't claim to be a
[45:35] Christian is if a Christian has
[45:37] confidence that God keeps his
[45:39] word he has a hope that what God did for
[45:43] you you he'll do for somebody else he's
[45:47] got to have that hope it's a living
[45:49] witness that the world needs to see
[45:54] hope I find find it also interesting
[45:57] that brother
[45:59] brandham in this Natural Life lost his
[46:02] natural hope but he never lost his
[46:05] spiritual
[46:06] hope never lost his spiritual hope
[46:08] you'll get we'll see that here in a
[46:09] second now I wanted to pull this old
[46:11] Webster's Dictionary this is from n or
[46:13] 18 something 1850 his definition of Hope
[46:18] a desire of some good accompanied with
[46:20] the least the slight expectation of
[46:23] obtaining it or the belief that it is
[46:26] obtainable hope differs from a wish or a
[46:29] desire in that it implies some
[46:31] expectation of obtaining the good
[46:34] desired or the possibility of possessing
[46:37] it hope therefore always gives pleasure
[46:41] or
[46:42] Joy so in the midst of Sorrow when all
[46:45] seems
[46:46] hopeless no not us we have joy real hope
[46:51] says no that's mine that's obtainable
[46:53] that's for me that's for me me he's here
[46:57] for me greater is he that's in me than
[47:00] he that is in this
[47:02] world brother Brenham says
[47:05] this and your little boy at the point of
[47:08] death Billy Paul 18 months old and your
[47:10] little girl at 8 months old is lying
[47:13] here dying with
[47:15] menitis and you just prayed and God
[47:17] pulled a sheet down and said shut up
[47:21] don't hear won't hear you at all turned
[47:24] his back on you he's a good god huh he
[47:28] loves you and every girl you ever went
[47:31] with every boy you ever associated with
[47:34] your very best of friends has walked
[47:36] away from you and you're a religious
[47:38] fanatic everything he was telling me was
[47:41] the truth everything that he would say
[47:45] just fall right in line see here I just
[47:50] I was just then about to say then I if
[47:53] that's the way he has to act then I
[47:55] won't serve
[47:56] him just just as I said that there was
[48:00] something come from somewhere else way
[48:04] down on the inside said who are you to
[48:08] begin with the lord gave and the Lord
[48:10] takes away see that's that's that Inside
[48:14] Man and it don't reason at all no human
[48:18] capability to understanding this there's
[48:20] something way down deeper past mental
[48:23] faculties that can cry out and say
[48:25] though he slay me yet I'll serve him no
[48:29] matter what situation look at the
[48:31] difficulty he lost his wife he lost his
[48:33] child all his friends have forsaken him
[48:35] he's a religious fanatic he's a good god
[48:38] huh yeah he took everything from me and
[48:42] though he slayed me I'll still serve him
[48:45] what mental faculties could he lean upon
[48:47] at that moment nothing but something
[48:51] came down from the
[48:54] inside I looked back and I thought how
[48:57] did I get on Earth I come from a bunch
[49:00] of drunkards how' I get here who gave me
[49:03] life who gave me that wife who gave me
[49:05] that baby where did my wife come from
[49:09] where did my life come from I said
[49:12] though he slay me yet I will trust him I
[49:15] said get away from me Satan I laid my
[49:17] hand over on my baby I said Sharon honey
[49:20] I'll lay you now in your mother's arms
[49:21] in a few minutes the angels of God will
[49:23] come and take you away but one one day
[49:26] daddy will see you again his hopes are
[49:29] not based upon the situation even
[49:31] brother bam said like a black sheep God
[49:33] wouldn't even hear me but his Hope was
[49:35] even going beyond that though God had
[49:38] even turned his back on he saiding I'm
[49:40] My Hope Is Still honey I'm going to see
[49:41] you again his hope never spiled a
[49:45] witness was still
[49:49] testifying and though he slay me yet
[49:51] I'll serve him brings into view
[49:54] job now none of us have ever been in
[49:57] this kind of a position brother Benham
[49:58] said and I believe
[50:00] him I mean he's going on pretty good got
[50:03] a good reputation in the community he's
[50:06] well sought out everybody wants to hear
[50:08] from him and in a moment's notice his
[50:11] whole career his business everything he
[50:13] owns wiped out all his children the ones
[50:16] that he loves so much that he interceded
[50:19] for constantly or constantly on his mind
[50:20] he was interceding for them
[50:23] dead then his health goes
[50:25] and he's on a ash Heap scraping the
[50:28] boils from intense pain and then it's
[50:30] not over his closest of friends now come
[50:33] against him start to falsely accuse him
[50:36] saying you you you you done wrong you've
[50:38] done something wrong somewhere we don't
[50:40] believe you here he is being falsely
[50:43] accused by his own friends he did
[50:45] nothing
[50:46] wrong and then his wife comes the
[50:48] closest thing he has on this Earth his
[50:50] own wife he says Curse God and
[50:54] die he said says I won't do it I won't
[50:58] do it right and he wouldn't do
[51:00] it though these skin words eat up this
[51:04] body yet in this flesh I shall see God
[51:07] hope never failed but look at the amount
[51:10] of pressure look at the pain look at the
[51:13] difficulties that was coming upon this
[51:15] son to get him to lose
[51:18] hope
[51:20] yeah yes that's why I said there's a
[51:23] purpose in the pain
[51:26] and I also believe that for an adopted
[51:29] son it's
[51:31] painful there's just no other way these
[51:33] W Witnesses must testify on our
[51:39] behalf job testifies in
[51:42] 81315 he says where are the paths of all
[51:45] that forgot
[51:47] God and the Hypocrites hope sh and the
[51:50] Hypocrites hope Shall Perish whose hope
[51:54] shall be cut off and whose trust shall
[51:56] be a spider's web he shall lean upon his
[52:00] house but it shall not stand he shall
[52:03] hold it fast but it shall not
[52:06] endure there is nothing in this natural
[52:09] world that we can put our hope in
[52:11] there's just nothing it's crumbling it's
[52:14] a spider's web go lean up against a
[52:16] spider's web see if it'll hold
[52:19] you anything in this natural world is
[52:21] compared to you putting your Hope on a
[52:23] spider's
[52:24] web so we don't ever lose our trust in
[52:27] God we put our trust in the Lord that's
[52:31] the only place I can place my hopes we
[52:34] must
[52:35] amen blessed is the man that trusteth
[52:38] the Lord in whose hope in whose hope the
[52:41] Lord
[52:44] is Romans says and not only they but
[52:47] ourselves also which have the first
[52:49] fruits of the spirit even ourselves
[52:51] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[52:53] adoption to wit the Redemption of our
[52:56] body for we are saved by hope but hope
[53:00] that is seen is not hope for what a man
[53:03] seeth why do he yet hope for but if we
[53:06] hope for that which we see not then do
[53:09] we with patience wait for iten so we see
[53:13] now again adoption coming into view and
[53:15] we seeing Our Hope coming into view
[53:17] again can I call a second
[53:23] witness the second Earthly Witness is
[53:25] Faith we're very familiar with this The
[53:28] Heroes of Faith I like to go through it
[53:32] who through faith subdued kingdoms and I
[53:34] want you to see where does this faith
[53:36] when does this Faith witness when does
[53:38] this Faith testify what conditions do
[53:40] you
[53:41] see who through faith subdued kingdoms
[53:44] wrought righteousness and obtained Merc
[53:46] uh promises stopped the mouth of lions
[53:49] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[53:52] the edge of the sword and out of
[53:53] weakness remained strong waxed Valiant
[53:55] in fight turned to flight the armies of
[53:58] the aliens women received their dead
[54:01] raised to life again others were
[54:04] tortured not accepting Deliverance that
[54:07] they might obtain a better Resurrection
[54:09] others had a trial of coel mockings
[54:12] cruel mockings and scorings yay moreover
[54:15] of bonds and imprisonment they were
[54:17] stoned they were sought asunder they
[54:19] were tempted they were slain with the
[54:21] sword they wandered about in sheep skins
[54:23] and goat skins and death ol and
[54:25] Afflicted and tormented oh whom the
[54:27] world was not worthy they wandered in
[54:30] deserts and in mountains and in dens and
[54:32] in caves of the earth and all these have
[54:34] obtained a good report through
[54:37] faith received not the promise God
[54:41] having provided some better thing for us
[54:43] that what that they without us shall not
[54:47] be made
[54:52] perfect if you're expecting the
[54:54] Christian life to be without
[54:57] problems sorry it's
[55:00] not you will never remove the cross from
[55:03] Christianity you're never getting away
[55:05] from it take up your cross daily and
[55:09] follow me it is a difficult
[55:13] path it just is you can't expect this
[55:16] isn't a Joel ostein gospel guys it's not
[55:20] God is Not Just existing to be your
[55:21] Aaron boy and make life easy for you at
[55:23] all times
[55:25] I believe in fact he actually matures
[55:27] you to the point where you look at pain
[55:29] and difficulty right in its face and say
[55:31] that's the path that God needs me to
[55:32] take that's the path I take I've said it
[55:35] before if you can't find the cross that
[55:37] you're supposed to be picking up every
[55:38] day you are probably on the wrong path
[55:40] and you need to re-evaluate the life
[55:42] that you're now
[55:43] living if there's a cross daily that I
[55:46] must pick up and I can't find
[55:51] it something's wrong somewhere everybody
[55:55] yeah something's wrong
[55:57] somewhere I'll tell you what's difficult
[56:00] you know what's difficult getting around
[56:02] people that disagree with you
[56:05] vehemently I told you humans avoid pain
[56:08] at all costs they don't even like to
[56:11] associate with people that don't agree
[56:13] with them oh what great hope you're
[56:15] going to
[56:16] be how are you going to affect
[56:19] them what hope does the world have if
[56:23] you don't like to even in Cur a little
[56:25] bit of pain and discomfort of someone
[56:27] disagreeing with you maybe you need to
[56:30] be challenged a little bit maybe you
[56:33] need to someone to push against your
[56:34] experience a little bit maybe you need
[56:38] that I I I literally at times I mean at
[56:42] times I wonder I I was sharing this with
[56:43] a brother I says now think about this
[56:45] psalms 27 says I'm standing on a solid
[56:48] rock and if I'm on a rock a solid rock
[56:51] that can't be moved and I know that
[56:53] everybody else is on sinking sand if
[56:57] they come against me and they push
[56:59] against me if I am on a rock and Jesus
[57:03] Christ is a personal revelation to me as
[57:05] an individual and not just a lifestyle
[57:07] choice I choose to live by then when the
[57:10] pressure and difficulty comes my way I'm
[57:13] not
[57:14] moving you're not
[57:16] moving and if you're so afraid to come
[57:19] in contact with someone that doesn't
[57:20] exactly agree with everything that you
[57:22] stand for because you afraid
[57:25] something's wrong why are you
[57:29] afraid why are you
[57:32] nervous God that's why I don't believe
[57:34] in cutting yourself off from an extended
[57:36] family that doesn't agree with you I
[57:39] don't believe that for
[57:41] nothing I just
[57:44] don't I think salt must make contact for
[57:47] it to have an effects it just has to
[57:50] it's got to and if you're so unsure of
[57:52] your experience get alone with God I
[57:55] don't know what to tell you get alone
[57:56] with God search out your own experience
[57:59] wrestle it out with fear and trembling
[58:01] before God and get real with God and
[58:02] stop playing Church what's the
[58:06] point why why waste the time why
[58:11] come for me this is a reality and if
[58:13] this isn't a reality then we are all
[58:15] wasting our
[58:17] time we either have the goods or we
[58:19] don't have the goods we either have the
[58:20] Life of Christ or we don't have the Life
[58:21] of Christ we either have a solid rock
[58:23] Foundation we're standing on we don't
[58:24] have a Solid Rock Foundation we either
[58:26] have truth or we don't have truth we
[58:28] either have an experience with God or we
[58:30] don't have an experience with God these
[58:33] things got to be wrestled out and
[58:34] questions got to be asked if you can't
[58:35] come in contact with someone that even
[58:37] slightly disagrees with you without
[58:38] losing your
[58:42] mind you become so isolated and you
[58:44] become of no effect to
[58:52] nobody I'm never mad by the way I just
[58:54] get passion I just I'm not just
[58:59] passion continuing
[59:01] on faith have faith in God now it's it's
[59:05] not something that you just kindly push
[59:07] yourself oh okay not something you
[59:09] kindly push yourself to I've noticed so
[59:11] much that in my meetings that people try
[59:13] to work themselves up into something to
[59:15] make them believe now you can't do that
[59:17] you're just beating the air but faith is
[59:20] something that's just as calm and
[59:21] settled as can be it's taking God at his
[59:24] word and having the Assurance in your
[59:26] heart that God is able to keep what he
[59:30] has said that he would do and will
[59:32] perform everything that he said that he
[59:35] would do now I've noticed that and so
[59:37] many times people think that they must
[59:39] be prayed for and that's all right that
[59:41] we should pray for one another or that
[59:43] some hands may be or some evangelist
[59:44] hands or some but must be ministered
[59:48] that's all right that'll bring contacts
[59:50] and so forth of Faith but real
[59:52] unadulterated faith is taking God at his
[59:56] word real mature unadulterated faith God
[1:00:00] said it I believe it that's it that's
[1:00:06] it so it's a
[1:00:09] witness now I know some
[1:00:12] people said brother bam makes that quote
[1:00:15] th the enemy of faith is Hope remember
[1:00:17] hearing that enemy of faith is Hope
[1:00:20] let's look at this I like this he says
[1:00:23] and hope what a beautiful thing hope is
[1:00:25] oh little timid hope lovely and sweet as
[1:00:28] she is yet she's the greatest enemy
[1:00:30] faith has that's right the greatest
[1:00:33] enemy Faith's got is hope now hang with
[1:00:36] me you'll see what this means soon cause
[1:00:39] a person becomes so hopeful till they
[1:00:42] leave away from Faith they so are hoping
[1:00:45] that God does it but there's nothing
[1:00:46] inside of them that says God's going to
[1:00:48] do it hope looks out at something faith
[1:00:52] is standing in the thing that he's
[1:00:53] looking at he's inside of it believing
[1:00:56] and standing on
[1:00:57] it now now um yeah now hope will agree
[1:01:02] with the Bible hope will say it's true
[1:01:04] hope will say I believe every bit of it
[1:01:06] I believe that that's the word of God
[1:01:08] and I believe that God will keep his
[1:01:10] promises that's good you should say that
[1:01:11] you should believe that hope believes
[1:01:13] all of it but hope then says now I
[1:01:16] believe that God will heal but just look
[1:01:18] at my condition now Faith don't look at
[1:01:21] that faith comes around I don't care
[1:01:24] nothing about the conditions God said so
[1:01:27] and it's mine you see faith is Burly as
[1:01:30] I once said faith has hair on its chest
[1:01:33] when it stands up and pulls big muscles
[1:01:35] out everything else vanishes away it
[1:01:37] just takes its flight When Faith really
[1:01:39] takes a hold nothing else stands faith
[1:01:42] is a true witness and it's tough and
[1:01:47] rugged but it looks like hope got thrown
[1:01:50] out don't it don't worry let's see what
[1:01:52] brother bam says about this
[1:01:55] it says I'm telling you Faith but you've
[1:01:57] got to have hope and
[1:02:00] charity if you've got real Burly faith
[1:02:02] and no love with it you've ruined your
[1:02:06] influence before the
[1:02:08] people if you haven't got love mixed
[1:02:11] with it yep see you seen people real
[1:02:15] Burly what we would say excuse the
[1:02:18] expression Bulldog Faith to grab a hold
[1:02:22] but it's so rough with it then you see
[1:02:25] when you do that it it does it hasn't
[1:02:28] got the kindness here to move with it so
[1:02:32] what we need is hope faith and
[1:02:35] charity isn't that right hope faith and
[1:02:38] charity together God help our church to
[1:02:41] have it like that the people to have
[1:02:43] that
[1:02:45] combination a so don't throw out hope
[1:02:48] everybody Hope's not the enemy you need
[1:02:51] faith hope and charity it keeps it all
[1:02:53] in balance
[1:02:55] you have a bulldog rugged faith and mean
[1:02:57] as a rattlesnake with it with people you
[1:02:59] better believe the word of God you're
[1:03:01] going to perish if you
[1:03:02] don't well that was spoken in Real Love
[1:03:05] wasn't it you know sometimes you just
[1:03:07] got to sit down and have a relationship
[1:03:09] with somebody before you can tell them
[1:03:10] the truth how many have hold the old
[1:03:12] heard the old saying people do not care
[1:03:15] what you say until they first know you
[1:03:17] care and he say well I I told him
[1:03:20] straight he didn't receive it serpy you
[1:03:23] said it mean is a right snake you said
[1:03:25] it to prove a point why don't you say it
[1:03:27] the next time with a Little Love in Your
[1:03:29] Heart and a desire to help the man I
[1:03:31] think we should live our lives always as
[1:03:33] able Minister what's an able Minister a
[1:03:35] minister that's there to minister and
[1:03:37] help somebody that's the objective is
[1:03:40] help somebody not to just go around with
[1:03:42] a blow horn and just tell everybody what
[1:03:44] we know and say everybody rejected it no
[1:03:47] they probably just rejected
[1:03:49] you they probably just rejected your
[1:03:52] approach no
[1:03:54] love no
[1:03:56] sincerity no joy the one that's never
[1:04:00] happy and angry at everybody and
[1:04:01] criticizes everybody he's going to tell
[1:04:03] me how to live my
[1:04:05] life I'm sorry the Witnesses are
[1:04:07] witnessing against
[1:04:10] you faith hope and charity isn't
[1:04:12] speaking on your behalf they're not
[1:04:14] backing you
[1:04:23] up
[1:04:25] continue on the Rapture but to the
[1:04:27] church the bride the Rapture is a
[1:04:29] revelation to her it's revealed to her
[1:04:32] that the Revelation the true bride of
[1:04:34] Christ will be waiting for the
[1:04:36] revelation of the Rapture now it is a
[1:04:38] revelation for the Revelation is Faith
[1:04:42] you cannot have Revelation without it
[1:04:43] being Faith see faith is a
[1:04:46] revelation because it's something that's
[1:04:48] been revealed to you faith is a
[1:04:52] revelation faith is something that has
[1:04:54] been revealed to you like it was to
[1:04:56] Abraham that could call anything
[1:04:58] contrary to that which had been revealed
[1:05:00] to him as though it was wasn't so now
[1:05:03] Faith that's what faith is is a
[1:05:05] revelation of God and the church is
[1:05:08] built upon a revelation and the whole
[1:05:11] entire body that's why he could say to
[1:05:13] Peter Peter who do you say that I am not
[1:05:16] to the group you as an individual who do
[1:05:19] you say that I am and he could say by
[1:05:21] Revelation Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:05:24] of the Living God not to the group it's
[1:05:26] always to the individual and what Echoes
[1:05:29] outside of your what Echoes from your
[1:05:31] life when ask the question not what your
[1:05:34] church says not what your church
[1:05:35] believes not what your pastor says what
[1:05:38] do you say what's echoing from your
[1:05:44] life can I call my third and Final
[1:05:49] witness without this it's all in
[1:05:53] vain
[1:05:55] go back through this I want you to see
[1:05:57] brother Bam's mindset in this he said
[1:06:00] here not long ago I had a
[1:06:02] trial you're precious they're they're
[1:06:04] precious to you I buried a little baby
[1:06:06] in the afternoon out of the home there
[1:06:10] there was a little baby was born and it
[1:06:12] died right away the mother and father I
[1:06:14] said Oh see it's a little cut it's
[1:06:17] something to bring you closer to God I
[1:06:20] remember when my little girl had died
[1:06:22] and I laid her and my and her mother 's
[1:06:24] arms and buried them out there in the
[1:06:26] graveyard my father died my brother got
[1:06:28] killed instantly all of that happened at
[1:06:31] once and there I was going up the road
[1:06:33] one day a pair of boots on right after
[1:06:37] the flood walking tears running down my
[1:06:39] cheeks I could hardly I I couldn't stand
[1:06:41] it hardly walking up the road Mr Eiser
[1:06:44] of Jeffersonville there he's he's
[1:06:46] something another in the state law there

[1:06:52] the highway and I seen him and he
[1:06:53] stopped his car he come to the church
[1:06:55] once in a while little church he put his
[1:06:57] arms around me he said Billy I want to

[1:07:10] holding the hand of your wife when she
[1:07:12] you kissed her goodbye and you told her
[1:07:14] you'd meet her at the gate said you
[1:07:16] turned right around walked down there
[1:07:19] and God took your baby right from your
[1:07:21] arms and you was standing there praying

[1:07:55] then I love him Mr iser if the whole
[1:07:58] world should turn me down and everything
[1:08:01] else I still love him if he condemns me
[1:08:06] I still love
[1:08:08] him there's
[1:08:11] maturity There's real charity though
[1:08:14] everything comes against me I still love
[1:08:17] him no matter what even at the end of
[1:08:19] the road he condemns me I still will
[1:08:21] love him there if there is such a thing
[1:08:23] as love in hell he said I'll still love
[1:08:25] him
[1:08:27] there a witness was
[1:08:31] speaking from that time a man that could
[1:08:35] take the challenge of a priest and let a
[1:08:37] drunken Soldier spit in his face today
[1:08:40] today we got the wrong conception of
[1:08:42] power power is overcoming and returning
[1:08:46] good for evil that's real power that can
[1:08:49] love your enemy and do good to those
[1:08:53] that do evil to you that's real power
[1:08:56] that's God's power yes Maniacs can break
[1:09:00] chains but it takes a real man to return
[1:09:03] good for evil from his heart not of
[1:09:07] religious duty but from his
[1:09:11] heart
[1:09:13] see that's the true witness not I'm
[1:09:16] going to be nice to this person cuz I
[1:09:18] know I'll be able to tell people that
[1:09:19] hey they were they treated me like this
[1:09:21] and you know what I just was sweet to
[1:09:22] them and I was kind and then you went
[1:09:23] told everybody about how you were just
[1:09:25] so sweet and kind to this person though
[1:09:26] they did you so
[1:09:28] evily that's religious that's just
[1:09:31] religion sorry that's not from the heart
[1:09:34] you didn't do that for him you did that
[1:09:37] to exalt yourself yes you vaunteth
[1:09:40] yourself and exalted
[1:09:43] yourself do good and then don't tell
[1:09:45] anybody about it someone does you evil
[1:09:48] you do really good for him and don't say
[1:09:49] a word to nobody about it don't breathe
[1:09:52] it then God gets the
[1:09:55] glory not
[1:09:59] you perfect Faith
[1:10:02] 1963 and when we were yet sinners
[1:10:04] alienated and without God in the world
[1:10:07] in that muck of the mud as I talked
[1:10:09] about this morning God come to us and
[1:10:11] God sought you you never sought God I
[1:10:13] might say that again you never sought
[1:10:17] God so now how much compassion and
[1:10:20] sympathy are you going to have with the
[1:10:22] lost and dying world all around you you
[1:10:25] cuz you never sought him he sought you
[1:10:28] out so I'm wondering if we are now
[1:10:31] continuing the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:10:33] if we will seek others
[1:10:35] out who've rejected us despise us think
[1:10:40] we're
[1:10:42] crazy I think we do I think we have
[1:10:45] enough love in our hearts and compassion
[1:10:46] for another person that we would want to
[1:10:49] go do something to help them no matter
[1:10:51] what no matter if they reject you it
[1:10:52] doesn't matter then
[1:10:56] you never sought him out no man can come
[1:10:58] to me except the father draws him first
[1:11:00] and God came down in that muck that you
[1:11:03] were and sought you out and brought you
[1:11:06] out that ought to create a perfect love
[1:11:10] look what you was and look what you are
[1:11:12] what did that somebody that loved you
[1:11:15] can't you have faith in what he promised
[1:11:18] you then real genuine love will create a
[1:11:20] confidence in his
[1:11:22] word couple weeks ago I was listening to
[1:11:25] the message of Grace and I heard
[1:11:27] something for the first time brother
[1:11:28] bham said that thief on the cross that
[1:11:31] was right besid him he this what he said
[1:11:33] he said God never once crossed that
[1:11:36] boy's mind his whole
[1:11:37] life not one time in his life did he
[1:11:41] even consider
[1:11:44] God he's on the cross dying he says Lord
[1:11:49] remember me when you come into your
[1:11:50] kingdom he said today you'll be with me
[1:11:56] brother bham said
[1:11:58] Grace Grace nothing but Amazing Grace
[1:12:04] not him that willth or him that runneth
[1:12:06] it's not because you've done good or
[1:12:08] because you've done bad it's
[1:12:10] Grace you didn't deserve it we never
[1:12:13] have you never will it's all
[1:12:17] Grace that caps down coming down
[1:12:19] screaming Grace Grace double Grace you
[1:12:23] don't deserve it it's not about what
[1:12:24] you've done I've done it I've completed
[1:12:28] this work I'm the author and I'm the
[1:12:31] finisher of your faith what I started I
[1:12:34] finished not
[1:12:37] you something he's finishing the work
[1:12:40] and it's all
[1:12:42] Grace we know this one charity suffers
[1:12:46] long and it's kind charity envieth not
[1:12:51] charity vaunteth not itself it's not
[1:12:53] puffed up do not behave itself unseemly
[1:12:56] seeketh not its own is not easily
[1:12:58] provoked and it thinketh no evil it
[1:13:00] rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth
[1:13:02] in the truth it beareth all things
[1:13:04] believeth all things hopeth all things
[1:13:06] and endureth all things charity never
[1:13:10] fails remember the story of the man who
[1:13:13] came home late or he was at the bar and
[1:13:15] he told all his friends we're sitting
[1:13:17] there and the friends say there is no
[1:13:18] such saying as a real Christian anymore
[1:13:19] a bunch of
[1:13:21] Hypocrites they're all like us they just
[1:13:23] go to church on Sunday and Wednesday and
[1:13:25] they just act like us every day living
[1:13:27] he goes no boys there's one Christian I
[1:13:29] know of one he goes no no such thing he
[1:13:32] said yes sir it's my wife no come on
[1:13:36] home I'll show you remember they went on
[1:13:39] home and he says hey boys let's act real
[1:13:41] drunk when we get there walk in the door

[1:14:14] that
[1:14:15] way you can do it if you want to You'll
[1:14:17] Never Win
[1:14:20] him she says all right honey I'm sorry
[1:14:23] I'll go make those eggs the way you like
[1:14:25] them again goes back in the kitchen they
[1:14:28] go in there listen to her probably
[1:14:29] thinking she's probably cussing him
[1:14:31] under his breath something fierce nope
[1:14:34] she's singing a little song must I bear
[1:14:37] this cross
[1:14:40] alone there's a cross for him there's a
[1:14:42] cross for me that's what she's
[1:14:45] saying man they all say there it is
[1:14:48] there's a real one this one don't just
[1:14:50] talk about Christianity here's a real
[1:14:52] one we gave her every right we gave her
[1:14:56] every reason why she should get angry at
[1:14:59] us and blow her
[1:15:00] top she must have the
[1:15:03] goods there was a real witness there
[1:15:05] testifying and it was charity testifying
[1:15:09] this one's a real one this one actually
[1:15:12] has the life of Christ and she led her
[1:15:14] husband and all her friends to the
[1:15:20] Lord so kind of wrap it up here I can't
[1:15:24] see the clock
[1:15:27] um we all know brother Bram talks about
[1:15:30] that eagle and its eaglets and one thing
[1:15:34] about the eaglets as they begin to grow
[1:15:36] Mama Eagle makes the nest really nice
[1:15:38] for those little eaglets when they're
[1:15:41] babies but as they become mature and
[1:15:44] they get to growing up and it's time for
[1:15:46] them to get the flight time for them to
[1:15:48] realize what they're made of is just
[1:15:51] exactly what Mama's made of
[1:15:53] Mama ego gets real
[1:15:55] mean really starts I mean mean mean mama
[1:16:01] starts pulling out all the rabbit hair
[1:16:03] all the feathers all the soft grass
[1:16:06] everything nice and comfortable and
[1:16:09] starts to introduce all these painful
[1:16:11] Pokey proddy things into the life of
[1:16:14] this Eagle such a mean
[1:16:19] mother no it's time to go yes time to
[1:16:23] grow up no more babying time to mature
[1:16:29] and that Mama gets really mean you know
[1:16:30] what it'll do stops bringing food back
[1:16:33] to the
[1:16:34] nest that'll get them
[1:16:37] moving yeah Mama stops coming and
[1:16:39] feeding those
[1:16:41] babies and then they have to leave the
[1:16:43] nest or they'll
[1:16:44] die comes a point in time you have to
[1:16:47] leave the nest or you die you must move
[1:16:50] on into maturity you must not stop
[1:16:53] taking a path of least resistance you
[1:16:56] must stop avoiding a cross every day
[1:16:59] that you need to pick up yes it comes a
[1:17:02] point in time you got to grow up realize
[1:17:05] you were built for this you find
[1:17:07] yourself in a bad situation a spouse a
[1:17:10] family member a son a daughter man
[1:17:13] they're difficult oh I just can't I
[1:17:16] can't live a Christian Life with
[1:17:18] them n yeah you can just need to revisit
[1:17:22] the cross yes just need to go back there
[1:17:25] and consider remember he bore a cross
[1:17:28] not for himself but for somebody
[1:17:30] else Jesus bore a
[1:17:33] cross for somebody else me and you for
[1:17:36] the joy that was set before him
[1:17:38] fellowship with me and you he was
[1:17:39] willing to endure a
[1:17:41] cross so then we have to find ours cuz
[1:17:44] someone else is dependent upon
[1:17:49] us and so I'll just how many remember
[1:17:52] six seconds Smith Brother bam talks
[1:17:54] about 6 second Smith he was a
[1:17:56] boxer right it's interesting there's one
[1:18:00] last component that this boxer needs to
[1:18:03] know see if you can find out see what
[1:18:06] see what he says he says I tell you
[1:18:08] Billy no matter how well trained you are
[1:18:11] and how ath how much athletic experience
[1:18:14] you have and how strong you are for your
[1:18:16] size or anything like that said a lick
[1:18:21] stops the blood when it hits you like
[1:18:23] that okay well
[1:18:26] trained athletic and
[1:18:29] strong but he's got to be beat up a
[1:18:32] little
[1:18:33] bit he can't take a punch he can't take
[1:18:36] the pain and difficulty of someone
[1:18:39] beating
[1:18:40] him so what was the last training of
[1:18:42] brother brandham 6C Smith beats the tar
[1:18:45] out of
[1:18:46] him let's see if I say he said but he
[1:18:49] says uh said your body builds up to that
[1:18:51] so it can come back quit if if you get
[1:18:53] hit and just fall over and you lay there
[1:18:56] and take a count but if your body is
[1:18:57] built and can stand the licks said then
[1:19:00] when you when you hit it a hard H lick
[1:19:04] hits you said then you'll come right
[1:19:06] back quick back to your feet get knocked
[1:19:08] out of the ring jump back in he had just
[1:19:12] got through knocked me Plum out of the
[1:19:13] ring he said you have we just got to do
[1:19:16] this do that see he liked to kill me he
[1:19:19] was about 30 40 lbs heavier than I ever
[1:19:22] was
[1:19:23] and he was a fighter and I was just a
[1:19:25] student so he was almost killing me he
[1:19:28] said but you'll appreciate that when you
[1:19:31] get in the ring and I found that to be
[1:19:35] true a mean mama Eagle to the babies
[1:19:38] making life difficult no just bringing
[1:19:41] it to maturity 6C SM Smith training a
[1:19:45] boxer hated his student no last part of
[1:19:49] the challenge I got to beat you up I
[1:19:52] have to just beat you I have to bring
[1:19:54] one trial after another trial after
[1:19:57] another trial after one left hook after
[1:19:59] another right hook I'm going to punch
[1:20:01] you in the gut ever feel life is like
[1:20:04] that at
[1:20:05] times it's training you come back
[1:20:08] quickly get back in the ring work to be
[1:20:11] done and you got to take the licks and
[1:20:13] we all got them
[1:20:16] coming
[1:20:21] so
[1:20:24] oh we're going to wrap it up here but
[1:20:28] just so you know that God has a purpose
[1:20:29] in the licks there's a purpose behind it
[1:20:32] every pain serves its purpose you see
[1:20:36] they could not figure out what God's
[1:20:38] God's love they thought that love meant
[1:20:40] no suffering they thought that love
[1:20:42] meant a baby with parental care but God
[1:20:45] said that his love was an elective love
[1:20:48] and the proof of his love is election
[1:20:50] that no matter what happened his love
[1:20:52] was proved truly by the fact that they
[1:20:54] were chosen unto salvation because God
[1:20:57] hath chosen you to Salvation through
[1:20:59] sanctification and the spirit and belief
[1:21:01] of the truth he may commit you to death
[1:21:04] as he did Paul he may commit you to
[1:21:06] sufferings as he did job that is his
[1:21:09] prerogative and he is Sovereign but it
[1:21:11] is all with a purpose so pain has a
[1:21:16] purpose if he did not have a purpose he
[1:21:19] wouldd be the author of frustration and
[1:21:21] not of Peace his purpose is that after
[1:21:23] we have suffered a while he would that
[1:21:26] we would be made perfect be established
[1:21:28] be strengthened and settled as job said
[1:21:31] he put strength in us and he he himself
[1:21:35] suffered he learned obedience by the
[1:21:37] things that he suffered he was actually
[1:21:39] made perfect by the things that he
[1:21:42] suffered Hebrews 58-9 though he were a
[1:21:46] son yet learned he obedience by the
[1:21:49] things that he suffered and being made
[1:21:51] perfect he became became the author of
[1:21:53] Eternal salvation unto all them that
[1:21:56] obey in him in plain language the very
[1:21:59] character of Jesus Christ was perfected
[1:22:01] by suffering and according to Paul he
[1:22:05] has left his church a measure of
[1:22:07] suffering that they too by their faith
[1:22:10] in God while suffering for him would
[1:22:14] come to a place of
[1:22:17] perfection no perfection without the
[1:22:19] pain everyone no perfection without
[1:22:23] pain none none none none so count it all
[1:22:28] joy when you fall into divers
[1:22:30] Temptations for the trying of your faith
[1:22:33] it's serving its purpose the trials must
[1:22:36] come the difficulties of life it's not
[1:22:38] there to kill you it's just there to
[1:22:40] mold in you the very character of Jesus
[1:22:42] Christ that can only come through
[1:22:44] pain just part of the
[1:22:49] process this is a continuation he says
[1:22:51] why does he stand stand by the reason is
[1:22:54] in this Romans 8:17 and 18 and if
[1:22:59] children then hirs and Heirs of God and
[1:23:01] join HS with Christ if so be that we
[1:23:04] suffer with him that we may be also
[1:23:06] glorified together for I reckon that the
[1:23:08] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:23:10] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:23:12] which shall be revealed in US unless we
[1:23:15] suffer with him we cannot reign with him
[1:23:17] you have to suffer to Reign the reason
[1:23:20] for this is that character simply is
[1:23:22] never made without suffering character
[1:23:25] is a victory and not a gift a man
[1:23:28] without character cannot Reign because
[1:23:30] power apart from character is satanic
[1:23:33] but Power with character is fit to rule
[1:23:36] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:23:38] throne on the same basis that he
[1:23:40] overcame and sat down in his father's
[1:23:43] Throne then we have to overcome to sit
[1:23:45] with him and the little temporary
[1:23:47] sufferings that we go through now is not
[1:23:49] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[1:23:51] Glory that will be revealed in us when
[1:23:53] he comes oh what Treasures are laid up
[1:23:56] for those who are willing to enter into
[1:23:58] his kingdom through much
[1:24:01] tribulation amen it's worth the pain
[1:24:05] it's worth the pain it's worth it if you
[1:24:08] only knew what lied just ahead but you
[1:24:12] have to look at what's just ahead to
[1:24:13] endure the sufferings who for the joy
[1:24:16] that was just before him he had to look
[1:24:18] just a little bit farther ahead to
[1:24:20] endure that cross and so do we we're
[1:24:24] going to rule and reign with
[1:24:27] him but we're not coming to it easy
[1:24:30] everyone adoption is a tough one
[1:24:32] maturing of a son is painful be ready I
[1:24:36] don't know what else to say but just be
[1:24:38] ready and thank God that those witnesses
[1:24:40] will stand on my behalf in the midst of
[1:24:42] the situation cuz he began this work he
[1:24:45] finishes this work this isn't relying
[1:24:48] upon you as an individual to figure
[1:24:49] something out or be able to do it in
[1:24:50] your own willpower no just just believe
[1:24:52] God have faith and confidence that God
[1:24:54] will keep his word and the one that
[1:24:55] started the work in you will finish the
[1:24:57] work in you if you stand like that then
[1:24:59] he comes on the scene and fights the
[1:25:01] battles and he on the scene comes down
[1:25:03] something bubbling up on the inside I
[1:25:05] don't know where it came from it's past
[1:25:06] reasoning it's past understanding but my
[1:25:08] hope lith in the Lord he is my hope and
[1:25:11] my stay he is my strength when I am weak
[1:25:14] something bubbling beyond the human
[1:25:16] intellect something way down deep and
[1:25:20] maybe by God's grace we need some of
[1:25:22] that
[1:25:22] amen maybe we need to have some of these
[1:25:24] difficulties and sufferings and some
[1:25:26] pains to come our way so that those
[1:25:28] witnesses can come up and give us the
[1:25:29] reassurance that we may not even have
[1:25:32] right
[1:25:33] now we always want to bypass pain but
[1:25:36] maybe it's through pain that we actually
[1:25:37] come to the thing that we long for so
[1:25:39] very much who doesn't want to be more
[1:25:41] like
[1:25:42] Christ do you know what it takes to
[1:25:44] become like
[1:25:50] Christ we always want the good but you
[1:25:54] can't have the good unless you're
[1:25:54] willing to endure the pain of the
[1:25:57] difficulty Parts there's just painful
[1:26:00] Parts it just is but if you love him
[1:26:03] it'll all work out don't worry about
[1:26:06] none of it it'll all serve its purpose
[1:26:08] in your life musicians will you
[1:26:11] come 1 Peter 5:9 says whom resists
[1:26:15] steadfast in the faith knowing that with
[1:26:17] with that the same afflictions are
[1:26:20] accomplished in your brethren that are
[1:26:21] in the
[1:26:23] world but the God of all Grace who ha
[1:26:25] called us unto his eternal glory by
[1:26:27] Christ Jesus after that you have
[1:26:29] suffered a while make you perfect
[1:26:32] established strengthen and settle you
[1:26:35] everybody in this natural life has
[1:26:37] problems everybody suffers loss
[1:26:40] difficulties rejections false
[1:26:43] accusations any human being will at some
[1:26:46] point in time experience any and all of
[1:26:48] those
[1:26:49] things but when they come to us we are
[1:26:51] not without a hope
[1:26:52] hope when they come to us they're there
[1:26:55] to mold us and shape us and to bring
[1:26:58] those Witnesses into view on our behalf
[1:27:00] amen and maybe at times if they're not
[1:27:03] in view it's just a time to go back to
[1:27:06] the Lord and say Lord I got off the path
[1:27:09] somewhere I don't know where maybe I
[1:27:12] took the path of least resistance I
[1:27:14] wasn't looking to Bear any cross I just
[1:27:17] wanted to live a comfortable natural
[1:27:20] life and if those Witnesses aren't
[1:27:23] present that's just what it means it's
[1:27:25] just time to go back to the Lord and get
[1:27:27] one-on-one with him reconnect with him
[1:27:30] get away from a religious walk and get
[1:27:31] back into a relationship with God God
[1:27:34] wants a relationship God wants to be
[1:27:36] loved God's looking for a wife someone
[1:27:39] who care for him think about him love
[1:27:41] him spend time with him I mean if my
[1:27:44] wife never spends time with me I
[1:27:46] question whether or not she loves me and
[1:27:49] if you never spend time alone with God
[1:27:51] and you think that you're Al your time
[1:27:53] or how do I say it
[1:27:56] nice I didn't mean to say that out loud
[1:27:58] I was
[1:28:00] thinking I think at times we substitute
[1:28:03] going to church fellowshipping with
[1:28:05] Christians as a walk with God
[1:28:10] sorry I believe brother Brandon preached
[1:28:12] is your life worthy of the gospel and is
[1:28:14] your life worthy of the Gospel it's a
[1:28:16] life that it's every day of every hour
[1:28:20] of every moment I'm in communion with
[1:28:23] him church is there to strengthen you
[1:28:26] help you speak to you encourage you to
[1:28:29] continue a walk every day with him
[1:28:32] that's what he wants the
[1:28:37] relationship will you
[1:28:39] stand sorry 8:45 I apologize Wednesday
[1:28:44] night I tried I
[1:28:48] tried sure love you all I bless you I
[1:28:51] hope it was an encouragement in some
[1:28:53] form and fashion and kind of maybe you
[1:28:59] know it's Christmas time and a lot of
[1:29:04] people have strong
[1:29:05] views to me if it's a day of celebration
[1:29:08] of the birth of Jesus Christ praise God
[1:29:12] we know it wasn't this time of the year
[1:29:13] but it's still people celebrating the
[1:29:15] birth of Christ and if it's an
[1:29:18] opportunity where once a year your
[1:29:20] family all gets together
[1:29:22] I wouldn't avoid
[1:29:24] it it's once a
[1:29:26] year and i' take every Advantage we can
[1:29:29] while we're still in these mortal bodies
[1:29:31] to be a living testimony for Christ a
[1:29:34] living witness of his grace of his power
[1:29:38] of His
[1:29:40] Mercy while yet believing that the same
[1:29:43] gospel that we believe that transformed
[1:29:45] us can transform
[1:29:47] them um if we don't believe then that we
[1:29:51] we don't have a solid rock that we're
[1:29:52] standing on and so After experiencing
[1:29:56] what I experienced last week I would say
[1:30:00] don't cut yourself off from your family
[1:30:02] your friends even those that rejected
[1:30:04] you or rejected things you've said in
[1:30:06] the past
[1:30:07] remember maybe they just rejected you
[1:30:11] maybe it wasn't the words maybe it
[1:30:14] wasn't accompanied with
[1:30:15] love hope and charity let's bring those
[1:30:19] Witnesses into view and see what they
[1:30:22] will do they can do a better time
[1:30:24] witnessing than you ever could with your
[1:30:26] words let them see a life that lives a
[1:30:29] life of Hope a life that really loves
[1:30:33] and a life that really has faith that
[1:30:35] God keeps his word why don't you let him
[1:30:37] read that in your life a little bit and
[1:30:39] see what kind of an effect that could
[1:30:41] have on the world around
[1:30:44] them let's just bow our heads and
[1:30:47] pray heavenly father so thankful Lord
