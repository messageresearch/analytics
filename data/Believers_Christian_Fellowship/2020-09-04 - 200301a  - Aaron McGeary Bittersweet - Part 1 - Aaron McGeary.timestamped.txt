[0:00] i know that jesus
[0:04] is the same today
[0:07] the prophet
[0:11] the bride must have it
[0:15] the on display come for christ in us
[0:18] to be completely glorified
[0:42] is
[0:56] is
[1:06] you may be seated
[1:15] [Music]
[1:36] and revelation only
[1:41] [Music]
[1:49] [Applause]
[1:52] because
[1:55] [Applause]
[1:59] [Music]
[2:06] the bride is receiving new revelations
[2:11] we're able to read between the lines
[2:17] and now the enemy is using all of his
[2:21] weapons
[2:22] to discourage deceive and destroy
[2:27] but only through his attempts he's
[2:30] caused the shack to stand out
[2:32] and to pull away from
[2:40] [Music]
[2:44] [Applause]
[2:46] i can only eat the bleeding
[2:51] my wings have felt the winds of
[2:54] faith and revelation
[2:58] only clears my view
[3:02] i can't return to what i've been
[3:07] and you can't persuade me otherwise
[3:12] because i've recognized that i'm an ego
[3:20] [Music]
[3:25] the bride has been taught by the
[3:31] to eleazar for more revelation
[3:36] truths are unfolding and daily we're
[3:40] growing
[3:41] we cannot stand on our intellect
[3:47] the squeeze is tightening in ways we
[3:50] never thought
[3:52] but all the while the bride's rejoicing
[4:00] i'm seeing more than i'm an ego
[4:05] i can only eat the bleeding word
[4:10] my wings
[4:14] [Music]
[4:18] [Applause]
[4:26] and you can't persuade me otherwise
[4:31] because i've recognized that i'm an ego
[4:44] spirits of old are deceiving
[4:49] causing many to reject christ within his
[4:53] bride
[4:54] yet the life is manifesting
[5:00] and she won't turn back her identity
[5:08] lies
[5:30] [Music]
[5:35] [Music]
[5:36] and you can't persuade me otherwise
[5:41] because i've recognized that i'm an ego
[5:50] i've recognized
[5:54] [Music]
[6:03] [Applause]
[6:15] you can fly
[6:18] in a higher place

[13:32] oh
[13:36] our gracious heavenly father lord we
[13:38] worship you in spirit and in truth
[13:40] and lord we're humbled in your presence
[13:43] lord we sense that you desire to speak
[13:45] to us
[13:46] lord we know that we are not just
[13:49] gathering as the pastors already said
[13:50] traditionally
[13:52] lord we're not merely doing it because
[13:53] we believe it's an obligation to avoid
[13:55] hell
[13:56] but lord something in our hearts draws
[13:58] us to this place
[14:00] knowing that you've promised to speak to
[14:02] us in your word
[14:03] knowing lord that as we as we worship
[14:06] and lift our hands and praise that you
[14:08] come inhabit those praises
[14:10] and that you merely do not inhabit them
[14:12] that we might feel good but lord you're
[14:14] creating
[14:15] within us an expectation that you're
[14:17] here to speak to us
[14:18] and lord as we have done our part in
[14:20] laying aside the things of the
[14:22] of the flesh and the demands upon our
[14:24] time and look to you under expectation
[14:26] and have worshiped you
[14:28] and lifted your name and praise come now
[14:30] lord and take this bread and break it
[14:32] and feed it to us
[14:33] lord i believe myself personally as i
[14:35] look at this word and see it as
[14:37] maybe one sermon you can take it and
[14:40] divide it in such a way to feed five
[14:42] thousand
[14:43] lord divided in such a way that there's
[14:44] even leftovers lord there's more for
[14:46] those who would come later and maybe
[14:48] listen to it
[14:49] so father i pray that you would come now
[14:51] take the words which we read from your
[14:53] scripture and bless them
[14:55] take the burden which you've laid upon
[14:56] my heart lord and may you faithfully
[14:58] deliver it to your children
[15:00] that they may receive it and be
[15:01] benefited by it we ask these things in
[15:03] the lord jesus christ
[15:04] amen while you're standing i'd like to
[15:07] turn to the book of revelation
[15:10] revelation chapter 10 and i'm going to
[15:12] be reading verses 8 to 11
[15:15] revelations chapter 10 verses 8 to 11.

[15:29] to see you and to be in fellowship with
[15:30] you and glad to have

[15:41] greet
[15:42] greet some of you we're very very happy
[15:43] to be here we bring greetings to you
[15:46] from
[15:46] hickory bible tabernacle and no the
[15:48] church i'm going to didn't change their
[15:50] name but since the last time i was here
[15:51] i moved
[15:52] and so we're living now in newton north
[15:55] carolina
[15:56] and attending hickory bible tabernacle
[15:58] and they send their love and greetings
[15:59] to you and
[16:00] pastor brother barry coffey sends his
[16:02] greetings to you and especially to
[16:03] brother chad and sister angie
[16:05] so love and greetings from north
[16:06] carolina i'm officially in the south
[16:08] so you pray for me
[16:12] revelations chapter 10 verses 8 to 11
[16:15] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[16:18] spake unto me again and said go and take
[16:21] the little book which is open
[16:23] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[16:25] upon the sea
[16:26] and upon the earth and i went unto the
[16:29] angel
[16:30] and said unto him give me the little
[16:32] book
[16:33] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[16:36] up and it shall make thy belly
[16:38] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[16:40] sweet as honey
[16:41] and i took the little book out of the
[16:43] angel's hand and ate it up
[16:45] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[16:47] and as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[16:49] was
[16:50] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[16:52] prophesy again
[16:53] before many peoples and nations and
[16:56] tongues
[16:57] and kings amen you may be seated
[17:07] i'll give you my title here at the
[17:09] beginning
[17:11] the title is bittersweet and drawing
[17:14] that from the scripture where and it
[17:16] says that
[17:16] it was sweet in his mouth and bitter in
[17:18] his belly
[17:19] and so our title is bittersweet and
[17:23] i would maybe ask you now and perhaps i
[17:25] could remind you as we continue to just
[17:27] stay
[17:29] close with me today as i go through this
[17:32] subject it's one that
[17:34] i haven't had the privilege of
[17:35] ministering before and so something
[17:37] that's
[17:38] very heavy upon my heart i'm grateful
[17:40] for the opportunity to deliver it
[17:42] this morning to you but just stay with
[17:44] me as it may seem somewhat of a journey
[17:46] and as we go through certain principles
[17:48] in the scripture and laying the
[17:49] different foundations
[17:51] uh from the message of the hour um my
[17:54] my inspiration is on this this term
[17:56] bittersweet
[17:57] and uh we're just gonna kind of take a
[17:59] journey to arrive to how the lord has
[18:00] dealt with me
[18:01] on what that means for us but let's just
[18:04] start by looking at verse 11 revelations
[18:06] chapter 10 verse 11.
[18:07] and i'm going to just be laying some
[18:10] principles that are very familiar to us
[18:13] and um when we do so it can just be an
[18:15] exercise in saying amen
[18:17] and uh in agreeing and pulling on the
[18:20] word of god and saying sick them to the
[18:21] preacher like
[18:22] we believe that we lay that principle
[18:24] down and then we can kind of get into a
[18:26] momentum
[18:27] of where we're wanting to go and it says
[18:29] in verse 11 and he said unto me thou
[18:31] must prophesy again before many peoples
[18:35] and nations
[18:35] and tongues and kings and so this is
[18:38] spoken to john
[18:40] and we understand that john here is
[18:43] representative of
[18:44] the bride and that this speaks to the
[18:47] elect in the end time who are to
[18:49] prophesy again and speak the word of god
[18:52] utter to declare and utter the holy
[18:54] oracles of god to many peoples
[18:56] and nations tongues and kings and so
[18:59] this is a worldwide commission to the
[19:01] bride
[19:02] and it is to globally declare the divine
[19:05] revelation of christ
[19:06] so when we read this scripture we
[19:08] personally identify with john being told
[19:10] thou must prophesy again we recognize
[19:13] that this is
[19:14] prophetic of the bride being anointed to
[19:17] declare the word of god
[19:18] around the world to herself be the
[19:21] expression of the lord jesus christ
[19:23] around the world so we're looking at the
[19:25] bride's ministry this is the bride's
[19:27] ministry to prophesy
[19:28] again in revelations chapter 22 verse 17
[19:31] it says and the spirit and the bride say
[19:34] come
[19:35] so you can see as the book of revelation
[19:37] is closed and as the entire bible is
[19:39] closing
[19:40] there's an announcement or there's a
[19:41] message that needs to be declared
[19:43] and it's not just the spirit saying it
[19:45] but it's the spirit
[19:46] and the bride because it's the spirit
[19:48] through the body of the bride that is
[19:50] saying
[19:51] come so it's not just the scripture
[19:53] saying and it's not the spirit speaking
[19:56] in the environment and hearing it but
[19:58] rather it's the spirit
[19:59] through the bride's body declaring and
[20:01] saying come
[20:03] and there's a number of statements that
[20:05] we could read a number of scriptures
[20:06] that we could read
[20:08] just to stay in that particular channel
[20:11] and i uh and i but i just want to refer
[20:14] to this very quickly
[20:16] and i just feel checked for a moment
[20:18] just to say i want i appreciate brother
[20:19] chad and sister angie and appreciate
[20:21] their friendship the friendship their
[20:22] family is to me and my children
[20:24] and if i didn't acknowledge you there in
[20:26] the beginning it's because i'm nervous
[20:28] and i always say and do something silly
[20:30] or don't say
[20:31] something that's rude uh and insensitive
[20:34] by not saying hello so i apologize
[20:36] for not saying thank you very much to
[20:38] brother chad for his friendship and for
[20:40] the invitation to be here together
[20:42] with you apologize for that and i'm sure
[20:45] there was no offense brother chad but
[20:46] that's just me making it right
[20:48] for not greeting the pastor it's because
[20:51] the last time i was here he didn't even
[20:52] come so i'm just
[20:53] just
[20:57] but i want to read a few statements he
[20:59] was out of town for those who are
[21:00] streaming he was he was out of town
[21:04] it did i just want to read a few
[21:05] statements from the church age book and
[21:07] this will kind of help
[21:08] uh just orient us to how this is uh
[21:10] firmly within the message
[21:12] he says in this last day there is again
[21:14] another people in the land
[21:16] who under their messenger will be the
[21:18] final voice to
[21:20] the final age very familiar statement to
[21:22] us and there's many
[21:24] uh uh many times we have heard this and
[21:26] i believe that the emphasis should be
[21:28] not only on how we are the final voice
[21:30] to the final age
[21:31] but that we are only that voice under
[21:33] our messenger
[21:35] so we will never uh we will never even
[21:37] though we know progressive revelation
[21:39] is a concept within the message our
[21:42] revelation will never progress
[21:44] beyond the message so there's
[21:46] progressive revelation within the
[21:47] message but as revelation progresses in
[21:49] the bride
[21:50] it'll never go beyond what has been
[21:52] given the prophet has sown the entire
[21:54] seat of the bible he has brought us a
[21:56] complete and perfect message
[21:57] and so we will always be if we're to be
[21:59] a voice we will always be
[22:01] under our messenger and so this is a
[22:04] principle that's
[22:05] very important for us to understand we
[22:06] will be under our messenger and under
[22:08] our messenger
[22:09] we are the final voice to the final age
[22:12] and he makes the statement the voice of
[22:14] god will be in her
[22:16] and it's not that we have a prophet that
[22:18] is part of the bride but the voice of
[22:20] god is in her as a body
[22:22] he says this once more the world will
[22:25] hear direct
[22:26] from god as at pentecost and so he's
[22:29] wanting us to understand that there's a
[22:30] dynamic that takes place in the end time
[22:33] where the bride is speaking once again
[22:36] just as it did on the day of pentecost
[22:38] once more the world will hear direct
[22:40] from god as at the day of pentecost
[22:42] if you go and read in acts chapter 2
[22:44] verses 4 to 11
[22:46] and starting there in acts chapter 2 it
[22:49] tells us when the day of pentecost was
[22:51] fully come
[22:52] so it wasn't just an anointing or move
[22:54] of god that transpired in a
[22:56] in an isolated event but it was a
[22:58] prophecy coming to pass
[23:00] and there it came a time and a moment
[23:02] where god's word was going to be
[23:03] fulfilled
[23:04] so it wasn't that they gathered in the
[23:05] upper room and they fasted just long
[23:07] enough and they prayed just hard enough
[23:10] and they somehow something just clicked
[23:12] and it was time for the holy ghost to
[23:13] come
[23:14] but it was a time and a season of
[23:16] prophecy that when the day of pentecost
[23:18] had fully come
[23:19] now it was time for god to fulfill his
[23:21] word and there was a people there to
[23:23] receive it
[23:24] it says when the day of pentecost was
[23:25] fully come in galatians 4 4 it speaks of
[23:28] how when the fullness of time had come
[23:30] god sent forth his son well the fullness
[23:32] of time time wasn't over but it was the
[23:34] fullness of prophecy
[23:36] it's time for that prophecy to be
[23:38] fulfilled and brother brahman says just
[23:39] like it was on the day of pentecost once
[23:41] again the world will hear direct from
[23:43] god
[23:44] as at pentecost when this prophetic
[23:46] season comes to its fullness
[23:48] when it's time for the word to come
[23:50] forth and as you read that
[23:52] uh the instance there in acts chapter 2
[23:54] it says they begin to speak
[23:56] after they were filled with the holy
[23:57] ghost they begin to utter and they begin
[23:59] to speak
[24:00] and it says that men out of every nation
[24:02] under heaven
[24:03] heard them speak and so there's a
[24:07] from devoutment from africa from asia
[24:10] from europe from every nation out of
[24:11] every nation under heaven
[24:13] they all heard the word and who did they
[24:15] hear it through
[24:16] the bride's body in their own language
[24:20] and those were the dynamics of the
[24:21] specifics of the dynamics that on that
[24:23] day
[24:23] here they are speaking in tongues but
[24:25] yet it's in a foreign language it's in a
[24:27] language that other people can hear
[24:29] and he's saying just as the world heard
[24:31] from god on the day of pentecost
[24:33] the world will hear direct from god as
[24:35] at the day of pentecost
[24:37] what is it it's a type of revelations 10
[24:39] 11 thou must prophesy
[24:41] before many peoples nations and tongues
[24:44] and what's happening god is declaring
[24:46] the word through a mini-membered body
[24:48] around the world
[24:49] with many different tongues and nations
[24:52] and every nation under heaven
[24:53] is hearing this word expressed in their
[24:56] own language
[24:58] because once again the world is hearing
[24:59] direct from god
[25:01] and so a many membered body is speaking
[25:04] at the
[25:04] when the fullness of time has come for
[25:06] her to speak and the fullness is coming
[25:08] for her to declare the word
[25:10] he says but of course that word bride
[25:12] will be repudiated
[25:13] as in the first age so she's going to
[25:15] have this very dynamic global ministry
[25:17] but it's going to be rejected
[25:19] he says oh god still has a voice for the
[25:21] people of the world
[25:23] even as he has given a voice to the
[25:25] bride
[25:27] the voice is in the bride so the bride
[25:30] is not without a voice
[25:32] she has a voice the voice is in the
[25:34] bride he says he's he's repeating this
[25:35] over and over the voice of god
[25:37] will be in her she's the final voice to
[25:39] the final age the world's going to hear
[25:41] direct from
[25:42] god how through the bride and with all
[25:45] due respect it's not just pushing play
[25:48] but those who are pushing play are able
[25:50] to speak
[25:51] and declare the holy oracles of god
[25:53] because the voice is
[25:54] in the bride and so that we and i
[25:57] believe he
[25:57] gets to this very specific language so
[26:00] that we can understand it's not a single
[26:01] ministry
[26:02] god's not raising up one man to be our
[26:04] mouthpiece and god is not raising up
[26:06] another messenger to declare the truth
[26:08] and explain to us
[26:09] what the message means and there's no
[26:11] type as mo aaron was given to moses
[26:14] so his have you been given to brother
[26:16] branham to explain
[26:17] everything that he had wanted to say no
[26:19] the bride has a direct connection to the
[26:22] message to listen to it and to hear it
[26:24] and god has gifted and sent ministers to
[26:27] take this word
[26:28] and speak it to us and declare it to us
[26:31] and be in harmony with the original
[26:32] message that was given
[26:34] but then all of us being partakers in
[26:36] this one bread we
[26:38] too are the voice of god in this last
[26:40] day
[26:42] he says in those elect so he's speaking
[26:44] to the individuals
[26:46] those elect with him in that day will be
[26:48] the ones
[26:49] who truly manifest the lord and be his
[26:52] body
[26:53] and be his voice and perform his
[26:56] works so there are individuals who will
[26:59] be his body and will be his voice and
[27:02] perform his works
[27:03] it's the manifestation of christ in in
[27:06] the body
[27:07] in the body form of the bride right it's
[27:10] a manifestation of christ
[27:12] where there's a a body form who's
[27:14] speaking the word and performing his
[27:16] acts this is what the scripture's
[27:18] telling us this is what the message is
[27:19] telling us
[27:20] and so the bride is under commission
[27:22] according to revelations 10 11 to
[27:24] prophesy
[27:25] it is the ministry of jesus christ in
[27:28] bride form
[27:29] brother branham says in the message
[27:30] modern events made clear by prophecy
[27:33] when he begins to reveal himself into
[27:35] the seed form
[27:36] again the same one that went into the
[27:39] ground
[27:40] come back to be the bride and there's
[27:43] times when brother
[27:43] is referring to the church going into
[27:45] the ground and there's other times when
[27:47] he's referring to christ himself
[27:48] who went into the ground and here he's
[27:50] showing us that the bride
[27:52] is now a representation of that seed
[27:54] christ that went into the ground
[27:56] it's coming back to be a bride he says
[27:59] just the bride and the groom
[28:01] is the same flesh and blood the same
[28:04] ministry and the same things doing just
[28:07] exactly what he'd done
[28:09] and so brother branham is emphasizing to
[28:11] us it is the same
[28:13] flesh and blood the same ministry and
[28:15] the same things
[28:16] doing just exactly what he'd done so the
[28:18] bride has the same
[28:20] ministry of christ as christ now i don't
[28:23] want to make
[28:23] the mistake of trying to distinguish
[28:26] what was his ministry and what's our
[28:27] ministry i just believe that our
[28:29] ministry is
[28:30] his ministry and he makes the statement
[28:33] about it this this is just maybe a
[28:35] a fragment or just a phrase but he says
[28:37] manifesting in full measure
[28:39] the bride the same as the groom so the
[28:42] bride is the full manifestation
[28:44] she is a manifestation of the full
[28:45] measure and she's the same
[28:48] as the groom he makes the statement she
[28:51] is him now we understand that's a
[28:53] mouthful and it's a paradox but we
[28:54] believe it
[28:56] he says in the message proving his word
[28:58] when the word here unites with the
[29:00] person
[29:00] and they too become one then what does
[29:03] it do then
[29:04] it manifests the son of man again not
[29:07] the church theologians
[29:08] the son of man the word and the church
[29:11] becomes one
[29:12] whatever the son of man done he was the
[29:14] word the church does the same
[29:17] thing so revelations 10 11 the bride
[29:20] prophesying again to
[29:21] a peoples nations tongues and kings it
[29:23] is the ministry of the son of man in
[29:26] br in the bride body in bride form it is
[29:29] the ministry of jesus christ once again
[29:31] on earth god has returned back in human
[29:34] beings
[29:35] in physical form and the word has
[29:37] embodied itself in a people
[29:39] and what is being shown forth from her
[29:42] are the praises of god
[29:43] is the word of god and she's uttering
[29:45] the holy oracles of god
[29:46] and so once more the world is hearing
[29:48] direct from god
[29:50] he said well the world's not hearing his
[29:52] voice but they're hearing direct from
[29:54] god
[29:54] and it's from you has sounded out the
[29:56] word of the lord
[29:58] just as as paul wrote to the
[30:00] thessalonians and colossians and he
[30:01] wrote and he said
[30:02] i write to you in ink and paper but you
[30:05] having read my epistle and then lived
[30:08] the epistle
[30:09] you become my letter now in flesh he
[30:11] says so that i don't even have need to
[30:13] go to your place
[30:15] so i don't need to ride that trail again
[30:17] i don't need to come back and hold a
[30:19] meeting
[30:19] i don't need to be resurrected because
[30:21] you by taking my message and living it
[30:23] out
[30:24] you have declared it so i have no need
[30:26] to come back and do it
[30:29] that's just what the bible says and so
[30:33] we're showing here and just laying a
[30:35] foundation the bride's ministry
[30:38] and brother branham writes this in
[30:39] chapter 3 of the church age book when
[30:41] he's writing about the ephesians
[30:43] church age he says the true church of
[30:46] jesus christ the bride
[30:47] is likened to pure gold that's pure
[30:50] deity
[30:53] wow these are brother brands words i
[30:56] almost wish i would have brought maybe
[30:58] the church age book and highlighted it
[30:59] we could have had the cameraman zoom in
[31:01] on it because
[31:01] somebody may think i'm reading from the
[31:04] catholic the catechism or something of
[31:06] the catholic church
[31:08] but he says the true church of jesus
[31:10] christ the bride is likened to pure gold
[31:13] her righteousness is his righteousness
[31:16] her attributes are his own glorious
[31:18] attributes
[31:20] her identity is found in him what he
[31:23] is she is to reflect what he has
[31:26] she is to manifest there is no fault
[31:30] in her oh my she is all glorious within
[31:34] and without from beginning to ending
[31:37] she is the work of her lord and all his
[31:40] works
[31:41] are perfect in fact in her
[31:44] is summed up and manifested the eternal
[31:47] wisdom and purpose of god
[31:50] now any can anybody raise their hand and
[31:52] testify that this
[31:54] is in the church age book you've read it
[31:55] that i'm not taking this
[31:57] from from the pope
[32:01] brother branham wrote this about the
[32:03] bride
[32:04] so he says how can one fathom it how can
[32:07] one understand it though we cannot do
[32:09] that we can accept it by faith for god
[32:11] hath spoken it we believe this
[32:15] i believe this is true and as we read
[32:18] these things and even through these
[32:19] portions of the message and the
[32:20] scriptures we've referred to this is a
[32:23] a grand picture this is a very beautiful
[32:26] description
[32:28] of a ministry of a bride of a church and
[32:30] we begin to
[32:31] formulate in our minds this image of
[32:33] something very great and something very
[32:35] grand
[32:36] and in some ways we could say that the
[32:38] way brother branham is describing the
[32:39] bride
[32:40] is exactly the way the catholic church
[32:42] describes herself
[32:43] and how she's tried to represent herself
[32:45] around the world where their temples are
[32:47] very ornate and their churches
[32:48] are very uh adorned with gold and great
[32:51] amenities and everything is
[32:53] is very flashy to the eyes and very uh
[32:55] striking to the flesh
[32:57] and so as we think about this great
[32:58] ministry and we think about these
[33:00] wonderful things that are being said
[33:01] in our minds we can create a very grand
[33:03] and beautiful picture
[33:05] of the bride's ministry but there's
[33:08] something that must happen
[33:09] first before she can fully prophesy
[33:13] again there's a process that she must be
[33:15] engaged in there's something that's
[33:17] happening
[33:17] before she comes to this full
[33:19] manifestation and there's something that
[33:21] john did before he's told thou must
[33:23] prophesy
[33:24] again before many peoples and nations
[33:26] and tongues and kings
[33:27] there's something that must take place
[33:29] first
[33:30] now to use a legal phrase and i don't
[33:32] know where i would find something like
[33:34] that but
[33:35] to use a legal phrase a conditioned
[33:37] precedent
[33:39] and so in contract law and many
[33:40] different agreements there is a
[33:41] conditioned precedent
[33:43] so that something must happen first
[33:45] before another thing transpires
[33:48] it's an event which must take place
[33:49] before a party to a contract
[33:51] must perform or do their part and so a
[33:54] contractor
[33:56] and a landowner can agree for the
[33:58] contractor to build a barn
[34:00] but the contract can say the contractor
[34:02] will build the barn
[34:03] once the land owner furnishes the
[34:05] materials or furnishes the wood
[34:07] and so the contractor's not obligated to
[34:09] build the barn
[34:10] until the landowner has delivered the
[34:12] materials and so delivery the materials
[34:15] would be a conditioned precedent he had
[34:16] to do his part
[34:17] before the next part is done and so it
[34:20] is
[34:20] an event which has to occur before the
[34:23] title or another right of some sort
[34:25] to property will actually be conveyed
[34:27] and the party receives
[34:28] title so something has to happen before
[34:32] something is received another way of
[34:34] saying is a condition
[34:35] precedent is an event or condition a
[34:37] state of affairs
[34:39] required before something else can occur
[34:42] and the way that i'm wanting to make
[34:44] this relevant is there is a conditioned
[34:47] precedent here in revelations chapter
[34:48] 10.
[34:49] we know verse 11 the bride will prophesy
[34:52] again she will have a ministry she'll be
[34:53] the very manifestation of jesus christ
[34:56] but there's something that transpires
[34:58] and is transpiring
[34:59] before that fully occurs
[35:02] it's not we just read revelations 10 11
[35:04] and say oh my we're going to we're going
[35:06] to prophesy again
[35:07] but we must be walking in the steps of
[35:08] the scripture it's not just whosoever
[35:11] calls upon the lord shall be saved but
[35:12] no
[35:13] how can one believe on him whom he has
[35:14] not heard and how can you hurt unless
[35:17] unless a man preach and how can a man
[35:18] preach unless he be sent so it's not
[35:20] just calling upon the name of the lord
[35:21] to be saved but it's god
[35:23] sending an ordained minister to preach
[35:26] jesus christ
[35:27] you hear jesus christ believe upon jesus
[35:29] christ and then call upon his name
[35:31] and those are the elements of salvation
[35:34] in believing in his name
[35:35] not just anybody who reads the scripture
[35:37] and says jesus is going to be saved
[35:39] but there's a process to it there's
[35:41] conditions precedent to it
[35:43] and so here's the condition proceeded to
[35:45] revelations 10 11
[35:46] it's in verses 9 and 10. and i went unto
[35:49] the angel and said unto him give
[35:51] me the little book and he said unto me
[35:54] take it
[35:54] and eat it up and see it's very bold of
[35:58] john
[35:58] to do this to say give me the little
[36:00] book
[36:01] but he was told to do it
[36:07] and he he had instinctive obedience to
[36:10] that message
[36:12] do it i'm going to do it go tell go to
[36:15] him who has the but go to the mighty
[36:17] angel
[36:18] and and and say give me this book and he
[36:20] says give me
[36:21] give me the little book he doesn't even
[36:23] say please
[36:24] just not may i please have the book he's
[36:27] just under this inspiration
[36:28] give me the little book and it's
[36:30] remarkable and i'm sure this has been
[36:32] ministered here before and perhaps i've
[36:34] even mentioned it myself
[36:35] this is one who in chapter five wasn't
[36:38] even worthy to even look at it
[36:40] let alone touch it i mean he wasn't
[36:43] allowed to look at it he couldn't even
[36:44] look
[36:45] sometimes you say look but don't touch
[36:47] this is don't look don't touch
[36:49] and yet now the one who wasn't worthy
[36:51] and no man was worthy to even look upon
[36:53] this book now all of a sudden
[36:55] a messenger tells him and is
[36:57] commissioned him to go and take it now
[36:59] something has happened
[37:00] what's happened he's heard the
[37:01] revelation of the seven thunders
[37:03] and that has now empowered him to be
[37:05] able
[37:06] to have a right to that book because he
[37:08] knows that that book is his
[37:10] and that book is him that he's a part of
[37:13] this
[37:14] and so he's now a commissioned told to
[37:16] take the book
[37:17] and the angel tells him to take it and
[37:19] eat it up
[37:21] and now who the one who is unworthy to
[37:23] look at it unworthy to touch it is now
[37:25] able to do that which would be the most
[37:26] intimate
[37:27] to actually take it and eat it it's very
[37:30] very dynamic things are transpiring and
[37:33] the angel says and it shall
[37:34] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[37:37] thy mouth sweet as honey
[37:39] and it says and i took the little book
[37:41] out of the angel's hand and ate it up
[37:43] so i ate all of it didn't leave anything
[37:45] behind i ate it up and it was
[37:47] in my mouth sweet as honey so he's
[37:50] he's it's exactly what the angel said it
[37:52] would be it's going to be sweet in your
[37:54] mouth and he says and as soon as i had
[37:56] eaten it so as he begins to take it into
[37:58] his mouth it's very sweet to him
[38:00] but he says as soon as i had eaten it
[38:02] now that i'm done chewing it now that
[38:03] it's no longer in my mouth as soon as i
[38:05] had eaten it my belly was bitter
[38:08] and this is what i'm wanting to focus on
[38:10] this very passage of scripture here in
[38:12] revelations
[38:13] 10 10. he eats it it's sweet in his
[38:15] mouth but then after he's eaten it it's
[38:17] in his belly
[38:18] as a bitterness and the only way that
[38:20] the bride
[38:21] can prophesy again is she takes the book
[38:24] and eats it
[38:26] it's the only way we're going to be able
[38:27] to have a voice the only way that we
[38:29] have a message
[38:29] the only way that we're going to be able
[38:31] to walk in these very things that we've
[38:32] read already
[38:33] where brother brown says she's the uh
[38:35] she is likened to pure gold and she's
[38:37] summed up
[38:37] all the manifested eternal wisdom and
[38:39] purpose of god before any of this can
[38:41] truly be so we have to first take in the
[38:44] book and eaten the book
[38:48] the bride has been granted the privilege
[38:51] to take the book and eat it
[38:53] and i and this is this is as individuals
[38:56] we're given this privilege and
[38:58] corporately we're given this privilege
[39:00] but you must as an individual be taking
[39:02] this book and eating it
[39:03] it's something that you can't just say
[39:05] wow brother chad and brother kyle the
[39:06] different ministers here brother ben
[39:08] they're taking that word and they're
[39:09] and they're feeding out and they're
[39:10] preaching it and you're just hearing it
[39:12] no you must be taking the book yourself
[39:14] and you must be feeding on it and you
[39:16] must be eating it so it's something done
[39:18] corporately as a body of the christ
[39:19] around the world but it's something that
[39:21] we must do
[39:22] individually
[39:26] and just a few statements to identify
[39:28] the bride's feast in this end time
[39:30] in the message seed is not heir with the
[39:32] shock he says neither will a christian
[39:34] eat on that dead akarians
[39:35] from old denominational doctrines and
[39:37] things they want the word of god fresh
[39:40] the promise of the hour god promised
[39:43] rabbits in the day of luther
[39:45] he promised other things in the days of
[39:47] others but now
[39:48] there's been an evolution to the diet
[39:51] and that's what happens even as a child
[39:52] develops there's an evolution and diet
[39:54] there's been a change in diet that
[39:56] rabbits in the days of luther he says he
[39:58] promised
[39:59] other things in days of others i wish he
[40:00] would have told us what they had in
[40:01] wesley's day and what they had in
[40:03] pentecost days but it was
[40:04] rabbits in the days of luther but now we
[40:06] know what we have now
[40:07] now he's promised a full square meal
[40:10] the full seven course menu for all
[40:14] the seven seals are opened open
[40:17] all seven seals are open and everything
[40:19] is ready for the word of god
[40:21] and now he make this next statement is
[40:23] very important to those who can receive
[40:26] and that's why to some they're not open
[40:28] because they're not the some who can
[40:30] receive
[40:31] but to those who can receive there's a
[40:33] full square mill full seven course menu
[40:35] for all seven seals are open can you
[40:38] receive it
[40:39] amen we can receive it we have a seven
[40:42] course menu the all
[40:43] seven seals are open to us and we're
[40:45] feeding on this meal that has been
[40:47] opened up to us those seals are christ
[40:49] christ are the seals that are open he's
[40:50] the one that opened those seals and
[40:52] that's the menu that we're feeding on
[40:55] and the message rising of the sun as we
[40:57] heard the sister sing the song a genuine
[41:00] quickened eagle lives by that and he
[41:02] raised up christ from the
[41:03] grave dwelling in you as has quickened
[41:05] your mortal body unto his presence you
[41:07] can recognize it
[41:08] you're no longer a scavenger you're an
[41:10] eagle
[41:12] you don't want the things of the world
[41:15] you're a son and daughter of god you're
[41:17] feasting at a fountain that the world
[41:19] knows nothing about
[41:22] this is a secret feast it's a feast in
[41:25] the presence of your enemies
[41:26] has prepared a table before me in the
[41:28] presence of my enemies
[41:30] he's prepared this seven course menu
[41:32] what has he done he's actually prepared
[41:34] a feast for you in the bride age while
[41:36] laodicea looks on
[41:37] [Applause]
[41:39] and in the presence of your enemies it's
[41:41] just out of reach
[41:43] they can't get to you but there you are
[41:45] feast and the very language of that
[41:46] scripture is remarkable he's prepared a
[41:48] table
[41:49] and i'm feasting in the presence of my
[41:50] enemies usually if you eat in front of
[41:52] an enemy you're eating in haste you're
[41:54] eating very quickly if you eat it all
[41:55] because you never know what one moment
[41:57] you may need to fight but now the bride
[41:58] is at such rest
[42:00] so hidden away in the secret of his
[42:02] tabernacle hid away in the secret of his
[42:04] presence
[42:05] and the secret of his pavilion from the
[42:07] strife of tongues and the pride of men
[42:08] that we can in the midst of trouble
[42:10] in the time of trouble with our enemies
[42:12] just right there in our presence we can
[42:14] feast at the king's table
[42:17] we can just rest why aren't you worried
[42:21] oh the king's giving me a meal why
[42:24] aren't you worried about what laodicea
[42:25] why aren't you worried about all these
[42:26] enemies gathering throw a hole should
[42:27] have camp against me
[42:28] oh not fear the war should rise against
[42:32] me and this will i be confident
[42:33] i'm sitting in the secret of his
[42:34] presence dining at the king's table
[42:37] feasting on a king's mill only fit for a
[42:40] queen
[42:40] [Applause]
[42:43] he said the world knows nothing about it
[42:44] you're drinking it the world knows
[42:46] nothing about
[42:47] you are eating hidden manna that the
[42:48] world never know nothing of it
[42:51] i like saying it just the way he said it
[42:52] never knowed nothing of it
[42:54] the world never knowed nothing of it for
[42:57] you are
[42:57] an eagle the world doesn't know about
[43:01] this feast
[43:03] full square meal full seven course menu
[43:04] all seven seals are open
[43:06] you're feasting on a fountain that the
[43:08] world knows nothing about you're eating
[43:09] hidden manna in the secret of his
[43:11] tabernacle
[43:13] he says an anointed one's at the end
[43:14] time the son of man is christ
[43:16] he is the one that you're feeding on
[43:18] you're not feeding on a man
[43:19] a man his words were fell and brother
[43:21] branham said i'm a man my words will
[43:23] fail
[43:23] so he's making a distinction he even
[43:25] says in one place can you get it
[43:26] separated now
[43:27] so you have a son of man and the son of
[43:29] man we're not feeding on william branham
[43:31] we're feeding on
[43:32] the son of man christ he says but you
[43:34] are feeding on the unfailing body word
[43:36] of the son of man
[43:38] that is what we're feeding on the
[43:40] unfailing body word
[43:42] of the son of man so it is a feast that
[43:44] we're we are
[43:45] engaged in it's a feast that we have
[43:47] been called to it's even
[43:49] there's it's so striking in scripture
[43:51] and in the message that we can see
[43:53] that in this time of a union this time
[43:55] of a wedding a united invisible union
[43:58] that the bride is feasting
[44:01] and so we're feasting now spiritually
[44:03] and then one day we're going to a
[44:04] wedding supper
[44:06] it's going to be a translation it's
[44:07] going to be a change of our body there's
[44:08] going to be a meeting in the air and
[44:09] there's going to be a wedding feast
[44:11] but right now we're feasting
[44:15] and if i could say this is i'm just
[44:18] building we're on a journey now
[44:20] and so at this point i i'm just wanting
[44:23] to walk together through things we
[44:24] understand things we know things that we
[44:26] believe
[44:28] but and so if we take this from the
[44:30] scripture out john took the book and ate
[44:32] it and he says i
[44:33] ate it up the bride's doing the same
[44:35] thing
[44:36] because he is those seals and we can see
[44:38] just the continuity with the message and
[44:39] the scripture
[44:40] and how brother branham brings this to
[44:42] us and in the mouth
[44:43] it's sweet as honey in the mouth that is
[44:47] it is enjoyable something to be desired
[44:49] something that's pleasing something that
[44:50] satisfies
[44:51] we could even make mention how that
[44:53] revelation to the believers stimulation
[44:56] is something that's pleasurable and as
[44:57] you take this message and you eat it
[44:59] and it and it's quicken to you and you
[45:01] have that privilege of hearing the voice
[45:03] the privilege of taking the word taking
[45:05] this unfailing body word of the son of
[45:06] man and you're eating
[45:07] there's a pleasure that you derive from
[45:09] the taste of it
[45:11] and then tasting it and it being
[45:12] quickened to you and you having the
[45:14] privilege of eating it and just think of
[45:15] the times when you're in a church
[45:16] service or you're reading your bible
[45:18] or you're listening to a message and now
[45:20] it stimulates you and it's exciting
[45:22] and you love it and it's enjoyable and
[45:24] you're like my this is fun
[45:26] and listen the world thinks you're crazy
[45:28] when you talk about how much you enjoy
[45:30] church and they're like and i enjoy
[45:33] church we got a great band we got a good
[45:35] light show and
[45:36] and the pastor he's just cool he
[45:37] preaches and flip-flops and
[45:39] and shorts and he's just down to earth
[45:41] man and today we're doing the avengers
[45:43] in the bible and and the bride you know
[45:45] she's the brides and the church is like
[45:47] an avenger and
[45:48] right the church has this superpower and
[45:50] that superpower and it's really neat
[45:52] it's
[45:52] seeing god in the movies is what we're
[45:54] doing and we really enjoyed church and
[45:56] you're going
[45:57] okay ours is totally different
[46:00] but i enjoy it even more than you enjoy
[46:02] what you got
[46:03] [Applause]
[46:04] i didn't go to the movies i went to
[46:05] church i didn't hear something from
[46:08] from a comic book i heard something from
[46:09] the word of god and i
[46:11] loved it and they say yeah
[46:15] our pastor just speaks for about 30
[46:16] minutes and ours 30 30 times 4.
[46:21] [Music]
[46:24] and we love it and we enjoy it and we
[46:26] can do it hour after hour
[46:29] and we look forward to it listen some of
[46:31] you can fellowship on this when you're
[46:32] in the world and you really got drunk or
[46:34] you got
[46:35] you got high you did something you just
[46:36] got strung out one night and you really
[46:38] just
[46:38] got really intoxicated you wake up the
[46:40] next morning you're hungover and you
[46:41] feel off he said i never want to do that
[46:42] again
[46:44] but you never feel that way after church
[46:47] the presence of god moves you're feast
[46:48] on the word of god you're like
[46:49] that was wonderful that was great so
[46:52] there's a there's something enjoyable
[46:54] about that aspect but there's another
[46:55] part
[46:56] of the eating there's another part of
[46:58] this condition precedent
[47:00] first it is in the mouth but it must
[47:02] also be in the belly
[47:04] and if you've eaten it properly that's
[47:06] where it'll end up
[47:07] you've taken it properly it ends up in
[47:09] the belly and i just about tasting
[47:12] something and swishing it around and
[47:13] spitting it out or just kind of
[47:14] you know just a little taste a little
[47:16] smell maybe just a little bite just to
[47:17] get the flavor but
[47:18] when you've taken it and eaten it all
[47:20] and you're taking the substance what's
[47:21] been delivered to you
[47:22] what's been ordained to you what's been
[47:23] put on your plate and we're told our
[47:25] whole lives to eat finish your plate
[47:26] finish your plate finish your plate and
[47:28] then when you do that as an adult
[47:29] you're a hog or you're a pig or
[47:30] something i was told it from
[47:32] two years on to finish my plate now i'm
[47:34] getting looked and brothers are handing
[47:36] me a knife you know
[47:37] what the bible says put a knife to the
[47:38] gluttonous one i'm just doing what i've
[47:41] been told for
[47:42] my whole childhood but you got to take
[47:44] all of it and eat it
[47:46] eat it up because it's got to be in the
[47:48] belly
[47:50] ezekiel chapter 3 verses 1 to 3 and
[47:52] there's so much more that can be mined
[47:54] from this but i want to make very quick
[47:55] references to these things
[47:56] in verse 1 of ezekiel 3 and we'll read
[47:59] to verse 3 moreover he said unto me son
[48:01] of man
[48:01] eat that thou findest eat this roll and
[48:04] go
[48:05] speak unto the house of israel can you
[48:07] see the the
[48:08] how the the continuity there and the
[48:10] same imagery of revelations chapter 10
[48:12] now being expressed to ezekiel the son
[48:14] of man he takes the scroll he takes the
[48:16] role he eats it then he speaks
[48:18] the bride is taken this sealed book
[48:20] that's been opened to her and
[48:21] when she eats it she's speaking he says
[48:23] so i opened my mouth and he caused me to
[48:25] eat the roll
[48:27] and he said unto me son of man cause thy
[48:29] belly to eat
[48:30] and fill thy bowels with this roll that
[48:32] i give thee don't just fill your mouth
[48:34] with it
[48:35] but eat enough to where it fills your
[48:36] belly and he says then did i
[48:39] eat and it was in my mouth as honey
[48:42] for sweetness so now the son of man
[48:45] ezekiel's having a similar experience
[48:46] where he's taking the role and the
[48:48] scroll he's taking it
[48:49] he's eating as he eats it he's to fill
[48:50] his belly with it fill thy bowels with
[48:52] this roll that i give unto you she says
[48:54] as i it was in my mouth
[48:55] it was sweet as honey to hear the word
[48:58] is sweet
[48:59] the eating of the word the tasting of
[49:00] the word is enjoyable the bible even
[49:02] speaks of those
[49:03] who've tasted of the word of god and
[49:04] they enjoy that they think they've
[49:06] tasted they can enjoy
[49:07] just the little bits and pieces they can
[49:09] enjoy the moments they can enjoy what
[49:11] they've tasted
[49:11] and listening to the word of god is
[49:13] exciting the revelation of the word of
[49:15] lord is stimulated taste it is wonderful
[49:18] but it's got to be in the belly jeremiah
[49:20] chapter 15
[49:21] verse 16 the words were found and i did
[49:23] eat them and thy word was unto me
[49:26] the joy and rejoicing of my heart isn't
[49:29] that a beautiful scripture
[49:31] thy word was unto me the joy and
[49:33] rejoicing of my heart thy words were
[49:35] found and i did eat them
[49:37] i was found of this message i was told
[49:39] to go take the book and i did eat them
[49:41] and thy words were under me
[49:42] a joy and a rejoice in my heart for i am
[49:45] called by thy name
[49:46] o lord of god of host lord god of host
[49:49] oh this is so beautiful to me because at
[49:51] the open of the seals you hear your name
[49:53] called
[49:53] [Applause]
[49:55] and even as it was said that to to the
[49:57] prophet you're going to go and anoint to
[49:59] say you're going to go anoint the new
[50:00] king
[50:01] he says and it'll be the one that i name
[50:03] and it was he didn't say
[50:04] david but he was identified he was
[50:07] brought forth a message called him out
[50:08] of the field he stood before the prophet
[50:10] and that was the naming of the king he
[50:13] was identified he was called forth
[50:15] and when this book was opened you were
[50:17] called forth you were named your name
[50:19] was called he says all thou has called
[50:21] me
[50:21] by my name and the word which was given
[50:24] to me i have eaten it it is a joy
[50:26] and a rejoicing of my heart can you
[50:28] identify yourself with jeremiah 15
[50:30] 16. why because eating the word is a
[50:34] rejoicing
[50:35] taste in the word is something that we
[50:37] enjoy that we love
[50:40] but the mouth isn't where the body
[50:41] receives the full benefit of what is
[50:43] eaten
[50:45] where you really get the what you need
[50:47] from what you're eating is in the
[50:48] digesting
[50:50] matthew chapter 15 verse 17 do not yet
[50:53] understand
[50:54] that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth
[50:56] goethe into the belly
[50:57] and is cast out into the drought jesus
[51:00] is actually referring to the body's
[51:01] ability to process things that are
[51:03] impure
[51:03] and to get rid of things that are not
[51:05] good but also assimilate and digest
[51:08] and take in nurturance and pass it down
[51:10] to the body those things which are good
[51:12] saying that in the natural process
[51:14] whatever you eat it goes in the mouth
[51:16] goes into the belly and this is the
[51:18] process wherein we're good
[51:19] the bible speaks if it was in my mouth
[51:20] sweet as honey but in my belly it was
[51:22] bitter
[51:22] this is the body's process of function
[51:26] of processing food
[51:27] and getting the nutrients out of it so
[51:29] you don't taste the word
[51:30] in your belly and you don't get pleasure
[51:34] in the digestion process
[51:36] in the natural it's it's quite the
[51:38] opposite we experience a lot of
[51:40] discomfort
[51:41] after we've enjoyed the tasting right
[51:45] it was great in our mouths and it was
[51:46] wonderful my bed tasted good my that was
[51:48] rich mal it was great and then at one
[51:50] point you go oh
[51:50] i ate too much oh that wasn't good
[51:54] shouldn't have done that shouldn't ate
[51:55] that last piece
[51:57] why because once it's there you're not
[51:58] enjoying it like you did when it was in
[52:00] your mouth
[52:03] but once it's in the belly that's where
[52:05] you start to get the benefit
[52:08] that's where you're going to process the
[52:10] nutrients from it that's where you begin
[52:11] to administer nourishment to the body
[52:13] and the way the whole digestion process
[52:15] works
[52:15] from that moment as it begins to take be
[52:17] broke down the body is an incredible
[52:20] it's not a natural process but one
[52:22] designed by god to take things from the
[52:24] food
[52:25] and use it to nourish the entire body
[52:28] and the ability to digest certain foods
[52:30] and process certain foods and receive
[52:32] the full benefit of food
[52:33] is a mark of maturity because you just
[52:36] don't give solid food to a baby once
[52:38] it's born
[52:39] there's actually great care that's given
[52:40] to the raising of a child where there's
[52:42] certain things you know
[52:43] the stomach can't handle that kind of it
[52:45] can't handle that kind of sweetness yet
[52:47] it can't handle that kind of milk yet
[52:48] it can't handle there's certain things
[52:50] that the body hasn't matured enough to
[52:51] be able to break down and process
[52:53] uh within the digestive system oh it can
[52:55] be great in the mouth
[52:57] i can still remember the first time with
[52:58] elliot he's our firstborn
[53:00] and he's like wow he really loves this
[53:01] whipped cream wow he really really likes
[53:03] his mom
[53:04] mom mom and all of a sudden it got to
[53:06] the belly and i was like nope not ready
[53:07] for that quite yet
[53:09] why because it hadn't matured and grown
[53:11] to the point where it could process the
[53:13] things that are contained in there and
[53:14] even those sugars and it was too soon
[53:16] they even said don't give honey to a
[53:17] baby but it's three days why
[53:18] because there's a there's not time yet
[53:20] it hasn't evolved to the place where it
[53:22] can process those things
[53:24] in first corinthians chapter three
[53:25] verses one to three says and i brethren
[53:27] could not speak unto
[53:28] you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal
[53:30] even as unto babes in christ
[53:32] so they're babes in christ they're
[53:34] children of christ he's not taking away
[53:36] their experience
[53:36] but he's acknowledging that there hasn't
[53:38] been the proper growth for him to be
[53:40] able to speak to him in a certain
[53:42] way so you speak to people according to
[53:44] their experience
[53:45] in a way that will nourish them in their
[53:48] present state
[53:49] but in a way that will cause them to
[53:50] grow into the next level
[53:53] so if you're properly feeding your baby
[53:54] they'll grow to be able to handle
[53:56] more solid foods more solid foods to
[53:58] eventually they're not eating baby food
[54:01] anymore they're eating the same table
[54:02] food you are
[54:03] just in different portions
[54:07] and so he says i have fed you with milk
[54:09] and not with meat
[54:10] for hitherto you were not able to bear
[54:12] it neither yet now are you able so this
[54:14] is quite a rebuke
[54:15] i've continued to give you milk as peter
[54:17] said his newborn babes desire the
[54:19] sincere milk of the word that you may
[54:21] grow thereby and growing by the milk
[54:23] you'll be able to take on and feast on
[54:26] more parts of the word of god
[54:28] it says i fed you with milk i really
[54:30] want to feed you with meat but i'm not
[54:31] you're not able to bear it not even now
[54:32] are you able to bear it for verse 3 for
[54:34] your yet carnal
[54:36] for whereas there is among you envying
[54:38] in strife and divisions and you're not
[54:40] are you not carnal and walk as men so
[54:43] their carnality was uh
[54:45] was to the place where paul was
[54:47] acknowledging they would not be able to
[54:48] properly digest the real meat of the
[54:50] word but they had to mature they had to
[54:53] grow and he's
[54:54] there's there's making a a point and
[54:56] connecting the ability
[54:57] and the impact of the word how it takes
[55:00] a person out of carnality out of indiana
[55:02] strife and divisions
[55:03] and and brings them to a place where
[55:04] they're feeding on the kind of word
[55:06] which is a mark of maturity and as they
[55:08] are eating properly it's causing them
[55:10] too mature if you only stay in milk
[55:13] you're always going to be carnal
[55:16] it's always going to be strife and
[55:18] divisions but if you want to begin to go
[55:20] further this start eating more of the
[55:21] word of god and not just enjoin it in
[55:23] your mouth but making sure your bowels
[55:25] are full of it
[55:27] it says in hebrews chapter 5 verses 10
[55:29] to 14. again i just want to remind you
[55:31] we're on a journey
[55:32] each one of these things we're just
[55:33] we're just passing by something and
[55:35] describing it to you
[55:36] as we pass by it just hoping that these
[55:38] different principles are building
[55:40] together to be a blessing to you
[55:42] and hebrews chapter 5 verses 10 to 14
[55:44] he's speaking of melchizedek called of
[55:46] god a high priest
[55:47] after the order of the melchizedek of
[55:49] whom we have many things to
[55:51] say and hard to be uttered seeing your
[55:53] dole of hearing
[55:55] so paul was saying i want to tell you
[55:56] more about who this melchizedek is but i
[55:58] can't
[55:59] because you're dull of hearing so he had
[56:02] more to preach about melchizedek
[56:04] and brother branham comes and picks up
[56:05] and says who is this melchizedek
[56:07] i knew there was a bride that was going
[56:08] to raise up in the end time with the
[56:10] maturity
[56:10] to take that message and eat it so he
[56:14] says you are
[56:15] verse 12 for when for the time you ought
[56:17] to be teachers
[56:18] so they should have matured to the place
[56:20] where they could teach and this is a
[56:21] very important principle
[56:23] as we continue later the feeding on the
[56:25] word of god should bring you to a place
[56:26] to where not only are you able to learn
[56:28] but you're able to teach
[56:30] i've heard and now i'm speaking i've
[56:32] heard the word of god and now i'm
[56:33] declaring out i've heard these things
[56:35] i've received these things i've
[56:36] processed these things i've eaten these
[56:38] things now i can express and manifest
[56:40] these things
[56:40] he says you should be teachers but now
[56:42] you need to be taught again
[56:43] which be the first principles of the
[56:45] oracles of god in hebrews chapter 6 he
[56:47] says let us go on unto perfection
[56:49] that's the teleotaste let us go on to
[56:51] the perfect door the perfect one he says
[56:53] we'll do this
[56:54] if god permits why do you say that
[56:56] because it was a dispensation
[56:58] it was a time it was prophecy and i
[57:00] believe in this hour god has permitted
[57:05] we don't need to lay again the
[57:06] foundation the foundations have been
[57:07] laid
[57:08] we've come to the perfect perfect one he
[57:10] says and are become
[57:12] you ought to be teachers but now you
[57:13] need to be taught again and you've
[57:15] become such as have need of milk and not
[57:17] of strong meat
[57:19] it says but for everyone that useth milk
[57:21] is unskillful in the word of
[57:22] righteousness so you're if you're only
[57:23] using milk then you haven't evolved to a
[57:26] greater skill in the word of
[57:27] righteousness
[57:28] for he is a babe now this is corrective
[57:30] but it's not destructive
[57:33] he's correcting them he's rebuking them
[57:35] but he's not completely destroying them
[57:36] saying they're not church they're not
[57:37] bribed they're not
[57:38] the right kind of materials you're
[57:39] saying you haven't matured you haven't
[57:41] grown
[57:41] it says but strong meat belonging to
[57:43] them that are full age
[57:45] even those who by reason of use have
[57:47] their senses exercised
[57:49] to discern both good and evil so it's
[57:52] not just a tasting but it's a taking and
[57:54] processing
[57:55] and assimilating and filling your bowels
[57:57] with it and your body deriving from this
[57:59] message
[58:00] the things that you need that you can
[58:01] grow and mature to be able to take more
[58:04] things and you don't choke on it
[58:05] [Applause]
[58:07] so that when something real heavy is
[58:09] preaching i'll go
[58:10] let's go back to the milk no you've
[58:12] taken what you need from the milk you've
[58:14] taken what you need from a more solid
[58:16] food
[58:16] you're taking things for this message
[58:18] and you're taking it deep say lord this
[58:20] is a meal that's been given to me
[58:21] lord bless this food may it be
[58:23] nourishment to my spiritual body
[58:25] and then you chew it i think my grandma
[58:27] used to say chew it 40 times
[58:29] i chew every bite 40 times and i'd look
[58:31] at her one two three four
[58:33] because i don't think she chewed it 40
[58:34] times she wanted me to chew mine 40
[58:36] times
[58:37] break it down chew it up make sure your
[58:39] body can digest it don't just try to
[58:41] take it and swallow it whole
[58:42] something may happen you may choke on
[58:44] but take it think on it
[58:45] pray on it chew on it break it down as
[58:47] it begins to those enzymes begin to be
[58:49] released and it's going to come into
[58:50] your belly and your body's going to get
[58:52] what it needs from it
[58:53] and then you can begin to eat more and
[58:54] more and more and more
[58:55] [Applause]
[58:57] strong meat belongs to them they're full
[58:58] age those who have by reason of use the
[59:01] use of the milk the use of the
[59:03] meat the use of the food that's been
[59:04] given have had their senses exercised
[59:07] they've matured and grown and now
[59:09] they're to a place where they can
[59:10] discern both good and evil
[59:11] and i believe that's the bride's calling
[59:13] today we shall return and judge we must
[59:16] return and discern
[59:17] and know righteousness from wickedness
[59:19] to be able to know
[59:20] and it says you sit among the
[59:21] congregation of gods we should be able
[59:23] to know what evil is and what good is be
[59:26] able to judge and discern
[59:27] that's the season we're living in not a
[59:29] season where the bride is
[59:30] just love everybody we just want to love
[59:33] everybody
[59:34] but having eyes wide open know how to
[59:36] love
[59:38] listen brother brahma said if any one
[59:40] individual reasons against one
[59:42] punctuation of god's word
[59:44] if an individual reasons against the
[59:46] punctuation of god's word
[59:47] that's your enemy but then the bible
[59:50] says love your enemies as yourself
[59:52] and a lot of us know enough about the
[59:54] message to know who our enemies are but
[59:56] we haven't eaten it enough to know how
[59:57] to love them
[1:00:00] and because we've only tasted it and
[1:00:02] known that that's against the word
[1:00:03] then we know they're an enemy and when
[1:00:05] the carnal way we hate them and we speak
[1:00:07] evil and we run them down
[1:00:08] and in the whole process christ is not
[1:00:12] glorified
[1:00:14] it's one thing to discern but another
[1:00:16] thing to have the right attitude
[1:00:20] and so the condition proceeding is not
[1:00:21] just a sweet taste in the mouth
[1:00:24] but it's a bitterness in the belly
[1:00:28] we've come to this place and we've
[1:00:29] arrived at this point
[1:00:32] this is where i want to come to this
[1:00:33] thought of bittersweet
[1:00:35] it's sweet to eat this message but if
[1:00:38] you're eating it right
[1:00:40] it gets bitter in your belly bitter
[1:00:42] means harsh it's harsh or piercing
[1:00:45] that's what the meaning of bitter it was
[1:00:46] bitter it's harsh in my boat it was
[1:00:47] piercing in my belly
[1:00:49] the belly even speaks of the womb
[1:00:53] we understand that even in this hour of
[1:00:54] the bride has been impregnated
[1:00:56] by the word of god there's something
[1:00:59] that's taking place in this union
[1:01:01] where she's been impregnated with the
[1:01:02] word it's the
[1:01:04] harshest of piercing and the belly even
[1:01:06] speaks of the stomach
[1:01:08] so this piercing and this harshness
[1:01:11] follows the eating
[1:01:14] this there's something that is uh
[1:01:16] difficult
[1:01:18] painful uneasy uncomfortable
[1:01:21] just as sometimes we eat things in the
[1:01:22] natural and it makes us uncomfortable
[1:01:25] and we can feel it in the digestion say
[1:01:26] well i really enjoyed eating it but now
[1:01:28] as it's being digested it's there where
[1:01:29] you get the benefit
[1:01:31] not when it was in your mouth listen i
[1:01:34] don't believe we should have any
[1:01:35] spiritual eating disorders
[1:01:39] you take what's been given to you you
[1:01:41] eat it you let your body process it
[1:01:43] you get the fatness out of it you need
[1:01:48] revelations chapter five part two
[1:01:50] brother branham preaches this he says in
[1:01:52] this sevenful book
[1:01:53] and i'm reading this just to set in the
[1:01:55] context of the message how brother
[1:01:56] branham identifies this bitter belly
[1:01:58] he says in this sevenful book of the
[1:02:00] sevenfold book of seven redemption plans
[1:02:03] has been brought to us thank the lord
[1:02:06] and that's what this book holds
[1:02:08] he says now we're going to get over the
[1:02:09] 10th chapter where this mighty angel
[1:02:10] proclaims
[1:02:11] something and he had a little book that
[1:02:13] john had to eat
[1:02:14] and when he did he got it into his belly
[1:02:17] and it was bitter
[1:02:18] but in his lips it was sweet and as far
[1:02:20] as i've come across as the only place
[1:02:22] that brother branham amplifies this
[1:02:23] he says but in his lips it was sweet
[1:02:25] when you have to digest it then it gets
[1:02:28] bitter
[1:02:30] when you're eating it it's great it's
[1:02:32] wonderful
[1:02:33] even here when we eat on it it's great
[1:02:35] we're with family this is a family meal
[1:02:37] we're all friends here none of us are
[1:02:39] eating with a fork in one hand and a
[1:02:41] sword in the other
[1:02:42] put our swords down we're eating we're
[1:02:44] comfortable we're all fellowshipping
[1:02:45] together
[1:02:46] but he says when you begin to digest it
[1:02:49] if i could get ahead of myself when you
[1:02:50] begin to process it
[1:02:51] when you begin to apply it when you
[1:02:54] begin to assimilate it when you begin to
[1:02:56] express it when it begins to make a
[1:02:57] difference
[1:02:58] not when you're just saying amen to it
[1:02:59] but when you're applying it when you're
[1:03:01] living it when you're making the hard
[1:03:02] choices
[1:03:03] when you're sacrificing as a result of
[1:03:05] it because when you begin to digest it
[1:03:07] it gets bitter jesus shout amen here
[1:03:11] and agree with it but when you live it
[1:03:13] that's when it gets difficult
[1:03:16] he says everybody's against you
[1:03:20] everybody's telling you you're a holy
[1:03:22] roller and what that term's not really
[1:03:24] used anymore unless you're reading the
[1:03:25] message
[1:03:26] anybody been called a holy roller
[1:03:27] recently i mean when's the last time
[1:03:29] that's happened
[1:03:31] and he says you're this that or the
[1:03:34] other
[1:03:36] he says you're off your head this is
[1:03:38] what they're saying
[1:03:40] so it's it's not just you're a holy
[1:03:42] roller
[1:03:43] you're but it's you're this you're that
[1:03:44] this the other he says you're off your
[1:03:46] head he says so it's hard to digest it
[1:03:50] it's something that follows the eating
[1:03:52] something begins to take place in a
[1:03:54] person's life when they're really eating
[1:03:55] the book
[1:03:56] when they're really taking this message
[1:03:57] and assimilating and chewing it and
[1:04:00] digesting and feeling their bowels full
[1:04:01] of that role
[1:04:02] and they're causing the belly to eat
[1:04:04] then something else happens is
[1:04:05] it gets in the belly and it's bitter
[1:04:06] when you have to digest it
[1:04:09] then things turn against you so it's
[1:04:11] hard to digest it but when you're
[1:04:12] testifying of his glory it's sweet in
[1:04:14] your lips that's all
[1:04:15] and when you stand up in a meeting and
[1:04:16] say glory to god hallelujah he says
[1:04:18] that's when it's sweet when you're in a
[1:04:20] medium testament says oh when you're
[1:04:22] going through that great siege
[1:04:24] it's hard there's a siege there's a
[1:04:27] squeeze there's a pressing
[1:04:28] he says it's hard but then when you're
[1:04:30] out of that great seed you can testify
[1:04:32] of it
[1:04:33] then it's sweet in the lips he says
[1:04:35] that's this book
[1:04:37] of redemption this book of redemption is
[1:04:40] bittersweet
[1:04:42] it's a double-edged sword it's a
[1:04:45] bittersweet book
[1:04:47] that's this book of redemption
[1:04:50] and this i want to share this because
[1:04:53] i'm going to begin to
[1:04:55] go further in this journey and uh and
[1:04:59] focus on some maybe specific aspects of
[1:05:02] this bitterness
[1:05:04] but the bitter belly represents the pain
[1:05:06] and difficulty that comes in taking the
[1:05:07] word
[1:05:09] the painful side of eating all of the
[1:05:11] open book
[1:05:13] and we must eat the book
[1:05:16] as i've already mentioned before eating
[1:05:17] the book is enjoyable and the first
[1:05:20] first page of my notes as i had the
[1:05:21] different scriptures and quotes laid out
[1:05:23] that that part as we read about the
[1:05:25] bride being the the manifested eternal
[1:05:27] wisdom and purpose of god and liking the
[1:05:29] pure gold and her attributes are his
[1:05:31] attributes and it's the
[1:05:32] same flesh and blood the same ministry
[1:05:34] the full measure the pride the same as
[1:05:36] the group
[1:05:36] all those things are glorious to read
[1:05:39] it's glorious on paper but it never
[1:05:43] feels the same when it's in your flesh
[1:05:45] it's one thing when you read that it's
[1:05:47] going to be his body be his voice
[1:05:48] perform his works but when you do
[1:05:50] it's a lot different than what you
[1:05:51] thought it would be
[1:05:52] [Music]
[1:05:54] we must take the book and eat it and
[1:05:56] eating's enjoyable but we must
[1:05:57] experience the bitterness as well
[1:06:00] and if you're not experiencing
[1:06:01] bitterness perhaps you're not actually
[1:06:02] taking the book and eating
[1:06:04] it and the bitter belly is the hard part
[1:06:08] but it's just as necessary as the sweet
[1:06:10] part if we eat all of it it's gonna
[1:06:12] there's gonna be a bitterness but it's
[1:06:15] only
[1:06:16] after the belly is bitter that we can
[1:06:18] fully walk in revelations 10 11.
[1:06:21] he didn't say as i ate it and it was
[1:06:22] sweet in my mouth and while i had the
[1:06:24] sweetness in my mouth
[1:06:25] and i was still just there in a very
[1:06:27] sweet flavor and something very
[1:06:29] enjoyable it wasn't then that he said
[1:06:30] prophesy again
[1:06:31] but it was after it made his belly
[1:06:33] bitter he said thou must prophesy again
[1:06:35] so it wasn't the sweetness that
[1:06:37] qualified him to prophesy but it was a
[1:06:39] bitterness in his belly that followed
[1:06:41] the sweetness that made him qualified
[1:06:43] to prophesy
[1:06:46] in order to prophesy again and to be his
[1:06:48] voice we must have bitter bellies
[1:06:51] for the bride's ministry to be effective
[1:06:53] the bride has to have this bittersweet
[1:06:55] experience
[1:06:56] why it's a bittersweet mystery it's a
[1:06:59] bittersweet sweet ministry that follows
[1:07:01] the mystery
[1:07:01] it's a bittersweet experience for the
[1:07:03] bride
[1:07:05] and this is where i might seem to be
[1:07:07] getting very specific here but i just
[1:07:08] feel so directed to this channel
[1:07:11] bitterness is meant to produce a
[1:07:12] humility and a meekness
[1:07:15] if this message was only ever sweet we
[1:07:18] wouldn't be healthy
[1:07:21] if it was only always just the things we
[1:07:23] love to taste
[1:07:24] the things we love to we love to hear if
[1:07:26] it didn't have a difficult part if it
[1:07:28] didn't have a hard part if it didn't
[1:07:29] have a business we would never be
[1:07:31] healthy
[1:07:32] just tell your kids eat what you like
[1:07:33] see how healthy they turn out
[1:07:36] just eat what you well i like the
[1:07:37] desserts well that's fine just make sure
[1:07:39] you get enough calories
[1:07:42] we just need to have so many calories a
[1:07:43] day divide those up among the meals we
[1:07:45] eat and you can eat whatever you want
[1:07:47] where they find that it's just not
[1:07:48] calories there's bad calories and
[1:07:49] there's good calories
[1:07:52] and if you could take that type and
[1:07:53] begin to try to use it in a particular
[1:07:55] way to understand what i'm referring to
[1:07:57] here
[1:07:57] it's not just the sweet that we need
[1:07:58] it's the bitter we need in order to be
[1:08:00] healthy
[1:08:02] we've got to take the the hard part
[1:08:04] bitterness is meant to produce
[1:08:05] a humility and a meatness that is
[1:08:07] required to fully walk in our calling
[1:08:09] and to be able to manifest his power
[1:08:12] if it was only sweetness we could never
[1:08:13] accurately portray his power
[1:08:15] it was always just good if there's
[1:08:17] always a pleasure in the mouth we can
[1:08:18] never accurately portray christ
[1:08:20] because it wasn't always sweet to him
[1:08:23] and if we're going to be christ like we
[1:08:25] must also experience
[1:08:26] the bitterness of christ
[1:08:27] [Applause]
[1:08:31] bittersweet the very word bittersweet
[1:08:32] means pleasure accompanied by suffering
[1:08:37] it's a blessing with the consequence
[1:08:40] that's something that it's there's good
[1:08:42] side to it like a double each other
[1:08:43] there's good to it there's a bad
[1:08:44] a negative to it there's two sides and
[1:08:47] as john is told to take the book and eat
[1:08:49] it there's a sweetness to it but there's
[1:08:50] a bitterness to it
[1:08:52] it's bittersweet brother brown when he's
[1:08:55] preaching the seventh seal and i just
[1:08:56] want to use this as an example to you
[1:08:58] of what it means to be something
[1:08:59] bittersweet he says now when that gets
[1:09:01] on tape he's preaching the seventh seal
[1:09:02] when what he said gets on tape which it
[1:09:05] is that it's probably gonna send
[1:09:08] that it probably send ten thousand of my
[1:09:10] friends away from me
[1:09:12] are you talking about bittersweet
[1:09:15] the bitter it was gonna drive ten
[1:09:17] thousands of his friends away from him
[1:09:18] but then draw a bride to christ
[1:09:22] can we not testify to that yeah brother
[1:09:24] branham lost tens of thousands of
[1:09:25] friends
[1:09:25] but he brought a bride to christ i know
[1:09:28] when i do this
[1:09:29] there's going to be tens of thousands
[1:09:30] that leave me but i've got to make the
[1:09:33] introduction
[1:09:34] of the church to her bridegroom i've got
[1:09:36] it it's going to cause a lot of people
[1:09:37] to fall away
[1:09:38] but i've got to make the introduction
[1:09:40] this introduction was sweet but there
[1:09:42] was a bitter cost to it
[1:09:46] says they're going to say brother iran's
[1:09:47] trying to put himself make himself a
[1:09:49] servant or a prophet or something before
[1:09:51] god he says let me tell you my brethren
[1:09:52] that is an heir
[1:09:53] i'm only telling you what i've seen and
[1:09:55] what has been told to me
[1:09:57] now you do whatever you want to
[1:10:01] thank god for his faithfulness just tell
[1:10:04] us what he saw tell us what he was told
[1:10:06] told to say why because the mystery of
[1:10:09] revelations 10
[1:10:10] when john is told to go to him and take
[1:10:12] the book the mystery is that there is a
[1:10:13] prophet that would be there
[1:10:14] to take that book and hand it to the
[1:10:16] bride
[1:10:18] to make the introduction that we could
[1:10:20] we could take this message
[1:10:21] and feed on jesus christ
[1:10:27] so bittersweet there's a sweet side in
[1:10:30] the bitter side
[1:10:32] there's a pleasure and there's a pain
[1:10:36] but this bitterness has a purpose second
[1:10:39] corinthians chapter 12 verses 7 to 9.
[1:10:44] i think we're just just moving along
[1:10:46] maybe right on schedule here
[1:10:50] listen the few that i come in contact
[1:10:52] with are all telling me preach
[1:10:53] as long as you want you can go three
[1:10:55] hours and i realize it's not a majority
[1:10:58] and we're not going to vote it's not
[1:11:00] going to be democratic but the
[1:11:02] virtually everyone i come in contact
[1:11:04] with wants me to preach long
[1:11:06] and since i come in contact with them i
[1:11:07] don't want to disappoint them i haven't
[1:11:09] seen you yet so
[1:11:10] the chance i could get away with it
[1:11:15] and i believe his brother chad who
[1:11:16] prayed may he just take his time be
[1:11:18] comfortable
[1:11:19] and if he didn't do that over the pulpit
[1:11:20] he did it back there so
[1:11:23] god answers prayer i'm just taking my
[1:11:26] time i'm comfortable today
[1:11:27] but it's 12 o'clock the clock struck 12.
[1:11:35] i'm not saying it second corinthians
[1:11:38] chapter 12.
[1:11:40] verses 7 to 9. he said lest i should be
[1:11:42] exalted above measure
[1:11:45] now think of this this is the bitterness
[1:11:46] we're talking about this bittersweet
[1:11:48] lest i be exalted above measure through
[1:11:50] the abundance of the revelations
[1:11:52] so paul had an abundance of revelations
[1:11:54] those things were sweet to him those
[1:11:55] things were meek to him
[1:11:57] and he's actually saying i could be
[1:11:58] exalted by them
[1:12:00] so unless i would be exalted above
[1:12:01] measure through all these sweet
[1:12:03] wonderful revelations i received
[1:12:04] there was given to me a thorn in the
[1:12:06] flesh the messenger of satan to buff at
[1:12:08] me
[1:12:09] lest i should be exalted above measure
[1:12:12] and so this is a bittersweet experience
[1:12:14] he's receiving great revelations but at
[1:12:16] the same time there's a great suffering
[1:12:17] that's coming to him
[1:12:19] to keep him in balance but the the
[1:12:21] revelation alone
[1:12:23] wasn't going to be what god would use to
[1:12:24] make him mighty and powerful
[1:12:26] god was also going to use the suffering
[1:12:28] god was also going to use the thorn
[1:12:30] because he says and i sought the lord
[1:12:32] this thing i besought the lord thrice
[1:12:34] that it might depart from me
[1:12:35] and he said unto me my grace is
[1:12:37] sufficient for thee
[1:12:39] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:12:41] weakness
[1:12:42] most gladly therefore i rather will i
[1:12:45] rather glory in my infirmities
[1:12:47] that the power of christ may rest upon
[1:12:49] me
[1:12:50] the power of christ would not merely
[1:12:52] rest upon him through the sweetness of
[1:12:54] revelation
[1:12:55] but through the bitterness of suffering
[1:12:58] since my grace is sufficient for thee my
[1:13:00] strength is made perfect in weakness not
[1:13:02] sweetness
[1:13:03] it was going to be through the
[1:13:04] bitterness through the weakness to the
[1:13:06] suffering through the trial
[1:13:07] through the hardship that the sweetness
[1:13:09] would really have a meaning to him
[1:13:13] i sought the lord to deliver me i sought
[1:13:15] him and asked him to help me
[1:13:17] he says my grace is sufficient because
[1:13:20] in that
[1:13:20] in that weakness in that pain and in
[1:13:23] that bitterness
[1:13:24] my strength is made perfect i could
[1:13:26] never use you if your mouth was always
[1:13:28] sweet
[1:13:29] i could never use you if you were always
[1:13:31] just sitting in that good
[1:13:33] i can only use you once it's bitter in
[1:13:35] your belly i can only use you once it's
[1:13:37] really
[1:13:38] dropped to the place where it means
[1:13:39] something that's when i can use you
[1:13:41] that's when my per my strength is made
[1:13:44] perfect
[1:13:46] so please allow me to mention this
[1:13:50] that bitterness is not referring to a
[1:13:52] harsh
[1:13:54] or negative uh disposition
[1:13:57] no i've tasted the word and it's so
[1:13:59] sweet but now it's just
[1:14:00] it's made me bitter it's made me sour
[1:14:04] it's made me crabby it's made me mean
[1:14:09] well because that's what the bible says
[1:14:10] the bible says i took the book and
[1:14:12] and it was bitter in my belly but that
[1:14:14] doesn't mean john had a bitter face
[1:14:16] you know when someone's eating something
[1:14:18] drink something bitter eating something
[1:14:19] bitter like
[1:14:21] and some of us walk around with a bitter
[1:14:23] look on our face
[1:14:26] cantankerous and critical and edgy but
[1:14:29] that's not what bitterness is talking
[1:14:30] about
[1:14:31] why are you so bitter i've taken the
[1:14:33] book and i've eaten it
[1:14:35] and i hate all the pentecostals and i
[1:14:37] hate all the methodists
[1:14:39] wrong book buddy
[1:14:42] you haven't eaten this book
[1:14:47] bitterness that's referred to as the
[1:14:49] bitterness of suffering
[1:14:52] the bitterness of hardship that's meant
[1:14:54] to produce a humility
[1:14:57] it is the loss due to obedience that's
[1:15:00] what the bitterness is
[1:15:01] it's the pain resulting from following
[1:15:03] truth it's the price
[1:15:05] for embracing this message that's the
[1:15:07] bitterness
[1:15:08] it's not a bad attitude that follows
[1:15:10] it's not a bitterness that we can see in
[1:15:11] the scripture that's evil and that's
[1:15:12] wrong and a root of business but rather
[1:15:14] it's referring to a suffering a
[1:15:16] bitterness of suffering
[1:15:17] it's the difficult in tribulation
[1:15:21] that comes from doing what is right
[1:15:25] when i say this ten thousands of my
[1:15:27] friends will leave me
[1:15:28] that's the bitterness he didn't say oh
[1:15:30] i'm so excited to get this tape out
[1:15:32] because it's finally gonna answer all
[1:15:34] the critics questions
[1:15:35] i'm so glad that i could finally preach
[1:15:37] the seventh seal and i can
[1:15:38] kind of explain the tent vision a little
[1:15:40] bit and i can refer to these things that
[1:15:41] happened at sabino kin
[1:15:42] i'm so glad that i can do that because
[1:15:44] now everyone will understand i'm not a
[1:15:46] neurotic i'm not crazy i was sent for
[1:15:48] this purpose and brother man was like
[1:15:49] see
[1:15:49] i told you this is it he knew that this
[1:15:52] would be the the nail
[1:15:53] in their their unbelief the coffin of
[1:15:55] their own he knew this would seal it he
[1:15:57] knew this would be what
[1:15:58] made people think he was crazy i was
[1:16:01] bittersweet
[1:16:04] the bitterness in our belly is a result
[1:16:06] of this word
[1:16:07] and it's a key to our power
[1:16:10] because we must experience this part of
[1:16:12] it
[1:16:14] the bitterness in our bellies are you
[1:16:16] doing okay
[1:16:17] this far i know maybe it's it's getting
[1:16:19] long and it's dragging a little bit
[1:16:21] um and i and but i know that most of you
[1:16:25] are accustomed to teaching ministries
[1:16:27] and just just word upon word and those
[1:16:29] things
[1:16:30] so if i don't move around a lot um and
[1:16:32] maybe don't get excited just the right
[1:16:34] way
[1:16:35] i i apologize do i have permission to
[1:16:38] wake you up if you fall asleep
[1:16:39] all right got one here who's agreed
[1:16:41] anybody else people immediately start
[1:16:43] yawning too whenever you say that
[1:16:45] you know i can make you yawn
[1:16:50] just by doing just by yarn i can make
[1:16:52] you yawn and you know they say
[1:16:53] narcissist
[1:16:55] don't have the ability to do empathetic
[1:17:00] yawning
[1:17:02] just just checking
[1:17:06] you all once you're gonna start doing
[1:17:07] fake yawns whenever someone yawns now
[1:17:10] should i should i am i'm a narcissist
[1:17:16] brother bram says in the message how can
[1:17:18] i overcome he says jesus
[1:17:20] told us how to do it how to overcome he
[1:17:22] told us how to do it
[1:17:23] he overcome overcome means to stand at
[1:17:26] the test
[1:17:28] you have to stand a test you don't have
[1:17:30] to do it
[1:17:31] and i was in the meetings here recently
[1:17:33] when brother danny steeman was preaching
[1:17:35] and he mentioned how the bride's gonna
[1:17:36] have to be tested she have to stand the
[1:17:38] test
[1:17:38] and he told them he says that doesn't
[1:17:39] mean you lose your job
[1:17:41] that's not the test that doesn't mean
[1:17:44] when
[1:17:45] you can't make your rent payment he says
[1:17:46] the whole world suffers that test
[1:17:48] but the test is being tested by the word
[1:17:51] that's the test
[1:17:52] he says to stand the test he said that's
[1:17:54] right like all the old saints did jesus
[1:17:56] did amidst all of his enemies
[1:17:58] he stood the test everything he was
[1:18:00] tested against he stood
[1:18:01] it and i'm going to skip a little bit
[1:18:03] because i think this is very relevant to
[1:18:04] us in this end time because there will
[1:18:05] be a bride that places death under her
[1:18:07] feet
[1:18:08] because he'll bruise satan under your
[1:18:10] feet shortly the last enemy that's to be
[1:18:12] defeated is death there will be a bride
[1:18:13] who will not taste death he says in the
[1:18:15] presence of death he defeated it
[1:18:16] he overcome death in the presence of
[1:18:18] hell he defeated hell and overcome hell
[1:18:20] yes in the presence of the grave he
[1:18:22] overcame the grave
[1:18:23] why how how did he do it
[1:18:27] all by the word
[1:18:30] and humility
[1:18:35] all by the word and humility this is
[1:18:38] very important for us to catch that it
[1:18:39] was
[1:18:40] i i listen i i say all the time i'm a
[1:18:41] word only junkie i'm the word only i
[1:18:43] believe that
[1:18:44] i believe the word only but the word
[1:18:46] only isn't licensed to not have the
[1:18:47] nature of the word
[1:18:49] and the atmosphere of the word and to
[1:18:51] take all that the word covers
[1:18:52] because the word covers our spirits as
[1:18:54] much as it does our souls
[1:18:57] as much as the word applies to physical
[1:18:58] healing and healing of the soul
[1:19:00] it applies to our mental attitudes and
[1:19:02] our emotions
[1:19:03] and so he says it's all by the word and
[1:19:05] humility oh my
[1:19:06] there's the real man there's the one to
[1:19:09] make your example
[1:19:10] he defeated everything overcome it
[1:19:13] how did he overcome it by the word and
[1:19:16] humility
[1:19:16] the word could have never worked through
[1:19:18] arrogance the word could have never
[1:19:20] worked through carnality it was by the
[1:19:22] word
[1:19:23] in humility that he defeated death he's
[1:19:26] the one to make your example
[1:19:27] if you are going to defeat death we have
[1:19:29] the word but we must also have humility
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:34] he says overcome how by taking the word
[1:19:36] the promise
[1:19:37] in humility humbly walking
[1:19:42] that's the bitter part if you had a
[1:19:45] perfect word
[1:19:47] that was perfectly vindicated you had
[1:19:50] the
[1:19:51] the perfect word of god you had thus
[1:19:53] saith the lord
[1:19:54] you you were the very you were pure gold
[1:19:56] and you had all these things we're
[1:19:58] talking about
[1:19:58] wouldn't that create a certain
[1:20:01] attitude that you should probably
[1:20:04] conduct yourself in such a way
[1:20:06] for when you go into a restaurant table
[1:20:09] for ten please
[1:20:12] a weight sorry you don't obviously you
[1:20:15] don't
[1:20:16] you don't know who i am i'm bride
[1:20:21] yeah pure gold tell that party to move
[1:20:23] over there
[1:20:24] tell them to hurry up that's not the way
[1:20:26] it works
[1:20:28] it's like that story one time a guy was
[1:20:30] there was a flight that got cancelled
[1:20:33] and uh he was there was a long line to
[1:20:35] get their tickets changed and he just
[1:20:36] butted right up to the line he says
[1:20:38] i need my ticket change i need my ticket
[1:20:39] change right now and i said sir you're
[1:20:41] going to have to wait your time in line
[1:20:42] with the rest of the people she says
[1:20:44] ma'am do you know who i am and so she
[1:20:46] got on the intercom and she said
[1:20:47] attention those at gate 12 tension those
[1:20:49] at gate 12
[1:20:50] there's a gentleman at the front desk
[1:20:51] who forgot who he is
[1:20:55] [Applause]
[1:20:57] and if you have that kind of attitude
[1:20:59] you forgot who you were
[1:21:00] [Applause]
[1:21:02] he says in humility humbly walking we
[1:21:05] have the perfect word
[1:21:07] but we must have the right attitude and
[1:21:09] humility in light of the word
[1:21:10] we can't hold truth and unrighteousness
[1:21:12] and i think it can be effective
[1:21:15] brother graham said in harvest time he
[1:21:16] will judge the church by their attitude
[1:21:18] towards christ
[1:21:19] who is the word so attitude is important
[1:21:23] the kind of attitude that we have not
[1:21:24] only is our attitude towards the word
[1:21:26] but it's our attitude with the word
[1:21:27] brethren makes a statement i wonder if
[1:21:29] we are sufficiently impressed with the
[1:21:31] word in our midst
[1:21:32] has it impressed us enough to where
[1:21:33] we're heavy with it has it laid itself
[1:21:36] upon us where we feel burdened by
[1:21:37] how are we sufficiently impressed where
[1:21:39] we're not stuffed shirt but we're
[1:21:41] brought low and it's a heaviness to it
[1:21:43] and it's a way and we recognize
[1:21:44] how heavy it is we recognize how viable
[1:21:46] it is we recognize how precious is
[1:21:49] it's not a light word that just kind of
[1:21:50] lifts us up and makes us
[1:21:52] all sweet and arrogant but rather it's
[1:21:54] something that humbles us
[1:21:56] are we sufficiently impressed with the
[1:21:58] word that's in our midst listen we've
[1:21:59] had our ears tickled long enough
[1:22:01] it's time for our bellies to get bitter
[1:22:03] [Applause]
[1:22:07] and we'll emphasize this in the
[1:22:08] afternoon psalm in hebrews chapter 7
[1:22:10] part 1 he says your attitude towards
[1:22:12] christ
[1:22:12] will make a great impression on what
[1:22:14] your children will be
[1:22:16] not whether or not you've received this
[1:22:18] message believe this message but the
[1:22:19] attitude with which you carry it
[1:22:22] the way you conduct yourself with it
[1:22:23] your life that you live before your
[1:22:24] family
[1:22:25] will make an impression on what your
[1:22:27] children will be
[1:22:29] we have the word but it's the humility
[1:22:31] with the word that's going to make a
[1:22:32] difference in our homes
[1:22:34] we can't just with arrogance to take the
[1:22:36] token and beat our children over the
[1:22:37] head with the token
[1:22:38] thinking it's going to make the
[1:22:39] difference it's by the word and humility
[1:22:42] and the attitude speaks of disposition
[1:22:44] it speaks of atmosphere
[1:22:45] it speaks of even this humility of
[1:22:46] christ the sweet reasonableness of
[1:22:48] christ who took the authority he had as
[1:22:50] a son
[1:22:51] who took the knowledge that he came
[1:22:52] direct from god and he conducted himself
[1:22:55] which was very unassuming
[1:22:59] bill abraham says in the message god had
[1:23:01] explained he says i'd rather be wrong in
[1:23:02] my doctrine and right in my heart than
[1:23:04] to be right in my doctrine and wrong in
[1:23:06] my heart
[1:23:08] i would rather be wrong in my doctrine
[1:23:10] and write in my heart now i'm just going
[1:23:12] to admit for somebody like me
[1:23:14] that gets me
[1:23:18] because i don't think doctrine's a dirty
[1:23:19] word
[1:23:21] i believe in doctrine i believe it's in
[1:23:24] scripture it's doctrine if it's in the
[1:23:25] message it's doctrine doctrine is
[1:23:27] teaching
[1:23:28] my doctrine shall fall forth as reign
[1:23:30] and this where he was teaching says
[1:23:31] where he was teaching there was power
[1:23:33] there to heal them all it's the word
[1:23:34] that comes from doctrine he was just
[1:23:35] teaching and i believe in doctor i think
[1:23:37] it's all doctrine
[1:23:38] i don't like false doctrine but we can
[1:23:41] sometimes just
[1:23:42] wait for me i think there's this maybe a
[1:23:44] knee-jerk reaction sometimes doctrine oh
[1:23:45] doctrine's bad no doctrine's not bad you
[1:23:47] have to have
[1:23:48] doctrine so this is a balance to me
[1:23:50] because he says i'd rather be wrong in
[1:23:52] my doctrine and right in my heart
[1:23:54] so we cannot take doctrine alone and
[1:23:57] elevate it above the heart that as long
[1:23:59] as the doctrine is right we're okay he
[1:24:00] says i would rather be wrong in my
[1:24:02] doctrine in write my heart than to be
[1:24:04] right in my doctrine and wrong in my
[1:24:06] heart
[1:24:06] this is the prophet who's given us his
[1:24:08] rathers and he said i'd rather be wrong
[1:24:10] in my
[1:24:11] doctrine and right in my heart and this
[1:24:14] is very corrective to those of us who
[1:24:16] who are stickers about teaching and who
[1:24:17] love doctrine and who thinks that we
[1:24:19] should be
[1:24:20] rightly dividing the word of god and
[1:24:21] really wants to lift up and uphold
[1:24:23] doctrine but you cannot let that
[1:24:25] exercise create in you the wrong kind of
[1:24:28] attitude
[1:24:30] because there's three scenarios the
[1:24:32] right doctrine and the wrong heart
[1:24:34] so you could have the right doctrine and
[1:24:36] wrong heart or you could have the wrong
[1:24:37] doctrine in the right heart
[1:24:39] so in both of those scenarios you're
[1:24:40] wrong you're either wrong in your
[1:24:41] doctrine you're wrong in your heart
[1:24:43] the third scenario is to be right in
[1:24:44] your doctrine and right in your heart
[1:24:45] [Applause]
[1:24:46] and what brother branham said is not
[1:24:48] giving a preference among
[1:24:50] three conditions but a pr preference
[1:24:52] among two conditions
[1:24:53] because which condition would be most
[1:24:54] preferred a right wrong or wrong right
[1:24:57] or right right right or right right
[1:25:01] right right
[1:25:03] [Applause]
[1:25:04] that's what we would prefer we're not
[1:25:06] reading so i'd rather be wrong in my
[1:25:08] doctrine and right in my heart so you
[1:25:09] don't want to be writing doctrine
[1:25:11] well brother graham said he'd rather be
[1:25:12] wrong in his doctrine but at least i'm
[1:25:13] right in my heart well that doesn't even
[1:25:15] seem to be like the right heart
[1:25:17] because now you have the wrong attitude
[1:25:18] towards the right doctor
[1:25:21] and so what would be better to have the
[1:25:22] right doctrine and the right heart
[1:25:24] that's what would be preferred to say i
[1:25:27] don't care about doctor i just want to
[1:25:28] be right in my heart that's not the
[1:25:29] right attitude
[1:25:31] and neither is i don't care about my
[1:25:33] attitude because i got the right
[1:25:34] doctrine
[1:25:36] to have the kind of attitude where we
[1:25:37] get lifted up because all seven seals
[1:25:40] have been opened unto us
[1:25:41] to get the kind of the wrong kind of ad
[1:25:42] to get lifted up because we believe
[1:25:44] these certain things about the bride
[1:25:46] and her ministry and her calling and
[1:25:48] what her position is today
[1:25:49] we have to have the right doctrine and
[1:25:51] the right attitude in order for that
[1:25:53] doctrine to be effective
[1:25:57] brother brahms correcting the wrong
[1:25:58] attitude that's what he's doing he's
[1:26:00] correcting the wrong attitude
[1:26:02] and that's the and that's this is the
[1:26:03] attitude of the one the one he's
[1:26:05] corrected i'd rather be wrong in my
[1:26:06] doctrine
[1:26:07] than to be right in my doctrine are
[1:26:08] wrong in my heart he's correcting those
[1:26:10] who have right doctrine and wrong hearts
[1:26:13] that's who he's correcting he's not
[1:26:14] saying it's better to have wrong
[1:26:16] doctrine but he's correcting those who
[1:26:17] have the truth but don't hold it in
[1:26:20] humility
[1:26:22] he's correcting those who are arrogant
[1:26:23] with righteousness arrogant with truth
[1:26:25] arrogant with the things that they have
[1:26:27] been given
[1:26:27] [Applause]
[1:26:30] that's how he says it and get in the
[1:26:32] spirit i'd rather be wrong in my
[1:26:33] doctrine and right in my heart
[1:26:35] god will respect it more so he says so
[1:26:38] if a man's wrong now what does that
[1:26:40] bring us to a man who's wrong
[1:26:42] in his doctrine what of it help him he
[1:26:45] needs help
[1:26:46] love him if you can't love your enemy
[1:26:48] the same as you love those who love you
[1:26:50] you're no better off than the publicans
[1:26:54] what is he correcting you have the right
[1:26:56] doctrine they don't
[1:26:57] but you can't have the right attitude
[1:26:58] towards them
[1:27:00] you have the right doctrine they have
[1:27:02] wrong doctrine but you can't have the
[1:27:04] right attitude towards them so he says
[1:27:06] listen i'd rather be that guy
[1:27:07] with wrong doctrine in the right heart
[1:27:09] than you who have the right doctrine
[1:27:11] and the wrong heart he says so then what
[1:27:13] you need to do is have the right
[1:27:14] attitude
[1:27:15] help him if he needs help if he's wrong
[1:27:17] then you're right have the right
[1:27:18] attitude towards him
[1:27:20] [Applause]
[1:27:21] [Music]
[1:27:23] the wrong heart is he refers to it here
[1:27:25] it's the wrong attitude
[1:27:27] i believe it speaks of spiritual and
[1:27:29] emotional maturity
[1:27:32] i think it deals with elements of pride
[1:27:34] and selfishness
[1:27:37] i mean there was brother brown talks
[1:27:39] about a million more in 44 well now it's
[1:27:41] us four
[1:27:41] no more
[1:27:47] power apart from character satanic
[1:27:50] i i just want to lay this seat in there
[1:27:52] we can't properly exercise
[1:27:54] power or the voice without bitterness
[1:27:58] when i say bitterness the bitter belly
[1:28:01] not the wrong attitude but we can't
[1:28:03] properly exercise power
[1:28:05] unless bitterness has brought us a
[1:28:06] humility
[1:28:09] let me just go further in this journey
[1:28:10] together
[1:28:12] the right heart as we may say the right
[1:28:13] spirit
[1:28:16] it can be taught that's the beauty when
[1:28:20] brother abraham says i'd rather be right
[1:28:21] in my heart and wrong in my doctrine the
[1:28:23] right heart can be taught right doctor
[1:28:25] the right heart is in a position where
[1:28:26] it can be taught and it can grow and
[1:28:28] learn and it can be corrected to receive
[1:28:31] right doctrine so a right heart a right
[1:28:32] spirit can be taught and it can be
[1:28:34] corrected
[1:28:35] and that would be maybe the first thing
[1:28:36] we can identify about having that kind
[1:28:38] of humility and the right kind of
[1:28:39] attitude
[1:28:40] but the component that's most critical
[1:28:42] to us if we're going to be the final
[1:28:43] voice to the final age
[1:28:45] not only can the right attitude be
[1:28:46] taught but the right attitude can teach
[1:28:51] if you don't have the right attitude not
[1:28:52] only can you not be taught you can't
[1:28:54] properly teach
[1:28:55] and what good is our right doctrine if
[1:28:57] we don't have an attitude that can teach
[1:28:58] it
[1:28:59] what good is being right about something
[1:29:01] if you can't convey the correctness of
[1:29:03] it
[1:29:04] what's the good of being right if
[1:29:05] there's an attitude that makes you look
[1:29:07] wrong
[1:29:09] what good would it be to have all seven
[1:29:11] seals open
[1:29:12] and not have the nature of christ to
[1:29:14] conduct ourselves in it
[1:29:18] amen the wrong heart cannot properly be
[1:29:20] taught nor can it properly teach
[1:29:23] so what benefit would the right doctrine
[1:29:25] be in psalms 25 9 the meek will he guide
[1:29:28] in judgment
[1:29:29] and the meek will he teach his way think
[1:29:31] of what jesus said about the meek and
[1:29:33] those that are poor in spirit the great
[1:29:35] things that are given to them
[1:29:36] the meek will he guide and judge the
[1:29:38] meek will he teaches way why does it
[1:29:39] the meek are ones who can be taught the
[1:29:41] meek are the ones that can be guided
[1:29:43] meek is a mildness of disposition it's a
[1:29:45] gentleness of spirit
[1:29:47] it's the opposite of being
[1:29:48] self-assertive it's the opposite of
[1:29:51] being arrogant
[1:29:52] or being selfish and only having
[1:29:53] yourself in mind
[1:29:55] it's a mildness of disposition not an
[1:29:57] iron disposition not an arrogance not
[1:29:59] but a gentleness of spirit
[1:30:01] you know in the fruits of the spirit
[1:30:02] gentleness is the ability to rejoice
[1:30:04] when others are blessed
[1:30:07] that's what gentleness is is when you
[1:30:09] cease god blessing somebody else
[1:30:11] you can truly rejoice
[1:30:14] and that kind of gentleness and meekness
[1:30:16] comes from knowing your position in
[1:30:17] christ
[1:30:18] because when you see god blessing
[1:30:19] somebody else it's not a challenge to
[1:30:21] your own
[1:30:22] your own standing in christ when you see
[1:30:23] somebody else being blessed someone else
[1:30:25] being used think god doing things in
[1:30:26] other people's lives or other people's
[1:30:28] assemblies whatever it might be
[1:30:29] you can say that's wonderful praise the
[1:30:31] lord you don't have to say well that's
[1:30:32] that's this and that's that and deny the
[1:30:35] lord of god
[1:30:35] and deny the works that he does you
[1:30:37] could say you know what i rejoice in
[1:30:38] that i'm happy with that
[1:30:44] there's no attitude of self-entitlement
[1:30:46] to the meek
[1:30:48] there's no elitism to the meek the
[1:30:49] meekly guiding judgment the meek will
[1:30:51] teach his ways so the meek are
[1:30:53] are not just consumed with their self
[1:30:54] therefore they're not quick to defend
[1:30:55] themselves
[1:30:57] not quick to self-justify
[1:31:00] it's through meekness that we're able to
[1:31:02] even be changed by the word of god james
[1:31:03] 1 21 wherefore
[1:31:04] lay apart all filthiness and superfluity
[1:31:07] of naughtiness and receive with meekness
[1:31:09] the engrafted word which is able to save
[1:31:10] your souls
[1:31:12] that's the only way you can receive the
[1:31:13] word is through meekness the meek will
[1:31:15] he got him judgment the meekly teaches
[1:31:16] way
[1:31:17] i'm just going through these scriptures
[1:31:18] very quickly to show by the word and
[1:31:20] humility
[1:31:22] this humility that's necessary with the
[1:31:24] word when the word comes to you it's the
[1:31:25] only way that
[1:31:26] we can truly be taught is to have the
[1:31:28] right kind of attitude the right kind of
[1:31:30] heart the right kind of spirit to have
[1:31:31] this meekness and humility that's the
[1:31:33] way that we're taught but it's also the
[1:31:34] way that we can teach
[1:31:36] the meek receive correction but we
[1:31:39] should only correct through meekness
[1:31:42] we don't go to the one and we try to
[1:31:44] correct them and you should do this and
[1:31:45] you should do that
[1:31:46] and they don't receive and say well
[1:31:47] you're just not meek
[1:31:49] if you're a meek you could receive
[1:31:51] correction
[1:31:52] it says in galatians 6 1 brethren if a
[1:31:54] man be overtaken in the fall ye which
[1:31:56] are spiritual
[1:31:57] restore such a one in the spirit of
[1:31:59] meekness
[1:32:00] considering thyself lest thou also be
[1:32:02] tempted
[1:32:03] it's an attitude that's not
[1:32:04] condescending it's not judgmental
[1:32:07] it's not dangling somebody over hell or
[1:32:08] holding their feet to the fire or trying
[1:32:10] to say well
[1:32:11] you're just a bunch of serpent seed
[1:32:12] because you can't listen to what this
[1:32:14] correction
[1:32:14] but no you go to him the spirit of
[1:32:16] meekness
[1:32:19] we're talking about bittersweet this is
[1:32:22] the bitter belly
[1:32:24] revelations chapter four part three
[1:32:26] brother says god never sent brother
[1:32:27] neville and i to be bosses not at all
[1:32:29] we're just your brothers see instructors
[1:32:31] in the gospel so let's all work together
[1:32:34] and sometime and let me just say this
[1:32:37] brother chad and i fellowship a little
[1:32:38] bit of the last couple days
[1:32:40] on accountability and mutual dependency
[1:32:42] among the parts in the body
[1:32:44] and and this is what i believe brother
[1:32:46] branham lifts up many times when he
[1:32:47] speaks about church order and
[1:32:49] the way the church operated he never
[1:32:50] made one man the dictator in the church
[1:32:53] but each office and each member were
[1:32:54] mutually dependent upon each other there
[1:32:56] wasn't a co-dependency where everyone's
[1:32:57] just relying on the pastor and he's the
[1:32:59] he's the god of the church
[1:33:00] and we're just going to follow after him
[1:33:02] whatever he says whatever he does but no
[1:33:03] he's dependent upon you he's depend on
[1:33:05] other offices officers are dependent on
[1:33:06] him and we're all mutually dependent
[1:33:08] that way there's no code dependency and
[1:33:10] where there's no codependency
[1:33:11] there's no manipulation there's no abuse
[1:33:13] there's no control
[1:33:14] so he says we're not you're we're not
[1:33:16] your bosses he says and let me just say
[1:33:18] this when brother brown says your pastor
[1:33:20] is your husband spiritually speaking
[1:33:21] what he was saying is your husband is
[1:33:23] your pastor spiritually speaking
[1:33:26] your husband is your spiritual pastor so
[1:33:28] he wasn't telling everybody here that
[1:33:30] brother chad's your husband
[1:33:33] and so you can say well i've got a wife
[1:33:34] at home and a husband at church
[1:33:37] no i'm a pastor to my wife that's why
[1:33:41] she's
[1:33:41] that's how she's a pastor in the home
[1:33:42] how she's a co-pastor she's the
[1:33:44] associate pastor
[1:33:46] and this is how that's what brother
[1:33:47] brown was trying to lift up not try to
[1:33:48] make the pastor the husband would you go
[1:33:50] do that without asking your pastor
[1:33:52] would you go do that without asking your
[1:33:53] husband how could you go on vacation and
[1:33:55] i'll ask your husband
[1:33:56] that's a good point i wouldn't go on
[1:33:57] vacation without asking my husband and
[1:33:59] they use that to try to tell you gotta
[1:34:00] you gotta ask your pastor first before
[1:34:02] you can buy a car before you can do this
[1:34:03] before you do that
[1:34:04] why they've manipulated the word and
[1:34:05] made it something that's not
[1:34:07] your husband in your home is your
[1:34:09] spiritual pastor
[1:34:10] that's why the bible tells the women to
[1:34:12] learn at home ask their questions at
[1:34:13] home
[1:34:14] be in subjection to their own husbands
[1:34:16] it says
[1:34:17] it was a little bit of an aside there i
[1:34:18] apologize for the the trail
[1:34:21] but he's laying this out we're not to be
[1:34:22] bosses we're instructors in the gospels
[1:34:24] so let's all work together
[1:34:25] and sometime if something operating has
[1:34:27] to be called or said something said
[1:34:29] about it
[1:34:30] called down or something like order and
[1:34:32] that person that's got that gifts
[1:34:33] rejects it refuses it remember the gift
[1:34:35] wasn't right so he's talking about
[1:34:37] gifts being placed in the church and
[1:34:38] then being in subjection answering the
[1:34:40] right way being used the right way
[1:34:42] he says it wasn't god in the first place
[1:34:43] and then he says this and this is
[1:34:45] applicable to what he's saying but it's
[1:34:46] applicable in general the spirit of god
[1:34:49] always is ready for correction sweet and
[1:34:52] humble
[1:34:52] willing regardless of the context the
[1:34:56] spirit of god is always ready for
[1:34:58] correction sweet
[1:34:59] humble and willing see if it stands up
[1:35:01] says i'll do it anyhow you know
[1:35:03] how sometimes so he just stops he says
[1:35:04] just remember arrogant spirits are not
[1:35:07] of god if you didn't write anything down
[1:35:10] i've said this morning
[1:35:12] write it down borrow pen paper i'll
[1:35:13] email it to you text it i'll tweet it
[1:35:15] i'll instagram it i'll snapchat it
[1:35:17] arrogant spirits are not of god
[1:35:20] [Applause]
[1:35:21] we can never be arrogant and be
[1:35:23] operating under the spirit and influence
[1:35:25] of jesus christ
[1:35:26] the spirit of god is always ready for
[1:35:28] correction sweet humble
[1:35:30] and willing arrogant spirits are not of
[1:35:32] god
[1:35:33] so this great sweetness that we take
[1:35:35] into our mouth we begin to eat this
[1:35:37] message and eat this book
[1:35:38] and we're eating the unfailing body word
[1:35:40] of the son of man and we're to prophesy
[1:35:42] again
[1:35:43] we do not prophesy with the taste of
[1:35:45] sweetness in our mouth
[1:35:46] we prophesy with the feeling of
[1:35:47] bitterness in our belly
[1:35:49] otherwise we would not prophesy
[1:35:51] correctly we could get lifted up in our
[1:35:53] flesh it's that great paradox
[1:35:55] of having the divine inside of us
[1:35:57] wrapped around a bunch of carnality
[1:35:59] and god brings the bitterness that we
[1:36:01] might bring the carnality
[1:36:02] under subjection and it's through
[1:36:04] bitterness that humility
[1:36:06] and meekness overwhelm our being think
[1:36:09] of where you would be without suffering
[1:36:11] think of where you would be without
[1:36:12] great loss where would you be if you had
[1:36:14] not lost family
[1:36:15] where would you be if you had not
[1:36:17] suffered great tribulation where would
[1:36:19] we be
[1:36:19] we would be arrogant
[1:36:24] the arrogant spirits are not of god
[1:36:28] the question answers on the seals
[1:36:29] brother i said will the bride of christ
[1:36:30] have a ministry before the rapture
[1:36:32] sure that's what's going on right now
[1:36:34] the bride of christ certainly
[1:36:36] it is the message of the hour the bride
[1:36:38] of christ sure she consists of apostles
[1:36:41] prophets teachers evangelists and
[1:36:42] pastors is that right
[1:36:44] that's the bride of christ sure she's
[1:36:46] got a ministry
[1:36:47] great ministry it's the ministry of the
[1:36:50] hour
[1:36:51] and that language the bride of christ
[1:36:53] the great ministry the minister of the
[1:36:55] hour the full measure all these things
[1:36:57] his body his voice perform his works it
[1:37:00] creates in your minds
[1:37:01] and in the natural mind something very
[1:37:03] very great but he says it'll be so
[1:37:05] humble
[1:37:06] now remember he says how many was here
[1:37:08] last sunday remember what i preached on
[1:37:09] humility
[1:37:11] and his title was god hiding himself in
[1:37:13] simplicity but the simplicity was
[1:37:15] synonymous with humility
[1:37:17] oh don't forget that he says i'm going
[1:37:18] to stop a minute to warn that again
[1:37:20] remember when god predicts anything
[1:37:21] great to happen the people are looking
[1:37:22] so far away by their wisdom
[1:37:24] until they miss what happens when god
[1:37:26] says anything is great the world laughs
[1:37:28] at it that bunch of ignoramuses that's
[1:37:29] right
[1:37:30] but when the great world and the great
[1:37:31] high church said boy that's glorious god
[1:37:33] says a bunch of ignoramuses
[1:37:34] he says you have to watch he said i
[1:37:36] don't mean maybe it that way exactly
[1:37:37] that way but that's the way that it is
[1:37:41] power's sweet but humility is bitter
[1:37:46] it's the bride's bittersweet ministry
[1:37:49] it's going to be great and big in the
[1:37:51] eyes of god but not great and big in the
[1:37:52] eyes of the world
[1:37:54] we're not going to be able to do
[1:37:55] everything just exactly right
[1:37:58] and all of a sudden our neighbors be
[1:38:00] like okay i get it now
[1:38:02] you're good websites are going to shut
[1:38:04] down because you're able to
[1:38:05] you're able to produce an apologetic
[1:38:07] manual that explains every inconsistency
[1:38:10] every question
[1:38:11] everything about the message places
[1:38:12] everything just right and then
[1:38:14] everyone's the critics going gonna go
[1:38:15] you know what we retract what we've said
[1:38:16] before
[1:38:18] we welcome you to the club of those
[1:38:19] accepted ways of worshiping christ
[1:38:21] it'll never happen as a matter of fact
[1:38:24] it's just the line keeps getting drawn
[1:38:26] tighter and tighter where you're
[1:38:27] excluded more and more often from
[1:38:29] acceptable means of worship
[1:38:35] and god in simplicity is brother ben i
[1:38:36] made reference back to that
[1:38:38] he says remember what i preached last
[1:38:40] sunday he said remember friend
[1:38:42] don't look for great big
[1:38:46] you say god he speaks of a great big
[1:38:49] things
[1:38:50] there'll come a time there'll be this
[1:38:52] that or the other great big things
[1:38:53] he says i hope you're catching what i'm
[1:38:55] talking about great big things and i
[1:38:58] believe that he is
[1:38:59] specifically identifying how that the
[1:39:02] world
[1:39:02] expects the open of those seals the
[1:39:04] reveal of the son of man those that this
[1:39:06] the things that were transparent at that
[1:39:07] very moment where these things have been
[1:39:09] preached the world was expecting it to
[1:39:11] be
[1:39:11] that messiah would go stand over on a
[1:39:13] mountain with a mile long spear
[1:39:15] and pick people off he said it was so
[1:39:17] humble the prophet missed it
[1:39:19] so there's something about the son of
[1:39:21] man and there's something about the
[1:39:23] bride where it's so humble
[1:39:25] because it's not great big that would
[1:39:26] satisfy the flesh but it's actually so
[1:39:29] humble it's a bitterness to our belly
[1:39:31] so oh when it comes to pass it be great
[1:39:33] big big like this and it'll be so humble
[1:39:35] you'll miss the whole thing and just go
[1:39:36] right on
[1:39:37] you'll look back and say well that never
[1:39:38] did come pass right over the top and
[1:39:40] you've never seen it
[1:39:42] it's so simple god lives in simplicity
[1:39:45] to manifest his self in greatness if i
[1:39:48] could just say this the reason why you
[1:39:49] have so many eight messengers is because
[1:39:51] they missed christ
[1:39:53] because it was so humble and since they
[1:39:55] didn't see christ they're so arrogant to
[1:39:56] think that they could be it
[1:39:59] because in its humility it was missed
[1:40:01] it's so simple god lives in simplicity
[1:40:03] to manifest himself in greatness
[1:40:05] what makes him great because he can
[1:40:07] simplify himself
[1:40:09] a big great man can't simplify himself
[1:40:12] he's got to be a dignitary
[1:40:14] but he ain't big enough yet when he
[1:40:16] becomes big enough
[1:40:18] then he comes down like this and can
[1:40:20] humble himself
[1:40:22] isn't that beautiful the emphasis here
[1:40:25] isn't just calling out the unbeliever
[1:40:26] who can't see it
[1:40:28] so he's not just trying to make the
[1:40:29] point ah the unbeliever he'll never see
[1:40:30] it he'll never see it why because it's
[1:40:32] so humble
[1:40:32] he's instructing us it's instructive to
[1:40:35] the bride it's corrective to the bride
[1:40:37] you can't get lifted up in this
[1:40:40] inappropriately
[1:40:41] we want to be lifted up in the spirit of
[1:40:43] the lord we want to be lifted up raised
[1:40:44] up in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:40:46] want to soar like an eagle in the sky
[1:40:47] but it's not it's there's an opposite
[1:40:49] thing that's taking place in our flesh
[1:40:53] he's correcting the bride we got to
[1:40:55] humble ourselves to be so humble
[1:40:57] god lives in simplicity manifest himself
[1:41:00] in greatness
[1:41:01] if he wants to manifest himself in
[1:41:03] greatness he has to first live in
[1:41:04] humility and simplicity
[1:41:06] whether it says god revealing himself in
[1:41:08] humility
[1:41:10] that's where god hides god hides in
[1:41:11] humility so if god's going to be
[1:41:13] expressed he has to first be hidden in
[1:41:16] humility
[1:41:18] this is the bride's bittersweet ministry
[1:41:21] full of his power full of his glory bone
[1:41:24] of his bone
[1:41:25] flesh of his flesh pure gold yet meek
[1:41:28] and humble all right
[1:41:32] let's all stand on our feet for a moment
[1:41:34] it's 12 31 by my clock just stand on
[1:41:36] your feet just
[1:41:37] just stand preston you can stretch a
[1:41:40] little bit
[1:41:41] exercise yourself everybody everybody
[1:41:44] doing good
[1:41:45] are you doing good all is well
[1:41:48] stretch stretch get comfortable
[1:41:52] all right you can be seated
[1:41:56] i know somebody was asleep and thought
[1:41:58] yes
[1:41:59] where are the musicians why aren't they
[1:42:01] singing take the name of jesus with you
[1:42:07] brother branham says that's what makes
[1:42:09] him god to me
[1:42:11] because he humbled himself god is
[1:42:14] humility don't ever forget that humility
[1:42:16] is god
[1:42:16] never boastful it's always humility
[1:42:21] brother brown makes this statement i
[1:42:22] hope you can just take this to your
[1:42:24] heart this is the this is the bitter
[1:42:25] belly that john
[1:42:26] experienced he says not saying anything
[1:42:28] against people but when you see a person
[1:42:30] that's got the answer to everything
[1:42:31] that's contrary to the word
[1:42:34] and don't leave and say i don't know to
[1:42:36] the first question you hear just because
[1:42:37] you want to
[1:42:38] you know line up with this and then have
[1:42:40] the answer the rest of the time
[1:42:42] but he's identifying an attitude you see
[1:42:43] a person that's got the answer to
[1:42:45] everything
[1:42:45] that's contrary to the word i call it
[1:42:48] the thing of it is scenario
[1:42:49] syndrome where no matter what quote you
[1:42:51] share no matter what you say no matter
[1:42:53] what principles presented they say well
[1:42:54] the thing of it is
[1:42:55] and they've got an explanation that's
[1:42:57] different than what you just read
[1:42:58] or different than what you understand
[1:43:00] he's identifying an attitude and an
[1:43:01] arrogance when you see a person that's
[1:43:03] got the answer to everything
[1:43:04] that's contrary to the word
[1:43:07] it says in the message humble thyself
[1:43:09] there in the summer of 1963
[1:43:10] i've always found out that the man that
[1:43:12] humbles himself is the man that god
[1:43:14] exalts
[1:43:15] when you take a person with his chest
[1:43:17] out and knows everything and you can't
[1:43:18] tell him nothing and he's arrogant well
[1:43:20] that's the person that never gets
[1:43:22] anywhere
[1:43:22] but you take that person that humbles
[1:43:24] themselves and walks sweetly
[1:43:26] if the bride is going to arrive at her
[1:43:28] destination she's going to have to walk
[1:43:31] humbly walk simply walk sweetly
[1:43:34] why because jesus showed us the way to
[1:43:36] do it he's the one to make your example
[1:43:38] all by the word and humility
[1:43:42] how did he do it by humility humbly
[1:43:44] walking he says a man who is arrogant
[1:43:46] with his chest out knows everything
[1:43:48] got an answer to every question he says
[1:43:49] that's contrary to the word
[1:43:51] that person will never get anywhere but
[1:43:53] he takes the person that humbles
[1:43:55] themselves
[1:43:55] and walks sweetly
[1:43:59] again and humble thyself you know people
[1:44:00] want power
[1:44:02] really they want to know what power is
[1:44:05] they don't really know what goes with it
[1:44:08] can you see the i i just see so plainly
[1:44:10] why the lord led me this way
[1:44:12] and looking at this subject the bitter
[1:44:14] sweetness to it
[1:44:16] the power the glory the manifestations
[1:44:18] all the things that are spoken about the
[1:44:19] bride the ministry
[1:44:21] that's represented in revelations 10 11
[1:44:23] but then yet there's a bitter belly that
[1:44:24] precedes it
[1:44:26] before that because she can't be verse
[1:44:28] 11
[1:44:29] unless she's experienced verse 10. she
[1:44:31] has to take the book it has to be sweet
[1:44:33] to her she has to eat all of it but then
[1:44:34] it has to be in her belly a bitterness
[1:44:37] there has to be a consequence and so
[1:44:39] brother bam says they don't really know
[1:44:40] what goes with power
[1:44:41] the way up is down if you want power see
[1:44:44] how humble you can get
[1:44:46] just get away from all your worldly
[1:44:48] thinking and humble yourself before god
[1:44:50] and then you've got more power than the
[1:44:52] man that runs all over the building and
[1:44:53] makes a big lot of noise
[1:44:55] because you've been able to conquer
[1:44:56] yourself and commit yourself to christ
[1:44:59] to humble yourself
[1:45:00] before him that's really power
[1:45:03] sometimes we think the powers and how
[1:45:05] loud and how boisterous and how
[1:45:07] uh emotional people get but he says
[1:45:09] power is conquering yourself
[1:45:11] and completing yourself to christ to
[1:45:12] humble yourself before he says you show
[1:45:14] me a church that's humble
[1:45:16] real humble not an arrogant church just
[1:45:18] a sweet
[1:45:19] humble church i'll show you a church
[1:45:21] that has the favor
[1:45:22] and power of god in it is that not what
[1:45:26] we desire
[1:45:27] to aspire to is the fact that we could
[1:45:29] be a church
[1:45:30] that's humble real humble not arrogant
[1:45:32] just sweet
[1:45:33] humble he says i'll show you a church
[1:45:35] that the favor and power of god is in
[1:45:37] oh may the favor of god be in our midst
[1:45:40] may the power of god be in our midst and
[1:45:42] it's not going to be through being loud
[1:45:43] and boisterous and arrogant
[1:45:44] but a church that's humble real humble
[1:45:47] sweet
[1:45:48] a sweet humble church a church that
[1:45:50] knows what bitterness is
[1:45:55] you show me a church that's humble real
[1:45:58] humble
[1:45:58] not an arrogant church that's a church
[1:46:02] that has favor and the power of god
[1:46:03] that's right that's the thing it takes
[1:46:04] humility
[1:46:05] humbling ourselves before god and
[1:46:06] letting god just work through us
[1:46:09] that sweetness in john's mouth soon
[1:46:11] became bitterness and it was through
[1:46:12] that bitterness
[1:46:13] that he was bowed over and it was then
[1:46:16] from that position of weakness and harm
[1:46:18] the position of pain and sorrow that god
[1:46:20] said
[1:46:21] you must prophesy again
[1:46:25] can i get just personal for a moment
[1:46:28] it's a slight nod i may never preach
[1:46:32] in another church as beautiful as this
[1:46:34] one
[1:46:36] as far as the amenities the construction
[1:46:39] and where else can a preacher have this
[1:46:41] many things at a pulpit
[1:46:42] if i wanted to do transparencies
[1:46:46] i have a vintage service i could put
[1:46:48] them up here i could hook my laptop
[1:46:49] there i could control
[1:46:50] i could do powerpoint i could do
[1:46:53] everything from here
[1:46:54] everything's taken care of every monitor
[1:46:55] is just done just right every office has
[1:46:57] a computer got printers everything
[1:46:59] the amenities and the beauty of this
[1:47:01] church
[1:47:02] and the things if you invited somebody
[1:47:04] to church i mean there's no shame in
[1:47:06] this building
[1:47:08] there's no shame in the comfortable
[1:47:09] chairs there's no shame and how well
[1:47:11] you're all dressed and there's not a
[1:47:13] real big approach maybe to a lot of
[1:47:14] things that you can say about this
[1:47:15] church this is a beautiful beautiful
[1:47:17] church
[1:47:17] in terms of its facilities and its
[1:47:19] offices and its administration
[1:47:21] and all those things and there's a lot
[1:47:22] of things that you've enjoyed for many
[1:47:24] many years that perhaps
[1:47:25] it was a great pride to you just how
[1:47:27] beautiful this is but the beauty of the
[1:47:29] church is not the building
[1:47:30] it's the character of the people and
[1:47:32] character can only be forged through
[1:47:33] suffering
[1:47:34] and perhaps what this great big
[1:47:36] beautiful building can hide sometimes
[1:47:37] is the great bitterness that we have in
[1:47:39] ourselves not the bitterness of an
[1:47:41] arrogance but the humility that's being
[1:47:43] wrought by pain and suffering and the
[1:47:44] things that we go through
[1:47:46] and we cannot allow the comfortableness
[1:47:48] of our assembly and the beautiful
[1:47:50] things of our amenities and our
[1:47:51] fellowships and all the technology and
[1:47:53] the things that we have
[1:47:54] ever rob us from the humble attitude
[1:47:56] before christ that we're nothing without
[1:47:57] you lord
[1:47:59] show me a church that's humble real
[1:48:01] humble and that's a church that has the
[1:48:02] favor and power of god in it
[1:48:08] brother branham writes in church age
[1:48:10] book chapter four just just to maybe
[1:48:12] give you all some hope
[1:48:13] this is all i have left this is it
[1:48:17] so it's just a quote a scripture a quote
[1:48:20] another scripture and
[1:48:21] two other scriptures and a quote just
[1:48:23] just
[1:48:25] just that you can you read that can you
[1:48:27] see that it's eight point font and a
[1:48:29] little seven mixed in there some six
[1:48:31] mixed in there but that's that's all
[1:48:32] i've got left
[1:48:34] if you're zooming in if you're watching
[1:48:36] live streaming and they zoomed in give a
[1:48:37] real tight shot you know exactly where
[1:48:38] i'm going
[1:48:40] bibram says it's strange that god wants
[1:48:42] to develop a christ-like character that
[1:48:44] comes through suffering
[1:48:45] no sir and we all have trials we're all
[1:48:48] tried and chastened to sons not one but
[1:48:50] goes through that
[1:48:52] the church that is not suffering is not
[1:48:54] being tried
[1:48:55] hasn't got it it isn't of god
[1:48:58] so we could take comfort in that the
[1:48:59] church is not suffering it's not being
[1:49:01] tried hasn't got it it isn't of god a
[1:49:02] church that doesn't suffer
[1:49:04] isn't of god paul writes to timothy 2
[1:49:07] timothy chapter 2 verse 3 thou therefore
[1:49:09] endure hardness
[1:49:10] as a good soldier of jesus christ a
[1:49:13] church that is not
[1:49:14] enduring hardness that is not suffering
[1:49:16] is not being tried it isn't of god
[1:49:17] because all children must be tried and
[1:49:19] chastened
[1:49:19] and corrected therefore endure hardness
[1:49:22] as a good soldier it means suffer
[1:49:24] trouble endure affliction
[1:49:25] as a good soldier of jesus christ
[1:49:29] when it says endure hardness it doesn't
[1:49:31] mean become hard
[1:49:33] it doesn't mean become calloused doesn't
[1:49:36] mean to become bitter towards other
[1:49:37] people
[1:49:38] and suspicious and withdraw yourself and
[1:49:41] close yourself
[1:49:42] off but endure hardness as a good
[1:49:43] soldier of jesus christ
[1:49:46] he's not telling us that through
[1:49:47] difficulty through pain and suffering we
[1:49:49] should ever become hardened in the wrong
[1:49:51] kind of way that we should ever get our
[1:49:53] spirits with an iron disposition
[1:49:54] and we just get so stiff and we still
[1:49:56] get so rigid and we get so cast because
[1:49:58] i've been hurt i've been hurt i've been
[1:49:59] hurt and we allow that to make us hard
[1:50:01] no he's not saying endure hardness in
[1:50:03] the way that you become hard but there's
[1:50:05] a softness that comes
[1:50:06] when you go through it because you're a
[1:50:09] church of god that's suffering you're
[1:50:10] being tried
[1:50:11] because you're of god and it doesn't
[1:50:13] make you arrogant it doesn't make you
[1:50:14] haughty it makes you humble
[1:50:17] oh how easy it would be oh we're
[1:50:19] suffering because we've got the truth
[1:50:20] we're suffering because we got the truth
[1:50:22] that's the wrong kind of attitude
[1:50:24] what was the attitude of david per
[1:50:25] adventure god told him to do that
[1:50:29] maybe god told them to do that maybe i
[1:50:32] am suffering
[1:50:33] because of something i did lord i know
[1:50:35] i'm not perfect maybe maybe i didn't
[1:50:37] maybe i haven't always done things right
[1:50:38] and we're not just quick to play the
[1:50:40] card that oh we've got the truth card
[1:50:45] because he said there's no true believer
[1:50:47] free from it talk about the suffering
[1:50:49] this is of god this is the will of god
[1:50:52] it is needful
[1:50:53] suffering bitterness
[1:50:57] we need the lord to teach us the truth
[1:50:59] that we are to suffer
[1:51:02] and be christ-like in doing it that's
[1:51:06] the key
[1:51:07] we can all take some comfort from
[1:51:09] knowing that we're to suffer
[1:51:10] but the real challenge is to be
[1:51:12] christ-like in doing it
[1:51:16] to suffer and be christ-like
[1:51:19] in doing it
[1:51:26] jesus christ was meek
[1:51:30] and lowly the bible says he was a man of
[1:51:32] sorrows
[1:51:34] acquainted with grief despised and
[1:51:36] rejected
[1:51:38] isaiah 53 7 he was oppressed and he was
[1:51:40] afflicted yet he opened not his mouth
[1:51:42] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[1:51:44] as a sheep before his shears is dumb
[1:51:46] so he opened not his mouth
[1:51:50] this is where i'm ending my journey
[1:51:52] today
[1:51:54] it's 12 41 i begin a little bit after 11
[1:51:57] so i know i've been lengthy
[1:52:00] the son of man was smitten
[1:52:04] he was afflicted he was tortured
[1:52:08] the bible says he came to his own his
[1:52:09] own received him not
[1:52:12] he was branded a a heretic a blasphemer
[1:52:15] beelzebub
[1:52:19] i could go on and on for an hour
[1:52:22] and not be finished with the scriptures
[1:52:24] and quotes that describe the humility of
[1:52:26] christ
[1:52:28] his brokenness there was nothing and no
[1:52:31] beauty in him that we would desire him
[1:52:32] he was in his early 30s and they thought
[1:52:34] he was a man around 50.
[1:52:36] there's no charisma about him apparent
[1:52:39] to the way he looked and
[1:52:41] there was just something that you
[1:52:43] wouldn't be drawn to him just by his
[1:52:45] stature
[1:52:47] even his reputation a man whose his
[1:52:50] birth is suspicious
[1:52:52] a man whose labor and his calling was
[1:52:53] nothing to brag about he didn't come
[1:52:55] from the courts he didn't come from the
[1:52:56] palace
[1:52:58] just a humble nazarene
[1:53:01] yet there was something that god was
[1:53:03] right bring it out of his experience
[1:53:05] the bible says he learned obedience by
[1:53:07] the thing which he suffered
[1:53:08] and being made perfect became the
[1:53:10] captain of our salvation
[1:53:13] he learned obedience to the things which
[1:53:15] he suffered it was the suffering that
[1:53:16] was bringing out
[1:53:17] the gold and bringing to the surface the
[1:53:19] real character and deity of jesus christ
[1:53:24] that's why when he would speak he said
[1:53:27] never a man spake like this man
[1:53:30] it wasn't because he came direct from
[1:53:32] the portals of heaven and was robed in
[1:53:33] gowns and
[1:53:34] was dressed in such a way he wasn't a
[1:53:36] saul head and shoulders above everyone
[1:53:38] else that this man when he speaks he
[1:53:39] must be a king he's tall he's got a deep
[1:53:41] voice
[1:53:41] he's got a charisma about him
[1:53:46] but yet he was broke so broken so
[1:53:48] reflected so rejected
[1:53:50] that his words could have a greater
[1:53:52] weight
[1:53:55] and just as the son of man was smitten
[1:53:57] we must also be smitten to have the same
[1:53:59] ministry
[1:54:02] because you are the very manifestation
[1:54:04] of god on earth
[1:54:07] and because you're the very
[1:54:08] manifestation of god on earth there's
[1:54:09] great opposition
[1:54:11] and you'll suffer and be afflicted just
[1:54:12] the same as christ was
[1:54:15] but the power and glory of christ that i
[1:54:17] read to you through the first hour or so
[1:54:19] however long it was just trying to lay
[1:54:20] that foundation and it only
[1:54:22] comes through bitterness difficulty
[1:54:26] trial a struggle humility
[1:54:29] weakness he says when i'm weak
[1:54:32] when paul recognizes when i'm weak i'm
[1:54:34] strong
[1:54:35] his strength is made perfect and a
[1:54:37] weakness so i'll glory in the bitterness
[1:54:39] that the power of christ may rest in me
[1:54:42] revelations 10 11 he said unto me thou
[1:54:44] must prophesy again
[1:54:46] before many peoples and nations and
[1:54:48] tongues and kings
[1:54:51] and brother brown makes this statement
[1:54:52] in the masterpiece
[1:54:55] now in order for this to speak he is the
[1:54:57] word and for the word to speak
[1:55:00] he must come into the image
[1:55:03] has he done that in this hour that was
[1:55:05] the last part for he himself to step
[1:55:07] into this
[1:55:09] he must he says he must come into the
[1:55:13] image
[1:55:14] and then for the image to speak it's got
[1:55:17] to be smitten
[1:55:19] for the image to speak it must be struck
[1:55:21] hard
[1:55:22] it's what it means to be smitten it must
[1:55:24] be afflicted visited with disaster
[1:55:28] that's in order for us to speak if the
[1:55:29] bride we must prophesy again
[1:55:32] and as we ready ourselves oh my we're
[1:55:33] going to prophesy we've got a great work
[1:55:35] to do
[1:55:35] we're going to be the son of man in
[1:55:37] flesh we've got this thing oh my we're
[1:55:38] going to be a great church a glorious
[1:55:40] church a church without spot a wrinkle
[1:55:42] a super race an invincible army
[1:55:45] and he steps into her and we have the
[1:55:47] sweetness of the presence of christ
[1:55:49] we have the glory and the power of
[1:55:51] christ that we begin to recognize in our
[1:55:52] midst and we're becoming sufficiently
[1:55:54] impressed
[1:55:54] he says but before you can speak you've
[1:55:57] got to be smitten
[1:55:59] you've got to be visited with disaster
[1:56:01] you've got to be overwhelmed and struck
[1:56:04] hard
[1:56:04] before you can speak and i believe that
[1:56:06] god is in the midst of his bride
[1:56:08] that he himself has come in to his image
[1:56:11] and the image must speak
[1:56:12] and therefore she must be smitten
[1:56:17] you've been smitten so that you could
[1:56:19] speak
[1:56:21] you're smitten so you can be a credible
[1:56:22] voice the word is very sweet in our
[1:56:25] mouths but it becomes bitter in our
[1:56:26] belly why
[1:56:27] so we can speak
[1:56:30] to be smitten also has another meaning
[1:56:34] to be inspired with love
[1:56:37] we're smitten we've been smitten so
[1:56:42] we're inspired to speak
[1:56:44] regardless of the test regardless of the
[1:56:47] difficulty
[1:56:48] regardless if tens of thousands of my
[1:56:50] friends walk away from me
[1:56:53] i've got to speak this
[1:56:58] i'll ask the musicians to come
[1:57:03] and i took the little book out of the
[1:57:04] angel's hand and ate it up
[1:57:08] and it was
[1:57:12] in my mouth sweet as honey have we
[1:57:15] experienced that
[1:57:18] and as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[1:57:20] was bitter
[1:57:28] this is the consequence for eating this
[1:57:30] message
[1:57:33] not just sweetness in our mouths
[1:57:36] but bitter in our bellies and i shared
[1:57:39] this with you as we close maybe the
[1:57:41] musicians can play in the key of g my
[1:57:43] hope is in the lord
[1:57:52] let me just encourage you to eat it till
[1:57:56] you feel it
[1:58:00] keep feeding on it
[1:58:04] keep embracing it
[1:58:06] [Music]
[1:58:07] and i know that it'll be great
[1:58:09] bitterness in your belly
[1:58:11] but it's worth it
[1:58:18] we should eat it till it hurts
[1:58:24] he said as soon as i began to take the
[1:58:26] book
[1:58:28] so i began to eat it it was sweetness in
[1:58:29] my mouth
[1:58:30] [Music]
[1:58:32] but once i took it all and it entered
[1:58:35] into my belly there
[1:58:37] there it was bitter
[1:58:38] [Music]
[1:58:41] i know we go through difficult times to
[1:58:42] go through trials
[1:58:44] it's bittersweet isn't it believing this
[1:58:48] message is bittersweet
[1:58:50] but it has a purpose lord let this
[1:58:53] sweetness
[1:58:54] together with this bitterness bring out
[1:58:56] the sweet fragrance of christ
[1:58:59] let it produce a christ-like behavior in
[1:59:01] the midst of trials that you and your
[1:59:02] wisdom allowed to come to pass
[1:59:03] allow it the lord to bring forth the
[1:59:05] christ-like behavior when i suffer for
[1:59:07] your name's sake
[1:59:08] it's bittersweet but oh what a great
[1:59:12] calling we have in this hour
[1:59:13] let's stand to our feet
[1:59:19] i encourage you to eat eat this book
[1:59:23] feed on this book take it into your
[1:59:26] bosom
[1:59:28] swallow all of it and let your bowels be
[1:59:30] full of it
[1:59:30] [Music]
[1:59:32] as we rejoice in the sweetness we can
[1:59:34] glory in the bitterness
[1:59:36] lord i'm not ashamed of the bitterness
[1:59:38] in my belly
[1:59:39] lord is producing in me a nature and a
[1:59:41] character
[1:59:43] let's commiserate with the very
[1:59:45] character and nature of christ
[1:59:47] if we're gonna be the final voice to the
[1:59:49] final age then we must be smitten
[1:59:52] perhaps we'd be willing to say lord
[1:59:53] smite us
[1:59:55] lord if i truly be the final voice to
[1:59:57] the final age
[1:59:58] that smite be lord that i might smear
[2:00:00] speak lord
[2:00:02] lord for you have come into the image
[2:00:04] and i want it to be loosed i want to be
[2:00:06] free
[2:00:06] lord smite me i invite anyone here who
[2:00:09] needs to
[2:00:10] touch from the lord who's felt that the
[2:00:12] lord has brought some correction maybe
[2:00:14] some drawing of his love and his grace
[2:00:15] to you
[2:00:16] just open up your heart to him today and
[2:00:18] receive him lord don't let his presence
[2:00:20] pass you by don't let it pass you by
[2:00:22] without you saying lord here i am lord
[2:00:24] i'm here to be spoken to lord i'm here
[2:00:26] to be changed
[2:00:27] lord i know this i can speak this with
[2:00:29] plainness in my heart
[2:00:31] this church has gone through great
[2:00:32] affliction and great trial
[2:00:34] don't let it harden your hearts don't
[2:00:36] let it make you can't be callous
[2:00:38] say lord today i allow this bitterness
[2:00:41] to humble me
[2:00:44] lord the gift of the rejection of my
[2:00:46] family the rejection
[2:00:47] by those i love the loss of spouses
[2:00:50] whatever it might be lord
[2:00:51] i will allow it to humble me that i may

[2:01:25] that meek nature that meek spirit
[2:01:29] just takes it they don't try to defend
[2:01:32] themselves they don't try to deflect the
[2:01:34] blows they don't try to
[2:01:35] self-justify it they don't even try to
[2:01:39] tear down the offender the one that's
[2:01:40] punching them they just take it
[2:01:42] when they're buffeted

[2:01:48] through the difficulties of life and
[2:01:49] through the bitterness that they've
[2:01:51] experienced by taking this book

[2:01:57] lord may they not try to fix the
[2:01:59] bitterness in their belly
[2:02:02] lord may they not get arrogant or lifted
[2:02:04] up with pride as a means of
[2:02:05] protecting their spirits but lord may

[2:11:28] overcoming the truth
[2:11:33] with every tongue in nations

[2:12:12] [Music]
[2:12:16] let's just lift our and voices
[2:12:20] are the generations
[2:12:46] foreign
[2:12:52] hallelujah praise the lord how many feel
[2:12:55] like you've got good instruction
[2:12:57] and correction today amen
[2:13:01] we've said this before but it it it
[2:13:03] means so much right now to me
[2:13:06] that god had one purpose one goal
[2:13:09] one thing he wanted to accomplish and it
[2:13:12] come in three parts
[2:13:14] first to get preeminence in a man and he
[2:13:16] did that in christ jesus
[2:13:19] second to have premise and a bride and
[2:13:21] he's doing that now
[2:13:24] jesus was an example of what preeminence
[2:13:26] looked like
[2:13:28] spit on and didn't spit back rowed
[2:13:31] against and riled not back
[2:13:32] was hated but loved in return it's a
[2:13:35] high
[2:13:36] order friends it's a perfect example
[2:13:40] it's a high calling but that's our
[2:13:42] calling what he demonstrated
[2:13:45] were also to demonstrate
[2:13:49] amen it's sobering because in the flesh
[2:13:52] we know it's impossible
[2:13:55] in the flesh the only thing that's
[2:13:56] possible is defense arrogance
[2:13:59] hate bitter response
[2:14:02] but that's why the flesh has to die
[2:14:06] so that the spirit of god can dwell in
[2:14:08] and live
[2:14:09] and bring all the attributes of christ
[2:14:11] out of the seed
[2:14:13] this is a good time to die all over
[2:14:15] again
[2:14:16] die we thought we were dead but we
[2:14:18] realized we got to be more dead
[2:14:20] and more dead and more dead so that he
[2:14:23] can have
[2:14:23] absolute preeminence in his mind that's
[2:14:26] what we all want it's what we're honing
[2:14:28] for
[2:14:29] we're wrestling with the flesh but we
[2:14:31] just need to surrender to the power of
[2:14:33] the word
[2:14:35] and let god have his way amen
[2:14:39] god through our brother aaron so clearly
[2:14:42] articulated exactly what he's looking
[2:14:44] for in this day
[2:14:46] and it's the cry that's deep within
[2:14:49] let's just surrender to him
[2:14:51] and let him have his way say god i've
[2:14:54] recognized there's more there there's
[2:14:56] still too much
[2:14:57] self right i think it's faith fair
[2:15:00] and safe to say there's still too much
[2:15:02] self
[2:15:04] and we want less of self we want it to
[2:15:06] be all of him
[2:15:08] and we just appreciate what god spoke to
[2:15:10] us today
[2:15:11] i mean as we part and as we sing and
[2:15:14] pray walk out those doors let it not
[2:15:16] just be a sermon that was good
[2:15:18] let it be more than that let's chew on
[2:15:20] it amen let's
[2:15:22] chew it let's swallow it let's digest it
[2:15:24] amen let's make this sermon
[2:15:26] live because it wasn't just a sermon it
[2:15:29] was god speaking to his children
[2:15:31] and god sharing with us what he wants in
[2:15:33] this day and what light is supposed to
[2:15:35] shine in this hour
[2:15:37] i say god let it be manifest right here
[2:15:40] amen praise be to god we love you with
[2:15:43] the love of the lord
[2:15:45] we're going to let you go and we just
[2:15:46] want everybody to know we'll be back

[2:15:59] immediately after the preaching
[2:16:02] amen you know this don't consume me lord
[2:16:05] can we sing that song consuming you know
[2:16:07] i just want to make this comment before
[2:16:08] we sing this
[2:16:11] traditionally when we understand things
[2:16:13] that bear light
[2:16:15] oil lamps candles fire
[2:16:19] whatever item is going to be used to
[2:16:21] fuel that light
[2:16:23] has to be consumed in order to give life
[2:16:26] and god wants to shine his light through
[2:16:29] flesh bodies
[2:16:31] but he's got to consume the flesh part
[2:16:33] of us
[2:16:34] the carnal part has got to be consumed
[2:16:38] that the light of god the light of god
[2:16:41] the gospel the word christ light
[2:16:43] can be made manifest how many want to be
[2:16:46] further consumed today

[2:16:51] out of me
[2:16:52] burn selfishness burn pride burn air
