[0:00] he said those that obtain that message
[0:02] in their hearts must lay in the presence
[0:04] of the sun to get ripened
[0:07] so who's the message what's the message
[0:08] and what's ripening
[0:11] amen are you with me remember the
[0:14] ministry of the bride
[0:16] is the same ministry of the groom
[0:20] not another ministry it's the same
[0:21] ministry
[0:24] all right so he said he said
[0:29] we've got to lay in the presence that
[0:30] you can pick up the message
[0:32] and then let the sun bake all the
[0:34] greenness out of you see making matured
[0:36] christians
[0:38] this is the end amen
[0:41] this is the end the wheat has come back
[0:43] to the weed again
[0:45] the word has come back to the full word
[0:47] again the revelation has come back the
[0:49] son of man to the son of man again
[0:52] only in bride form
[0:56] what stumbles the people is the form he
[0:58] comes in
[0:59] it's not another person it's the same
[1:01] person
[1:04] hallelujah if the bride would be another
[1:06] person she wouldn't be his wife
[1:10] she wouldn't be bribed because this
[1:13] bride i'm coming into it and back in the
[1:14] church aces again
[1:16] showing where you were before the
[1:18] foundation of the world
[1:20] that ought to be enough to surrender
[1:22] that ought to be enough to submit
[1:24] yourself
[1:27] after we get through here i trust that
[1:30] god will show you
[1:31] what it means to submit yourself to the
[1:33] promised word for the season
[1:35] that you see your hour in your time
[1:39] and the and the time that he promised it
[1:41] would be here
[1:42] it's not publicly known everywhere it's
[1:44] known to his people his bride
[1:46] they're the only ones that could receive
[1:48] it
[1:50] i don't say who's this bride this is
[1:52] bright it isn't bride i'm just glad the
[1:54] revelation of it's in my soul
[1:58] but i am united with the people that
[2:00] know he's the same today
[2:02] as he was yesterday not another person
[2:06] she's not another person
[2:09] she is him in another form
[2:13] because it was always in him
[2:17] to be bride
