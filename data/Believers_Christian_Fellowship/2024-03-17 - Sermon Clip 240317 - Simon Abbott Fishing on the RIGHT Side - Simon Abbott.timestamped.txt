[0:00] see they had their
[0:03] Nets on the left hand
[0:07] side I want you to it's so simple but it
[0:10] really it thrilled my soul but it's so
[0:13] simple they had their Nets on the left
[0:15] hand
[0:16] side on the left hand side of the boat
[0:18] why did they do that cuz they' always
[0:21] done it that way they'd always done it
[0:24] that way but you see they didn't
[0:26] particularly realize what was going on
[0:29] here
[0:30] they hadn't realized that now we've
[0:34] moved I'm going to draw a dotted line
[0:36] which is going to be the this is time
[0:39] yeah and here is time here now I'm I'm
[0:42] putting this overlapping and here's the
[0:43] cross I'm going to do it in dark here is
[0:46] the cross they haven't realized that
[0:48] we've now moved over into a whole new
[0:52] dispensation okay they have they and and
[0:55] the Lord is now saying remember he's
[0:57] called them to catch fish yeah fishes of
[1:00] men and now they're out fishing but you
[1:02] know on the left hand side well you know
[1:05] we're just going to do as we always did
[1:07] they haven't realize that now we've
[1:08] moved over into this new dispensation of
[1:10] time right and the fish that the Lord
[1:13] has called them to
[1:16] catch wasn't on the left hand side of
[1:19] the boat listen hey it wasn't on the
[1:22] left hand side the fish that he called
[1:26] them to was on the right hand side of
[1:29] the boat
[1:30] amen
[1:32] mate no longer are we supposed to cast
[1:35] The Net into Israel into the left hand
[1:38] side of the boat but the fish that the
[1:40] Lord wants to go with his bread of life
[1:43] is on the right hand side of the boat M
[1:46] that's so simple but hey come on there's
[1:49] a a new dispensation new time changed
[1:53] and they didn't get it they hadn't
[1:55] caught on to it and so the Lord called
[1:57] he doesn't say they're not Christians he
[2:00] says they're immature Christians there's
[2:02] nothing wrong with being immature
[2:03] Christian there's nothing wrong with the
[2:04] youngest kides and just just just just
[2:07] just praising the Lord and just being
[2:08] kids there's nothing wrong with that but
[2:11] there comes a time where we're called to
[2:12] something higher there's a new testament
[2:16] Bride on this hand side of the boat
[2:18] that's got to be
[2:20] caught
