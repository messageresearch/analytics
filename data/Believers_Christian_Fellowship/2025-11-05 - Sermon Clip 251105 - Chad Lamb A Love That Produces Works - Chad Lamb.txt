========================================

God was so pleased with his actions. Amen. And and brother said, "All Abraham's seed believes God like that." I tell you friends, I don't know that I always do, but I want to. And I believe I'm Abraham's seed, and I want to love him more than I love anything else. Why? BECAUSE HE FIRST LOVED ME. LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE FOR ME. I'M A NOBODY FROM NOWHERE. AND I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE IN THIS WORLD. I was a I WAS A RENEGADE. I WAS EVERYTHING ELSE AND TOSSED ABOUT AND AND AND IGNORANT AND BLIND AS CAN BE. AND GOD BROUGHT THIS MESSAGE TO ME AND HE OPENED MY EYES. HE REDEEMED ME AND HE DREW ME TO HIMSELF AND HE WHISPERED LOVE SECRETS IN MY EAR AND HE OPENED UP THE BACK PART OF HIS MIND. HE UNVEILED HIMSELF IN THE HIDDEN CHAMBER AND SHOWED ME WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING FOR 6,000 7,000 YEARS. EVEN BEFORE THAT, WHAT HIS PLAN WAS BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN? I KNOW THE SECRET THAT THE WHOLE WORLD DOESN'T KNOW. [screaming] AMEN. HOW COULD I NOT LOVE HIM? HOW COULD I NOT SERVE HIM? HOW COULD I TURN MY NOSE UP BECAUSE THE PROPHET SAYS SOMETHING THAT I DOESN'T THINK SOUND RIGHT WHEN GOD HAS BEEN SO GOOD TO ME? &gt;&gt; IT'S AN ARROGANT, SELFISH SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; I OWE HIM EVERYTHING. WHAT WHO WAS I THAT HE SHOULD COME AND REVEAL THE WORD TO ME? WHAT WISDOM DID I HAVE? WHAT INTELLIGENCE DID I HAVE? WHAT FAMILY CONNECTIONS DID I HAVE? I MEAN, WHAT WHAT WAS I? I WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. &gt;&gt; NOT EVEN A DOT ON THE MAP. NOT EVEN A NUMBER ON A TALLY SHEET SOMEWHERE. &gt;&gt; ONE OF EIGHT BILLION PEOPLE ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHO COULD FIND one out of eight billion? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF I PILED UP 8 billion anything here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't even know if it fit here. &gt;&gt; And you go pluck one out and tell you that one. You're precious to me and I love you and I'm going to tell you all my secrets. I'm going to draw you to myself and I'm going to I'm going to give you a glorified body and you're going to sit with me in my throne for a thousand years and you're going to be in the new heavens and new earth and you're GOING TO HAVE PERFECTION AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE PART OF ME. YOU'RE GOING TO BE AN EXPRESSION of me and we're going to come into a unity like nobody's ever seen before AND WE'RE GOING TO LIVE TOGETHER FOREVER. OH, WHAT WOULD THAT ONE LITTLE ITEM THAT'S PLUCKED OUT OF 8 BILLION FEEL ABOUT THE ONE WHO PLUCKED THEM OUT? YEAH, that's right. &gt;&gt; OH, GOD, HELP US NOT TO BE PROUD AND ARROGANT AND GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE think we deserved it or we were owed it or &gt;&gt; OR I WAS GOOD ENOUGH OR HE LIKED ME OR I HAD BEAUTIFUL EYES. &gt;&gt; We had nothing. This was purely based on his love and election, &gt;&gt; not only merit of our own. And it should put inside of us such a tremendous passionate love for him [clears throat] &gt;&gt; that if he ASKED ME TO DROP EVERYTHING and go to the other side of the planet tomorrow, I should be willing to do it though it cost me everything.
