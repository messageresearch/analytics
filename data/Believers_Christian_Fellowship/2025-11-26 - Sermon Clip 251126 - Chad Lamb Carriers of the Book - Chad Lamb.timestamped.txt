[0:01] AMEN. THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
[0:03] AMEN. WITH SO MUCH WHAT'S CALLED GOSPEL
[0:06] PREACHING IN THIS DAY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN
[0:08] THE WRONG DISPENSATION. AMEN. THEY'RE
[0:10] GOING BACK. AMEN. WHERE THE APOSTLES
[0:12] WERE WITNESSES. THERE'S NOT A THING
[0:13] WRONG WITH ANY OF THAT. BUT THE PROBLEM
[0:16] IS THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER DISPENSATIONAL
[0:18] CHANGE AT the end time. AND WE ARE NOW
[0:20] TRANSITIONED FROM CHURCH AGES TO END
[0:22] TIME. AND IN THE END TIME, there was
[0:24] ANOTHER WORK FOR CHRIST TO DO. AND IT
[0:27] was fulfilling the role OF KINSMAN
[0:28] REDEEMER, JUDGING AT THE GATE AND TAKING
[0:31] BACK THE BOOK THAT ADAM LOST. AND WE
[0:34] LIVE IN THAT DAY. AND WE'RE WITNESSES OF
[0:36] THESE THINGS.
[0:38] &gt;&gt; THESE ARE THE THINGS WE TESTIFY. THESE
[0:40] ARE THE THINGS we witness. This is what
[0:43] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT'S BRINGING LIFE TODAY.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALWAYS THE WORD FOR YOUR DAY THAT
[0:49] BRINGS LIFE. THE DISPENSATION OF CHRIST.
[0:51] IT'S THE SAME JESUS CHRIST THAT PAID THE
[0:54] PRICE 2,000 YEARS AGO IS THE SAME ONE
[0:56] WHO TOOK THE BOOK IN OUR GENERATION WHO
[0:59] LOOSED THE SEVEN SEALS AND BROUGHT IT
[1:01] DOWN TO MAN.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; And ye are witnesses of these things.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; WHO ELSE IS GOING TO WITNESS IT? WHAT
[1:12] OTHER CHURCH AGE? WHAT OTHER
[1:14] DISPENSATION? WHO ELSE ON THE PLANET IS
[1:16] GOING TO WITNESS WHAT OUR DISPENSATION
[1:18] IS AND WHAT MONUMENTALLY SHIFTED IN 1963
[1:21] AND WHAT CHRIST IS DOING NOW? WHO'S
[1:23] GOING TO WITNESS IT?
[1:25] &gt;&gt; If you and I DON'T EAT THE BOOK AND
[1:27] WITNESS AND PROPHESY AGAIN, THE WORLD IS
[1:30] STEEPED IN DARKNESS AND NOBODY KNOWS
[1:32] WHAT CHRIST IS DOING TODAY. ALL THEY
[1:34] KNOW IS A HISTORICAL JESUS CHRIST, BUT
[1:36] THEY DON'T KNOW A PRESENT TENSE JESUS
[1:38] CHRIST. AMEN. WHO IS THE REDEEMER WHO
[1:40] BOUGHT BACK ALL THAT ADAM LOST? AND WHEN
[1:43] HE BOUGHT BACK ALL THAT ADAM LOST, HE
[1:44] GOT HIMSELF A GENTILE BRIDE. AND IN
[1:46] ORDER TO FINISH THE REDEMPTION, HE'S GOT
[1:48] TO TAKE THAT BRIDE. AMEN. AND HE'S GOT
[1:50] TO SEW HIS SEED INTO THAT BRIDE. AND
[1:52] SHE'S GOT TO REPRODUCE THE SON OF MAN
[1:54] AGAIN.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; IF WE DON'T TESTIFY, WHO WILL?
[2:01] &gt;&gt; LUTHER'S AGE COULDN'T DO IT. WESLEY'S
[2:03] AGE COULDN'T DO IT. THE LEODYSIAN AGE,
[2:05] THE PENTECOSTAL AGE COULDN'T DO IT.
[2:07] AMEN. WE CAN'T WAIT FOR SOMEBODY IN THE
[2:09] FUTURE TO DO IT. YE ARE WITNESSES OF
[2:11] THESE THINGS.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; What you have HEARD AND SEEN IN
[2:15] DARKNESS, AMEN, TESTIFY IN THE LIGHT,
[2:17] WHAT GOD HAS REVEALED TO YOU IN YOUR
[2:19] INNER EAR, AMEN, OF YOUR SOUL. SHOUT IT
[2:22] FROM THE HOUSETOPS. AMEN. BECAUSE WE'RE
[2:24] NOT LOOKING BACK TO 2,000 YEARS AGO. BUT
[2:27] THERE'S A PRESENT TENSE MOVE OF GOD.
[2:29] THERE'S BEEN A DISPENSATIONAL CHANGE IN
[2:31] OUR GENERATION THAT'S BROUGHT US INTO A
[2:33] WHOLE ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST.
