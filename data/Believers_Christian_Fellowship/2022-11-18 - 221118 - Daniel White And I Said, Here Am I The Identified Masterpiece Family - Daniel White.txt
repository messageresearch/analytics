was really blessed by last night's service brother Alistair just um it was quite amazing how God works things out we were traveling to the service last night and uh we love to talk we love to fellowship amongst ourselves and as a as a part of the family of God and the uh the conversation come up as we were traveling to church about boundaries um ministering in someone else's uh pulford and um and uh brother Brown talks about it and and I said to them I said yeah you know there's one thing I'd like to know about how how brother Chad sees adoption and then when we got to church we got to the service last night my brother said well I'm going to preach on adoption I didn't need to ask for the chat after that because he was sitting right beside me he was just banging me on the leg you know big smile on his house and we were enjoying ourselves it was it was a real blessing and the Lord does things to encourage us and uh sometimes a minister will take any any small encouragement you you know you might think that's insignificant but to a minister that's huge so we we just take those little things and say thank you Lord amen amen let's um turn in our Bibles tonight to the Book of Genesis chapter 22. we we looked at this uh story last night uh sorry on Wednesday night I'd like to read from verse one you can put that slide up thanks brother the the thought that I want to take tonight is is taken from a verse we'll we'll get to it shortly but let's read from verse one and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son enclaved the wood of for the burnt offering and Rose up and went unto the place which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place are far off and Abraham said unto his young men abide here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you and Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said my father and he said here I am my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for the burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for I know for now I know that thou fearest God seeing that thou Hast not withheld thy son thy only son from me and then and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked behold behind him a ram caught in a Thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and Abraham called the name of the place Jehovah-jireh as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word as you take your seats amen you thankful to be here tonight amen amen it's wonderful to be in the presence of the Lord and come here to worship Him amen and spirit and in truth amen I'd just like to take a thought from here as the the scripture has said here but I've I've we know that Abraham said but I want to place this into our own lives tonight because I think it's important that we look at the word not not as something that of history but something that is happening in our lives present tense amen so I want to take where where Abraham Abraham said here I am we want to put this into our own lives and and I said here am I amen and as a as a subtopic he would just like to look at the identified masterpiece family amen so we we understand that the prophet when he first preached Masterpiece he titled it Masterpiece that was in 640705 and then in 64 1205 he's he preached the message the identified masterpiece so the first thing that he preached was the Masterpiece the second second service that he took on this thought he he titled the identified Masterpiece amen so the the the preeminent um thought here is that there is a masterpiece but this masterpiece is not unidentified this masterpiece is identified he didn't say I'm I'm preaching on the unidentified Masterpiece the first thing he did was to reveal that there was a masterpiece the second thing he did was to reveal that there is a an identified Masterpiece amen it's one thing to know that there is a masterpiece but then it's another thing to know that this masterpiece is actually identified amen and we as we saw on Wednesday night this is not something that we can rely on our pastors Revelation our father's Revelation our wives Revelation we've got to have this Revelation for ourself of the identified Masterpiece amen we we looked at this story here in Genesis 22 on Wednesday night how God in in verse 1 told Abraham about a place that he had provided for him to worship and he told him the general direction of it that it was in the land of Moriah and God had provided this place for Abraham to Worship in and I think this is really important for our lives because God has provided us a place of worship and God will not accept your worship outside of that place amen it doesn't matter what type of things we might think but this requires us to surrender our own thoughts to come into the very manifested thoughts of God so that our worship can be accepted amen I I think it's a it's a shame it's a it's a a shame when we can go to all this trouble but then our worship not be accepted amen just refreshing ourselves here a little bit from Wednesday night but God when when David went to bring the ark back to the Lord the idea was right but the way he did it was wrong he had the right idea but he did it the wrong way and the reason that he did it the wrong way is because he was influenced by a denominational spirit and he thought that he could do what they did but God has a place God has a way that he wants to be worshiped and he will allow others to worship however they want to worship but he will not allow his elect to worship the way that they desire to worship God desires us to worship him the way that he desires to be worshiped amen and that is why the prophet of God said that that that he that God had to reject the whole thing because David did one thing wrong in the way that he bought the art that the word back he put it on a new cart he had to reject the whole thing amen so we we want to do what God wants us to do God's way Amen in God's provided place of worship amen that that's where we want to be that's where we need to be so God had had told Abraham that he'd provided a place and that place was going to be revealed in verse 2 uh God Abraham went to that place that God had told him of in verse 3 Abraham saw that place um that God had told him of and then in verse 9 Abraham came to that place that God had now revealed um where he's worshiped Abraham's worship was going to be accepted from amen so we are thankful we are thankful in this hour that God has revealed his thoughts to us amen because without his thoughts being revealed there's not a lot of chance for us to be able to be worshiping knowing that God was accepting our worship amen there should not be a question in our minds whether God is accepting our worship or not because the thoughts of God have been revealed amen Abraham didn't have the question I don't know if God's going to accept what I'm doing you know no he was doing what God had asked him to do in God's provided place amen he was doing what God had asked him to do in God's provided place I like I like this thought because Abraham learned from his first experience remember God spoke to Abram and said Abraham leave thy father and of my mother and go to a land in which I will show you and Abraham took lot but God didn't take say to take lot that God took Lord Abraham took lot right but we understand that when Abraham came to the place where he was about to enter into this place where God had provided for him he said you stay here and I and the lad will go right because he took two servants with him but they could only come so far all right because God this was God Abraham's provided place of worship amen sir we thank God for this opportunity that he has given us to have a confidence in what we are doing in the place in which we are knowing that God is in fact accepting our worship I I think it would be a a pitiful thing to come to a place like this and go to all this trouble and spend all this money and then wonder whether God is accepting our worship or not amen but we are thankful in this hour that the mind of God has been revealed to us amen we see here in um I don't know if you've still got your Bibles open to Genesis 22. I just want to take a couple of thoughts here um from Genesis 22 we see here looking at verse 11 that Abraham is responding to the voice of God from a different position that he responded to the voice of God in verse 1. okay if you look at verse 1 Genesis 22 1 and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here am I it was the same Abraham the same voice but a different place all right we can go down to verse 11. um Genesis 22 11 and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I all right so it was the same voice the same Abraham but his position had changed amen it's it's like the Lord spoke to John and in Revelations chapter 3 and the spirit of the lord caught John up and took John to a higher place it was the same voice that was speaking to him in Revelations 3 that was speaking to him in Revelation 4. all right but his position had changed amen and the emphasis is on the position amen all right you can see there in verse 1 the the here is a in a in a lower font it's just a it's not if you look at verse 11 it's in a capital here is in a capital so the emphasis is the position right here am I here am I all right this this place that Abraham was was now responding to the to the same voice was a revelation to him he knew where he was he knew where he stood he knew that he was in God's provided place of worship here am I amen here at my the place was a revelation to him and so was Abraham a revelation unto himself amen amen amen the last thing God wants is for you to be dependent upon your pastor for the revelation of yourself amen God wants you to be a revelation to yourself amen he said that's his desire for you he doesn't want you relying upon your pastor your pastor's revelation of you he wants God wants you to have a revelation of yourself but he also wants you to have a revelation of the place in which you are operating from amen the place in which you stand the place the place like the place that Abraham was now standing it was a revelation to him it was something that God had revealed to him it was something that God was sorry Abraham was now in Union with him with that place amen and as we saw on Wednesday night in that place all things are possible in that place all things are possible in that place you reach your full potential in that place you reach your full purpose amen we thank God Amen it's a it's a it's a revelation that place is a revelation God called Abraham the Lord calls us by the opening of the word by the revealing of the word God calls us and we respond to the opening of the word he doesn't call us as in our literal name but he opens the word in the opening of the word calls the elect unto itself amen so God God is still calling yes it's very obvious in my life that God is still calling amen so when the when the when the mystery of the word is revealed it calls it unto itself when when God took a part of Adam and created his his wife and then God bought the wife to Adam his wife Adam's wife to himself Adam was speaking to a part of himself amen amen Adam wasn't speaking to anything else he wasn't speaking to the chimpanzee or the lion or anything else that everything else was not designed to respond to the word amen it was only the part that came out of Adam that it was God had designed to respond to the word that was coming from the part from him in whom she came out of amen and that is what they select God has designed you this way amen all right we're going to look think about a design a little bit tonight God has designed you specifically because of who he is and because of where you come from because you're a part of him you are designed to respond to the word amen and it doesn't matter what God asks of you you are designed to respond to the word that's that Faith seed right we we cannot understand carnally how Abraham was willing as he was to take his son his only son and go and sacrifice his son his only son but we understand that there is a faith seed a royal seed within Abraham that God had so desired to respond to the word amen amen and that's what you are oh that's what you are ordained of God to do as a part of him is to respond to the word amen people might think that God's requests are unreasonable amen but we don't consider God's requests from our logic or from our mind we simply respond to the word all right where where vashti failed Esther didn't because as vashti considered the request through her logic through her mind all right but but when it was Esther's time to enter into that place there was an un an unheard voice that was calling her unto himself and as unreasonable as it might seem she didn't consider it no she just simply walked in amen amen amen and that's what this elected bride is ordained to do in the hour in which we are living in in this hour today God is calling his elect by the opening of the word amen so we thank God for what he's doing in our life we can think about this on a natural level that the only way that my wife has the position that she has is one because the word that was spoken to her two because she accepted the word that was spoken to her because she could not be my wife unless first the invitation came but she also could not be then the door was opened the opportunity was given to her to become right but then she had to accept that invitation and say here I am here I am here am I hey man what what what was Abraham was a revelation unto himself here am I it's both position and identification here am I here am I when my wife said yes she was saying here am I amen it's a it's a it's a revelation it's a revelation of the word it's a revelation of who you are in Christ amen we are super thankful yes to God for who we can say we are and where we stand because we could not be Who We Are and we could not stand where we stand without God in our lives without God doing what he has done in our lives I could not stand where I stand amen Abraham could say the same thing there is no way possible that Abraham could do what he'd done and be where he was without God revealing his provided place of worship amen amen here I am so we want to look at this tonight the identified masterpiece here I am amen the identified masterpiece family I'm a member of God's family amen here am I amen we must be a revelation unto ourself amen amen this quotation here the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expresses it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest or if the church could only knew its position and will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is amen where are we at bride I meant where are we at here am I amen we are at this place amen we are at this place that she knows who she is and she knows where she stands here am I hey man what what what will you do when when all that group come together what is that group it's the Masterpiece family I'm at the Masterpiece family will have the same Revelation as one another amen here am I wonderful wonderful God is good amen amen amen so tonight I hope this doesn't seem like a bit of a deviation from the thought here but I just want to look at this in a natural sense from the things that man has has been able to accomplish in our day because man has accomplished some to me unaccomplishable things that it's like the supernatural it's like man has naturally entered into the supernatural in a natural sense in a carnal sense and I want to look at this tonight because it's um very I think it's very important you know when when the man landed on the on the moon you know brother Branham talked about how we've entered into that astronaut age and he he talked about those things but I I don't know if anybody has been aware of I assume you would of what NASA has accomplished um after 10 years of putting these things together but they have sent uh a telescope called the James Webb Telescope on the 25th of December 2021 into into the into the orbit um so they launched this telescope it's called the the James uh web telescope and I'm just going to take a few things a few thoughts from here um it's truly miraculous what what they've done is just absolutely outstanding I don't know if you've you've thought about it or looked into it or not but um it's really really tremendous it's this is just a little um one minute um motion picture of this of what they've done with or the unfolding of this of this telescope just to give you a little bit of an idea of of what man is achieving brother Franco helped me with this this was about three minutes or four minutes long and he managed to shorten it down for me to about a minute so it took 10 years to make started in 2011 so you can see here that it's it's unfolding it's developing things are coming into place okay so hopefully you can see this okay yeah that's all right so we see this this telescope here is 1.5 million kilometers from Earth or 9 932 000 miles from Earth so man has achieved miraculous sings this telescope had to be positioned correctly you can see on the screen there hopefully you see a ll2 that's a position that they had chosen for this um this telescope to be sent to it was the best position they could find where the the things were the the currents and different things were at their minimal okay so now you've got to think about this because they were developing something on Earth to be placed 1.5 or 930 930 000 miles away so they were developing this on Earth but it's its purpose was not on Earth but its purpose was to be sent to another place and it was going to fulfill its purpose in that place the telescope was designed to meet all sorts of different challenges one of those challenges being the Heat another one of those challenges is being the cult but the the point here that I'm I'm making is that the telescope was designed to operate in a particular position but in that position the telescope was going to encounter certain challenges so it was designed specifically to meet the challenges that were related to the position that it was being sent to all right so I can tell that you're starting to put the pieces together here that's good amen so if it was not designed correctly then it would not be able to do what it was ordained to do I I think the value of this thing was 10 billion dollars and it took 10 years to make but they were confident enough to be able to design this for to live in a in a atmosphere that nothing had ever lived and nothing had ever been so it was now in a position where man had never sent anything this far from Earth ever before so for the first time man had created something to take a position that man had never set never been able to do up until now all right so if this is what man can do what about what God is doing right this is not something that we're looking at that they're going to do this is something that they've done all right so if this is what man has done what has God done amen what has God done what if man can establish these such miraculous things I mean this just blows my mind I my my mind can't comprehend these things how they can how how that thing begin to unfold and develop in that position uh say it like this it came to maturity in the position that it was ordained to take outside of that position it could not come to maturity but it had to come to maturity over a period of time I think that thing that you saw within a minute took three months in real life it took three months in real life to to Lifetime to to come to to its full maturity and then be able to do what it was ordained to do that there once it was there um that there was adjustments that needed to be made and all those gold hexagon shaped things all those were were adjustable so once it was there it was adjustable so that it could do what it was ordained to do all right so man has established many things but God has God is the greater power here as as great as what this is God is the greater power if this is great God is greater amen amen if if what man has done is great what God has done is greater because God has sent a people to live in a Time that Darkness has never gripped the Earth like it has as this time amen this is what God has done this was sent but God has also sent a people onto this Earth to live under a condition in a condition that that the world has not been before but the point here is that God is the one who designed you in such a way that you will meet the challenges of this day and that God does not design anything and that thing fail this has a life expectancy of I think it's around three to five years but but this has a life expectancy of around eternity amen so so God has God is a miraculous God this is why not on a natural level they are achieving the supernatural to me because this is I can't achieve this but they they they can you know one of the quotes that one of the um technicians who put this together he said one day we want to be building these things in in the place that they're going to work think about this and you think my goodness I mean these guys have a vision these guys have a vision this started as a vision right that I mean they want to be they want to build this thing 1.5 million miles away 1.5 million kilometers away yeah so God has a greater Vision than that amen amen and God is revealing his vision for you little by little and as he's as he's revealing his vision for you you are developing you are becoming what God has ordained you before the foundation of the world to become amen never before are we living in an age that fatherhood is as difficult as what it is never before are we living in an age where motherhood meets has meets a the challenge that it is ever before never before I as a husband I have that never before has there been a husband on earth that is meeting the challenges that I have to meet and it's the same with my wife but but God has designed me to be here God has designed my wife to be here God has designed my children to be here he has ordained them to be here and he has ordained them to meet the challenges of this lady a sin dark wretched age in which we are living in amen God has ordained a people to be here a special people a supersede people is there anyone here tonight that can say here am I amen here am I amen we must be a revelation to ourself because if we're not a revelation to ourself then fear will come in and fear will will will try and get you to doubt it will cause you to doubt that you can meet the challenges of this hour but if you know that God has ordained you for this day then you know that God has ordained you to meet the challenges of this day amen God has designed you to meet the challenge of this day God has designed you to meet every challenge of this day God is a danger to reach your maturity amen we are not self-ordained amen we are not self-designed amen we are God ordained and God designed and God Chosen and God positioned amen it's it's God who is behind all this someone's behind all this you know it's but NASA ain't behind this amen there's someone greater than NASA here amen his name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen he is behind this amen I I can't help you I but I need to let you know I'm not alone it's not me that doeth the works it's not me that can help you but he who is in me can help me amen there's more to me than me there's more to me than what you see on the outside amen amen God has designed you to meet the challenge of this day but how are we going to do that right what what what's God going to cause us to do remember those bits that were coming out and folding out and they're all coming into their position how is God gonna what's God gonna cause me to do because it's not me causing me to do it right what's God going to cause me to do to be able to meet the challenge of the day all right what did God cause Abraham to do it wasn't Abraham who caused Abraham to do what he did no it was God Amen there was someone behind it amen there was an unseen Force if we looked at Abraham all we saw is Abraham if we had a revelation of Abraham we'd know that there's another Force other than the force of Abraham and unseen force that was causing Abraham to do what he was ordained to do amen and there's an unseen force in the building tonight amen there's an unseen force in your life tonight there's an unseen force in my life tonight am at this court that's going to cause me to do what I'm ordained to do so that I can come to full maturity and be who I am ordained to be to the fullest amen brothers sisters there ain't going to be no husband on this earth like me absolutely well you can say what about me that's okay but I can't speak for you I can only speak for myself amen and I that there's going to be no husband on this earth like this husband there's going to be no father on this earth like this father not because of me all right because there's an unseen Force there's an unseen person there's a person that you don't see here tonight that is doing what I he's causing me to do what I'm doing brothers and sisters I should never have been a minister no sir no sir my first sermon that I preached was 15 minutes long you know that was the longest that I've ever spoken without stopping in my entire life never before have I spoken for more than 15 minutes my throat was so sore I had to stop by all accounts I should not be here the same as by all accounts David should not have been on that Battlefield Moses should not have been the deliverer but there was an unseen Force Sarah should not have been the one that that Faith's child was going to come through but God had chosen her and God has chosen you and God is ordained you don't look at you look at him amen there's someone other than you here tonight amen that is going to cause you to be the best husbands that there has been on Earth the best wives that has been on Earth he is going to cause you to be that we might say but right then I'm not that yet well nor am I but I'm becoming amen amen and I have a confidence that I'm going to become to my full maturity amen because of who is in me [Applause] amen greater is he that is in me then he that is trying to stunt my potential he is the greater force he's the greater force in my wife he's the greater force in my children yes sir I I I don't have a problem I don't have a concern I don't have a fear of whether my children are going to make it or not I don't because I know I believe that within them is the same one who's in me and it is no secret what God can do what he's done for me he can do for them amen if he can save me and cause me to be who I am today then surely they're in a better position than I am already amen and amen what's he going to cause us to do that's right brother then preacher what are we going to do tell you what we're going to do we're going to surrender [Music] yes sir well that's a bit of an anti-climax I thought we're going to get some banners and you know I am the elect I am the elect no we're gonna surrender that's it there's victory in surrender now that's a paradox because if you surrender in war you defeat it right but God don't God God works by paradoxes amen when we the more we surrender the more we become Victorious as her brother Alistair was saying last night the more that we surrender the more we become Victorious we will be we will be victorious to the level that we surrender if you choose to surrender at this level that's the level you will be victorious don't expect to be this Victorious when you've only surrendered to this level to the level that you surrender is the level that you will be victorious that's why Abraham was fully surrendered to the word of the Lord he was fully surrendered to the word of the Lord for his day in offering Isaac as a sacrifice because he knew that who this was he knew that this the promise of God was connected to that to his son and he knew if he had of killed him God would have to raise him up again he'd already spoken to I and the son will return unto you yeah amen Abraham didn't say that because he had another plan [Music] Abraham didn't say I and the lad will return because he had a he had another he had another option it wasn't in Abraham's thinking Abraham knew what God was able to do Abraham knew God's word he knew who he was he knew who his son was and he knew that if if Isaac was going to die on that altar God would have to rise him up again and they'd walk back down the hill together and meet the servants and go home Abraham was the father of his household [Music] where was Sarah at this time the prophet of God said he said Abraham never told Sarah because there's some things that the woman ain't meant to carry there's some things that are only for the father of the family amen we're not going there tonight you have to wait till tomorrow don't you preach that brother Alistair that's got a copyright tool tomorrow praise the Lord amen what are we going to do we're going to surrender that that's that's what God is causing us to do in in my life God's causing me to surrender to the fact that he chose me to minister his word [Music] surrender yeah I've been surrendered but a complete surrender fully surrendered just Lord okay okay if if this is your will for my life I surrender to it amen amen I I I give up trying to fight it but God is going to cause each one of us to surrender to the will of God for our lives not just the minister and the musician and the song leaders but every single one of us every member of the body of Christ at some point will be completely sold out completely surrendered to the will of God for their lives meant because it's only by that complete surrender that we see God fully when you fully surrender what that means is if you surrender to a 50 level you'll probably see God to a 50 level but our desire is to express him yes our desire is to for him to manifest himself in our lives not in a portion I'm sorry but I'm not happy with 80 percent I I Lord consume me Lord amen so so you don't see me at all and and but what that's going to take is a complete surrender to the will of God for our lives the will of God is the word of God for our lives for our day we can't surrender to Moses message we can't surrender to Noah's message Moses couldn't have surrendered to Noah's message Noah that vice versa there was a word for their day and there's a word for our day all right brother Jonathan said in the prayer there's a there's a word for our day we're so thankful for it it's everything to me it's life to me but I've got to surrender to it so that that word can manifest itself through this body through this instrument of clay this vessel of clay amen and amen we we are not victims of this age there's only two types of people in this world and that's victims or people who are victorious we are not victims at least we should not be victims God has not ordained his elect to be victims oh um you know wowzy was brother Jewel four he would say yeah it's it's not we should not feel sorry for ourselves amen we're Victorious we're not victims you were built for this challenge this is your time this is your day this is your hour God designed you for this time and you're gonna meet the challenge of this day because God is causing you to fully surrender to the word for your day a full surrender amen that's what God is doing in our life Moses was born for his time Abraham was born for his time Sarah was born for her time Isaac was born for his time Rebecca was born for her Time Mary was born for her time Hannah was born for her time Jesus was born for his time Paul was born for his time William Branham was born for his time but let's not forget that you are born for this time amen we can go through history but we've got to lift the God out of History by realizing that you are born for this time you were born for this day let's refine it a little bit more you are born for this hour [Music] this hour I think it's 8 30. you were born for this hour this moment it doesn't matter how many websites people want to put up it don't matter how many videos they want a place of why I left the message what's that got to do with me why why do we even spend time listening to someone's testimony of why I left the message I got no idea no I don't have enough time to do what I need to do without listening to that [Applause] I mean I was born for this time it just shows that you're not born for this time but I was born for this time I was born to receive this message I born to surrender to the challenges of this hour of this word amen hallelujah hallelujah submarine churches the prophet of God says he says according to Romans 4 16 we find that God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed amen and Paul puts himself and all believers under that designation because he says Abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on to not only narrow down his definition but rather to finalize it for in Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with Jesus and accounted the seed children as children of promise and promise as having to do with election or the choosing of God and that is exactly what we have been saying these who are of the royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated for known of God and were in the mind of God and His Thoughts Amen in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in its designated decreed season right amen this is your season this is your time amen Eternal attributes of God expressed and manifested in flesh this is your time this is your season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride amen is there anyone here like Abraham who can say here am I amen that here am I the literal spoken word seed bride here am I I'm standing in Christ with my true identification as here am I Lord you called here am I oh my we don't respond to a man core we respond to a god call amen and God is calling his elect and bringing them into a position as the spoken word seed bride with their true identification here am I amen here am I am at both position and identification amen amen another little thing here how did the telescope get to where it was meant to get it did not get there by its own power it has a power the telescope has a power within itself to correct its position if it gets out of position I think it might be 26 Rockets around it so if it gets spun around or moved incorrect into a wrong position it can be repositioned but it did not come to that position by its own strength or buy its own bill own ability it was carried there amen it was carried there it was carried in this rocket you can see it right up the top there it was carried there and then it was by by the power of that rocket it was able to take its position brothers and sisters we we aren't we are not self-positioned and nor are we self-propelled [Music] we cannot position ourself there's an unseen Force here tonight amen amen that that is willing if you're not in your position he is here willing to position you when you accept the Revelation or the invitation I should say to come up higher amen yeah and then John was not self-propelled John was propelled by an unseen Force he says behold and I was caught up in the spirit that what took him there was a revelation it was a revelation to him amen and what is positioned us must be a revelation to us amen you don't you think my wife of 28 years doesn't know who positioned her she can point to him God yes she can point to him and say he put me there I didn't do it he did it I didn't self-position myself he positioned me and this is what the spoken word bride can do is that she has a revelation of how she got to where she got amen she has a revelation of how she got to where she got amen and this is this it must be a revelation to you because if it's not then you the devil will be able to convince you otherwise that you are self-positioned this is why a minister must know that he's positioned by God otherwise he'll question his his ministry constantly and then the people will question his ministry as a result of him questioning his position amen hey man so you've got to know that you know but brothers and sisters this is not something we can reveal to ourself amen it's a revelation from God that God is the one who caused me to be here when David went under the battlefield he just didn't go under the battlefield in his own strength the Venom said he waited for the rustling in the mulberry tree so he was walking out as insignificant as he was of that little Ruddy guy but he was expressing a confidence that Saul couldn't Express being Head and Shoulders above him David was confident it caused Saul to say hey whose son is this how come he's walking with the confidence that he is where is he I mean where is he getting that from because he knew that it couldn't be coming from self right because he was just a little nothing little righty guy the prophet would say but there was a confidence that David was expressing that came from a hidden power that was with David the prophet of God said it wasn't David who bought Goliath down right no it was the hidden power that was with David that bought Goliath down I mean we're not going to bring the Goliath down of our age no it's it's the hidden power that is within you that is going to cause the Goliath of your age to be under your feet [Music] amen when you surrender to him he will put Satan under your feet it's not you putting Satan under your feet he will put Satan under your feet when you surrender to him [Music] I want Satan so far under my feet that he can't even talk yeah I don't want to be standing on his foot or you know I know this is like symbolic but we understand what I mean it me it means that he's under our Dominion he no longer has dominion over us but we have dominion over him you speak when I say speak you walk when I say walk you sneeze when I say sneeze other than that you are under my dominion and you will not do anything you have no power over me that's where God is going to put Satan is under the elect feet under the spoken word bride's feet God has chosen to put Satan amen amen and we might we might try and make that choice ourselves but what you're going to find is that you know he it's not possible you might think you have him and then you find out he's over here well he's not under your feet if he's over here you know what I mean we try to do things of our in our own strength and sometimes we yeah I did it and you find out no you didn't no you didn't unless God does it it's not done amen and if God don't do it no one can do it not even you can do it amen there's things that God has reserved for himself to do hey man Abraham could not provide the ram but he said God will provide for himself a sacrifice so he knew that there was things reserved for God and only God could do those things and in our lives we understand God has reserved things for himself to do in me through me amen so she's not she she's she's not self-positioned but she's positioned by God himself she's positioned by the power of the Holy Ghost yes she has no power of her own but her power but her power is the same power that made it possible for David to overcome it sounded like a paradox it sounded like I tripped over my words but I did it she has no power of her own but the power that she does have is the same power that allowed David to take down Goliath David had no power of his own but the power he did have was had enough power within itself to overcome and take down the Goliath amen I am powerless and yet I'm full of power I'm powerless and yet I'm full of power I have no power and yet I'm full of power amen why because there's a hidden Force amen there's something other than you here tonight amen there's something other than me here tonight and that is the Unseen force is Jesus Christ in you [Applause] person of the word good greater is he it is in you amen greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen greater is he the power it's the Lord that's why David's testimony was the Lord will deliver you into my hands David is saying well I'm I'm going to take you down man oh David said the Lord will deliver you into my hands amen it was the two two it was the negative and the positive working together and that greater is he that is in me he is the positive I am the negative and together creates power amen and together Satan is taken down greater is he greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you know Satan is great he's powerful but greater greater greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world what would the scripture is saying here is that he that is in you is more powerful than he that is in the world he is powerful but he that is in you is more powerful than he he is the greater force there is no Force like him on Earth there is no more no greater power than him on Earth and he happens to be in you [Music] what you're worried about little bride what you fear and for little Bry ant amen let me remind you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen amen here am I here am I greater is he that is in me that he that is in the world this is a revelation you know that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world that's a revelation here am I amen that that Revelation is calling to me and it's calling for a response amen oh what would it be like brothers if you're speaking to your wife and your wife never never talk back you had a silent life you know he was talking talking you and you you're saying all these things but you're wanting a response I don't have that problem by the way my wife loves to hear me talk to her in fact she complains when I don't talk enough which is pretty often but God wants a response yeah amen the same as God wanted us response in in Genesis 22 1 and Genesis 22 11 God wanted a response he was calling God wants a response because the revelation of the word is calling amen amen and there's got to be a people who rise up and say it don't matter what it looked like it don't matter how great he is it don't matter how big his shield is in his Spirit etc etc greater is here am I Lord foreign amen amen we thank God for the ability to be able to respond amen because we can't even lay claim to that God placed the receiver in you and a responder amen you can receive the word and then you can respond to the word amen Amen brother this is the the closer you get to the Lord the more you realize is by Grace I am saying amen hallelujah amen amen Esther was not self-positioned her King positioned her and this is why when the going got tough as we say she put on her royal garments because she knew she was she was meeting a challenge a challenge had come up that she knew that she couldn't face it by herself the Temptation was there oh yes it was because we are the reality of Esther she's she's my shadow all right so I know what Esther was thinking she was trying to think of a way how to deal with the challenge that had presented itself in her life was she gonna this was her time this this was a this this was her time like vashti had her time this was her time what was she gonna do the challenge seemed unreasonable but this was her time this was her Proving Ground this is where she was going to take another step higher from where she was she was going to go into the Heavenly places she was going to mature even more than what she had matured she was going to come to her potential by this challenge do not be afraid of the challenges that you are facing these challenges are designed to bring you to your potential to bring you to full maturity as fathers as husbands they don't get caught up in the group thing all right to put your blinkers on I'm the only one here as Fathers as as mothers as wives as husbands God is going to bring you the full maturity through the challenges that you face as a husband [Music] as a single as a widow as a grandfather as a grandmother as a as a son as a daughter that challenges that you face are designed by God Amen amen they are allowed by God because that challenge is given to you to bring you to your potential because you do not know your potential I do not know my potential as a minister but you've ministered yeah but I don't know my potential I'm becoming and I trust with every meeting that every every time I Minister I become more I become more because I did not know my potential one at some point we won't have these things we could be preaching from prisons right we may not have our air-conditioned officers we might not have a Bible we might have nothing but we're never without nothing because greater is he that is in use and he that is in the world amen greater is he that is in you than he that will take your Bible greater is he that is in you than he that will that will that will confiscate all message material oh brother and sister when we get to that place we're ready for that place don't fear it when we get to that place we are ready for that place Hallelujah Esther was ready for this challenge I don't I don't know what I'd do without the table program well you're gonna find out because at some point you're not going to have it just a flick of a switch boom I don't think this generation could go back to books we've had it too easy too long I I remember my dad's Concordance oh Maya am a big heavy thing goodness man I don't know how they did it did it but I'm glad they did because God God made it possible for them to be able to search through those concordances and now all we do is done but soon we're not going to have it and we're not going to be able to go back to books because we're too programmed electronically but you are you God is challenging you as a father God is challenging me as a father God is challenging my wife as a mother God is challenging my daughter as a daughter God is challenging my son as a son God is challenging me as a husband God is challenging my wife as a wife because as a husband God wants me to come to full maturity amen and that can't happen without the challenges unfortunately but as to put on her royal garments what was she doing she was testifying of her revelation it wasn't just a good idea I mean it was but it wasn't just a good idea it was much more than that it was an expression of her revelation that I did not put myself here I did not position myself yeah and this is what we need to understand as fathers and mothers and and wives and husbands I did I am I am not self-positioned it was god who caused me to become a husband it was god who caused me to become a father and it is God because when I come to that challenge I remember who positioned me in the offices that I hold I cannot meet the challenge myself to be the wife to my to be the husband to my wife that I need to be it's not possible I've tried and failed and you will too because it's not possible but what is impossible for man is possible for God amen it's impossible for me to be the father that I need to be to my children in the age that I live in without God without the Unseen force in my life it is not possible for me to be the father that I'm ordained to be just as impossible as it was for David to take down Goliath without the Unseen Force without that hidden power in David's life it was not possible and it is not possible for a wife to be the wife of her husband as she ought to be without that hidden power in her life it's just not possible you've got to come to that conclusion and that's what you've got to surrender to and if you think that you can make it without it you're going to find out that you can't make it without it and you're going to come back to this service and think I was told this right amen because it is the absolute truth [Applause] it's as much as an absolute as what it was without the the message of Elijah the revelation of the message of Elijah coming to the woman in First Kings 17 without that Revelation she was going to die the same curse that the world was gonna die but because God sent a message to her and within that message had the power to cause her to be what she was ordained to be and she was ordained to be a mother to her son but she could not be it without the revelation of the message notice now God has put me up on this many times I did not say without the message I said without the revelation of the message and then without the revelation of the message I cannot be to my wife who I'm ordained to be I cannot be to my daughter who I'm ordained to be I cannot be to my church who I'm ordained to be without the revelation of the word for my day the whole revelation of the word the book is open it is not partially open the book is open the Seven Seals have been loosed it's the time of fullness not partiality but fullness the full revelation of the word the revelation of the person of Jesus Christ in our lives amen let's not forget how we got to where we got amen you know and yet sometimes we trip ourselves up sometimes we take credit for things we shouldn't take credit for as a pastor sometimes you take credit for things you shouldn't take credit for as a husband as a father etc etc you've got to realize I had nothing to do with this [Music] it's not it's not me it's that this is this is the this is the problem that Israel had because they sung a song to David Saul had killed his thousands was it and David his tens of thousands missed it missed it wasn't David it was a hidden Force there was a hidden power amen and the moment we bring credit to ourself well God won't share his glory with anyone you know he he he he um practices his own word he does he spoiled the rodents spare the spare the rod spoil the child yeah well he applies that to me he applies that scripture to my life I mean sometimes we need a little bit of a touch-up you know a little bit of putting in line you know job did the same thing he began to give himself credit but God sent a messenger called Eli and God spoke through that man that's why it's good for ministers to be ministered to and I speak sorry Brothers it's good for this minister to be ministered to because sometimes this Minister needs realigning and sometimes God will use a minister in our own Fellowship to okay Lord you're speaking to me thank you thank you amen so now what was the purpose of this this was sent there for a particular purpose and it was designed to for a particular purpose remembering that it was also sent to take a certain position and in that position it was going to accomplish its purpose outside of that position it was not going to accomplish its purpose so it had to be in its particular position in order to accomplish its purpose Brethren talks about how the the tribes when they went over into Israel that they they had a designated position that they had to take he said Ephraim couldn't raise corn in manasseh's corner he had to stay within the boundary that God had given Ephraim had to stay in the boundary that God had given Ephraim NASA had to stay in the boundary within the boundaries that God had given her given given them so we understand that we we have a particular position that God has given us and God wants to accomplish certain things through Us in that position right right but we've got to be sure that we're staying in our position this will this will here's a few slides of what this telescope um has the pictures that it's taken quite amazing so what man has done here he's captured pictures through this instrument and bought the pictures down to earth so that we can see them they've captured the Unseen because these cannot be seen by the natural eye otherwise 10 billion dollars is wasted all right so this instrument was designed on a natural level to catch the Unseen and bring the Unseen to Earth so the thing that was unseen can be seen all right and this is why this is this is amazing because what man is achieving is only a reflection it's only a portion of what God has done yeah amen because God God operates and man follows man doesn't follow and God operate man doesn't man doesn't go ahead of God and God follows man no man is following the progression of God man is following the condescending of God is what man is following amen so for the first time in the the history of this Earth we are able to see things that have never been seen wow I find this astonishing I love this stuff as someone who did year 10 twice and failed both times I love this stuff okay if you go outside tonight in the darkness of night you won't see this image because these images cannot be seen in their natural position by the natural eye it takes an instrument to reveal the invisible things of God so what we can say here is that men is fellowshipping with a mystery natural man is fellowshipping with a natural mystery that they are studying the mystery right this this this mystery has an immense amount of detail and you can never come to the end of this mystery if you look them up on your screen at home on a high definition uh screen you can study that you can study one image for hours on end and come back later and find a place that you hadn't seen before yeah all right so so man is bringing has has made up God has made it possible for man to bring the things in a in a natural life that are invisible down to us so that they can see we can sit so what was in the heavens God has made it possible for man to bring to the Earth and see what was a mystery is now revealed to whoever wants to look at it amen what we are seeing here are the thoughts of God that was spoken in Genesis 1. it just keeps getting better this is the thoughts of God expressed the thoughts of God that went from thought to word to manifestation we are looking at the manifestation of the thoughts of God we are fellowshipping with the manifestation of the thoughts of God because now we can see it you can't have fellowship with something you can't see but when you can see something you can have fellowship with something this has a message it is a message it's telling you that there's an unseen Force and it ain't the Big Bang Theory or whatever other Theory but it's a god it's God and God said let there be that was an unseen force that was Elohim existing by himself let there be and there was is testifying that it had a creator because the creation must have a Creator amen so it's testifying that there is someone greater than me there's an unseen Force one of the brothers in the fellowship at home said it it looks like chaos but the best that we can describe it he said is Controlled Chaos because every Star was positionally placed [Music] amen so because there was an instrument sent what that instrument did was it revealed things that were positionally placed amen we thank God for this amen we thank God for this we ask we are seeing the thoughts of God amen when they saw them they did not become material but they saw what was material the same as when Abraham walked to the mountain that God had chosen when he saw it it didn't come become material it was already there because it was created in Genesis 1. wonderful they were all they were there all the time just undiscovered the Mysteries that being there all the time just not seen amen the mystery was there all the time just not seen but God has allowed man to see further than he ever has God has allowed man to see the mystery to a depth that they never had so let's think about this this means that man is maturing in his revelation of the existing mystery does this sound like anyone else man is maturing in his revelation of the mystery I mean you can go to videos where they uh YouTube video where they broadcast these first images and they're just ecstatic thank you this is clapping and cheering and we have done this and we have done that and Hallelujah yeah they're up in class I mean it looks like a church service but from a different angle because they're praising themselves amen so now if you if you look at this Bible God allows you to see certain things within this with your natural eye because this is the first first Bible and so that there was a mystery element to the first Bible there was things that could be seen by the natural eye but there was things that couldn't be seen by the natural eye so if you look at this you can see a certain amount of this by the natural eye all right but there's also parts of this Bible that you can't see you can't see parts of this Bible by the natural eye all right it's just not possible so that means that this book that has been around for a long time there's a mystery element to this amen and the Mystery element to this book is not or is is not everyone's not ordained to see it there's there's only I don't yeah here I go again see if this offends you I'm sorry but I'm not because it's the truth there is only a certain group yes that is ordained to see the mystery element within this book but you alone cannot see it without God sending an instrument to this age to reveal the mystery that is contained within this book that instrument is called William Branham and I ain't afraid to say it and I ain't ashamed to say it the instrument was William Branham amen the instrument was not the one who revealed the ins the the mystery it was God who revealed the mystery to the instrument and the instrument then revealed the contents of this book or spoke the contents the mystery content of this book to the elect [Music] yes sir can't you see why I'm happy [Applause] I've accepted the mystery content I see the mystery content I am fellowshipping with the mystery content because the mystery content is not a theology it's a passion amen it's the person of the word [Applause] my don't you love how the word just keeps getting better and better every time you preach something it just gets better it never gets old it's not like stale bread not fresh bread goes stale God's word never goes stale it just it keeps getting better oh my we thank God Amen God through a prophet instrument has revealed the contents of this book he has bought what was in the heavens and revealed it to be on earth because this is God in print form amen but what God did through that instrument to reveal that the print form has taken on flesh form [Applause] amen the print of the word has taken on flesh the word has become flesh amen and that this remembering that this word was once the thoughts of God which was in the heaven so God condescending God coming down God unveiling himself God condescending stage by stage in his in his divine order amen from thought to word to flesh that is divine order it's not thought from from thought to this to that it's from thought to word to flesh amen God's divine order has revealed that what was in the heavens I'll say that different way who was in the heavens is on Earth yeah now it doesn't end there because there's a part of you like this book that cannot be seen by the natural eye so the only way that God was going to reveal the Unseen portion of him was according to his Bible order people don't like Bible order but God has order God is not a god of confusion he just doesn't say well one day you'll get to know me no he has a way amen God God reveals the secrets his secrets to the prophet first but it's not his desire it's not God's desire for the revelation of the mystery to remain with the prophet no would I no it ain't he wants the mystery to be a revelation to itself he doesn't want you relying upon I hope this is okay he doesn't want you relying upon the prophet's revelation of the mystery he wants you to have your own revelation of the mystery this is his desire for you this is his desire for me there's an unseen portion there's a part of you that you cannot see you've never seen the real me and to be honest I've never seen the real me but faith testifies of the Unseen amen if Faith testify is that the Unseen is there it's a reality to be I see it but not with these but with the eye of the heart who is I believe it was job said I have heard of thee with my ear but he said now I see thee with mine I that eye of faith not these the eye of faith God has given you to see something someone that not everyone can see because the mystery remains a mystery to some it remains a secret to some but it's revealed to others God's desire for you is to reveal the mystery to you amen God does not want to keep you in bondage he wants you to be free amen he wants you to be free and the truth will set you free I mean there's power in the truth but the truth is a person I am the way the truth and the life it's not a theological understanding it's a person he's the truth will set you free amen and that's why when you can see him you'll be free [Applause] amen he sets me free man amen his desire for you is to be known as you are known you think God didn't know about this because he did you didn't think God didn't know about the mysteries in this book he knew the mysteries in this book and he knows the mystery element of you but he wants you to know you he wants you to know you as you are known he wants you to be known as you are known this is his desire for you this is why a husband a groom Whispers The oh darling you're beautiful you're magnificent you're you're everything I ever dreamed of you're just you're you're I haven't got words to tell you right he once said and know that he wants her to be known as she is known but if she continues to reject his word nothing's going to change I think I said this the other night a woman will only find satisfaction in the words of a husband amen because it's a type of the Christ and his bride the only place this bride will find satisfaction is in the words of of Christ president married there's two people one of them lived in a in a box car and the other one in a palace one was the one in the palace was arguing the one in the the one in the Box Car was sitting on his lap saying it's okay darling what was the difference here there's some there was got to be some form of difference you know brothers and sisters we're not like other churches if there's not a difference we have an issue I don't say that to to run down brother Chad there is a difference if if in my church there's not a difference in my church to the denominational Church something's wrong something's wrong because she has the words of life she has the words of eternal life there's got to be something different and God causes you to be different God wants you to be different this is why uh uh this is why your wife should be different to any other wife if your wife looks like any other wife then you have an issue [Music] I hope this isn't bad but husbands you're probably not doing your job if that's the case there's got to be in it there's got to be a difference because God is condescending to a level that we are not looking at God in a prophet that I'm sorry but I am not looking for God in a prophet because God has condescended I saw God in a prophet but he's condescended further than that to where now God is in me [Music] and I see God in Me because he is doing what I couldn't do he is doing the impossible hey hey amen amen it causes a a level of responsibility like we've never had before because once upon a time we could profit you just stay in line you stay in line and I'll be okay you know but in the in the in this day I've got to stay in line amen because this is the vessel that God is working through this is the father that God is working through God God is my children's father was William Branham your Prophet or was God your prophet it was God in William Brown it's God in you was it David who took down Goliath or was it was it God in David that took down Goliath when David come home for a battle and the the amalekites was it had taken all his wife and children was it David who went and got him back or was it God in David that went and got him back amen God condescending to a level that we've never seen we've never seen two now the mystery element of you the eternal element is the mystery element but the mystery element is not a mystery to me do you know why it's not a theology it's not a theory it's because I see him work it's because I see him do these signs shall follow them that belief I see him by the very things that he is doing I see him expressing himself I see him do something can I say I could have never done that exactly that's exactly the price that he wants you to be because that is the Revelation the same Revelation that Esther had when she walked into that Holy that that judge that place that she was she had to push through that curtain and go into that place she knew that she couldn't do it there had to be someone else there had to be someone greater praise God she didn't do it in his her power she did it it was his power working through her amen I didn't know whether I'd have enough tonight but now I'm wondering whether I got too much amen it's your fault right brother Chad the first hour was mine the second one's yours amen amen God desires you to be a revelation to yourself amen he desires you to be known as you unknown when Abraham said here am I he was not drawing attention to God it wasn't the fact that Abraham God didn't know where Abraham was he was speaking of a revelation Abraham Abraham here am I Lord he was speaking by revelation when God calls you you respond by the revelation that he has given you of yourself when I speak darling that's that's who she is to me right well that that is a revelation to her so she responds as a result of that revelation if I say that to someone else another man's wife well kick me out of the church to start with but she's not going to respond right because that word that I spoke is not a REV is not the revelation of her right but but be but when the word comes in contact with who is it it is ordained to come in contact with there's a response she can be walking the complete other direction and it'll cause her to turn why what she hasn't said a word but she's responding to my words so when God said Abraham Abraham Abraham responded to that word because that name was a revelation to him [Music] the name his name was a revelation to him he if God had said Abram he wouldn't have responded but God gave Abraham a new name God gave Abram a new name he gave him a part of his own name so Abraham responded to his new identification as Abraham not Abram he was no longer associated with Abram now he was Abraham oh my God has given you a new name amen God has given you a new name that new name is the name of the mystery element of you amen amen that name is the name of the mystery element of you but the mystery element of you is not a mystery to you that's why you respond to that name you respond to the name of Mrs Jesus Christ because that is your new name that's the mystery element that causes this body to spin around and say yes Lord it's the word of uh of the groom coming to the wife and the wife responding to the word of the groom there's no word that your wife will respond to like yours husbands there's no word that your wife will respond to like your word why because she is a part of you she she is a part of the revelation of you with with without her you're not complete together you've got together you are a complete revelation you alone that's why when a man's looking for a wife he's looking for a part of himself he's looking for a mystery part of himself but but when he finds that mystery part and God I say God brings them together uh now you have a complete revelation of him because she is a REV she is a part of him amen amen God desires you to be known God wants you to be known this was astounding I I was studying the I took a series at home on the Masterpiece family and uh I was just in my office and I was I've been looking at at this um what they'd been achieving here through this James Wood telescope and I I had a thought come to me which I'm not going to claim as my own that said I I wonder if anyone has said anything about in relation to these images of being a masterpiece so I put in James Webb tell us Google James Webb Telescope masterpiece well this is what it came up with associate professor Jane Eldridge head of the Department of physics University of Queensland comments the jwst which is the James Webb Space Telescope now needs to be called just the wow telescope these new images are of views we've seen before but with the clarity and detail we now see it feels like a masterpiece has been restored to our full View if you don't believe me There's the link it feels like a masterpiece has been restored to our full View it's more the more than being a masterpiece remembering that the first message brother and preached on Masterpiece was called Masterpiece the second one was called the identified Masterpiece so it was more than just an understanding that there was a masterpiece but now the Masterpiece had been restored to our full View amen now if that's what God is doing because I agree I these images they're a masterpiece they really are they are a work of a monster Craftsman who create has created a masterpiece and that's what that's what these are they're nothing more nothing less it's just masterful but if that's what God has done on a human level on a natural level then that only testifies what God has done on a spiritual level that there is now a masterpiece who has been restored to our full View amen who is this masterpiece it's a masterpiece family glory to God to our full View not someone else's not not Malachi 4 even though it was but it's our time to see the Masterpiece in full view I I like this because it's been restored amen amen amen this guy didn't even know what he was saying he didn't know what he what he said would be ministered here he didn't have a clue the the magnitude of what he said but it's it's it's huge because it is true that the Masterpiece family has been restored amen the Masterpiece family has been restored God God didn't when the Masterpiece fell he didn't disregard the Masterpiece and create a new one no he was going to restore that Fallen Masterpiece and I was as part of that Fallen Masterpiece but he has restored the masterpiece and put her into full View [Music] [Applause] not into view full view why because we're not living in the day of partial things we're living in the day of fullness it's been fully restored this masterpiece family has been fully restored my my my God's desire for you is to be known as you are known good amen here am I a masterpiece restored in full View I see a masterpiece [Applause] well by then I don't see it I don't care I see it amen what are we doing we're responding by the revelation of us we're responding to the revelation of us Abraham Abraham here Capital H here am I Masterpiece masterpiece here am I he called my Lord you called what is it it's a masterpiece calling to a masterpiece hallelujah it's it's the groom calling Toy's wife amen when I call darling it's a masterpiece calling to another part of the Masterpiece and the Masterpiece responds to the masterpiece amen what are we doing we're responding right yeah amen the Revelation to the revelation of ourselves we are not victims we are victorious we are the masterpiece hallelujah thank you Lord the Masterpiece standing in full View [Applause] I can swing myself around and stand in front of a mirror say a masterpiece in full View not looking at this guy you know I don't I don't I don't need plastic surgery and stuff you know that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about the mystery element there's a mystery element within me the Unseen part of me is the masterpiece the real me the bit you haven't seen but I have why because it's a revelation to me by faith I walk by faith Enoch walked by faith this masterpiece walks in the revelation of the Masterpiece this masterpiece walks amen my wife can walk in the in the revelation of the masterpiece yes sir she doesn't have to have confidence in herself she has her confidence needs to be in me because I am her head and her confidence needs to be in a headship right so she can walk into a into a into a shopping mall with a with a card that I've given her that has the power within it to purchase anything she wants and someone can walk in front of her and say excuse me I I don't think this is your caliber of shop and she can say well you better step aside the problem with you is that you don't see the mystery element you're only looking at the outside you're only looking at the flesh you better step aside because my husband has given me the authority to purchase anything that I desire foreign God's Masterpiece is responding to the voice of the masterpiece amen the gods Masterpiece she is responding to him the same way that Abraham responded to Abraham Abraham here am I here am I positionally here am I Lord I am a revelation of you amen amen amen I am a part of you as a father as a husband where am I going to get the confidence from to meet the challenges that fatherhood and husbandship has in this hour how could I as a father outdo technology because I'm not technical I don't change pictures every 30 seconds I'm just this boring old dad but it doesn't matter it shouldn't matter how great technology becomes the mystery element of me should be able to outdo anything that this world can produce I believe it and this is challenging but I believe it but if you ain't challenged how you cannot how you're going to reach your potential if you ain't challenged as a father how are you going to reach your potential as a father if you ain't challenged as a husband how are you going to reach your potential as a husband right that's right what are we going to do just wait for the rapture no you fulfilling your purpose will bring the Rapture down you will cause the Rapture when you've come to your potential we don't come to potential after the Rapture right we come to protect the coming to our potential brings the Rapture down Abraham Enoch walked with God and was not [Music] his walk with God caused Enoch to be raptured because Enoch reached his potential by Walking with God amen and how how are we how are we going to be raptured by coming to our potential through a challenge by being challenged challenged his mother's sons daughters widows grandmothers grandfathers coming to our potential in the office that God or officers you can't choose one I'm a son I'm a father I'm a husband I'm an and I'm a grandfather I haven't done that one very many times and I'm a grand I've got to come to my potential in those offices amen we'll get there tomorrow God doesn't want you to presume I've got to bring this to a close God wants God Wants You to Know Who You Are if we're presuming then the fruit of the it'll yield that type of fruit as a if I'm presuming who I am in my office it'll produce that type of fruit if I know who I am because I believe that as Jesus knew who he was two thousand year ago the only way that he could fulfill what he was ordained to fulfill his purpose was through the revelation of who he was it wasn't enough for John to have the revelation behold the lamb of God Jesus had to have that same revelation and he stood before Pilate said for this reason came I into the world for this purp for this end of my born he knew who he was and in order for us to be successful in the offices that we hold we must know who we are amen we are not I don't I'm not saying that in a fearful way have faith believe believe in God he he will it's up to him he will reveal it amen and this is why this is why he as he reveals it we as husbands are able God opens his word husband's rights God opens his word husbands rise this is why and I hope this is okay those who don't believe the seventh seal is open they're not going to come to their potential right because all the book must be open in order for you to become to maturity if the if you believe that the book is not open that is the level of maturity that you will come to and I know that's hard it's it's hard to accept and it's hard to understand but it is the truth I don't mean it's hard to understand I mean sometimes it's hard to say but it's the truth yeah it's the truth the only way is to is through the opening of the word I'm going to close with this quote here from statue of a perfect man through through that blood we are cleansed and now our blood our life which came by living through sexual desire brought our life in the world the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us changes our Nature by sending upon us the Holy Spirit then we become into the divine nature of God then we become a Dwelling Place for God Jesus said at that day you know that I am in the father and the father in me and I I in you and you in me that's thus saith the Lord you will know amen you will know amen that that that you is the mystery element in this book amen only this scripture people read it but only the mystery element of this book will be will will this apply does this apply to you it's not for everyone not everything Jesus said is for is for everyone but it is fear [Music] s for you amen amen now how know how that God is in his church the church is now supposed to be taking the place of Christ carrying on his ministry he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also yet a little while the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I will be with you even in you to the end of the world see there it is carrying on his word amen we are thankful that we can take ourselves back now to the mystery element of this book and we can go to a portion of this book that is not revealed to others but is revealed to you and you can identify yourself in this book as the mystery element of this book you can identify yourself as the restored masterpiece in full View amen it's What the Lord Has Done For Me amen God is so so so good amen amen amen well praise the Lord I'm going to leave it there it's 10 to 10. go down to service in the morning let's just stand to our feet amen why don't we you know all this is all this is because of what

rejoicing there amen but we are rejoicing so gonna ask the musicians brother Chad to come up God bless you all let's disclose in a word of prayer shall we our precious and wonderful Heavenly Father Lord God the more time we spend here on this Earth the more we realize Lord how little we have to do with anything we realize Lord that it is only by your grace we realize Heavenly Father Lord that

confidence oh I love you all thank God that we were able to be here I think sometimes when I hear words like this how blessed we are that human ears can hear such precious words such precious Eternal thoughts that were locked in the mystery part of God's mind and the back part of his mind has been revealed in this day and and how precious it is that God has ordained human lips to speak it in humans ears to hear it and then a real set of ears in the soul to receive it I'm so thankful these are precious words of life God bless you all men will dismiss with a song but I I just want to remind you we've got a fellowship in the fellowship hall through these doors and down the corridor to the right my free freshman's there we'd just love to have you join us and keep chewing on this good word

thankful for the word God I pray your blesses as we go from here and these things that we've heard Lord let them not fade away as we walk out of the doors but may they be deeply rooted inside of us and may the message we've heard Lord bring fruit in our lives bring a greater realization Lord of who we are so that we can say Lord here I am Lord here I am when you when you say Mrs Jesus Christ we say Here I Am Lord by Your Grace by your Revelation by your doing but here I am nonetheless Lord I didn't put myself here I didn't make myself this but I know here I am because you made it known to me

you bless the refreshments as we partake in them and help us God to just continually love and encourage and bless one another in your word we thank you God for what you've done we pray that you'd
