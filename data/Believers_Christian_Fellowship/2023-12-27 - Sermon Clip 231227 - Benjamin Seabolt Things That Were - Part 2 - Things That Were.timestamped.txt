[0:00] Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the
[0:03] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[0:04] begin to sound the
[0:08] mystery the
[0:11] mystery I know who that seventh angel is
[0:15] but the mystery of God should be
[0:17] finished who is this
[0:20] mystery because it sounds familiar to me
[0:23] it sounds like somebody said that to me
[0:27] before and it sounds almost like my
[0:31] this mystery of God should be finished
[0:34] this final manifestation of God is going
[0:37] to be
[0:39] finished Christ in Bride form is going
[0:42] to be
[0:43] finished saints of God the bride is made
[0:46] up of people and those people have names
[0:49] and those names are not necessarily
[0:51] written in Black Ink and white paper but
[0:54] they can say the mystery and all of a
[0:56] sudden something as brother Brandon
[0:58] would say something would come tumbling
[1:00] down through a mystical Channel and I
[1:02] would recognize that I am that
[1:05] mystery the voice of the seventh angel
[1:08] when he begins to sound when he begins
[1:10] to call
[1:12] names the mystery of whether I'm on that
[1:15] book or not it's going to be
[1:18] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:21] servants the prophets and the voice
[1:23] which I heard you say well that's John
[1:26] that's not you the voice that I heard
[1:30] from where from Heaven spake unto me you
[1:34] said well that's John no that's
[1:36] me you can say it's John if you want to
[1:39] but that's
[1:43] meise spake unto me again and said go
[1:45] and take the little book which is open
[1:46] in the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:48] upon the sea and upon the Earth and I
[1:49] went into the angel I went into the
[1:53] angel I went to the angel you say well I
[1:55] never went to the
[1:57] angel did you pick up a message book
[2:00] yeah did you turn on a tape did you
[2:03] listen to what somebody had to say about
[2:05] Elijah the prophet coming into the
[2:09] scene and I went into the
[2:12] angel and I said give me the little book
[2:16] give me the little book me me that me in
[2:20] the scripture is a person
[2:22] Saints and that person is written in the
[2:26] word of God forever settled in heaven
[2:30] Eternal
[2:32] real give me the book and he said unto
[2:35] me take it and eat it up and it shall
[2:38] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[2:41] thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[2:44] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[2:45] ate it up and it was in my mouth look at
[2:47] all these personal
[2:49] pronouns I would encourage you if there
[2:51] is anything that I could do tonight I
[2:53] would encourage you do not leave this
[2:55] with
[2:58] John and that's just not me saying that
[3:01] we we have a Vindicated Prophet saying
[3:03] that John represented the
[3:05] bride
