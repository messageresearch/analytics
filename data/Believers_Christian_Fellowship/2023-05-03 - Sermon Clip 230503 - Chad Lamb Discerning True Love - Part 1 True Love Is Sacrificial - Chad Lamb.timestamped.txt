[0:00] Matthew 23 verse 5 Jesus is speaking now
[0:04] the Pharisees he says but all their
[0:05] Works they do for to be seen of men
[0:08] they make broader phylacteries they
[0:10] enlarge the borders of their garments
[0:12] they love the uppermost rooms that feast
[0:14] and the chief seats in the synagogues
[0:15] and greetings in the markets and to be
[0:17] called meant by of men Rabbi Rabbi these
[0:20] men look like they love God but they
[0:22] really love themselves
[0:24] and they go through all of these uh
[0:26] rituals and all of these laws and all of
[0:29] this stuff so that they can prove to the
[0:31] people that they love God but really
[0:33] Jesus is Discerning their love they
[0:35] don't love God they love themselves they
[0:39] love the position it puts them in the
[0:40] esteem that they get from people in the
[0:42] respect that's what they're loving and
[0:44] unfortunately and sadly this is what
[0:47] religion is really like
[0:50] people are religious for all kinds of
[0:52] reasons amen but the number one reason
[0:55] for religion is that people love
[0:57] themselves because it serves them
[0:59] somehow
[1:00] their religion is serving them somehow
[1:03] and whatever they get out of it amen
[1:05] either clear from a guilty conscience or
[1:07] respect from somebody or love from a
[1:10] family member whatever reason they'll
[1:12] dive into religion Amen in this religion
[1:15] amen looks like they love God but really
[1:18] they love themselves
[1:20] true yeah
[1:23] this is why no matter how much you show
[1:25] the truth of the word to people they
[1:27] won't leave their religion
[1:29] because the relief of religion would
[1:31] cause a personal sacrifice
[1:33] they would have to sacrifice themselves
[1:35] to leave their tradition
[1:37] and in leaving the tradition they would
[1:39] lose Association
[1:40] they would lose respect they would look
[1:42] bad in the eyes of people they would
[1:44] look like a heretic or you're following
[1:45] a false prophet or or you're mixed up
[1:47] with a cult you're you're this you're
[1:49] that you're the other and people won't
[1:51] leave the religion because the religion
[1:54] is serving self
[1:56] no matter how much you show baptism in
[1:59] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right
[2:00] out of the word no matter how much you
[2:02] show them amen that the trinitarian idea
[2:05] is wrong no matter how much you show by
[2:07] the word they can see it amen they will
[2:10] agree with you and then when they go to
[2:12] their Pastor or go to their church and
[2:14] they're going to be rejected for that
[2:15] word they reject the word and stay with
[2:18] the religion
[2:25] perverted love
[2:27] if loving God with a perverted love
[2:31] but a pure love would say if that's the
[2:34] truth
[2:35] if that's the truth if that's what God
[2:38] Said Amen if that's what God wants and
[2:40] that's what God requires where can I get
[2:42] baptized
[2:45] amen all friends forsake you your church
[2:48] think you've gone off the deep end they
[2:49] no longer consider you a Christian they
[2:51] are no longer consider you in the way of
[2:53] Truth they've lost respect for
[2:55] co-workers lose respect but it doesn't
[2:57] matter because the recipient of my love
[2:59] is worth my personal sacrifice it's
[3:02] worth me losing my reputation losing my
[3:04] Association losing everything because
[3:06] the recipient of my love is worth My
[3:09] Sacrifice
[3:12] but if we're not willing to become the
[3:14] sacrifice then we don't love the object
[3:17] of our love we love ourselves
[3:19] it's Boomerang love
[3:22] I only give love because I want love
