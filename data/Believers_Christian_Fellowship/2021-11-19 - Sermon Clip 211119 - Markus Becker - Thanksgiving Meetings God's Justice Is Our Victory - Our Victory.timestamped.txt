[0:00] abraham must have thought i hope he does
[0:02] not ask now about that promise because
[0:04] there is nobody
[0:05] god all the time knew one thing
[0:08] abraham you will not make it
[0:11] because i made sarah sterile stereo god
[0:15] knew that
[0:17] god gave him something to do in you you
[0:18] will not make it
[0:22] and and i can see abraham he was so
[0:24] embarrassed here lord we tried
[0:25] everything uh everything of fertile
[0:28] institute and we
[0:31] we we went at this seminary and this
[0:33] seminary but not nothing worked really
[0:35] and god was just thinking about himself
[0:36] i know
[0:38] i know i made it impossible for you
[0:41] made it impossible
[0:43] because it was me making sarah sterile
[0:45] [Music]
[0:46] so so so everyone said and and we went
[0:49] to church and we were praying and we
[0:50] were praying and god said yeah yeah yeah
[0:53] yeah
[0:54] but it had to be the appointed time
[0:57] [Applause]
[0:58] i had to come
[1:01] amen it must be god
[1:04] do you understand this message is not
[1:06] you have to work yourself
[1:08] more and more and no more brother and if
[1:11] i know the seventh seal i got it that's
[1:12] not it
[1:14] sometimes people have a wonderful
[1:15] understanding but have an arrogant
[1:17] spirit
[1:18] but we need a reality
[1:20] of somebody really so in tune with god
[1:24] that he comes you can say he she is him
[1:27] and he is her
[1:29] and god knows one thing
[1:31] my little children
[1:33] i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm love to see you all
[1:36] what you can do but the rapture you will
[1:37] not make it
[1:39] i must be your rapture
[1:41] martin luther found out he is my justice
[1:45] john wesley said i served him more than
[1:48] ever
[1:49] john john wesley didn't say okay okay ah
[1:52] i understand so we go in the pub next
[1:54] week no no he was he was more fervent
[1:57] than ever
[1:58] but he changed his attitude
[2:02] he said i will not do it to to achieve
[2:04] anything for god but i do it because i
[2:07] accept the love of god for my life
[2:11] therefore if you if you are legalized by
[2:14] love
[2:15] continue that way
[2:17] if your legal is by pharaoh to be a
[2:19] pharisee you know brother
[2:21] i'm so happy in our circle it's
[2:24] different it's different it's different
[2:26] forget it
[2:28] it must be the love of god
[2:31] and if you see something wrong on your
[2:33] brother and your heart goes lord help my
[2:35] brother
[2:36] there's too much worthiness around it
[2:39] help him
[2:40] brother that is the love of god bringing
[2:42] us up can you say amen
