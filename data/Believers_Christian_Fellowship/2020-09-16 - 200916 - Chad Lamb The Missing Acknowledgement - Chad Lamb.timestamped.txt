[4:40] is
[4:49] while you're standing let's take our
[4:50] bibles and turn to the book of ephesians
[4:53] and i just want to while we're turning
[4:55] there thank everybody who came out to
[4:57] brother tommy's celebration on sunday
[5:00] and everybody who was able to help it
[5:02] was a real blessing amen
[5:04] and i think everybody who was there
[5:05] really enjoyed it i enjoyed worshiping
[5:08] and singing in the pavilion
[5:09] and it was good to hear brother tommy's
[5:11] voice leading in worship again and
[5:13] i was refreshed by it and enjoyed it
[5:14] very much he and sister barb have gone
[5:17] to their daughter charity
[5:18] remember the richest place for a visit
[5:20] so they're not here right now but
[5:21] we thank god that we were able to enjoy
[5:23] that together
[5:24] also i want to let you know that brother
[5:26] emmanuel sabasi will be traveling this
[5:28] friday
[5:28] to northern idaho to go to that group he
[5:31] goes to occasionally
[5:32] to minister for them so i know he'd
[5:34] cover your prayers he'd appreciate it
[5:36] if you'd be holding him up in prayer for
[5:38] traveling mercies in for the ministry
[5:40] this weekend man let's look at ephesians
[5:43] chapter 4 verse 11.
[5:48] we're going to continue with the same
[5:50] thought and just maybe take a little
[5:51] different vein but
[5:53] in the same same general direction
[5:56] ephesians chapter 4 verse 11
[5:59] and he gave some apostles and some
[6:02] prophets and some evangelists
[6:04] and some pastors and teachers for the
[6:06] perfecting of the saints
[6:08] for the work of the ministry for the
[6:10] edifying of the body of christ
[6:12] till we all come in the unity of the
[6:14] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[6:15] god
[6:16] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[6:19] the stature of the fullness of christ
[6:22] that we henceforth be no more children
[6:24] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[6:26] every wind of doctrine
[6:27] by the slight of men in the cunning
[6:28] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[6:31] deceive
[6:32] but speaking the truth and love may grow
[6:34] up into unto him and
[6:36] all things which is the head even christ
[6:40] so the goal all along has been to grow
[6:42] into the head
[6:44] to come into the full stature of christ
[6:46] let's bow our head and ask the lord's
[6:47] blessing over the word
[6:49] lord jesus we thank you father for this
[6:52] opportunity to come lord and read your
[6:54] word
[6:55] and father we ask all that you would
[6:56] come now and just minister unto us
[6:59] that you would speak things lord that
[7:01] that would direct us in the path that we
[7:03] should walk that would encourage us lord
[7:05] in the way you want us to live
[7:06] that would open our eyes lord and help
[7:08] us to see more clearly
[7:10] i pray you take preeminence and you
[7:11] would use this vessel for your glory
[7:13] hear through our ears lord and help us
[7:15] to grow by this message today
[7:17] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[7:21] you can all be seated
[7:24] amen i just want to start with a quote
[7:27] in reading from
[7:27] blasphemius names it says
[7:31] the first foundation is faith second add
[7:34] to your faith virtue to your virtue
[7:36] knowledge
[7:36] from knowledge temperance from
[7:38] temperance patience to patience
[7:40] godliness from godliness brother love
[7:42] brotherly kindness and then love being
[7:45] the capstone
[7:46] seven of those things seven church ages
[7:48] see seven stars of the church ages and
[7:50] all of it is tempered together by the
[7:52] holy spirit
[7:53] now that's what it takes to become a
[7:55] servant of christ
[7:56] christ builds his church in seven church
[7:58] ages his bride
[8:00] a person woman church seven church ages
[8:03] constitute and make the bride
[8:05] some out of this age and some out of
[8:07] that age and some out of that agent all
[8:10] together
[8:10] and shaping it like a pyramid so brother
[8:13] venom is taking this
[8:14] he's drawing an analogy here from statue
[8:17] of a perfect man he's now preaching
[8:18] blasphemous names
[8:20] but he's saying now god is building the
[8:22] individual
[8:23] amen from faith and all of these
[8:25] characteristics are building in and
[8:27] being molded
[8:28] and locked in amen until they come to
[8:30] the
[8:31] to the full stature of christ the full
[8:33] measure of
[8:34] a mature son or daughter of god up to
[8:36] adoption to the capping off
[8:38] amen of the great capstone of love the
[8:41] capping off
[8:43] saying this is this is one that i can
[8:45] now use they can speak for me they can
[8:47] do a work
[8:48] in my place amen but he's saying the way
[8:50] he built the individual is also the way
[8:52] he built his bride he's built his church
[8:54] through seven church ages amen and
[8:56] bringing them up and and
[8:58] he describes it so many different ways
[8:59] but you know coming from the feet
[9:01] through the thighs to the
[9:02] to the arms all the way up to the
[9:04] shoulders and to the head and
[9:06] he says that's the way he's been
[9:08] building his bride through seven church
[9:09] ages
[9:10] so he takes this uh growing uh
[9:12] individual and growing the church and
[9:14] capping it off and he he relates them to
[9:17] one another
[9:18] and while we're here i want to turn to
[9:20] uh ii peter
[9:22] let's turn to second peter chapter one
[9:25] and he says he built his bride through
[9:27] seven church ages he's got these
[9:29] uh these virtues that are here and and
[9:32] he's had seven church ages and he ties
[9:33] it together with seven messengers
[9:35] coming all the way up but let's look
[9:38] here
[9:39] at second peter chapter 1
[9:44] verse 5. and beside this
[9:48] giving all diligence add to your faith
[9:50] virtue
[9:51] so faith number one virtue number two
[9:54] virtue knowledge
[9:55] knowledge temperance temperance patience
[9:57] patience godliness calling this
[9:59] brotherly kindness
[10:00] so now we've come to seven so brother
[10:03] branham is typing these virtues with
[10:05] god bringing us to a mature an adopted
[10:08] son a place son
[10:10] he's doing the same thing with the
[10:11] church bringing the church up through
[10:13] seven church ages
[10:14] to a placing to an adoption amen and he
[10:16] says seven virtues and
[10:18] and he's saying seven church ages and
[10:20] seven messengers
[10:22] but but peter's not done
[10:25] we come to seven the seventh is brother
[10:27] the kindness and it says in verse seven
[10:29] and to
[10:30] to and to god in his brotherly kindness
[10:32] and to brotherly kindness
[10:34] charity love divine love agape love
[10:38] charity for if these things be in you
[10:39] and abound they make you that you shall
[10:41] neither be barren
[10:42] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[10:44] lord jesus christ
[10:46] so we see brother i'm showing building
[10:47] up through seven says seven virtues and
[10:50] he says seven church ages but there's a
[10:52] great capping off of that
[10:54] and we can't miss the capping off as
[10:56] number eight
[10:57] and it's the whole thing amen it's not i
[11:00] mean i
[11:01] say if we could say it this way it's not
[11:03] an additional virtue
[11:05] all of these virtues come out of god's
[11:07] love amen
[11:08] god is love it is the very nature of
[11:10] love the very head the capping off
[11:12] the thing that builds each one of these
[11:15] comes out of that capstone of love
[11:17] amen and so the eighth is back to him
[11:20] the headship
[11:21] amen christ love and so
[11:24] now we see i just want you to see that i
[11:27] want you to see that number eight and i
[11:28] don't want you to miss that as we go on
[11:30] a little bit farther
[11:32] he says in the message desperation and
[11:34] all the things that he
[11:36] hasn't done now through the ages in the
[11:37] church ages he is now doing
[11:40] back to the word so what he wasn't doing
[11:43] all the things that
[11:44] or he says were left off back there he
[11:46] says or that he hasn't done through the
[11:48] church ages
[11:49] he is now doing back to the word because
[11:51] the messages
[11:52] and the messages and the messages has to
[11:55] wind
[11:56] up in the entire word and the last days
[11:58] the seven seals being opened
[12:00] was to pick up every straggle that's
[12:02] been left off in it
[12:03] and make the whole thing in one great
[12:06] big body
[12:06] of the bride that them who lived back
[12:09] there
[12:10] was not perfect until this church be
[12:12] perfected
[12:13] this bride group in the last days to
[12:15] bring them in
[12:16] and all together be taken up so brother
[12:19] branham is showing us
[12:21] that there's been a there's been a
[12:22] building amen from
[12:24] the ephesians church age all the way
[12:25] through there's been a building up a
[12:26] building up
[12:27] into the stature of the measure of
[12:29] christ's stature the fullness of christ
[12:31] till we all grow into the head which is
[12:33] the capstone which is charity
[12:35] which is love amen and now this bride in
[12:38] the
[12:39] end time has got to come to a headship
[12:41] amen and this bride has to manifest the
[12:44] headship
[12:44] the capping off the ceiling together of
[12:47] the entire of
[12:48] all the church ages have to come up to
[12:50] this amen and when this
[12:52] church comes into perfection it'll bring
[12:54] them all in and bring the resurrection
[12:56] and bring the whole thing up
[12:58] so what is god doing today that's the
[13:01] thing that he's doing today
[13:03] he's getting amen he's grown a church
[13:06] all the way through but he's brought the
[13:08] the headship now of the word the
[13:09] headstone christ has come
[13:11] and whereas he's come he's come in the
[13:13] formation of a bride
[13:15] amen to display that same nature that
[13:19] same
[13:19] life on display in a farmer a mechanic
[13:22] a housewife the young the elderly the
[13:25] single the married
[13:26] and then he's come to take that very
[13:28] nature and put it on display
[13:30] in a mini-member body to bring the
[13:32] perfection and the image
[13:34] of perfection amen to bring out the
[13:36] resurrection
[13:39] amen christ left off
[13:42] a portion of the work that he didn't
[13:45] complete in his earthly ministry but he
[13:46] left it
[13:48] he left a portion to be done in and
[13:50] through the bride
[13:51] amen because when jesus christ was here
[13:53] in his earthly ministry
[13:55] he never portrayed amen he never
[13:58] portrayed what it was like to be a
[14:00] mother
[14:02] amen he didn't portray what it was like
[14:06] amen to be wherever you are put yourself
[14:08] in whatever position you're in
[14:10] amen god christ didn't portray that full
[14:13] nature
[14:14] in that spot amen so now it's not just
[14:17] going to be in one man doing only what
[14:19] one man does
[14:20] but every facet of life every age
[14:23] every demographic every color every race
[14:26] amen poor and rich and single and
[14:29] married and weak and strong and
[14:31] sick and healthy it doesn't matter all
[14:34] through is going to have this same
[14:36] nature of jesus christ
[14:38] it's going to be the perfection of the
[14:40] bride on display
[14:42] on earth in this day
[14:45] praise be to god showing whatever he was
[14:48] in that form
[14:49] he will be down in bride form
[14:53] praise god so that i just wanted to back
[14:56] up and catch that so we can move from
[14:58] there let's turn to revelation chapter
[15:00] 2.
[15:02] we'll get into the thing that i really
[15:04] would like to share
[15:05] tonight i got a strange title but i
[15:09] titled it the missing acknowledgement
[15:12] the missing acknowledgement we'll take a
[15:16] look at why we said that
[15:19] so let's look at a revelation chapter
[15:21] two verse one
[15:24] unto the angel of the church of the
[15:25] ephesians write these things saith he
[15:27] that holdeth the seven stars in his
[15:29] right hand
[15:30] who walketh in the midst of the seven
[15:32] golden candlesticks
[15:33] i know thy works and i labor and thy
[15:35] patience and how thou
[15:36] canst not bear them which are evil and
[15:39] thou hast tried them which say they are
[15:41] apostles
[15:42] and are not and has found them liars and
[15:44] as born and has patience and
[15:46] for my name's sake has labored and has
[15:48] not fainted
[15:49] nevertheless i have somewhat against
[15:52] thee because thou has left thy first
[15:54] love
[15:55] now when we read through this it's
[15:58] interesting because
[16:00] if you just read it with with a normal
[16:03] natural mind you can
[16:04] if you understand english and you know
[16:06] basic grammar you read this and come
[16:08] with a certain understanding
[16:09] but without a prophet of god we would
[16:11] have the wrong understanding
[16:13] it looks almost like jesus is saying
[16:16] to to somebody uh it almost looks like
[16:19] he's taking an individual and saying
[16:20] you're doing good here you're laboring
[16:22] here
[16:23] you're doing good here but you've lost
[16:25] your first love
[16:27] but that's not what he's saying and
[16:30] we'll show you in the message
[16:31] it's not as though he's taking an
[16:33] individual saying you're doing good here
[16:34] but you're not doing good there
[16:36] but he's actually addressing two
[16:38] different groups of people
[16:40] amen it's not like he's speaking to his
[16:42] bride there in the first church
[16:44] and said you've done pretty good here
[16:45] you've done pretty good here but you
[16:46] lost your first love his bride didn't
[16:48] lose her first love but the church
[16:50] lost its first love so it's not like
[16:53] he's saying
[16:54] well you're doing all right here and
[16:55] you're not doing all right here speaking
[16:56] to
[16:57] like you as an individual he's not doing
[16:59] that he's speaking to a church he's got
[17:01] a message to a body of people
[17:03] and he's saying you've done this you've
[17:05] done this and he's speaking to his bride
[17:06] on the positive part but when it comes
[17:08] to the negative part he's speaking to
[17:09] the false vine
[17:12] brother brahm says in the out of the
[17:13] church age book in the ephesians church
[17:15] age
[17:16] now to get the real meaning of what we
[17:18] are are about to go into i must caution
[17:20] you to ever keep in mind
[17:22] that religion spiritual matters if you
[17:24] like is composed of two parts that
[17:27] intertwine but are opposite as black and
[17:29] white
[17:30] religion and the spirit and the
[17:32] spiritual world are made of these two
[17:33] trees
[17:34] which had their roots in eden both the
[17:36] tree of life
[17:37] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[17:39] evil stand in the midst of the garden
[17:41] and no doubt their very branches
[17:43] intertwined
[17:44] each other so if their very branches
[17:48] intertwined each other you have two
[17:49] trees in the garden they said no doubt
[17:51] their very branches intertwined each
[17:52] other
[17:53] and if you if you weren't paying
[17:54] attention just looking up at this big
[17:56] ball of of leaves and trees intertwined
[17:59] together
[18:00] i mean jesus could look and say you're a
[18:02] perfect tree
[18:03] there's nothing wrong with you amen
[18:05] everything is perfect your fruit is
[18:06] perfect it brings eternal life
[18:08] and he says and you're a cursed tree
[18:10] amen and if you eat if
[18:12] anyone eats of view they'll not live
[18:14] they'll die
[18:16] and it looks like he's speaking out both
[18:17] sides of his mouth if you don't
[18:19] recognize those are two trees there
[18:21] they're laced together and that's what
[18:25] he's doing here in the church
[18:27] he's speaking to two vines that are
[18:29] woven together
[18:31] so it can be confusing it's like his
[18:33] children doing good and doing bad doing
[18:34] good and doing bad
[18:36] amen now it says
[18:40] now thus in the ephesians church age
[18:44] is that same paradox the church is made
[18:46] up of good and bad
[18:48] two vines make the church they're like
[18:50] the wheat and the tares growing up side
[18:52] by side
[18:53] but one is the true the other is the
[18:55] false now god will speak
[18:57] to each one and he will talk about each
[19:00] one
[19:01] he will call them the church and only
[19:04] the elect will really know which is the
[19:06] true spirit
[19:07] only the elect will not be deceived
[19:10] in the resume of the ages at the end of
[19:12] the church age book he says from our
[19:14] studies
[19:14] we have already learned that much of the
[19:16] revelation is totally misunderstood
[19:19] because we have not formally known that
[19:21] the church
[19:22] spoken of and spoken to
[19:25] in this book does not refer to the pure
[19:28] ecclesia the elect
[19:29] the body of christ the bride but it
[19:31] speaks to the entire body of people who
[19:33] are called christians
[19:35] whether they be true or merely nominal
[19:38] to catch that so let's now that we've
[19:40] got to the end of that sense let's go
[19:42] back to the beginning so we can catch it
[19:43] again
[19:44] from our studies we have already learned
[19:46] that much of the revelation is
[19:47] totally misunderstood why is it
[19:50] misunderstood
[19:51] because you didn't know when he was
[19:53] speaking he was speaking to two groups
[19:55] of people
[19:57] amen we thought you were just talking to
[19:59] the elect but he wasn't just talking to
[20:01] the elect he was talking to the elected
[20:02] and non-elected
[20:04] at all come under the heading of
[20:06] christian
[20:08] praise god as all israel is not israel
[20:11] so all christians are not christians
[20:14] that's a novel concept
[20:18] just because you take the label go to a
[20:20] church say the right thing
[20:21] doesn't make it so thus we learn that
[20:24] the church is made up of two vines the
[20:26] true and the false
[20:27] the two vines are motivated by two kinds
[20:29] of spirits
[20:30] one has the holy spirit while the other
[20:32] is endued with the spirit of antichrist
[20:34] both claim to know and be known of god
[20:38] both purport to speak for god both
[20:40] believe certain very basic truths and
[20:42] differ on others
[20:43] but since both bear the name of the lord
[20:45] being called christians
[20:47] and by such name-bearing obviously claim
[20:50] a relationship to him
[20:51] in parentheses as god calls it marriage
[20:54] god now holds them both responsible to
[20:57] him and therefore speaks to each
[21:00] so because they come under the heading
[21:02] because they're part of
[21:03] the seemingly part of the church i mean
[21:05] they've come under that title and given
[21:07] themselves the title
[21:08] and joined themselves to assemblies with
[21:10] that title
[21:11] amen now he speaks to them because
[21:14] they've come under the title of
[21:15] christian not because they
[21:16] are christian he speaks to two groups
[21:20] and now we didn't know that much of the
[21:22] revelation would be misunderstood
[21:25] if we don't know that so now when he's
[21:28] coming through
[21:29] and then we find in each church age now
[21:31] as you go through and read you'll find
[21:33] that he gives a praise he gives he gives
[21:36] a compliment or an acknowledgement
[21:37] he acknowledges if you if you watch now
[21:40] through each of the the church ages in
[21:42] chapter 2 and chapter 3
[21:43] he acknowledges both vines is that right
[21:47] he acknowledges and he'll say you i know
[21:50] your works and i know your charity i
[21:52] know your tribulation and i know your
[21:54] patience
[21:54] i know this and i know that but i also
[21:56] know that you've got the deeds and the
[21:58] nicolaitans there i also know
[21:59] that you allowed that jezebel there
[22:02] so now he acknowledges both groups and
[22:05] he's speaking to both and you can catch
[22:07] him
[22:07] you can catch him speaking on the
[22:09] positive and the negative through each
[22:10] church age
[22:12] but now let's go to chapter 3 and look
[22:14] at the last church age
[22:16] the laodicean church age revelation
[22:19] chapter 3 verse 14
[22:23] and unto the angel of the church of the
[22:25] laodiceans write
[22:26] these things saith the amen the faithful
[22:28] and true witness the beginning of the
[22:29] creation of god
[22:31] i know that i worked at thou are neither
[22:33] cold nor hot i would that were cold
[22:35] or hot so then because thou art lukewarm
[22:38] and neither cold nor hot i will spew
[22:39] thee out of my mouth
[22:41] now usually he'll start off by saying i
[22:44] know thy works and he starts to speak to
[22:46] the true vine right then
[22:48] i know thy works i know that patience i
[22:49] know that tribulation i know that you
[22:51] cannot bear them that are false
[22:54] but here there's no acknowledgment of
[22:57] good amen
[22:57] there's nothing that acknowledges a true
[22:59] vine amen he's only acknowledging a
[23:01] false vine
[23:03] right out of the bat i know thy works
[23:04] that thou art neither cold nor high
[23:06] i could that thou were cold or hot do
[23:08] you think the genuine body of jesus
[23:11] christ
[23:11] would neither be cold or i know she's
[23:13] red hot on fire for christ all the time
[23:17] amen amen
[23:21] neither cold or hot so then because thou
[23:22] art lukewarm and either cold nor hot
[23:24] i will spew thee out of thy mouth at any
[23:26] time
[23:27] has god ever spewed his elect out of his
[23:31] mouth
[23:32] would he ever will he ever reject his
[23:35] bride
[23:36] will he ever cast her away will he ever
[23:39] spew the elect out of his mouth
[23:42] no because thou sayest i am rich
[23:46] and increase with goods and have need of
[23:48] nothing and knoweth not that thou are
[23:50] wretched
[23:51] and miserable and poor and blind
[23:54] and naked don't think he's speaking to
[23:58] his bride
[24:01] verse 18 i counseled you to buy of me
[24:03] gold tried in the fire
[24:05] that thou mayest be rich and white
[24:06] raiment that thou mayest be clothed and
[24:08] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[24:10] appear and anoint thine eyes with i said
[24:12] that thou mayest see as many as i love i
[24:15] rebuke and chase and be zealous
[24:16] therefore and repent
[24:19] behold i stand at the door and knock if
[24:22] any man hear my voice and open the door
[24:24] i will come into him and will sup with
[24:26] him and he with me
[24:28] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[24:30] sit with me in my throne even as
[24:32] even as i also overcame in him set down
[24:34] with my father
[24:35] in his throne he that hath an ear let
[24:38] him hear what the spirit saith
[24:40] unto the churches so brother bam
[24:44] picks this up in the church age book in
[24:46] the laodicean church age he says
[24:48] this age is the last of the seven church
[24:50] ages what began in the first or
[24:52] ephesians age must and will come to full
[24:55] fruition and harvest
[24:56] in the last are laid to see an age the
[24:59] two vines will yield their final fruit
[25:00] the two spirits will
[25:02] terminate their manifestation in each of
[25:04] their final destinations
[25:06] the sowing the watering the growing is
[25:08] all over
[25:09] summer has ended the sickle is now
[25:11] thrust into the harvest
[25:14] further down he says the harvest time
[25:16] yes harvest time
[25:18] the two vines that grew together and
[25:20] intertwined their branches are now to be
[25:22] separated
[25:24] the fruits of these vines which were at
[25:25] such variance will be gathered into
[25:27] separate garners
[25:28] the two spirits will go to their
[25:30] separate destinations now it is time to
[25:32] heed the final call
[25:34] that comes only to the wheat bride come
[25:36] out of her my people that you be not
[25:38] partakers of your sins
[25:40] that you we receive not her tares
[25:42] plagues
[25:43] so now brother i'm saying now now we've
[25:46] come to the end
[25:47] everything when we get to the seventh
[25:49] church age everything that began
[25:51] both vines have grown it's gone through
[25:53] the seed planting through the growing
[25:56] through the watering through all phases
[25:58] now it's come to full maturity and now
[26:00] the sickle is thrust in
[26:01] now it's separation time now we go into
[26:04] a harvest cycle
[26:06] not a growing cycle but now we've moved
[26:08] into a harvest cycle and in the harvest
[26:11] cycle
[26:11] he will separate the two and he's got a
[26:14] call that goes forth
[26:15] and revelation 18 says come out of her
[26:17] my people
[26:19] amen we know the prophet of god amen he
[26:22] was calling from earth
[26:23] come out of her and he said it echoed
[26:26] from heaven
[26:26] come out of her my people
[26:33] now
[26:36] now brother van comes further down and
[26:40] or actually earlier in the same message
[26:41] later seeing church age and he reads
[26:43] what we just read
[26:45] uh this portion verse 15 through 19.
[26:49] and he says as we have read this
[26:51] together i'm sure that you have noticed
[26:53] that the spirit has not said one kind
[26:55] thing about this
[26:56] age
[27:02] he makes two indictments and pronounces
[27:04] his sentence upon them
[27:07] i know thy works that thou art neither
[27:08] cold nor hot i would that were cold or
[27:10] hot so then because thou art lukewarm
[27:12] and neither cold nor hot
[27:13] i will spew the out of my mouth we are
[27:16] going to look at this carefully it says
[27:18] that this laodicean church age group is
[27:20] lukewarm
[27:21] this lukewarmness demands a penalty from
[27:24] god the penalty is that they will be
[27:26] spewed out of his mouth
[27:27] there is where we want to we don't want
[27:30] to go astray as
[27:31] a lot of folks do the very unwise say
[27:34] that god can spew out of his mouth and
[27:36] that proves that there is no such thing
[27:38] any truth to the doctrine of the
[27:39] perseverance of saints
[27:41] he's speaking of eternal security i want
[27:44] to correct your thinking right now
[27:46] this first is not given to an individual
[27:49] it is given to the church he is talking
[27:52] to the church
[27:55] so don't we'll misunderstand revelation
[27:58] if we
[27:59] don't catch this understanding will
[28:02] miss much of the revelation that he's
[28:04] not speaking to the individual
[28:06] he's speaking to the church and he's
[28:09] saying i will spew you out of my mouth
[28:11] amen he cannot spew his elect out of his
[28:14] mouth
[28:14] he's promised there's precious promises
[28:16] they cannot be separated from his love
[28:18] nothing shall separate us from the love
[28:20] of god amen but now he's speaking to the
[28:23] church
[28:23] and is he's indicting them for the wrong
[28:26] and he's pronouncing judgment
[28:28] and that judgment is a spewing out or a
[28:31] separating from the person of christ
[28:33] himself
[28:35] so now there's a separation that is
[28:37] going to take place
[28:39] and we see because they put him out amen
[28:42] at the end of the age he said behold i
[28:44] stand at the door and knock
[28:47] if any man hear my knock
[28:51] if any men hear my voice
[28:55] in the garden of eden when adam and
[28:57] sinned god came knocking
[29:00] and he heard the voice of god come
[29:03] walking in the garden
[29:04] he didn't see his footsteps he didn't
[29:06] see his legs through the tree
[29:08] amen he heard the voice of god come
[29:10] walking in the garden
[29:12] amen and now christ has come in the last
[29:15] age
[29:15] amen and he's come to a church that has
[29:18] pushed him to the outside
[29:19] and he comes knocking on the door if you
[29:22] hear my knock
[29:23] no he's knocking on the door by his
[29:25] voice when you hear his voice
[29:27] that's the knock on the door and brother
[29:29] man said not to the individual heart
[29:32] but to the church he's trying to get
[29:34] back into the church
[29:35] and the church refuses to let him in
[29:37] when he comes as a son of man ministry
[29:40] a son of man revealing the son of man
[29:42] and the church
[29:43] shut the door to him and wouldn't let
[29:45] him in and what was he doing service
[29:47] after service revelation after
[29:49] revelation he was
[29:50] knocking on the door of the laodicean
[29:52] church
[29:54] and they would not and he pronounces a
[29:57] judgment
[29:58] and i will spew thee out of my mouth
[30:02] because you're neither cold nor hot
[30:05] you'll just take it and that
[30:06] will go to the surface and not hear the
[30:08] doctrine
[30:10] say it's fine and whatever it's one of
[30:13] these you can have this way or that way
[30:16] you can have it any way you like i'll
[30:19] spew you out of my mouth
[30:22] so now we see in the seventh church age
[30:25] a harvest cycle an absolute separation
[30:30] christ is separated from the church and
[30:32] the church is separated from christ
[30:36] you notice i didn't mention the bride
[30:39] because brother venom didn't mention the
[30:40] bride this is speaking to the church
[30:46] he back in the quote we just read he
[30:48] says as we have read this together
[30:50] i'm sure that you have noticed that the
[30:51] spirit has not said
[30:53] one kind thing about this age
[30:58] that's interesting because if you come
[31:01] to the end of the age which is the end
[31:03] that brother
[31:04] brother branham came to the end of the
[31:06] age
[31:08] the messenger always comes at the end of
[31:09] the previous age to bring him to another
[31:11] age
[31:13] so he comes at the end of the age and at
[31:15] the end of the age you find the
[31:17] laodicean church
[31:18] in this condition now that doesn't mean
[31:19] there wasn't bride in the laodicean
[31:21] church in the pentecostal church
[31:23] it doesn't mean they weren't there but
[31:24] by the time this pronouncement comes by
[31:26] the time the prophet comes
[31:28] to declare this and show this at the end
[31:30] of the laodicean church age
[31:32] she's gone into absolute apostasy
[31:33] there's no light there
[31:35] the moon's gone into a total blackout
[31:40] so now when brother brahma says he
[31:42] doesn't have
[31:43] one nice thing you know
[31:47] the spirit hath not one kind thing to
[31:49] say about this age
[31:51] my question is where is the bride
[31:57] how can the spirit look down and in
[31:59] every age i i know your work i see your
[32:01] patience i see your tribulation
[32:03] i see this but when he comes to the
[32:05] legacy and church age at the end of the
[32:06] legacy in church
[32:07] he looks and says i've got nothing good
[32:10] to say about this church
[32:11] i mean how can he say that if his bride
[32:14] is there
[32:15] [Music]
[32:17] i'd be like brothers if you come into if
[32:20] you come into a group of people and your
[32:21] wife is sitting there
[32:22] and you're looking at a group of women
[32:24] over there and your wife is there and
[32:26] you say i don't see
[32:27] one good thing
[32:34] over there i'll point here
[32:39] these would be full of ladies your
[32:41] wife's sitting in the middle you say i
[32:42] don't see
[32:43] one good thing over here not one
[32:45] characteristic that i can point out
[32:49] you have an interesting conversation
[32:51] when you get home
[32:56] be the same thing as as brother branham
[32:58] looking here the spirit calling out
[33:00] amen to this age and not one good thing
[33:03] to say about this age
[33:05] it shows that the bride is not there at
[33:08] this time
[33:10] if the bride was there the spirit would
[33:11] have to acknowledge it
[33:13] amen in every age there's
[33:14] acknowledgement of the true vine until
[33:16] you get to the seventh age
[33:17] and there's no acknowledgment of the
[33:19] true vine it means that there's a
[33:20] harvest time
[33:21] a harvest cycle where the true vine is
[33:24] separated from the false vine
[33:25] and now this declaration is to the
[33:27] church
[33:30] not to the bride
[33:33] brother says god hiding himself in
[33:35] simplicity i believe the laodicean age
[33:37] is the pentecostal age
[33:39] where she comes to the place of lukewarm
[33:41] and god spews her from his mouth
[33:43] and there's where she comes right now
[33:45] the pentecostal movement has come to
[33:47] that place
[33:48] lukewarm not red hot not ice cold you're
[33:51] not cold and formal neither are you hot
[33:53] you're in the spewing stage and you're
[33:56] going
[33:56] jesus the only age he stood on the
[33:59] outside the church the dogmas had put
[34:01] him out
[34:02] knocking trying to get back in the door
[34:04] lo i stand at the door and knock
[34:06] if any man hear my voice then back in
[34:08] the laodicean church age he says now
[34:11] he has cried out to this age you have
[34:13] the word you have more bibles than ever
[34:15] but you're not doing anything about the
[34:17] word except dividing and hacking it in
[34:19] pieces
[34:20] taking what you want and leaving what
[34:22] you don't want you are not
[34:23] interested in living it but debating it
[34:26] i would sooner you were cold or hot if
[34:28] you were cold and rejected it i could
[34:30] stand that
[34:31] if you would get white hot to know its
[34:32] truth and live it i would praise you for
[34:34] that
[34:35] but when you simply take my word and
[34:37] don't honor it i
[34:38] in return must refuse to honor you i
[34:40] will spew you out of my
[34:42] i i will spew you out for you nauseate
[34:45] me
[34:46] he's not talking about his bride
[34:50] now anybody knows that it is a lukewarm
[34:53] water that makes you sick at the stomach
[34:54] if you need a medic lukewarm water is
[34:57] about the best thing to drink
[34:59] a lukewarm church has made god sick and
[35:01] he's declared he will spew it out
[35:03] remind us how he felt just before the
[35:05] flood doesn't it
[35:07] all would to god the church were cold or
[35:09] hot best of all
[35:10] she should be fervent hot but she's not
[35:13] sentence has been passed
[35:14] she is no longer god's voice to the
[35:16] world she will maintain that she is but
[35:18] god
[35:18] says not oh god still has a voice for
[35:22] the people of the world
[35:23] even as he has given a voice to the
[35:25] bride that voice is in the bride as we
[35:27] have said and we will talk more about
[35:29] that later
[35:31] we'll get we're going to get more into
[35:32] that but
[35:34] what i want to point out is what brother
[35:36] branham said you nauseate me
[35:38] he's not talking to his bride he's
[35:40] talking to a church now
[35:41] something has transpired here in the
[35:44] seventh church age amen that will give
[35:46] the spirit amen the spirit now
[35:49] is declaring a true judgment not a false
[35:52] judgment
[35:53] and that true judgment has not one kind
[35:55] thing to say about the age
[35:57] in fact it declares that i will now spew
[35:59] you out of my mouth
[36:00] we find christ on the outside amen he's
[36:03] on the outside of the church
[36:05] but i rest assured he's not on the
[36:07] outside of his bride
[36:09] because this is the age in which he
[36:10] comes in fullness to his bride
[36:13] so he's not on the outside of the bride
[36:15] he's on the outside of the false vine
[36:17] amen he's not spewing out the true body
[36:20] spewing out the false vine
[36:21] this is harvest time this is capstone
[36:24] time
[36:24] this is adoption time this is every seed
[36:27] coming to full fruition time
[36:29] amen the spirit is declaring accurately
[36:31] there's nothing to acknowledge because
[36:33] there's no
[36:34] part of christ left in this age
[36:40] hey amen the sickle has been thrust in
[36:46] and he's pulled his bride out with what
[36:49] a voice the same voice
[36:54] that come looking for adam
[36:57] adam adam where are you adam was hiding
[37:00] amongst the trees amen
[37:02] hiding in the population hiding
[37:05] amongst the people he was hiding and he
[37:07] clothed himself in religion
[37:10] oh friends where did god find you when
[37:13] he came
[37:14] in the cool of the evening the evening
[37:15] time in the setting sun
[37:17] where did he find you he found you
[37:19] hiding out amongst humanity
[37:21] covered in some form of religion
[37:26] adam was not able to respond to that
[37:28] voice the way he should have
[37:29] but it's different this time friends
[37:32] because the lamb has been slain the book
[37:34] of redemption has been
[37:36] taken now we've come into the full cycle
[37:38] of redemption
[37:39] and now instead of running away amen
[37:41] we're running to that voice
[37:43] because now there was cherubims that
[37:44] were keeping them from the tree of life
[37:46] but those same cherubims are now
[37:48] driving them back to the tree of life
[37:52] and now we've heard a voice in this day
[37:54] amen to a fallen humanity
[37:56] amen i mean they've gone through the
[37:58] cycle of destruction the cycle of fall
[38:01] and a voice came in the evening time
[38:06] and that voice was calling adam
[38:09] adam where are you adam
[38:13] where are you i hid myself because i was
[38:18] afraid
[38:19] because i was naked who told you you
[38:23] were naked
[38:27] it's a different call now friends
[38:30] god has exchanged our religious covering
[38:32] of fig leaves
[38:34] for the covering of his word
[38:38] and now by the washing of the water the
[38:39] word he's washed all the filth he's
[38:42] washed all the pollution away
[38:43] amen and now he now he has dressed us in
[38:47] the wedding garment of his word
[38:48] amen spotless white amen without shame
[38:52] amen now she can run to him because she
[38:54] has on the wedding garment
[38:56] when she hears the voice she can drop
[38:58] the fig leaves
[38:59] and run and be clothed amen and their
[39:01] shame be taken away
[39:06] but not in laodicea
[39:11] do you understand this not happening
[39:13] later to see is being spewed out
[39:16] he's talking to a church let's look at
[39:19] revelation chapter 17.
[39:31] revelation 17 1 and there came one of
[39:34] the seven angels which had the seven
[39:35] vials and talked with me saying unto me
[39:38] come hither
[39:38] i will show unto thee the judgment of
[39:40] the great that sitteth upon many
[39:42] waters
[39:43] so now we have one of the seven angels
[39:45] which had the seven vials and we know
[39:46] this is brother branham's ministry
[39:48] he's the one who shows us the great he
[39:51] shows us the judgment of the
[39:53] how's the judged by atomic fire
[39:56] who drops the bomb
[39:58] russia how do you know that right the
[40:01] only way that you will be shown the
[40:03] destruction
[40:04] amen of the great is if there's
[40:06] been one of the seven angels with the
[40:08] seven last vials that has come and told
[40:09] you
[40:13] who is this talking all the way through
[40:15] the book of revelation did brother
[40:16] branham only have a ministry in the
[40:18] first three chapters of the first four
[40:20] now you can find that ministry from the
[40:22] from the very beginning
[40:23] all the way through you can find that
[40:25] ministry
[40:30] so now he comes in in 1804
[40:35] he says and i heard another voice from
[40:37] heaven saying come out of her
[40:38] my people that ye be not partakers of
[40:40] her sins and that you receive
[40:42] none of her plagues this is important
[40:45] that
[40:45] that we understand that brother branham
[40:48] is the one
[40:48] he's the angel on earth calling this out
[40:52] but he's saying when he calls it out
[40:53] it's echoed from heaven when he calls it
[40:55] out and it's echoed from heaven
[40:57] whose voice is that saying come out of
[41:00] her my people
[41:02] whose people who does the bride belong
[41:04] to she belongs to christ
[41:06] amen this is god's children god's seat
[41:08] the bride of jesus christ
[41:10] and when he's when when brother branham
[41:12] says come out of her
[41:13] leave these denominations leave these
[41:15] creeds leave these dogmas
[41:16] it's echoed from heaven and you're not
[41:18] just hearing the voice of the seventh
[41:20] angel
[41:20] but there's something echoing from
[41:22] heaven and if you have the receiver to
[41:24] pick up the voice of him knocking at the
[41:26] door
[41:27] you can receive the message from heaven
[41:30] [Applause]
[41:32] you heard it through naturals it came
[41:34] through natural lips it's on a natural
[41:35] tape
[41:36] amen but it's echoed from heaven and
[41:38] that echo from heaven is what awakens
[41:40] the seed on the inside
[41:45] we drop our fig leaves and take the
[41:47] wedding garment
[41:49] let's go to second corinthians chapter
[41:51] six
[41:55] brother branham ties these two
[41:57] scriptures together
[41:58] in the church age book revelation 18 4
[42:02] and second corinthians 6.
[42:07] ii corinthians chapter 6 verse 17.
[42:14] wherefore come out from among them and
[42:17] be
[42:18] separate saith the lord and touch not
[42:20] the unclean thing and i will receive you
[42:23] and and will be a father unto you and
[42:25] you shall be my sons and daughters saith
[42:27] the lord
[42:27] almighty now brother venom comes in the
[42:30] laodicean church age
[42:32] in the church age book and he lists
[42:34] these two scriptures one on top of the
[42:36] other
[42:36] romans 18 4 and second corinthians 6 17
[42:39] and 18.
[42:40] and he actually reads verse 14 all the
[42:42] way to 18 and second corinthians 6.
[42:46] but before that he says and that and
[42:47] that is what the church has constantly
[42:49] done through the ages
[42:51] she has left the word of god and taken
[42:54] her own creeds and dongles she has
[42:56] organized and joined herself to the
[42:58] world
[42:59] thus she is naked and god is judging her
[43:02] lewdness the only way she can get out of
[43:04] this dread situation
[43:06] is by obeying the word the lord to come
[43:08] back to his word
[43:10] the only way she can leave this is by
[43:12] obeying the lord by coming back to the
[43:14] word
[43:14] and then he reads two scriptures
[43:16] revelations 18 4
[43:18] come out from among her my people and in
[43:20] second corinthians
[43:22] 6 14 to 18 which says come come
[43:25] come out from among them and be separate
[43:27] saith the lord
[43:28] he reads those two together and then he
[43:31] says
[43:32] after the end of those scriptures he
[43:34] said there is a price to pay for those
[43:35] garments
[43:36] and that is the price of separation
[43:41] because there was not one good thing to
[43:43] say
[43:44] to the laodicean church age to the
[43:47] church
[43:47] of laodicea you cannot get the garments
[43:52] there
[43:56] the price to pay for putting on those
[43:58] garments
[43:59] is separation you must leave the
[44:03] laodicean church
[44:05] to get these garments because if you
[44:06] could have got the garments there he'd
[44:08] have something good to say about that
[44:10] church
[44:12] but there's a missing acknowledgement
[44:14] what's missing
[44:15] the bride is missing it's obvious in the
[44:18] scriptures
[44:19] god does everything he sets patterns in
[44:20] the scriptures he sets him for a reason
[44:22] to catch our attention
[44:23] amen and in every in this first six
[44:26] church age he's got this pattern laid
[44:27] down
[44:28] acknowledge the good acknowledge the
[44:29] evil and knowledge the true vine
[44:30] acknowledge the false fine
[44:33] until he gets to the seventh there's no
[44:35] acknowledgement for the true vote
[44:37] meaning the true vine is not there
[44:40] you can't find the garment there the
[44:42] price to pay for those garments
[44:44] that is the price of separation
[44:50] now brother benham in the church age
[44:53] book he begins to
[44:54] to share for this curse that now
[44:58] i will spew you out of my mouth you're
[45:00] neither lukewarm you're neither cold or
[45:02] hot but you look where i spew you out of
[45:03] my mouth
[45:04] and brother branham takes it and he
[45:06] begins to explain
[45:08] amen that spewing out of the mouth it's
[45:10] a rejection because you nauseate me but
[45:12] it's
[45:12] also a declaration that you will no
[45:15] longer have my word
[45:16] or speak on my behalf because what comes
[45:20] out of the mouth of god
[45:21] is the word and so what's happening is
[45:23] i'm spewing you out of my mouth
[45:25] i'm separating you from my word
[45:28] because god is the word in the beginning
[45:31] was the word and the word was with god
[45:32] and the word was god
[45:34] so god is the word so when he spews you
[45:35] out of your mouth he's actually
[45:37] separating you from himself by
[45:39] separating you from the word
[45:42] oh friends this is so important to
[45:44] recognize because when he wants to marry
[45:46] you
[45:46] he marries you by uniting you with the
[45:49] word amen when he wants to separate from
[45:51] you he separates you from his word
[45:54] so many people want to be married to
[45:56] jesus christ and in their imagination
[45:58] they imagine
[45:59] a a a robe clad garment a robo
[46:03] a robe clad individual a man with a
[46:05] beard and they want to go up and put
[46:06] their arms around him married to that
[46:08] but you can't marry that form in this
[46:10] day
[46:12] you can't wrap your arms around that
[46:14] flesh body
[46:15] amen you cannot go up and hug you cannot
[46:18] kiss his feet
[46:19] the only way that you can come in
[46:21] contact with that body
[46:22] that body was the word made flesh and
[46:25] now
[46:25] the word has been restored and the only
[46:27] way to embrace
[46:29] that being is to embrace that word amen
[46:32] and because they refused to embrace the
[46:34] word
[46:35] he spewed them out of his mouth and he
[46:37] separated from
[46:38] his word and said you will never no
[46:40] longer speak on my behalf
[46:42] because you don't have the word because
[46:44] you've put me out and i've thrust you
[46:46] from being the mouthpiece
[46:51] so now they can
[46:54] they cannot without the word speak for
[46:58] god they cannot
[46:59] without the word be the bride they
[47:02] cannot without the word be united to god
[47:06] it's so clear friends there's
[47:09] such denominational concepts that creep
[47:12] in
[47:12] and still want to hang on and we've got
[47:14] to get rid of them
[47:16] because if i love jesus christ with all
[47:17] my heart and i want to embrace jesus
[47:20] christ
[47:20] i've got to take this fully revealed
[47:22] word and wrap my whole self in it and
[47:24] take it in me
[47:25] and pour myself in that and become with
[47:27] the one with that and when i do i am
[47:29] united with the lamb
[47:30] when i do that i'm married to god
[47:34] but if i reject that word i have
[47:36] rejected my mate if i reject that word
[47:39] i've rejected my husband
[47:41] and because they rejected their mate
[47:44] rejected their husband the revealed word
[47:46] and put him on the outside he was
[47:48] knocking with a voice to get in but they
[47:50] would not take him in
[47:51] and so he spewed them out of his mouth
[47:53] and said you will not speak for me
[47:55] so now there's going to be another
[47:57] people that can speak because there is
[47:58] not
[47:59] a church age that can speak for him
[48:01] anymore the laodicean church
[48:03] cannot give the word of god
[48:08] you understand cannot give the word of
[48:11] god
[48:15] cannot bring people to the blood
[48:21] because they refused the path to the
[48:23] blood which is the word
[48:25] and they've been separated from the word
[48:27] and spewed out of the mouth of god
[48:29] and no longer have the word and now they
[48:31] cannot
[48:32] the laodicean church cannot bring people
[48:35] to the blood
[48:36] [Music]
[48:38] it doesn't matter how much blood they
[48:40] talk about in the sermon and blood
[48:41] sacrifice
[48:42] because we know that when that blood was
[48:43] shed it released a life that life is
[48:46] attached to the word the words that i
[48:48] speak are spirit and life to get that
[48:50] blood you have to get that
[48:51] life that life is attached to the word
[48:53] without the word you don't get the life
[48:55] without the life you have not the blood
[48:58] so the laodicean church the church ages
[49:00] is finished amen he's capped it off
[49:03] by bringing a bride out of laodicea into
[49:05] that eighth portion which is him
[49:07] christ himself the headship and now she
[49:10] is declaring the headship the capstone
[49:14] charity and that
[49:16] is the place amen to find the mouth of
[49:19] god
[49:20] that is the place to find the word of
[49:21] god she is now
[49:23] the voice of god the final voice to the
[49:26] final age
[49:31] praise be the god why because she's
[49:34] received jesus christ
[49:36] the manifested word for her day
[49:39] and she's united with her husband her
[49:42] mate
[49:42] the manifested word for her day and now
[49:46] amen now she is in the mouth of god
[49:51] not spewed out of the mouth of god but
[49:52] in the mouth of god speaking the words
[49:54] of god
[49:55] she has the words of life
[50:01] they do they brother brahm says they
[50:03] think they're getting people to the
[50:04] blood but they've rejected the path
[50:07] to the blood which is the word
[50:12] all we have to do is accept the
[50:14] scriptures
[50:16] that there is no acknowledgement of a
[50:18] bride in laodicea
[50:20] [Music]
[50:21] so now we've got to go somewhere else to
[50:24] find this bride
[50:28] we have to look somewhere else than the
[50:30] latest in churches to find this bride
[50:32] now listen friends i am not talking
[50:35] about segments of time on calendars
[50:38] i'm talking about dispensations of
[50:40] operation
[50:41] and god is no longer operating in the
[50:44] laodicean church
[50:46] that laodicean church is in the
[50:48] laodicean age continuing on today
[50:52] the world the church the church is in
[50:56] the laodicean age
[50:58] you accept that but i want to say the
[51:01] bride is not
[51:04] because if the bride was there he would
[51:06] have something good to say about it
[51:11] i love the word of god i love it it
[51:14] reinforces everything brother banh said
[51:16] amen brother branham
[51:18] he was seeing these things and he was
[51:20] explaining it in the way that he
[51:22] had the limited vocabulary and
[51:24] understanding
[51:25] and he just was explaining it the way
[51:26] that he could
[51:28] but he was speaking directly what was in
[51:30] the scriptures
[51:32] he saw it in the word amen and we can
[51:35] look in the word
[51:36] and see the same thing and now our
[51:39] confidence is not in
[51:40] well i heard somebody say this no no but
[51:42] our confidence that prophet brought us
[51:43] back to the word
[51:44] the word is my mate the word is my
[51:47] husband i'm united with the word because
[51:49] i see it in the word
[51:52] praise be to god
[51:57] now in the literacy and church age
[52:02] he says but thank god at this moment
[52:04] this age is not over
[52:06] he is yet crying and his cry is not only
[52:08] in the spiritual ears of men by a spirit
[52:11] but once again a prophet is in the land
[52:13] once more god will reveal the truth as
[52:15] he did to paul
[52:16] in the days of the seventh messenger in
[52:18] the days of the laodicean age
[52:19] its messenger will reveal the mysteries
[52:21] of god as revealed to paul
[52:24] he will speak out and those who receive
[52:26] that prophet in his own name will
[52:27] receive the beneficent effect
[52:29] of the prophet's ministry and they that
[52:32] hear him will be blessed and receive
[52:34] part that then become part of the bride
[52:36] of the last day
[52:37] who are mentioned in revelation 22 17
[52:40] and the spirit and the bride say come
[52:44] what are the spirit and the bride
[52:45] bidding them to come to
[52:47] to come to the river of life
[52:50] so they're bidding them to come to the
[52:53] source of life
[52:54] to the river of life and drink
[52:57] so at the very end amen now
[53:00] now the the laodicean church has been
[53:03] spewed out of his mouth separated from
[53:04] him he's been put on the outside
[53:06] but the bride now is standing as the
[53:08] final voice of the vinyl age
[53:10] and she's saying come come come where
[53:13] come to what come to her she no she's
[53:16] not saying come to me
[53:17] she's saying come and drink of the water
[53:19] of life freely
[53:23] she must know where it's at she must be
[53:26] with it
[53:28] because she's saying come she's not
[53:30] saying go
[53:32] come
[53:35] the corner wheat the bride wheat that
[53:37] fell in the ground at nicaea
[53:40] has come back to the original word grain
[53:42] again
[53:43] praise god forever yes listen to the
[53:45] authenticated prophet of god who appears
[53:47] in the last stage
[53:48] what he says from god the bride will say
[53:52] amen the spirit
[53:55] and the prophet and the bride will be
[53:57] saying the same thing
[54:00] and what they will say will have already
[54:02] been said in the word
[54:04] they are saying it now come out from
[54:06] among her now and be ye
[54:08] separate brother branham just said
[54:12] the spirit and the prophet and the bride
[54:13] will be saying the same thing
[54:15] what they will be saying will have
[54:16] already been said in the word what word
[54:19] revelation 18 4 and 2nd corinthians 6
[54:23] 17 put together
[54:26] those are the two scriptures he put
[54:27] together he says come out from among her
[54:30] and be separate why that cry
[54:34] could not be made in the laodicean
[54:36] church
[54:37] because the laodicean church has been
[54:39] spewed out of his mouth and can no
[54:41] longer speak for god
[54:44] so the only way that that cry can go
[54:47] forth
[54:47] is we have to find that bride of
[54:49] revelation 22 17
[54:52] and where are we going to find her we've
[54:53] got to find her somewhere where there's
[54:55] an acknowledgement that she's there
[54:56] because there's no acknowledgement that
[54:58] she's in the laodicean church age
[55:01] so we've got to find her and when we
[55:03] find her
[55:04] amen then we can find that final voice
[55:07] to the final age we can find that cry
[55:09] that the spirit and the prophet and the
[55:11] bride are saying the same thing
[55:13] becoming the mouthpiece of god now
[55:15] speaking
[55:16] come to the river of life come to the
[55:18] fountain of life
[55:21] praise god
[55:25] brother branham in the first seal
[55:30] we all know this but i'm just going to
[55:31] read it because it's so good so now
[55:33] watch he said
[55:34] it would be known in the last day
[55:37] but it comes forth in a church symbol do
[55:39] you understand in
[55:41] it church it comes forth in a symbol of
[55:43] a church that they
[55:44] know there is a seal but just what it is
[55:46] yet they don't know
[55:48] because it's the white horse rider now i
[55:51] love this
[55:52] because brother ben is about ready to
[55:54] say something but he's prefacing it
[55:55] and he's saying now it comes forth in a
[55:57] church seal
[55:59] in a church seal the church
[56:03] sees the symbol but doesn't have the
[56:04] interpretation of the symbol
[56:07] that's a church seal
[56:11] i'm not interested in church seals i
[56:13] want the bride seal
[56:16] amen you realize it
[56:19] the church for 2 000 years has been
[56:22] seeing
[56:23] amend seals in symbol form the church
[56:25] has had the seven seals
[56:27] open in symbol form because the lamb
[56:30] took the book in revelation chapter 5
[56:32] chapter 6
[56:33] he opened the seal when he opened the
[56:35] seal a symbol came out and the church
[56:37] has had
[56:38] amen the seal the church seal has been
[56:41] the symbol of the white horse rider
[56:44] but now he's rejected the church he
[56:47] separated the two vines
[56:48] he could not give the interpretation to
[56:51] the mixed audience
[56:52] so first he must stand at the door and
[56:55] knock
[56:55] when they refuse he spews them out of
[56:57] the mouth the sickle is thrust in
[56:59] he separates it to the vine when he gets
[57:01] the bride off to himself
[57:03] now he can begin to whisper love secrets
[57:06] to her
[57:06] what the church can't have the bride can
[57:10] have
[57:12] that's why he sent a prophet in our day
[57:14] and that's why he sent a prophet with
[57:16] such an unusual ministry
[57:17] that he would declare every sign that
[57:20] jesus showed so that the church would be
[57:22] without excuse for denying him
[57:24] but he would speak things in such a form
[57:26] they would confuse the theology
[57:28] it would confuse the learning it would
[57:30] confuse the understanding
[57:31] and they would be so bent out of shape
[57:33] that although they could see
[57:34] all the works of jesus christ they could
[57:36] not hear the voice of jesus christ
[57:38] knocking in the age
[57:41] because they would say what's this he
[57:42] saying i don't understand about this and
[57:44] serpent seed in it we know it was an
[57:46] apple what do you mean adultery in the
[57:49] garden
[57:50] amen so i mean so speaking such a
[57:53] foreign language to the churches
[57:57] they had so corrupted and polluted the
[58:00] word until he was speaking
[58:01] in an unknown language
[58:06] and they rejected him not because of the
[58:10] works
[58:16] jesus said for which of the works do you
[58:18] condemn me
[58:20] they didn't condemn brother brennan for
[58:22] one of his works
[58:28] but for making the bride equal to christ
[58:30] [Music]
[58:32] [Applause]
[58:33] for making her him
[58:37] for making amen the final voice in the
[58:40] final age
[58:41] amen come through her
[58:44] we'll condemn you for that you making
[58:47] yourself equal to god
[58:49] that's why we condemn you you making
[58:50] yourself equal to christ you
[58:52] say amen this is christ in feminine form
[58:54] this is the bride form of christ this is
[58:56] christ in the formation of the bride
[58:58] because you draw an equal sign between
[59:00] christ and the bride we'll condemn you
[59:02] for that we'll reject you for that
[59:05] but not for your works
[59:08] they were rejecting his teaching and
[59:10] standing in line to get healed
[59:18] it's the same thing friends
[59:21] there's been a church seal for 2000
[59:24] years
[59:26] he couldn't give it to the laodicean
[59:27] church age
[59:29] he couldn't give it to the latest in
[59:30] church the pentecostal age
[59:33] they couldn't handle it
[59:36] he says it's come forth in the symbol of
[59:39] a church that they know there's a seal
[59:42] but just what it is yet they don't know
[59:44] because it's a white horse rider
[59:48] and it only is to be revealed at the
[59:49] last day when this actual
[59:51] seal is broken broken to who
[59:55] not to christ but to the church notice
[59:58] oh my that just makes me tremble i hope
[1:00:01] that the church truly
[1:00:02] understands it see what i mean you
[1:00:04] people i'm going to call you bride
[1:00:07] see that you'll understand because now
[1:00:11] what are we doing we're separating to
[1:00:13] two vines
[1:00:14] amen it was a church symbol but now it's
[1:00:16] going to be revealed to the true church
[1:00:17] amen but but you're not going to get it
[1:00:20] if i just say church
[1:00:21] because for 2 000 years we've said
[1:00:22] church church church church
[1:00:24] and the church was kind of good kind of
[1:00:26] bad kind of good kind of bad amen in the
[1:00:28] church in that form
[1:00:29] with two vines intertwined could not
[1:00:32] catch the revelation of the symbol
[1:00:34] so now there's going to come forth it's
[1:00:36] going to break into the actual seal
[1:00:39] it's going to be revealed to who not the
[1:00:41] christ amen is going to be revealed to
[1:00:43] who
[1:00:44] to his bride i'm going to call you bride
[1:00:47] so that you'll understand that this is
[1:00:50] not coming to the laodicean church
[1:00:52] it's coming to those that have gone
[1:00:54] beyond the camp
[1:00:57] because he was crucified beyond the camp
[1:01:00] and then they put jesus christ
[1:01:01] out of jerusalem and then they put him
[1:01:04] out of the religion
[1:01:05] they took him outside the camp and they
[1:01:06] crucified him outside the camp
[1:01:08] and in this day they've done the same
[1:01:10] thing because jesus christ came
[1:01:12] a son of man revealed through the the
[1:01:15] son of man revealed through a son of man
[1:01:17] and they put him outside of their camp
[1:01:19] and they crucified him
[1:01:23] and now they've been spewed out of the
[1:01:26] mouth he's been put out
[1:01:28] and now the only way to catch this
[1:01:30] actual seal being broke
[1:01:32] it cannot be broke to the church because
[1:01:34] it's been in church symbol
[1:01:35] amen it can only be broke to the bride
[1:01:39] and the bride has to come out
[1:01:42] of the church system
[1:01:46] it has to be united to christ and says
[1:01:49] i'm going to call you bride
[1:01:50] so that you're gonna so you'll
[1:01:52] understand
[1:01:53] it's going to be broke to you the love
[1:01:56] secrets are going to be whispered
[1:01:57] to you
[1:02:02] that's why brother ben and when he
[1:02:03] starts down this path he said it's been
[1:02:04] broken in symbol form
[1:02:06] but when it's actually broke he knows
[1:02:07] he's coming to the actual break he's in
[1:02:09] the first seal
[1:02:10] amen the lord's already come to him and
[1:02:12] already gave him the revelation of the
[1:02:13] first seal
[1:02:14] and when he gets there he starts saying
[1:02:15] it's been in a church form it's been in
[1:02:17] a church symbol form
[1:02:18] i mean they've had it they've known it's
[1:02:19] a white horse because now it's going to
[1:02:20] be actually broke broke do this just
[1:02:22] makes me tremble
[1:02:23] why because he realizes if it's broke
[1:02:26] actually broke now he's looking at a
[1:02:28] people that's been separated out of
[1:02:30] laodicea
[1:02:31] he has come to the bright age he's
[1:02:33] speaking to the bride of jesus christ
[1:02:35] to a people in a harvest cycle the
[1:02:37] sickle's been thrown in
[1:02:38] the lamb has taken the book and now he's
[1:02:41] trembling
[1:02:41] not because he knows what a white horse
[1:02:43] means but the fact that the seal is
[1:02:45] actually breaking
[1:02:46] declares where we are in time
[1:02:50] amen we've gone beyond these things he's
[1:02:53] moved from those things he's not working
[1:02:55] through the church ages anymore he's not
[1:02:56] working through the churches
[1:02:57] but now he's pulled out his true vine
[1:02:59] and he's got her off to the side
[1:03:01] and he's going to whisper the love
[1:03:02] secrets to her
[1:03:07] it's like you know when you used to have
[1:03:10] a girlfriend and
[1:03:11] you like to get her off by yourself and
[1:03:13] tell her little things and and you'd be
[1:03:15] in a group of people and all of a sudden
[1:03:16] people be coming and going and you just
[1:03:17] want them all to go away because you got
[1:03:19] something you want to tell her
[1:03:21] and you look at her kind of like this
[1:03:26] you're trying to get her to take the i
[1:03:28] want to i want to tell you something you
[1:03:29] got to get off here by myself by
[1:03:31] yourself
[1:03:32] there's things i'm not going to speak
[1:03:33] openly
[1:03:35] sometimes my husband and wife they'll
[1:03:37] just have that look you know they'll be
[1:03:38] you know they may have company or their
[1:03:40] kids might be around and all of a sudden
[1:03:41] one will look this way won't look that
[1:03:42] way
[1:03:42] next thing you know the two of them
[1:03:43] disappear into the other room they both
[1:03:45] have to get something
[1:03:52] why he had to get her drawn off to the
[1:03:56] side
[1:03:57] without bringing the false mind
[1:04:00] he couldn't say it outright
[1:04:05] he couldn't bring somebody with a wide
[1:04:07] vocabulary
[1:04:08] could easily explain it all but he had
[1:04:10] to get it said in a certain way
[1:04:11] that the false vine wouldn't come along
[1:04:13] then only the bride would catch the
[1:04:14] innuendos and they'll catch the movement
[1:04:17] of the eyes and catch all of these
[1:04:19] things that were slipped in
[1:04:20] so she will come away amen and go
[1:04:23] what was that you wanted to say yeah
[1:04:27] it's the separation of the bride from
[1:04:29] the church
[1:04:31] he says in works his faith expressed
[1:04:33] from 1965 god
[1:04:35] to the pentecostal church of this day
[1:04:36] the restoration of the gifts
[1:04:38] he's in prayer now may lord
[1:04:41] those men maybe some of them present
[1:04:43] here some of them hearing the tape
[1:04:45] around the world
[1:04:46] may they realize that this is the
[1:04:47] calling out of the bride
[1:04:50] not a pentecostal message the
[1:04:52] pentecostal message was to restore the
[1:04:54] gifts back
[1:04:54] in the church but this is the calling
[1:04:57] forth of the bride
[1:04:58] another message
[1:05:01] that was to come just before sodom was
[1:05:03] to be burned
[1:05:05] he says in jehovah jireh from 62 oh we
[1:05:08] realize that the pentecostal church age
[1:05:10] in the last day
[1:05:11] is the laodicean church age the only one
[1:05:14] that christ was put out of the church
[1:05:15] standing knocking trying to get back in
[1:05:17] oh god be merciful he goes on
[1:05:21] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:05:23] and forever in 1963
[1:05:25] but this is the lord jesus christ in the
[1:05:27] form of the holy spirit moving among his
[1:05:29] people
[1:05:29] doing the same thing that he did when he
[1:05:31] was here on earth identifying himself
[1:05:33] with his bride
[1:05:34] not the church there is a difference
[1:05:38] between the church
[1:05:40] and the bride when we come to this spot
[1:05:44] now there's a difference between the
[1:05:46] church and the bride and he's no longer
[1:05:48] going to talk to the church
[1:05:49] anymore now he's going to talk to the
[1:05:51] bride
[1:05:53] the sickle's been thrust in the bride
[1:05:55] has been pulled out of the church
[1:05:57] and now he's speaking to the bride not
[1:05:59] to the church
[1:06:00] every other church age he had a message
[1:06:02] for both
[1:06:05] but in the last church age he just was
[1:06:07] acknowledging that there's just the
[1:06:08] false vine there
[1:06:15] in shalom 1964
[1:06:18] he says god is a jealous god
[1:06:21] he is jealous and he wants his wife pure
[1:06:24] he wants her a virgin chase nothing in
[1:06:26] the world into her
[1:06:28] at all altogether his word part of him
[1:06:30] we must be part of the word not part of
[1:06:32] the creed a part of the word
[1:06:34] not a part of the church a part of the
[1:06:36] bride
[1:06:38] church is condemned we know that she
[1:06:42] goes out to outer darkness but the bride
[1:06:44] goes up
[1:06:46] brother brahm would then point to the
[1:06:49] the newspapers carrying the blackout of
[1:06:53] the moon
[1:06:54] the eclipse of the moon and he shows
[1:06:56] that there's only six pictures there
[1:06:58] and those six pictures match exactly
[1:07:00] what he drew on the board when he drew
[1:07:01] out the church ages as moons with little
[1:07:03] lights
[1:07:04] and and and the holy spirit drew it on
[1:07:05] the back wall of the church
[1:07:07] to confirm it and then he said the third
[1:07:08] is a witness too and god drew it in the
[1:07:10] skies
[1:07:10] but he says you see the one that god do
[1:07:12] in the skies didn't have that seventh
[1:07:14] picture
[1:07:16] he said because when god showed it in
[1:07:17] the skies it was completely blacked out
[1:07:20] showing the church the laodicean church
[1:07:22] had gone into complete apostasy
[1:07:24] there was no more light there why was
[1:07:26] there no more light there because the
[1:07:28] bride had already been called out
[1:07:31] for them it was the setting of the sun
[1:07:32] for her it was the rising of the sun
[1:07:34] shalom good morning
[1:07:39] so he pulls her out to the rising of the
[1:07:41] sun but the rest of the world moves into
[1:07:43] the setting of the sun
[1:07:47] now you're not part of the church
[1:07:50] part of the bride the church is
[1:07:53] condemned
[1:07:55] now let's go to revelation 19.
[1:08:13] revelation 19 and verse 7
[1:08:18] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:08:20] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:08:22] lamb has come
[1:08:23] and his wife have made herself ready and
[1:08:26] her was granted that she should be
[1:08:27] arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[1:08:29] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:08:32] of the saints
[1:08:34] not miserable poor blind
[1:08:37] and naked but there's now a people that
[1:08:40] have got
[1:08:40] eyes to see ears to hear she's got
[1:08:44] all the riches that the word can give
[1:08:46] and all the promises that were given to
[1:08:47] abraham as the royal seat of abraham
[1:08:49] she's got it all
[1:08:52] and she's clothed in the righteousness
[1:08:56] of the saints she's clothed in the word
[1:08:58] of god
[1:09:01] let's go over to revelation 21.
[1:09:05] revelation 21 we'll read verse 9.
[1:09:12] now i want to say this before we begin
[1:09:15] reading
[1:09:17] we came through seven church ages and in
[1:09:20] six
[1:09:21] of the seven church ages we saw an
[1:09:22] acknowledgment of the true vine
[1:09:24] acknowledgement of the false mind
[1:09:26] come to the seventh church age we see no
[1:09:27] acknowledgment of the true vine
[1:09:29] you have to ask yourself where did she
[1:09:30] go where did she go if she's not there
[1:09:34] if there's nothing good to say at all
[1:09:36] they can't say one kind thing
[1:09:38] about the laodicean church and then
[1:09:40] where did she go
[1:09:41] because there's got to be a bride
[1:09:43] somewhere
[1:09:45] and she's not there where is she so
[1:09:48] there's got to be a voice amen
[1:09:50] that can give the right acknowledgement
[1:09:56] the spirit speaking the latest in church
[1:09:58] age couldn't acknowledge
[1:10:00] but there's a voice of the seventh angel
[1:10:02] can acknowledge and show you where she's
[1:10:03] at
[1:10:05] revelation 21 and nine
[1:10:08] and there came unto me one of the seven
[1:10:09] angels which had the seven vials full of
[1:10:11] the seven last plagues
[1:10:13] and talked with me saying come hither i
[1:10:15] will show thee the bride
[1:10:17] the lamb's wife if you can't
[1:10:20] find her in in the in the
[1:10:24] message of the spirit to the laodicean
[1:10:26] church amen then you
[1:10:27] have to listen to the message of the
[1:10:29] seventh angel because the message of the
[1:10:31] seventh angel will tell you where she's
[1:10:33] at
[1:10:33] [Applause]
[1:10:35] the spirit speaking in the seventh
[1:10:37] church age cannot have one kind thing to
[1:10:39] say
[1:10:40] about the latest in church saying that
[1:10:41] the bride's not there amen but there's a
[1:10:44] voice amen there's a voice on earth that
[1:10:46] will declare who she is and where she is
[1:10:48] and it's the voice of the seventh angel
[1:10:50] one of the seven angels having the seven
[1:10:52] bibles says i will
[1:10:53] show you i will
[1:10:57] show you the bride the lamb's wife
[1:11:00] and he carried me away in the spirit to
[1:11:02] a great and high mountain and he showed
[1:11:04] me the great city
[1:11:05] the holy jerusalem descending out of
[1:11:06] heaven from god having the glory of god
[1:11:09] and her light was likened to a stone
[1:11:11] most precious even like a jasper stone
[1:11:14] clear as crystal so the seventh angel
[1:11:18] amen begins to tell you amen that that
[1:11:21] this bride is now the new jerusalem
[1:11:25] this bride is that city that's four
[1:11:28] square
[1:11:28] this is the bride that has the lamb
[1:11:30] sitting on the throne where the lamb is
[1:11:32] the light thereof
[1:11:33] and that lamb is emanating the light of
[1:11:35] the lamb is emanating from out of that
[1:11:37] city
[1:11:39] that's why brother venom will come to
[1:11:40] future home and he begin
[1:11:42] typing typing the future home the
[1:11:44] renovation of the earth and the city
[1:11:46] coming down
[1:11:46] and he starts to type it with your
[1:11:48] conversion
[1:11:50] why is he drawing a parallel between god
[1:11:52] renovating the earth
[1:11:54] and bringing this city down to rest upon
[1:11:56] our earth that's burnt over and
[1:11:57] renovated
[1:11:57] and he's typing it to your conversion
[1:12:00] amen because he's trying to show
[1:12:01] you're the city you're the dwelling
[1:12:03] place you're the temple
[1:12:05] you're the habitation of god you are the
[1:12:07] place on earth where this city is
[1:12:09] resting
[1:12:11] and he gets into that place and he says
[1:12:13] now amen i would like to i could drop a
[1:12:15] little something here if you'd like me
[1:12:16] to
[1:12:17] and he says and when he drops a little
[1:12:18] something he says now
[1:12:20] this these so many cubits and furlongs
[1:12:22] this and that he says it's like 1500
[1:12:24] miles by
[1:12:24] 1500 miles he said about what we have
[1:12:28] here in the church from maine down to to
[1:12:30] arkansas and
[1:12:32] whatever about 1500 miles square
[1:12:36] a little over half of the united states
[1:12:38] and he said about what we got
[1:12:39] represented
[1:12:40] right here this morning what's he
[1:12:42] showing you he's showing you the lamb's
[1:12:44] wife
[1:12:46] the ones who have been called out of
[1:12:47] laodicea called out by a voice that was
[1:12:50] knocking
[1:12:51] called out by a son of man amen a son of
[1:12:54] man revealing the son of man
[1:12:56] the son of man himself knocking at the
[1:12:58] door calling out
[1:13:01] those who have gone outside the camp
[1:13:03] those who have heard the seventh angel
[1:13:05] and now he's telling them about the
[1:13:07] future home typing it with their
[1:13:09] conversion
[1:13:09] now he's drawing the parallels and
[1:13:11] saying now what we've got in the church
[1:13:14] what's the what was in jeffersonville
[1:13:16] all the people who were listening to
[1:13:18] that voice and had gathered out of the
[1:13:20] churches who were coming
[1:13:21] to the word for their day
[1:13:24] they were representing the bride he says
[1:13:28] what is this what are these dimensions
[1:13:30] he said it's about what we have
[1:13:32] right here this morning
[1:13:35] i'd like to propose to you that one of
[1:13:37] the seven angels having the seven last
[1:13:39] violence has showed us the lamb's wife
[1:13:42] and the called out elected group who
[1:13:44] have gathered to the voice
[1:13:46] who have left traditions who have left
[1:13:48] the nomination who have left the church
[1:13:50] systems who have left the pentecostal
[1:13:51] age
[1:13:52] and come into the bright age
[1:13:57] so there's been an acknowledgment and
[1:14:01] he goes and begins to describe she's
[1:14:03] built on the foundation of the apostles
[1:14:05] her gates
[1:14:06] are the patriarchs her light amen is the
[1:14:09] glory of the lord
[1:14:11] what an acknowledgement friends
[1:14:14] the prophet of god goes on to say i'd
[1:14:17] like to just read this
[1:14:21] in the invisible union of the bride of
[1:14:22] christ
[1:14:24] november 25th 1965.
[1:14:28] brother ben's coming to the last
[1:14:32] couple sermons that whoever preached the
[1:14:34] last part of his ministry he's got one
[1:14:35] month more until he
[1:14:37] leaves the earth
[1:14:41] and i like if i read this i'd like for
[1:14:43] you to read it with this thought in mind
[1:14:46] there was a no acknowledgement given to
[1:14:48] the latest in church age
[1:14:52] but when when there's a people pulled
[1:14:55] out
[1:14:56] and united to christ christ
[1:14:59] is going to give them their
[1:15:00] acknowledgement
[1:15:03] christ now will speak to the true vine
[1:15:07] and i'm going to read this and let it be
[1:15:10] christ
[1:15:10] speaking to the true vine not a mixed
[1:15:13] multitude
[1:15:14] not the true and false interwoven but
[1:15:17] now
[1:15:17] speaking to a called out separated out
[1:15:20] harvest time
[1:15:22] vine he says the apostles
[1:15:26] them who set forth the bible here here
[1:15:29] come
[1:15:30] luther out in reformation his words that
[1:15:32] this church
[1:15:33] won't work today wesley's won't
[1:15:34] pentecost won't it won't work
[1:15:36] it worked in their day but it's another
[1:15:39] day
[1:15:39] this is the opening of the seven seals i
[1:15:42] know it sounds strange to you but god
[1:15:44] has vindicated so perfectly
[1:15:46] there is no question in it just
[1:15:48] perfectly i ain't scattering that to the
[1:15:50] local assembly
[1:15:51] i'm speaking to the people out across
[1:15:52] the nation do what you wish to
[1:15:55] now notice the anointed word of this day
[1:15:58] of which you
[1:15:58] are apart by predestination
[1:16:03] you immediately like knew when you heard
[1:16:05] that you knew right quick that you was
[1:16:07] an eagle
[1:16:08] you always realized that you wasn't a
[1:16:09] denominational chicken to begin with
[1:16:11] you know there is something wrong there
[1:16:13] there is something wrong that's right
[1:16:15] for you know that you were trapped into
[1:16:17] it at the beginning
[1:16:19] he the bridegroom took away your shame
[1:16:21] and put it in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:16:22] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:16:25] and the blood of life
[1:16:26] that's what the bible said your first
[1:16:28] husband that you were married to
[1:16:30] the world the anointed bridegroom which
[1:16:32] for ordained you
[1:16:33] has washed you by the washing of the
[1:16:34] water by the church
[1:16:36] no that don't sound right does it no you
[1:16:40] might find that in the almanac but not
[1:16:41] in god's bible
[1:16:42] by the washing of the water by the word
[1:16:45] in the word see
[1:16:47] you are standing completely justified as
[1:16:50] though you never did it at the beginning
[1:16:54] what is this this is the acknowledgement
[1:16:56] christ what he couldn't say to the
[1:16:58] laodicean church age but when the sickle
[1:17:00] is thrust in and the bride's pulled out
[1:17:02] now he's reserved his acknowledgement
[1:17:05] now so he can pull the bride out to
[1:17:07] himself
[1:17:07] whisper the love secrets now he's going
[1:17:09] to tell her
[1:17:10] he's going to give her the praises that
[1:17:12] weren't in laodicea
[1:17:14] he's going to give her the
[1:17:15] acknowledgement that he couldn't give in
[1:17:16] laodicea but now he's going to pour it
[1:17:19] upon her
[1:17:20] you are standing completely justified as
[1:17:23] though you never did it at the beginning
[1:17:25] this is my message to the church now as
[1:17:27] we go off the air just in a minute
[1:17:29] you are standing if you're standing on
[1:17:31] god's word and with god's word
[1:17:33] every amen every jot every tittle
[1:17:36] this is not to the laodicean church
[1:17:40] this is not the hybrid religion this is
[1:17:42] not the denomination
[1:17:44] this is only to the bride
[1:17:48] every amen every jot every tittle where
[1:17:51] are you standing
[1:17:51] i'm trying to tell you pull away from
[1:17:53] the shocks get out here in the wheat
[1:17:55] where you can get right before the sun
[1:17:57] i hear the coming of the combine you're
[1:17:59] standing complete
[1:18:01] justified like you never did it in the
[1:18:04] first place
[1:18:06] talk about a thanksgiving i feel real
[1:18:08] good i'm more thankful for that than
[1:18:10] anything i know of
[1:18:11] you see why he could not speak this to
[1:18:13] the laodicean church age
[1:18:16] he could only speak it to a separated
[1:18:18] bride
[1:18:19] he can't say that to the false vine but
[1:18:21] he can say that to his elect
[1:18:23] to his to to the portion of himself that
[1:18:26] is reserved to be expressed in this day

[1:18:30] place

[1:20:02] which is the bride age a bride day a
[1:20:05] bride time

[1:20:14] those who have come out and come into
[1:20:16] the bride
[1:20:17] and come into union with christ he can
[1:20:19] now say what he couldn't say there

[1:23:10] happening
[1:23:11] day by day why it's culminating so fast
[1:23:14] out there in those deserts and things
[1:23:15] taking place
[1:23:16] that i couldn't even keep up with it
[1:23:17] we're near the coming of jesus to be
[1:23:19] united
[1:23:20] with this church where the word becomes
[1:23:21] the word call of the holy spirit
[1:23:24] searching the hearts you're standing
[1:23:27] completely
[1:23:30] you're standing completely
[1:23:33] listen friends let all the
[1:23:36] denominational ideas of climbing up a
[1:23:38] ladder and failing and falling back to
[1:23:40] the bottom rung and
[1:23:41] all of that striving amen let it all
[1:23:44] fade away
[1:23:45] you've already been declared perfect
[1:23:49] you've already been you've already
[1:23:51] arrived you've already come
[1:23:52] to the place he wants you to come to
[1:23:54] amen we fail
[1:23:55] absolutely fail we've messed up but he's
[1:23:58] already declared us perfect
[1:23:59] why because he's given a perfect word to
[1:24:01] make a perfect bride
[1:24:02] and we become that perfect expression by
[1:24:04] a perfect faith and a perfect word
[1:24:06] and he's working out day by day it's
[1:24:08] working in our lives friends
[1:24:10] just let it work
[1:24:14] amen don't complicate it just let it
[1:24:16] work
[1:24:19] you're standing completely you never
[1:24:21] send it the first place
[1:24:22] god don't even know it's in the sea of
[1:24:24] forgetfulness you
[1:24:25] never did it i want to tell you right
[1:24:29] now that thing that plagues your mind
[1:24:30] that thing that troubles you that thing
[1:24:32] that the devil flashes in your face
[1:24:34] and causes a shiver to run down your
[1:24:35] spine whenever you remember that
[1:24:37] horrible sin
[1:24:38] you never did it oh
[1:24:41] come to terms with this how can we ever
[1:24:43] be what he's called us to be
[1:24:45] how can we ever stand and speak when he
[1:24:47] says speak and live the very life of
[1:24:48] jesus christ if we're constantly
[1:24:50] condemned all the time
[1:24:51] by things that happened in the past he
[1:24:53] said you never
[1:24:55] did it you never did it you never did it
[1:25:01] i never did it
[1:25:06] the body i lived in did a few things
[1:25:09] but there's been a price paid for that
[1:25:12] but the real genuine me the seed of god
[1:25:14] i've never done that
[1:25:16] only the body i lived in that was
[1:25:18] anointed by a hybrid spirit
[1:25:20] that was anointed by an evil spirit of
[1:25:21] the world it did some things and i
[1:25:23] remember some of those things because i
[1:25:24] still have that mind
[1:25:27] but there's another mind that's the mind
[1:25:29] of christ that's been awakened by an
[1:25:30] awakening of the sea gene on the inside
[1:25:32] and i'm remembering further back than
[1:25:35] that sin
[1:25:36] and the word of god is breaking my
[1:25:38] amnesia to take me back a few more steps
[1:25:41] than when i was a 17 year old boy when i
[1:25:43] was a 15 year old boy
[1:25:44] moving me back back before my natural
[1:25:47] birth
[1:25:48] all the way back to i was one with god
[1:25:50] and i never did it then
[1:25:53] and he's bringing me back to that
[1:25:54] position
[1:25:58] you never did it you were accused of it
[1:26:00] by the accuser but really from the
[1:26:02] beginning
[1:26:03] you were predestinated to be a son and
[1:26:05] daughter of god you're standing there
[1:26:07] washed and your old book of divorcement
[1:26:10] is put away and it's dead
[1:26:11] absolutely put out of existence even in
[1:26:13] the mind of god
[1:26:16] i tell your friends if we keep bringing
[1:26:18] old things from the past up and making
[1:26:20] them
[1:26:20] excuses for our failures today and the
[1:26:22] reasons we can't accomplish what god
[1:26:24] calls us to do
[1:26:25] you are bringing disgrace to the blood
[1:26:27] of jesus christ
[1:26:28] you're absolutely spitting in the face
[1:26:31] of god
[1:26:34] saying you're not powerful enough to
[1:26:36] forget it couldn't absolutely be washed
[1:26:38] away there's no way i could be
[1:26:39] completely forgiven
[1:26:40] it's got to still be an effect you i
[1:26:42] can't be what you call me to be i can't
[1:26:44] do because
[1:26:44] everybody knows my past they all know
[1:26:46] what i've done i'm telling you
[1:26:48] quit mocking god if he said you never
[1:26:51] did it you never did it
[1:26:52] if it's in the sea of his forgetfulness
[1:26:54] then forget about it
[1:26:58] do we suffer consequences in the flesh
[1:27:00] and absolutely will those consequences
[1:27:02] continue
[1:27:03] probably but we're not looking to the
[1:27:06] flesh this flesh is going to be changed
[1:27:08] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:27:10] i'm not worried about this flesh god's
[1:27:12] got a plan for this flesh but there's a
[1:27:14] life on the inside that'll take dominion
[1:27:16] over this flesh
[1:27:17] if i will let it but i have got to
[1:27:20] believe the word
[1:27:21] that if i am sinless if i am guiltless
[1:27:24] if i've been
[1:27:25] free if he actually took my place then
[1:27:28] how effective was the work of jesus
[1:27:30] christ on calvary
[1:27:34] if i make it partially effective i do
[1:27:37] disgrace to the word of god
[1:27:41] what's he done at the end of the age
[1:27:44] he's pulled off his bride
[1:27:45] and he's saying there's some things i
[1:27:47] couldn't say in a mixed audience there's
[1:27:48] some things i couldn't say to the
[1:27:50] laodicean church
[1:27:51] when the valspar was mixed in i didn't
[1:27:53] want the false mind to think this was
[1:27:54] about them
[1:27:57] because they're going to be judged out
[1:27:58] of the things that are written in the
[1:27:59] book according to their deeds but you'll
[1:28:01] never be judged according to your deeds
[1:28:06] you are judged according to your faith
[1:28:08] being able to believe the word and
[1:28:10] receive it for your day and you will not
[1:28:12] be judged according to your deeds the
[1:28:13] things that are written in the book
[1:28:15] like they will at the white throne judge
[1:28:18] i can't say this to laosea but i can say
[1:28:20] it to you
[1:28:21] now that i've thrust in my sickle and
[1:28:23] pulled you out
[1:28:28] friends really from the beginning you
[1:28:32] were predestinated to be a son or
[1:28:34] daughter of god you're standing there
[1:28:35] washed
[1:28:36] your old book of divorcement is put away
[1:28:38] and it's dead absolutely out
[1:28:39] of existence even in the mind of god
[1:28:43] you're the virtuous bride of christ
[1:28:45] washed in the blood of christ
[1:28:47] precious virtuous sinless son of god
[1:28:50] standing with a pure unadulterated bride
[1:28:53] word
[1:28:54] that he washed by the water of his own
[1:28:56] blood that became flesh and manifested
[1:28:59] that he might take you which were
[1:29:00] predestinated in the bosom of the father
[1:29:02] before the beginning
[1:29:04] the same as he was
[1:29:07] i'm going to read that again slowly why
[1:29:10] did he wash you
[1:29:12] so that he could take you he could not
[1:29:15] take you
[1:29:16] until you're washed that's why he could
[1:29:19] not come in an invisible union
[1:29:21] until the redemption was complete and he
[1:29:23] had finally washed all the falseness and
[1:29:25] washed all the pollution
[1:29:26] out of the church
[1:29:31] he washed you so that he could take you
[1:29:36] you which were predestinated in the
[1:29:38] bosom of the father before the beginning
[1:29:40] the same as he was
[1:29:44] your predestination is the same as his
[1:29:47] predestination
[1:29:51] i'll put it this way you are just as
[1:29:53] predestinated as jesus christ is
[1:29:55] predestinated
[1:29:59] predestinated is predestinated
[1:30:03] i don't know that he has degrees of
[1:30:05] predestination
[1:30:07] this is a predestination fifth degree
[1:30:08] this is a predestin
[1:30:12] you're predestinated in the bosom of the
[1:30:13] father the same as he was
[1:30:16] he was that great attribute of god
[1:30:17] called love whatever you
[1:30:19] are you are servants of god whatever god
[1:30:21] wants you to do
[1:30:22] where your place is god placed in the
[1:30:24] church some apostles prophets teachers
[1:30:26] pastors
[1:30:27] he placed that by virtue of his own
[1:30:28] predestination and you were
[1:30:30] you were that to begin with your first
[1:30:33] wedding was annulled it was you've never
[1:30:35] done it in the first place
[1:30:37] because there's only one thing could do
[1:30:38] it that would be the god come down
[1:30:40] himself and took your place in the form
[1:30:42] of the son of god
[1:30:43] christ jesus christ and washed you by
[1:30:46] the water
[1:30:47] of the washing of the water by the word
[1:30:49] the word not the denomination
[1:30:51] the word washed you but if you won't
[1:30:54] stand in the water of the word
[1:30:55] how you're going to get washed you're
[1:30:57] still as spotted as eve was
[1:31:00] that's why you couldn't say this to the
[1:31:01] laodicean church
[1:31:03] there was no pure water there to wash
[1:31:05] with it was a polluted corrupted water
[1:31:09] he had to restore the pure water of the
[1:31:12] word
[1:31:12] to wash the bride in
[1:31:17] what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in
[1:31:19] what
[1:31:20] the word unbelief in god which is the
[1:31:23] word
[1:31:25] pure unadulterated oh hallelujah
[1:31:28] leaving soon for the skies amen standing
[1:31:30] ready think your garments washed by the
[1:31:32] water of the bleeding word
[1:31:34] the word became blood the word bled for
[1:31:36] you and you are washed in bleeding word
[1:31:39] the word bleeding the life of god in the
[1:31:41] word and the word was bled for you that
[1:31:43] you might be
[1:31:44] washed from the filth of these
[1:31:45] prostitutes and be cleansed and
[1:31:47] sanctified by the washing
[1:31:49] of the water of the word and makes your
[1:31:52] mind and heart stayed on god
[1:31:54] and on his word
[1:31:58] i say the spirit of god through the
[1:32:00] seventh angel
[1:32:01] gave an acknowledgement
[1:32:06] and i want to i want to remind you that
[1:32:08] when the spirit spoke
[1:32:10] in revelation 3 to the 7th church age it
[1:32:13] had not
[1:32:14] one good thing to say
[1:32:18] but when the spirit spoke in the
[1:32:19] invisible union it didn't have
[1:32:21] one bad thing to say because there's
[1:32:24] been a complete separation of the two
[1:32:26] vines
[1:32:30] god sees you as he predestinated you
[1:32:35] god sees you as he willed you to be as
[1:32:38] he predestinated
[1:32:39] as he paid for you his plan is a
[1:32:42] finished plan before the foundation of
[1:32:44] the world and everything now is working
[1:32:45] into that plan
[1:32:46] even our mistakes he works together for
[1:32:49] his glory
[1:32:52] so let god be god and let what he said
[1:32:55] be true
[1:32:56] and say whatever happened to me in the
[1:32:57] past whatever i failed and all that does
[1:33:00] is put in me a character to love him
[1:33:01] more
[1:33:02] all that does is make me cling closer to
[1:33:04] his word it doesn't put me on the
[1:33:05] outside
[1:33:06] it doesn't make me unusable it doesn't
[1:33:08] make me a second-rate christian or
[1:33:09] believer of bride of jesus christ
[1:33:11] all it does is give me a greater love
[1:33:12] for his grace a greater understanding a
[1:33:14] greater revelation amen a greater
[1:33:17] experience
[1:33:19] even my current failure that i just fail
[1:33:22] at amen all it does is make me
[1:33:23] appreciate him more and want to stick
[1:33:25] with his word
[1:33:26] more and more i want to be closer to him
[1:33:29] more
[1:33:34] brother brethren said christ the man the
[1:33:36] message of christ is the mystery god
[1:33:38] revealed
[1:33:40] he said the new birth is christ is a
[1:33:43] revelation
[1:33:44] god has revealed to you this great
[1:33:45] mystery and that's a new birth
[1:33:48] now what are you going to do when you
[1:33:49] get all that group together where the
[1:33:51] revelation is perfectly in harmony
[1:33:53] and god expressing it through his word
[1:33:55] by the same actions the same things that
[1:33:57] he did
[1:33:57] making the word manifest oh if the
[1:34:00] church only knew its position
[1:34:03] it will one day then the rapture will go
[1:34:06] when it knows what it is
[1:34:10] you notice he didn't say the rapture
[1:34:11] will come because the rapture has
[1:34:13] already come
[1:34:16] the rapture's come the adoption has come
[1:34:19] the invisible unions come
[1:34:21] uniting with individuals awakening them
[1:34:24] to the
[1:34:25] to the taking away the spiritual needs
[1:34:27] and waking them to the reality
[1:34:29] from before
[1:34:33] but when this church oh if the church
[1:34:35] only knew
[1:34:37] its position
[1:34:40] take all the scare all the worry all the
[1:34:43] fear away
[1:34:44] if we knew its position it will one day
[1:34:49] then the rapture will go when it knows
[1:34:51] what it is
[1:34:53] god bless you saints let's all stand
[1:34:57] musicians if you could come
[1:35:01] i'll just remind you in the message to
[1:35:03] the laodicean church age
[1:35:05] he didn't have one good thing to say
[1:35:09] that means there was no bride there to
[1:35:12] address
[1:35:15] but after he separates his group out it
[1:35:18] brings out
[1:35:19] the sickles thrust in the harvest time
[1:35:21] comes he begins to separate the two
[1:35:24] vines when he gets the true vine off to
[1:35:26] himself
[1:35:28] he begins to say not
[1:35:31] you did good here but you need to
[1:35:33] improve here
[1:35:36] he doesn't say you got this right but
[1:35:38] but you're allowing this
[1:35:41] when he gets his bride off to himself he
[1:35:43] says you're the sinless
[1:35:44] spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ
[1:35:47] you never did it in the first place you
[1:35:49] were trapped into it you were born into
[1:35:51] it god already paid for that he's washed
[1:35:53] it away he's put it in the sea of his
[1:35:55] forgetfulness never to remember it no
[1:35:56] more but you're standing now completely
[1:35:59] you're standing now virtuous sinless
[1:36:01] spotless bride of jesus christ
[1:36:05] oh she only knew what she was amen she
[1:36:08] could only recognize her position
[1:36:10] she will she will and i believe she
[1:36:13] is i believe she's catching it by
[1:36:17] predestination by grace
[1:36:18] not by merit not by effort not by wisdom
[1:36:21] not by teaching
[1:36:23] but by grace amen by grace he brought a
[1:36:26] revelation
[1:36:27] that revelation awakened us from our
[1:36:29] stupor from the
[1:36:30] from the denominational mindset and the
[1:36:32] carnality in our mind and brought us
[1:36:33] back to a greater revelation a greater
[1:36:35] realization
[1:36:36] of who we were before we were on this
[1:36:38] earth who we were always meant to be
[1:36:40] before we made our first mistake
[1:36:43] so she can recognize her position what's
[1:36:45] her position bride of jesus christ
[1:36:47] united jesus christ sitted in heavenly
[1:36:49] places
[1:36:49] in christ jesus already she's been
[1:36:52] justified
[1:36:55] and whom he justified he hath
[1:36:58] glorified i'm not
[1:37:01] hoping to make a glorification someday
[1:37:03] i'm not hoping to get a glorified body
[1:37:06] amen it's a finished work in the mind of
[1:37:08] god because who he called he chose who
[1:37:10] he chose
[1:37:11] he justified who he justified he hath
[1:37:14] glorified
[1:37:15] it's finished friends i'm glorified in
[1:37:17] the mind of god
[1:37:18] i'm only here acting out my part in the
[1:37:20] great drama
[1:37:21] to manifest the headstone that's come
[1:37:24] down christ
[1:37:25] in the form of his bride
[1:37:29] pushing a mower
[1:37:33] hammering on a frame of a house
[1:37:38] dropping off the mail washing a baby
[1:37:44] do you realize don't make it
[1:37:48] don't make it super complicated
[1:37:52] make it every day
[1:37:57] make it you don't make it the super
[1:38:00] duper christian superhero you know
[1:38:02] that's what the bride looks like no the
[1:38:04] bride looks like a humble woman going to
[1:38:06] the grocery store
[1:38:07] to get all the groceries to feed her
[1:38:08] children that next week
[1:38:10] what's she doing she's in her position
[1:38:12] she's in her post of duty she's doing
[1:38:13] exactly what god called her to do
[1:38:15] and she's doing it according to the word
[1:38:18] not our own reasoning not our own mind i
[1:38:20] mean she's dressed like jesus christ
[1:38:22] with dress
[1:38:23] she's she's greeting other people like
[1:38:24] she would greet other people she's
[1:38:25] stopping and letting somebody else go
[1:38:29] there's not compromise on her body
[1:38:30] there's not compromise in her cart
[1:38:33] [Applause]
[1:38:36] don't make it complicated make it every
[1:38:38] day normal living
[1:38:40] jesus christ in the formation of his
[1:38:42] bride
[1:38:44] what about the supernatural that's
[1:38:46] supernatural
[1:38:48] but i believe if that bride stays in her
[1:38:50] position
[1:38:51] anything that stops you from fulfilling
[1:38:54] your purpose
[1:38:55] on this earth you can speak to that
[1:38:57] mountain and it has to move
[1:39:00] why because you're in your post of duty
[1:39:02] amen you're doing what god called you to
[1:39:04] do
[1:39:04] and any devil that stands against you
[1:39:06] and resists it you can push against that
[1:39:07] devil and it has to flee
[1:39:09] amen you can you can work every work
[1:39:11] that jesus christ work if you stay in
[1:39:13] your post of duty
[1:39:16] in any force any devil anything that
[1:39:18] would hinder you
[1:39:20] in your calling in your position amen
[1:39:22] that thing will have to move
[1:39:24] in the name of jesus christ and the
[1:39:26] supernatural will have to take place in
[1:39:27] your life
[1:39:32] don't put it in superheroes super
[1:39:36] believers
[1:39:37] a super future there's a super seat on
[1:39:41] earth right now
[1:39:44] and there's a super sign on earth right
[1:39:46] now
[1:39:47] what was the super sign a virgin shall
[1:39:49] conceive that was a super sign
[1:39:53] and god will come in the form of flesh
[1:39:55] that's a super sign
[1:39:56] i tell you there's a super sign on earth
[1:39:58] right now jesus christ is here
[1:40:00] he has returned and he's in the form of
[1:40:02] his bride a super sign upon a super
[1:40:06] seed
[1:40:09] don't throw it away don't make it
[1:40:12] unattainable
[1:40:13] amen there's as soon as you throw it to
[1:40:15] a super christian a super believer a
[1:40:17] super work
[1:40:18] then then you'll go to the grocery store
[1:40:20] with compromise on your body and
[1:40:21] compromise in your cart
[1:40:23] because you've put living for jesus
[1:40:25] christ and manifesting christ
[1:40:26] in some super-duper atmosphere somewhere
[1:40:30] but when you make it every morning when
[1:40:31] you wake up and the alarm goes off you
[1:40:33] say lord jesus help me today
[1:40:36] what is that that's jesus christ living
[1:40:39] in you
[1:40:40] lord take the preeminence in me today
[1:40:42] help me with my word help me
[1:40:47] that's the capstone everything that the
[1:40:50] church built up to
[1:40:51] capped off with love god himself
[1:40:55] jesus christ here he's united with his
[1:40:59] bride
[1:41:00] and now he's finishing the work he
[1:41:03] didn't finish in his earthly ministry
[1:41:05] he left a portion to do in and through
[1:41:07] the bride
[1:41:09] he's doing it now is there more to do
[1:41:11] probably
[1:41:14] may there be supernatural things there's
[1:41:16] been supernatural all alone
[1:41:20] i don't doubt one thing
[1:41:24] but i say god let me stay in my position
[1:41:28] and do what you called me to do and do
[1:41:30] it the way you would do it if you were
