[0:00] do not discount the pure simplicity
[0:03] of the receptiveness of the gospel of
[0:06] jesus christ
[0:07] indicating your your marriage to him
[0:10] indicating your relationship to him
[0:13] indicating that he
[0:14] did love you indicating that he has
[0:18] chosen you that is the
[0:21] very basis and way that he expresses his
[0:25] love to you
[0:26] see you if you want all the flowery
[0:29] fillings and
[0:30] cloud9 fillings and whatever else that's
[0:34] fine you know i want more of those
[0:37] but that is not what my relationship is
[0:39] based off of
[0:40] my relationship is based off the fact
[0:42] that i have
[0:44] a pure understanding
[0:47] a proper understanding as the prophet
[0:49] said that
[0:50] god himself has chosen me and he loves
[0:53] me
[0:55] even when i fail him every day he loves
[0:58] me and i know that he loves me is
[1:00] because he has came by my way
[1:02] and he has whispered his love secrets
[1:04] and he has expressed himself to me
[1:06] and there is no other reason that he
[1:08] would express himself to me if he did
[1:10] not love me
[1:14] it is that simple don't discount it
[1:18] don't get confused in your mind because
[1:20] when you get confused in your mind about
[1:22] whether he loves you or not
[1:23] you will automatically start operating
[1:25] in a in a realm of
[1:27] fear and then you fall back on your plan
[1:31] and your works program let me know how
[1:34] that works out for you
[1:35] it'll bring more anxiety more depression
[1:39] more xanax that's what that would lead
[1:42] to
[1:43] but if you can simply come before him
[1:46] with a clear conscience and a clear
[1:49] acceptance
[1:50] acceptance that he loves
[1:54] me because he has told me he loves me
[1:58] you say well i've never heard an audible
[1:59] voice that he came down and says i love
[2:01] you
[2:02] listen to a tape
[2:05] [Music]
[2:06] you want an audible voice there's your
[2:08] audible voice listen to a tape
[2:12] and when he comes and he says good
[2:13] evening friends and something of you
[2:15] goes
[2:18] tell me more that's him telling you
[2:22] that he loves you because it's
[2:24] impossible
[2:25] for you to have that reaction unless he
[2:28] first loved you and chose you
[2:30] it's impossible many people may try to
[2:34] fake it many people may get the
[2:35] intellectual conception of it but i'm
[2:37] talking about a true marriage
[2:39] i'm talking about a true love for that
[2:40] word that when it cuts
[2:42] when it comes and it cuts and it slices
[2:45] and it dices
[2:46] and it strips you down raw
[2:49] you'll still come back to it and say
[2:52] give me more
[2:53] tell me more
