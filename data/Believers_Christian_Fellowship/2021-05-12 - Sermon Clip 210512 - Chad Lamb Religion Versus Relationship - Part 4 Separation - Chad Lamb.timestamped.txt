[0:00] even lot and his carnality went down to
[0:03] the well-watered jordan because it was
[0:05] fertile it was fruitful he could be have
[0:08] progress
[0:08] and he could prosper there and even he
[0:10] moved down there which would force
[0:12] abraham to go the other way and where
[0:14] did god get abraham he got him smack
[0:17] dab in the middle of the promised land
[0:21] and he got him in the middle of the
[0:22] promised land which was not the better
[0:24] piece of land like the plains of jordan
[0:26] but it was the exact predestinated spot
[0:29] where he needed to be
[0:30] when he finally come into full
[0:32] separation he's standing in the middle
[0:34] of the land
[0:35] he said now lift up your eyes look
[0:37] northward look
[0:38] southward look to the east and look to
[0:40] the west why he's standing
[0:42] in the middle of the promised land
[0:44] because god is perfect and god is
[0:46] jealous and god always wanted to get
[0:48] abraham by himself
[0:50] to this place so that he could give him
[0:52] the promise
[0:54] and all the wonderings and movings and
[0:56] shiftings and right and wrong
[0:58] and in and out and all of it is because
[1:00] god
[1:01] has got to get abraham his elect
[1:03] predestinated seed
[1:04] in his program to his spot amen so that
[1:08] he can reveal to him
[1:09] all this word is yours
[1:13] from genesis to revelation in the old
[1:15] testament the new testament
[1:17] [Applause]
[1:18] it's all yours amen i've separated you
[1:21] from denominations
[1:23] you've had so much strife and trouble
[1:25] and so many things that have happened in
[1:26] your life but i'm trying to break the
[1:28] babylonian system i'm trying
[1:30] amen i'm trying to break it down where
[1:33] they don't understand your language
[1:34] anymore you don't understand your
[1:35] language anymore you're not even
[1:37] speaking the same thing anymore
[1:40] and even the ones that would come out
[1:42] with you originally
[1:45] god would allow them to fade off the
[1:47] scene or it would bring a contention
[1:49] where they would have to go one way and
[1:51] you would have to go the other way amen
[1:55] because god is bringing separation
[1:58] because separation is bringing
[2:00] relationship
[2:03] why the separation listen
[2:06] it's not separation because this one's
[2:08] bad and this one's good and blah blah
[2:10] it has nothing to do with it the
[2:12] separation is all about god being a
[2:14] jealous god and he wants a relationship
[2:16] with just you
[2:17] and he's so jealous he doesn't want you
[2:19] comforted by
[2:20] this one or that one or this church or
[2:24] that system or this
[2:26] if any of those comforts are coming
[2:28] between his
[2:30] jealous love for you and if it's
[2:32] dividing your focus if it's
[2:33] if it's causing you of affection
[2:35] somewhere else or comfort or our
[2:37] confidence and something else
[2:38] god will see to it that that thing gets
[2:40] broke somehow and separated off
[2:42] because he's a jealous god with a
[2:44] jealous love and he wants you
[2:46] and just you
[2:49] and somehow through it all he'll bring
[2:52] you right
[2:53] back to the middle of the promised land
[2:59] and when you get all by yourself and
[3:02] wondering how did i get to this place in
[3:04] my life
[3:07] you say now lift up thine eyes
[3:11] and look from genesis to revelation
[3:15] from before the foundation of the world
[3:17] to the new heavens and new earth
[3:18] it's all yours i've given it all to you
