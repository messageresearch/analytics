[7:09] hallelujah praise the lord he's worthy
[7:13] of our praise amen god bless you while
[7:16] we're standing let's open our bible to
[7:17] galatians chapter 3.
[7:21] we'll begin there i pray the lord will
[7:24] have his way
[7:26] amen it's certainly good to be together
[7:29] the deacons did some fast counting
[7:31] and they come back and told me that all
[7:33] the brothers have been confirmed so we
[7:35] thank god for that
[7:36] and god bless you for taking the time to
[7:39] do that to confirm that
[7:40] i also want to say i appreciate and
[7:43] thank god
[7:44] that we have brothers who can take a
[7:46] position that live a clean life and
[7:48] serve god
[7:50] you know there's there's churches that
[7:52] have trouble finding brothers to fill
[7:54] offices but
[7:55] by the grace of god to see that there's
[7:57] so many brothers and
[7:58] so many more than just the brothers that
[8:00] are holding an office brothers
[8:02] who live a godly life lead their
[8:04] families take their place in the body
[8:06] it's encouraging friends it's
[8:08] encouraging if you
[8:09] look across the landscape of america in
[8:12] general and even europe
[8:13] uh not i'm not talking this message
[8:15] church i'm just talking in general
[8:17] the men are gone they've left churches
[8:20] they're gone
[8:21] amen and that's never the way it was
[8:22] supposed to be the men were supposed to
[8:24] lead in worship
[8:25] supposed to lead their homes amen but i
[8:27] thank god that there's a word that is
[8:29] calling men forth amen
[8:31] i appreciate that it's a bold word it's
[8:33] a challenging word
[8:35] and it's challenging to the men of the
[8:36] age but god has
[8:38] got men of the age who will rise to the
[8:40] challenge so we thank god for that
[8:43] let's read galatians chapter 3
[8:46] and verse 16.
[8:52] now to abraham and his seed where the
[8:53] promise is made
[8:55] he saith not unto seeds as of many
[8:58] but as of one and to thy seed which is
[9:01] christ
[9:02] that's a big verse we're going to pray
[9:06] and then we'll ask god to open it to us
[9:08] dear lord jesus we thank you for this
[9:10] word lord it means so much to us
[9:13] the hour that we live in lord it's the
[9:14] only firm foundation that we have
[9:16] lord is your word and your spirit here
[9:19] to make it live
[9:20] and lord we just ask now that you would
[9:22] minister your word
[9:23] we've come to feed from your hand lord
[9:25] and we pray that you would just deliver
[9:27] your word unto us
[9:28] speak to us lord and the truth lord take
[9:31] preeminence among us and drop it into
[9:33] our heart
[9:33] and let every word bring forth life and
[9:36] great manifestation and an abundance
[9:38] let this word bring forth a tremendous
[9:40] harvest in this hour
[9:42] we ask it lord for your glory in jesus
[9:44] christ's name we pray
[9:46] amen you can be seated i just want to
[9:49] read this
[9:49] again before we go to our next scripture
[9:52] now to abraham and his seed where the
[9:54] promise is made
[9:55] so there's a promise to abraham and his
[9:57] seed which brother banham comes and
[9:59] tells us is the faith seed of abraham or
[10:01] the royal seed
[10:02] not the natural seed because abraham was
[10:04] told to look at the sands of the
[10:06] sands of the by the side of the sea and
[10:08] try to count them for so shall the
[10:10] number of a seed be but
[10:11] then he was told to look at the stars of
[10:13] heaven showing that there's going to be
[10:14] a natural seed but there's also going to
[10:16] be a royal seed or a heavenly seed
[10:18] or a faith seed amen and how many of you
[10:21] can say you're part of the faith seed of
[10:23] abraham
[10:24] well praise god because it the promise
[10:26] was given to abraham and his seed
[10:28] where the promise is made that makes you
[10:31] part of the promise the
[10:33] the covenant to abraham that thy seed
[10:36] shall possess the gates of your enemy
[10:37] that means you shall possess the gates
[10:39] of your enemy so the question is what is
[10:41] your enemy right now
[10:42] the promise is you'll possess the gates
[10:44] of that enemy
[10:46] whatever trouble whatever enemies come
[10:48] against you whatever demon power is
[10:50] trying to afflict your body
[10:52] afflict your family afflict whatever
[10:54] amen the promise is you
[10:56] you shall overtake the enemy the enemy
[10:59] shall not overtake you you shall possess
[11:01] the gates of your enemy
[11:03] and if this is the promise to the
[11:05] abraham and to his seed where the
[11:06] promise is made
[11:07] he saith not and deceits as of many
[11:12] ceases of many but as of one into thy
[11:15] seed
[11:15] which is christ so brother of them tells
[11:17] us it's a royal seed
[11:19] it's the faith seed and we believe we're
[11:21] part of that seed
[11:22] so that means that seed is christ and if
[11:25] you're part of that seed
[11:27] you're part of christ it's one lineage
[11:30] through the bible
[11:31] it's not different families with
[11:32] different family names it doesn't matter
[11:34] what last name is on your birth
[11:36] certificate
[11:37] amen when god amen projected out his
[11:40] word
[11:40] amen that word coming into manifestation
[11:42] is christ
[11:44] in whatever age in whatever form it
[11:46] comes into manifestation
[11:48] it's christ and that's the seed amen
[11:51] it's the seed of the word coming into
[11:53] manifestation in this day so we can see
[11:56] that we're part of that seed
[11:58] which is christ now let's go back to
[12:01] genesis chapter one
[12:07] i have a lot that i want to go through
[12:09] today by the grace of god if you'll just
[12:11] help us
[12:12] amen a lot of quotes i'd like to read so
[12:14] you bear with me and
[12:15] you pull on the quotes too amen amen
[12:18] because they're good
[12:19] and i've got a lot to read maybe we may
[12:21] not i don't know but we'll just see how
[12:22] the lord leads but there's a lot of
[12:24] things in my heart that i'd like to
[12:26] share in this hour
[12:27] genesis 1 and verse 1
[12:31] in the beginning god created the heaven
[12:33] and the earth
[12:34] and the earth was without form and void
[12:37] and darkness
[12:38] was upon the face of the deep and the
[12:40] spirit of god moved upon the face of the
[12:42] waters
[12:43] and god said let there be light and
[12:45] there was light
[12:46] so we know in this condition the message
[12:48] tells us brother van tells us
[12:50] that earth is in a in a judged condition
[12:53] it's under judgment
[12:54] amen there was a previous civilization
[12:57] there was something that happened before
[12:59] amen in between genesis 1 1 and genesis
[13:02] 1
[13:02] 2 the earth has been destroyed and under
[13:04] the judgment of god
[13:06] amen and now under the judgment of god
[13:09] there's there's
[13:10] the earth is without form and void and
[13:12] darkness is upon the face of the deep
[13:15] so it's shrouded in darkness and and no
[13:17] one's able to tell
[13:18] what form the earth is in it's in
[13:20] darkness it's hidden
[13:22] it's in a mystery form all right
[13:25] and the mystery is in the darkness the
[13:27] darkness is hiding the form
[13:29] amen in a mystery but god is going to
[13:32] begin to break the mystery
[13:34] and as he breaks the mystery he's going
[13:36] to bring up
[13:37] the form of the earth or or or the or
[13:40] the create recreation of the earth amen
[13:42] in this new form but to do that he says
[13:45] in the spirit of god
[13:47] moved upon the face of the waters and i
[13:49] want to talk about the move of the
[13:51] spirit
[13:52] amen because it's the first time that we
[13:54] find this terminology used in the bible
[13:56] right out of the gate and if we want to
[13:58] understand something a concept in god
[14:01] we need to find what god means by this
[14:03] term
[14:04] not what man has taken it to mean not
[14:06] what the pentecostal denomination has
[14:08] taken it to mean but when we say move
[14:10] the spirit what does god mean when he
[14:11] says move the spirit
[14:13] and what is the move of the spirit
[14:14] supposed to accomplish
[14:15] [Applause]
[14:17] and right here we find out that in
[14:19] judgment and in darkness with no
[14:21] form and the earth in a mystery amen
[14:23] something's got to come
[14:25] and begin to brood over the earth to
[14:26] break the mystery and bring the life
[14:28] that's there
[14:29] from a previous civilization there's
[14:31] something there that has to come forth
[14:33] so the moving of the spirit is going to
[14:35] begin to take the word of god
[14:37] and begin to move it into place to bring
[14:40] back what was in god's mind from before
[14:42] the foundation of the world
[14:44] he says in the rising of the sun now the
[14:47] sun at the rising of the sun
[14:48] well there was a time when the world was
[14:50] laying in utter darkness
[14:52] it was without form and was void and it
[14:54] was all covered with water
[14:55] and was laying there in the dark dismal
[14:58] gloomy atmosphere
[14:59] and the spirit of god moved upon that
[15:01] water and said let there be light
[15:03] god had a reason to do that for down
[15:06] beneath that water there was seeds that
[15:08] he had planted
[15:10] and it had to have that sunlight to make
[15:12] it live
[15:14] he says in god's power to transform and
[15:16] i think this morning in genesis 1
[15:18] this world was without form and it was
[15:21] void and darkness was upon the earth
[15:23] nothing but a complete chaos and when
[15:25] this world was in that condition the
[15:27] spirit of god moved upon the face of the
[15:29] water
[15:29] and the entire picture was changed
[15:33] think about that what is it it's the
[15:35] move of the spirit it changed the entire
[15:37] picture the entire picture was changed
[15:40] from a total chaos
[15:42] to a garden of eden that is transforming
[15:46] power of god
[15:46] that can take something that's nothing
[15:48] and make something wonderful out of it
[15:50] god's transforming power in the message
[15:54] conference
[15:55] he says and see when god made
[15:58] man he began to brood over the earth and
[16:01] upcoming little easter flowers up come
[16:03] grass
[16:03] up come species rising higher and higher
[16:06] the great holy spirit brooding
[16:08] or brooding means to be mothering cooing
[16:10] coo
[16:11] coo the flowers come up the father said
[16:14] that's wonderful
[16:15] listen this is the move of the spirit
[16:18] the spirit moved upon the face of the
[16:20] waters what's it doing
[16:22] amen the word of god is coming and the
[16:24] spirit is there to bring the word of god
[16:26] into manifestation so the spirit of god
[16:29] begins to coo
[16:30] over the earth and bring to pass
[16:32] everything god's saying
[16:33] and cooing like a mother cooing bringing
[16:36] up first little flowers and then
[16:37] bringing up this and then bringing up
[16:39] that
[16:41] praise be to god the flowers come up the
[16:44] father said that's wonderful
[16:45] just keep it up and he brooded and after
[16:48] wow out come
[16:48] birds and the next thing outcome animals
[16:51] he kept getting greater
[16:52] greater greater and finally the earth
[16:55] reflecting the reflection of him
[16:57] that was brooding it was brooding god
[17:00] and he was in the image of god so the
[17:03] brooding
[17:04] what was the brooding to take place the
[17:06] the there was a
[17:07] judgment upon the earth but down in
[17:10] there was seeds that god had planted
[17:12] and he wanted to bring forth what was in
[17:14] his mind
[17:15] amen he wanted to break the mystery of
[17:17] the darkness and
[17:18] unfold amen through six days through the
[17:21] breaking of the seals he wanted to
[17:23] unfold the mystery that was in his mind
[17:25] and to do that he sent the agent of the
[17:27] holy ghost down
[17:28] to coo like a mother amen and god would
[17:30] speak and the holy ghost would crew
[17:32] and up would come flowers and up would
[17:34] come mountains and up would come this
[17:36] and everything would get into place to
[17:38] display what was it doing it was
[17:40] breeding from
[17:41] judgment to a garden of eden because
[17:44] that's what god wanted
[17:45] and that's what the move of the spirit
[17:47] did is he took that word of god
[17:49] amen in a judgment condition and began
[17:52] to place the word and
[17:53] coo over creation and bring it in line
[17:55] with the word
[17:56] until it moved from chaos to eden
[18:00] and we've been born in this world under
[18:02] chaos under judgments because of the
[18:04] wrong birth
[18:05] because of what took place in the garden
[18:07] of eden but the spirit of god has moved
[18:09] on our lives
[18:10] and moved through generation after
[18:12] generation and moved through seven
[18:14] church ages
[18:15] what was it trying to do bring up
[18:16] another part of the creation
[18:18] another part of the creation another
[18:20] part of the word
[18:21] amen and building it higher and higher
[18:24] until it began to look
[18:25] more like what was brooding over it
[18:28] through seven church days until you get
[18:30] to the top and come to the capstone
[18:32] until
[18:33] finally it reflects the thing that's
[18:35] been brooding over for seven church ages
[18:38] breaking the mysteries breaking the
[18:40] mysteries why because it was shrouded in
[18:42] darkness
[18:45] to bring it back to reflect
[18:48] something that was in his image
[18:51] see that's what the moving of the spirit
[18:53] was to do
[18:55] to bring it from chaos to eden
[19:01] let's go to genesis chapter 1
[19:05] verse 26.
[19:08] now i want to read the last part
[19:12] the last part of that quote from
[19:14] conference
[19:16] and then finally the earth reflected the
[19:17] reflection of him
[19:19] that was brooding god and he was in the
[19:22] image of god finally something in the
[19:25] earth
[19:26] what what was coming up things from the
[19:29] earth
[19:31] flowers trees was coming up
[19:35] coming up and he was making it in a
[19:37] higher form
[19:38] and a higher form and a higher form
[19:42] all the well till finally the part of
[19:43] the earth that came up because adam was
[19:45] made out of the earth
[19:47] he was eventually put in the flesh body
[19:49] and finally what came out of the earth
[19:51] was something that reflected him
[19:54] it says in genesis 1 26
[19:58] and god said let us make man in our
[20:00] image after our likeness
[20:02] and let them have dominion over the fish
[20:04] of the sea and over the foul of the air
[20:05] and over the cattle and over all the
[20:07] earth
[20:07] and over every creeping thing that
[20:09] creepeth upon the earth and so god
[20:11] created man in his own image
[20:13] and the image of god created he him male
[20:16] and female created he them
[20:18] so when he brought something up that was
[20:20] in his own image first it was a
[20:21] spirit man and then the spirit man was
[20:24] male and female
[20:26] and then he took the spirit man and he
[20:28] brought up part of the earth and he
[20:29] put the spirit man in the in the earth
[20:32] but adam and a body of flesh so that he
[20:34] could interact with creation
[20:35] and in him was still male and female why
[20:38] what he was doing he was bringing up
[20:39] something that was in the reflection of
[20:41] god
[20:42] and so now we have to understand to
[20:44] properly
[20:45] understand the reflection of god you had
[20:48] to realize
[20:49] that in this reflection was male and
[20:51] female
[20:53] and it was a proper reflection of god
[20:55] amen because
[20:56] god has attributes of male and female
[20:59] and if we don't understand god and the
[21:01] attributes of male and female or the
[21:03] expression of
[21:04] male and female then we're going to miss
[21:06] amen what god's trying to get us to
[21:08] understand in this day
[21:10] we only see god as as over there amen
[21:13] the god
[21:14] the male part but if we miss that
[21:15] there's a female expression
[21:17] and a female part a man that's been in
[21:19] god all along
[21:20] amen that god wants to express just as
[21:23] much through the male part as he does
[21:24] through the female part
[21:26] if we miss that we've missed the message
[21:28] in our day
[21:31] and the holy ghost was brooding the move
[21:33] of the spirit the spirit began to move
[21:35] amen
[21:36] and bring it all to pass till it finally
[21:38] come up and reflected something
[21:40] that was cooing it that was brooding
[21:42] over it and we know now that man was
[21:45] created in his image and the image of
[21:46] god created to him male and female
[21:48] created he
[21:50] them brother man says and the seed shall
[21:53] not be heir with the shock
[21:56] he was god the logos the word that went
[21:58] out of god
[21:59] when he began to brood upon the earth
[22:01] and brought forth marine life
[22:03] then the spirit of god the logos the
[22:04] word which god said
[22:06] let there be and there went the logos
[22:08] which is the word
[22:09] and the word began because all this was
[22:11] in the logos the whole word of god the
[22:13] whole bible
[22:14] for every age and as the logos begin to
[22:17] breathe upon the earth there came marine
[22:19] life
[22:20] and building up and bird life and on up
[22:22] the animal life and finally
[22:24] there comes something in representation
[22:26] or looked like the thing that was
[22:28] brooding over it god a man in the very
[22:31] image of god male and female
[22:36] the man fell like the seed has to fall
[22:40] and then god began to brood over that
[22:42] after the fall
[22:43] he brought up an enoch he brought up an
[22:45] elijah he brought up a
[22:47] do you understand amen this is the move
[22:50] of the spirit through the old testament
[22:51] what is the spirit doing he's bringing
[22:53] up an enoch
[22:54] he's bringing up an elijah amen he's
[22:57] bringing up
[22:58] what's he bringing up he's bringing up
[22:59] moses he brought up prophet after
[23:01] prophet trying to restore that
[23:03] image again and finally upon the earth
[23:06] came the genuine
[23:07] image of god himself again which was god
[23:10] the logos made flesh and dwelt among us
[23:14] and in him was male and female
[23:19] now that same logos has a part he has
[23:22] got a bride
[23:23] and the same logos this word that cannot
[23:26] be tampered with
[23:27] is brooding over the churches today
[23:29] trying to bring
[23:31] back the word to its full manifestation
[23:34] what's it trying to do it's trying the
[23:36] spirit of god is trying to do what it
[23:38] did originally
[23:39] back in genesis one it has been doing
[23:41] through the whole bible
[23:42] amen until finally it brought up from
[23:44] the fall through the old testament till
[23:46] it finally got back a man
[23:48] that was reflecting god perfectly and
[23:51] jesus christ was the perfect reflection
[23:53] of god
[23:53] and in him was male and female amen but
[23:56] to complete the work he's got to pull
[23:58] out the female part amen and finish that
[24:01] construction
[24:02] and unite the two back together and what
[24:04] the prophet said was the crowning act of
[24:06] all creation
[24:08] what's the spirit of god been doing down
[24:10] through the bible as the pillar of fire
[24:12] has been moving through the bible
[24:13] we see it show up here and show up there
[24:15] and show up there what's it been trying
[24:17] to do
[24:17] it's been trying to complete the
[24:19] masterpiece
[24:20] the masterpiece that was in god's mind
[24:22] from before the foundation of the world
[24:24] the masterpiece family
[24:28] not just one image but the two being one
[24:32] is the masterpiece he says in god's
[24:35] power to transform now
[24:36] when the world lay in that kind of fix
[24:39] god's spirit moved again
[24:41] upon a seed that was predestinated he
[24:44] translated and transformed isaiah
[24:46] 9 6 of its promise he god
[24:49] was made in human flesh to save that
[24:51] chaos time
[24:53] when man was made in the image of god
[24:55] here come god
[24:56] by the prophet for seeing it the same
[24:59] prophet isaiah 9 6 said unto us a child
[25:02] is born
[25:02] to us a son is given and his name shall
[25:05] be called counselor the prince of peace
[25:06] the mighty god
[25:07] the everlasting father and of his reign
[25:10] there will be no end and that word is
[25:12] god's word and the spirit moved upon
[25:15] that word
[25:16] and it formed in the womb of a virgin a
[25:19] man
[25:19] a son is born so as we follow down
[25:22] through
[25:23] we pick up this this movement of the
[25:25] spirit but now
[25:27] the spirit was going to take what was
[25:28] laying in a prophecy of isaiah 9
[25:31] 6 and it was going to bring it into
[25:33] manifestation
[25:34] in the in the womb of a virgin and this
[25:37] was god
[25:38] moving his spirit moving the move of god
[25:41] is not about a fleshly sensation
[25:43] but the move of god is about god moving
[25:45] his word into manifestation
[25:47] when god's spirit moves he's moving upon
[25:50] the word
[25:50] to move the word into a manifestation
[25:53] for the hour
[25:54] and every time in the bible and the way
[25:56] brother branham explains it that move
[25:58] was not to make people excited
[25:59] that move was to further his kingdom
[26:01] work
[26:02] and in furthering his kingdom work
[26:04] sometimes the people got excited
[26:06] that was wonderful amen it should be
[26:08] exciting to see the kingdom
[26:10] move and to know the spirit of god's
[26:11] moving that should be a thrill to your
[26:13] soul
[26:13] but the purpose was not to be a thrill
[26:15] to the individual but the purpose was to
[26:18] move god's plan into manifestation
[26:20] and if the move of the spirit does
[26:22] something other than that it wasn't a
[26:24] genuine move of the spirit
[26:26] because it didn't come to excite the
[26:28] flesh it came to move the word of god
[26:30] into place
[26:32] and if that's exciting then that's the
[26:34] side effect or
[26:36] side benefit and we like the side effect
[26:38] and we enjoy the side benefit
[26:41] but the main purpose was to move god's
[26:43] move god's program forward
[26:50] hallelujah
[26:53] let's go to matthew chapter 4.
[27:13] matthew chapter 4 verse 1 then was jesus
[27:17] led up of the spirit
[27:19] unto the wilderness to be tempted of the
[27:20] devil
[27:22] now here the spirit is moving him again
[27:25] but he's moving him to the wilderness to
[27:27] be tempted of the devil
[27:29] now this was not one of those real
[27:32] exciting times
[27:34] i mean i'm sure it was exciting but it
[27:35] wasn't it wasn't one of those
[27:37] stimulating times that felt so nice amen
[27:40] amen
[27:40] it wasn't the one that that that gave
[27:43] him tingly sensations but it was the
[27:45] spirit of god
[27:46] moving this word and manifestation into
[27:48] a further manifestation
[27:49] because it had to be tested it had to
[27:51] fulfill all the word
[27:53] it had to be able to endure the test so
[27:55] the spirit of god
[27:56] moved on him and moved him into the
[27:58] wilderness to be
[27:59] tempted of the devil because the lamb
[28:02] had to be tested
[28:03] had to be tried because there couldn't
[28:05] be one spot one blemish
[28:07] he had to stand the test that that he
[28:10] fell by
[28:10] he had to pass the lust of the eyes the
[28:14] lust of the flesh
[28:14] and the pride of life so the spirit of
[28:16] god moved him into a position
[28:18] to what to prove the word
[28:22] sometimes the move of the spirit amen
[28:24] from us does not feel good
[28:26] but the move of the spirit is god moving
[28:28] us into a position
[28:29] to prove his word to vindicate that this
[28:32] is my child
[28:33] this is the word and they can endure the
[28:35] testing
[28:37] so not every time the spirit moves upon
[28:39] us
[28:40] and moves us into position not every
[28:42] time is it a thrill not every time is it
[28:44] is it exciting well not every time does
[28:46] it feel like a blessing amen sometimes
[28:49] it's frightening sometimes it's
[28:51] troublesome sometimes
[28:53] it agony it's agony in the flesh but
[28:55] it's still
[28:56] god moving his word along
[29:02] sometimes we won't understand that this
[29:04] is god
[29:05] and if we think god only moves in a way
[29:08] to to bring a blessing or to thrill us
[29:12] or make things exciting sometimes the
[29:14] spirit of god is moving
[29:15] moving us into a trial moving us into
[29:18] temptation
[29:19] to prove the word a testing time
[29:23] and we'll call it the work of the devil
[29:26] when it's a move of the spirits
[29:31] we've got to be mature believers in this
[29:33] hour not immature
[29:35] and be fighting the air but realize that
[29:37] god's in control
[29:38] there's something he wants to do in this
[29:40] hour friends and listen
[29:42] when it was time for that to that baby
[29:44] to be born
[29:45] amen it had jesus had to come forth in
[29:48] bethlehem because of the prophecy
[29:50] and god changed the entire system of the
[29:53] world amen and did something that hadn't
[29:55] been done before
[29:56] amen and created chaos and confusion
[30:00] and absolutely wrecked people's personal
[30:02] lives
[30:03] so that he could get mary and joseph in
[30:05] bethlehem for the word to be fulfilled
[30:09] god will wreck kingdoms to move forward
[30:11] his word
[30:12] and it's a move of the spirit god will
[30:14] wreck individual lives
[30:16] god will break things to pieces and
[30:18] shatter our own dreams and our own ideas
[30:21] and it'll be the move of the spirit
[30:23] getting his word into position
[30:25] to move according to the prophecy you
[30:28] realize
[30:29] mary and joseph would have never taken
[30:31] that journey that when they took that
[30:33] journey
[30:33] at that time on their own god had to
[30:36] change the whole world
[30:37] structure to get the word in position
[30:40] and who was it that
[30:41] moved caesar who was it that moved
[30:45] caesar
[30:46] i don't care what evil spirit god sent
[30:49] forth to do it or allowed to do it
[30:50] it was god amen it was god because god
[30:54] had to bring his word to pass amen in
[30:56] the spirit of god
[30:57] moved to situations so it would match
[30:59] the scriptures praise be to god
[31:05] that may not have you rolling on the
[31:07] floor but at the end of this journey
[31:08] it'll have you saying thank you lord
[31:10] thank you god that there was a power
[31:12] moving me thank you god there was
[31:14] something beyond my intellect
[31:16] something beyond my emotions something
[31:18] beyond my feelings
[31:19] that you had a power greater than my
[31:21] human effort that would move me into
[31:23] position
[31:24] god because there's word to be manifest
[31:26] there's word to be fulfilled and it's
[31:28] going to take the anointing of god to
[31:30] bring it to pass
[31:34] so god knows how to move
[31:38] over the chaos
[31:43] bethlehem was in chaos the day mary and
[31:46] joseph showed up
[31:48] no room in the inn people traveling i'm
[31:51] sure there was a lot of
[31:52] uprising anger confusion
[31:56] fear and what was it
[31:59] god just bringing his word to pass
[32:03] in the midst of chaos what was it god
[32:06] bringing his word to pass
[32:08] what do you think this chaos is all
[32:09] about god bringing
[32:11] his word to pass
[32:14] don't fear when everything goes topsy
[32:17] turning don't be afraid
[32:18] god has not he's not fallen off the
[32:21] throne he's not bumped his head and
[32:22] forgot where his seed is
[32:24] he hasn't forgot what his plan is
[32:25] everything's working according to his
[32:27] plan
[32:29] god's moving his god's moving amen his
[32:32] plan into place he's moving his seat
[32:34] into place
[32:35] to bring he's imparting the waters he's
[32:37] getting everything out of the way
[32:39] he's moving he's moving things around to
[32:41] bring
[32:42] forth amen something that will perfectly
[32:45] reflect his image
[32:48] amen that's what he does so he's done
[32:50] through the church ages that's what he
[32:51] does in our personal lives
[32:54] personally for you to get in the seat
[32:56] you're in now
[32:57] believing what you believe as a child of
[33:00] god
[33:00] god had to bring you through all kinds
[33:02] of circumstances
[33:04] and they weren't all wonderful amen you
[33:06] weren't jumping up and down shouting
[33:07] hallelujah every time the spirit of god
[33:10] moved you sometimes he moved you by
[33:12] losing a job
[33:13] sometimes he moved you amen by rejection
[33:16] of people you love
[33:17] and things that were confusing and
[33:18] difficult but what was it it was the
[33:20] spirit of god
[33:21] moving the chaos moving circumstances
[33:24] around
[33:24] brooding over us because he's trying to
[33:26] take us from the judgment we were born
[33:28] in in chaos
[33:30] and part the waters strike the light the
[33:32] the seed with the light
[33:34] bring it up and cool over it to bring it
[33:36] into full manifestation
[33:38] of the thought he had before the
[33:40] foundation of the world
[33:42] and it's not always been comfortable
[33:44] when the spirit of god moved upon you
[33:46] and it wasn't always a thrill to the
[33:48] soul and it didn't always make you
[33:51] shout and jump up and down sometimes it
[33:53] made you weep
[33:55] sometimes it broke you sometimes it
[33:57] brought you to your knees in
[33:58] agonizing prayer all night long but what
[34:01] was it it was
[34:01] god moving his word forward
[34:04] it was the holy ghost cooing over the
[34:07] seed in you
[34:08] bringing it into further manifestation
[34:13] if we only call the good things god
[34:20] we're going to miss what he's doing in
[34:21] our lives
[34:23] god used terrible circumstances to move
[34:26] forward his word
[34:29] he always has
[34:32] listen god's power to transform but one
[34:35] day the smear
[34:37] the spirit moved upon him again
[34:40] oh listen to this quote friends
[34:44] the spirit moved upon who jesus christ
[34:48] then he probably started running around
[34:49] the room
[34:51] because when the spirit moves you run
[34:53] around the room
[34:56] you can it may happen
[35:01] one day the spirit moved upon him again
[35:03] because there was some word
[35:05] had been written about him come from god
[35:08] through the prophet
[35:09] and he was led to slaughter like a lamb
[35:14] and the spirit moved upon him and led
[35:16] him
[35:17] and sent him to calvary's cross
[35:23] god would do that yes the move of the
[35:26] spirit would do that
[35:27] absolutely and remember when the spirit
[35:29] of god
[35:30] moved upon him this was a move of the
[35:32] spirit
[35:33] moved upon him because there was word
[35:35] that he had to fulfill
[35:37] and part of that word that he had to
[35:38] fulfill was he was a lamb led to the
[35:40] slaughter
[35:41] and so when the spirit of god began to
[35:43] move upon him
[35:44] amen he went into gethsemane and began
[35:47] to weep
[35:47] and to agonize in such agony that he
[35:50] sweated as it were
[35:51] great drops of blood you realize what
[35:54] was that
[35:54] it was the move of the spirit upon him
[35:58] and it caused an agony within because as
[36:01] a human being he didn't want to go
[36:03] through the torture
[36:04] he is a human he didn't want to suffer
[36:06] he didn't want to leave the love and
[36:07] affection of his disciples
[36:10] so it created in him turmoil agony
[36:13] stress anguish of soul
[36:17] what was it it was a move of the spirit
[36:21] until finally he could surrender all of
[36:24] the flesh
[36:24] all of the emotion all of the thoughts
[36:27] all of the desires
[36:28] until he could die and die and die until
[36:31] he can say
[36:32] not my will but thy will be done
[36:35] what was the holy ghost doing cooing
[36:37] over him trying to bring what was down
[36:40] inside to the surface
[36:41] to cut through the human part then to
[36:44] cut through the emotion
[36:45] to cut through the fear and get all the
[36:48] way down into the soul
[36:50] and say that's where the word is and the
[36:52] spirit was brooding
[36:53] trying to bring it up and eventually it
[36:56] popped up and said
[36:57] not my will but thy will be done
[37:01] oh hallelujah friends you realize how
[37:04] many
[37:05] things have lingered from a previous
[37:07] dispensation
[37:08] from a previous denominational view have
[37:10] carried over
[37:11] amen we shouldn't carry those things
[37:14] over but let's take what the prophet
[37:15] said about this
[37:16] and when we begin to look especially at
[37:18] the last year of his ministry
[37:20] he becomes very specific about these
[37:22] things and lets us know
[37:26] the spirit moved him sent him to
[37:28] calvary's cross
[37:30] there he died and everything that was
[37:32] spoken of him in his death was fulfilled
[37:34] to bring light and life to all the
[37:36] predestinated seed of god that was upon
[37:38] the earth
[37:39] he brought the way to do it here is the
[37:42] seed
[37:43] the spirit brings the life
[37:47] here is the seed the spirit brings the
[37:50] life
[37:50] transforming sons and daughters of god
[37:53] from the world in its dark chaos
[37:55] in to be sons and daughters of god
[37:59] brother bram says in spoken word is the
[38:00] original seed now jesus is the word made
[38:03] manifest
[38:04] he in the word is one and the same and
[38:06] that's why
[38:07] it was so made manifest in him so
[38:09] perfectly
[38:10] that's the reason that god manifested
[38:12] himself so perfectly in jesus
[38:14] because he was the seed word the germ
[38:16] word
[38:17] itself the germ that's inside the seed
[38:21] i want you to hold on to that statement
[38:24] because we're going to bring it right
[38:25] home to ourselves in a little bit
[38:27] the germ that's inside the seed that's
[38:30] the life
[38:31] in the seed so the germ that's inside
[38:35] the seed that's the life
[38:36] that's in the seed you got it you get it
[38:40] he was the germ word of god the germ is
[38:42] the spirit the germ is the water
[38:44] and jesus had to be broken open there in
[38:46] order for that seed to let forth its
[38:48] life
[38:49] to water other seed that was coming
[38:52] so the spirit had to come forth to water
[38:55] other seed that was coming
[38:56] do you see even he said other sheep
[38:59] that's not even of this fold i have
[39:01] they're going to see that they're going
[39:03] to get that word and stay right with it
[39:05] i'm sending forth the spirit to water it
[39:07] and it'll produce just exactly
[39:09] it'll produce miracles it'll produce
[39:11] power of god it'll produce
[39:12] and it will not deny anything because
[39:14] it's a kindred seed
[39:16] with the seed it's a kindred it won't
[39:19] deny
[39:20] when the spirit amen when when the germ
[39:22] of life that was in that seed
[39:24] amen that's the spirit or that's the
[39:26] water that breaks forth the water the
[39:27] other
[39:28] seed it will not deny it because it's a
[39:30] kindred to that seed
[39:31] it's the same seed line it's of the same
[39:35] family it's of the same thing so it
[39:37] won't deny it when it comes forth
[39:40] brother bam says in in the message
[39:42] paradox
[39:44] 1964 now what is it christ coming to his
[39:47] body
[39:48] christ is the word we all know the
[39:51] anointing is christ
[39:52] that comes on the word that makes the
[39:54] word live is that right
[39:56] that is the anointing christ is the
[39:58] anointing the spirit that comes upon the
[40:00] word that quickens the word to make it
[40:02] live
[40:03] now the word is in your heart you
[40:05] believe in divine healing whatever more
[40:06] see
[40:07] and christ the anointing coming to his
[40:10] body
[40:10] see the connection there just like
[40:12] husband and wife to become one
[40:15] so brother ma'am is typing this again
[40:17] with male and female
[40:18] he said christ is the anointing
[40:23] this the spirit that comes upon the word
[40:25] the word is in your heart
[40:27] and christ the anointing coming to his
[40:29] body so christ
[40:30] is the anointing amen or the spirit of
[40:33] god
[40:34] brooding over the seed that's in your
[40:36] heart to bring it into manifestation
[40:39] and they're the same seed they're of the
[40:42] same product
[40:43] they come from the same source so this
[40:45] one won't refuse the brooding of this
[40:47] one
[40:48] it won't refuse the word that's coming
[40:50] and the life that's coming and the
[40:52] brooding of the spirit
[40:53] won't be refused because whatever amen
[40:55] whatever produced this seed and it broke
[40:57] forth and the life of that seed is
[40:58] coming back on this seed
[41:00] there's something in that seed that
[41:01] matches this thing that's brooding over
[41:03] it and it won't deny it
[41:05] it's like husband and wife to become
[41:08] one
[41:12] brother baby says it is the rising of
[41:14] the sun now there you are
[41:16] if the bridegroom spirit dwells in the
[41:18] bride
[41:19] when god made his first bridegroom he
[41:21] made the bridegroom first
[41:22] and he was both man and woman and spirit
[41:24] formed him in the dust of the earth to
[41:26] make him material
[41:27] and notice when he made eve from adam he
[41:29] took not another piece of clay
[41:31] he took from the same piece of clay the
[41:33] same word
[41:34] for adam was spoken word what's that
[41:37] make the bride
[41:39] spoken word
[41:43] he took from him and then taken away
[41:45] from adam and placed it in
[41:47] eve i'm sorry he took from him and then
[41:49] taken he had
[41:50] masculine and feminist spirit
[41:54] and he took the feminist spirit away
[41:55] from adam and placed it in eve
[41:57] so it's still part of adam's spirit it's
[42:00] adam's flesh then it was adam's spirit
[42:03] the dynamic that quickened the mechanics
[42:05] of his body
[42:06] so the bride must also be flesh of his
[42:08] flesh and bone of his bone

[43:24] that's been quickened by the brooding of
[43:26] the spirit of god
[43:28] doing what taking your chaos and drawing
[43:30] it up
[43:31] flowers and trees and mouth and drawing
[43:34] it what
[43:34] drawing it to something that will
[43:36] perfectly reflect the one that's
[43:37] brooding over it
[43:41] praise be to god
[43:45] oh my the predestinated one of course
[43:47] like the seed laid upon the earth
[43:49] and the one that had life in them many
[43:51] of them were dead they were just rotten
[43:53] seed
[43:54] oh this is good
[43:58] if you believe you're one of them how
[43:59] many say i'm one of them
[44:01] this is this is going to make us happy

[44:26] earth
[44:27] the one that had life in them many of
[44:30] them were dead they were just rotten
[44:31] seed
[44:32] the waters and things burnt them out but
[44:34] you know there was a seed laying there
[44:36] ready for life god knowed it was laying
[44:39] there
[44:40] now the predestinated ones are the first
[44:42] to be quickened by the holy spirit
[44:44] for the holy spirit comes to claim its
[44:46] own now this is deep now
[44:47] and be sure to catch this good now as
[44:50] the sun was sent across the earth
[44:52] not to bring rocks which was dirt also
[44:54] to life
[44:55] it was not to bring all the dirt to life
[44:57] but was to bring
[44:58] part of the dirt which was enclosed
[45:00] around the life
[45:02] it was to bring part of the dirt and
[45:04] close the round of life
[45:06] we're to be flesh of his flesh and bone
[45:08] of his bone how
[45:09] the same spirit that raising from the
[45:11] dead dwell in you it'll quicken your
[45:13] mortal body
[45:14] to live his kind of life to manifest the
[45:17] manifestations he manifested to do the
[45:19] works that he did
[45:20] to obey like he obeyed to live like he
[45:23] lived what was it the same spirit that
[45:25] raised him from the dead dwelling you
[45:26] it'll quicken your mortal body what did
[45:29] the sun
[45:29] come to do when the sun came to shine
[45:32] amen it didn't come
[45:33] amen to bring all the dirt to life amen
[45:36] but only that dirt
[45:39] that was encompassed around a life
[45:42] inside of a seed
[45:43] that quickened that to life and when it
[45:45] quickened that to life
[45:46] it took that dirt around it and brought
[45:48] it up into the manifestation of the life
[45:50] that was on the inside
[45:53] it was flower life but flower had to
[45:55] pull
[45:56] all the ingredients from the earth to
[45:58] manifest flower life
[46:00] it was flower spirit amen but you can't
[46:03] see
[46:03] flower spirit but the flower the spirit
[46:06] remember plants have a spirit animals
[46:08] have a spirit
[46:12] you couldn't take flower spirit and see
[46:15] it
[46:16] so flower spirit amen when it was
[46:18] quickened on the inside of that seed
[46:20] had to pull from the dirt all the
[46:22] ingredients it would need
[46:24] to manifest flower life
[46:29] you eat food and what do you do from it
[46:31] you're drawing from the dirt you're
[46:32] drawing from the elements
[46:34] you're drawing and piecing your body
[46:36] together so that what
[46:37] so that this earth amen that's been
[46:39] redeemed by god
[46:41] can manifest the life that's in the seed
[46:43] on the inside
[46:44] because you can't see it with the
[46:46] natural eye but you can see the
[46:48] manifestation of the life that's on the
[46:50] inside
[46:51] and you couldn't say mrs jesus christ
[46:53] what's mrs jesus christ
[46:54] i don't understand mrs jesus christ
[46:56] until the life of mrs jesus christ
[46:58] takes the elements of the earth builds
[47:00] up a body and the life of mrs jesus
[47:03] christ is on display on the earth and
[47:05] then you can say
[47:06] ah i see mrs jesus christ
[47:10] amen the same thing that he did there
[47:12] he's doing here
[47:18] praise god let's read that again now the
[47:22] son was sent across the earth not to
[47:24] bring rocks which are part of the
[47:25] dirt also to life was not to bring all
[47:27] the dirt to life
[47:28] but was to bring the part of the dirt
[47:30] which was enclosed around
[47:32] a life not all men will receive christ
[47:35] oh no
[47:36] but those which god forbaned life is
[47:39] housed around some of the dirt of the
[47:41] earth
[47:42] that's the one he comes to quicken they
[47:44] are the ones
[47:47] that now that dirt would lay there in
[47:48] the sun and say oh this old sun
[47:50] is hot that means your flesh
[47:54] didn't like the word the first time you
[47:56] heard it
[47:59] don't drink don't smoke don't wear
[48:01] shorts you know
[48:03] stop cutting your hair dress like a lady
[48:05] act like a man
[48:06] oh my goodness how am i ever going to do
[48:08] this
[48:09] the dirt didn't so much like it you
[48:12] realize that the dirt
[48:14] didn't so much like it
[48:17] but something on the inside
[48:21] he said
[48:24] now the dirt would lay there in the sun
[48:26] and say oh that old sun is too hot it's
[48:29] so hot
[48:29] that rock said this old sun is so hot
[48:31] but that little seed said
[48:33] that's what i'm looking for and it began
[48:36] to spring forth to life it quickened
[48:38] that part of the dirt
[48:39] because the sun was sent not to quicken
[48:41] the rock not to quicken the dirt but to
[48:43] quicken the life
[48:45] of the seed oh catch that friends
[48:49] it come to quicken the life of the seed
[48:52] amen there's a seed amen that's the soul
[48:55] but there's got to be a life
[48:56] in that soul that he can quicken and
[48:59] it's got to be
[49:00] his life that's laying in the seat that
[49:02] he can quicken
[49:04] now the holy spirit comes now of course
[49:06] it wasn't sin
[49:08] why won't all the people receive it it
[49:10] wasn't sent
[49:11] to them he said a guy told me i don't
[49:15] believe
[49:16] i don't care what you'd say if you could
[49:18] raise up the dead or anything and heal
[49:20] the sick and prove it anyway
[49:21] i still don't believe it i said
[49:23] certainly not you're an unbeliever
[49:25] it don't mean a thing to you it wasn't
[49:27] even sent to you
[49:30] it's sent to those who will believe
[49:34] the message is to the believer to them
[49:37] that perish it's foolishness but to them
[49:39] that are in christ
[49:40] and part of that seed it's life
[49:44] part of that seed which seed
[49:47] the faith seed of abraham one seed not
[49:50] many one which is
[49:51] christ part of christ
[49:56] the seat shall not be heir with the
[49:58] shuck 1965
[50:00] that's what the church is doing today
[50:01] for jesus is the word
[50:03] and he's the bridegroom and the bride is
[50:06] part of the groom
[50:07] therefore the word that is to be
[50:08] fulfilled this day is the same part of
[50:11] the word that was fulfilled in his day
[50:13] and it's the same word same experience
[50:15] same life
[50:18] for when god separated adam he was both
[50:21] we find out adam was spirit to begin
[50:23] with
[50:24] he made man in his own image created him
[50:25] male and female and then genesis 2
[50:28] he created man out of the dust of the
[50:30] earth man was created in god's image
[50:32] god is a spirit so he's a spirit man
[50:35] then when he become flesh man
[50:36] animal flesh on the earth he is showing
[50:39] portraying hear the bride
[50:41] he never taken and made another being
[50:43] but he took part of adam the original
[50:45] creation
[50:46] took from him a rib from his side and
[50:48] took the feminist spirit
[50:50] out of adam left the masculine spirit in
[50:52] there
[50:53] and placed it in the feminist part
[50:56] therefore
[50:56] part of his spirit part of his body
[50:58] flesh of his flesh
[50:59] bone of his bone word of his word
[51:02] life of his life
[51:07] and that's the way the bride is to
[51:09] christ
[51:11] remember there's the germ or the life
[51:14] or the spirit that's inside the seed the
[51:17] predestinated seed
[51:19] amen and in god i mean it's a it's a
[51:22] part of christ
[51:23] it's a part of his own life amen and
[51:25] when the holy ghost begins to brood over
[51:27] that
[51:27] it's not brooding over to to to just
[51:30] touch the dirt amen it's looking for the
[51:33] life that is in the seed
[51:34] it's looking to bring the life that is
[51:36] already trapped in the seed
[51:43] he says and he says flesh of his flesh
[51:47] bone of his bone
[51:48] word of his word what is that on the
[51:52] inside
[51:53] of the predestinated believer it's the
[51:55] word
[51:56] it's the word god is the word
[52:01] what is the bible the word of god
[52:04] what what are written in the bible the
[52:07] believer are the words in the bible
[52:10] what is that inside of you what is that
[52:12] life it's the life of the word inside of
[52:14] you
[52:15] a seed is the word it's word of his word
[52:19] life of his life
[52:22] and broken cisterns brother bram says no
[52:24] pumping up it's power it's within itself
[52:27] it needs no priming he's talking about
[52:29] an artesian well
[52:30] you don't pump it up it's just flowing
[52:32] it needs no priming yes sir
[52:33] for itself its own life is in itself
[52:38] i want you to catch this friends he's
[52:40] talking about an artesian well
[52:42] and and jesus says that when the spirit
[52:44] comes into you
[52:45] you become an artesian well
[52:48] right you become a well flowing rivers
[52:51] of living water flowing out of your
[52:53] bellies
[52:53] you drink from the well you become the
[52:55] well and when the spirit comes into you
[52:57] you become an artesian wow
[52:59] and brother baby says you don't pump it
[53:00] up you know it's power is within itself
[53:04] it needs no priming yes sir for itself
[53:06] its own life is in itself
[53:08] that's the way the seed of god is in a
[53:10] man's heart
[53:11] the life of god is within the individual
[53:14] not in the church
[53:15] in you it's in you you're the one that
[53:18] has the germ of life
[53:20] in you
[53:23] now when the holy ghost in the beginning
[53:25] and chaos begin to brood over and part
[53:27] the waters and begin to brood
[53:29] and bring the word of god into
[53:30] manifestation and let the life strike
[53:32] that seed
[53:33] there was a certain life already in that
[53:36] seed
[53:36] and when that certain part of that life
[53:38] was quickened alive amen it became what
[53:41] it was predestinated to be
[53:43] when it was planted because there was
[53:46] something inside of it
[53:47] a genetic code a dna amen that was
[53:51] already it was already pre-wired it was
[53:53] already pre-programmed to be what it was
[53:55] going
[53:56] to be and the brooding of the holy ghost
[53:58] was bringing it higher
[53:59] and higher and higher to manifest what
[54:02] was the life that was already inside the
[54:04] sea
[54:06] and when god sowed his seed in this
[54:08] earth he knew
[54:09] what was inside of that seed and he
[54:11] sowed a seed in you and he sowed a seed
[54:13] in all his predestinated elected
[54:15] seed of god what is it it's a portion of
[54:17] his word it's an attribute of himself
[54:19] amen it's a piece of who god
[54:24] if it's a piece of god and you realize
[54:27] friends if it's a piece of god
[54:28] amen god knows where it's laying and
[54:31] he's going to send the brooding of the
[54:32] holy ghost to take the chaos and part
[54:35] the waters and let the light of the word
[54:37] strike that
[54:38] because that's a life that has to come
[54:40] into manifestation
[54:41] pre-programmed to manifest the bride in
[54:44] this day
[54:46] and the brooding of this moving of the
[54:47] holy ghost the brooding of the spirit
[54:49] is to bring it into greater
[54:50] manifestation and greater manifestation
[54:53] and greater manifestation because it's
[54:55] already programmed to be
[54:57] what it's going to be but it was laying
[55:00] there
[55:01] dead it was laying there without form it
[55:03] was laying there with no manifestation
[55:05] but there had to be something
[55:07] that would spark it into manifestation
[55:09] something that would quicken it to life
[55:11] so that it could go into action and
[55:12] start producing what it was programmed
[55:14] to produce
[55:16] and the move of the spirit the the
[55:18] baptism of the holy ghost
[55:20] come down upon that little seed and it
[55:23] sparked it to life
[55:24] it ignited it lit off the candle it did
[55:27] something amen to put into action
[55:29] what was already inside to start moving
[55:32] into manifestation
[55:35] if there was nothing there no matter how
[55:38] much the holy ghost cooed
[55:40] nothing's coming out of that dirt
[55:44] you realize it's two parts it's male and
[55:47] female
[55:49] it's two parts one is calling to the
[55:51] other
[55:52] and one is drawing the other and one is
[55:54] connecting to the other
[55:56] there's two parts positive and negative
[55:58] male and female
[56:01] and the holy ghost brooding amen it
[56:03] doesn't matter how
[56:04] powerful the holy ghost is
[56:08] it can't convert it cannot convert
[56:11] dirt with no life into life
[56:16] the life already had to be in the seed
[56:20] from a previous civilization from before
[56:23] the destruction
[56:24] from before the fall in the garden of
[56:26] eden there had to be a life amen that
[56:29] was going to be sown in this day
[56:30] and that life and god knew where that
[56:33] seed was
[56:34] and he knew how to move the spirit to
[56:36] get all the conditions right
[56:37] so that the right light and the right
[56:39] water and everything would hit that seat
[56:41] at the right time
[56:42] because there's already something in the
[56:45] seed it didn't come to put something in
[56:47] the seed it come to quicken what was
[56:49] already
[56:49] in the seed and spark it into life
[56:54] god did not make you a son of god
[56:58] you've always been a son of god
[57:01] amen and the new birth didn't turn you
[57:03] into a son of god
[57:05] the new birth was the spark it was the
[57:07] lighting of the candle it was the
[57:09] sparking off
[57:10] it was the holy ghost coming down and
[57:12] touching that other part of itself
[57:14] to bring up what was already in the seed
[57:17] and the holy ghost is still here
[57:18] brooding
[57:19] over his bride to bring her into more
[57:21] manifestation and more manifestation
[57:25] the holy ghost is powerful the word of
[57:28] god is powerful
[57:30] and when the word of god is preached and
[57:32] the fullness of his power
[57:33] it'll bring life
[57:36] but only if life is already there
[57:41] you understand it's not taking a
[57:43] cock-a-boo and turning it into a wheat
[57:46] it was a wheat before it was planted it
[57:48] was a cocker bird before it was planted
[57:50] before the waters parted it was already
[57:53] a palm tree or an apple tree or a wee
[57:55] the holy ghost was just moving bringing
[57:57] in the manifestation the life that was
[57:58] already inside
[58:00] and the preaching of the word is
[58:01] powerful
[58:03] and it can and brother bam said when
[58:05] when we're preaching we're holding the
[58:06] holy ghost out over the people and then
[58:08] people can reach up and grab it
[58:10] there can be a connection that is made
[58:12] amen but it's not
[58:14] taking and taking just dirt and turning
[58:16] it into a son of god
[58:18] it's quickening it's bringing forth the
[58:20] sons and daughters of god
[58:22] it's the move of the holy ghost it's the
[58:24] brooding of the holy spirit to bring
[58:25] forth what is already predestinated to
[58:28] be
[58:34] hallelujah it's not like we're seeking
[58:38] to get something else what we have is
[58:41] already on the inside
[58:43] we just want god to spark it in the life
[58:46] we want god to light it off we want
[58:48] god to brood over it and let the warmth
[58:50] of the sun bring it up higher
[58:52] and bring it up higher and bring it but
[58:54] it's got to come from the life on the
[58:55] inside
[59:00] if you wasn't pre-programmed to be the
[59:02] bride of jesus christ and the bride age
[59:05] then it'll take no effect on you
[59:09] but if you were pre-programmed the seed
[59:12] in you
[59:13] is a bride seed for a bright age
[59:17] then the word of this age will quicken
[59:18] and spark it to life
[59:20] and brood over it to bring it higher and
[59:22] higher into that manifestation
[59:25] not changing but brooding over and
[59:27] drawing out what's already there
[59:33] listen he says in the rising of the sun
[59:38] the eagle recognized the call of god's
[59:40] word why
[59:41] he's an eagle a
[59:44] eagle to an eagle
[59:48] not an eagle to a chicken who decides
[59:51] not to be a chicken anymore and turns
[59:53] himself into an eagle
[59:56] and you realize the eagle scream
[59:58] couldn't convert
[1:00:00] one chicken into an eagle
[1:00:04] the eagle scream when it flew over the
[1:00:06] barnyard was to call
[1:00:08] forth the life that was already in the
[1:00:11] eagle
[1:00:11] and bring an eagle into the
[1:00:13] manifestation of an eagle
[1:00:15] not to create an eagle
[1:00:19] oh hallelujah that's why when you heard
[1:00:21] the message amen
[1:00:23] for me when i first heard the message
[1:00:24] something in my brain was confused this
[1:00:28] is nothing like what i've heard before
[1:00:30] i was raised in church i was taught
[1:00:32] doctrine a certain way we had a certain
[1:00:33] shallow understanding of the bible and i
[1:00:35] began to hear the message
[1:00:36] and all of a sudden in my mind it's like
[1:00:38] this doesn't compute this doesn't add up
[1:00:40] i don't know how this matches what i've
[1:00:42] been taught
[1:00:42] but something on the inside was
[1:00:44] quivering under the word
[1:00:47] we listened to the preaching of the word
[1:00:48] and something inside
[1:00:50] something was happening to something on
[1:00:51] the inside but it wasn't my brain
[1:00:54] because my brain was confused
[1:00:55] i wanted to believe what my grandpa
[1:00:57] believed i wanted to believe what my
[1:00:58] uncle believed
[1:00:59] i wanted to believe what my parents
[1:01:01] believed but i found out i was an
[1:01:03] unbeliever in their doctrine because i
[1:01:05] was a true believer in the true word of
[1:01:07] god
[1:01:08] and i was a believer from before the
[1:01:10] foundation of the world
[1:01:11] i'd always been a believer because i was
[1:01:13] part of the word
[1:01:15] and when i come in contact with the word
[1:01:17] something on the inside began to move
[1:01:20] around
[1:01:20] men could recognize that's the truth
[1:01:25] it was an eagle to an eagle
[1:01:28] not an eagle to a chicken it was an
[1:01:31] eagle to an
[1:01:32] eagle that thought it was a chicken
[1:01:34] because the eagle had amnesia
[1:01:38] it didn't know where it came from didn't
[1:01:39] know who its parents was didn't know
[1:01:41] that had been taken from up on high
[1:01:43] and brought down to the earth and
[1:01:45] hatched out under a denominational
[1:01:46] system
[1:01:48] it didn't have any recollection of that
[1:01:50] amen it just
[1:01:51] it was just trying it was an eagle under
[1:01:53] the deception of the day
[1:01:55] trying to live out the manifestation it
[1:01:57] saw around it
[1:01:59] but that eagle was living a lie
[1:02:05] because it wasn't a chicken but it was
[1:02:07] trying to act like a chicken
[1:02:09] but that eagle was an eagle born an
[1:02:12] eagle
[1:02:13] eagle genes eagle blood
[1:02:17] it was an eagle but it took an eagle
[1:02:20] scream
[1:02:21] to wake up the eagle life on the inside
[1:02:25] and what happened it began to rise and
[1:02:27] connect eagle
[1:02:28] connected to evil listen
[1:02:33] i'll read this again the real ego
[1:02:34] recognizes the call of god's word why
[1:02:36] he's an eagle an eagle to an eagle the
[1:02:39] word before the found
[1:02:41] the word before the foundation the word
[1:02:44] to the word the word predestinated to
[1:02:48] the word written for the hour
[1:02:52] you realize your position the word
[1:02:55] predestinated what's that
[1:02:57] me to the word written for the hour
[1:03:02] when they come together you realize your
[1:03:04] position
[1:03:08] brother brennaman thinking man's filthy
[1:03:09] says notice the word cannot deny itself
[1:03:12] then it is then it is satisfied or it is
[1:03:16] the
[1:03:16] it is the desire it's a desire of what
[1:03:19] what made you desire
[1:03:20] in the first place because down in your
[1:03:22] soul there was a predestinated seed
[1:03:24] which was eternal life
[1:03:26] always laying in there always was
[1:03:29] in there that's why you can no more be
[1:03:32] lost and god can be lost that's why when
[1:03:34] jesus was on earth he had needs to go by
[1:03:36] samaria
[1:03:37] because there was a little seed gene of
[1:03:39] eternal life laying there
[1:03:40] that needed to be quick in the life god
[1:03:42] couldn't let you go
[1:03:44] he had to come and find you he couldn't
[1:03:47] let me go
[1:03:48] he had to come and find me
[1:03:51] praise be to god
[1:03:55] it was a little seed with which was
[1:03:57] eternal life always laying in there
[1:03:59] god's provided a place of worship as i
[1:04:02] said the other day when god moved and
[1:04:03] struck the sun across the earth
[1:04:05] he knowed them palm trees and everything
[1:04:07] was laying down there under the earth
[1:04:08] they was part of the earth at that time
[1:04:10] so were you
[1:04:12] so were you and when he raised up the
[1:04:15] son of god on easter morning and sent
[1:04:17] forth the holy spirit
[1:04:18] it was to quicken also the seed of
[1:04:20] eternal life
[1:04:21] that he foreknew before the foundation
[1:04:23] of the world that would be here
[1:04:26] he knew you would be here now
[1:04:30] and you didn't find him he found you and
[1:04:33] he's still brooding over you to bring
[1:04:35] you into full manifestation
[1:04:38] let's go to galatians chapter four
[1:04:41] we've quoted this but let's read it
[1:04:43] together
[1:04:44] galatians chapter four
[1:04:55] galatians chapter 4 verse 6
[1:05:00] and because you are sons
[1:05:06] and because you are sons
[1:05:10] god has sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:05:12] into your hearts
[1:05:14] crying abba father you didn't become a
[1:05:17] son
[1:05:18] after he spent the spirit of his son in
[1:05:20] your heart you were a son
[1:05:22] so he sent the spirit into your heart
[1:05:24] whereby you cry abba father
[1:05:26] because you are sons because you are
[1:05:29] sons
[1:05:30] always were sons god has sent forth the
[1:05:34] spirit of his son
[1:05:34] into your hearts crying abba father
[1:05:38] and back the things that are to be now
[1:05:42] the only way that you can be a son or
[1:05:44] daughter of god is because you
[1:05:46] you have to have eternal life there's
[1:05:49] only one form of eternal life and that's
[1:05:51] god's life
[1:05:54] only one form of eternal life that was
[1:05:56] god there to be a son of god
[1:05:59] you had to be in him always the gene of
[1:06:02] your life spiritual life tonight was in
[1:06:04] god the father before there was even a
[1:06:06] molecule
[1:06:09] and it's been it was laying in you i
[1:06:12] should say it this way
[1:06:13] dormant not really dormant because what
[1:06:16] is it it's eternal
[1:06:18] life it's eternal life
[1:06:21] when brother when brother bam talked
[1:06:23] about those seeds that was laying in the
[1:06:24] earth
[1:06:25] shrouded in darkness he said those seeds
[1:06:27] had been germinated they were already
[1:06:29] alive they just needed to wait for the
[1:06:30] condition to be right to manifest the
[1:06:32] light that was inside
[1:06:33] something had to spark them off to begin
[1:06:36] to grow
[1:06:37] but they already had the life inside of
[1:06:39] them but it took a life
[1:06:41] to them to quicken the life inside of
[1:06:44] them
[1:06:46] praise be to god it was the
[1:06:50] life of god the gene of your life
[1:06:51] spiritual tonight was in god the father
[1:06:53] before there was even a molecule
[1:06:55] and you're nothing but the manifestation
[1:06:57] of the gene of life
[1:06:58] that was in god as a son of god
[1:07:01] well i don't want to be anything else
[1:07:02] than that
[1:07:05] hey you're nothing but but i thought i
[1:07:08] was a farmer i thought no you're nothing
[1:07:10] but
[1:07:11] the manifestation of the gene of life
[1:07:14] that was in god as a son of god god just
[1:07:17] wanted to manifest himself
[1:07:19] amen he wanted to manifest himself as a
[1:07:21] farmer a barber a mailman
[1:07:23] a mother a father a teenager a student
[1:07:26] a child an older person amen god wanted
[1:07:29] to manifest himself
[1:07:30] as a widow as a widower god wanted to
[1:07:33] manifest himself
[1:07:34] you're nothing but the manifestation of
[1:07:36] the life that was in god in the
[1:07:37] beginning
[1:07:38] in whatever form or condition or place
[1:07:40] you find yourself
[1:07:41] god is wanting to manifest the life his
[1:07:44] own life
[1:07:44] and manifestation and the spirit of god
[1:07:46] is brooding in every situation
[1:07:48] to pull that life out every terrible
[1:07:52] circumstance you go through the spirit
[1:07:54] of god is still there
[1:07:55] brooding to pull a greater manifestation
[1:07:58] of that light
[1:07:58] to draw the seed up higher
[1:08:02] we're going to stop resisting all of
[1:08:04] these things and start recognizing
[1:08:06] it's god moving me to manifest his life
[1:08:11] but this is terrible it's terrible but
[1:08:13] god still wants to manifest
[1:08:15] his life in this body of flesh in this
[1:08:18] tabernacle he wants to quicken this
[1:08:20] mortal body
[1:08:20] to live his life upon this earth
[1:08:23] wherever i'm
[1:08:24] at and whatever title is labeled on me
[1:08:26] in whatever circumstance i'm in
[1:08:29] it's not the time to crawl in a hole and
[1:08:31] suck our thumbs
[1:08:32] and have a pity party when things go
[1:08:34] wrong it's time to stand on our feet and
[1:08:36] say god
[1:08:36] i can in my mind understand what's
[1:08:38] happening but if this is what you want
[1:08:41] let me manifest your life in this
[1:08:43] situation whatever you pre-ordain
[1:08:45] when you pre-program that life inside of
[1:08:48] me you're trying to draw something out
[1:08:50] and oh god
[1:08:51] draw it out now
[1:08:54] i yield to your brooding i yield to your
[1:08:57] moving
[1:08:58] move me into that place you want me to
[1:09:00] be
[1:09:02] it was the spirit of god moving jesus to
[1:09:05] calvary
[1:09:08] who do you think turned the hearts of
[1:09:10] his disciples against him
[1:09:17] why because there was word laying there
[1:09:19] that had to be made manifest
[1:09:21] who do you think turned the pharisees
[1:09:23] against him
[1:09:26] what was it why why was it
[1:09:29] amen everyone turned against him why was
[1:09:31] it the crowds dispersed
[1:09:33] why was it they all why because there
[1:09:35] was word there
[1:09:36] and he was that portion of that word to
[1:09:38] be displayed in that day
[1:09:40] he was the lamb slain before the
[1:09:43] foundation was he was the sacrifice
[1:09:46] so he had to manifest the life of the
[1:09:49] sacrifice
[1:09:50] in order to manifest the life of the
[1:09:52] sacrifice god had to put every piece
[1:09:54] into position
[1:09:55] so that he could manifest the life of
[1:09:57] the sacrifice
[1:10:01] it looked like everything was falling
[1:10:02] apart and everything was working against
[1:10:04] him but everything was working
[1:10:05] perfect on time to manifest the life
[1:10:08] that was inside of him
[1:10:09] because he was the lamb of god
[1:10:13] and you can tell by the way he prayed it
[1:10:16] wasn't the human desire
[1:10:18] in his mind that wanted to go there but
[1:10:21] there was something deeper inside that
[1:10:23] was compelling him
[1:10:24] to live the life live the life live the
[1:10:28] life
[1:10:31] and you're nothing oh i don't want to be
[1:10:34] nothing
[1:10:36] god help us be nothing but the
[1:10:39] manifestation of the gene of life
[1:10:41] that was in god as a son of god now
[1:10:44] you're expressed
[1:10:46] after his word has come in you to light
[1:10:48] up this age
[1:10:50] you are expressing god's life in you
[1:10:52] because you are a son
[1:10:53] or daughter of god therefore you get
[1:10:55] what i mean
[1:10:57] you are you are now made you're sitting
[1:10:59] in this church tonight because your duty
[1:11:01] is to express god to this nation
[1:11:02] and this people and this neighborhood
[1:11:04] where you associate
[1:11:06] wherever you are god knew that you would
[1:11:08] be here because you have to be one of
[1:11:10] his genes
[1:11:11] or his attributes you had to be if you
[1:11:13] ever
[1:11:14] if you've got eternal life then it
[1:11:16] always was
[1:11:17] eternal life
[1:11:21] you understand that what it's what is it
[1:11:24] zoe life where was the zoe life
[1:11:28] in the seed what
[1:11:31] came to zoe life to quicken zoe life
[1:11:34] zoe life came to zoe life to quicken zoe
[1:11:38] life
[1:11:40] the seed the life the germ of the seed
[1:11:43] in jesus day
[1:11:44] that germ was released to come back amen
[1:11:47] and touch the germ of the seed in my
[1:11:48] life
[1:11:49] to quicken it to life life come to life
[1:11:51] word
[1:11:52] come to word the word predestinated to
[1:11:54] the word written for the age they
[1:11:56] connected
[1:11:57] male and female come together to bring
[1:12:00] forth the manifestation of the life
[1:12:01] that's on the inside
[1:12:06] praise be to god
[1:12:10] he says if you got eternal life then it
[1:12:13] always was eternal life and god before
[1:12:15] there was a foundation a world
[1:12:17] knew that you would be here and when the
[1:12:19] word or the water
[1:12:20] the washing of the water of the word
[1:12:21] fell upon you it was expressed in a
[1:12:24] being
[1:12:25] now you have fellowship with your father
[1:12:26] god just as you have with your earthly
[1:12:28] father
[1:12:29] you are citizens of the king not
[1:12:30] citizens but children sons and daughters
[1:12:32] of the living god
[1:12:33] if it be that eternal life dwells in you
[1:12:39] an eagle to an eagle
[1:12:44] zoe life to zoe life
[1:12:48] do we understand male to female
[1:12:52] there was something always there that's
[1:12:55] why
[1:12:56] when we witness to people we realize
[1:12:58] this message isn't for everybody
[1:13:01] you can't change what seed's already
[1:13:04] laying there
[1:13:05] you can't change it it's there that's
[1:13:06] why when we witness and we testify
[1:13:08] we don't stress out when people come and
[1:13:12] people go
[1:13:12] and people visit a few times and they
[1:13:14] don't come back they come once they
[1:13:16] never come
[1:13:16] they come and stay you realize we've got
[1:13:19] no control over that
[1:13:20] and we don't want to start pressing
[1:13:23] people through a human emotion oh no no
[1:13:25] please come back one more time
[1:13:26] no no no would you please stay no we're
[1:13:28] not looking for that kind of conversion
[1:13:30] that's not a conversion
[1:13:32] what we need is we need somebody just to
[1:13:35] hear the word of god
[1:13:36] and let the holy ghost begin to brood
[1:13:38] over the chaos in their lives
[1:13:40] until they can strike down till an eagle
[1:13:43] can scream to an eagle
[1:13:44] and an eagle can hear the eagle scream
[1:13:48] we're not trying to chain chickens down
[1:13:50] in their seats and say
[1:13:51] if you sit here long enough you'll
[1:13:52] believe like i believe they could sit
[1:13:54] here forever and not believe like you
[1:13:56] believe
[1:13:57] because there's nothing inside to
[1:13:59] believe this message with
[1:14:01] it's got to be a seed that's already
[1:14:03] planted
[1:14:05] we stress out so much over who's going
[1:14:08] to listen who's going to come and how
[1:14:09] will i get them to listen
[1:14:10] don't stress about nothing let god do
[1:14:13] the brooding amen you just shine the
[1:14:15] light of the age
[1:14:16] you just speak the word and love you
[1:14:18] speak the truth and love and if there's
[1:14:20] a resting place for that word if there's
[1:14:22] a connection
[1:14:23] it'll make the connection
[1:14:28] that was a hard connection to make that
[1:14:30] day when jesus was on earth to connect
[1:14:32] with that woman who had lived the life
[1:14:34] of a prostitute in samaria
[1:14:36] do you realize what a difficult
[1:14:38] connection that was
[1:14:40] you know the jews have no dealing with
[1:14:41] the samaritans jesus with a good
[1:14:44] reputation should never be alone with a
[1:14:45] woman of a bad reputation
[1:14:48] you realize she couldn't even go to the
[1:14:49] well when all the other women go to the
[1:14:50] well she had to go at a different time
[1:14:52] for people of a bad character and then
[1:14:54] you realize that
[1:14:56] that jesus wasn't even dealing in the
[1:14:57] realms of samaria so much he was working
[1:14:59] elsewhere in the ministry
[1:15:00] it was a hard connection to make that
[1:15:02] day but nobody had to figure it out for
[1:15:05] her
[1:15:05] and nobody had to figure it out for
[1:15:07] christ but there was a life inside of
[1:15:09] him the life of the father
[1:15:11] that was moving him to hunt out the seed
[1:15:13] because the spirit of god when it moved
[1:15:15] is brooding over to bring up the seed
[1:15:20] and god like a heat-seeking missile went
[1:15:22] down at the right time of the day
[1:15:27] he went to a place where the jews didn't
[1:15:29] want to be
[1:15:31] and a people where they didn't want to
[1:15:32] associate
[1:15:34] to a well at the wrong time of the day
[1:15:37] and then he sent his disciples away
[1:15:40] because he couldn't have any questions
[1:15:41] or doubt or unbelief to hinder this
[1:15:46] and then she come along and they made a
[1:15:49] connection
[1:15:50] and something happened on the inside
[1:15:54] if god can work that out for her what
[1:15:56] about your co-worker what about your
[1:15:58] friend what about your family member
[1:16:02] god has a plan we're not here to stress
[1:16:04] ourselves
[1:16:05] and to worry ourselves sick we're here
[1:16:07] to commit things to god and believe
[1:16:10] and brother branham said when he applies
[1:16:11] the token it wasn't you begging your
[1:16:13] family to come to church
[1:16:14] and then applying the token is having
[1:16:16] the same faith that converted you the
[1:16:18] same faith you have in your salvation
[1:16:20] is the same faith you have and their
[1:16:22] salvation you just believe
[1:16:24] god will do it and then let god
[1:16:27] do it
[1:16:31] amen why because if there's not
[1:16:34] something there all we're going to do is
[1:16:35] frustrate people and frustrate ourselves
[1:16:39] god knows where it's at and brother said
[1:16:42] not every seed comes up in the same
[1:16:43] season
[1:16:46] the sun shines and you've got early an
[1:16:48] early harvest and early starters
[1:16:50] and things that come up in in late
[1:16:52] spring things that come up in summer
[1:16:54] and things that are a fall plant thing
[1:16:56] amen not everything comes up in the same
[1:16:58] season
[1:16:58] but all the life will come up
[1:17:02] if there's a germinated seed laying
[1:17:04] there it'll come up it may not come up
[1:17:06] when you think it should come up but
[1:17:07] it'll come up when it was pre-programmed
[1:17:09] to come out of the ground
[1:17:11] and it may be the last one and the last
[1:17:13] moment at the last
[1:17:14] and then the last stroke of midnight
[1:17:16] before the last chime dings
[1:17:18] it doesn't matter if it's a
[1:17:19] predestinated seat it'll be there
[1:17:23] we've just got to we just got to believe
[1:17:26] committed to god and believe
[1:17:28] that he's more able to meet them at a
[1:17:30] well somewhere than you
[1:17:31] are
[1:17:34] praise be to god
[1:17:40] thinking man's filter what is it it's
[1:17:42] the germ seed word from the beginning
[1:17:44] that you was in god at the beginning
[1:17:47] standing here
[1:17:48] drawing the seed life the seed is in
[1:17:50] your heart by foreign nation hallelujah
[1:17:52] the seed is already in there
[1:17:54] by foreknowledge of god predestination
[1:17:56] and when it draws it can't draw through
[1:17:58] nothing else but the word
[1:18:01] this has nothing to do with intellect
[1:18:06] the seed on the inside can't draw
[1:18:07] through anything else but the word
[1:18:09] not even what you think about the word
[1:18:11] it can only draw from the word
[1:18:14] further in thinking mansfield 3 says but
[1:18:16] a thinking woman won't take that kind of
[1:18:18] thing
[1:18:19] she knows she's got to be holy and the
[1:18:21] only thing that you can draw
[1:18:22] through god's word is the spirit the
[1:18:24] quickening power to make the word itself
[1:18:27] which is in you live to manifest
[1:18:30] jesus christ in the age you're living
[1:18:33] hallelujah brother
[1:18:34] if that ain't the truth i don't know
[1:18:36] what the truth is i've lost my mind if
[1:18:38] that isn't the truth he hasn't lost his
[1:18:40] mind
[1:18:41] he's the one in that day who had the
[1:18:43] mind of christ
[1:18:44] he had the right mind he may have lost a
[1:18:46] denominational mind but he had the mind
[1:18:48] of christ it's the word itself in your
[1:18:55] heart predestinated there that's drawing
[1:18:58] what's drawing not your mind
[1:19:01] but it's the seed it's the life on the
[1:19:03] inside that is drawing on that word
[1:19:06] not your mind because sometimes you hear
[1:19:08] things that you can't add up
[1:19:09] you can't repeat you can't compute but
[1:19:12] something inside says
[1:19:13] amen brother that's the truth
[1:19:16] and then when you get home your wife
[1:19:17] says what was that he said i don't know
[1:19:19] i can't retell it but it was the truth
[1:19:22] why because something on the inside's
[1:19:24] drawing not the mind
[1:19:25] amen the mind is so easily confused it's
[1:19:27] so easily swayed
[1:19:29] it's so easily persuaded from one thing
[1:19:31] to another thing
[1:19:32] and you see people flop from one idea to
[1:19:34] another idea
[1:19:35] we ourselves will we'll we'll flop from
[1:19:37] one idea to another idea we think this
[1:19:39] is certainly right no no no this is
[1:19:41] certainly right
[1:19:42] no something in between is certainly
[1:19:43] right because the mind can't draw on
[1:19:45] that word and get
[1:19:46] anywhere but something on the inside
[1:19:48] that come from the foundation before the
[1:19:50] foundation of the world
[1:19:51] it's the very life of god it's the word
[1:19:54] itself a portion of it inside of you
[1:19:56] that is drawing through the internet
[1:19:58] forget it through the emotion forget it
[1:20:00] it's
[1:20:00] drawing that word and it's growing into
[1:20:03] a greater manifestation
[1:20:06] praise god let's turn to first peter
[1:20:11] look at another scripture here
[1:20:19] aren't you so glad you didn't have to do
[1:20:21] anything
[1:20:26] you realize this takes away
[1:20:29] all the works programs
[1:20:33] it just smashes all the it even takes
[1:20:37] away the whole idea of i have to have a
[1:20:38] certain sensation or a certain
[1:20:40] experience
[1:20:41] brother branham said the new birth is
[1:20:42] his personal experience you have to have
[1:20:44] an experience
[1:20:46] and he said it's the experience of your
[1:20:47] candle being lit something sparking off
[1:20:49] life
[1:20:50] you have to make contact with a living
[1:20:52] god and it has to spark something to
[1:20:54] life and you
[1:20:55] activate something in the action bring
[1:20:57] the seed that's dormant into action
[1:20:58] there's got to be a contact you've made
[1:21:00] there's got to be an experience that you
[1:21:02] have
[1:21:02] but your experience doesn't have to
[1:21:04] match anybody else's experience
[1:21:07] it's personal to you and it's something
[1:21:09] where something inside of you changed
[1:21:11] it shifted whatever it was is different
[1:21:13] amen i feel different i think different
[1:21:15] amen everything in me is changing
[1:21:17] the holy ghost is brooding over me and
[1:21:19] whatever that was
[1:21:20] i'm changing and changing and changing
[1:21:23] and changing
[1:21:25] it's a change but you don't have to have
[1:21:28] a certain sensation or a certain dynamic
[1:21:31] this or a certain dynamic that what you
[1:21:33] have to have is
[1:21:34] you have to meet that spark of life that
[1:21:36] sparks the spark inside
[1:21:38] amen whether something inside is waiting
[1:21:41] for something to make contact with it
[1:21:43] to bring it into manifestation
[1:21:47] and when that happens that's a new birth
[1:21:51] it's the baptism holy ghost the genuine
[1:21:53] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:21:56] brother-in-law says or i'm sorry first
[1:21:59] peter 22
[1:22:04] seeing you have purified your souls and
[1:22:06] obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:22:07] unto unfeigned love of the brethren
[1:22:10] see that you love one another with a
[1:22:11] pure heart fervently being born again
[1:22:14] not of corruptable seed that's your
[1:22:17] first birth
[1:22:20] that was corruptible seed being born
[1:22:22] again not of corruptible seed
[1:22:24] but of incorruptible so you're going to
[1:22:27] be born again
[1:22:28] of an incorruptible seed
[1:22:32] by the word of god
[1:22:39] the word has to come to the
[1:22:41] incorruptable seed in the heart
[1:22:44] that is the word there's something in
[1:22:47] you
[1:22:47] that's zoe life that it come from god
[1:22:51] that is incorruptible
[1:22:56] and the life of that word has to meet
[1:22:59] the life of the word
[1:23:02] and it's got to be born again or coming
[1:23:05] to manifestation
[1:23:06] the corruptable seed's already there the
[1:23:09] the incorruptable seed is already there
[1:23:13] waiting for the word life to come and
[1:23:15] spring it into action
[1:23:19] power of transformation brother man said
[1:23:21] let the holy spirit come upon any person
[1:23:23] that's truly got something down there
[1:23:28] do you realize the holy ghost can come
[1:23:29] on somebody that doesn't have anything
[1:23:30] down there
[1:23:34] but let the holy spirit come upon any
[1:23:36] person that's truly got something down
[1:23:37] there
[1:23:39] listen to what he's going to say just
[1:23:41] catch it
[1:23:42] let the holy spirit come upon any person
[1:23:44] that's truly got something down there
[1:23:46] a healing comes from the inside
[1:23:49] let that healing come from the spirit
[1:23:51] that's in you
[1:23:53] if it's genuine spirit anointing the
[1:23:55] genuine seed it can't do nothing but
[1:23:57] bear a son or daughter of god
[1:23:59] but the genuine spirit can come upon a
[1:24:01] cocker bird seed and the rain can fall
[1:24:03] upon a cockroach and it will make it
[1:24:04] live just the same as it falls upon the
[1:24:06] wheat and makes it live
[1:24:07] but by their fruits you know them see
[1:24:10] and we're a fruit tree of god
[1:24:11] bearing his word amen
[1:24:14] the they're in the condition now where
[1:24:16] the bright shining light
[1:24:18] of the word is going to bring every seed
[1:24:20] that's in the field
[1:24:21] to full harvest maturity it's going to
[1:24:23] bring it out of the ground and it's
[1:24:24] going to bring it to full harvest
[1:24:25] maturity
[1:24:26] every seed that was in the ground in
[1:24:28] genesis 1 amen come
[1:24:30] forth every seed that had life and it
[1:24:32] would come forth
[1:24:34] and in this day god is bringing
[1:24:36] everything back to fruit again so we can
[1:24:39] see the two vines
[1:24:41] we can see what happened in the garden
[1:24:43] but this holy ghost is there if the holy
[1:24:45] ghost comes down
[1:24:46] on anything that's got life in there
[1:24:48] it'll quicken it to life
[1:24:51] god's power to transform he says god
[1:24:53] through a seed of his word
[1:24:55] and there is only one thing that can
[1:24:57] quicken the word and that is the spirit
[1:24:59] for it's the life giver to the word
[1:25:03] and when the life in the word i love all
[1:25:06] these terms brother branham
[1:25:08] he's speaking all this right at the end
[1:25:10] of his ministry in the last several
[1:25:11] months of his ministry
[1:25:13] he says and the life in the word meets
[1:25:16] the life of the spirit
[1:25:17] it produces what whatever the seed is
[1:25:21] these two lifes come together these two
[1:25:24] spirits come together amen these the
[1:25:27] eagle to the eagle
[1:25:29] word to word life to life zoe to zoe
[1:25:33] do you understand you're always been a
[1:25:35] son of god
[1:25:36] you'll never not be a son of god and it
[1:25:39] was never dependent on your merit it was
[1:25:41] never dependent on your conduct that's
[1:25:43] why
[1:25:43] trying to act right and do good amen
[1:25:45] it's nothing more than an
[1:25:47] effort amen that will not produce life
[1:25:49] amen but
[1:25:50] life comes from the seed and when the
[1:25:52] life is quickened the life
[1:25:54] the outcrop is the life of jesus christ
[1:25:57] you just
[1:25:57] quit drinking you quit smoking you quit
[1:26:00] womanizing
[1:26:01] you quit pornography you quit all those
[1:26:03] other things but we have so many people
[1:26:05] trying to quit all of that so they can
[1:26:07] receive a new birth but it's the new
[1:26:09] birth that pushes all that out of our
[1:26:10] life
[1:26:12] we get the whole thing backwards and
[1:26:14] we're pressing people amen to beat on an
[1:26:16] altar and to cry out
[1:26:18] amen and to be under constant turmoil
[1:26:20] amen there's nothing they can do about
[1:26:22] it
[1:26:23] [Applause]
[1:26:24] there is nothing all that we can do is
[1:26:26] sit under the word and say god quicken
[1:26:28] me to life
[1:26:29] god quickened me to life god quickened
[1:26:31] me to life i'm
[1:26:32] willing to die i'm willing to give it up
[1:26:34] but god you've got to do
[1:26:36] something there's got to be something
[1:26:39] more than my effort because my effort is
[1:26:41] failing
[1:26:43] there's got to be something more than my
[1:26:45] good conduct because i can't keep a good
[1:26:47] report card
[1:26:53] lay in the presence of the son and say
[1:26:55] god i know this word is true
[1:26:58] and there's something stirring me that
[1:27:00] says it's true god i believe it's true
[1:27:02] but i need something would you like to
[1:27:05] candle in me would you let that spark
[1:27:07] hit lord so to bring the life what's
[1:27:09] inside of me
[1:27:10] because i can't do it on my own i need
[1:27:13] the life that's pre-programmed in the
[1:27:15] seed
[1:27:15] to be brooded over by the holy ghost and
[1:27:17] brought up into a manifestation
[1:27:19] and bear its own fruit
[1:27:22] [Music]
[1:27:25] praise god we put ourselves under
[1:27:30] so much when what he needs
[1:27:34] is yielded he doesn't need human efforts
[1:27:37] he needs a yielded life
[1:27:40] he needs a recognition of what's true
[1:27:42] and just say god
[1:27:45] whatever you are i want to be
[1:27:50] there's a desire down in me that i can't
[1:27:53] explain
[1:27:55] there's a desire in my heart that is
[1:27:58] unexplainable
[1:28:00] it didn't come by education
[1:28:03] i didn't rub off from a mother or father
[1:28:06] but there's a real desire inside of me
[1:28:08] for you
[1:28:10] it must mean that i'm part of you
[1:28:15] god i'm willing to die
[1:28:19] just bring this part to life
[1:28:25] just stay there until something quickens
[1:28:30] you can't make anything you can't force
[1:28:32] it
[1:28:34] you can't push your way into it all you
[1:28:37] can do is ask
[1:28:38] god to bring a spark of life to the seed
[1:28:41] inside of me
[1:28:44] you know what if he's put something in
[1:28:47] you to believe for that
[1:28:50] how many people in the world want that
[1:28:53] how many people in the world really want
[1:28:55] to live this message
[1:28:58] you take all the prophet taught and all
[1:29:00] that was said and then you tie it in
[1:29:01] with all the rejection that's coming and
[1:29:03] all
[1:29:04] and everything who really wants to live
[1:29:08] that
[1:29:10] the children of god the ones that are
[1:29:13] pre-programmed to it
[1:29:15] they want to live it they want to
[1:29:17] manifest it
[1:29:18] they want it
[1:29:24] brown says it is the rising of the sun
[1:29:28] so now then not only that he sent word
[1:29:32] to his disciples
[1:29:34] his believing fear not for i am he that
[1:29:36] was dead and is alive again forevermore
[1:29:38] and i have the keys of death and hell
[1:29:40] i've already conquered it don't fear
[1:29:42] anymore for every foreordained
[1:29:44] predestinated seed of god shall come to
[1:29:45] life
[1:29:46] when that light spreads across the earth
[1:29:48] of the glorious gospel in every age
[1:29:50] it'll bring forth the crop that god
[1:29:52] ordained it to do
[1:29:54] and what a wonderful thing that is i'm
[1:29:56] alive
[1:29:57] i am alive or quickened the word means
[1:30:00] the word quicken the greek word means
[1:30:01] that something that's made alive after
[1:30:03] death
[1:30:04] like the seed that goes into the earth
[1:30:06] it has to die
[1:30:08] every bit of the seed it has to rot
[1:30:12] every bit of the seed and every bit of
[1:30:15] the life that was in the seed
[1:30:16] has to come forth again
[1:30:20] every bit of you has to die
[1:30:24] the seed your soul the essence of who
[1:30:26] you are
[1:30:27] every bit of you has to die and rot
[1:30:31] just like a natural seed everything has
[1:30:34] to die
[1:30:36] all your hopes all your dreams all your
[1:30:38] ambitions your plans for the future
[1:30:40] your feelings about stuff your emotions
[1:30:42] it's all got to die
[1:30:45] and every bit i like what i said every
[1:30:47] bit
[1:30:48] every bit of the seed it has to rot
[1:30:50] every bit of the seed
[1:30:51] and every bit of the life that was in
[1:30:54] the seed
[1:30:56] has to come forth again
[1:31:00] all of you all of you
[1:31:04] and your personal makeup as you've come
[1:31:05] down through this life
[1:31:07] the essence and core of who you are it's
[1:31:09] got to die
[1:31:11] so that all that you were predestinated
[1:31:13] to be and all the life that's inside of
[1:31:15] you can come forth
[1:31:17] when one dies in rot another springs to
[1:31:19] life
[1:31:21] say god i'm just laying here
[1:31:26] dying to myself i'm just laying here
[1:31:30] rotting to all my ideas so that every
[1:31:33] bit of the life inside of me
[1:31:34] can come to life where is it it's
[1:31:38] already there
[1:31:41] it's already there
[1:31:44] it just had the conditions have to get
[1:31:47] right for it to spring to life
[1:31:51] let's look at ephesians chapter 2.
[1:32:09] ephesians chapter 2
[1:32:14] i can see we're not going to get much
[1:32:15] further
[1:32:17] praise the lord ephesians 2 1
[1:32:23] and you hath he quickened who were dead
[1:32:26] in trespasses and sins
[1:32:29] he's quickened them to life who were
[1:32:31] dead and trespasses and sins
[1:32:33] you realize that real zoe life on the
[1:32:36] inside that that seed gene the germ of
[1:32:38] god inside can never die
[1:32:41] but everything else was dead in sins and
[1:32:43] trespasses it was dead and unbelief it
[1:32:45] was dead to the things of god
[1:32:47] amen but he's got to take that deadness
[1:32:49] and quicken it to life
[1:32:51] because there's life on the inside and
[1:32:53] life has to connect with
[1:32:54] life
[1:32:57] let's go to colossians 2
[1:33:01] and 13. just a couple books over
[1:33:11] colossians 2 and 13 and you being dead
[1:33:14] in your sins in the uncircumcision of
[1:33:16] your flesh
[1:33:16] hath he quickened together with him
[1:33:18] having forgiven you all trespasses
[1:33:21] you were dead in unbelief you were dead
[1:33:24] to the things of god
[1:33:25] you were dead to the life that was on
[1:33:27] the inside although that life could
[1:33:28] never be dead you understand that
[1:33:30] that zoe life eternal life it could
[1:33:32] never be dead but it was laying there
[1:33:33] inactive it wasn't
[1:33:35] it wasn't i don't even want to say
[1:33:36] inactive because it's the thing that's
[1:33:38] moved to your whole life
[1:33:40] but it was inactive to you you were dead
[1:33:43] to it you were clouded in unbelief and
[1:33:45] misunderstanding and wrong theology and
[1:33:48] wrong actions
[1:33:48] and you're laying there dead to it amen
[1:33:50] and all of a sudden something comes to
[1:33:52] spark at the life
[1:33:53] and it takes over and you realize i'm a
[1:33:55] son of god
[1:33:58] he says brother baby says in the message
[1:34:01] the rapture
[1:34:02] then how do we get into this body first
[1:34:04] corinthians 12 by one spirit we're all
[1:34:06] baptized in this body
[1:34:08] by one holy spirit baptism that if you
[1:34:10] want to put that down it's first
[1:34:11] corinthians 12 13 and by one spirit
[1:34:13] we're all baptized
[1:34:14] and the spirit is the life of christ is
[1:34:16] that right
[1:34:18] the life of christ and the life of any
[1:34:20] seed which he was the word seed
[1:34:23] brings the seed to life you got it
[1:34:26] the life of any seed brings the seed to
[1:34:29] life
[1:34:30] what's the life of the seed that's
[1:34:32] inside of you christ
[1:34:36] and the life of christ brings the seed
[1:34:39] of christ to life
[1:34:40] why they're kindred seeds
[1:34:43] amen it takes a male and a female
[1:34:46] to come together to spark to life
[1:34:49] and it takes the spirit of the seed and
[1:34:52] the life of the seed and the spirit of
[1:34:54] the seed come together and quicken the
[1:34:56] life
[1:34:58] hallelujah and the spirit is of the is
[1:35:00] the life of christ is that right
[1:35:03] and the life of christ and the life of
[1:35:04] any seed which was the word seed brings
[1:35:06] the seed to life you get it
[1:35:08] if that life is laying in the seed
[1:35:12] and this baptism of the holy spirit
[1:35:14] comes upon it it's
[1:35:15] bound to bring that seed to life
[1:35:19] if that life is laying in the seed
[1:35:23] remember it's got to be that life in the
[1:35:25] seed of your soul
[1:35:28] but if that life isn't there then the
[1:35:30] baptism the holy ghost can't bring it to
[1:35:32] life
[1:35:35] if that life is laying in the seed and
[1:35:37] this baptism of the holy spirit comes
[1:35:39] upon it
[1:35:39] it's bound to bring that seed to life
[1:35:43] he said in a modern event it's made
[1:35:44] clear by prophecy this is just two days
[1:35:46] later
[1:35:48] notice we find today that there are many
[1:35:49] people just can't believe
[1:35:51] even spirit-filled people
[1:35:55] this is the heavy part we're getting to
[1:35:58] the heavy part
[1:36:00] because we want to talk about the move
[1:36:01] of the spirit
[1:36:03] many people just can't believe even
[1:36:05] spirit
[1:36:06] filled people i'm going to give you one
[1:36:09] that'll
[1:36:10] choke you the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:36:13] don't mean you're getting
[1:36:14] you're going in not at all not on that
[1:36:16] don't have
[1:36:17] anything to do with your soul
[1:36:20] that's the baptism see here's the inside
[1:36:23] soul in here
[1:36:24] that has to come from god but then on
[1:36:27] the outside you have five senses
[1:36:30] five inlets contact your earthly home
[1:36:31] the inside you have a spirit
[1:36:33] and there you have five outlets your
[1:36:34] conscience love and so forth the five
[1:36:36] outlets to the spirit
[1:36:37] remember in that spirit you can be
[1:36:39] baptized with the genuine spirit of god
[1:36:41] and still
[1:36:42] be lost
[1:36:46] it's the soul that lives that was
[1:36:48] ordained of god
[1:36:52] so what's the move of the spirit to do
[1:36:55] what's the baptism of the holy ghost for
[1:37:00] many people don't believe even spirit
[1:37:03] filled
[1:37:03] people don't believe brother said
[1:37:07] receiving the baptism in the lagos don't
[1:37:09] mean you've made it
[1:37:12] so having a wonderful spiritual
[1:37:14] experience doesn't mean we've made it
[1:37:18] having sensations and getting excited
[1:37:21] and running around
[1:37:22] amen and feeling and it's the genuine
[1:37:24] outpouring of the holy ghost it's a
[1:37:25] genuine move of the spirit
[1:37:27] it's genuine and real and really god and
[1:37:30] it brings a real enthusiasm and
[1:37:31] excitement but that still
[1:37:33] doesn't mean we've arrived
[1:37:37] the baptism of the holy ghost has to
[1:37:40] connect with a life on the inside of the
[1:37:43] seed
[1:37:43] and quicken that the life and that's the
[1:37:45] new birth
[1:37:47] that's the reason the spirit moved in
[1:37:49] the first place
[1:37:50] and sometimes amen we can be in a
[1:37:52] service or we can be in a place where
[1:37:54] the spirit of god begins to move
[1:37:56] what is the spirit of god looking for
[1:37:57] it's looking for the life down inside
[1:37:59] that seed to quicken it to life
[1:38:01] but many people can feel the spirit fall
[1:38:04] many people can feel the spirit of god
[1:38:06] and move through the assembly but that's
[1:38:08] not the reason it fell
[1:38:09] just to make people feel something it
[1:38:12] fell to bring seed to life
[1:38:15] that's the important part the seed the
[1:38:17] life and when the seed comes to life
[1:38:19] brother brown said what's the evidence
[1:38:21] of the new birth that it recognizes the
[1:38:23] word for its day
[1:38:24] and it receives all the word and doesn't
[1:38:26] choke on the word and not afraid to move
[1:38:28] with the word and as the light moves
[1:38:30] it moves with the light it'll receive
[1:38:33] what it'll
[1:38:34] the spirit of god will lead and guide
[1:38:35] you into all
[1:38:37] truth the truth you know now the truth
[1:38:40] you know 10 years ago
[1:38:42] the truth that's going to be revealed to
[1:38:43] you tomorrow
[1:38:46] brother said it's the evidence there's
[1:38:48] an experience and then there's an
[1:38:50] evidence
[1:38:51] you have to have the experience the
[1:38:53] experience is what lights it off
[1:38:57] but the experience has to bring a
[1:38:58] genuine evidence
[1:39:00] amen that's why you see the the spirit
[1:39:02] of god
[1:39:03] move that spirit of god might have moved
[1:39:04] through an assembly for one seed
[1:39:09] and you have people who have a wonderful
[1:39:11] service and a wonderful
[1:39:13] and it's wonderful we love those things
[1:39:14] i want more and more and more of that
[1:39:18] but that's why people they'll have an
[1:39:20] experience like that and they'll go
[1:39:21] right back out and that same night or
[1:39:23] the next night they'll be viewing
[1:39:24] pornography on their computer
[1:39:29] thinking that they received the baptist
[1:39:31] how he goes and it was a baptism only
[1:39:32] goes
[1:39:33] in the spirit realm but there's got to
[1:39:35] be something in the soul that's quick in
[1:39:36] the life
[1:39:37] and changed there's got to be a change
[1:39:40] there's got to be another life
[1:39:41] the old life has to rot out and this
[1:39:43] life has to take over
[1:39:45] and the holy ghost has to draw us up
[1:39:47] into another manifestation
[1:39:48] of another life it can't be a wonderful
[1:39:51] experience at the altar
[1:39:52] and go right back and live the exact
[1:39:54] same life
[1:39:56] there's got to be a change
[1:39:59] and it doesn't mean that we grow to full
[1:40:01] maturity at the altar there's room for
[1:40:03] growth we'll fall we'll make mistakes
[1:40:05] we'll do things that's wrong but the
[1:40:06] brooding of the holy ghost is bringing
[1:40:08] more life
[1:40:09] and more life and more life it's not
[1:40:11] just the experience but it's the
[1:40:13] experience that quickens the seed to
[1:40:15] life that'll bring forth the right
[1:40:17] evidence that'll live
[1:40:20] the life and follow after the word and
[1:40:23] receive
[1:40:24] all of the word not reject it because
[1:40:28] i've never heard that before
[1:40:29] is it true
[1:40:33] the holy ghost will lead and guide us
[1:40:35] into all
[1:40:36] truth
[1:40:40] you see so many things carried over
[1:40:44] from a previous age
[1:40:48] you think sometimes the greatest
[1:40:51] experience we can have
[1:40:54] is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:40:57] don't get me wrong i i'm not trying to
[1:40:59] say anything wrong just stick with me
[1:41:02] but the greatest experience we can have
[1:41:05] is when the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:41:07] quickens the seed in the soul
[1:41:10] not just the baptism the holy ghost but
[1:41:12] the baptism of holy ghost that quickens
[1:41:14] the life the seed that's in the soul
[1:41:16] that's the experience friends
[1:41:19] it's more than just an enthusiasm it's
[1:41:22] more than excitement
[1:41:23] the side effect can be thrilling and
[1:41:24] exciting and should be
[1:41:27] and it can come super dynamic and it can
[1:41:29] come super simple
[1:41:30] it doesn't matter whether it's super
[1:41:32] dynamic or super simple but there's got
[1:41:33] to be an experience where your candles
[1:41:35] lit
[1:41:36] and now something's burning light comes
[1:41:39] the light to make light manifest
[1:41:42] life comes to life zoe comes to zoe
[1:41:44] eagle comes the eagle male comes the
[1:41:46] female
[1:41:48] and something happens and quickens the
[1:41:51] life
[1:41:51] and from that point on everything begins
[1:41:54] to change in our life
[1:41:56] that's the thing that matters the most
[1:41:58] and that's what the spirit of god
[1:42:00] is moving upon in a service so many
[1:42:02] times in such a dynamic way
[1:42:04] it's hunting out the woman at the well
[1:42:09] maybe one maybe 50 maybe a hundred maybe
[1:42:12] the whole room
[1:42:13] i don't care how many of it is but if
[1:42:14] the spirit of god is moving that way
[1:42:16] he's looking for a seed
[1:42:19] and then the spirit of god continues to
[1:42:21] brood over all of those seeds
[1:42:23] for the rest of your life on this earth
[1:42:25] that spirit begins to move and it's
[1:42:27] moving in good ways and it's moving in
[1:42:29] difficult ways
[1:42:30] and it's moving in challenging
[1:42:32] circumstances moving in blessings
[1:42:34] but the spirit of god is moving what's
[1:42:36] it doing it's moving that seed into
[1:42:38] greater manifestation
[1:42:41] moving from the womb of a virgin into a
[1:42:43] baby moving the from a baby to a 12 year
[1:42:45] old in the temple
[1:42:46] moving from the 12 year old the temple
[1:42:48] to the one working a miracle
[1:42:50] at the at the wedding feast moving from
[1:42:52] there to the one who's rejected by the
[1:42:54] masses
[1:42:55] moving from there to one who's rejected
[1:42:57] by the sanhedrin rejected by the council
[1:42:59] rejected by his own disciples
[1:43:02] what is that the move of the spirits
[1:43:06] moving him to be hated of the nation
[1:43:08] despised
[1:43:11] and rejected what is it the moving of
[1:43:13] the spirit
[1:43:15] to what to bring the seed life
[1:43:18] into full manifestation how many of us
[1:43:22] want the moving of the spirit
[1:43:24] oh be careful what you raise your hands
[1:43:26] for because it might be rejection amen
[1:43:28] it might be political it might be
[1:43:30] friends and family and churches
[1:43:32] it might be your very closest friends
[1:43:34] leaving you and telling you you got it
[1:43:36] all wrong
[1:43:38] but the move of the spirit is moving the
[1:43:41] seed into greater manifestation
[1:43:43] drawing the life of what was in god's
[1:43:45] mind coming to manifestation
[1:43:47] and the spirit is cooing over the sea
[1:43:49] come a little higher
[1:43:50] come a little higher come a little
[1:43:52] higher
[1:43:54] oh i want a genuine move of the spirit i
[1:43:57] don't just want to walk out of here
[1:43:58] excited and say wasn't that a good
[1:44:00] service
[1:44:00] wasn't that glory hallelujah if it
[1:44:03] didn't change me into a greater
[1:44:04] manifestation
[1:44:05] i want to question why it happened
[1:44:09] because the moving of the spirit is to
[1:44:11] move us
[1:44:12] move us into a greater manifestation
[1:44:15] move the word into a greater display
[1:44:17] and if god's doing something wonderful
[1:44:19] i'm going to ask myself the question
[1:44:20] what's he trying to do in my life what
[1:44:23] is growing what's he taking off
[1:44:25] what's he building up what's he drawing
[1:44:27] out something's moving friends
[1:44:30] i think we can see worldwide the spirit
[1:44:33] of god is moving
[1:44:36] we may not fully comprehend all that's
[1:44:38] happening and we don't have to fully
[1:44:40] comprehend all that's happening
[1:44:43] all we have to know is one thing this is
[1:44:46] god
[1:44:48] and why is he allowing it why is it
[1:44:50] happening
[1:44:51] because he's got a bride that has to
[1:44:54] come into full manifestation
[1:44:57] why is the world turning upside down
[1:44:59] because he's got a bride
[1:45:00] that's got to come into full
[1:45:01] manifestation
[1:45:03] if he's got to tax the whole world
[1:45:07] if he's got to move from here to here if
[1:45:08] he's got to upturn communities
[1:45:11] if he's got if he got to change lives
[1:45:13] and make people uncomfortable
[1:45:17] praise the god he's going to get his
[1:45:20] life
[1:45:21] on full display and that
[1:45:24] is a move of the spirit
[1:45:27] it may feel good at times and to the
[1:45:30] flesh it may feel bad at times
[1:45:34] but what is it producing in the way of a
[1:45:37] life
[1:45:41] sometimes god has moved in my life in
[1:45:43] such a ways has
[1:45:44] crushed me and dropped me to my knees to
[1:45:47] weep all night long
[1:45:49] but guess what he was drawing this life
[1:45:52] higher
[1:45:54] the plant was growing the bride tree was
[1:45:56] coming a little higher
[1:45:59] and god was brooding in the church ages
[1:46:02] to bring that life that was in the root
[1:46:04] in the bride tree
[1:46:05] back back through luther back through
[1:46:08] wesley
[1:46:09] back through pentecost back into fruit
[1:46:11] again amen
[1:46:12] he's been drawing it drawing it drawing
[1:46:14] it drawing it drawing it
[1:46:17] but what he did for the ages he's doing
[1:46:19] for you personally
[1:46:21] drawing us and drawing us and drawing us
[1:46:25] till we can bear the same fruit that he
[1:46:28] bore
[1:46:30] remember brother benham said he and she
[1:46:34] is the tree of life male and female
[1:46:38] the two trees in the garden of eden
[1:46:42] male and female
[1:46:45] coming together sparking off life
[1:46:50] and the brooding of the holy ghost to
[1:46:52] draw that life
[1:46:54] into full manifestation that's the move
[1:46:57] of the spirit i'm looking for
[1:47:00] and that's the one i see god moving
[1:47:03] god bless you friends let's all stand
[1:47:05] we'll have to finish some other time
[1:47:08] praise god we trust the lord
[1:47:13] has god been moving in your life has the
[1:47:16] holy ghost been brooding over you
[1:47:19] i'd ask the question is the
[1:47:22] manifestation in your life greater now
[1:47:23] than it was a year ago
[1:47:26] is your confidence in god in his word is
[1:47:28] it higher or lower than it was
[1:47:32] what's he doing drawing the life
[1:47:36] out of the seed there's more to draw
[1:47:39] friends we haven't arrived yet
[1:47:41] let's not fool ourselves and think that
[1:47:42] we've made it to the destination
[1:47:44] there's more life to come out of this
[1:47:46] seed there's more faith amen
[1:47:48] there's more confidence in the word
[1:47:50] there's more of the very image of jesus
[1:47:52] christ to come forth
[1:47:53] there's more to come out of the seed i
[1:47:55] know there's more to come out of my seat
[1:47:57] so i know the spirit needs to keep
[1:47:58] cooing over me
[1:48:00] and drawing me up higher but oh god how
[1:48:03] we want him
[1:48:04] his spirit to move among us and move us
[1:48:06] into a greater manifestation
[1:48:09] i want to get to the place where i say
[1:48:11] god if you begin by your spirit begins
[1:48:13] to move me to calvary
[1:48:14] i want to walk
[1:48:18] i want to be so in tune with your
[1:48:19] program that if your spirit
[1:48:21] is moving me to calvary i want to move
[1:48:24] just like christ moved when he was here
[1:48:26] on earth when you begin to move by your
[1:48:28] spirit into a place that was
[1:48:30] uncomfortable
[1:48:30] into a place that was going to hurt into
[1:48:32] a place that that was not
[1:48:34] friendly when i feel your spirit moving
[1:48:37] lord
[1:48:38] and i saw you drawing god i want to have
[1:48:40] the kind of faith that i can move
[1:48:42] even if you lead me to calvary
[1:48:46] amen god is drawing his seat higher
[1:48:50] i'm so thankful we don't have anything
[1:48:53] to do with it just yield
[1:48:55] it's his program friends this is his
[1:48:58] design
[1:48:59] he wired you to sit there and nod your
[1:49:01] head and say amen
[1:49:04] he pre-programmed you to sit through a
[1:49:06] service like this
[1:49:07] and most people be like i want the
[1:49:09] blessings i want the money
[1:49:11] i want the prosperity i want the good
[1:49:13] living i want
[1:49:16] but you're you're sitting there and
[1:49:18] something inside of you
[1:49:19] when you can hear the word say but he
[1:49:21] might lead you to calvary you're like
[1:49:22] amen that's what i want
[1:49:26] where did that come from that's not the
[1:49:28] human part of you friends
[1:49:29] there's something inside that's saying i
[1:49:32] want what he wants
[1:49:33] i am programmed for this hour
[1:49:36] i am programmed to meet the challenge of
[1:49:38] the day and the spirit of god is here to
[1:49:40] make sure that the program keeps moving
[1:49:43] forward
[1:49:44] the spirit is moving this program
[1:49:46] forward and i'm more thankful for it
[1:49:48] than i've ever been for anything in my
[1:49:50] life
[1:49:50] i would have never requested
[1:49:52] circumstances like we have now
[1:49:54] would you well some of you
[1:49:58] maybe but i don't not me
[1:50:02] i would have never asked for
[1:50:04] circumstances like her coming next
[1:50:13] but god knows how to move his program
[1:50:16] alone
[1:50:18] and something inside of me can still say
[1:50:20] thank you lord
[1:50:22] something in me can still be excited
[1:50:24] about what he's doing
[1:50:26] when things are in turmoil things are
[1:50:28] uncomfortable and things may get more
[1:50:30] uncomfortable
[1:50:31] something inside still says i know
[1:50:33] you're moving god
[1:50:34] and i trust you and i want your way and
[1:50:37] i'm
[1:50:38] excited about the future when the future
[1:50:40] doesn't look exciting
[1:50:45] you know how many people are having
[1:50:49] meltdowns in their heart because it
[1:50:50] looks like the future is lost
[1:50:53] or changing or unknown
[1:50:57] but in the brine the future looks
[1:51:00] tumultuous
[1:51:02] and different and changing and inside of
[1:51:06] her she says
[1:51:07] amen something's changing
[1:51:10] something's shifting let it change more
[1:51:13] let it change and change and change and
[1:51:15] change and change
[1:51:16] until i change
[1:51:20] praise god keep moving lord keep moving
[1:51:24] keep drawing keep friends let's keep
[1:51:26] laying in the presence of the sun
[1:51:29] let him keep moving us in the greater
[1:51:30] manifestation
[1:51:32] let's close our eyes and pray lord jesus
[1:51:34] we thank you god
[1:51:37] we thank you for your word lord and how
[1:51:39] much it means to us
[1:51:41] and god we're looking for you to move
[1:51:43] lord
[1:51:44] and we're not just asking lord in
[1:51:46] fineries and
[1:51:48] things that are pleasant to the flesh
[1:51:51] but lord we really want you to move in
[1:51:52] our lives
[1:51:54] we're really asking lord that you would
[1:51:56] move and
[1:51:57] you'd be the bright powerful son that
[1:51:59] would draw us into a greater
[1:52:01] manifestation
[1:52:03] god we don't know lord in our human
[1:52:05] minds what to do and where to go
[1:52:08] but you've already put the life in the
[1:52:09] seed it's already there lord we know
[1:52:12] it's there
[1:52:13] we know lord your prophet said every
[1:52:16] apple that'll be on an apple tree was
[1:52:18] there in the seed
[1:52:19] and lord you've already ordained all the
[1:52:21] works that we'll do it's already in the
[1:52:23] seed
[1:52:24] everything you want us to do in this end
[1:52:26] time is already in the seed
[1:52:28] we just must draw from you lord and you
[1:52:31] must draw us in the manifestation
[1:52:34] god we know there's more there to be
[1:52:35] made manifest and we're trusting you to
[1:52:38] move over us and bring it into
[1:52:39] manifestation
[1:52:41] we love your god we're looking for a
[1:52:43] move of your spirit
[1:52:44] but not a pentecostal traditional idea
[1:52:47] of a move of your spirit
[1:52:48] but a real move of the spirit that moves
[1:52:51] us into manifestation of your word in a
[1:52:53] greater way
[1:52:54] and god if it's uncomfortable so be it
[1:52:56] we're still looking for a move of your
[1:52:58] spirit
[1:52:59] to move us in that portion for today to
[1:53:02] move us in the light of the hour
[1:53:03] to manifest that part that you've
[1:53:05] predestined for us to manifest
[1:53:08] and god if there's any here lord that
[1:53:10] has that little quivering down in the
[1:53:12] soul but
[1:53:13] know that they haven't sparked to life
[1:53:15] yet but there's something there lord
[1:53:17] that they know that's real
[1:53:18] god i pray that you would send the spark
[1:53:20] now in jesus christ's name lord
[1:53:23] light that candle spark it off lord and
[1:53:25] let it come to life and let there be a
[1:53:27] realization
[1:53:28] of a new birth take place lord i pray to
[1:53:31] give each child of god an experience
[1:53:33] lord of the new birth that they would
[1:53:35] experience making contact with you
[1:53:37] and that would be something fiery take
[1:53:39] place on the inside
[1:53:40] and that they would know it was real and
[1:53:42] everlasting
[1:53:43] and from there lord keep brooding and
[1:53:46] cooing and drawing us up higher
[1:53:48] that we can move into that very image of
[1:53:51] you
[1:53:51] to where she will be you
[1:53:56] we're asking for that to take place in
[1:53:58] our lives
[1:53:59] and we're knowing that it comes at a
[1:54:01] personal cost but lord
[1:54:03] as christ was willing in gethsemane to
[1:54:05] pay the price
[1:54:07] let us hit our gethsemane now and say
[1:54:09] we're willing to pay
[1:54:10] the price to let your word move in us
[1:54:13] a greater manifestation of your promised
[1:54:15] word
[1:54:16] we love you lord we ask that you'd keep
[1:54:18] your people that you would bless us
[1:54:20] to protect us and watch over us as we go
[1:54:22] in this world
[1:54:23] let us be bright in shining lights
[1:54:25] wherever we should go
[1:54:26] and let your life live through us we ask
[1:54:29] you to take preeminence among us
[1:54:31] and do with us as you wish in jesus
[1:54:33] christ's name we pray
