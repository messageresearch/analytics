TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and that's why so many times our works actually declare our level of repentance it's a it's a ratio and that's what he's saying bring forth Works meat are in same value or corresponding to repentance the change of mind and this explains so many things that we see all around us sometimes because you see sometimes people living in a in a in a compromised life and they're and they're in disobedient ience and continual Disobedience and you wonder why and you realize their mind really hasn't been made up for the message amen they might be going along they might be sympathetic but there's not a real true absolute knowing that this is absolutely nothing but the truth and you find works that are meat for that level of repentance yeah and sometimes you scratch your head and you wonder how can they continue to to choose this and how can they continue to go that and then you realize there's not been an ABS absolute change and understanding they're not really understanding what the message is the message is not a better teaching the message is not a clearer understanding all of those are included in the message but amen this message is none other than Jesus Christ completely unveiled amen I mean if we take it if we take the prophet of God as as as another church age messenger who just brought a reform and he's another preacher who's a little bit better than the other preacher and amen we got to realize this isn't just a good preacher these aren't just good sermons amen th this is the seventh angel amen this is the one in Revelation 10:7 this is the Elijah of Malachi 4 amen when when when when Jesus says of the Apostle uh uh of John or not not the Apostle when he says to John the Baptist he was more than a prophet you can take the same thing right to the prophet in our day he was more than a prophet amen he was a prophet to bring the Covenant amen he was the Fulfillment of Revelation 10:7 it was more more than just a prophet it was more than just a church age messenger yeah amen but you can see the level of works sometimes matches the level of repentance when we see brother brandom as a good man and and and he's a messenger and and but but you know he thought this and he did this and you know the Bible says this and he said that oh my goodness we're playing in dangerous games right now because we're belittling the the very voice that God used in this day amen the voice of God came through that man's vocal cords to give us the true interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication and when we start playing around with that it starts to show exactly where our repentance was we're not so sure we understand what this message is or who this messenger is and the works are meat to the repentance
