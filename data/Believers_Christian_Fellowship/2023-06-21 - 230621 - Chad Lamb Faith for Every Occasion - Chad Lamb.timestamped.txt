[16:53] substance of things hoped for the
[16:56] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it

[17:04] seats

[17:10] PowerPoint but Frank if you want but I
[17:11] had an announcement to make I didn't
[17:12] want to forget that uh brother Levi
[17:15] Yoder uh from over in near Holmes County
[17:18] he called me last week and I was First
[17:21] supposed to make an announcement on
[17:22] Sunday and I forgot but they're building
[17:24] a church over there that they're
[17:26] building a message church over there and
[17:27] they want it to evangelize to all the
[17:29] Amish in the area and then Gathering a
[17:32] small group of Believers and they're
[17:33] working on the church they already when
[17:35] I was there a few weeks ago they already
[17:36] had the foundation in they they got some
[17:39] of the poured walls done so they're
[17:41] having a work day this Saturday June
[17:43] 24th and they want to invite any of the
[17:45] brothers in the church that would like
[17:46] to come he called it a framing and
[17:48] Roofing Frolic so if you want to go on a
[17:50] framing and Roofing Frolic you're

[18:24] fellowship and see what the Lord is
[18:26] doing there is pretty amazing so all are
[18:28] welcome I also wanted to remind you of
[18:30] the bible study this Friday with Brother
[18:32] Kyle don't forget that and also I'd like
[18:35] to welcome home three young ladies Abby
[18:37] and Amber Levy and Brianna lamb we're
[18:39] glad that you're back from Germany they
[18:41] were going three weeks
[18:46] they were over visiting our sister
[18:48] Isabella and meeting some of the Saints
[18:50] over there seeing the size they had a
[18:51] good time the Lord took care of them but
[18:53] your seats have been holes empty gaps
[18:56] and we're glad that they're filled now
[18:57] amen God is good amen
[19:00] if we could look at this subject for
[19:03] tonight faith for every occasion
[19:06] this will tie in with the last the
[19:08] previous two Wednesdays we've had last
[19:10] Wednesday and then the Wednesday before
[19:11] that we've been talking kind of in the
[19:13] same thing along the same lines starting
[19:15] with faith is a mystery a couple weeks
[19:17] ago then then bearing his name last
[19:20] Wednesday and we want to continue on
[19:21] with this thought as the Lord will help
[19:23] us amen I put it in a PowerPoint because
[19:25] I want to go through several quotes and
[19:27] I want to do it quickly
[19:29] um to save time and I want everybody to
[19:30] be able to read it together but when we
[19:33] look at this scripture now Faith is the
[19:36] substance of things hoped for the
[19:37] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[19:40] the elders obtained a good report this
[19:42] is coming from Hebrews chapter 11 which
[19:45] is we it's called sometimes the faith
[19:47] chapter of the Bible or the hall of fame
[19:49] or the chapter of the Hebrews of the or
[19:52] the heroes of the faith and so we want
[19:55] to look at chapter 11. I'm going to
[19:56] spend a lot of time in chapter 11. so if
[19:58] you want to keep your Bibles open to
[20:00] that amen will spend some time in
[20:02] Hebrews chapter 11 this evening now it
[20:05] says faith is the sub substance it's
[20:07] interesting when I looked up this word
[20:08] substance in the concordance it's
[20:11] actually translated a few other places
[20:13] in the Bible as confidence uh or to be
[20:18] confident so faith is substance it's
[20:21] substance but it's also a confidence
[20:23] amen
[20:25] and and when you get into the definition
[20:27] in the concordance it says a setting or
[20:30] placing under a thing put under a
[20:33] substructure or a foundation and I love
[20:37] that definition amen so we know faith is
[20:39] a substance and we know what a substance
[20:41] is it's something firm it's something
[20:43] solid it's something real it's not
[20:45] imaginary it's not a figment of our
[20:47] imaginations amen but faith is an actual
[20:50] substance but it's also something you
[20:52] can have confidence in it's a
[20:54] substructure or a foundation amen
[20:57] praise be to God it's real amen but it's
[21:00] not just real it's foundational It's Got
[21:03] Roots amen you can you can you can you
[21:05] can Bank on it amen
[21:08] it also means another definition means
[21:10] that which has actual existence
[21:14] amen this is so many times amen faith is
[21:18] treated faith is treated as in something
[21:20] that's Whimsical or something that is a
[21:23] thought or something that just
[21:24] transpires in the mental realm remember
[21:27] that's not true Amen in the spiritual
[21:28] faith is substance faith is a
[21:31] substructure faith is a foundation Faith
[21:34] actually exists
[21:37] praise be to God
[21:40] and by it the elders obtained a good
[21:43] report
[21:44] it was this faith that the elders were
[21:46] this Foundation that they were on it was
[21:48] this faith that held them and
[21:50] undergirded them for byeth the elders
[21:52] obtained a good report this word report
[21:54] means witness or record or testimony
[21:58] so what gave our what gave him a good
[22:00] record or a good testimony a good
[22:02] witness amen it was their faith amen
[22:05] that's what we look at and that's what
[22:07] Hebrews 11 is all about
[22:09] so we'll get into that in a minute but I
[22:11] want to background that with a few
[22:12] quotes said how how would you ever know
[22:16] you touched him if there wasn't
[22:18] something that came back and told you
[22:20] see faith is not something it's not a
[22:23] myth faith is the substance of things
[22:24] hoped for the evidence that Something's
[22:27] Happened of Things Not Seen it's not
[22:29] just to make believe you say oh oh yes
[22:32] Hallelujah I got it that's been too much
[22:34] in Pentecostal people to begin with
[22:36] you're rejoicing about something that
[22:38] you don't have
[22:39] faith is absolutely a substance it's not
[22:43] a hope hope isn't faith is the substance
[22:46] of things hoped for but when Faith takes
[22:48] it it becomes the substance that you
[22:50] hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen
[22:53] amen
[22:55] so he goes on to say there's only one
[22:57] thing you have to do is to appropriate
[22:59] that faith and that faith is something
[23:01] that you know not something you plunder
[23:04] around plunder at and guess at you know
[23:07] it something happens now Through the
[23:09] Ages people has rested upon this
[23:12] amen when he's when he's when he's going
[23:14] into this kind of Faith this isn't the
[23:16] kind of Faith where we're probing at
[23:19] something or trying amen there's a human
[23:21] faith and brother Branham didn't even
[23:22] call human Faith bad
[23:25] he said there's human Faith he said
[23:26] that's good it's like an acorn like a
[23:28] seed plant it until it becomes the
[23:30] perfect Faith the real thing
[23:32] so not even your human faith is bad but
[23:34] you can't rely on human Faith it's got
[23:36] to go to the next stage amen it's got to
[23:38] come to perfect Faith to actual faith
[23:40] not to a probing not to a hoping not to
[23:43] a considering but it's got to come to
[23:45] that actual reality of faith
[23:48] praise God and that Through the Ages is
[23:51] what people has rested on
[23:53] something that was real something God
[23:55] actually told them something that was
[23:57] that was real that was a substance that
[23:58] they could base their life on that that
[24:00] would would come to pass
[24:04] he says anything is by faith faith is
[24:07] not something that you work up Faith is
[24:09] something that you have
[24:12] I love that faith is not something that
[24:15] you work up Faith in it faith is
[24:17] something that you have
[24:19] amen it's not something that we're
[24:22] trying to to press into
[24:25] it's not something that we're trying to
[24:27] make happen faith is actually something
[24:30] you have if you can turn with me to the
[24:32] Book of Romans we're going to turn to
[24:34] the scripture and come right back to
[24:35] Hebrews uh let's go to the Book of
[24:37] Romans chapter 12.
[24:48] Romans chapter 12 verse 3.
[24:57] for I say through the grace given unto
[24:59] me to every man that is among you not to
[25:01] think of himself more highly than he
[25:03] ought to think but to think soberly
[25:05] according as God hath dealt to every man
[25:07] The Measure of Faith
[25:09] amen where did your faith come from
[25:12] God has dealt that Measure of Faith to
[25:15] you that's your faith not the
[25:17] intellectual side but the measure that
[25:19] he's measured out to you in portion to
[25:21] you that's the faith of God that's been
[25:23] measured to you and so we shouldn't
[25:25] think of ourselves more highly than we
[25:26] ought to or be puffed up about anything
[25:28] amen because God dealt to us this
[25:30] Measure of Faith it's not something I
[25:33] worked into I climbed the ladder and
[25:35] attained I went and grabbed no God in
[25:37] His Grace has given a measure of his own
[25:40] faith unto me
[25:42] praise God
[25:43] and so let's go back to Hebrews chapter
[25:45] 11.
[25:47] because like I said that's where we're
[25:48] going to spend the majority of our time
[25:50] this evening Lord willing
[25:52] and let's keep looking at this Ephesians
[25:55] 2 8 says for by Grace you are saved
[25:57] through faith and not not of yourselves
[25:58] it is the gift of God
[26:01] he goes on to say you can only have
[26:03] faith as God gives you faith faith is a
[26:06] gift of God ever how religious you may
[26:09] be yet it must you must have faith and
[26:11] your faith can only rest if you're a
[26:13] Christian upon the proven word of God
[26:15] amen so now we know that we ought not to
[26:18] be puffed up we're not to think more
[26:19] highly of ourselves than we ought to
[26:21] because God has dealt to every every
[26:23] believer a Measure of Faith amen and
[26:25] that faith is in you praise God it's in
[26:28] your soul and so what we need amen is we
[26:32] need the way for the word to Quicken
[26:34] that Faith inside and bring that Faith
[26:36] to the Forefront and bring that faith
[26:37] into action
[26:39] amen so it's not something we need to
[26:42] pretend or we need to put on
[26:44] it's not something we need I mean
[26:47] sometimes I think sometimes I know I
[26:49] have in the past I won't say anything
[26:51] about anybody else but I in the past I
[26:53] have tried I've had tried to have faith
[26:56] by having a a speech that that emulates
[27:00] faith
[27:01] I've tried to talk my way into a bluff
[27:03] my way into it act like I had a faith
[27:06] and in my heart there's questions all
[27:08] the time
[27:09] and there's nothing wrong with having a
[27:11] positive confession but I'm not talking
[27:13] about just having a positive confession
[27:14] amen I'm talking about so many times I
[27:17] would try to speak more bold and and and
[27:19] the less confidence I had the more bold
[27:22] I would be and the louder I would get
[27:24] and the more
[27:26] but I was only covering for a lack of
[27:29] something
[27:30] else but the reality is amen God comes
[27:33] by his grace and by Revelation he opens
[27:36] the word to us and he draws out of us
[27:38] the measure of faith that he's put
[27:39] inside of us and that faith is a reality
[27:41] amen and you can't talk your way into it
[27:44] Bluff your way into it amen you just you
[27:46] just have faith and you believe your way
[27:48] into it
[27:50] praise be the gone
[27:53] when you go and you look through Hebrews
[27:55] 11 and not just in Hebrews 11 but you
[27:57] look through the Old Testament and you
[27:58] look through the Saints and you look
[28:00] through how God dealt with them amen it
[28:02] wasn't bluffing never worked amen
[28:04] putting on never worked amen this was a
[28:06] reality in their lives this was
[28:08] something and there wasn't something
[28:09] they just went and found one day it was
[28:11] God who came to them and God would open
[28:13] the word and God would give his plan and
[28:15] God would tell them who they are and God
[28:17] would give instructions and they would
[28:18] have a capacity within them to receive
[28:21] it from God and believe it amen where
[28:23] did that come from it was a measure of
[28:25] God given to them
[28:27] and it was real and it was tangible and
[28:29] it moved them and kept them through all
[28:31] kinds of dangers and all kinds of
[28:33] circumstances and that Faith was a
[28:35] reality that held them in the face of
[28:37] everything else
[28:39] but it wasn't something they talked into
[28:41] amen it wasn't something they worked up
[28:43] it wasn't something that they all got
[28:45] together and now you can't produce it
[28:48] that way
[28:50] praise God
[28:53] he goes on to say listen I'm going to
[28:55] say something look faith is unconscious
[28:58] I love this quote
[29:01] faith is unconscious you believe it I've
[29:04] learned that in years of travel around
[29:05] the world and meeting the peoples of all
[29:07] different walks but faith is unconscious
[29:09] you got faith and don't even know it
[29:12] that's right you say if I have faith I
[29:14] should know it because it's a knowing
[29:15] amen there's something in you amen that
[29:18] God has measured to you that sometimes
[29:21] until the hour of need you haven't even
[29:22] fully explored it
[29:28] and faith is unconscious you got it you
[29:31] don't even know it
[29:34] so many times we're we're asking for
[29:36] something and looking for something
[29:37] that's already inside
[29:40] the faith to believe is already with us
[29:42] amen we just need God to help us Purge
[29:46] and the word to purge all the doubts and
[29:48] unbelief out of the way so the channel
[29:50] can be open for Faith to express itself
[29:56] he says here it is
[29:58] here it's you using it he's in the
[30:01] prayer line now he's in discernment and
[30:02] he's beginning to talk about the gift
[30:04] that's within him but he's talking about
[30:05] the congregation now it's you using it
[30:08] it's not me it just flows through
[30:10] because it's just a gift to relax
[30:12] yourself take it out of the human gear
[30:14] that God can gear himself with it and
[30:16] say things now your own faith you don't
[30:18] realize that you're doing that yourself
[30:21] your own Faith is doing that and brother
[30:24] bear said and now the discernment's
[30:26] coming and things are happening and he's
[30:28] saying it's your own and you don't even
[30:30] realize it's your faith doing that it
[30:32] wasn't the faith of the man and the
[30:33] platform the man and the platform was
[30:34] relaxing himself so that God could come
[30:37] down and gear himself into the gift and
[30:39] it was the actual faith of the people
[30:41] that was pulling discernment out
[30:44] brother Ben says in 1964 on the message
[30:47] calling Jesus on the scene he says and
[30:49] you believe that God can tell me who you
[30:51] are would it make you believe you're Mrs
[30:54] Martin if that's right raise your hand
[30:56] see you just have faith don't doubt have
[30:59] faith now what did she touch I want to
[31:01] ask the audience what did she touch
[31:03] there is a woman with her there is a
[31:06] woman with her right hand up in mine too
[31:08] before God see she touched something
[31:11] just a simple little woman it actually
[31:13] to tell you the truth now you see if
[31:16] this is the truth it surprised her
[31:19] she didn't know she had that much faith
[31:23] faith is not something you manufacture
[31:25] it's something you have
[31:28] she was surprised even right now the
[31:30] woman feels different than what she did
[31:32] a few minutes ago she knows something
[31:34] has happened to her
[31:37] brother bam said now it wasn't it wasn't
[31:40] the prophet of God that brought that
[31:41] discernment on the scene it was the
[31:43] faith of that woman sitting there crying
[31:45] out to God Amen that that brought the
[31:47] discernment and she was surprised
[31:49] herself she didn't know she had that
[31:52] much faith
[31:53] remember that it's not something you
[31:55] manufacture is something you have she
[31:56] had it she didn't know it she was crying
[31:58] out to God and her faith moved God
[32:01] through a gift to speak back to her and
[32:03] she didn't realize it was her faith
[32:05] doing that
[32:08] praise be to God
[32:10] thank God for that
[32:13] this is what he says in super sign
[32:16] now then you sat there and you claimed
[32:18] to be a Christian with faith then your
[32:19] own faith goes to the throne of God and
[32:22] touches the high priest and he turns
[32:24] back through a gift and answers right
[32:26] back to show that he's the same God that
[32:28] was that's in me and in you he's the
[32:31] same God
[32:33] oh my goodness I don't want to leave
[32:35] that back in discernment 60 years ago I
[32:38] want to bring that right here today this
[32:40] evening amen because now you sit here in
[32:42] your own faith your faith goes through
[32:44] the Throne of God touches the high
[32:46] priest he turns back through a gift in
[32:48] the pulpit and answers right back
[32:51] how many times do we see him do that
[32:53] amen I've sat in my seat right down here
[32:55] and saw a man in the Pulpit repeat back
[32:58] conversations that I've had what is that
[33:00] amen that's not the faith of the man
[33:03] preaching the man preaching has a gift
[33:04] amen it's the faith of the people
[33:07] pulling it down
[33:10] sometimes we didn't even realize amen
[33:12] has it ever surprised you
[33:16] has it ever surprised you to hear from
[33:18] the pulpit your private conversation
[33:20] with your wife or with a friend or
[33:21] something you talked about the night
[33:22] before or a question you asked God has
[33:25] that ever surprised you hey well here's
[33:27] the surprise that wasn't the man in the
[33:29] pool but that was you doing that that
[33:30] was the faith inside of you not a
[33:32] make-believe not a put on are you
[33:34] surprised that you have that much faith
[33:37] what a pleasant surprise
[33:40] the fine that is that's the faith amen
[33:43] that touches the Throne of God pulls God
[33:46] back down through a gift to speak back
[33:48] amen what we have need of my what is
[33:51] that that's God's faith that's the
[33:52] measure of faith that he's given to each
[33:54] one of us
[33:56] amen we're exercising that faith and
[33:58] sometimes we don't even realize how
[34:00] powerful it is and all sudden something
[34:02] happens in the service and it almost
[34:03] takes our breath away and it leaves us
[34:05] astonished and where did that come from
[34:07] oh God is amazing God isn't amazing he's
[34:09] an amazing God that can measure to you a
[34:11] measure of faith that will operate the
[34:13] gift that way
[34:17] amen
[34:19] thank God for the reality of faith
[34:23] and and what's surprising sometimes is
[34:26] is it's not it's surprising because it's
[34:31] so unconscious
[34:34] it wasn't sometimes it's not even that
[34:37] you're asking God to speak through the
[34:39] minister you're just you just have a
[34:41] question in your heart
[34:42] you have a need you had a conversation
[34:44] and you didn't even end the conversation
[34:46] with let's see what he says tomorrow no
[34:48] you just had a conversation
[34:51] but you're a child of Faith you're a
[34:53] child of God and it's moving in The
[34:56] Invisible Realms with God and it's
[34:57] bringing back answers and his meeting
[34:59] needs in his what is that that's that's
[35:01] you doing that that's me doing that when
[35:04] I'm in my seat
[35:06] and so that's faith and so faith is
[35:08] operating all the time amen and it takes
[35:10] us by surprise because we didn't go try
[35:13] to have faith and go try to make Faith
[35:15] operate Faith was just operating
[35:18] it's what he means by its unconscious
[35:20] it's there it's within us
[35:22] it's regulating Our Lives it's moving us
[35:25] it's changing the way we think all the
[35:27] time
[35:30] praise God
[35:32] we go back to Hebrews 11 verse 4 says by
[35:35] faith Abel
[35:38] offered unto God a more excellent
[35:40] sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained
[35:42] witness that he was righteous
[35:44] God testifying as a guest and by it he
[35:47] being dead yet speaketh how did Abel
[35:49] offer more excellent Sacrifice by faith
[35:51] we know we've been through this a lot
[35:53] but I just want to lay this in in this
[35:55] teaching he says enable rolled him up a
[35:58] rock and made him a church or worship
[36:00] place but when Abel come he by faith
[36:02] faith isn't something that's imaginary
[36:04] thing I want you to get it faith is a
[36:07] direct revelation
[36:09] Abel wasn't imagining anything he wasn't
[36:12] just trying things out amen it struck
[36:14] him what was needed amen and when it
[36:17] struck him it moved him into action his
[36:19] action was dictated by what he believed
[36:21] amen and what he believed was by
[36:23] revelation
[36:26] see if you can only accept Christ as
[36:29] your savior by intellectual you haven't
[36:32] got it yet
[36:33] you cannot say that Jesus is a Christ
[36:35] until the Holy Spirit has revealed it to
[36:37] you see intellectual Faith or if I could
[36:39] only get that one point right now to go
[36:41] down home in every heart I'm thankful
[36:44] for this place position right now see oh
[36:46] if you can only see this you'll see the
[36:48] greatest thing you've seen in years look
[36:51] not because I'm standing here saying it
[36:53] but if you can understand how it is that
[36:55] faith is not something mentally
[36:57] perceived
[37:00] that's how faith can be direct in your
[37:01] life and you're not even aware what's
[37:03] happening it's Faith directing your
[37:05] steps it's Faith guarding your con
[37:07] conversation it's faith
[37:09] it's not something mentally perceived
[37:13] but it is a revelation a revelation of
[37:16] God by faith not intellectual but by his
[37:19] heart
[37:21] it wasn't something able mentally
[37:23] conjured up
[37:25] it wasn't something that he was able to
[37:27] press into it was something amen Faith
[37:31] gave a revelation Revelation is Faith
[37:33] and it unlocked a something in Abel's
[37:36] heart and Abel knew what to do
[37:38] and that Faith moved him into action
[37:40] amen
[37:42] no matter how much Cain wanted it he
[37:45] couldn't have it
[37:47] because Cain didn't have that deposit
[37:52] Cain couldn't push his way into it God
[37:54] gave him away and that way was just to
[37:56] repeat just to emulate just to copy what
[37:58] was done amen he gave him away but he
[38:01] couldn't come by revelation
[38:03] because he didn't have anything to
[38:06] believe with
[38:09] Abel did and it was there
[38:12] it was in him
[38:14] amen he just had to wait for Faith to
[38:18] grab a hold of the answer
[38:20] and then it was real
[38:22] it wasn't a put on it wasn't an effort
[38:24] it wasn't uh him piecing things together
[38:27] and creating a formula two plus two and
[38:29] this and that and I think it's this that
[38:31] wasn't it
[38:33] it was something that unlocked to him
[38:35] and he knew what God wanted
[38:37] and it moved him in the action
[38:40] further than going further down in
[38:42] Hebrews Hebrews 11 5 by faith Enoch was
[38:45] translated that he should not see death
[38:47] how was Enoch translated by faith
[38:50] amen
[38:52] by faith Enoch was translated they
[38:54] should not see death and was not found
[38:55] because God had translated him for
[38:58] before his translation he had this
[38:59] testimony that he pleased God but
[39:02] without faith it is impossible to please
[39:04] him for he that cometh to God must
[39:06] believe that he is and that he is a
[39:08] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[39:11] him so without faith it is impossible to
[39:14] please God
[39:16] so Enoch had this testimony before he
[39:18] was translated that he pleased God Amen
[39:20] and you you can go and say well what did
[39:22] Enoch do that pleased God Amen it wasn't
[39:25] so much Enoch's actions it was Enoch's
[39:28] faith
[39:29] but Enoch's Faith put him in action
[39:32] Enoch's Works were based on his faith
[39:35] they were a product of what he believed
[39:37] amen it wasn't uh it wasn't a series of
[39:40] works that could get him to the Rapture
[39:42] it wasn't a series of works that could
[39:43] please God
[39:45] the same things today there's not a
[39:47] series of things that we can do to
[39:49] please God Amen there's only one way to
[39:51] please God and that's by faith
[39:53] amen but if I will please him Jesus said
[39:56] if you love me keep my Commandments amen
[39:58] why will I keep his Commandments because
[40:00] of the Revelation that's in my heart in
[40:02] the faith amen and by faith my faith
[40:05] moves me into action amen and those
[40:07] works are pleasing to the Lord by faith
[40:10] or I can just copy
[40:12] and try
[40:14] but that's not going to work without
[40:15] faith it is impossible to please God I
[40:18] love this because without faith it is
[40:20] impossible to please him but he's given
[40:22] to every man every Every Man a Measure
[40:24] of Faith amen he's given me the tool
[40:26] that I need to please him
[40:29] because I couldn't get it on myself I
[40:31] couldn't mine it up I couldn't dig it
[40:32] out I I couldn't Discover it how could I
[40:35] get it but he's given to every man a
[40:36] Measure of Faith and without faith it's
[40:38] impossible to please him
[40:40] oh it makes you so thankful
[40:43] at the end of the day it makes you so
[40:46] thankful
[40:49] now I don't want to go to this yet stop
[40:52] all right let's go to take our Bibles to
[40:55] Hebrews we're going to read through it
[40:56] together now
[40:58] we're going to start at verse 7. Hebrews
[41:00] 11 and 7.
[41:04] by faith Noah being warned of God of
[41:06] things not seen as yet moved with fear
[41:08] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[41:11] house by the which he condemned the
[41:13] world and became heir of the
[41:14] righteousness which is by faith
[41:16] so by faith Noah was warned of God moved
[41:20] with fear prepared an ark
[41:22] by faith Abraham when he was called to
[41:25] go out into a place which he should have
[41:27] to receive for an inheritance obeyed and
[41:29] he went out not knowing whether he went
[41:32] by faith he sojourned in the land of
[41:34] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[41:36] in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob that
[41:38] heirs with him of the same promise
[41:40] for he looked for a city which hath
[41:42] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[41:44] gone
[41:45] through faith also Sarah herself
[41:47] received strength to conceive seed and
[41:49] was delivered of a child when she was
[41:50] past age because she judged him faithful
[41:53] who promised
[41:56] it's amazing how all this was done by
[41:58] faith
[42:01] but what kind of Faith this this reality
[42:03] faith
[42:05] Abraham by faith
[42:08] so adjourned in a strange country
[42:11] well how did Abraham know to go to a
[42:13] strange country God came to him
[42:16] and God told him leave this land and go
[42:19] to a land I show you
[42:21] it was gone it wasn't as all like he was
[42:24] all by himself and just sitting there
[42:26] one day and he worked up some faith and
[42:28] by faith he said you know what I think I
[42:30] should leave here no it was something in
[42:33] him that could believe the word of God
[42:35] and when we look at every one of these
[42:37] amen it wasn't that any of these people
[42:39] were super human beings with
[42:41] Supernatural this and that amen they
[42:43] were common ordinary people but they had
[42:46] a Measure of Faith deposited into their
[42:48] soul a capacity to believe the word of
[42:50] God and God he would see to it that each
[42:53] one of them would receive a portion of
[42:55] that word for their day God came to them
[42:58] and gave them the word amen and already
[43:00] in them there was the ability to believe
[43:02] that word
[43:04] amen so they become to us Heroes of the
[43:08] faith amen who's the real hero of the
[43:10] faith God Almighty is the hero of the
[43:12] faith he's the one who's been working on
[43:14] both ends all along he's my hero of the
[43:17] faith because if I have faith it's a
[43:19] gift from him amen if I have the ability
[43:21] to believe and what would I believe in
[43:22] if he hadn't come and gave me the word
[43:24] for the hour
[43:26] what would Noah believe in he has Faith
[43:28] so what does he believe in what does he
[43:30] do amen God has to come and tell him
[43:32] what to do and when God tells him what
[43:34] to do he's given him a Measure of Faith
[43:36] by which he can do it amen making him
[43:39] amen worthy to be in Hebrews chapter 11
[43:42] and be considered amen one of the
[43:44] fathers of faith
[43:46] oh praise be to God I'm so glad God had
[43:49] a plan before the foundation in the
[43:51] world and he had a mystery in the back
[43:52] part of his mind and I was part of that
[43:54] mystery amen just like Noah was part of
[43:56] that mystery and Enoch was part of that
[43:58] mystery I was part of that mystery one
[44:00] of those attributes and because of that
[44:02] there's something in me to believe with
[44:06] but even with that I need the
[44:08] counterpart which is his word
[44:11] I need his word and I need the faith to
[44:13] believe the word
[44:18] God is the hero of the faith
[44:24] oh we can say oh we're the Bride of the
[44:27] end time we're exalted to a position
[44:28] there's no pressure like this pressure
[44:30] is no age like this age there's no
[44:32] there's nobody who's overcome like we
[44:34] have to overcome don't think more highly
[44:36] of yourself
[44:37] than you ought to for God has given you
[44:39] the measure of Faith to overcome Satan's
[44:41] eaten in this day
[44:43] God has given you and I a Measure of
[44:45] Faith and on top of that he's given us
[44:47] the word to overcome by
[44:49] so now we're not wandering in darkness
[44:51] wondering what do we do how would Noah
[44:53] save his household on that day he had
[44:55] nothing to save him by he had no idea he
[44:58] couldn't exercise his faith and tell the
[45:00] revelation of the word came and then he
[45:02] could exercise his faith
[45:04] what was Abraham going to do amen being
[45:07] down with idol worshipers being stuck in
[45:10] the land of the Chaldeans what was he
[45:11] going to do it was God who told him to
[45:13] come out and we realized he didn't even
[45:14] do a marvelous job at that
[45:17] he took his dad along and then he took a
[45:19] lot along and he didn't do the separate
[45:21] amen but it was God who was rich in
[45:23] Mercy who kept leading him along the way
[45:25] amen he kept giving him more instruction
[45:27] and more instruction and when Abraham
[45:29] didn't follow the instructions then he
[45:30] changed the circumstances around him to
[45:32] push him in all the way into obedience
[45:36] not because Abraham was superhuman in
[45:39] himself
[45:41] what made him superhuman was the deposit
[45:44] of the sea Gene of God
[45:49] says through faith also Sarah herself
[45:51] received strength to conceive
[45:53] Sarah was unbelieving disbelieving the
[45:56] promise all the way along
[46:00] we went through this a couple weeks ago
[46:02] she was doubting she was
[46:04] misunderstanding she she believed the
[46:06] promise but she didn't believe herself
[46:08] part of the promise
[46:10] she believed that yeah you have a son
[46:12] but now let's take Hagar and let's do it
[46:13] that way because I can't
[46:16] and then when God comes in flesh now he
[46:18] begins to uh give her the promise amen
[46:22] and she laughs
[46:24] disbelieving
[46:26] but oh thank God he's not going to
[46:29] change his plan
[46:31] he's not going to stop what does he do
[46:33] he comes to Sarah
[46:36] and when he comes to Sarah he gives her
[46:38] a revelation that unlocks the faith in
[46:40] her heart and by faith she receives
[46:42] strength to conceive
[46:46] all these Heroes of the faith if it
[46:49] wasn't for God they would be zeros
[46:54] if it wasn't for something that was
[46:56] already in them and the plan God already
[46:58] had they wouldn't be the heroes of the
[47:00] faith
[47:02] same thing for you and I if it wasn't
[47:03] God already had a plan and put something
[47:05] in us we would be nothing
[47:09] and so this Faith Can't Be A worked up
[47:12] religious
[47:13] it's got to be a reality
[47:19] let's keep on going
[47:21] there's a certain thought I'm just
[47:23] wanting to share
[47:24] we're working our way to it verse 12.
[47:27] therefore spring there even of one and
[47:29] him as good as dead so many as the stars
[47:32] of the sky and the multitude and as the
[47:34] sand which is by the seashore
[47:35] innumerable
[47:37] these all died in faith not having
[47:40] received the promises but having seen
[47:43] them afar off and were persuaded of them
[47:44] and embracing them and confessed that
[47:46] they were strangers and pilgrims on the
[47:49] Earth
[47:50] it's this it's this sentence this first
[47:54] part in verse 13 that began to Intrigue
[47:56] me
[47:57] these all died in faith
[48:01] you mean they died in faith
[48:04] I thought Faith would keep me from dying
[48:07] no they died in faith
[48:11] they died you can die in faith
[48:16] because until it comes time for the
[48:18] translation amen all will go by the way
[48:20] of the grave
[48:23] they died in faith
[48:27] say it this way and just stay with me
[48:30] Faith doesn't always deliver
[48:35] sometimes Faith takes you through
[48:40] they died in faith
[48:43] and when they die in faith they'll
[48:45] resurrect in faith
[48:51] let's go to verse 17.
[48:56] by faith Abraham when he was tried
[48:58] offered up Isaac and he that had
[49:00] received the promises offered up his
[49:02] only begotten son whom it was said that
[49:04] in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[49:06] counting that God was able to raise him
[49:08] up even from the dead
[49:10] and whence also he received him in a
[49:12] figure
[49:13] by faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
[49:15] concerning things to come by faith Jacob
[49:17] when he was dying bless both the sons of
[49:19] Joseph in worship leaning upon the top
[49:21] of the staff
[49:23] by faith Joseph when he died made
[49:25] mention of The Parting of the children
[49:26] of Israel and gave commandment
[49:28] concerning his bones
[49:30] by faith Moses when he was born was hid
[49:32] three months of his parents because they
[49:34] saw he was a proper child they were not
[49:36] afraid of the king's commandment by
[49:38] faith Moses when he was come to years
[49:40] refused to be called the son of
[49:41] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[49:43] suffer Affliction with the peoples of
[49:45] people of God than to enjoy the pleasure
[49:47] of sin for a season esteeming the
[49:49] reproach of Christ greater riches than
[49:51] the treasure in Egypt for he had respect
[49:53] unto the recompense of the reward
[49:55] by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing
[49:57] the Wrath of the king for he endured is
[49:59] seeing him who is invisible through
[50:01] faith he kept the Passover and the
[50:04] sprinkling of blood lest he had lest he
[50:06] that destroyed the firstborn should
[50:08] touch them
[50:09] by faith they passed through the Red Sea
[50:12] as by dry land which the Egyptians is
[50:14] saying to do were drowned by faith the
[50:17] walls of Jericho fell down after they
[50:19] were compassed about seven days by faith
[50:21] the Harlot Rahab perished not with them
[50:24] that believed not when she had received
[50:26] the spies with peace
[50:28] and what shall I more say for the time
[50:30] shall fail to for me to tell of Gideon
[50:33] and of Barack and of Samson of jephthah
[50:37] of David also and Samuel and of the
[50:40] prophets who through faith subdued
[50:42] kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained
[50:44] promises stop the mouths of lions quench
[50:47] the violence of fire escape the edge of
[50:49] the sword but of weakness were made
[50:51] strong waxed Valiant and fight turned to
[50:54] flight the armies of the aliens
[50:56] women received their dead raised to life
[50:59] again and others were tortured not
[51:01] accepting Deliverance
[51:03] that's when I stopped
[51:05] right there
[51:08] all of a sudden inside my heart goes
[51:13] they quenched the Flames stopped the
[51:16] mouths of lions turned to flight the
[51:17] enemies women received their Dead Alive
[51:20] they they overcame and overcame and
[51:23] overcame and saved from a flood and and
[51:25] and walked through the Red Sea and knock
[51:29] down the walls of Jericho
[51:32] all by faith
[51:35] is that right
[51:36] all of these things were done by faith
[51:40] but the rest of this list is also done
[51:43] by faith
[51:48] let's read verse 35 again women receive
[51:50] their dead race to life again how by
[51:52] faith and others were tortured not
[51:55] accepting Deliverance
[51:57] how by faith
[52:01] I thought perfect Faith would deliver me
[52:03] from torture
[52:06] no perfect faith will keep you
[52:09] through the torture
[52:15] you see how this is not Prosperity
[52:16] preaching
[52:18] this is not Pentecostalism
[52:20] this is real
[52:23] real Faith working in real life
[52:28] will Faith deliver you nothing else will
[52:31] will Faith through the impossible
[52:33] nothing else will will and faith move
[52:35] mountains absolutely nothing else will
[52:39] but that same Faith that'll move them
[52:40] out in the same Faith though to put
[52:42] armies to fly the same thing that will
[52:44] brush back the flames in a fire the same
[52:46] thing faith will shut a lion's mouth the
[52:48] same Faith that'll keep You Through
[52:50] Torture not accepting Deliverance
[52:56] that they might obtain a better
[52:58] Resurrection
[52:59] and others had trial of cruel mockings
[53:02] and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and
[53:06] imprisonment
[53:07] they were stoned they were Saun asunder
[53:10] were tempted were slain with the sword
[53:13] they wandered about in sheepskins and
[53:16] goat skins being destitute and afflicted
[53:19] tormented
[53:21] how did they do this by faith
[53:25] you mean by faith I am afflicted
[53:28] by faith you can be afflicted
[53:32] I was always taught that perfect Faith
[53:34] would keep me from anything bad ever
[53:36] happening to me and I'd be healed and
[53:38] I'd be delivered and ever
[53:40] that's true
[53:43] but sometimes that same faith that
[53:45] they'll deliver you
[53:47] that will deliver you from torture that
[53:50] will deliver you from Affliction that'll
[53:51] deliver you from being destitute amen
[53:53] that same faith that will bring that is
[53:55] the same faith that will carry you
[53:57] through it and it delivers you a
[53:58] different way
[54:00] it delivers you from falling into
[54:02] unbelief it delivers you from falling
[54:04] away it delivers you from doubting God
[54:06] it delivers you from walking away
[54:10] when everything goes wrong amen there's
[54:12] a faith that holds amen and that's a
[54:15] measure that's given by God
[54:21] oh when I read through this all of a
[54:23] sudden something inside of me just
[54:25] begins to Quake amen because it wasn't
[54:27] what we read through the Bible and we
[54:29] see deliverance and miracles but it
[54:32] wasn't all deliverance and miracles amen
[54:34] amen sometimes amen God Amen had to
[54:38] display himself in all kinds of forms
[54:40] and his attribute in all kinds of ways
[54:42] and his children had faith for every
[54:45] obstacle they had faith for every trial
[54:47] and had faith for every occasion
[54:50] they had faith for the deliverance and
[54:52] they had faith when they went through
[54:53] the fire
[54:55] they had faith for both why because they
[54:58] never quit believing they never doubted
[54:59] God they never doubted his promise they
[55:01] never doubted his word
[55:03] they died in faith
[55:06] amen
[55:08] let's keep reading read this again they
[55:10] wandered about sheepskins and ghost
[55:11] skins being destitute Afflicted
[55:13] tormented of whom the world was not
[55:16] worthy
[55:17] they wandered in deserts how by faith
[55:20] and in mountains and in dens the caves
[55:23] of the earth and these all having
[55:25] obtained a good report through faith
[55:27] received not the promise God having
[55:29] provided some better thing for us a day
[55:31] without us should not be made perfect
[55:35] praise God
[55:38] they obtained a good report through
[55:40] faith
[55:42] they obtained a good report although
[55:43] they were afflicted
[55:45] but to God they had a good report
[55:48] man may not have understood their
[55:50] Affliction and their destitute in their
[55:51] sheepskins and and goat skins and living
[55:54] in caves and then to the rocks it looked
[55:56] like they were Outcast it looked like
[55:57] they were not blessed it looked like
[55:59] they were the ones that God wasn't
[56:00] blessing amen but they obtained a good
[56:03] report by faith because Faith would not
[56:05] let them leave the promising word of God
[56:07] for nothing for no circumstance for no
[56:10] situation would they leave the word
[56:12] and I want to ask you what word did they
[56:15] believe when you read through this their
[56:17] stories this story span hundreds and
[56:19] thousands of years when you read through
[56:21] the stories of the Bible amen they
[56:23] didn't all believe the same thing but
[56:24] they all believed the same thing
[56:27] one believed in an ark one believed in a
[56:30] promised son one believed she was the
[56:32] wound that God was going to use one
[56:34] believed God would keep him through the
[56:35] fire one believed what were they all
[56:37] believing they were all believing the
[56:39] word for their day
[56:41] every one of them believes something
[56:43] different but they all believed the same
[56:44] thing and they were all believing
[56:46] present tense truth
[56:50] and that faith that they had gave them a
[56:54] good report
[56:55] not just the good report was not like a
[56:59] report card that you got you got an A
[57:02] for overcoming you got an A for miracles
[57:04] you got an A for he
[57:08] can you get an A for suffering
[57:11] can that be on the card too
[57:15] can we have an a for suffering
[57:18] and not sending with our mouths
[57:23] can I get an A for affliction
[57:26] enduring affliction
[57:28] what about cruel mockings
[57:34] so far that that's not my grade I'm
[57:36] working my way up I'm somewhere in the F
[57:39] trying to get the D range
[57:44] amen
[57:46] Jesus looked at Peter and he says
[57:49] Satan is desire to Sifty like wheat but
[57:51] I've prayed for you that your faith fail
[57:52] not
[57:54] that you don't get sifted
[57:57] you're going to get sifted but I've
[57:58] prayed that your faith fail not
[58:05] you know Peter he lives a miraculous
[58:09] life Peter they go by the gate beautiful
[58:11] and they they pray for the man and he
[58:14] runs he goes running into the temple
[58:16] leaping and jumping and praising God the
[58:18] lame man and then they later they arrest
[58:20] him and they put him in prison and an
[58:22] angel of the Lord comes down and opens
[58:24] all the doors the inner chamber the
[58:26] outer chamber all the way to the street
[58:27] and delivers a miraculously
[58:30] God preserves his life and saves him
[58:34] but at the end of his life the same God
[58:36] who saved him out of prison allows him
[58:38] to go into prison while he waits to be
[58:40] crucified upside down
[58:43] so when was Faith working in Peter
[58:47] when was perfect faith when was God's
[58:49] faith in action was it when the prison
[58:51] doors opened or was it when he went to
[58:54] the cross and was hung upside down
[58:55] because he didn't even want to be
[58:57] crucified he didn't see himself worthy
[58:59] to be crucified in the same fashion as
[59:00] his savior
[59:02] I say both were faith
[59:05] just as much faith for one is the other
[59:10] amen
[59:15] praise God
[59:17] if you if you think of the Apostle Paul
[59:19] the Apostle Paul in one city is
[59:22] miraculously delivered and the next city
[59:25] he's beat
[59:28] the next city he escapes somebody comes
[59:30] to his defense the next city he's stoned
[59:33] and left for dead
[59:37] one God comes on the scene and delivers
[59:39] him the next one he's stoned until he's
[59:42] left for dead
[59:46] and you begin to wonder what did Paul
[59:48] look like
[59:51] what kind of scars did he have in his
[59:53] body
[59:55] when you're when you're beaten 39 times
[59:57] across your back
[1:00:00] I mean that wasn't a wet noodle whipping
[1:00:03] what kind of scars did he have on his
[1:00:05] back what did his face look like as the
[1:00:08] Rocks were bouncing off of his skull
[1:00:10] because they were trying to kill him
[1:00:13] with those rocks
[1:00:16] you see he had Faith to be delivered but
[1:00:18] he had faith when he wasn't delivered
[1:00:23] he had Faith to go through the beating
[1:00:25] he had Faith to go through the stone and
[1:00:27] he had Faith to offer up his life in
[1:00:29] Jerusalem if that's what it took
[1:00:33] is that right
[1:00:35] what was it it was faith
[1:00:38] amen sometimes we think that great faith
[1:00:41] is exercised only in great Miracles
[1:00:43] sometimes it's a miracle not to lose
[1:00:45] your faith in the midst of affliction
[1:00:48] it's a miracle not to fall away when
[1:00:50] others have suffered half of what you
[1:00:52] suffered and they've already left the
[1:00:54] message
[1:00:55] they've already walked away from the
[1:00:56] word they've been through half the
[1:00:58] church troubles you've been through amen
[1:01:00] they've been through half of the
[1:01:01] afflictions they've been through half of
[1:01:03] the rejections half of what you've been
[1:01:04] through and they've already walked away
[1:01:06] from truth amen sometimes it's a greater
[1:01:09] Miracle of Faith to stay when everything
[1:01:11] goes wrong and still believe
[1:01:15] when you've been through disaster after
[1:01:17] disaster but something's still holding
[1:01:21] that's faith
[1:01:23] so when we read through Hebrews 11
[1:01:25] amen sometimes you know all of us have
[1:01:28] been serving God we have absolute
[1:01:30] wonderful testimonies of God's
[1:01:31] Deliverance God has done so many
[1:01:33] wonderful things for us amen and we read
[1:01:36] through the Bible and we read through
[1:01:37] Hebrews 11 and we start to focus only on
[1:01:40] those miraculous times of Deliverance
[1:01:42] but listen the the the hero chapter of
[1:01:45] faith in Hebrews 11 doesn't end until it
[1:01:48] begins to talk about those who were not
[1:01:51] miraculously delivered but they were
[1:01:52] miraculously kept
[1:01:55] they were miraculously different
[1:01:56] delivered from unbelief
[1:02:00] when I say thank God for faith
[1:02:03] there's faith for every occasion faith
[1:02:07] for when I'm high faithful when I'm low
[1:02:09] faith for when it goes well faithful
[1:02:11] when it goes wrong there's got to be a
[1:02:14] Godly faith that arises to every
[1:02:16] occasion
[1:02:17] that'll keep us through no matter what
[1:02:19] happens amen we have to walk through I
[1:02:22] mean sometimes listen friends sometimes
[1:02:24] God instantly delivers us from a
[1:02:26] sickness sometimes you have to walk
[1:02:27] through first space of time
[1:02:30] sometimes God instantly delivers us from
[1:02:32] a work situation sometimes you've got to
[1:02:34] stay
[1:02:36] and watch God resolve there sometimes
[1:02:38] you stay and it doesn't get resolved
[1:02:40] we need faith for both
[1:02:44] we need to we need to recognize faith in
[1:02:47] both
[1:02:48] and not just
[1:02:51] I don't want to be in the situation
[1:02:53] where God by his grace has given me a
[1:02:55] Measure of Faith and that measure of
[1:02:57] faith is holding me through dark trials
[1:02:59] and I'm going through dark trials just
[1:03:01] hoping that I'll have faith to get out
[1:03:02] of this trial
[1:03:04] oh God's already given you Faith to go
[1:03:06] through the trial God's already given
[1:03:08] you Faith amen the faith that will take
[1:03:09] you out it's the faith that's keeping
[1:03:11] you through amen it's the faith of God
[1:03:13] it's unconscious it's working it's not
[1:03:15] letting you go away it's not letting you
[1:03:16] disbelieve it keeps having you confess
[1:03:18] the promise when everything's still
[1:03:19] going wrong you're still saying but his
[1:03:21] word is true and by his stripes I'm
[1:03:23] Healed
[1:03:24] and the symptoms persist but it doesn't
[1:03:26] matter I still believe
[1:03:29] amen that's miraculous Faith amen that's
[1:03:32] Faith Of God working right there while
[1:03:34] you're Afflicted and while you're
[1:03:36] destitute and while you're miserable
[1:03:41] I want to recognize that and thank God
[1:03:42] for it amen I said thank God I would
[1:03:45] have never made it this far if it wasn't
[1:03:47] for you I could have never went through
[1:03:48] that trough if it wasn't for you I could
[1:03:50] have never suffered through that
[1:03:51] rejection if it wasn't for you you gave
[1:03:53] me Faith it wasn't me it was you amen it
[1:03:57] was the faith that you gave me
[1:04:00] praise God
[1:04:01] is good friends
[1:04:05] brother Graham says
[1:04:09] he says he's talking about job now he
[1:04:11] says job never recognized that it was
[1:04:13] God
[1:04:14] as long as the devil can make you
[1:04:15] believe sometimes that your little
[1:04:17] trials you grow through is God punishing
[1:04:19] you
[1:04:20] it was God trying to show him something
[1:04:22] job never recognized it until he saw a
[1:04:26] vision
[1:04:27] job couldn't even understand what was
[1:04:29] going on but we understand what was
[1:04:31] going on because we got a peek behind
[1:04:32] the scenes
[1:04:34] and you realize what was this trial God
[1:04:36] was proving a son
[1:04:38] God was proved this test the word test
[1:04:40] means proving many times God was proving
[1:04:43] a son amen have you ever he's talking to
[1:04:45] Satan himself saying have you ever
[1:04:47] considered job there's none like him in
[1:04:49] all the Earth
[1:04:51] and he says but you've hedged him around
[1:04:52] you've protect him he says I'll remove
[1:04:54] the Hedge you may do this and you may do
[1:04:55] that God is allowing it job doesn't
[1:04:58] understand what's going on job has no
[1:05:00] idea what's going on and he's suffering
[1:05:02] under many afflictions amen but there's
[1:05:04] one thing that job can't do job cannot
[1:05:07] deny God and deny the word
[1:05:10] through it all and God's proving him
[1:05:13] job says in Job 1 20 he says then jobber
[1:05:16] Rose and rent his mantle and shaved his
[1:05:18] head and fell down upon the ground and
[1:05:19] worshiped
[1:05:21] and said naked I came came out of my
[1:05:23] mother's womb and naked shall I return
[1:05:25] thither the lord gave and the Lord had
[1:05:27] taken away blessed be the name of the
[1:05:29] Lord and all this job said not nor
[1:05:31] charge God foolishly this is when he
[1:05:34] lost his wealth when he lost his
[1:05:36] children when he lost all of these
[1:05:37] things everything in one day is gone
[1:05:39] amen and this is his response I say that
[1:05:42] is faith in action
[1:05:48] in job 23 says behold I go forward
[1:05:51] but he is not there backward but I
[1:05:54] cannot job is saying I have no idea
[1:05:56] where God's at I have no idea what's
[1:05:58] going on in my life and I don't know why
[1:05:59] this is happening to me
[1:06:02] job is in this discourse with his three
[1:06:04] friends and they're accusing us sinning
[1:06:06] and he's declaring himself righteous
[1:06:07] because why he believes the word
[1:06:10] and he's offered the proper sacrifice
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:14] so now they're having this Discord and
[1:06:16] he's not understanding and there's even
[1:06:18] things he says in the Discord that he
[1:06:19] regrets because later he says I'll speak
[1:06:21] no more
[1:06:25] but one thing's for sure he holds on to
[1:06:28] the word of God for his day he believes
[1:06:30] that sacrifice is sufficient
[1:06:34] he believes the word and that his
[1:06:36] performance of the word he has faith in
[1:06:38] the word that was given to him that day
[1:06:40] and that Faith holds him all the way
[1:06:41] through the trial even through false
[1:06:43] accusations from false friends
[1:06:46] and on the left hand where he does work
[1:06:49] but I cannot Behold Him He hided himself
[1:06:51] in the right hand that I cannot see him
[1:06:53] but he knoweth the way that I take and
[1:06:55] when he hath tried me I shall come forth
[1:06:58] as gold
[1:07:00] amen why because there's a Measure of
[1:07:03] Faith
[1:07:06] what's going to come forth is gold in
[1:07:08] you and I it's not going to be the me
[1:07:10] part
[1:07:11] but it's going to be the god part
[1:07:13] it shall come forth as God
[1:07:17] says God
[1:07:20] has turned his back upon him he was
[1:07:22] setting out there scraping his boils
[1:07:24] well everything was gone job couldn't
[1:07:25] understand it he said I know God's not
[1:07:28] unjust but why am I I this way and Satan
[1:07:31] poking everything at him to get him to
[1:07:32] curse God job didn't know that but yet
[1:07:35] his faith held out
[1:07:39] oh praise God that's the kind of Faith
[1:07:42] he's putting his children
[1:07:44] the faith that Abraham had the faith
[1:07:46] that Noah had the faith that Sarah had
[1:07:48] the faith that the three Hebrew children
[1:07:50] had the faith that those that were
[1:07:52] destitute and Afflicted had the faith
[1:07:54] that those amen who wandered about in
[1:07:56] deserts and dens and caves of the Rock
[1:07:58] Amen being destitute Afflicted tormented
[1:08:00] that Faith you've got
[1:08:02] by the grace of God and that faith that
[1:08:04] brought him out that faith that took
[1:08:06] them through you've got that Faith by
[1:08:08] God's grace
[1:08:09] and if it took them through it'll take
[1:08:11] you through if it brought them out it'll
[1:08:13] bring you out if it'll work the
[1:08:14] miraculous amen and deliverance of the
[1:08:16] work that the miraculous and deliverance
[1:08:18] in you if it'll work the miraculous in
[1:08:20] Breaking you through it'll work the
[1:08:21] miraculous in bringing you through
[1:08:25] because that faith is a reality
[1:08:28] no matter what happens I don't
[1:08:29] understand what's happening I don't
[1:08:31] understand why we get into situations
[1:08:33] and we have no no understanding why this
[1:08:35] is happening why did I lose this and why
[1:08:38] is this happening and why can't I get
[1:08:40] over this but I know one thing his grace
[1:08:42] I belong to him and I believe this
[1:08:44] message and I'm part of it amen I don't
[1:08:46] know why everything's wrong I don't know
[1:08:48] if it's my fault or not my fault
[1:08:50] sometimes we don't know I don't know if
[1:08:52] it's something I did wrong or just
[1:08:53] something that has to happen I don't
[1:08:55] know if I've got something in my life
[1:08:57] that needs to be purged I don't know if
[1:08:58] God's doing this to show somebody else I
[1:09:00] have no idea what's happening but one
[1:09:02] thing I know that this message is the
[1:09:04] truth and I by grace and part of it
[1:09:07] and no matter how South it goes I can't
[1:09:10] change that amen and no matter how much
[1:09:12] anybody else doubts because of my
[1:09:14] Affliction I can't doubt it myself
[1:09:16] because it's not here it's here
[1:09:21] it's something that just know
[1:09:24] and that faith will keep us through
[1:09:26] whatever we have to go through
[1:09:31] praise God
[1:09:34] even the prophet of God
[1:09:36] had attention in the nervousness in a
[1:09:39] seven year cycle of affliction
[1:09:42] while he was praying for others and
[1:09:44] believing
[1:09:46] he also believed just as much as anybody
[1:09:48] else did that the promise of God was for
[1:09:51] him
[1:09:52] he believed that by his stripes he was
[1:09:54] healed just like anybody else believed
[1:09:55] it
[1:09:56] but God was using this for something in
[1:09:59] his life and until God had finished
[1:10:01] until he come to the eighth cycle amen
[1:10:03] God wasn't going to take it away
[1:10:05] when we come to that last cycle just
[1:10:07] before he took the prophet off the scene
[1:10:09] he preaches in the wings of a snow white
[1:10:11] dove God delivered him from that and
[1:10:13] when that great Deliverance came when he
[1:10:15] took him home just a little over a month
[1:10:16] later
[1:10:18] why did he go through that I don't know
[1:10:20] all the reasons why he went through that
[1:10:22] but he went through it
[1:10:24] but he believed all the way through it
[1:10:30] he says sometimes he was so sick
[1:10:33] he would grip the pulpit to keep from
[1:10:35] falling over
[1:10:36] and praying for others delivered
[1:10:38] delivered delivered I mean no doubt
[1:10:41] somebody had questions how can you
[1:10:42] believe and you can't even believe for
[1:10:44] your own healing
[1:10:47] how can you pray for others and you're
[1:10:50] sick can't you remember when he had the
[1:10:52] amoeba amen and he come back from Africa
[1:10:54] and he knows that was because he
[1:10:55] disobeyed God and he had that amoeba it
[1:10:57] was like to kill him he thought he was
[1:10:58] going to die amen and he couldn't get
[1:11:00] better couldn't get better couldn't get
[1:11:02] better and one day God gave him a vision
[1:11:03] and it's gone
[1:11:06] amen what was keeping him through faith
[1:11:10] what delivered him faith
[1:11:13] it was all faith
[1:11:15] I say thank God
[1:11:17] the same faith that keeps me is the same
[1:11:20] Faith it's going to deliver me
[1:11:22] the same faith that keeps me holding on
[1:11:25] to this word
[1:11:26] even when things go wrong
[1:11:29] is the same Faith that'll bring me
[1:11:30] through and out of every trial
[1:11:34] that's the reality
[1:11:37] James says in James 1 2 says my brethren
[1:11:40] counted all joy when you fall into
[1:11:41] diverse Temptations knowing this that
[1:11:44] the trying of your faith worketh
[1:11:46] patience that we're trying means proving
[1:11:49] you know if we say we have faith that
[1:11:51] it's got to be proved
[1:11:53] job had faith and God let it be proved
[1:11:55] amen our faith will be proved
[1:11:58] so we ought not to get too surprised
[1:12:00] from time to time when our faith is
[1:12:02] being proved
[1:12:05] and and James says count it all joy
[1:12:10] that's where I need to improve my marks
[1:12:12] on my grade card
[1:12:16] count on all joy when you fall into
[1:12:18] diverse Temptations knowing this that
[1:12:20] the trying of your faith worketh
[1:12:21] patience
[1:12:22] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:12:25] that you may be perfect and entire
[1:12:28] wanting nothing
[1:12:31] that faith has to be proved it has to be
[1:12:33] tried but that triangle will bring
[1:12:35] patience and patience when it's finished
[1:12:37] will do her perfect work making us
[1:12:39] entire entire perfect and tire wanting
[1:12:43] nothing it's all working together for
[1:12:46] the glory of God
[1:12:49] I want to look at this
[1:12:51] story we know the story super super well
[1:12:53] but I just want to go back through out
[1:12:54] of brother Ben's life story and and he
[1:12:58] tells this portion of it in the message
[1:12:59] here ye him
[1:13:01] so the hardest hour I ever struck in my
[1:13:04] life
[1:13:05] just give you a personal testimony
[1:13:07] when I went into the room of my dying
[1:13:10] baby there had been a gospel preacher
[1:13:12] for about six years I stood there by my
[1:13:14] baby
[1:13:15] they wouldn't let me go and didn't want
[1:13:16] me to go in but I slipped in
[1:13:18] it was down in the basement in an
[1:13:20] isolated Ward flies had gone in its
[1:13:23] little eyes and I shooed the flies out
[1:13:25] and put a little net like over it
[1:13:27] I looked at the little thing and said
[1:13:29] Sharon do you know your daddy
[1:13:31] and she'd suffer so hard to her little
[1:13:33] baby blue eyes had crossed
[1:13:35] my heart was gripped
[1:13:37] her mother was laying in the morgue the
[1:13:39] night before I got down on my knees and
[1:13:42] I said Heavenly Father what have I done
[1:13:43] to deserve this will you spare my baby
[1:13:46] oh blessed Lord please do
[1:13:49] and looked like I can't come a black
[1:13:52] sheet unfolded like that just shut her
[1:13:55] off from my view he absolutely refused
[1:13:58] to hear my prayer
[1:13:59] I stood up and looked at her like that I
[1:14:02] knew she was gone
[1:14:04] Satan come to me and he said will you
[1:14:07] serve him now
[1:14:09] why because this is the hour of his
[1:14:11] affliction
[1:14:13] this is when he's being tormented
[1:14:16] afflicted
[1:14:18] this is he said the hardest trial of his
[1:14:22] life
[1:14:24] and in that trial Satan's talking to him
[1:14:29] it's a sin come to me and he said will
[1:14:31] you serve him now there's your wife your
[1:14:34] father's just left your brother was
[1:14:36] killed up there on the road there's your
[1:14:38] wife in the morgue
[1:14:39] oh yes you're a preacher he ought to be
[1:14:42] kind to you shouldn't he will you serve
[1:14:44] him
[1:14:45] that was the most cruelest Temptation I
[1:14:48] ever had
[1:14:49] for there was my baby and what had I
[1:14:52] done nothing as I note of I said reveal
[1:14:55] it to me God I'll make it right
[1:14:58] he said that was the cruelest Temptation
[1:15:01] I ever had
[1:15:04] amen so many times it's a story but this
[1:15:07] story was reality to him
[1:15:11] and when we let our minds just go to
[1:15:13] that place and let ourselves enter into
[1:15:15] where he was
[1:15:16] cannot imagine
[1:15:19] that pressure that temptation
[1:15:21] he had saw his brother killed
[1:15:25] he had held his dad in his arms as his
[1:15:27] dad took his last breath and died and he
[1:15:29] saw his wife die all of these things
[1:15:32] happen in close proximity to one another
[1:15:36] and he was praying and he said I was
[1:15:38] praying for God to spare my daddy
[1:15:40] and he died in his arms
[1:15:42] listen when you're exercising all the
[1:15:45] faith that you have God don't let my
[1:15:46] daddy die don't let my daddy die and you
[1:15:48] watch him breathe his last breath and
[1:15:50] you feel him go stiff and cold
[1:15:52] that's a challenge to Faith
[1:15:56] when you're standing beside the bed of
[1:15:58] your baby and you've lost your brother
[1:16:00] lost your father lost your wife and now
[1:16:02] your little baby is Afflicted so
[1:16:04] Afflicted her eyes are crossed amen and
[1:16:06] all you want is God to deliver and
[1:16:08] you've seen God work miracles When you
[1:16:10] pray you've seen wheeled people get out
[1:16:11] of wheelchairs and you've seen blind
[1:16:14] eyes open and here's your own little
[1:16:16] baby laying here and you're asking God
[1:16:18] your father amen if he'll heal this
[1:16:20] little baby and he refuses to answer
[1:16:21] your prayer
[1:16:24] this is the hour of his affliction
[1:16:26] this is the hour of his torment
[1:16:30] and at the time it made no sense to him
[1:16:33] he said I didn't do anything wrong as
[1:16:35] far as I knew
[1:16:36] he was asking God to show him he would
[1:16:38] make it right he he didn't understand
[1:16:40] why any of this was happening to him at
[1:16:43] the time it was all a mystery to him but
[1:16:45] oh praise God there was a faith that was
[1:16:47] holding in this hour
[1:16:49] the man was letting loose we know later
[1:16:51] he nearly went crazy tried to commit
[1:16:53] suicide was losing his mind but there
[1:16:55] was something besides the mind of the
[1:16:57] man and the emotions of the man that was
[1:16:58] holding there was a faith that was
[1:17:00] holding through the torment and through
[1:17:02] the affliction
[1:17:06] he says then he goes on to say but every
[1:17:08] son that cometh the God must be
[1:17:10] chastened and tried
[1:17:12] then all of a sudden I was left alone to
[1:17:15] make my decision God wasn't speaking to
[1:17:18] him remember God refused to speak to him
[1:17:19] but Satan was sure speaking
[1:17:22] God was silent but Satan was talking
[1:17:27] and I'm sure everything in his emotional
[1:17:30] realm was agreeing with Satan
[1:17:37] said then all of a sudden I was left
[1:17:38] alone to make my decision
[1:17:40] I put my hand over her little head and
[1:17:42] said Sherry honey the angels are coming
[1:17:45] to take you home
[1:17:46] daddy will pack your little body down
[1:17:48] yonder and late in the arms of Mama and
[1:17:50] I will bury you out yonder on the
[1:17:52] graveyard Hill
[1:17:53] but some glorious day daddy will see you
[1:17:56] again
[1:17:57] I raised my hands to him
[1:17:59] and I said Lord
[1:18:01] if you slay me
[1:18:03] yet will I trust you
[1:18:09] see this is when Faith came not when God
[1:18:12] worked the miracle and raised her up
[1:18:15] not when God changed the situation not
[1:18:18] when God brought the healing or God
[1:18:20] changed his Agony and God took him out
[1:18:23] of Torment no
[1:18:24] Faith came on the scene in the midst of
[1:18:27] all that when God wasn't changing those
[1:18:29] circumstances
[1:18:31] what was God doing he was doing
[1:18:32] something inside that prophet
[1:18:35] said Lord if you slay me
[1:18:38] yet will I trust you
[1:18:40] I love you
[1:18:42] and a great peace comes and settled down
[1:18:45] over me
[1:18:46] he had to come to his hour of Affliction
[1:18:49] his hour of torment and he had to come
[1:18:51] to his hour of decision whether he would
[1:18:52] serve God or not
[1:18:54] and everything was going wrong but but
[1:18:57] what what gave him the capacity to
[1:18:59] choose right it was a faith that was
[1:19:01] down inside that could not leave God and
[1:19:04] could not leave his word the man was
[1:19:06] shattered the man was erect but the god
[1:19:08] inside that man was still holding on
[1:19:13] brother Ben said Mr Eisler said to me
[1:19:18] that day going up the road he said Billy
[1:19:21] in all this trouble did you keep your
[1:19:22] religion
[1:19:23] I said no sir it kept me
[1:19:27] yeah my anchor held that's right I never
[1:19:29] kept it it kept me I can't keep it
[1:19:32] there's no way for me to do it but it
[1:19:35] keeps me yes sir
[1:19:40] what's kept us faith
[1:19:42] what faith not our piddly little human
[1:19:44] Faith but that faith that was measured
[1:19:46] out to us by God by his grace by his
[1:19:49] predestination and that faith has held
[1:19:51] us through it all friends
[1:19:53] we've been through some things and we're
[1:19:55] probably going to go through some things
[1:19:58] listen
[1:19:59] the prophets died with their eyes dimmed
[1:20:02] leaning on a staff
[1:20:04] the curse took its effect oh they set in
[1:20:07] amen arthritis set in they became
[1:20:10] crippled they they were Afflicted amen
[1:20:12] you say but didn't they have faith they
[1:20:14] had Faith they had faith in their day to
[1:20:16] keep the word for their day to see the
[1:20:17] word manifest in their day amen but when
[1:20:19] it came to the end of the Earthly
[1:20:21] Journey it wasn't yet time for a
[1:20:23] translation so the curse was still an
[1:20:25] effect on their body
[1:20:27] is it how could Isaac the promised son
[1:20:29] die blind
[1:20:31] because he was still a human being
[1:20:34] but though he was blind that seed of
[1:20:36] faith never went anywhere
[1:20:38] though Jacob died leaning on his staff
[1:20:42] blessing the sons of Joseph though
[1:20:44] Joseph would die in the land of Egypt
[1:20:46] amen he was still stuck in Egypt but he
[1:20:49] gave him Commandments concerning his
[1:20:50] bones how by faith he said you're coming
[1:20:53] out of here and take my bones with you
[1:20:57] that Faith didn't deliver him out of
[1:20:58] Egypt that day that Faith Delivered him
[1:21:00] out of Egypt in the appointed time
[1:21:06] amen
[1:21:08] we've been through some things
[1:21:10] we'll probably go through some things
[1:21:14] we don't know the moment of translation
[1:21:17] and if we should have another 40 50
[1:21:20] years
[1:21:21] many of us will get afflicted
[1:21:24] more afflicted
[1:21:25] weaker
[1:21:27] but oh may God allow me to die in faith
[1:21:31] if I have to go by the way of Grace let
[1:21:33] me die in faith amen because the same
[1:21:35] faith I die with is the same faith that
[1:21:37] I'll resurrect with
[1:21:40] and if I don't if that's not my path
[1:21:42] then that Faith that's keeping me is the
[1:21:44] faith that's going to translate me
[1:21:45] because Enoch by faith was translated
[1:21:49] either way it's going to be Faith amen
[1:21:52] whether I whether I go natural or
[1:21:54] whether I go Supernatural amen I'm going
[1:21:57] to go by faith
[1:21:58] by God's grace amen by his grace and his
[1:22:01] help by the Revelation he's given me I
[1:22:03] want to go by faith all the way through
[1:22:05] every day of my life whether it be high
[1:22:07] or low I want to go by faith
[1:22:10] and that Faith take its effect
[1:22:13] in me
[1:22:14] a Believer can die
[1:22:17] in faith
[1:22:19] a Believer can be afflicted in faith
[1:22:22] tormented destitute in faith
[1:22:25] but praise God
[1:22:27] that same Faith that'll bring us through
[1:22:29] will bring us out
[1:22:31] by the grace of God
[1:22:34] and I want to look at one other
[1:22:36] scripture
[1:22:37] first John 5 4.
[1:22:39] for whatsoever is born of God overcometh
[1:22:41] the world and this is the victory that
[1:22:43] overcometh the world even our faith
[1:22:48] what faith do you think that is human
[1:22:49] Faith No I think that's the faith that's
[1:22:52] been given to us by a measure
[1:22:54] given this by God by a measure and that
[1:22:58] faith will overcome the world in
[1:23:01] everything that the world throws at us
[1:23:03] by faith
[1:23:05] may God bless you let's all stand
[1:23:09] amen I just wanted to share I thought
[1:23:12] musicians if you'll please come
[1:23:14] brother Ben if you'll come
[1:23:16] I want to share just one more quote I
[1:23:18] wasn't I didn't know that I was going to
[1:23:19] share this but I had it in my notes I
[1:23:21] just want to share
[1:23:22] because this is something that I want to
[1:23:23] apply to my life all the way back in
[1:23:25] 1956 brother bear says when their eyes
[1:23:28] were open he said worry follow sin
[1:23:31] did you ever notice what a horrible
[1:23:33] thing worry is
[1:23:35] now we think it's natural to worry and
[1:23:37] it is natural to worry but brother bam
[1:23:39] said it's a horrible thing and worry
[1:23:40] follows sin
[1:23:42] it's a horrible thing to worry
[1:23:44] there's not one value in it at all
[1:23:49] I was speaking here some time ago in a
[1:23:51] group of men at a club in a city and
[1:23:53] there's not one value if he was going to
[1:23:56] be killed in the morning I said worry
[1:23:58] would not help you one bit
[1:24:01] I seen one man kind of look down and
[1:24:03] kind of laugh and he said well what
[1:24:05] would Faith do I said I said sign your
[1:24:07] pardon
[1:24:09] that's right worry there's no value in
[1:24:12] it Faith so just get away from worry and
[1:24:15] have faith
[1:24:17] listen when we come into trials and
[1:24:19] obstacles and difficulties worry is part
[1:24:22] of the natural man anxiety is part of
[1:24:24] the outside man amen but there's an
[1:24:26] inside man that's got to take control of
[1:24:28] the outside man
[1:24:30] and say listen nothing's out of kilter
[1:24:34] nothing is happening outside God's
[1:24:36] knowledge nothing is happening that's
[1:24:38] not working together for good so you
[1:24:40] outside man you listen we're not going
[1:24:42] to worry right now
[1:24:44] we're not going to let worry run rampant
[1:24:46] in our minds we're not going to let it
[1:24:48] take us in places we don't need to go
[1:24:49] this is what I want to have in my life I
[1:24:52] want the faith that's laying there I
[1:24:54] want to move every obstacle away from
[1:24:55] the faith and let the faith Express
[1:24:57] itself and say there's no reason to
[1:24:59] worry God is still on the throne and I'm
[1:25:01] still his child and this message is
[1:25:02] still true and the promises are all true
[1:25:04] they're all yea and amen do I know
[1:25:07] what's happening no do I know why it's
[1:25:09] happening no do I know what the end
[1:25:10] result will be no but I know one thing
[1:25:12] all things work together for the good
[1:25:18] and God knows
[1:25:21] God knows
[1:25:24] are we holding on the faith
[1:25:27] with all I can but I got pretty weak
[1:25:29] grip
[1:25:31] but I know one thing that faith is
[1:25:32] holding on to me
[1:25:35] whatever God ordained for me and
[1:25:37] whatever by God grace gave to me that's
[1:25:40] the thing that's overcoming in every
[1:25:41] situation and that's the thing that's
[1:25:43] holding on
[1:25:45] amen let's bow our heads together and
[1:25:47] pray
[1:25:49] dear heavenly father we thank you Lord
[1:25:51] Jesus
[1:25:52] for your word Lord
[1:25:54] there's so much instruction in your word
[1:25:57] for life
[1:25:58] there's so much Lord in in your word the
[1:26:01] examples you've given us in the lives of
[1:26:03] your Saints there's so much you've laid
[1:26:05] out there Lord that will move away every
[1:26:08] lie of the enemy when he tries to come
[1:26:11] and bring us doubt just because we're
[1:26:12] going through troubles
[1:26:14] God you've laid in your word
[1:26:17] What Faith Can Do
[1:26:20] faith can deliver from everything
[1:26:24] faith can keep us when nothing else can
[1:26:27] oh God I pray that you would just
[1:26:30] Quicken our faith
[1:26:32] God every obstacle anything that's
[1:26:34] plugging the channel for the faith
[1:26:36] inside of us to be expressed I pray
[1:26:38] you'd remove it now
[1:26:39] let your word Purge us and let us see
[1:26:42] with the right kind of eyes every
[1:26:43] situation we face
[1:26:46] forgive us Lord for being so carnally
[1:26:48] minded
[1:26:49] but help us Lord to fly with Eagle wings
[1:26:52] above
[1:26:53] and to see things the way you see them
[1:26:56] because if we could ever get a glimpse
[1:26:58] by revelation of what you see all the
[1:27:00] troubles will vanish and will know that
[1:27:02] everything's under control
[1:27:05] God I thank you
[1:27:06] for what you've done I thank you
[1:27:09] for this Hebrews chapter 11 and what it
[1:27:12] means to me Lord

[1:27:16] chapter 11.
[1:27:18] and you're the Great Hero today you're
[1:27:20] the great hero of Faith working in our
[1:27:22] lives
[1:27:23] and we want to yield to you and give you
[1:27:25] place and give you room
[1:27:27] we want to die to ourselves into our own
[1:27:29] thinking
[1:27:31] well when we ask that you would Lord
[1:27:33] bring that Faith to the surface and may
[1:27:35] that Faith Master every situation
[1:27:38] may become something to reality in our
[1:27:41] lives it is so unconscious that it's
[1:27:43] moving the world around us we're not
[1:27:45] even fully aware because the faith is
[1:27:47] just taking action
[1:27:49] may it move freely through US Lord and
[1:27:52] accomplish what you've left for this
[1:27:53] hour to be accomplished in and through

[1:29:56] [Music]
[1:30:08] and earlier today I was
[1:30:11] I was thinking of the life of Paul
[1:30:13] you want to talk about a roller coaster
[1:30:15] ride
[1:30:16] from Deliverance to affliction
[1:30:19] from a thorn in the flesh a constant
[1:30:21] ailment in his body to Supernatural
[1:30:24] Miracles taking place on every hand
[1:30:27] God an angel would come to him
[1:30:30] personally and speak to him about
[1:30:31] delivering everybody on a ship because
[1:30:33] of a storm but the angel would never
[1:30:35] take away the storm but promised to
[1:30:37] deliver everybody
[1:30:41] there's a time that he inside a school
[1:30:44] out ministering the gospel and they're
[1:30:46] taking and arrested and beaten and
[1:30:48] they're in prison and they're told by
[1:30:49] the magic the jailers told by the
[1:30:51] magistrates keep them fast and so he
[1:30:53] takes them to the inner prison and he
[1:30:55] puts their feet in stocks with their
[1:30:57] feet and stocks after being beaten and
[1:30:59] rejected amen at midnight
[1:31:02] they begin to sing praises to the Lord
[1:31:06] I think through all the ups and downs
[1:31:09] Paul learned something
[1:31:11] that everything is under control I says
[1:31:14] me personally he demonstrated it here at
[1:31:17] midnight feed and listen I don't know
[1:31:19] about you but I have never been beaten
[1:31:21] in prison with my feet in stocks amen
[1:31:23] I've had little bad things happen like I
[1:31:25] have a head cold and then somebody said
[1:31:27] something bad about me and I have a hard
[1:31:28] time praising the Lord
[1:31:32] you understand
[1:31:35] but praise God no matter what's
[1:31:37] happening God is good and the word is
[1:31:39] true and I'm a son of God
[1:31:43] you can be sick as a dog but you're a
[1:31:46] Son of God and this message is true and
[1:31:47] God's allowed you to see it
[1:31:49] part of the program
[1:31:52] they're gonna have just lost your job
[1:31:54] and have no idea how you're going to pay
[1:31:55] the bills but it doesn't change anything
[1:31:57] I'm still a Son of God and God's on the
[1:31:59] throne and this message is true
[1:32:03] oh I I so badly want to improve my
[1:32:07] scores
[1:32:09] I want to take these examples I want to
[1:32:11] take these lessons in the life of the
[1:32:12] prophet of God in this age and I want to
[1:32:14] say you know what nothing's out of
[1:32:16] kilter everything's fine amen I still
[1:32:18] believe God and I still believe I'm a
[1:32:20] child of God and how can I be so
[1:32:22] Afflicted and still know that I'm a
[1:32:23] Child of God that's a substance faith
[1:32:26] it's a foundation faith and for that
[1:32:29] alone we can sing praises in the midst
[1:32:31] of the trial is because that never left
[1:32:36] and we got rough the fact that I know I
[1:32:38] belong to God that never left
[1:32:40] that faith is worth praising God for
[1:32:44] amen All Through the Bible it's been up
[1:32:48] and it's been down it's been wonderful
[1:32:50] it's been troubles
[1:32:52] but it's Faith from beginning to end
[1:32:55] our lives are
[1:32:57] Miracles and testimonies and afflictions
[1:33:00] and hardships but it's Faith from
[1:33:03] beginning to the end it's faith that
[1:33:05] keeps us all the way
[1:33:07] to the end of the promise
[1:33:09] may God bless you as you're dismissed go
[1:33:12] rejoicing
[1:33:14] that God's word is true
[1:33:17] and that this message is true and he's
[1:33:19] put something in my heart to believe it
[1:33:21] and believe I'm part of it and that's
[1:33:23] worth rejoicing about all the time
