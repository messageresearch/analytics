TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in the fourth seal the prophet makes this statement the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form I think it's amazing and I'm just going to share this with you I don't have a solution to all of these statements so don't look at me to explain everything tidy I can't but sometimes brother B said the seed's laying there and it takes the spirit to bring it life but then he said the the the the spirit is the word he says it this way the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form so where do you get the spirit from the word or from somewhere else to make the word live I think we start over complicating things I think we start making it difficult CU he told us in the scriptures that there three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the spirit and these three are one amen the true word carries with it the true spirit amen they come together amen there's a spirit of God that will make the word of God live amen I can't tell you whether amen you have to get the word first and then the spirit comes upon the word and makes it live or you get the word when it's preached in the spirit of the word and the spirit of the word I can't tell you how the mechanics of it all I'm just going to tell you that you can't separate these things too far from one another that if you want the spirit you need the word amen if you want the spirit life inside of you you need to get the word if you want the word to live you need the spirit of the word to make it live so don't ask me how to mechanically break that down I can't break it down for you cuz brother Brenham says it both ways and I can't make it neat and tidy but what I can tell you is this word that been given to us in this day has transforming power life inside of it life to bring the life in you to fruition life to bring the word that's preached to manifestation so is it the word that comes to me or the word that's in me it's both friends it's the word that's in you that was planted before the foundation world it's also the word that's coming to you to manifest itself in you so where does the manifested life come from does it come from the nature of God trapped inside the SE Gene of God or does it come from the word that's being preached to me as it manifests itself I'm just going to say both you need both you must have both you have to have a seed and good ground amen I know this it doesn't matter how much seed's inside of you amen you can ask for Holy Ghost to be poured on you all the time but without the preaching of the word there's not going to be a manifestation of the life of the word it takes both amen it takes the word and the spirit it takes the life inside of you and the Life coming to you right amen so let's not over complicate it let's just say God fill me with your word but no I want to be filled with the spirit okay fill me with your spirit how's he going to fill you with the spirit probably going to send you his word I I don't want to complicate this I just want to say this word word that you've given me will do what you sent it to do amen whatever you planted inside of me before the foundation of the world by predestination it's going to do what you ordained it to do this word whether in me or coming to me is not going to return to you void but it'll accomplish what you sent it out to do
