a nice atmosphere we have here you must come with expectation i'd like you to turn in your bibles to revelations chapters 1. revelations chapters 1 verse 12. amen and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man clothed with the garment down to the foot and gird about to the pabst with the golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool his as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet unto fine brass as if they had burned in a furnace and his voice as a sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth with a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in its strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i won't have you turn but i have one other scripture psalms 116 15. precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints if you will just bow your heads for a word of prayer heavenly father lord we come before you lord this evening lord we know nothing more to do than to surrender our vessels here before you this evening we recognize it was your grace that's watched over us and it was your grace that brought us here this evening father we recognize in and of ourselves we're unable to do anything right in this life anything good that we have we've received it from you so father god i just commit myself to you this evening and my insufficiencies and the thoughts that i have lord you know that even i know that i'm incapable of doing anything right so lord i just commit myself to you and i'm looking to a promise that you'd never leave us nor forsake us and lord we as all a people that were once not a people are now a people by your grace learning to walk by faith even each and every day even lord hitting the guardrails of our own human ability and coming off of it and realizing that will do us no good i just pray lord god that you would humbly receive glory and help your people tonight and take the thoughts and meditations of my heart and deliver them just the way you want them said we love you and thank you in jesus name amen amen you may be seated tonight so i you know me enough to know i have a funny way to get to my subjects and god kind of deals with me in a funny way sometimes but you know god is a god of variety and so he must have uh he wanted some oddballs like me i guess in that way and so i i just i told brother chad i was like man i'm really having a hard time today really hard time today it's like i have so much in my heart and so little in my brain it's like the brain is failing me um and i can't seem to take what's in my heart and inspiration that's in my heart and even see able to get it to the brain so i could put it on a computer and so i just realized i am incapable of doing anything good but i i want to minister something to you that's just something in my heart something that i've seen in the scriptures and and i heard brother branham say yesterday he seemed like he kind of was acting funny i was listening to a sermon he said you know i'm just going to get out here and preach the way i feel i'm just going to preach from my heart it's how i don't know i think he wrestled with himself to realize you know what maybe sometimes i just gotta just go with the flow go with inspiration and go where he wants to go um but you see i i i tied these two scriptures together for a reason and the special emphasis here was when john saw him he fell at his feet as dead and the other portion which i did not want to use this scripture but it hit me like four days ago and i actually cast it aside was precious in the sight of the lord as the death of his saints because the only time i've ever used or heard that scripture used is at funerals and to my knowledge there's nobody dead here tonight yet but i honestly started to fight with myself on that scripture and said now lord why would i use that for an opening scripture precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints isn't this isn't this only when someone dies but saints don't die christians don't die they can't die no the christians don't die so maybe the lord was meaning something here that we just want to take a peek at here a little bit maybe there's a death that we come to in order to enter into life first and when i when i i literally argued with myself for like five minutes i'm like who in the world am i arguing with i was saying i can't use that scripture well sure you can i'm like no i can't use that scripture it doesn't fit and then it fits perfectly and i said well you know you know you're acting strange when you're arguing with yourself on a scripture but i i wondered maybe i am preaching a few at all tonight maybe i am because john does fall at the feet of jesus as a dead man at a certain point in time in this in this journey and that's what i want to look at is this journey because i realize that i am not just hearing words in a book i am seeing my position in the scriptures and i am i'm john i you're john because john is a type of the bride and we are walking in the footsteps of the bride john this type through the bible coming up to this great revelation of the mystery of christ that he had hid in the back parts of his mind from before the foundation the world that he is making known right now and the process has never deviated from the one you'll see in the word you're never going to have an experience or a process that deviates what the scripture says is going to happen and i want to look at this from just an odd perspective i hope you'll just hang with me i just felt like this is what i'm supposed to bring so if i feel that way then that's what i bring and then then i'll sit down and i will sing some songs but here's how i got to this [Music] so i really have fun with the youth meetings so i can relax with the youth i can have fun with the youth i can act goofy with the youth right and i don't feel like i can do that with you guys so i would like to be able to just relax so i would i would i would really like you to just just you're all youth tonight right so remember in the mind of god you're eternal we're all the same age technically because we had no beginning nor no end so it's okay um so tonight we're just going to have a youth meeting and with the youth meetings we've been having here we've having just a great time and i want to say that i love spending time with youth and as your parents that you let them come i really enjoy it they're way more of an encouragement to me sometimes i think than i am to them so always appreciate that and um we were going through the church age book last year no in 2019 and we went through the entire church ages and we had just a really good time and god was really gracious and merciful to us and we saw a lot of things and i saw a lot of things and i was encouraged by a lot of things and in 2019 we finished the church aged books almost right there in december and i said well i have in my heart i want to go to the seals book and i said we can't go to the seals until we go to the breach and so i told all the kids there right at the end of the year 2019 we're going into the breach and then there's that little thing that happened called covet and it stopped the youth meetings and we had no youth meetings and but i really had in my heart i wanted to preach on the seals i want to speak on the seals i want to study the seals i want to dive in to the seals and knowing before then i got to go to the breach but 2020 was an interesting year we didn't get a chance to do that and one thing we realized about 2020 at least i did was i don't think i was ready to speak on the breach and i don't think i was ready to speak on the seals because i don't think i was in the right perspective i don't think i'd be looking at it from the right direction one thing 2020 i think maybe i'm not the only one that could say it really humbled me down it really broke me down it really showed me who my problem was it really really did that and with god you have to approach him in the right manner in the old testament when the high priest would go in there to make sacrifice he couldn't just go in there any old way he wanted to he couldn't just wake up in the morning and say ah i'm going into the holiest of holies today nope he had to dress the right way he had to walk the right way he had to come into the presence of god in the right way if he didn't he's a dead man you know what i mean and i find there's a pattern in the scriptures that if you don't approach him in the right way you will never see him even though he can be right there and i'm going to you know and i'll use an example like this do you remember in the bible there was the woman who fell at the table of the lord and said lord son of david my daughter's dying you know and she says and he says to her he says it's not meat for me to give the children spread the dogs and she said lord help me you remember that she approached him calling him the son of david which to her she was he was not the son of david but brother bam says but he he was her lord and when she addressed him the right way he then does something to her to test her he says it's not meat for me to give the children's bread to dogs and she says yeah lord that's the truth that's the truth but even the dogs who eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table so you're seeing some things happening here god had to be approached the right way addressed the right way and then the woman had to react to the response of humiliation the right way to receive from god what he wanted to do what she needed and so for me when i when i i started to stop and to think what did god show me in 2020 and you know brother chad you recap the year very very well for me some of the highlights for 2020 was i am my own worst enemy is i am too strong i had too much ability i didn't realize the antichrist spirit is way closer than i think i didn't realize just how much of a woof nature i still had in me because the wolf nature always tried to defend its rights you know we have right now everybody's fighting for rights remember laodicean church age everybody's got rights we've got social rights we've got economic rights we've got health care rights fighting for school rights right to education all on one aisle the other aisle we've got constitutional rights we've got a bill of rights we've got a right to bear arms we got lots of rights right is this true a lot of rights on both sides a lot of rights on both sides and then i'm reminded of someone in the bible 2000 years ago who forfeited all his rights to fulfill one purpose and one objective one purpose one objective and if you think about that if you go back in time i'm just not even looking at notes so if you go back in time with me 2 000 years ago you had lots of groups of people on the scene at one time you had the politicians you had the political leaders at that time that they were trying to hold things together you'd have herod and the local municipalities there they didn't want the people to get out of hand because they liked their position they wanted to maintain their position and the rights that come with that position then you had the economical leaders that were very comfortable in the status position that they had as the leaders of that day and they didn't want anything to disrupt their position then you even had the disciples who were jockeying for position even the disciples because they weren't even converted yet though they were standing in the presence of the king we're still saying hey who's going to sit on the right and who's going to sit on the left which one among us is the greatest among us we want to know because we want position because with position comes right you know what i mean and all the while there was a little lamb in the presence of the people there was a lamb of god who had the highest level the greatest seat of position he looked down on everything and he forfeited it all gave up all his rights to pay a price for you and me and then my question then comes then today where is the lamb where is the lamb that has rights but forfeits all their rights you forfeit your bill of rights you forfeit your constitutional rights you forfeit your gun rights you forship your social social rights you forfeit your economic rights you forfeit all your rights and say not my will be done but god's will be done you know what i mean so i realized that um in me was a lot of things not right and maybe i'm not the only one maybe maybe there was a few of us that were still we've got rights and little did we realize that was the laodicean spirit and it's working on as an antichrist spirit to get you to pull you away from the word and the word is very simple very humble won't shout at you won't yell and it maintains the same and it hides in simplicity the whole time and so as i realized that in my heart i wanted to go to the seals i really realized i had a lot to learn in 2020 i could not go there because i wouldn't be approaching him the right way i hope that makes sense and i think it's been confirmed just a little bit maybe i'm just maybe it's just me but when brother chad even just took justification last wednesday and sanctification on sunday to me it was god hiding in the simplicity of his word revealing it the same way that he hid it to people simple enough to receive it and god's whole mystery plan was that from the beginning he hid it in simplicity so the simple could receive it i love that he made it so that a fool should not air it i don't have to do spiritual backflips into a body change i don't i humbly simply believe his word and humble myself under his hand of humbling and so i was well we finished the year 2020 and i says well i want to go to the seals and here as i'm going in these seals about a month ago i'm praying about i said i want to go to those seals i want to start with the breach again with it for the kids for the kids and for me because i really like going through them and before i'm approaching it i'm realizing you know the last time i spoke i think i spoke i don't know what the title was bringing forth fruit in this barren land and uh i kind of shared with you a little experience where the lamb of god didn't really express a lamb like nature and it was a very down spot for me and i realized that that was just the beginning of a downward spiral of brokenness that lasted a few months and by the god's grace he brought me out of it but what i realized in that was i realized there is nothing good with me they're re they're real i have nothing to glory like i'm broken i'm weak i have nothing that i can say i'm strong enough to do this like i didn't i had a point in time i'm literally looking at the ground i'm saying i can't i'm gonna break i'm gonna i can't take this anymore i'm no better than the dust and dirt i'm standing on i literally had that spot in my mind and not thinking straight just not thinking straight and then i came and i'm praying about these things and that's when all these thoughts start coming to my mind and here i am i'm wanting to go to the seals and i'm wanting to see the breach and i'm wanting to understand when the lamb only the lamb can take the book and lose his seals i'm wanting to understand this mystery and god in his mercy is showing it to me portions of it and yet i'm realizing that i can't approach these next steps until i can fall at his feet like a dead man and actually realize i'm dead and it's one thing to say it but i don't believe we preach just philosophical ideas i believe we preach what we're experiencing what we're going through where we came from and where we're going and maybe i'm just so simple enough i actually believe i'm a part of this story not because of anything good i've done but by his grace i believe i'm a part of it i really do i'm identified with these bible scriptures and so when i was uh approaching it the thought struck me i says my here i am and i'm broken and i want to go into the breach and here i am i've realized i've turned from the seven church ages i seen his glory in his power and here i am experiencing 2020 realizing there's absolutely nothing good in me never was everything was by his grace nothing good in me and here i am wanting to go to the breach and in all of that these things start to come very very clear to me because i do not believe uh i'll put it this way revelations 1 when he sees the image he falls to the ground like a dead man he does not get back up until revelations 4 when he's caught up higher by a trumpet voice you know that so this is a pattern and i wanted to read this quote that i came across when i was preparing for that so because before i started into the breach i woke up in the night praying about it and i realized i was going to miss something and what i was going to miss i came downstairs i grabbed my seal book and i started reading the breach and i i kind of looked back and i realized oh man i skipped god hiding himself in simplicity i said well do i really need god hiding himself in simplicity i understand the concept i think right that's a scary thought i think i got it figured out oh that's where i fail so i opened up i turned it all the way back to godhead himself and simplicity it's about 4am and i start reading it and brother branham about page 14. he says i didn't see it to weigh in the wee hours of night last night this thought and this is what ties the whole thing together the whole thing the whole you can't see the breach you can't understand what he's saying i mean you could tell me the words but you can't see it you won't see the seals you won't see the breach until you see god hiding himself in simplicity it's the little mystery key to the whole thing and so when i woke up and i read that i said well praise the lord thanks for waking me up at 4 a.m i can't start the breach i got to the kids that afternoon with youth me i said sorry guys we're not going to the breach we're doing god hiding himself in simplicity we're going to start right here and i and i saw it and god had himself in simplicity i saw i can't go there unless i first come the right way and i'm going to read a quote to you and this may help what here is thou elijah 1959 he says john sprole a real friend of mine taking his wife and took a friend of mine taking his wife a trip to alice lorraine france and the guide was taking them through a certain garden and he showed them a statue of the lord jesus and brother sproul said he was looking at the statue he said what did the sculptor have in his mind why don't i don't see any sufferings of christ i don't see nothing just looks like a statue what does it mean and the guide said to him mr sproul perhaps you are criticizing the statue he said yes sir i said i don't know what the sculpture had in his mind he said the thing of it is you have to know what the sculpture had in his mind before you can see what he was trying to do he said now you come down here and he went and he took him to the very foot of the cross and there was a pad he said you kneeled down here he said now you look up and mr sproul said that his heart almost broke within him there was that every agony that jesus went through on the cross all featured he said you see sir the statue was made to get down and to look up to not to stand afar off and look over at well that's the way pentecostal is and that's the way that the word of god is that's the way the promises of god is it isn't to stand afar off to one side and say oh there's nothing to it no you got to get down on your knees one time and you have to look up to it then you'll see all together a different picture you'll hear something speak back to you through the word that will pick you up and say oh it's the oh it's just a word that's uh that's a paper that's wrote on paper that's what you'll say looking at it but when you get down on your knees one time you'll say oh lord is this your word this is your promises to me isn't it lord and i'll feel and you'll feel the tears that'll be running off your cheek and the whole thing will be altogether all together different when you do that long thought but you get what i'm saying you can't look at it you can't look at this word you got to look up to it and that's exactly what took place in revelations 1 to revelations 4 when he turns from the seven church ages and he sees the mighty god unveiled through the seven churches he sees the seventh a church is and the seven messengers then he falls to the ground but then the lord lays his right hand upon him to whom the arm of the lord is revealed right and then he doesn't get back up until revelations 4 when he hears an open voice and then he looks at the breach so this whole thing i'm trying to say is maybe 2020 was just getting us into position to be able to really go where god wants us to go and to see the things that god wants us to see but recognizing it's all in simplicity it's all in simplicity i needed broke i know i needed broke um psalms 117 now going back to this scripture of precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints and i i struggled with it and then i grabbed the whole chapter so why don't you open it up in your bibles 116 verse 1 116 verse 1. it says i love the lord because he hath heard my voice and my supplications because he hath inclined his ear unto me therefore will i call upon him as long as i live the sorrows of death compassed me and the pains of hell gat hold on me and i found trouble and sorrow then called i on the name of the lord o lord beseech thee deliver my soul gracious is the lord and righteous yea our god is merciful the lord preserveth the simple amen i was brought low and he helped me return unto thy rest o my soul for the lord hath dealt bountifully with me for thou hast delivered my soul from death mine eyes from tears and my feet from falling i will walk before the lord in the land of the living i believed therefore i have spoken i was greatly afflicted this greatly afflicted i wanted to just read you what this greatly afflicted is it's ana it means to be bruised with and to be oppressed and to be humbled by to be afflicted and to be bowed over to be put down and to be made low depressed and cast down to be stooped to humble oneself and to be bowed to be afflicted to be humble to be mishandled to be humiliated afflicted and weakened bowed down i said in my haste all men are liars what will i render into the lord for all of his benefits to me i will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the lord i will pay my vows unto the lord now in the presence of his people precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints and you remember in the scriptures isaiah 53 it says yea it yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put on him he put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by the knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities i think god finds pleasure in us being broken i think god finds pleasure in us falling before his feet as dead men absolute dead i believe god finds pleasure and precious in his sight is when we die and say not our will but thy will be done okay maybe it was just me the only one that needed to die so i don't think so though i don't think so brother brenna makes this comment he says i was at a friend's house yesterday in a christian home and there were some young christians gathered and i was talking to them and the something was presented to me and i thought oh how i was looking into the woods around the trees and seeing that that they were dying and i thought oh how pretty those trees are even though they're dying yet they are pretty and sometimes a tree looks better when it is dying than when it does in its greenest and at its best and i wonder if that just wouldn't be the picture of our condition to our heavenly father for he said precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints how that must be a beautiful thing for the father to look down at his child coming home to him holding his position in christ and his faith and his confession i am saved by the grace of god and i stand there in the hour of death yet he will hold his profession and i believe that our father loves our gallantry and believing and holding to our testimony and just it isn't just to testify when you're feeling good or healthy or strong it's when you're down weak and troubled that that is when your testimony really counts amen so father god may be pleased in our destruction may be pleased in seeing us hold our confession in total brokenness total brokenness turn to job 42. just want you to see the pattern here there's no going up until there's a first going down then job chapters 42 then job answered the lord and said i know that thou canst do everything and that no thought can be withholding from thee who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore hath i uttered that i understood not things too wonderful for me which i knew not hear and i beseech thee and i will speak and i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me i have heard of thee with the hearing of the ear but now mine eye seeth thee there wherefore i abhor myself and repent in dust and in ashes isaiah 6 when job sees him in the reality of what he is after those seven seals if you remember we went through the seven seals and jobs lies we saw the six seals and him coming up to the seventh seal and when he sees the seventh seal he falls like a dead man chapter 6 isaiah chapter 6 in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled his temple above it stood seraphins each of them having six wings and twain covered their face with twain they cover their feet and with twain they did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips from my eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts noticing a pattern in your bibles now to first peter 5. uh first peter four was i think his first peter first peter oh i'm sorry no first peter 5'4 i apologize first peter 4 5 it says when the chief shepherd shall appear he shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away likewise he younger submit yourselves to the other yea all of you subject yourselves one to another and be clothed with humility for the god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble uphumble thyself therefore unto the mighty hand of god and he will exalt you in due time this is at his appearing there's no difference between his appearing in the humility of the one he's appearing to and it's shocking to me that you can be in his presence and not recognize it truly cannot recognize it even so much that john the baptist in the presence of jesus christ through inspiration said behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world then sends messengers and says are you the one or do we look for another and the reality of it is his answer came when he was in prison when jesus answered him and said tell john the blind see the deaf here and the gospel the poorest preached into the gospel and john knew that that was him because he saw that jesus was the vindication of the word because god vindicated his word by bringing it to pass and we know the manifestation of the word is when god fulfills his word so john recognized him as who he was when the word declared what he was but he was even in the presence of him and could not recognize it because it was too simple even to john it was too simple so where is the presence of christ today where is the lamb at where is christ is he veiled in humility is he veiled in simplicity is he veiled in vessels of dishonor vessels rejected smitten rejected those are the vessels he's still hiding but you can be in his own presence and not even recognize that he is in your presence because he's veiled in human flesh jesus said this in matthew he says the disciples came to jesus said who's the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus called a little child and set him in the midst of him and said verily i say unto you except you be converted and become like a little child you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself like a little child shall be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven you know brother banham talks about moses he said god let moses get real strong real wise so wise he could teach the egyptians wisdom he let him get so he was at the peak of his performance and you would say athletics he was a peak in politics he was next in line to be pharaoh he let him get in that condition just to let him fail miserably just to show one thing i won't do it that way i won't do it that way do you think god would let you get real strong even a prophet moses was a prophet and knew he was a deliverer he knew who he was he knew his position the question wasn't did he know his position he knew his position he just wasn't in the right condition ain't that something that does make you want to preach brother shay right position but wrong condition you can know your position and still not be in the right condition to fulfill the plan of god that he has for your life it's an interesting thing to me the bride of jesus christ we are told your position you know your position you know what the word says about you but you forsake the very thing that god's using to get you in the condition to fulfill your position oh that's kind of fun to say i enjoy that my ain't that something that's fun to think about but it is the truth we're forsaking the very thing that god is going to use you think that 2020 was it my they're signing things so fast they're going to run out of ink pretty soon they're putting stuff in order the mask is going to look small compared to some of the rights that are going to be ripped out of your hands but it's perfect it's perfect it's just what god has ordained and the whole thing let them do what they're going to do i just don't really resist the hand of god to condition me to get me in the right place for him to fully reveal that great mystery that he put down on the inside of me though i know i'm mud and muck though i know there's nothing good here i know he put something down on the inside and he's going to express it at the right time and in the right way i know he's going to do it and even brother branham said that in christ and god hide himself into place he says remember this was all this was an old pawn that nobody wanted nobody wanted he said but down on the inside of that pond there was little lily a little lily and he said it would press down beneath the mud and the muck looking for that light reaching out for that light to express the great beauty that was on the inside of it and i can say amen to that that's pretty simple ain't it but boy there's a lot of truth in that see i like how god hides it in simplicity i know that god even brother branham goes on he starts to talk about the little the building there he said you know this building it was just a just an area nobody wanted and we put up the building here he said it's a simple building you know when he says one time a man tried to take the building from us okay a man made a falco false accusation to try to take the building but god watched over it and it didn't happen then he said there was a fire up there was a wood burner up in the the rafters there he said they went do some excavating and do some work on it and the fire just didn't take he said the whole building should have been destroyed he said what was it must have been the hand of god watching over the building now you know and i know he's speaking about somebody just not about the building he's speaking about me and he's speaking about you you know and with everything you knew there's a false accuser accusing you day and night putting thoughts into your high trying to get you to deny who you are in christ day and night but he can only go so far and his claims will fall false there's no one to enforce those claims because there's all an overriding word that says i am bone of his bone life of his life flesh of his flesh when she is him so there's an overriding person there's a judge there that says no i'm throwing out that accusation it won't fit against these people because i've declared them righteous though they make mistakes it's not the righteousness of their works but it's an imputed righteousness that god gave to me by my faith and my faith alone and i thought that the other day oh foolish galatians who hath bewitched you to think that you think you came out by the hearing of the word you think you can add one inch to your stature from anything that you do no sir this was grace in the beginning it's grace at the end he starts the work and he'll finish the work and brother branham he goes and he's talking about that that fire that was inside of that building he said but it just couldn't take it it wouldn't go god was watching over it and you know and i know down on the inside of you this body of flesh is filthy rotten nasty thing there would be things that would destroy you that's already on the inside of you but god won't let it happen it won't it won't go it won't destroy it no god has purposed within himself that just makes me happy to know that god purposed in himself to preserve me i'm not preserving myself i'm not putting myself in a rapture he purposed in himself and this is the fulfillment of his desire not mine well it is mine but i've got nothing to do with the fulfillment thereof i just humble myself and believe what he's told me i'm so happy i got something to believe with you know when brother branham kept talking about that god high himself simplicity i told the kids i said don't think that god didn't inspire him to say those things for with no reason he inspired him say it with a reason now here's brother branham before he can even go into the breach and go into the seals what does he tell the church to do reconsecrate their lives time for a reconsecration god did call you out you're the elect of god you're god's chosen people but before we go into this we need a reconsecration before john could go into revelations 4 you better fall as a dead man before isaiah could step into chapter 7 in the fulfillment of the seal he had to say woe is me before job could actually go and pray for his friends and intercede on behalf of them remember how god did that he set it all up he said if job don't pray for you you're done for and now job had to play the intercessory role on behalf of his friends but before he could do that he had to bow his head to the dust and ashes from which he came there is no way you're going to approach into that seven seal mystery that god docked up and put inside of you unless you first can come to him in the right way he put it in earth and vessels remember jeremiah he took the seven seal mystery and put it into earthen vessels okay that was earth and vessels where are they today he paid a price two thousand years ago but the mystery is still in earthen vessels christ in us is the hope of glory so these things here in in god hiding himself in simplicity what you begin to realize is there's a necessary process of god humbling us people and humbling this bride we're not going in because of the end of our intellectual ability to see things i think we continue to walk with him as we don't forsake whatever he brings our way to put us in the right position to see him that's a really strange way of saying just humble yourself to whatever god has in store for your life i think it's going to be so simple and it's going to be so humble and there's not going to be any great accolades remember what god calls great man will call foolish it could be i've even thought this we know brother branham said when i and my father are one and these other things when they begin to say those things right could it be that i may not actually be able to verbalize it in this right way but you watch my life my life will declare the life of my father living in me you watch my reactions to my wife if she doesn't talk to me right will my father be present manifesting in me you watch a brother at work who's ridiculed and made fun of what presence will be manifested there maybe it'll be the presence of his father manifesting expressing a different life that he once could not live see it's going to be so simple it's going to be so humble it's going to be isaiah 53 all over again there'll be no beauty that we should behold it none whatsoever there'll be no great accolades and no standing applauses for you in the eyes of the people but god will take attention to it i believe with all my heart god will take attention to that remember he even said in god calling the conference he even asked his son son do you want to go to that cross do you want to go pay that price you're going to be humiliated you're going to be rejected by everybody you want to do it yeah i want to fulfill the will of god i want his will not my will be done so whatever purpose he has in mind in these things i just want to submit myself to it um i might read this if it's okay a couple of things i i i didn't think i'd be long because i just my notes you know they bothered me um i want to read this about moses he said god won't leave his program that's the reason we know that it has to be simple now he always works in simplicity but god in the beginning that could have made the son to preach the gospel he could have made the wins to preach the gospel or an angel preached the gospel he could ordain men that for but he ordained men for that purpose and he never changed it he never ordained he never ordained denominations nor did he ordain groups of men ordained but he ordained a man to preach the gospel not machinery or mechanical devices and when he brought deliverance to the people down there he sent a simple human being born of a simple family a bunch of slaves what a god he is unfolding himself in that simplicity now notice he had had the training of worldly wisdom so that he could so that he could fail and show that it isn't by wisdom that we will ever be delivered by it is by faith that we are delivered he let him go in and get such an education until he could teach the egyptians wisdom he was so smart god was with this that simple family who could perhaps not even write their name and moses took the highest of their schooling and was with such a great education until he could teach wisdom to their teachers he could teach geniuses yes and god let him get that way just to display himself in humility and to show that wisdom has absolutely nothing to do with it moses miserably failed in his genius and he let him get that way for that purpose so that he would fail and he did fail and he fell so you see it's not by power nor by might but by not by the wisdom of the egyptians and not by the wisdom of your schools it's not by the power of our seminaries and it's not how not by the amounts of our organization but it's and not by the power of scholarly teaching but it is by my spirit saith the lord amen i am resting in the fact that i believe his promises to me musicians come it's one of those things it's like once i say what i feel to say i'm done i'm sorry guys it's a wednesday night you won't be upset with me i hope not musicians come um it's maybe too simple maybe it's supposed to be simple the devil complicates things the devil gets you twisted up not know what's up and what's down and god comes in such simplicity he makes it simple do you understand what i'm saying don't stumble at the simplicity of his unveiling he's going to continually unveil himself in simplicity it started off that way in the beginning it will finish that way at the end and it was i love the fact that brother branham said that bloody lamb came to take the book that book of redemption that abstract title deed and he said he was a bloody lamb he said where did he where did where did those what happened he says there he was in the garden of gethsemane bleeding great drops of blood so he took his fatal blow right there in the garden and he fulfilled his purpose on the cross but he took a fatal blow he took a fatal blow to his own will and he died right there jesus's will died in the garden and i believe it was precious in the sight of the lord now the question is whose will will die next whose funeral am i preaching tonight am i preaching a funeral i don't know i'm probably just preaching my own but i think god has a purpose in these these things they look strange sometimes and they come across strange but i'm convinced that god's doing something i really am um i'll read this scripture while you stand with me but what things were gained to me i counted for loss for christ yea doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that i may win christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings and be made inconformable unto his death if by any means i might attain into the resurrection of the dead and brother branham said this and he said investments but we can we can be a good church member and morally right not to still not obtain eternal life not to know the word some of them are theologians and scholars and sunday school teachers and bible expositors but that doesn't mean anything satan knows the bible better than all of us the bible said to know him is life to know him is life i want to know him i want to know him in the fellowship of his sufferings whatever sufferings he's laid for me i want to say that's okay if that gets me in the condition that you want that's okay with me just bow our heads for a word of prayer lord we come before you now um thankful lord lord we're thankful for your grace we're thankful for the fact that you're more interested in our character than our comforts and lord we want to thank you for all the blessings that 2020 brought us strange to say but i know it was a blessing in disguise for the bride and lord we know that she's got to be in the right position or the right condition i should say so that her great position can be fulfilled in redemption's plan and story and i just pray lord that you would help us each as individuals to never complain never argue or be upset with whatever god brings our way to get us to draw us closer to you father we know that that's your great purpose in every difficulty and every trial is lord you put bits in their mouth and you use them to draw us right up into your presence and we're so thankful for that so father god we just commit ourselves to you this this new year of fresh and anew forgive me lord for maybe i wasn't looking at things through the eyes of simplicity like i should have been and times gone past lord i pray that you'd help me to see things just the way you want us to see him help us as a people to see the simplicity of your reality in our midst father i pray lord that you would help us lord take our hand and continue to guide us which you have done in the past and we believe you will continue to do we commit the words that have been said in their broken up way to you father and to the people may they lord serve their purpose and we know they will lord your word will never return unto your void i just pray lord that you would bless your people and bless us as we go home that we can be better servants to you and better expressions of your desire lord we love you we commit ourselves to you in jesus name amen amen hope that's okay everybody [Music] short and simple but maybe to the point i'm looking forward to 2021 i'm looking forward to whatever political changes come our way and whatever difficulties god has in store i know they'll be good i know they'll be good see what pleases the father to be able to see you rejoice in midst of trials to see you happy and joyful you know yeah biden's going to sign in a whole bunch of new laws and a whole bunch of regulations you say praise god just furthering the plan of god just going to get me where i need to be to fulfill what he has for my life blood like you got song [Music] according to your work according to your promises i can stand secure carve upon my that heart me free [Music] [Laughter] your [Music] [Music] [Applause] truth promises sets me free one more time [Music] [Laughter] according to your [Music] [Music] truth promises sets me free praise god i was thinking my brother god was preaching that brother branham got to the seventh seal when he got to the seventh seal he said see i'd how did i know how did i know a week ago sunday when i said get simple it's got to be simple god hiding himself in simplicity how did i know that i was talking about this now brother branham tied the seventh steel to god hiding himself in simplicity in the seventh seal because it's simple it's not what you do it's what he does through you that's the simplicity of the seven seal it's not a life you live it's a life he lives through you but what he's got to do he's got to get us to lose confidence in our life confidence in our will confidence and lose confidence in all of our ability so that we can just surrender to the word and be humble and be simple and let him do what he's always purposed to do he had a purpose for moses but he had to get moses into condition where moses would just surrender and just simply do what god do it god's way right paul paul was a a chosen vessel of god but paul had too much education too much ability he had letters from the high priest and god washed all other way so that he would just do it god's way and sometimes we go through things and we have trials and difficulties they humble us they break us but i think we just have to keep learning that we've got to just surrender and do it god's way he doesn't need our ability he doesn't need our our great intellect he doesn't need our strength what he just needs is a surrendered willing vest and i say that's what i want to give you lord in every trial that proves that he's a faithful loving father but also gets me to lose confidence in myself i call it a good trial every difficulty that gets me to to forget about my my my abilities and that i can do nothing but proves that he's my heavenly father and he'll watch over me i say that was a good trial amen as we move forward like kyle said things are changing they're changing fast whether they get worse whether they get better or they get worse then get better they get worse again who knows but you know what there's one thing i care about i want to be exactly what he wants me to be where he wants me to be and i want to trust him through it all sometimes i i watch as myself and others as we get so bent out of shape about things get so upset and start the words that come out of our mouth sometimes i think we act like we have no heavenly father we get so upset and so angry and we just act like god's not in charge and that he doesn't know what's happening and we start saying this is wrong and this is wrong and how can this happen and how can they do that and i could say they can do nothing unless god permits it and and you just wait until the very thing that god god promised us through a prophet starts to happen when it begins to tighten up and we begin to lose religious freedom and start to find religious restrictions placed upon us and what's going to come out of our mouth then how can they they can't this and that i want you to say lord i'm trusting in you if you realize through the bible all those supernatural things that we found in the bible and we look at the wilderness journey and all the supernatural that god did every time god did that supernatural unbelievable miracles that had never been seen on earth it always come at a time of absolute weakness and brokenness and complete inability how many want to see the supernatural you put your hand up you said yes god does it in a way that he's the only one that gets credit for it he does it in a way that you know you had nothing to do with it it wasn't you you couldn't do it you weren't spiritual enough smart enough and you couldn't quote enough quotes or scriptures because all that your human ability failed you but god came through anyways and he gets all the credit we've got good days ahead of us may not be good for the flesh but it'd be good for the soul and that's the part that i care about more than anything because when god bless you amen god bless you as you go god be with you and we're going to sing stay and pray and worship as long as you like but you can be dismissed let's sing like [Music] lord tried and true [Music] [Applause] [Music] me for you [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're tried
