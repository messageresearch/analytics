meeting is working because of your prayer your support and your help amen so we felt home this is my second home amen blessed be the name of the lord so let's go straight to the word someone mentioned to me yesterday don't take too long to take off the airport you know i was uh when i was praying i mentioned about the 49 straps that jesus had on his back he was actually 39. have you heard about it before what branham said he had 39 straps which is 39 major disease that was on his back you need the quote you see me after church have you heard that before yes and i was wondering where did he get it then paul say i was whipped by the jews 40-1 carrying the mark of christ the message is perfectly in order with the scripture you have not found it yet just chill out let's go in exodus chapter 19 the first five if you're there you can say amen the bible says now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then you shall have a you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people for all the earth is mine god is talking to the jew and he's bringing this great great promise to the jew like this is what i have for you if you just obey what i'm telling you you're going to be a peculiar nation a peculiar treasure above all the people in other words you're going to be the top of everybody presented to the jew amen you might be seated verse 6. and you shall be to me a kingdom of priest it was given to the jew they just didn't know how to manage it they slip out of the hand and somebody else who was unworthy have to get it amen and you shall be to me a kingdom of priest and a holy nation these are the words which you shall speak to the children of israel so the promise to be a nation of priests was given to israel first that was what god told them you do this your whole kingdom not only the levat so the heart of god was that the entire nation of israel become priests he used the levat as a wave shift i hope that is creaking he used them as an example to show israel this is what i want to do to you i want all of you to be like this so i'm pulling one out of you and i'm working through him so you will understand what i'm trying to make everybody in this nation be i want you all to be like them amen so you're more privileged because you're receiving part two the church only have part one except if somebody's not in church and he slip up and he's snaking somewhere then he's gonna be part of party amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to isaiah 61. there is a promise given to israel god wants them all to be priests everybody not only the levite but the entire nation of israel the levite paul mentioned liver when god was pulling the tent in other words the wave shift he was pulling that tenth out then the mansion liver but leave i was not the only one in the launch of abraham all of them were there god has to pull that wave shift out of leave and say this is what i want to do if you can continue on my way and do what i'm telling you that's my vision that's my mind for you amen isaiah 61 verse 6 if you're there you can say amen but you shall be named the priest of the lord men shall call you the ministers of our god you shall eat the riches of the gentiles and in their glory shall you boast yourself so the gentiles had some riches but those witches were natural so god told them you shall be the priest and you shall eat the riches of the gentiles but the jews also have some riches and their which their wealth was not really natural it was a spiritual wealth and we the dentist were outside so now when you flip everything back we the one going to israel to get the riches of israel instead of israel you're going to get the riches of the gender i hope you're getting that but you shall be named the priest of the lord verse 6 again man shall call you the minister of our god you shall eat the riches of the gentiles and in their glory shall you boast yourself again god is insisting i want you all to be priest i want you to be named priest now let's go to the book of revelation we know what happened he came down he came to his own and his own did not receive him determined back paul got that anointing and tried to go among the jews he tried he bothered he bothered after a while paul said no no no no it's too late i need to turn around and go straight to the gentile so that was passed completely to the gentile and the jews never became his priest let's see what happened to the gentile revelation chapter 1 verse 5. if you're there you can say amen and from jesus who is the fateful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth to him that loved us and washed us brother branham said that very word means to loose amen and washed us from our sins in his own blood and has made us water now there is a second revelation that comes out he his liver liver when in genesis chapter 49 when god was blessing israel uh when jacob was blessing israel he was going one by one one by one one by one he never even mentioned the priesthood in liver because he was mad at liver liver went and killed the whole city of the people that were circumcised because somebody took donna and uh and uh forced her and tried to make things right and liva and simeon were so angry so they put a trap on them they say you all male get circumstance they say okay we're going to be part of israel when the gaster comes out leave and simeon pulled the sword and probably was liver who pulled the sword first he said simeon let's go ahead and get them so they went and wiped the entire city completely and jacob was angry and when he looked at liver he said in liver there is an instrument of cruelty but level was the fourth one after abraham because abraham begat isaac and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat to leave her right let's be the name of the lord i'm just stretching you up out of the church ages came the season out of the seals came the trumpet and out of the trumpet comes the vow the fourth one will bring judgment so when he came and he began to bless his children he looked at judah he said judah the kings are going to come from you so when he told israel he said i want you all to be priests they were looking at the tribe of liver so we're going to be like the tribe of liver but in the book of revelation he pulled another thing he said they're going to be king i thought it's only priest now king so are you going to take levi and judah put them together let's see verse 6 and he has made us kings and priests so not only are we priests now we are king and priest why king and priest why not just priests amen he had made us king and preached to god for he and and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen let's go to revelation 5 and we'll pray i want the nation of israel to be priests i want you all to be named priest israel rejected i'm moving to the gentile when i'm moving to the gentile wait a minute i want you to be priests and kings not just priests revelation 5 verse 9 if you're there you can say amen this is the lamb came you know the story pick up the book when he picked up the book the whole heaven was on fire because somebody was found worthy to come take the book and break the seals so when it was the silt time everything changed in heaven amen revelation 7 only hide what was going on because the devil cannot catch it amen verse 9 and then they sung a new song saying you are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof this is in heaven for you are slain and have redeemers to god buy your blood out of every kindred i thought he was the jews only now it's no longer the jews it's every kindred out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation so what started in israel now it's going worldwide amen verse 10 and have made us to god to our god kings and water so at the breaking the losing of the seal that revelation unfolded again that i am looking for a nation of king and priest i am back again when they break the seals then the revelation comes those that were there caught it they say wait a minute this is what was all about so you want us to be king and priest so the opening of the seal must bring you to that the opening of the seventh seal must make you king and priest not just priests you must be king and priest oh this opening of the seals verse 10 and have made us to our god king and priest and we shall reign on the earth so this seal when he open up there is more to it it goes from one thing like an explosion then another explosion then another explosion then another explosion why do you want me to be king god wants you to reign with him why do you want me to be priest why not just priest you taught israel priest and you hide the king because in israel he split them and he was quiet and the devil said uh-huh i know who's responsible for spiritual things let me attack lever and he hid the king he didn't know that the true king the true priest have to come through the king amen you are in the world you were drinking smoking why didn't the devil kill you you were in his kingdom working for him why he didn't kill you he didn't know who you were he thought you belong to him you were hidden under the seventh seal that's why pharaoh can take moses and nurture moses not even knowing that he is he's breathing the very weapon that's going to destroy him and when moses is unfolded it's too late he becomes a hot potato you can't touch him no more one man invasion and brought the whole truck the whole egypt down just one man when he understood who he was [Applause] [Music] so if you never get me when i was in the hospital after drinking and passing out how can you get me now [Applause] what is coffee what is sickness you're just wasting your time you should have gotten me there over there when i was not even praying but my life while yet we were sinners somebody already died for you not when you become christian when you were sinner because that lamb was slain before the foundation of the world before you were even born i knew you i have predestinated you i know everything about you [Applause] oh my god praise be the name of the lord i told the folks back home i say when michael angelo we're already up did you feel that the airplane is already up we have not even prayed yet ever here i told the folks back home i said when michelangelo first must have the vision of moses in his mind but moses was somewhere he had the vision of moses he saw moses already but moses was hidden somewhere so michelangelo went going around and he see a bunch of stone laying there but one of the stone got moses if michelangelo called you and said moses is there you can look around you say where is moses i don't see moses which stone is moses so michelangelo can tell the whole world that i found 20 hundred stone here and all of you and among all of them moses is here and the devil will begin to shoot one by one bring the helmet in the first one i don't see moses the next one boom that's what he did at the birth of jesus christ they told him that the messiah is born oh how old is he two years bring out the baby two years we begin to slay them they didn't understand that does that still slip jesus out because prophecy was already spoken that i'm gonna take my son to egypt the devil missed that one so when michelangelo said moses is somewhere there you say where is moses he said don't worry i'm going to show you moses you say oh okay i'm excited this man is crazy let me see moses he's saying moses is there i want to see moses call the news michelangelo say praise the lord put them 24 hours he walked around there and he pick up a stone they say is that moses he said yes that's moses where is moses he said don't worry i'll show you moses and he brought the stone say this is moses where is moses he's hidden moses is sealed so michelangelo put the stone and begin to chip the stone away everybody here what what was the chipping about is not really molding moses moses was already there the chipping was to take everything that is not moses away from moses [Applause] so what was coming out was not part of moses so the chipping of the world of the entire message is not really chipping you off it's only removing that which doesn't belong to you we came in this world with a lot of stuff and all the world is doing is just watching away what doesn't belong to you and little by little the people begin to look they say yes i see his eye and after a while he saw moses appear he said wow how did you know moses was here he got anointed himself he took a hammer and hit moses and said now do what [Music] [Applause] amen that's the spoken word the power of the spoken word because his image was reflected so you don't have to worry about it just lay in the presence of the sun let him take the chipping away it is not you you thought it was part of you it is not you i told somebody i told the folks back home i said you're struggling bring that demon here just bring him to church did you hear me bring that demon to church tell him let's go to church bring him in the presence of the king bring heaven in the presence of the king you cannot have a banquet with the king on me bring him and in the banquet invite him in the banquet [Music] you want to trouble me come on let's go come on come on in my prayer closet come on get in let's go i pray you pray i pray you pray i pray you pray we're going to see who's going to stay here all it takes is the king to come down and we will see who's going to live [Music] now i don't know which direction because we broke the sand bear [Applause] hallelujah everybody good so keep your seat belt as i'm climbing let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning father thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us lord we are reporting lord father in our place where we think when we talk where we can share the things of eternal life lord father we thank you for everybody that is gathered this morning and even those that are streaming lord father we are committing this entire service unto the hand may you be the beginning and the end be the alpha and the omega father may you move me completely out of the way may you speak to your children and bless us this morning we commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen thank you as you already been seated so let's relax we on the mystery of the sea of glass part two you already know what a mystery is you already know why we ain't uh we tattled this the mystery so we're gonna deal more with the priest right there amen so we talked yesterday just a little recap that god told moses to duplicate the tabernacle in heaven on the earth and when moses did it not only did he duplicate the tabernacle on the earth but he also duplicated the priesthood that was in heaven on the earth everybody clear so far and then we got to a point where we were dealing specifically with the sea of glass and when we dealt with the sea of glass we found out that there were two faints that were connected to the sea of glass one of them is the sea of glass was responsible for the washing of the priest before they enter into the tabernacle they have to wash their hand and they have to wash their feet and brother branham brought another element which is in a scripture but that is down the road and brother branham said that they were also the washing of the sacrifice so yesterday we stopped at exodus 40 where the bible says this that god told moses he said that shall anoint the liver and his foot and sanctify it and that shall bring aaron and his son the high priest and his son unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and wash them with water everybody so far if you notice moses was the one washing the priest but nobody watched moses amen and we gave you moses characteristic yesterday he was a major prophet he was a high caliber prophet he was a levat he was a priest himself his mother and his father was a priest those were the qualification of the man of the hour that have to introduce the first high priest under the order of liver everybody here so far and the bible said that that shall not put that shall put upon aaron the holy garment so first of all you wash the high priest then you dress him and then you anoint him and sanctify him or consecrate him that he may minister unto me in the priest office so we have steps here please be the name of the lord when this high priest comes number one the high priest have to be washed everybody after he's washed they gotta dress him with a holy garment not any kind of garment it must be a holy government when he's when they are washed they must be anointed clear if i can go this is step one step two step three and step four once the anointed once they are anointed then they can enter into their ministry everybody clear into their ministry without this process no more you can enter there and the fifth one once they already washed they are dressed they are anointed they start their ministry then they will have to come back over and over as they go into the sanctuary to wash their hands and their feet everybody clear so far so when we look here the bible says that that shall bring his son and clothe them with coat and that shall anoint them as that did anoint their father so the anointing on the family of the high priest was the same anointing on the high priest himself only there was a different level because the other one were wearing caught but the high priest must have the euromen tandem on him he must carry the entire forward the entire full world must be carried by the high priest alone but the children of the high priest have also caught but their court have not the entire footwork amen the bible continues that that shall anoint them as they did anoint and anoint their father that they may minister unto me in the priest office for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood amen and we know that priesthood could not be everlasting because he was only a replica he was only a shadow he was only a duplicate of the true priesthood that was going on in heaven because we found out under isaiah that even though somebody might be cleansed in the temple but otherwise once they enter the presence of the lord still they found themselves unclean showing that the law could not bring anybody into perfection we found the high priest joshua himself when he stood before the angel of the lord when he stood before the angel of the lord as a high priest he was already washed as a high priest he was already consecrated as a high priest he was already anointed but yet in the presence of the angel of the lord joshua appeared with filthy government showing that that was not enough to bring that worshiper all the way to perfection so we needed another priesthood we needed something that is higher that's gonna take care not only not only on the physical part here but he must take care of you on the spiritual part until you have boldness to enter the throne of god without even be under condemnation because there is no more condemnation for those who are in who everybody clear so we need a higher priest and that priest was melchizedek but melchizedek was not a man melchizedek was a theophany so melchizedek have to be made flesh which went to you yesterday and when he made him when he was made flesh he became jesus christ that's why brother branham said melchizedek became jesus christ the word was made flesh and in jesus christ dwelt the fullness of the godhead badly everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord brother branham says this he said that's all he asked bring your burden to the lord and do what leave it there just leave it there why here is our high priest standing here that knows how you feel and he knows how to reconcile you back to grace and how to bring you back to your health he knows all about it he suffered when you have not got a place to lay your head he had the same when you got one change of clothes he had the same when you are made fun of it persecuted he had the same so let's go where we stop on hebrew chapter 2. blessed be the name of the lord hebrews chapter 2 if you dare you can say amen the bible says this two pages turning we're almost gonna get the altitude so almost you're gonna feel like the plane is now straight so you can unbuckle everybody amen hebrew chapter 2 verse 9 the bible say but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death ever clear clown with glory and honor he must be god not just a high priest he must be god that he by the grace of god should test death for every man not the jews only job two verse 11 for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all water so this high priest we and him we are one [Applause] so he is not somebody that is different than me if we are one he cannot be complete without me if you see him you don't see me he is not complete yet there is a part of him that is missing anybody clear for which cause he is not ashamed to call them water oh now he's my brother i thought he was my god i thought he's somebody that i must feel and say this is god i'm a human being paul said no no when you meet him you say god bless you my brother how are you doing have you seen a wife being scared to hug her husband something is wrong you will see her sitting beside her husband and she does this without any question hallelujah job to verse 14 for as much then as the children number one we are all one not only are we one he is also my brother and not only am i his brother i am also his child we are one who can be one one means a wife and a husband they are it's speaking about relationship of husband and wife and not only that he's a brother a second relationship not only that we are his children so you can approach him in different offices the way you want him he can be approached as son of david or son of god you just need to know who you are if you understand that you're the bride you need to approach him as me and you we are one if you still struggle you say he's my brother that's fine you can still use that avenue if you're still a little bit a child you're just born again you say heavenly father he said fine i can talk to you about it but if you grow up a little bit you will understand that me and you are one hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord for as much then as the children partaking of flesh and blood because we became human ever clear he also himself likewise took part of the water we became human he said no this is part of me is human i cannot stay like this i'm going to be human too and he get into a human body and he begin to walk hey but here through death he might destroy him that has the power of death that is the devil and delivered them his children who through fear of death where all their lifetime subject to bondage for verily he took note on him the nature of angel because he will not understand us we are one with him and he said but he took on him the seed of water abraham who is the father of her faith god blessed abraham there before the jewish nation so that the gentile can be represented there if he did it through the jewish nation then we are completely outside so he put it on abraham when you ask abraham abraham was not a jew he was a friend of god the bible continues on verse 17 he said wherefore in all things he behoove him to be made like unto his he must be like me anybody clear that he might be the what is the purpose of this that he might be a merciful and faithful water in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sin of the people that's the purpose that melchizedek must be flesh he must understand me everybody i bypass my triophane but he doesn't understand so he must be flesh so he understand me better so we can talk the same language about here verse 18 for in him for in that he himself has suffered being tempted he's able to secure them that are water so now when you tempted he understands you completely say i was there i know what's going on when my child is tempted no no no no don't worry about it i was there it's a very bad thing i was there i was tempted to he began to understand amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to hebrew fold you can take off your seat belt hebrew 4 verse 15 amen for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our worker melchizedek was there when we have pain melchizedek doesn't understand our pain so the bible says no no no no he must become flesh and suffer what we suffer when he goes there when i'm here when i'm going through my trouble in life when i say 9-1-1-1 9-1-1 how are you doing over there i'm doing fine i'm hurting right here he said yes i understand let's send the paramedic quickly not 9-1-1 they ask you are you okay so which neighborhood i said no no no no you don't have to worry i've been there i was there amen because when they took the three hebrew children they put them on the fire he was sitting there one wood came he said i want to go there he said don't do that these are my children when it comes to my children i don't want nobody to interfere i'm going to go myself right there and when he jumped there all he did he took the heat out of the fire he said this demon that was bothering you go ahead and walk on it go ahead and walk on it laugh at him how can you laugh to the fire hallelujah amen the bible says that so we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in some point thank you somebody's not sleeping was in all point so there is nothing that can happen to you that he doesn't understand anybody here there is no trial there is no difficulty you cannot sit down and say everybody don't understand me i never you don't understand me i was always horrible i was abused there is nothing that can come in your life that this high priest doesn't understand because the old high priest have to keep themselves pure so when do you you you come and you tell them that i was smoking weed they don't understand but this one you can under you can you can be confident to talk to him even defense that you don't want to talk to anybody because you're ashamed you can come to this high priest you can expose it you can unfold it he understands you perfectly just as he himself was there because he bore your sin he took your sin upon him while he was going on cavalry he was feeling smoking he was feeling addiction he was feeling abused he was feeling all the passive the present sin and the future sin all of those sin were gathered into him that's why heaven could not contain him they say you know what he's not a candidate to come here because what he carries too much filthiness he need to go to hell did he sin no he never done anything so why is he going to hell if he died he need to come to heaven no no no the cargo he's loaded with cannot come here and the devil said praise the lord i got him now he didn't understand what god was doing it was impossible for god to go to hell so god must be a sinner to load the weapon and he can take the weapon to her when he unfolded it's the theophany it's my teacher now i'm back in hell let's deal me and you face-to-face the devil never understand god how can you take the king of glory and put him in hell it's a filthy place he say i know how to take him make him a sinner if he dies he's going to go to hell but when he's going what is really going to help he's a weapon he's melchizedek who's going to hell so now melchizedek entered here when he get there there were a lot of cockroaches you turned the light off they begin to go they said where the mini whatever new you know you hear you you hear you hear he say yes me what are you doing i don't have to talk to you give me those keys and put them back here so you mean kick him out can where's abraham over there abraham where are you he knocked pom pom pom pom po who's there abraham come and say i'm the father of all of you let me open when he opened he look he said sarah you remember genesis 18 come on down here look at him right here he's right here ezekiel ran out he said father abraham moved like this he looks oh the wheel in the middle of the wheel this is the man that i saw then you're saying let me see i'm a little bit taller he said this is the one in the lion's den everybody saw him according to the personal revelation because we and him are one blessed be the name of the lord let's go to verse 16. let us therefore come boldly to the throne of water we are no more under the law where they say if an animal touched the him no when you come both do you know what he means broadly have you seen police officer when they come have you seen them they don't walk like this they have their chest up that's how you go to heaven when you get there you say wait make way to the king you will understand who you are don't worry let us therefore come bodily to the throne of grace that we may obtain water because the law came through moses but grace and truth came through jesus christ that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of what so when you're in need now you understand who to call you understand who's there 9-1-1 you know that if something ever happened to you at work you don't have to worry there's somebody that always got everything under control just call 911. you say i have a problem with my boss he understand it because he was tempted in all points ever clear so far blessed be the name of the lord and the bible also said yesterday that he was the the high priest must understand the ignorance of the people but who was ignorant the jew i thought that you knew the law he must understand the ignorance of the people and those that are out of the way were the jew out of the way because the bible says salvation is of the jew so who was out of the way who was really ignorant that the high priest should understand him let's go to acts chapter 14. blessed be the name of the lord if i lose you you raise your hand then i repeat it again amen act chapter 14 verse 14. if you dare you can say amen act 14 14 the bible say when a witch went their apostle paul and barnabas paul healed somebody and the whole city came to power they begin to worship him they say where we do we see god now in human flesh now when they did that which one the apostle barnabas and paul heard of it they rent their clothes and running among the people crying out and saying sir why do you do this thing why do you do this thing in other words why do you do this thing we human stop doing that we also a man of like passion elijah was a man of like passion we are man of light passion with you and preached to you that you should turn from this vanity to the living god which made heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are doing who in time passed do you get it permitted all nation to walk in their own way in time past he was quiet i'm dealing with the jew let them do what they want to do everybody clear go to acts 17 because the high priest must understand that he the the ignorant and those that are out of the way act chapter 17 verse 24 if you're there you can hallow amen the bible says go back to verse 16 so it makes sense the bible says now while paul waited for them at athens i believe he was in greece his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city who only in other words completely given to idolatry paul entering to ask him the entire city adults everywhere and he stirred him up jump to verse now 20 24 the bible say paul now begin to talk to them he said god that made the world and all things darwin saying that he is the lord of heaven and earth dwell not in temple made with him anybody neither is worship with man's hand as though he needed anything seeing he gives to all life and breath and all things and has made of one blood not two blood of one blood all nations of men for to dwell and all on all the face of the earth and has determined the time before appointed and the bounds of their habitation he he controlled everything amen that day should seek the lord blessed be the name of the lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us watch now for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also as your own poet have said for we are also his offspring we are the offspring full of god verse 29 for as much then as we are the offspring of god or the children of all we ought not to think that the godhead is like to gold or silver or stone graven by art of immense device we must have the mind of god verse 30 and the time of this ignorance everybody see now the time of this ignorance god wink at it in other words god overlooked that ever here god overlooked that but now command all men everywhere to do what so the high priest must understand the ignorant and them that are out of the way so we needed a high priest that's gonna understand us because we were ignorant we were completely out of the way take efficiency blessed be the name of the lord take ephesians 2 so it's going to be clear ephesians chapter 2 if you dare you can say amen verse 10 for we are his workmanship created in who in christ jesus to water so you are programmed for good work you don't have to fabricate them you don't have to force them there is a good work that was program there is a software before you come in this world god took that software and loaded you up all you have to do is just turn the computer on and take your hand off the steering wheel put on automatic pallet and just watch the plane moving it's already loaded to take you from a to b because when you are sealed you are still until the day of what your redemption all the way up its automatic talent take your hand off let him be the one doing the driving lead nothing to their own understanding but acknowledge him in all your ways before you do anything remember him that the one in control hallelujah we are his workmanship created in christ jesus to good work which god has before done what or damn that we should do what what else do you have to do what else do you have to do you were ordained before the foundation of the world to be exactly to live a christian life hallelujah do you control your breathing so why should you worry about how am i breathing huh okay do you control that one day we will talk about the subconscious and the conscience then you will see the parasympathetic and the sympathetic how it works in christianity no he's a doctor in christianity anybody just to lock somebody who's looking for headache amen let's go to verse 11. wherefore remember that you being in time past gentle in the flesh who are caught on circumcision by that which is called the circumcision the jews in the flesh made by hands they were intact that at that time you are without crust ignorant being alien from the commonwealth of israel ignorant out of the way and stranger from the covenant of promise having no hope no hope how can you bring a hope to somebody who doesn't have hope it's through abraham because abraham believed when there was no hope it's only abraham who could believe when there is no no hope and he can call things that are not as though they are only in abraham can you do that that's why he was we are the royal seed of abraham oh my god it's like a sermon pulling this way another one is pulling this way amen he said alien from the covenant stranger from the covenant of promise having no hope and without god in the world we were totally ignorant completely out of the way everybody clear but now in christ jesus you who sometimes were a pharaoh are made nearby the blood of christ for he is our peace who has made buff one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us so when these priests come he breaks the world of partition he said it is not about jews it's not about gentiles those things were in tap i was just bringing a message all of you are children of god hallelujah having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandment containing ordinances for to making himself of two one new man so making peace and that he may welcome sir both to god in one body by the cross having slain what the image the enmity thereby came and pushed peace to you which were a power of and to them that are near it's the devil he's having a wrong number so we are going through trouble time brothers and sister so just keep calm the airplane will be fine you're going to hear something from bumpy roads so what you're hearing we're going to the bumpy road amen so don't worry about it everything will be okay blessed be the name of the lord now with good relax keep your baby inflamed blessed be the name of the lord and came and preached peace to you which were far off i love this airplane and to them that were near for through him we both have access by one spirit to the father verse 19. now therefore you are no more stranger anybody here you are no more stranger and foreign but you are what fellow citizens with descent and of the household of who so when you go to heaven no complex with the jews [Music] when you go to heaven when you see a jew you don't who is abraham abraham that's really you no abraham actually is waiting for you when you look he say will you my brother how did you survive laudisha that was a pretty pretty bad age we cannot see anything how did you survive tell us about it you have to deal with homosexuals with this with the how did you make it blessed be the name of the lord so now we understand hebrew 10 brought this he said when he come into the word he says sacrifice and offering that word is not but a body has not prepared don't worry it happened back home so i know how to handle this you stay pastor while you understand certain things amen so now hebrew gave it so now the first high priest that was entered into the law entered by a major prophet that prophet was a priest that prophet was a leaver now we already explained to you that we have a new high priest the high priest is melchizedek melchizedek was made flesh in the man called jesus christ now melchizedek need to be introduced into the world if the first high priest of the levitical priesthood was introduced by a leaver who was a prophet his father was a levator his mother was a levert and nobody was him the melchizedek priesthood also must be introduced by a lever because god doesn't change god is predictable you can predict god and he happened on time that's why brother branham said when god healed one person that said he's locked if you approach him like that same person god is under obligation obligation to do the same thing you can predict god the first priest has to be washed by a lever and he the one who watched him nobody watched him he was a major prophet high caliber prophet his father was a leaver and his mother was a level and we have discovered now that our high priest is jesus christ so jesus must be introduced because a new living way must be introduced to us to bring us into perfection so if the first high priest was washed the second high priest must be washed there must be a leave up there and that leave us must be a prophet now we are connecting the dot but here who is that liver the bible saying looks verse chapter one verse five he said there was in the day of king herod the king of judah a certain priest named who zechariah so zechariah was a priest in other words zechariah was a liver everybody hallelujah the changing pattern of god of the course of arabia and his wife was the daughter of what the daughter of aaron so the high priest so we found out that the father of the the one who have to introduce the new high priest both of them are levered just like moses his father and his mother were liverpool we are now introducing to you the new high priest the high priest that came from heaven he must be introduced by a leaver the father of delivers must be also levite and that man must be a higher prophet hallelujah and her name was elizabeth but the angel said unto him fear not verse 13 zechariah for that prayer is heard and that wife elizabeth shall bear dear son and that shall call his name john and da shall have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth so we found john a major prophet up here father liver mother liver be he himself was supposed to be a priest because he was born in the lineage of aaron but god took him away he said this priesthood cannot combine with the old person you must go in the wilderness because the first prophet that introduced the levitical priesthood also went into the wilderness so you cannot stop stay here in the temple i must draw you away to the world today to match moses did i lose anybody no we're going this way so just saying amen verse 15 and he shall be grateful in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine no strong drink he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's water remember moses nobody watched him so nobody can watch john the baptist john the bastards must be watched himself by the pillar of fire that's why he must receive the holy ghost without anybody praying for him because nobody watched moses but yet moses have to watch aaron nobody watch john the baptist but john the baptist must watch jesus christ [Applause] [Music] hi god and many of the children of israel shall be turned to the lord their god and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of who elijah to turn the heart of the father to the water and the heart of the children did you see the bible saying that you must understand the punctuation of the bible [Applause] anybody clear so look read only a portion of malachi phone that belonged to john and he never read the second person because that belonged to william branama everybody cleared and the first major prophet that introduced the high priesthood in the levitical order was moses but the one who introduced melchizedek is elijah [Applause] no wonder god used that spirit first time because grace was coming through jesus christ ever clear because in the book of zechariah you'll see that there is seven candlestick and there is two olaf trees one on the right side and one on the left side and they ask who are these two they said these are the two anointed of revelation 11. which was moses and elijah so the levitical priesthood used moses but the melchizedek priesthood must use now elijah the prophet but that elijah was a priest his father a priest mother a priest major prophet have to introduce by a priest like the mother of the son of zebedee came he said i'm warning trophy something jesus said go ahead say can my children sit on the right side on the left side he said that one i cannot give it to you because under the candlestick there is two people standing on the right side and the left side one have to introduce the levitical priesthood the other one have to introduce the melchizedek priesthood the true spirit moses and elijah moses and elijah moses and allah and you'll see them in one transfiguration it's moses and elijah everybody here brother branham say under the feast of the trumpet that moses and elijah will go back to the jew because the jew rely on moses they gave jesus christ trouble because of moses now moses himself must come down and say i am the one who gave you the law but elijah must be there to introduce grace so the two priests ruled are coming together now moses and elijah going back to the jew to pull them out of the law and then to bring them grace the law came by me moses but grace was introduced by elijah [Applause] blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah so we found out now this priest has to be introduced by another prophet and that prophet has to be a high caliber the bible says when the messenger of john were departed he began to speak unto the people concerning john what went here to see in the wilderness for to see a weed shaken with the wind but what went you had to see a man clothing soft raymond behold there that are gorgeous apparel and live delicately are in king's court but what went here to see a prophet a level prophet like moses yeah i say unto you and much more than a prophet this is he of whom it's written behold i said my messenger before be before my that face isaiah which shall prepare that way before thee for i say unto you among those that are born of women there is no not a greater prophet than who john the baptist over there there is no prophet like moses to whom i speak face to face over here there is nobody that is like john the baptist those two prophets must be higher caliber prophet because they are introducing the high priest hallelujah our pride priest now is approaching he needs to be washed but which tribe must come the high priest we rabb let's go to hebrews 7. blessed be the name of the lord let's go to hebrews 7. now we must find the trap we know that the precursor the one who introduced him everything is perfect a prophet a prophet higher caliber higher caliber liver liver priest priest mother liver mother liver father liver father liver the difference is in the priest which high priest are you introducing this one aaron didn't bring perfection but this one is melchizedek here let's go to hebrews 7. now we're talking about this melchizedek for this melchizedek karma water king of salem and water so the high priest himself is king and priest [Applause] our high priest is king and peace that's why we must we were made king and priest because we are the children of the high priest if the high priest is king and priest the children also are king and priest we are after the order of mercy no beginning of days no ending of life we are eternal that's why he was god and his attribute hallelujah please stop the messiah who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the king and bless him to whom also abraham gave a tenth of powerful being first interpreted king of water righteousness and after that also king of water he is a peace he is a righteousness ever here which is king of peace verse 3 without father without mother without descent neither have the beginning of days no ending of life but married like the son of god and by the priest how amen oh my god jump to verse 11 if the therefore perfection whereby let the levitical priesthood for under it the people receive the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchizedek and not because after the order of aaron his perfection came through the levitical priesthood why do we need another priesthood but we know that the law could make nothing into perfection it was only to give us a better hope that's why we needed a different priesthood but is this priesthood coming through levi again because that's what the pharisees were waiting for that's where they miss god hallelujah hallelujah verse 12 for the priesthood being what changed there is made of necessity a change also of the water the law from grace everybody clear for he of whom these things are spoken pretend to another what a priest from another tribe a priest from another trouble i thought all the priests come from liver i thought god caused secret liver to be preached forever why is he bringing a priest from the another tribe liver didn't have the kingship we need to look because this priest is not only priest but he is king so he must enter through the entrance of king so which tribe is responsible for kingship let's flip them one by one blessed be the name of the lord amen hallelujah verse 13 for he of whom these things are spoken pertain to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar the jews missed god they didn't understand what god was doing they were doing things by ritual by repetition like parrot but lack the revelation that's why they could be baptized under moses but many of them god was not pleased with them because the word that was received was not mixed with faith it was not mixed with revelation they thought they following a man they didn't understand that man was following a light that's why paul falls paul say follow me as a follower so actually you are not really following paul but you are following the crowds that paul is following hallelujah amen verse 14 for it is evident that our lord sprang arose out of what judah of which tribe moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood judah bringing a priest yes god throughout the time was giving signal to israel that the priests will come from judah but israel was missing it amen blessed be the name of the lord the bible says here the high priest the first high priest that came from the liberty from the levitical priesthood his name was who aaron moses mother was married to his father liver liver you know that we already showed you yesterday the father of moses was a liver and his wife was liver so they marry in between the tribe to keep everything in order clear everything must be in order so they brought iran they brought moses and think god said moses is the major prophet it's a higher spirit i'm going to use him right here and aaron you're going to be the high priest so we expect to keep the levitical priesthood so aaron must marry a leaver but let's see who era mary do you know the wife of aaron came from wichita at the opening of the seventh year the bible became a you exodus 6 23 and aaron took him elishaba or elishaba whichever way you work daughter of amina sister of nation to wife what is that information telling me that's why i don't want to read this stuff i don't understand what it is god is hidden in genealogy [Music] is hidden in punctuation god is hidden in images god is hidden in numbers i wish i'll go to part three so you're going to see the numbering in the solomon temple number verse one we're talking about nation the uh uh a daughter of abinadab sister of nation so abhi nadab have nation as his son and his daughter was elishaba what is that telling me in number chapter 1 verse 1 the baba was numbering the children of israel according to their uh to the position that will reflect the zodiac he said of judah who nation the son of who aminadab so nation was from the tribe of judah to help you up a little bit stabilize you without two scriptures we're going to put more witness ruth chapter 4 verse 18 now these are the generation of fairies pharaohs begot hezron and hezron begot remy and when begot a minada did you see that i mean adam now you see him and i mean other begotten nation and nation begat who someone and someone begat who and boaz begat who and all that begat who and jesse begat who so the wife of the first high priest was from judah why did aaron mess up with another trouble why he didn't marry a wife from mexicali why he didn't marry a wife from them god was giving them signal that there is something i brought the priest but i don't have a king i am priest and king so take your wife from judah to balance me up a little bit i cannot only work with priest preached with my bring bring a little seed from judah so i feel comfortable in heaven when i see you i'm looking at believer and i'm looking at you okay that's good that's a lot of reflection of me [Applause] a man a man from liver must marry a daughter from judah to introduce the first high priest so if that happened in the introduction of the first high priest where the tribe of judah married somebody from the tribe of liver that must happen also at the introduction of the second high priest did i lose anybody blessed be the name of the lord amen it's the surgery my friend we are in a surgical procedure so hang tight you're not going to lose weight amen luke chapter 1 verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth here we found a marriage between judah and liver and the introduction of the first high priest that marriage must also happen to introduce the second high priest verse 27 to a virgin is passed to a man whose name was joseph comer of the house of what so the man here now is from the tribe of judah but the marriage must be between judah and liver so we're losing we're missing the tribe of lever now hallelujah and the virgin's name was mary verse 35 and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also the holy thing which shall be born of this shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth mary had a cousin her cousin was elizabeth but previously i showed you that elizabeth was a daughter of aaron so mary was from the tribe of liver another marriage between liver and judah but this time the man must come from judah over there the man came from liver the man came from liver he introduced delivered by this time the man must come from judah to introduce somebody from the tribe of judah the mathematics of god hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord let's go back to uh hebrews 7. i hope i'm soaring good brother blessed be the name of the lord what a trip when you look around you you see cloud amen amen it is yet far more evident for that verse 15 after the simulated of melchizedek there what priest because the priest must come from what from judah about here that's why one day david was hungry [Music] are we okay david was hungry he was in a case of emergency he was looking for bread he looked walmart was closed ever here target was closed all that stuff was closed god showed him he said there is a stop that is 24 hours up and then he said wait a minute that's the tabernacle jeffy went there he saw the priest that's it what's going on at this time say yes what's going on i'm hungry say david you hungry here say i am hungry the priest look he checked his bag no lunchbox he checked here nothing he said there is a problem in this entire house there is no other bread but work on only one kind of bread it is the show bread but the show bread belongs only to who [Music] was david a priest who gave david the permission to eat it and the priest never argued with david he never told david you're not a priest you cannot eat it he said did you consecrate yourself he said yes me and the young men not only me me and the young men deficit you you a king i understand no me and those that follow me [Applause] hallelujah me and those that follow me [Applause] he said david you know it's a show bread yes give it to me he brought the short bread he gave to david david cut it put it nothing happened and he didn't stop there he cut the same bread and gave it to his friend we don't care which trap they were coming out but as long as they follow david they have the right to the precloud don't care which country you are born you might be born in america you might be born in africa you might be born in new york in europe in asia that's not what the mother as long as we follow the high priest we have the right to enter the presence of god blessed be the lord of the lord thank you jesus for making a new and a living way where everybody can have access to the presence of the kingdom oh my god my my my my mind that's why in matthew chapter 12 the bible say and the time jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn and his disciple was hungry were hungry and begin to pluck up the ear of the corn and eat him and to eat but when the pharisees saw it they say unto him behold that disciple do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day and he said unto them have ye not heard david they were reading the thunders but they were not understanding the thunders they were reading the message book but this the supernatural element was still locked despite the revelation [Music] [Applause] they could cut court court code but there is no revelation of what they were coding and when the manifestation of the revelation happened they begin to get trouble why does he preach only this kind of stuff [Music] let me put the weapon back amen have you not read what defeated when he was hungry and they that were with him not only david hallelujah how he entered into the house of god and did eat the show bread which was not lawful for him to eat jesus acknowledged that it was not lawful for david to eat yet david ate it and nothing happened this mind cannot comprehend god don't reproduce an image of what you see in heaven moses make the caribbean what are you going to do yeah hallelujah neither for them which were with him he was not not only lawful for david even those that follow david but only for the priest yet david ate because he was god was telling them the true priest is coming out of judah i heed it from the devil so he can try believer all he wants that's a temporary solution amen because lifa was dealing with the branches of the tree when you cut a branch another branch comes you cut a branch another branch camp don't commit adultery don't steal don't do this by the worshiper is not perch so it will continue to bring branches branches but when the high priest was coming john the baptist come he said the axe is put at the root not on the branches that was the law the axis put at the root of the tree that is where the life is in other words there is a high priest that's gonna deal with sin on the very source of it and once that worshiper is punched there is no more desire for sin you don't have to worry about stealing you don't have to worry about anything because the axe was put on the root that's the ministry of melchizedek [Applause] my god this plane is tough today hallelujah hallelujah verse 5 oh have you not read in the law how that on the sabbath day the priest in the temple profaned the sabbath and are blameless what are you going to do that's why brother franco can send a text to a deacon about what is going on in the church and he's blameless [Applause] [Music] so they brought me the bazooka sorry about this no problem the devil is in trouble blessed be the name of the lord i told you that a bazooka amen that's why brother franco can send a text because brother branham said you should not pass note in the church today we don't have note but the text is an electronic note the word will continue to handle the devil even if he changed form the world is continuing to catch him because he was a word meant for this age if you change text to electronic he's still a note so that could still apply anybody but if a priest is doing his priest work he's blameless if you do it it's sin if brother franco does it god doesn't see it that's why the priest can blaspheme the sabbath and the blameless [Applause] that's why a deacon can talk to another deacon and he's blameless because he's profaning the sabbath under service god doesn't look at that [Music] don't worry my friend you can chew that one later hallelujah hallelujah so now we jesus is introduced but there is another high priest caiaphas is there now we are in the junction in the blending and a high priest and a high priest one must go everybody here because jesus is talking caiaphas is talking it's like a blending between laodicea and the broad age it's like in goshen goshen was in egypt yet he was not part of what was going on in egypt it's an age within an edge anybody here so we got two high priests one must give away what happened so they take the new high priest and they take him to the natural night high priest what happened the bible say in mark chapter 14 verse 53 and the lord jesus our high priest a way to the high priest they took the high priest to the high priest now the two high priests meet what a clash about here and with him we're assembling all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked jesus saying our da answer it that means nothing what is this which they which this witness against me but he held his peace everybody clear and answered nothing again the high priest asked him when jesus was there they were accusing him of certain things and the scripture plainly told us that what they accused jesus was false because they took people and they hired them so against the false accusation jesus never spoke anything as long as what they told you about me is false i don't have to answer you can continue to believe that i know me and my high priest but then the high priest changed the question and began to ask him about his messiahship about who he was not what the people say but i'm asking you who you are then the mouth of jesus open up that's why paul say if paul if not paul peter he said be ready to give an answer to them that want to know the hope that is coming from thee not the gossip leave them alone they won't understand you everybody clear and again the high priest in green asked him and said to him or da day christ ah now the rubber meet the road everybody our dad the crush the son of the blessed and jesus said amen you just never say humbly you know we must be humble we must be humble eh we must be humble don't be too proud no no no no no no ask me who i am can you ask me are you mr shamble and i'm i'm saying maybe [Laughter] are you chad lamb yes i am right when they say children you say hello because brother branham said the sweetest sound that you have is the sound of your name that's something else amen you're pulling left and right that's the problem i'm trying to stay on the road amen blessed be the name of the lord he said i am jesus said i am and you shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in cloud of heaven the mind of caiaphas went to a stroke not only is he saying he's the king he's also giving me his position in the tabernacle of heaven that carefuls you hear on the earth my tabernacle is not pitched by men my temple is over there and sooner you're going to see me sitting there [Applause] hallelujah what did the high priest do and the high priest did what he ranked his clothes why he didn't say man why renting his clothes why should he only renting his clothes why he didn't offense the bible is a prophetic book my friend amen in leviticus 21 verse 10 the bible says and he that is the high priest among his brethren upon who's the head upon whose head the anointing always poor and that is god sequed to put on the garment remember the steps shall not uncover his head nor rend his what [Applause] so careful by renting his clothes disqualify himself are you there he look he said no no no this is another priesthood he disqualified himself establishing the melchizedek priesthood on earth now now melchizedek is in full charge the high priest is gone he disqualified himself because melchizedek have rose out of judah isn't he yeah me [Applause] oh my god let's go to hebrew can i handle this ship oh my god i don't want to get you to a crash it won't happen amen and it is 4 verse 15 evident yet for is it is far it is yet far more evident for that after the simulated the likeness of melchizedek they rise of another priest who is made not after the law of corner commandment ever clear but after the power of an endless life my god jump to verse 21 now watch this amen for those priests here go to verse uh 20. and he's in as much as not without enough he was made a priest in other words he was made a priest with an oath why for those priests were made without enough so this priesthood come with enough that's why in revelation 10 when the angel come there is enough here hallelujah but do this with enough by him that said to him the lord's soul and will not repent you are a priest forever after the order of who melchizedek by so much was jesus made a surety guarantee that's why they have to put off to tell you that this priesthood you have 100 guaranteed if you enter here that's it case over anybody clear surety of a better testament and they truly were many priests [Music] there were many priests but melchizedek have only one high priest because the high priest never died and you can never change him he remained a priest forever because he didn't have beginning of days no ending of life he's a man that ever lives with him it's a permanent priesthood you don't have to worry about this high priest dying and everything because in the city of refuge you have to enter there and remain there until the high priest died but this one doesn't die so when you enter there forever secure forever if your enemy keep waving i'm waiting for the high priest to die he doesn't die until your enemy himself dies and the high priest continues on and our enemy will be dead in the lake of fire and we will continue through eternity because we are perfectly natural perfect [Applause] be the name of the lord job to verse 23 and they truly were many priests because they were not permitted to continue by reason of what but this man because he continues ever has enough unchangeable priesthood you can never change this anymore it was locked sealed forever everybody clear blessed be the name of the lord verse 26 verse 25 wherefore because the priesthood is unchangeable what does it mean wherefore he is able also to save tudor he's going to bring you to complete redemption everybody here he doesn't just purge you purge your conscience from sin and leave you there because the black dog is still in the body he must deal with the black duck that takes the second banquet of esther to kick the black dog out here he must go all the way to the day of redemption until you reap the full redemption which will change the body everybody ever clear to the other most that come to god by him seeing he ever liveth to make an intercession for them for such a high priest became us in other words is proper for us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sin and made higher than the heaven who need not daily ask the high priest to offer up sacrifice first for his own sin and then for the peoples for this he did how many times when he offered up who case over that's why when jesus died he said it is that's it that's it that's it everybody so now let's head straight to the direction that's why this high priest when he introduced john is there john is waiting for him because the high priest must be what washed brother branham saying john thought yes here is the sacrifice the sacrifice must be where did john learn that who told him that the sacrifice must be washed before it is presented then he say come on and he baptized him about here washing the first high priest amen other word he behoove us to fulfill all righteousness in influence that john turn knowing as a servant of god as the prophet he must fulfill the word of that hour because he know if that that was the sacrifice he had just said so there cometh the lamb of god why did john call him the lamb did you see a lamb walking he was a human being when they said behold the lamb of the tribe of jew that they thought there was an animal coming they saw somebody coming up and john recognized him because john was with him on the earth amen hallelujah he was not an animal he was a human being because an animal cannot take the book you need a human hand everybody clear there come the lamb of god the sacrificial lamb that is going to take away the sin of the world and the lamb had to be washed in the everybody in the level before it's presented to the that's why john oliver prophet major like moses must be the one washing the lamb and if you wash the lamb according to the old testament you must change his garment and you must anoint him and then he's ready for the ministry and after the baptism of jesus was he anointed hallelujah look three now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that jesus also being baptized washed by a leviticus by by a priest and praying the heaven was water open and the holy ghost the anointing is coming after the washing in the lava in a level the anointing of god descended in the bodily form like a dove upon him now he's ready for the service anybody here and a voice came from heaven which said the heart my beloved son indeed i am where they watched the sacrifice they watched the high priest they anointed him that's why he started his ministry at 30 after being watched now he's ready to enter the ministry after 10 38 how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the water he must be anointed because the old high priest was anointed anointed him with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all the people that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him we found the same pattern the high priest must come washed anointed we changed the garment he's ready for the service but you can watch now something else not him anymore but you can wash also his his hand or his because one time he went in the house of someone and he's is somebody sleeping do you know who washed his feet a woman what a child that woman had how many devils why seven so jesus took seven out how many does jesus have to put there how much holy ghost have you put there because there were seven empty spots brother branham said mary magdalene was in the upper room because the bible said there were women there so they have to refill that tabernacle that church they're going through seven church ages seven kind of demonic when god removed he sent the constellation of seven ninja to take care of the seventh spot i'm not the one driving this plane hallelujah now the high priest is washed if the high priest is washed who was to be watched next the children of the high priest they give him the fullness of the holy ghost because he must carry the euro because he's the high priest he must have the full world amen but we have it in portion yet it's the same anointing so we also must go through the same process he said ye also as lively stone i'll build up a what a spiritual house a water a holy what after which priesthood the order of who do you see who you are do you see who you are you can intercede from someone you can even make order you can comment amen do you know that moses made the law and finish it and there was one law missing right according to moses law if you die the son take their name you die the son take the inheritance one law was missing moses thought the lord was finished a man went he prayed god god i want my wife to have a child math child woman he said no the next one i need a boy a woman the third one woman the fourth woman the fifth woman the men say forget about it i deal with women everybody else here and the man died [Music] who's going to get his inheritance that's right who the anchor the daughter said when cola revoked we rebelled our father was nothing let's go see moses women five women grace let's go see moses praise god moses he said what's going on my little children say how did you sleep oh i sleep where you know this old age are you okay okay did you eat some breakfast yes yeah by the way what's going on sit down say say what's going on say moses you know you made the law we believe that oh praise god hallelujah i'm proud of you girls you say but we have one problem okay what's the problem did somebody attack you or somebody's trying to marry you no no no no our father died he never disrespected you he always respected you when everybody rebelled against brother branham he respected you he never said anything bad on facebook he was not there on this crazy website arjun okay we have a problem we don't have a man who's going to take the handling we want to take the inheritance but your words say no man no women what does he scratch he said he said i never thought about it so since it's not my word let me go to the one that gave the word [Applause] moses went what other god said hey moses how are you doing say i'm doing fine father what's bringing you up here say i have a problem what's problem it's a hard one there's nothing too hard for me moses i know father but this one i'm conor what's going on he said i have a family there five daughters nothing they're looking for the inheritance of their father so when i gave you the testimony those daughters are right yes what does he say really yes they're right there was something hidden on the back part [Applause] but it is not time for this kind of stuff yet but their faith is pulling so hard man what can i do okay make a new law father make a new law but i already finished the law they're going to look at me like i'm changing now laws i told them you and they are changing god hallelujah god sent isaiah one time he said god tell king uzziah king water uh hezekiah you're gonna die i say i went with the anointing that says the lord prepare your house you're gonna die hezekiah say i know i can have access to the same god he turned around he said father look how i live what have i done wrong god said 15 years he said but you already said that saved the lord go tell him to come back here isaiah was going thank you jesus say isaiah turn around yes father what is going on go tell him 15 years oh everybody was present go tell him 15 years seed of abraham can stretch god did you hear me did you hear me that's why abraham was sitting with god and pleading he said what about 50 what about 40. what about 10 he was narrowing god down and god's still going like keep going keep going keep going you don't know who you are [Applause] you don't know who you are the day you will understand god the day you will have a true revelation of god you can stretch it none of my children will remain in laodicea all of them will enter there [Applause] because moses and the old lord could say not even a hoof but me and the melchizedek under a perfect tabernacle if not even an animal who have a human being [Applause] none of my family will stay outside i would take all of them out you don't know who you are he said make a new law moses made a new law and then one day they say from now on if they travel this is what you do you can stretch it oh my god so we are a holy priesthood let me know brother child because this is like eternity a holy priesthood they keep pulling left and right it happened many times gps signal lost so i have to come back again vps signal last night i have to come back again i'm trying to stay on the highway anybody care and a holy priest to offer up spiritual sacrifice acceptable to god by jesus christ but you are a chosen generation a royal water a holy a peculiar that which belonged to the jews now it's to the gentiles hallelujah that you should show forth the presence of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time passed this is not the jews we're not the people this is not the jews but are now the people of god ever here which have not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy so since you went through the same process you were cleansed you were rob you were anointed you are now a new in the new priesthood now remember you need to keep your feet and your hand clean watch verse 11 dear beloved i beseech you as stranger and pilgrim a pilgrim you're going to be walking all right stranger in pilgrim abstain from water you already washed but abstain keep your feet in your hand from what we like from fleshly last which war against the water because the black dog is still there waiting for the redemption of the body so that water will continue to take care of your feet and your hand to keep the tabernacle clean but you are what she wants because the prayer because the worshiper once not twice perch once somebody's slowing me i'm trying to run faster amen they're worshipping one's perch has no more the conscience of sin jesus said be perfect even as the father in heaven is perfect here is the old testament out there the worshiper comes he knows he does something wrong he goes out and hunt and hunt him a lamb with a spot bring it to it wash in the level the hype we stand there at the altar here the priest then the high priest stand at the altar and take the lamb he examined it over there is no blemish on it nowhere i found in him norfolk remember brother preached yesterday amen while i was speaking and had called the prayer line and speaking on the reflection from the chicana glory to the star to the star to the sea of glass remember that yesterday the light was coming from the chicana glory to the seventh star the seventh star to the sea of glass where the sacrifice were washed was washed you know which represented water sinners the water of water so the sacrifice that were approached that was that were brought here but random say he represented the sinner the sea of glass where the sacrifice were washed on a pink wash by the water of the world then you have to get to hear the word before you can enter in because only one way you can approach god that is by faith is that right faith cometh by what hearing hearing what the word of god you must go to the level amen watching our conscience not to meet a man not to meet father not to meet mother not to meet baby that's all true we all do that but the first thing we got to come is god's avenue of approach we shall be washed when we heal the word of god anybody clear let me jump now clearly now brother uh uh ephesians says husband love your wife even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he must sanctify and cleanse it with the washing off the water by the water by the word the sea of glass you got to go through the level that he may present it to himself he's washing his own bra to present his own blood to himself to himself a glorious church not having spot or whatever spot speaks of sin which is purged once but wrinkles speaks of the body which is the aging of the body it is the redemption of the inner man and the outside man without spot taking the sin away without wrinkle changing your body that is complete redemption with that spot taking sin away with that wrinkle changing your body complete redemption by the water of the world so the word we receive not only purge you but that word is responsible to bring a translation of this body into an immortal temple it is a word of full redemption that's why the seal has to be broken oh any such thing that it should be holy and without blemish john 15 year clean through the word which i have spoken to you it is not a natural level anymore it is a spiritual level anybody clear because now we are dealing with a spiritual high priest about here john 17 17 sanctify them through the truth that word is what [Music] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen brother branham says because when they bring you to the priest you don't argue with the priest you don't discuss with the priest the priest does one thing to the sacrifice take him worship he doesn't have time to argue with you brother branham says we are not to come together to talk about the message we all come together to get in the message it is not a subject of argument i don't have time to waste on facebook who believe it or not i don't have time to discuss whether you believe it or not it is for me it is my water it is my love it is my sea of glass my purpose is to get into the water you don't believe me that's your problem i usually sit and i hear people talking and i have to discern if they're talking to argue i won't say anything if they're talking to prove themselves i won't say anything if i hear them they want to learn then i open my cargo because i won't spend my time giving you a hundred coat and you have intellectual knowledge here we are come to guarantee the message and the message is crushed [Applause] you want to go home deacon you heard them the message is passed here's the word that's the sea of glass today that's the level today that's right we are to get into it get benefit yes sir that is what we are supposed to do hallelujah why do we need a specific message why if i taught you a method this message it will not take no effect of you [Applause] i am not wired for a baptist message i was not programmed for luther i was not programmed for wesley when god sent me to laodicea there is only one message that can decode me that's why you are in denomination you are floating dead but the scripture says arise you that sleep is among the death not you that died because you were sleeping among the denomination they were not enough they didn't have the key to unlock you there was only one message that can unlock you when you heard it you recognize the message to be eager for your tea off and he began to tremble in heaven [Applause] because your theophany was part of melchizedek [Applause] hallelujah they can give you baptist message nothing you say it's good it's good but when they give the message our heart didn't burn within us as he was speaking it's like keep going keep going keep going brother keep going brother because something is keep bubbling is keep bubbling that is the real you [Applause] you gave me the bazooka hallelujah this is brad pan if moses taught the message of noah it would take no effect if jesus taught moses message it would take no effect because the predestinated sin [Applause] that are laying there that will only be water by that type of water that is give for that seed it is a specific message for a specific seed and a specific hour and time [Applause] you left the message that's not my problem that's not my problem if i leave the message is leaving with me when jesus went to hell he went with his theophany [Applause] that's why you heard brother branham say if he sent me to hell i would go to hell loving him how can you go to hell loving him hallelujah it won't grow any other condition it must be the condition that grows it it must be a specific word ever clear amen so how do we approach god faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of god that's being reflected from the holiest of holiest into the messenger of that age in solomon temple it gives the reflection those candles reflected in the light out in the brass level here the angel of the edge is reflecting into the water who this guy is in here that's why he can turn the he's reflecting somebody he's reminding you genesis 18. he's mordecai reflecting the king but he's not the king hallelujah amen reflecting this guy here reflecting his mercy brother branham what do you do to them i forgive them amen so where is the mercy seat now where is the mercy seat now where is the mercy seat now because whatever you burned here are binded over there if you lose it here i lose it where is the mercy city [Applause] you don't know who you are [Applause] i'm stretching you today hallelujah hallelujah his word his judgment his name all is reflected in here where you are separated by believing it let us draw nigh with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our heart sprinkling sprinkled from all evil conscience and our bodies washed with water hallelujah how tragic it is that this first stage did not listen to the spirit instead he listened to a man but thank god in the last stage there won't be a group rise up the true bride of the last age and she will listen to the spirit [Applause] if you predestinated you will listen god will force you to do it oh my god you say force oh my in that day of god's darkness the light will return by the pure world pure water and we'll return to the power of pentecost to welcome back the the lord jesus christ death was not only the seed of the false vine but even in the tuvan the world's equipping paralysis and impotence because they had already drifted from the unadulterated truth of the first few years after pentecost and no true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive than he is can you read it please increase the the the volume so they can hear the congregation he's what [Music] people suffer for lack of what i'm not talking about here malachi 4 came to turn there not the head sometimes i hit knowledge knowledge knowledge knowledge you don't know who you're talking about there is two different kind of knowledge go with the stature of a perfect man there is knowledge there so if knowledge is wrong go take it out why did god preach it if we don't need it amen what eve didn't understand they left the devil belittle his weapon amen his knowledge and adherence not only knowledge but ideas to the pure work of god ours sin by multitude of example in the old testament amen hallelujah let's see here let me jump onto this a little bit let me go down to the next one pure and adulterated oh hallelujah living soon for the sky amen because with that spot and wrinkle it's a word that take you into the rapture standing here your garment washed we're talking about the children of the high priest now washed by the water of the believing world hallelujah the word becomes blood and the word bled for you and you are washed in the bleeding word the word bleeding the life of god in the world the anointed level hallelujah and the word was bled for you that you might be watched from the filth of this prostitute denominational idea sticking in the message and cleanse and sanctify by the washing of the water of the world and make your mind and heart stay on god and on his word when you are washed you are cleaned by this word you must receive righteousness righteousness was god's desire for his children job 29 i put on righteousness and he clothed me my judgment was a robe and i died him psalm 132 let that priest be clothed with what so somebody must provide that righteousness here i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for he has clothed me with the garment of water and he has covered me with the robe of water as uh [Applause] because we wife as a bridegroom deck himself with ornament and as the brother dawned herself with her what joe it was a requirement for the high priest so if we are washed by the word what have to follow we must receive a new garment a righteousness must come by the same word roman one for i am not ashamed of the gospel of who christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every man that believed to the jew first and also to the greek for daring in that gospel in the crust of that hour their reign is the righteousness of god don't work our righteousness today he told us you never done it to begin [Applause] you will only with into it [Applause] amen and enduring is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written just shall live by what verse 6 of romans 4 even as david also described the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputed righteousness without in abraham not the jew the jew they got to work work work not melchizedek but here and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of what because after you receive the robe you must receive you must be sealed you must be anointed the holy ghost must come everybody philippians and be found in him not having my own which is of the but that which is through faith in of christ the righteousness which is of god by what you are washed you are robed in his righteousness and what followed them you must be anointed by that same word so their level is washing you putting you a robe and it's also built to fill you mark 10 and jesus said unto them you know not what you ask can you drink of the cup that i drink off and can you baptize with the baptism that i'm baptized with and they say unto him we can and jesus said unto them you shall indeed drink of the cup or that i drink off in other words you're going to suffer like me amen and with the baptism that i'm baptized with her shall he be what so if i suffer for christ i must also be filled it's not one way i cannot suffer and you don't feel me you say if i'm suffering for you i must also be filled it's a promise we are not only entitled to the suffering but we are also entitled to the spirit so you can't give me one and leave the other one it's a combo if you get one return it to mcdonald's say you miss my salad because i paid for it somebody paid for that in cavalry anybody care luke 24 and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but carry in jerusalem until you be undo with water you must stay until you get power you must have the holy ghost you are washed you are dressed you must be anointed ever clear anointed by what anointed by the word what stephen you say we receive the holy spirit by the word yes while peter yet speak this word the word [Applause] because the gentile faith doesn't let you know lying on him amen why peter yet spread this word the holy ghost fell on all of them which are there [Applause] it's a word that washes you a word that clothes you a word that fills you it does all of them it's a combo here galatians this only would i learn of you receive you the spirit by the work of the law comma or the hearing of what how do you receive the holy spirit the hearing offered they therefore the minister to you the spirit in other words that give you the spirit and work of miracle among you do he it by the work of the law or by the hearing of faith it is the healing of faith that fills you and does miracle in your life anybody here a word that wash you a word that rob you a word that anoints you and the word that puts you into service for word amen amen you cannot be put in the service without going through this process before you work for god before you minister for god you must be washed you must be robbed you must be anointed you must receive all of them before you start the service if you miss it you cause trouble but i'm saying and standing here with this bible on the sacred desk in the pink they pulp it come on the closest place to heaven on so the closest place to heaven on earth is what is the pulpit how do you enter in the pulpit hallelujah there is no preacher by god had never been ordained to stand behind the sacredness until first he has a conference with god and come upon the sacred stand where him and god alone stand you have no right to do it you have no right i don't care how much doctor degree you have that don't mean that much to god another thing you have you got to have a conference they have to have it there in other words nobody should preach this message without going through this process you cannot stand here preaching the message without the holy ghost you must be washed you're coming straight ahead sit down and learn everybody here no man has the right to enter the sacredness to preach the word until he has did as moses did meet god himself upon the ground where that there is no theologian can explain it away [Music] how can you believe the message today and 10 years you leave the message [Music] never met god never met god now you step on a pulpit never met god everybody here because somebody came and explained that god away from you but if you had an experience with that god there is nobody in this world that can take that away from you [Applause] hallelujah moses was there no matter how israel messenger said oh it was nonsense you just imagine you saw this this is nonsense you could not take that away from him he know it he was there he was the one he happened to you don't believe the cloud that's your problem [Applause] when jesus looked at thomas what did he say he said i understand you your faith is leader come and touch it if that will make you comfortable but let me tell you something if somebody never seen it and believe it he's more greater than you why is somebody explaining that away from you because you never met god at the level you were not washed you were not robbed you were not anointed you never had an experience yourself that's why they can wash that away from you 20 years you leave the message i know what it means amen when you are truly baptized into him the true evidence is that you believe him the word [Applause] amen how can you turn from the reveal word you never met him amen i'm skipping quickly now make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the holy ghost into the body of christ receive the fullness of the spirit will be in the word of the way you get here and you go out you didn't receive it it's hard stuff yes and you got to chew it sometimes we crack on bones anybody that is the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost judah fell multitude fell right there and when they fell they go in they're gone in their in that word the name are taken of the book of life if you are choosing if you are truly baptized with the holy ghost you will esteem his word above your necessary how can we give you 10 coat and you still don't see can we sit we give you 10 scriptures and you still arguing you can sit with minister you give them cut after code after call they reject everything because they have their own personal agenda so the world is not esteem they want their agenda to be done and because the agenda is not done they cannot humble themselves before the world lack of the holy ghost gift and calling without repentance [Music] the rich young ruler was gifted with an evangelistic gift he was in hell everybody clear and yearned to live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god everybody so far so let me head to the airport amen we are washed we are cleansed you wash you purge once but you gotta keep washing your your hand and your feet wide hand and feet mark seven and when they sow some of this his disciple eat bread with the fire that is to say we found wash hand they found fault for the pharisee and all the jews except they washed their hands off eat not holding the tradition of the elder and when they come from the market except the watch they eat not the point i'm trying to make here is there was something that was going on with the hand that was a part of you that make contact with the world anybody here amen next one john 13 sermon peter say unto him lord not my feet only you remember that but also my and ma jesus said unto him he that is what needed not self to wash his water because he's already purged you don't need to go ahead again being purged and being purged and being prayed the worshiper is purged one time but we are still living in the dirty world if we are still in lao laodicea like the brothers say we are still dealing with gm we are still dealing with our work and when you go there you make contact with the world your hand and your feet are making contact with the world but you are still baptized with the holy ghost so therefore when you come you remember not to be watched again but you got to watch the extremities the mystery of delivery hallelujah brother branham someone asked me the other day say why brother branham don't you believe in purgatory i say sure i believe in purgatory you stop here you see now sometimes when they give you a quote get it and go back to that message and start a little bit from the top to see the context brother branham was bringing out amen say well fine that is good so he thought about oh i got him now he's a catholic you see he believes it [Laughter] i said but i don't believe that after you die some preached to pray you out of it or some preacher so brother but i'm called it he corrected see that's not the way i'm saying it but i don't believe that after you die some preach to some preach to pray you out of it or some preacher i don't believe in the purgatory in a catholicism way amen i say i believe in purgatory sure purging your soul but we do that now when we do something wrong let's get down and have a purgatory say god cleanse me you are not lost you are just claiming the hands and the feet that made contact with the world hallelujah take the thing out of me purge me watch me make me new i believe in purging my soul yes sir i do that [Music] you clear now you wash once but you got to continue to wash your hand and your feet amen because you're living in laodicea you're going to make contact with the world and when you go back you got to purge yourself again amen not purging the inner man because he's already sealed until the day of redemption security ever here i am i am in purgatory daily then so just purging my soul every day before god ever here this tabernacle now belong to god almighty you belong to god almighty always keep yourself clean keep your hand on your feet clean keep your church with a level that's why we come to church you want to get there make sure it is clean keep keep it upright so that any who travel by my love to come in and fellowship with you have such a sweet spirit till you can reach out a hand to anyone and offer them help no matter how far they are down in a gather that is what they stand for a shrine of grace of god everybody here so far now let's head up and keep put your seat belt so we can go to the landing amen exodus 38 verse 8 and he made the level of brass when moses made the lever he needed the material the material was brass okay who gave him the material and he made the level of brass and the foot of it of brass of the looking glass of the so the lever that was built in the temple came from material from women and it was the looking glass of women because in the old time they used brass that was well polished when you look it's like a mirror so when moses was looking for the offering to make the lever the men didn't move it was the sisters they had some mirror that they used for their personal care those mirrors were individual mirrors that they use in their home when they take a shower they groom themselves they check themselves in that mirror before they come out and they took that tool and brought it to moses and moses took the mirror from this woman from this woman from this church from this church from this church from luther from paul from aurenus from columba from mountain and he blended all those mirrors together and he came up with a lever [Applause] so that level is a multimirror level it's a constellation level it's a level with seven angels and when they blend together you see who crushed of these looking glasses of the women assembling which assembly at the door of the weapon and that level was put where at the door so the women say this is our spot here so let's take our personal mirror let's put it here so the seal brass was not only a pool with water but it was also a mirror that when you get to that water if you want to enter the priest can stop by okay then he gets to the church if a woman is coming she can stand by and it's a mirror hallelujah buckle up james one for if any be a hearing of the word and not a doer he's like a man beholding his natural face in her this message is perfectly aligned with the scripture hallelujah second commenting but we all with open face beholding us in uh we're looking at the level when you're looking at the message when you're looking in the world you are looking at the sea of glass everybody clear as beholding a glass the water the glory of god so when you put yourself on the message you don't see you you're seeing something but that something is you [Applause] [Music] that is actually the true you not this man this is an envelope because the boy was looking at the mirror when he does this the mirror does this when he does this the mirror does this one time there was a mother who has a child that was dying he taught the child right and the child went into the world and backslid and went and got into a wrong crowd and got a social disease and the child was dying mama sat down

worked with the high priest keep calm you're gonna hear the the wheel hit the and then a safe landing amen and beholding as in the glass the glory of god are changed into the same image the image you're looking at is actually transforming you that's why you're not the same person you used to be after a while you turn around you say hey i was battling with that thing but it's gone i don't know when he left me all i know i'm not even upset anymore the way i used to be because you are looking in the sea of glass and the image you're looking at is changing you from glory to glory even as by the what spirit of the lord [Applause] proverbs 27 as in water face answer to what what was in the sea of glass so when you look there the face is talking to the face in the water saw the what the heart of man to who so when you look in there something is talking to your heart hallelujah safe landing examine yourself whether you be in there prove your own self know you know to your own self how that jesus christ is in you except you be reprobate that's why we constantly come before the mirror before the level to examine ourself amen because the breasts represent divine judgment if they represent divine judgment and he was sitting over there so judgment must begin well hallelujah slay orderly old young both made and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at ma you just begin at the house of the lord that's why peter said for the time has come that judgment the sea of glass must begin at the house of god and it and if it first began at us we were judged first but when you receive him you pass from death unto never to be judged again when you're standing before it it's not to be judged anymore it's just to wash your extremities and make sure your tie is good hallelujah hallelujah what shall the end of them of the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god amen the party the go ye out from dance touch not unclean thing go head from the midst of her be clean that bear the vessels of the lord the new priesthood god wants you to keep yourself clean but not being made free from now bring bread free from sin and become servant of god ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life having therefore these promises dear beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god for god has not called us unto uncleanness but unto what that's why we have to keep our vessel clean i want to look at me and i want you to look at yourself and as we look into god's great mirror of his word be able to identify ourself with some that we're going to speak to speak about some of the character of the other time like the woman should look in the mirror of god and she found herself because this breaking of the seven seal he broke to do what to make you preached and to make you king because our priesthood our high priest is priest and he is
