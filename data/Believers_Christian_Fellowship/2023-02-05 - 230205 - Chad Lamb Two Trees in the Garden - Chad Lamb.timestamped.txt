[3:41] and so she packed up her camels and went
[3:46] to see
[3:48] if the things that she had heard she
[3:53] could believe
[3:56] and in her journey there were dangers
[4:00] along the way
[4:03] but she had to see this man and hear
[4:07] what he had to say
[4:10] so even
[4:12] though the way was rough and hard Lord
[4:18] the day finally came for her prayer
[4:24] card
[4:27] and when she stood before
[4:31] the king
[4:35] he told her everything

[4:53] restored she gave all her gifts to him

[5:17] he did reveal
[5:21] [Music]
[5:24] foreign
[5:25] and in our day a man came on the sea
[5:31] with a gift of discernment
[5:35] and prophecy

[5:43] pointed to Christ

[14:16] say my name
[14:20] we bow before
[14:23] your face
[14:25] [Music]
[14:39] man let's look at Genesis chapter 2.
[14:43] verse 8.
[14:52] and the Lord God planted a garden
[14:54] Eastward in Eden and there he put the
[14:56] man whom he had formed
[14:58] and out of the ground may the Lord God
[15:00] to grow every tree that is Pleasant to
[15:02] the side and good for food the tree of
[15:04] life also in the midst of the garden and
[15:06] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[15:08] amen God bless you as you take your
[15:11] seats
[15:12] you know we find everything begins in
[15:14] Genesis we talked about this last week
[15:16] and my brother Branham said that we
[15:18] believed it you know like everything
[15:20] else he says we believe it but the
[15:22] realization of it keeps sinking in
[15:24] deeper and deeper of what this word is
[15:27] and what God's mind is on it and how God
[15:29] is continually unfolding himself through
[15:32] the word
[15:34] and last Sunday I took a title two trees
[15:38] in Eden I believe that was the title
[15:41] something like that and this morning I'd
[15:42] like to take for a title two trees in
[15:45] the garden
[15:47] we want to write that down two trees in
[15:49] Eden and two trees in the garden
[15:54] and uh
[15:57] and so we know that God had created Eden
[16:00] and Eden means pleasure this was God's
[16:03] pleasure it was his desire but then
[16:06] within Eden within his desire within
[16:08] pleasure he had planted a garden
[16:11] and in that Garden
[16:13] he would place his son and eventually
[16:16] his son's wife would come from within
[16:18] him and come into manifestation and they
[16:21] would be there and God would have
[16:24] fellowship with them but in that Garden
[16:25] in his garden in his pleasure within his
[16:30] pleasure he had a garden So within Eden
[16:32] he had a garden and within that Garden
[16:34] he was going to place his son and his
[16:36] son's bride but within there he also
[16:38] placed two trees
[16:40] the tree of life and we know the tree of
[16:42] knowledge of Good and Evil which brings
[16:44] death which is the tree of death so it's
[16:45] the tree of life and the tree of death
[16:47] were in God's Garden
[16:50] and
[16:52] in in verse 16 we go on to set read here
[16:55] and the Lord God commanded the man
[16:58] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[17:00] mayest freely eat but if the tree of the
[17:02] knowledge of Good and Evil thou shall
[17:04] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[17:05] eatest thereof
[17:07] Thou shalt surely die
[17:09] so that's how we know it is a tree of
[17:11] death because the result of taking this
[17:13] tree is death
[17:15] now if we look at the word Garden that's
[17:17] used in here
[17:18] we've read it several times in the in
[17:20] the couple passages we read in the in
[17:23] the Lord God planted a garden Eastward
[17:25] in Eden this word Garden
[17:28] uh is the word an I don't know if I
[17:31] pronounced that right but g-a-n is what
[17:33] it shows in the concordance it's a
[17:35] Hebrew word and it means Garden or
[17:37] enclosure
[17:39] an enclosed garden and and also the
[17:42] definition that's in the concordance
[17:44] when you look at this is taken from
[17:45] Strong's Concordance you have the
[17:47] definition one Garden enclosure one a
[17:50] enclosed Garden one a one it says
[17:54] figurative of a bride
[17:58] figurative of a bride
[18:01] and so this is most easily seen in Song
[18:04] of Solomon so if you'll turn with me to
[18:05] Song of Solomon we want to read from
[18:07] chapter 4.
[18:13] Psalm of Solomon Chapter 4
[18:21] and I'm going to begin reading from
[18:22] verse 12.
[18:28] chapter 4 verse 12.
[18:32] this is a garden enclosed is my sister
[18:36] my spouse a spring shut up a fountain
[18:39] sealed so here we know that Song of
[18:42] Solomon is a love story between the
[18:43] bridegroom and the bride and he's
[18:46] calling her a garden enclosed well the
[18:48] word Garden means an enclosure
[18:52] or something that is enclosed or
[18:56] protected and then this is a garden
[18:58] enclosed and this word enclosed is is a
[19:02] stronger meaning it means barred or
[19:04] locked so not only is it uh in in the
[19:08] garden is protected but it's also locked
[19:11] and sealed this is this is showing the
[19:14] virginity and the purity of the Bride
[19:16] but also that God has walled her and God
[19:19] has sealed her
[19:21] the garden enclosed is my sister my
[19:23] spouse a spring shut up a fountain
[19:25] sealed thy plants are an orchard of
[19:28] pomegranates with Pleasant fruits
[19:30] campfire and spikener and Spike nerd and
[19:33] saffron and plumbus and cinnamon with
[19:36] all trees of Frankincense myrrh and
[19:38] aloes with all the chief spices
[19:40] a fountain of gardens a well of Living
[19:42] Waters and streams from Lebanon
[19:45] now the bride speaks in verse 16 so the
[19:47] bridegroom speaking and he's describing
[19:50] the bride she is a she's a Walled Garden
[19:54] she is a a separated garden and she's
[19:57] barred and she's sealed then he starts
[19:59] to to talk about all the the fruits that
[20:02] are in her all the fragrances that are
[20:04] within her and then she speaks and says
[20:07] awake o North Wind and Come Thou South
[20:09] blow upon my garden that the spices
[20:11] thereof May flow out let my beloved come
[20:14] into his garden and eat his Pleasant
[20:17] fruits
[20:18] chapter 5 verse 1 the bridegroom now
[20:21] speaks and says I am come into my garden
[20:23] my sister my spouse I have gathered my
[20:28] myrrh with my spices I've eaten my
[20:29] honeycomb with my honey I've drunk my
[20:32] wine with my milk eat oh friends drink
[20:34] yay drink abundantly oh beloved
[20:37] so here you have this whole imagery of
[20:40] the garden again so it's amazing how
[20:43] much the garden shows up in the Bible
[20:46] in the beginning there was Eden and God
[20:48] planted a garden Eastern and Eden so
[20:50] it's a special place within Eden that's
[20:53] enclosed and and we know brother Benham
[20:55] said that the devil slipped under the
[20:57] gate he climbed over the wall so we know
[20:59] that this Garden was this Garden was
[21:02] protected and we know that she was
[21:04] protected by the word
[21:06] and so now uh uh we have a garden in the
[21:11] beginning it's amazing that we have a
[21:13] garden that now the bride is described
[21:15] as a garden and a garden is figurative
[21:17] of the Bride figurative language of the
[21:19] Bride As Seen in song of Solomons and
[21:21] now the bride she's enclosed in the word
[21:24] and she's been sealed amen but there's
[21:26] one who gets admittance into the garden
[21:29] amen into the secret amen I remember as
[21:31] a boy I read The Secret Garden well this
[21:33] is the secret garden that one gets to
[21:36] have access to because she's barred and
[21:38] she's sealed amen and that one is the
[21:40] bridegroom and she's inviting the
[21:42] bridegroom to come into the garden
[21:44] she wants all of uh that he wants her
[21:47] and he and he and he put within her amen
[21:51] so much is within her that he desires
[21:54] and is desirable to him and now she's
[21:56] calling for the north within the South
[21:58] to blow amen that the fragrance of the
[22:00] spices amen which he planted in her will
[22:02] come out and he's inviting she's
[22:04] inviting him into her garden Amen to
[22:07] partake of his pleasure his desire amen
[22:10] so all of this is so figurative and it's
[22:13] amazing that that Jesus surrenders in
[22:16] the garden
[22:17] Gardner Gethsemane and Jesus is buried
[22:20] in a garden and he resurrects in a
[22:22] garden and and he's supposed to be the
[22:24] gardener amen all of these things are
[22:26] not in vain but he is the great Gardener
[22:29] and he is the one who's planted a garden
[22:30] and he sealed that garden and he's the
[22:33] one that has access to the garden
[22:37] so so when God initially in the
[22:40] beginning of our bible plan in a garden
[22:43] Eastward in Eden
[22:45] and in that Garden there was two trees
[22:49] and we begin to to think about
[22:54] you know I thought so many times on why
[22:56] two trees you know and we've talked so
[22:59] many times about if we had it to do and
[23:01] it was my children
[23:02] would would you put those two trees
[23:05] there and I could say in my human mind
[23:07] and my human self I wouldn't
[23:09] I wouldn't put the tree of knowledge and
[23:11] good and evil there I would I would I
[23:13] would not even allow it to exist
[23:16] but that wasn't what God wanted there
[23:18] was another purpose to all of this and
[23:20] God in his great understanding his great
[23:22] mind in order to be expressed and for
[23:25] the benefit of all the attributes he had
[23:27] to allow things to go a certain way so
[23:29] that there would be an understanding
[23:30] that there would be a knowledge and a
[23:32] protection because you know the God had
[23:36] put them in a garden and he put them
[23:37] behind the wall of the word but the but
[23:40] the devil found a way under the gate
[23:43] over the wall through the door however
[23:45] you want brother bam uses all those
[23:47] terms right but really what happened is
[23:50] is the woman opened the door she she
[23:53] allowed him access he said she stuck her
[23:55] neck out from behind the wall they
[23:57] stepped out from behind the wall he uses
[23:59] all of these Expressions to let you know
[24:01] that though God had a wall amen God's
[24:04] children were able to to open the door
[24:07] to to to go around the wall amen so God
[24:11] it's not always that God is always going
[24:13] to shelter and protect because he knows
[24:15] amen you can't always be sheltered and
[24:17] protected sometimes he'll he'll let you
[24:20] taste of that bad fruit so that you know
[24:23] the consequences of coming out from
[24:25] behind the wall so now he can put a wall
[24:27] in place that he doesn't have to trap
[24:29] you in but he can put a wall in place
[24:31] that you will willingly stay behind
[24:35] that's kind of the purpose of the whole
[24:37] Bible
[24:38] it's kind of the purpose of the fall and
[24:40] all of these things is that so there was
[24:43] a deception that fell in heaven and and
[24:45] the Angels were deceived and many of
[24:48] them and they fell when Lucifer found
[24:50] you would think we talked about this
[24:52] that heaven was a safe place but heaven
[24:54] was a dangerous place
[24:56] and you would think that nearer to God
[24:58] you got the safer it was but nearer to
[25:01] God was a dangerous place because that's
[25:02] where Lucifer was
[25:04] he was a covering cherub
[25:06] and so and he was perfect in Beauty
[25:09] perfect in wisdom full of beauty he was
[25:12] made marvelous he was made Splendid and
[25:14] God made him that way
[25:17] and Michael was also uh uh made by God
[25:21] he was also expressing something and
[25:23] brother bear said he was expressing the
[25:24] kingdom of Christ the kingdom of Michael
[25:26] and he says that Lucifer thought he
[25:28] could build a better Kingdom than
[25:30] Michael's humble Kingdom so in heaven
[25:32] you had one that was considered a humble
[25:34] Kingdom and you had one that was
[25:35] Splendid and marvelous and spectacular
[25:39] so you had two in heaven amen and and
[25:42] there was Angels who made a choice and
[25:44] they were deceived by following the one
[25:46] and not the other but you know if God
[25:48] had word on Earth he had his word in
[25:50] heaven
[25:51] so they had to leave the word they had
[25:53] to be deceived on some part of the word
[25:56] in order to fall amen and then they fell
[25:59] and now now God is putting his attribute
[26:03] his own son Amen in the garden on Earth
[26:06] and and he knows that the Lucifer is I
[26:09] said at large if we could say it that
[26:11] way
[26:13] and his nature is not going to change
[26:15] his tactics aren't going to change he he
[26:17] wants to he wants to circumvent God's
[26:19] plan he wants to rise higher than God
[26:21] himself amen and he's still there and
[26:24] and it's amazing at the fall in heaven
[26:27] why didn't God just annihilate Lucifer
[26:34] I Can't Tell You Why
[26:37] more likely than not he's restrained by
[26:39] his own law in some way
[26:40] there's a plan that has to unfold it
[26:43] serves God's purpose why or how I don't
[26:45] know but God is always working according
[26:47] to his word
[26:49] his nature never changes he doesn't
[26:52] change he's just and he's righteous and
[26:54] he's holy he's a vengeful God he's a
[26:56] merciful god and is is he's never
[26:58] changing so why he didn't annihilate him
[27:01] I don't know probably had something to
[27:03] do with a restraint in his word
[27:05] that's just brother Chad I don't know
[27:07] but we know it serves his purpose we
[27:10] know that undoubtedly
[27:12] and so he knew that he would come into
[27:14] the garden and and there was two trees
[27:16] there was a choice there was free moral
[27:18] agency and they could choose between the
[27:21] two and they were in close proximity to
[27:23] one another they were in the midst of
[27:25] the garden amen and and they they could
[27:28] have been touching
[27:30] their limbs could have grown into one
[27:32] another I don't know how close they were
[27:34] but it was pretty close in heaven
[27:37] so now it's pretty close on Earth in
[27:40] God's garden and and now when when the
[27:44] woman was deceived and the servant began
[27:46] to speak to her she began to analyze the
[27:48] tree and in her analysis of the trees
[27:51] she couldn't find anything wrong with it
[27:53] it was pleasant to the eye good for food
[27:55] a tree to be desired to make one life
[27:57] she couldn't find the problem and the
[28:00] problem wasn't apparent in the tree the
[28:02] problem was hidden in the tree
[28:05] it was a product of eating the fruit it
[28:08] wasn't apparent inside amen but it
[28:10] became obvious after partaking
[28:13] and that's the thing with God's word
[28:15] what's different than our human
[28:17] reasoning is sometimes in our reasoning
[28:19] and understanding we can't see what's
[28:21] wrong with a certain thing amen from the
[28:24] word of God but it doesn't matter
[28:26] whether we can find the wrong or the
[28:28] error in it or not amen the problem
[28:30] becomes evident sometimes after we've
[28:33] partaken
[28:36] so God has placed them on freedom World
[28:39] agency he's given them a choice in the
[28:41] garden and they can choose to partake of
[28:44] these two trees
[28:46] and and the woman being deceived she
[28:50] partakes of the tree of knowledge of
[28:52] Good and Evil becomes a tree of death
[28:53] and she herself becomes a tree of death
[28:55] and the fruit that comes from her is
[28:57] destined for death
[28:59] we are born dead because she took of
[29:01] that fruit and she became a tree of
[29:04] death
[29:06] and so now we we
[29:10] see
[29:12] that there was two in heaven
[29:15] there was I say light and darkness Good
[29:18] and Evil
[29:19] two on Earth in God's Garden
[29:22] and the garden Eastward in Eden
[29:25] tree of life and a tree of death light
[29:27] and dark
[29:29] but now we are God's Garden
[29:33] the bride is his garden
[29:36] and I think if you'll look with me
[29:38] you'll realize there's two trees in this
[29:40] Garden
[29:42] we talked Sunday about how close
[29:45] deception is it may be closer than we
[29:48] realize
[29:50] we always want to put deception in the
[29:52] Catholic Church
[29:54] we may even want to put perception
[29:56] deception in the pulpit
[29:59] but deception lies within us
[30:03] Lucifer was deceived by his own
[30:06] brightness
[30:08] so where did Lucifer's Deception come
[30:10] from it came from within him
[30:12] he deceived himself by his own wisdom
[30:15] his own brightness his own wisdom his
[30:17] own Beauty his own greatness and he was
[30:20] self-deceived
[30:22] there was nobody else deceiving Lucifer
[30:24] Lucifer deceived himself
[30:27] and we realized now that in his garden
[30:31] in this Earthly existence that we walk
[30:33] in there are two trees
[30:36] there's light and dark
[30:38] there's good and evil
[30:41] it's become a tree of Good and Evil
[30:44] let's go to Romans chapter 7. take a
[30:47] look at some scripture
[30:54] Romans chapter 7 look at verse 14.
[30:59] this is the Apostle Paul
[31:02] ministering to the Romans
[31:05] in chapter 7.
[31:08] verse 14.
[31:12] for we know that the law is spiritual
[31:14] but I am carnal so to understand
[31:16] for that which I do I allow not for what
[31:19] I would that do I not but what I hate
[31:22] that do I
[31:23] if then I do that which I would not I
[31:25] can send unto the law that it is good
[31:27] now then there's no more I that do it
[31:29] but sin that dwelleth in me for I know
[31:32] that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth
[31:34] no good thing for to will is present
[31:36] with me but how to perform that which is
[31:38] good I find none for the good that I
[31:41] would I do not but the evil which I
[31:43] would not that I do now if I do that I
[31:47] would not it is no more I that do it but
[31:49] sin that dwelleth in me I find that a
[31:52] law that when I would do good evil is
[31:54] present with me for I Delight in the law
[31:57] of God after the inward man but I see
[31:59] another law in my members worrying
[32:01] against the law of my mind and bringing
[32:03] me into captivity to the law of sin
[32:04] which is in my members o Wretched Man
[32:07] that I am who shall deliver me from the
[32:10] body of this death I thank God through
[32:13] Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the
[32:15] mind I myself serve the law of God but
[32:17] with the flesh the law of sin
[32:21] yeah the Apostle Paul is saying a lot
[32:25] and we've experienced what he's speaking
[32:28] of
[32:29] and in 1964 there was a questions and
[32:31] answers in August that brother Brandon
[32:34] was doing and he gets this question and
[32:36] and has somebody quote a portion of the
[32:38] scripture that we just read they quote
[32:40] and we say that we know the law
[32:42] spiritual but I'm carnal Soul under sin
[32:44] for that which I would not uh I would do
[32:48] not for what I would that I would not
[32:50] but what I hate I do if then I do that
[32:53] which I would not
[32:54] I can send unto the law that it is good
[32:57] now then there's no more I that do do
[33:00] with it but sin that dwelleth in me this
[33:02] I cannot understand this is somebody's
[33:04] question they quote the scripture and
[33:06] behind it said this I cannot understand
[33:10] it's hard to comprehend sometimes
[33:12] but then this is Brother branham's
[33:14] answer
[33:15] say well they wrote out the scripture
[33:17] that's Paul speaking to the Romans
[33:19] now he said just me kinda just kind of
[33:22] Polish it up so you can see he said in
[33:25] me is two persons this is Brother
[33:27] Venom's answer
[33:29] he's explaining the scripture he said
[33:31] let's just let me read it again he said
[33:34] let me just kind of Polish it up so you
[33:36] can see so he's going to rephrase it
[33:39] he said in me as two persons right one
[33:42] wants me to do wrong the other wants me
[33:45] to do and every time I start to do right
[33:47] then wrong hinders me
[33:49] amen
[33:51] brother says you are an outward man
[33:53] which is controlled by six senses you
[33:55] are an inward man controlled by one
[33:56] sense which is Faith and this Faith
[33:58] disagrees with all six senses if the
[34:00] sixth senses doesn't agree with faith
[34:02] but one is contrary to the other now as
[34:05] long as the six senses agree with faith
[34:07] wonderful but when the senses six senses
[34:10] disagree with faith then leave the six
[34:12] senses alone
[34:13] now for instance here Jesus made a
[34:15] statement a promise the inside man says
[34:18] that's true the outside man reasons that
[34:20] it can't be true to you then ignore the
[34:23] outside man and accept the Inside Man
[34:25] now that's the same thing that Paul's
[34:27] speaking of he was sold under the law to
[34:29] carnal sin every one of us is the same
[34:32] that's the reason we have the troubles
[34:34] we do of married four or five times and
[34:36] this and that and all kinds of sin and
[34:38] adulteries and everything else along in
[34:40] our lives is because of those things we
[34:42] are carnal and that part must perish but
[34:45] then inside we are a spirit Man soul
[34:47] inside that's faith in God's word
[34:50] then we bring our outside body under
[34:53] subjection to the word by Faith by
[34:55] accepting what God Said
[34:58] how can I take a cocklebur and make a
[35:00] grain of wheat out of it it's impossible
[35:02] for me to do it the only way it can be
[35:04] is because inside that cocklebur has
[35:07] been transmitted from cochleberry wheat
[35:09] a Cocker board to a germ called wheat
[35:11] life so now he's trying to get us to
[35:14] understand Romans 7.
[35:16] don't lose sight of this the condition
[35:19] that we're in
[35:20] he said how can I take Cocker and make
[35:23] it a weed I can't I'd have to transmit
[35:25] the life of wheat into the inside of the
[35:28] cocoa bird
[35:29] that's what he's saying
[35:31] okay
[35:33] and in the Conqueror to a germ called
[35:35] wheat life then you bury that cuckoo
[35:37] bird and it'll produce grain of wheat
[35:39] that's right because it's wheat life on
[35:42] the inside
[35:43] because there has been a life of wheat
[35:45] put in the cocoa bar and the life of the
[35:48] Cockapoo has been taken out
[35:50] but the nature of the cockover is still
[35:52] sticky and it will be until this new
[35:56] life has fully been developed out of the
[35:58] ground and raised up again
[36:00] so he's talking about the change in the
[36:02] body so the outside until until the this
[36:07] body is changed on the outside it's
[36:10] going to be a wheat life inside a
[36:12] of bird plant
[36:14] right making it by Nature on the inside
[36:17] wheat and by Nature on the outside
[36:19] cockle burn
[36:21] all right he's trying to explain Romans
[36:23] 7.
[36:26] when it comes forth then it's no more
[36:28] cockable but wheat
[36:30] but while it's here on Earth and in the
[36:33] out of the earth and the Cocker bar it's
[36:36] still sticky but it's got the nature on
[36:38] the inside of it of wheat
[36:40] and as long as you're in this life
[36:43] you're going to be sticky and have a
[36:45] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[36:47] as long as you live but the inside of
[36:49] you you're born again
[36:52] how many loves the message
[36:56] this is our struggle this is our battle
[36:59] it's a battle between the kookabur
[37:01] nature and the wheat nature
[37:04] the life on the inside and what's the
[37:07] residual effect of hybridization on the
[37:09] outside of us
[37:11] in our mind in our spirit realm and in
[37:14] our flesh amen but inside has been born
[37:17] Anew there's a new creation Now there's
[37:19] a genuine sieging a genuine wheat germ
[37:22] on the inside so you are wheat amen but
[37:26] your wheat trapped in cocklebur and
[37:29] until it goes into the ground and rots
[37:32] and comes forth again then it'll produce
[37:34] exactly what was on the inside all the
[37:37] way around
[37:38] so until the resurrection and change of
[37:41] the body then we're dealing with this
[37:43] wheat inside cocoa Brewer outside
[37:46] that's why I say in God's Garden are two
[37:49] trees
[37:53] you can say
[37:55] what would what would I have done in
[37:58] Eden
[37:59] what would I have done in that Garden
[38:01] that day you're in the Garden today
[38:04] your brother said so you're back in the
[38:06] garden you're facing those two trees
[38:09] and you're not standing and saying do I
[38:12] receive the message or do I receive the
[38:14] Baptist
[38:20] I think deception's closer than that
[38:25] again questions and answers in the same
[38:28] message further down he says this is a
[38:30] dying spirit and a dying body he's
[38:31] talking about your human spirit
[38:33] but you can't be in two bodies at one
[38:36] time but there can be two Natures in you
[38:38] at one time
[38:41] I love so much what God has showed us
[38:44] through this message
[38:46] talk about a confused people a man
[38:48] trying to live for God and trying to
[38:50] live the word and having a stickle cocky
[38:52] sticky cockle burn nature with the
[38:54] residual effects of genetics and the
[38:56] hybridization and not even knowing that
[38:58] you were hybrid from the Garden of Eden
[39:00] not even knowing what the fall was all
[39:03] about and now I'm not even understanding
[39:04] new birth in the right way and thinking
[39:07] that the baptism Holy Ghost will change
[39:08] everything and I'll live a perfect life
[39:09] and never have a struggle again I am so
[39:12] glad we've been freed from
[39:13] denominational ideas to come to the
[39:15] reality of God in this day
[39:18] God has a garden amen he's planted a
[39:21] garden and you're the garden and and
[39:23] you've been shut up and sealed behind
[39:25] the word and sealed under those seals
[39:28] all this time you've been barred behind
[39:30] the seals but he loosed the seals so
[39:32] that he can open the way to the garden
[39:34] and the garden is saying come now blow
[39:36] let the fragrance of what he's put in me
[39:39] come back to what's in you the word amen
[39:41] and the word is attracting the word and
[39:43] the word is coming to the word
[39:47] but we want only the bridegroom
[39:51] to come into the garden
[39:54] we don't want
[39:56] another hybridization
[39:59] we don't want another serpent something
[40:01] that's like human but not human
[40:04] something that's like the bridegroom but
[40:07] not the bridegroom because our
[40:08] bridegroom is riding on a white horse
[40:10] the false bridegroom is riding on a
[40:12] white horse
[40:14] we see him in Revelation 19 riding on a
[40:17] white horse but we see in Revelation
[40:19] chapter 6 amen the Antichrist Spirit
[40:22] riding on a white horse amen we want the
[40:25] bridegroom in the garden but we don't
[40:26] want the other white horse rider in the
[40:29] garden
[40:33] praise God
[40:36] let's look at First Corinthians 6 19.
[40:54] First Corinthians 6 19.
[40:58] it says what know you not that your body
[41:01] is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is
[41:03] in you which you have of God and neither
[41:07] not your own
[41:08] what's in you God
[41:13] what's in you hybridization and a carnal
[41:16] nature
[41:18] at the same time
[41:23] yeah well brother remember preached the
[41:24] message called Israel in the church back
[41:26] in 1953 I love this message but this
[41:28] quote comes from there it says watch
[41:30] it's moving right out today in a
[41:32] terrible force all around it behooves
[41:35] you my brother sister to consider what
[41:37] you're listening at and don't you never
[41:39] underestimate Satan's power for
[41:41] deceiving
[41:42] don't you never underestimate him he's
[41:44] smooth as can as he can be and the
[41:47] Antichrist Spirit isn't communism no the
[41:49] Antichrist spirit is so close like the
[41:51] real thing to little deceive the very
[41:54] elect if possible
[41:56] Jesus said so in Matthew 24 it's a
[41:58] religious spirit oh I want you to catch
[42:01] that that Antichrist spirit is a
[42:02] religious spirit
[42:05] oh why Cain and Abel were brothers The
[42:08] Crow and the dove set on the same Roost
[42:11] Esau and Jacob were brothers Judas and
[42:13] Jesus was in the same church one the
[42:16] preacher the other one the treasure see
[42:18] there always just the deceiving the lie
[42:20] that came that Satan told Eve was 90
[42:23] truth ninety percent truth
[42:27] so he's showing us that there's been
[42:28] twins you've told you because don't ever
[42:30] underestimate the power of Satan to
[42:32] deceive amen and then he begins to show
[42:35] you Esau and Jacob Cain and Abel Jesus
[42:39] and Judas
[42:41] I say Lucifer and Michael
[42:44] then he goes into the ark amen and he
[42:46] says the he said The Crow and the dove
[42:49] sat on the same Roost
[42:52] you talk about close they were in the
[42:54] ark
[42:56] and this message Christ is the ark
[42:59] and and there was a a dove and a crow
[43:03] sitting on the same Roost
[43:06] and I want to look at two scriptures I
[43:09] want to go to Jeremiah 17 9.
[43:12] before we go to the next section here
[43:14] Jeremiah
[43:15] 17 and 9.
[43:25] Jeremiah chapter 17. he's going to read
[43:28] one verse and then we're going to go
[43:29] over to Hebrews Jeremiah 17 verse 9.
[43:32] the heart is deceitful above all things
[43:36] and desperately wicked who can know it
[43:41] he's talking about your heart
[43:45] let's go over to Hebrews
[43:48] chapter 4.
[44:01] Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12.
[44:09] for the word of God is quick and
[44:11] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[44:13] sword piercing even to the dividing
[44:15] asunder of Soul and Spirit and the
[44:17] joints in the morrow and as a discerner
[44:19] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[44:23] the heart
[44:24] is deceitfully wicked who can know it
[44:27] I tell you friends sometimes we don't
[44:29] even properly understand ourselves
[44:33] we don't even properly discern ourselves
[44:36] sometimes
[44:38] we sometimes deceive ourselves
[44:42] I don't know if it might just be me I
[44:44] might be the only one in the room but I
[44:46] look back in in my past and I see
[44:49] mistakes I made but the day I made them
[44:52] I thought I was right
[44:56] and I thought I had good reasoning and
[44:58] good intentions and I had scripture and
[45:00] I had and I quote and I had this
[45:03] reasoning in my mind and I made the
[45:04] decision based off reasoning amen but
[45:07] now I am years later looking back and
[45:09] now I can see things I didn't see that
[45:11] day but I saw my own Pride
[45:14] that was motivating me I saw my own
[45:17] desire that there was something that I
[45:19] wanted out of this decision there was
[45:22] something that would benefit me in this
[45:23] decision and so I allowed the reasoning
[45:26] to be a religious reasoning
[45:29] and the religious reasoning and you
[45:32] would have never convinced me that day I
[45:34] was wrong
[45:36] I was convinced but now I look down the
[45:38] down the road I look back and I know I
[45:41] was wrong I know there were other things
[45:43] laying in my desire other things in my
[45:45] heart that weren't just pure motive
[45:49] and when you do that it scares you
[45:53] you look at that and it's frightening
[45:55] how you can begin to justify your own
[45:58] actions religiously
[46:00] but but still behind it there's an
[46:02] element of Pride or lust
[46:05] a desire a selfish desire
[46:09] and so you know I was I was thinking
[46:11] about David remember David he's king of
[46:14] Israel God has put him in a position and
[46:16] and he's serving God faithfully and God
[46:20] allows a spirit to come to David to
[46:24] convince him to number the people
[46:25] against the word of God
[46:27] right so David goes in numbers of people
[46:29] because God had ought against the people
[46:32] so God needed to bring a chastisement to
[46:35] the people so there had to be an error
[46:37] so so God allowed a spirit to move upon
[46:40] David and David began to number the
[46:41] people and then it all comes out that he
[46:43] was wrong and he repents and and all of
[46:46] those things happened and God uh you
[46:48] know he he he I think 70 000 people die
[46:51] in that plague if I'm I might be
[46:53] mistaken but a great number and God
[46:55] brings a correction David cries out he
[46:57] repents God hears David and he stays his
[46:59] hand over Jerusalem
[47:01] but I began to think about that
[47:03] there there had to be something in David
[47:06] that that Spirit could work on
[47:09] there had to be an element of Pride
[47:11] somewhere where David wanted to know how
[47:13] big his arm he was
[47:16] or that influence would have not had
[47:18] anything to work with
[47:20] and we know God was in it all and it
[47:22] served a purpose but you realize how how
[47:27] desperately wicked the heart is
[47:30] the heart of mankind desperately wicked
[47:33] who can know it
[47:35] but the word
[47:37] the word
[47:39] is sharper and quicker than any
[47:42] two-edges sword dividing between the
[47:45] soul and the spirit you talk about the
[47:48] hardest division to make you try to
[47:50] determine whether that's you or God
[47:52] in your own thoughts
[47:55] you try to determine in your own desires
[47:57] and your own thoughts and wanting to
[47:59] take an action on something you tried to
[48:01] discern which is you and which is God
[48:03] and you'll find out that that soul and
[48:06] that Spirit are pretty tight
[48:09] but what can divide it the word of God
[48:11] if David would have only looked at the
[48:13] word and God said don't number the
[48:16] people amen he would have discerned his
[48:18] own Thinking by the word
[48:23] so
[48:25] the heart of man is deceitfully wicked
[48:27] who can know it but the word can
[48:30] separate it out
[48:31] that's why
[48:34] if it wasn't for the message of the hour
[48:36] We're hopeless folks
[48:38] we're finished
[48:40] I mean
[48:44] you would say without the message you
[48:46] know I I've I've said before myself
[48:48] without the message I wouldn't know
[48:49] where to go without the message where
[48:51] would you go you go live by yourself but
[48:53] listen if you live by yourself you still
[48:55] have a problem and the problem is
[48:57] yourself there's two trees in this
[48:59] Garden you can't go off and live a
[49:01] Hermit life and expect to overcome you
[49:03] still have to face those two trees every
[49:05] day and the deception that's coming from
[49:07] your own heart
[49:11] there's no getting out of this
[49:13] we all have to go through it we all have
[49:15] to face it and we don't have to learn
[49:17] how to surrender to the word of God
[49:21] we we thought it was going to be easy
[49:25] I mean I thought it was going to be hard
[49:27] at first because I mean I have to leave
[49:29] my church I've got to get baptized in
[49:31] Jesus name I have to be rejected my wife
[49:33] has to change the way she dresses not
[49:35] cut her hair I've got to change some of
[49:37] my the things I think about and look at
[49:39] and talk about and that was really hard
[49:40] changes and we made those changes but I
[49:43] realized that was nothing that was a
[49:45] piece of cake compared to what God is
[49:47] requiring in this day
[49:49] he wants a pure heart he wants a full
[49:51] surrender and he wants preeminence in
[49:53] you
[49:55] and I thought well that'd be easy God
[49:57] you can have for him and his but he
[49:58] doesn't take he only receives what's
[50:00] given what's yielded to him God Only
[50:03] Takes as much as he yielded to him amen
[50:05] and I realized so many times in my life
[50:07] I think I'm giving all but I'm still
[50:09] holding on to something
[50:11] I'm holding on to a thought or a desire
[50:13] or a plan or a wish amen and I think
[50:17] I've surrendered all and then years
[50:18] later I realized I haven't surrendered
[50:20] all and now I Surrender another little
[50:22] piece and now I said I've surrendered
[50:23] all but when you go down the road you
[50:25] realize you haven't yet surrendered all
[50:30] it's it's not easy
[50:33] I don't think it was meant to be easy
[50:38] I think we get to a place where we don't
[50:40] even trust ourselves
[50:46] why does God allow us sometimes
[50:50] to make blunders
[50:53] and you wish God you could have stopped
[50:55] me why didn't you stop me you could have
[50:57] given me a dream you could have had
[50:59] somebody say something to me
[51:01] but God allows you to walk right into a
[51:03] mess a mistake
[51:06] your own selfish desire leading you the
[51:08] wrong way you make a wrong choice and
[51:10] you suffer the consequences and you ask
[51:11] why
[51:13] but I think that's the point
[51:16] it's so that we learn not to trust
[51:17] ourselves
[51:19] not to trust their own desires not to
[51:21] trust our own wishes our own thoughts
[51:23] till we get to the way we only trust one
[51:25] thing and that's the word
[51:27] and then even then if God doesn't reveal
[51:29] it to us in his Purity we'll never
[51:30] understand it with a carnal mind
[51:33] so the only thing we have is the word
[51:35] but we can only receive the word by by
[51:37] Revelation and that's the only way to
[51:39] keep it right is by God to divinely
[51:41] reveal it to us
[51:42] and so we're in a position where we need
[51:45] God every second of the day
[51:48] brother Branham said again in 1953
[51:52] he said even put it back in the Ark in
[51:54] the destruction of the world there was
[51:56] The Crow and the dove sitting on the
[51:58] same Roost one was just as much bird as
[52:01] the other one was is that right
[52:04] but what was it one was a crow by nature
[52:07] and the other was a dove by nature one
[52:09] could fly just like the other one but
[52:10] their Natures their appetites were
[52:12] different the crow was satisfied eating
[52:14] the old dead carcasses and going from
[52:16] place to place called around he was just
[52:19] as happy and probably as religious as
[52:21] the dove thought he was
[52:24] but the dove couldn't stand the smell
[52:26] and turned back again
[52:28] in the ark was a crow and a dove
[52:33] one could eat on dead carry and the
[52:36] other one could not
[52:37] but the one that could eat on dedicarian
[52:40] could eat pure wheat like the dove but
[52:42] the dove couldn't eat the carry him
[52:47] and you know we can take this as the
[52:49] description of two types of Believers in
[52:51] the church
[52:52] or we can take it as description of two
[52:54] parts of me
[52:57] sitting on the same Roost
[53:03] you know
[53:04] I heard brother Harold Beckett say one
[53:06] time he said you don't have to look very
[53:07] far to find three types of Believers in
[53:09] the church
[53:11] Believers make Believers and unbelievers
[53:12] he said you are yourself
[53:15] your soul is the believer if you're a
[53:17] child of God your spirit is the
[53:19] make-believer and your flesh is the
[53:21] unbeliever
[53:23] well that was interesting it stuck with
[53:25] me for a long time I heard it quite a
[53:27] while ago
[53:30] but there's in the ark was these two
[53:33] birds
[53:34] they oh both could fly
[53:36] they were both Birds they both had
[53:38] feathers they were so similar in so many
[53:40] ways one could he pure grain
[53:45] and carrion the other could only eat
[53:48] pure grain
[53:51] listen the biggest hypocrite in the
[53:55] world is your own human spirit
[54:00] you don't have to worry about the one in
[54:01] the seat next to you
[54:03] but you got to worry about the one
[54:05] you're sitting inside of
[54:08] that is the biggest hypocrite in the
[54:10] world because your human Spirit can
[54:13] raise its hands and sing and cry and
[54:15] weep in the song service and can go out
[54:18] and commit a horrible atrocity the next
[54:19] day
[54:21] it's possible
[54:23] that is inside every one of us
[54:26] but we need something else inside that
[54:28] will override that and take control of
[54:30] that and it's the spirit of God
[54:34] so now we realize that these these two
[54:38] birds set on the same Roost
[54:41] and
[54:42] I I'm Prayed by the end of the service
[54:45] that we get to the point where we don't
[54:47] trust ourselves not one drop
[54:50] that I don't trust in myself I don't
[54:52] trust my own thinking I don't trust my
[54:54] feelings the only thing that I will
[54:55] trust is the word
[54:57] and God help us to see the word right
[55:01] in the power of transformation brother
[55:03] Ben says when I go home this time I'm
[55:06] preaching on the subject the trail of
[55:08] the serpent
[55:09] the beast at the beginning and the Beast
[55:11] at the end
[55:12] this this quote just is fascinating to
[55:15] me I just want you to follow his train
[55:16] of thought for a minute he's going to go
[55:19] home and preach on the trail of the
[55:20] serpent the beast at the beginning and
[55:21] the Beast at the end
[55:23] and Trail him right through the Bible
[55:25] and show how he heads up see and you all
[55:28] get that on Telephone you see if the
[55:30] Lord permits us to do it and now just
[55:32] watch how cunning that fellow is how
[55:34] he's just exactly well well they're just
[55:38] like Judas and Jesus there both brothers
[55:40] in their tribe just like Esau and Jacob
[55:43] like The Crow and the dove sitting on
[55:45] the same roof and everything is a twin
[55:47] in this great Warfare that we're in
[55:51] foreign
[55:53] he's going to preach on the trail of the
[55:54] serpent the beast at the beginning and
[55:56] the Beast at the end
[55:57] then he starts talking about twins
[56:01] because what are twins
[56:04] twins are twins are two different people
[56:09] that are produced from the same father
[56:12] and mother
[56:15] Esau and Jacob had the same father and
[56:17] mother
[56:18] right
[56:19] so they come from the same place they
[56:21] look like they're the same but there's
[56:22] something different inside Esau was not
[56:24] what Jacob was Jacob was predestinated
[56:26] Esau wasn't
[56:28] right so they come from the same womb
[56:31] and their birth at the same time so you
[56:34] would think they're the same thing
[56:37] this is how brother branham's talking
[56:38] about the trail of the serpent
[56:41] the trail of the serpent it wasn't the
[56:44] serpent had a trail over here and God's
[56:46] mind had a trail over here but those two
[56:48] Vines intertwined
[56:51] so he refers to Judas and Jesus they
[56:53] both came out of the same tribe they
[56:55] were both out of Judah
[56:58] he talks about Esau and Jacob and the
[57:00] Dove and the crow both of the bird
[57:02] family both can fly both can eat grain
[57:05] and now he's talking about these these
[57:07] twins now uh uh uh and he's talking
[57:10] about the trail of the serpent the beast
[57:12] at the beginning and the Beast at the
[57:13] end and we know that there was a beast
[57:15] in the beginning that said that the
[57:17] devil incarnated and that was the
[57:18] serpent and he brought hybridization and
[57:20] we know that it'll happen again in the
[57:22] Pope in the end time that the devil will
[57:24] fully incarnate a person there's a beast
[57:26] in the beginning and a beast in the End
[57:28] Amen but but for us I don't have to look
[57:31] too far to find those two Vines they're
[57:33] wrapped around inside of me
[57:39] and I don't have to wait for the pope to
[57:43] be manifest as the Beast to recognize
[57:45] where the Beast is because hybridization
[57:47] is affecting me there's a beast in me
[57:52] I didn't come the way God intended me
[57:55] originally in the original creation
[57:56] there was a hybridization that took
[57:58] place in a mixing amen and that's
[58:00] affected all of mankind and it's
[58:02] affecting you and I
[58:05] so we would talk about the Beast what
[58:06] about the one looking you in the mirror
[58:11] the greatest deception is not going to
[58:13] come from a pamphlet that comes in the
[58:15] mail
[58:16] but the greatest deception is going to
[58:18] come from you yourself when you're
[58:20] deceived by your own Thinking by
[58:22] accepting something your own way and by
[58:24] your own desire and by your own lusts
[58:31] president said in the message the
[58:32] greatest battle ever fought he said this
[58:34] great first battle that was ever fought
[58:36] begin in heaven when Michael and his
[58:38] angels fought against Lucifer and his
[58:40] angels it first started the first battle
[58:42] was in heaven so sin did not originate
[58:45] on Earth it originated in heaven and
[58:47] then it was thrown down from heaven cast
[58:49] out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on
[58:52] human beings then the battle from Angels
[58:55] became human battles
[58:57] so now where is the battle the battle is
[59:01] not just in heaven but it came down to
[59:04] earth amen is not just in Eden but the
[59:07] battle is in human beings
[59:10] now the same Warfare between light and
[59:13] dark good and evil Michael and Lucifer
[59:15] Christ and Satan where is that battle
[59:18] taking place that battle is taking place
[59:20] in human beings
[59:26] so it fell to Earth It cast out of
[59:29] Heaven to the Earth fell on human beings
[59:31] then the battle from Angels became human
[59:33] battles and Satan come to destroy God's
[59:36] creation what God had created to be for
[59:39] himself he had Satan come to destroy
[59:41] this
[59:44] so what God had created to be for
[59:46] himself
[59:48] Satan came to destroy
[59:52] what what was the bride intended to be
[59:55] after the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[59:58] when the first church came forth at
[59:59] Pentecost she was to be a creation for
[1:00:03] himself
[1:00:04] she was to be his bride she was to be
[1:00:07] his garden the place where he would sow
[1:00:09] his seeds
[1:00:10] and bring forth his fruit
[1:00:13] right but another one another Spirit not
[1:00:17] the Holy Spirit but the Antichrist
[1:00:19] Spirit got into God's Garden which was
[1:00:21] the first church and planted other seeds
[1:00:24] seeds of discrepancy
[1:00:26] and then two Vines took off from there
[1:00:31] so Satan is trying to destroy what God's
[1:00:34] creating for himself so what is the end
[1:00:36] time bride she is to be God's Garden
[1:00:38] restore it again she is to be the Virgin
[1:00:41] bride of Jesus Christ amen walled up and
[1:00:44] sealed up and she's she's to be inviting
[1:00:47] only one man into her garden and that's
[1:00:50] Christ which is the Living Word
[1:00:53] she's supposed to be a recipient for the
[1:00:55] word but the devil is trying constantly
[1:00:58] trying to corrupt and Destroy what God
[1:01:01] has made for himself
[1:01:03] he did it in heaven he's done in Eden
[1:01:05] he's trying to do it now
[1:01:09] like when when we read all of these
[1:01:12] things in the Bible and we hear all
[1:01:13] these things
[1:01:15] we We Begin I'm I should say we you may
[1:01:18] not do it but I I begin to place things
[1:01:21] like uh that was back in the garden and
[1:01:25] that was in heaven and then this was in
[1:01:27] Noah's day and then this was in the
[1:01:29] first church age and I I failed to
[1:01:32] realize that every age has been the same
[1:01:34] thing it's always the same whether it's
[1:01:36] in heaven in Eden or the first church
[1:01:38] day that's always the seventh there's
[1:01:39] two Vines two trees two sources amen and
[1:01:42] there's a free will to choose one or the
[1:01:44] other
[1:01:46] we are standing in the garden
[1:01:52] so we can't place things and then we
[1:01:54] also when we begin to talk about
[1:01:56] denominations and and Creeds and dogmas
[1:01:59] and blah blah blah and we start to say
[1:02:01] well that's over in that church across
[1:02:03] the street and the in the denominational
[1:02:04] church and that's in the Catholic and
[1:02:06] that's in this but listen who creates
[1:02:09] Dogma it's man
[1:02:11] human beings create Dogma where is it
[1:02:14] created in the mind of man so you can
[1:02:17] have your own Dogma
[1:02:20] right now you don't you don't have to go
[1:02:24] drive to another assembly you don't have
[1:02:26] to drive somewhere else you can sit all
[1:02:28] by yourself amen all alone and come up
[1:02:31] with your own Creed
[1:02:36] and Satan is constantly trying
[1:02:39] to get into the garden to plant another
[1:02:42] seed
[1:02:43] to bring corruption
[1:02:45] he said that's what his purpose was was
[1:02:47] to destroy destroy it then the battle
[1:02:49] begin here on Earth and begin in us that
[1:02:52] has been raging ever since
[1:02:55] so brother banham says
[1:02:57] he wants to follow the trail of the
[1:02:59] serpent the serpent the beginning of the
[1:03:00] serpent in the end and he talks about
[1:03:02] the great battle that started in heaven
[1:03:03] but where is the battle it's in US
[1:03:08] what is the fight over it's over for
[1:03:11] what God has created and reserved to be
[1:03:13] for himself that's what the devil's
[1:03:15] trying to destroy he's not trying listen
[1:03:18] he's got the world this is Satan's Eden
[1:03:21] he's got that amen he's got it all but
[1:03:23] what he's after is the garden
[1:03:29] and he he's he's got access to your mind
[1:03:34] he can't read your mind remember said he
[1:03:37] can't read your mind but he can plan a
[1:03:38] thought
[1:03:41] he can bring an influence a spirit be
[1:03:44] can we can speak to you in the spirit
[1:03:45] realm and plant thoughts that's why oh
[1:03:48] my goodness
[1:03:50] you can't trust your own thinking
[1:03:56] one thing that I find discouraging in
[1:03:58] Christianity especially among spiritual
[1:04:00] people
[1:04:01] is that they'll believe every notion or
[1:04:04] feeling that they have
[1:04:06] and they'll say it's of the Lord
[1:04:10] but it doesn't always pan out to be
[1:04:12] we've watched it we've watched it in our
[1:04:14] own life you don't have to point in
[1:04:16] anybody else
[1:04:18] you can feel definitely LED of the Lord
[1:04:21] to do something
[1:04:24] and then it falls completely apart
[1:04:25] instead of just saying well that was
[1:04:27] just me not God we say well God worked
[1:04:29] it out that way for this reason and then
[1:04:33] come on
[1:04:35] not every notion you have is the Holy
[1:04:38] Ghost
[1:04:39] not every thought I I mean at least
[1:04:42] maybe it is for you but not for me
[1:04:45] because I have a lot of thoughts that
[1:04:46] sound pretty good and when they're in my
[1:04:48] mind they're really good and I mean
[1:04:49] that's just perfect amen and when I go
[1:04:51] to share it with somebody the minute
[1:04:52] it's out of my mouth I'm like that's a
[1:04:54] really bad idea
[1:04:55] that's not right at all
[1:04:58] and then or somebody will say something
[1:04:59] or you hear preaching or listening to a
[1:05:01] table you realize that that's selfish
[1:05:03] amen that's based on Pride that that has
[1:05:05] got my advantage at its core and then
[1:05:07] you realize that you were you were
[1:05:09] deceiving yourself
[1:05:14] I think we have to be careful
[1:05:18] with the battle that's in our minds
[1:05:22] more careful than we've been in the past
[1:05:30] we think well if I associate with a
[1:05:32] group of people if I only listen to the
[1:05:33] message and only go where Believers are
[1:05:35] then I'll never be deceived
[1:05:39] listen
[1:05:40] I remember
[1:05:42] how many times I misinterpreted the
[1:05:45] message
[1:05:46] I listen Oh Brother Bear means oh
[1:05:48] awesome
[1:05:49] then I'll go to type it in a search to
[1:05:52] see where else he says it and realize I
[1:05:54] had it completely wrong
[1:05:56] my understanding was that was completely
[1:05:58] wrong he didn't say that anywhere else
[1:06:00] in fact he said the opposite everywhere
[1:06:02] else I was misunderstanding what he was
[1:06:04] saying and I thought he was tying these
[1:06:06] two scriptures together and making this
[1:06:07] and then that equals this and I got
[1:06:09] super enthused I was having a revelation
[1:06:15] but then when I go and run it out
[1:06:16] through the Bible through the message it
[1:06:18] doesn't hold out
[1:06:20] it's not true
[1:06:22] then all of a sudden I have to realize
[1:06:24] that was me
[1:06:27] I can't blame that on the Holy Spirit
[1:06:30] if not I have the Holy Spirit trying to
[1:06:32] deceive me and trying to get me to
[1:06:34] believe something incorrectly
[1:06:40] what are you saying brother Chad
[1:06:42] I'm saying the only thing we can trust
[1:06:44] is the word
[1:06:46] but it comes down to it the only thing
[1:06:47] we can trust is the word
[1:06:49] you can't trust our own Notions we can't
[1:06:52] trust our own feelings
[1:06:53] and how many times has God LED you
[1:06:56] through a notion and it was right and it
[1:06:58] was the Lord and he confirmed it with
[1:06:59] the word and it was God dropping
[1:07:01] something in your heart
[1:07:02] over and over and over how many times
[1:07:05] you got a notion or thought and it
[1:07:07] didn't prove out to be right or it led
[1:07:08] you the wrong direction
[1:07:11] you see the problem
[1:07:13] we're all in a fix
[1:07:15] because we're in this outside cocklebur
[1:07:19] with an inside wheat
[1:07:22] the word is the only thing that we can
[1:07:25] trust
[1:07:28] the problem
[1:07:31] the problem when people begin to say the
[1:07:33] Lord told me or the Lord showed me
[1:07:36] is the minute they say that for me it's
[1:07:38] hands off
[1:07:40] I can't say anything
[1:07:42] unless I see it's contrary to the word
[1:07:44] of God and then I can say well the word
[1:07:46] says this but if it's just a decision
[1:07:48] you make or an idea or something like
[1:07:51] that the medicine that I say is the Lord
[1:07:52] showed me or the Lord told me then I if
[1:07:55] that is the Lord I'm not going to be
[1:07:56] found contradicting the Lord if the Lord
[1:07:58] told you to do it then you do it but if
[1:08:01] it doesn't pan out to be from the Lord
[1:08:02] be honest and stand up and say no that
[1:08:04] was wrong that was just me
[1:08:07] like let's be truthful let's be honest
[1:08:09] let's be real let's quit pretending to
[1:08:12] be spiritual and be spiritual by
[1:08:13] receiving the word
[1:08:16] we have such a pressure to be super
[1:08:17] spiritual but the most spiritual thing
[1:08:20] in the word is to receive the revelation
[1:08:21] of God's word for this day that's
[1:08:24] spiritual
[1:08:28] the crow is just as spiritual as the
[1:08:30] dove
[1:08:32] so we have to be honest with ourselves
[1:08:37] say I only have one place to go and
[1:08:40] that's this message God gave us the word
[1:08:42] of God it's the only thing I have
[1:08:44] I can't trust myself I can't trust all
[1:08:47] my Notions all my feelings I can only
[1:08:49] trust this word and I want this word to
[1:08:51] correct all of my Notions all of my
[1:08:54] feelings everything I want to come in
[1:08:56] line with the word
[1:08:59] so Paul
[1:09:01] he he's left in a dilemma
[1:09:05] who can deliver me from this body of
[1:09:07] death he realizes the problem is in his
[1:09:09] flesh
[1:09:10] said I want to do the word I find
[1:09:12] something in me that loves the word but
[1:09:14] the problems in my flesh he's in a
[1:09:16] dilemma and brother Brenham explains it
[1:09:19] to us we said that we saw their
[1:09:20] questions and answers where he said in
[1:09:22] you is two people two peoples
[1:09:26] so he's in a dilemma but he goes on to
[1:09:28] Romans 8. I love to read Romans 8 after
[1:09:30] reading Romans 7. let's turn together
[1:09:32] the Romans 8 chapter 1.
[1:09:36] and he starts to give us the solution to
[1:09:38] our problem
[1:09:50] Romans 8 chapter 1.
[1:09:56] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:09:59] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[1:10:01] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:10:03] spirit
[1:10:05] we're getting to the key now
[1:10:07] is not walking after the flesh but
[1:10:10] walking after the spirit
[1:10:12] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:10:14] Christ Jesus had made me free from the
[1:10:16] law of sin and death for what the law
[1:10:18] could not do and that it was weak
[1:10:20] through the flesh God sending his own
[1:10:22] son and the likeness of sinful flesh and
[1:10:24] for sin condemn sin in the flesh that
[1:10:28] the righteousness of the law might be
[1:10:30] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:10:32] flesh but after the spirit for they that
[1:10:34] are after The Flesh do mind the things
[1:10:36] of the flesh but they that are after the
[1:10:38] spirit the things of the spirit for to
[1:10:41] be carnally minded is death but to be
[1:10:43] spiritually minded is life and peace
[1:10:46] because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:10:48] against God for it is not subject to the
[1:10:50] law of God neither indeed can be so then
[1:10:53] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[1:10:55] God but ye are not in the flesh but in
[1:10:58] the spirit if so be the spirit of God
[1:11:00] dwell in you now if any man have not the
[1:11:02] spirit of Christ he is none of his and
[1:11:04] if Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:11:06] because of sin but the spirit is life
[1:11:09] because of righteousness but if the
[1:11:11] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:11:13] the dead dwell in you
[1:11:16] that he that raised up Christ from the
[1:11:18] dead shall also Quicken your Immortal
[1:11:19] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:11:23] you
[1:11:24] how am I going to overcome walk in the
[1:11:26] spirits
[1:11:27] receive the spirit of God and and the
[1:11:30] Brother Bear said the spirit and the
[1:11:32] word are the self-same thing
[1:11:34] to walk in the word to receive the word
[1:11:37] is to receive the spirit the life of the
[1:11:39] word and then the life of the word comes
[1:11:41] and lives its life out of you it's not a
[1:11:44] it's not a confirmation a Conformity by
[1:11:47] force it's not a Conformity by
[1:11:49] governments or by religion but it's
[1:11:51] walking in the spirit it's another life
[1:11:53] it's a life of the word that you've
[1:11:55] received coming in and living its life
[1:11:57] outside of you it's the wheat germ
[1:12:00] inside the conquerber and now the wheat
[1:12:02] germ if we focus on that it begins to
[1:12:05] flourish and bring another life
[1:12:08] so we must walk not according to the
[1:12:10] flesh not carnally but spiritually
[1:12:12] according to to the word according to
[1:12:15] Christ
[1:12:16] we must be diligent I believe in this
[1:12:19] hour to focus our attention on the right
[1:12:22] thing
[1:12:23] I I've said this before but I would like
[1:12:25] to remind you that Cardinal does not
[1:12:28] mean evil
[1:12:29] and carnal does not mean Wicked carnal
[1:12:33] means natural
[1:12:36] so there's a lot of things in natural
[1:12:39] life that we have to do
[1:12:40] you have to work you have to eat you
[1:12:42] have to sleep you have to work on your
[1:12:44] house you have to repair there's there's
[1:12:46] a there's carnal things that must be
[1:12:48] done
[1:12:49] there's a carnal life that must be lived
[1:12:52] but if we focus too much attention on
[1:12:54] the carnal we're going to deprive
[1:12:56] ourselves of the needed spiritual life
[1:12:59] that we need to walk not after the
[1:13:01] carnal not after the flash but after the
[1:13:03] spirit we need to be diligent because
[1:13:05] we're stuck so much in natural that we
[1:13:08] stick with the spirit as much as we can
[1:13:09] yield ourselves and give time and
[1:13:12] attention to the things of God
[1:13:17] brother Benham he starts to tell the
[1:13:20] story now uh I read a lot of questions
[1:13:22] and answers uh in 1964 when brother
[1:13:25] random answered the question from from
[1:13:27] Romans chapter 7 who can deliver me from
[1:13:30] this body of death I read you his answer
[1:13:32] inside use two persons and and he talks
[1:13:35] about that the wheat inside the cockle
[1:13:37] Burr
[1:13:38] immediately after that he starts talking
[1:13:40] about an Indian named chief
[1:13:43] immediately
[1:13:44] and how Chief come through a prayer line
[1:13:46] and then he couldn't say anything all he
[1:13:48] could say was me sick and he got a
[1:13:50] prayer card he said he's sick but
[1:13:51] eventually he learned more English and
[1:13:53] then he follows the story down after he
[1:13:55] tells that portion then he comes to this
[1:13:56] he said somebody told me
[1:13:59] at one time he was converted and
[1:14:00] received the Holy Ghost he's talking
[1:14:01] about this Indian man received the Holy
[1:14:03] Ghost and he said to him how are you
[1:14:05] getting along so this man met him he
[1:14:07] received the Holy Ghost and he asked him
[1:14:08] how are you getting along
[1:14:09] he said pretty good and pretty bad
[1:14:13] he said well how do you mean pretty good
[1:14:15] and pretty bad
[1:14:16] he said well since me received the Holy
[1:14:18] Spirit he said there's been two dogs in
[1:14:20] me one of them a black dog one of them a
[1:14:23] white dog and said they argue all the
[1:14:25] time said they growl and fight at one
[1:14:27] another said the white dog wants me to
[1:14:29] do do good and black dog wants me do bad
[1:14:32] he said well Chief which one of them
[1:14:33] wins the fight
[1:14:35] he said that depends on which one she
[1:14:37] feeds the most
[1:14:39] so I think that's a good answer here so
[1:14:41] brother Branham is attaching it back to
[1:14:43] Romans chapter 7.
[1:14:45] I want you to understand and he's
[1:14:47] talking about you with a wheat inside
[1:14:49] and a up on the outside this is the
[1:14:51] context of what he's talking about
[1:14:54] I think that's a good answer here
[1:14:57] see there just depends on the warring of
[1:15:00] the body that's in you it depends on
[1:15:02] which one you cater to which nature you
[1:15:05] cater to the carnal nature after the
[1:15:08] things of the world are the spiritual
[1:15:10] nature after the things of God that does
[1:15:13] it
[1:15:16] what's the solution
[1:15:18] follow after the spiritual things the
[1:15:21] spirit of God
[1:15:22] we we've got to be careful not to get
[1:15:25] caught caught up in the natural and
[1:15:28] forsake our spiritual life
[1:15:31] we've it it's
[1:15:33] there's there's more
[1:15:36] I should say our spiritual walk and
[1:15:39] being spiritually grounded and feeding
[1:15:41] in the spirit it's more than a daily
[1:15:43] ritual to have a ritual it's more than a
[1:15:46] religious Act
[1:15:48] like brother Ben said a a Christian
[1:15:50] praise and reads their Bible every day
[1:15:51] they have to well now that I'm reading
[1:15:53] this I realize what have to means
[1:15:56] they have to not to get the label of
[1:15:58] Christians they have to to survive
[1:16:01] they have to feed on the word they have
[1:16:04] to pray in the spirit they have to be
[1:16:07] connected to the spiritual things just
[1:16:09] to make it in this world because in them
[1:16:11] as two dogs in them is two Natures in
[1:16:13] them is cockable outside wheat on the
[1:16:15] inside which one is going to manifest
[1:16:18] itself it's the one that gets fed the
[1:16:20] most
[1:16:23] we've I mean this has been preached to
[1:16:26] him for I don't know how many times
[1:16:27] since before I was preaching
[1:16:30] that there's two dogs but when you
[1:16:32] realize it's it's it's not just a cute
[1:16:35] talking about two dogs it goes back to
[1:16:37] Romans 7 who's going to deliver me from
[1:16:39] this body of death I am trapped when I
[1:16:41] want to do good evils present with me
[1:16:43] this is this body is trapping me amen
[1:16:46] what's the solution the solution is to
[1:16:48] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[1:16:49] fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:16:51] it's not just to throw your hands in the
[1:16:53] air and say can't help it anyways I'm
[1:16:55] I'm you know carnal mind no that's not
[1:16:58] what Paul is talking about
[1:17:01] that's not what this means what it means
[1:17:04] is there is a way to overcome the way to
[1:17:06] overcome is to realize what danger you
[1:17:09] and I are in
[1:17:15] I for one have not realized
[1:17:18] the danger I posed to myself
[1:17:22] but God is highlighting through the
[1:17:25] scriptures through the message I'm
[1:17:26] realizing I am a danger to myself
[1:17:32] I need the spirit of God and I need to
[1:17:35] yield to the spirit of God because I am
[1:17:38] a danger to myself
[1:17:43] but if I walk in the spirit
[1:17:47] and not after the things of the world
[1:17:49] and not after the desires of flesh but
[1:17:50] walk in the spirit surrender to the
[1:17:53] spirit feeding on the things of the
[1:17:55] spirit I will not fulfill the lust of
[1:17:57] the flesh
[1:18:02] God
[1:18:03] has predestinated a bride that won't be
[1:18:06] deceived
[1:18:08] not because she's wiser and has better
[1:18:11] books and more
[1:18:13] searching equipment to search the
[1:18:15] message
[1:18:18] but shall not be deceived because he's
[1:18:20] predestinator not to be
[1:18:22] but because he's predestinated a bride
[1:18:24] not to be deceived in this day
[1:18:26] then what has he done to to make sure
[1:18:30] that she will not be deceived remember
[1:18:33] the Holy Spirit you say will receive the
[1:18:36] spirit but the Holy Spirit was bound in
[1:18:38] these denominational Waters
[1:18:40] for nearly 2 000 years but is loosed
[1:18:43] again in the evening time by the evening
[1:18:44] time message the holy goes back in the
[1:18:46] people so what was holding the Holy
[1:18:49] Ghost what was barring or or locking or
[1:18:53] or chaining the Holy Ghost away from the
[1:18:55] people it was Creeds and dogmas
[1:18:58] it was the church systems
[1:19:01] and so what released the full measure of
[1:19:03] the Holy Ghost to come it was the full
[1:19:05] opening of the word because the spirit
[1:19:07] and the word are the self same thing
[1:19:09] it's the life of the word it's the
[1:19:11] spirit that makes the word live
[1:19:13] so when the word was released the spirit
[1:19:16] was released so what was holding the
[1:19:18] spirit it was when denominations were
[1:19:20] holding back the word and then holding
[1:19:22] back the word they held back the spirit
[1:19:26] so when God said when Brad the prophet
[1:19:29] says to us that God will have a bride
[1:19:31] shall not be deceived like evil she's
[1:19:34] predestinated not to be then you can say
[1:19:36] well I'm predestinated not to be God
[1:19:39] didn't just say you're predestinated not
[1:19:40] to be you're going to be fine but what
[1:19:42] God did is he released the word which
[1:19:44] released the life to ensure that you
[1:19:46] would not be deceived it's not that you
[1:19:48] can just say well I can't be deceived
[1:19:50] brother you can be absolutely deceived
[1:19:52] by your own self with that attitude okay
[1:19:56] that's a wrong attitude you're taking it
[1:19:58] on the statement like the statement is
[1:20:00] the only thing that God provided to keep
[1:20:02] you from deception no the statement
[1:20:04] shows that God's going to do something
[1:20:05] in this day that's going to prevent
[1:20:07] deception of the bride and what's he
[1:20:09] going to do is give his word back to his
[1:20:11] bride so that the wall is rebuilt and
[1:20:14] she by her own free moral agency can
[1:20:16] stay behind the wall
[1:20:17] [Applause]
[1:20:20] I mean we have you have people who will
[1:20:22] take a statement like that and act like
[1:20:24] they can say do believe anything they
[1:20:26] want to believe because I'm bride and I
[1:20:28] can't be deceived that is absolutely the
[1:20:30] wrong approach to God wrong approach to
[1:20:33] the word wrong approach to that promise
[1:20:38] that's like a Jew when Christ was here
[1:20:40] saying we're God's chosen people he'll
[1:20:42] never forsake us
[1:20:46] what you're saying was true
[1:20:49] they were God's chosen people and he
[1:20:51] wasn't going to forsake them
[1:20:53] they forsook him
[1:20:58] but the promise created the wrong
[1:21:00] attitude
[1:21:04] and we have a promise in this day but
[1:21:06] don't let the promise create the wrong
[1:21:08] attitude
[1:21:11] you can't feed on the things of the
[1:21:13] world we can't just willy-nilly accept
[1:21:15] anything everybody preaches and anything
[1:21:17] that's ever said and said well I'm bride
[1:21:19] I can't be deceived
[1:21:22] no God's brought an inoculation against
[1:21:25] deception and that's the revelation of
[1:21:28] his word in this hour
[1:21:30] and and the word came in fullness
[1:21:33] bringing the fullness of the spirit to
[1:21:36] make the word live to prevent
[1:21:39] the bride from deception
[1:21:44] I must yield myself to that I must give
[1:21:49] time to that I must give my life to that
[1:21:55] you know
[1:21:57] one thing I've learned is people can say
[1:21:59] whatever they want to say
[1:22:01] but it doesn't make it so
[1:22:05] I'm Brian I can never be deceived and
[1:22:07] they go off into deception
[1:22:10] and saying it loud and boldly doesn't
[1:22:12] make it any more true
[1:22:15] saying it aggressively and with such
[1:22:18] confident that doesn't it still doesn't
[1:22:20] make it true
[1:22:21] it's only true if it was true before the
[1:22:23] foundation of the world
[1:22:25] that's what makes it true not because we
[1:22:27] say so but because he said so
[1:22:30] not because I the promise isn't true to
[1:22:33] me because I took the promise attached
[1:22:34] to myself the promise is true to me
[1:22:36] because the promise was made for me
[1:22:41] and when that happens it brings a
[1:22:44] humility
[1:22:45] it ought to bring a humility not a pride
[1:22:48] that would have us stomping off doing
[1:22:49] whatever we want but a humility to
[1:22:52] recognize I can no more save myself
[1:22:55] than anything I I can't protect my who's
[1:22:58] going to protect me from me
[1:23:01] like I've got to have another life and
[1:23:03] then the one I was born with I need
[1:23:05] another mind than the one I grew up with
[1:23:07] and was educated I need the mind of
[1:23:09] Christ I need the Life of Christ I need
[1:23:11] the word of God I need something more
[1:23:13] than me because me is not enough I will
[1:23:16] destroy myself and I will be deceived by
[1:23:18] my own human brightness
[1:23:23] and when we realize those things it
[1:23:26] makes the message at this hour become so
[1:23:28] precious and valuable to us it is a
[1:23:30] life-giving stream from God it is water
[1:23:32] from the rock it is manna every day
[1:23:34] without this we will perish in the
[1:23:36] wilderness listen friends we are in
[1:23:39] spiritual famine in this nation in this
[1:23:41] world it's absolutely black gone to
[1:23:44] apostasy there's not a stitch of food
[1:23:46] anywhere to be eaten the only places to
[1:23:48] get it out of that Barrel where Elisha
[1:23:50] blessed the widow woman amen because she
[1:23:52] served him and every day she could dip
[1:23:54] in and get a fresh portion of meal from
[1:23:57] that barrel and and it was so good every
[1:23:59] day can you imagine like when we come to
[1:24:01] church what is it when we listen to the
[1:24:03] message it's fresh meal given out from
[1:24:06] an Elisha Ministry
[1:24:09] can you imagine her and her son eating
[1:24:11] the meal that they said oh Mom this is
[1:24:14] the best we've ever had
[1:24:16] this is better than yesterday
[1:24:19] and it's like it's the same Barrel it's
[1:24:21] the same meal it's it's it's the meal
[1:24:24] which is Christ it was Christ yesterday
[1:24:26] and it was the best ever now it's the
[1:24:28] best ever why because the fresh portion
[1:24:30] of the word is always the best
[1:24:33] it's always God's portion for us it
[1:24:35] always tastes good
[1:24:38] but there is no place else to get Manna
[1:24:40] there is no place else for water there
[1:24:43] is no place else to get this Meal which
[1:24:45] is Christ
[1:24:47] and when we recognize the whole world as
[1:24:50] an apostasy the whole religious world is
[1:24:53] an apostasy and they're a spiritual
[1:24:55] famine in the land
[1:24:59] and God has given us a barrel that every
[1:25:01] time we dip in there's more meal
[1:25:06] more of Christ and more of Christ and
[1:25:10] more of Christ isn't it the same meal
[1:25:12] yes it's the same but it's new
[1:25:17] because he keeps putting more in an
[1:25:19] inexhaustible Fountain of God's word
[1:25:22] and when we realize how needy we are
[1:25:24] then we don't take our fellowship
[1:25:27] lightly we don't take preaching lightly
[1:25:29] we don't take the message lightly we
[1:25:30] don't take our Bibles violently then all
[1:25:32] of a sudden this this is the smitten
[1:25:35] rock this is the rejected Christ in our
[1:25:38] day
[1:25:39] this is where the water is Flowing from
[1:25:41] this is the meal that was ground this is
[1:25:44] my portion this is my life this is the
[1:25:46] only thing that will get me through
[1:25:51] let it let it change our attitudes and
[1:25:55] our respect and our value
[1:25:57] of the word
[1:26:00] let's look at James chapter one
[1:26:12] James chapter 1 verse 13.
[1:26:27] let no man say when he is tempted I am
[1:26:30] tempted of God for God cannot be tempted
[1:26:33] with evil neither tempteth he any man
[1:26:35] but every man is tempted when he is
[1:26:37] drawn away of his own lust and enticed
[1:26:41] then when lustath conceived it bringeth
[1:26:43] forth sin and sin when it is finished
[1:26:45] bringeth forth death
[1:26:49] can't blame God
[1:26:51] and you can't blame the devil
[1:26:56] who's to blame
[1:27:00] we are LED away of our own lust
[1:27:04] and enticed
[1:27:12] that's why I think it's so
[1:27:15] I think it's so
[1:27:18] I don't know what word I'm just gonna
[1:27:20] use bad so bad
[1:27:23] best descriptive word I can use
[1:27:26] when somebody will be led away of their
[1:27:29] own lust their own desire
[1:27:31] and ties tempted no sin they'll fall in
[1:27:34] sin and and in that sin they'll do a lot
[1:27:38] of damage to many people
[1:27:41] and then later they'll flip and they say
[1:27:42] well God has it all in control God
[1:27:44] allowed it for some purpose God will
[1:27:45] work good out of it all
[1:27:47] as if it's God's fault all this damage
[1:27:50] to all these people
[1:27:53] don't blame that on God that was you
[1:27:55] that was you and don't blame it on the
[1:27:57] devil
[1:27:58] you know the old saying the devil made
[1:27:59] me do it the devil didn't make you do
[1:28:01] anything the devil didn't make Eve
[1:28:03] partake of the tree she did it of her
[1:28:05] own choosing
[1:28:07] because of her own lust she wanted to
[1:28:10] know she didn't know but she wanted to
[1:28:12] know she of her own lust was enticed and
[1:28:15] she partook of sin and sin brought forth
[1:28:17] death you can't blame that on the devil
[1:28:19] you can't blame it on God you're the
[1:28:21] only one who's responsible for that
[1:28:24] if you're a child of God will he make
[1:28:26] even your mistakes work together for
[1:28:28] good absolutely will your failure even
[1:28:30] derail God's plan no it won't but that
[1:28:32] is no reason to put that on God as if
[1:28:34] it's a good thing and and neglect the
[1:28:37] damage that you've done to everybody
[1:28:38] else
[1:28:40] seen too many people do that and
[1:28:43] flipping about it and what you do is
[1:28:45] when you pin that on God you've given
[1:28:47] the people's right away to hurt
[1:28:51] and now if God did that I can't be hurt
[1:28:53] and I can't be upset now if I'm hurt or
[1:28:55] upset there's something wrong
[1:28:57] with me no there's nothing wrong with
[1:28:59] you what they did was wrong
[1:29:01] you should be hurt and they should
[1:29:02] repent for it and they should
[1:29:04] acknowledge it and they should make
[1:29:05] recompense for it and they should be
[1:29:07] sorrowful for it not flippantly say well
[1:29:09] God allowed it for some purpose
[1:29:11] everything's working together for good
[1:29:12] my goodness if it is working together
[1:29:14] for good it's the grace of God Amen the
[1:29:17] absolute pure grace of God
[1:29:24] all right
[1:29:25] I don't know but I am fed up with
[1:29:27] religion
[1:29:29] completely fed up with religion
[1:29:32] I want the reality
[1:29:34] I want the real
[1:29:36] not the statements not the not the false
[1:29:40] labels I want the reality that's all I
[1:29:44] want
[1:29:46] I've seen what religion does I grew up
[1:29:48] in religion
[1:29:49] don't want it I don't like religious
[1:29:52] rhetoric I can't stand it
[1:29:54] I want something real
[1:29:57] and I'm not saying that as if I'm saying
[1:30:00] I can't stand it over there over there I
[1:30:01] can't stand it here
[1:30:03] I can't stand it when this guy wants to
[1:30:05] get religious I hate it
[1:30:09] I want to be a real son of God
[1:30:12] completely dependent upon the spirit of
[1:30:15] God to Lead Me in the word of God to
[1:30:16] instruct me I want to walk as he is a
[1:30:19] lamp unto my feet and a light into my
[1:30:21] path and I want to step by light
[1:30:23] word by word is how I want to walk
[1:30:27] that's my greatest desire
[1:30:32] it's like a second Corinthians
[1:30:38] second Corinthians chapter 10.
[1:30:54] it says
[1:30:56] second Corinthians 10 verse 3 for though
[1:30:59] we walk in the flesh we do not war after
[1:31:01] the flesh
[1:31:03] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:31:04] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:31:06] pulling down of strongholds casting down
[1:31:09] imaginations in every High thing that
[1:31:11] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[1:31:12] God and bringing into captivity every
[1:31:15] thought to The Obedience of Christ
[1:31:17] there it is
[1:31:19] where's the greatest battle ever fought
[1:31:22] in our minds thought in the mind so what
[1:31:25] are we instructed to do the weapons of
[1:31:28] our Warfare are mighty
[1:31:31] they're not weak
[1:31:32] if we don't walk up to the flesh we
[1:31:34] don't war after the flesh that's not the
[1:31:36] problem where's the problem the problem
[1:31:39] is in our minds
[1:31:41] let's read that again for though we walk
[1:31:43] in the flesh we do not war after the
[1:31:45] flesh so this is not an outside War
[1:31:48] so I want to stop for a minute
[1:31:52] since this is where the battle is Raging
[1:31:54] started in heaven moved to Eden now it's
[1:31:56] raging in US
[1:31:59] so
[1:32:00] when God is going to have this final
[1:32:03] victory over Lucifer and the bride that
[1:32:06] final Victory will be in US
[1:32:09] the battle is in us and the Victory will
[1:32:12] be in us that's why he says the bride in
[1:32:15] the last days this end time bride amen
[1:32:18] being liberated in living his life is
[1:32:20] his victory and the reason of his death
[1:32:23] he will overcome In You and I the battle
[1:32:27] is here the victory will be here where
[1:32:29] is our Armageddon right here
[1:32:32] where do I want the white horse rider of
[1:32:34] Revelations 19 who is called the word of
[1:32:36] God I want him riding right here
[1:32:39] where's the white horse rider trying to
[1:32:41] write where's the Pale Horse trying to
[1:32:42] come to right here this is his objective
[1:32:45] amen there's a war breaking out amen but
[1:32:48] I I know through the true white horse
[1:32:50] rider is and it's Christ the word and I
[1:32:52] want him to win that final battle in me
[1:32:57] so I have to be his follower and follow
[1:33:00] after him
[1:33:01] and follow the word
[1:33:03] so it's not a fleshly battle
[1:33:06] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:33:08] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:33:10] pulling down of strongholds
[1:33:12] casting down imaginations nothing
[1:33:14] fleshly there where's imaginations in
[1:33:16] your own mind
[1:33:20] casting out imaginations in every High
[1:33:22] thing that exalted itself against the
[1:33:24] knowledge of God where does that take
[1:33:26] place in your mind
[1:33:29] and bringing into captivity every
[1:33:32] thought where does that take place in
[1:33:35] your mind
[1:33:36] where is the battle in your mind where's
[1:33:39] the devil coming he's coming to attack
[1:33:41] you in you
[1:33:45] but we must bring it to The Obedience of
[1:33:48] Christ and Christ is the Living Word
[1:33:51] we've been given something to check
[1:33:53] every thought with
[1:33:55] we've been given the word of God been
[1:33:56] restored to us to check our thoughts to
[1:33:59] check our motives to check our reasons
[1:34:01] amen and to bring all of these thoughts
[1:34:03] subject in obedience to Christ the word
[1:34:05] and say I will not accept that thought
[1:34:07] because it does not match the word
[1:34:09] I will not go that way saying I'm
[1:34:12] recognizing you in your tactics
[1:34:15] it's not
[1:34:16] it's not so much what we face out here
[1:34:19] it's what we face in here
[1:34:25] praise God
[1:34:28] let's look at uh back 1 chapter 9 9 27.
[1:34:33] oh no I'm sorry
[1:34:34] where am I I'm saying let's go to First
[1:34:36] Corinthians First Corinthians 9.
[1:34:38] sorry back one book
[1:34:40] First Corinthians chapter 9 verse 27.
[1:34:45] Paul the Apostle says here
[1:34:48] but I keep under my body and bring it
[1:34:50] into subjection lest that by any means
[1:34:52] when I have preached to others I myself
[1:34:55] should be a Castaway
[1:34:57] the Apostle Paul had to keep his own
[1:35:01] flesh in check
[1:35:03] he knew where the battle was
[1:35:05] and he knew how to win him
[1:35:09] Proverbs 3 5 says trust in the Lord with
[1:35:12] all thy heart and lean not to thine own
[1:35:14] understanding
[1:35:17] I said that's good advice
[1:35:19] trust in the Lord with all our heart and
[1:35:21] lean not to thy own understanding and
[1:35:23] all thy ways acknowledge Him and He
[1:35:25] Shall direct thy past that's what we
[1:35:27] need
[1:35:29] brother bear said in perfect strength by
[1:35:31] Perfect weakness that I've often said
[1:35:33] the greatest enemy I got is William
[1:35:35] Branham
[1:35:36] he's the one that gets in God's way he's
[1:35:38] the one that gets lazy he's the one that
[1:35:40] gets to a place sometimes where he
[1:35:42] thinks he can do something about it and
[1:35:43] when he does that shoves God right out
[1:35:45] of the picture but when I can get rid of
[1:35:47] that guy when I can get to a place that
[1:35:50] he's out of the way then God can come
[1:35:52] over and do things that William Branham
[1:35:54] knows nothing about
[1:35:55] that's when God can use you that's when
[1:35:57] he can use any of you he can use anybody
[1:35:59] when we get out of the way but as long
[1:36:01] as we got
[1:36:02] ourselves in the way
[1:36:04] then we cannot
[1:36:09] I don't want to get in God's way
[1:36:11] I want God to have his own way
[1:36:14] and the message proving his word brother
[1:36:16] bear says now I
[1:36:18] I to heal I cannot you know that what is
[1:36:21] a gift brother Benham something you take
[1:36:23] no it's something you know how to get
[1:36:25] yourself out of the way
[1:36:27] as long as you're there it'll never work
[1:36:29] William Branham is the greatest enemy I
[1:36:31] got but when I get him out of the way
[1:36:34] see then Jesus Christ can use the body
[1:36:37] he's not just talking about for
[1:36:39] prophetic Ministry he's talking about
[1:36:40] for you and I
[1:36:42] when we can just get out of the way how
[1:36:43] do I get out of the way when we forget
[1:36:45] our own selves
[1:36:48] when we forget our own desires our own
[1:36:50] passions our own wants and just
[1:36:52] surrender to him and and and quit
[1:36:55] worrying about who's watching or whether
[1:36:57] we get credit or what everybody else
[1:36:59] thinks
[1:37:00] that's all self that's all based on
[1:37:02] Pride anything that's all going to steer
[1:37:03] Us in the wrong direction
[1:37:09] and the message communion brother
[1:37:12] remember says like in the book here
[1:37:15] and the spot there was talking about the
[1:37:17] two books being one The Book of Life The
[1:37:19] First Book of Life coming up was when
[1:37:20] you were born that was your natural
[1:37:22] birth but then one time way back down in
[1:37:25] there there was a little grain of life
[1:37:26] as I was explaining to some of the young
[1:37:28] sisters at the house this afternoon
[1:37:29] there was a grain of Life laying there
[1:37:32] that you wonder where did it come from
[1:37:34] what these strange things I was saying
[1:37:37] this taking for myself taking for myself
[1:37:39] like he was going to say William Branham
[1:37:41] well 40 years ago the William Branham it
[1:37:44] isn't the same one tonight
[1:37:46] if somebody back there would say William
[1:37:48] Branham he was a rank Rascal see because
[1:37:50] I was born of Charles and Ella Branham
[1:37:53] in their nature I was a sinner I come to
[1:37:56] the world a liar and all the habits of
[1:37:58] the world laid right in me but down in
[1:38:00] there too was another nature presidency
[1:38:02] predestinated was in there by God and in
[1:38:05] this same body see two Natures in there
[1:38:09] well I only catered to one as it growed
[1:38:12] I grewed as a baby Dada first thing you
[1:38:14] know I became a liar became everything
[1:38:16] else that's a sinner because I raised up
[1:38:18] that way but down in there was a little
[1:38:20] speck of Life all the time
[1:38:23] what was it there was another William
[1:38:25] Branham
[1:38:27] was he talking about his real
[1:38:28] identification who he really is
[1:38:31] was that seed down on the inside which
[1:38:33] is a part of God which is part of the
[1:38:35] word
[1:38:37] see a little spot of eternal life
[1:38:40] down there from the genes of God the
[1:38:42] word of God that was placed in there
[1:38:43] each one of you can think of similar
[1:38:45] things it was working
[1:38:47] then look up to the trees and think Leaf
[1:38:49] I seen you fall off last year and where
[1:38:51] are you going back there again where'd
[1:38:53] you come from what brought you here
[1:38:55] it was the eternal life working in the
[1:38:57] body
[1:38:58] now then one day as I walked on The
[1:39:00] Voice Talk don't never smoke drink or so
[1:39:03] forth and the young fellas at all and
[1:39:05] all got older and there was something
[1:39:07] moving but yet all at once I looked up
[1:39:10] and I said I'm not the son of Charles
[1:39:12] and Ella Brandon there's something
[1:39:14] calling like my little Eagle I'm not a
[1:39:16] chicken there's something up yonder
[1:39:18] somewhere oh great Jehovah wherever you
[1:39:20] are open up I want to come home there's
[1:39:23] something in me calling
[1:39:25] then I was born again that little life
[1:39:27] was laying there the life of water was
[1:39:29] poured upon it then it began to grow now
[1:39:32] the old life was forgiven put in the sea
[1:39:34] of God's forgiveness to Never Be
[1:39:36] Remembered against me no more now we
[1:39:38] stand Justified as though we never had
[1:39:40] sinned in the presence of God
[1:39:43] that's that's our story
[1:39:46] there was there was another you deep
[1:39:49] down inside the real you the one that
[1:39:51] God intended not the one that would come
[1:39:53] through hybridization but the one that
[1:39:55] was in his mind before the foundation of
[1:39:57] the world the one that he wanted to
[1:39:58] fellowship with in flesh
[1:40:02] and it was there and it's been part of
[1:40:05] you all the time but it was laying there
[1:40:07] dormant and brother Brandon even talks
[1:40:10] about times that that little that little
[1:40:12] seed would jump or or would have uh
[1:40:14] bring an emotion when you'd hear
[1:40:16] somebody preach and you would think
[1:40:17] something he said that was that seed
[1:40:18] back there then
[1:40:20] but it was waiting for the time to come
[1:40:22] to life amen and when it come under the
[1:40:24] the outpouring of the word of God Amen
[1:40:27] the spirit of God moving from his word
[1:40:29] that water hit that seed and it come to
[1:40:32] life amen and brought you back to the
[1:40:34] reality of who you really are
[1:40:38] then you look at the outside and you say
[1:40:40] I'm not the son of this and this I this
[1:40:43] isn't who I am this is only where I'm
[1:40:46] living
[1:40:48] says who I am this is only where I dwell
[1:40:53] and then we begin to separate these
[1:40:55] things out like the wheat the wheat seed
[1:40:57] inside the cockle bar and it will be
[1:41:00] that way until the body change
[1:41:04] and I realize I have got to feed the
[1:41:08] seed
[1:41:10] I have got to water the seed and I've
[1:41:13] got to cut off all nutrition from the
[1:41:15] cockle bird
[1:41:17] like the black dog and the white dog
[1:41:19] they're fighting they're at War what am
[1:41:22] I going to do amen I can no more save
[1:41:24] myself than anything I can't help myself
[1:41:26] the only thing I can do is give all the
[1:41:29] nutrition to the white dog I can and
[1:41:31] starve the black dog
[1:41:33] that's all I can do and if I do that
[1:41:36] amen the life that's in that seed will
[1:41:38] take over and do its own thing I don't
[1:41:41] have to do it listen when you talk about
[1:41:43] just take the analogy of the white dog
[1:41:45] and the black dog you don't have to make
[1:41:47] the white dog strong you don't have to
[1:41:49] make the white dog Victorious all you
[1:41:51] got to do is feed the white dog starve
[1:41:53] the black dog it's already in the dog to
[1:41:56] win
[1:41:59] it's already in the seed to win it's
[1:42:02] already in the seed to produce the word
[1:42:03] it's already in the seed to produce the
[1:42:05] Life of Christ what do you have to do
[1:42:07] keep pouring the water on keep staying
[1:42:09] in the fountain where the water is
[1:42:11] pouring out from the Fresh word of the
[1:42:13] hour
[1:42:15] strengthen be strengthened in the Inner
[1:42:18] Man
[1:42:19] and he will win the victory over the
[1:42:22] outer man
[1:42:24] there's been so much effort and so much
[1:42:26] trying and so much self-reformation and
[1:42:29] so much governments of religion amen and
[1:42:31] it never works
[1:42:34] but what works is when the life
[1:42:37] is nourished
[1:42:39] fed watered and produces its own life
[1:42:47] brother Brown says
[1:42:51] it he starts to share about his life and
[1:42:53] struggles of his life
[1:42:55] he starts talking about getting blue and
[1:42:58] feeling like nobody cares for him and
[1:43:01] he had that cockle bar outside
[1:43:04] he still had it
[1:43:07] he says he got down started feeling blue
[1:43:09] like nobody cares
[1:43:12] feeling like he hadn't done anything for
[1:43:13] the Lord
[1:43:15] and he was feeling Melancholy and
[1:43:17] depressed
[1:43:19] and he says now you know that's just you
[1:43:21] it's just you doing that
[1:43:23] brother man was he was able to separate
[1:43:26] those things and realize that's just the
[1:43:28] outside cockle burner
[1:43:31] I'm so glad that he was honest showing
[1:43:33] us that we all still have to deal with
[1:43:35] that outside cockle bird
[1:43:38] but oh the solution
[1:43:41] is on the inside
[1:43:43] the solution is in the spirit to walk in
[1:43:46] the spirit and not fulfill the lust of
[1:43:48] the flesh
[1:43:49] walking with the Lord
[1:43:53] let's turn to Ephesians chapter 3
[1:43:55] together
[1:44:16] for this cause
[1:44:19] I bow my knees unto the father of our
[1:44:21] Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole
[1:44:22] family in Heaven and Earth is named that
[1:44:26] he would Grant you according to the
[1:44:27] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[1:44:29] with might by the spirit in the inner
[1:44:31] man that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[1:44:34] by faith that you being rooted and
[1:44:36] grounded in love may be able to
[1:44:38] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[1:44:40] breath and the length and the depth and
[1:44:43] the height and to know the love of
[1:44:45] Christ which passes knowledge that you
[1:44:47] might be filled with all the fullness of
[1:44:50] of God
[1:44:51] let that be our life
[1:44:54] and let that be our solution
[1:44:56] man let's all Stand Together musicians
[1:44:59] if you'll come
[1:45:10] you know
[1:45:13] there's no guarantee
[1:45:17] that we'll all be sitting like this all
[1:45:20] the way through to the end to the change
[1:45:21] of the body
[1:45:23] there's no guarantee that we'll go get
[1:45:26] to listen to a preacher preach it may
[1:45:28] may not I have no idea
[1:45:31] but one thing's for certain
[1:45:34] that we all need to learn how to
[1:45:37] overcome ourselves
[1:45:40] we all need to learn how to feed the
[1:45:43] white dog and not the black dog we all
[1:45:45] need to learn not to trust ourselves
[1:45:47] because we may find ourselves alone we
[1:45:49] may find our fellowship separated and
[1:45:52] what are you going to do then
[1:45:55] there will be
[1:45:57] no system no form no strength that comes
[1:46:00] from the camaraderie and fellowship of
[1:46:02] saints
[1:46:04] we better learn how to walk in the
[1:46:07] spirits
[1:46:08] and let the Lord lead us and to not
[1:46:11] trust ourselves
[1:46:14] the the biggest problem that man has had
[1:46:17] is becoming his own God
[1:46:20] it's my personal opinion
[1:46:22] I think the biggest problem mankind has
[1:46:24] had is becoming his own God
[1:46:26] believing his own Notions believing his
[1:46:29] own thoughts believing his own
[1:46:30] Revelations
[1:46:32] he ends up becoming his own God
[1:46:35] and I say thank God that he's given us
[1:46:37] something in this day to check every
[1:46:40] thought with
[1:46:42] he's given us his word which is his mind
[1:46:45] which brings his spirit and now we can
[1:46:48] walk in the spirit not partially but
[1:46:51] fully and we can surrender not partially
[1:46:54] but fully
[1:46:56] this message has become so valuable to
[1:46:58] me
[1:46:59] it is the most valuable thing in all the
[1:47:02] world to me is this word that God has
[1:47:04] restored to us
[1:47:05] take away everything I have but do not
[1:47:07] take this word from me
[1:47:09] because it is everything it is it is the
[1:47:13] water from the rock it is the Manna From
[1:47:15] Heaven it is what God has given me to
[1:47:18] keep me from deception in this hour
[1:47:20] and that word is not just print on paper
[1:47:24] that's how we read it that's how we
[1:47:26] ingest it
[1:47:27] but that word is a living reality a
[1:47:30] person
[1:47:31] that we're uniting with
[1:47:33] that if we receive him and him only and
[1:47:36] we receive the bridegroom into the
[1:47:38] garden amen and we keep the wall up and
[1:47:40] keep everything else shut up but we
[1:47:42] receive the bridegroom into the garden
[1:47:43] then the bridegroom wants to come to the
[1:47:45] garden and enjoy what's in the garden
[1:47:47] and then there's fellowship with one
[1:47:49] another and everything else is sealed
[1:47:51] out that's the relationship we're
[1:47:53] looking for today
[1:47:55] and all the world Fallen to chaos and
[1:47:57] everything's in Blackness and everything
[1:47:59] is uncertain there's a fellowship going
[1:48:02] on in the garden
[1:48:04] that's enjoyed between the bridegroom
[1:48:07] and the bride
[1:48:09] and that's what I want in this hour I'm
[1:48:12] going to yield to him and walk in the
[1:48:14] spirit and not fulfill the lust of the
[1:48:17] flesh
[1:48:18] I don't know about you but I don't trust
[1:48:20] chat nav
[1:48:22] he's the guy that always gets in the way
[1:48:25] he's the guy that creates all the
[1:48:27] problems listen I've got problems
[1:48:30] and I've created all of them myself
[1:48:35] you can't you can't control sometimes
[1:48:38] things that happen to you in life things
[1:48:40] are going to happen we live in this life
[1:48:42] there's going to be things that happen
[1:48:44] but the only thing you can control is
[1:48:46] your response to what happens
[1:48:49] and many times what we struggle with is
[1:48:51] not what happened but how we responded
[1:48:53] to it
[1:48:54] many times our problems are not coming
[1:48:56] from just what happened but what we did
[1:48:58] in response to what happened
[1:49:02] and then when we get down to the end of
[1:49:04] it we really can't blame anybody else
[1:49:08] I mean when God came to Adam Adam said
[1:49:11] the woman which thou gave me
[1:49:13] came to the woman the woman said the
[1:49:14] serpent
[1:49:16] he didn't even give the serpent an
[1:49:17] opportunity to explain
[1:49:21] this is the tendency of mankind but when
[1:49:23] we really realize listen the problem is
[1:49:26] me
[1:49:28] and I have got to surrender to this word
[1:49:30] and let him live his life in me if I'm
[1:49:33] ever going to have victory over this
[1:49:35] because now I know where the battle is
[1:49:37] the battle's here
[1:49:39] now I know where the garden is the
[1:49:40] garden is here now I know what's going
[1:49:42] on and what Satan's trying to destroy
[1:49:43] and stop it's this life coming from here
[1:49:46] and I want to yield that completely to
[1:49:48] God and for Christ to have victory in
[1:49:51] here
[1:49:52] amen let's bow our heads and pray
[1:49:56] dear Lord Jesus we thank you for your
[1:49:58] word
[1:49:59] and God as time goes on it becomes more
[1:50:03] real
[1:50:04] more personal
[1:50:06] more pertinent Lord
[1:50:08] God I don't know how to preach it and
[1:50:12] the fullness of its power and the
[1:50:14] Revelation which I received in my heart
[1:50:17] I I'm depending on you Lord
[1:50:20] to drop into everybody's heart
[1:50:23] the the desperate condition that we're
[1:50:26] in
[1:50:28] God but you made a provision
[1:50:31] in this hour and we're so thankful for
[1:50:33] that
[1:50:34] you've not left us to ourselves you've
[1:50:37] not left us to figure it out on our own
[1:50:39] but you've provided the food that we
[1:50:41] need
[1:50:41] you provided the water you provided the
[1:50:44] light you've given us everything we need
[1:50:46] to come to life and to overcome
[1:50:49] help us to stay in that Lord to respect
[1:50:52] it to give reverence and value to it
[1:50:55] Lord and let you have the place that you
[1:50:57] deserve and preeminence in US
[1:51:00] well forgive us Lord for our failures
[1:51:02] forgive us for giving to the wrong
[1:51:04] giving time and attention to the wrong
[1:51:06] things
[1:51:08] forgive us Lord
[1:51:10] help us to keep you the central theme of
[1:51:12] Our Lives
[1:51:13] the most important thing in all of our
[1:51:15] life Lord is to please you to serve you
[1:51:18] and surrender to you may that be our
[1:51:21] desire Lord
[1:51:22] God I love you and I thank you for what
[1:51:25] you're doing in this hour
[1:51:27] Lord your Prophet said as it comes Lord
[1:51:29] to the capping that it takes a lot of
[1:51:32] Shaving down
[1:51:34] he said take a lot of Shaving down for
[1:51:36] him a lot of Shaving down for us
[1:51:39] God let your word shave us down
[1:51:43] cut all the carnal away
[1:51:45] cut all the selfishness and all the
[1:51:47] pride away
[1:51:49] let us Lord be yielded to you
[1:51:52] nor may it be such a life that you live
[1:51:55] through us that we can take no credit
[1:51:57] for it whatsoever
[1:51:58] that it wouldn't be us but it would be
[1:52:00] you living in us doing what we're
[1:52:02] incapable of doing on our own
[1:52:05] oh my beloved come into your garden
[1:52:09] come in
[1:52:11] come into the garden behind the wall
[1:52:14] and enjoy Lord your place
[1:52:18] I love you father
[1:52:20] I ask that you'd help us Lord to stay
[1:52:22] guarded against the deception that's so
[1:52:25] close
[1:52:26] to stay yielded to the life that will
[1:52:28] give us freedom
[1:52:29] we love you father and we ask for your
[1:52:31] blessings over this congregation over
[1:52:33] our own lives
[1:52:34] help us to walk closer to you day by day
[1:52:38] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:52:42] I just want to share something out of
[1:52:44] scripture if that's all right before we
[1:52:45] go into communion if we could all take
[1:52:47] our Bibles and Turn the Song of Solomon
[1:52:49] I want to look at one scripture that we
[1:52:51] looked at this morning
[1:52:53] I was just meditating it was just on my
[1:52:55] heart to just look at this again
[1:52:58] and um it won't be but just a minute and
[1:53:00] then we'll go right into the communion
[1:53:03] scriptures The Song of Solomon
[1:53:10] chapter 4.
[1:53:15] verse 12 Song of Solomon
[1:53:18] chapter 4 verse 12.
[1:53:21] a garden
[1:53:22] enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring
[1:53:25] shut up a fountain sealed thy plants are
[1:53:28] an orchard of pomegranates with Pleasant
[1:53:30] fruits campfire with Spike nerd Spike
[1:53:32] nerd and saffron calamus and cinnamon
[1:53:35] with all trees of Frankincense myrrh and
[1:53:36] aloes with all the chief spices a
[1:53:39] fountain of gardens a well of Living
[1:53:41] Waters and streams from Lebanon
[1:53:44] to an amazing description he has this
[1:53:47] amazing way that the bridegroom has of
[1:53:50] describing his bride
[1:53:52] and I wanted to look especially at verse
[1:53:54] 12 we talked about it this morning a
[1:53:57] garden enclosed
[1:53:58] is my sister my spouse a spring shut up
[1:54:01] a fountain sealed and I I mentioned this
[1:54:05] morning I believe at least I said
[1:54:06] something about this is a it's a type of
[1:54:08] her virginity it's showing that she's
[1:54:10] been sealed she's been separated she's
[1:54:12] preserved for her bridegroom and we know
[1:54:15] that the bride has also been preserved
[1:54:17] for her bridegroom and I was meditating
[1:54:20] on this and the word Garden here we went
[1:54:22] over this morning it means an enclosure
[1:54:24] or an enclosed Garden it's also in the
[1:54:27] concordance it's figurative of a bride
[1:54:28] so this is enclosure with an E ENC if
[1:54:32] you look at the word the garden enclosed
[1:54:35] then you have enclosed Inc so these are
[1:54:37] two different enclosures an enclosure
[1:54:40] and an enclosure and it's two different
[1:54:42] words in the Hebrew uh the one is an
[1:54:45] enclosure an enclosed Garden or a garden
[1:54:48] with a wall around it but this enclosed
[1:54:51] is bar are locked or bolted
[1:54:54] so it's not just with a protective wall
[1:54:57] but it has literally been sealed it's
[1:55:00] been barred it's been locked
[1:55:03] and and God has preserved his bride for
[1:55:06] himself
[1:55:07] he has a way of preserving his bride for
[1:55:10] himself and we we talked about that and
[1:55:12] I wanted to share that in context of
[1:55:14] what we're talking about this morning
[1:55:16] and I want to read this quote out of
[1:55:19] Christ as the mystery of God revealed
[1:55:21] and this is beginning in paragraph 466.
[1:55:25] it says how do you know because you're a
[1:55:26] church member because Christ is living
[1:55:29] through you so pregnant with his spirit
[1:55:31] that you're a prisoner to anything else
[1:55:33] you're confined oh my to the gospel
[1:55:36] confined to the word and all the
[1:55:38] children that you can bring forth is
[1:55:40] that because you're a prisoner you can't
[1:55:42] commit adultery you're already pregnated
[1:55:45] Glory he can't take a hold the womb of
[1:55:48] life is closed to anything else you're
[1:55:51] already his by predestination that seed
[1:55:54] has come to life no world can get in oh
[1:55:58] how we'd like to stay on that for about
[1:56:00] a an hour I'm sure you understand Christ
[1:56:03] in his alone already finished the seed
[1:56:05] was there the seed was already you're
[1:56:08] talking about the the Eternal sieging of
[1:56:10] God was already in the womb of your soul
[1:56:13] the seed was there the seed was already
[1:56:15] when was it put there before the
[1:56:17] foundation of the world was
[1:56:19] predestinated us unto eternal life and
[1:56:22] as soon as the life-giving flow the
[1:56:24] seedling there other seeds that just
[1:56:27] would come in wouldn't take hold just
[1:56:29] couldn't do it like but when that seed
[1:56:32] come in quickly it stopped up the womb
[1:56:34] all the rest of the seed was drove out
[1:56:36] see like that and you become a prisoner
[1:56:39] surrounded in Christ Christ in you to
[1:56:42] his life bringing forth his evidence his
[1:56:44] signs oh my look bringing his Signs of
[1:56:47] Life as evident of his resurrection
[1:56:49] proving to the world that eternal life
[1:56:51] vindicates to the world that we're alive
[1:56:54] in him
[1:56:55] so I I find this passage of scripture
[1:56:58] fascinating because I had asked myself
[1:57:00] the question
[1:57:01] some time ago that brother brother
[1:57:03] Branham says so clearly that the Bride
[1:57:06] is a virgin she's a virgin to the word
[1:57:08] she's a virgin bride but we all know
[1:57:11] that we have believed wrong things in
[1:57:13] the past we all know that we were part
[1:57:15] of denominational systems part of wrong
[1:57:17] ideas then how can she be a virgin how
[1:57:21] can she be a garden enclosed
[1:57:24] and it's because no matter what you've
[1:57:26] received into the womb of your mind
[1:57:27] that's just Spirit realm but there there
[1:57:30] was a seed sealed amen sealed in the
[1:57:33] womb of your soul and it would only open
[1:57:36] to one thing and only one person is
[1:57:39] qualified to open the seal of life and
[1:57:41] that is Jesus Christ himself amen the
[1:57:44] word was laying there and only the word
[1:57:46] for your season would open the wound to
[1:57:49] allow access to the word amen and there
[1:57:52] was the word coming to the word so we
[1:57:55] have been a garden enclosed and many of
[1:57:57] us gave our bodies to vileness we gave
[1:58:00] our minds to wrong seducing spirits but
[1:58:02] God had a way of sealing something down
[1:58:05] in the soul where his garden is and
[1:58:07] nothing was going to get to that seed
[1:58:09] until he came on the scene
[1:58:12] so when he talks about the virginity of
[1:58:15] the Bride it doesn't mean that we never
[1:58:17] had a wrong thought or believed the
[1:58:20] wrong thing amen but those seeds could
[1:58:23] never take hold he said because it's
[1:58:25] different it's a different seed those
[1:58:27] seeds can't mix it can't even get to
[1:58:29] where this seed is
[1:58:31] many things come into the womb of our
[1:58:34] mind amen and we know that we can
[1:58:36] conceive there and it can drop down but
[1:58:38] it couldn't conceive and drop down
[1:58:39] because it's a different species
[1:58:41] altogether so that seed amen the seed of
[1:58:45] cat could never conceive in a dog
[1:58:49] that makes sense
[1:58:51] so it has to be rejected it can come in
[1:58:54] but it's rejected the seat of Hope can
[1:58:57] never conceive and a cow amen so there
[1:58:59] was never a conception there was never
[1:59:01] anything that broke the seal in that
[1:59:03] wound in that enclosed Garden until the
[1:59:06] bridegroom come along with the word for
[1:59:08] the day and he opened the seals and he
[1:59:10] sowed the seed and Seed came to seed
[1:59:13] word came to word life came to life and
[1:59:15] sprung forth in line
[1:59:17] it was you were a garden enclosed amen
[1:59:21] you were protected you were kept until
[1:59:23] you could come in contact with the
[1:59:25] bridegroom
[1:59:27] I am so thankful for this message
[1:59:30] I am so thankful that God had a way to
[1:59:33] bring us light in this day amen that
[1:59:35] would chase away all the confusion and
[1:59:37] the obscurity even the confusion of Our
[1:59:40] Lives
[1:59:42] brother bam said when he received the
[1:59:44] Lord he said when he broke the seals of
[1:59:47] my life
[1:59:49] he said the the book was sealed and you
[1:59:52] were sealed with the book you've been
[1:59:53] sealed all along and only the lamb can
[1:59:56] break the seals and he's the one who
[1:59:57] broke the seal and the womb of your soul
[2:00:00] amen and he planted himself there
[2:00:02] because he was already there
[2:00:05] life came to life word came to word
[2:00:09] I'm so thankful that I couldn't lock
[2:00:14] myself up tight enough to protect myself
[2:00:17] I
[2:00:20] how many times have we failed
[2:00:22] how many failures can we list
[2:00:26] but I'm so thankful that God had a
[2:00:28] garden enclosed
[2:00:31] he barred it and locked it by his
[2:00:33] predestinated will
[2:00:35] and it would only unlock to one
[2:00:37] combination
[2:00:38] and that combination is the revealed
[2:00:40] word for the hour
[2:00:42] and when that unlocked then a seed would
[2:00:44] come in that could conceive
[2:00:47] and when it conceived it drove out all
[2:00:50] other seeds everything else left your
[2:00:52] mind every other idea moved out it's
[2:00:55] been rejected it could never bring
[2:00:57] conception only this seed of this word
[2:00:59] can bring conception
[2:01:01] I'm so glad
[2:01:03] that though I wasn't doing a very good
[2:01:05] job of keeping myself virgin to the word
[2:01:07] he kept me virgin
[2:01:09] do the work
[2:01:11] uh what a consolation friends
[2:01:14] how can we not love him
[2:01:17] when he's done all of this for us how
[2:01:19] can he not serve him and give him our
[2:01:21] lives when he has done everything for us
[2:01:24] what have we done nothing
[2:01:28] brother Venom can get to come down
[2:01:30] towards the end of his life
[2:01:32] and he can be laying on with his hands
[2:01:35] behind his head in 1960 after having a a
[2:01:37] Ministry worldwide Ministry healing and
[2:01:39] deliverance and all of these things that
[2:01:41] have taken place uh uh he can lay there
[2:01:44] and say well well old boy
[2:01:47] if you're ever going to do something for
[2:01:48] the Lord you better get started
[2:01:51] and when we compare ourselves with that
[2:01:53] we think why even get started
[2:01:57] because he said he goes I wasn't the one
[2:02:00] down on the river that day I'm not the
[2:02:02] one who opened the Blind and dice I was
[2:02:04] only standing near when he didn't that's
[2:02:06] the reality friends
[2:02:09] I didn't save myself
[2:02:11] he saved me
[2:02:13] I could never be my own savior am I part
[2:02:15] of Christ yes am I part of the word yes
[2:02:17] but I could never save myself
[2:02:19] he's saved me he's my savior he's my
[2:02:23] lord it's his plan he he deserves my
[2:02:25] devotion my life my love my everything
[2:02:29] and that's what I want to give to him
[2:02:31] I was throwing my life away and he was
[2:02:33] holding me in a virgin condition
[2:02:36] in the womb of my soul he was keeping a
[2:02:39] garden enclosed and I had no idea
[2:02:42] and I was opening my spirit realm to so
[2:02:44] many seducing spirits and he was holding
[2:02:46] my virginity in his hand
[2:02:49] I thank God for that
[2:02:52] I'm so thankful I'm so thankful that he
[2:02:56] knew how to pick the lock
[2:02:58] he had the key
[2:03:00] and the key was the word for our day
[2:03:03] don't you love him
[2:03:05] I love him
[2:03:07] let's all stand and we'll read our
[2:03:08] communion scriptures
[2:03:11] and we'll go to communion
[2:03:13] with a joy and a Thanksgiving in our
[2:03:15] heart
[2:03:16] for we know who we are and we know who
[2:03:18] he is and we know who saved us we know
[2:03:21] who's redeemed us and we know whose
[2:03:22] blood was shed for us
[2:03:24] and by that Revelation he also revealed
[2:03:28] who we are and how we fit into his plan
[2:03:31] we're thankful for them
[2:03:34] [Laughter]
[2:03:37] [Music]
