am [Music] it's just power heads heavenly father lord how we do love you lord we look back through our lives and we see that your grace and your mercy lord was extended to us first and how could we not love you lord when we were lost and weary we were broken and we were oh lord we were destroying ourselves with our own human lusts our own human ideas father you came down reached down and you picked us up lord there's been nothing good in any of us all we can say is lord thank you lord we love you we appreciate your mercy and your grace that you extended to us father lord we've come before you this day we counted a great honor great privilege many people around the world don't have the ability that we have this morning lord to be a people that know that you love us that you've called us that you've chosen us and you've not forgotten about us you're walking this life with us how privileged of a people we are father i pray now that you'll just come and your promise was that you have already come for where there are two or three gathered in my name there i am in the midst of them so father we thank you for this great honor this great privilege we bow our heads in humility lord realizing we're in your presence father come do a supernatural work in our midst lord take this flesh and make it the word father lord we love you search our hearts find anything wicked anything evil lord help us take it away we want to be like you each and every day we commit this time into your hands in jesus name amen amen you may be seated musicians thank you so very much god bless you all happy to be with you nervous as always but nonetheless happy to be with you so i uh sit in my chair yesterday i told kerry i said i just i still don't know how to preach i don't know how to do this and i was sitting in the chair and saying lord you know you give me so much inspiration and i get so filled up by inspiration i love sitting there reading and thinking about the things of god but then when it comes to actually putting it together i'm the least capable man on earth to do this you know and it's kind of feeling sorry for myself you know and then we do that from time to time and then a scripture came to my mind what is it what can the potter say or can the clay say to the potter why hastal made thee thus and then i felt like job i put my hand over my mouth i say nothing i i speak foolishly lord thou has made us dust so there's a reason for things there's a reason why everybody's built a certain way why our makeup is a certain way it's because we have a certain portion of god in us that must be fulfilled so we begin to rest in those promises so i just want to get these announcements out of the way that's the part that makes me nervous is uh i wanted to tell you i heard from brother chad he safely landed he's there in uganda and with brother abraham i believe he has two services today he might have already been preaching one i don't exactly know the time difference but they're there already and then so keep him in prayer though brother moses says to mercy got a text from them they landed safely they made it to uganda as well so we're happy for them and uh we got brother ben up north we got brother emmanuel and congo so it's getting quieter as you can tell the amen voices what am i going to do i'm going to initiate somebody i'm just delegating brother brian you're going to pick up the pace brother so we got brother ben preaching up at brother dan holt's keep him in prayer they have a service now and i heard from brother clayton sister wanda i don't know if they're here but i called him yesterday they're doing better but they're still pretty pretty sick so pretty pretty tired sister wanda has been struggling with it now since september coven and brother clayton's still on oxygen so we bear one another's burdens keep them in prayer before the lord they could really they really appreciate those prayers and uh also talked about the bob sister suzanne i don't know if they're here but nonetheless they're doing good brother bob was ready to run on the treadmill i'm like hold on brother maybe maybe walk on treadmill and then you'll be all right he's he's ready to go he's ready to get back to action but we sure we love them we're a family we're a little family we bear each other up and i want to also say thank you i appreciate the many cards and little notes and text messages i received carrie got coven she got pretty sick and she was down for like seven days and she's way tougher than me if it was me i've been down for like two months and uh but she's back in action she's feeling good and she's here with us and we appreciate that it really means a lot when you know you have the people that care about you you know brother branham says god heals by love you just let let just love somebody who's kind of weary and down and how and it has a way of bringing them right out of that it's kind of an amazing thing ain't it so we appreciate that i also want to let you know there is a youth meeting today we'll be having youth meeting right over here in the fellowship hall so you're more than welcome those that are youth um to come if you think yourself a youth then come so and uh i think that's all my announcement upcoming schedule here we got brother ben this wednesday and we got brother nathaniel science next sunday and then lord willing brother chad will be back in the pulpit that following wednesday so you'll be praying for him huh we pray for our brothers and sisters so i think that's all my announcements will you stand with me we'll just have you turn in your bibles here to first peter 5. first peter 5 verse 5. just say amen when you're there ah see you can say amen i gotcha i tricked you you can do it so first peter 5 5. it says likewise younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you you're the only one brother that's happy about that amen i think we can all say amen in this hour of distress and this hour of uncertainty i think the bride needs to be able to say hey amen he ha he beareth my burdens i have a place i can rest if there ever was a time where i think we need to be able to show the world we're not like you because we have a place of rest we're not walking this road alone i have someone that's walking with me it's us and i i am convinced more and more we're going to find out that the light shines brightest in darkest devours right amen so he careth for thee amen next scripture i'd like you to turn to matthew 11 28. matthew 11 28. says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i'll give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light you may be seated may god add his rich blessings to the word so we are not a people of distress we are a people that have a place a place that we can rest in a place that we can find satisfaction for our souls and i would like to speak for just a little bit caught a little inspiration i know it's a very simple inspiration but i kind of like how god hides himself in simplicity sometimes and he just knows the right word to say in the presence of the right person that can respond in the right way and say that ain't nothing but the truth and i think so many times we've got to keep it for what it is it's a people that god has called out that are simple lowly humble meek and in a way in a position they're built in such a way when they come in contact with the word they can say amen that ain't nothing but the truth i may not have it all figured out and i think the prophet of god said you don't figure out god you don't understand god you believe god when god comes in the presence of the people he has a people on earth that say that's the truth amen praise god it ain't nothing but the truth and i like to see that reaction and i like i think god likes to see a reaction to his actions i think god is looking for a bride who who sits back and says he's more than able oh he's fairest of ten thousand to my souls have you seen my god in action i know you're weary i know you're down and i know you're upset but see i have a place of rest i have someone i can go to in my times of distress and let's be honest the pressure's on am i the only one that realizes it i think we could say with certainty the pressure's on it's now a very distressful hour in which we are living you look at the polit political system it's a chaos it's a mess it's ridiculous it's falling apart nobody trusts it you look at the economic decision i think they came out with the inflationary numbers last week and those are probably highly manipulated but they're pretty high uh going pretty quick if you don't know much about economics that means your dollar is collapsing before your very eyes that means that the u.s economy the world reserve currency of the world is collapsing amen it's exciting for those who know it's very scary for those that are looking to have confidence in the old greenback it's dying everybody it's dying and so the reality of it is the political system's a mess the economic system is bankrupt and you look at the social fabric of america it's heartbreaking it's disgusting it is a uh it's a dog-eat-dog hatred of mankind everybody's after their selves everybody's afraid of another person be it you being a different color or a different sex or a different whatever any aspect of differentiation has now made you an enemy to what i am there's no love anywhere everybody hates everybody where it used to be one would disagree with another now it's not a disagreement that we can live with each other somebody has to die we can no longer coexist together in this state someone's going to have to die and that's the spirit of the age that is the spirit of the age and i have a warning for you your prophet of god said you better be careful not to let that spirit of the age come upon you it's a spirit of war it is a spirit of war and i can show you this in the scriptures there will be nation against nation and kingdom against kingdom father will be against daughter daughter will be against father children rebellious to their parents parents hating their children hoping they could just move out sometime what is going on it's a spirit of war in the nation and that spirit is so he is so obviously prescient on even us it's even happened to us and that's why i felt drawn to just i have a title it's learn of me pretty simple title but jesus said learn of me watch my nature watch how i act and watch how i react sometimes we're so concerned with our actions we forget about the reactions to the actions is this the truth sometimes we get we oh hey i said it right i did it right i can't help the way they responded there's just something wrong with them you know i'm going to get rid of them make some new friends here you know something like that i did it right they did it wrong you know so what it does it's a it's an hour of self-love it's an hour where men and women don't want to die and suffer for another person it's war and i found this little subject and you know i wish i like always i says you know i get my subject strange but my dog bit me yeah i know that's what i thought and i thought well you know i wish i'd come and say you know i came in contact with a bowl and i overcame it you know and you know these things i would i you know hit a hornet or a squirrel i don't know no my dog bit me and uh i learned a lesson and i told my wife i said ah you're gonna be shocked at where i got this one from but my dog bit me and um yeah last weekend we had adopted a dog right i hope this okay just be normal simple can i just be like prophet of god to the age you did little stories and little things kind of get his point that's why i love him so much god made himself so simple and uh he he was uh hi we adopted this dog and he got him from pound my daughter's kind of wanted a dog and i kind of halfway wanted a dog a little bit i've had to reconsider that thought but uh and uh so we got this dog kind of found it looked like a dog i used to have that i really liked and we got him from pound we thought he was a couple years old you know they said oh he's three years old and then it kind of has some rotten teeth we get some other people like well he's like seven or eight years old like oh took advantage of me sold me a defective dog when i got him he couldn't bark i'm like what's wrong with this dog you can't bark you can't run he had hip problems and like rotten people they sold me like used car sales and they're selling out dogs here telling me a three-year-old dog healthy fine nice and then the dog bit me so that's so interesting though we but we like the dog it's been a pretty good dog and i was telling my wife a couple weeks that's a pretty good dog i said yes and really nice dog she's like it's turned out to be a really good dog you know and i was like yeah not too bad not too bad good dog and then it bit me and i'm like you rotten no good dog defective from the beginning never should have took you take you back to the pound from which i rescued you from you know what i'm saying you're like i feed you i house you i even got him a little coat for winter i mean we spent like 30 bucks you know like you bite the hand that feeds you and i was ready to take him back i'll be honest with you i said we're gonna get rid of you one way or the other my friend and my wife's like now don't do that you probably did something wrong and i had to stop thinking about it and so i'll tell you just what happened was we had this dog and it was night time so it's an older dog and we're pretty sure he was probably abused not really taking good care of he's a little bit scared of a man me loves my girls loves my wife but he's just very cautious about a man so pretty sure he probably had a rough past he probably was beaten a little bit there dealt with harshly and um you know he's is he was tired it was nighttime i had taken him downstairs we put him in our back room and in the back room there and it's about nine o'clock and he gets a little moody when he's tired like all of us we get just a little bit moody and he gets a little moody he gets a little tired and i took him downstairs and it was cold it was last week you know it got real cold and windy and it was cold down there and i thought man it's cold you know i know he's got some hip problems so i'm going to move his bed you know over here to this to another dog or watch right now keep them a little warmer the warmth they can warm each other up you know i'm thinking about the dog i'm thinking listen i'm gonna help you out my friend i want you to be cold at night well i moved him when he was still laying on the bed and i didn't even think about it i was like he latched down on my hand still got a nice little scab there and he really latched hard to the point at first shock and then yelling at him to pry his mouth off my hand and then said in i will deal with you i will show you i i will handle this and uh uh you know then my wife come and stuff and then so a couple days ago i went for a walk just meditating on different things different scriptures and that story and that that dog biting me came back to my mind and i'm just funny enough to know when brother banham says if you're looking for god you can find him in anything sorry i think let's all stay simple like that if you're looking for him you can see him in about anything and see him in a storm in a rainbow and a sunset you can see god in anything and i was thinking now why'd that dog bite me you know and i and i i just went for the walk and i don't know why i just kept start thinking now why don't you walk that story for a second just strange you know it's like me i'm like why would i take the time to consider this i want to send him back to the pal and i got the thing and i said you know what that dog was scarred somewhere in life that dog had no doubt been beaten or abused or something that caused him to be afraid of me of a man he was cautious and he misunderstood my action of love for an action of aggression he misunderstood me and when he bit me i misunderstood him i think you rotten aggressive no good dog but he was scared he his immediate reaction the only thing he could do was bite me he couldn't say now sir please back away from my bed i can't do it i appreciate you wanting to move my bed to this little warmer location but at this time i i would like to with withdraw from your request to move your bed you know not possible i'm going to bite you instant reaction attack instant reaction that's what a dog does he bites and so i said well he misunderstood me i misunderstood him how we going to move forward now we can only move forward because now i can understand why he did it i can understand he's that i he he did what he had to do in order to protect himself and i did what i was i was going to do now i'm not going to do what i was going to do because i can understand why he did what he did makes sense many times we react to people many times we fight back because we get hurt and many times we don't understand the reaction of somebody else and we react in a nature that is not lamb-like it's just not lamb like and i you get to thinking about this and the hour in which we're living i believe we're going to see a great display of the lamb of god again because brother branham said my ministry types that of john the baptist where john the baptist said behold the lamb my ministry will be saying the same behold the lamb of god and take away the sins of the world there he is and there she is i believe when she's described in the bible she's called the bible says behold the lamb and the lamb's wife the nature of the lamb on display and the only really time that you can find the lamb-like nature coming out is when you come in contact with a wolf-like nature that's the time you really get to finding out what's on the inside that's really the testing time that's really the time that makes you stop and consider where we at and what are we doing and because this is spirit of the age i want to look at a couple of these scriptures and and oh sorry i forgot i got this and realizing where we are and why we're doing what we're doing ii timothy 3 says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come men will be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection see losing love one for another truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god it's a spirit it's an attitude it's it's it's clearly an attitude of self-preservation and self-love and it is the absolute polar opposite of the nature of the lamb of god it is completely 100 percent not his nature matthew 24 nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be famines and pestilences and earthquakes look spirit of war they shall deliver you to the afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake see it is no longer we can tolerate your differences no it's time to exterminate you can see it's building on people it's an attitude you can sense it you can feel there's no longer any ability to cope with a difference there's no ability to um you would say long suffer with somebody it is not possible any longer with the spirit that's upon this age to handle anybody of difference so the only thing we can do is kill you that's what the scripture says we will deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and shall and there shall be many offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall arise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold safe to say that that's happening it's very safe to say very safe to say that we are living in an age where there's such a coldness in the land it's really a coldness a lack of real love and sincerity that once used to be there it's no longer there any longer and i'll tell you something that's my only place of rest any longer that's my place of rest you know why i like to come to church i know i'm identified with a group of people that love me though i make mistakes don't you like to have fellowship with men and women like that i'm not the only one do i what's a real friend he sticks with you in good and in bad why do you love your wife she's been with you and good and in bad why do you love the lord he sticks with you in the good and in the bad i'm so glad his love toward me does not change based upon my human ability to do things right his love never changes he doesn't love me more because i make i do good he doesn't love me less because i don't do what's right his love is an elective love god chose man if that don't make you say amen i don't know what does it did not matter what you did it did not matter you're his god chose you god elected you god perseveres and copes and trains and continues to walk beside you though you try to throw him off i love that about him i really do how could one so great come to someone like us so insignificant and nothing and he so desirous to walk with you though you smack him though you kick him though you say leave me alone he still keeps walking with you and anybody that's walked with the lord long enough boy you really began to appreciate that you really began to say my god thank you thank you for never leaving me even though i wanted you to there's been times i'm not the only one that's wanted to fly away and hide in a mountain and just disappear it sounds very appealing sometimes it sounds but you know what that's the nature of the of the bride is that really that wrong did your prophet have that desire sure he did did david have that desire that i could take the wings of a dove and fly away leave just disappear sure he did the stresses and pressures of this age i'll be honest with you honestly 10 years ago 11 years but 12 years ago i don't know times are flying when i came i honestly thought you know god brought me here i honestly thought no more problems no more issues no more battles to fight i can i'll rest but i'm finding what my rest really is my rest is not based upon the not having a lack of problems and tribulations and rejections and despisements my rest comes from the lord you'll never leave me you'll never forsake me you'll be with me even in me in the good times and in the bad times when i do good and when i do bad the tender mercies of my god towards me keep molding me and shaping me and making me into what he desired me to be he took a picture of me he took a picture of me in my perfect complete condition and he's gone to work seeing to it that that image comes into view tell me where's the pressure tell me if that don't bring you rest there's no more striving there's no more willing there's no more i got to get it figured out no the mystery of the seven seal was christ comes to you he said i know it's going over your head you're not catching it but something real supernatural is happening right now christ the lamb coming every morning breaking the seal saying i'm here i'm here i'm here the master has come and he's here and he calleth for thee oh brother could it be that simple do we make it overcomplicated sure we do that's human mindset brother bam said that we always over complicate it because we know how great he is we don't think that he being that great could make it this simple and the reality of is only the great can make it this simple that christ has come here me breaking the seals loosing the mystery that was in this life and now unfolding this great mystery of christ that was in me hidden from before the foundation of the world and he's doing it in you and it looks so simple so humble that you yourself begin to doubt it sometimes not possible very possible god humbling himself becoming little becoming simple in an everyday man and an everyday woman so simple don't you love him because of it gives us a hope gives us a rest so we no longer have to worry about getting everything under control because my problems my trials and my battles did not stop when i came to the truth they continue and it seems like we go from one battle to the next right we go from one battle to the next but i'm so glad i still got a general he hasn't abandoned me yet he keeps leading this little army through and i think he's with the little army of god the little simple humble army of god i think he's got a purpose in the battles he's breaking her down breaking her down making her simple making her more humble taking all the strength out of her so then she can finally just rest say rest i'm going to rest under the wings of my mighty god and i'll see i know he'll take me through you see so then the problems the trials all is well all as well but it's interesting and i was looking at this from the perspective of psalms 42 if you'll turn to it you turn to psalms 42. i had a couple you know and i appreciate also you know i lost my grandmother my grandmother passed away suddenly a couple months ago and then like three weeks after that my grandfather passed away and then then gary got covered so it's been a rough few months and in that period of time of it being rough you know i sat i was sitting in my chair in the office there and i was like wow life's rough right now it's a little bit rough right now and you get to feeling kind of down and it's so interesting you know when you go through life and you start to feel um i'm kind of a person i feel things so um i may not be able to intellectually put it together but i pick up on things and um and i i was in my mind i was thinking wow lord you know uh 12 years ago i took a stand for you and i was rejected i was rejected by my family i was rejected by my fam friends people didn't understand me and i was a real oddball for taking that stand and it wasn't a few years after that then the pastor of this church decides i'm going a different direction i don't believe it and you go through another rejection because i had lots of friends i had people i loved i really did love them it wasn't a put on and they all left and then they say things about you i says wow lord it's a constant rejection and then as time goes on especially when you begin to minister you say things and sometimes you say it by inspiration and sometimes you don't balance things out and sometimes people think you're attacking when you feel like you're helping kind of like i was trying to help the dog and then he bites me and i thought maybe i should let him alone you know and it just you just you constant you know you just you just feel you get down it's a real thing you get real down and it's not just for a minister anybody can you look at the life you look at situation look at your family you look at friends people you love the most and you think lord how's this going to work i don't i don't get it i don't know what to do here but what more can you do have you done all to stand you just keep standing you just keep standing on the promises of god i had a rock that i could stand upon a revelation he'll never leave me he'll never forsake me and i was sitting there and i was sitting there thinking this and i'll you know the devil has a way of pouncing on you real hard when you get in those weak tired moments and i began to realize my mind is hanging out and it's like what do you do it for why don't you just stop you know why don't you just stop life would be easier you quit just quit you keep trying to do things for the lord you do your best and my goodness even the ones you think love you hate you now you get constantly what do you do you want to quit am i the only one no we all have gotten to this point you want to quit not because you've given up on god but you begin to give up a little bit in your ability to understand the plan of god and your position in the plan of god it becomes so confusing to you sometimes you think maybe be better off i'll just step off to the side so god can really fulfill his will but he can't you're a part of that great mystery no matter what you think even in your weakness you're a part of the mystery you're really a part of it but i was sitting there and i had i had i thought of that scripture when has a heart pantheth after the water brook so does my soul thirst after thee and i i grab my bible and i says you know in my soul i'm longing for you god and i can't i can't find rest right now. and i grabbed my bible and i opened it up and you see that little words written right there i wrote down in january 28 2014 bad mental oppression god brought me to this scripture seven years ago never knew that was there just sitting there despondent tired weary wanting to give up in my mind fighting a battle and i open my bible seven years ago he calls me to write that now brother branham got real down one day he got real despondent he wanted to give up god had him take a drive and he saw seven peaks and it lifted him up out of that depression that rejected state that he was in that time where he wanted to leave and just go away now this ain't seven mountains but to me it means just as much seven years ago god must have known there'll come a time kyle's gonna turn to this scripture so i'm gonna put a little reminder of it in his bible when he gets to that i hadn't seen that for years brother honestly since i didn't even know it was there i just opened it so the same god that delivered me from the word by the word is the same god that's taking us through by the word he sustains us by the word he strengthens us by the word he delivers us by the word and you know what my duty is to say amen my duty is to say that ain't nothing but the truth lord i can't do it in myself you're gonna have to do it for me what are we going to do brother sister there's sickness if you've not noticed there's people dying some people want to think it's a fluke and sorry i know some people have died it's a real thing i think it's the beginning of pestilences i think it gets worse from here brother sister i don't think that it's just automatically everything's going to get smooth sailing in a couple years i have a feeling to think there's something inside me the pressure keeps building and i think it could be the tender hand of jehovah just driving me back to the promises that he laid in his word to say i put something in you that will allow you to overcome in the hour in which you're living it's called faith it's called my life in you to deliver you in any situation that you find yourself in whether it be sickness whether it be cancer i don't care what it is i've got something inside of you a little secret source of strength that you can come to this promise that i laid in my word and it was just for you may not be for the rest of the world may not be that i can understand it and put it all together but why is there something inside of me that says that's the truth that's the truth that's right god will keep his word i know he'll do it i know he'll see me through no matter what i see no matter how dark it gets i know you'll see me through he's done it before he'll do it again i remember even just the day that we we were on i we are north of fort wayne and i had you know before serving the lord before i i never knew that never knew what a message was i just had come in contact with some cds you know we're driving on 69 north of fort wayne and i stopped a cd that carrie and i were listening to brother branham and i said i believe we ought to live the way that man preaches now what did i understand of what he was preaching nothing daniel 70 weeks i mean come on i i had the cd but i liked it i couldn't tell you one thing he said i couldn't understand it but i was so drawn to it so drawn to it and i knew it was the truth and i tried to fight it and even in myself i said that that's the kind of life i can't live i mean i looked at it that's that's something you know i never heard of holiness and all these things i mean just just people you know living but what changed why did everything change not when i figured something out everything changed in me when i said that's the truth it was that moment right there and i had heard the cds i had heard brother branham four or five years prior to it and nothing happened but when i came and i humbled myself i humbled myself and said i believe we ought to live the way that man preaches from that time brother branham preaches that sermon from that time there's a decision time there's a point of turning time and it's not based upon our human intellects it's something way bigger and deeper than that it's something real calm settled simple a sieging of god just waiting for you to get out of the way so that you can humble yourself and say that ain't nothing but the truth and watch what happens from that time so these promises in the word of god are there but it's looking for an individual remember god had to believe his own word for everything to come into its manifested state so he separated himself he put part of himself in a bride now he's waiting for the other part of himself to say that ain't nothing but the truth now you have the two coming together and then it can bring forth the life that god desired the word goes into its manifested state so it's not him that willeth or him that runeth is it anybody that served the lord long enough you can say grace the grace of god brought me safe this far ah the grace of god will take me home i never did do anything right i've been a failure my whole life i'm just so glad god looked for some failures i'm so glad that he was looking and he said i need a couple failures they'll be so weak and broken and constantly rejected that they'll just say god you'll have to take me through that's the kind that he was looking for happy to be one of them sorry we're kind of deviating did we even read psalms 42 i'm sorry i'm all over the place psalms 42 we'll just um we'll just start at the top as a heart pantheth after the water book so panteth my soul after thee oh god my soul thirsteth for god or my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy god when i remember these things i pour out my soul in me for i had gone with the multitude i went with them to the house of god with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept the holy day why art thou cast down o my soul why art thou disquieted in me hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him for the help the help of his countenance oh my god my soul is cast within me therefore will i remember thee from the land of jordan and from the hermanites from the hill mazar deep calleth unto the deep as the noise of thy water spouts all thy waves and thy builders are gone over me yet the lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto god in my prayer unto the god of my life i will say unto god my rock why hast thou forgotten me why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy as with a sword in my bones mine enemies reproach me while they say daily unto me where is thy god why art thou cast down o my soul why art thou disquieted within me hope thou and god for i shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my god there's a beautiful thing that i think we can associate with here and david it's it it is look at david and the brokenness of david i find that i can identify with david here's a man that was anointed called of god chosen of god to be the king of israel who killed a lion killed a bear killed a goliath in the face of all the other armies do you think that builds your confidence if you brian brother brian if you killed a bear and a lion and an 11-foot giant well you're not a good example you're so tall blake i'm sorry i'm so sorry i didn't mean i don't mean to make jokes sorry it was right there i had to but let's be honest if we did that we killed a lion we kill a bear you kill a goliath in the face of all your brothers that were too afraid to do it does this build your confidence brother you're i don't care if you're two foot tall you're walking 12 foot tall at that time you got your chest out here you're feeling pretty good about yourself in this in this situation right and so david here's a he anointed called out killing lions and bears and goliath left and right i mean and he's crying all the time broken rejected weeping man after god's own heart david stand up be a man david stop your crying why are you so broken up all the time because god had to have a david that could get that low god had to have a man that could be be that great and become that little because he was a type of the lord jesus christ you had to have a shepherd king you had to have a a type of king that no matter what god however god blessed him he always remained a shepherd's heart like king he always had a feeling for his sheep always had a feeling for other people amongst men and warriors he said you'd be too hard for me you'd be two men of war you know but david always expressing the heart of dave you see he's always broken he's always worn out he's got a pillow full of tears it seems like all the time that was the man god chose that was the one he was looking for that was the one who he says that's a man after my own heart did david make mistakes big time big time but he owned them he didn't cover them he owned them he took responsibility for his mistakes he threw himself back into the hands of god and he kept going and god didn't forsake him go ahead and say ah you were doing really good david you were doing really good now i'm done with you no never did it god's love is elective it's not based on performance it's not based on human ability it's not based on intellectual conceptions it's not based on those things it's elective love towards you god so loved you so it was he who did it and we can find this with david that god it's so beautiful how god lifts him up god did it god anointed david god strengthened david god guided that stone god did these things in david's life right so he lifted him up and then he let him fall down so that he could lift him back up god let us do that he does let us do that because the reality of it is in order to know him you got to become like him why is the scripture say learn of me i'm meek and i'm lowly i'm gentle so he's so great like if i i said hey god's here you would be looking for him on the platform and god's so great he'd probably be finding the most obscure spot that he could hide in because god doesn't ever have to put himself forward as great because he knows he's great so great greatness can become very low very low because it doesn't change his greatness his greatness is not based upon what your perception is of him neither is your greatness in the eyes of god based upon the perception of others towards you so it's just so humble it's so simple it's so shockingly simple but yet god in his mercy allows us and that's what i think is happening i could be wrong but i think god is humbling this bride i think in the aspects of maturing the way up was now i believe in the little story brother branham tells about the man who went up to preach the gospel boy he was all prepared he had it ready to go he had every everything lined up so yeah i can't identify with that one but he had us he had his sermon all put together he was really going to wow the folks he went up there and it fell flat as a pancake he said it then he put his notes under his arm bowed his head and walked off the plate and he failed and the old man said now if he would have went up the same way he went down he would came down the same way he went up god had to let him fail god had to let him get broken god had to let him know of his weakness and his littleness and then he says now i can teach you now i can train you now i can take you up you ever notice how in revelations 1 when john sees him he drops like a dead man he goes low okay ever notice with job job desired to know god and god had to take him to an ashy before he could take him into his presence so where he could say in the last book of job i have heard of thee but now i see thee you ever noticed this you ever noticed that god has always taken look at joseph why did god take joseph from an anointed young man you're caught out you're anointed i have you're spiritual you're loved of the father i've anointed you joseph and he could see himself he knew he was going to the throne he was spiritual he saw it but then look at the pathway god takes this chosen vessel to the throne it is not the path that you and i would have desired nor chosen but it's exactly what was necessary because what if joseph just would have went to the throne after his brothers had dealt with him the way he they dealt with him i wonder if he would have extended the amount of mercy to his brothers who did what they did to him if he hadn't went through the character building process of potiphar's house in a prison i think it was the potipher's house the rejection the false accusations the prison condition the staying there lord why hast thou forsaken me why is this like this i think it was the years and years in prison and rejection that gave him the character to when he came to the throne he could act accordingly and when he was in the presence of those that falsely accused him he could extend mercy to them and not judgment i think god's training and it's now the maturing of the bride i believe when the last predestinated seed comes and lays in the presence of the sun to ripen let's not bypass the ripening stage we need the ripening the wheat needs to be able to bow its head if it gets harvested before all the greenness is out of it you know what happens it rots it can't survive it can't withstand it's got to be baked it's got to go through a time of sunshine so that it can become low become little become nothing so god ordains the prisons god ordains the asheeps god ordains these things for us it's serving god's purpose serving it in me i wonder if it's serving it in you believe it is god allows these things for a purpose so if you can mind here i just to drop back i i'm really all over the place so thyatira and i find it interesting just so you know i had i had a lot of these notes wrote down before brother chad went into what he went into on wednesday night and talking about these two queens if you notice once the humble meek doesn't make anything happen queen the other one's aggressive forceful and trying to make everything work out a certain way you're seeing two come on the scene again i think we're seeing two come on the scene again i believe when the the true church can recognize the two spirits that work within the framework of the true church one very humble simple long-suffering extends love in any condition the other one watch just watch it'll manifest certain attributes now in the thyatira brother bam says i want to give a warning right here it says concerning these last days that because iniquity does abound the love of many wacks cold this lady's seen age or last age is a self-love a love for material things that take the place of the true love of god we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit all right so we don't ever let's just see some of the results of it it is time to draw nigh to god and let him fill our lives with love and we may or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of god which alone is able to help us my we better we better stay close to the flame put it that way let's stay close to that fire let's stay in that presence we don't want to get too cold we don't want to get cold at all brother bam says third seal in this great hour now that we're living we see yearly it's getting darker and darker to the world and the coming of the lord gets brighter and brighter as he reveals himself in his word now listen and in his manifestation remember the purpose of god was to take this word and see it in a living epistle of you and me it's an expression it's a manifestation that's his desire not whether or not i can quote it right but whether or not i can humble myself to it to let it flow through me that seven seal christ coming to you can i allow that to be expressed in me can i die out to my will so that his will can be done i find it interesting this is just interesting i'm weird sometimes very much all the time i'll put it that way job now i've really taken a step back on this i've shared it with a couple brothers but why is it when job we know the six seals were in job we all seen those i preached on that a couple years ago god took job through the six seals and then god comes down and speaks to him in a whirlwind and he begins to speak to him and that's when job says i'm putting my hand over my mouth i know nothing and when he begins to do this he brings before him two creatures one of these creatures is behemoth the other one is leviathan and i've always thought this is a strange turn in events god you're coming down to talk to job and you're going to describe what when i was a kid he said two dinosaurs you know but then i began to realize god was bringing him into his presence god's bringing job right into his presence where in the last chapter in uh job 42 he can say i have heard of you with the hearing of the ear but now i see thee you know who he came in contact with you know what's right before um the presence of god behind where's the shekinah glory there's two curtains and there's two cherubs there's two guards that you've got to go through in order before you can go behind the veil and i just preached on that behind the veil that's the curtains the two curtains and the two cherubims and there's two cherubims that you must go through you're not going to go into the shekinah glory you're not going to go into the presence of god until you can pass through these two cherubs one of the one of these creatures that job comes in contact with is behemoth who is likened unto god the other one is this leviathan who can tame him he's fierce no man can tame him but read the last verse he's the father of all the children of pride so who are these two covering cherubs where was lucifer what is the predominant nature of lucifer an s self-exaltation and a pridefulness and a hatred of anybody or anything that would keep him from being up in a place of authority and high amongst the people but look at behemoth the hem of the bible the bible says he lieth under in the shady places he's huge he's powerful but he's docile timid he lays out amongst the other animals this great great being but i love something else it says but he drinketh up the jordan with one drink that's what it says about this behemoth i'm so thankful that he swallowed up death in life i'm so thankful that you know what jordan also represents his death to self i'm so thankful that christ could say in the garden not my will but thy will be done when he overcame himself then he could take back the keys of death hell in the grave he could overcome and take and redeem that book because he could overcome himself he conquered himself which gave him right it's a very interesting thought sorry i have a strange mind like that sometimes so i began to look at these two creatures and this two this cherubim this father of all the children of prime why does god take job before he can take him into the presence he takes him to a bit of a showdown takes him again to another showdown between these two creatures job which one would you like to be identified with job which one you know these the closer you get to god remember where was lucifer very close to god the closer you get to him the greater the oh boy the test becomes can i say that i don't know if i'm saying that right but the closer you get brother be careful you're getting more and more into a dangerous position because lucifer was so close that he himself exalted himself in the presence of god he put his will above god's will this was a dangerous position but by god's grace job overcame job was ushered in he could say i say nothing i shut my mouth i put my hand over my mouth god you're god you do what you want and so we find out there's this pressure building there's these obstacles that must be overcome okay i would just keep reading a little bit continue to lay this out god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself the same we are so smart and intellectual in our churches till we can build a million dollar building in a 10 million building and yet trying to build one better than the methodist or the baptist or build one better than the presbyterian the pentecostals they got into that rat race and by the thing of it is this we are yet we are so smart and we are so set in our ways until we fail to humble ourselves to realize that god that's in the little mission on the corner see that's right well that's we stumble in simplicity we've always done it now they were they were too smart to believe such a simple message it wasn't polished up enough from their scientific researches that they that they'd had it wasn't it wasn't brilliant the message wasn't enough for their educational program that they had in that day see they studied to know that there was a god and they studied to know that he was great and they tried to build themselves up great with him when the way up was always down beautiful ain't it the way up was always down so we know that god is doing something great but in order for us to actually see what he's doing we've got to become very little very very very very little i think paul said that i may know him in the fellowship of his sufferings right now god is moving his church and he showed all we've been keeping up the lamb up now for quite a while watching seeing what he is doing watching his nature and everything but now the token has got to be applied it's got to be applied it's the only thing except a man be born of spirit and water he will in no wise enter in what and should love one another believers should separate themselves from the world don't just take it now lightly now you people that's listening to this on tape you women you men you listen for me for a minute if you ever believe me you believe it now it's time to quit fussing with one another believe the message of the bible believe jesus christ and love and honor and respect one another men respect your wives you respect your homes bring your home together because remember this lamb was for the home not just one but for the whole home two had to be brought everything had to be brought in we should love one another and believers should separate themselves from the world very interesting very interesting what this seven sealant display does very interesting the type of love and long suffering and uh what charity does and it's an act in its action form done talking about it i think it's time to manifest it i think brother bam says it's not enough to agree with the message it's time to get into the message it's not enough to say yes that's the lamb yes the lamb took the book but you have to say i'm part of this land that's taking the book that's loosing the seals it's bringing this word into its manifested state that means i can love the unlovely i can not reject my dog when he bites me i can i can bear with this dog or i can bear with my brother i can bear with one who differs with me the one who does not agree he doesn't need to that won't change my love towards him because if god has changed his form did god just change his form the mystery of god be made known god changed his form he's in bright form but did the love of god ever change is it still an elective love it's an elective love you'll choose to love a brother or a sister who doesn't love you doesn't agree with you maybe even think all manner of evil against you but it doesn't matter you don't have to justify your actions you don't have to condemn that brother you have to love the brother you have to bear with that brother it doesn't matter anymore what does it matter we have nothing to prove we have nothing we're trying to be we're not trying to be anything we were nothing to begin with the only thing we're trying to be is like the lamb just want to be like that lamb so we quit our fussing jesus now let's look at this lamb it's considering jesus with his head back now walking the priests were screaming at him making fun of him others were crying hosanna but did you notice the whole burden of the world rested upon him calvary's dark hours in gesethme laid before him and oh as he went he never even noticed the scoffing you know when someone says something evil about you and you want to take it and get angry about it that shows that you haven't went quite deep enough yet with god big men don't do those things that's what made him god to me he was big he didn't have to notice their little scoffings sometimes we so associate maybe oh how do i say this sometimes we think we would put an equation or an equal sign to depth in the word to measure of holy ghost i don't think that's right i don't believe that's right i believe depth in christ produces a love that can prevail i believe deep anointed men of god can bear one with another's burdens i think we need to put what's high high and what's low low though i have faith that i can move mountains though i give my body to be burned though i give all my riches to the poor and though i have knowledge of all the mysteries and i have not love i'm nothing i'm a tinkling symbol what good am i to begin with paul says see it's to produce a love it was always to be able to produce the literal life of christ on display in a sin born people that bypassed their theophany wow wouldn't achieve that that's quite an achievement bypassing your own theophany born in a sin body with two-thirds of you a fight and devil and you know it a flesh and a spirit realm that just despises god and wants to do all manner of evil and yet the love of god so conquer you to where it can now then go and conquer everything that's unlike it by love not force not aggression not anything else very interesting that's what made him god to me you know what makes you god to me when you can express that same nature i don't recognize god in you because the depth you have i recognize god in you because i can see the same nature of the lamb that i saw there expressed there that's that's the difference he came to show what god was anything that's high and haughty isn't god god is low and humble that's what made him god see something that comes low not to them that goes high so god doesn't dwell in hierarchies and things or arch and hierarchies he dwells in humility the way up is down humble yourselves and you will be exalted exalt yourself and you will be humbled god loves us too much sometimes to allow us to exalt ourselves i'm so glad really glad as uh in god hiding himself in something as the old saints said up there oh i read this that fellow went up with all the education and things said he came down whipped out head hanging down walking down defeated he said if he'd have went up same way he came down he'd have came down the same way he went up see humble yourself just be humble don't be peculiar just love jesus say lord if there's any gal in my heart if there's anything wrong father i don't want to be like that you take it away i want to be i don't want to be like that sorry i just keep putting this before you like david said i put the word always before me that i will not sin against thee oh god and so i had already went through this in this journey because i believe we're on the same journey i believe we're on job's journey i believe we're on joseph's journey i believe we're walking into the presence behind the throne into the shekinah light i believe i'm going to sit on the throne with him ruling and reigning with him as kings and priests unto god i believe that it's the nature of the lamb on that throne both in male and in feminist expression and i believe that that's where we're at but in knowing where i'm going i'm also knowing the direction and the pathway by which he will get me in the condition to sit upon that throne humbled and broken god lives dwells works in humility never any other way it's pretty simple that right there is a mouthful god lives god dwells god works in humility never can he change from that nature if he's the same yesterday today and forever when will he become fierce and aggressive to get his job done never ever ever he will forever and always be the lamb she will forever and always be the lamb never never sorry this is repetitive but uh the way up is down always if you want power see how humble you can get just get away from your old worldly thinking and humble yourself before god and then you've got more power than the man that can run all over the building and makes a big lot of noise see because you've been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to christ you see to humble yourself before him that's real power you show me a church that's real real humble not arrogant a church just sweet humble church i'll show you a church that has favor and power of god in it that's right that's the thing it takes humility and humbling yourselves before god letting god do the work through us don't have to make a lot of noise don't have to make a big show don't have to do something for all of you to think great about me i just have to be able to be humble little live in humility work in humility dwell in humility there we go if you haven't wondered i really want our assembly to just be humble to be simple to be little and to be fine with that not only fine with that be oh so excited to be that you know i i'm part of you i'm not a pastor but i'm here i'm a servant to you right i'm called to serve i'm here to help you and i this word is to help me i'm not above you in any way i'm with you here i'm part of you in that regards and i so badly want to see this humility in me i so badly want to be simple humble broken lowly and god just knows how to get me there don't he he knows how to get us all there god has a hard time trying to get somebody that he can deal with that'll stay humble and meek and stay in that place until god calls him to do something you believe that a man that god can bless and he'll still keep himself a man not an angel or a god he wants to become some great person what i do see what me me me mine all that that's the wrong attitude god's hunting for someone who he could who he could bless and pour out his blessings and the more he blesses the littler the man will become oh that's a special that's a royal seat of abraham that's a special breed of people god keeps blessing you and you just keep getting littler littler don't care what anybody thinks about you you just keep getting smaller and smaller and not interested in anything accolades or anything just don't matter just make me little and you'll never get more of god until you become nothing you've got to belittle yourself and that that he will exalt him god will bring a base he that will exalt i'm sorry he that will exalt himself god will bring a base he that will humble himself god will exalt you've got to get little before you can get big and you'll never be big in your own self you'll only be as big as god will be big in you so i can remember back and i could think of that drive i went on and i said there's no way i believe what he says is true but there's no way i can live that life i knew it this wasn't like i know me i knew me i know there's no possible way i could be ext with the expression of what that man is preaching on those tapes but what do i do only thing i know to do is humble myself and say it's still the truth god help me i'll make the first step that's all i know to do sometimes that's all you have to do to be honest with you i think all the time i think god just gets you to take that first step and say humble yourself acknowledge me in your presence say i know you can't do it say i know i can't do it you know you can't do it but i know he can do it he's done it too many times in the past he's got living epistles here that have proven it to us our elders amongst us we look up to you we appreciate you we know it's the sustaining hand of god not you that has kept you where you are that's what we keep looking at it gives us a confidence it's a rock we can stand upon because the same god that brought brother tommy sister barb through is the same god's going to see me through same god brother tommy used to say you always kind of felt bad about not having an education little did you know it was the blessings of god wasn't it the blessings of god in your life made brother tommy have confidence in the word that god would have to see him through not his human intellectual ability to put the pieces of the puzzle together so he could be what god wanted him to be but an unwinding and a breaking of his own human ability so that god could be what god wanted to be in brother tommy that's interesting it's very interesting now just a couple more i'm sorry sorry getting a little long the queen of sheba and you know great big things is is what blinds the eyes of people eve was looking for a new light she got it the bible said in the last days that devils would be would turn themselves into ministers of light look at the very first sin that was ever performed was satan wanted a greater brighter kingdom a great thing and it went over to the north and it set up over his own kingdom up to outshine michael it's always been those bright things so when you get to looking around remember brother brown says now don't don't be shocked he's probably the one hiding in a little mission somewhere sometimes our own human nature looks for big things we look for big conventions we look for big ministries we look for big things big great hope now hold on is that the nature of the land no why is it it seems like when you hear stories like well this one's the he's the man of the hour for that country and this one's the man of the hour for this country we've got to have this man over the hour over this one oh and he's the best preacher in all if you're not hearing from this ministry and or if you're not in that church or if you're not listening to this church you're not going to make it you're wrong that's wrong that's the wrong spirit that does not line up with the spirit of god and with the message of this hour i promise you there's going to be a little obscure preacher in the back parts of malawi that you will never hear of that is preaching a resurrection message that his whole congregation or his people are going to take a body change and they're going to leave and you're going to have great big ministries with great big expressions of their knowledge and great big attributes of their depthness and there's not going to be any resurrection life there at all you're going to be shocked one of these days it's going to go right over the heads we're always looking for great big powerful this that and the other and he's going to hide it in such simplicity like he did in a manger 2000 years ago he has never changed his expression when he came he came lowly he came so low that no one noticed him but shepherds only shepherds that didn't have a problem with manure didn't have a problem with you know dirty places didn't have a problem with obscure simplicity they didn't have a problem with that and that's where the king of kings came and reside in it and if that was his first coming do you think he'll change in his second coming no he will not change it will be so humble it'll be so simple this rapture this rapture will be so simple so humble but satan if he can't push you one way he'll pull you another way if he can't get you to reject the word he'll try to make you make it more shiny and appealing than what god intended it to be he'll try to make you go out make it glossy make it real pretty make it real attractive but if you left the nature of the lamb in the process of doing it is it still the word no it's now a perversion to the word see what i'm saying well it's a razor's edge and you don't think the devil's slick my goodness he's been studying he's co-equal with god except for creation he's brilliant you better humble yourself in the presence of god and realize you are against a worthy foe i you know some people discount the devil say well you say right step all over but you have to realize you're actually speaking disrespect to god when you say that god made a worthy opponent if god is going to express his great strength he had to create a worthy opponent that was worthy respected as a opponent so i'm not giving devil any accolades here i'm just saying don't disregard the devil he's studying you day and night as soon as you start to think he's nothing i can kick i'm telling you he's got a trap and you're so far already into the trap you don't even realize it you disrespected god and you did not humble yourself you exalted yourself and i promise you god's got an a a basing just for you so i'm all over the place today okay what was i saying yeah look at the very thing yep yep satan yep trying to make a prettier kingdom okay so i wanted to continue with this with lucifer now um turn your bibles to ezekiel this okay ezekiel 28 you're all very very very familiar with this but i want to contrast it here soon with david son of man ezekiel 28 12. son of man take up of a lamentation unto the king of tyrus and say unto him thus saith the lord gods thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom perfect in beauty thou hast been in the garden er been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sardis the topaz the diamond the world the onyx the jasper the sapphire the emerald the carbuncle the gold the workmanship of thy tabriz and of thy pipes were prepared in thee from the day that thou was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have said thee so it fulfilled god's great purpose and plan to make him as great as he is thou ha thou was upon the holy mountain of god thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchant texts they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i would destroy thee o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will cast thee to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee have you ever been so happy that you're not perfect i am so happy i'm not perfect he was created perfect in all his ways we are far from perfection he got lifted up in his perfection we are being broken down in our lack thereof are constant you know you think about this sometimes your weakness was truly a blessing from god your inabilities your brokenness were those areas that make you weak actually that was the thing that god blessed you with many times that's the thing god blessed you with because then it puts you in a position you'll humble yourself and say lord you help me you help me continuing to look at isa lucifer isaiah you don't have turn then you read this isaiah 14 thy pomp you look up this pomp it's in the greek it's self-exalted or to lift oneself up not to be lifted up by another but to lift yourself up is brought down to the grave and the noise of thy vials and the worms is spread underneath thee and the worms cover thee thou art fallen from heaven a lucifer thou son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weakest the nations now listen to this for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend i will exalt my throne above the stars of god and i will sit also upon the mount of the congregations on the side of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds and i will be like the most high god okay a lot of i wills there it's very interesting so i looked for i wills in the life of david a lot of i wills and david too you know what david says i will praise the lord i will be glad and rejoice in thee i will sing praise unto thy name i will sing unto the lord because he hath dealt bountifully with me i the lord is my rock my fortress my deliverer my god my strength in whom i will trust my buckler my horn of salvation and my high tower this is where you can say amen i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies amen i will declare thy name unto my brethren i in the midst of the congregation i will praise thee amen yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil why because thou art with me thy rod thy staff they comfort me a psalm and a song of dedication the house of david i will extol thee oh lord for thou hast lifted me up and what time i am afraid i will trust in thee in god i will praise his word in god i have put my trust i will not fear what flesh can do unto me i listed about 15 there's actually 150 of them if you'd like to go look for yourself so you see there is a will in both expressions both are placed before you both exalts god and a basis himself or one not the other one definitely does but one exalts god at the same time abasing himself where the other one abases god to exalt himself you see the two cherubs you see where god's calling us behind the veil you see the great obstacle that's before us now so we've we're in a we're in a dangerous time it's a very dangerous time and that's why i think the prophet god said don't take this lightly don't take this lightly um i just had this if there be musicians you can come if there be in here or out on the wires of this message and across this nation in your little churches and groups and halls and wherever you're seated if there is one oh let me persuade you let me beg you as a minister of the gospel let me beg you in the name of jesus christ flee the wrath of this wicked age don't serve the god of this evil age oh i know you say it's good it's fine exactly a mixed tree you can't mix knowledge with god's word it's a word that is to be believed by faith not knowledge you don't understand it do you understand everything no but do you accept it amen it ain't nothing but the truth amen you say it's right and then you live by it that's all he asks you to do he didn't ask you to figure it out he didn't ask you to try to reproduce it he just asked you to believe it he said if you'll just believe it and accept it you watch what i do for you you humble yourself and let me exalt you but don't exalt yourself because you will be based you will certainly be a beast oh well musicians make yourself comfortable for a moment i forgot one portion turning your bibles to matthew i thought i was done i had one more little section here you all right sorry brother ben you got to stand for a moment brother matthew 14. kind of a odd little thought but matthew 14 you all know the story quite quite well but it's interesting jesus here with his disciples he begins to constrain them get them into a boat let's read it and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go with him to and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away it looks to me like they didn't want to go i mean why would jesus have to constrain them it looks like they didn't want to make this trip they didn't want to do this and jesus said no get in the boat get in the boat and they didn't want to go we just didn't want to go it's just interesting stop thinking about it for a second and when he had sent the multitudes away and he went up into the mountains parked apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the seas tossed with the waves for the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying is it a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is it is i be not afraid and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me to come unto thee on the water and he said come and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him o thou of little faith wherefore did style doubt so god was testing his little people he was training brother branham said a group of men he never took his eyes off of them and he knew exactly what he was doing and he constrained them to get into a ship knowing full well quite a storm's coming but when that storm came it just created the opportunity for that which god knew was in them to be expressed god many times constrains you to go out in a little boat with a little revelation with just a little rock that you're standing on just a little thing god told you to go so you obey you stand upon that and then everything in life begins to come at you men come against you remember the waters bible says in revelations waters represent multitudes of nations tongues and peoples and so here's everything coming against peter and it's so distracted him he turned his eyes away from jesus and began to sing but the reality of it was god was training some people god knew what he was doing god's training some people he knows what he's doing god's allowing storms to arise but he knows what's in her he knows how to get what's in her out and he knows it'll be because of not what she can do but it'll because of what he spoke to her as a promise of god that you can do it and you'll you'll walk according to that revelation and you'll go higher than every wave every criticism every ridicule every despondentness everything that would so break you down and try to overcome you you'll rise right above it not because of your strength but because you've fixed your eyes on upon a promise you've humbled yourself you said lord that's your word i just believe it i just believe it and so it says in luke and there shall be signs in the heavens and the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity are we living in a perplexed time has anybody looked at the situation said ah you know you can't you can't go to the store right now and be sure you're going to get what you're looking for this has never happened to americans it's sad but come on i mean it is a sad problem that we have but reality has stead into us you don't know if you travel you're going to come home i mean this is a perplexing time this was this is a time like we've never seen we i'm you you i don't look at the news hardly anymore it's too discouraging but you look at the news there isn't a day goes by where it just makes you want to vomit to see men killing their families kids killing their parents there's a school shooting in america almost every week i mean it's hell on earth this is hell on earth hell is spilling over brother branham said you have people driving people over this has become a common everyday thing for us in america it is sad but it is the reality hell is present but if hell is present heaven's present that means that the rock of my salvation is here that means that he promised he'll be walking with me through the valley of the shadow of death i'll be with you so i'm going to take you right on through i'm going to let the winds i'm going to let the waves i'm going to let the storm i'm i'ma let the winds turn contrary against you but don't you worry i've been training you for a long time and this time you're not only going to walk on water you're going to walk from one dimension to another dimension this was a promise that he gave and i'm still standing on that promise i don't know i don't know how he's going to do it i'm not trying to figure out the mechanics i believe the dynamics brother last night we're talking about brother enoch and trying to figure and i says i look at enoch all the time there's things i don't understand but i know this i may not know the mechanics of how enoch took that body change but with all that's in me i believe the same dynamics that was there present with enoch to walk out of this world is the same dynamics that's here in the presence of his people because he promised i'll be there with you and if that condition was a hell on earth in enoch's day which it was satan's eden in full effect and he was able to leave one dimension to another i believe with all my heart the same dynamics is present with us not to just heal our bodies but to change the molecules from which we are in to take that other dimension very very soon to the world that sounds insane but why is it i believe i'm standing amongst the people that say that ain't nothing but the truth we ain't a scientific people we have no clue the mechanics of how this is going to happen anybody who says they do they know nothing that they ought to know the bible says any man that thinketh he knoweth anything knoweth nothing that he ought to know this one's going to be god this one's going to be so humble and simple the faith of god expressed in his people you're not going to figure it out you don't have to figure it out i was never commissioned with the that i had to figure out the seven seal he said you live a simple humble christian life when god wants you to know it he'll reveal it to you it's just my duty to say amen that ain't nothing but the truth i believe the rapturing grace is on those tapes so i'm going to stay in those tapes and i'm going to believe the same dynamics that resurrected jesus christ from the grave 2000 years ago is the same resurrection spirit that's here now that's resurrecting me from what i once was to what he's ordained me to be that picture he took a picture of from two i don't know millenniums ago i'm coming to that picture not of my will but his will we can't do it you've got to admit we personally can't do this you must humble yourself at this point and say i can't i can't do it and then he'll say thank you you've been learning of me you're becoming meek and lowly you're now coming where i'm at now that you've come where i'm at take my hand we're going to go for a walk could it be that simple will you stand we know in this last age we're coming to a capstone the simplicity of this capstone is divine love on display an elective love on display manifesting again as it always has i'll close with this scripture you don't know it so well though i speak with tongue of men and angels and have not charity and become a sounding brass and though i have gift of prophecy i understand all mysteries and all knowledge though i have all faith that i could remove mountains have not charity i'm nothing though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned have not charity i profiteth nothing charity is what suffers long aren't you glad god suffered long for you now if god suffered long for you and it was the becoming god god became man so that you could become him will god express as a suffering god in you sure that's what the seventh seal is all about god becoming man it is kind only to those who speak kind about you though even when they bite your hand no it's kind charity envieth not doesn't esteem one above another doesn't say well you know why do you think the bible says don't compare yourself one to another don't you ever ever ever do that don't say well because he's this and i need to be this and if he's this then i need to be this and if he's that i need don't you ever ever do that that is not god he made you distinctly you because you're distinctly an expression of god that only you can express only you can do it right so don't ever compare yourself one to another you do air when you do that bible says that charity vaunteth not of itself doesn't have to say look at me it is not puffed up doth not be behaveth itself unseemly and seeketh not her own it always prefers another one before itself it seeketh not her own and it's not easily provoked and it thinketh no evil no matter how bad they bite rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in truth it beareth all things they believeth all things they hope with all things and they endureth all things charity never faileth but where there's prophecies they'll fail whether there'll be tongues they'll cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away amen i wouldn't read it or preach it if i didn't think it was possible i believe it's possible i believe this is the hour of the greatest expression of god since it was 2 000 years ago expressed in its fullness i believe you're going to see the fullness of christ expressed again but watch in its expression it's going to be very simple very humble very lowly just like you found him in a manger in a stable 2 000 years ago it would be the same way bow your heads for a word of prayer please heavenly father lord we come before you lord we're just so thankful for your grace that you've extended to us father we we know that it's all been your mercy and grace to us our whole life lord we i was looking back on my own life i thought you know i didn't choose to be born in lime ohio i never chose my parents i never had an understanding that there would be a people there would be a message i never knew any of these things lord i was born incapable of knowing these but through your elective love towards me father god you've been guiding me you gave me the right parents you gave me you put me in the right home in the right city in the right space of mine i was at the right job i had the right grandparents lord you had a purpose in all of it as from a child how could i deny such a thing each and every one of us can say the same thing lord we we had certain parents we had certain upbringing we had certain experiences certain life situations lord that many times they make us very humble they make us a very broken people but lord all the while you were just molding us to be shepherds just humble shepherds you were just getting us into a position where we would be the right kind of a people to appreciate the lamb when he came lord a simple humble message found by a simple humble people that went forth in a simple humble way and expressed it in a to a people that didn't want it lord you've done it before and you're doing it again and i'm just privileged and honored to be a part of that that little group of shepherds father caring for the lamb holding you up before the people father i pray that you would have mercy upon us we don't ask for judge justice in our lives we appeal to your mercy many of us have made so many mistakes i certainly have lord you never gave up on david and i don't believe you're giving up on us as a people lord god you're just molding us and shaping us into your image father so lord wherever we are in life whatever mindset we are in may we rest upon the promises of god may we lift you up with our praises may we lift you up in our minds may we constantly exhort like david exhorted you i will praise thy name i will extol thee i will declare thy goodness amongst the nations it never came to a point where he lifted himself up in this point he constantly pushed himself down and lifted you up may we be that kind of a people here on earth i may not know everything but by your grace father may we express the love of god in our hearts to the world that we're living in this dark dark world may you be pleased in this great expression lord we commit our pastor we commit brother ben brother emmanuel so many of the brothers traveling lord they're a part of us lord we're with them wherever they are a little piece of us is there lord i pray you'd watch over and keep them safe lord give them supernatural strength give them brother chad and brother ben's supernatural anointings brother immanuel supernatural anointing of your life of your love and of your expression to whomever they come in contact in whatever situation they find themselves in father help our brothers and lord help all of our brothers help our local brothers our our brothers in different churches and different assemblies different ministers lord we need you it's a dark hour lord we ask your blessings your mercy your power to pee upon all of your little lambs lord wherever they are maybe in malawi wherever they are lord anoint us we need you father humble us lord so that you can lift us up in due time we love you we commit ourselves now to you in the name of jesus christ amen amen brother ben you got a song when i come into his presence i humble myself i lift up both my hands and i began to worship him [Music] when i come into his presence i humble myself i lift up both my hands and i begin to work [Music] for what he's done for me breathing me free and because just because [Music] myself remembering what he's done the victories [Music] oh i'll praise him when i come into his presence i humble myself remembering what he's done the victories [Music] oh praise him for what he's done [Music] [Music] just [Music] all because he's god all because he's god he redeemed me he chose me elected me all because of what he is not because of what i am my it gives you just a rest and a peace and a hope now you know what kind of rock we're standing on we're standing upon that revelation he chose me he called me he delivered me the victories that were won was because he was there as the victorious one living working and overcoming in me that's where every victory has been won wasn't my ability it was when he could have the preeminence there was the great showdown and there was the great overcoming may god richly bless you be with you and anoint you the rest of the day and we'll be praying for brother ben lifting him up in prayer this wednesday amen god bless you brother what other song you got in mind [Music] strip me up vainglory please [Music] precious lord [Music] make me [Music] precious lord [Music] please [Music] precious lord [Music] to think of this great one this great one that he had to look down upon heaven this great one became a foot lost flunky oh my this song so encapsulates this condescension that it's beyond our mental ability to recognize but it so puts him in his rightful place as the king that he really is because only a great man could do this [Music] [Music] my god [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] my bread my sunshine [Music] we my savior [Music] bring us red [Music] god [Music] [Music] [Applause] he laid aside [Music] my love [Music] by the great creature [Music] is [Music] is [Music] we [Music] sacrifices [Music] my [Music] [Music] [Music] so i am [Music] [Music] is [Music] one time just your voice is there [Music] [Applause] my [Music] [Applause] he came by [Music] if i could just uh if you don't mind just bound your heads for a word of um i don't know how to do this exactly but i don't know what keeps holding me here but i don't know if you maybe are here and you haven't recognized this great condensation that he did for you or i really don't even know what i'm doing here i don't know if i'm just supposed to give someone the opportunity to humble themselves and say i don't know what to do and i cannot overcome but i need you to overcome for me lord if that's the case if you might just lift up your hands and you just from your heart really like you did with peter one day walking upon the water you began to sink and you didn't know what to do but to put your hand up and ask the lord help me if that's your place i don't know why but i just feel you should lift up your hands acknowledge your god acknowledge him as god and acknowledge your littleness and your inability to do this thing that god has called you to do all he wants you to do is to recognize his greatness all he ever desired was to have a people that would say they love him from their heart would live and move and act from their heart in everything that they did not something that they could put on but they could just say lord help me i can't do it i don't know what to do next that's me for sure and i certainly have my hand up because i know i can't the life is getting so difficult we might each and as individuals want to give up what's the point of it all but then i want to ask you a question what's happening right now what is this that's inside what's this moving what is here that's keeping me here asking you this and i've never ever done this and i don't know why but all i know is i'm supposed to stop for a moment and just let you take a declaration may this be like from that time lord i put my hand up and i said that time that moment where i recognized you were here in my midst and in my presence i'm just putting up my hands and i need your help i need you to take me i'm coming low i found you you're very low you're very simple you're very humble and i've i'm humbling myself to get where you're at and now lord i've got my hand reached out for you will you please take it back and i know he is and i know he's doing that heavenly father lord you know the so many hands that came up lord it's your grace to us as a people lord we so many times you're just looking for humility you're not looking for great strength you've had that vashti put forth the wrong image you're looking for a esther a woman of character lord i believe with all my heart there's a purpose of the men and the women both young and old that have put their hand out i believe it was your grace the bible says no man cometh unto god that god cometh to man we are recognizing it's not us coming to him it's him coming to us this great condescension was when almighty god descended out of the heavens of heavens not willing to let us be destroyed coming down and rescuing us thank you lord what more can we say but thank you lord show yourself strong i know you will on all those that lord are reaching out like peter reached out help us lord take us by the hand we love you father we commit them into your hands in jesus name amen god bless you oh [Music] lovely [Music] my [Applause] [Music] one more time [Music] lovely [Music] my [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh sing it out one more time oh yes [Music] he [Music] [Applause]

alive [Music] i am [Music] hold me and make me this is what i [Music] my pray [Music] [Music] for you are the power [Music] i am [Music] [Applause] is [Music] true change my heart [Music] may i be like [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you
