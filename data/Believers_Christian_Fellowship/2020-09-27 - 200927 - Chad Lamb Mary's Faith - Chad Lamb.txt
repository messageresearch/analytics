TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is [Music] praise god man god bless you this morning and while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to the book of luke chapter one i just want to remind you that brother ben siebel and his family are away this week and he's praise preaching down in arkansas for brother david morris to just remember him in prayer for this morning and then further traveling back either i think monday night or tuesday so don't forget them and let's look here and we'll just read a couple verses and then we'll pray luke chapter 1 verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god into a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed out there among women women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god let's bow our heads to pray lord jesus we thank you father for this wonderful opportunity lord that you've given us to be here this morning and lord may we not waste this time that we have but may we glean from it all that you have for us lord we come now to the to the time lord where you can speak to us through the preaching of your word and that's what we've come for lord to worship you with the believers lord and also to hear you lord speak to us directly speak to our needs speak to our questions lord god i pray that you would just give us the word of life that we so desperately hunger for now you might use that word to shape us and mold us into your very nature and character and you might give us what we need for this journey that we're on we pray you take preeminence and take every part of the service into your control in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all have your seats i'm going to preach on if we'd like to take for a text mary's faith and talk about mary's faith and these are things that we've been discussing here for several weeks we're not going off in a different direction we're staying in that same vein because this is what the lord's laid on my heart and many times i've made apologies in the past for going back and covering a subject again or preaching something that we've touched on before but i'm not going to do that anymore i promised myself i wouldn't do that because god is always showing us something out of his word we read the same message books we listen to the same tapes amen we read the same bible over and over again and god's constantly unfolding and there's a purpose and there's a reason why god laid this on my heart so hard so so let's look at this together as we talk about mary's faith now when we we get here in luke chapter one we find that mary brother bam tells us she's you know between 15 and 16 17 years old somewhere a very very young woman and she's preparing for marriage she's a spouse to a man named joseph and she's got all her plans and all her thinking and she's mapping out her future i mean just normal life what a normal uh young woman would be thinking as she's preparing for the day she's going to be married thinking about children on a home and being a wife and all these other things but there's going to come a messenger from god that's going to interrupt her plans because god has other plans for her amen and we know whenever we read the scripture amen the scripture is not for over here and over there and for yesterday or tomorrow but the scriptures for now to give us something for now so i want to i want to read this again let's start back here at verse 28 and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that are highly favored the lord is with thee blessed are thou among women now just if we could put ourselves in mary's place if that would happen to us today oh my what an experience amen what an experience to have an angel from the lord come and tell you that you're highly favored thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art among women we would be amazed upon amazed astonished on top of astonished amen totally taken back but this wasn't the end of his message it was just the beginning and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man. and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god. and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her so we know that we've been through this everybody knows this story everybody who has any association with christianity but we realize that this is an amazing event in this woman's life amen we read it as a bible story as something we've heard before but this is an outstanding happening in her life amen and when this angel comes and speaks to her he's telling her thou art highly favored thou art chosen the lord is with thee amen and you're going to be the one the vessel that god uses to fulfill his prophecy out of isaiah a virgin shall conceive and you realize that when when mary you know she asked the question how how will that work since i don't know a man amen he gives her an answer that doesn't satisfy intellect because she's asking a legitimate question how shall i have a child if i don't know a man and he's saying the holy ghost shall overshadow you amen there's going to be a power that come upon you and you're going to conceive in your womb amen and she doesn't when she asks the question she doesn't get a reason she doesn't get anything reasoning or anything reasonable that comes back she doesn't actually get an explanation of how it will work but she gets an answer from the messenger and the answer from the angel satisfies something inside of her and she says that's the truth be it unto me according to your word amen showing to have the kind of faith mary has you don't have to have evidence and proof and scientific fact amen all you have to have is the word amen this is what's going to happen this is going to be the work of the holy ghost and she's able to say all right that doesn't explain amen conception the way i understand conception that doesn't explain amen but it explains satisfy something in my heart if you say it it's truth and i receive it as truth in the name of jesus christ she didn't say that part i say that part because you realize for us there are some outstanding things that have been said about you some there's been an angel messenger that is coming this day and he's speaking to the bride amen and this is not the time for group thinking this is the time for individual god speaking to me this messenger was sent to me that voice on that tape is to me because if we don't take it that way we're going to miss the point of this age that we're in that missed the point of this move of god this is not a church move this is an individual move this is not i mean the message came to all the bride but it came to call out this one here and this one here and that one here not a whole group and so now if you take it that way amen this angel from the lord has said some outstanding things about you and my question is what's our response to those statements i mean there's nothing wrong with wondering how how is that how could that be how could that be but sometimes when you listen to the message the answer you get back amen doesn't go through genealogy no technical no reasoning it just says it's the holy ghost calling you out amen if you've heard the if you've heard his voice amen you heard the eagle screen you're an eagle you say amen what did that explain it didn't explain a whole lot but something inside of you had the capacity to say that's the truth let's keep reading here in verse 39 and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the baby leaped in her womb leapt in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and when says this to me that the mother of my lord shall come to me and lo as soon as the voice of the salutation sounded in my ears the babe leapt in my womb for joy and blessed is she this is verse 45 i want you to focus on and blessed is she that believed blessed is she that believed for there shall be perform there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord now god brother ben tells us it's very clear through the scripture god tells us in his plan that god works with man and god has never forced anything but he's given his word and given his people an opportunity to respond to the word and that's response to the word often indicates what seeds on the inside and so now he comes to mary gabriel comes to mary sent from the presence of the lord and begins to tell her who she is what scriptures she's going to fulfill and how that god is going to use the power of the holy ghost to bring this to pass in her life and and now she now that the angel has come god has i get you could say this way god has given her a true message and now waiting for her response and her response was be it unto me according to thy word she believed what the angel told her she didn't have to go talk to her pastor she didn't have to go see a priest she didn't have to get a counsel together she didn't have to go back to mom and dad but she as an individual when she heard the messenger speak to her and identify her and place her in the word and tell her she's the fulfillment of that scripture she as an individual with no outside help had something in her that could say that's the truth be it unto me that's for me and now when she comes to elizabeth elizabeth is filled with the holy ghost begins to speak and prophesy out amen and she has to prophesy out because her husband's smitten dumb because he can no longer speak because he was in the ministry amen and gabriel came to him first amen with a message for him that he's going to receive a child and he doubted it he questioned it and he didn't just question it but he questioned it and doubted it mary questioned it but not doubt and when elizabeth filled the holy ghost is speaking because the ministry now is dumb because they doubted so now the woman's speaking because she's the final voice to the final age all the denominational ministry all the theologians all the schools of theology they're smitten dumb and can no longer speak to the bride amen because they doubted the angel messenger and what part did they doubt they doubted listen close they doubted the message of the forerunner they doubted the coming of the forerunner and when they doubted the coming of the forerunner they were smitten dumb amen but elizabeth who had received the forerunner ministry amen was filled with the holy ghost and could recognize now moving from the messenger to his message she could catch it by the power of the holy ghost and now she now is declaring and blessed blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which are told her from the lord see the way it's written i mean it's very unique and the fact is she had to accept it she had to believe it amen and she believed it and there shall be a performance of those things amen because god requires faith he requires that we believe his word and when we believe his word he goes to act upon his word god was always there with the power to perform his word but he's got to have somebody that will believe it let's go back and look at chapter 1 verse 11. let's go back to zacharias 11. and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when zechariah saw him he was troubled and fearful upon him but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard this is this is such a sad part of the story zacharias has been praying for a child and he says thy prayer is heard and my wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make already a people prepare prepared for the lord and zechariah said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife well stricken in years and the angel answered and said unto him i am gabriel that stand in the presence of god and am sent to speak unto thee to show thee these glad tidings and behold thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season zacharias doubted although he was praying for a son what was told him was so amazing now he begins to question and his question is based on reasoning his questions is based on reasoning i'm old my wife is old as if anything is too hard for god but but he was smitten dumb because he didn't believe brother branham says in the in the message the ministry of christ back in 1953 now this little virgin was all excited notice here's what i like about mary instead of doubting like zacharias that preacher she said behold the handsman of the lord be it unto me according to your word she didn't try to figure it all out like he did you know so many people uh they tried to intellectualize the message and i i i want to say make a statement but i make it in no disregard and i don't make it with any ill will whatsoever but you can't apply apologetics technique to the message [Music] because god did not want to make the message so simple that anybody could comprehend it with the human mind and acknowledge it why because he had to like he did all through the scriptures he had to make it by faith so the promise could be sure to the seed so that the only way that you could get a hold of the word of god is to believe it by faith not necessary to understand it by reasoning or by a human mind so although everything we believe is based on the scriptures and we have we have that's the only foundation amen for our faith is the word of god brother branham told us that we believe it but god didn't put it in such a nice neat little package that everybody with the ability to read could read and come up with the same conclusion but he he he so did it in such an odd and unique way that he made it impossible you can't take the message and read it from beginning to end amen and have a clear understanding of what brother branham is saying i mean i don't mean that to disregard brother branham in any way it's the it's the way god wanted to hide it and reveal it in simplicity he he hid it in a man amen that would would give fragments of sentences partial scripture and grab one scripture and read part of it and read another part of a scripture without giving you the reference to that scripture so that you didn't even know he was citing a scripture he put these two thoughts together and spit it out as a package and he will say this is today and it wasn't so neatly done you could say oh he was quoting out of zechariah and that other part was out as isaiah you look at it and it's literally the first time you hear it it says if he made that up himself because god is not looking to tantalize your intellect or your reasoning amen he didn't do it to zechariah he never answered zechariah's question because zechariah's question came from unbelief showing that mary's question didn't come from unbelief she had a question not all questions are unbelief some questions are just questions like i'll tell you this you're going to get a body change this body your atoms are going to change into a glorified condition you can say i wonder how that this body will change that's a good question or you can say how is there going to be abide adam's change i don't get that you understand one's a question like mary asked one's a question like zacharias asked so he's god is looking god is looking for faith he said when the son of man comes will he find faith we've come to you know we've come to a place in society where we've got so much information but god was not going to allow this to be information amen it was going to be by revelation in the age of information it's going to be by revelation so god is hidden and revealed in simplicity it goes back to the same quarter she didn't try to figure it all out like he did why he said now look my my wife sold so forth like this we have plenty of examples look at hagar and the temple look at sarah many of the old women had had had children by god's blessings upon them and he had plenty of examples but she had to he had to believe something she had to believe something that had never happened by the way i'm saying she had a legitimate question zacharias had all kinds of bible examples of god healing bodies opening wombs giving children where there was barrenness amen and zechariah was absolutely disregarding the word he should have known better and then brother and says well here's what i like about mary i want you to grab a hold of this because we're talking about mary's faith here's what i like about mary before she felt life before any physical outward demonstration before there was one thing ceased in her body before she felt life or anything she started out testifying that she was going to have a baby hallelujah god give us some more mary's that'll take god at his word god had said so through his angel didn't make any difference what everything else took place she was going to have a baby because she took god at his word see we want mary's faith amen not zacharias's questioning we want mary's faith that says if that angel said it to me amen what what was the angel speaking he was speaking prophecy he was speaking scripture he was speaking the time amen for the prophecy to be fulfilled and he was pointing at mary and saying you're that amen you're the fulfillment of the prophecy it's the time the time is now it's going to be in you and she had something in her that could respond and say that's nothing but the truth and run and begin to testify to elizabeth immediately before she felt one change in her body to verify that what he said was correct she didn't need another verification her faith was the verification see too many times we're looking for evidences we're trying to prove something we're trying to get somebody on our side we're trying to get all the details lined up instead of just coming god's provided way that he put something inside of you amen there is a crystal that can pick up on his word amen not everybody has that but if you have that amen the word will come to you and before you understand it you'll believe it amen before you can explain it you'll believe it you'll receive it by faith amen because the angel messenger said it amen and it won't be till later that god will back it up with the vindication your body will begin to change amen all the things that come with being impregnated will begin to manifest themselves amen but she didn't wait for that she was so confident that she knew whether the angel told her was true she went to testify of it immediately that's the seed friends that's the seed and elizabeth could say blessed is she that believes for it shall be performed everything that was told now the the this is i'm just laying a foundation i'm painting a picture because there's something remarkable that we want to get to uh here in just a little bit but listen now let's read let's read this quote together i've read this before recently out of the invisible union of the bride of christ and let's take our time it's a long quote but let's take our time now notice the anointed word of this day of which you are apart now there was an anointed word for mary's day and that anointed word was a virgin shall conceive brother bram said isaiah spoke it and that word went around and around the earth waiting to lodge in the womb of a woman and so that word won't fail that word won't fall to the ground and then that void is just keep circling waiting waiting until the right time the right season when the angel messenger will come from the lord when tell a certain virgin girl that she's the one and she as you see there has to be a reciprocal part when the word comes in the manifestation amen god he so worked his program that there's got to be two reciprocal parts amen the angel could not come and he could not stand amen on top of mount uh uh mount moriah he could not stand in the temple and declare real loudly amen that that that that now it's time for the fulfillment of of isaiah's prophecy a virgin shall conceive amen and it's going to happen and i'm going to force my way into it and i'm picking you up and i'm making it happen here he can't do that because the the word has to come to the word he can't just any meanie mighty moan i'm gonna grab you and i'm gonna force this word to come through your life he cannot do that he has never done that nowhere in the scripture has he ever done that amen but he's got to wait for the right season and there's a recipient for that word amen and when those two things come together two omnipotents meet the word comes to the word mary was born she was predestinated she was ordained amen to be the virgin that would bring forth the flesh body of god jesus christ on earth the son of god and it was her allotted to her ordained before the foundation of the world for her it wasn't for anybody else but for her amen but nothing was going to move until she became the reciprocal part of that word she had to receive it by faith so there's a spoken word but when the spoken word goes it goes and goes and goes looking for a lodging place and there's got to be a predestinated lodging place and that word is moving now there's been a prophet messenger in our day spoke the word of god and that word is moving amen and that word has a predestinated lodging place in the elect predestinated seed of god and that word is moving looking for somebody who will say be it unto me that's the truth i believe i am what you say mary wasn't just saying you're a good messenger you are gabriel amen you are and it's time for that that's not what she was saying friends it wasn't saying you're malachi 4. this is luke 17 30. you're the elijah that's not what she was agreeing to friends amen zacharias wasn't doubting gabriel he wasn't doubting that he was an angel come from the presence of the lord he was doubting his part in the mystery so when mary said amen be it unto me according to my words she wasn't saying i agree you're gabriel i agree you're the messenger and i agree the word you say is true she was saying i agree i am the fulfillment of isaiah's prophecy it was a big statement you see friends it wasn't just something that said oh yeah that sounds good amen amen that's the truth amen that's good but she was absolutely actually accepting the fact that when god spoke a word that was in his mind before the foundation of the world that she was the recipient of that word amen this is not agreeing with the message agreeing with the messenger agreeing that brother bran look at those miracles look at those signs obviously he's elijah he did everything he was supposed to be that's the son of man ministry amen that's not the faith that god's looking for in this day he's looking for the faith that mary had that would say you call me bride you say i'm sinless you say that god's gonna bring forth the manifestation of jesus christ through me i'm saying that's the truth and i receive it in the name of jesus it's a much bigger statement than just recognizing that what the messenger says is true there's a lot of people that will believe that there is a prophet do the signs do the works but there come forth a message that has to be received by faith the brotherhood says now notice the anointed word of this day of his day of which you are apart by predestination mary was already a part of that word she just didn't know it yet never been told to her she didn't know she wasn't told when she was a baby you know you're the virgin that's going to bring forth messiah she she wasn't thinking she probably wasn't praying and saying god would you make me the the the tabernacle for the messiah would you make me the virgin she didn't know it she was stuck in spiritual amnesia took a messenger from heaven to break her spiritual amnesia to who she really was she didn't have any concept of who she was until the angel came and spoke to her and when the angel spoke to her something in her was able to recognize what he said was true and to put herself in the scriptures that's the harder part friends i'll tell you right now the harder part is to be able to accept the the portion for you you can accept brother branham's portion you can accept there's a bride you can take generically everything he said about the bride in the end time and say that is the truth that the bride will be like that she'll have those characteristics she will be chosen predestination she's wonderful but when you bring it down to you personally people begin to trip them and like wow you know i i don't know i'm hoping i uh that's not the faith he's looking for that's not the right kind of faith well i just hope that i can make it i'm just trying really hard to be a believer mary wasn't trying to be a believer she believed see if we're trying to believe a believer if we're trying i'll just make this statement if we're trying to be a believer amen we are dealing with the intellectual realms and if you succeed in being that kind of believer you failed [Music] i'm trying to believe if you ever succeed in that trying to believe you have failed because you believed here he's not looking for that kind of belief he's looking for somebody who'll take it like mary will take it with no good explanation do you remember you recognize her question her question was a scientific she had a scientific question her scientific question was how shall i have a baby i haven't known a man well that's a good scientific question and we should give her a good answer so gabriel does well the holy ghost will overshadow you and the thing informed in you will be of the most high oh i get it amen do you understand it wasn't appealing to her into like it had nothing to do with reasoning it wasn't apologetics from the angel and he didn't have to go and prove it to her ten different ways all he had to do was speak the word what god's plan was for the day and she caught it amen by inspiration and said be it unto me according to that she didn't need time to think about it she didn't need research she didn't need amen she had something that would believe now i'm into the first sentence on this quote and it's a long one he says if we notice the anointed word of this day which you which you are apart by predestination you immediately knew when you heard that you knew right quick that you was an eagle you also realized that you wasn't a denominational chicken to begin with you know there's something wrong there there's something wrong that's right for you know that you were trapped into it at the beginning he the bridegroom took away your shame and put in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the bible said your first husband that you were married that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which foreordained you has washed you by the washing of the water by the church no that don't sound right does it no you might find that in the almanac but not in god's bible by the washing of the water by the word in the word see you are completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning now now don't make that brother branham's statement don't make that a quote brother chad's reading but i'm telling you there's an angel in the pulpit this morning speaking this to an individual virgin girl do you understand nothing is changing the scriptures we're in the same spot and i'm wondering is there a virgin girl out there you may not know your virgin amen because you've been part of all of this and all of this but down in your soul there's a seed that's never had a counterpart to germinate it it's never been germinated yet never been touched by anything because it can only be touched by the word and now you may not know you may not know that you're the fulfillment of isaiah you may not know that that you're the one amen but there's an angel in the pulpit this morning telling you reading a quote amen from a prophet messenger of the age that's saying you will stand complete completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning i'm telling you if you ask me to explain that i'm not going to explain that i can't explain that amen you have to receive it by faith i can't give you the chemistry or the mechanics amen to explain that but it's nothing but the truth so this is my message to the church now as we go off there just in a minute you are standing now listen to the qualification if you're standing on god's word and with god's word every amen every jot every tittle i want to explain something brother branham and this becomes clear later as we read other messages he's not talking about performance you stand with the word on the word and with the word every jot every tittle he's not saying that you never make a mistake he's not talking about your performance he's not talking about your acts he's talking about your faith that you believe all the word not the portion for luther not the portion of the wesley not the pentecostal portion but all the word because all the word has been restored if you're standing on god's word and with god's word every amen every jot every tittle where are you standing i'm trying to tell you pull away from the shucks and get out here in the wheat where you can get right before the sun i hear the coming of the conbine you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place hallelujah talk about a thanksgiving i feel real good i'm more thankful for that than anything i know of you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god now zechariah will say but you know you don't know what i've done in the past i've got all this baggage and i've heard i the reason i feel so strong about this is i've heard good people believers people that i love amen when you start talking about amen being pure virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ amen they immediately go to pass deeds but i did this and i did that and i still sometimes trip up in this and i still see like we said before you're climbing a ladder a greased ladder you're never going to get to the top of that ladder you're never remember mary heard the words amen of a prophet i mean the words of an angel messenger from god and when she heard those words she accepted it before she felt one change before she felt any different about it she accepted it because she recognized that what he said was true and she was part of the program you stand complete justified you are the pure virtuous sinless mary magdalene was delivered from how many devils seven devils what a waste of time for that woman to go around the rest of her life talking about having seven devils what a waste of a delivered life what a waste of the freedom that jesus christ gave her if all she can talk about is oh i got so many regrets i wish i wouldn't have had seven devils and blah blah blah blah blah and brother remember saying you were trapped into it you didn't mean to do it no fault of your own you come hybrid you come with spiritual amnesia you were trapped into that kind of life but now he's come with the word to free you from that kind of life amen now mary magdalene took her freedom and her freedom she wasn't bound down wringing her hands twiddling her thumb saying oh if you could just accept me after seven devils he already accepted her and delivered her from the seven devils he's already accepted you and delivered you from the seven denominational devils of the seven church ages [Music] not so we can say oh i hope i hope and maybe and if i'm good if you you realize if you don't catch this revelation you will never ever never make it because you will never overcome your own flesh you have to accept by faith and then let the word do the work that it's intended to do in your life the word will wash the word it's the washing of the water by the word you have to receive the word and let the word do the cleansing it's not your self-reformation that's going to do anything it's not deciding i'm no longer going to sin i'm no longer going to be a lazy christian i'm going to read my bible every day i'm going to listen to the message i'm going to church every day and somehow by that i will earn an entrance into this place where i can say amen that's me amen it was mary magdalene she was the chosen of god she was the one he came to it was the woman at the well he must needs go by samaria because there was a predestinated seed there that he was coming after when she was in her sin when she was actively wrong she he didn't tell her he didn't come to the well and say oh there's great treasures for you there's a position for you amen i've got wonderful things for you to do now if you go back and clean up your life and you straighten some things up then you're going to be part of my plan he told her she was part of the plan and the revelation that she was part of the plan amen unlocked in her a life that was already there see we we brother said we fail we fail to understand that we don't we don't convert people to christianity by governments not rules and regulations not not getting good enough to make it you really you'll never ever ever ever ever make it and with that mentality you'll never have the freedom because your willpower your choices your mental conceptions will never put us in the program of god it was the predestination that put us in the program of god and because we're in his program and he's got ordained works for us to do he's already had to make all the arrangements to make it possible for you to do what you're supposed to do and because he already made the arrangements all he needs for us to do listen mary didn't have to go get pregnant through no effort of her own the word did the work why she was predestinated before the foundation of the world to be the reciprocating part of that prophecy every mechanism was already in place all the power that was needed was there all she needed to do was recognize who she was and confess and admit it and immediately the program went to work in her life and she had enough confidence in what she heard to testify of it and confess it before she had one changed feeling god's looking for that kind of faith can you say i am that bride i've heard his voice i know it's me amen i've lived a horrible life i've done all kinds of wrong things i still don't live the way i want to live amen but that has nothing to do with it i'll never make it mary magdalene couldn't make it until he delivered her from the seven devils this woman at the well couldn't get free she was trapped into a condition and didn't understand it it took the coming of the seventh seal to unlock the mystery in her life and explain to her how she got into this condition and then she could run and say this is the messiah see it's so important to receive the words from a prophet by faith because it unlocks in us the potential that's in the seed and that potential was placed there to ensure that whatever god ordained for you to do you will do and it's there amen to be quickened to life amen but if we cannot get rid of intellectual concepts and willpower and trying to work it out and trying by self-reformation amen we're never going to get to the full potential that's in the seed because it's the water of the word and the light of the sun of this day that unlocks that potential and brings the seed into full manifestation so we've got to quit with human efforts getting to a place where well when i see this and when i see that i can testify when this happens and when that happens i'll have the confidence and maybe if i can see this change or if i can see that change no you don't have to see one change amen all you have to do is believe the word and the word will bring the change he says go back to our same quote you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and washed in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect the blood of jesus christ how can you if a man if i was supposed to die in the morning a man took my place i cannot die for that sin somebody took my place and jesus the word took my place he became me at a center that i might become him the word let me hold true to it not the church the word oh that spiritual union of christ in his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested vindicated just what the bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day why it's accumulating so fast out there in these deserts and things taking place that i couldn't even keep up with it we're near the coming of jesus to be united with his church where the word becomes the word call of the holy spirit searching the hearts you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place oh i tell you friends if you've come to that revelation and then you come to that place and say that's the truth he took my place amen this is this is what happened in hybridization amen but i've existed before hybridization i pray i was there before hybridization i was in the mind of god he had a plan for me he had a desire unto me before i fell into this condition and god's intention is to take me back to that place but i can't get there amen by trying to work through hybrid flash i must be released from all the consequences of being in hybrid flesh and if i'm released from all the consequences of coming the wrong way then i can be unlocked into the full potential that was there in his mind before the foundation of the world praise god it's like asking somebody to play basketball with 50 pound sandbags strapped all around them and i want you when you can beat this guy then you got it when you can score on him you got it and you're so handicapped you can't do it that's what it's like trying to be the bride without revelation you're so handicapped you'll never make it you're in this life so handicapped that there's no way you're ever going to attain to the place where you can finally feel comfortable saying i'm bright [Music] no you have to be comfortable in faith saying i'm bride before anything moves before you even learn how to dribble you got to say i won the game because that's what faith tells us amen he says you're standing completely you never sin at the first place god don't even know it's this in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of god you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of god you're the virtuous bride of christ washed in the blood of christ precious virtuous sinless son of god standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he washed by the water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of god called love whatever you are you are servants of god whatever god wants you to do where your place is god placed in the church some apostles prophets teachers pastors he placed that by virtue of his own predestination and you were that to begin with your first wedding was annulled it was you never done it in the first place your first wedding he's talking about your natural birth when you come married to the world that wedding is annulled it never happened amen you've never done it in the first place because there's only one thing could do it and that would be god come down himself and took your place in the form of the son of god jesus christ and washed you by the water of the washing of the water by the word the word not the denomination the word washed you but if you won't stand in the water of the word how you going to be washed you're still as spotted as eve was what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in god which is the word pure unadulterated now i want you to see where brother branham goes he's talking about you're sinless and never did in the first place see if god forgiven was pure unadulterated and it's almost like he injects a sentence and then he jumps right back to saying you're pure sin the spotless and that sentence he injects is the key to the whole understanding he said what is sin unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in god which is the word and you go right back to your sinless spotless this is the same man who after he had a born-again experience was a prophet of god preaching the gospel amen healing the sick would have his wife lied to a lawyer right have his wife lie to a lawyer and have to go make it right with a lawyer and have to go make it right with the man he's going to pray for his baby make it right with his wife and come and confess it to the church and brother branham brother venom didn't call it a mistake he called it a sin see but he never sinned he had a sinful act but he never sinned it was a sinful action friend you have sinful actions brother branham says amen a sinner has sin which is unbelief saints have sins which is sinful acts and conduct he said that's why the blood's for he said the blood keeps you clean from that he said you're not saved by the blood you're saved by faith you're justified by faith but the blood keeps you clean because you're still in hybrid flesh and you need something that's going to keep you clean even though you'll never ever ever be a sinner again brother branham had committed a sin a sinful act by telling his wife to lie to the lawyer he called it sin but he was not a sinner he was still a saint committing a wrong act amen because he did not disbelieve the word so brother branham is shedding some light in this statement what is sin sin is unbelief he's jumping right back in here and he's moving it away from the conversation of conduct he's taking it away from the conversation of conduct and bringing it right back to faith in the word of god because faith in the word of god will unlock the word of god which will bring the holy ghost amen the spirit of god which will transform your conduct your conduct will change your conduct will be corrected and even when you fall even when you fail amen the holy ghost is there to bring you to a quick conviction to bring you back to the word you'll never fail from disbelieving god's word you'll fail from not keeping his word so now this bride amen now brother branham is making a statement that hasn't been made luther didn't make a statement like this wesley didn't make a statement the pentecostal sure didn't make a statement like this but he's looking at you and saying if you're standing with the word if you're standing on the word and with the word every jot every tittle you realize amen no no other church age could do this they didn't have every jot they didn't have every tittle there was no prophet to open the seals the book was still a mystery the mystery of god was still wrapped up in a mystery but at the end he comes and ties together all the loose ends peels back to mystery and shows the whole plan of god so that now you can receive and believe every jot every tittle why every jot every tittle every word is jesus christ the seventh seal that's been unveiled in this day and i believe it all it's all him there was no other age that he could make this statement like this every other age was stuck in a portion of disbelief luther he would receive justification by faith in the word alone but he would still bring a persecution or uh encourage a persecution against the jews he would still have an unholy lifestyle you still swear and smoke and drink and all those other things wesley he could come to a sanctified lifestyle but he could never break free from some catholic tradition even the pentecostals could come and show the gifts of the spirit amen and move up higher but he could never break free from that trinitarian dogma but now we've come to a place at the opening of the word that the bride can finally break free from unbelief and believe the whole word of god like mary did mary believed the whole word of god now she goes up to elizabeth say elizabeth guess what i'm going to i'm going to conceive and i'm going to bring forth and elizabeth says how are you going to do it what kind of answers mary going to give how's that going to work tell me what happened i mean how i mean she can only say one thing the holy ghost will overshadow me she can't say anything else she doesn't know anything else all she knows is what that messenger said it was good enough for her amen she doesn't have to change it now and manipulate it around amen so that she can get elizabeth to believe it if it was good enough for mary it's got to be good enough for elizabeth too she's not trying to cut it and repackage it and piece it together and make it sound intellectual in a way that you know all the denominational believers do if they just sit and listen i mean if they just sit and listen they'll get it because i've got it in a nice package god don't want it in a nice package he don't want it in your tight little package with a clear explanation he said it the way he wanted it how is this going to be the holy ghost shall overshadow me oh that does something to me somebody else looks at him like i don't get it still like you didn't explain anything how's it going to be how do you know for sure oh i just know mary you're not making any sense mary you're not being reasonable let's reason this out let's talk about this now mary how okay you're going to bring forth a child okay knowing not a man how's it going to work what's the mechanism being used do you have to go to the drugstore and buy something do you have to take a pill how many to explain this to me i don't know he just said the holy ghost will overshadow you oh that's it and her friend's just like what's it don't you get it it's the holy ghost gonna do the work i don't get it how's that work it's the holy ghost god's going to do it see it's not to appeal to the mind it's to trigger a response from the recipient of the word and the recipient of the word has the missing piece and when they come together it clicks and they say that's it i believe it i see it i got it now person sitting next to them is still scratching their head praise god let's keep let's finish this quote sin what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in god which is the word pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word the word became blood the word why he was the word made flesh and the word bled for you amen that's why when you accept the word you get the blood because he was the fullness of the godhead he was the lord made flesh and when the word made flesh that word was crucified in that word bled and that bleeding word atoned for your sins and now you cannot go back to that cross and gripe some blood off and cover yourself with the blood the only thing you can do is accept the word the same thing that bled for you and when you get a hold of the word for your day you're covered in the blood it's so simple friends people want to claim that i'm covered in the blood of jesus christ how explain that to me how did you get the blood on you what blood chemical blood the chemistry of the blood's not available today so how are you under the blood of jesus christ well by faith by faith and want by faith that there's a blood out there how do you get it how do you get a hold of it how because he was the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god the word was made in flesh and dwelt among us the word was crucified the word bled for me and that's the purchase price of rhyme redemption that's my atonement so how am i i can't go back 2 000 years and stand there and say i accept you lord jesus all i can do is accept jesus christ today and jesus christ today is the full measure of his word that's been unlocked and when i get a hold of that word amen i get the full benefit of that word and that life and the blood has a tone for me so simple you just have to believe him how do you how do you find jesus christ believe him in whatever form he comes in receive him don't reject him believe him he is the word and i'll say today he's the word made flesh today don't reject him receiving pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready the word bled for you and you're washed in the bleeding word the word bleeding the life of god in the word and the word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of those prostitutes and be clean cleaned and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stayed on god and on his word see colossians 3 3 says for you are dead and your life is hid with christ and god you are dead and your life is in the bible says reckon yourself therefore dead unto sin and alive in christ jesus it says ii corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new so by the transforming power of god through a new birth the old man is dead all things are become new how can now that which is dead hinder me from what god's called me to do now that i'm alive we have to reckon it dead reckon ourselves dead to those things prophet god said in christ is the mystery of god revealed you think i'm beside myself i'm not we've got the devil's answer not me that liveth but christ the word living in me i want to tell you something mary had the devil's answer what was the answer it's god mary didn't ask to be the virgin mary didn't choose to be the virgin mary didn't say uh i'd like to be that scripture right there oh god can i be that he chose it was his choosing she didn't even call for the timing it was his timing his choosing his placing it was his calling it was he sent the angel she didn't say oh god would you please send an angel to give me an answer amen god it was all him not her all him not her that's the devil's answer it's christ it's him it's him and me he's called me i didn't call him he called me you think i might sign myself i'm not we've got the devil's answer not me that liveth but christ the word living in me it's not my idea it's his power not my idea it's his word he promised it here it is he said it would be here and here it is we got his answer christ is risen has paid the price for our redemption while god in christ manifested he gave that flesh that and blood that in the blood might come the life and the flesh be redeemed that god in his redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as he did in that day he says woo glory then we stand justified in the presence of god as a drop of ink dropping into a tub full of bleach you will never find the stain of ink no more it went somewhere it'll never come back again and when man is truly redeemed that predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished catch it the predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it it doesn't matter how many times brother branham says you're the sinless spotless virtuous if you're standing on the word and with the word every jot every title what am i trying to tell you you are justified just as ever you did it you're the sinless spotless that is for whoever can see it and accept it you can't say it doesn't do i'm telling you people amen to stuff and they don't even know what they're amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen but never take it personally and say that's me that's me that's me that's me they're just saying that's the truth that's the truth that's the truth but if you can't take that and accept it it will do you no good you can bob your head you can amen you can shout out but if you're not able to take it by faith and accept it all the amenities in the world will produce nothing you must see it and you're acknowledging you see it with an amen but you also must accept it with a be it unto me [Music] amen the predestination you see that season accepts it his sins are demolished it's gone it's separated it's dropped into the ink of the blood of jesus christ and it's never to be remembered god forgets it and he stands as a son and daughter of god in the presence of god amen amen now we are the sons of god not we will be we are now we are redeemed listen now not future now let's look at philippians chapter 3 together we'll lay in a couple scriptures several here and then we're going to move to the part that i really want to get to philippians 3 9. philippians 3 verse 9 and being found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him and that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings be being made conformable unto his death so he says now i'm being found in them not having my own righteousness it has nothing to do with my conduct my righteousness which is of the law which is my deeds my doing but that which is through the faith of christ not faith in christ faith of christ you are saved by grace through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of god it is the faith of christ the gift the righteousness which is of god by faith not your own righteousness it's a righteousness that is of god by faith it's a righteousness that's declared because you believe him let's turn over to romans 5. i just want to we we talked about this last time but i want to lay this so solidly in the scripture so you don't think that it's just somebody saying something uh romans chapter 5 verse 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ justified by faith not justified by conduct justified by faith amen and you realize that you have to believe the word you have to believe all the word and if you're going to be justified by faith faith and want faith in jesus christ faith in god faith in the word so if i'm going to be that's if that's my justification is be just be be real attentive if i'm going to be justified by faith and that is my justification what happens if i believe this part of jesus christ and i disregard this part of jesus christ now my justification is not on my good conduct but my justification is based off faith what i believe and abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he didn't say it to him only that it was imputed but for our sakes also that if we believe it will be imputed unto us for righteousness so we are justified by faith so if i believe god believe and and they ask jesus how can we do the works of uh how can we do the works of god he said believe on him whom god has sent it's always believing in present tense god god is always coming and doing something and you have to believe it noah's day moses day abraham's day david day i mean it's always all through the bible is god doing something and the people either believe it or reject it that's the whole bible we've come here to the end of time and god did something through a malachi 4 prophet ministry and you either receive it or reject it but it's god it's the word amen and now we say we're justified by faith i'm justified by faith because i believe jesus christ came and died on the cross but i do not believe he came in this ministry in the end time i do not believe in the son of man then where is your justification there is no justification there justification is by faith faith in the word and there's been a word there's a word that's presented today there's a word that's alive today god if it's going to work it's going to work we can't muddle it up and confuse it and say well if you just take one portion of the word and hold to that it doesn't matter if you blast from the holy ghost and call this other per this this other thing wrong false prophet false doctrine as long as you hold to this you're going to be justified your sins are washed away if that was the case all the pharisees scribes sadducees are saved because they were holding to parts of the word and giving their very lives for parts of the word but they could not receive the part of the word that was alive in their day and when they refused that part of the word that was alive in their day they were considered seed of the devil so the whole denominational ideas all you have to do is believe what jesus did 2000 years ago it is dead dung because if you have if you believe that you'll believe this it's the same jesus christ it's the same word it's the same it's the same word you can't just say like the pharisees did we believe in moses he said if you believed moses you would believe me if you believed jesus christ died on the cross you believe he came back for his bride to be united with her you know when i i'm i'm not saying the word is dead i'm not saying jesus christ didn't die i'm not saying that part of the word is dead or that person's no good but it's death if you hold to that and refuse this and call it something evil but we believe jesus died for us we believe that we're saved by faith in calvary but we're justified by what by believing by faith by believing in jesus christ the word so i regret saying i shouldn't have said that's dead done forgive me for that lord forgive me because that's the word there's nothing wrong with that when they say we believe most there's nothing wrong with that jesus christ died on calvary you must believe it you must believe it nothing in believing that is wrong so i shouldn't have ever said that that was wrong but i can't stay there and refuse jesus christ here and expect that that will be enough because it's the same word it's not a different word it's the same word the same word is alive today and i've got to get a hold of that word today if i can get a hold of that word today then everything in the word is alive to me and every part of the word is alive to me and every part of it is effectual in my life thank god for stopping me he checked me back on that statement praise god god is good friends he loves us he wants us to say things right amen and the rapture message brother ben says notice not only is the bride washed forgiven but she is justified did you ever try that word justify to see what it means now for instance if brother greene heard that i had been drinking i had been doing bad things and found out that i didn't do it then he come and said i forgive you brother branham you forgive me i never done it what you forgive me about see but if i'm guilty then i can be forgiven but i'm still not justified because i did it but the word justified is though you never done it at all justified and then the blood of jesus christ cleanses us so from sin until it's put in the book of god's forgiveness he's the only one can do it we can't we can't forgive we can forgive but not forget i could forgive you but i'll always remember you've done these evil things then you're not just you're forgiven but in the sight of god the bride is justified she never done it in the first place what first place the place i was before i got here [Music] i was trapped into this but in the sight of god the bride is justified she never done it in the first place amen standing there married to the virtuous son of god never sinned in the first place why she was four ordained she was trapped into this and now when she heard the truth and came forth the blood cleansed her do you hear that when she heard the truth and came forth the blood cleansed her and she stands there virtuous she no sin on her at all now i want to ask you when you when you say amen to that are you saying amen to the fact that the bride has no sin on her at all by the blood of jesus christ i can say amen to that that is nothing but the truth now the next question is is there any sin on you personally as the individual can you say that's true for me why because i've always done everything right and i always say everything right and i always get it right hey listen friends i just got it wrong a few minutes ago and the holy ghost checked me on it but that didn't change me i wasn't a sinner it didn't change my position amen your failures your faults your wrong attitudes your wrong speech it's not changing who you are you're a son and daughter of god amen you've accepted the word for your day you've been washed from all the sin and filthiness of the world and you stand virtuous sinless righteous the very righteousness of god is upon you personally not in the group because the whole group can say amen and only one in the group may actually have this kind of righteousness amen but it's being able to see it and accept it as truth mary could see it and accept it in james chapter 2 says and the scripture was fulfilled which said abraham believed god and it was imputed in him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god galatians 2 16 says knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified we are listen we're justified by faith by faith of jesus christ we might be justified by the faith of christ christ is the anointed word no flesh can be justified because no flesh can make it but you can be justified you the real you the real you the inside man can be justified by faith in the message jehovah jireh from 61 says no man come to me except my father draws him all the father has given me will come to me what you scared about were you afraid we said well maybe i'm just not the right kind of a christian how can you come to god without god calling you first and all that he foreknew he was called is that right all that he called he is justified is that right all that he justified he hath already past tense glorified amen it's a finished work from the foundation of the world christians don't you see you're living under your privileges you don't know who you are this whole struggling amen struggling with past sins struggling with things that come down from mom and dad struggling with this and somehow questioning whether or not i'm a believer or whether or not it can be the bride because of this we've got to move past that and accept what he has done for us because what he has done for us will break us free from all of that brother brahm tells a story in the message doors and doors he talks about this man who in the civil war had run from his post of duty he was being arrested amen for for for leaving his company he was going to be shot and then a friend ran to abraham lincoln and got a pardon sign for him and he got it signed by the very president of the united states of america that this man was pardoned and he goes and he takes it to the man in jail and he says look i've got a pardon from you we all know the story brother brown tells it several places but i'm taking it from doors and doors and he says now he says that man says your party says quit mocking me you're just trying to make me feel better i'm going to die in the morning amen and he refuses his pardon and the next day they take him out and shoot him and it becomes a big court case and brother bam says now the ruling is this a pardon is a pardon only if it's received as a pardon see there's a reason god's done what he's done in this day so that he can release us from the bondage of hybridization they could release us from the bondage of failure and sin and all the things that had us bound he came to free us from all of that but you can only be free if you accept it if we can't accept the freedom that's been offered to us then we're always going to be going through the laundry list of conduct and deeds and actions and measuring sticks and plan programs and plans and whether or not i'm a bride or not based on how i did today and one day i feel like yeah i could be a believer i could be and the next day i feel like there's no way i could be see we got to move past that intellectual faith and say what did god call me who called me what do i believe and why do i believe brother said in the message spiritual amnesia said you that wants the holy spirit that wants to experience not an emotional excitement you want the holy ghost the life the germ of life inside you you want to get rid of that amnesia that makes you can't identify yourself you don't know where you stand you don't know what you are let's get rid of it right now there is a new birth here for you a real genuine new birth to lose the old man to be born again to be a new creature in christ will you still be stuck in hybridization absolutely but there's going to be somebody on the control tower that's grabbing this flesh and pointing back and saying buddy we're coming back here you're not getting away with that we're not going that direction anymore you're still being flesh but something will change on the inside that'll take control the man says the only saying i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are you're not going to be but now you are the sons of god you always were the sons of god see and when god had in you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before there well when he before he even become material here on earth before there was anything but god you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be he knowed the color of your hair would have he knowed all about you see before before jacob and esau did right or wrong one was loved and one was not and they weren't loved based off their character and conduct they weren't they weren't loved based off that they were loved based off predestination and election god's love for you is not based off how good you get it how nice you are god's love for you is based off his election his grace is his love extended to you and because he loves you he says i love you i died for you i died in your place and if you can accept me in the in the way that i come to you i will release you from all of that you have to say be it unto me according to your word brother bam says in the last recorded message he preaches communion 1965 he said now then one day as i was walked on that voice talked don't never smoke drink so forth and young fellows and all got older see there was something moving but yet all at once i looked up and i said i'm not the son of charles and ella branham there's something calling me like my little eagle i'm not a chicken there's something up here under somewhere oh great jehovah whoever you are open up i want to come home there's something in me calling there was a born again that little life was laying there that life of water was poured upon it then it began to grow now the old life was forgiven put in the sea of god's forgiveness to never be remembered again against me no more see now we stand justified as though he never has sinned in the presence of god i want to say this way whatever i was when i was born i'm not that anymore well you were chad lamb your birth certificate you're the son of this and the son of this mother and this father no i'm not that man is dead that life is gone those deeds are in the sea of forgiveness that unbelief has been separated from me and now what are you now i'm i'm the living son of god i'm a son you're a daughter we are children of the almighty god that seed was laying there the predestined eternal seed what god had in his mind before of me and through the new birth it was unlocked and it came to life and what i was i am not anymore i'm still in the same tabernacle same vocal cord same characteristics and features of my body but that man is dead and there's a newness of life and all that was attached to that life is gone and dead in the sea of god's forgetfulness and i've accepted my pardon and now i'm not that anymore what i am is something different be it unto me according to your word see god had to restore what was lost and to restore what was lost he had to bring back adam again do we understand adam and eve amen god had worked he had produced he had got everything the way he wanted he got adam and he out of adam he brought the woman put him in the garden of eden that fell and now god's been working to bring back that masterpiece to restore it back to that place and he first did it by getting the last adam jesus christ he got the man in place but now he's got to restore unto him his wife and he's been forming his wife back and bringing her back through seven church ages but he's got to bring her back and restore her back to what she was there and when he restores her back to why she was there she's got to go back to what she was before she disbelieved the word amen everything that fell fell because she disbelieved the word and so now there's been a constant cycle of disbelieving the word because the word hasn't come back in full measure but god was seeing fit to bring the word back in such a way that the bride could come back not in disbelief in the word but now in faith in the full word of god to restore back to an eaten condition already why did god bring his word to take us back to eden she fell by disbelief her conduct came after she disbelieved the adultery happened the fornication the adultery happened after she disbelieved her sin was disbelieving the word and her conduct followed her sin now we're going back he's got to restore eve now he's already restored the last atom now he's got to restore the last eve so now he's got to bring the eve back to a condition where she's no longer in a fallen condition i hope you understand what i'm saying i'm not talking about your flesh friends i'm talking about the real you on the inside he's got to bring the woman back to where she's no longer in a fallen condition she's restored back and if she can come back to full word in the word full full faith in the word of god let's look at it this way adam and eve no sin life that's what god's bringing back eve disbelieved the word there was a fall and then her conduct followed her unbelief are we clear on that and that cycle continued on but then god's been bringing it back and he first brings back the first man who will live all the word now he's got the by his spoken word by an angel messenger he's got to bring out the virgin and bring her back to a sinless condition by what justification by faith and if she can come back to what she was before she disbelieved the word by accepting all the word then her actions will follow do you understand she committed adultery because she disbelieved the word if we believe the word god's bringing us back to justification so that these bodies can start to follow and we start to live the word but if we don't recognize we've been washed away we'll never live the word will never be good enough we must first say i see it i see it he paid the price he paid it all there's nothing for me to pay all i have to do is receive it by faith and god's going to look down at you and say you're the sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ and you can say amen amen how's it going to happen the word's going to come the holy ghost is going to come and unlock that seed that's inside of you amen and bring you back to the real realization of who you really are break your spiritual amnesia and show you that you were with him before now what's it going to do i don't know the mechanics i don't understand all i can say is it's the truth it's the truth it's the truth i'm not the son of this man and this woman i'm the son of god before i come to this earth i was the son of god god has a plan for me he's revealed it to me and now by me accepting that he's washed away everything that was against me so that i can be what he's called me to be no more armenianism no more climbing the ladder no more trying to get it right but he got it right for me and he's called me to a higher place so that he can work through me and i just want to say it's the truth you are the sinless virtuous sinless spotless bride of jesus christ don't say amen because i said it don't say amen because i read it from the message say amen because you know it's the truth i'm not looking in the mirror i'm not looking at my conduct but i'm looking at the word and the word says i'm justified by faith the whole words come back and i believe it all [Music] and that faith in that word has put me back in that eden-like condition waiting for my body to follow where i'm already at as we go off the air you know what message i'm quoting from as we go off the air i'd like to just say this if you're standing with god's word on god's word and with god's word every jot every tittle every line then there's nothing against you there's not a mark against you you're the sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ no fear no worries no chance of not making it no chance of not being good enough no fear of not measuring up no hoping that i'll be there someday but if you're there you've accepted this word you've caught it and he's called you he's awakened that seed on the inside you were with him before the foundation world there's nothing to keep you from going back there you've already come back to that condition he saw you in before that faith will continue to grow until the outside will catch up with the inside because it went the opposite way and eden the inside disbelieved the outside caught up now the inside believes and moves back to that condition and the outside is going to catch up let's all stand i want to have the faith of mary before i feel one thing musicians if you come before i feel one thing before before i i feel one sense of oh i feel good i feel like i'm the bride i feel like i got the world licked i feel like i can live the word before i feel one thing i want to say it's the truth god has washed away all of my sins my hybrid condition is answered for and i'm free completely free from all of that life and when god looks at me he looks at a restored bride that is restored to his son the bride and groom back together again in an eden-like condition and i say that's nothing but the truth what gave mary magdalene the ability to live the life he first freed her from her old life gave the woman at the well the ability to run in and face all of those men and begin to preach the gospel to them first he took care of her old life what's going to give this bride the ability to be all that he said she's going to be because he has proven he's taking care of the old life to unlock the potential that's in the sea let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father god i don't think we can fully grasp all that you're trying to tell us i know lord that i can't i can't explain it lord i can't get it out the way it should come but god if we could only see how free we really are if we could only see how perfect you see us if we could only through a moment lord see ourselves the way you see us then all the struggles would be over lord all the fear would vanish away all the little manipulations of the enemy it would just dissolve god that's what you're trying to get us to see in this hour who we really are god let your word strip away our amnesia so that we can come to the reality that we're not looking to be redeemed we are already redeemed redeemed means to bring back you've already brought us back lord you've taken care of the sin you've washed it all away you've showed yourself to us you showed us your word we believe your word we've received it lord god i just want to say be it unto me according to your word lord jesus awaken something inside of us that we can be what you've called us to be in this hour with no more questionings no more fightings and strugglings in our mind that we can be free to say i am the bride i am the one he's called i am the one that he has delivered and he's brought me back to whatever i was before i'm not the son of an earthly man and an earthly woman that man is dead but i'm the son of god i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i'm a child of the king and god help us to live that kind of life unlock us lord open us up show us who we really are oh we love you we receive your word we believe it by faith i ask that you would touch any heart that's here any one of your children that struggles with the devil comes to them and beats them up over a past life tries to make them doubt their conversion tries to make them down i pray you would inject the faith in their lord that would combat all those lies that they would recognize you've called them lord and you would unlock the seed lord that you would bring a new birth to them by the baptism of the holy ghost and let that seed life live and bring them back to that condition where they can believe i'm free from the old life i'm free from sin i'm free from hybridization my old husband that my marriage certificate is gone it never happened that marriage is annulled may we be united to you lord may you wash us by the water of your word make us what you've called us to be in this hour god free your children from the lies of the devil let us live a clean pure holy life by your power by your word by your spirit we love you god go with us as we depart
