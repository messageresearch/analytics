[25:14] picnic at their place starting at noon
[25:16] so God bless you hopefully we can see
[25:18] you all there and also this afternoon
[25:21] will be the communion and feet Washing
[25:23] Service we'll come back for so God bless
[25:26] you and we can return for that
[25:28] amen let's look at the scripture while
[25:30] we're standing yet in second Corinthians
[25:33] chapter four
[25:35] verse 18.
[25:38] while we look not at the things which
[25:40] are seen But at the things which are not
[25:43] seen for the things which are seen are
[25:45] temporal but the things which are not
[25:47] seen are Eternal man God bless you as
[25:50] you have your seats
[25:53] amen I love this scripture amen because
[26:00] we are so uh so trained to this life
[26:04] trained to this world trained to the
[26:06] Natural it's everything we've ever known
[26:08] in the natural life we were born into
[26:10] this world we were born into these
[26:12] bodies we were born in this condition
[26:13] amen and as we grow up we see the
[26:17] natural we see the things that around us
[26:19] the things that we can touch and we can
[26:21] feel we can smell it and all of those
[26:23] things but those things are all the
[26:25] temporal
[26:26] but it's the things that are not seen
[26:29] for the things which are are seen are
[26:31] temporal but the things which are not
[26:32] seen are Eternal so so the scripture
[26:36] Apostle Paul tells us we look not to the
[26:38] things that are seen so all of a sudden
[26:40] when we were not to look at the things
[26:43] which are seen But at the things which
[26:45] are not seen amen because the things
[26:47] that are not seen are more real than
[26:49] what's seen
[26:50] and as a Christian there's a greater
[26:52] reality that opens up to us when we're
[26:54] born again by the spirit of God a whole
[26:57] spiritual level opens to us and we begin
[26:59] to have the capacity to move beyond the
[27:01] scene into the Unseen amen for our whole
[27:04] Christian life amen has to do with the
[27:07] Unseen realities amen
[27:09] so I want to look at while we're
[27:11] together let's look at a couple
[27:12] scriptures let's go to First Timothy
[27:14] together
[27:15] First Timothy chapter one
[27:21] and this inspiration came from the
[27:24] preaching on Wednesday night amen I just
[27:26] I was struck as I was done preaching
[27:28] with that with this thought that I want
[27:29] to share with you today and and become
[27:32] so real and in fact the title is the
[27:35] invisible is the real
[27:37] so the invisible is the real if you want
[27:39] to know what real is the invisible is
[27:41] the real
[27:42] and and you know just because
[27:45] something's invisible doesn't mean it
[27:46] doesn't exist
[27:48] the fact that we call it invisible isn't
[27:51] evidence that it exists
[27:53] because if it doesn't exist it can't be
[27:55] invisible I hope that makes sense if I
[27:58] say amen I have something but it's
[28:00] invisible that there's a substance
[28:02] behind that the whole term invisible
[28:04] means something that substance that
[28:06] can't be seen
[28:07] so the fact that we call it invisible
[28:09] means it's real it's a substance it's
[28:12] there we just can't see it amen and
[28:15] let's look at First Timothy 1 17 to show
[28:18] this point
[28:19] it says now unto the king
[28:21] Eternal Immortal invisible the only wise
[28:25] God the honor and Glory forever and ever
[28:30] God is invisible
[28:32] is he real is he substance I venture to
[28:36] say that the invisible God is the only
[28:37] real substance
[28:39] every other substance amen was another
[28:41] substance created for an expression of
[28:44] what was really real
[28:46] but the most real that you can get is
[28:49] all the way back to the original when
[28:51] God Elohim dwelt alone with his thoughts
[28:54] that is the core of real that is the
[28:57] most real that is the originator of real
[28:59] you can get no more real than that real
[29:02] and it's completely invisible
[29:04] totally untangible to anything that we
[29:07] understand to be tangible in this life
[29:09] but that is actually the core of real
[29:11] and everything else amen is is another
[29:15] created reality to express this
[29:18] invisible reality but if you want the
[29:20] real you've got to go back to the Core
[29:23] amen
[29:25] so let's look at Hebrews chapter 12.
[29:30] this is very familiar and say I
[29:32] appreciated the specials very much today
[29:34] man God was good
[29:37] to grant us that and one of those refers
[29:39] to this scripture here Hebrews chapter
[29:42] 12 verse 18. I'd like to begin reading
[29:46] this is something that brother Ben
[29:48] siebel dealt with the last few times he
[29:50] preached but in verse 18 He says for you
[29:53] are not come to the mount that might be
[29:54] touched that burn with fire nor into
[29:56] Blackness and darkness and Tempest and
[29:58] the sound of a trumpet and the voice of
[30:00] Words which voice they that heard and
[30:03] treated that the word should not be
[30:04] spoken to them anymore for they could
[30:07] not endure that which was commanded and
[30:09] if so much as a beast touched the
[30:11] mountain it should be stoned or thrust
[30:12] through with a dark and so terrible was
[30:15] the sight that Moses said I exceedingly
[30:17] fear and Quake but you are coming to
[30:20] Mount Zion
[30:21] so you haven't come to that tangible
[30:24] physical Mountain that you could see
[30:26] that you could feel the earthquake that
[30:28] you could see the lightning and fire and
[30:29] hear the thunder and the voice you have
[30:32] not come to that uh I'd say that reality
[30:36] but you have come to an invisible
[30:38] reality
[30:40] this is what Paul's telling us amen Paul
[30:42] the Apostle is is taking he's taking the
[30:45] Believers beyond the tangible and moving
[30:48] in them to the supernatural into the
[30:50] Unseen
[30:52] amen so you are coming to Mount Zion
[30:55] into the city of the Living God the
[30:56] heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable
[30:58] company of angels so you are come to a
[31:01] place amen he's not saying uh oh he he
[31:05] you're actually brought amen through
[31:07] this new birth to this place this is now
[31:10] a reality to you amen you have come to
[31:13] Mount Zion Amen to the city of the
[31:15] Living God the heavenly Jerusalem you
[31:18] say I want to go to the Heavenly
[31:19] Jerusalem Paul says you've come to it
[31:22] it's unseen it's an unseen reality amen
[31:27] and to an innumerable company of angels
[31:30] to the general assembly in the Church of
[31:32] the firstborn which are written in
[31:33] heaven and to God the judge of all and
[31:36] to the spirits of just men made perfect
[31:38] and to Jesus the mediator of the New
[31:40] Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[31:42] that speaketh better things than that of
[31:44] Abel see that you refuse not him that
[31:47] speaketh for they escape not whom
[31:49] refused him that spake on Earth much
[31:51] more shall not we escape if we turn away
[31:54] from him that speaketh from heaven so
[31:57] there's another voice thundering amen
[31:59] there's another thundering voice Amen in
[32:02] this day not sounding from Earth but
[32:04] sounding from heaven
[32:06] praise God
[32:07] and it's going to take a different set
[32:09] of ears to hear this one
[32:12] verse 27
[32:15] I'm sorry
[32:16] yeah
[32:17] and this word yet once more signifying
[32:19] the removing of those things that are
[32:21] shaken as of things that are made that
[32:24] those things which cannot be shaken May
[32:27] remain
[32:28] now there's come a shaking
[32:31] and the voice in the last day has
[32:33] sounded a thundering and a shaking
[32:36] and that shaking is to remove
[32:39] all things
[32:41] that are temporal all things that are
[32:43] made
[32:44] so that that which is not cannot be
[32:46] shaken what will remain what will remain
[32:49] that which is not made
[32:52] that which is invisible that which is
[32:54] eternal that which is really real
[32:57] so it says we've come to this heavenly
[33:00] Jerusalem if we turn back to Hebrews
[33:02] chapter 11 we'll go back one chapter
[33:04] Hebrews chapter 11 verse 8.
[33:08] speaking of Abraham it says by faith
[33:11] Abraham when he was called to go out
[33:13] into a place which he should have to
[33:15] receive for an inheritance obeyed and he
[33:17] went out not knowing whether he went by
[33:19] faith he sojourn in the land of promise
[33:21] as in a strange country dwelling in
[33:23] Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[33:26] Heirs with him of the same promise for
[33:28] he looked for a city which hath
[33:30] foundations whose Builder and maker was
[33:33] gone
[33:34] praise God
[33:36] he went out wondering amen Abraham never
[33:39] established himself in the land he was
[33:42] looking for something he was looking for
[33:44] something that was real to him amen he
[33:46] wasn't looking for something because it
[33:48] wasn't real amen he wasn't following an
[33:50] imagination but he was looking for
[33:52] something with reality to it he was
[33:54] looking for a city that hath foundations
[33:58] that's not talking about natural
[33:59] foundations where you dig down and plant
[34:01] the stone amen this thing has
[34:02] foundations means it's solidly planted
[34:05] unmovable unshakable it has a foundation
[34:07] and that Foundation is God
[34:10] amen so he was looking for something
[34:12] secure something sure amen something
[34:15] steadfast not anything he could
[34:17] establish on the earth because anything
[34:18] he could establish would be temporal
[34:20] anything he could build would fade away
[34:22] but he was wondering living in tense
[34:24] dwelling with The Heirs of Promise
[34:27] looking for what looking for a city that
[34:29] has foundations whose Builder and maker
[34:31] is gone what city was God building amen
[34:34] it was an invisible City
[34:39] there's a Heavenly Jerusalem
[34:42] the Apostle Paul says in Galatians 4 but
[34:44] Jerusalem which is above is free which
[34:47] is the mother of us all
[34:50] so now this city amen that that Abraham
[34:53] was looking for Paul says it's your
[34:55] mother
[34:58] it's your mother is that City your
[34:59] mother did you come from the Heavenly
[35:01] Jerusalem absolutely amen it's a reality
[35:05] it's a reality to me
[35:07] because I'm born from there
[35:10] it's a reality to me because I come from
[35:12] there that's the city that I'm looking
[35:14] for that's my origin that's my
[35:16] birthplace
[35:18] amen that's why that's why we say when
[35:22] we leave this world where do we want to
[35:24] go we want to go home
[35:26] how many says that I want to go home if
[35:28] you say you want to go home amen you
[35:29] testify that this is not your home you
[35:32] testify you're just a pilgrim and a
[35:33] stranger I mean that you have an origin
[35:35] from somewhere else that's your home
[35:37] it's invisible but it's real and as
[35:39] through the New Birth when you become a
[35:41] Christian it became real to you before
[35:43] this was real amen but the higher we
[35:46] climb in Christ this becomes less real
[35:48] this becomes less real that becomes the
[35:51] real
[35:53] and the more we can make the shift and
[35:56] move from all of this tangible products
[35:58] becoming real to the Unseen becoming the
[36:01] real amen the less the life is going to
[36:03] have an effect in us to keep us from the
[36:05] promise
[36:08] amen we figure you know so much of what
[36:12] we're hindered by are things that are
[36:13] temporal
[36:17] things that will fade away things that
[36:19] will change
[36:20] how many times we're hampered and we're
[36:22] we're held back and we're held down amen
[36:26] emotionally by all these troubles and
[36:29] trials and misunderstandings and and and
[36:32] and wrongdoings and even our own
[36:34] wrongdoings we have all of these things
[36:36] that are such a hinder to us and hamper
[36:38] us amen but they are all temporal
[36:41] it is all temporal it'll all fade away I
[36:44] mean the circumstance that tripped you
[36:46] up so much a year from now will just be
[36:49] a memory it won't even be a reality
[36:51] that's affecting you anymore it only
[36:52] affected you then and God was using it
[36:54] for your growth anyhow and you moved to
[36:56] another place amen and that thing's no
[36:58] longer affecting you because it was
[37:00] temporal
[37:02] but in the day that we were suffering
[37:04] under that trial it was the greatest
[37:07] barrier in our life the most difficult
[37:09] thing we were facing and we were
[37:11] hampered and hindered by something
[37:12] temporal that was going to change
[37:15] and if we can begin to see our lives
[37:17] this way that these things we Face are
[37:19] going to change these circumstances are
[37:21] going to change these things that we
[37:23] deal with they are temporal even if they
[37:25] last a lifetime that's temporal because
[37:27] a lifetime to man is but a vapor it's
[37:30] been a brief moment of Speck in the
[37:33] eternities and we came from eternity we
[37:35] go back to Eternity we will dwell
[37:36] forever in eternity what is 70 80 90
[37:39] years anyways so if it lasts my Earthly
[37:42] lifetime it hardly lasted at all it was
[37:45] temporal
[37:47] but we've got to move Beyond these
[37:50] things into the real reality so that
[37:52] they're not chains about our feet and
[37:54] handcuffs on our hands
[37:57] amen
[38:00] the BAM says in the invisible union he
[38:03] makes a statement referring to what we
[38:05] just read about Abraham looking for the
[38:08] city which happens to be my mother
[38:13] dear God we sit solemnly now
[38:16] a Thanksgiving Day it really is Lord I'm
[38:19] Grateful Lord to be living in this day
[38:21] this is the greatest day Paul the
[38:22] Apostle long to see this day the Great
[38:25] Men of old long to see it the prophets
[38:26] long to see it they looked for this day
[38:29] Abraham looked for this day for he
[38:31] sought for a city whose Builder and
[38:33] maker was God it hangs right above us
[38:36] tonight
[38:38] what what what Abraham was looking for
[38:41] is hanging right over you
[38:43] just reach up and touch it
[38:46] amen the brother Brandon believe it was
[38:48] there absolutely did he declare it was
[38:51] there did your eyes declare it was there
[38:53] no but there's another Sense on the
[38:55] inside that surpasses the ten senses
[38:57] that I'm hindered by in my body and it's
[38:59] the sense of Faith which is the super
[39:01] sense
[39:03] and it's the one I need to touch this
[39:05] unseen reality amen because all my other
[39:08] senses have to do with my Earthly
[39:10] journey and have to do with the temporal
[39:12] but there's another sense that can go
[39:13] beyond the temporal into the unseen
[39:15] reality
[39:16] and that's the sense of faith
[39:20] praise God
[39:22] so let's go back to uh verse one Hebrews
[39:27] 11 verse 1.
[39:30] now Faith is the substance of things
[39:32] hoped for
[39:33] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[39:35] so now Faith is a substance
[39:38] that means faith is real
[39:41] faith is not an emotion faith is not a
[39:43] thought
[39:45] faith is is not a figment of our
[39:48] imagination faith is a substance
[39:51] and it's more substance than the
[39:54] thoughts that pass through your mind
[39:55] that are temporal
[39:57] the thoughts of fear and anxiety they're
[39:59] temporal amen they fade away even
[40:02] thoughts of excitement and enthusiasm
[40:03] they fade away all of these emotions are
[40:06] so temporal you can have emotional
[40:08] whiplashing man you can go from the
[40:10] highest height to the lowest lows in the
[40:12] matter of seconds
[40:15] I mean you you can be having the perfect
[40:17] day in one phone call one text message
[40:20] one comment from somebody can take you
[40:22] from the highest to the absolute lowest
[40:24] it's absolutely temporal that's these
[40:27] emotions it's in the spirit realm amen
[40:29] these these these uh uh these senses in
[40:32] the outside realm to see touch feel
[40:35] smell taste and hear amen they they're
[40:37] all temporal amen they're only for a
[40:39] moment the moment that smells there the
[40:41] moment that site's there it's all
[40:43] temporal it fades away amen and it's all
[40:45] Del it's all dealing with the temporal
[40:47] but there's one super sense that God has
[40:49] given his children and that is the super
[40:51] sense of faith that can go beyond all of
[40:54] that amen and you can have the worst day
[40:56] of the worst news you can feel utterly
[40:59] depressed frightened scared with anxiety
[41:01] worry all of these things can come on
[41:03] but a super sense can go beyond the
[41:05] temporal and say but my God has made a
[41:08] promise in his word he'll never leave me
[41:09] nor forsake me
[41:12] the supersense can override all these
[41:15] senses
[41:17] so the invisible
[41:19] is the real
[41:24] so now Faith is the substance of things
[41:27] hoped for the evidence
[41:29] of Things Not Seen
[41:31] what's my evidence not something I see
[41:37] we have so tried to come up with
[41:40] evidences for being children of God that
[41:43] are tangible because that's the only
[41:44] world we understand
[41:47] we want proofs we want we want to be
[41:49] able to show something or have something
[41:51] that declares uh declares and proves
[41:54] that I'm a Child of God Amen but this
[41:58] faith is the substance of things so
[42:00] forth it is the evidence of the Unseen
[42:03] World
[42:05] what evidence do you want the only
[42:08] evidence that is real and that is faith
[42:12] praise God
[42:14] and that's a gift of God
[42:17] we thank God for that
[42:19] for by it the elders obtained a good
[42:21] report through faith we understand that
[42:24] the worlds were framed by the word of
[42:26] God
[42:27] so that the things which are seen were
[42:30] not made of things which do appear
[42:33] I love this scripture I want to spend
[42:35] just a moment on it
[42:37] by faith we understand that the world's
[42:39] refrained by the word of God so God even
[42:42] uh framed the world through faith his
[42:45] own faith
[42:46] by the word he spoke the word and had to
[42:48] believe his own word
[42:51] so that the things which are seen
[42:54] were not made of things which do appear
[42:58] so God did not take
[43:01] the visible tangible world and make a
[43:04] visible tangible world he made
[43:06] everything we see out of things that
[43:09] don't appear
[43:13] let's just think about that for a moment
[43:17] everything we see in creation
[43:20] was made of things that do not appear
[43:25] so which came first the things that do
[43:28] not appear which means they were
[43:30] substance
[43:31] there is an unseen substance there's
[43:34] something and don't ask me to describe
[43:36] it I don't know how to describe it but
[43:39] there's some unseen something that does
[43:41] not appear and God took that substance
[43:44] and made this tangible world out of that
[43:47] substance that came first that's more
[43:49] real than this
[43:51] because this was made from that
[43:54] so everything that appears was made from
[43:56] that which does not appear so that which
[43:58] does not appear preceded this and is
[44:00] more real than this
[44:03] so it was a reality a substance not an
[44:06] imagination not emotion not a thought an
[44:09] emotion not a thought I mean we have to
[44:10] go beyond the whole religious realm who
[44:13] who are or the the Realms of religion
[44:16] that are dealing with thoughts and
[44:18] they're dealing with theories and
[44:20] they're dealing with all of these things
[44:21] this isn't a thought this isn't a theory
[44:23] amen God's not a theory amen religion
[44:26] isn't a way of thinking it's an absolute
[44:29] substance
[44:30] that superseded this substance that this
[44:33] substance was made from
[44:38] so we have to stop dealing with God as
[44:41] is he's an imagination or he's a thought
[44:43] or he's a concept he's not a concept
[44:49] he's not a religious concept he's also
[44:52] not a Feeling
[44:56] he's not a theory he's not an idea
[45:00] he is the only real reality
[45:07] praise God
[45:09] brother Ben said intellectual
[45:11] conceptions is all right
[45:14] you remember when the eye looks upon it
[45:16] the devil uses your eye
[45:18] and the Garden of Eden proved that the
[45:20] devil chose the head of man to work in
[45:21] but God chooses his heart the devil
[45:24] shows him with his eye something he can
[45:26] see and he says seeing is believing but
[45:29] when God comes to a man he comes to his
[45:31] heart and he lets him believe things by
[45:33] his heart through faith that his eyes
[45:35] does not see for the scripture sayeth
[45:38] that the faith is the substance of the
[45:39] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[45:41] Not Seen
[45:42] praise God
[45:44] let's turn to John chapter 20.
[46:08] John chapter 20.
[46:14] John 20 and 26 and after eight days
[46:17] again his disciples were within this is
[46:19] after the resurrection
[46:21] and Thomas with them then came Jesus the
[46:24] doors being shut and stood in the midst
[46:26] and said Peace be unto you then said he
[46:28] to Thomas reach hither thy finger and
[46:30] behold my hands and reach hither thy
[46:32] hands and thrust it into my side and be
[46:34] not faithless but believing and Thomas
[46:37] answered and said unto him my Lord and
[46:39] my God Jesus saith unto him Thomas
[46:42] because thou has seen me thou has
[46:44] believed
[46:45] blessed are they that have not seen and
[46:48] yet have believed
[46:50] Thomas needed to see something
[46:53] Thomas declared I won't believe it until
[46:56] I can take my finger and thrust it into
[46:58] the nail print and take my hand and
[47:00] thrust it and decide Thomas needed to
[47:02] see Something to Believe In amen and
[47:04] Jesus was good to Thomas and that he
[47:06] would give Thomas that opportunity but
[47:08] he says but blessed there's a blessing
[47:10] that comes to those who don't see but
[47:13] believe
[47:14] amen you've never had the opportunity
[47:16] Thomas had you didn't even have the
[47:18] opportunity that they had in that room
[47:20] that day amen when Jesus resurrected and
[47:23] entered into the room you weren't there
[47:25] by the Sea of Tiberius you weren't there
[47:27] to see him caught up with clouds into
[47:28] heaven you haven't had that opportunity
[47:30] but praise God you have the same Faith
[47:33] they have and can believe just as much
[47:35] as they believe without seeing because
[47:37] it's a blessing for us to believe
[47:39] without seeing
[47:43] amen so we're always wanting to see
[47:46] something remember but but he says the
[47:48] blessed is those who can believe without
[47:51] seeing
[47:52] amen praise God and don't get me wrong I
[47:54] still want to see something
[47:56] please don't get me wrong
[47:58] but the blessing is faith
[48:02] let's go to First Peter chapter one
[48:11] you know the Bible proves that the
[48:14] blessing is faith
[48:16] because how many saw Jesus Christ
[48:20] saw him saw the Miracles saw the lame
[48:24] walk but how many believed he was the
[48:26] Messiah
[48:28] the blessing is faith
[48:30] not just seeing
[48:33] huh how much did Judas see
[48:37] but yet he couldn't believe
[48:40] so the blessing is not seen the bless
[48:42] the greater blessing is believing
[48:46] I mean how many Saw God in this day us
[48:50] all the son of man amen working through
[48:52] a son of man and absolutely declaring
[48:54] himself by the sign of the Messiah how
[48:56] many people saw it many people saw it
[48:59] how many people believed
[49:01] how did you believe
[49:04] God gave it to you to believe there was
[49:07] a sea Gene of God that could say that
[49:08] ain't nothing but the truth how did the
[49:10] how how did the woman who broke the
[49:12] alabaster box how did she recognize how
[49:15] did she see why did she know what to do
[49:16] amen it wasn't through training it was
[49:18] through faith how did the woman of
[49:19] Samaria how did she know how did blind
[49:21] Bartimaeus know how did they all blind
[49:24] Barn a man who was blind he could see
[49:25] Jesus
[49:28] he could see who he was amen but when
[49:31] those with open eyes were looking right
[49:33] at him and couldn't see who he was but
[49:34] the blind man was declaring amen thou
[49:37] son of David have mercy on me he knew
[49:39] this was the Messiah
[49:42] amen the Unseen is the reality
[49:46] amen first Peter
[49:48] chapter one
[49:50] verse 6.
[49:53] said wherein you greatly rejoiced them
[49:55] now for a season if need be you are in
[49:57] heaviness through manifold Temptations
[49:59] that the trial of your faith being much
[50:01] more precious than of gold that perishes
[50:02] though it be tried with fire might be
[50:05] found into the praise and honor and
[50:06] Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[50:09] whom having not seen you love
[50:12] and whom though now you see him not ye
[50:15] yet believing you rejoice with joy
[50:17] unspeakable and full of Glory receiving
[50:21] the end of your faith even the salvation
[50:23] of your souls amen Paul now is writing
[50:27] to the Gentiles they didn't have the
[50:29] opportunity he had he saw Jesus but
[50:31] Judas also saw Jesus so Peter recognized
[50:35] that it is by faith by grace now he says
[50:38] now you have not seen you love
[50:41] you love you haven't seen him but you
[50:43] love him those who saw him couldn't love
[50:45] him but you didn't see him and you love
[50:46] him
[50:48] though you have not seen him not seen
[50:50] him not yet believing you rejoice with
[50:53] joy we have joy unspeakable and
[50:56] rejoicing and what in the unseen reality
[50:59] what brings us joy the Unseen
[51:02] what Thrills our heart amen what what
[51:05] gives us such Joy what gives us such
[51:07] peace what gives us exhilaration and
[51:09] exuberance and excitement amen is not
[51:12] something you can take out and show to
[51:13] somebody else the thing that Thrills our
[51:15] soul is that which can't be seen
[51:20] praise God
[51:22] who is it we love and adore
[51:25] the one that this Earth can't see
[51:28] but we can see him
[51:32] Jesus says the world won't see me but
[51:34] you'll see me
[51:36] and the disciples were confused by this
[51:39] seeing because they still only
[51:40] understand carnal they were seeing him
[51:42] then and they thought they were going to
[51:44] continue to go on seeing him when the
[51:46] comforter came but when the comforter
[51:47] comes you're not going to see me I mean
[51:50] the world won't see me but you'll see me
[51:51] right now the world can see me and you
[51:54] can see me but there's coming a day the
[51:55] world can't see me but you can see me
[51:59] and they asked they asked a very
[52:01] reasonable question
[52:03] amen do you agree it was a reasonable
[52:05] question when they said how is it that
[52:07] we'll see you and the world won't see
[52:09] you
[52:10] like how's that going to happen amen
[52:12] that's a reasonable question that's why
[52:14] we don't rely on reasoning because
[52:15] reasoning takes is absolutely the wrong
[52:17] direction that was an extremely
[52:19] reasonable question to ask but it took
[52:21] him in the absolute wrong direction
[52:22] because this isn't going to be a
[52:24] physical seeing this is going to be a
[52:26] spiritual seeing
[52:29] it says now in questions and answers
[52:31] from 59 the prophet says the Christian
[52:34] looks at things that he does not see
[52:35] with his eyes
[52:37] for we look at the Unseen
[52:39] how do you look at it with your inside
[52:42] eyes
[52:43] you know if you're a child of God with a
[52:46] gene of God inside of you you've got
[52:47] inside eyes
[52:49] and you've got inside ears
[52:52] amen
[52:54] you see it by faith
[52:58] and now to prove that the whole
[52:59] Christian armor is made up of unseen
[53:01] qualities what is a Christian armor
[53:03] somebody says seeing is believing that
[53:05] person would never be a Christian
[53:08] because the armor of the Christian is
[53:10] made up of this love did you ever see it
[53:12] you've seen it in action but you never
[53:14] seen love
[53:15] if you can pull your part of Love out
[53:18] and let me see what it looks like see
[53:19] look love joy peace long-suffering
[53:22] goodness meekness faithfulness uh
[53:24] faithfulness gentleness the whole
[53:26] Christian armor is unseen with the
[53:28] natural eye but it is understood by the
[53:30] heart
[53:32] and the message awaking Jesus is now I
[53:34] think that's marvelous and that gives
[53:35] illiterate people like me a chance
[53:37] everybody to believe it because we hear
[53:39] it and Faith cometh by hearing and
[53:41] hearing of the word of God then we
[53:44] accept that and believe that and upon
[53:46] the basis of our faith in that we are
[53:48] saved healed and whatever more we're
[53:51] drawn we draw from God comes from an
[53:54] unseen resource
[53:56] whatever we're drawing is coming from an
[53:58] unseen resource and we tap into it by
[54:01] faith
[54:02] I'm going to ask you about this unseen
[54:03] resource
[54:05] just because it's unseen doesn't mean
[54:08] it's not real
[54:09] what is this unseen resource it was the
[54:12] same resource that this world was made
[54:13] by
[54:15] because what the scene was made of that
[54:17] which does not appear it's an unseen
[54:19] resource amen but that unseen resource
[54:21] had enough reality had enough
[54:24] tangibility had enough substance that it
[54:27] could make this world the universe the
[54:29] galaxies the stars as far as you can go
[54:31] it made all of that substance out of one
[54:34] a greater substance that was the unseen
[54:36] reality and it's this unseen resource we
[54:39] can tap into now and if it can create a
[54:42] universe can it heal your body if it can
[54:44] create a universe can it deliver you if
[54:46] you can create a universe could he
[54:47] answer your questions
[54:50] how do I get into this same resource
[54:53] that God used to create this world Amen
[54:56] you get there by faith in the word of
[54:58] God and God created this by faith in his
[55:00] own word you get to the Unseen resource
[55:03] and pull out of the bank of resources
[55:05] they're not imaginations they're
[55:08] substance
[55:11] and we pull that substance down by faith
[55:15] amen
[55:20] he goes on in the same court he says
[55:21] Christians the whole armor of
[55:23] Christianity is faith everything that we
[55:25] have is unseen the only things that's
[55:28] real is unseen I like that the only
[55:31] thing that's real is unseen
[55:33] we have our cars we have our houses we
[55:36] have
[55:36] but
[55:38] it's not real
[55:40] you say brother Chad it's real I'll say
[55:42] it this way it's real in a way
[55:45] but in comparison to real it's not real
[55:49] do you understand
[55:53] it's like if you live give a little girl
[55:55] a dolly that's her dolly she becomes a
[55:57] mother to that Dolly that's real to her
[56:00] but is it real in comparison to a live
[56:03] baby that she no it's not it it's real
[56:06] but it's not real
[56:09] there's a greater reality that this
[56:11] reality is reflecting
[56:13] a little girl with a desire to be a mama
[56:15] holding a babies reflecting a greater
[56:17] reality but it's a reflection it's a
[56:19] lower form there's a greater reality yet
[56:21] that this reality came from
[56:24] amen and the whole the whole uh uh the
[56:28] whole concept we have the whole desire
[56:29] to worship God the whole desire to love
[56:32] God and worship God and come together in
[56:33] Fellowship it's reflecting a greater
[56:35] reality yet amen some place that we came
[56:37] from some place we're going to another
[56:40] dimension all together and this is just
[56:42] reflecting that back on the Earth
[56:45] amen
[56:47] and the message look brother remember
[56:48] says now remember the whole Christian
[56:50] armor is Supernatural if you're a
[56:52] Christian you say seeing is believing
[56:54] you can never be a Christian if you
[56:56] believe that
[56:57] oh let's drive this home down now amen
[57:00] you have to prove it to me if I have to
[57:02] prove it to you you can never be a
[57:04] Christian
[57:05] if you say seeing is believing seeing is
[57:07] believing amen seeing is not believing
[57:11] because they saw and didn't believe
[57:15] so I mean praise God
[57:18] you say singers believe me you can never
[57:19] be a Christian if you believe that your
[57:22] faith is the substance of things hoped
[57:23] for the evidence of things not seen you
[57:25] cannot be a Christian and have to see
[57:27] the thing the whole armor of God is
[57:29] Supernatural love joy peace Faith long
[57:31] suffering goodness meekness gentleness
[57:33] and the Holy Ghost is all unseen
[57:36] and the Christian doesn't look to what
[57:38] he sees with his eyes he looks to what
[57:40] he sees with his faith and his faith can
[57:43] only be based upon one thing that's the
[57:46] word
[57:47] so glad he said that
[57:50] amen
[57:51] we can have people try to get us to have
[57:53] faith in all kinds of things but we can
[57:55] only really have faith in one thing and
[57:56] that's the word
[57:58] amen
[58:00] praise God
[58:03] in the message looking at the Unseen
[58:06] brother bear says now if you want to
[58:08] know there was something happened in the
[58:10] building just then a healing it's a lady
[58:13] sitting here right out here in the
[58:15] audience kind of a heavyset lady she's
[58:16] got her hands up and her eyes closed to
[58:18] pray she's got a bowel trouble and a
[58:21] back trouble and she's praying for God
[58:23] to heal her she's sitting right there
[58:25] wearing glasses and a dark suit on right
[58:27] at the end of this row you that's got
[58:29] your hands you there that's got your
[58:31] hands up that's what was wrong with you
[58:33] if that's right raise your hands like
[58:35] that
[58:36] I don't know you do I no sir we're
[58:39] strangers go home now you touch the
[58:43] border of His Garment
[58:46] you touched him
[58:49] because I'm 20 feet from you but you
[58:52] touched him the high priest that could
[58:54] be touched by the feeling of our
[58:55] infirmities
[58:57] brother Madam with a gift that God gave
[58:59] him amen that gift was not healing that
[59:02] woman amen that gift was declaring back
[59:05] to her what just happened to her
[59:08] and she had to raise her hand to testify
[59:10] that that's what happened to her amen
[59:11] and she may not have understood what
[59:13] happened but brother Madam understood
[59:15] what happened she had touched to him of
[59:17] the high priest Karma she had touched
[59:19] him
[59:21] amen and and brothers trying to get the
[59:23] people to see it's not me I'm 20 feet
[59:26] from you it's not touching me amen you
[59:28] have to go beyond this vessel this
[59:31] Tabernacle and you've got to go to the
[59:33] high priest and you've got to touch him
[59:35] and if you can touch him you can be made
[59:37] every bit whole
[59:39] we see this in Luke chapter eight I want
[59:41] to read this scripture in Luke chapter
[59:43] 8.
[59:47] Luke chapter 8 is when this woman with
[59:49] the blood issue
[59:52] touches the hymn of Jesus garment
[59:56] brother Ben refers to this so many times
[59:59] I'm going to read from chapter 8 and
[1:00:01] Luke verse 43.
[1:00:05] and the woman having an issue of blood
[1:00:07] 12 years which had spent all her living
[1:00:09] upon Physicians neither could be healed
[1:00:11] of any came behind him and touched the
[1:00:13] border of His Garment and immediately
[1:00:15] her issue of blood staunched and Jesus
[1:00:19] said who touched me
[1:00:21] when all denied Peter and they that were
[1:00:23] with him said Master the multitude
[1:00:26] thronged thee and press thee and sayest
[1:00:28] thou who touched me and Jesus said
[1:00:31] somebody hath touched me for I perceive
[1:00:34] that virtue has gone out of me
[1:00:36] such an interesting scripture brother
[1:00:38] remember refers to it when he says Peter
[1:00:41] said Peter rebuked him he said in other
[1:00:43] words he'd say like this Lord what are
[1:00:45] you talking about who touched you
[1:00:46] they're all climbing over one another to
[1:00:48] touch you
[1:00:50] as I said they all strong the impress
[1:00:52] thee is what what Peter said he says so
[1:00:56] he's rebuking Jesus and he's saying what
[1:00:59] do you mean by that they're all trying
[1:01:01] to touch you they're all pressing in to
[1:01:02] touch you
[1:01:04] he said but I perceive that I've gotten
[1:01:05] weak virtues gone from me somebody
[1:01:08] touched him with a different kind of a
[1:01:10] touch
[1:01:12] oh praise God you realize that her touch
[1:01:17] may have manifested in physical form
[1:01:19] when she reached out and touched the
[1:01:21] hymn of her garment but others were
[1:01:22] touching him
[1:01:24] remember the soldiers were touching him
[1:01:26] when they stripped him and they beat him
[1:01:27] and they weren't healed they weren't
[1:01:28] delivered they didn't have Supernatural
[1:01:30] experiences there was many guards that
[1:01:32] were capturing him that touched him he
[1:01:34] had been touched by many that day they
[1:01:36] were all thronging and pressing him and
[1:01:38] touching him amen but he never stopped
[1:01:40] and said somebody touched me although he
[1:01:42] was being touched so you see the
[1:01:44] physical act of her touch amen wasn't
[1:01:46] the touch it was the representation of
[1:01:49] the touch it was a physical expression
[1:01:51] of the touch but the real touch was a
[1:01:54] faith touch because she knew in her
[1:01:57] heart she believed in her heart if I can
[1:02:00] but Touch the Hem of His Garment I can
[1:02:02] be made every bit whole the touch that
[1:02:04] touched him was the touch of faith not
[1:02:07] the physical touch
[1:02:08] [Music]
[1:02:11] the physical touch was the manifestation
[1:02:14] of her touch of faith
[1:02:17] it was her faith being expressed because
[1:02:19] she believed if I touched him of His
[1:02:22] Garment others touched and touched for
[1:02:24] whatever reason they touched amen but
[1:02:26] she touched because of her faith amen
[1:02:28] and when she touched him that way by
[1:02:30] faith he stopped in his tracks with the
[1:02:32] crowd thronging and pressing upon him
[1:02:35] and he says who touched me so much so
[1:02:36] that Peter and the other disciples are
[1:02:38] bewildered at the statement but he knew
[1:02:40] strength left me somebody touched me in
[1:02:43] a different way
[1:02:47] oh I say God give us Faith to reach out
[1:02:50] and touch him amen touch him today in
[1:02:53] his Supernatural spiritual way may there
[1:02:55] be a something come alive inside of us
[1:02:57] in our heart that we realize if I can
[1:03:00] just by faith reach up and touch him
[1:03:02] amen you may not have to move your hands
[1:03:04] you may not have to move your mouth but
[1:03:06] if your heart can move your faith into
[1:03:09] action and you can reach out in the
[1:03:11] spiritual realm and grab a hold of the
[1:03:13] high priest amen the touch to him of His
[1:03:14] Garment you can be made every bit whole
[1:03:21] you can touch him the same way she
[1:03:24] touched him
[1:03:30] praise God
[1:03:33] amen
[1:03:35] going to the greater reality
[1:03:41] amen
[1:03:42] brother Branham came
[1:03:45] and he he at the end of his ministry he
[1:03:49] he started nailing down
[1:03:52] uh this concept of eleazer fetching a
[1:03:56] bride and a bride calling out a bride
[1:03:59] for Christ and then he comes into the
[1:04:02] union he preaches proving his word and
[1:04:05] in there he tells us
[1:04:07] that the marriage is now
[1:04:10] that the union is taking place now the
[1:04:13] marriage is now
[1:04:15] and and he comes in the message he
[1:04:17] preaches the invisible Union of the
[1:04:19] bride of Christ
[1:04:20] and he makes this statement and here
[1:04:22] said in the invisible Union of the
[1:04:24] church the bride to Christ there's an
[1:04:27] invisible Union that is going on right
[1:04:29] now between the bride of Christ and
[1:04:32] Jesus Christ there is a marriage that is
[1:04:34] taking place
[1:04:36] amen and I want to ask you what did you
[1:04:39] see in that marriage amen what were the
[1:04:42] decorations like
[1:04:45] amen what were the decorations like amen
[1:04:48] what was the what were the Motions amen
[1:04:50] not everybody got married at the same
[1:04:52] time
[1:04:55] but if you've come into this Union with
[1:04:58] your bridegroom with Jesus Christ then
[1:05:00] you've come into an invisible Union with
[1:05:02] Christ amen and there's nothing that you
[1:05:04] can show there's no evidence that you
[1:05:07] have you can show evidences amen you can
[1:05:10] show the outworkings of it but you can't
[1:05:12] show that Union it's invisible and takes
[1:05:15] place in The Invisible Realm
[1:05:19] amen
[1:05:21] I mean Brother Bear comes down
[1:05:25] he he's he's he's he's playing the part
[1:05:28] of Eliezer from the Old Testament and
[1:05:30] he's here he's a forerunner to Christ
[1:05:32] he's a forerunner to the second coming
[1:05:34] he's here declaring the appearing of the
[1:05:36] Lord declaring that the presence of the
[1:05:38] Lord is here he's here to preach the
[1:05:40] opening of the seals showing that the
[1:05:42] bridegroom is now present what's the
[1:05:44] bridegroom the revealed word
[1:05:48] showing that the lamb took the book and
[1:05:50] opened the seals showing the presence of
[1:05:52] the bridegroom here for a union he's
[1:05:54] here to bring the two together he's here
[1:05:57] to unite the body and the head together
[1:05:59] so he's doing this in his ministry and
[1:06:01] he comes to proving his word and he
[1:06:03] begins to declare that the marriage is
[1:06:05] now it's taking place now and you go
[1:06:08] back and you say when was it what
[1:06:10] ceremony did he say what words when did
[1:06:13] Brother Branham what point did he unite
[1:06:15] these two things together you can't go
[1:06:18] back and say that was the moment that
[1:06:19] was the sentence that was it amen it was
[1:06:22] he was preaching Christ and presenting
[1:06:24] Christ and there was somebody out there
[1:06:26] that was able to get a hold of Christ
[1:06:27] and say I want to be in Union with him
[1:06:31] and there was a marriage that was taking
[1:06:32] place and a marriage has been taking
[1:06:34] place since
[1:06:41] and that should be the most real thing
[1:06:43] to us
[1:06:45] that is
[1:06:47] listen that is if you're married that
[1:06:49] Union is more real than your physical
[1:06:51] Union with your spouse
[1:06:54] your physical Union with your spouse is
[1:06:56] only a a dollar reflection of this
[1:07:01] this is the thing that is most real
[1:07:06] this is the real reality of Our Lives
[1:07:10] there's a certain reality to our lives
[1:07:12] there's a reality that we have a job
[1:07:14] reality we go to work there's a reality
[1:07:16] we have a house there's a reality we
[1:07:18] have a family of friends we have we have
[1:07:20] certain things we do that's all a
[1:07:21] reality amen but there's a greater
[1:07:23] reality above all of that and beyond all
[1:07:25] of that
[1:07:27] and that greater reality needs to be the
[1:07:29] reality of Our Lives
[1:07:31] the Unseen Union between me and Christ
[1:07:34] amen it should be reflected in my life
[1:07:37] absolutely
[1:07:39] but the the actual Union takes place in
[1:07:42] my soul
[1:07:43] and I can't take it out and show it to
[1:07:45] you
[1:07:49] I've received it by faith I believe it
[1:07:51] by faith I declare by the faith is the
[1:07:54] substance of that Union for me
[1:07:56] faith is the evidence of that Union for
[1:07:59] me
[1:08:02] Amen in in the Samaritan Church age out
[1:08:06] of the church age book
[1:08:07] Prophet begins to teach and he says what
[1:08:11] watch carefully now and see this before
[1:08:12] there was ever a speck of Stardust
[1:08:14] before God was God God is an object of
[1:08:17] adoration and no one was there to
[1:08:19] worship him so he was at that time only
[1:08:21] potentially God what a statement
[1:08:24] who in the world has the courage to even
[1:08:26] make a statement like that
[1:08:28] only somebody who understands
[1:08:31] he understands what he's talking about
[1:08:33] he knows the great Elohim the
[1:08:36] self-existent one he was there alone
[1:08:39] nothing else was there as far as I don't
[1:08:43] even want to say that
[1:08:45] because it's not that's not even
[1:08:46] technically true but anything that you
[1:08:48] would see as tangible even as light
[1:08:52] dust molecules things in the universe
[1:08:56] microbes or organisms or nothing was
[1:08:59] there
[1:09:00] all of that was created later
[1:09:03] he dwelt alone with his thoughts
[1:09:10] so that means
[1:09:11] before there was manifested light
[1:09:17] God was with his thoughts
[1:09:23] let's keep reading
[1:09:25] and he was known only as eternal spirit
[1:09:28] the bride was already in his mind
[1:09:32] yes she was she was existing in his
[1:09:36] thoughts
[1:09:37] oh my goodness
[1:09:40] and what about those thoughts of God
[1:09:42] they are Eternal are they not
[1:09:46] the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask
[1:09:49] you are the thoughts of God Eternal if
[1:09:51] you can see this you will see many
[1:09:53] things God is unchangeable in both
[1:09:56] Essence and behavior we have studied
[1:09:58] that and proven that already God is
[1:10:00] infinite in his ability so therefore he
[1:10:03] as God must be omniscient if he is
[1:10:05] omniscient then he is not now learning
[1:10:07] nor is he taking counsel even with
[1:10:09] himself nor is he at any time adding to
[1:10:12] his knowledge if he can add to his
[1:10:14] knowledge then he is not omniscient the
[1:10:17] best we could say is that sometime he
[1:10:19] will be but that is not scriptural
[1:10:22] he is omniscient he has never had a new
[1:10:27] thought about anything because all of
[1:10:28] his thoughts he has always had and
[1:10:30] always will have and knows the end from
[1:10:33] the beginning because he is God
[1:10:35] thus the thoughts of God are Eternal
[1:10:38] they are real
[1:10:45] I love this
[1:10:47] the prophet says
[1:10:48] the bride was already in his mind she
[1:10:52] was existing in his thoughts
[1:10:56] back before he began to create even the
[1:10:59] Heavenly realm back before he even
[1:11:01] created the pillar of Fire
[1:11:04] before there was anything to declare or
[1:11:07] to express before anything that was made
[1:11:09] in the heavens or in the earth before
[1:11:11] any of that he was alone with his
[1:11:13] thoughts and those thoughts are his
[1:11:14] attributes we will learn this as we go
[1:11:16] and and and those attributes were his
[1:11:19] family and in his mind and his thoughts
[1:11:21] he had his bride amen and that makes his
[1:11:24] bride those in the bride existed in his
[1:11:27] thoughts amen before there was anything
[1:11:29] else when there was only the originator
[1:11:32] of real the only true real the real real
[1:11:34] the only real real the real that all
[1:11:36] other real comes from in there amen if
[1:11:39] you're a son or daughter of God you were
[1:11:41] there then amen so you transcend
[1:11:44] everything all the Unseen you can go
[1:11:46] beyond all of that
[1:11:47] [Music]
[1:11:50] you say I want to go to heaven you were
[1:11:53] before heaven was created amen as a
[1:11:55] thought in the mind of God be we want to
[1:11:58] go to a place we want to go to heaven we
[1:12:00] want to escape this that's just moving
[1:12:02] into another dimension another reality
[1:12:04] another created sphere amen but before
[1:12:07] he created that sphere you were real you
[1:12:10] existed real in his thoughts
[1:12:16] and when we say you listen I'm not
[1:12:18] talking about your flesh your eyebrows
[1:12:20] your hair I'm not talking about all of
[1:12:21] that God had a thought an identity that
[1:12:23] he was going to bring flesh into and
[1:12:25] show that but it's the sieging the
[1:12:27] attribute the portion of God word life
[1:12:30] eternal life light whatever you want to
[1:12:31] call it that was to be you that was to
[1:12:34] be a portion of God expressed as you
[1:12:38] and that true reality of you was there
[1:12:40] before there was anything else
[1:12:47] amen
[1:12:50] oh
[1:12:54] I want to read this again
[1:12:55] thus the thoughts of God are Eternal
[1:12:58] they are real
[1:13:02] listen we gotta Hammer that down because
[1:13:04] as human beings amen my thoughts
[1:13:08] are not real
[1:13:11] I have thoughts that never materialize
[1:13:15] I have thoughts that are proven wrong
[1:13:18] I have thoughts that I have to retract
[1:13:22] is that right but God's not like me he
[1:13:25] doesn't have a fallen mind
[1:13:28] so when we start talking about the
[1:13:30] thoughts of God Amen we've got to break
[1:13:32] out of the natural and move beyond the
[1:13:34] limitations of our mind and recognize a
[1:13:37] perfect mind that when he thought of
[1:13:38] himself it was a perfect thought
[1:13:41] it was an eternal thought he was
[1:13:43] thinking of himself amen what is the
[1:13:45] Eternal thought of God it's his eternal
[1:13:47] thought about himself how he will
[1:13:49] Express himself his attributes the
[1:13:51] fullness of him being expressed as a
[1:13:54] family God thought that before the
[1:13:56] foundation of the world and you were
[1:13:58] part of that thought because you were
[1:13:59] intended to be part of that expression
[1:14:04] so I know I mean when we start dealing
[1:14:06] with this we're dealing with things that
[1:14:08] are so far removed from the things we've
[1:14:10] known all of our life that only only
[1:14:13] faith is going to allow us to penetrate
[1:14:15] beyond our carnal mind beyond all of our
[1:14:17] experiences beyond the natural that
[1:14:19] we've been locked into and pierced
[1:14:21] beyond all of that and see that this is
[1:14:23] absolutely nothing but the truth and the
[1:14:25] only real real there is
[1:14:31] so I want to say the statement again
[1:14:33] thus the thoughts of God are Eternal
[1:14:35] they are real
[1:14:38] I want to make this other statement from
[1:14:39] the paragraph before the bride was
[1:14:41] already in his mind
[1:14:43] she was existing in his thoughts
[1:14:49] sometimes I we've had the tendency
[1:14:53] to almost downplay that
[1:14:56] like
[1:14:58] I was there before but not only in his
[1:14:59] thoughts is there anything more real
[1:15:01] than his thoughts
[1:15:03] is there any existence more real than
[1:15:07] his thoughts
[1:15:09] so don't say that was only in his
[1:15:11] thoughts
[1:15:12] say that was already in his thoughts
[1:15:14] that's where everything originated from
[1:15:17] that makes it more real than any other
[1:15:20] expression that is the real expression
[1:15:22] that's the genuine that's the first
[1:15:25] that's I hope you see what I'm saying
[1:15:27] we can't say well you know I existed
[1:15:30] before I was in heaven before I have
[1:15:32] representation in him well that was only
[1:15:33] as a thought my goodness you want
[1:15:35] anything more than that I mean only as a
[1:15:37] thought a genuine thought of God an
[1:15:39] attribute of God God thinking of himself
[1:15:41] God himself I was there real existing in
[1:15:46] his thoughts and you say a statement
[1:15:47] like only in his thinking only is
[1:15:49] thinking where else do you want to
[1:15:51] originate
[1:15:52] do you want to pop out somewhere else
[1:15:54] down the line no I want to originate
[1:15:56] right there and if I originate there no
[1:15:58] matter where I pop out down the line it
[1:16:01] goes right back to my original existence
[1:16:03] in the mind of God
[1:16:07] so you got to go so far beyond this
[1:16:10] carnal so far beyond the tangible so far
[1:16:13] beyond Realms and dimensions
[1:16:15] because Realms and dimensions were
[1:16:17] created to express God's thoughts
[1:16:24] I'm telling you this message is so deep
[1:16:27] no earthly man could have preached this
[1:16:29] but it's so simple
[1:16:32] it's not complicated but when you try to
[1:16:35] understand it by carnality it just
[1:16:38] doesn't add up because I only know
[1:16:40] matter space and time I only know here
[1:16:42] and there I only know now and then but
[1:16:45] there was a time that I knew before that
[1:16:47] and there's something inside of me that
[1:16:49] still knows what I knew before that
[1:16:55] word
[1:16:57] attribute of thought
[1:16:59] of God a c Gene a portion
[1:17:03] so many ways to describe it but it links
[1:17:06] back to the same thing
[1:17:09] amen
[1:17:11] that is the unseen reality that must be
[1:17:16] our reality
[1:17:18] listen if this unseen reality becomes
[1:17:21] real To Us by a gift of faith then the
[1:17:23] trials of Life they're really I I don't
[1:17:27] want to trivialize anything but really
[1:17:29] they're nothing
[1:17:30] now I don't want to trivialize I've been
[1:17:32] through some hard times listen I've been
[1:17:34] through some times where I've wept I've
[1:17:36] wept into my pillow I've had sleepless
[1:17:38] nights real trials real hard times that
[1:17:41] I absolutely thought that I was
[1:17:42] physically dying there's times that I
[1:17:44] thought my mind my mind was actually
[1:17:47] being twisted and broken apart inside my
[1:17:49] head
[1:17:50] the pressure was so great it was so
[1:17:53] intense I would there are times when
[1:17:55] death would have been a release
[1:17:59] so I don't want to trivialize it and say
[1:18:01] it's nothing and this Dimension it's the
[1:18:03] most horrible thing you can go through
[1:18:06] but when we step away and look at the
[1:18:08] unseen reality of God it's actually
[1:18:11] nothing
[1:18:13] it's temporal it's not the real it will
[1:18:16] fade away
[1:18:18] the trial will fade away
[1:18:21] the this Earthly existence will fade
[1:18:24] away everything will fade away amen but
[1:18:28] that which originated and existed in the
[1:18:30] mind of God before the foundation of the
[1:18:32] world it will never fade away
[1:18:35] I want that to be my reality I want that
[1:18:38] I want all my perspective to be built
[1:18:40] off that reality and if I can get all my
[1:18:42] perspective built off that reality then
[1:18:44] the trial then you talk about overcoming
[1:18:47] trials it's not a strain to overcome
[1:18:49] trials it's a revelation that overcomes
[1:18:51] tries
[1:18:52] you can fly above it because you're an
[1:18:54] eagle but you say I'm an eagle that
[1:18:56] can't cause you to Fly Above It just the
[1:18:58] word eagle
[1:19:01] you say I'm an eagle I'm a Child of God
[1:19:04] saying the words will not bring you
[1:19:07] above your trial
[1:19:10] I mean I know I've said them
[1:19:13] I made bold claims and proclamations and
[1:19:16] declared who I was and I wasn't lying I
[1:19:18] believed it
[1:19:20] but the thing that'll actually lift you
[1:19:21] up is the revelation of who you really
[1:19:23] are and who you've always meant been
[1:19:25] meant to be
[1:19:28] then it puts everything else in
[1:19:29] perspective and it brings everything
[1:19:31] else a little lower
[1:19:36] praise God
[1:19:40] so I'm gonna I'm still haven't finished
[1:19:42] my sentence
[1:19:44] thus the thoughts of God are Eternal
[1:19:46] they are real
[1:19:47] they are not simply like a man with a
[1:19:49] blueprint who is drawn up in which one
[1:19:52] day will be translated into substance
[1:19:54] and form
[1:19:55] but they are already real and eternal
[1:19:58] part of God
[1:20:00] oh can we lock down on that
[1:20:03] listen yeah
[1:20:05] we've got to stay tuned in to what the
[1:20:08] prophet's saying
[1:20:09] because we know other quotes right but
[1:20:11] let's stay tuned in for just a minute
[1:20:14] these thoughts of God they are real
[1:20:16] they are not simply like a man with a
[1:20:19] blueprint
[1:20:20] who has a plan and that plan will
[1:20:23] someday translate in the substance or
[1:20:25] form
[1:20:26] that's not this kind of thought
[1:20:29] because we know other quotes and because
[1:20:31] we have a human existence we think well
[1:20:33] God thought of me he took a picture of
[1:20:35] me for the foundation the world and he
[1:20:36] thought of me and now he's bringing me
[1:20:38] into substance no you were already
[1:20:40] substance
[1:20:43] because the thoughts of God are
[1:20:46] substance
[1:20:47] they are real they are Eternal they are
[1:20:51] substance it's not like oh God had a
[1:20:53] thought of me and one day he'll make me
[1:20:55] real when he thought of you you were
[1:20:56] real that was real
[1:21:00] this is real in another dimension but
[1:21:03] it's a less real than not real
[1:21:05] So when you say one day I mean one day
[1:21:07] God knew that I would come and he would
[1:21:09] sow me into the layout of seeing age and
[1:21:11] I would come for them that's all true
[1:21:12] but that's only speaking of this outer
[1:21:14] man amen but the the inner a sieging of
[1:21:17] God has always been real always been
[1:21:19] substance amen
[1:21:22] not waiting to become substance has
[1:21:24] always been substance
[1:21:28] so it's not like a man with a blueprint
[1:21:30] when God sitting back with his thoughts
[1:21:32] he's not drawing out a plan
[1:21:35] and then working that plan and one day
[1:21:37] what he thought that attribute will one
[1:21:39] day become substance no it was already
[1:21:42] substance and he was declaring how this
[1:21:45] substance will be made manifest not
[1:21:47] become substance
[1:21:50] and in order to make it manifest he
[1:21:53] brings it into another substance
[1:21:57] an Earthly substance a spiritual
[1:21:59] substance whatever substance amen but
[1:22:01] the real genuine substance is God is the
[1:22:04] thought is the attribute is the gene
[1:22:11] praise God
[1:22:13] I don't know about you but this is the
[1:22:15] way I have to start thinking
[1:22:23] in Ephesians
[1:22:24] he says Paul says and to make all men
[1:22:27] see what is the Fellowship of the
[1:22:30] mystery
[1:22:31] which from the beginning of the world
[1:22:33] had been hidden God who created All
[1:22:35] Things by Jesus Christ
[1:22:37] there's a fellowship of this mystery and
[1:22:39] this word Fellowship is not just simply
[1:22:41] like Fellowship like we know that's also
[1:22:43] but but it also means community
[1:22:46] there's been a whole community
[1:22:50] of this mystery
[1:22:53] what is that Community the family of God
[1:22:56] there's a fellowship of this mystery
[1:22:58] which God had hid in him what is that
[1:23:01] mystery that God had hid brother Branham
[1:23:04] tells us in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:23:05] there was one goal one plan one great
[1:23:08] mystery it's Revelation 10 7 The Mystery
[1:23:11] of God Amen that was what's to be
[1:23:13] finished in our day in the mystery of
[1:23:15] God is how God will Express himself
[1:23:20] Amen in all the Bible characters and all
[1:23:23] the Bible has been expressing this
[1:23:26] but Paul the Apostle his ministry was to
[1:23:30] try to make all men see
[1:23:32] what is the fellowship of this mystery
[1:23:37] that God had hid within himself
[1:23:41] listen you're part of that mystery
[1:23:45] that God had hid in his back part of his
[1:23:47] mind from before the foundation of the
[1:23:49] world
[1:23:50] and it wasn't a thought like our thought
[1:23:53] it was substance
[1:23:55] it was a reality
[1:23:57] you say was it a living reality is there
[1:24:00] any other life but God
[1:24:03] it was a living reality because God is
[1:24:07] life the source of life he he is life
[1:24:13] and brother Branham comes on in the
[1:24:15] Samaritan Church age and he says we did
[1:24:18] not become seed by rebirth
[1:24:21] we were seed and therefore were reborn
[1:24:25] for only the elect can be reborn
[1:24:29] because we were seed is the reason we
[1:24:32] could be quickened in non-seed there is
[1:24:34] nothing to Quicken
[1:24:37] amen what's being quicker than you
[1:24:40] something you cannot see
[1:24:43] you cannot take out the seed of God and
[1:24:46] you can't take it in your hand you can't
[1:24:48] find it in an x-ray brother Gardner
[1:24:50] can't find it in any of his devices
[1:24:56] it's invisible
[1:24:57] it's unseen
[1:24:59] but it is the greatest reality of my
[1:25:01] life it is the real part of me it is the
[1:25:04] really real real me
[1:25:06] it is what God really meant to be me
[1:25:08] it's the expression of God that he
[1:25:10] wanted to come in this expression of me
[1:25:11] I don't know how to say it right and
[1:25:14] make it right it's God but it's me it's
[1:25:16] me expressing God it's a portion of God
[1:25:18] to be me I don't know the right way to
[1:25:20] say it all I know is it's the truth and
[1:25:22] there's a faith there's a faith
[1:25:24] substance that tells me it's there
[1:25:26] I can't show it to you amen you can say
[1:25:29] well you can show evidences there's all
[1:25:31] kind of evidences there's there's fruits
[1:25:32] of the spirit there's a there's an
[1:25:34] overcoming life but there's times that I
[1:25:36] can show you false evidence
[1:25:40] and I hate that that's so like I stand
[1:25:42] here in a reproach saying that but if
[1:25:44] you followed me around close enough you
[1:25:45] would find there's times that I speak to
[1:25:47] you evidence of something else
[1:25:52] but that evidence is not the reality the
[1:25:55] reality is what's in my soul that's the
[1:25:58] reality
[1:26:03] you know there's people that can show
[1:26:04] you a true evidence and they're false
[1:26:12] there's people who can show you a false
[1:26:13] evidence in the truth
[1:26:16] what's real is God
[1:26:22] so
[1:26:24] we did not become seed when we were born
[1:26:26] again
[1:26:27] that seeking of God was already laying
[1:26:30] there
[1:26:31] we're only reborn because the spirit of
[1:26:35] God came in contact with that seed
[1:26:39] and the two parts of the Chinese ticket
[1:26:41] came back together
[1:26:43] for Redemption
[1:26:45] they were together before
[1:26:47] they were torn and separated
[1:26:50] but when they come back together that's
[1:26:52] Redemption
[1:26:56] and non-seed
[1:26:58] there was nothing to Quicken
[1:27:00] it's amazing because Brother Bear makes
[1:27:02] some statements that are I mean
[1:27:05] if you think of his day I can think of
[1:27:08] being raised in the Pentecostal church
[1:27:10] so I know all my life what the teaching
[1:27:11] was and I can reflect back and think of
[1:27:14] what it was like in his day when he
[1:27:15] would make a statement like the baptism
[1:27:17] of the Holy Ghost has nothing to do with
[1:27:19] it
[1:27:21] you can have the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:27:22] every day of your life and die and go to
[1:27:24] hell
[1:27:26] and listen the the when I was growing up
[1:27:29] a boy that was blasphemy
[1:27:33] that was contrary to scripture blasphemy
[1:27:36] all these other things
[1:27:38] because of the way it was taught
[1:27:40] but brother random showing that that the
[1:27:44] anointing of God the spirit of God can
[1:27:46] fall
[1:27:47] it can fall on wheat and tears
[1:27:50] it can fall on human beings and they can
[1:27:53] they can feel it they can even express
[1:27:55] the anointing in the spirit Realm
[1:27:58] there can be expressions of that
[1:28:01] anointing falling upon them and the
[1:28:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and it
[1:28:05] could be a true baptism a holy ghost
[1:28:06] upon the spirit amen but there if
[1:28:09] there's no seat there it never goes any
[1:28:11] deeper because there's nothing deeper
[1:28:13] for it to contact it's just in the
[1:28:15] spirit realm and we know this Spirit
[1:28:16] realm has fallen the spirit will go and
[1:28:19] be no more someday but there's got to be
[1:28:21] something real that has to come in
[1:28:23] contact with not something temporal so
[1:28:25] the spirit of God's got to move down
[1:28:27] past the spirit realm into the soul and
[1:28:30] if there is a portion of God if there's
[1:28:32] a matching part of the Chinese ticket
[1:28:34] laying in there then all of a sudden it
[1:28:35] makes contact and it Springs to life
[1:28:43] reality finds reality
[1:28:47] the real touches the real
[1:28:52] remember says what is the new birth
[1:28:55] say what brother and what is the new
[1:28:57] birth it's the revelation of Jesus
[1:28:58] Christ personally to you
[1:29:01] that sounds so simple to say but that's
[1:29:03] an absolutely deep statement
[1:29:08] now you joined a church you shook a hand
[1:29:10] you've done something different you said
[1:29:11] a Creed you promised to live by a code
[1:29:13] of rules but Christ the Bible he is the
[1:29:15] word that was revealed to you and no
[1:29:17] matter what anybody says what takes
[1:29:18] place is Christ Pastor priest whatever
[1:29:20] it might be it's Christ in you that is
[1:29:23] the Revelation that the church was built
[1:29:25] upon what is the New Birth the
[1:29:27] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:29:29] you
[1:29:34] know
[1:29:36] there's so many things
[1:29:39] that we do
[1:29:41] that are right
[1:29:43] but they're not exactly it
[1:29:46] and I know I I that's probably a very
[1:29:48] confusing statement
[1:29:51] but we come to church
[1:29:53] we ought to come to church as part of
[1:29:54] the word I mean even the life of God
[1:29:56] would draw us to come to church
[1:29:58] to be in Fellowship to hear the word to
[1:30:00] fulfill the word and obey the word
[1:30:03] but coming the church is not it
[1:30:08] it's the life on the inside that's it
[1:30:11] that life on the inside brings a
[1:30:13] manifestation of fulfilling the word and
[1:30:15] coming to church and being in fellowship
[1:30:16] and and and and all the things that
[1:30:19] we're told to do
[1:30:22] listen kneeling down and praying is not
[1:30:25] it either
[1:30:27] because the Pharisees prayed
[1:30:32] they prayed for show they made long
[1:30:35] prayers on the corners of the streets to
[1:30:37] be seen of men they prayed
[1:30:40] but it wasn't just the act of praying
[1:30:42] that was it
[1:30:46] it's when there was something on the
[1:30:47] inside that could pray
[1:30:52] I hope you understand what I'm saying
[1:30:55] there's a lot of things we can do that
[1:30:57] are right to do but they're still not it
[1:31:01] we can order our lives and conduct Our
[1:31:04] Lives according to the word and listen
[1:31:06] that can be taught
[1:31:10] I mean I hope that doesn't discourage
[1:31:12] anybody or sound wrong but that can be
[1:31:14] taught
[1:31:15] the Pharisees were teaching it
[1:31:20] Paul claims to have come to that place
[1:31:24] he was taught in the school of Gamaliel
[1:31:26] he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees as
[1:31:28] touching the law blameless
[1:31:31] but he wasn't yet born again
[1:31:33] he had the seed but it hadn't been
[1:31:35] quickened to life yet
[1:31:40] oh praise God
[1:31:42] help me
[1:31:44] in The Invisible Union
[1:31:47] brother bear says well you separated
[1:31:49] from your first Union by spiritual death
[1:31:51] now you were born again or remarried
[1:31:53] again to the new spiritual union of not
[1:31:55] your natural life of the things of the
[1:31:57] world but of eternal life The Germ that
[1:32:00] was in you at the beginning found you
[1:32:05] explain that to me but I said I have no
[1:32:07] idea how to explain that to you I've
[1:32:08] experienced it
[1:32:11] something found me and where did it find
[1:32:14] me it found me in me
[1:32:16] in me was something amen that was laying
[1:32:19] there waiting to be expressed in a
[1:32:20] fuller measure and it had to come in
[1:32:22] contact with the counterpart the life
[1:32:24] had to come to life word come to word
[1:32:25] Eagle to Eagle you understand all of
[1:32:27] this but when I come in contact with the
[1:32:29] reality because only the real could
[1:32:32] bring the real to quickening life
[1:32:36] the false couldn't do it only the real
[1:32:38] because it was real so it had to be
[1:32:41] genuine life come to genuine life
[1:32:43] because it wasn't substitute life
[1:32:48] this is why the the real Union is the
[1:32:51] invisible Union
[1:32:53] the real Union is the invisible Union
[1:32:57] why is the real Union the invisible
[1:32:59] Union because in the origin it was
[1:33:02] invisible
[1:33:04] and in the mind of God it was invisible
[1:33:07] in the origin it's visible and now
[1:33:08] expressed in this life it's back to
[1:33:10] Invisible again what is it it's a
[1:33:13] supernatural a spiritual connection amen
[1:33:15] when life comes to life what was there
[1:33:17] amen is coming back together here
[1:33:21] and only the original life only the
[1:33:24] original word only the real real can
[1:33:28] bring real to quickening life
[1:33:32] that's why it had to be the word for
[1:33:33] your day whatever day you fell in it had
[1:33:35] to be the word for your day that brought
[1:33:37] quickening power to the seed amen
[1:33:39] because it had to be something that was
[1:33:41] real and original to bring something in
[1:33:43] you that was real and dormant to
[1:33:45] quickening life
[1:33:46] The Substitute couldn't do it the only
[1:33:49] the real could
[1:33:51] amen
[1:33:53] praise God
[1:33:55] let's go to John chapter 3.
[1:33:58] I want to read a few scriptures here
[1:34:01] John chapter 3.
[1:34:03] and verse 5.
[1:34:12] this is Jesus speaking with Nicodemus in
[1:34:15] John 3 verse 5. Jesus answered verily
[1:34:18] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[1:34:20] born of water and a spirit he cannot
[1:34:22] enter into the kingdom of God
[1:34:24] that which is born in the flesh is flesh
[1:34:26] and that which is born of spirit is
[1:34:27] Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee
[1:34:30] you must be born again the wind bloweth
[1:34:32] where it listeth and thou hearest the
[1:34:34] sound thereof but cast not tell whence
[1:34:36] it cometh and whether it goeth so is
[1:34:39] everyone that is born of the spirit
[1:34:43] listen I
[1:34:45] was born of the spirit the individual is
[1:34:47] born in the spirit he says is Like the
[1:34:49] Wind
[1:34:51] the wind
[1:34:53] is what he says
[1:34:56] um
[1:34:58] the wind bloweth where it listeth and
[1:35:00] thou Hearst the sound thereof but canst
[1:35:02] not tell whence it cometh and whether it
[1:35:05] goeth
[1:35:07] everybody is born in the spirit is like
[1:35:09] this wind
[1:35:11] you've blown into this dimension
[1:35:17] nobody can see you
[1:35:24] I hope that doesn't stumble you
[1:35:27] if it does I have some quotes we'll read
[1:35:28] in a minute
[1:35:30] you have blown in you have moved like
[1:35:33] the Holy Spirit like the wind you have
[1:35:35] moved into this dimension
[1:35:38] what what you were talking about the
[1:35:40] real real real
[1:35:42] the seed the attribute the gene the life
[1:35:45] the light
[1:35:48] has moved into this life
[1:35:50] it's been born again and quickened alive
[1:35:52] and it's moving through this life and he
[1:35:55] says you can even see the effect of it
[1:35:59] can you see the effect of the Wind
[1:36:01] yeah see them move dust and blow dust
[1:36:03] and move Leaf you've seen the effective
[1:36:05] wind but you've never seen wind
[1:36:08] sometimes when you see the effect of
[1:36:09] when you said look at that wind you
[1:36:11] never saw the wind you saw the effective
[1:36:13] win
[1:36:14] you can see a cloud being pushed by wind
[1:36:16] to this guy and look at that wind look
[1:36:17] how windy it is it's windy but you
[1:36:19] didn't see the wind
[1:36:21] and in this life he that's born in the
[1:36:23] spirit is like the wind amen you've
[1:36:25] blown into this life you're blowing
[1:36:26] through this life there can be an effect
[1:36:28] there can be a shaking of the leaves on
[1:36:30] your tree but nobody has seen you
[1:36:32] because you are invisible
[1:36:34] [Music]
[1:36:37] because before you were ever brought
[1:36:40] into another substance you were the
[1:36:42] original invisible substance before
[1:36:44] there was light even you were there
[1:36:49] praise God
[1:36:52] that's why this bride the children of
[1:36:54] God are a mystery
[1:36:56] they are a mystery
[1:36:58] amen
[1:37:00] brother Ben says in communion
[1:37:02] the last recorded sermon we have he says
[1:37:04] what was it there was another William
[1:37:07] Branham see a little spot of eternal
[1:37:09] life down there from the genes of God
[1:37:11] the word of God that was placed in there
[1:37:15] now what he's talking about he's talking
[1:37:16] about the Real hymn
[1:37:18] the genuine hymn he calls it another
[1:37:20] William Branham I mean that's that's a
[1:37:22] way of expressing his thought
[1:37:24] another William Branham
[1:37:27] a spot of eternal life
[1:37:29] down there the genes of God the word of
[1:37:33] God that was placed there
[1:37:36] so where was the word it was in you
[1:37:40] that's right that's why the word had to
[1:37:42] come to you
[1:37:43] because the word was in you a spot of
[1:37:45] eternal life a gene of God a portion of
[1:37:48] word
[1:37:49] that was placed there
[1:37:53] Amen in the message things that are to
[1:37:55] be says this old Earthly Tabernacle here
[1:37:57] you know what it is this body is like an
[1:38:00] old coat that you wear a coat that you
[1:38:01] once wear
[1:38:03] but now you have one so much better you
[1:38:05] don't use it anymore what do you do you
[1:38:07] hang it in the closet for you've got one
[1:38:08] better you've got a better coat it's
[1:38:11] more up to date than the one you used to
[1:38:12] wear that's worn out what
[1:38:14] it is that garment you are the you are
[1:38:18] the inside of that there
[1:38:20] that garment only done one it bore your
[1:38:23] image but you don't need it anymore now
[1:38:26] you've hung it up it's a rag
[1:38:28] and that's the way this old body is it's
[1:38:30] bore the image of the Heavenly yet it is
[1:38:33] not you you are on the inside of that
[1:38:35] body
[1:38:37] all this helps me so much this is why
[1:38:39] when when when you get tripped up and
[1:38:42] you stumble and you fall and you fail
[1:38:44] Amen brother Bama says you're going to
[1:38:46] make mistakes you're going to make lots
[1:38:48] of mistakes
[1:38:51] remember I said there's traps set for
[1:38:52] you and you're going to fall into them
[1:38:54] so he said you're going to fall into
[1:38:56] them
[1:38:59] but this is not me
[1:39:03] this is only a tabernacle of the Earth
[1:39:06] which is a substance that was made by
[1:39:09] substance that doesn't appear
[1:39:14] that's what this earth is made of
[1:39:16] he made it of things that don't appear
[1:39:19] and now a portion of this Earth that was
[1:39:21] made of things that don't appear was
[1:39:23] brought together to make this body that
[1:39:25] I live in
[1:39:27] but it's not me
[1:39:29] it's a body I live in
[1:39:31] is it expressing me yes
[1:39:34] do you say this is uh my hands they are
[1:39:38] my I can say they're my hands is that a
[1:39:40] wrong statement no these are my hands
[1:39:43] but they say this body's not me this
[1:39:46] body is not the real me and cannot fully
[1:39:48] Express me
[1:39:51] that's why so many times in our worship
[1:39:53] we feel so limited
[1:39:55] I don't know about you but when you
[1:39:56] really want to worship God and talk to
[1:39:58] God and God draws near and you feel his
[1:40:00] presence and it feels like your heart
[1:40:01] will just explode you realize you're
[1:40:04] caged down by this flesh
[1:40:07] that I wish I had a flesh could express
[1:40:10] what's in my heart
[1:40:13] it's not me
[1:40:15] it's not you you're on the inside of
[1:40:17] that body you the spirit of God is on
[1:40:20] the inside of that body
[1:40:22] that's what makes the outside come into
[1:40:24] subjection because the inside is pulling
[1:40:26] it see bringing in line with the word of
[1:40:28] God you're inside you yourself your
[1:40:30] being
[1:40:31] this body is just an old coat and
[1:40:33] someday that will what will you do with
[1:40:35] it for it was only in the Garment for a
[1:40:37] while that is like the Earthly garment
[1:40:39] this body your real body your real self
[1:40:42] is on the inside of this old coat
[1:40:46] amen you mean there's a body down here
[1:40:49] yeah there's a soul brother Ben said
[1:40:50] there's three parts to you you're three
[1:40:52] persons
[1:40:53] one of those is a soul amen that Soul
[1:40:56] that's been regenerated by the baptism
[1:40:58] of the Holy Ghost amen and come alive
[1:41:00] and sprung the life the gene that's
[1:41:01] alive in your soul that's really you
[1:41:06] amen
[1:41:08] so this body is just an old coat and
[1:41:09] someday what will you do with it there's
[1:41:12] only a garment for a while like this
[1:41:14] Earthly garment the body your real body
[1:41:16] your your real self is on the inside of
[1:41:18] this old coat that you call William
[1:41:19] Branham or Susie Jones or whoever it is
[1:41:23] see someday it will hang in the earth of
[1:41:25] Earth's Hall of memory you'll put it out
[1:41:27] yonder in the grave and somebody will
[1:41:29] put a tombstone up here lies Reverend so
[1:41:31] and so or John so and so or so and so
[1:41:33] and it'll lie there a memorial of you
[1:41:36] the people just seen you in this and
[1:41:39] what you was your real you was on the
[1:41:40] inside of that but the old coat itself
[1:41:43] just bore the image of the heavenly
[1:41:47] so when I say when you're born again
[1:41:48] you're like the wind no one's ever seen
[1:41:50] you they haven't ever seen you
[1:41:53] they've only seen this outside vessel
[1:41:55] that declares you
[1:41:57] the real you is invisible
[1:42:01] amen
[1:42:05] the message shalom
[1:42:07] and now he says
[1:42:10] as we die like in the physical body as
[1:42:12] we are now we are separated from one
[1:42:14] another
[1:42:15] but it's really this body is the only
[1:42:17] thing that identifies us to each other
[1:42:19] because we are bound in five senses see
[1:42:22] taste feel smelling here and as long as
[1:42:24] we can see or feel one another why we
[1:42:26] have evidence that we're here if you're
[1:42:28] blind and can't can't see then you can
[1:42:30] feel one another hear one another and
[1:42:32] the Earthly senses declare one another
[1:42:35] but really frankly we have never seen
[1:42:38] each other
[1:42:39] so glad the prophet said that I can say
[1:42:41] it amen you've never really seen me
[1:42:45] but you know I take that back
[1:42:47] because if you were in the mind of God
[1:42:49] and a real thought you probably saw me
[1:42:51] before but it wasn't with eyes like this
[1:42:53] and seeing like we see in the natural
[1:42:56] if you were there we were together amen
[1:43:01] but frankly when we get to this Earthly
[1:43:04] Dimension talking Earthly we really
[1:43:06] frankly we have never seen each other
[1:43:08] did you know that we have never seen one
[1:43:10] another you hear something speaking out
[1:43:12] of a body here that impersonates
[1:43:14] whatever is on the inside
[1:43:17] praise be to God
[1:43:20] amen now
[1:43:22] I'm gonna I'm going to a close and I'm
[1:43:24] going to get into the real heart of what
[1:43:27] I want to say
[1:43:28] I said all of that to get here
[1:43:31] I'm going to go back to a couple older
[1:43:33] messages brother Branham preaches and in
[1:43:34] 1956 he preaches the Intervale
[1:43:37] so no those the Manna fell outside the
[1:43:40] courts and remember the people eat this
[1:43:42] manna but God told them to take up this
[1:43:45] man and put it put a bunch of it back in
[1:43:47] the Holy place and there was the ark the
[1:43:50] ark is a type of the human heart the ark
[1:43:53] the place the hidden place
[1:43:56] so in you is a hidden place
[1:44:01] a hidden place that's the ark
[1:44:03] what was in the ark
[1:44:06] the word
[1:44:08] and there in the ark they would take a
[1:44:10] portion of this manna that was falling
[1:44:12] all over the camp day by day they would
[1:44:14] take a portion of this Manna they would
[1:44:15] put it in a gold pot that represented
[1:44:17] Divinity and they would place it there
[1:44:19] in the ark and there in the Shekinah
[1:44:21] Glory of God it was preserved and fresh
[1:44:23] always
[1:44:24] that right
[1:44:26] but where was it it was in the hidden
[1:44:29] place and the Ark represents the human
[1:44:31] heart
[1:44:32] the ark was also the Throne of God
[1:44:35] where God wanted to dwell between the
[1:44:37] wings of the cherubim and in the ark was
[1:44:40] the word
[1:44:41] if you're a sea Gene of God what was
[1:44:43] Planet what was in your soul when you
[1:44:45] came to this life there was seed Gene of
[1:44:47] God attribute of God word was inside of
[1:44:50] you
[1:44:54] amen
[1:44:56] now
[1:44:59] I want to read several scriptures we're
[1:45:01] going to stay in the New Testament but
[1:45:02] I'm going to read out of you first
[1:45:03] Samuel you don't have to turn there but
[1:45:04] first Samuel 16 6.
[1:45:07] says and it came to pass when they were
[1:45:10] come that he looked on iliab and said
[1:45:12] surely the Lord's anointed is before him
[1:45:15] this is Samuel going to anoint the king
[1:45:18] over Israel and he comes to the house of
[1:45:19] Jesse and the oldest son comes
[1:45:22] and he thought surely this is him
[1:45:25] but the Lord said unto Samuel look not
[1:45:26] on his countenance or on the height of a
[1:45:28] stature because I have refused him for
[1:45:30] the Lord seeth not as a man'seeth for
[1:45:33] man looketh on the outward appearance
[1:45:34] but the Lord looketh on the heart
[1:45:38] question is what is God looking for
[1:45:42] and when it comes to you and I what is
[1:45:44] God looking at
[1:45:47] what's he looking for and where will he
[1:45:50] find it
[1:45:51] will he find it on the outside realm of
[1:45:53] you
[1:45:54] we find in the spirit realm of you
[1:45:57] what is God looking for he's not looking
[1:46:00] for those things that come from the
[1:46:02] outside
[1:46:03] he's looking from that which is buried
[1:46:05] on the inside
[1:46:08] the Lord looketh on the heart
[1:46:11] um
[1:46:12] let's go to Mark we'll look at a couple
[1:46:15] scriptures here in New Testament Mark
[1:46:16] chapter 7.
[1:46:23] Mark chapter 7.
[1:46:31] verse 6.
[1:46:36] he answered and said unto them
[1:46:38] well hath Isaiah prophesied of you
[1:46:40] Hypocrites that it has written this
[1:46:42] people honoreth me with their lips
[1:46:44] but their heart is far from me
[1:46:48] they were so religious
[1:46:50] that with their lips they were declaring
[1:46:53] to be believers
[1:46:55] they were declaring that they honored
[1:46:57] God and honored in his word but down in
[1:47:00] the heart and the Soul it was far
[1:47:02] removed from God
[1:47:05] God wasn't looking to the lips he was
[1:47:07] looking to the heart
[1:47:09] Matthew let's go to Matthew 23.
[1:47:15] Matthew 23 and verse 25.
[1:47:20] Matthew 23 25 he says woe unto you
[1:47:24] scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites if you
[1:47:26] make clean the outside of the cup of the
[1:47:28] platter but within they are full of
[1:47:30] extortion and excess
[1:47:32] Thou blind Pharisee cleanse first that
[1:47:35] which is within the cup and the platter
[1:47:37] that the outside of them may be clean
[1:47:39] also
[1:47:40] woe unto you scribes and Pharisees
[1:47:41] Hypocrites for you are likened to the
[1:47:44] whitest sepulchers which indeed appear
[1:47:45] beautiful outward but are within full of
[1:47:48] dead men's bones and of all uncleanness
[1:47:51] even so you also outwardly appear
[1:47:53] righteous unto men but within you are
[1:47:56] full of hypocrisy and iniquity
[1:48:01] I want you to say that the part God is
[1:48:03] most interested in is inside
[1:48:08] I think sometimes we get
[1:48:11] serving God and the idea of true worship
[1:48:14] and service to God
[1:48:17] I think sometimes we're too outside
[1:48:18] focused
[1:48:22] and in a way we can become secure like
[1:48:24] the Pharisees were secure when they were
[1:48:27] outside focused
[1:48:29] they were children of God they were Seed
[1:48:32] of Abraham because they could receive
[1:48:35] the law of Moses because they could do
[1:48:38] statutes and judgments and orders and
[1:48:41] because they could do that they believed
[1:48:43] that they were Seed of Abraham they were
[1:48:45] part of the promise
[1:48:47] and Jesus confronts them in the Book of
[1:48:49] John and and they they say we you know
[1:48:52] we be Abraham's children and he says I
[1:48:55] know you're Abraham seed
[1:48:58] but you don't do the works of Abraham
[1:49:01] then he says if you were Abraham's seed
[1:49:06] you would believe me
[1:49:11] so now he goes all the way down to Faith
[1:49:14] in the heart and the Seed of Abraham is
[1:49:17] not declared by the outside ordinance
[1:49:19] the Seed of Abraham is declared by faith
[1:49:22] in the soul
[1:49:24] because that faith is a gift and that
[1:49:26] Faith gift comes from the sea Gene of
[1:49:29] God
[1:49:31] so they had a order of religion they had
[1:49:34] an order of worship
[1:49:36] and their order of worship could have
[1:49:39] the heart separated from God but the
[1:49:41] body and I would say even the spirit
[1:49:44] worshiping God
[1:49:46] so they could be engaging God and
[1:49:49] interacting with God In the Flesh and in
[1:49:51] the spirit but their heart could be far
[1:49:54] from God
[1:49:57] and God was not fooled by this kind of
[1:49:59] worship
[1:50:00] in Romans Chapter 2 I'll just read this
[1:50:03] to you as well stay in the Book of
[1:50:05] Matthew Romans chapter 2 verse 28 for he
[1:50:07] is not a Jew which is one outwardly
[1:50:09] Apostle Paul saying this neither is that
[1:50:12] circumcision which is the outward and
[1:50:13] flesh but he is a Jew which is one
[1:50:15] inwardly and circumcision is that of the
[1:50:18] heart in the spirit and not in the
[1:50:20] letter whose praise is not of men but of
[1:50:23] God
[1:50:24] now he's coming down to show who the
[1:50:25] real Jew is
[1:50:27] not the one with the birth certificate
[1:50:29] the real Jew is the one that's one
[1:50:30] inwardly and the circumstances listen
[1:50:33] the Jews had a sign a seal that was
[1:50:35] given to Abraham to seal this Covenant
[1:50:37] they had circumcision physically and
[1:50:39] they could show a physical circumcision
[1:50:41] and say look I'm under the Covenant of
[1:50:43] physical circumcision but Paul's coming
[1:50:45] along and saying that's not it it's not
[1:50:47] anything on the outside but the genuine
[1:50:49] circumcision is invisible
[1:50:52] is not seen your circumcision is not
[1:50:55] something you can show in proof and give
[1:50:57] evidence on under the Covenant your
[1:50:59] circumcision is unseen but I'll tell you
[1:51:02] who can see the Unseen God can see into
[1:51:04] your soul and he knows what's there
[1:51:07] [Music]
[1:51:09] the rest of us can't we can see effects
[1:51:11] we can see the way there's the wind
[1:51:13] moving things we can see evidences amen
[1:51:15] but there's only one who can Pierce
[1:51:17] through all of that through your flesh
[1:51:18] and through your soul and your spirit
[1:51:20] and get all the way down to your soul
[1:51:21] and he can see what's there
[1:51:25] and that's what he's looking for
[1:51:29] there's a scripture actually I do want
[1:51:31] you to turn this one we'll come back to
[1:51:32] Matthew but let's go to First Peter
[1:51:34] this is a strange scripture
[1:51:37] for me to use this way
[1:51:40] first Peter 3.
[1:51:57] all right first Peter 3 and verse 3.
[1:52:01] he's speaking to women to wives
[1:52:04] and he says who's adorning let it not be
[1:52:08] that outward adorning of plating of the
[1:52:10] hair and wearing gold or putting on of
[1:52:12] apparel
[1:52:13] but let it be the hidden man of the
[1:52:15] heart and that which is not corruptable
[1:52:18] even the ornament of a Meek and quiet
[1:52:20] Spirit which in the sight of God is of
[1:52:22] great price for after this manner in the
[1:52:25] old time the holy women also who trusted
[1:52:27] in God Adorn themselves being in
[1:52:29] subjection to their own husbands
[1:52:32] he's speaking to wives how to conduct
[1:52:35] themselves to their husbands
[1:52:37] but also the church is a woman
[1:52:42] we believe she's a married woman
[1:52:45] and so this applies to us as well
[1:52:49] he says
[1:52:51] let your adorning not be the outward
[1:52:54] adorning
[1:52:55] plating the hair and wearing of gold
[1:52:59] into putting on apparel
[1:53:01] but let it be the hidden man of the
[1:53:03] heart
[1:53:04] and which is not which is not
[1:53:06] corruptable
[1:53:08] that the outside all of those things
[1:53:10] will fade away and corrupt
[1:53:12] but the genuine in the soul will be
[1:53:15] eternal
[1:53:18] amen
[1:53:21] even the ornament of a Meek and quiet
[1:53:23] Spirit which is in the sight of God of
[1:53:25] great price he goes on to talk about
[1:53:27] those that were submissive to their
[1:53:28] husbands because we're to be submissive
[1:53:30] to the word
[1:53:32] but as a church
[1:53:35] as all churches
[1:53:37] they begin to move towards outward
[1:53:39] adornment
[1:53:43] to become beautiful
[1:53:46] picture perfect
[1:53:48] is that right this is what churches do
[1:53:51] but he said don't let your adorning be
[1:53:53] of this outward Beauty
[1:53:57] of this outward glamorization
[1:54:01] but let it be the hidden man of the
[1:54:02] hearts
[1:54:04] that's what will make the difference
[1:54:07] it doesn't matter what what we do I
[1:54:10] don't say it doesn't matter it matters
[1:54:11] what we do on the outside but you can
[1:54:13] never overcompensate on the outside
[1:54:15] what's failing on the inside
[1:54:17] you can never make up for it on the
[1:54:19] outside you can never sing loud enough
[1:54:21] to make up for a void in your soul
[1:54:24] you can never pray enough hours to make
[1:54:27] up for for having no new birth and no
[1:54:29] relationship in your soul with God
[1:54:32] there's no substitute
[1:54:35] for the hidden man of the heart
[1:54:38] let's go back to Matthew chapter 6 now
[1:54:53] Matthew chapter 6.
[1:54:59] verse 5.
[1:55:01] and without prayers Thou shalt not be as
[1:55:04] the Hypocrites are for they love to pray
[1:55:06] standing in the synagogues and in the
[1:55:07] corners of the streets that they may be
[1:55:09] seen of men verily I say unto you they
[1:55:11] have their reward
[1:55:14] I want a greater reward than that
[1:55:17] oh he's a great man he's a Godly Man
[1:55:19] look how he prays and look how he serves
[1:55:21] God and brother Jesus is saying that's
[1:55:24] the end of their reward the reputation
[1:55:26] they have on this life they have it
[1:55:28] that's their reward
[1:55:30] but oh I want a greater reward than that
[1:55:32] friends I don't want my reward to end in
[1:55:35] this life
[1:55:37] it goes on to verse 6 but thou when thou
[1:55:40] prayest enter into thy closet
[1:55:43] and when that was shut the door pray to
[1:55:45] thy father which is in secret and the
[1:55:47] father would seeth in secret shall
[1:55:49] reward thee openly
[1:55:52] he's saying how shall you worship God
[1:55:54] how shall you pray how shall you serve
[1:55:56] God Amen not from the outward from the
[1:56:00] n-word amen When you pray don't stand
[1:56:02] and pray now there's nothing wrong with
[1:56:04] praying outside we we pray over our
[1:56:06] meals together we pray at church there's
[1:56:08] nothing wrong with that but it shouldn't
[1:56:10] stop there we've got to go down into our
[1:56:12] closet down into our soul down to where
[1:56:15] he that seeest in secret
[1:56:18] what secret The Secret of your soul The
[1:56:21] Secret of that realm where nobody else
[1:56:23] can get to the privacy of your innermost
[1:56:26] being amen where the ark is amen the
[1:56:29] human heart
[1:56:30] [Music]
[1:56:32] let's go down there
[1:56:35] that
[1:56:36] that is where God is looking amen their
[1:56:39] mouth is this their body is this their
[1:56:42] worship is this their praise is this but
[1:56:44] what where is the the secret I want to
[1:56:47] see into the secret part and I want to
[1:56:49] see what's done secretly
[1:56:52] then the relationship that becomes the
[1:56:54] most important relationship is now the
[1:56:56] secret relationship
[1:56:58] not the public relationship but the
[1:57:00] secret relationship
[1:57:03] a lot of things can be done publicly
[1:57:05] like the Pharisees did
[1:57:07] but they didn't at the end they didn't
[1:57:10] matter for not
[1:57:12] Jesus said your Whited sepulchers full
[1:57:15] of dead men's bones in the inside
[1:57:18] you have your reward
[1:57:20] but oh let it be the hidden man of the
[1:57:22] heart
[1:57:23] let it be that we go into a closet and I
[1:57:27] don't I don't mean you literally can
[1:57:28] only pray in a closet to have this kind
[1:57:30] of relationship but go down privately
[1:57:32] with just you and God Amen it's the
[1:57:35] prayers you pray in your heart that are
[1:57:37] the most meaningful the real the
[1:57:39] relationship you have in secret with God
[1:57:41] is your relationship
[1:57:46] I I hope that you catch what I mean
[1:57:50] we can all have a church relationship
[1:57:52] with God
[1:57:54] where we as a church worship God as a
[1:57:56] church we respect his word as a church
[1:57:59] we keep the order as a church we can do
[1:58:01] it as a family we can children and a
[1:58:03] parent's home they can worship God as a
[1:58:06] family worships God and and they stay in
[1:58:08] respect and honor to the word of God and
[1:58:10] respect and all of that that's that's a
[1:58:12] good form of worship we praise God for
[1:58:14] that but the real worship of God is the
[1:58:17] secret worship of God the way you
[1:58:19] worship God secretly privately in the
[1:58:22] chambers of your innermost being that is
[1:58:24] your worship to God
[1:58:29] that's the one that that's where the
[1:58:31] reality is
[1:58:33] and when the reality comes the reality
[1:58:36] is coming for the reality Within
[1:58:39] so that these two realities make a
[1:58:41] contact
[1:58:42] will that have an effect on the outside
[1:58:44] absolutely
[1:58:46] if it doesn't then we've got some
[1:58:48] questions
[1:58:50] it should change our Behavior it should
[1:58:51] change our conduct it should change our
[1:58:53] address it should change our public
[1:58:55] worship it should change our fellowship
[1:58:56] with one another it should change all of
[1:58:58] that but you can't work on the outside
[1:59:00] and have it affect the inside it must be
[1:59:03] the reality and the secret part of your
[1:59:05] life that's the worship that's the real
[1:59:07] genuine true worship to God
[1:59:12] now I want to finish with this quote I
[1:59:15] want to read this quote because this is
[1:59:16] the one that had so much impact on me
[1:59:20] and the message of the Hidden line from
[1:59:22] 1955.
[1:59:24] said God said Moses make you a gold pot
[1:59:27] Hallelujah and in their place this Manna
[1:59:30] and remember that a Believer when he
[1:59:32] walked in there that Mana never did run
[1:59:35] out he's talking about the Manna in the
[1:59:37] golden pot in the holy of holies
[1:59:40] in the most inner chamber where it was
[1:59:43] never public nothing in that inner
[1:59:45] chamber was public
[1:59:47] everything in that inner chamber was
[1:59:48] private
[1:59:49] hid behind veils it was in secret it was
[1:59:52] a mystery
[1:59:54] the high priest went in there once a
[1:59:56] year amen but nobody could see what was
[1:59:59] happening in that inner chamber it was
[2:00:01] secret it was Private it was beyond the
[2:00:03] vision inside of anybody else
[2:00:05] and in there there was manna that was
[2:00:07] placed in there that was kept fresh and
[2:00:09] could be taken and eaten by the high
[2:00:11] priest
[2:00:12] now he says now remember the believer
[2:00:14] when he walked in there the Mana never
[2:00:16] did run out it was always fresh and new
[2:00:18] and sweet as the day when it went by as
[2:00:21] the years went by
[2:00:23] and any man who comes to Christ and
[2:00:25] hides away and the veil falls behind him
[2:00:28] he's in the presence of almighty God
[2:00:30] eating the Manna day and night
[2:00:33] from one hour to the other it's always
[2:00:35] just as sweet as it was the first day of
[2:00:37] telling telling to your soul that's what
[2:00:40] we need today is get in where the things
[2:00:43] are where in where the things are at not
[2:00:46] stand off and pretend or not stand off
[2:00:49] and act but actually get in there
[2:00:54] now remember
[2:00:56] only Believers only the elect comes into
[2:00:59] that that God has chosen you I believe
[2:01:02] that in Revelation 2 he says he that
[2:01:03] overcometh so it's promised to
[2:01:06] Overcomers
[2:01:07] you said I overcome smoking that ain't
[2:01:10] what he's talking about
[2:01:12] so he's looking that's still the outside
[2:01:13] realm I I quit lying I quit doing this
[2:01:17] that's not what he's talking about
[2:01:20] you said I overcome smoking that ain't
[2:01:22] what he's talking about there's a whole
[2:01:24] lot more goes to Christianity besides
[2:01:26] not smoking cigarettes or drinking
[2:01:27] whiskey
[2:01:29] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[2:01:31] things and he will be my son I will be
[2:01:34] his God and listen I will give him of
[2:01:37] the Hidden manner
[2:01:39] I will hide him away and I will give him
[2:01:42] the hidden things the world on the
[2:01:44] outside of the curtain don't know
[2:01:46] nothing about
[2:01:48] Hallelujah though they eat Manna but
[2:01:51] they don't know about this
[2:01:53] I will give to him the hidden Manna I
[2:01:55] will give him a stone with his name on
[2:01:57] him you get what I mean entering into
[2:01:59] the adoption or the hidden place with
[2:02:01] God
[2:02:03] ministers all of the Gospel don't don't
[2:02:06] care about your denominations and what
[2:02:08] the world thinks but seek to enter into
[2:02:10] the hidden Manna where the full
[2:02:12] revelation of God is make love perfect
[2:02:15] in your heart and you and God and
[2:02:17] everything else is at rest
[2:02:19] let anything come what you may you're
[2:02:21] hidden away what a place to live oh just
[2:02:24] let me abide there as long as the song
[2:02:26] said Let me let me rest beneath the tree
[2:02:29] where the water so freely flows where
[2:02:32] the lamb is the light and the soul of
[2:02:33] the save never die amen sure they eat
[2:02:37] Mana out there but they didn't know
[2:02:39] about this they never been in there have
[2:02:42] you my dear brother don't despise my
[2:02:44] ignorance but I want to ask you
[2:02:46] something Have you ever come to a place
[2:02:48] in life where Christ meant more to you
[2:02:50] than all that arguing you could do about
[2:02:51] your church
[2:02:53] I like that
[2:02:58] amen has Christ meant more to you than
[2:02:59] all the world
[2:03:01] I don't mean from an emotion or a mental
[2:03:03] work of I mean from the depths of your
[2:03:05] heart that something settled in there
[2:03:07] that something's taken place that you
[2:03:09] don't know how it come but you're hid
[2:03:11] away and your whole motive is to serve
[2:03:13] Jesus Christ
[2:03:16] have you entered that place my dear
[2:03:18] brother have you come into that place
[2:03:19] where you don't care what anyone says
[2:03:21] not to go out and act smart but till the
[2:03:24] love of God Is So anchored into you that
[2:03:27] you can't see nothing else your whole
[2:03:29] motive is to do the will of God love for
[2:03:31] everybody flowing free from everywhere
[2:03:35] what a place to live that's the hidden
[2:03:38] place
[2:03:39] that's the place where we go God to come
[2:03:42] to my brethren that's the place where
[2:03:44] God Reveals His secret things that's the
[2:03:46] place where God does the placing and the
[2:03:49] calling
[2:03:51] everybody else is eating manna
[2:03:54] as the man of
[2:03:58] offense but there was a special Manna
[2:03:59] preserved in the Shekinah Glory of God
[2:04:01] and it was reserved for a private
[2:04:04] feasting yes
[2:04:07] yes only when one would enter in into
[2:04:10] the Shekinah Glory got into the most
[2:04:11] holy place where the Ark of God was
[2:04:13] where the word of God was where the
[2:04:15] Manna was fresh amen he could eat this
[2:04:17] manna that never Fades away that means
[2:04:20] this man has kept fresh All Through Time
[2:04:27] they could eat man on day by day
[2:04:30] we could go to church day by day we
[2:04:32] could get pumped up on Wednesday and
[2:04:34] come back on Sunday we can eat Manna we
[2:04:36] can go enjoy it amen but the reality has
[2:04:39] to come where we by ourselves enter into
[2:04:41] this Third Realm we enter into the
[2:04:43] depths of soul in a relationship with
[2:04:46] just God and us and in there is a
[2:04:49] private man and nobody on the outside
[2:04:50] knows about
[2:04:53] where we can Rejoice at the at the
[2:04:55] preaching of the word we can Rejoice at
[2:04:57] the tapes we can Rejoice at all of that
[2:04:59] and we can eat Mana good but there has
[2:05:01] to come a feasting with the King that
[2:05:03] takes place in the depths of our soul
[2:05:05] where he begins to give you a fresh
[2:05:07] Revelation that will never fade away
[2:05:12] that won't fade away when you walk out
[2:05:14] of the sanctuary won't fade away on
[2:05:16] Tuesday when the trial comes won't fade
[2:05:18] away on Thursday but there's a fresh
[2:05:20] Manna in the innermost chamber where you
[2:05:23] can feed on and it's kept fresh all the
[2:05:25] time and what is it it's a revelation
[2:05:29] it's a revelation
[2:05:32] in that place
[2:05:34] it's a revelation of God
[2:05:37] and if it's a revelation of God and if
[2:05:39] it's a full revelation of God
[2:05:41] then it's also a revelation of you
[2:05:48] and in that place
[2:05:51] is the reality
[2:05:57] in
[2:05:58] in the depths of our innermost being in
[2:06:01] the reality
[2:06:03] of the new birth
[2:06:05] when that seed is sprung to life and now
[2:06:08] beginning to take control
[2:06:11] our relationship there is the reality
[2:06:16] because it's the real coming to the real
[2:06:20] now that may Express hourly that may
[2:06:23] come up and come out my mouth
[2:06:25] that may come in my contact that will
[2:06:28] not May that will come into my conduct
[2:06:30] come out of my mouth come out of all of
[2:06:32] that but those are just Expressions
[2:06:34] expressing what happened down here
[2:06:38] the reality is not what happens out here
[2:06:40] the reality is what happens in here
[2:06:43] and what happens out here is a
[2:06:46] reflection amen or a demonstration or an
[2:06:49] expression of what happened down here
[2:06:52] but the reality is what happened down
[2:06:55] here
[2:06:57] that's why a church walk is not going to
[2:06:59] work
[2:07:01] lip service group things group religion
[2:07:05] it's not going to work
[2:07:08] what has to happen is what has always
[2:07:11] been real
[2:07:12] is what is really real
[2:07:15] the attribute of God that was real
[2:07:18] literal expressed in existence with God
[2:07:24] is in the soul of the believer
[2:07:27] and that Springs to life at an encounter
[2:07:30] a meeting with the Living God under the
[2:07:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that life
[2:07:34] on the inside is now a communion with
[2:07:37] you and God
[2:07:40] Amen to where there's things that take
[2:07:43] place in your soul that you cannot
[2:07:46] describe to another human being
[2:07:49] there is a relationship that you have
[2:07:51] with God that is Indescribable that is
[2:07:54] so deep that there's not even words to
[2:07:57] explain what God is doing inside of you
[2:08:00] that is the reality
[2:08:03] that goes beyond flesh that is that is
[2:08:06] the unseen reality
[2:08:09] expressing in this reality
[2:08:12] that's what I'm striving for that's what
[2:08:14] I'm preserving that's what I'm holding
[2:08:15] on to
[2:08:18] have you ever
[2:08:21] have you ever just had
[2:08:24] God
[2:08:26] just sweep down into your soul
[2:08:29] and you just bust out in tears for no
[2:08:32] reason whatsoever
[2:08:34] and you try to explain that to somebody
[2:08:36] what was that
[2:08:38] it was more than emotion it wasn't an
[2:08:40] emotion there was nothing to be
[2:08:41] emotional about
[2:08:44] the ever drawn to you has he ever come
[2:08:46] in has he ever come to you and done
[2:08:48] heart surgery and cut something out of
[2:08:50] your heart
[2:08:52] and you know he just did
[2:08:56] you talk to him
[2:08:57] do you talk to him
[2:09:00] not at prayer time
[2:09:02] but at any time
[2:09:06] is I'll say the way brother bear says it
[2:09:11] have you ever come to a place in life
[2:09:13] where Christ meant more to you than all
[2:09:15] the arguing you could do about your
[2:09:17] church as Christ meant more to you than
[2:09:18] all the world
[2:09:20] I don't mean from some emotion or mental
[2:09:22] work or maybe from the depths of your
[2:09:24] heart that something settled in there
[2:09:26] that's something taking place and you
[2:09:28] don't know how it come but you're hid
[2:09:30] away and your whole motive is to serve
[2:09:32] Jesus Christ
[2:09:34] that's the reality of being a Christian
[2:09:39] everything else is an expression of that
[2:09:41] but that's the hardcore reality
[2:09:45] and I thank God that that's the
[2:09:47] relationship he wants to have with us
[2:09:50] we want God
[2:09:52] wants us
[2:09:53] we love God but you can never love God
[2:09:55] unless he first loved us
[2:09:58] our desire is the reciprocation of his
[2:10:01] desire he wanted us first he came up
[2:10:03] with the plan first he desired us first
[2:10:07] where does this desire come from where
[2:10:09] does life come from it comes from the
[2:10:11] unseen reality of God
[2:10:14] amen but it's real
[2:10:16] it's invisible but it's real it's
[2:10:18] invisible but it's the realest part of
[2:10:20] who I am
[2:10:23] and that's real Christianity
[2:10:27] man let's all Stand Together
[2:10:30] I'm going to finish with this quote
[2:10:33] just want to leave with this thought in
[2:10:35] our mind
[2:10:37] that
[2:10:39] I want the real
[2:10:41] the real I mean the real that come
[2:10:43] before anything else that's real
[2:10:46] the genuine God
[2:10:49] is the real real
[2:10:52] is heaven real yes is Earth real yes but
[2:10:56] all that real came from the real real
[2:10:59] and I want the real real real God
[2:11:04] to be real in my soul and I want my
[2:11:08] relationship to him to be really real
[2:11:12] and I want everything that comes out
[2:11:13] from that to be an expression of real if
[2:11:16] it affects my attitude I want it to be
[2:11:18] real if it affects my dress I want it to
[2:11:21] be real if it affects my relationship I
[2:11:23] want it to be real whatever comes from
[2:11:25] that reality I want to be an expression
[2:11:27] of the real
[2:11:28] for then whatever manifestation it is in
[2:11:31] it'll be a real manifestation of the
[2:11:34] reality
[2:11:36] oh I thank God that this is the hour
[2:11:39] we're living in you realize the union
[2:11:41] has to be an invisible Union
[2:11:44] where we're at now it has to be because
[2:11:46] it's got to go beyond everything that's
[2:11:49] somewhat real
[2:11:51] to strike the really real
[2:11:53] and from there it'll bring every
[2:11:56] expression into place
[2:11:59] and let's bow our heads and pray
[2:12:00] together
[2:12:02] dear heavenly father we thank you Lord
[2:12:06] God I'm so thankful for the hour we live
[2:12:08] in

[2:12:17] Lord help me to move Beyond
[2:12:20] the outside

[2:12:28] looks
[2:12:29] to impress or to prove
[2:12:32] no matter who we impress
[2:12:35] Lord no matter whom
[2:12:37] we prove we're a Christian too
[2:12:40] we can never hide from you
[2:12:43] nor God do we want to hide from you
[2:12:46] on your word exposes us
[2:12:50] we're not living in the age of partial
