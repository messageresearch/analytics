TRANSCRIPT
========================================
brother manam says here some time ago a man met me out here aside I had a Pianist here had a little uh had a little short little skirt and wasn't just exactly I guess just right and the lady had short hair and she was just a babe in this way and she was playing the piano and a man met me out there just tearing me to Pieces said and you're a Pentecostal preacher and let that woman sit up there with short hair and just going on like that everything well I said I think the woman has a good spirit in her I certainly do not agree with that you know I don't agree and he says and I think that any woman now he comes down a little bit later in the quote I think that any woman that's motherly and godly and a sisterly ought to go to such a person and with sweetness of the spirit just sit down and talk to that lady and if she's of God the holy spirit will understand those things and she'll correct herself but when you really quickly condemn her and drive her away you might harm that Young born baby see I wouldn't condemn the person so there brother brandham was even allowing a Woman Who Wasn't dressed right with short hair playing the piano somebody condemned him but he says but she's got a good spirit she's just a babye in the way and I wouldn't condemn her or harm her and then he talks to the man whose wife was playing the piano with makeup and jewelry yeah and he says she's a ha yeah you see the circumstances are totally different and the response is dictated by the circumstances and by the leadership of the Holy Ghost brother bandam didn't want to discourage that newborn babe he wanted her to learn he wanted her to be right but he didn't want to discourage her when the other one was the a minister's wife who had been who knows how long in the church should have known better to everything there is a season and a time a time to speak and a time to refrain from speaking so you just go and figure out when to speak and when to refrain and you let me know how it goes you tell me when to answer a fool according to his folly and then tell me when not to answer a fool according to his father you know what's shameful some of you are in the room right now trying to figure the answer to that question thinking well in this circumstance or give it up just quit just stop and recognize this isn't an intellectual exercise this isn't your experience this is the leadership of the Holy Ghost memorizing scriptures won't solve this problem it's going to take the spirit of God directing our mouths directing our mind moving Us by his Spirit that's the only thing that's going to work brother Bram said in the paman church age said those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them him doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time amen so is God going to work in and through the bride absolutely how's that going to happen she will do only his will
