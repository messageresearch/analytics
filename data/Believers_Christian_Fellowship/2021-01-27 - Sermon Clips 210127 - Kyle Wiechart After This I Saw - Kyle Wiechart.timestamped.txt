[0:00] you know we have right now everybody's
[0:02] fighting for rights remember laodicean
[0:04] church age
[0:05] everybody's got rights we've got social
[0:07] rights
[0:08] we've got economic rights we've got
[0:11] health care rights fighting for school
[0:14] rights right
[0:15] to education all on one aisle the other
[0:18] aisle
[0:19] we've got constitutional rights we've
[0:22] got a bill of rights
[0:23] we've got a right to bear arms we've got
[0:26] lots of rights
[0:28] right is this true a lot of rights on
[0:31] both sides
[0:32] a lot of rights on both sides
[0:35] and then i'm reminded of someone in the
[0:37] bible 2000 years ago who forfeited all
[0:39] his rights
[0:41] to fulfill one purpose and one objective
[0:44] one purpose one objective and if you
[0:46] think about that if you go back in time
[0:48] i'm just not even looking at notes
[0:50] so if you go back in time with me 2 000
[0:52] years ago you had lots of groups of
[0:54] people on the scene at one time
[0:56] you had the politicians you had the
[0:59] political leaders at that time
[1:01] that they were trying to hold things
[1:02] together you'd have herod and the local
[1:04] municipalities there
[1:06] they didn't want the people to get out
[1:07] of hand because they liked their
[1:08] position
[1:09] they wanted to maintain their position
[1:11] and the rights that come with that
[1:12] position
[1:13] then you had the ecumenical leaders that
[1:15] were very comfortable
[1:16] in the status position that they had as
[1:19] the leaders of that day
[1:21] and they didn't want anything to disrupt
[1:23] their position
[1:24] then you even had the disciples who were
[1:27] jockeying for position
[1:29] even the disciples because they weren't
[1:31] even converted yet though they were
[1:33] standing in the presence of the king
[1:34] we're still saying hey who's going to
[1:35] sit on the right and who's going to sit
[1:36] on the left
[1:37] which one among us is the greatest among
[1:39] us we want to know because we want
[1:41] position because with position comes
[1:42] right
[1:44] you know what i mean and all the while
[1:47] there was a little lamb in the presence
[1:49] of the people
[1:50] there was a lamb of god who had
[1:53] the highest level the greatest seat
[1:56] of position he looked down on everything
[2:00] and he forfeited it all gave up
[2:03] all his rights to pay a price for you
[2:07] and me
[2:09] and then my question then comes then
[2:11] today where is the lamb
[2:14] where is the lamb that has rights but
[2:16] forfeits all their rights
[2:18] you forfeit your bill of rights you
[2:19] forfeit your constitutional rights you
[2:21] forfeit your
[2:22] gun rights you for your social social
[2:24] rights you forfeit your economic rights
[2:26] you forfeit all your rights and say not
[2:28] my will be done but god's will be done
[2:31] you know what i mean so i realized that
[2:34] um in me was a lot of things not right
[2:38] and maybe i'm not the only one
[2:42] maybe maybe there was a few of us
[2:45] that were still we've got rights
[2:49] and little did we realize that was the
[2:51] laodicean spirit
[2:53] and it's working on as an antichrist
[2:55] spirit to get you to pull you away from
[2:57] the word
[2:58] and the word is very simple very humble
[3:01] won't shout at you won't yell and it
[3:04] maintains the same
[3:05] and it hides in simplicity the whole
[3:07] time
