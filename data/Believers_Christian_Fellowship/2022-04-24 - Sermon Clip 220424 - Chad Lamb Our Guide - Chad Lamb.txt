TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we can get ourselves on a death walk if we ever leave the leadership of the guide amen if we ever get self-confident self-sufficient if we ever believe that i know the word and i know the message and you can't stop me and i don't need a guide and then you're going to want why wind up right back on a death march and come right back to the same thing and the whole time then you start off again and say it will be different this time i'll pay i'll pay closer attention this time i'll use all my spiritual skills as a believer and you come right back to the same same issue same problem same thing we don't want to get on a death walk how do you prevent a death walk stay with the guide there's only one guy that's the holy ghost and brother benham even began to talk amen he began to explain that god always has a guide for his people and he said he sends a prophet many times as a guy god always has a guide but he says it's the guide in the person he said there was a guide in moses moses wasn't the guy the guide was working through moses brother branham wasn't the guide it was the holy ghost it was the son of man working through a son of man was the guide amen but you still have to recognize where the guide's working amen you have to be attentive and say the guy the guide the holy ghost is working through this ministry amen through this prophet in the end time i'm going to follow that message i'm going to follow that prophet because that's the guide amen but god also works through his fivefold ministry he works through gifts amen and he guides his church it's not the ministry it's the guide we have to be able to recognize the guide so so many people have wanted to go their own way they don't want a prophet because it's too restricting they don't want to fight for ministry because the fivefold ministry has failed hey hey listen the fifo ministries failed and they're going to fail again but it's still god's provided way it doesn't mean that i can now make my own spiritual journey without any kind of guidance with no shepherd at all god is the great shepherd and he works through shepherds god's the great guide and he works through men to be guides and he guides us individually as the spirit that speaks to us and gives us individual leadership and he has to be that kind of guide all the way around for us
