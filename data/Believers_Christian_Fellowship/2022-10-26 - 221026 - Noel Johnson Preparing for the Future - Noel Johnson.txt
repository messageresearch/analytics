Lord to the best of our abilities we tell you how much we love you but Lord let us compare to what we know how much you have loved us because you're willing to leave the Throne of Glory take on human flesh and then die for our sins we can't match that love Lord we express it to the best that we can and we come Lord we've given up Praise of worship coming from our heart and Lord because of that we believe that you will accept it and now Lord we pause that we consider your feet and receive what you'd have for us so Lord take me as your vessel this evening and move me aside Lord I really want the words that are spoken to be the ones that you would have spoken because we're at a different we are at a difficult hour things are going on around us that where we have absolutely no control over but Lord we know that you can control us if we will let you if we will let you to take me Lord this evening move me aside and speak through me the words that you have spoken for I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen while you're standing if you open your Bibles to Philippians the third chapter read verses 9 through 14. basically I put together two sermons tonight I don't know how it'll come out but we'll find out pretty real soon but the subject is preparing for the future and maybe it'll make some sense when we get into it but Paul here writing and he says that I might be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith he said that I might know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering being make informable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already tame either were already perfect but I follow after if that I might apprehend that for which also I'm apprehended of Christ Jesus rather than like I'm not myself to apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth into those things which are before I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus you can be seated when we look at the world situation as it is today nobody knows what's going to happen tomorrow all the economists are telling us that next year our economy is going to go Belly Up and there's no hope for the future and in the world situation that may be true but see we're not of the world we have a higher calling you know Paul when you look at his life here was a man he was a Jew he studied it hard as he possibly could he had the aspiration to become part of the Sanhedrin to sit there and become part of the ruling body of the Jewish of the Jewish religion and he stroved and he stole with everything that he had in him to attain this goal that he had set before himself but on the road to Damascus things changed on the road to Damascus all of a sudden God appeared unto him in a light and Paul recognized that that same was the light that appeared to Moses in the burning bush he realized that's the same light that dwelt between the cherubims and the holiest of holies and so he said Lord who are you he said I'm Jesus and you're persecuting me everything that Paul had studied up to that point in his life changed all of his theology was just blown out of the water so to speak and so all of a sudden there's a new Direction in his life began I look at at the lives that we live see people that graduate from high school some of them graduate from college they have the world in front of them they figure they got the World by the tail and they're going to make something of themselves and then something will happen that all of a sudden will change everything I have I have a nephew he's he's in Berkeley California he was a football player nice big Husky strong guy and uh first time out he got injured oh he'll get a car car accident messed up his his hip bone and he managed to overcome that he managed to work out make himself strong again and then in practice all of a sudden this year all of a sudden he tore the the one of the tendons in his leg and they had to repair that and plus uh another at the discs or something I forget exactly what they call it his whole life has changed he's not in he can't play football I mean he can't do with an injured leg I mean they have a term for that for that muscle or tendon or whatever it is but everything that he had planned for life all of a sudden now it's taken a turn for him there's other people that we look to and we listen to and I know I was in the hospital lab for a number of years and we would do the the companies would contract with us and we would do a series of of blood tests on the people and also maybe going through somebody and this guy's probably in his mid-30s or something like that we find out he's got leukemia he had no knowledge of that somebody shows up to work on Monday morning they would call him into the office and says we got bad news for you you got six months to live his whole his whole life has been changed upside down we'll see in some ways this was Paul he was here here he had his his world his his he had his future set ahead of him he had plans for the future there was gold he had set for himself but all of a sudden God says I have a different goal for you he says I have called you to be a man I have called you to be the the the the the the Apostle to the Gentiles I have called you for a specific purpose and and and because of the calling God had placed on him from that point on that's what the direction of life that he took and Paul never deviated from that calling I mean he said I count on myself to apprehend it but this one thing I do forgetting everything that's behind me and reaching forth into those things which are before I pressed towards the mark for the Prius of the High Calling God had called me for a purpose and he says I aim to fulfill everything that is within me to fulfill the purpose to which God has called me like I said we look at the world the world doesn't give us a whole lot of Hope in the next next few years we we like I said we have no idea what tomorrow will bring but you know God sent a prophet to this generation that Prophet came with a message to the bride and he was trying to tell the bride Who We Are he's trying to tell us you're not part of this world you have a higher calling than what this world can offer you and so what we need to do is find the purpose for which God has apprehended us we have to find the reason why God has called us we have to find the reason why he has saved us and then we need to change our Focus not into the things of the world in our business dealings and our education all the things that go with it but we have to change our Focus to to achieve that for which God has called us to brother Brown says we're called to come to adoption now that that's that's something where your word is the same as God himself speaking that is what is before the bride that is our predestination that is that is our calling that is what God has called us to become but if we don't focus on that as a goal then we will focus on other things in our life we'll focus on our business we'll focus on this and that and the other thing and all of a sudden the purpose for which God has called us all of a sudden that'll be pushed aside and and we will never strive to achieve that particular goal because to achieve that goal we have to die to ourself we have to take ourselves and lay ourselves aside our future our plans and everything about us we have to be willing to lay all of that aside so that we might apprehend that for which God has apprehended us for I know my younger brother about three years ago he was going to he was willing to work until he was three or four more years he wanted to build up some more money so when he got into retirement he had plenty of money set in the bank and he could do something then he had a heart attack he managed his wife managed to get him to the emergency room five minutes after he entered the emergency room they had him on the table and they put a stint in his heart that saved his life a couple three months later all of a sudden my brother he had no energy I mean he could get through maybe he saw one song service standing up or maybe one stands of us and they have to sit he couldn't even walk out to the mailbox and get the mail because he had no more energy but all of a sudden God spoke to his heart and says raise your hands and praise me so he did and all of a sudden he felt strength coming into his body and when he saw the doctor the following week the doctor says I don't know what's happened to you but he says your heart's perfectly normal he has three stints in his heart okay and he has to watch what he eats and has to watch what he does I mean you know it's not like he can sit there and run run the marathons now but still God had called him for a purpose that he had never planned on his thought of standing behind a group of people and preaching the gospel is the furthest thing from his mind but now in Tucson Tabernacle he preaches generally twice a month sometimes even more depending upon the situations which is there but there but but here again like I say that heart attack changed his life and all of a sudden now he's strawed off in a totally different direction than he ever thought he would go but see that was God's purpose God had him have the heart attack to change his his Direction in his life so God could use him for what God had called him to be you know Paul he asked the question in Romans 8. he said and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that race of Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit that dwelleth in you Paul is trying to say if Christ lives in you then there has to be a change in your life when we accept Jesus Christ as our savior and we go through water baptism what are we declaring I have died to myself I have died to my future I have died to everything that I ever ever had hopes of or desires to and now I'm dedicating my life solely unto the service of God and then we go back into the world and we begin to just do the things we normally do but yeah we had to have we ever that we ever thought about the commitment that we made when we went into the into the baptismal Waters did we ever realize the commitment that we were making I know we had one lady at our at our church and she said oh I got baptized last week I said that's good I said realize this is the beginning of a journey this is the beginning of a change in your life because now you have made a commitment to Jesus Christ and now there's now now God is wanting to fulfill something in in your life but Paul goes on in here and he says for we have not received the spirit of adoption the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father we didn't receive a spirit of bondage Jesus Christ never gave us laws he never said all right now this is what I'm expecting of you to do thou shall not shall not shall not shall not shall not no he says if you love me you'll do what I've asked and so everything that we do is based upon our love for Jesus Christ we read our Bibles why because it's a love letter to us We Gather ourselves together as a congregation why because we love to gather together with others of like Precious Faith so we can take can lift our voices and praise and adoration to the one that we claim to love we claim he is our bridegroom and we are his bride and we are preparing ourselves for the wedding supper we are preparing ourselves for the union between the between us and between him and I'm obviously not a woman but I've observed what other ones do when they get close to the time of the marriage they are more concerned with the with the wedding they're more concerned with their gown they're more concerned with the the whether the the the other attendance and stuff like that whether they're dressed properly and everything's in order her whole focus is that moment when she was stand before the groom and commit her life to him but see what are we doing he is the bridegroom we we claim to be his bride we are at the end of all things the future there we have no we have we do not we have no idea what the future will bring but yet we have somebody who has claimed that he loves us we have somebody who died on a cross for us we have someone who allowed Stripes to be laid on his back so we could we could we could be healed he'll he he made it so if we can enter into his presence we can be at peace and we can be at rest realizing that he is the one in control of all things I mean I I'm in I'm interested in keeping abreast of what's going on in Washington not that what we do have makes it much of a difference in many regards but yet God will put in who he wants and he will take out who he does not want you mentioned that I think in in the Book of Daniel God will why do we have the guy we have in as president now God put him there why because this nation has to fall he has to be there so that we so that he can fulfill God's will for this country and he's doing an excellent job of it but he goes on which we have received a spirit of adoption we have something in us that tells us we are going to be a manifestation of God himself we have something inside of us that we will yield to the spirit of God in us we will literally become God in human flesh in this in in this in this plan in this earth because that's we the Bible says we are predestined to be conformed to the very image of his son we are to be like him in every aspect of his life and so and so the the gentleness the patience the meekness and all the other attributes that we claim to have Jesus Christ that should be beginning to be manifest in our lives because that's his spirit you know it says for God so loved the world he gave and you're always giving he never takes he's always giving you have need of healing he will give you that freely you have neither finances he will give you that freely you have needed healing he will give you that he already purchased it for you all you have to do is believe what he has said in his word and accept what his word says and if you can believe what he has said in his word God will perform whatever you hit whatever promise you access he said the spirit bear bears with it was our spirit that we are the children of God and if children wear heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs which with Christ if so be that we suffer with him we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present timer and are worthy to be compared with the glory that's going to be revealed in US so we have to realize what God has called us too we have to realize he has a purpose for the lives that we live we have to realize that the world is going to the world is is in in turmoils they have no answers to satisfy to even begin to answer the questions what's going on within the world but see God has called us to a higher calling if we can under he said he said he said the the things that we suffer here is not even worthy to be compared to that which we are going to become we are going to rule and reign with Christ for a thousand years everything is going to be subject to us because we will go back to like the Eden condition we'll go back to be able to controlling nature we'll be able to go back to to satisfying the needs of and taking care of the situations around us we will be at we will be God will so come and dwell in us and until he will change our bodies into a glorified State when I will never you know I'll have my hair and I won't be so fat you know you know everything will look nice again but also but I will be able I will be able I will be able to experience something that I am unable to experience in this flesh because I there's never be sickness there'll never be pain you'll never be tiredness and all of a sudden I can begin to enjoy and right now my flesh hinders My Worship to God because there are things that I would like to do and my body says I'm too tired and so I have to try and overcome that and sometimes the bodies with the body is six age but every now and I tell it no we're gonna we're gonna do this week whether you like it or not but here again but at that time there won't be a problem I'll have free access to the one who died for me I would have free actions I can talk with him I can commune with him you know no matter what the situation no matter what the problems are he will be there I can commune with him I can talk with him and there's no hindrance because there'll be no sin and goes on Paul in his writing he said he talks about their Keisha was made subject to Fantasy not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself shall also be delivered from the bondage of corruption unto the Glorious Liberties of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth and prevaileth and pain until now and not only they but ourselves which have the first roots of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption toward the redemptions of our body when all of a sudden Jesus Christ returns to take his body home of which I'm apart all of a sudden my Redemption will be complete my body will be changed back to 20 years old and and and all there won't be any sickness no more pain and no more suffering nothing like that and all of a sudden I will be able to begin to experience what it really is to be a Son of God to be able to realize I rule over nature to me a lies I rule over over the the Earth because that God had given Adam Adam that right that privilege brother random with God who is rich in Mercy makes a statement he says I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and this scare you know you don't know who you are you're not going to be but now you are the sons of God so you always were sons of God but see we pull back from that we refuse to accept the fact that what God says that we are we are Sons and Daughters of God and having being a son and daughter of God there are certain privileges which go with it I mean you look people get high up in government well there's privileges with going with that you can you can commit murder and get away with it you know you can embezzle people and they won't even prosecute you anymore okay unless you happen to be a republican but anyway but we have to begin to realize because you because you belong in certain families there are certain privileges which goes along to being deaf I know the the the what the queen died now there's a new king there in England and all of a sudden he's taking the different members of his family and he's promoting them to different levels of authority and power with it within within the dynasty there's privileges with going with that but there's privileges with being sons of God do we realize what we possess because of the cross if somebody is sick we have the right we have the we have the privilege because of Calvary to take that sickness and to cast it out and then if we can believe it that's exactly what's going to happen I know my wife a couple weeks ago she had this terrible terrible cough so she was nice enough to go into the front room so she could there hopefully I'd get some sleep but anyway she was coughing so bad that I couldn't even sleep so I got out of bed I came over to where she was I put my hand on her and I said Satan I'm tired of you disturbing my sleep I'm tired of you causing this cough get out of here I was nice to him at all I gave a command the coughing stopped she got some sleep I got some sleep and everything went well but we have the right but we fail to exercise that right and it's simple be virtue of who you are you have authority over Satan we are Kings and Priests we rule over Satan's kingdom because Satan is subservient to us because God is we have that right and we have we're a priest if somebody has the need you can go ahead and you can pray for that person you can intercede for that you don't always have to bother the pastor you have the authority exercise it and you'll be surprised that God will actually honor your prayers as much as he will the pastor's prayer I know we were in the other some people came up to me and the ladies were having problems getting getting pregnant now oh what I pray for them is no so I called my wife over it'll work for her and everyone she prayed for in India they all got pregnant and they all started having babies okay it wasn't the pastor that prayed it was my wife that prayed she worked in labor and delivery and then all of a sudden the baby the woman was giving birth to a child and all of a sudden the nurse came out and they were trying to get this that and the other and because there was a problem and my wife sensed what was going on she started praying and all of a sudden whatever the problem was the baby turned or whatever the thing had to be and then there was a normal birth and they would come over to her and look it says you've been praying again haven't you but why not why are we here we are here to take the god that we serve and glorify him in the eyes of the people not to make a big name for ourselves not to go around and put be you know big letters and look at who I am I am a Christian come to me I'll answer all your you know no that has nothing to do with it no in quietness and meekness what she went ahead and she prayed for these women they were having babies and all of a sudden the baby would sit there and the baby would turn or whatever the situation was and all of a sudden she'd have a normal delivery and she didn't go around look at me look at I prayed for him isn't everything great now is he just quiet making us she just did it but see that that's how God operates when you listen to brother Brown when he's casting somebody out he doesn't jump up and down and scream and shout no he knows who he was he knew the authority that he had by virtue of the office that he held and he may have looked at that demon and said you have no rights to this child leave and that Spirit had to obey because he knew who he was and they had to honor his requests Jesus knew who he was and therefore the things he prayed they happened once you begin to realize who you are and you realize you are a son and a daughter of God and by the purchase and you are the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ and by you sitting there and entering into what God has said that you are you can pray for somebody else and you can intercede on their behalf and if there's a demon problem you have the power within yourself because it's God dwelling inside of you you have the right and the power to speak to that demon and have it leave one can chase a thousand you can chase ten thousand so get somebody else to help you but it's that simple we make it complicated and it's not brother random in in uh in this morning church age he says he is a now here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifested in the son in Jesus and in Jesus throughout all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifested in flesh and thereby gained the title of son then he goes and brings us into the same thing he says just as Jesus Christ was made was declared to be a son even so we because we are Eternal and his thoughts so at our turn became the many members spoken word seen manifest In the Flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are also called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seated and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn that's who we are but we have to accept this I mean really it comes down to you actually believe what it says you are do are we willing to accept what brother Branham what God spoke to us through him says that we are because until you're willing to accept what God says that you are you're just going to Fumble around and fumble around and nothing will change in your life you know brother Bradham when you look at his life he was born a prophet he was born a son of God but God had to take him he had to accept Christ as his savior before God could even begin to work through him but then he began God was showing him in visions and in dreams and he was going through the Bible and the Bible says this is how God speaks to prophets envisions and in dreams therefore brother Brown had to make the Assumption I am a prophet based on that scripture and so he was willing to step into that office then later on he had the discernment of that God had given to him and he went through the scriptures well this is the same thing that happened to Abraham when Abraham and when Sarah doubted and he said this is the revelation of the son of man so he had to believe that it was the son of man operating through him and is willing to accept that and step into that in 1960 when Kennedy was was was elected president he said oh he says my Visions are being fulfilled and so he's preached the church ages after that and and 61 in January the Angels spoke to him and says now you read Malachi 4. then he began to realize I am the Messenger to this age and then when he gets into the opening of the seals is I no longer call you church I call you bride he said there's been a message that's been given to me and I must be faithful to that and from that point on he never deviated but he had to be willing to step in each of those offices that God had called him to become we have been called to become Sons and Daughters of God we have been called to rule Satan's kingdom we have been called to to pray for the sick and raise the dead and cast out demons that's what our calling but we have to be willing to step into that office we have to be willing to step into that position and believe that that God will answer our prayers not because of who we are but because of who he he is because because of what because of Calvary everything that Adam lost as a result of the Fall now is available to us all of heaven we have access to everything that heaven is so that God could fulfill his word through us brother Branham Christ the ministry of God revealed he says it's a revelation it's an it says Eternal is God's word is eternal look but the threefold purpose of God's great mystery is revealed God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church in order to redeem the Lost Eve back to the original condition in the Garden of Eden when you look at Adam and Eve Eve was always a part of Adam after the sin in fact and after the fall that's when she got the name Eve before that she was Adam living in two bodies well we're going back to before the fall whereas no longer God will not look at us as a bunch of individuals no this is Christ in a many-membered body but it's always going to be Christ because that's who we are that's what we are a part of and this is where he's trying to get us back to but we have to be willing to understand that we have to reveal into grass have I got a full understanding no I have a difficulty wrapping my brain around the fact that I am part of deity because that's what it's telling me I am a manifestation of God himself okay I I have it up here but I don't have the Revelation that'll come as all these other Revelations have come that'll come also in God's timing all of a sudden he'll open it up he'll and and it'll go from here down into my heart and all of a sudden the revelation will be there and then I can fully step into what God has called me to be in in in in that regard thank you brother Bannerman hear ye him now then you have the word of God the authority of God and then as God shows you what to do you're led by the spirit and you do the things that's pleasing to God so God it was training okay now Jesus was being adopted on the day of Mount Transfiguration God was adopting his own son into his family now now he took Peter James and John and he took Moses and and Elisha and Jesus and he brought them up to the top of the mountain and there you notice he was trying to figure before them what was it in the Republic place at a high mountain can you see the similarity this was six months Jesus was taken up with the amount of transfigure and six months before he was crucified for the three years from the time that Jesus was baptized by John and Jordan it took for those three years of his ministry God Tried Him what will you do with the power that you possess because by virtue of Who You Are because he knew that he whatever he spoke that's exactly what would happen and that's what Satan tried him if you claim to be this under God you're hungry take these dollars make them into bread this was a Temptation and Jesus says oh no he says man shall not live by bread alone but by every but by just by every word of God he took him up to the Pinnacle of Temple cast yourself down glorify yourself in the eyes of the people he says you don't tempt God bypass the cross I'll give you all the kingdoms you'll never have to suffer you'll never have to go to the Cross they'll give it to you freely just worship me and Satan says no no I'll get it I'll get it I'll pay the price so that I can redeem that which is a part of me from the beginning you know in mom and Gilead brother Brandon makes a statement he said now the one thing we have to move up to now is supreme faith to what we've had something he says you cannot have that Faith until you know perfectly what you're doing when you understand like you walk up and say well I'm going home I'm going out to the start the car it's all an act of Faith tomorrow I will meet you at a certain place that's all an act of Faith because you've done it so much because it's a regular routine with you well that's the way the things of God are you you after you have been trust after you have trusted him and walked with and watched him do so many things till it becomes just a regular routine and that's the condition I think the church will be in just before the coming of the Lord so the Rapture will just go right on that way it'll just be a regular routine of following the scriptures in the plan of God but it's coming it's merely a matter of it's merely a matter of coming to a place where you trust him I did a study on Havoc about three years ago I guess now and that changed my whole concept of faith and what God's expecting the faith that it talked the faith that God was asking habakkuk to have he says I want you to put absolute trust in me I don't want you to worry about tomorrow I don't want you to worry about the future I want you to trust me so much that you'll trust me regardless of what happens you take a little infant entrusts its mother because Mommy feeds it Mama close it Mama bathes it because it's helpless it's totally dependent upon its mother but see that's what God is wanting us to become he wants us to become totally dependent upon him for all things and he told Havoc basically if you will trust me to that degree he says from that point on he said I will watch over you I will take care of you and no harm will come your way and so I was reading that I said well Lord okay if that's what you're trying to have habit could do take my hand and don't ever let go and I will trust you wherever you send me and from that point on I've been at rest there's no more a struggle what should I do where should I go you know with this because all of a sudden you get up in the morning you have your day planned and all of a sudden the phone call coming up well I guess we're going to do something else today and say well Lord obviously you had a different plan for today um what do you want me to do what do you want us to do but see I have to come to the place where I was willing to take my life in its totality and give it to God and says from here on out you take control you're the driver I'm the passenger I will go wherever you take me and since I have done that I'm at rest I'm no longer frustrated I'm no longer striving to become because I cannot become what God wanted me to become he has to do the change inside of me it's God that worketh in you to do willing to do of his own good pleasure you are not becoming what you you cannot become what he wants you to become you have to let him make the change in your life so that you can become what he wants you to be and later see in church age brother Banner makes a statement he says now but he's standing in the midst of the church as he stands are revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another Creations has to do with the church it's a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride God created you Just the Way You Are warts and all all of your mistakes all your problems all your frustrations your attributes if you have any all of a sudden God gave them to you because he has a reason for that because he wants to use you in this age because he wants to glorify himself through you and that's why he molds you to be and make you to be what what he has he goes on in here and says what was Jesus Christ he was a God man he was the son of God he was of the new creation man and God met and joined he was the first of a new race and he is the head of that race this new creation is where God and man Unite before I was part of the world's creation I'm not anymore there's nothing out there that I have any desire for I mean I look at it going on I look at the things going on and makes me sick so I'm I'm of a different creation I'm I'm I I'm I'm in it from a different planet okay if you will my wife and I say yeah we we have we live in a bubble and what we do is wherever we go we carry our bubble with us but then when we go to the grocery store we talk nice to them they always say hi how are you I'm doing great how are you doing uh oh yeah are you having a good day well yeah I guess I am well that's good you know when you little car I'm inviting them into my bubble I want them to experience the peace and the joy and the long suffering that I have experienced I want them to meet the God that I serve I want them to meet the god that changed my life I want to introduce them to something which is greater than themselves we're no longer do they have to struggle with the rest of the world but now all of a sudden I can show them something which is totally beyond their comprehension so I invite them into my bubble I'm not interested in getting into theirs but you understand my wife and I are part of a old folks elderly choir whatever you call it and uh you have to be a 65 or older you know some of the younger ones that were trying to get into and well yeah okay we'll let she had there's seven different denominations represented sometimes as many as 40 people are there I mean there's Jehovah Witness or seven-day Adventists there's methodists they're they're uh Presbyterian there there's uh I I don't know all of them but we all have one thing in common we love Jesus Christ and we come together for the sole purpose of praising our God and they they play all the old songs that we like and so we enter into them we sing song and we've seen miracles this one lady was testifying see she was she had no more money and she was she was real low on gas and she drove for a whole week on less than a quarter tank of gas which at the end of the week was over and she finally got paid she still had less than a quarter tank she had not used any gas in a week and she driven a few couple hundred miles God supplied there have been other people who had kidney cancer God healed him other people have had other diseases or other prayer requests we've prayed for other people in there and we've seen God undertake for them they're walking in the light they have and so what we're doing we are trying to take the light that we have and we're trying to shine it to them so that if there is seed there they will come and if not they will if not God will judge them according to what they know so we don't discuss Doctrine if they ask fine we don't push it but they know what church we go to they know a lot of the people that go to our church they know we're missionaries to India and they love us and they respected we're going to be gone for a cup for gone for a couple weeks we're going so much in such a place oh we'll remember you in prayer and so every time they get together they remember us I mean there's a love relationship that all of us possess in that group and we we value that brother brother Adam goes on here there you can see that though man was of the old order or Creation in Union with Christ he has become a new the new creation of God this new creation is not the old creation made over or could not be called a New Creations exactly what is it is a new creation it's another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue through Godly Isaac Jacob uh I Godly Isaac Klein but now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has purposed a new creation he was the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation God is creating himself in you you wonder what's going on in your life there's something going on God has worked god let's see God works in you is willing to do of his own good pleasure so he's taking you from the inside into beginning to mold your character until you can come to adoption until you can go and and after the Rapture we can go back to the eating condition we can become what God intended for us to be from the beginning but he has to mold our character we we have to have the character of Jesus Christ because their dwells within us the power to speak and whenever we speak it'll happen but if you don't have the character of Christ what would you do with that power if I was going through Atlanta on a bad day there'd be a lot fewer drivers I'd speak him out of existence but see that's using it wrong so now I find a way around I take by roads and go as far away from her land as I can but anyway but but you have to understand but if I had the power of the spoken word how would I use it but there was a time that my wife and I we were in India and I'm I tend to be very punctual I like being on time we were driving to have a meeting we were already two hours late I was mad I was frustrated and so we get we're driving into the village and all of a sudden this guy stands in front of the car waving his hands emergency pray emergency pray I figured great and we're already late now what I I'm telling you that for a reason they took us down an Alleyway and on the Last House on the Left we walked in there and there's this young lady probably I would put late 20s maybe that her husband had died and both of her children had died and some minister told her she had an evil Wicked spirit and in order to get rid of that Spirit you have to fast for 40 days and 40 nights they don't have that they don't have enough muscle mass they didn't have enough energy they don't have enough enough fat for if it's stored to be able to sustain them unless God's calling that but she was obedient and it got to the place where her all of her systems were starting to shut down her kidneys and and the rest of it they took her to the hospital the hospital looked at her situation says she's Beyond hope there's nothing Medical Science can do for her she's she's dying and I looked at the situation all of a sudden I just looked at it and the words that came out of my mouth it says God don't look at this don't look at the stupidity of the ACT but look at the sincerity of her heart and give her her life back and God honored that even when I was in a bad mood you don't have to be you know up in the heavenlies you don't have to be riding above everything and everything is going just wonderful in every Rosie with you and our you know every all the bills are paid and the car is full of refrigerators packed and no even when you're at the lowest God will use you if you will let him because he needs of he needs a mouth that he can speak through and sometimes they'll Choose You so don't look at your condition look at the analyze the situation says well Lord why am I here and he'll say yeah I'm you you're there because I want to glorify myself through you and then he will use you so brother Branham goes on and this this he says he said this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose the purpose took form through it through election that is why he could look right down through the last age then all it would be over and see himself there in the midst of the church as the author of this new creation of God his Sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this CR this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of sons according to the good pleasure of his will and by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass it doesn't tell us talk us about us doing anything it's talking about God he has a bride and he's going to take that bride and he's going to mold him and he's going to make them into the into the image of of himself so that he can glorify himself in this generation because we will be the final voice to the final Aid we'll be the final manifestation of God to this earth before he takes us out off this planet but he has to get us into the position where we trust him we'll be willing to take our lives and literally put our lives into his hands and says Lord here I am use me and regardless of what happens tomorrow regardless of what happens in the election regardless of anything else that's going on we have a calling higher than what this world can even begin to comprehend because we are a part of God and God is wanting to take us and he wants to manifest himself through us and all we have to do is yield that's all we have to do so Lord here I am use me Revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished we are that mystery we are the mystery of God so dwelling in sinful flesh that God can take that sinful flesh and he can use it and glorify himself through it he goes on he says in our voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again says go and take the little book which is open in the hands of the Angel and standeth upon the scene upon the Earth and he went unto the angel and said give me the little book he said unto me take it and eat it and so make make thy belly bitter but in their mouth it'll be sweet as honey the angel was telling John you and the word have to unite you and the word have to be one how do you how do we become one with the word you listen to the God was telling us through the prophet you get into your Bible you read it every day you get into the tapes and you listen to those or the CDs or however you guys have it stored you begin to listen to them and so God through that can begin to tell you who you are and what you are and begin and and you can watch God in your life as God has supplied for you and healed you and done miracles in your lives and as you become familiar with him doing that for you then when all of a sudden somebody else has a need all of a sudden you can well Lord you you healed me and you're no respect to persons Lord Heal this one Lord Supply this need here Lord give this one what they have need of here and and God through us can speak his word through us without us realizing what that's what he is doing in Romans 8 15 it says we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption worldwide whereby we cry Abba Father we recognize God is our father my parents gave me this body I live in but this is not the real me the real me is my theophany and my etheophony is trying to tell me come up higher get a little higher you know uh what Revelations 4 1 come up higher I got things I want to show you that's what God did through the prophet he has come up higher get out of the church ages get out of the denominational system get out of thinking like a denomination get out of get out of the hindrance that this world placed upon you come up higher I have something I want to show you your sons and daughters of God you're a part of God from the beginning and now God has wanted to manifest himself through you this is who you are this is what you are the book's been open to the bride do we understand it all no don't have to understand it just believe it but if we can understand who we are God is my father and if God is my father there are certain privileges that go with that you know when I was when I was young I got in an argument with another kid uh another little kid I didn't want to fight him he didn't want to fight me but it wasn't my daddy can beat up your daddy no my daddy is bigger than your daddy my daddy can beat up your daddy and so we argued back and forth and then we went home hey Dad you're gonna have to fight this kid's father well my dad can do anything I mean you do take a five-year-old kid he looks at his father my father is invincible my father's Almighty my father has the brains of the world my dad can do anything because he's my father well my father As I Grew Older I found out actually my dad was limited a little bit here and there okay but my real father God he has no limitations Satan bothering me hey Dad can you do something with this guy I'm getting tired of him bothering me all the time he just give me a Thousand Angels should do just come on you know just give me those and we'll take care of this I'm making it funny but I'm using it to make a point we have access to everything God is we have at brother Branham said that God will God will bankrupt Heaven before he'll let one of his promises fall so why don't we access him why don't we treat him like he is our father why don't we love him the way that he desires for us to love him when somebody asks Jesus Christ is what's the greatest of The Commandments is to love God with everything that's within you and then love your neighbor the same way you love yourself and these two Commandments the rest of us all the laws and all the prophets and if we can begin to honor if we could begin to believe in that God you know God came down on Mount Sinai lightning thundering earthquakes Moses told the people God delivered you from Egypt because he loved you but they took back in fear oh wow they look at this thing what are we going to do now if I walk in there God's going to smite me I'll just be as greasy spot when really if they realize that God loved them enough to deliver them from Egypt that God is the one that's applied all their needs as they wander through the Wilderness that God promised to give you the promised land that God has promised to deliver you and take care of you and supply all of your needs that got us promised to heal you who can stand before that that's my God okay manifest yourself a little bit more let's take care of this mess out here because he's my father if all of a sudden somebody was beating if somebody was bothering me my dad would come to my rescue if somebody was messing with my wife I would die trying to take you know making sure that Sushi stayed safe well I'm his bride he loves me I don't know why but he does but here again what's he going to do he's going to protect me he's going to supply for me he's going to watch over me he's going to make sure that everything goes as good as it possibly can because he not only is my father he's also the bridegroom brother Branham goes on your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing when you were born again in John 1 17 I believe he says when we were born of the spirit of God we were the sons of God but we were predestinated now here's what I'm trying to get to you for his sons of this last day see we were predestinated unto adoption this is the goal that is set before us this is what we should be striving to attain to this is our future the what's going on in the world is not our future no this is our future adoption coming into the fullness of the manifestation of Christ he said brother Brown goes on in an adoption part too he says now when the father of the Old Testament understood that that his son was was was come of Age and and had to be seasoned out into adoption he said they're born a child but when but when they're a son right then but then there'll never be no more than just a child just an ordinary son until they mature and so what they are you take a child you take a three-year-old and say you work on cars okay you take a three-year-old you set them up on the on on the on the on the defender of the car you're taking this engine apart and carburetors and whatever else they have under the hood and you're sitting there and you're showing them season this is this and this is this this and this you start taking it apart your kid's watching well all of a sudden when he gets to be six or seven years old you set him up on the hood and says here's son why don't you take this off and let's see what you can do with it because he had watched often enough now he knew the part he knew what to do when you got it off and then when he gets to be 12 13 years of hell he says yeah the car needs to be worked on here this is what's wrong with it go fix it because he has learned he has been taught he has been trained but see that's what God's trying to do for us now we have watched God work through a prophet we have watched God to do Miracles we watch God heal the sick and raise the dead and cast out even we've watched him sit there and still the storm and create squirrels and bring him into existence God is trying to show the bride this is what you are this is what you possess this is what you are capable of because of the god that has called you because you are his sons and his daughters but you have to be willing to accept who you are and here you hear him well that's where the church needs to be denied it needs to be a place that God will call you off somewhere and throw his glory over you spread his power upon you and adopt you and place you into the body where when you speak something happens that's what the church is needing tonight that's but but if we our character goes down instead of going up he's going to do it he said we've got to continue to believe every work of God and seek after righteousness and do that which is right in the sight of God daily calling on him and daily about his work getting others to come to church trying to get somebody to come and to serve the Lord that's that's that right now that that that's our calling but you know people are not going to accept what you're saying if there's not a life to back it up if you look like the rest of the world and you TR you can't tell you from the rest of the world they're going to say what's the difference between you and them yeah they have purple hair and you have pink hair well okay oh come on what's the difference here you know well you got tattoos from they only have tattoos from from their elbow up to their shoulder you got them from your wrist to the what's the difference I mean there are some people they come into the message and they already have that and I'm not knocking that but what I'm saying is you you have to show that you're different and you show that you're different by the character that you express like I say we try and invite the rest of the world into our bubble we want them to experience the god that we have we want them to find the peace and the joy and the long suffering that we live in we're inviting them to come into our world because I'm not going to go into theirs I have no desire for their world and so but if they can sit there and they could notice that you saw something different about you why are you so sweet why are you so gentle why are you so caring why do you do this and why do you do that well because Christ lives in me that's his character and I'm trying to express his character do I do it all the time no but I'm getting better at it I'm learning to die out to myself more every day and allowing him to have the preeminence in my life he says now the dispensation of adoption what the world's waiting and groaning for and when the fullness of time comes when the dispensation of the fullness of time what is that fullness of time when the dead Rises when sickness ceases when all the Earth ceases to grow and the fullness of the dispensation of time tell me my brother tell me my sister when is the time that the sons of God were ever to be manifested outside of this time now when when were there ever a time in the history uh this that that this for me when is there ever time in history this that manifested at the time to deliver nature he said I had to wait until this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of the sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ till it'll join him and the church together then brother Branham goes on after the sea that was preached before the seals then he's going on after the seals he says I believe the mechanics is here they're waiting for the Dynamics that'll take her off the earth into glory and the Rapture he is the Dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts that he hands them to us just before the wedding supper he said the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost will rise her up uh just exactly like that even the dead that's been dead in Christ for hundreds of years will ago will rise up in the beauty of Holiness and take a flight into the sky there is coming a time and I believe it soon that that's going to be fulfilled when all of a sudden The Headstone will Unite with the body and then the fullness of God of Christ all of a sudden be poured into the into the into the church into the bride and then all of a sudden that will that will enable us to have the faith to believe for the changing of our body and when all of a sudden that's and I don't believe it's going to be a long brother Brown says there'll be a short quick work this may refer to that it may not I I don't know but all I know is when he talks about their he's talking about the time of the Rapture he's talking about the time when all of a sudden our bodies will be changed and the dead in Christ will rise and then all of a sudden we in a moment and twinkling an eye our bodies will be changed and we'll leave this place so I believe it'll be in this in a very short period of time just before our bodies are obtained in Revelations 5 he says we are waiting for the fullness of adoption this will take place when at the first resurrection that's when our bodies will be changed from the vile creatures that we are and we'll have a body like unto his own glorious body in Revelations chapter 5 he says but yet we're still groaning with them because as yet we haven't received the fullness of our adoption but we have the earnest of it that we were picked up from the things of the world and now become Sons and Daughters of God he said what kind of people should we be oh my when I think of that think of it uh now we have the earnest our Spirits groaning for the full adoption but now we have the earnest of it as we receive the Holy Spirit it is the earnest of our complete adoption of complete salvation we were predestined before the foundation of the world is that right to the adoption of sons predestinated to eternal life now after you come into eternal life after you have been saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Spirit your sons now God is wanting to place you positionally oh so that we can just work for his kingdom for his glory ladies in church age brother Brown says when God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word for his day the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation they live Wesley's message when the methodists failed God raised up others and so has gone on until the years until this last day there is again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age we have to take the revelation God had given to brother Branham and we have to live that revelation and what is that revelation we are the fullness of the godhead bodily we already we are to be for we are to be manifested Sons and Daughters of God we are we are we are we our bodies are going to be changed we not everybody will die where all of a sudden we'll be changed in the moment and twinkling of an eye we're coming to the adoption we're coming to the place where we will actually become what God intended for us to be before there was the fall that's the revelation but we have to die to ourselves to attain that this is what stands in our way these temples that we live in Paul had to fight his brother Branham had to fight his Luther Wesley and the rest of them they had to fight theirs so we have to overcome this we have to yield this to God so God can live in us until it's no longer I who live and now it's God living his life through me he said yes sir he said the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it's its own mouth feed so God is turning on here he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her the voice of God's going to be in you some limit that to the Prophet The Prophet's gone God he fulfilled what God has sent him to fulfill now it's our turn you look at Elijah and Elisha Elijah was a prophet he had a Ministry he had a calling God took him so what happened the mantle from Elijah fell on Elisha and Elisha carried on Elijah's Ministry when Jesus Christ was here and and he and he rose from the dead then what happened his mantle fell on the church and the church all the way through that time is supposed to be supposed to carry on with the work God started in Christ now the church is supposed to carry on the same work but it died over the years you know what happened God sent us a prophet and now the mantle if I could call it that was on brother Branham now rests upon the rest of the Bride because we are to perform the same thing that God performed through him brother Branham never performed one miracle brother Branham never healed anybody brother Brown brother Branham brother Branham was a Son of God but he had learned to yield himself to the spirit of God that dwelt in him he says it's not me who does the work it's the God who lives in me doing the work he said when the when all of a sudden the angel come down on in the Ohio River he said I was just standing there when God did that when all of a sudden he talks about the discernment he said I was merely standing there as God was speaking through me when something else happened he's I was just standing there well God did this he says it's not about me it's about him it's not what I do it's what I allow him to do through me he said I have to learn how to yields over the spirit of God that dwells in me and the more I can deal to the spirit of God in Me the more God can use me and now it has to come down to us we have to make the commitment that we have to make the same commitment we have to be willing to take our lives and place our lives into the hands of God and let God so control us and God so use us until it's no longer I who live but now it's Christ Living his life through me he said yes it is what it says in the in the last chapter of Revelations uh Revelations verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from God as a Pentecost but of course the word bride will be refuted in that day it has to come through us he said the earnest means more is yet to come we only have the earnest of it now the earnest is just is just a down payment he said just a down payment that holds it and secures it and anchors it so that no one else can touch it's it's the earnest of our adoption amen the holy spirit is now the earnest the is now the earnest of God in our hearts sealed the adoption of sons waiting for the final Waiting for the End of the Road where Sons and Daughters of God otherwise you go in in restoration of the variety otherwise you're going to form what's known to me as a bride see all right I'll go with you uh you will be a part of me you will be my bride my life will be in your body just like husband and wife is one person you and I are going to be one at that day you'll know that I am in the Father the fathers and me I and you and you and me oh I just love that and Satan gets so angry that see the Oneness of God do you realize where he's putting us he's elevating us into the godhead so to speak he's elevating us into a place where it's no longer us living because God living his life through us God dwelts in the prophet we call Brother Bradham he was a renegade he had to accept Jesus Christ as his savior God had to try him off through the years of his ministry until God could bold him and make him to the place where God could God could trust him with a spoken word God has to mold us and make us until he can trust us with that spoken word until we come to the place where we totally yield ourselves to the spirit of God that is in us God can never trust us with that spoken word he said he goes on he says all that God was he poured into Christ and all the Christ was the important of the church there you are it makes them all one and he said he said see be one as I and the father one yeah be that kind of one then how will that be the word in us would be the anointed word that is the Oneness of God see the mess the Oneness of God is the word anointed in you see and then you become a son or a messiah of this of the age so God can take and he can if you if you if you dwell in the word you continue to feed up on the word you continue to listen to what God's telling us through the prophet that word just becomes more and more a part of us until all of a sudden we all of a situation will arise and all of a sudden we will speak and God will anoint that word that we speak and the when what he when he anoints the word that we speak because it's his word that dwells in us he will bring it to our mind we will speak it he will anoint it and that's exactly what will happen but you have to have his word dwelling in you Christianity is not a Sunday morning social function it's a full commitment to a life of Jesus Christ it's a fourth amendment where you take your life and you give it over to God and you say God here I am use me I give up my future I give up my hopes I give up my desires I give up everything I have for the Excellency of the knowledge of knowing you this was Paul he said he said I had my life all planned out and all of a sudden God on the road to Damascus he appeared to me and he changed my whole life he said oh just for the Excellency of the knowledge of knowing him he says I'm willing to give it all up but too many of us we have Excellency of knowledge of this that and the other when really the whole Focus we should have should be on nothing but Jesus Christ the mystery of God reveal he says when I see God's Great purpose revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminence the oversight the leading brother bounces talking of Satan he says he knows that if the people can get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they can get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the antichristparent Satan will be powerless before her God sent us a prophet we should know how Satan works we should know what it means to be deceived we should know what what is true and what is false we should know if somebody is staying on the word or whether they're out there doing their own private revelation we should be able to discern the difference between truth and error we should be able to begin to understand what God is trying to do with us we should begin Jesus Christ could do what he did because he knew who he was and now he God is waiting for us to realize who we are so that he can do the same thing through us that he did through Peter and James and John and brother Branham and all the rest of them it's not about us doing it's us allowing him to do it through us he just needs instruments he needs vows that he can speak to he needs hands that he can have later on other people he needs your feet to you so you can carry God to wherever God wants to go it's not about you it's about him it's you allowing him to have the preeminence in your life and and until God can so control you until it's no longer you controlling your life but now you're allowing God to control your life and and God can speak to you and God can guide and direct your path I mean let's know how what brother branham's life God will speak to him I want you to go to a certain certain city I want you to be at a certain certain corner I want you to be there at seven seven uh 704. and then somebody's going to come by and this way they're going to be dressed I want you to pray for them and I want you to leave so brother Branham had to get to there he had to find the corner he had to be there exactly at 704. all of a sudden the person he said was coming person came by and brother Brown said God sent me here to pray for you he prays for the person and then all of a sudden he he hightails it out of town that person never knew it was brother Branham it wasn't to glorify the prophet God had a purpose for him going there because there was a person there that had a need and God says you're the only one that can fulfill it you know there's a story that brother Branham talks about he was flying home from some place and the plane he was in all of a sudden got grounded and I don't know whether it's weather conditions or what the thing was but brother Brown was going to go out and mail a card or something like that and God told him walk well where am I no don't ask questions walk but no walk he did he walked and he walked he went to the other the color into the poor section of town and there was a there was there was a colored lady there leaning on the gate morning Parson been waiting on you well Auntie how'd you know I was a person God showed me you were coming oh I'm brother Branham have you ever heard of me nope do you have a revelation of the Seven Seals well no do you understand the mystery of the godhead well no well do you understand you know all the things going on in this generation well no but she had a relationship with God that relationship caused that plane to be grounded because she had a need and God was going to send that Prophet by her way to fulfill her need when all of a sudden he said well Auntie why don't you pray first he said that wasn't the first time she'd ever prayed she had a relationship she trusted God she believed God and she had a need and so she prayed God I'm a shooter my woman where's your Elijah do we have the same relationship do you have the same if you had a need could you ground an airplane so somebody on that airplane can come by your house and minister to your need this is the question I asked myself do I have that relationship do I have such a relationship with my father that if I ask my father he will do what I ask and slowly but surely I think I'm approaching that Philippians and the musicians want to come Paul says not as though I had already attained either already perfect but I follow after I pursue with an eagerness I pursue with a purpose that I might apprehend after which I am apprehended of Christ Jesus I want to fulfill God's calling in my life I want to become what God has ordained me to be and Paul said nothing will stop me from that goal Brethren I count on myself to apprehend it but this one thing that I do forgetting everything that's behind me and and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ he exerted all of his Energies to attain a goal that in many respects is unattainable but that didn't stop him he focused on a goal and by focusing on that goal he says I'm going to reach what God has ordained for me to become let's just pray heavenly father I thank you for using me it's been kind of mixed up I know so Lord you take the words and you put them together and and Lord I've tried to share with them what you've been sharing with me and I'm not sure I've made it plain but Lord you have set before all of us a goal and that goal is to be Sons and Daughters of God that goal is to reach and attain to the to the resurrection of the Dead to changing of our bodies and to be able to enter into the what it was like in Eden before there was the fall that's what you have called us to become Lord but we need your help we can't do it by ourselves so take each one of the members that are here Lord and and Lord help us to focus on the our future the future that we have with you that Lord we can become what you in debt what you ordain for us to be from the beginning Grant this Lord for I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen oh a vessel of Honor for God oh a vessel of Honor for God [Music] [Music] so what might be a vessel of Honor
