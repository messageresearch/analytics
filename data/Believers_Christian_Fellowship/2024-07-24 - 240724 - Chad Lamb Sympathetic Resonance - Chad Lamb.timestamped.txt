[13:07] little bit different up front front
[13:09] tonight and I'm sure that's driving some
[13:10] people crazy I want to know what's
[13:13] happening but I had an inspiration a
[13:15] couple weeks ago just dropped into my
[13:16] heart to do a little object lesson so
[13:18] I'm going to do that tonight I don't
[13:19] think I've ever done that before but by
[13:21] the grace of God we'll see if he'll help
[13:23] us through it amen and uh the deacons
[13:26] met me at the door at night and said
[13:27] what's up what's up front I said so
[13:29] we're just going to have to wait and
[13:31] see and then they asked me again are you
[13:34] really not going to tell us brother dry
[13:35] ass are you really not I said no I'm not
[13:36] going to tell you you're going to have
[13:38] to wait and see so I don't think anybody
[13:40] knows but brother Franco so amen
[13:42] hopefully the Lord just really uh helps
[13:44] us enjoy ourselves in the word tonight
[13:46] and gain something that we can carry
[13:48] with us that will change us amen and I
[13:51] before we read the scripture I wanted to
[13:53] let you know that we have a visiting
[13:54] Minister coming in this Sunday brother

[14:10] many of you know the dean hars Brother
[14:12] David dehart and his family that's where
[14:13] they attend church so we're looking
[14:15] forward to having him here also I also
[14:18] want to remind you tomorrow night we'll
[14:19] have the church AG book Bible study in
[14:21] the fellowship hall and also we have
[14:23] some visitors here with us this evening
[14:25] all the way from Saskatchewan amen so
[14:28] we've got sisters Audrey and Doris Adele
[14:32] and Sharon and her son Caleb God bless
[14:34] you all they're right back here it's
[14:35] good to have you with us we pray you
[14:37] find welcome here man it's good to have
[14:39] you that's a long journey amen so we're
[14:41] glad you stopped in to see us amen while
[14:43] we're standing together then let's turn
[14:45] to the book of Acts and turn to chapter
[14:53] 13 Acts chapter
[14:58] 13
[14:59] verse 46 Acts
[15:05] 13:46 says when Paul and Barnabas waxed
[15:08] bold and said it was necessary that the
[15:10] word of God should first have been
[15:11] spoken to you but seeing you put it from
[15:14] you and judge yourselves Unworthy of
[15:16] everlasting life Lo we turn to the
[15:18] Gentiles for so ha the Lord commanded us
[15:21] saying I have set thee to be a light of
[15:23] the Gentiles that thou should us be for
[15:25] salvation into the ends of the Earth and
[15:28] when the Gentiles heard this they were
[15:29] glad and glorified the word of the Lord
[15:31] and as many as were ordained to eternal
[15:34] life believed amen God bless you as you
[15:37] have your seats
[15:38] amen so this is where we want to put our
[15:41] Focus here on this last portion of the
[15:44] scripture as many as were ordained to
[15:46] eternal life believed and so you ask why
[15:48] did they believe because they were
[15:50] ordained to eternal life amen this
[15:53] brings into context predestination the
[15:55] understanding we have that God knew
[15:58] before the foundation of the world we
[15:59] were chosen in Christ before the
[16:01] foundation of the world our names were
[16:03] put in the Lamb's Book of Life from
[16:04] before the foundation of the world and
[16:06] now as the Apostle Paul is coming
[16:09] preaching he's he's coming and preaching
[16:11] the gospel and as he's going from place
[16:13] to place preaching there are some who
[16:15] believe and some who don't believe and
[16:17] and here he is he and Barnabas are here
[16:20] preaching and there's those that are
[16:22] rejecting the word but not everyone
[16:24] rejected the word there was those there
[16:27] that received the word and those who
[16:29] received the word were those as many as
[16:32] were ordained to eternal life amen
[16:35] praise God so let's go turn to John
[16:37] chapter
[16:42] 10 John chapter 10 and we remember the
[16:46] the story we're not this is not the
[16:47] story I'm going to read this scripture
[16:49] but remember the John chapter 4 when he
[16:52] went to the woman at the well and this
[16:54] was the Samaritan woman uh and when we
[16:57] read here in Acts uh Paul was talking to
[16:59] the Gentiles and they were ordained to
[17:01] eternal life the ones that believed were
[17:03] the ones who were ordained eternal life
[17:05] the Jews in this place were rejecting
[17:07] but these uh who they thought were not
[17:09] included were included and they were
[17:11] ordained into eternal life and they
[17:13] believed they received the word gladly
[17:16] now we come to uh in John chapter 4
[17:19] Jesus goes to Samaria he goes he goes to
[17:22] this well in Samaria and the Samaritan
[17:24] woman comes along also someone that the
[17:26] Jews wouldn't think would be included
[17:29] and as he begins to speak to her amen
[17:32] she she begins to respond to what Jesus
[17:34] is saying and she begins to desire what
[17:36] he's offering and and she begins to ask
[17:38] him questions and and in the course of
[17:40] their dialogue she she comes to the
[17:42] realization to the Revelation that this
[17:44] before me is the Messiah what a I mean
[17:47] it's astounding amen the high priest the
[17:50] Pharisees the the scribes they were all
[17:52] missing it they were contesting him they
[17:54] were accusing him of being be elub he
[17:56] was false he was he was born wrong he
[17:58] was all kinds of things they were
[18:00] accusations they were throwing they were
[18:02] not receiving his word but here they
[18:04] come to a Samaritan woman who had been
[18:06] living in adultery who had a bad
[18:09] reputation who was not included in the
[18:11] even even in the good part of Samaritan
[18:14] Society she wasn't
[18:16] included but when she began to talk amen
[18:19] there was something in what Jesus was
[18:21] telling her and listen what he was
[18:22] telling her wasn't intellectually
[18:25] satisfying because he she she he he he
[18:28] asked for water and she says why are you
[18:30] dealing with me and he says if you knew
[18:32] who you were talking to you would ask me
[18:34] of water and I'd give you living water
[18:35] that you thirst no more and she says
[18:37] well I want this water and he says go
[18:39] get your husband and this is he's not
[18:42] sitting down breaking down the gospel to
[18:44] her in an intellectual way he's just
[18:46] interact the word is interacting with
[18:48] her amen and during the course of the
[18:50] interaction she recognized there's a
[18:53] there's a man here who can tell me about
[18:55] my life this is something special amen
[18:58] amen and then he begins to talk about
[19:00] living water dwelling up in her an
[19:03] artisian well a well of Living Water
[19:05] springing up in her and all of a sudden
[19:07] something in her wanted that
[19:09] water I mean it's not a logical
[19:12] conversation it's it's not
[19:14] intellectually satisfying it's not
[19:16] normal religious
[19:19] rhetoric you understand this
[19:21] conversation is
[19:23] odd are we do we agree this is not
[19:27] religion
[19:28] this is not textbook theology this is
[19:31] not five steps to winning
[19:35] Souls yes
[19:37] sir right try to replicate
[19:41] this he was just there was a soul he had
[19:44] needs to go by Samaria he was on a
[19:47] mission and he knew who he's hunting and
[19:49] he didn't come uh what we would say the
[19:51] typical way amen but he began to talk to
[19:54] her and then he talked about I can give
[19:56] you living water so you thirst no more I
[19:58] want that water then he says the water I
[20:00] give you will be a well of Living Water
[20:02] springing up into her eternal life and
[20:03] then she really wanted that water and
[20:06] then she she had to she had to expose
[20:08] her he had to expose her past life and
[20:10] and then she had to ask about worship
[20:12] and he had to give her the secret to
[20:14] true worship is worshiping in spirit and
[20:16] in truth and that's who the father's
[20:18] looking for and then she goes right to
[20:20] messiah messiah will tell us these
[20:22] things and he says I that speaketh unto
[20:24] you am he
[20:30] and she stood there contemplating what
[20:33] had just
[20:35] happened I mean really put the
[20:37] conversation in context it's
[20:43] weird just imagine your she was going to
[20:47] the well this is nothing out of routine
[20:51] this is nothing out of common this is
[20:52] probably one of the most common
[20:54] activities of her
[20:56] day she was going to the West well she
[20:59] had no expectation there was nothing she
[21:02] wasn't looking for anything she wasn't
[21:04] going to a church service she wasn't
[21:06] trying to find anything she was doing
[21:08] the most mundane and routine of all of
[21:10] her routine activities with no
[21:12] expectation and when she goes there's a
[21:14] man sitting by the well that's a little
[21:16] odd it may not be completely odd amen
[21:18] because that's where everybody goes to
[21:20] get their water but it was a little
[21:21] different then he started talking and
[21:23] she recognized he's a Jew and she says
[21:24] well that's weird he shouldn't be
[21:26] dealing with me they don't normally like
[21:27] to talk to us and and and then it gets
[21:29] stranger and stranger and stranger and
[21:31] stranger and this little trip to the
[21:32] well ends with her meeting a prophet
[21:35] that can tell her her whole life and now
[21:36] she believes with her whole heart she's
[21:38] just met the
[21:42] Messiah astounding
[21:44] friends we go back and we read through
[21:46] the Bible and for us it's just that's
[21:48] just nothing that's normal we just read
[21:50] it it just happened when it was
[21:52] happening then it was the most
[21:53] extraordinary thing that had ever
[21:55] happened it was beyond unusual it was it
[21:58] was unb believable but here she is her
[22:00] the disciples come up and all of a
[22:02] sudden the disciples are wondering why
[22:04] is he talking to this woman what's going
[22:05] on she sitting there and when when all
[22:08] of a sudden the full impact of the last
[22:10] few minutes fell upon her she dropped
[22:12] her water pot and went running into a
[22:14] city and told everybody come see a man
[22:16] that's told me everything I've ever done
[22:18] isn't this the Messiah that will do
[22:20] these things yeah
[22:23] am brother man when he talks about this
[22:25] little woman he says she
[22:30] she could
[22:31] believe but the religious leader the
[22:34] Pharisees the intellectual they couldn't
[22:38] believe here's what he said they had
[22:41] nothing to believe
[22:44] with she had something already in her
[22:47] that could believe what he was
[22:49] saying there was the dividing line she
[22:52] had something to believe with praise be
[22:56] to God now we look at John chapter
[22:59] 10 verse
[23:02] 27 in John 10: 27 he said my sheep hear
[23:06] my voice and I know them and they follow
[23:10] me am
[23:12] amen Jesus said that he came to seek and
[23:16] to save that which was lost he came to
[23:18] find the lost sheep and they were his
[23:21] sheep he said my sheep hear my voice
[23:24] that means if they hear his voice
[23:27] they're his
[23:31] sheep and then when he says my sheep
[23:33] hear my voice he's not going to buy
[23:37] sheep or find sheep or gather sheep that
[23:40] are new sheep he's going for his sheep
[23:45] that means they already belong to him
[23:47] they're assigned to him he is already
[23:49] their Shepherd they are already his
[23:52] sheep and they're identified he's
[23:55] identified to them by The Voice they're
[23:57] identified ifed to him by hearing his
[24:00] voice their identification as his sheep
[24:03] is the ability to hear his voice let's
[24:07] turn to Luke chapter 8 Luke Chapter
[24:19] 8:9 Luke chapter
[24:22] 8 verse 9
[24:34] says and his disciples asked him saying
[24:37] what might this Parable be and he said
[24:39] unto you it is given to know the
[24:41] mysteries of the kingdom of God but to
[24:43] others in Parables that seeing they may
[24:46] not see and hearing they may not
[24:49] understand so it's given in Parables so
[24:53] that they can see but not see and hear
[24:57] but not hear
[24:59] back to the woman at the well the
[25:00] Pharisees heard but they didn't hear and
[25:03] they saw but they didn't see they saw
[25:06] Miracles they saw uh uh a prophet they
[25:09] saw but they didn't see they heard the
[25:12] teaching they heard the speech they
[25:13] heard but they didn't
[25:15] hear let's go now to John chapter
[25:18] 8 John chapter 8:42
[25:31] in John 8:
[25:37] 42 he says here Jesus said unto them if
[25:42] God were your father you would love me
[25:44] for I proceeded forth and came from God
[25:46] neither came I of myself but he sent me
[25:49] why do you not understand my speech even
[25:51] because you cannot hear my word this is
[25:54] amazing because we got to keep things in
[25:57] in in context and our understanding why
[26:00] do you not understand my speech even
[26:01] because you cannot hear my word they
[26:04] were not
[26:06] deaf they had the sense of hearing and
[26:10] they spoke the same language and they
[26:13] understood mechanically what he was
[26:15] saying right so they were hearing but
[26:19] not hearing amen they were understanding
[26:23] they were understanding they they
[26:26] understood the translation of the words
[26:29] that he spoke but they didn't understand
[26:31] the meaning of what he
[26:33] said why do you not understand my speech
[26:36] even because you cannot hear my word ye
[26:38] are of your father the devil and the
[26:40] lust of your father you will do he was a
[26:42] murderer from the beginning and Abode
[26:44] not in the truth because there is no
[26:46] truth in him that's an important
[26:49] statement there is no truth in him amen
[26:52] when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of
[26:54] his own for he is a liar and the father
[26:56] of it and because I tell you the truth
[26:58] you believe me not which of you convince
[27:00] me of sin and if if I say the truth why
[27:03] do you not believe me he that is he that
[27:07] is of God heareth God's word ye
[27:09] therefore hear them not because you are
[27:11] not of
[27:14] God kind of
[27:16] amazing
[27:19] so the the devil he says was your father
[27:23] you cannot why do you not understand my
[27:25] speech even because you cannot hear my
[27:27] word
[27:28] and they're like I heard everything you
[27:31] said but you did you've heard everything
[27:34] I said but you didn't hear what I was
[27:36] [Music]
[27:39] saying because they didn't have the ears
[27:41] that the woman at the well
[27:44] had and so he says if you were uh of God
[27:49] you would hear my words he that is of
[27:51] God heareth God's words ye therefore
[27:54] hear them not because you are not of God
[27:56] so he says you're of your father the
[27:57] devil and there is no truth in him
[28:00] that's why he can't receive the truth or
[28:02] believe the truth or act the truth
[28:03] because there's no truth in him for to
[28:06] receive the truth there had to be truth
[28:08] in him let's go to John chapter
[28:16] 18 John chapter
[28:24] 18 in John 18:37
[28:31] John 18:37 pilate therefore said unto
[28:34] him art thou a king then Jesus answered
[28:36] thou sayest that I am a king to this end
[28:39] was I born and for this cause came I
[28:41] into the world that I should bear
[28:43] witness unto the truth everyone that is
[28:46] of the truth heareth my
[28:50] voice so if you're of the truth you'll
[28:53] hear his
[28:56] voice so do you hear his voice after you
[28:59] become of the truth or do you hear his
[29:02] voice because you're of the
[29:04] truth so that means you must have
[29:07] something to hear with amen and if you
[29:10] hear then there must be some truth in
[29:13] you already to hear the truth because
[29:16] the devil has no truth in him and you're
[29:18] Children of the devil and you cannot
[29:19] hear my speech because you understand my
[29:21] speech because you cannot hear my word
[29:23] but if you of God you would hear God's
[29:25] word and you would believe me
[29:28] amen so everyone that is of Truth
[29:30] heareth my voice amen so so when do I
[29:33] hear his voice after I become of the
[29:35] truth or do I hear his voice because I'm
[29:37] already of the
[29:40] truth predestination friends it's all
[29:42] through the
[29:44] Bible amen I'm going to come down here
[29:47] to my little
[29:49] table I set that up because we're going
[29:51] to have a really short preacher tonight
[29:53] no I'm just I'm just
[29:56] kidding it's going to be me
[29:59] I really don't know exactly how all this
[30:02] is going to work out I don't really have
[30:03] it all sketched out in my mind but
[30:04] that's okay I just have an inspiration
[30:07] and that's enough for
[30:09] me
[30:11] amen
[30:13] so I don't know why this flashed into my
[30:16] mind like a lightning bolt but we're
[30:19] going
[30:20] to just see what
[30:23] happens
[30:25] amen so the this is a tuning
[30:31] fork this is a box I have no idea why
[30:33] but it's just a box The Tuning Fork goes
[30:36] in now I'm going to I'm going to set
[30:40] up my phone here I've got
[30:43] a tuning app on
[30:47] here that I'm going to put in
[30:51] here I practiced this part today so I
[30:54] could get it right
[31:00] so this tuning fork happens to be set
[31:04] for 440 Hertz 444 440 Hertz is the note
[31:10] a in Middle a on the musical scale now
[31:13] I'm not a musician so I may get
[31:15] something wrong I'm also not a scientist
[31:17] so I may get something wrong so if I get
[31:19] something wrong just say poor brother
[31:21] Chad but try to understand what I'm
[31:23] getting at try to get to the point so
[31:25] this was cast in such a way that this
[31:28] has a a frequency of 440 Hertz so it
[31:31] gives the note a now 440 Hertz is the
[31:35] rate of oscillation or vibration so this
[31:38] these these two prongs they vibrate when
[31:40] you strike them with a mallet so
[31:42] equilibrium is the center the vibration
[31:44] will make it vibrate back and forth one
[31:46] full vibration back and forth is an
[31:48] oscillation all right I'm not a
[31:51] scientist so I might have got that a
[31:52] little bit wrong but I think that's
[31:54] right so the the rate that it vibrates
[31:57] or the oscillation the number of Cycles
[32:00] from one side back to the other back to
[32:02] Middle that's one cycle that's that's
[32:05] rated in hertz one cycle is a hert one
[32:08] cycle per second would be one Hertz so
[32:10] 440 Hertz means this vibrates 440 cycles
[32:14] per second when it's struck that's how
[32:17] we get the note a and you can use this
[32:20] to tune a piano you can use it to tune
[32:21] all kinds of instruments to tune a
[32:23] guitar to tune all kinds of things so
[32:26] can we see the
[32:28] I can't see the thing if we can pull up
[32:31] the um tuner if you can pull up my tuner
[32:34] there we go so you guys can see I want
[32:37] evidence I'm not lying there's no
[32:42] tricks so you can see that strikes a and
[32:46] when I talk I mess it all
[32:48] up if you look on the center here of the
[32:51] scale when it's at zero that means
[32:53] you're right on a 440 HZ is a this is
[32:57] reading
[32:58] 4391 so it's an electronic device pretty
[33:01] close so this will
[33:04] strike every time you strike you get a
[33:06] you get dead center a it's a it's a it's
[33:08] a all the time so this is
[33:13] a this one here is also a it's the it's
[33:17] the same it's been cast the same way
[33:19] it's been shaped the same way it's come
[33:21] from the same Forge the same Foundry so
[33:24] when it comes the same way when you
[33:27] strike it
[33:29] we get the same thing 4391 so relatively
[33:33] it's 440 Herz this is a so these two
[33:37] tuning Forks were cast out of the same
[33:40] cast they were designed the same way
[33:42] they're made in the same shape they come
[33:44] from the same Foundry from the same
[33:46] Forge they're the they're the they're
[33:48] the they give the same tone they
[33:51] resonate the same tone now every object
[33:55] has a natural frequency every object
[33:57] everything you tap you tap a glass
[33:59] there's a certain frequency it's giving
[34:00] a certain tone you you tap a metal cup a
[34:03] plastic cup a glass they all have a tone
[34:06] they all have a frequency everything has
[34:08] a natural vibration or a natural
[34:10] resonance that it that resonates at so
[34:13] this will always resonate when you
[34:15] strike it at 440 Herz every time you
[34:17] strike it and the same thing with a an
[34:20] empty cup that empty Cup every time you
[34:22] strike it it'll resonate the same
[34:24] frequency so everything on Earth
[34:26] everything has a fre frequency and so uh
[34:31] these two things have a frequency but I
[34:33] want to discuss something that's called
[34:35] sympathetic
[34:36] resonance because these two are the same
[34:40] they have the same resonance they have a
[34:43] they'll have a sympathetic resonance
[34:44] that means they resonate at the same
[34:46] rate and because they resonate at the
[34:49] same rate when I strike one because this
[34:53] has a sympathetic resonance it'll
[34:55] resonate at the same frequency as this
[34:57] this one so if I do
[35:01] that you can hear the tone and I can
[35:04] tell you they're both
[35:06] vibrating you don't know they're both
[35:08] vibrating but I'll show you that they're
[35:09] both vibrating so now when I strike this
[35:13] one and I stop
[35:19] it I never touched this one I didn't
[35:22] strike this one I didn't do anything to
[35:24] this tuning fork the only thing I did
[35:26] was strike this this
[35:31] one and because they came from the same
[35:35] Forge because they come from the
[35:37] original place together because they're
[35:39] the same they have the same natural
[35:43] resonance when I when the tone comes
[35:45] from one it influences the other and the
[35:48] influence from the other resonates the
[35:50] same sound
[35:57] it works
[36:01] backwards because they're the same they
[36:04] influence one another they're so perfect
[36:07] in this that we can make the influence
[36:09] go back and forth so I'm going to strike
[36:11] this one I'm going to deaden this so you
[36:13] can hear it here I'm going to take my
[36:15] hand off and let the one that's
[36:16] vibrating not the one I struck I'm going
[36:19] to let it influence the one that I de
[36:21] and then I'm going to D this one and
[36:22] you'll hear the tone over here I got I
[36:25] explained it to you cuz I have to do it
[36:26] quickly so we don't run out of
[36:34] vibration so they can influence each
[36:36] other back and forth cuz we can
[36:38] influence each other back and forth you
[36:40] can influence your brother one day and
[36:43] then something comes along and deadens
[36:44] you but then your brother can influence
[36:46] you right back amen because we all come
[36:50] from the same Source we come from the
[36:51] same Foundry we're all we all all have a
[36:54] part of God we all you remember the
[36:56] teaspoon of uh ocean water coming out of
[36:58] the ocean amen we've all come from the
[37:01] same place if we're brothers and sisters
[37:03] in Christ we all have uh a portion of
[37:06] God within us we have uh We've Come of
[37:09] the truth there's something of Truth
[37:11] within us there was something in us that
[37:14] was in that woman in Samaria that day
[37:16] when she was by the well and God was
[37:18] speaking to her in the form of a man
[37:20] Jesus Christ and something in her amen
[37:23] was moving was vibrating amen because
[37:26] why because she had had something to
[37:28] believe with on the inside she could
[37:30] resonate back when she turned around
[37:33] amen when she turned around and dropped
[37:35] her water pot and ran into the City and
[37:37] said come see a man that told me all
[37:39] things I ever knew is not this the
[37:41] Messiah you know what she was doing
[37:43] Jesus was the one who was
[37:46] struck but she was the Run resonating in
[37:49] town she was one giving the message she
[37:51] was declaring the message of the hour in
[37:53] the city of Samaria he was still back at
[37:56] the well with his discip Les so he rang
[37:59] she was influenced she picked it up she
[38:02] ran into the city she began to ring some
[38:04] of those who could catch the influence
[38:06] came out of the city and come to talk to
[38:08] Jesus
[38:09] themselves praise God Amen God is good
[38:15] amen now there's a little doohickey
[38:18] thing of a bobber
[38:20] here and that's good English if your
[38:22] grandparents are from Kentucky like mine
[38:28] this slips onto one of these tongs and
[38:31] you can slide it up and down and put it
[38:33] on here and what it does is it will
[38:36] change the vibration it'll change the
[38:38] frequency because I've added a weight so
[38:40] that thing will not oscillate at the
[38:42] same frequency that it did so if I
[38:44] strike
[38:46] it I'm getting a G
[38:50] sharp if I move it down I'll still be in
[38:53] the
[38:55] a but I'm a flat I think is that right
[38:59] flat a flat a I'm a flat
[39:02] a every time I sing it's
[39:06] flat so you can see down on the scale on
[39:08] the bottom here how it goes negative
[39:11] because we've changed the frequency by
[39:13] adding that that little thing but it's
[39:16] still it's still a we're still in a but
[39:19] we're not at 440 it's actually
[39:23] reading
[39:25] 430 so I'm at 4 30 Herz 430 to 440 is
[39:30] really close right you're talking
[39:32] 440 so this vibrates at 440 this
[39:36] vibrates at 430 that to me is close
[39:42] enough but with a slight
[39:50] change we're slightly
[39:52] off just a little bit off by 10 Hertz
[39:58] 440
[40:00] 430 let's go a little
[40:03] closer let's go
[40:07] back sorry wrong
[40:16] way here's
[40:19] 435 we're off by between four and
[40:23] five Hertz
[40:30] just a little bit off is
[40:33] off just a little bit off won't
[40:37] resonate these two things can't resonate
[40:40] because something's been added to this
[40:43] one now if I strike this
[40:46] one it won't resonate that one but if I
[40:50] take whatever's been extra an add-on
[40:52] that wasn't there in the original in The
[40:54] Foundry
[40:58] it'll resonate
[41:00] again just because we
[41:04] find we find this little doohickey on
[41:07] here thing I'm a
[41:10] bobber de
[41:12] Bob I'm using them
[41:14] all that doesn't change that this is
[41:17] still
[41:19] original something's been added to it
[41:22] something's got attached that needs to
[41:24] be unattached
[41:27] and when it gets unattached it'll go
[41:28] back to what it was originally intended
[41:30] to do and to the sound that it was
[41:32] originally intended to produce and you
[41:34] strike it and once again it
[41:38] resonates and it even resonates
[41:42] back praise be to God you remember the
[41:46] story brother B tells us of uh the uh
[41:49] Farmer and the
[41:51] eagle he took the little Eagle uh the
[41:54] eagle egg out of the nest and he took it
[41:56] down to a a chicken and he set it
[41:58] underneath the chicken and and that
[42:00] chicken set that eagle uh egg and it
[42:02] hatched out with the other chicks and it
[42:04] went through life thinking that it was a
[42:06] chicken and tried to be a chicken tried
[42:08] to do like a chicken never really
[42:10] fitting in all that well but one day it
[42:14] heard a
[42:16] sound mama and eagle flew over the
[42:18] Barnyard one day and let out a scream
[42:21] and when that when that screamed it
[42:23] resonated something inside of him he had
[42:26] a res it frequency whatever that
[42:29] frequency was and whatever he was deep
[42:33] down on the inside were a match and when
[42:35] that screamed the chickens ran because
[42:38] what was in the chickens is not the same
[42:40] that was in that eagle when Mama Eagle
[42:43] screamed she was operating at a
[42:45] different frequency than the chickens
[42:47] and the chickens scattered because they
[42:49] were afraid of that sound amen but as
[42:51] soon as for the first time that eagle
[42:53] first time in his life heard an eagle
[42:55] scream it resonated at a certain
[42:57] frequency and something inside of him
[43:00] began to vibrate just like something
[43:02] vibrated in the woman at the well when
[43:03] she was talking to Jesus cuz he was the
[43:06] eagle screaming and something in her
[43:08] could respond to the scream when
[43:10] millions of others when the Pharisees
[43:12] had nothing to believe with she had
[43:14] something to believe with because it
[43:15] came from the same Source same Foundry
[43:18] original seed inside of
[43:21] her and it could
[43:24] move praise God I like
[43:29] this amen I hope this helps us all amen
[43:33] I hope this helps the kids and the
[43:34] adults and all of us the res what was it
[43:37] in us what what what what was it that we
[43:40] heard we couldn't help it amen we heard
[43:42] the message we couldn't help it we
[43:43] couldn't stop it it didn't matter if
[43:45] it's inconvenient it didn't matter if it
[43:47] cost us it doesn't matter amen because
[43:49] we were founded this way we were in the
[43:51] original the seed inside of our soul had
[43:54] come from God there was nothing you
[43:56] could do to stop it when you heard the
[43:58] eagle scream something and you said what
[44:00] was
[44:02] that and you had heard so many things
[44:04] from the chickens about false prophets
[44:06] and false this and false that you may
[44:08] have been a little bit unsure I don't
[44:10] know it's I'm not so sure but you
[44:12] couldn't stop the resonation on the what
[44:14] was resonating on the inside you
[44:16] couldn't deny it you couldn't lie it off
[44:18] you could be confused in your mind you
[44:20] could have all kinds of voices trying to
[44:22] scare you you could even back up a
[44:23] little bit and hesitate but you could
[44:25] not stop the vibration down in the soul
[44:29] because you were founded that way amen
[44:32] that's the way you came from
[44:35] God
[44:37] Amen so
[44:40] now switch things
[44:43] up so we know that there's been a word
[44:45] for every age amen and God planted his
[44:49] seed for every age and he intended when
[44:51] that age would come forth and God as he
[44:54] was bringing his word up amen he was
[44:56] moving now don't take this as something
[44:58] negative now our de Bob was bad before
[45:00] but let's make it good now can we change
[45:03] our
[45:05] analogy so as God is is bringing back
[45:08] the word he's getting it more and more
[45:10] and more lined up to the
[45:13] original right and so that tone that
[45:18] came from Luther would attract a certain
[45:21] seed the Lutheran seed the tone as God
[45:25] would move down through time time and
[45:27] the tone would come through
[45:32] Wesley it was there to there was a
[45:34] certain seed for that age to respond to
[45:37] that
[45:38] tone but if we still tried to play the
[45:42] piece reading from Wesley Sheep
[45:47] music
[45:50] nothing
[45:52] nothing nothing am
[45:57] this here is waiting for
[46:01] something it's waiting to be moved it's
[46:03] waiting to be put into action it's got
[46:06] It's it's got a natural frequency that's
[46:08] laying here undiscovered and
[46:11] unrealized but yet it's there it's
[46:13] inherent to the object it's part of it
[46:15] it's built into it it's there already
[46:18] amen we don't have to put it in there
[46:19] it's already
[46:21] there so all we have to do is find the
[46:25] word for the age so that the seed and
[46:27] the word match together yes sir cuz
[46:30] brother bam said in God's only provided
[46:31] place of worship he said if I taught you
[46:33] Methodist message it would take no
[46:35] effect on
[46:39] you right it would have no effect on
[46:44] you uh this is bride time if Moses
[46:48] taught the message of Noah it would take
[46:50] no effect if Jesus taught moses' message
[46:52] it would take no effect because the
[46:54] predestinated seed are lay are are
[46:56] laying there that will only be watered
[46:58] by that type of water that's give for
[47:00] that seed it won't grow any other
[47:03] condition it must be the condition that
[47:05] grows in so this thing is sitting here
[47:09] waiting One Church another church
[47:13] another
[47:15] church but one
[47:20] day that's it that's what I've been
[47:23] waiting didn't know it amen listen th
[47:26] this if this is has never been struck
[47:28] before if it's never been plucked before
[47:30] this object doesn't even know how it
[47:32] resonates it's never been put in action
[47:35] it's never been struck it's never it's
[47:37] never been played I mean it's been cast
[47:39] it's been sent to the Earth but
[47:41] nothing's happened yet Amen to cause a
[47:43] sound to come out of it it doesn't know
[47:45] if it's an a it doesn't know if it's a b
[47:46] it doesn't know if it's a c doesn't know
[47:48] if it's a d it doesn't know if it's a g
[47:50] it doesn't know what it is and it's
[47:52] sitting here and it comes in contact
[47:53] with all these other things nothing
[47:55] moves but but one day it comes in
[47:57] contact with an eagle
[48:01] scream and then all of a
[48:03] sudden he says I'm an
[48:06] a I'm an a I know what I am I thought I
[48:10] was a Methodist I thought I was a
[48:11] Baptist I thought I was a Pentecostal I
[48:13] thought I was a Catholic but I realized
[48:15] I'm bride amen I'm part of the Bride
[48:17] because there was something that could
[48:19] awaken what I was inherent already built
[48:23] into me I had to come in contact with
[48:26] something that was the same as me so
[48:28] that I could resonate back what I heard
[48:31] and what I heard was matched to what I
[48:33] am and what I resonate back was a match
[48:36] to what I
[48:40] heard praise
[48:43] God praise
[48:47] God now in order to
[48:50] resonate I have to be in close proximity
[49:06] the closer I get the more it will
[49:08] resonate
[49:12] yes do you hear that we're getting a
[49:15] little
[49:16] [Music]
[49:22] closer we're getting a little closer
[49:32] there it
[49:34] is there it is you know what I want to
[49:37] be as close to this message as I can
[49:39] possibly get cuz the influence of this
[49:43] message is bringing the sound out of my
[49:46] life what was already Trapped In My Soul
[49:50] what was already there from the Forge
[49:52] from the master's Forge when he forged
[49:55] my my soul the SE that's in the soul
[49:57] that part that came from him when it
[49:59] came into this Earth the sound was
[50:01] already there it's already built to
[50:03] resonate the word to resonate by the
[50:05] word and to resonate the word
[50:09] amen so
[50:13] now the word
[50:16] strikes I
[50:19] resonate now the word
[50:22] strikes I
[50:24] resonate now somebody else
[50:28] resonates why because
[50:31] whatever whatever this sound was that
[50:34] hit me I have the capacity to resonate
[50:38] the same
[50:39] sound and when I resonate the same sound
[50:42] that's the word and when I resonate the
[50:44] word if somebody else has a c Gene of
[50:47] God in them then my resonation my life
[50:50] living the life of the word can cause a
[50:53] vibration in their soul that'll cause
[50:55] them to begin to resonate Whoever has
[50:57] been molded to
[50:59] a440 will resonate when it comes in
[51:02] contact with
[51:04] a440 that's why the bride becomes the
[51:07] word by receiving the word she becomes
[51:09] the word she becomes
[51:14] a440 praise God Almighty friends it's
[51:18] too good it's amazing I didn't realize
[51:21] we were going to have a science
[51:22] experiment today but God is in science
[51:25] because the laws of God amen we're
[51:27] created by God and they contain
[51:30] truth because he's the Creator and he
[51:32] doesn't create things false he doesn't
[51:35] create things that are a lie and we know
[51:36] that creation has been perverted so
[51:38] sometimes it's hard to still see because
[51:40] of the perversion amen but when you look
[51:42] under it all the creation of God was
[51:44] created by the person of Truth by the
[51:46] truth giver and then the creation still
[51:48] contains his fingerprint
[51:51] amen so now when we put these two
[51:54] together and we strike them both
[51:57] they will give the
[51:59] same
[52:05] note one steady clear
[52:09] note this is what God wants from his
[52:12] bride all of us he wants he wants us all
[52:16] to be giving that clear that clear
[52:24] Ting even
[52:27] the same sound Christ in bright form a
[52:31] Min member body resonating his
[52:35] life problem is sometimes we got stuff
[52:43] attached a Doctrine yeah a
[52:47] complex a
[52:50] fear if I strike this one now with my
[52:52] little extra
[52:55] attached I resonating at
[52:57] 426
[52:59] Hertz let me see
[53:02] 426
[53:03] Hertz is about 3% off from
[53:07] 440 approximately I know some of your
[53:10] mathematicians you're like no it's 2.75
[53:13] I please I'm not a mathematician I'm not
[53:15] a scientist I'm not a
[53:18] musician I'm barely a high school
[53:21] graduate I dropped out of my second
[53:23] semester of
[53:25] University so when you when you see that
[53:30] this we know is
[53:31] 440 now we know this is this is a 3%
[53:35] variance now I don't know about you but
[53:38] 3% I don't think is really bad I mean if
[53:40] I get within 3% of most things I'm
[53:43] happy if I hit a baseball and it gets 3%
[53:46] of going out of the park I will be
[53:48] jumping up and down even if it's not a
[53:51] home run to me 3% is good but here's
[53:55] what 3% very sounds
[54:01] like you hear that w w it's created a
[54:06] beat because they're off the frequencies
[54:08] don't match and it's only a 3%
[54:17] variance see now if I change the tuning
[54:21] a
[54:23] bit see where we're at now now we're at
[54:27] 4:30 4:30 let me go down just a bit
[54:33] more yeah we're at almost 431 we're at a
[54:37] 2% variance this is only two this is
[54:39] only 2% different than this this is 430
[54:43] almost 1
[54:46] 430.86 or what I said before
[54:51] 4391 2% difference
[54:57] you hear
[54:58] that that is an uncertain
[55:02] sound that's not a clear message to the
[55:08] world now let's change it once
[55:12] again we want to get closer right we
[55:14] always want to be
[55:15] closer so this is
[55:19] 434 let's
[55:21] see yeah this is a 1% difference roughly
[55:26] a 1% difference in tone in
[55:29] frequency so 1% most tolerances
[55:34] everywhere we live and even in
[55:36] engineering is is 1% usually pretty good
[55:39] you're in quality control right brother
[55:41] Gabe is 1% pretty good pretty good it
[55:44] mostly passes right yeah that's right so
[55:52] 1% you hear the whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
[55:54] whoa who 1%
[55:58] difference
[56:00] listen I'm a human being you're a human
[56:03] being if you're 1% off you're fine with
[56:07] me
[56:10] brother but when you hear it off is
[56:15] off like my mind I don't think it's that
[56:18] far off I can live with 1% as a human
[56:21] I'm just talking in my human nature 1%
[56:23] if you get close brother I see your
[56:25] effort I see your desire hey you're
[56:26] doing a good job we're getting close but
[56:29] when it comes to the sound off is
[56:33] off let's see if we can get a little
[56:40] closer let's go a little
[56:45] closer let's go a little closer
[56:58] so here we're about just over one Hertz
[57:01] difference one Hertz out of 440 Herz I'm
[57:04] about 1.2 off so we're just about one
[57:09] Hertz different one cycle difference
[57:11] between this and this out of scale of
[57:17] 440 whoa whoa
[57:21] whoa it still ain't
[57:23] right and you can tell
[57:26] yeah it may not look like much on paper
[57:30] it may not be a big deal on a lot of
[57:31] other things but the bride is going to
[57:34] stand on the word and the word
[57:37] only this is what God is growing us to
[57:41] this is what God is bringing us to this
[57:44] is where God wants us to be aligned with
[57:46] his word now don't get me wrong don't
[57:49] think brother Chad to never make a
[57:51] mistake I'm not talking about that but
[57:52] I'm talking about coming into an
[57:53] agreement with the word God is bringing
[57:55] us into agreement so that she will be
[57:59] him amen this is what the prophet told
[58:02] us he told us in so many ways she will
[58:04] be him she is his body Jesus Christ in
[58:06] the formation of his bride this is the
[58:08] goal in the end time this is the
[58:10] Capstone coming onto the New Testament
[58:12] Church so the bride will be in his very
[58:14] image and his very likeness so that when
[58:16] you strike
[58:20] both it's the
[58:23] same the word and her
[58:27] is the
[58:27] same the
[58:29] word
[58:31] preached and the word
[58:34] lived
[58:35] [Music]
[58:37] match when the message preaches the word
[58:41] we hear the prophet giving a certain
[58:43] sound and he's preaching to us the true
[58:46] interpretation of the word with Divine
[58:47] Vindication he's brought us back to
[58:51] 440a so that we can tune to
[58:54] this so that we know what the standard
[58:57] is we know what the Mark is we know what
[58:59] the word is amen this is he's restored
[59:01] to us the truth that was lost amen back
[59:04] to the faith of the original fathers
[59:06] he's brought us back to to a at 440
[59:09] Hertz amen so this is what's
[59:15] preached but sometimes what's lived
[59:18] doesn't match what's
[59:20] preached and this is what gives an
[59:22] uncertain sound Hey listen and we've all
[59:25] been here this is where we've been
[59:26] trying to grow from amen none of us want
[59:29] this but we recognize we've had it in
[59:30] our lives amen and we don't like it it
[59:33] upsets us it disgusts us I don't want to
[59:35] be like this amen but what I'm going to
[59:37] have to do I'm just going to have to
[59:38] stay under the washing of the water of
[59:41] the word and not be influenced by
[59:43] another person like this but be
[59:45] influenced by the word that's
[59:49] this and as I hear
[59:52] it I'll go back and live it
[59:56] a nope God Wash Me by the water of the
[1:00:00] word and maybe make a little adjustment
[1:00:03] in life and God opens our eyes to
[1:00:05] something and we surrender something to
[1:00:07] him and then we hear the word
[1:00:11] preached oh God I'm so sorry is this our
[1:00:17] life that's is the way I live I didn't
[1:00:20] like the way that sounded Lord I'm so
[1:00:22] sorry I didn't like the way that
[1:00:24] happened and sometimes you don't catch
[1:00:25] it till you reflect back and know God I
[1:00:28] why did I say that that way why did I do
[1:00:30] that why did I oh God I'm so sorry and
[1:00:33] then we come back and we know this is
[1:00:36] right we know it we know it we know it
[1:00:39] we know it we know it we know it's right
[1:00:41] amen and we think this is
[1:00:43] [Music]
[1:00:49] right how many of you have perfect pitch
[1:00:52] and could tell the difference between 1
[1:00:54] 2% no
[1:00:56] when you don't have a
[1:00:58] reference this sounds
[1:01:01] great it's in the range of
[1:01:04] a it's on a scale a it's like a message
[1:01:08] believer it's a a a a it sounds good
[1:01:12] sounds good sounds good and as long as I
[1:01:16] come to another brother that's tuned the
[1:01:18] same way amen and he goes and then he
[1:01:22] goes H I'm like oh yeah we're the same
[1:01:26] yeah because we're the same we're
[1:01:31] okay I wish I had another de Bob but I
[1:01:34] only got one in my little kit here
[1:01:36] because I'd like to tune these the same
[1:01:38] and show you that just because they're
[1:01:41] the same doesn't mean they're
[1:01:43] right just because you can come to a
[1:01:46] church where everybody in the church
[1:01:48] sounds the same it doesn't make it a at
[1:01:51] 440
[1:01:54] Hertz it's only only a at 440 HZ when
[1:01:58] it's a at 440
[1:02:02] Hertz so everybody sounds like this my
[1:02:05] mom my dad my pastor the deacons my best
[1:02:12] friend and we all sound good together
[1:02:15] and when we all do it together it's
[1:02:18] beautiful it's
[1:02:19] a and it is a but this is perfect a
[1:02:25] this is a this is perfect
[1:02:29] a so we all get together and we all like
[1:02:32] the way we sound together and when we're
[1:02:33] all living our Christian Life and we're
[1:02:35] all message Believers in a it's
[1:02:39] beautiful till we play a
[1:02:43] tape
[1:02:44] oo still not
[1:02:47] right you see how perfect it was that
[1:02:50] God sent us a message to bring us back
[1:02:53] to a at 440 yeah you know why we have to
[1:02:57] keep listening to those tapes and keep
[1:02:59] listening to those tapes and keep coming
[1:03:01] together in fellowship and keep hearing
[1:03:02] the preaching of the word is because
[1:03:04] we've got to come to a at
[1:03:07] 4:40 now here's the reality of what's
[1:03:10] been going
[1:03:11] on and not a condemnation just a
[1:03:15] reality I wish I had another de
[1:03:18] Bob cuz what's been happening is the
[1:03:21] preacher's not been at a
[1:03:23] 440 and the congregation's not been at
[1:03:26] a440 and we're always make we're trying
[1:03:29] to get to
[1:03:31] a440 all right none of us needs to none
[1:03:35] of us needs to walk out of here and say
[1:03:38] I'm at
[1:03:41] a440 what you need to say is I want to
[1:03:44] be at
[1:03:46] a440 be
[1:03:48] careful be careful because you can be at
[1:03:52] a 435
[1:03:58] but we don't want to be at
[1:04:00] a435 this is not a close enough game I
[1:04:03] want to be him she will be him I want to
[1:04:08] get tuned up and tuned in and changed in
[1:04:11] whatever way I have to change and shave
[1:04:13] down and whatever is holding me back I
[1:04:15] need to have it removed friends this is
[1:04:18] why for 60 years for some for 60 years
[1:04:21] for me for 25 years what I've been doing
[1:04:24] is I've been saying God change me change
[1:04:26] me change me adjustment adjustment
[1:04:27] adjustment adjustment adjustment change
[1:04:29] me God because I want to be at 440a amen
[1:04:33] I got into a discussion one time with
[1:04:35] the minister and and the brother was
[1:04:38] telling me you have to be balanced
[1:04:40] brother Chad you have to be balanced in
[1:04:42] your approach to preaching I've shared
[1:04:43] this with you before you have to be
[1:04:45] balanced in your approach to preaching
[1:04:48] and I said well I agree with that
[1:04:49] brother remember said we should be
[1:04:50] balanced the problem is what's my
[1:04:54] reference for balance
[1:04:57] that's really
[1:04:58] important because if I believe that I'm
[1:05:02] balanced then I'm judging balance based
[1:05:05] off my perspective and my
[1:05:08] position right that's like me judging a
[1:05:12] perfect a by
[1:05:16] this you don't sound like me you're
[1:05:22] not and when I shared with the brothers
[1:05:25] I said you you know what
[1:05:26] brother the problem is I don't know if
[1:05:29] I'm balanced or
[1:05:31] not the reality is I don't know if I'm
[1:05:35] balanced if I'm off by two
[1:05:40] degrees but I think that I'm
[1:05:43] balanced then I judge
[1:05:46] everybody off two
[1:05:50] degrees so my judgment is no longer
[1:05:54] correct this is why we have to be
[1:05:56] careful how we judge one
[1:05:58] another very careful because if I'm off
[1:06:01] two degrees this way and you're off two
[1:06:04] degrees that way we both think each
[1:06:07] other's off but we don't realize we're
[1:06:09] both
[1:06:10] off you look at me and say that
[1:06:12] brother's pretty far off well I'm closer
[1:06:15] than you
[1:06:16] think because you're judging me four
[1:06:18] degrees away but I'm only 2°
[1:06:21] off do you understand if I'm 2° this way
[1:06:25] you're two let's say 10° I'm 10° this
[1:06:27] way you're 10° that way to you I'm way
[1:06:32] off to me your way off but we're both
[1:06:36] closer to Center than we
[1:06:38] realize that's why we got to be careful
[1:06:41] how we judge one another because the
[1:06:43] brother you're judging he's probably
[1:06:45] off but he may be closer than you
[1:06:48] realize and he may be closer than you
[1:06:53] are you understand I'm 10° off and he's
[1:06:56] 5 Dees off he's closer to right than I
[1:06:59] am but to me he's way off amen but he's
[1:07:02] closer than I
[1:07:03] [Music]
[1:07:04] am so I can no longer reference where
[1:07:08] everybody else is based off me I can
[1:07:10] only reference it by the word the word
[1:07:14] the word a440 the message that God give
[1:07:17] us it's the thing we're all trying to
[1:07:19] line up to every one of us are trying to
[1:07:21] get to a440 a that's God's goal for his
[1:07:25] bride and this day that's what he's
[1:07:27] trying to accomplish in Us in this day
[1:07:29] is
[1:07:30] a440 amen amen so it's a big problem
[1:07:36] friends when we don't have a reference
[1:07:39] point yes so for years we're going
[1:07:43] through
[1:07:44] adjustments is anybody going through
[1:07:50] adjustments I hope my a sounds more like
[1:07:53] it did when I
[1:07:56] cuz I thought I was a but I realize now
[1:07:58] that I was G
[1:08:03] sharp I didn't know it then but I know
[1:08:05] it now cuz I've gotten closer to
[1:08:08] a and the problem is here's the next
[1:08:11] thing I really don't know how far off I
[1:08:15] am yes I just know I'm
[1:08:19] off I don't know but I trust one thing
[1:08:24] God sent an a440 for a
[1:08:28] reason God gave us something to tune by
[1:08:31] if I want to tune a piano I can use a440
[1:08:35] a to tune a piano if I want to tune a
[1:08:37] guitar I can use an a440 a to tune a
[1:08:40] guitar if I want a tune a cello I can
[1:08:42] use an a440 to tune a cello is that
[1:08:47] right God gave us an a440 A so that we
[1:08:51] could get tuned into God's frequency
[1:08:57] so let's say we go
[1:08:58] back
[1:09:00] to thinking we're an
[1:09:03] A or a G
[1:09:06] sharp giving an uncertain sound when
[1:09:09] played against a440 it really begins to
[1:09:12] show how far off I am but you know what
[1:09:15] the reality is I am still inside an
[1:09:21] a44 I was cast as an a44
[1:09:26] I was fashioned to be in a440 a
[1:09:29] something along the way got attached to
[1:09:31] me that is not part of the original
[1:09:35] mold and guess what something got
[1:09:37] attached to you and you and you and you
[1:09:39] and you and you and you amen something
[1:09:42] got attached to us that wasn't part of
[1:09:43] the original and we've been striving our
[1:09:45] whole lives to get all the attachments
[1:09:47] off all the wrong understanding all the
[1:09:50] wrong doctrines all the complexes all
[1:09:52] the fears all the things that cause us
[1:09:54] to resonate back amen the wrong kind of
[1:09:57] frequency that's giving an uncertain
[1:09:59] sound and God by his purging and the
[1:10:01] washing of the water of the word is
[1:10:03] promised us in this day that he can wash
[1:10:06] all of the things away every Dilly bob
[1:10:08] every thing ofama every doad
[1:10:11] everything that got attached to us
[1:10:13] whether our parents put on us or another
[1:10:14] preacher put it on or a church put it on
[1:10:16] us or whatever however it got there
[1:10:18] whether we put it on ourselves by our
[1:10:20] own foolish decisions God has a washing
[1:10:23] of the water of the word that'll wash
[1:10:25] away everything that's not the
[1:10:30] original so that we can come back to
[1:10:33] being what we were predestinated to be
[1:10:37] we were predestinated to
[1:10:41] be
[1:10:44] [Music]
[1:10:46] a440 this is where we're coming to this
[1:10:50] is our destination this is the goal this
[1:10:54] is why we pray this is why we fast this
[1:10:56] is why we come to church this is why we
[1:10:58] read the books this is why we listen to
[1:11:00] the tapes this is why we rub shoulders
[1:11:03] with each other so iron can sharpen an
[1:11:05] iron this is why amen we have knockdowns
[1:11:08] and beatdowns and blessings and all
[1:11:10] kinds of things because we're getting
[1:11:12] tuned up to play
[1:11:14] a440 and we get we get knocked about and
[1:11:17] we have all kinds of things that are
[1:11:19] going wrong but what God is trying to
[1:11:21] get us to do is realize I was always
[1:11:24] meant to be this this is what he
[1:11:26] intended from the very beginning this is
[1:11:29] me in my original
[1:11:32] form things got attached to it that
[1:11:35] shouldn't have been there amen but God's
[1:11:37] moving all the attachments away until
[1:11:39] finally at the end of it all when we can
[1:11:41] finally ring out a440 the last de Bob to
[1:11:44] come off is this flesh when these atoms
[1:11:47] change amen so that we can resonate Body
[1:11:50] Soul and Spirit the right tone the right
[1:11:53] sound and the right note
[1:11:56] amen this this this analogy Works in so
[1:11:59] many places in our lives if we look at
[1:12:01] this in a
[1:12:04] home if Mom's
[1:12:07] here and Dad's
[1:12:11] here it just ain't
[1:12:14] right it just ain't
[1:12:16] right if my brother's here and I'm
[1:12:20] here it just ain't right
[1:12:26] we can hear
[1:12:28] it you don't even need me to pull up the
[1:12:31] the tuner you know it's off in a
[1:12:35] marriage when it gets off it's just
[1:12:39] off everyone around you knows it it's
[1:12:41] just
[1:12:42] off your fellowship with a brother when
[1:12:44] it gets off it's just off the
[1:12:47] relationships around is when they're off
[1:12:48] they're just off they don't give the
[1:12:51] right tone what we need is to get
[1:12:53] whatever is attached out of the way we
[1:12:57] need to get tuned up we need to get
[1:12:59] brought back into what God originally so
[1:13:02] our marriage is
[1:13:06] this our fellowship is
[1:13:09] this our expression is
[1:13:13] this the headship of Christ the body of
[1:13:17] the
[1:13:18] Bride the
[1:13:20] word the life amen
[1:13:27] comes to a
[1:13:29] place
[1:13:41] where tell you can't tell the
[1:13:46] difference is that what the prophet said
[1:13:48] he's doing in this day he's getting to
[1:13:51] the place where she will be so much like
[1:13:53] him she will be
[1:13:58] him and I am
[1:14:01] confident that God gave us an
[1:14:04] a440 so that we all can tune up to that
[1:14:09] sound we should we should be in the
[1:14:11] message more than we ever were
[1:14:14] before we should be in that word
[1:14:17] constantly because it's it's the tuning
[1:14:20] fork to match our lives too we should be
[1:14:23] in the scripture in the the message in
[1:14:26] Fellowship in the word every opportunity
[1:14:28] we've got getting as close as we can so
[1:14:31] that we begin to resonate back this word
[1:14:34] and this word only until in the end of
[1:14:36] it all the bride is resonating not oh my
[1:14:40] goodness where she's resonating
[1:14:43] 44A right till the word
[1:14:50] strikes and the bride lives
[1:14:55] and then there's no
[1:14:57] difference between the
[1:14:59] two she is the
[1:15:09] word think of it this way when the
[1:15:12] word's
[1:15:15] preached what comes off of
[1:15:17] that it's sound waves air is
[1:15:21] moving take the air as the Holy Spirit
[1:15:26] the word is preached the spirit moves
[1:15:29] the spirit strikes your soul and when
[1:15:32] the spirit strikes your
[1:15:34] soul guess what comes out of
[1:15:37] you
[1:15:39] a440 by what mechanism not because this
[1:15:43] touched that not because this touched
[1:15:46] that but because the spirit of the word
[1:15:49] touched your soul and when the spirit of
[1:15:52] the word comes into your soul you begin
[1:15:55] to resonate a440 because this and this
[1:16:00] are the same because the word and you
[1:16:04] what you what was intended to be you the
[1:16:06] C Gene of God and you are the
[1:16:11] same so now when you come down to the
[1:16:14] end of it which one's the
[1:16:19] word what differentiates them what's
[1:16:23] different what's different between the
[1:16:25] word and the
[1:16:27] bride at the end of it all when it's all
[1:16:30] capped off when God finally has the
[1:16:31] expression he wants he's got a people on
[1:16:33] Earth that's submitted and surrendered
[1:16:35] to him that'll stand on his word and his
[1:16:37] word only and the word is alive in him
[1:16:39] what becomes the difference it's the
[1:16:42] same sound it's the same expression it's
[1:16:45] the same manifestation it becomes the
[1:16:48] same
[1:16:50] thing that's what the prophet has taught
[1:16:53] us
[1:16:55] that's what I want more than anything in
[1:16:57] this world I want to play an
[1:17:00] a440 I want to be correct I want to be
[1:17:04] tuned up I want to be part of this word
[1:17:06] I want to be the
[1:17:09] word amen I want to look at just I want
[1:17:12] to wrap up here I'm just going to read a
[1:17:13] couple couple things to you and then
[1:17:16] we'll
[1:17:18] finish says
[1:17:25] brother B tells this uh story here
[1:17:29] actually I want to read this scripture
[1:17:30] and then I'll go to the story let's go
[1:17:31] to Matthew
[1:17:48] 11 Matthew
[1:17:51] 11 16
[1:17:57] in Matthew
[1:17:59] 11:16 he says but where unto shall I
[1:18:03] liken this generation it is like unto
[1:18:06] children sitting in the markets calling
[1:18:08] unto their fellows and saying we have
[1:18:10] piped unto you and you have not danced
[1:18:13] we have mourned unto you and you have
[1:18:15] not lamented it's an interesting
[1:18:17] scripture and there's a reason I used it
[1:18:19] what he's saying is you gave no
[1:18:22] response I piped to you and you didn't
[1:18:24] resp respond I I I mourned and you
[1:18:27] didn't lay me what what's he saying that
[1:18:30] you didn't respond to the call there was
[1:18:32] nothing in you to respond I piped and
[1:18:34] you didn't dance let that not be us amen
[1:18:36] the message is piping let's dance let's
[1:18:38] respond let's have something inside of
[1:18:40] us that responds to the sound to the
[1:18:43] voice of God Amen and so I want to if I
[1:18:48] could read
[1:18:50] this here in the message
[1:18:53] Fellowship from 55 brother B's talking
[1:18:56] about radio waves and how radio waves
[1:18:58] are passing through the room right now
[1:18:59] they're invisible there's voices moving
[1:19:01] through here but you cannot hear them
[1:19:03] says the radio coming through the air
[1:19:04] the words we can't hear them with our
[1:19:06] ears we can't pick it up but the crystal
[1:19:09] in the radio picks it up the television
[1:19:12] the same it becomes positive and when
[1:19:14] our intellectual faith comes down into
[1:19:15] the heart and becomes so charged with
[1:19:17] the Unseen World that every word of God
[1:19:19] becomes a positive truth you see what I
[1:19:21] mean when God says it it echoes against
[1:19:25] it just like it does on the crystal in
[1:19:27] the radio and makes it perfect so
[1:19:29] brother B uses this this analogy many
[1:19:32] times with a radio or TV there's waves
[1:19:34] that are moving through the air amen you
[1:19:36] can't see them you can't hear them you
[1:19:38] can't touch them there has to be
[1:19:40] something designed to receive those
[1:19:42] waves and when that something designed
[1:19:45] receives those waves what it does is it
[1:19:47] takes the waves through a mechanism that
[1:19:49] was engineered and prepared ahead of
[1:19:51] time to pick up the waves it now
[1:19:53] converts the waves and begin to speak
[1:19:55] back what the waves say not a different
[1:19:58] voice not a new voice they don't change
[1:20:00] it whatsoever so that whatever was
[1:20:02] coming through the Airways when it
[1:20:04] strikes the crystal it's reproduced into
[1:20:06] the ears of The Listener amen what could
[1:20:09] not be heard now is heard Amen in the TV
[1:20:12] what could not be seen now is seen well
[1:20:14] I tell you friends there's an unseen
[1:20:16] Force that's been Unleashed now and it's
[1:20:18] the very spirit of God and the world
[1:20:20] can't see it amen but we've got a
[1:20:22] crystal that can pick it up on the
[1:20:23] inside and what are we designed to do we
[1:20:26] are God's television set we're here Amen
[1:20:29] to replicate the image that nobody else
[1:20:32] can
[1:20:34] see Jesus Christ is not still in the
[1:20:36] body of Flesh walking on the Sea of
[1:20:38] Galilee that he can't be touched the
[1:20:40] woman with the blood issue Can't Touch
[1:20:42] the Hem of His Garment the blind man
[1:20:44] can't ask him to spit in clay anymore
[1:20:46] they can't touch that amen but that
[1:20:48] unseen life is still here amen it's
[1:20:51] still moving but there's Crystal sets
[1:20:53] here there's people amen with something
[1:20:54] inside that can pick it up and when they
[1:20:57] pick it up what are they going to
[1:20:58] replicate not a new picture not a
[1:21:00] different picture not a distorted
[1:21:02] picture but the same picture from The
[1:21:05] Unseen now in
[1:21:08] manifestation amen we talk about the
[1:21:10] word amen the word is a person the word
[1:21:13] is a life amen the word has a spirit
[1:21:15] amen the world can't see the word amen
[1:21:18] you can talk you can point Amen to to
[1:21:20] Ink on paper but that's not seeing the
[1:21:22] word amen that's seeing words but not
[1:21:24] the word nobody can see the word amen
[1:21:28] the only way the world will see the word
[1:21:30] is when the word strikes something that
[1:21:33] can receive the word and it translates
[1:21:35] amen through a mechanism that can be
[1:21:37] displayed or projected to the world and
[1:21:40] that happens to be our life amen our
[1:21:43] bodies as it's surrendered to God can
[1:21:45] now manifest the very life of Jesus
[1:21:47] Christ so that the Unseen Force becomes
[1:21:50] tangible visible Amen on Earth again
[1:21:55] amen when that gets tuned
[1:21:58] in amen
[1:22:01] amen I am not a very old
[1:22:04] person but I remember things from the
[1:22:06] past that people think are
[1:22:11] old I remember as a boy having a
[1:22:13] television with the bunny ears you know
[1:22:15] no cable
[1:22:16] but amen and remember how you had to
[1:22:19] tune it a little bit to get the signal
[1:22:22] just right
[1:22:25] because you had to get the frequency
[1:22:27] just right to get the picture clear and
[1:22:29] it would be a little bit fuzzy you could
[1:22:30] tell there's something there and I could
[1:22:32] pretty much yeah this is the show that
[1:22:34] I'm looking for but then you've got a
[1:22:36] little adjustment and you got to tune it
[1:22:37] to so that you're you're matched to the
[1:22:40] frequency and when you match the
[1:22:41] frequency it becomes clear and you see
[1:22:43] the picture listen we're picking up the
[1:22:46] signal but I'm asking God to tune the
[1:22:48] dial because I want to give the right
[1:22:50] projection of what's coming and when the
[1:22:52] dial gets tuned in what's the difference
[1:22:55] between the Unseen force and what people
[1:22:57] see it's the word coming and the word
[1:23:00] expressed the word invisible and the
[1:23:02] word
[1:23:03] visible when God's done with this she
[1:23:06] will be the
[1:23:10] word
[1:23:12] amen you say how far away are we brother
[1:23:15] Chad I have no
[1:23:17] idea I just know that when it Tings
[1:23:20] sometimes it just still doesn't sound
[1:23:22] right getting close but the just to me
[1:23:25] there's got to be there's got to be some
[1:23:27] more
[1:23:29] tuneup I don't I don't ever want to get
[1:23:32] to the place where I'm sitting here
[1:23:35] saying I've got it I'm bride I'm this
[1:23:38] I'm that amen and and putting out a
[1:23:40] fuzzy picture where people can't even is
[1:23:42] that Jesus or is it not Jesus
[1:23:45] I I'm trying to see between all the
[1:23:48] fuzzy lines and the distorted picture
[1:23:50] Twisted is that Jesus or is that
[1:23:55] and I want be walking around saying I'm
[1:23:57] bride I'm this and people are looking at
[1:23:59] that kind of a
[1:24:01] picture it doesn't mean I'm wrong it
[1:24:04] doesn't mean I'm not it doesn't mean I'm
[1:24:06] not the receiver said it doesn't mean I
[1:24:07] don't have the right
[1:24:10] signal everything's right I'm the one
[1:24:13] who's made to project it I've got the
[1:24:15] crystal on the inside the tube is in me
[1:24:17] that can pick it up I'm catching the
[1:24:20] right signal the right signal is coming
[1:24:21] into me from the message I'm the one
[1:24:23] predestined at and engineered and
[1:24:25] designed to do it but I'm just not tuned
[1:24:28] up exactly right I'm really close but
[1:24:31] just tune me up and I don't want ever
[1:24:32] get to the place where I don't realize I
[1:24:34] still need some tuning up because then
[1:24:36] I'll refuse to hear the word as a tuning
[1:24:39] fork I'll hear it as my Vindication and
[1:24:41] say I'm right I'm with that and not even
[1:24:43] know that everyone around me is hearing
[1:24:45] wah wah wah wah wah wah
[1:24:50] wah because when it's off it's off yeah
[1:24:54] amen amen when it's off it's
[1:24:59] off but God's going to get it
[1:25:02] on cuz he's
[1:25:04] promised he
[1:25:06] will and I believe we're the generation
[1:25:09] that's going to see it but it's not
[1:25:11] going to come by arrogance it's not
[1:25:12] going to come by Pride it's not going to
[1:25:14] come by self assurance it's going to
[1:25:16] come by staying close to that tuning
[1:25:18] fork all the time and saying God I want
[1:25:20] to be what that
[1:25:22] is make me your your word tune Me Up
[1:25:25] Lord change me and be willing to
[1:25:27] recognize yeah I need some
[1:25:31] work I need some work I need some things
[1:25:35] taken off my tuning
[1:25:37] fork got a complex here that causes me
[1:25:40] always to react to Authority this way I
[1:25:43] can't trust people I get angry whenever
[1:25:46] I I feel like somebody's hurting my
[1:25:48] feelings I've reserved and I don't want
[1:25:50] to talk to anybody because I've been
[1:25:51] hurt before and all of these little
[1:25:53] things that got attached to us along the
[1:25:57] way I don't want to say that's just the
[1:26:00] way that I
[1:26:02] am because the way that I'm intended to
[1:26:05] be is what he predestinated me to be not
[1:26:09] what not what somebody's attached to me
[1:26:11] and I'm caring and have to live with
[1:26:13] that's not God's purpose for
[1:26:16] me if it's obstructing me if it's
[1:26:19] stopping me from giving a clear sound if
[1:26:21] it's hindering me from ringing a true
[1:26:23] manifestation of Jesus Christ then it's
[1:26:25] got to go it's got to go and I believe
[1:26:28] it will go by the washing of the water
[1:26:30] of the word staying in by the tuning
[1:26:33] fork and willing to be adjusted and
[1:26:35] adjusted and adjusted and adjusted
[1:26:38] again amen I remember one time when
[1:26:40] Blake was learning to play the uh
[1:26:42] mandolin I think it was he was playing
[1:26:45] and we watched the the we we looked up
[1:26:47] on a video on how to I don't know I
[1:26:50] don't remember what it was I think it
[1:26:51] was a workshop somebody was doing on
[1:26:54] playing the mandolin so I was watching
[1:26:55] that with them and after every song they
[1:26:58] tuned their instrument
[1:27:00] again after every song they tuned the
[1:27:03] instrument again and when you're
[1:27:04] watching this it's really boring
[1:27:07] tingting tingting tingting Ting tingting
[1:27:11] and when you just wanted to play another
[1:27:13] song you're just
[1:27:14] like and the guy stopped and he said
[1:27:18] somebody asked me one time am I obsessed
[1:27:21] with tuning
[1:27:24] cuz that's kind of what I was thinking
[1:27:25] you got a problem you're OCD you are you
[1:27:30] obsessed with
[1:27:31] tuning and he he he he confessed that he
[1:27:34] doesn't even enjoy the process of tuning
[1:27:36] he likes playing his instrument he says
[1:27:38] I'm not obsessed with tuning I'm
[1:27:40] obsessed with being in
[1:27:42] [Music]
[1:27:44] tune praise
[1:27:46] Lord I think we should get obsessed with
[1:27:49] being in
[1:27:51] tune why are you constantly analyzing
[1:27:53] your life why are you constantly praying
[1:27:55] why are you constantly allowing uh why
[1:27:57] are you constantly sitting there taking
[1:27:59] correction from the pit why are you
[1:28:00] listening to that tape again why are you
[1:28:02] saying you're sorry to me again why are
[1:28:04] you going back and confessing something
[1:28:06] you've done why are you trying to make
[1:28:08] something right why because I'm obsessed
[1:28:10] with being in
[1:28:12] tune I want to be obsessed with being in
[1:28:15] tune with him because that's where I'm
[1:28:17] living that's the day that we live in
[1:28:19] that's the objective that's why God sent
[1:28:21] a message that's why God gave us
[1:28:23] something to reference off
[1:28:26] of listen he wouldn't have supplied it
[1:28:28] if it wasn't the day to be a perfect
[1:28:33] day he gave a perfect day in the season
[1:28:36] for a perfect
[1:28:38] day and I I don't know if you've ever
[1:28:41] tuned to guitar like I said I'm no no
[1:28:43] musician but when my kids were little
[1:28:46] and they were first learning stuff they
[1:28:47] would always say Dad can you help me
[1:28:48] with this Dad I don't know how to do
[1:28:49] this and dad doesn't have a clue what
[1:28:52] he's doing so we just have to watch a
[1:28:53] video and we have to try it and then we
[1:28:55] have to get frustrated and so then you
[1:28:57] get the little tuning app on your phone
[1:28:59] and you tune it and it's and it's flat
[1:29:01] okay it's flat and you tighten it it's
[1:29:03] flat it's tighten it and then ping it
[1:29:06] pops and now you're way
[1:29:09] sharp now you loosen it and then you
[1:29:12] loosen it nothing

[1:30:10] life we've been put here to ring a true
[1:30:14] sound not an uncertain sound a true ring
[1:30:18] of the word a true tone that matches
[1:30:21] this Bible so that when you pluck this
[1:30:23] Bible and you pluck lives what do you
[1:30:25] get it's the New Testament that's all
[1:30:28] what is the word bride that's the New

[1:36:23] what you will do for you've
[1:36:25] predestinated your bride not to fail in
[1:36:28] the end
[1:36:29] time God you already spoke through the
[1:36:31] mouth of a prophet that this end time
[1:36:33] bride will be so much like you that she
[1:36:35] will be
[1:36:38] you God it's an impossible order it's an
[1:36:41] impossible task for us to accomplish on
[1:36:42] our own but you've given us every
[1:36:46] tool you've given us a true tone to
[1:36:50] follow a perfect day you've given us the
[1:36:53] washing of the water of the word you've
[1:36:56] given us a conductor here your holy
[1:36:58] ghost that will help us you've given us
[1:37:00] an understanding of the Sheep music
[1:37:02] you've given everything we
[1:37:04] need now all we need to do is surrender
[1:37:08] and let you keep working on us so that
[1:37:10] we can become what you intended us to be
[1:37:13] we love you father I'm asking God that
[1:37:16] you bring us Lord into that Perfect
[1:37:18] Image that you had of us before the
[1:37:20] foundation of the world and we trust
[1:37:22] that you will
[1:37:24] as we keep listening to that perfect
[1:37:27] tone we love you God we ask your
[1:37:29] blessings over your people as we part in
[1:37:32] Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:37:36] amen may God may God bless you as you go
[1:37:39] and I want to encourage you with just
[1:37:41] two thoughts if you could leave here
[1:37:44] just with two things that become part of
[1:37:46] your understanding part of your
[1:37:48] vocabulary
[1:37:50] one I don't know if I'm balanced or not
[1:37:53] not but I'm seeking
[1:37:58] balance that's honest friends I'm
[1:38:01] seeking
[1:38:02] balance where we get in error is when we
[1:38:05] believe we're already balanced if we
[1:38:08] believe that as a church as a ministry
[1:38:10] as individuals we're going to find
[1:38:12] ourselves sidelined somewhere off the
[1:38:15] mark But if we could have the attitude I
[1:38:18] don't know if I'm balanced if I'm off I
[1:38:20] don't even know how far off I really am
[1:38:23] but I am seeking balance with all that's
[1:38:26] in
[1:38:30] me if we could walk away with that
[1:38:35] understanding I don't know if I'm in
[1:38:38] tune or
[1:38:41] not but I am
[1:38:45] obsessed with being in
[1:38:47] tune if you could walk out of here those
[1:38:50] those two thoughts I'm obsessed with
[1:38:53] being in
[1:38:54] tune and I don't know if I'm balanced or
[1:38:57] not but I'm seeking balance and let
[1:39:00] those two things Drive our life I think
[1:39:02] we're going to get a lot further ahead a
[1:39:04] lot
[1:39:05] faster I think we're going to reach that
[1:39:08] destination I know we're going to reach
[1:39:09] that destination but I want to reach it
[1:39:11] with a fewer hiccups than what I've had
[1:39:13] in the
[1:39:14] past amen God bless you all may God be
