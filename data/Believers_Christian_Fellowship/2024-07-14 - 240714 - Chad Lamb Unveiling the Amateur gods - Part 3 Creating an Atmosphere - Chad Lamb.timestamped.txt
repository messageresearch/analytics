[16:53] very welcome and we thank God that
[16:55] you're with us this
[16:56] morning amen as we look into to Genesis
[16:59] CH 5 let's just read the first two
[17:02] verses
[17:03] together this is the book of the
[17:05] generations of Adam in the day that God
[17:08] created man in the likeness of God made
[17:10] he him male and female created he them
[17:13] and blessed them and called their name
[17:14] Adam in the day when they were created
[17:18] and God bless you as you have your seats
[17:20] this
[17:24] morning like I said we're going to
[17:26] continue
[17:27] on uh with the same thought but I'd just
[17:30] like to address one thing as we get
[17:32] started as many of you know that there
[17:34] was an assassination attempt yesterday
[17:37] on the life of former president Donald
[17:39] Trump and I don't know if you saw that
[17:41] in the news yet or not but I heard about
[17:43] it and I I verified that it was true and
[17:45] it was it was shocking absolutely
[17:47] shocking and um and it's a disappointing
[17:51] place that we're
[17:52] at not just in this country in the world
[17:56] it's a discouragement and a
[17:58] disappointment and it's wrong in every
[17:59] which way and um and when I looked at it
[18:03] what was really heartbreaking to me is
[18:05] that this sort of thing would happen and
[18:07] it's it's it's devastating but what
[18:10] began to really affect me was when I
[18:12] realized that it was one person in the
[18:14] crowd there that got killed by a stray
[18:17] bullet one person was killed two others
[18:19] were critically injured former president
[18:22] Donald Trump was injured as well and
[18:24] then the shooter was also killed and I
[18:26] thought what an absolute travesty
[18:29] and and and ironically I don't know if
[18:32] it's ironically but providentially I
[18:34] should say this was tied in very much
[18:37] with what I was studying uh for the last
[18:39] couple days and what was on my heart I
[18:41] actually was having a a bit of a
[18:43] struggle as normal and I normally have a
[18:45] struggle to get things lined up in my
[18:47] own understanding and try to catch the
[18:48] inspiration and line it out and say what
[18:51] was in my heart there was three things
[18:53] that were converging three different
[18:54] thoughts and and I was just uh uh
[18:57] dwelling on them and going back and
[18:58] forth and looking at quotes and
[18:59] scriptures and and I had come to a vein
[19:02] of thought and IID started to to to
[19:04] Really labor in that and when a news
[19:07] came and I and I looked at the report I
[19:08] think it was 11 11:30 last night when I
[19:11] actually looked it up and uh it hit me
[19:14] that this is so tied into to what is on
[19:17] my heart today to talk about not an
[19:20] assassination attempt but what I really
[19:23] would like to speak on is the creative
[19:26] power of the sons of God and and and
[19:29] really when we get down to it we want to
[19:31] talk about the power we have to create
[19:33] an
[19:34] atmosphere and when we think of man man
[19:37] that was made in God's image and we know
[19:39] there's a corruption that came into man
[19:41] through
[19:42] hybridization but nonetheless what God
[19:45] had begun in flesh had continued on and
[19:47] and brother Brenham makes some
[19:49] statements I'm going to read some quotes
[19:50] as we go along and start to maybe just
[19:52] share with you my thought as it develops
[19:56] um it says in uh the message from that
[19:58] time he said he's a great
[20:00] contractor before he ever had a human
[20:02] being on the earth he laid out the
[20:04] material like a Contractor Building A A
[20:07] A subdivision he was going to make man
[20:09] in his own image and give them the Earth
[20:11] to stay and they were lesser Gods than
[20:14] he was so God's desire was to have as
[20:17] we've talked about before to have H an
[20:20] earth inhabited with sons and daughters
[20:22] and he laid out the material for our
[20:23] bodies as he began to begin to form us
[20:26] out of the Dust of the earth and bring
[20:28] us into into life and a manifestation
[20:30] and and the original intent was that
[20:32] they would all be Sons and Daughters of
[20:34] God a reflection of God uh fleshing out
[20:38] reflecting the very life of their father
[20:40] on Earth and we know hybridization threw
[20:43] that off there was a corruption through
[20:45] the through the beguilement of the
[20:46] serpent with Eve and and there was a
[20:48] wrong seed sewn and an intermingling and
[20:51] it brought corruption to God's plan but
[20:54] nonetheless the traces are still in
[20:56] humanity and Brother venham Talks about
[20:59] that he says um if I could find it here
[21:03] yeah he says in the message the Messiah
[21:06] says now he's made in the image and
[21:07] likeness of God when God made him God
[21:10] give him some of his Spirit part of his
[21:12] life and he's in the likeness in the
[21:14] image of God therefore uh man in his in
[21:17] his natural condition the way we are now
[21:20] you can see that he's much more than an
[21:22] animal as they try to say we are because
[21:25] man in his Fallen estate yet being a
[21:28] fallen Son of God he still can better
[21:30] himself he has an intelligence he builds
[21:33] himself a better house living conditions
[21:35] He makes himself better travel
[21:37] conditions he can speed himself through
[21:38] the air now 1900 M hour in a jet plane
[21:41] or a rocket and he starts talking about
[21:43] going into space and the satellites and
[21:46] and and the man going into orbit and all
[21:47] the things that man's achieved and he
[21:49] says he's smart intelligent he's made up
[21:53] in the image and likeness of God and in
[21:55] him is light so he begins to show us
[21:59] that God had originally made man amen to
[22:02] to reflect his image to be in His image
[22:04] he put him in a body of Flesh upon the
[22:06] Earth to reflect God upon the Earth and
[22:09] and and he says you know brother's
[22:12] alluding to the fact that they believe
[22:13] in evolution where man just came as a
[22:16] higher form of evolved animal but he
[22:18] says man is so much different than
[22:20] animal he's different all together
[22:23] because he has a way in which to think
[22:25] and be creative and better himself and
[22:27] create he creates music and he creates
[22:29] art and I'm just talking about Fallen
[22:31] man not not the not the children of God
[22:33] but Fallen man he creates art he creates
[22:36] music uh he builds he constructs in him
[22:39] is in him is to be a a little Creator he
[22:43] wants to create things and build things
[22:45] and make things and invent things and
[22:46] better things and and we know the
[22:48] devil's gotten into that and he's
[22:50] manipulated it and used it to build his
[22:52] own
[22:53] kingdom and now we live in Satan's Eden
[22:55] where he's manipulated this ability and
[22:57] desire and man and bringing a wrong
[22:59] influence he's got man to achieve for
[23:01] his own glorification he's got man to
[23:04] make achievements for himself for pride
[23:06] and for or for pride and for greed and
[23:09] for all of these lust of the Flesh and
[23:11] he's used that and diverted all of that
[23:13] godlikeness that's in man to use it to
[23:16] build Satan's
[23:18] kingdom but yet it it doesn't change the
[23:21] fact that it's there that man is a
[23:24] Creator desires to create and better
[23:26] himself so he's not created in the same
[23:28] fashion as animals it's not a higher
[23:30] evolved State it's a different creation
[23:33] altogether we know in the hybridization
[23:36] it's it's actually been reduced Amen in
[23:39] power and authority but but God is
[23:41] trying to bring that back and so he was
[23:45] made to be a Lesser God upon the Earth
[23:48] and we read this quote before I'd like
[23:49] to read it again referring to the sons
[23:51] of God it says let me before we go any
[23:53] further go back Genesis 1:26 I'll pick
[23:56] it up Wednesday uh before he made man he
[23:59] called himself El Ella Elohim the word
[24:04] means in the Hebrew the self-existent
[24:06] all by himself nothing exists before him
[24:08] he was all the existence there ever was
[24:11] self-existence one Ella Elohim means the
[24:15] alls sufficient all powerful allmighty
[24:17] self-existent one but in Genesis 2 when
[24:21] he made man he he said I am Yahweh
[24:24] Jehovah what did he mean I am the all
[24:27] existent one who has created something
[24:29] off of myself to be a son of mine or a
[24:31] temporary or amateur little one of mine
[24:34] Oh Glory Jehovah means that he gave man
[24:37] to be an amateur God because he is a
[24:39] father God and he made a man an amateur
[24:41] God so he isn't self-existent anymore he
[24:44] exists with his family amen Ella uh
[24:48] Elohim now he's Jehovah Jehovah means
[24:51] the one who exists with his family now
[24:53] God made man to be the predominant over
[24:56] all the Earth he had a dominion and he
[24:58] Earth was man's Dominion is that
[24:59] scripture then if that's his Dominion he
[25:02] was God over the Earth he could speak
[25:04] and it would be so he could speak this
[25:06] and it would be so oh there he is god
[25:08] Jehovah the one who once existed in
[25:11] self-existence but now exists with his
[25:13] family his little ones there you are so
[25:16] there was God's intention and as God
[25:18] began to bring his family into
[25:20] Redemption he begins to reveal more of
[25:22] himself and his nature to man and he he
[25:24] brings a name to moses' understanding
[25:26] and that's the name of Jehovah amen and
[25:28] Jehovah is the self-existent one who
[25:29] begins to reveal himself and he reveals
[25:32] himself as a as a God who wants to have
[25:34] a family as a as a Creator who created
[25:37] man after his own image and because his
[25:39] intention was to have a family a god a
[25:42] god race a God's children God's family
[25:45] upon the Earth so now we live in we live
[25:48] in the remnants of that that's been
[25:50] corrupted and polluted and now has been
[25:53] has been taken for 6,000 years in the
[25:55] way of corruption and and degr ation but
[25:59] using the things that God put in man man
[26:02] has a self-will man has an in intellect
[26:04] he has an ability of self-determination
[26:07] he he has a creativity to him and a
[26:09] desire to grow and to create and to
[26:11] achieve and all of these things are
[26:13] there amen because they were they were
[26:15] found in God in some way or fashion and
[26:17] now they're they're here but they're in
[26:19] a perverted form amen and that's what
[26:23] that's what's being manipulated today
[26:27] but I don't want any of those things in
[26:28] me to be
[26:30] manipulated I want God to take
[26:33] control I want God to have absolute
[26:36] control and sway over me and move me and
[26:39] all of the attributes he placed in me
[26:41] and bring about his desired
[26:43] plan he
[26:45] says uh in Blasphemous names but God
[26:49] specially upon Adam breathed the breath
[26:51] of eternal life and he became an eternal
[26:54] person with God he had power like God he
[26:56] was an amateur God he was god of the
[26:58] earth not God Of Heaven now God of the
[27:01] earth and someday the sons of God will
[27:04] again become Gods man lost his right to
[27:07] Dominion to rulership to to godship he
[27:10] lost that amen when he gave up the title
[27:12] deed of redemption he gave up by leaving
[27:14] the word he lost his position amen but
[27:17] God has redeemed it back he's taken back
[27:19] the title deed book amen and he's
[27:21] brought it back into man and and someday
[27:23] we're going to see the fullness of that
[27:25] and we're going to move into a
[27:26] millennial Reign amen which is an Eden
[27:29] restored when the Son of God and his
[27:31] bride will once again Rule and Reign
[27:33] Over the entire Earth they will once
[27:36] again be Gods upon the Earth but we're
[27:38] in the stage now where God is bringing
[27:40] back back he's redeeming it he's
[27:41] bringing it back to full measure and
[27:44] here we stand in this
[27:47] position in the message why he says a
[27:49] man was made to be God to be a god do
[27:53] you know that he's in the image of God
[27:55] he's a Son of God he's like him he was
[27:58] given a domain Genesis 1:26 dominion
[28:00] over the whole earth that's right he
[28:03] Ruled the Earth he ruled the animal
[28:04] kingdom and all other kingdoms all but
[28:06] the kingdom of God above he was God he
[28:09] was an amateur God he was made in the
[28:11] image of God made like God had hands and
[28:13] feet like God he was in the image of God
[28:17] what happened because he disbelieved
[28:20] God's word it sent him right back to
[28:22] shift for himself now God's trying to
[28:24] bring him back and when you have faith
[28:27] and accept him my brother just let that
[28:29] little light begin to grow out taking
[28:31] all the roots of doubt and bitterness
[28:33] yielding yourself to the spirit then you
[28:35] begin to become a Son of God a daughter
[28:37] of God begin to grow in the grace of God
[28:41] the Holy Spirit begins to build his
[28:42] kingdom within you what's he doing he
[28:45] sent his Spirit what to rebuild us to
[28:47] bring us back to bring his kingdom back
[28:49] to bring us back to Sons and Daughters
[28:51] of God Amen we've seen this displayed uh
[28:55] uh we we know where we are in the
[28:57] Redemption cycle because God sent a
[28:59] prophet in this day to begin to unlock
[29:00] and understand we know that there's a
[29:03] lamb that's paid the price of redemption
[29:05] we know that he's taken the book the
[29:07] title deed of redemption amen we know
[29:09] that he's loosed the seals to reveal the
[29:11] Plan of Redemption to the man to bring
[29:13] back Sons and Daughters of God from
[29:15] their fallen State amen and we've seen
[29:17] God take one man under his control a
[29:20] prophet Amen in the name of William
[29:22] brandom and he took him and he displayed
[29:24] what Redemption had purchased back amen
[29:26] there was a man now by the direction of
[29:28] God could speak and when he speak it had
[29:31] creative power it would create squirrels
[29:33] into existence he said from
[29:35] nothing not a reforming or REM a
[29:38] materialization from nothing amen this
[29:41] is creative power that God
[29:44] had it was now back in the hands of man
[29:47] and under the direction of God he could
[29:50] also speak to Nature we talked about
[29:52] this at the storm in Colorado when he
[29:54] could speak to the storm to go away and
[29:56] the sun to come out and and all of these
[29:58] things begin to happen amen he's showing
[30:01] that that Redemption has brought man
[30:03] back the title deed is back amen the
[30:05] title deed did not need to go back to
[30:07] God God was holding it he was the
[30:09] originator of it he's the one who
[30:11] created it to give to man it belonged to
[30:13] man he wanted man to have it so man lost
[30:15] it so God came down as a man so he could
[30:18] take it back for
[30:19] man because God wanted this title deed
[30:22] to be Gods upon the Earth he wanted it
[30:24] in the hands of man who were his
[30:26] children so he came as a man to purchase
[30:28] it back that's why he was the last Adam
[30:30] to redeem all that Adam
[30:32] lost but it's been in obscurity and he's
[30:35] been doing a Redemption work but now in
[30:37] the end time he brings us back to the
[30:39] fullness of redemption and this fullness
[30:41] of redemption will bring us right into
[30:43] the Eden condition once again amen and
[30:45] we're right here at the cusp of it and
[30:47] at the cusp God shows amen this
[30:50] Redemption title deed book is back
[30:52] there's a man on Earth that can direct
[30:54] nature that can speak things into
[30:56] existence amen that that listen I I I'm
[30:59] telling you this is a hard statement but
[31:01] I don't know how else to say it but by
[31:03] the authority that God put in that man
[31:05] that man could give a widow whatever she
[31:08] desired and she desired salvation for
[31:10] who do children he said I give them to
[31:12] you in the name of Jesus
[31:14] [Music]
[31:16] Christ I I don't don't ask me to
[31:19] understand that I don't understand it
[31:20] but I believe it with all of my heart
[31:22] that he he was given Authority amen
[31:25] under the hand of God and he says I give
[31:28] them to you in the name of Jesus Christ
[31:30] cuz God told him you give her whatever
[31:31] she asked for and when she asked for he
[31:34] gave it to her so she got the salvation
[31:36] of her two sons why because God had
[31:39] restored he was restoring a title deed
[31:41] book he was bringing man back into
[31:46] position amen and and you know I don't
[31:48] want to take those things lightly or
[31:50] trivially like I don't want to take that
[31:52] as all of a sudden you know well that's
[31:54] restored back I'm going to do this I'm
[31:56] you're not going to do anything right
[31:58] in yourself brother B didn't do anything
[32:01] in himself it was God who had a man
[32:04] under control he had a prisoner in his
[32:06] hand somebody that he could entrust to
[32:08] speak knowing that he would speak the
[32:10] right thing and in fact it wasn't just
[32:12] brother benamy could trust he had a
[32:13] little widow woman on the earth at the
[32:15] same time that he could
[32:18] trust because she could ask for anything
[32:20] she
[32:21] wanted but God entrusted the power to
[32:25] ask for anything into somebody who he
[32:28] knew had a right heart would ask for the
[32:30] most important thing which is salvation
[32:31] for her two
[32:33] boys so this isn't something we just
[32:36] chance at and try at and stab
[32:39] at it's not that it's not that kind of a
[32:42] thing friends this is sure and absolute
[32:46] and powerful and and it's the plan of
[32:48] God of redemption and it's God's desire
[32:50] to bring back his children so he was
[32:53] demonstrating these things to us he gave
[32:56] him the author authority to to to stand
[32:59] he T him to stand on his feet he gave
[33:01] him the authority Amen to speak uh
[33:04] healing to his
[33:06] wife and the tumor that she had he spoke
[33:09] to it he spoke about it and it happened
[33:12] exactly the way he
[33:14] said why God had a
[33:17] prisoner God had a redeemed Son of God
[33:21] one that had come to a place in maturity
[33:24] and growth through the hard knocks of
[33:26] life and the trials and and all of these
[33:28] things he had come to a place where God
[33:30] could entrust the power of the spoken
[33:32] word into his
[33:34] hands and I thank God for that
[33:36] demonstration because if God can do it
[33:39] there he can do it
[33:41] here if he can get a man in the same
[33:43] condition amen and if he's got a purpose
[33:46] to accomplish God can accomplish that in
[33:48] you and
[33:49] I but but with all of that I I want to
[33:53] just take some time and look at the fact
[33:57] that
[33:58] God has never stripped from us the power
[34:02] to be little
[34:04] creators you thinking mankind look he's
[34:06] a little Creator and we know he's not
[34:08] creating something out of nothing what
[34:09] he's doing is taking what God created
[34:11] and he's refashioning and remolding it
[34:12] according to his own desire and his own
[34:14] Vision but but man is a little Creator
[34:17] but God has called us as Sons and
[34:18] Daughters of God to be little creators
[34:20] as
[34:21] well and that's what I want to look at
[34:23] in creating an
[34:25] atmosphere he says and the message here
[34:28] he says did you ever see people who you
[34:31] love to be around just love to be around
[34:34] them because they create an atmosphere a
[34:36] Heavenly and you like to be around them
[34:39] others seem to be good people but you
[34:42] just I have to get away once in a while
[34:44] you know what I mean and yet they seem
[34:46] to be good people it's not
[34:49] creative this is interesting what he's
[34:52] saying a man was made to be a God you
[34:56] know that Genesis 26 and he had dominion
[34:58] over the whole earth and he was made to
[35:00] be an amateur God and now when he
[35:02] receives God he becomes a Son of God he
[35:04] was made in the image of God God had H
[35:07] hands God had feet and so therefore a
[35:09] man was made like him so he is an
[35:12] amateur God now brother Bram ties this
[35:14] together with a man creating an
[35:16] atmosphere around him and some have a
[35:17] certain atmosphere and some have another
[35:19] atmosphere he said one's creative
[35:21] created the right kind of atmosphere but
[35:23] there was another type of person that he
[35:25] just had to get away from couldn't be
[35:26] around he said you know what I mean it's
[35:28] not creative it's not it's not I don't
[35:30] want to correct the prophet but it's not
[35:31] saying it's not creative but it's not
[35:33] creating the right atmosphere it is
[35:35] creative but it's creating the wrong
[35:37] kind of
[35:39] creation
[35:40] amen and so he says in the message hear
[35:44] ye him and it's come down home to the
[35:47] Pentecostals acting and dressing
[35:49] fashioning looking talking blaspheming
[35:52] making fun indifferent that's rough but
[35:55] it's good for you it's the truth but
[35:57] that's the the reason the world can't
[35:58] see nothing genuine when people come to
[36:01] a place that they'll forget all their
[36:03] little differences and the love of God
[36:05] will shed abroad in their hearts by the
[36:07] real teacher the Holy Ghost you'll
[36:08] become salty and the world will want to
[36:10] be like you you create a creation around
[36:14] you you've seen people you couldn't
[36:16] stand to be around yet they were nice
[36:18] people they created that within
[36:21] themselves so this is what I was
[36:22] referring to brother B said there's
[36:24] people nice people
[36:27] you couldn't stand to be around yet they
[36:29] were nice people amen they create that
[36:33] within
[36:34] themselves so that means man is still a
[36:37] little
[36:38] Creator right and we're creating the
[36:41] atmosphere that's around
[36:43] us and and you've SE uh he goes on he
[36:47] says you've seen people you love to be
[36:49] with because they create that atmosphere
[36:51] around them your spirit your soul you
[36:54] can't hide it you can't make believe
[36:57] so brother say they're seemingly nice
[36:59] and maybe the talk is right maybe they
[37:02] the all the religious rhetoric is right
[37:04] maybe the speech is correct and and all
[37:06] of that looks right but there's
[37:08] something that that you just can't
[37:10] connect with there's another atmosphere
[37:12] there amen and who created that
[37:17] atmosphere we're creators
[37:19] ourselves we create an atmosphere around
[37:22] us I think this is really important uh
[37:25] uh as we move forward we're you know
[37:29] we're coming to the place of adoption
[37:31] this is the adoption age and adoption is
[37:34] completion Enoch we preached about on
[37:36] Wednesday he came to adoption he was the
[37:38] seventh from Adam seventh means
[37:40] completion so he had come to a place of
[37:42] adoption with a revelation of the word
[37:45] of God and a relationship with God that
[37:47] was changing him and and and and and he
[37:50] became the reflection of the word for
[37:52] his day he was moving into red uh
[37:54] adoption to the fullness of adoption for
[37:56] that age he was the type the foreshadow
[37:59] of what we're doing in our day and as we
[38:02] come into adoption we come into a place
[38:04] where where we begin to be like our
[38:07] father that's what adoption is we we've
[38:10] talked about it many times but when
[38:11] brother bam talks about adoption Through
[38:13] the Bible the way he he explains and
[38:15] teaches it to us he said a son is a son
[38:17] he's born a son he's born of his father
[38:19] he's a son right then but God is going
[38:22] to bring him into adoption where he can
[38:23] bring him to a place where he has power
[38:25] and authority and he's just almost equal
[38:27] to his father this is the way brother
[38:30] bam teaches us and he says now uh uh he
[38:33] puts him under good tutors and then a
[38:35] Christian gets under the tutor of the
[38:36] Holy Ghost but a man will greet good
[38:38] tutors and that that tutor will bring
[38:40] lessons and instruction and teaching and
[38:43] all kinds of things uh to this young boy
[38:46] as he's coming up to adoption so that
[38:48] the father can give the inheritance over
[38:50] to his hand so he can entrust him amen
[38:53] and so as he's building up there's all
[38:55] kinds of test and brother bam starts to
[38:57] he he speaks about this so many places
[38:59] and so many different ways but he he
[39:02] says the uh uh he says can you imagine
[39:04] the tutor coming to the father and
[39:06] saying your son won't listen to anything
[39:09] I tell him he won't heed your words and
[39:11] and he's not diligent in this and he
[39:13] won't do this and he won't do that and
[39:15] and he has to bring an evil report amen
[39:17] but how good it is to hear when the
[39:19] father can hear the report from the
[39:21] tutor he says oh he's just like you you
[39:23] should have seen the other day the way
[39:25] he handled the Sheep he did it just the
[39:27] way you would do it amen that's what
[39:29] adoption is bringing us into to where we
[39:32] have this this growth this maturity and
[39:35] then we begin to reflect the Father the
[39:38] father is now reflected in the son and
[39:40] coming to a place where the father can
[39:42] trust the
[39:44] son now we've seen this Amen in the
[39:47] prophet of God in this day we've seen
[39:49] God do this and listen I I I want to
[39:51] also uh uh if I could share my heart
[39:54] this way we've seen this on display
[39:56] we've absolutely seen God take a human
[39:59] being and give him the authority and
[40:01] power to speak what he would say and
[40:04] what he would say would absolutely come
[40:05] to pass and materialize amen this is
[40:08] this is absolutely fantastic power it's
[40:11] unbelievable when you really think about
[40:13] it amen and God had had if you look at
[40:16] brother brenham's life and the
[40:18] difficulties and the struggles and the
[40:19] rejection and the growth and and God was
[40:22] growing him and training him through all
[40:23] of that to get a place where he had a
[40:25] son that he could UST
[40:30] but even after God could trust him with
[40:34] these things it didn't mean brother
[40:36] renam was no longer a human being and
[40:38] didn't make
[40:39] mistakes he would even come and confess
[40:42] it he would be corrected in the pull Pit
[40:44] by God he would go to say something and
[40:47] he and he and he said something too
[40:48] sharp about an individual oh how I'd
[40:50] like to take the word and just tie this
[40:52] brother and NS and immediately the Holy
[40:54] Ghost checked him and said I shouldn't
[40:56] have said it that way that wasn't right
[40:57] I should have phrased it this other way
[40:59] amen so here you have a son that's under
[41:02] control he's still in a sticky culber
[41:04] nature he still I mean he still has his
[41:07] own ways about him he can still make a
[41:09] misstep amen but he's under the control
[41:11] of the Holy Ghost where the Holy Ghost
[41:12] can bring him to correction and he can
[41:14] come back and be corrected and yield and
[41:16] surrender and
[41:18] submit so I don't want us to look at
[41:21] this and say uh uh you know well I still
[41:24] make mistakes brother bam still made
[41:26] mistakes that's
[41:28] right I don't want to come to this place
[41:31] where we kick everything way down the
[41:32] road and say well no today is the
[41:36] day today is the
[41:39] day and
[41:41] as we come through
[41:44] adoption there's a there's an adoption
[41:46] age we're in adoption age where the
[41:48] church comes into an
[41:50] adoption but we are individuals going
[41:53] through the same process
[41:55] individually just because the whole
[41:57] Church agees moved into adoption doesn't
[41:58] mean you automatically get there you got
[42:01] to go through your own process of birth
[42:03] and growth and positional placing and
[42:06] ups and downs and lessons and teachings
[42:09] and chastisements and praise you got to
[42:12] go through all of
[42:13] that so we we're all still in that
[42:16] Journey but as we go we if we move in if
[42:20] I could if we move into this as we move
[42:23] into this place we should be growing in
[42:25] his likeness day by day more and more
[42:27] moving higher and higher that's the
[42:29] whole point of the process that's right
[42:32] and and we talk about creative
[42:35] power uh we talk about the power of the
[42:39] spoken word and the manifestation of the
[42:41] spoken word the manifestation of the
[42:43] third pool as brother B spoke to
[42:44] squirrel spoke to storm spoke to uh uh
[42:48] uh the uh his wife's tumor these things
[42:51] the power of the spoken word and we look
[42:53] at that as creative power and it was
[42:55] creative power
[42:57] but don't wait to get there to exercise
[43:01] creative power because God has already
[43:04] placed in our hands creative
[43:06] power we have the power to create an
[43:09] atmosphere around
[43:10] us and if we're not taking the proper
[43:13] dominion and control of this creative
[43:16] power why would he put in our hands
[43:18] other creative
[43:20] power amen you know I I I'm going to
[43:25] make a statement because I believe
[43:28] it I'm thankful God has not placed in my
[43:31] hands the power of the spoken word and
[43:34] creative power CU I don't know that I
[43:36] had the character to handle it I'm glad
[43:39] he hasn't done it till now and I don't
[43:41] even know that I have it now you realize
[43:44] it's so
[43:46] dangerous that power is so
[43:51] dangerous that it takes
[43:54] character remember power without
[43:56] character is
[43:57] satanic but Power with characters fit to
[44:00] rule so God is working on our character
[44:02] but he's given to us Dominion he's given
[44:06] to us certain Authority certain Dominion
[44:08] he's given to us the power of free
[44:11] choice he's given to us in some ways
[44:13] listen we we man is like God upon the
[44:16] Earth because he has the power of choice
[44:18] man can choose animal acts by Instinct
[44:21] you think animal has choice but he's
[44:22] moving by Instinct man can reason man
[44:25] can man can can sit back back and
[44:27] reflect and look at things and he can
[44:29] make a choice and those choices have
[44:31] consequences and God allows that whole
[44:33] cause and effect to work out for our
[44:35] education but the the point of the
[44:37] matter is that God has placed in our
[44:39] hands free choice we don't just act by
[44:41] Instinct because if we just acted by
[44:43] Instinct none of us would follow the
[44:44] word of God cuz we were born with the
[44:46] wrong
[44:48] Instinct but he gives us the Power of
[44:50] Choice to override the natural lustful
[44:53] fleshly Instinct and choose the word of
[44:55] God Amen that that is power that has
[44:58] been placed in your and our hands anden
[45:00] we need to exercise that power
[45:02] Faithfully if we want to come to another
[45:06] Power then we have the the the power to
[45:10] create an
[45:12] atmosphere and and let's exercise that
[45:15] power and create that atmosphere around
[45:17] us we also have the power over our
[45:20] tongues over what comes out of our mouth
[45:22] and we know that that's a a huge power
[45:24] and I think we underestimate the power
[45:26] that we have to speak amen and that
[45:29] should shouldn't be taken lightly and
[45:31] we're going to talk about that here in a
[45:32] little while but but let we've been
[45:35] given a dominion and and your Dominion
[45:38] we all have dominion we all have
[45:39] different positions and different
[45:40] authorities but when it all comes down
[45:42] to it to the basic fundamental basis
[45:45] principle you all have dominion over the
[45:47] flesh you dwell in you have the dominion
[45:50] over the thoughts you allow to entertain
[45:52] in your mind and brother M said you
[45:54] can't stop the thoughts from coming but
[45:55] don't let them build a don't let them
[45:57] Roost don't let them build a nest you
[45:58] take every thought captive to The
[46:00] Obedience of Christ so you have you have
[46:03] control over your mind you have control
[46:05] over your actions you have control over
[46:08] what you look at you have control over
[46:09] the atmosphere you create you have
[46:11] control over what you speak and God has
[46:13] given us a dominion and as as amateur
[46:16] Gods we need to take control over this
[46:18] and create the right atmosphere amen and
[46:20] that atmosphere will continue to grow
[46:22] those responsibilities will continue to
[46:24] move amen but we got to realize I I am
[46:27] in an adoption cycle that I'm being
[46:29] tested I'm being trained by the tutor
[46:32] I've been given more and more
[46:33] responsibility to come to a higher and a
[46:35] higher level because what does God want
[46:37] God wants an earth inhabited with sons
[46:39] and daughters of God he wants a
[46:40] millennial Reign where his son and his
[46:42] son's bride are giving back Dominion as
[46:45] Gods upon the Earth
[46:47] again and that's what he's growing me
[46:50] to that's what my everyday life is about
[46:54] that's right that's what my going to
[46:56] work is about that's what my getting
[46:57] sick is about that's what my little
[46:59] offenses are about that's what the rubs
[47:02] with my brothers and sisters are about
[47:04] that's what that's what my coworker deal
[47:06] is all about that's what that's what all
[47:08] of this is all about is teaching us to
[47:11] be
[47:12] Gods to be gods and take Dominion by the
[47:16] word amen to be gods and act out and
[47:18] flesh out the very nature of Our Father
[47:21] God to be amateur Gods right now amen
[47:24] not saying I'll be an amateur God when I
[47:27] want to be like God right now in this
[47:30] little Tabernacle God please help me to
[47:32] come into your image and display your
[47:34] attributes amen and follow your
[47:39] leading
[47:42] amen I think sometimes we try to
[47:47] overreach try to reach for because we
[47:51] know this is the age we know this is the
[47:53] time we know he once manifested sons of
[47:55] God but I wonder if we're not trampling
[47:58] over the very things that bring us into
[48:01] that position trying to get to
[48:04] something
[48:06] amen and leaving all the other things
[48:11] undone
[48:13] Amen in the message Awakening Jesus he
[48:17] says
[48:18] now in Jesus was God God was in Christ
[48:21] reconciling the world to himself and
[48:23] these people believe his testimony and
[48:25] them that did truly believe it could
[48:27] draw God's blessing from him and when
[48:30] they did so he said virtue went out from
[48:32] him virtue is strength in other words if
[48:35] we'd say it today he got weak when the
[48:37] people draw it off of him well if it
[48:39] worked that way in that human body it'll
[48:42] work in another human body
[48:45] sir yeah we saw that with brother Bon he
[48:48] would stand in the pulpit and they would
[48:49] draw virtue and the Visions would make
[48:51] him weak and I don't think he's talking
[48:53] only about his body either I think it
[48:55] can happen in your body amen amen I
[48:58] think it as Sons and Daughters of God
[49:00] that we've been restored by the baptism
[49:02] of the Holy Ghost the New Birth has
[49:03] brought us back into our birth as Sons
[49:06] and Daughters we're growing into his
[49:07] likeness there's virtue inside of us and
[49:10] that virtue can go out to others that's
[49:12] what creating the atmosphere is where
[49:14] people can come and draw virtue and
[49:16] Jesus had virtue in him that woman could
[49:19] draw from the prophet of God had virtue
[49:21] in him somebody could draw from and I
[49:23] want to have virtue inside of me that
[49:25] can affect somebody else's life that
[49:27] they can draw from what an amateur God
[49:29] being in their presence a representation
[49:31] of Jesus Christ on the earth God's bride
[49:34] and me standing here should have
[49:35] something for somebody
[49:38] else we should have something there
[49:41] should be a virtuous strength amen I I I
[49:44] don't believe God's called us Amen to
[49:46] barely be a Christian and to barely make
[49:48] it and to barely have a act together and
[49:50] barely I believe God's put inside he's
[49:53] restored the word to us he's brought us
[49:54] back to a true identification of who we
[49:56] are he has taught us he's instructed us
[49:59] he's displayed it through example so
[50:01] that we can come back to a place where
[50:03] we can be Sons and Daughters of God upon
[50:05] this Earth creating an atmosphere of
[50:07] Faith and Healing and love where there's
[50:09] virtue to be drawn from others that are
[50:11] around
[50:15] us and and brother says and we create
[50:18] our atmosphere around us each one of
[50:21] us listen it's not just sons of God
[50:25] remember the person that want to get
[50:27] away from they created an atmosphere
[50:30] themselves so man has a an ability to
[50:33] create create this atmosphere but as
[50:35] Sons and Daughters of God we are
[50:37] supercharged by the spirit of God and
[50:39] been restored by the word of God we've
[50:41] got something to line too we've got
[50:43] something to empower amen our desire
[50:46] because we know what pleases him we know
[50:47] what he wants and he's got his spirit of
[50:49] God is here to back up his word and
[50:51] bring it to pass in our
[50:53] lives now it's not our human effort
[50:56] anymore now it's a a yielding to him and
[50:58] him coming in and empowering us there
[51:00] should be virtue in
[51:03] US amen and we create around our at uh
[51:09] our atmosphere around us each one of us
[51:11] you've been with people that were nice
[51:12] people but you just couldn't hardly be
[51:14] around them then you've been with other
[51:16] people that you just love to be around
[51:18] them you create that
[51:21] atmosphere and oh wouldn't you love to
[51:23] have been around Jesus just a little
[51:33] wonderful see what the atmosphere he
[51:35] created would have been I imagine it was
[51:38] just one great big bundle of love and
[51:41] respect and godly
[51:44] fear you
[51:46] know Jesus was accused of a lot of
[51:49] things of being beb and and having a
[51:52] devil and the but these were religious
[51:54] leaders who hated him for the truth that
[51:56] he
[51:58] spoke but Jesus had a good atmosphere
[52:01] around
[52:02] him a good atmosphere so much so that
[52:06] the mothers wanted to bring their little
[52:08] children to Jesus and the it in no way
[52:12] in the scripture do we get the idea that
[52:14] these children were afraid of
[52:16] Jesus that they were recoiling when they
[52:19] come into His presence that that that he
[52:21] says he took them up in his arms amen
[52:25] and he blessed them the whole imagery we
[52:27] have is an atmosphere that these
[52:30] children are comfortable in the the the
[52:33] picture that's portrayed remember the
[52:35] Bible condenses his truth it doesn't go
[52:36] and explain everything but the the fact
[52:38] that mothers wanted to bring their
[52:40] children uh to him to be blessed amen
[52:43] and and the disciples you know they had
[52:44] their own high fluting ideas and they
[52:46] were missing the whole point and they
[52:47] were trying to to to hold them back but
[52:49] he says they suffer the little children
[52:51] to come unto me for such is the Kingdom
[52:53] of Heaven and the mothers brought them
[52:55] and he took them in their arms and he
[52:57] blessed them amen and it and it shows me
[52:59] that there was a good atmosphere around
[53:01] Jesus that even the little children were
[53:03] comfortable coming to him and climbing
[53:04] up in his arms and being held by the
[53:06] Lord Jesus and being blessed and the
[53:07] mothers wanted their children in this
[53:12] atmosphere see
[53:17] Jesus sometimes I don't know how to say
[53:19] things good but I'll just say the way
[53:21] it's coming to me Jesus was not a
[53:22] religious nut
[53:26] am who was so spiritual nobody liked to
[53:28] be around
[53:30] him you see what I'm saying that wasn't
[53:33] the atmosphere around
[53:36] Jesus that wasn't the atmosphere around
[53:39] brother
[53:41] brandham the unbelievers like to be
[53:44] around brother
[53:45] Brandon he had a hunting buddy who was
[53:47] Snake Eyes the cruelest hearted man he
[53:49] had ever
[53:51] known I
[53:52] mean
[53:55] listen I
[53:57] I don't want a hunting buddy who Snake
[53:58] Eyes is the cruelest man I've ever been
[54:00] but brother brandham had a hunting buddy
[54:03] and that buddy Amen lik to be around
[54:06] brother brandham and brother Bram said
[54:07] he was the crul cruel cruel heartest man
[54:10] I ever know but he was a good
[54:12] Hunter I mean at least he had something
[54:14] nice to say about
[54:16] him the the people in the neighborhood
[54:19] the little children the neighbors they
[54:22] like to be around brother
[54:24] brandham I love I so thankful God sent
[54:27] an
[54:28] example is my is as religious as we've
[54:31] ever tried to be and super spiritual
[54:33] none of us can hold a candle to the life
[54:36] of that prophet in his
[54:38] spirituality and the supernatural in his
[54:40] life none of
[54:43] us the most spiritual of us all are a
[54:46] fraction of what God had done in that
[54:47] man but in that man he was common he had
[54:50] an atmosphere around him it was good it
[54:52] was pleasant he could be friendly
[54:54] friends could talk to him he could have
[54:56] conversations I mean he he had people
[54:59] who would come to him for prayer who
[55:01] never believed that he was a prophet or
[55:03] believ the message that he preached
[55:05] anyways and who would never come to the
[55:07] message but they would come to him for
[55:08] pray because they had confidence in him
[55:09] because they knew the atmosphere around
[55:11] him was
[55:14] right see if if we if we in our
[55:18] religious Zeal and our super
[55:19] spirituality create a negative
[55:22] atmosphere around us that pushed people
[55:24] away where people don't want to be near
[55:26] us and people don't want to be our
[55:27] friend and and no coworker at work wants
[55:29] to talk to us and and nobody will sit
[55:31] with us at lunch because all they get is
[55:34] condemnation and criticism and the Bible
[55:37] and and scriptures lacing them slicing
[55:39] them the bits and pieces and leaving
[55:41] them brother BR wasn't like
[55:44] that when he talked to somebody he would
[55:46] drop a little seed and if it went
[55:48] nowhere he didn't push
[55:50] it and he wouldn't run away and never
[55:52] talk to them and say they had their
[55:53] chance I'll never talk to them again
[55:57] he wasn't a religious nut although he
[56:00] was accused of all kinds of things along
[56:02] those lines just like Jesus was but the
[56:04] little children weren't afraid of
[56:05] brother
[56:09] Brandon you see what I'm saying I I hope
[56:11] this is coming
[56:13] across there should be sons of God upon
[56:15] the
[56:16] Earth not weirdos and zealous nuts that
[56:19] people don't want to get
[56:22] around that's not what the children of
[56:24] God should be
[56:26] and you realize if you take a stand for
[56:28] the word there's going to be people who
[56:29] hate you and people who don't want to be
[56:30] around you but that's for religious
[56:33] regions that's for there's there's evil
[56:35] spirits and religious spirits and
[56:36] they'll hate you and they won't like you
[56:37] and they won't want to be around you you
[56:39] can't do a blessed thing about that
[56:41] because that's that spirit in them
[56:42] hating the spirit that's in you but
[56:45] that's somebody giving over to a
[56:46] religious spirit amen and we're giving
[56:48] over to the Holy Spirit those two will
[56:50] never merge together amen but there's
[56:53] people caught in the
[56:54] crossfire amen
[57:00] there should be virtue in
[57:01] us we should create an atmosphere there
[57:04] should be a created atmosphere whatever
[57:06] was in Jesus should be in US amen we're
[57:08] not in full measure you know we don't
[57:10] believe that but in a portion and I
[57:12] believe if I had a portion of what was
[57:14] in Christ that would be a good portion
[57:16] amen a little drop would be great amen I
[57:18] would take it and love it and relish it
[57:20] I want to reflect amen what's been
[57:22] reflected to us in this day I want to
[57:24] reflect back amen and and so I I wanted
[57:27] to create around me an atmosphere like
[57:29] brother Benham said there must have been
[57:31] a wonderful atmosphere around Jesus he
[57:33] says I imagine it was one great big
[57:35] bundle of love and respect and godly
[57:41] fear amen it's amazing Jesus never
[57:46] railed against the
[57:50] Romans he never entered into Political
[57:52] rhetoric and he never was hateful and he
[57:55] but he said some really hard
[57:58] things he told a group of people one day
[58:01] that they're of their father the
[58:03] devil so I I I'm I when I talk about
[58:07] this atmosphere I'm not talking about an
[58:09] atmosphere that's a pushover and will
[58:10] never stand for truth and never will
[58:11] speak what's right brother brandham
[58:13] wasn't that way either he would preach
[58:15] some hard things he would preach against
[58:17] the Pentecostal women who were moving
[58:19] away from Holiness and morality and
[58:21] allowing cutting hair and wearing these
[58:23] clothes and and letting fashion slip and
[58:25] and he would say it he would say say it
[58:26] hard and he would say it straight but at
[58:27] the end he says now you know I didn't
[58:29] mean that in any way he says that's
[58:31] because I love you that I said that and
[58:33] if I didn't say it I wouldn't love
[58:37] you and somehow when you hear him say it
[58:40] you believe
[58:41] him you believe him because there's an
[58:45] atmosphere there's a life behind it so
[58:48] Jesus said although it was one great big
[58:50] bundle of love and respects and godly
[58:52] fear amen it wasn't like he was so so
[58:56] nice he couldn't be
[58:58] honest or he was so nice that he could
[59:00] no longer be a Son of God upon the
[59:02] Earth it's not about being nice it's
[59:05] about having the right
[59:06] atmosphere it's about creating a Godly
[59:09] atmosphere and and Jesus
[59:12] could I mean he could beat the money
[59:14] changers out of the
[59:16] temple I don't know what that atmosphere
[59:18] felt
[59:20] like I I don't know but do you realize
[59:24] what I'm saying there's things that you
[59:26] can't control there's things that you
[59:28] have to say there's stands that you have
[59:29] to take and there's people who won't
[59:31] like the atmosphere around you not
[59:33] because you have a bad atmosphere
[59:35] because it's contrary to the atmosphere
[59:37] they live
[59:38] in but what we don't want to do is
[59:41] create the wrong Atmosphere by our own
[59:46] creation we want to stay with the word
[59:48] and the nature of the word till it
[59:50] creates the right kind of atmosphere
[59:52] around
[59:53] us amen our neighbor neighbors should
[59:56] like
[59:59] us I believe you should be one of the
[1:00:02] favorite Neighbors on your
[1:00:05] block I mean not just because you don't
[1:00:07] play loud music and you don't have
[1:00:09] parties but that that that
[1:00:13] too I believe that our co-workers should
[1:00:15] want to be around us extended family
[1:00:18] members should like talking to
[1:00:20] us and and remember my disclaimer
[1:00:23] there's always those that will never
[1:00:25] like you no matter what you try to do
[1:00:27] they can't because of a religious
[1:00:29] spirit that's not what I that's the
[1:00:32] outlier you can't do anything about
[1:00:35] that but in
[1:00:37] general if people like to be around
[1:00:40] brother brandham if people like to be
[1:00:41] around
[1:00:43] Jesus they should like to be around
[1:00:47] us brother mam says in the invisible
[1:00:50] Union you're standing completely you
[1:00:53] never sin at the first place God don't
[1:00:55] even know it's in the sea of
[1:00:56] forgetfulness you never did it you were
[1:00:59] accused of it by the accuser but really
[1:01:01] from the beginning you were
[1:01:02] predestinated to be a son or daughter of
[1:01:03] God you're standing there washed and
[1:01:05] your old book of divorcement is put away
[1:01:07] and it's dead absolutely out of
[1:01:09] existence even in the mind of God may
[1:01:12] this understanding gives us freedom to
[1:01:14] become what we were always meant to be
[1:01:15] it takes the condemnation throws it away
[1:01:18] positionally places us and now we can
[1:01:19] move forward in the position God's put
[1:01:21] us in he said you're The Virtuous bride
[1:01:24] of Christ washed in the blood of Christ
[1:01:27] precious virtuous sinless Son of God
[1:01:29] standing with a pure unadulterated bride
[1:01:31] word that he Washed by the Water of his
[1:01:33] own blood that became flesh and
[1:01:35] manifested that he might take you which
[1:01:38] were predestinated in the bosom of the
[1:01:39] father before the beginning the same as
[1:01:42] he was he was that great attribute of
[1:01:45] God Called
[1:01:47] Love what is Jesus that great attribute
[1:01:50] of God Called Love what should is
[1:01:52] redeemed Blood Washed restored virtuous
[1:01:55] bride be she should be just like him for
[1:01:57] she came out of him and she's here
[1:01:59] reflecting his life he's supposed to be
[1:02:01] here at the end time in Bride form in
[1:02:03] the formation of his bride so that great
[1:02:05] big attribute called love should be in
[1:02:07] Bride
[1:02:08] form
[1:02:11] amen he says in the spoken words
[1:02:13] Original Seed and a real seed of God is
[1:02:15] an absorbent for the spirit all
[1:02:18] denominationalism is took out all
[1:02:20] unbelief is out and when the Holy Spirit
[1:02:22] comes into that germ of life that's
[1:02:23] laying there it produces another seed
[1:02:26] just exactly another Son of God is born
[1:02:29] amen another amateur God Son of God so
[1:02:32] the seed of God laying in there's an
[1:02:34] absorbent to the spirit when the spirit
[1:02:35] comes in it's born again it produces
[1:02:37] what another seed another son another
[1:02:39] amateur God and as we absorb that Spirit
[1:02:42] it should bring life to the word that
[1:02:44] we're feeding on and it should bring
[1:02:46] that it should bring virtue and strength
[1:02:48] and love and respects and all the things
[1:02:51] that were in Christ should start to flow
[1:02:52] out of
[1:02:54] us amen
[1:02:57] God help us let's turn to First John
[1:03:00] together now I've got several scriptures
[1:03:03] I want to turn to so keep your Bibles
[1:03:04] handy or your notebooks you just jot
[1:03:06] them down if you don't have time to turn
[1:03:10] but I want to read through quite a few
[1:03:14] here 1 John 4 verse
[1:03:22] 7 beloved let us love one another for
[1:03:25] love is of God and everyone that loveth
[1:03:27] is born of God and knoweth God he that
[1:03:30] loveth not knoweth not God for God is
[1:03:32] love in this was manifested the love of
[1:03:35] God toward us because that God sent his
[1:03:37] only begotten son into the world that we
[1:03:39] might live through him here in his love
[1:03:42] not that we love God but that he loved
[1:03:44] us and sent his son to be the
[1:03:46] propitiation for our sins beloved if God
[1:03:49] so loved us we ought also to love one
[1:03:52] another no man has seen God at any time
[1:03:56] if we love one another God dwelleth in
[1:03:58] us and his love is perfected in
[1:04:02] us God is love let's go to verse
[1:04:06] 16 and we have known and believed the
[1:04:09] love that God hath to us God is love and
[1:04:12] he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God
[1:04:14] and God in him amen that's not hate
[1:04:18] that's not that's not con condemnation
[1:04:21] that's not contention that's not Strife
[1:04:24] that's love amen now Love sometimes says
[1:04:28] hard
[1:04:29] things sometimes love says straight
[1:04:31] things sometimes God says love is
[1:04:34] corrective but it's not critical it's
[1:04:36] not full of strife it's not
[1:04:39] malicious has no
[1:04:41] bitterness mixed in with
[1:04:44] it it's love let's go to verse
[1:04:51] 19 says we love him because he first
[1:04:54] loved us
[1:04:56] if a man say I love God and hateth his
[1:04:58] brother he is a liar for he he that
[1:05:01] loveth not his brother whom he hath seen
[1:05:03] how can he love God whom he ha not seen
[1:05:06] and this commandment have we from him
[1:05:08] that he who loveth God love his brother
[1:05:11] also so you should see there should be
[1:05:13] an atmosphere of Love Around The
[1:05:15] Believers love for one another but in
[1:05:18] general an atmosphere of love and we
[1:05:20] love him because he first loved us amen
[1:05:22] so that means that means when God loved
[1:05:26] he loved first before it was
[1:05:28] reciprocated is that right well what
[1:05:31] should amateur Gods be
[1:05:34] like what should am if we're to reflect
[1:05:37] if we're minor Gods if we're lesser Gods
[1:05:39] if we're amateur Gods trying to reflect
[1:05:41] the very nature of our father he loved
[1:05:43] us first and he gave himself for us amen
[1:05:46] before we ask for forgiveness before we
[1:05:48] apologize before we said we I love you
[1:05:51] he demonstrated his love by a
[1:05:53] sacrificing of himself for us amen is
[1:05:55] there is is there any capacity in us to
[1:05:58] love
[1:05:59] first to love those around us amen not
[1:06:02] in a reciprocating way but re just to
[1:06:05] love
[1:06:06] first that's what God did and besides
[1:06:09] that he he loved the whole world God so
[1:06:11] loved the whole world that He Sent His
[1:06:13] only begotten
[1:06:15] son amen love should emanate from the
[1:06:18] amateur Gods it's my opinion but I
[1:06:22] believe the word matches it love should
[1:06:25] emate from the amateur
[1:06:28] Gods when you know when we first start
[1:06:30] talking about the unveiling of the
[1:06:32] amateur Gods we start showing how uh
[1:06:34] faith in the word in your day begins to
[1:06:35] peel back and unveil who the amateur
[1:06:37] gods are that's the way it's always been
[1:06:39] and the ability to hear from God and
[1:06:40] walk with God but but when you begin to
[1:06:42] peel back and unveil the amateur Gods it
[1:06:44] should be an unveiling of the attributes
[1:06:47] of God that are in his
[1:06:50] people and mean we think of uh amateur
[1:06:53] gods and we we begin to think of the
[1:06:55] destination we begin to think of the
[1:06:57] goal and we begin to think of uh
[1:06:59] standing on the earth at some time and
[1:07:01] and and speaking to Nature to stop and
[1:07:03] and and to give rain to these crops and
[1:07:05] to withhold rain from this from this
[1:07:07] nation but but that's that's true that's
[1:07:10] what the the manifested son of Gods are
[1:07:12] going to sons of God are going to do
[1:07:14] amen but I don't believe that's the only
[1:07:16] thing they're going to do I believe
[1:07:17] manifested sons of God are going to be
[1:07:19] manifested sons of God and begin
[1:07:21] manifesting even now today manifest the
[1:07:25] the attributes of God the nature of God
[1:07:27] the character of God begin to create a
[1:07:30] character of godliness around us amen
[1:07:32] and and love all around
[1:07:36] us and the message why the prophet says
[1:07:39] if if we can't love one another how are
[1:07:41] we going to love God whom we haven't
[1:07:43] seen we must find the vein we've got to
[1:07:46] love one another though we different you
[1:07:48] got to love any you can't Bluff it you
[1:07:51] got to really do it you got to and
[1:07:54] that's the greatest power that that they
[1:07:56] found in healing is love when you have
[1:07:58] sympathy and love for the people trying
[1:08:00] to help them what brother B he had love
[1:08:03] and compassion for the people Jesus when
[1:08:05] he saw the multitudes fainting with
[1:08:07] Hunger he had compassion upon them amen
[1:08:10] that that that is something that's in
[1:08:12] the Son of God that is something that
[1:08:14] are in the sons of
[1:08:16] God Amen he says in this message Divine
[1:08:20] love now there's one there's only one
[1:08:22] thing the church has to do if you want
[1:08:24] somebody to come to Christ you be salty
[1:08:27] salty makes a thirst you be salty and
[1:08:29] the world will get thirsty that's right
[1:08:31] for in a man he is he is in one sense a
[1:08:35] miniature Creator if he's a child of God
[1:08:38] because the spirit of God is in him who
[1:08:40] controls him who operates him what's he
[1:08:43] talking about being a miniature Creator
[1:08:45] he's talking about being salty to the
[1:08:46] world being
[1:08:48] Christlike man creating the
[1:08:50] atmosphere and the message is is your
[1:08:52] life worthy of the Gospel he says and
[1:08:54] did you know you you you are a little
[1:08:57] Creator yourself you know that certainly
[1:09:00] you've seen people that you just love to
[1:09:01] be around you don't know why just that
[1:09:04] loving type of person have you seen that
[1:09:07] just a kind they're you like to be
[1:09:09] around them they create that Atmosphere
[1:09:10] by the life they live the way they talk
[1:09:13] their
[1:09:14] conversation I love
[1:09:16] this this is what I want to begin to
[1:09:18] speak on now is the power of the spoken
[1:09:23] word they create that Atmosphere by the
[1:09:25] life they live the way they talk their
[1:09:28] conversation then You' seen those that
[1:09:31] every time you shun them all the time
[1:09:33] they want to talk about something evil
[1:09:35] or talk about somebody say oh my there
[1:09:37] they come they're going to criticize
[1:09:39] somebody there he's in here now he's
[1:09:41] going to talk about this man all they're
[1:09:44] going to do is tell dirty jokes or
[1:09:46] something about a woman or something
[1:09:47] like that you just hate to get around
[1:09:49] them they create seemingly pretty nice
[1:09:51] people but they create that atmosphere
[1:09:55] and the things that you think on and the
[1:09:57] things that you do the actions the
[1:10:00] things you talk about creates an
[1:10:04] atmosphere I want the atmosphere of the
[1:10:06] word all around me so that means I need
[1:10:07] to think about the word I need to talk
[1:10:09] about the word I need to be in the realm
[1:10:11] and the atmosphere of the word that
[1:10:13] creates an atmosphere around
[1:10:15] me
[1:10:17] amen and brother B says in the most in
[1:10:19] the message token he's talking about the
[1:10:21] token now which is the baptism of the
[1:10:23] Holy Ghost and it's the life of God
[1:10:24] inside he says apply it and create that
[1:10:27] atmosphere around you and they'll just
[1:10:30] drop right into he's talking about the
[1:10:31] loved ones and the ones you desire to
[1:10:32] see save the ones that you're praying
[1:10:34] for they'll just drop right into it oh
[1:10:36] you are you if you got the token you
[1:10:39] create a spirit around you a power that
[1:10:42] when you walk people know that you're a
[1:10:44] Christian they love for you to say
[1:10:46] something to them they believe your word
[1:10:48] what you say they hold on to it see
[1:10:50] that's it man how many of you will have
[1:10:53] people at work that even sometimes will
[1:10:56] laugh at you a little bit because of the
[1:10:58] stand you take or even family members
[1:10:59] they'll they'll be a little bit critical
[1:11:01] of your Holiness or the the fact that
[1:11:03] you know you're too religious or
[1:11:05] whatever it is amen but when they hit a
[1:11:07] crisis where do they come when sickness
[1:11:10] strikes their family when something's
[1:11:12] going wrong the very person that they
[1:11:14] they made a little bit of fun of they
[1:11:15] want to get over close to and ask you
[1:11:16] some questions and they want to say well
[1:11:18] what do you think about what's going on
[1:11:20] and and this or that and and and they
[1:11:22] want you to pray for them they want you
[1:11:23] to talk to them because they know that
[1:11:25] something in you is real and in the time
[1:11:27] of Crisis they know where it's at
[1:11:29] because they felt it you created the
[1:11:31] atmosphere around you sometimes we don't
[1:11:33] even know the effect that we're having
[1:11:35] on people by creating that atmosphere
[1:11:37] but when the time of Christ is hits
[1:11:39] sometimes you see amen how did they know
[1:11:41] where to come when they were sick how
[1:11:43] did they know where to come when their
[1:11:44] marriage was falling apart or when they
[1:11:46] had a son or daughter that was getting
[1:11:47] caught up in worldly things and running
[1:11:49] astray how did they know where to come
[1:11:51] and why are they talking to me about
[1:11:53] their personal problems
[1:11:57] why am I the workplace
[1:11:59] counselor anybody ever felt that way
[1:12:03] it's the atmosphere that's in you it's
[1:12:05] it's God that's dwelling in you it's the
[1:12:07] atmosphere you create it's the word it's
[1:12:09] the love it's something that's reaching
[1:12:11] out there's virtue that they can draw
[1:12:13] from there's a well there that they can
[1:12:15] tap into and in the time of Crisis they
[1:12:17] begin to realize amen when everything's
[1:12:19] well and they don't want to change and
[1:12:20] they don't like the conflict of The lust
[1:12:22] spirit with the the the holiness mean
[1:12:24] they may say away they may make little
[1:12:26] comments not nasty not mean but just a
[1:12:28] little bit oh I know you wouldn't go for
[1:12:30] that or I know you wouldn't go there but
[1:12:32] the minute they have a need they come
[1:12:34] right up to you and say Hey listen I got
[1:12:36] this and my wife and my son and this and
[1:12:38] that and the other and you're standing
[1:12:39] here like why are you telling me all of
[1:12:42] this listen I'll tell you why they're
[1:12:44] telling you all of that they need the
[1:12:46] god that's inside of you they need an
[1:12:47] amateur God right then on the earth they
[1:12:50] need some place to draw virtue from
[1:12:52] somebody that can give them something
[1:12:54] more than rhetoric something more than
[1:12:55] talking points something with substance
[1:12:57] a real life somebody that can say the
[1:12:59] word but more than say the word say I
[1:13:02] will pray for you if you if you believe
[1:13:04] this I can pray for you and God can move
[1:13:06] on your
[1:13:09] behalf those are amateur
[1:13:11] Gods on the Earth
[1:13:14] today
[1:13:16] amen let's turn to Proverbs together
[1:13:27] go to Proverbs chapter
[1:13:35] 18 Proverbs chapter
[1:13:38] 18 and let's look at verse
[1:13:44] 21
[1:13:45] says death and life are in the power of
[1:13:49] the tongue and they that love it shall
[1:13:51] eat the fruit thereof I want us to to
[1:13:55] catch that and we've heard it before but
[1:13:57] really grasp it death and life are in
[1:13:59] the power of the
[1:14:01] tongue and then that love it show eat
[1:14:03] the fruit
[1:14:04] thereof let's go back to Proverbs 15 if
[1:14:07] you turn with me back to Proverbs
[1:14:10] 15 verse 4 15
[1:14:15] verse4 says a wholesome tongue is a tree
[1:14:17] of life but perverseness therein is a
[1:14:21] breach in the
[1:14:23] spirit it matters what we speak the
[1:14:27] atmosphere that's created around us is
[1:14:30] based on what we think on what we
[1:14:33] meditate on what we feed on and what we
[1:14:35] speak in our
[1:14:38] conversation and let's turn together to
[1:14:41] Matthew if you could with me like I said
[1:14:44] there's quite a few I want to read here
[1:14:45] right close
[1:14:47] together in the Book of Matthew
[1:15:02] Matthew chapter
[1:15:04] 12 verse
[1:15:07] 34 Matthew chap
[1:15:13] 12 Matthew
[1:15:16] 12:34 oh Generation of Vipers how can
[1:15:19] you being evil speak good things for out
[1:15:21] of the abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:15:23] speaketh
[1:15:25] a good man out of the good Treasure of
[1:15:26] the heart bringeth forth good things
[1:15:29] that means if you want to speak good
[1:15:30] things you must have a treasure of it
[1:15:32] already in your heart we must be feeding
[1:15:34] on good things dwelling meditating
[1:15:36] talking about good things so our heart
[1:15:38] is full of good things for a good man
[1:15:40] out of the good Treasure of his heart
[1:15:41] bringeth forth good things and an evil
[1:15:43] man out of the evil treasure bringeth
[1:15:44] forth evil things but I say unto you
[1:15:47] that Every Idle word that men shall
[1:15:49] speak they shall give account thereof in
[1:15:51] the day of judgment for by thy words
[1:15:53] Thou shalt be justified and by thy words
[1:15:56] Thou shalt be
[1:15:58] condemned this is this is a heavy
[1:16:00] statement
[1:16:02] friends but
[1:16:05] God created
[1:16:07] man and he gave him a
[1:16:12] mouth placed him on
[1:16:14] Earth and one of the first things that
[1:16:17] we know of that Adam was doing was
[1:16:19] naming the creatures he was using his
[1:16:21] mouth to express
[1:16:23] something and the economy of God because
[1:16:26] he was catching the characteristics and
[1:16:28] Natures of the animal and he was
[1:16:29] positionally placing them by giving
[1:16:31] their name and he was taking dominion
[1:16:33] and how was he taking Dominion by his
[1:16:36] mouth brother B said he could say wind
[1:16:38] stop blowing tree be plucked up what was
[1:16:41] he doing he was commanding it by his
[1:16:42] mouth why because his father commanded
[1:16:45] creation by his mouth and creation moved
[1:16:47] to the spoken word of God and so now God
[1:16:50] put in the mouth of his son spoken word
[1:16:53] and that spoken word amen when Adam was
[1:16:55] on the earth speaking the Earth obeyed
[1:16:58] Adam amen and when Jesus was here
[1:17:00] speaking the Earth obeyed Jesus and when
[1:17:02] brother benam was speaking when God
[1:17:04] commissioned him to speak the Earth and
[1:17:05] creation and molecules and atoms and all
[1:17:07] kinds of things obeyed his
[1:17:10] voice God gave us a mouth amen and and
[1:17:14] and and and you know oh praise God what
[1:17:18] I'm going to go into now condemns every
[1:17:20] one of us so just fasten your seat belt
[1:17:24] me and included me Me Maybe me the
[1:17:29] most but God gave us a
[1:17:32] mouth to speak the word he gave us a
[1:17:35] mouth for healing he gave us a mouth for
[1:17:37] virtue he gave us a mouth for life he
[1:17:39] gave us a mouth for Creative power he
[1:17:41] didn't give us a mouth to tear down and
[1:17:44] to
[1:17:45] destroy that's not why sons of God have
[1:17:47] a mouth amen even Jesus came not to
[1:17:51] condemn the world but that through him
[1:17:52] the world might have life they were
[1:17:54] condemned already ready cuz they didn't
[1:17:55] believe his coming wasn't for
[1:17:57] condemnation his coming was for life but
[1:17:59] they were condemned cuz they didn't
[1:18:00] believe already even us speaking the
[1:18:03] word it will condemn some our life of
[1:18:05] our life of the word will condemn others
[1:18:07] but that's not why I'm here I'm not here
[1:18:09] for condemnation I believe I'm here for
[1:18:12] life I believe God's got a Son of God on
[1:18:14] the earth and I want to come to my
[1:18:16] position for life not for death for life
[1:18:19] not for condemnation for salvation and
[1:18:21] healing and restoration and so people
[1:18:23] around me have better lives amen I might
[1:18:26] not be able if there's no seed Gene of
[1:18:28] God on the inside I may not bring him to
[1:18:30] a revelation of the message only God can
[1:18:32] do that but if I can sew the word into
[1:18:34] their heart and they can have a better
[1:18:36] marriage and a better life and a better
[1:18:37] relationship with their kids and be
[1:18:39] better co-workers and have respect for
[1:18:40] the things of God and someday that
[1:18:43] respect and honor for a child of God and
[1:18:45] the word of God will bring them entrance
[1:18:47] into the kingdom of God I say God my
[1:18:49] existence meant something on this
[1:18:52] Earth but God did not give the children
[1:18:55] of God a mouth for condemnation he
[1:18:57] didn't give us a mouth for ridicule he
[1:18:59] didn't give us a mouth for Strife he
[1:19:01] didn't give us a mouth for bitterness he
[1:19:03] didn't give us a mouth for any of that
[1:19:05] he gave us a mouth for the creative
[1:19:07] power of God to be expressed in this
[1:19:11] earth and like I said we say Amen
[1:19:14] because it's absolutely the truth we
[1:19:16] know it's the truth but at the same time
[1:19:18] we say oh God forgive
[1:19:20] me forgive
[1:19:22] me Jesus said there'll be a judgment for
[1:19:25] Every Idle Word spoken I'm so glad that
[1:19:27] there's a blood of Jesus Christ that
[1:19:28] when I Repent of my foolishness and my
[1:19:31] childishness and my bitterness and my
[1:19:33] offenses and my hatred that God will
[1:19:35] forgive me of that because there's so
[1:19:37] many words that I wish had never come
[1:19:38] out of my
[1:19:40] mouth I've created wrong atmospheres
[1:19:43] I've created wrong responses I I have
[1:19:45] done damage because of what's come out
[1:19:47] of my
[1:19:48] mouth and I feel I feel as ashamed as a
[1:19:51] person can
[1:19:52] feel if it wasn't for for the blood of
[1:19:55] Jesus Christ I just go sell out live
[1:19:57] under a rock somewhere in the wilderness
[1:19:59] and not try to talk until the day of my
[1:20:02] Redemption because we're still in a
[1:20:04] sticky cauber nature and we still get it
[1:20:07] wrong all the
[1:20:08] time but I'm so glad there's a tutor
[1:20:12] here that'll bring correction when we
[1:20:14] get
[1:20:17] wrong let's go to
[1:20:19] James there's no way we can discuss this
[1:20:22] subject without looking at James
[1:20:25] James chapter
[1:20:36] 1 in James chapter
[1:20:39] 1 we'll begin reading at verse
[1:20:44] 26 If any man among you seem to be
[1:20:47] religious and bridleth not his tongue
[1:20:50] but he but deceiveth his own heart this
[1:20:53] man's religion is vain
[1:20:55] pain
[1:20:57] bridleth I think most of us know what
[1:20:59] bridleth is but we may have some a
[1:21:01] bridal is like a halter with a bit that
[1:21:04] you put on a horse and you can use the
[1:21:06] bit on the horse's tongue and control
[1:21:09] the direction the horse moves by
[1:21:10] pressure on the tongue you can hold the
[1:21:12] horse back or you can steer him well it
[1:21:15] if we don't Bridle our tongue we're
[1:21:18] deceived and our religion is in vain
[1:21:21] that's what James says let's read it
[1:21:23] again If any man among you seem to be
[1:21:26] religious and bridleth not his tongue
[1:21:28] but deceiveth his own heart this man's
[1:21:31] religion is vain I don't want my
[1:21:34] religion to be vain but God give me the
[1:21:36] power to Bridle this tongue let's go to
[1:21:39] uh James chapter
[1:21:45] 3 James chapter 3 verse
[1:21:51] one says my brethren be not many Masters
[1:21:54] knowing that we shall receive the
[1:21:56] greater cond uh condemnation for in many
[1:21:59] things we offend all If any man offend
[1:22:01] not in word the same as a perfect man
[1:22:04] and able also to Bridle the whole body
[1:22:06] behold we put bits in the horse's mouth
[1:22:09] that they may obey us and we turn about
[1:22:11] their whole body behold also the ships
[1:22:15] which th though they be so great and are
[1:22:17] driven of fierce winds yet are they
[1:22:19] turned about with a very small Helm
[1:22:21] withs soever the governor listeth even
[1:22:24] so the tongue is a little member and
[1:22:26] boasteth great things behold how great a
[1:22:29] matter a little fire kindleth and the
[1:22:32] tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so
[1:22:35] is the tongue among our members that it
[1:22:37] defileth the whole body and sth on fire
[1:22:40] the course of Nature and it is set on
[1:22:42] fire of hell for every kind of Beast and
[1:22:45] of birds and of serpents and of things
[1:22:47] in the sea is tamed and has been tamed
[1:22:49] of mankind but in the tongue can no man
[1:22:52] tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly
[1:22:54] poison wherewith bless we God even the
[1:22:57] father and wherewith curse We Men which
[1:23:00] are made after the similitude of God out
[1:23:02] of the same mouth proceedeth blessing
[1:23:04] and cursing my brethren these things
[1:23:06] ought not so to be do a fountain send
[1:23:09] forth at the same place Sweet Water and
[1:23:11] bitter can the Fig Tree my brethren bear
[1:23:14] Olive berries either of Vine figs or can
[1:23:17] or can no Fountain both yield as salt
[1:23:19] water and
[1:23:22] fresh that is a hard
[1:23:27] scripture that scripture ought to make
[1:23:30] me every day at the end of the day say
[1:23:32] God forgive
[1:23:34] me God forgive me friends we're moving
[1:23:38] to
[1:23:38] adoption each one of us
[1:23:41] amen and we've got to Bridle our
[1:23:44] tongues to come to
[1:23:47] adoption now we started off speaking
[1:23:49] about the tragedy that we've seen in the
[1:23:52] country yesterday
[1:23:55] but to me it just became an example of
[1:23:57] what
[1:23:58] happens the effect of
[1:24:02] words what we saw yesterday was the
[1:24:04] effect of
[1:24:06] words and those words created an
[1:24:10] atmosphere and that atmosphere is
[1:24:12] plaguing the
[1:24:13] nation it's an atmosphere of
[1:24:16] division of hatred of bitterness and
[1:24:20] fear
[1:24:24] and everybody involves guilty so you
[1:24:28] can't say that person's guilty or that
[1:24:29] person's guilty I mean it spreads far
[1:24:33] and
[1:24:36] wide and we've we've gotten into a a
[1:24:39] scene in the United States
[1:24:42] where there's no more
[1:24:44] respect for offices there's no respect
[1:24:47] for leadership there's no respect for
[1:24:49] police officers for school teachers for
[1:24:51] presidents for Governors there's no more
[1:24:53] respect
[1:24:55] there's no more just common
[1:24:57] respect you know even brother brandham
[1:24:59] he he said America made a horrible
[1:25:01] mistake when it voted in uh John F
[1:25:03] Kennedy because it was our first
[1:25:05] Catholic President and the nation was
[1:25:06] founded to get away from that kind of uh
[1:25:09] uh control of a Catholic
[1:25:11] church and he he disagreed but he never
[1:25:14] spoke evil to that man he says now he's
[1:25:15] a pretty good man he said he'll probably
[1:25:17] make a good president he never he never
[1:25:21] he he disagreed he thought it was a
[1:25:23] travesty it never should have happened
[1:25:24] in America but he never began to
[1:25:27] belittle that human
[1:25:29] being even disagreeing with him there's
[1:25:32] nothing wrong with disagreeing but the
[1:25:34] bitter
[1:25:35] belittling is the something the prophet
[1:25:37] did not did did not display to us
[1:25:40] neither did Jesus Christ when he was
[1:25:41] here we never saw
[1:25:43] that and so now the the mudsling that's
[1:25:47] taking place the the the mocking the
[1:25:49] bitterness the hatred the lies the the
[1:25:53] extreme statements and comments it's
[1:25:55] it's all got people worked up into a
[1:25:57] frenzy on both sides it's a frenzied
[1:25:59] state of excitement one that can create
[1:26:02] what we saw on on January 6th which was
[1:26:05] an absolute travesty the one that we saw
[1:26:07] yesterday which was an absolute travesty
[1:26:09] you've got a situation where a a young
[1:26:11] man who's 20 years old listen I know
[1:26:14] some of you are 20 and think you're
[1:26:15] smart but a 20-year-old don't know
[1:26:18] nothing he's a kid and he doesn't know
[1:26:20] nothing he has no life experience he has
[1:26:22] no understanding he's heard a bunch of
[1:26:25] rhetoric and hateful speech and somebody
[1:26:27] swed fear and hate into his
[1:26:30] heart over things he probably doesn't
[1:26:34] comprehend issues he probably is not
[1:26:36] well versed in things he doesn't
[1:26:38] understand and he can't sort out what's
[1:26:40] true and not true and that 20-year-old
[1:26:42] man will climb up on a building because
[1:26:44] of that and he'll try to assassinate a
[1:26:46] former president who's running for a
[1:26:48] presidency and so doing he'll mortally
[1:26:50] wound and kill innocent bystander and
[1:26:53] and and CR critically injure two others
[1:26:55] and he himself will lose his life over
[1:26:58] what over
[1:27:02] words
[1:27:05] words even when John F Kennedy was
[1:27:07] assassinated brother B had the whole
[1:27:08] church stand and
[1:27:11] pray pray for his family and pray for
[1:27:14] the
[1:27:15] nation you know it's the prophet of God
[1:27:17] who told us that America's finished
[1:27:19] she's done she had her chance in 56 she
[1:27:21] didn't repent he said I no longer pray
[1:27:23] for her downhill from here I believe
[1:27:25] that absolutely the truth and and we see
[1:27:27] it we see it manifesting right before
[1:27:29] our eyes America is
[1:27:31] disintegrating but brother B still said
[1:27:34] I'm I'm happy to be an American and I
[1:27:36] thank God that he's put me
[1:27:38] here am and I'm still thankful to be
[1:27:41] here Hey listen you could have Bor been
[1:27:43] born in LA or
[1:27:45] Vietnam I'm pretty thankful to be born
[1:27:48] as bad as it is I'm still thankful we
[1:27:49] can sit here and worship this way
[1:27:55] but there's no a America's done she's
[1:27:58] turned her back on God she is finished
[1:28:01] it's heartbreaking it doesn't bring us
[1:28:03] joy it's not pleasurable to say those
[1:28:06] things it's still the country we live in
[1:28:08] it's still our home it's still where we
[1:28:10] have to dwell until we get out of here
[1:28:12] and I'm so thankful God's painted
[1:28:13] another picture for us or we would be a
[1:28:15] pretty depressed
[1:28:17] people so we know the way it has to go
[1:28:19] but that that doesn't mean I need to
[1:28:21] join into the political Fray and start
[1:28:23] using a mouth that God wants to ordain
[1:28:25] to speak the word of God and start
[1:28:27] speaking hate speech and rhetoric and
[1:28:29] ridicule and mocking
[1:28:32] and it's not for
[1:28:34] me God forgive me for those things but
[1:28:38] that it's not for me it's not for a
[1:28:40] child of God that that's going to go the
[1:28:42] way it's going to go without our
[1:28:46] participation but there ought to be sons
[1:28:48] of God on the earth that sound a
[1:28:49] different
[1:28:50] sound not get swept up in all of these
[1:28:53] things and and talk like the world talks
[1:28:55] we should have a different sound all
[1:28:57] together we have a voice amen that
[1:28:59] resonates and we know the voice of God
[1:29:01] will be in the bride and the voice of
[1:29:03] God in the bride he wants to use the
[1:29:04] mouth of the Bride to proclaim the word
[1:29:06] to Proclaim love to Proclaim Liberty and
[1:29:08] healing and health and all of those
[1:29:10] things not to not to become talking
[1:29:13] points for news media
[1:29:16] broadcasters it's not what God gave us a
[1:29:18] mouth
[1:29:19] for and when I look at what happened in
[1:29:22] the nation it became such a
[1:29:25] visible such a a a visible
[1:29:28] display of the power of mankind to
[1:29:32] create this atmosphere in the country
[1:29:34] was
[1:29:36] created it was created by speech and
[1:29:40] conduct and
[1:29:42] actions on both
[1:29:48] sides it it's the power of man to create
[1:29:52] his own atmosphere
[1:29:56] what is the atmosphere that we have in
[1:29:58] America right now it's the atmosphere
[1:30:00] that the Americans have
[1:30:04] created who are you going to blame for
[1:30:07] the fighting and the strife and the hate
[1:30:10] who else is to
[1:30:11] blame the Americans themselves are to
[1:30:14] blame right you say what's the news
[1:30:16] media who's watching
[1:30:19] them how are they getting their
[1:30:21] money and who's repeating what they're
[1:30:24] hearing on the
[1:30:26] broadcast this is the power God says man
[1:30:29] will create his own
[1:30:31] hell and we can see he's doing
[1:30:34] it man will create his own hell because
[1:30:37] man was made a little Creator and now
[1:30:40] this whole atmosphere has been created
[1:30:42] by
[1:30:45] words said God that's I don't want to be
[1:30:48] any part of
[1:30:49] it but I want to be part of the sons of
[1:30:53] God on the earth that are here for
[1:30:56] something
[1:30:57] else but then I began to look at that
[1:30:59] and
[1:31:00] think that poor young man the other man
[1:31:04] who lost his life those who are
[1:31:05] critically injured their their families
[1:31:07] everybody who was there that day
[1:31:09] everybody who heard and the screams and
[1:31:11] the and the images or the memories that
[1:31:13] will be in their mind it's it's a
[1:31:14] horrible travesty and you think and it's
[1:31:17] always who's the blame who's the blame
[1:31:19] was there a let down in security was it
[1:31:21] the rhetoric of the news media was it
[1:31:23] the left was it the right was it social
[1:31:25] media was
[1:31:25] [Music]
[1:31:27] it you realize everybody's to
[1:31:33] blame
[1:31:37] and I thought about that rally I mean
[1:31:39] everybody's there for a political
[1:31:41] candidate they're all rallying they're
[1:31:43] all trying to support and
[1:31:48] they're and
[1:31:50] there's shots that ring out because of
[1:31:54] hate
[1:31:57] rhetoric and we're happy we're thankful
[1:32:01] that the former president Trump wasn't
[1:32:04] assassinated but somebody behind him one
[1:32:06] of his supporters is dead two of them
[1:32:09] are critically
[1:32:11] wounded and who's responsible for
[1:32:14] that and then it dawned on me he
[1:32:21] is he helped create that atmosphere
[1:32:25] he capitalized on the bitterness and the
[1:32:28] hate to gain
[1:32:31] support not all his fault there's a lot
[1:32:34] to
[1:32:36] blame then all of a sudden it hit me I
[1:32:39] come
[1:32:41] home when things happen in my
[1:32:44] home whose fault is
[1:32:47] it my
[1:32:48] church my realm of influence my job site
[1:32:54] yeah you always want to blame everybody
[1:32:57] else when something bad
[1:32:59] happens you remember
[1:33:02] Elisha after Elijah went up in a in a
[1:33:05] whirlwind and Elisha's walking up the
[1:33:07] road and these these children run out
[1:33:10] and began to make fun of him said go up
[1:33:11] go up thou Baldhead and he cursed them
[1:33:13] and two she bears come out of the woods
[1:33:15] and destroyed them amen it's a tragic
[1:33:18] story and and brother R said that wasn't
[1:33:21] the spirit of Christ and Elisha that was
[1:33:24] an angry
[1:33:25] prophet and everybody looks at Elisha
[1:33:27] and says that was terrible but brother
[1:33:29] Brenham tells us a
[1:33:31] backstory he says those children heard
[1:33:34] their parents mocking and
[1:33:37] criticizing mocking and criticizing
[1:33:40] Elisha amen and they were only out in
[1:33:43] public doing what was doing private what
[1:33:45] who's who's the
[1:33:47] blame it's not like Elisha's innocent
[1:33:50] because brother B said that was wrong
[1:33:52] that was an angry Prophet that wasn't
[1:33:53] the Spirit of Christ but those parents
[1:33:55] who want to throw stones at Elisha and
[1:33:57] how could he call the she Bears out
[1:33:58] really those kids would have never been
[1:34:00] there if your mouth had been used for
[1:34:02] the right
[1:34:08] thing
[1:34:10] amen that's why I said let's put our
[1:34:12] seat bels
[1:34:15] on because there's times that we hear
[1:34:19] things we I hear my children sometimes
[1:34:21] criticize people or say things and
[1:34:24] I think where did they get that that's
[1:34:25] so rough
[1:34:27] and kind to come down and be honest
[1:34:30] they've heard dad do
[1:34:34] it like God forgive
[1:34:38] me God forgive me that they would go say
[1:34:40] something to somebody that would curse
[1:34:46] them who's the blame if something bad
[1:34:49] happened to them I would blame that
[1:34:51] other person and be so mad and
[1:34:57] we realize my mouth was not given to me
[1:35:01] to be critical
[1:35:03] judgmental it wasn't for malice or
[1:35:06] Strife or bitterness or
[1:35:09] anger God gave me a mouth for life for
[1:35:13] creation for
[1:35:16] healing God help me to be an amateur
[1:35:20] God help me
[1:35:24] you say this is the rise of the imate
[1:35:26] your Gods hallelujah praise the Lord to
[1:35:29] whom much is given much is
[1:35:33] required Paul was on earth and the
[1:35:35] Apostle Paul you know he's trying to go
[1:35:38] about his business he's trying to do his
[1:35:39] ministry he's trying to work the
[1:35:40] ministry and he's got a suer following
[1:35:43] him creating a scandal behind him
[1:35:44] screaming out and they these men are men
[1:35:46] of God come to tell us the truth of the
[1:35:48] way and everybody knows who she is and
[1:35:50] this is a scandalous situation and it's
[1:35:52] probably getting under
[1:35:55] skin but there's not a thing in the
[1:35:57] world he can do about it because he's a
[1:35:59] prisoner to Jesus Christ he's a man
[1:36:01] under control and he doesn't say
[1:36:02] anything until God gives him the
[1:36:04] permission and when God gives him
[1:36:05] permission he turns and he cast that
[1:36:07] demon out of that woman so he can be
[1:36:08] free from that but how long did he have
[1:36:10] to endure with it he had to endure with
[1:36:12] it until God told him to
[1:36:15] speak because he had power under
[1:36:19] control an anointing is is is supreme
[1:36:22] anointing is under is power under
[1:36:26] control and that's where he
[1:36:29] was see in the book of Jude Jude chapter
[1:36:32] 1 you don't need to turn there I'm just
[1:36:33] going to quote it quickly Jude chapter
[1:36:34] 1:8 says likewise also these filthy
[1:36:36] dreamers defile the flesh despise
[1:36:39] Dominion speak evil of dignities Yet
[1:36:42] Michael the Archangel when contending
[1:36:44] with the devil he disputed about the
[1:36:46] body of Moses dur not bring against him
[1:36:49] a railing accusation but said the Lord
[1:36:52] rebuke thee
[1:36:54] amen listen I would think Michael could
[1:36:56] say whatever he wanted to the devil
[1:36:59] right but even he bridled his
[1:37:07] tongue see we see the political scene in
[1:37:10] the United States and right and left and
[1:37:12] and red and blue and and and all kinds
[1:37:16] of extreme statements and you know this
[1:37:19] one's going to be a dictator and this
[1:37:20] one's going to be this and it's sad
[1:37:24] sad I mean it's literally sad and and
[1:37:27] the reality is it's a horribly sad
[1:37:30] situation it's embarrassing none of us
[1:37:33] it's a shame it's a
[1:37:36] disgrace but it's not for me to throw my
[1:37:38] hat in and add disgrace to disgrace it's
[1:37:41] disgraceful America now is on the
[1:37:43] outside what it is on the inside it's
[1:37:45] displaying to the world what it actually
[1:37:49] is but you know this atmosphere can come
[1:37:53] into the church
[1:37:56] too you just pick an issue any issue you
[1:38:00] want that comes up in the church you can
[1:38:04] polarize you can begin to defend and
[1:38:06] talk behind closed doors and begin to
[1:38:08] get together a grassroot hazards and
[1:38:10] then all of a sudden the conversation
[1:38:12] isn't well my brother believes this but
[1:38:14] I have this idea and I think this is a
[1:38:16] better way and that then it becomes I
[1:38:18] don't even know if they have the spirit
[1:38:19] of
[1:38:20] God they're not part of us they don't
[1:38:23] see it our way I and and you know what
[1:38:25] they did too and you know and because of
[1:38:27] this and this I don't even know if
[1:38:28] they're right with
[1:38:30] god listen don't don't think it doesn't
[1:38:33] happen it's happening all the time right
[1:38:36] you pick your issue you pick your issue
[1:38:39] not not just in a local assembly but you
[1:38:41] pick your issue in a family you pick
[1:38:42] your issue in a local assembly you pick
[1:38:43] it in the message worldwide and you can
[1:38:45] have the same thing that's going on in
[1:38:47] the United States happening right with
[1:38:49] ministers throwing darts at each other
[1:38:51] and P the congregation picking it up and
[1:38:53] sewing negative seed all I can say is
[1:38:55] God please stop my mouth and help me not
[1:38:58] to get caught up in
[1:39:01] rhetoric I'm ashamed for speaking with
[1:39:04] offense I'm ashamed for ridicule I'm
[1:39:06] ashamed for ever saying anything that
[1:39:07] would swow a negative seed in anybody
[1:39:09] else's mind I'm ashamed of myself
[1:39:12] because what we saw yesterday is the
[1:39:14] power of the
[1:39:19] tongue
[1:39:21] God if I give all myself to you it's
[1:39:24] even this little
[1:39:26] tongue
[1:39:28] amen this is not this is not our
[1:39:31] business you know we have no problem
[1:39:34] disagreeing with one another I mean we
[1:39:37] can
[1:39:38] disagree for
[1:39:41] hours but we disagree on an issue we
[1:39:44] disagree on a subject we disagree on a
[1:39:48] decision we don't disagree about whether
[1:39:50] we're brothers or not we don't disagree
[1:39:52] about both of us loving God and where
[1:39:54] our Eternal destination is and we're not
[1:39:56] disagreeing on who's the real Christian
[1:39:58] and who's the impostor that's not what
[1:40:00] we're that's when you take this that's
[1:40:02] that's what they've done in this nation
[1:40:04] between these two candidates and between
[1:40:05] the the two parties they've made they
[1:40:08] made one socialist and one dictatorship
[1:40:10] and and then they make extreme
[1:40:11] statements and we're going we got Stalin
[1:40:13] and we got this and that and oh my
[1:40:14] goodness we we we we what have you done
[1:40:17] with the extreme statements you
[1:40:18] polarized people you got people who are
[1:40:20] angry mobs are breaking out people are
[1:40:22] stopping traffic in the street throwing
[1:40:24] stones yelling at each other causing all
[1:40:26] kinds of strife in workplaces and in
[1:40:28] families and my goodness why is this
[1:40:30] going
[1:40:32] on instead of just saying I disagree
[1:40:35] with that point because of XYZ not
[1:40:38] saying well you're nothing but a this
[1:40:40] and you're a this and a that and a that
[1:40:41] and you're going to do this that and the
[1:40:46] other amen we can do the same thing to
[1:40:49] our
[1:40:50] brothers say God don't let me do do that
[1:40:54] cuz I do not want to be guilty of
[1:40:56] character
[1:40:58] assassination help me God help me say
[1:41:03] God put in me your
[1:41:05] love if you so L the world that you gave
[1:41:08] your only begotten put that love in
[1:41:10] me amen he called right right and wrong
[1:41:13] wrong that was no problem but when he
[1:41:15] was standing before Pilate he didn't he
[1:41:17] didn't ridicule him he didn't say you're
[1:41:19] only a this I mean when he stood before
[1:41:21] chasis he he never never called him
[1:41:24] dirty names and he never told him you're
[1:41:26] this and that and you're going to here
[1:41:27] and you're going there he never did any
[1:41:29] of
[1:41:30] that I mean the Apostle Paul didn't do
[1:41:33] it either when the Apostle Paul was
[1:41:34] standing there amen and he and he made a
[1:41:36] comment according to the law he brought
[1:41:38] a he brought a correction according to
[1:41:40] the law and one of the standing nearby
[1:41:41] smoted him in the mouth and said how
[1:41:43] dare you speak to the high priest he
[1:41:45] apologized CU he said I didn't know that
[1:41:46] he was the high priest I'm sorry because
[1:41:48] the Bible says don't speak evil against
[1:41:51] the ruler of my people right
[1:41:54] look at the example that we've had we
[1:41:57] don't need to tear down I mean listen if
[1:42:00] we want to find if we want to criticize
[1:42:01] we can criticize every Minister who
[1:42:04] preaches because they're all human
[1:42:06] beings and they all got something wrong
[1:42:07] and in every sermon they probably got
[1:42:09] something
[1:42:10] wrong so if you detail out every sermon
[1:42:13] they probably got a story wrong a fact
[1:42:15] wrong a date wrong a name wrong they
[1:42:17] probably said it wrong and they and they
[1:42:19] and they may have accidentally injected
[1:42:20] some of their own thinking because we're
[1:42:22] human beings that's right and if you
[1:42:24] want to criticize you've got all the
[1:42:27] fuel in the world brother bham said if
[1:42:28] you come to criticize you'll get
[1:42:31] plenty that's what he said of his own
[1:42:33] men you'll get plenty and if you've got
[1:42:35] that spirit amen that wants to tear
[1:42:37] something down so you can build yourself
[1:42:39] up because that's what we're seeing in
[1:42:41] this nation if I tear down then I'm
[1:42:43] better if I can pull out flaws that
[1:42:44] means I've got it right that doesn't
[1:42:46] mean you've got it right any more than
[1:42:48] the one who's got the moat in his eyes
[1:42:49] finding the Splinter in the other ones
[1:42:51] or the beam looking at the
[1:42:53] remote just because we can find fault in
[1:42:56] the ministry we can find fault in the
[1:42:58] teaching we can find fault in this
[1:43:00] doesn't mean that all of the sudden I've
[1:43:02] got it all figured out you might be the
[1:43:04] one with the beam shooting out of your
[1:43:05] mouth your eye and you're saying look at
[1:43:08] that he got that WR that's not brother
[1:43:10] Brenham said this before
[1:43:13] that sorry sorry
[1:43:16] brother I'm ducking that beam that's
[1:43:18] coming out of your
[1:43:21] eye that's not the the way we're
[1:43:23] supposed to treat one another that's not
[1:43:26] why God called us to be a family of God
[1:43:28] that's not the way we're supposed to
[1:43:29] treat other human
[1:43:31] beings not our neighbors not our
[1:43:33] co-workers not the people who treat us
[1:43:35] evil we're not supposed to treat them
[1:43:37] that
[1:43:38] way but we're supposed to be kind to
[1:43:40] them do good unto them and therefore
[1:43:43] heaping hot coals upon their
[1:43:46] head we sure shouldn't be doing it to
[1:43:48] one
[1:43:50] another so to me we see travesty in
[1:43:54] America I see travesty in Chad
[1:43:57] Lamb I see the same error I seen there
[1:44:00] the same error in
[1:44:03] me it's it's easy to point and say that
[1:44:06] that was CNN's fault that was because of
[1:44:15] MSNBC if
[1:44:17] we have ever participated in mocking our
[1:44:20] leadership and criticizing and
[1:44:22] ridiculing maybe we had a part to play
[1:44:30] too maybe what we should just do is take
[1:44:32] The Godly example that's been given to
[1:44:35] us through the Bible and bridle our
[1:44:38] tongues and say God I really want to be
[1:44:43] an amateur God I don't want to be a
[1:44:46] hybrid product and I don't want to get
[1:44:47] the power you've given me and I don't
[1:44:49] want to misuse it and abuse it
[1:44:53] listen if we tear
[1:44:55] down every one of our brothers and
[1:44:58] sisters we're going to have if we as men
[1:45:00] do it we're going to have wives and
[1:45:01] children that don't trust
[1:45:03] anybody that don't know who's real and
[1:45:05] not real and what Ministry to touch and
[1:45:07] what Ministry not to touch because
[1:45:09] they've all got some fault because Dad
[1:45:10] said something negative about every one
[1:45:12] of
[1:45:14] them and then we get upset when the
[1:45:17] church didn't do enough to save our
[1:45:19] children and they ran away but who did
[1:45:22] they Trust yes when every one of them's
[1:45:24] been picked apart at home every one of
[1:45:26] them had fault finding missions taken
[1:45:28] out on them and all the leadership and
[1:45:31] now all the deacons and I wouldn't have
[1:45:33] picked that one and I wouldn't have
[1:45:34] picked this one and the trustees this
[1:45:36] and the and the not Sunday school
[1:45:38] teacher this what kind of seeds are we
[1:45:40] sewing into one another when we make
[1:45:41] statements like
[1:45:44] that and then things escalate and then
[1:45:47] things blow up and then there's Church
[1:45:48] splits and then there's Division and
[1:45:50] this family won't talk to this family
[1:45:52] and it's wor words most of the time it's
[1:45:56] words words from an unbridled tongue
[1:45:59] words from a son or daughter of God Amen
[1:46:01] who needs to say God forgive me help me
[1:46:04] I want this mouth to be used for your
[1:46:06] glory healing and strength and virtue
[1:46:09] and edification of the body of Christ
[1:46:11] needs to come out of this
[1:46:13] mouth
[1:46:15] amen if I disagree with a brother
[1:46:18] strongly enough to think that he's got a
[1:46:19] big problem then I should be manad
[1:46:21] enough to and loving enough to go go
[1:46:23] talk to him about the
[1:46:25] problem help me
[1:46:27] God help me help me help me
[1:46:31] God in Galatians chapter 5 let's turn
[1:46:35] there
[1:46:46] together I've driven down the street and
[1:46:49] been so appalled to see in the yards of
[1:46:52] people
[1:46:53] signs with the viest language possible
[1:46:56] referring to the president of the United
[1:46:58] States how did we get to this
[1:47:03] place how do we get to the place we can
[1:47:05] look at a brother who loves this message
[1:47:08] and served God all of his life how can
[1:47:10] we get to the place where we can look at
[1:47:11] a brother and and call him serpent
[1:47:14] seed or say he's not even called to the
[1:47:17] ministry how do you know he's not called
[1:47:19] to the
[1:47:21] ministry how could you say such a thing
[1:47:24] and who's in earshot when you say it and
[1:47:26] what did it do to them when you said
[1:47:30] that what kind of reality does that
[1:47:32] begin what kind of atmosphere starts
[1:47:35] from that
[1:47:37] seed see we do the same thing as
[1:47:40] Believers to one another that's
[1:47:42] happening in our
[1:47:43] country and it ought not to be named
[1:47:46] amongst us and I'm asking God to help me
[1:47:50] CU I'm
[1:47:51] guilty Lord I'm guilty I'm guilty of
[1:47:54] being too critical I'm guilty of bad
[1:47:57] mouthing I may not have called names but
[1:47:59] I get up here and I say these other
[1:48:00] ministers this and this and in your mind
[1:48:02] you're going what other
[1:48:03] ministers say God forgive me yes our
[1:48:07] ministers going to do things wrong
[1:48:09] always it'll always be in the church and
[1:48:11] it will always
[1:48:12] happen but you know what I want my
[1:48:15] brother to be my brother and my brother
[1:48:16] fails and if he leaves he fails and he
[1:48:18] leaves but I I don't want it to be
[1:48:20] because of me
[1:48:24] things are wrong they need to be said
[1:48:26] wrong things are taught wrong they need
[1:48:28] to be taught right things that come
[1:48:30] across wrong need to be said I don't
[1:48:31] agree with that I believe that's wrong
[1:48:33] this is the way I believe it that's
[1:48:35] wonderful but leave a brother a brother
[1:48:38] and don't touch God's
[1:48:41] anointed let God deal with them don't
[1:48:44] touch your brother or your sister leave
[1:48:46] your mouth off of them and let God take
[1:48:48] care of it
[1:48:54] Galatians

[1:49:05] been called un Liberty Liberty only use

[1:49:13] the laws fulfilled in one word even this
[1:49:15] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:49:19] but if you bite and devour one another

[1:49:32] not let it happen in the church in The
[1:49:35] Bride of Jesus Christ let's not I don't
[1:49:39] want to be a participant I don't for my
[1:49:41] failures in the past I've asked God to
[1:49:43] forgive me and I pray he helps me never
[1:49:45] fail again if I do I pray that his
[1:49:47] spirit will rebuke me quickly because I
[1:49:50] don't want to be guilty of these things
[1:49:53] I want to I want to love God and love
[1:49:57] his
[1:49:58] children
[1:50:00] man God knows how to sort everything out

[1:50:05] knew how to take care of the Romans in
[1:50:06] Daniel's day he knew how to take care of
[1:50:08] the Lions he knew how to take care of
[1:50:09] those that opposed Daniel he knew how to
[1:50:11] take care of the wrong King and he God
[1:50:13] knew how to take care of it
[1:50:17] all God knows what he's
[1:50:20] doing amen but let me use my mouth for
[1:50:25] life and Christ is the mystery of God
[1:50:27] revealed brother benam comes and gives a
[1:50:29] warning to the church at the beginning
[1:50:30] and I'm just going to pick up the last
[1:50:32] part of it says cuz we're in the last
[1:50:35] days where the Bible exhorted us to much
[1:50:37] more as we see that day approaching to
[1:50:38] love one another with Christian love and
[1:50:40] divine love to assemble ourselves
[1:50:42] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:50:45] Jesus and love one another this will all
[1:50:47] men know that you are my disciples when
[1:50:49] you have love one for the other that's
[1:50:51] right stay right together if the brother
[1:50:54] you think he's a little wrong or the
[1:50:56] sister say Lord don't let me never have
[1:50:58] the root of bitterness spring up cuz
[1:51:00] it'll affect him it'll take the Christ
[1:51:02] right out of my life that poison acids
[1:51:05] of malice and jealousy and hatred that
[1:51:07] will just take the Holy Spirit right
[1:51:09] right away from you it will run him from
[1:51:12] the Tabernacle it will kill the spirit
[1:51:14] of God or drive it away from here it
[1:51:16] hurt your pastor it'll do everything
[1:51:18] don't you do that you just wax that much
[1:51:21] closer together take take the Buckle as
[1:51:23] another brother testified I minister to
[1:51:24] here the other night about having the
[1:51:26] Buckle see and in a vision that buckle
[1:51:29] on the whole armor of God just pull her
[1:51:31] on tighten up move right up close to one
[1:51:33] another love one another anyhow talk
[1:51:35] nice about one another now listen this
[1:51:37] state this last statement just catch it
[1:51:40] talk nice about one another say nice
[1:51:42] things about one another and then God
[1:51:44] will bless you I want the blessings of
[1:51:47] God he's made it simple draw up close
[1:51:49] together love one another anyhow and say
[1:51:50] nice things about each other and then
[1:51:52] God will bless
[1:51:53] you you know you know the easiest way
[1:51:57] you you you watch political
[1:51:59] rallies you can get people in a fervor
[1:52:02] and a frenzy over an issue that they
[1:52:04] probably don't even really
[1:52:07] understand really when you break it down
[1:52:09] the people probably don't even
[1:52:10] comprehend the complexity of it the
[1:52:12] nature the cost and how how the laws
[1:52:15] actually work and how you would actually
[1:52:16] accomplish certain things they probably
[1:52:18] have no idea what the issue actually is
[1:52:21] and the complexity behind it but you get
[1:52:23] a talking point over an issue and when
[1:52:25] we get the talking point over an issue
[1:52:27] then you can create an enemy when you
[1:52:29] can create an enemy you can create a
[1:52:31] rally and you can work people into a
[1:52:32] frenzy by having a common
[1:52:36] enemy we can do it in church so easy
[1:52:40] friends if all of a sudden I come here
[1:52:42] and I want to get people in a frenzy
[1:52:44] whipped into a frenzy all I got to do is
[1:52:46] say they say we can't they say we don't
[1:52:49] they're talking about us yeah as soon as
[1:52:52] I start doing that what do you do
[1:52:54] immediately who's doing that who and
[1:52:55] you're ready to fight and then and then
[1:52:57] if I start telling you other ministers
[1:52:59] are attacking me you're Pastor they're
[1:53:00] saying this on the they're saying that
[1:53:02] you're ready to fight for me because you
[1:53:04] love me then I pick an issue whatever
[1:53:06] the issue is I start beating my my my my
[1:53:09] drum on that issue and pretty soon
[1:53:11] everybody in the church is in a fighting
[1:53:13] frenzy ready to go to fight at those
[1:53:15] people are saying those things about our
[1:53:18] pastor and our church and don't even
[1:53:20] understand what the real issue is
[1:53:23] you can make a good camp meeting on they
[1:53:25] versus
[1:53:30] us it's a political
[1:53:33] rally and I don't want to be part of a
[1:53:36] political rally I don't want to
[1:53:37] participate I don't want to add rhetoric
[1:53:39] I don't want to do anything to fuel that
[1:53:41] fire and God forgive me for ever coming
[1:53:44] and fueling a fire like that by saying
[1:53:46] things like that God knows my heart I am
[1:53:49] as sorry as sorry can be
[1:53:52] what I want to do is talk about the
[1:53:55] issue yeah the point the word of God the
[1:53:59] Life of Christ the message of the hour
[1:54:01] life and edification and healing and
[1:54:04] nurture and everything God's given us
[1:54:06] what unites us and ties us together
[1:54:08] gives us overcoming power brings us into
[1:54:10] adoption and takes us out of this Earth
[1:54:12] and puts us back as Sons and Daughters
[1:54:14] let's talk about the issue amen and if
[1:54:17] something's wrong we'll correct it man
[1:54:19] but we don't labor on the correction we
[1:54:21] just say that's a wrong this is a right
[1:54:23] understanding let's keep moving
[1:54:25] [Music]
[1:54:28] forward oh man that's a rally that's
[1:54:32] something to Rally around amen that's
[1:54:34] something to Rally forth that's life
[1:54:36] amen that's Redemption that's Christ
[1:54:38] amen that's the message amen but we can
[1:54:41] get a rally so fast on us and them and
[1:54:43] we're this and they're that and they say
[1:54:45] this about us and and it ends up being
[1:54:48] unqualified
[1:54:49] statements a whole slew of unqualified
[1:54:52] white statements right
[1:54:57] right God please help
[1:55:00] us these cocko bur Natures are
[1:55:03] filthy they're
[1:55:06] decrepid they are a hindrance to our
[1:55:08] life they are absolute thorns in our
[1:55:12] flesh help us
[1:55:18] gone brother bam says in the paman
[1:55:20] church age he says there it is he is a
[1:55:24] spirit and he is life that is exactly
[1:55:26] what the word is that is exactly what
[1:55:27] Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit
[1:55:30] born Spirit-filled man in faith takes
[1:55:32] the word into his heart and places it
[1:55:34] upon his lips why that is the same as
[1:55:36] deity
[1:55:38] speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan
[1:55:41] cannot stand before that man when God
[1:55:44] drops a revelation of a word in the
[1:55:46] heart of a child of God and it comes
[1:55:48] from his heart to his lips that has
[1:55:50] creative power that is deity speaking
[1:55:53] Every Mountain he said has to go why God
[1:55:55] is using the mouth of his children to
[1:55:57] perform his word that's what I want my
[1:56:00] mouth reserved for that's what I my
[1:56:01] heart reserved for that's what I want my
[1:56:03] mind reserved
[1:56:04] for we live in a leodan culture we live
[1:56:08] in a a a cancel culture we live in a a a
[1:56:13] social media hype and oh it's just
[1:56:17] ridiculous most of it has no
[1:56:20] substance it's just rhetoric rhetoric
[1:56:22] that gets inflamed and then passions get
[1:56:24] inflamed over things where people are
[1:56:26] Marching on the street and they don't
[1:56:27] really understand the issue they're
[1:56:28] marching
[1:56:31] about but you realize that's the
[1:56:34] atmosphere we're immersed in and we have
[1:56:35] a sticky cber nature we got to keep
[1:56:37] ourselves washed away from
[1:56:40] that wash me out of that I don't need
[1:56:43] that what I need is life lifegiving word
[1:56:46] amen I need to be under the the Fountain
[1:56:48] of the word to be cleansed from all of
[1:56:50] that things to keep my mind my mouth my
[1:56:53] heart everything focused on
[1:56:57] Christ amen I hope that's not how we
[1:57:00] learn how to deal with issues with one
[1:57:02] another and in our
[1:57:05] homes that' be
[1:57:08] sad let's go to First Peter 3 together I
[1:57:11] want to read a couple more scriptures as
[1:57:13] we wind down to a close
[1:57:27] 1 Peter chapter
[1:57:30] 3 in verse 8 1 Peter chap
[1:57:36] 3:8 says finally be you all of One mind
[1:57:40] having compassion one of another love
[1:57:42] his Brethren be pitiful be courteous not
[1:57:44] rendering evil for evil or railing for
[1:57:46] railing but contrary wise blessing
[1:57:49] knowing that ye are there there unto
[1:57:51] called that you should inherit a
[1:57:53] blessing for he that will love life and
[1:57:55] see good days let him refrain his tongue
[1:57:58] from evil and his lips that speak no
[1:58:02] guile let him escue evil and do good let
[1:58:05] him seek peace and ensue it for the eyes
[1:58:07] of the Lord are over the righteous and
[1:58:08] his ears are open un their prayers but
[1:58:10] the face of the Lord is against them
[1:58:13] that do evil let's go to Ephesians
[1:58:19] now this is the scripture I want to
[1:58:21] leave you with the last scripture I'd
[1:58:23] like to read this
[1:58:25] morning Ephesians chapter
[1:58:33] 4 Ephesians chapter 4:
[1:58:38] 29 let no corrupt communication proceed
[1:58:41] out of your mouth but that which is good
[1:58:44] to the use of edifying that it may
[1:58:46] Minister Grace unto the
[1:58:49] hearers let that scripture be a theme
[1:58:52] for
[1:58:53] us I think I need it before my eyes
[1:58:57] constantly let no corrupt communication
[1:59:00] proceed out of your mouth but that which
[1:59:02] is good to the use of edifying that's
[1:59:04] building
[1:59:06] up that it may Minister Grace unto the
[1:59:11] hearers that's why God gave me a
[1:59:14] mouth that's why I'm on this Earth
[1:59:16] that's why he's giv me the word that's
[1:59:17] why I have a mouth I want to use it for
[1:59:20] edification and to and to give grace to
[1:59:22] the
[1:59:23] hearers to speak
[1:59:25] life may God use my mouth for
[1:59:28] that power of life and death lay in the
[1:59:32] tongue happy is the man that eats the
[1:59:34] fruit thereof remember Abraham when
[1:59:37] Abraham in in Genesis I think Genesis 22
[1:59:40] Abraham is called of God to go and
[1:59:42] sacrifice Isaac's son and they're moving
[1:59:45] along towards the the place of sacrifice
[1:59:48] God told him where to go and he's
[1:59:49] journeying three days and and they get
[1:59:51] to the place where he's going to
[1:59:52] separate from the two servants that are
[1:59:53] with him and listen to what Abraham says
[1:59:56] Abraham is a Son of God on this Earth
[1:59:59] and Abraham says you two stay with the
[2:00:01] donkey here the lad and I will go forth
[2:00:03] in worship and shall return
[2:00:07] again something popped out of his
[2:00:12] mouth because there was something in his
[2:00:15] heart when you read through the
[2:00:17] scripture there in Genesis you can't see
[2:00:19] what was in his heart but when you go
[2:00:20] over to Hebrews 11 you find out what was
[2:00:23] in his heart he says Abraham amen when
[2:00:26] he went to offer Isaac as a sacrifice he
[2:00:28] believed he reckon that God was able to
[2:00:31] bring him back from the dead as he
[2:00:33] received him in a tithe so what is in
[2:00:35] Abraham's heart as Abraham's moving
[2:00:37] along in his three-day Journey with his
[2:00:39] son he's going over the word of God in
[2:00:42] his mind amen he's not speaking evil
[2:00:44] he's not saying why me why do I have to
[2:00:46] be the one nobody else has had to do
[2:00:47] this he keeps going through the promise
[2:00:49] in his mind where God came to me he said
[2:00:52] I didn't go to God God came to me I
[2:00:54] didn't ask the promise he promised me a
[2:00:56] seed amen when I asked him he told it
[2:00:58] would come from my loins when I thought
[2:00:59] it was is he told me no it was Isaac
[2:01:01] that would come from Sarah and this is
[2:01:03] Isaac that came from Sarah so he's
[2:01:05] dwelling and meditating on the word of
[2:01:07] God he's got faith in his heart
[2:01:09] accounting and all of the sudden he
[2:01:11] tells his he tells these two attendants
[2:01:13] he says you stay here the lad and I will
[2:01:15] go and worship and come back listen he
[2:01:17] didn't at that point know how God was
[2:01:19] going to do it but he knew God could
[2:01:21] raise him up because this is the word of
[2:01:25] God then as they get further they put
[2:01:28] all the sticks upon Isaac and they they
[2:01:29] going up and and Isaac goes Dad here is
[2:01:32] the wood and and there is the knife and
[2:01:35] he said where's the sacrifice and out of
[2:01:37] his mouth pops the Lord will provide for
[2:01:41] himself a
[2:01:43] lamb for a
[2:01:45] sacrifice you know what that was that
[2:01:48] was creative
[2:01:50] power that was Prof IC word I don't know
[2:01:53] that he saw in a vision I don't know
[2:01:55] that he knew we have no record that God
[2:01:56] told him but I don't know we don't know
[2:01:59] if he was saying something amen just to
[2:02:01] appease Isaac or we we have no idea
[2:02:04] there's no way in the scripture for us
[2:02:06] to know that he knew that God was going
[2:02:08] to provide a ram because we went through
[2:02:10] the motions of sacrificing Isaac he
[2:02:13] wasn't looking around for a ram he was
[2:02:15] standing up here putting the altar
[2:02:17] together putting the wood together tying
[2:02:19] his son's hands laying him on getting
[2:02:21] the night out of the sheath getting
[2:02:22] ready to plunge it into his heart
[2:02:24] brother Bram said he's not one Who's
[2:02:26] acting like he knows there's going to be
[2:02:27] a ram he's one Who's acting like he
[2:02:29] knows he has to sacrifice his son but he
[2:02:32] believes that God is more than able to
[2:02:33] raise him up and if he needs a lamb God
[2:02:35] will provide for himself a lamb even if
[2:02:37] this is the Lamb that he has to
[2:02:39] resurrect but God does exactly what pops
[2:02:42] out of his mouth that God provides a Ram
[2:02:44] with his horn stuck in the thicket I
[2:02:46] don't know that Abraham knew what he was
[2:02:47] saying but Abraham was God's mouthpiece
[2:02:50] on the earth and when Abraham said it
[2:02:51] God could do
[2:02:55] it God get out of my mind rhetoric and
[2:02:59] trash and fighting and striving and put
[2:03:01] the word and the word only in my mind
[2:03:03] let me be in the atmosphere of love and
[2:03:06] edification and word all the time until
[2:03:08] what pops out of my mouth is faith in
[2:03:10] the word faith in the word faith in the
[2:03:12] word not tear down edify not ridicule
[2:03:16] not criticism not Strife not any of
[2:03:18] these things but what pops out of my
[2:03:20] mouth when I see a brother going astray
[2:03:22] I say oh praise God God will bring him
[2:03:24] back cuz he's my
[2:03:26] brother not I always thought there was
[2:03:29] something funny I always had a funny
[2:03:30] feeling around
[2:03:34] him let's stay focused on the word until
[2:03:38] that comes out of our mouth is the word
[2:03:41] till what we speak is faith in the word
[2:03:43] till what we say in a moment's notice is
[2:03:45] something that come from the word
[2:03:47] something that come from faith in the
[2:03:48] word not something that comes from all
[2:03:50] the rhetoric that surrounding us not
[2:03:54] hate speech and negativism
[2:03:57] and we're immersed in it in this
[2:04:01] culture we're immersed in negative
[2:04:04] character dis tear downs and
[2:04:06] assassinations uh pulling people down
[2:04:09] exposing people's flaws and Falls well
[2:04:11] it absolutely this nation is riddled
[2:04:13] with that this
[2:04:16] culture let it not be part of
[2:04:19] us but let this mouth
[2:04:22] be used for the word of God and may it
[2:04:25] express faith in the word of God and out
[2:04:27] of the abundance of the heart the mouth
[2:04:31] speaketh so let me put in my heart word
[2:04:35] of God the message of the hour love and
[2:04:38] life and edification and peace and
[2:04:42] healing and restoration and bride Min
[2:04:45] let me just be so full of it that when I
[2:04:48] have to speak in a moment's notice that
[2:04:50] my mind doesn't even activate but my
[2:04:51] heart says God will do it God can God's
[2:04:53] more than
[2:04:58] able let our mouth have creative power
[2:05:02] it's creating anyways listen your words
[2:05:05] are creating
[2:05:07] anyways may they be used to create the
[2:05:09] atmosphere that comes from the word yes
[2:05:12] may we give God remember God is the high
[2:05:15] priest of our
[2:05:17] confession there ain't a thing he can do
[2:05:19] with a negative confession brother
[2:05:21] Brandon said when it's off the word and
[2:05:23] negative and and it comes from offense
[2:05:25] and it comes from uh uh bitterness he
[2:05:28] can't do a thing with those kind of
[2:05:30] confessions that come out of our mouth
[2:05:31] but when it comes from faith in the word
[2:05:33] when it comes from belief in him when
[2:05:35] it's the word that's spoken he's the
[2:05:36] high priest he can go to work on our
[2:05:38] confession and bring it to
[2:05:40] pass so let me use my mouth and the
[2:05:43] creative power that God's put in me May
[2:05:45] there be virtue in me for others may be
[2:05:47] their words of edification and healing
[2:05:49] and may it speak grace to the heal
[2:05:54] hearers God help
[2:05:56] me at the end of the sermon the only
[2:05:58] thing I can say is God help
[2:06:01] me I I've been
[2:06:03] wrong I I was probably wrong
[2:06:07] yesterday I may have been wrong this
[2:06:09] morning like we may not even realize how
[2:06:10] wrong we
[2:06:13] are I mean the S the things we say
[2:06:16] through clinched teeth and traffic may
[2:06:18] not be what a son of God's supposed to
[2:06:20] say right yes
[2:06:23] yeah you understand we may be more
[2:06:26] guilty than we
[2:06:27] realize I know I'm guilty I'm probably
[2:06:30] guiltier than I realize yes and I just
[2:06:33] want to say to you all I love you all
[2:06:34] and I'm sorry for ever sewing a negative
[2:06:37] seed in your mind about other churches
[2:06:39] other Ministries other ways of believing
[2:06:42] I'm
[2:06:42] sorry God knows my heart I am
[2:06:45] sorry I don't want this kind of
[2:06:48] atmosphere I don't want to promote it I
[2:06:51] don't want to add fuel I don't want to
[2:06:53] throw I don't want to throw one little
[2:06:54] twig in a
[2:06:55] bonfire let alone a giant
[2:06:59] log God help
[2:07:01] me to speak
[2:07:04] Grace
[2:07:06] edification healing peace virtue let it
[2:07:11] come out of my mouth let the atmosphere
[2:07:12] around me have creative power to create
[2:07:15] the atmosphere of Christ an atmosphere
[2:07:18] of love and may there be virtue that
[2:07:20] somebody can draw out of of my
[2:07:23] life being an amateur God might be
[2:07:25] harder than we
[2:07:28] thought we we want to stand on the bow
[2:07:31] of the
[2:07:33] ship and we want somebody to take a
[2:07:35] picture while we do
[2:07:36] it hurry get a video of
[2:07:40] this that's what we get in our minds
[2:07:42] when we say imate your Gods we think of
[2:07:44] power and we think of we think of
[2:07:45] prestige and the humans are so faulty
[2:07:48] this way we think of elevation and
[2:07:50] exaltation and that's right right but
[2:07:52] the Way Up Is
[2:07:54] Down first you got to go down before you
[2:07:57] got to go up you got to get down to
[2:07:59] humility you got to say God I'm nothing
[2:08:00] and I'll fail without you and I don't
[2:08:02] know what to do unless you tell me how
[2:08:03] to do
[2:08:05] it we get these visions of being bride
[2:08:08] of Jesus Christ and amateur gods and and
[2:08:11] and the the manifestation of the third
[2:08:14] pool I believe there's going to be a
[2:08:15] manifestation of the I do believe in an
[2:08:18] absolute outpouring at the final moments
[2:08:20] of time for God will prove this was her
[2:08:23] there's so many things brother Benham
[2:08:24] said but he's not going to put that
[2:08:27] power of spoken word into somebody who
[2:08:29] can't use their mouth right on the way
[2:08:30] to
[2:08:33] work so I want to become an amateur God
[2:08:36] now I want to be moved into that image I
[2:08:38] want to be corrected I want I want the
[2:08:40] the tutor I want the tutor to go back to
[2:08:42] God and says he's starting to get it
[2:08:44] father it's been a long time but I know
[2:08:46] he's made a lot of mistakes but I see a
[2:08:48] little bit of progress he did
[2:08:53] oh if the tutor could just say that
[2:08:55] about me I'd be so happy say I want to I
[2:08:57] want to know I'm growing I want to know
[2:08:59] I'm becoming more like him I want to
[2:09:00] know that I'm learning my lesson I want
[2:09:02] I want to be in His image on this Earth
[2:09:05] I want to be his representation on this
[2:09:07] Earth and to be his representation on
[2:09:09] this Earth it's going to take a whole
[2:09:10] lot more than a bunch of rhetoric and
[2:09:12] strong talk and verbal this and stomping
[2:09:14] around it's going to take a real life
[2:09:16] from your toes all the way to the top of
[2:09:18] your head from your soul all the way out
[2:09:20] it's going to take the reality of this
[2:09:22] word being flesh inside of
[2:09:25] us it's going to take death and death
[2:09:28] and more death and surrender and
[2:09:30] surrender and more surrender and it's
[2:09:32] going to take us having to look in the
[2:09:33] mirror and being honest with what we
[2:09:37] see no coverups no sweeping under rugs
[2:09:41] but just brutal honesty on God I'm
[2:09:44] failing you help
[2:09:45] me God I need your help now or I'll
[2:09:48] never make it
[2:09:51] of failure to begin
[2:09:54] with praise God brother BR says in the
[2:09:58] breach so now he has the title deed the
[2:10:01] Redemption he has it in his hand
[2:10:03] mediation is done now he has it in his
[2:10:05] hand remember it's been in the hand of
[2:10:07] God all the time but now it's in the
[2:10:09] hand of the lamb now watch the title
[2:10:12] deed of redemption of all creation is in
[2:10:14] his hand and he's coming to claim it
[2:10:16] back for the human race not claim it
[2:10:19] back for Angels claim it back to human
[2:10:21] which it was give to to make Sons and
[2:10:23] Daughters of God again bring them back
[2:10:27] to the Garden of Eden everything they
[2:10:29] lost the whole creation the trees the
[2:10:31] animal life everything else oh my don't
[2:10:33] that make you feel good yeah it makes me
[2:10:36] feel good cuz if he didn't take that
[2:10:38] title deed I'm hopeless if he didn't
[2:10:39] bring it back to man I'm hopeless but
[2:10:41] he's bringing it back he's the one who's
[2:10:43] working it amen at the opening of the
[2:10:45] word amen that that Holy Ghost was
[2:10:47] released in full measure to come and
[2:10:49] live the life of this word amen so now
[2:10:51] everything we're talking about is
[2:10:53] possible in the day we live it's
[2:10:55] possible how is it possible not by might
[2:10:59] nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the
[2:11:03] Lord oh if I could just get myself out
[2:11:06] of the way and he can come in and fill
[2:11:09] me he's taking the title deed back do
[2:11:12] you believe he's taking the title deed
[2:11:13] back do you believe he's brought it back
[2:11:15] to claim back for for who he didn't
[2:11:18] claim it back for himself he claimed it
[2:11:20] back for human beings
[2:11:22] what does that mean that means he's
[2:11:24] brought back my right to go back to
[2:11:28] being a Son of
[2:11:30] God before hybridization I'm going back
[2:11:33] to that place before corruption set
[2:11:38] in amen let's all Stand Together
[2:11:41] musicians if you'll please

[2:11:50] this as the music musicians

[2:11:56] church he is among his church today made
[2:11:59] flesh in his church certainly Elohim now

[2:12:09] God and you have a do domain Genesis
[2:12:12] 1:26 he give him dominion over
[2:12:14] everything in the earth he made him a
[2:12:16] God over the Earth that's right he gave
[2:12:18] him a Dominion he's a king God and where
[2:12:20] he got his fall he could speak to the
[2:12:23] trees be changed be plucked up said over
[2:12:25] here to the winds waves be still and it
[2:12:27] stop he was God an amateur God a Son of
[2:12:30] God like you're a son of your father and
[2:12:33] all the world is groaning waiting for
[2:12:35] the manifestation of the sons of God
[2:12:37] waiting for the church to get back in
[2:12:39] its place again sons of God to be made
[2:12:42] manifest waiting for that
[2:12:44] hour I hope that don't hurt but I just
[2:12:46] had to say it see the church is so far
[2:12:49] away from its place it needs to be back
[2:12:51] to be sons of God again rulers governors
[2:12:54] of the earth under the spiritual Reign
[2:12:56] it will be someday when the chief one
[2:12:58] comes Jesus Christ the great Millennium
[2:13:01] Nature's groaning for that
[2:13:03] day have you seen the
[2:13:05] weather you seen earthquakes have you
[2:13:07] seen fires have you seen hurricanes have
[2:13:10] you seen chaos break out all over the
[2:13:12] Earth what is it the Earth is groaning
[2:13:14] what's the Earth groaning for it's
[2:13:15] groaning for you and I to come back in
[2:13:18] position this word came to bring us back
[2:13:21] back into position his spirit's here to
[2:13:22] make it happen what does he need he
[2:13:24] needs
[2:13:25] us to create that
[2:13:28] atmosphere to surrender to
[2:13:31] yield you know sometimes the greatest
[2:13:34] battle is recognizing we're
[2:13:37] wrong
[2:13:39] brother sometimes what keeps us stuck in
[2:13:41] a rut for so long is we're blinded to
[2:13:44] our own failure we don't even recognize
[2:13:46] how wrong we
[2:13:47] are we keep trucking down the road
[2:13:50] thinking everything fine everything's
[2:13:52] right we're doing okay and we don't
[2:13:54] realize that that what we're doing is
[2:13:58] wrong contrary to the word hindering our
[2:14:00] lives and hurting the ones around
[2:14:03] us sometimes the most loving thing God
[2:14:05] has ever done for us is is took the veil
[2:14:10] off and said this is where you're
[2:14:13] wrong and oh how devastating it is I
[2:14:17] don't know if it's for you but it's for
[2:14:18] me to realize I've been so wrong
[2:14:21] I've been so wrong I've been so
[2:14:23] self-serving I've been so proud I've
[2:14:25] been so I've been so
[2:14:27] wrong but all the grace of God that can
[2:14:31] come along and give us an opportunity to
[2:14:33] say father forgive me for I have sinned
[2:14:37] forgive me for the atmosphere that's
[2:14:39] around me forgive me for the creation I
[2:14:42] created this atmosphere I'm in the
[2:14:44] middle of contention all the time I'm in
[2:14:46] the middle of strife it seems like I'm
[2:14:48] always in in some sort of TS with
[2:14:50] somebody amen and then we blame the we
[2:14:52] blame the somebody I'm always in the
[2:14:54] middle of a fix I'm always in the middle
[2:14:56] of a disaster I'm always in the middle
[2:14:58] of of some uproar and then and then
[2:15:00] you're like everybody around me are just
[2:15:04] nuts there might be a common
[2:15:10] denominator maybe you need to realize I
[2:15:13] created this atmosphere and I'm
[2:15:15] attracting this by my
[2:15:19] atmosphere if I wanted to change maybe
[2:15:22] if I change my
[2:15:23] atmosphere things around maybe I have
[2:15:26] the power to create the reality that I
[2:15:29] live
[2:15:30] in by changing my attitude my perception
[2:15:34] by lining up to the word by surrendering
[2:15:35] and repenting and allowing the spirit of
[2:15:37] God more room to work in my life maybe
[2:15:39] it'll change the atmosphere around me
[2:15:41] and the change in atmosphere might
[2:15:42] change everything I've been battling
[2:15:44] with for
[2:15:45] years might be the atmosphere that I
[2:15:48] created
[2:15:51] God help us all I can say is I need the
[2:15:55] iav I need the eyes saav to see so that
[2:15:58] I can repen and have God come and I want
[2:16:02] to be a Son of God you know what I want
[2:16:05] to do more anything I don't want to be
[2:16:07] the one who stands on the bow of the
[2:16:08] boat and has his picture taken and I
[2:16:10] don't want to be the one whose name is
[2:16:11] in the paper and I mean all that's fine
[2:16:13] and if God allows all that we'll Rejoice
[2:16:15] at the glory god gets but you know what
[2:16:17] I want to be I want to be the one that
[2:16:19] at the end of the day he says I'm happy
[2:16:21] with you son I'm pleased with what
[2:16:23] you've done whether there's a picture
[2:16:25] taken or anybody knows or there's a
[2:16:27] testimony that goes around the world or
[2:16:28] not it doesn't matter what I want more
[2:16:31] than anything is to please my father and
[2:16:33] I want to be a son that pleases my
[2:16:35] father that's the one that comes to
[2:16:37] adoption is the one that pleases the
[2:16:38] father and does it his way it's not the
[2:16:41] son who always got his own idea and
[2:16:43] often not listening to the tutor and
[2:16:44] improve and everything that's not the
[2:16:46] one that comes to adoption the one that
[2:16:47] comes to adoption under the tutelage of
[2:16:50] the Holy Ghost comes into the very image
[2:16:52] of his father so that his father can
[2:16:53] entrust him with more power that's who's
[2:16:56] coming to adoption that's what I want at
[2:16:58] the end of the day I want to move closer
[2:17:00] and closer to his likeness every day and
[2:17:02] be pleasing to
[2:17:04] him it's the greatest desire of my heart
[2:17:07] is to please my
[2:17:09] father amen and where did that desire
