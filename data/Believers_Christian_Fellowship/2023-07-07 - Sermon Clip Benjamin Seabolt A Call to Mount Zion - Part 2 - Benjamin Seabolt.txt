TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you'll only get this character by the word and your mind molds your character this is why Satan is the is so polluting the entertainment dimension and he is so taken over and afflicting the people with screens everywhere I can't even pump gas without there being a scream there everywhere you go there is a screen why because Satan knows what God's tactics are he knows how God he knows the plan of God brother Brandon said this he openly declares this not all of it he said there was one portion he didn't know and it's a good thing he didn't know that but he knows how God works and he knows that God is going to use the Mind remember the Battleground was the mind he knows God is going to come through the mind to mold the portion with his word to mold the character of the people so how is he going to mold the character of his people and how is he going to uh delay the people of God coming to their appropriate position he has got to get into a spiritual position and infiltrate and afflict them in their mind to bother their character coming to full fruition so how does he do that he enters that dimension whatever the dimension that is I don't know I always get them wrong so I'm not even going to say anything whatever Dimension that is to where there's screens everywhere and he has to constantly constantly have an image before the people to make them be thinking about something to be seeing something to be entertained by something and again I'm not even saying it's all bad or all what we would say sinful or dirty or smutty it's just I've got to tie up the cogs of their mind because what if by perchance they would start wondering about their Eternal destination and wondering where they come from and wondering about where they stand before their creator don't let them think those kind of thoughts let them think anything else don't let them think those kind of thoughts praise the Lord your mind makes your character this is why young people you have to guard against these things and we can sit here and I can go down the list if you want me to of what what they all are but it doesn't matter I'm not here to preach against social media and name them all I don't even know half of them but it's out there it's there and if one's not going to catch your attention he'll get another one I mean I don't even know how many social media platforms there are right now why isn't one good enough I mean how many social media lives do you have to have it's not about how many you have to have it's about keeping your mind tied up
