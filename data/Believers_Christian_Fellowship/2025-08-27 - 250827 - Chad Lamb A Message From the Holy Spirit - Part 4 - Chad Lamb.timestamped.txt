[9:01] to thee one more time.
[9:07] All that I have,
[9:12] all that I am,
[9:17] all
[9:19] I shall never
[9:22] be.
[9:27] It cannot
[9:30] repay
[9:32] the love debt I own.
[9:37] I
[9:39] surrender
[9:42] to thee.
[9:46] You stand with me this evening.
[9:49] We worship you
[9:54] in spirit
[9:57] and in truth.
[10:03] We
[10:05] worship
[10:07] you
[10:08] in spirit
[10:10] and in truth.
[10:17] We have heard your word and felt your
[10:24] presence
[10:26] too.
[10:30] We worship you dear Lord in spirit
[10:38] in truth.
[10:41] [Music]
[10:44] We worship
[10:46] you
[10:49] in spirit
[10:51] and in truth.
[10:57] We
[10:59] worship
[11:01] you in spirit
[11:04] and in truth.
[11:11] We have heard your word and felt your
[11:17] presence
[11:19] too.
[11:24] We worship you dear Lord in spirit
[11:32] in truth.
[11:35] As brother Chad comes, let's sing. Turn
[11:37] your eyes. Turn
[11:40] your eyes
[11:42] upon Jesus.
[11:48] Look full
[11:51] in his wonderful
[11:54] face.
[11:59] And the things
[12:02] of earth
[12:04] will grow strangely
[12:07] dim
[12:09] in the light
[12:12] of his glory
[12:15] and grace.
[12:20] Turn
[12:23] your eyes
[12:24] upon Jesus.
[12:30] Look for
[12:32] in his wonderful
[12:36] face.
[12:40] And the things
[12:43] of earth
[12:45] will grow strange
[12:50] in the light
[12:53] of his glory
[12:56] and grace.
[13:00] Amen. God bless you all. So good to see
[13:02] you all this evening. Let's bow our
[13:04] heads together and pray while we're
[13:06] standing.
[13:07] Dear heavenly father, we're so thankful
[13:10] Lord Jesus for the privilege of being
[13:12] here once again for God that you have
[13:15] gathered us together Lord to speak to us
[13:17] your words of life. God may we have a
[13:20] receptive heart Lord to receive what you
[13:23] have for us tonight. Lord we can
[13:25] consider it a great privilege to be here
[13:27] Lord with the saints. We just pray God
[13:30] you would help us all to relax ourselves
[13:32] into your hand and that we we can become
[13:34] pliable in your hand as you begin to
[13:36] mold us by your word and begin to shape
[13:38] us Lord. May we come into your image
[13:40] more and more day by day word by word
[13:43] Lord. May become more of a living
[13:45] reality in our lives Lord. And may it be
[13:48] your reflection in us as you work on us
[13:50] by your word. May we receive a portion
[13:52] of that tonight. May you take this
[13:54] vessel under your control. May you
[13:56] speak, God, through these lips, Lord,
[13:58] things that are pertinent to us, Lord,
[14:00] that would remind us, Lord, of what
[14:02] you're doing in our hour, Lord, that
[14:04] would give us a clearer vision and a
[14:06] greater understanding. And Lord, that
[14:08] you might have your way in each one of
[14:10] us. We pray. We ask it in Jesus Christ's
[14:13] name. Bless the word as it goes forth,
[14:16] Lord, and bless our ears to hear and our
[14:18] hearts to receive. In Jesus Christ's
[14:20] name we pray. Amen. Man, we're going to
[14:23] let you have your seats for just a
[14:25] moment. I just want to say hello. Amen.
[14:28] It's good to be back home and we had a
[14:30] wonderful time. Our family did and we
[14:32] certainly appreciate your prayers and
[14:34] the Lord certainly blessed us and uh
[14:37] thank you musicians. God bless you. You
[14:38] guys can go to your seats. We uh we were
[14:43] uh you know gone there for 10 days and
[14:46] so we certainly appreciate the brothers
[14:48] who ministered while we were gone,
[14:49] brother Gabe and brother Chris T. and we
[14:51] heard some good things about the
[14:52] services and I'm still trying to get
[14:54] caught up so I haven't got completely
[14:56] caught up but uh it it's good to be
[14:59] home. Amen. And we come back refreshed
[15:01] and recharged and and ready to serve the
[15:04] Lord. Amen.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exciting. Uh I just want to
[15:09] greet a visitor. We've got brother uh
[15:10] David Yonosi Yanosi Yanosi. Is that
[15:15] right? Brother David from Hungary back
[15:17] here with the young men. Uh, brother
[15:19] David's father, brother Jury, is a very
[15:21] good friend of mine from Hungary. He's a
[15:23] pastor there, a wonderful brother. And
[15:25] uh, the the three young brothers that
[15:27] went with me to Poland met brother David
[15:29] in the camp in Poland. They struck up a
[15:30] friendship. I think the seeds of this
[15:33] trip were sewn there. And now this is
[15:34] the fruition of it. So, God bless you.
[15:36] It's good to have you. He'll be with us
[15:38] till next Wednesday. So, it's good to
[15:40] have him here. Uh, uh, while we were
[15:43] gone, Brother Dave and Sister Bessie
[15:44] Wood were also on their trip to Glacier
[15:46] National Park. I see they made it safely
[15:48] home. So, I can't wait to get with them
[15:49] and see how their trip was. Amen. So, we
[15:52] can compare notes. Amen. While we were
[15:55] gone, also we had the Wednesday service
[15:57] cancelled because they were installing
[15:58] the new projection system and uh I've
[16:01] heard good things about it. I got in
[16:02] here yesterday to play around on it and
[16:05] uh um it's a lot clearer. Our old system
[16:07] was over 20 years old and it was
[16:09] beginning to fade and it was on its last
[16:10] leg. So, we really appreciate the
[16:13] trustees for making that happen and
[16:15] brother Franco for managing the project
[16:16] and and uh for just uh helping us always
[16:20] helping us improve and upgrade. And when
[16:22] I was here yesterday watching it all,
[16:24] it's not just the projectors. There's
[16:25] some new technology on the platform that
[16:28] makes it a lot easier for whoever's
[16:29] here. And uh it's clearer back here for
[16:32] those who are on the platform looking
[16:33] back are that rear projector hadn't been
[16:35] working for months. And and so there's
[16:38] just a lot. But when I was thinking
[16:40] about what God has given us, the
[16:42] facility and the equipment and the
[16:43] tools, I said, God, help us to be
[16:45] faithful to use it for your glory.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; Help us to proclaim this word with
[16:50] boldness and keep it pure and keep it
[16:52] true and never stop declaring it loud
[16:55] and clear with our full heart because
[16:57] there's no excuse for us not to. God's
[16:59] given us every tool, every comfort,
[17:02] every all the facilities, everything we
[17:04] need. And what we need to do is give our
[17:05] whole heart to proclaiming the truth.
[17:08] And so we're just so thankful for what
[17:09] God has given us. And then I wanted to
[17:12] show you a couple pictures of the trip.
[17:13] Brother Frank, if you want to bring that
[17:14] up just cuz I want to show off the new
[17:16] projectors and see how bright they are.
[17:18] So we were able to go to uh Yellowstone
[17:20] National Park and Grand Teton National
[17:22] Park and it was beautiful. So we were
[17:25] outside most of the day for 10 days and
[17:27] that's what we like. And that was fun.
[17:29] The weather was beautiful and we had a
[17:31] good time. And we went hiking almost
[17:33] every day to get away from the crowds
[17:35] and back in. And when you see when you
[17:38] see God's creation and we know it's
[17:41] perverted, but this is, you know, the
[17:43] most untouched that we can get here in
[17:45] America, when you see that, you just
[17:47] start to have a longing for the
[17:48] millennium. I just can't wait to see
[17:50] what it'll be when it's restored. While
[17:52] we were in Grand Tetons, we found this
[17:54] little chapel. This is a little 100
[17:55] years old. It's the chapel of the
[17:58] transfiguration. It's an Episcopalian
[18:00] church. It's been there for over a
[18:01] hundred years. The National Park Service
[18:03] keeps it going. And it's nice because
[18:05] they keep it a church and they keep it
[18:07] it's it has visitors but they keep it
[18:09] quiet and you just go in there for
[18:10] prayer. When you went in everybody was
[18:11] sitting quietly and it was really neat.
[18:14] So I I enjoyed this. Uh but when you sit
[18:17] in your seats behind where the pull pit
[18:19] would be there's a pane of glass and
[18:22] this is the view from inside. And yeah,
[18:26] nobody would be paying attention to a
[18:27] sermon if we had a view like that. And
[18:29] our church would be looking at the
[18:31] mountains. But I we just sat there quiet
[18:33] and I looked out there and I thought how
[18:35] magnificent is because mountains play
[18:37] such an important part in the scriptures
[18:39] and and I I had this uh uh scripture I
[18:42] wanted to read to you out of Psalms 125
[18:46] says they that trust in the Lord shall
[18:48] be as mount Zion which cannot be removed
[18:50] but abideth forever. As the mountains
[18:53] are round about Jerusalem so the Lord is
[18:56] round about his people from henceforth
[18:58] even forever. Man, it feels good to be
[19:01] hemmed in by the by God. Amen. By the
[19:03] mountain of God. Amen. So, it was it was
[19:06] wonderful. We had a good time and we're
[19:08] glad to be home. Amen. And ready to get
[19:10] to work. Amen. Let's all stand together.
[19:13] We're going to turn to the book of
[19:14] Genesis. We're going to continue on with
[19:17] what we've been in our little booklet
[19:19] here, uh, Message from the Holy Spirit,
[19:21] part four. I hope you have your little
[19:23] booklets. If not, the deacons have some
[19:25] at the back doors and there's some out
[19:27] in the foyer as well. So, we're going to
[19:29] go through that again. I have been very
[19:32] much enjoying this little study. And uh
[19:35] it's it keeps expanding. It keeps
[19:38] blowing up. And I keep enjoying it more
[19:39] and more and more. And and in fact, it's
[19:42] going over and reviewing some things.
[19:44] Some of it's review for some of us
[19:46] who've been around for a while. But the
[19:48] review is always so refreshing. I don't
[19:50] know how it is. You go to review
[19:51] something, you know, and you find things
[19:53] you didn't know. Amen. And and it just
[19:55] it can grow. It's the word of God. It's
[19:57] eternal. and it keeps growing. And so
[19:59] I've been enjoying it. I hope hope you
[20:01] are as well. I've been looking forward
[20:03] to getting back and continuing on. Amen.
[20:05] Uh let's turn to Genesis chapter 1. This
[20:08] is the scripture we've been opening with
[20:10] for the last four parts. It's the
[20:13] scripture that brother Brandham opened
[20:14] with when he preached spoken word is the
[20:18] original seed, which is when he first
[20:20] mentions this time that the Holy Spirit
[20:22] told him to pick up his pen and write.
[20:24] And and we're just going to shorten it.
[20:26] Now, he read a large portion, but we're
[20:28] going to pick it up in verse 11. Chapter
[20:30] 1 11. And God said, "Let the earth bring
[20:33] forth grass and the herb yielding seed,
[20:35] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[20:38] its kind, whose seed is in itself upon
[20:40] the earth." And it was so. And the earth
[20:43] brought forth grass and herb yielding
[20:45] seed after his kind, and the tree
[20:46] yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself
[20:49] after his kind. And God saw that it was
[20:51] good. And the evening and the morning
[20:53] were the third day. Amen. And God bless
[20:55] you as you have your seats. Amen.
[21:00] When I saw that little log church that's
[21:02] been there over a hundred years and I
[21:04] thought, what sermons were preached in
[21:05] there 100 years ago? And you know what
[21:10] truths were proclaimed because they were
[21:11] preaching from the Bible? Truth was
[21:13] being proclaimed. But you think about
[21:15] what God has done in Revelation in the
[21:18] last hundred years. what God has
[21:20] revealed about himself and what God has
[21:22] revealed about his people and and what
[21:24] God has revealed about his word. And I
[21:25] say, "Oh, thank God. We're the most
[21:28] blessed people. I I I just can't imagine
[21:30] being any more blessed than we are to be
[21:33] fed on such a rich diet of the word of
[21:35] God. We have no excuse not to overcome.
[21:38] We have no excuse not to be happy. We
[21:40] have no excuse. There's no excuse. All
[21:42] the times are hard. Absolutely. Leodysia
[21:44] is dark and this is Satan's Eden. But
[21:46] we've been given a word to overcome all
[21:48] of that. Amen. The level of the word is
[21:50] the highest it's ever been to overcome
[21:52] the darkest of the darkest. We're not
[21:54] here be to be consumed by the dark.
[21:56] We're here to be the light that pushes
[21:58] back the dark.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; We're here to be overcomers and God's
[22:01] given us everything we need to overcome
[22:02] with. And I'm so thankful. I'm so
[22:05] thankful to be alive in this time, in
[22:07] this age, and to have this word. Amen.
[22:09] We may live in Leodysia. We may live in
[22:12] the seat of Satan's Eden. We may have
[22:15] all of these stresses and pressures and
[22:17] all of these things. It's nice to go out
[22:19] and go for a hike and get away from it
[22:20] all. But listen, I'd rather have the
[22:23] word than have quiet on a hillside.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; I'd rather have this word of God and
[22:28] live in the middle of Satan's Eden than
[22:30] not know this word.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd rather have inward peace and
[22:35] spiritual peace than have physical
[22:37] peace.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; We're blessed. We're so blessed. And so
[22:41] I just think there's no excuse for us.
[22:43] And I don't want there to be an excuse.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; I want to overcome by the grace of God.
[22:48] I want him to be the overcomer in me. I
[22:50] want the word that he's planted in my
[22:51] heart to overcome and conquer every
[22:53] situation that's around us. And I thank
[22:56] God for it. Amen. We're going to go uh
[23:00] and hit just a couple of these uh quotes
[23:02] that brother Brandham had mentioned to
[23:04] us. Uh and spoken word was the original
[23:07] seed. Now remember, every spoken word of
[23:09] God is the original seed. God planted
[23:12] everything in the earth by his word. And
[23:13] as long as you stay with the original
[23:15] seed, it will breed itself right back
[23:17] and reproduce itself again. Hybrid, it
[23:20] dies. This is God's intention. This God
[23:23] brought his word. And his word has to
[23:25] reproduce itself. And in the beginning,
[23:27] God's word was going to bring forth a
[23:30] world full of sons and daughters. And
[23:32] God, amen, was going to materialize
[23:34] himself upon the earth as a family of
[23:36] God in fellowship with one another. And
[23:38] that was hindered by a perversion. But
[23:40] if you ever come back to the original
[23:42] word, it'll reproduce that again. And
[23:44] that's what God is doing by the
[23:46] restoration of the word. He's brought us
[23:47] back into the mystery that was in his
[23:49] mind. Amen. The original word, the
[23:51] original thought brings us to the
[23:53] original understanding to fulfill God's
[23:55] original purpose. And what is he trying
[23:57] to do? He's trying to get a people in
[24:00] his hand that he can have preeminence
[24:02] again. That he can manifest the word in
[24:04] those people so that he could bring back
[24:06] a fallen Eden.
[24:09] Oh, so thank God to be part of that.
[24:12] Amen. And so we've brought back the
[24:14] original word with the original thought.
[24:18] This is where brother Benham's dilemma
[24:20] was in this message because he realized
[24:22] now that this transition time had come
[24:24] that God was no longer going to work
[24:25] through the church systems through the
[24:27] denominations that it was finished. The
[24:29] seeds were sewn. Amen. And there had to
[24:31] come a a change. And he didn't know what
[24:34] to do. And he says, "I got a place here
[24:36] where I got so in the spirit. I got the
[24:40] church up to show it and prove it in the
[24:41] word here exactly what's happened all
[24:43] along." And and then when I did, I
[24:46] thought, "Lord, I got the people
[24:47] standing here now. I'll have them
[24:49] standing there. What can I tell them? I
[24:52] can't predict a future. I can't tell
[24:54] them what to do. What will I do? I'll
[24:56] leave them standing on a limb." I raised
[24:58] up my hand. I said, "God, I think I'm
[25:00] doing this by your will. I've never did
[25:03] this. never did before cuz the seed
[25:05] hadn't been sewn yet. I said, "Now I I
[25:07] believe it's time for me to say it. But
[25:09] now, what am I going to say now?" And
[25:13] just as plain as you hear my voice,
[25:15] something said, "Pick up your pen. I'll
[25:17] read it to you in a minute." And when I
[25:19] got through, there it was, just the
[25:21] answer. I didn't even know what I was
[25:22] writing. Just started writing. And when
[25:24] I got through, I laid the pen down. I
[25:26] looked. I thought, "God have mercy.
[25:28] There it is right there. That's what I'm
[25:30] looking for." And that's this little
[25:32] booklet we hold in his hand. That's our
[25:34] hands. This is what God had given to him
[25:36] to give to the church. Amen. And it has
[25:39] to do with the word in the church. So
[25:40] let's open up our booklets to the first
[25:42] page. And I'm just going to read the
[25:44] first paragraph under where it says
[25:46] Pergam and church age.
[25:48] Said, "One night as I was seeking the
[25:50] Lord, the Holy Spirit told me to pick up
[25:52] my pen and write. As I grasped the pen
[25:54] to write, his spirit gave me a message
[25:56] for the church. I want to bring it to
[25:59] you. It has to do with the word and the
[26:01] bride. So this message that the Holy
[26:05] Spirit wrote through the prophet gave to
[26:07] him wasn't for the prophet. Although he
[26:09] had a question, he didn't know what to
[26:10] do. This is for the church.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; So this is for me.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; So that I would understand the
[26:16] transition that had come and what God
[26:19] was working out, what he was trying to
[26:20] do. Let's jump from there over to page
[26:24] four.
[26:26] And I'm going to reread just a couple uh
[26:28] two paragraphs that we had finished with
[26:30] and then we'll move on. If you go to the
[26:33] middle of page four where it says
[26:35] paragraph 173-1,
[26:37] I'm going to pick it up right there and
[26:39] move on.
[26:42] Says, take the example we see in Moses.
[26:44] This mighty anointed prophet of God had
[26:46] a peculiar birth, being born at the
[26:49] right time for the deliverance of
[26:50] Abraham's seed from Egypt. Do you know
[26:52] the prophet of God in our day had a
[26:53] peculiar birth? There was a a light and
[26:56] a dove that w that appeared at his
[26:59] birth. But he was being born at the
[27:01] right time for the deliverance of
[27:02] Abraham's seed from Egypt. Amen. So
[27:04] Moses came at the right time. Amen. Our
[27:07] prophet in our age came at the right
[27:09] time. He never stayed in Egypt to argue
[27:12] scripture with them nor fuss at the
[27:14] priest. He went to the wilderness until
[27:16] the people were ready to receive him.
[27:18] God called Moses to the wilderness. The
[27:21] waiting was not on Moses's part, but
[27:22] because of the people who were not ready
[27:24] to receive him. Moses thought the people
[27:26] would understand, but they did not.
[27:30] Then there is Elijah, to whom the word
[27:31] of the Lord came. When he got through
[27:34] preaching the truth, and that group back
[27:36] there, that is the forerunner of the
[27:37] American Jezebel group, would not
[27:40] receive the word. I want you to pay
[27:42] close attention to that sentence. So
[27:44] when he got through preaching the truth
[27:47] uh and that group back there that is the
[27:50] forerunner of the American Jezebel group
[27:53] would not receive the word. So brother
[27:54] Brennham's drawing a parallel between
[27:56] Elijah's day and his day the current
[27:59] time this American Jezebel group. He
[28:02] said God called him off the field and
[28:04] plagued that generation for rejecting
[28:06] the prophet and the message that God had
[28:08] given. God called him to the wilderness
[28:11] and he could not come out even for the
[28:13] king. Those who tried to persuade him to
[28:15] do so died. But God spoke to his
[28:18] faithful prophet by vision. And out of
[28:20] hiding he came and brought back the word
[28:22] to Israel. That was the Mount Carmel
[28:24] showdown. He came out of hiding. Amen.
[28:26] He came back at the end of the dry
[28:28] period, the drought. Amen. A a drought
[28:30] of hearing the word of God and he came
[28:32] back for the Mount Carmel showdown. And
[28:34] we talked about that extensively last
[28:36] time. Then the next example he goes to,
[28:39] he says, "Then came John the Baptist,
[28:41] Christ's faithful forerunner, the mighty
[28:44] prophet for his day. He did not go to
[28:46] his father's school nor the school of
[28:47] Pharisees. He went he went to no
[28:50] denomination but out to the wilderness
[28:52] called there by God. There he stayed
[28:55] until the Lord sent him out with the
[28:57] message crying, "The Messiah is at
[28:59] hand." So, Brother Brandham uses these
[29:01] three examples to type his own ministry
[29:03] in the hour that he's come to. Amen. And
[29:06] so he had to wait for the time. And
[29:08] brother, that's where brother Brennham
[29:10] was at this at this stage of his
[29:12] ministry at this part of time in 1962.
[29:15] He was waiting for something. He was
[29:17] waiting for the next thing to transpire.
[29:19] Something had happened and he's waiting
[29:20] for something to happen. And he's here
[29:22] just waiting. And uh Moses had to wait.
[29:25] Elijah had to wait and John the Baptist
[29:28] had to wait. But when they all wait,
[29:29] they came out with a message of
[29:31] deliverance. When the waiting was over,
[29:33] now was the time. God is going to
[29:35] perform the promise. It's time to be
[29:37] delivered. The promise of Abraham's
[29:39] coming to be fulfilled. The restoration
[29:41] back to the original faith and truth was
[29:43] coming in Mount Carmel. Amen. And now
[29:45] the Messiah is at hand and John the
[29:48] Baptist. And these things were all
[29:49] fulfilled in Brother Benham's ministry.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; So exciting to me.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Now, let's continue on. This is all new
[29:58] territory now. Now let us take a
[30:00] scriptural warning here. Was it not in
[30:03] the days of Moses when God had vi God
[30:05] had vindicated that Kora rose up and
[30:08] withtood that mighty prophet? He
[30:10] disputed with Moses and claimed that he
[30:12] had as much from God to lead the people
[30:14] and that others shared in the divine
[30:16] revelation as well as did Moses. He
[30:18] denied the authority of Moses. Now the
[30:21] people back there after they had heard
[30:23] the true word and were well acquainted
[30:25] with the fact that a true prophet was
[30:26] vindicated of God. I say those people
[30:29] fell for the for Kora and his gain
[30:31] sayings. Kora was not a scriptural
[30:34] prophet, but the people in great numbers
[30:36] with their leaders went for him. But Ram
[30:38] is now giving a warning. He's saying
[30:40] there's other gifted men. There's other
[30:42] gifts rising up, but there's only one
[30:44] vindicated prophet. And he says just
[30:46] like what happened to Moses is going to
[30:48] happen again. There's going to be Kora
[30:50] Ministries who's going to withstand the
[30:52] truth. But then Kora was not a
[30:53] vindicated prophet. Amen. Let's let's
[30:56] turn together to numbers 16 and let's
[30:59] read just a little bit about Kora.
[31:07] Numbers 16
[31:10] and 1
[31:21] uh number 16 and1. Now Kora the son of
[31:24] Isizar the son of Kohath the son of Levi
[31:28] and Dayathan and Abram the sons of Ilab
[31:31] and on the son of Pelth the sons of
[31:33] Reuben took men and they rose up before
[31:36] Moses with certain of the children of
[31:37] Israel 250 princes of the assembly
[31:40] famous in the congregation men of renown
[31:43] and they gathered themselves together
[31:44] against Moses and against Aaron and said
[31:47] unto them Ye too much upon you seeing
[31:50] all the congregation are holy every one
[31:52] one of them that the Lord is among them.
[31:54] Wherefore then lift ye up yourselves
[31:56] among the congregation of the Lord. And
[31:58] so now Kora and Dayan and Abram and
[32:01] these other ones, they get 250 princes
[32:03] to rise up and say, "Listen, you take
[32:05] too much upon yourself, Moses." And
[32:07] Moses had appointed his brother Aaron to
[32:09] be the high priest. And they didn't like
[32:11] this setup. They didn't like Moses's
[32:13] authority. And what Brother Brandham
[32:14] says, he said he denied the authority of
[32:17] Moses. Amen. But praise God, what God is
[32:20] showing in this is God is bringing back
[32:23] an authority like unto Moses, an
[32:25] authority on the word that has thus
[32:27] sayaeth the Lord from the mouth of God
[32:29] and can bring the perfect interpretation
[32:30] of the word with divine vindication. And
[32:33] that's the authority, friends.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how gifted a preacher
[32:37] is. It doesn't matter how many things
[32:38] that he can do. Amen. There's been one
[32:41] voice in this generation. There's been
[32:43] one prophet, amen, to restore the word
[32:45] in this generation. And that's the
[32:47] authority with the word. And we're not
[32:49] here to tamper with it. We're not here
[32:51] to compete with it. We're not here to
[32:52] correct him. Amen. We are just here to
[32:55] get under that that authority that God
[32:57] sent that voice of God to this age.
[32:59] Amen.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; But the the Kora work, Amen, was a
[33:03] gains. And and if we look here at this
[33:06] gains,
[33:07] Amen. Uh in Jude 1:11 speaking of Kora
[33:12] it says woe unto them for they have gone
[33:14] in the way of Cain and ran greedily
[33:16] after the heir of Balum for reward and
[33:19] perished in the gains of Kore. This word
[33:21] Korea is the same as Kora in the Old
[33:23] Testament. And the word gains here if we
[33:27] look at this I'm going to show you
[33:29] something that's fun. Now we got new
[33:31] tools.
[33:33] This word gains
[33:36] is contradiction.
[33:38] or opposition.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; What was Kora doing? He was just
[33:43] contradicting Moses.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Say, Moses, no. No, you you we we're
[33:48] holy, too.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; The whole C congregation is holy. I I
[33:52] can hear from the Lord, too. I can get
[33:54] revelation, too. I I can understand the
[33:56] word, too. Amen. And that may all be
[33:59] true, but praise God. But you better not
[34:01] contradict the voice of God for this
[34:03] sake. You can get revelation from the
[34:05] Holy Ghost. Absolutely. You can catch
[34:07] inspiration because Amen. Amen. He wants
[34:09] a kingdom of priests and kings. He wants
[34:12] us all to be priests. He wants us all to
[34:14] receive from the Holy Ghost. But that
[34:15] receiving from the Holy Ghost better
[34:17] never be gains. Amen. And never be
[34:20] contradicting or opposition to the voice
[34:23] that God sent in this day.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was the error of Kora in that
[34:29] day. He was contradicting. He was
[34:31] opposing. Amen. And if we go over uh to
[34:35] to uh verse 8, number 16:8
[34:40] says, "And Moses said unto Kora, here I
[34:44] pray you, you sons of Levi, seemth it
[34:47] but a small thing unto you, that the God
[34:49] of Israel has separated you from the
[34:51] congregation of Israel, to bring you
[34:53] near to himself, to do the service of
[34:55] the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand
[34:57] before the congregation, to minister
[34:59] unto them. and he hath brought thee near
[35:02] to him, and all thy brethren, thy sons
[35:04] of Levi, with thee, and seek ye the
[35:06] priesthood also."
[35:08] He says, "What's wrong with you?"
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Was it was your position not good
[35:13] enough? Amen. Was it not good enough
[35:15] that you were a minister to the people?
[35:17] You were going to minister of the
[35:18] tabernacle, that you're part of the
[35:20] tribe of Levi, and you're positionally
[35:21] placed. Why is it that you have to do
[35:24] this and you have to seek, Amen, for
[35:25] more authority than what God has given
[35:27] you? Amen.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; And that was going on in brother
[35:30] Brandham's day. They were gain saying
[35:32] against the voice of a prophet in that
[35:34] day thinking that where they were equal
[35:36] to him
[35:37] &gt;&gt; that they could understand the word. How
[35:39] could they understand the word more than
[35:41] a vindicated prophet who's the
[35:42] interpreter of the word?
[35:44] &gt;&gt; There ain't no way. But if that was true
[35:46] for that day, it's still true today. God
[35:49] forbid there'd be chorus that would rise
[35:51] up in this camp in this message and
[35:53] think that they have a better way than
[35:54] the prophet
[35:56] &gt;&gt; or a better understanding or a better
[35:58] interpretation or they could correct.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; I say no God help us not to have any
[36:04] let's just be happy being the children
[36:06] of God. Let's be happy being ministers.
[36:09] Let's be happy being called to our
[36:10] position. If we're if we're preachers,
[36:12] let's be happy preaching under the
[36:14] headship of a prophet in this day. Let's
[36:17] be happy in our position and thank God
[36:19] that he sent a voice that was vindicated
[36:22] that we have thus sayeth the Lord on the
[36:23] scriptures and we don't have to wonder
[36:25] about it. We can just stay under the
[36:27] authority and know amen that this is the
[36:29] voice that God had used to bring back
[36:31] the correct word and I don't need to
[36:33] worry about bumping outside of these
[36:35] boundaries. I can stay right here
[36:37] because this is where God placed me
[36:39] &gt;&gt; and I can minister to the congregation.
[36:42] I can be I can I can have joy in my
[36:44] position. Amen.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; That there was pride that was rising up
[36:48] and they thought they were equal. And we
[36:50] know that Kora and them ended up being
[36:52] completely destroyed.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; And so that's what will happen. Amen.
[36:58] For those who oppose or contradict the
[37:03] prophet of the age, they get swallowed
[37:06] up in the world and they get consumed
[37:08] and they get destroyed those and all
[37:10] that are near to them.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Moses would come to the to
[37:15] their camps and God would send him there
[37:17] and he would say, "Tell the people to
[37:19] separate from these men."
[37:21] And those that separated were saved and
[37:24] those that stayed close were swallowed
[37:25] up when the earth opened up and
[37:27] swallowed them home. Said, "God, help us
[37:30] to stay with the the voice for this age.
[37:34] Let's not get caught up." Brother Bam
[37:36] goes back and saying uh if we go back to
[37:39] where we were reading he says I say
[37:40] those people fell for Kora in his gain
[37:43] sayings Kora is not a scriptural prophet
[37:46] but the people in great numbers with
[37:47] their leaders went for him.
[37:50] How like the evangelists today with
[37:51] their golden calf schemes like Koras.
[37:53] They look good to the people as Kora
[37:56] looked good then. They have blood on
[37:58] their foreheads, oil in their hands and
[38:00] balls of fire on the platform. They
[38:03] allow women preachers let women cut
[38:05] their hair, wear slacks and shorts and
[38:06] bypass the word of God for their own
[38:08] creeds and dogmas. And that shows what
[38:11] kind of seed is in them.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; But not all the people turned on Moses
[38:16] and left the word of God. No, the elect
[38:19] stayed with him.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; The same is happening today. Praise God.
[38:23] Can you say amen?
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen. Let's let's look
[38:27] at uh what brother Bham says here in
[38:29] Leodyian church age said when the
[38:31] Methodists failed God raised up others
[38:33] and so it has gone on through the years
[38:35] until in the last day there is again
[38:37] another people in the land who under
[38:40] their messenger will be the final voice
[38:43] to the final age.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God. How many how many believe
[38:47] that this bride is going to be the final
[38:49] voice to the final age?
[38:51] &gt;&gt; So how is she going to accomplish that?
[38:54] I'll tell you right here, under under
[38:59] their messenger. Amen. Not correcting
[39:01] the messenger, not fixing what he got
[39:03] wrong, but if they stay under the
[39:05] headship of the word that was delivered
[39:06] through a prophetic ministry, Amen. then
[39:09] they'll be the final voice to the final
[39:11] age.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; But why did Lutheran why did Lutheran
[39:15] lose that position? Why did the
[39:16] Wesleyans lose that position? Because
[39:18] they became their own mouthpiece.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. They started speaking their own
[39:23] thing. They got out from under, amen,
[39:26] the word for their day. And they started
[39:27] coming up with their own ideas. And
[39:29] because they became their own
[39:31] mouthpiece, amen, they lost their right
[39:33] to speak for God. And God raised up
[39:35] another until in the final day. This
[39:37] bride is going to be the final voice to
[39:38] the final age. How? When she stays under
[39:42] her messenger.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Because you can only be the mouthpiece
[39:46] of God when you speak God's word.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:49] We start figuring out our own things and
[39:52] come up with own revelations and we have
[39:54] our own understandings. Amen. God will
[39:56] spew us out of his mouth the same as he
[39:58] did every other generation because he
[40:00] will only have a mouthpiece that speaks
[40:01] his word.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; And he worked on that prophet through
[40:05] poverty and through rejection and
[40:07] through all kinds of hardship until he
[40:09] got a man that was surrendered to him
[40:11] that would only say what he wanted him
[40:12] to say.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; And I want to be that kind of people
[40:16] that will only say what he wants us to
[40:17] say.
[40:20] Amen. In Revelation chapter 10, let's
[40:21] turn there together.
[40:40] Revelations 10:7
[40:43] says, "But in the days of the voice of
[40:44] the seventh angel, when he shall begin
[40:47] to sound, the mystery of God should be
[40:48] finished, as he hath declared to his
[40:50] servants, the prophets. And the voice
[40:52] which I heard from heaven spake unto me
[40:54] again, and said, go and take the little
[40:57] book which is open in the hand of the
[40:58] angel which standeth upon the sea and
[41:01] upon the earth." This is John that he's
[41:03] speaking through. the voice is telling
[41:04] him to go to the mighty angel which we
[41:06] know is Christ and take the little book
[41:08] which we know is the mystery of
[41:10] redemption the seventh seal and he says
[41:13] go take it out of his hand and he says
[41:16] so John here is representing the bride
[41:18] said I went unto the angel and I said
[41:20] unto him give me the little book and he
[41:22] said unto me take he said take it and
[41:26] eat it up and it shall make thy belly
[41:28] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[41:30] sweet as honey and I took the little
[41:32] book out of the angel's hand and ate it
[41:34] up. And it was in my mouth sweet as
[41:36] honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my
[41:38] belly was bitter. And he said unto me,
[41:41] "Thou must prophesy again before many
[41:44] prophets and nations and tongues and
[41:46] kings."
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we look at this, this John
[41:50] here is representing the bride in the
[41:52] end time. And she's to go to Christ to
[41:54] get the mystery. Amen. The open book.
[41:56] And and as she feeds on that, she
[41:58] becomes one with it. Amen. And as she
[42:00] feeds on it, it's sweet in her mouth.
[42:02] But when she goes to live it, there's
[42:04] rejection associated with it. There's
[42:06] separation that comes with proclaiming
[42:08] the word, and it's bitter in her belly.
[42:10] But he makes a statement. He said, "Thou
[42:12] must prophesy again." Amen. Before many
[42:16] peoples and nations and tongues and
[42:18] kings. And so that's the bride's
[42:20] ministry now. She's prophesying again.
[42:21] She's the final voice to the final age.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; But but the mi the the the most special
[42:27] word in all of this is again.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Prophesy again. Not. It didn't say
[42:32] prophesy. It said prophesy again. That
[42:35] means we're only going to prophesy
[42:36] what's been prophesied. Amen. We're not
[42:39] to come up with our own prophecies.
[42:41] We're only to declare what's been
[42:42] prophesied.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Now, don't get me wrong. It doesn't mean
[42:45] that we can't preach something out of a
[42:47] scripture that brother Bam didn't use.
[42:48] Brother Bam said, "I only hit the high
[42:50] parts. You dig down and you pull it
[42:52] out." But it can't be contrary. It can't
[42:54] contradict. It can't oppose. Amen. What
[42:57] the prophet has brought.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; The whole Bible's been open. We can
[43:00] preach from the entire scripture, the
[43:02] whole thing and God can give revelation
[43:04] on every scripture in the Bible. But
[43:06] that revelation being a true revelation
[43:08] from God can never be in opposition. It
[43:10] cannot be gains.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Against what the prophet brought.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; So we must prophesy again what's already
[43:20] been prophesied.
[43:22] Amen. God help us.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Help us to stay right there.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; All right. Let's go back to our little
[43:28] book. He says it shows what kind of seed
[43:33] is in them. Now, all the people turned
[43:34] on Moses and left the word of God. No,
[43:37] the elect stayed with him. The same is
[43:39] happening today. There's going to be
[43:41] elect that's going to stay with this
[43:43] message.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; They'll stay with it if they don't
[43:45] understand it. They'll stay with it if
[43:46] it hurts. They'll stay with it if it
[43:48] rubs the hide off of them and it brings
[43:50] separation to everybody else. There's
[43:52] going to be an elect that'll stay with
[43:53] this message
[43:54] &gt;&gt; the way it was brought. Amen.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Many are leaving the
[44:00] word, but some are staying with it. But
[44:03] remember the parable of the wheat and
[44:04] the tears. The tears have to be bundled
[44:06] for burning. These apostate churches are
[44:09] getting bound closer and closer
[44:10] together, ready for the fires of God's
[44:12] judgment, but the wheat is going to be
[44:14] gathered to the master."
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be wheat gathered to the
[44:21] master.
[44:22] Next paragraph he says, "Now I want you
[44:26] to be very careful here and see this.
[44:30] God has promise that at the end time
[44:32] Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled.
[44:35] It has to be." Now, now for us, this is
[44:38] elementary. This is basics. This is the
[44:41] foundation. We understood this from the
[44:43] beginning of believing the message. But
[44:45] brother Brandham is standing in a
[44:47] transition time. He's standing between
[44:49] Amen. the the the the former rain and
[44:51] the latter rain. He's standing between
[44:53] sewing the word and seeing what crop
[44:54] comes up. Amen. And and the ministry in
[44:57] Malachi 4 hasn't begun yet. And here he
[44:59] is in this position. And now the Holy
[45:01] Spirit's telling him, "Hey, hey, this is
[45:03] it." Amen. This is it. He said, "I I
[45:06] want you to be careful here and see
[45:07] this. God has promised that at the end
[45:09] time, Malachi 4 is going to be
[45:12] fulfilled." So when will Malachi 4 be
[45:14] fulfilled? At the end time.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:18] How many believe Malachi 4 has been
[45:19] fulfilled? That means we're in the end
[45:21] time. That means we've been in the end
[45:23] time. We're coming to the end of the end
[45:24] time.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; It has to be for it is the
[45:29] spiritquickened word of God spoken by
[45:32] the prophet Malachi. Jesus referred to
[45:34] it. I love this. We're going to get into
[45:37] this. Jesus referred to it. Jesus
[45:39] referred to what? Malachi 4 being
[45:41] fulfilled in the end time.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; We'll read it. It is just before Christ
[45:45] comes the second time. By the time Jesus
[45:48] comes, all scripture must be fulfilled.
[45:50] The gentile dispensation will be in its
[45:52] last church age. When that messenger of
[45:55] Malachi comes, he will be right with the
[45:58] word. He will take the whole Bible from
[46:00] Genesis to Revelation. He will start at
[46:03] the serpent seed and carry on to the
[46:05] messenger in the latter reign. But he
[46:07] will be rejected by the denominations.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Yeah,
[46:11] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to go look at Malachi 4 again.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Let's do our review.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Says Malachi 4, as brother Bram says in
[46:20] this in this message of pick up your pen
[46:23] and write as the Holy Spirit's anointing
[46:25] him to write. He said God has promised
[46:27] that at the end time Malachi 4 is going
[46:30] to be fulfilled.
[46:32] It'll be in the la the the the the
[46:36] gentile dispensation will be in its last
[46:38] church age when the messenger of Malachi
[46:41] comes. And so it says, "Behold, I will
[46:45] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[46:48] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[46:50] the Lord. And he shall turn the hearts
[46:52] of the fathers to the children, and the
[46:54] heart of the children to their fathers,
[46:56] lest I come and smite the earth with a
[46:58] curse."
[47:00] So, is it okay if I do a little review?
[47:03] &gt;&gt; I didn't expect you to say no.
[47:07] He shall turn the heart of the fathers
[47:11] to the children.
[47:14] He's going to turn the heart of the
[47:15] fathers to the children. What fathers?
[47:18] He's going to turn the heart of the
[47:20] Jewish fathers.
[47:23] The Jewish fathers
[47:28] to what? children
[47:30] to the New Testament children
[47:35] because now there's coming a way of
[47:36] grace, a new and living way. And so God
[47:40] is going to turn the hearts of the
[47:41] children, the Jewish fathers, the hearts
[47:44] of the fathers, the Jewish fathers to
[47:46] the children. But then we've got then
[47:48] then let me erase this and we've got
[47:50] this little comma here.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Does anybody know what comma means?
[47:55] &gt;&gt; It's a pause.
[47:58] How long was this pause?
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; This was a 2,000year pause.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because John the Baptist fulfilled
[48:06] the first part of that. John was here.
[48:08] Amen. To bring them to repentance, to
[48:10] bring them from the old Jewish
[48:11] tradition, Amen, into a new living way.
[48:14] And Jesus Christ was going to be the
[48:15] keystone of that. And he was the final
[48:17] prophet of the Old Testament, bringing
[48:19] in Christ. Amen. And so he turned the
[48:21] heart of the fathers to the children.
[48:23] But after this pause, Amen. And after
[48:25] this 2,000-year pause, he's going to the
[48:28] spirit of Elijah is going to anoint a
[48:31] man to take the heart of the children to
[48:34] their fathers.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Which children? Now, it's going to be
[48:38] the New Testament.
[48:44] New Testament children
[48:47] &gt;&gt; to what fathers? The New Testament
[48:50] fathers.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:56] which are the apostles.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; That was the ministry of William Brham.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; To take us back. You see, it doesn't
[49:07] make sense. Amen. If we take them back
[49:09] to the Jewish fathers, if they turn the
[49:12] heart of the New Testament children back
[49:13] to the Jewish fathers, we've gone back
[49:15] to the law of Moses. But the but the Old
[49:18] Testament Jews became, Amen. became the
[49:21] children of the New Testament. They were
[49:22] born again in a new and living way in
[49:24] the age of grace and became the children
[49:26] of God. Born again by the spirit of God.
[49:29] Amen. And they became the fathers of the
[49:31] faith. And now in the end time, the
[49:33] children of the New Testament of the
[49:35] church ages are going to be turned back
[49:37] to the fathers of the faith, the
[49:38] apostles and prophets of old.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; And that's going to be fulfilled. Amen.
[49:44] in brother Brandham's ministry and and
[49:46] and this the the Holy Spirit's telling
[49:48] him it's going to happen in the end time
[49:50] when the church is in its last age and
[49:52] he's going to give other conditions and
[49:53] we're going to look at that here
[49:54] shortly.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bram said Jesus spoke of
[49:59] this in Matthew 17:10. It says, "And his
[50:01] disciples asked him, saying, why then
[50:04] say the scribes that Elias must first
[50:06] come? And Jesus answered and said unto
[50:08] them, Elias truly shall first come."
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:13] Shall shall is future.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke of this.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; He said Elias is Elijah. Elijah truly
[50:24] shall first come. There is going to come
[50:26] an Elijah. And what is that Elijah that
[50:29] shall come? What's he going to do? He's
[50:31] going to restore all things.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Hang on to that word restore. Because
[50:37] when Elijah when Elijah shall truly
[50:40] come, first come, Amen. He will restore
[50:42] all things.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Then he goes on to say, "But I say unto
[50:47] you, that Elias is come already."
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; And they knew him not and have done unto
[50:54] him whatsoever they listed. Likewise
[50:56] also the son of man suffer. Then the
[50:59] disciples, look at this. He says, "Then
[51:00] the disciples understood that he spake
[51:02] to them of John the Baptist." John the
[51:04] Baptist was the Elias that had come
[51:06] already.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:08] But there was an Elias that's going to
[51:10] truly come.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Shall first come and restore all things.
[51:15] But John the Baptist did not restore
[51:17] anything. He had no restoration
[51:19] ministry. So this shall come. Jesus was
[51:22] speaking of Malachi 4 being re uh being
[51:25] fulfilled at the end time at the last
[51:27] age. Amen. The last messenger.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[51:33] In Matthew 3 it says, "In those days
[51:35] came John the Baptist preaching in the
[51:37] wilderness of Judea and saying repent ye
[51:39] for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[51:41] For this is he that was spoken of by the
[51:44] prophet Isaiah's Isaiah
[51:47] saying the voice of one crying in the
[51:50] wilderness, prepare ye the way of the
[51:52] Lord and make his path straight." This
[51:54] is the prophecy that John the Baptist
[51:56] fulfilled. And in this prophecy, if
[51:59] you'll notice, it says, "Prepare,
[52:03] &gt;&gt; not restore."
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Because the Elias that shall first come
[52:08] will restore. Amen. And and why were
[52:11] they asking Jesus this question, Eli
[52:13] shall first come? They had come down off
[52:14] Mount Transfiguration. They had seen the
[52:17] Lord glorified. Amen. And they said,
[52:18] "But but I thought Elijah shall first
[52:20] come before this." He says, "He is going
[52:22] to come, but he's already come." Amen.
[52:24] The first one has come because it's time
[52:26] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[52:28] children. But he shall come and restore.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; The first one who comes prepares.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; The next time he comes, he restores.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's not one scripture in the
[52:43] Bible that talks about John the Baptist
[52:45] restoring.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Not one.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Go to this one. John chapter 1. They
[52:53] asked him, "What then? Art thou Elias?"
[52:56] They first before this, the next verse
[52:58] before they said, "Art thou that
[52:59] Christ?" He said, "No, I'm not.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; It's not Christ." Well, then they said,
[53:03] "Are you Elijah?"
[53:07] And he and he said, "I am not."
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Now listen,
[53:14] technically
[53:16] he was fulfilling the first part of
[53:17] Malachi 4. He was Elijah, but he knew
[53:21] what they were talking about.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I'm not what you think."
[53:25] Amen. I'm not that Elijah
[53:27] &gt;&gt; out there a prophet. He says, "Art thou
[53:29] a prophet?"
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Uh and he answered, "Are art thou that
[53:34] prophet?" That's important. That
[53:36] prophet,
[53:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:37] &gt;&gt; And he answered, "No."
[53:39] Then said they unto him, "Who art thou
[53:42] that we may give an answer to them that
[53:43] sent us? What sayest thyself?" He said,
[53:46] "I am the voice of one crying in the
[53:48] wilderness. Make straight the way of the
[53:50] Lord as say the prophet Isaiah." So, he
[53:53] keeps telling you who he is. He's not
[53:55] Malachi 4. He's not that Elijah. I'm not
[53:58] that prophet. This is who I am.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; This is the prophecy out of Isaiah.
[54:05] They're referring to the voice of him
[54:07] that cryth in the wilderness, "Prepare
[54:10] ye the way of the Lord. Make straight
[54:13] the desert a highway for our God. Every
[54:15] valley shall be exalted. Every mountain
[54:17] and hill shall be made low, and the
[54:19] crooked shall be made straight, and the
[54:20] rough places plain, and the glory of the
[54:22] Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh
[54:24] shall see it together, for the mouth of
[54:25] the Lord has spoken it. This is who John
[54:28] the Baptist says he is. This is the
[54:30] scripture he said he's fulfilling.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; He said it himself.
[54:35] And this prophecy was to prepare.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:41] Now Luke chapter 3 says, "And he came
[54:45] into all the country about Jordan,
[54:46] speaking of John the Baptist, preaching
[54:48] the baptism of repentance for the
[54:49] remission of sins, as was written in the
[54:52] book, as it is written in the book of
[54:54] Isaiah's saying, the voice of one, the
[54:58] voice of one crying in the wilderness,
[55:00] prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his
[55:02] path straight. Every valley shall be
[55:03] filled, every mountain and hill shall be
[55:05] brought low, and the crooked shall be
[55:06] made straight, and the rough places of
[55:09] and all flesh shall see that. That's
[55:11] what we just read
[55:13] &gt;&gt; almost verbatim out of Isaiah 40. Amen.
[55:15] And now Luke is telling us, so Matthew
[55:18] tells us, Mark tells us, John himself
[55:20] tells you, and Luke, they all tell us
[55:22] who John the Baptist is. And John the
[55:24] Baptist is the voice of one crying in
[55:26] the wilderness preparing a way.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh you see that prepare ye the
[55:34] way. Prepare. Prepare. It's always
[55:37] prepare. Make straight the way. Make
[55:39] straight the path. Bring the high, low,
[55:40] the low, high. Prepare. Prepare.
[55:42] Prepare.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, let's go to Mark. In the
[55:47] beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[55:49] the son of God, as it is written of the
[55:51] prophets, behold, I send my messenger
[55:53] before thy face, which shall prepare the
[55:55] way before thee, the voice of one crying
[55:58] in the wilderness. This is the prophecy
[56:00] we've been dealing with all of I'm
[56:02] sorry.
[56:04] This is the prophecy.
[56:06] The voice of one crying in the
[56:08] wilderness, prepare ye the way of the
[56:09] Lord. Make his path straight. This is
[56:11] Isaiah
[56:15] 40. That's the one that was repeated in
[56:17] Matthew and Luke and in John. Amen.
[56:20] That's this. But this is something new.
[56:23] This is something that hadn't been said
[56:24] yet. Amen. Prepare you the way before
[56:27] thee. Behold, this is a different
[56:29] prophecy. This doesn't come out of
[56:31] Isaiah. This prophecy here comes out of
[56:34] Malachi,
[56:37] but not Malachi 4.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Malachi 3.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Bam said he was
[56:42] Malachi 3, not Malachi 4. Amen. So,
[56:46] behold, they took two prophecies in the
[56:48] book of Mark and they put them together
[56:50] because John fulfilled both. Behold, I
[56:52] send my messenger before my face which
[56:54] shall do what? Prepare.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; So the prophecy in Isaiah is prepare.
[57:01] And the prophecy in Malachi is prepare.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Malachi 3:1, "Behold, I send my
[57:08] messenger and he shall prepare
[57:11] &gt;&gt; the way before me. And the Lord whom you
[57:13] seek shall suddenly come to his temple,
[57:15] even the messenger of the covenant whom
[57:17] you delight. And behold, he shall come,
[57:19] sayaeth the Lord of hosts."
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's what here's what Jesus
[57:26] says. Matthew 11. And as they departed,
[57:30] Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
[57:31] concerning John, "What went you out into
[57:34] the wilderness to see? A reed shaken
[57:36] with the wind. But what went you out for
[57:38] to see? A man clothed in soft raignment?
[57:40] Behold, they that wear soft clothing are
[57:42] in king's houses. But what went you out
[57:45] for to see? A prophet. Yay, I say unto
[57:48] you, and more than a prophet, for this
[57:49] is he of whom it is written, Behold, I
[57:52] send my messenger before thy face, which
[57:54] shall prepare the way before me, Malachi
[58:00] 3.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; So, who does Jesus say that John the
[58:04] Baptist is? Jesus says he's Malachi 3.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist says he's Isaiah 4,
[58:10] Isaiah 40. Amen. Uh, Matthew says he's
[58:13] Isaiah 40. Luke says he's Isaiah 40.
[58:16] Mark says he's Malachi 3 and Isaiah 40,
[58:19] but you'll never find any scripture,
[58:21] amen, that tells you that John the
[58:23] Baptist is a restorer of anything. He's
[58:26] a preparer because if he came at the end
[58:28] of the Jewish dispensation to restore,
[58:30] he would take him back to the law of
[58:32] Moses. But he wasn't there to restore.
[58:34] He was there to prepare because there's
[58:36] coming a new and living way. Grace was
[58:38] being open. The New Testament was
[58:40] coming. Christ was coming as a sacrifice
[58:42] for all sin. He wasn't restoring. He was
[58:45] preparing.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; There was a new entrance, a new gate
[58:48] opening, something, a new way coming.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Don't you love review?
[58:56] &gt;&gt; It becomes more real all the time.
[58:58] Friend,
[58:59] &gt;&gt; this word never fails. And what God sent
[59:01] us was a word, prophet. And that word
[59:03] prophet stays exactly with the word. And
[59:05] he knows the word. He's got a seventh
[59:07] grade education. He told you one time, I
[59:09] hope you understand what I'm saying. I
[59:11] don't have language enough to explain
[59:12] it.
[59:14] He didn't have the credentials. He
[59:16] didn't have the language. But what he
[59:18] had was the mind of God. And what he had
[59:20] was a gift. Amen. To pick up on the true
[59:22] interpretation of the word. And he would
[59:24] stay exactly with that word.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 1, this is when the angel
[59:32] comes to Zachchariah
[59:34] before John the Baptist is born. And the
[59:37] angel comes to Zachchariah.
[59:39] It says, "And he shall go before him in
[59:41] the spirit and power of Elias," that's
[59:44] Elijah,
[59:45] &gt;&gt; "to turn the hearts of the fathers to
[59:48] the children."
[59:50] &gt;&gt; See the comma?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; That's as far as he went in the Malachi
[59:55] 4 prophecy.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Pause.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; For 2,000
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; years.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. He did prepare. He did turn
[1:00:10] the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:00:12] children, the Jewish fathers to the
[1:00:14] children of the New Testament, but he
[1:00:17] went no farther in the prophecy. And the
[1:00:19] angel who spoke to to to uh Zachcharias,
[1:00:23] John's father, he was exactly with the
[1:00:26] word and he stopped at the right place
[1:00:28] to stop.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:00:32] children and the disobedient to the
[1:00:33] wisdom of the just to make ready a
[1:00:35] people.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:38] prepared for the Lord.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Even this angel knew what John the
[1:00:43] Baptist portion was. It was preparation
[1:00:46] prepared for the Lord, not restoration.
[1:00:50] He was preparing. He was only there to
[1:00:52] fulfill the first half. And because he
[1:00:54] only fulfilled the first half, when they
[1:00:55] said, "Are you Elijah?" He said, "No."
[1:00:56] "Are you that prophet?" "No." "Who are
[1:00:58] you? I'm the voice of one crying in the
[1:01:00] wilderness, prepare you the way of the
[1:01:02] Lord." He knew his part of the prophecy.
[1:01:05] The angel knew his part of the prophecy.
[1:01:07] Amen. And he stayed true to that part of
[1:01:09] the prophecy. But after the comma,
[1:01:11] there's another part yet to be
[1:01:13] fulfilled. And I say it's been
[1:01:14] fulfilled. It's been fulfilled in this
[1:01:16] generation. There come a man with the
[1:01:18] spirit of Elijah named William Brandham.
[1:01:20] And he fulfilled the rest of that
[1:01:22] prophecy.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; And God vindicated and confirmed it. And
[1:01:26] it's without question to those who have
[1:01:28] eyes to see and ears to hear
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; and a heart to perceive. Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; You'll never find the Bible saying that
[1:01:36] that that that John the Baptist
[1:01:37] fulfilled the Malachi 4 prophecy.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; They don't even refer to it other than
[1:01:41] the angel here.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; There's no reference. Jesus doesn't
[1:01:44] refer to it. The Gospels don't refer to
[1:01:46] it. Why, brother Bam? said Jesus did.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; How did he Elijah sha truly shall come
[1:01:54] first.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus put it off in the future.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. the fulfillment of the Malachi 4
[1:02:01] prophecy.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; So behold, I will send you Elijah the
[1:02:05] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:02:06] and dreadful day of the Lord. He shall
[1:02:09] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[1:02:10] children and the heart of the children
[1:02:12] to their fathers, lest I come and smite
[1:02:15] the curse, smite the earth with a curse.
[1:02:18] So that prophecy,
[1:02:20] I say it this way, this day, this
[1:02:22] prophecy is fulfilled.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; This day, this prophecy is fulfilled.
[1:02:30] Amen.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; He said it would happen at the end time
[1:02:35] in the last age. This messenger would
[1:02:38] come. And this messenger has come.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; And he's restored. And he's restored by
[1:02:43] restoring to the original teaching of
[1:02:45] the apostolic fathers. Brought us back
[1:02:47] to the original truth. The original
[1:02:48] truth on grace, justification,
[1:02:50] sanctification, the truth of baptism,
[1:02:52] Holy Ghost, the truth of the word of
[1:02:54] God. Brought our identification. Amen.
[1:02:56] and brought the mystery of God and the
[1:02:57] opening of the seals and tied together
[1:02:59] Revelation 10 with Malachi 4
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; and he turned our hearts back because
[1:03:06] that was part of the ministry of Elijah.
[1:03:11] Let's continue reading. Let's go back to
[1:03:13] our booklet here
[1:03:17] and go to the bottom. Paragraph 174-2
[1:03:21] on page six
[1:03:23] says he has to be for that is history
[1:03:26] repeating itself from the time of Ahab
[1:03:31] Israel history under Ahab is happening
[1:03:34] right here in America where the prophet
[1:03:36] of Malachi appears
[1:03:39] oh if you can underline circle highlight
[1:03:42] I would highlight that underline it
[1:03:44] circle it put a star beside it something
[1:03:46] because he's saying history repeating
[1:03:49] itself from the time of Ahab. So,
[1:03:51] Brother Brandham is going to tie the
[1:03:53] fulfillment of this prophecy with
[1:03:55] Elijah. Amen. With the time of Ahab
[1:03:57] because it was in the time of Ahab,
[1:03:59] Elijah was prophesying.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; And now, Brother Brandham doesn't leave
[1:04:02] it in history. Now, there's a spirit of
[1:04:04] Elijah on the earth. So, there's going
[1:04:06] to be a spirit of Ahab on the earth. And
[1:04:08] he says, "Israel history under Ahab is
[1:04:10] happening right here in America
[1:04:14] where the prophet of Malachi appears."
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. As Israel left Egypt to worship in
[1:04:20] freedom, pushed out the natives, raised
[1:04:22] up a nation with great leaders like
[1:04:24] David, and then put an Ahab on the
[1:04:26] throne with a Jezebel behind him to
[1:04:28] direct. So have we done the very same in
[1:04:31] America. He's running the parallels now.
[1:04:34] Our forefathers left for this land to
[1:04:37] worship and live in freedom. I want you
[1:04:39] to make note of that. To worship and
[1:04:41] live in freedom,
[1:04:43] religious freedom. Because brother Ben,
[1:04:46] this is what he's referring to because
[1:04:47] this is when they voted in a Catholic
[1:04:49] president and brother Benham marks it as
[1:04:50] Ahab coming to the throne.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; He said they pushed back the natives and
[1:04:55] they took over the land. Mighty men like
[1:04:57] Washington and Lincoln were raised up.
[1:04:59] But after a while, other men of such
[1:05:01] poor caliber succeeded those worthy men
[1:05:04] that soon an Ahab was set in the
[1:05:07] presidential chair with a Jezebel behind
[1:05:10] him to direct him.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Did you catch presidential chair? Amen.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, it was a king,
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; but in the New Testament, it's a
[1:05:19] presidential chair. What year are we in?
[1:05:21] We're in 1962. Amen. When he first gets
[1:05:24] this message, Amen. It's he first gives
[1:05:26] it and spoken. Where's the original
[1:05:28] seed? March 1962. Amen. Uh uh uh John F.
[1:05:32] Kennedy, the first Catholic president of
[1:05:34] the United States, was elected, amen, in
[1:05:36] November, November 8th of 1960. He was
[1:05:38] inaugurated in the beginning of 1961.
[1:05:41] here, brothers, in the beginning of 1962
[1:05:43] and saying exactly what Israel done,
[1:05:45] America's done. What happened there is
[1:05:47] repeating right now in America because
[1:05:50] there's an Ahab come to the presidential
[1:05:52] seat with a Jezebel. Who's the Jezebel?
[1:05:54] The Jezebel is that Catholic system
[1:05:56] because the Catholic Church is referred
[1:05:58] to as Jezebel.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; In the book of Revelation, the prophet
[1:06:01] is Jezebel who deceived the people.
[1:06:04] Amen. And now he's saying that here
[1:06:06] comes a man Ahab married to a Jezebel
[1:06:08] system. And the Jezebel system is the
[1:06:10] one behind it pushing all the works
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; has to happen friends because there has
[1:06:17] to come an Elijah on the scene at the
[1:06:20] time Ahab's on the scene so that God can
[1:06:22] bring a vindication so it's not just a
[1:06:24] man saying something but it's God
[1:06:26] backing it up from his Bible.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; We're going to we're going to see that.
[1:06:34] So he says, "Soon and Ahab was set on
[1:06:36] the presidential chair with a Jezebel
[1:06:38] behind him to direct him. It is at such
[1:06:40] a time as this that the messenger of
[1:06:44] Malachi must come."
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Now let's go back and let's just go back
[1:06:49] in our mind. Where is Brother Brandham
[1:06:51] in his ministry in this time? He's
[1:06:54] preached the seven church ages. I mean
[1:06:56] he he's tells us we're in Leodysia. He
[1:06:59] tells us it's the end of the ages.
[1:07:01] There's a transition time. Something has
[1:07:03] to come. And now in the time that
[1:07:05] brother Brandham is at the time that
[1:07:08] he's finishing preaching the church ages
[1:07:10] is the time that JFK gets elected.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; And and then brother Renom realizes he
[1:07:18] begins to realize this is monumental.
[1:07:20] We've elected a Catholic. And he starts
[1:07:22] talking about it back then that it's
[1:07:23] wrong that it's not right that we were
[1:07:25] trying to get away from that system when
[1:07:27] we formed this nation. Now we've gone
[1:07:28] right back into it. But here he comes in
[1:07:31] the transition time, not knowing what's
[1:07:33] coming next, but knowing what's
[1:07:34] transpired. And here the Holy Spirit
[1:07:37] says, "Pick up your pen and write."
[1:07:38] There's a I'm going to give you the
[1:07:40] answer to your question. And the answer
[1:07:42] to your question is when Ahab is on the
[1:07:44] throne with the Jezebel backing him.
[1:07:46] That's the hour that Malachi's got to
[1:07:48] come on the scene.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; It has to happen right then. It can't
[1:07:51] happen before. It can't happen after.
[1:07:53] It's got to happen right then.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; So what did God do?
[1:07:59] He changed politics and let people move
[1:08:01] into position and things happen. That's
[1:08:04] right.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Why? Because brother Renham was born
[1:08:06] under a sign at the right time.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; And when he was coming into the maturity
[1:08:12] in his ministry, there had to be an Ahab
[1:08:15] on the throne with a Jezebel to back
[1:08:17] him. Amen. For Elijah ministry to be
[1:08:19] confirmed in the word.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; And God let it all work out perfect.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to First Kings. We were in
[1:08:27] this last time two weeks ago. First
[1:08:30] Kings 18, this is the Mount Carmel
[1:08:32] showdown. He says, "And it came to pass
[1:08:33] at the time of the offering of the
[1:08:36] evening sacrifice." This is the evening
[1:08:38] time message, the evening time
[1:08:40] sacrifice,
[1:08:42] the lamb coming back in the evening
[1:08:44] time. that Elijah the prophet came near
[1:08:47] and said,"Lord God of Abraham, Isaac,
[1:08:48] and of Israel. Let it be known this day
[1:08:51] that thou art God in Israel, and that I
[1:08:53] am thy servant, and that I've done all
[1:08:54] these things at thy word." I think
[1:08:57] brother Bam could say that
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; he did everything as God led him and
[1:09:01] directed him. Hear me, oh Lord. Hear me
[1:09:04] that this people may know that thou art
[1:09:05] the Lord God, and that thou has turned
[1:09:08] their heart back again. Because it's the
[1:09:11] ministry of Elijah to turn their hearts
[1:09:13] back again. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Then the fire of the Lord fell and
[1:09:17] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:09:19] wood and the stones and the dust and
[1:09:20] licked up the water was in the trench.
[1:09:23] When all the people saw it, what did
[1:09:24] they see? They saw the supernatural that
[1:09:26] only God could do.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; And when they saw it, they fell on their
[1:09:30] faces and they said, "The Lord, he is
[1:09:32] God. The Lord, he is God." And under the
[1:09:35] Elijah ministry, he was turning their
[1:09:37] hearts back again. And he did it through
[1:09:40] supernatural signs.
[1:09:42] This is what brother Brenham says in
[1:09:44] restoration of the bride tree. He says,
[1:09:46] "There's an iron curtain. There's a
[1:09:48] bamboo curtain. There's a purple
[1:09:50] curtain." Brother, don't you fear none
[1:09:52] of the rest of them, but watch that
[1:09:54] purple curtain. She is sitting right
[1:09:57] here on the throne today in this
[1:09:59] country. Oh, we're going to have to
[1:10:01] underline that.
[1:10:03] What is the purple curtain?
[1:10:06] Watch that purple curtain. She is
[1:10:08] sitting right here on the throne today
[1:10:10] in this country. How how'd the purple
[1:10:13] curtain get there? Through a Catholic
[1:10:15] president.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Remember, just like Ahab did, Jezebel
[1:10:19] behind him. The Bible calls the Catholic
[1:10:21] Church Jezebel prostitute. And Ahab
[1:10:23] wasn't no bad guy. I don't say that. Mr.
[1:10:27] Kennedy, whoa, whoa, whoa. Who are we
[1:10:28] talking about? Mr. Kennedy and Ahab,
[1:10:31] could they be he referring to the same
[1:10:33] thing?
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't a nice man? I don't know nothing
[1:10:36] about him. He's a man. That's all I
[1:10:38] know. He's the president. I believe
[1:10:40] he'll make a good president. It's not
[1:10:41] him. It's that system behind him.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Rem's looking at.
[1:10:48] That spiritual system behind it now
[1:10:50] coming to authority and he's recognizing
[1:10:52] this is the hour and the spirit of God
[1:10:54] is pointing it out to him. So, this is
[1:10:57] John F. Kennedy. He was uh elected
[1:10:59] president through the vote in uh
[1:11:01] November of 1960, inaugurated in ' 61.
[1:11:05] Brother Me says this, "And remember in
[1:11:08] that time all the ministers give in.
[1:11:10] Jezebel was the leader." Listen, Ahab
[1:11:13] himself was a pretty nice guy, but
[1:11:15] Jezebel was the neck behind the head.
[1:11:18] She was the one who did it. She was the
[1:11:20] renegade. I ain't got nothing against
[1:11:23] that man as president, but it's that
[1:11:25] Jezebel system that's behind it.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here, brother Brandham
[1:11:33] in spoken words. The original seed says,
[1:11:36] "I'm going to say things I haven't said
[1:11:37] before. I've come to a transition. I've
[1:11:39] got to be honest. I got to tell you
[1:11:41] things I may never tell you." But he's
[1:11:42] telling you, "It's finished. It's done.
[1:11:44] The seeds are sewn. Now watch the
[1:11:46] harvest that comes. It's finished. Amen.
[1:11:48] Something has to change. But God's done
[1:11:50] with the churches and he's done with the
[1:11:51] systems. It's all sewed down. The
[1:11:53] revival is over. Now see what happens."
[1:11:56] Yeah.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; And then God starts to speak to him and
[1:11:58] tell him that it's at the time America's
[1:12:01] at now. Malachi's got to come.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; And brother Benham knows that and he
[1:12:06] starts starts picking that out and
[1:12:07] starts preaching it.
[1:12:10] But I just want to show you how perfect
[1:12:12] God is.
[1:12:14] Amen. If we look at the death of Ahab.
[1:12:18] Remember, brother Bam's already tied
[1:12:20] John. F. Kennedy to Ahab.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. and Jezebel to the Catholic Church
[1:12:24] because Jezebel brought in mixed
[1:12:26] religion. She began to bring in paganism
[1:12:28] and mix it in with Judaism and that was
[1:12:30] the problem because because uh Elijah
[1:12:32] says if Baal be God serve him or if
[1:12:35] Jehovah be God serve him. Quit serving
[1:12:36] both. Quit mixing the religion because
[1:12:38] that's what Jezebel did,
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; She brought in paganism and that's what
[1:12:43] the Catholic Church did. She brought
[1:12:44] paganism in and mixed it in with the
[1:12:46] true word.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; And now the death of Ahab. Now Ahab's
[1:12:52] John of Kenny's a type of Ahab said,
[1:12:55] "And a certain man drew a bow out of
[1:12:57] venture."
[1:12:59] I want you to look at that word at a
[1:13:01] venture.
[1:13:03] It was a long shot.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; And smokeote the king of Israel between
[1:13:08] the joints of the harness. Wherefore he
[1:13:10] said unto the driver of his chariot,
[1:13:12] "Turn thine hand and carry me out of the
[1:13:14] host, for I am wounded." And the battle
[1:13:17] increased that day. And the king was
[1:13:18] stayed up in his chariot against the
[1:13:20] Syrians and died at evening and the
[1:13:22] blood ran out of the wound in the midst
[1:13:24] of the chariot.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Where was Ahab shot? In his chariot.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; John F. Kennedy was assassinated in
[1:13:34] November on November 22nd, 1963. And
[1:13:37] where was he shot? In his car.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; In his chariot. And the blood ran out in
[1:13:42] his chariot. And what kind of shot was
[1:13:43] it? It was one that they couldn't even
[1:13:45] believe that man could make. It was a
[1:13:46] long shot. It was an expert shot. It was
[1:13:48] a chance.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, these things aren't by
[1:13:52] chance. God's putting a stamp on this
[1:13:53] and saying, "Look, have eyes to see.
[1:13:56] This is where we're at."
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I went through this some some
[1:14:01] years ago, but I just want to go through
[1:14:03] it again because it just stunned me.
[1:14:05] Amen. It's absolutely stunning. And some
[1:14:08] of you will remember when we went
[1:14:09] through this and some of you may not,
[1:14:12] but Ahab dies in First Kings.
[1:14:18] First Kings 2235
[1:14:23] and JFK dies
[1:14:25] on November
[1:14:28] 22nd,
[1:14:30] 1963.
[1:14:35] If you guys remember, I I I I went
[1:14:38] through this a couple years ago, and I
[1:14:40] don't know uh if you'll remember all
[1:14:42] these. I don't even remember exactly
[1:14:43] when it was, but I was going to pre I
[1:14:46] was preaching about Elijah, something
[1:14:47] about Elijah and typing it with brother
[1:14:50] Benham and the Malachi prophecy. I was
[1:14:51] going to preach on that and I was in the
[1:14:52] back room and I was uh just preparing
[1:14:56] and I was just sitting there thinking
[1:14:57] about Ahab and Kennedy. I think about
[1:14:59] all of these things and I was looking at
[1:15:02] this scripture and all of a sudden I I
[1:15:05] recognized that chariot and venture and
[1:15:07] I'd known that before but it started to
[1:15:09] really have impact on me and all of a
[1:15:11] sudden a thought came in my mind and I'm
[1:15:12] not saying it was anything spiritual
[1:15:14] just a thought and it says what day what
[1:15:18] day was JFK assassinated? So I had to
[1:15:21] grab my phone and look it up and I
[1:15:23] looked it up. It was November. And I I
[1:15:25] didn't know really what that meant, but
[1:15:27] I just all of a sudden I thought that
[1:15:29] November
[1:15:31] is the 11th month
[1:15:34] of the year. So I thought that was
[1:15:37] interesting. So I looked at my Bible and
[1:15:40] all of a sudden another thought came and
[1:15:42] said, "What book of the Bibles First
[1:15:44] Kings?" I didn't know. So I flipped it
[1:15:46] open to the, you know, the front where
[1:15:48] you can count and that's how I find my
[1:15:49] scriptures. Sometimes I don't remember
[1:15:51] where the books are in order. And I
[1:15:53] counted Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
[1:15:55] Numbers, Deuteronomy
[1:15:58] in First Kings is the 11th book.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; 22nd chapter, 22nd day.
[1:16:06] And I started looking at this. I said,
[1:16:08] "But this is 35,
[1:16:11] verse 35, and this is 1963." Well, it
[1:16:14] makes sense because brother Brennham has
[1:16:16] to be on the scene, right?
[1:16:20] Elijah,
[1:16:23] but I didn't understand this. And so I'm
[1:16:26] just I was just sitting there. I mean,
[1:16:28] just sitting there because I don't know.
[1:16:29] I don't know what it means. And another
[1:16:31] thought come in my mind and it said,
[1:16:34] "Which number president
[1:16:36] was JFK?"
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; And do you want to guess which number
[1:16:40] president he is?
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; He is the 35th
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; president.
[1:16:50] of the USA.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; You think God can't confirm his word?
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; God can confirm his word, friends. God
[1:16:58] knows exactly what he's doing. He's
[1:16:59] right on time. He's perfect in every
[1:17:01] way. And if the angel of the Lord said,
[1:17:03] "This is the day. This is the hour
[1:17:05] Malachi has to and Ahab and Jezebel."
[1:17:08] And it happens just the same way it
[1:17:09] happens in the Bible. I say God is
[1:17:11] amazing. We have no room to doubt, no
[1:17:13] reason to question anything he's done
[1:17:15] because God is amazing, friends.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; No man puts that together. No, brother
[1:17:20] Brandham couldn't figure that out. How
[1:17:21] could he make that happen? And he
[1:17:22] already talked about Ahab and Jezebel
[1:17:24] and all that before he was assassin.
[1:17:27] Brother Bram didn't know the man was
[1:17:28] going to be assassinated. He already
[1:17:30] started talking about Malachi 4,
[1:17:31] Elijah's got to come on the scene. Ahab
[1:17:33] and Jezebel and America's the same as
[1:17:35] Israel. And he laid it all out. And
[1:17:37] because God had showed it to him and the
[1:17:39] angel of the Lord showed it to him and
[1:17:40] the Holy Spirit had revealed it to him
[1:17:41] and he he stuck his life on it. He
[1:17:44] didn't know that this was going to
[1:17:45] happen. But God confirms the word of
[1:17:47] that prophet. Amen. He doesn't let that
[1:17:49] prophet's word fall to the ground.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; I say thanks be to almighty God.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God almighty. Friends, Amen. We
[1:17:59] can we got confidence in the word of
[1:18:01] God. Oh, there's some who will still
[1:18:03] doubt. They're doubters. But if you got
[1:18:05] eyes to see, something in your heart
[1:18:06] just rejoices that you've got a God
[1:18:08] that's so perfect that reveals himself
[1:18:10] to you and wants you to know what hour
[1:18:12] you're living in. There's a reason he
[1:18:14] does these things, friends, because he
[1:18:15] wants you to have the confidence in that
[1:18:17] voice that God has restored the correct
[1:18:19] word. And you can bake on it and you can
[1:18:21] rest on it. And you don't have to twist
[1:18:23] it and wrestle it and figure it out and
[1:18:25] find out where Brother Bam's right and
[1:18:26] find out where he's wrong. You can just
[1:18:28] rest because God has confirmed his word.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; I don't need to figure anything else
[1:18:33] out. Brother Brandon didn't figure
[1:18:34] anything out. He just said what God
[1:18:36] showed him and God confirmed it and make
[1:18:37] it work out perfect. We can bank on it,
[1:18:39] friends, and rest underneath of it and
[1:18:41] stay in the boundaries of the message
[1:18:43] and we don't have to worry about it.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, thanks be to God.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. I get so excited. I just can't
[1:18:54] stand it when I see how perfect God is
[1:18:56] in this day. And we a humble bunch of
[1:18:58] people who are nobodies. And some of us
[1:19:00] barely graduated school. And some of us
[1:19:02] hardly can put two and two together.
[1:19:04] Amen. And brother Brandham was the same
[1:19:05] as like us. He wasn't one who figured
[1:19:07] anything out. He didn't have any
[1:19:08] technical ability or seminary training.
[1:19:11] But God so perfectly watched over his
[1:19:13] word. And he called a bunch of people
[1:19:14] who are nobodies and put something
[1:19:16] inside of us. When we see the word, we
[1:19:18] say that's nothing but the truth.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; And then God confirms it and confirms
[1:19:23] and confirms it. And for 60 years, he's
[1:19:25] been confirming it.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:19:29] Oh, praise God. What right do we have to
[1:19:32] question? What right do we have to
[1:19:34] question a God who's so perfect
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; or or contradict
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; or oppose
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; say God you know what you're doing
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; this is something else that I just
[1:19:51] learned.
[1:19:53] It was astounding to me.
[1:19:58] This is Lyndon B. Johnson and Lyndon B.
[1:20:01] Johnson was uh the vice president at the
[1:20:04] time. John F. Kennedy was assassinated.
[1:20:08] So about two a little over two hours
[1:20:11] after the assassination, he was
[1:20:12] inaugurated as the 36th president of the
[1:20:15] United States because he was the vice
[1:20:16] president. He automatically filled in.
[1:20:20] But I thought this was uncanny cuz
[1:20:22] brother Bam started talking about the
[1:20:24] churches as a woman in Jezebel.
[1:20:27] And as he's inaugurated, he's got a
[1:20:29] woman on each side.
[1:20:31] And he's being sworn in by a woman
[1:20:33] judge.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; This woman's name is is uh Judge Sarah
[1:20:39] Hughes.
[1:20:41] And it's a woman who's swearing him in.
[1:20:44] Because brother Brandon when he points
[1:20:46] to this transition, Jezebel coming in,
[1:20:48] he knows exactly what he's talking
[1:20:50] about. Like he may not know all the
[1:20:51] details, but he knows he's right.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; And so he's flanked by the wife of the
[1:20:57] former president. He's flanked by his
[1:20:58] wife. He's got two women on either side.
[1:21:00] He's got a woman in front of him and
[1:21:01] ministering the oath to office and she's
[1:21:03] swearing him in as the president in
[1:21:05] place of JFK. And Lyndon B. Johnson is a
[1:21:08] Protestant, not a Catholic.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; But this is what I didn't know. This is
[1:21:14] what astonished me. You remember when
[1:21:16] brother Tony Murray was here?
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; When brother Tony Murray was here, he's
[1:21:20] a pilot and his sons are pilots. So, I
[1:21:22] took him down to the Air Force Museum
[1:21:24] and we were going through the Air Force
[1:21:25] Museum and uh Brother Jeremy Sanders was
[1:21:28] with us and we were all down there
[1:21:29] having some fellowship and we went into
[1:21:32] we were looking at the presidential
[1:21:33] planes and we finally came to the last
[1:21:35] presidential plane, the newest one that
[1:21:37] they have. And it was actually the plane
[1:21:39] that was commissioned when JFK was
[1:21:41] president. And it was the plane that
[1:21:44] this took place on.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; So we get went in the plane and as we
[1:21:47] were going in, me and brother Tony
[1:21:49] Murray, we went in early, but Jeremy was
[1:21:50] still coming up the steps. And as he was
[1:21:52] coming up, there was a party coming that
[1:21:55] had a tour guide and it was a private
[1:21:57] tour guide. And the private tour guide
[1:21:58] was telling them about JFK being
[1:22:01] assassinated, about Lynden B. Johnson
[1:22:02] being sworn in on this plane. And he
[1:22:05] says an interesting bit of information.
[1:22:07] He says they didn't have a Bible on the
[1:22:09] plane.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; So you see his hand there on the book.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; That's not the Bible. He said they
[1:22:16] grabbed a book and it was a Catholic
[1:22:18] prayer book
[1:22:20] and he was sworn in on a Catholic prayer
[1:22:23] book.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; You can't make these things up, friends.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; That they they there was a total
[1:22:32] transition taking place and God made
[1:22:34] everything prove it. Amen. I went and
[1:22:36] looked it up and found out this is a a
[1:22:38] missile a missile in the Catholic book
[1:22:41] is a book of liturgy that they read to
[1:22:43] do the mass. It has the scripture
[1:22:44] readings and the prayers that they do
[1:22:46] for a mass. And they grab that book cuz
[1:22:48] it was leather bound. Amen. And they
[1:22:49] grabbed that book out of there and they
[1:22:51] don't even know how that book got on
[1:22:52] that plane. Amen. They they never seen
[1:22:54] it before. They think it was a gift
[1:22:55] given to John uh John F. Kennedy on his
[1:22:58] way to Dallas where he was shot because
[1:23:00] it still had the cellophane wrapper
[1:23:01] around it. They grabbed it and they
[1:23:03] brought it out. Why did somebody give
[1:23:04] him that gift at that time and that's
[1:23:06] the only book they had on the plane?
[1:23:08] Because God was showing even the
[1:23:10] Protestant was now attached to the
[1:23:11] Catholics.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Even now a Protestant president is being
[1:23:15] sworn in on a Catholic prayer book.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Have we have a perfect message? We have
[1:23:21] a perfect message, friends, exactly with
[1:23:23] the scripture, exactly with the times.
[1:23:25] And God made the circumstances in the
[1:23:27] natural life match those in the Bible.
[1:23:29] So there's no way of getting around it,
[1:23:31] friends.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:35] God is good.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; He says the true Easter Seal, he says
[1:23:42] just the same as they're going to do in
[1:23:44] the future and doing it right now,
[1:23:45] politics and religion. Ahab was a pretty
[1:23:48] good guy, but Jezebel, he was married to
[1:23:50] her. I don't say that President Kennedy
[1:23:52] isn't a good man, but he's married to
[1:23:54] that Jezebel system. It wasn't Ahab that
[1:23:58] did it. It was Jezebel behind the throne
[1:24:00] that controlled it. It's that Jezebel
[1:24:02] system that's going to do the damage
[1:24:04] here. He was to do cuz he's married to
[1:24:07] her. He was to receive it. He has to do
[1:24:09] it. He's married to her. Oh my peoples.
[1:24:12] Can't you see what the scriptur is
[1:24:13] doing? Can't you see we're standing here
[1:24:16] in the last days? Can you see it?
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, I see it, friends. Let's go back to
[1:24:23] our book and we'll finish this
[1:24:24] paragraph. I'm right in the middle of
[1:24:27] the paragraph on page seven. At such a
[1:24:29] time as this, that messenger of Malachi
[1:24:32] must come. Do you see it like you've
[1:24:34] never seen it before?
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Perfect timing.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Then in the latter reign will come on
[1:24:40] Mount Carmel showdown. Watch this
[1:24:42] carefully now to see it in the word.
[1:24:44] John was the forerunner of Malachi 3. We
[1:24:48] firmly believe that now, right?
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; He planted the former rain and was
[1:24:52] rejected by the organizations of his
[1:24:54] day. Jesus came and had a mount
[1:24:56] transfiguration showdown. The second
[1:24:58] forerunner of Christ will sew for the
[1:25:01] latter reign. Jesus will be the showdown
[1:25:03] between the denominations and creeds. He
[1:25:06] will come to back up his word and take
[1:25:08] his bride in the rapture. The first
[1:25:10] showdown was Mount Carmel. The second
[1:25:12] was Mount Transfiguration. And the third
[1:25:15] will be Mount Zion.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Does anybody know what Mount Zion
[1:25:19] represents?
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; The bride.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; This is the third showdown going on now.
[1:25:24] And the showdown is between those who
[1:25:26] hold to the true word and everything
[1:25:28] else.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; I want to read one more paragraph as we
[1:25:33] close out this evening. Let's jump to
[1:25:34] the next page. Paragraph 175-3. It ties
[1:25:38] together. So I want to read it. Now
[1:25:40] remember that Moses was born for a
[1:25:42] certain work. But he could not do that
[1:25:44] work until he'd receive the gifts which
[1:25:46] would enable him to do the work. He had
[1:25:48] to go out in the desert and wait there.
[1:25:50] God had an appointed time. There was to
[1:25:53] be a certain pharaoh on the throne. You
[1:25:56] know what that means now?
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, he had to wait till there was a
[1:26:00] certain president
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; in the presidential office.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And the people had to be crying for the
[1:26:06] bread of life before God could send him
[1:26:08] back. This is true for our day.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; What was prophecy is now history. Yeah.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; And here we stand post Malachi 4
[1:26:21] ministry.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; So we are here representing the Mount
[1:26:25] Zion showdown.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; The bride, the bride who stays true to
[1:26:30] her bridegroom where Christ dwells in
[1:26:32] her and stays true to the word opposed
[1:26:35] to everything else. And she won't back
[1:26:36] down on the word for she has thus sayeth
[1:26:39] the Lord.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Or she keeps still.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Cuz God sent a prophet with thus sayeth
[1:26:44] the Lord.
[1:26:46] God bless you. Let's all stand.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you love the word as much as
[1:26:51] I do. I sometimes I can't even sit
[1:26:53] still. I have to get up and move around
[1:26:55] because I say, "God, you're so perfect.
[1:26:57] And how in the world could you allow us
[1:27:00] to see these things?" Whole world full
[1:27:03] of intelligent people and geniuses and
[1:27:05] doctors and scholars and Bible this and
[1:27:08] Bible that. But here we are humble
[1:27:10] people. And that's more real to us than
[1:27:12] anything that we see, touch, say, taste,
[1:27:14] smell, or hear. Amen. This is the
[1:27:16] reality of our lives.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful that God, even
[1:27:23] before I understand hardly anything,
[1:27:25] before God revealed so much, before all
[1:27:28] of that, God had placed something in my
[1:27:30] heart, when I heard it, I couldn't get
[1:27:31] away from it. I I even though I wanted
[1:27:34] to run, I wanted to be wrong, I couldn't
[1:27:36] it couldn't be wrong inside of me.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; I couldn't get away. I couldn't shake
[1:27:40] it. I couldn't run fast enough, hard
[1:27:42] enough. I couldn't reason enough.
[1:27:44] Something inside kept pulsating as I
[1:27:46] heard that message. And something kept
[1:27:48] confirming it on the inside of me.
[1:27:50] Before I knew any of these things,
[1:27:52] before I could put these quotes together
[1:27:53] or knew the news or knew Ahab or knew
[1:27:55] anything, there was something inside
[1:27:57] pulsating to the word of God.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. It was like the woman at
[1:28:02] the well. The woman at the well didn't
[1:28:04] put it together. She didn't know
[1:28:05] everything that happened. She didn't
[1:28:07] know about the wise men. She didn't know
[1:28:08] about the star. She didn't know about
[1:28:10] the shepherds in Bethlehem. She didn't
[1:28:11] know all about that. But she came in
[1:28:13] contact with a portion of that word. And
[1:28:15] that word started to discern something
[1:28:16] in her life. And something inside of her
[1:28:18] started to pulsate and said, "When
[1:28:20] Messiah comes, he'll do that." And she
[1:28:21] didn't have all the pieces together.
[1:28:23] Friends, she didn't know about
[1:28:25] Bethlehem. She didn't know about Egypt.
[1:28:28] She didn't know about any of that. But
[1:28:29] she believed because there was a
[1:28:30] predestinated seed on the inside.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; And before we knew all of this, we
[1:28:35] believed. We believed when we heard this
[1:28:37] message. And then God comes along and
[1:28:38] confirms and confirms and confirms and
[1:28:41] plants our feet on such a firm
[1:28:42] foundation. There's no reason to back
[1:28:44] down, be ashamed, or ever apologize for
[1:28:46] believing in this prophet.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; There's no reason to apologize for
[1:28:51] believing in a God-scent vindicated
[1:28:53] prophet in the end time who restored
[1:28:55] back the truth of the original word.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; We have nothing to back down of. We have
[1:28:58] nothing to be ashamed of. And it's not a
[1:29:00] secret, friends.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Because God didn't make it a secret. God
[1:29:04] changed the order of the whole world and
[1:29:05] the whole United States to confirm his
[1:29:07] word.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; It'll never fade away. It'll never fail.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; He who orchestrated all these events is
[1:29:16] still orchestrating the events for us
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; in the Mount Zion showdown.
[1:29:22] God is so good.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; And I'm so happy that he allowed me to
[1:29:29] be here this day
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; and he put something in my heart to
[1:29:32] believe with. Cuz without it, it's
[1:29:34] impossible.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Listen, Pharisees knew Pharisees knew
[1:29:40] more about Jesus' life than the woman at
[1:29:42] the well.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; And they had more scripture memorized
[1:29:46] than she did.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; She may not have been able to read,
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; But they didn't believe.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; She did.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, the greatest gift is that soul down
[1:29:59] in there.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That gift of God, that part of
[1:30:02] himself that he's imparted into us,
[1:30:04] that's the greatest gift of all. That's
[1:30:06] everything, friends. That's what we
[1:30:08] believe with. That's our representation.
[1:30:10] That's a part of God. That's our
[1:30:12] sunship. That's everything to us. And
[1:30:15] that's what gives us the ability to
[1:30:17] believe.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, God is so good.
[1:30:21] Amen. Let's just bow our heads in
[1:30:22] thanking.
[1:30:25] Lord, I'm so thankful for your word.
[1:30:28] But every time I go over it again, Lord,
[1:30:32] it's scriptures we've read. It's
[1:30:34] comments we've made. It's things we've
[1:30:37] believed. But every time, Lord Jesus,
[1:30:40] I'm overwhelmed.
[1:30:42] I'm overwhelmed at your grace, your
[1:30:44] love, your perfection, your power.
[1:30:48] You're an unstoppable force.
[1:30:51] You can change the order of politics.
[1:30:53] You can change everything
[1:30:56] to match your word.
[1:30:59] Lord, I'm so thankful, Lord, that you've
[1:31:02] given us a heart to believe with.
[1:31:06] God, I pray that you would help us now,
[1:31:08] Lord, as we're energized by these
[1:31:11] revelations, Lord. May we be willing
[1:31:14] under this energy in this atmosphere,
[1:31:16] may we be willing to take all the
[1:31:18] distractions that are distracting us and
[1:31:21] push them to the side.
[1:31:24] God, while our hearts are burning with
[1:31:26] zeal for the truth of your word, while
[1:31:28] we're rejoicing in the p your power to
[1:31:31] confirm your word, God, may we
[1:31:33] reconsecrate ourselves under this
[1:31:35] atmosphere
[1:31:37] because Lord, I really don't want
[1:31:39] anything other than this,
[1:31:42] Lord. And I'm ashamed to say there's
[1:31:43] things that take my time, that take my
[1:31:45] attention. They're distractions to me,
[1:31:48] entertainments and responsibilities. And
[1:31:50] we know part of that's life, but Lord, I
[1:31:53] really don't want it. Lord, I don't want
[1:31:56] it. What I want is this and more of this
[1:31:58] and all of this. I want your word and
[1:32:01] all of your word and only your word.
[1:32:04] Your revealed word. You are my
[1:32:06] bridegroom. You are my lover. You're
[1:32:07] making love to me by revealing your word
[1:32:09] to me. And I'm feeling it in my soul.
[1:32:12] I'm feeling your love and the
[1:32:14] enthusiasm, the excitement, Lord, for
[1:32:16] the love that we have for one another as
[1:32:18] you reveal yourself, Lord. It energizes
[1:32:21] me. It excites me, Lord. It enthuses me.
[1:32:24] It makes me feel loved and secure and
[1:32:26] content
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; because you are the bridegroom, the
[1:32:29] revealed word. God, as you make love to
[1:32:32] us, let us make love back to you, Lord,
[1:32:33] and be enthused and excited about only
[1:32:36] this
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; and nothing else. God, you've been so
[1:32:40] good to us, so merciful. We love you.
[1:32:43] Have your way, Lord, with your people.
[1:32:45] As we go from here, may we not go the
[1:32:48] same way we entered in, but may we go
[1:32:49] out, Lord, with a joy, with an
[1:32:52] everessence of joy, knowing that all
[1:32:54] things work together for good,
[1:32:56] regardless of the circumstances.
[1:32:58] Nothing's going to stop your prophecy.
[1:33:01] And God, may we have confidence in you
[1:33:03] and your word and what you've done. May
[1:33:05] we walk with joy and confidence facing
[1:33:07] the challenges of the day, the
[1:33:09] challenges of life with a secret in our
[1:33:12] heart knowing nothing will stop this
[1:33:15] word that's inside of me from
[1:33:17] manifesting.
[1:33:19] Father, we give it all to you. We
[1:33:20] surrender to you. Have your way with
[1:33:23] your people as you draw us closer and
[1:33:25] closer. We ask your blessings over this
[1:33:28] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tell you what, friends, it's good
[1:33:34] to be home.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Vacation's nice, but this atmosphere is
[1:33:39] glory.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; It's the best. It's the excitement,
[1:33:43] enthusiasm for the revealed word of God.
[1:33:46] Amen. This is what does my heart good to
[1:33:48] talk about his word. Amen. Let's sing
[1:33:51] together.
[1:33:53] We're living in the evening time. The
[1:33:58] race is almost through,
[1:34:02] but God has chosen you and me. There's
