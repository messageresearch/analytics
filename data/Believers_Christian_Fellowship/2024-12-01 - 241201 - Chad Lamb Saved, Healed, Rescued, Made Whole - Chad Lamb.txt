communion and feet washing this afternoon so Lord willing will come back this afternoon for that amen amen praise God appreciated the special today thank you very much that was wonderful quite a blessing and I'm still feasting on the word from Wednesday night we want to thank our brother Jim for amen you talk about getting out of the way the brother just yielded himself and God took over and we appreciated appreciated the word I've I've been thinking on it quite a bit and so while he was preaching I jotted down a couple notes and uh on my paper and that's the the thoughts that I'm going to bring today so we just pray that the Lord has his way let's read a Ephesians chapter 2 and let's go to verse 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God Amen God bless you as you take your seats praise the Lord amen I just want to thank everybody who was able to make it down for the visitation for the bird family and all that you were able to do for them it's quite a blessing to see several of you down there and I know it's been a hard time this holiday for some in our midst uh having losses but we just pray that God will comfort and bless all of them amen as we as we look into this word I wanted to take the word here saved for by grace are you saved through faith and that un of yourselves is the gift of God and I wanted to pull out the word saved and take a look at it I mentioned this I don't know several months ago when I was preaching we talked about this but this word saved is a Greek word and the Greek word is soo s o Zoo Soo and um and I just wanted to minister on it it's something that if we've been if you've been in Christian circles all of your life or part of your life you hear saved you know we're saved we've been saved are they saved and we use this term over and over and over again but I wanted to look through the Bible and I just wanted to take a look and do a maybe a little bit of a word study on it because it became amazing to me the more I looked at it cuz I really want to understand it we realize that we live in the day and age where the Prophet has come and showed us that we've had traditional understanding of things and maybe the traditional understanding wasn't right amen that right that that man added his own interpretation or own understanding and maybe even so our own way of believing in what salvation is what does it mean to be saved or what is saved and and there's very much a traditional uh Church understanding of that but there's a Biblical teaching amen and we want to look through the Bible so keep your Bibles hand I want to read quite a few scriptures amen this word Soo is used in the New Testament 111 times and we won't read all of them today but I went through all of them just to try to get a picture of what God is showing us and and when you get to the definition uh when you get to the definition of the word in the concordance it says to save keep safe and sound to rescue from danger or destruction it also is to save one from injury or Peril to save a suffering one from perishing one's suffering from disease to make well to heal restore to health to preserve one who is in danger of Destruction to save or rescue so this is the word Soo this is what it means to save and it's not just limited to Salvation from Eternal damnation that's also part of it but it's much more encompassing than that so for a title I just want to pull out of there some of of the words uh out of the definition and I want to preach on Saved healed rescued made whole saved healed rescued made whole amen maybe we can get a a full picture of what God has done for us that's right this way let's go to Matthew 18 together Matthew 18 verse 11 and in no way am I am I preaching a conclusive message and all that this word means and I don't know we we'll learn more as time goes on God is constantly opening up more and more Revelation but I just want to share the things that have been opening up for me so we found in Ephesians 2:8 we just read for Your Grace by grace are you saved so we know our Salvation is by Grace God's grace but it's through faith and that not of yourselves is the gift of God that's important I want you to remember that now we know it so well so you will I know you'll remember it but remember it as a foundation for what we're talking about for by grace are you saved amen through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of God so this salvation is is not is not based on what we do it's based on what God has done but what God has done amen brings a response out of us and the response also is God through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of of God and that's what we're going to see as we go on now let's look at Matthew 1811 for the son of man has come to save that which was lost the son of man has come to save this is the same word save that which was lost this word lost is that which is in Peril or destroyed or or or uh uh damaged amen not just something that that's not found but this is something that's lost that's in Peril of destruction he came to save that which was going to be destroyed amen and that was Us by the grace of God he came let's go back to Matthew 9 now we're going to turn to a lot of the scriptures here in the New Testament and the gospels especially but I've tried to couple them together so we can just flip a few pages at a time and stay in the same general area in the Bible but I really wanted to go through the scriptures and take a look at this now remember our word saved here uh that we just looked at in these two scriptures is the Greek word Soo and so when I come to this word in the Bible it'll be translated differently we're going to read it and it won't say saved but when we get to it I'll tell you Soo so you know this is the same Greek word as the word saved in Ephesians 2 and saved here in Matthew so let's look here at uh uh Matthew 9:19 and Jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciples and behold a woman a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood 12 years came behind him and touched the him of His Garment for she said within herself if I may but touch His Garment I shall be made whole Soo saved amen amen amen it's beautiful but Jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good Comfort thy faith ha made thee whole Soo and the woman was made whole Soo from that hour amen amen so the woman was in destruction amen she was in a a a situation where she had a blood issue for 12 years amen and she amen by her faith in Jesus Christ amen which was the present tense manifestation of of God Amen when she said within herself amen if I can but touch the him of His Garment this is a personal revelation to her she knew somehow within herself no priest told her she didn't read it in the book but within she had a revelation if I can touch him the Hemm of His Garment I'll be made every bit whole I will be saved amen saved from my condition I'll be restored back to health why because I believe that there's something about him that if I can touch him amen I can be made whole and Jesus turned around and said daughter be of good Comfort now listen to the words thy faith ha made thee whole he says thy faith has made thee whole oh it's so good friends thy faith listen where did she get the faith to believe it was a revelation that came to her amen the faith was a gift from God but it was found in her yeah so Jesus looks at her and says thy faith not what you heard somebody else say not what somebody taught you not what you're repeating out of a book not what you consciously are aware of and can reverberate but thy faith the faith that is locked inside of you has saved you what kind of Faith was that amen I believe according to Ephesians 2:8 that it was a gift of God it was the faith as we heard Wednesday night it was the faith that God gives or the faith of God or The Faith from God but God attributes that this is something that was in you so he calls it your faith even though we know it's God's faith amen it takes the faith that God gives to believe this way it's God's faith but it's in her yeah remember how brother B taught us amen the woman at the well the woman at the well amen she was a seed brother B said she was a thought that fell from the mind of God she was trapped in a lost condition in destruction amen her life was a a a wreck amen but but here comes Jesus because he had to go by Samaria because he wanted to save that which was lost he wanted to heal that which was in destruction he wanted to to make her whole and rescue her from her situation so he come by her way and started a conversation with her amen now listen Jesus never just came and plucked her up and rescued her what he did was present himself to her and when she had something within her to believe him amen she was saved amen this is so good they're so good friends he comes there she was a thought that fell from the mind of God Amen brother B said she had representation in heaven brother B also said she had something to believe with amen and the difference between her and the Pharisees they could see the same Jesus they could hear some of the same statements they could see the same discernment amen but there was she was a thought that fell from the mind of God she had representation in heaven and she had something in her to believe with she had the faith that was a gift of God and when she was presented with the Jesus of her day there was something in her that could believe hey I know when Messiah cometh he'll do these things when the Pharisees were saying be elub she was saying this is the Messiah you know what she was saved healed amen let's go to the Book of Mark let's go to Mark chapter 5 Mark chapter 5 and let's go to verse 21 and when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side which much people gathered unto him and he was nigh unto the sea and behold there came one of the rulers of the synagogue gyrus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lith at the point of death I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live and Jes Jesus went unto him and much people followed him and thronged him so I want to read read verse 23 again and Bes saw him greatly saying my little layeth at the point of death I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed Soo same word is saved amen so we understand what salvation is it's more listen to me it's more than just a traditional idea if I fold my hands a certain way and I say a certain thing and I claim to believe in something that happened 2,000 years ago then all of a sudden someday I'll be okay it's more than that friends it's an absolute rescue it's a it's a making whole it's a healing it's a delivering it's something that's going on right now and something that will continue to go on into the future it's more than just something happened and something will happen and if I follow this formula I'll be part of it it's not a formula it's not a certain prayer it's not a church tradition it's not a historical thing it's a present tense there's a Salvation available because there's a Christ available today amen and what's he trying to do he's trying to restore he's trying to make whole he's trying to heal he's trying to save amen let's go to Mark 6 verse 56 6 and 56 Mark 6:56 and whether soever he entered into the villages or cities or country they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of His Garment and as many as touched him were made whole Soo amen amen amen I believe we can still touch him amen and be made whole Mark chapter 10 let's turn over to Mark chapter 10 verse 51 and 52 Mark chapter 10 verse 51 this says when they uh bring blind bmus to Jes Jesus 51 uh he says and Jesus answered and said unto him what wil thou that I shall do unto thee the blind man said unto him Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith ha made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way thy faith ha made thee whole Soo thy faith save thee amen and I love what Jesus says again go th way thy faith amen listen we we know in all of these instances that Jesus had plenty of Faith but it was all it was not based on Jesus's faith it was based on the faith that was found in those that were reaching out to him and calling out to him amen and so Jesus had plenty of faith when he went to his hometown when he went back to capernium he had plenty of Faith but he said there he could do not many miracles because of their unbelief so he couldn't heal them and deliver them and save them because they didn't believe amen and so he says Thy Thy faith has saved saved thee made thee whole let's go to Mark 15 now I'm just grabbing a sampling of some of these things Mark 15 verse 29 Mark 15 and 29 this is at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ Christ and they that passed by railed on him waging their heads saying oh that thou uh oh a ah thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself save Soo thyself and come down from the cross likewise also the chief priest mock said among themselves with the scribes he saved Soo others himself he cannot save Soo so this is the same same word and it means this is actually a saving from destruction now of saving from death but it's the same word with the same meaning let's go to ma Mark 16 sorry Mark 16:5 now and he said unto them go you into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved Soo and he that believeth not shall be damned so it's look at it again he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not so here once again they have to believe if they don't believe they won't be saved rescued made whole restored it won't be it's based off faith and that is a gift of God let's go to Luke Chapter 7 let's go to Luke chapter 7 yeah let's go to verse 44 Luke 7: 44 and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon seest thou this woman I entered into thine house thou gavest me no water from my feet but sheath washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou D not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins and he said to the woman thy faith has saved thee go in peace amen thy faith had she he looked right at her and said thy faith yeah but we know according to Ephesians 2:8 that it's the faith of God we know that it's the gift of God the gift of God to be able to believe that's why this little Harlot this prostitute woman could run in there to Simon's house to a place where she was not welcome amen amongst company where she was not desired but she could weave her way in and make her way and pour out amen this fragrance and ointment and wash his feet amen because she had something to believe with she must have been one of them other thoughts that fell from the mind of God it was here on Earth and and now amen she had something to believe with because she had representation in heaven and when she came in contact with the living word for her day there was something in her that could recognize amen and and I don't even know what she recognized I don't know I mean I don't know how full the Revelation was all that she knew was something stirred her ha and she had to get to him and she couldn't leave him in that condition and there was something stirring in her that wasn't stirring in Simon wasn't stirring in all the guests in that house that day but it was stirring in that little woman amen and that was something that had to come from God Amen it wasn't something uh that was just human down through the the the human sphere it was a gift of God to believe that this man sitting right here amen was God and worthy to be worshiped and worthy to give your die for and worthy to give up all your money for and worthy to Bear reproach for and worthy to take the dirt off his feet onto your own hair and worthy to kiss and worthy to be shamed and mocked what was that that was more than human friend that was something that come from God but because it abided in her amen it wasn't somebody said go wash his feet it was something within her Jesus looked at her and said thy faith yeah thy faith has saved thee Soo thy faith hath saved thee go in peace man that woman was restored that woman was saved by what by her faith a amen it was such a difference between her like we said and Simon because Simon didn't have anything to believe with Simon's the one who should have believed Simon had the education he had the teach teaching he had the connections he knew what was going on he knew what the Miracles were he had had heard about the signs he had caught the he was right in the mix of all of it amen and he had the education he had access to the Old Testament prophecies he could read and he was educated and he's the one who should have known amen but it wasn't in him to know it was in her to know and she was saved because there was something in her that could believe and what was it that she could believe she could believe something that Simon and the Pharisees and the religious leaders couldn't believe because they could believe all that God had done right that's it amen they could believe in Moses and The Parting of the Red Sea and the Deliverance out of Egypt and they could believe in the prophet and they could believe in Jeremiah they could believe in the dispersion and they could believe in the regathering they could believe in everything that God done but what could could she believe what saved her amen she was saved because she could believe the word that was manifest right before her eyes and that's what nobody else could recognize but her and zakus and the disciples and fishermen and tax collectors and prostitutes and all of them they had something within them that could recognize and when they could recognize this is God Amen they were saved healed restored rescued amen delivered all of that why because they could believe in a present tense God they were amongst people who believed and read and were educated and they knew the historical God but they didn't know the I am God they knew that I am when he was and they said that was God that was the I am then when I am comes in flesh they don't recognize him as God they call him be elub he never said Simon you're saved right because you believe everything that I did right and you believe all the Torah yeah see the gospel is the good news and it's always the current good news amen and it's always been hard to believe right right to the intellectual mind the day listen the the a good portion of the world believes that there was a man named Jesus Christ who was the son of God who died for the sins of the world a good portion billions I think believe that and confess that and have no problem believing that's true but the day he was here that was the hardest thing in the world to believe that only a tiny Remnant believed it in the day that it was being made manifest and only those that had representation in heaven were able to believe it amen brother brandham said the Pharisees did not have representation in heaven she did so it doesn't take representation in heaven to believe the historical gospel amen that's right it takes representation in heaven in being a thought of God to believe the present tense gospel and that's the way it's all always been through the Bible always I say this over and over and over and over and over and over but Salvation has never changed from Genesis to Revelation salvation from day one all the way through has always been based on believing the word for your day always in every generation in every cycle of the Bible you go back and read it salvation is always based on believing the word when it's presented to you yeah amen amen and and it's always been hard to believe it was hard to believe that a farmer named Noah was given the rescue plan for the whole world it's hard to believe a common man amen was called to be a prophet of God and God spoke to him and told him and things were going to happen that had never happened he said there's going to be rain there's going to be a delug there's going to be a flood and they had never known rain they had never felt raindrops fall on their skin Amen in fact brother R tells us in their scientific achievement in their Advanced civilization they could check and they could find no moisture no nothing amen because they didn't know amen that they were going to destroy themselves with an atomic bomb and knock the Earth off its axis and create condensation but God knew it amen and God could tell an unlikely individual yeah who just happened to have something in them that would [Music] believe and what he believed became his salvation yeah amen his faith is what saved him what saved Noah his faith how because his faith went into action and he built the boat according to what God Said and by faith Noah was saved oh praise God this is the way it's always been it's always been something within the children of God that when God MO moves they recognize it they recognize it with something more than int intelligence they recognize it with more than something than intellect they recognize it not because somebody told them this is it they recognize it because they believe it there's something in them to believe amen and so and that faith that Faith becomes their salvation which is their healing yes which is their rescue which is their restoration which makes them whole again amen oh my goodness sometimes I don't even know how to preach I don't even want to preach you know what I'd like to do sit down with a cup of coffee and let's just talk you know because you miss so much and you can't incorporate everything there's so much I want to say and I don't want to I don't want to say things too strong this way I don't want to say to I just want to tell you what's in my heart what I see in the scriptures and where we're at in our day amen because God is still saving today but he's saving by the same means he's always saved he's saving by faith in the I am the present tense God the god who's fulfilling his word today and when he fulfills his word that's God because God's not separate than his word so when you see the Fulfillment of the word that's God to recognize it is to see God which is Christ because Christ is the word and when the word comes into manifestation that's Christ to reject that is to reject Christ to receive that is to receive Christ and that's the way it's always been this is not anything new this is the way the just go back and read the Bible it's always been this way but I want to take a a look at Luke for just a minute we're in Luke let's go to Luke 4 Luke chapter 4 4 verse 16 Luke 4 and16 and before I read this don't read it look up with me I want to make a disclaimer because I know when we have a group of people our minds are always wondering different spots when I talk about being saved in our day I'm talking about the elect predestinated seed amen we know good and well that there's going to be multitudes that'll be saved but that Sal will be meet out at the white Throne judgment and it'll be based on what they did with the word and when they were presented to it but they're not the ones with the faith of God to believe in the present tense truth amen all right we understand that I hope we all understand that right yes sir will they be saved absolutely brother B said they will be saved they'll be saved they're saved potentially now but they'll be saved amen as long as their names remain on the uh Lamb's Book of Life amen at the white Throne judgment they'll they'll be saved and they'll ENT enter into life not previously having had it cuz they were never born again right but when I'm talking salvation I'm not talking about those that are rescued in a future judgment I'm talking about a Salvation that causes you to bypass the judgment and never come into condemnation I'm talking about how the elect of God are saved in every generation and they're always saved by believing the present tense I am truth of God so don't think that I'm saying nobody else will ever make it there's mult multitudes that are going to be entering into to the new heavens and new earth but they're going to be entering in on a different basis than what you and I are are bypassing the judgment and coming to the Millennium for I hope that's clear and if we need to clear it up we can clear it up we got all kinds of quotes and I got them here on the notes but I don't want to take the time to go into all of that but I just want to stay focused on this I'm talking about the salvation of the elect Luke 4:16 and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable youth ear of the Lord all of that is salvation going to read it again to heal the brokenhearted salvation is to heal to preach Deliverance to the captives it's to rescue and deliver that's also Soo recovery of sight to the blind that's healing to set at Liberty them that are bro what was he come to do the son of man came to save that which was losten he come to heal the brokenhearted he did that for the woman at the well he come to set at Liberty those that were bound he did that for the woman who washed his feet he come to heal the brokenhearted he did that he did all of these things why because those who had Faith to believe him were saved amen there were multitudes who who who remained with a broken heart blind and bound and captive yeah right so he came he came to heal the brokenhearted he came to preach the poor the the gospel to the poor to heal the brokenhearted to to bind up those who were bruised and and set at Liberty those that were captive to Open the Eyes of the blind he came to do all of that but he could only do that for the people who could believe him and those who believe him all got the benefit of his coming they were healed they were restored they were rescued their broken heart was mended amen because that's part of the word and part of the Salvation and don't forget that God is still preaching the word and if he's still preaching the word he's still binding up broken hearts he's still healing those that that are sick he's still healing those that are captive amen praise God God is still here to save he's saving but saving also means to keep saved to keep what delivered to keep rescued to keep healed amen you know we we come back to service time and time and time again we say well we're already saved amen I don't know about you but I'm still getting saved I'm still being healed I'm still being restored I'm still being rescued I'm still being bound up I'm still being set free amen I come through life with all kinds of things and all kinds of baggage and all kinds of my own thinking and things I hurt people hurt me things I've hurt myself with amen but it's the preaching of this present tense truth that is still unlocking and freeing and setting us free it's still saving us friends I don't look at Salvation in the old traditional way as I said a sinner's prayer one day at an altar and I was saved oh praise God I think we're going to see in the scriptures that that doesn't even hold up anymore because s salvation was based on faith amen it's not what I believe then it's what I believe now and continue to believe and keep walking in the truth as he unveils the truth and as I keep walking in the truth as he unveils the truth it'll keep healing and restoring and delivering and setting me [Music] free that's saved friends we're we're saved we're being saved yeah amen amen amen that's why I love to come to hear the preaching of the word that's why I love to hear the prophet's voice amen why because that presentant truth is still unlocking the things that are locked inside of me it's still freeing the things that have me bound it's still setting my mind free from the captiv Captivity of wrong thinking amen wasn't something that just happened once long ago that's a traditional way of talking about it's not even evil to talk about it that way I'm not I'm not saying we should change all of our language but there's a traditional idea I said a sinner's prayer one day and I'm saved and I'm saved forever but listen that's only for the elect and the elect will keep walking in truth amen we're going to read we're going to read some scriptures while we're in Luke I want to read one more in Luke chapter 8 Luke 8:1 Luke 811 reads now the parable is this the seed is the word of God those by the wayside are they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of the take the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved amen Soo if that word in their heart if they believe believe that word they would be saved yeah they would be healed delivered rescued made whole free from destruction let's go to Matthew 10 now Matthew 10 and verse ver 22 and you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved I hope you catch that he that endureth to the end shall be saved not the person who said a prayer one time that was in the Baptist order of repeat after me and say this and now you're saved right amen that's a church tradition yeah but but he that endureth to the end shall be saved I know sometimes that rakes against our traditional understanding but it's the scriptures amen let's turn to Jude chapter 1 Jude verse 5 I will therefore put you in remembrance though you you once knew this how that the Lord having saved Soo the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believe not they were saved he saved them out of Egypt he rescued them he deliver delivered them out of bondage is that true amen and when they saw all the Miracles and they saw uh Egypt destroyed and they saw the plagues fall they were able to believe they believed Moses they believed that Moses was sent by God and we know this was quite a struggle for them for when Moses first came things got difficult and they didn't believe Moses and they wanted to reject Moses but God gave Moses two signs and so there was this back and forth this Warfare but then when the plagues began to continue on and they saw more and more destruction coming uh to Egypt then they began to believe more and more and then finally uh uh Moses brought them the message of the Passover amen and those those who believed Moses and followed his instruction were saved they were saved from the Death Angel The Death Angel passed when it saw the blood amen they were saved from Egypt they were saved from destruction they were saved from the bondage of slavery but that wasn't the end of God's salvation because salvation is more amen than just rescuing from bondage God wanted to make them whole and restore them he wanted to bring them to the Fulfillment of the promise he wanted to save them from bondage but he wanted to make them whole in their own land restored under the promise the promise that was given to Abraham that was also part of salvation Salvation wasn't just rescue from Egypt salvation to heal to restore to make whole was also to place them in the promised land according to his work Amen to to be their God to bring them into the land Amen to give them peace and safety in a land that flows with milk and honey according to the promise that he gave to Abraham that was also salvation because that was a restoration back to the promise so they were saved but they didn't go on in Salvation why where did they hang up they disbelieved because salvation is is based on faith and when you stop believing you stop being healed you stop being restored you sto being rescued you sto being delivered you were delivered they were no longer in Egypt but they couldn't go all the way to the promise they were hung up somewhere in the process of salvation but never to be able to move on to the fullness of their Redemption he redeemed them out of the land but he redeemed them to bring them into his land yeah and give them his land and be their God and to be a chosen Nation unto him so he had saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not they came out singing shouting dancing and they come to the Red Sea another obstacle and in the obstacle they begin to murmur and complain and and accuse Moses and God delivered them again they got to the other side of the Red Sea and guess what they did took the tambourines and sang and danced all over again this is amazing friends see there's a difference between the elect and and those that are in the church just say it that way amen because then they they come on and you know every stop along the way there was another battle when things got difficult when they couldn't see Deliverance when they couldn't understand when it looked like they were having hardship or difficulty they didn't understand any of that and so they they began to murmur and complain and accuse Moses and they were constant it was constantly back and forth then God would deliver then they would rejoice and then they would get into another obstacle and they would murmur and complain and then God would deliver then they would rejoice and Fin fin they came to the obstacle that was insurmountable they had to go in and take the land that was full of Giants and full of wall cities people with chariots and armor and horses and armies and all of a sudden they come to the Fulfillment of the promise they came to their fullness of their salvation to the promise the reason they were delivered was to take the land to fulfill the promise he made to Abraham to be Abraham's seed in God's land and they come to the actual border of the very promise itself and when they came to that they looked across and they sent spies who came back with an evil report and say the land surely filled with milk and honey all that Moses told us is true but listen friends there's no way that we can do this they're walled cities they're Mighty Men they're huge of stature they have all this armor they have everything we can't do it we can't go amen and what did they do they disbelieved the word they had believed the word yeah they believed Moses Moes was a prophet they believe Moses was sin of God they believe God rescued them out of Egypt they belied that it was the time for the Fulfillment of the promise they belied they were being redeemed they believed they belied they belied but they came to a place where they could no longer believe yeah but there was two who could am there was two who could believe and know who were those those were the predestinated elected seat of God those were the children of God guess what they were saved when everybody else disbelieved then wandered 40 years in the wilderness and were destroyed because of unbelief amen guess who was saved by faith it was it was Caleb and Joshua they were still alive after everybody else had died what preserved their life they were saved amen because they had Faith to believe in a present tense truth when they come to the wall then when they come and saw the wall said listen you're not talking to people who heard the report they went and saw the Giants they saw the cities they saw what the 10 spies saw and they saw how impossible it was but they didn't look at the city they didn't look at the Giants they didn't look at the spears they looked at the promise in God's word and something inside of them could say hey they're but bread for us it wasn't logical it wasn't intelligent amen it was different than what everybody else in the camp was saying yeah Hallelujah there was a seat inside they couldn't explain it Caleb went running amongst them and said don't do it listen we can do it he had faith and his faith is what saved him saved him for 40 years of Destruction in the wilderness kept him safe kept him whole kept him strong yeah till 40 years later when he was 80 years old he come to Joshua and said give me my Mountain amen I'm as strong this day as the day when I spied out the land 40 years ago strong to go out and strong to come in amen what had preserved him was Faith what had saved him was Faith what made him whole and kept him whole was his faith he still had it 40 years later he was eager to go run the Giants off of his Mountain 40 years later later because he believed the word of God he could believe it it was his salvation but all those who couldn't believe it they died oh praise God let's go to Second Timothy chapter 4 we're still talking about this word Soo it's a big word I mean it's a little word s o Zoo but it's a big word it's big for us I hope our idea of being saved I hope it changes second Timothy 4:18 and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and shall preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom to whom be glory forever and ever amen the word Soo is in this sentence it's the word preserve and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me he will save me unto his Heavenly Kingdom to be glory forever and ever that means to Paul to the Apostle Paul salvation wasn't something that took place on the road to Damascus only salvation was something that was going to carry him all the way through that was going to preserve or save him unto the kingdom of the Lord amen I'd like to just say my salvation wasn't something that happened years ago my salvation is going on now amen he's preserving me now God the soo for me now you know who wasn't preserved unto the Heavenly Kingdom Deus who left Paul he forsook the word for what having loved this present world and brother Benham told us when he preached on Deus he told us Deus didn't go into the world he didn't go to nightclubs went on being a Christian he just couldn't bear the reproach of Paul who was the church age messenger the word for his day so he forsook the word and stayed in church but Paul who stayed with the word was preserved unto the Heavenly Kingdom he was saved and kept saved and had the promise of continually being saved unto the kingdom and the Heavenly Kingdom let's go to John chapter 10 back to the Gospel of John John chapter 10 I like to read verse 7 then said Jesus unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and he shall go in and out and find pasture so Jesus is the door of Salvation it's found in him he is the door he is the gate let's go to Acts chapter 2 Acts chapter 2 and verse 21 acts chap 2 verse 21 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved this is an interesting verse it says whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved this is a promise of salvation for all those who call on the name of the Lord so is everybody who confesses the name Jesus Christ saved it's an interesting scripture lovely brother venam gives us an answer to this first I want to read one other scripture while we're here go to verse 46 verse 46 and they continuing daily with one Accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to the house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved so who added to the church the Lord how did he add them who did he add such as should be saved they were ordained unto this they were the predestinated they should be saved and they were able to believe so I want to go uh to Acts chapter 4 now remember who whosoever calls on the name of the Lord should be saved acts chap 4 verse 8 acts 4:8 said then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent Man by what means he is made whole be it of known unto you and all to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ Christ of Nazareth whom ye crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him do this man stand here before you whole this is the stone which was set at knot of the builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved so salvation is in the name of Jesus Christ sir that right and so if if salvation is in the name of Jesus Christ then everybody who in prayer confesses the name of Jesus Christ and says Jesus Christ was the son of God who died long ago then they're all saved it's a good question but brother brandom says in 1965 God's only provided place of worship he said and the name is in the word because he is the word I want you to notice that every time that God brought a new revelation to his children he changed his title amen he gave them revelation of himself and he would come from a different title Jehovah Gyra Jehovah siku Jehovah nii he always had another way of expressing himself so that he would be to them a present tense God and they would have a new name y amen we know it wasn't the name the name of God is Jesus Christ but a new name a new title a new way in which to address God and the attribute that was being expressed in that day because God was always expressing himself more and more to his children and wanted to know him in his new name and brother R said and the name is the is in the word because he is the word I I hope you catch that and his name is in the word so his name is not separated from the word for he is the word I hope you're catching this you can say a name and the name that we say is actually English name it's a pronunciation that wasn't the pronunciation that was called over him when he was a young boy running around Mary never said Jesus the way we say it yeah are you clear amen so it's not the pronunciation of the name CU whatever country you're in you'll say it differently yeah but the name is in the word because he is the word so his name is attached to the word and you can't disattach it from the word and call his name because if you separate it from the word you no longer have the right identification for the name you name amen that's right you're calling a name but it's not the identity of the person you're calling for for the identity is attached to the word to the scriptures to the Bible to the word made manifest now listen to what he says next the name is in the word because he is the word amen is that right what is he then the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God Amen the word interpreted what do we have today we have the word interpreted amen by a prophet when we call the name Jesus Christ we know him and his identification today who he is present tense Jesus Christ not a historical Jesus not what he was but who he is now amen I said this before you can you can you can call up one of my friends from high school and you can call them and talk to them and say hey do you know Chad Lamb they say oh yeah I know Chad Lam I I know him really well we went to school for high school for two three years together but if I haven't spoke to them for how long is it now like I do some math 29 30 years if I haven't spoke to them in 30 years they can claim that me they know me they can have my name and they can call my name all they want but they don't know me at all they don't know me as a husband they don't know me as a father they don't know they don't know who I am as a and they don't know me they know who I was and they have my name but they don't have my name cuz my name is attached to my person to who I actually am present tense that's my name not who I was but who I am so the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name no wonder flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you who I am and Upon This Rock I'll build my place of worship and the gates of hell can't shake it down amen oh Living Church of God stand in firm foundation on Jesus Christ alone you can sing the song but if you're not on Christ the word you're on teetering faltering sand but Upon This Rock Christ my word so what did what was it that Peter was given by the father he was given a revelation of who Jesus Christ is present tense amen amen so what is the Revelation the church is based on who Jesus Christ is present tense that's his name how could we call on the name of Jesus Christ and believing he's the second God in a trinity of gods is that Jesus Christ is that who he is is he a second God and a trinity of God there was a day that Jesus Christ covered for that his blood was atoning for that ignorance because that wasn't revealed yet but it's been revealed in this end time and to know him is to know his person who he is who he's revealed himself to be that's right praise God Psalms 10719 remember the the hardest scriptures to believe has always been the ones that are manifest in your day all through the Bible the hardest scriptures the hardest scriptures to believe this is what brother B said over and over man will always tell you what God's done and always point you to what he will do but ignoring what he's doing today am amen but look at Psalms 107:19 uh yeah then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distress he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions how does God save us he sends his word how does he save us how does he heal us from all our destructions he sends his word how did God save us in this end time he sent the message it's our salvation it's our Redemption it's our healing it's our restoration it's everything that Soo is in the Bible this message is all of that to us brother bam said in 1957 and a message and then Jesus came your presence is here to do the greatest healing to heal the sinick soul to heal the weary to bring those in who are indifferent those those people who join church and doesn't know you by the spirit they've never been born again they don't know what it means to have peace the perfect peace that passes understanding what does that his presence his presence present tense is here to do the greatest healing his word is here how do you know he's here his word is made manifest today he's here to heal the sin sick Soul how how did the soul get sick amen by leaving the word by rejecting the truth by moving away from the word so how is he going to heal the sin sick Soul by bringing his word and modern events made clear by prophecy so now and with patience we have to wait for this for the prophecies that's promised every one of them must be fulfilled in its age for it is for it tells us the author has before done this and we wait to see him do it again what a time it is that we're living in something like a calendar you look at a calendar to find out what day of the year you're living in and you look at God's Bible to see what age we're living in we are not living in the Methodist age the Baptist age we're living in the bride age the calling now he's going to describe what it is yes the calling bringing back to God through a channel that he promised to bring it back in what is the bright age it's bringing the church the elect back to God through a channel that he promised to bring in what was the channel through the prophetic word the prophetic word is the channel amen and faith in that channel brings us back to what what is the bride age what is the message what is God trying to do God is presenting himself Amen to his bride he's unveiling himself he's opening the the word he's revealing who he really is so that we would know who Jesus Christ really is present tense not what the nominations made him not what he was not not what he was in the previous generation but what he is today the message came to peel back all the misunder understanding to present Christ to a bride and to present a bride to Christ to what to heal to restore to save amen the bride AG is to bring back through a channel that he promised let's turn together to Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians 4 and 17 Ephesians 4 and 7 this I say therefore and testifying the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darken being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart listen he's trying to trying to get the people to see you were blind don't walk as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind being having their understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart listen friends this is the condition you and I were born in this is how we came we came ignorant we came blind and alienated from the life of God that's how we were what did we need we needed saved we needed our blindness removed we needed to be restored back to God Amen we needed our ignorance removed that's the condition we were in brother Brandon preaches a message in 1964 called spiritual Amnesia and he says now this Amnesia we're told because it it CS you to be to a place where you cannot identify yourself brother spends a lot of time in spiritual Amnesia and and he talks about uh he tells different stories but he talks about uh sometimes in the war the different ones who were shell shocked and they had Amnesia and they forgot who they were they couldn't identify they couldn't tell you their name they didn't know if they were married they didn't know where they Liv they didn't know where they came from they didn't know who their parents were they had complete Amnesia it was erased all they knew was the present they didn't know anything it calls you to a place where you cannot identify yourself that's spiritual am that's amnesia now it's an unusual thing it don't happen too often but the causes is from shock it's somebody that don't even know who they are you find it from war sometimes soldiers get it sometimes people get it another thing that causes it is worry worry will cause it this is good brother REM said another thing that will cause it is being halt between two opinions you don't know whether this is true or that's true and you're somewhere in between you don't know whether you should do this or you don't know whether you should do that you're somewhere in between he said that will cause that will cause Amnesia being halt between two opinions being Shell Shocked because you took a blow from a war that'll cause Amnesia and worry he said will cause Amnesia even if it's temporary Amnesia because when I say Amnesia you think well I never forgot who I was cuz I worried or got between no temporarily you're no longer identifying yourself properly under worry when you're worried about something and stressed and you're afraid you become afraid and you forget you're a Son of God you get nervous that you're not going to be a a saved you get nervous that you're not going to come out of this situation that you're not going to be rescued that's spiritual Amnesia because you're no longer identifying yourself as a Son of God you get between two opinions and you don't know which way is right or what thing I should should do and which direction I should go and all of a sudden you start looking at all of these things you're looking at yourself you try to solve the equation and you can easily slip back into spiritual Amnesia and not be able to properly identify yourself because you don't know what you are don't know if I'm this or I don't know if I'm this that can cause you not to be able to identify yourself or if you get a shock in war and I don't think any of us here have been in a literal War recently but we've been in a lot of battles anybody been in a spiritual battle been shocked maybe been rattled a little bit does anybody got rattled that can cause Amnesia temporarily not being able to identify who you are don't know if I'm in I'm out I don't know if I'm one of them or not one of them I don't know if I agree or disagree I don't know we find that this spiritual Amnesia this alienation from God this ignorance and blindness is slipped in because Adam and Eve left the word brother Ram says in in Fellowship he said when Adam and Eve separated themselves from God by sin separated them became they became a wonderer then no Fellowship wondering about weaken down watch what's the matter with man today sin has separated man from that type of Fellowship when man sin when when the woman was deceived and she sinned amen and Adam took her into his self and he left the word amen all of a sudden they become Wanderers they become separated they become alienated they lost that Fellowship that they had and they begin wandering around and they no longer had the identification that they had before because Adam was a Son of God he was a God on the earth he had control he named the animals amen he he spoke things and they moved at his command he moved creation he moved nature he could properly identify himself but he took a blow he took a he took a blow in a spiritual battle and he could no longer properly identify himself and he became just a tiller he became uh somebody who thorns and thistles were overcoming his crops now he couldn't speak them out of existence he was plowing and then his children started suffering with spiritual Amnesia started being born because of hybridization because of the fall in the garden started being born ignorant blind alienated from the life of God and that's how we all come into this world because of that because of a separation from the word but brother R tells us God has promised to restore and that's the work that he's doing now he's bringing it back back through a channel that he promised to bring it back by and Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said secondly to have the preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bride that he might live in people now he could do that in Adam and Eve but sin separated them so now there had to be some way to get them back again then further down in the same message he says notice then one like the first Adam and Eve before sin separated them in death now Christ the second Adam in life redeems his bride from death and now on his way back to the original the original Eden restoring back his bride in Fellowship back with God as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden sure Christ and his bride so what is the word what is the message for this hour doing it is saving the bride it is saving her amen and bringing her back into the position she fell from bringing her back into what she was amen she through said through seven Church ages she's fallen into ruin the church has fallen amen and separated from God and been put away yes but God in the end time through the opening of the word he's going to save her amen amen bring her back redeem her restore her and make her whole again what she was originally intended to be which was a bride for Jesus Christ and it's this message that's doing the work it's it's not just the message I I don't want to say it that way because brother bham Jesus Christ came and he preached a message but it only saved those who could believe amen it couldn't save anybody who didn't believe Paul the Apostle came and preached the message but it can only save those who believed yeah right I mean Apostle Paul he came and he preached the message and he found Lydia and he began to tell Lydia the present day truth the message of the hour and all of a sudden there was some in Lydia that could believe it yeah amen and listen Lydia had lived near a synagogue there was synagogues everywhere remember everywhere Paul went he went to the synagogue to preach so every city had a synagogue they all had a Jewish population they all all these Gentiles they had a chance to hear the history the historical God Amen The God Who parted the sea through God had did all in that but what woke up Lydia was when Paul came and told her the present tense truth amen amen that's what happened Amen to the Apostle Paul uh uh and Paul and Barnabas when they were in the book of Acts am mean they went to the synagogue preaching and all of a sudden the Gentiles heard him gladly everybody was super excited about what they heard but then some people got upset and wanted to hold to the traditional teaching and not to accept this because of the popularity of Paul and they started a big Hall of blue but Paul said it was needful that the gospel first be presented to you but Lo we turned to the Gentiles and they which were ordained into eternal life believed what did they believe they had also been part of the synagogue they first heard him in the synagogue they had heard all the traditional teaching and they liked it because there was something in them that had a capacity for truth they liked what they were hearing but when they heard the present tense I am something in them said yes that's what I want to can you come back and preach that again next week I want to hear more am some were threatened by Ministry another group wanted more of it what was it doing it was unlocking their identity they were beginning to see who they really were not just proelite Jews not just an attachment to the Jewish tradition not somebody who was allowed to just sit on the outskirts and hear what they was no they were learning by that day that Jesus Christ broke down the middle partition now there is no separation now you're a son and daughter of God what was it doing it was healing their spiritual amnesia it was saving them amen let's go to Titus Chapter 3 still want to look at Soo just a couple more times or on the subject like I said 111 times we're not going to read them all we won't even read half just a fraction portion Titus Chapter 3 Verse four Titus 3 and4 but after that the kindness and love of God our savior toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us that's Soo according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost which he shed in US abundantly through Jesus Christ Our Savior that being justified by his grace we should be made Heirs of according to the hope of eternal life so now God saved them by his through his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost they were saved by the new birth which brother Brenham teaches is true salvation is being born again by the spirit of God not a confession but a the true salvation is a new birth to be born born again in our day for the elect to be born again by the spirit of God James chapter 1 James James James where are you hiding James James chapter 1 verse 21 wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls so now what is able to save our souls the engrafted word the engrafted word will save our souls this word engrafted is an interesting word you look it up and it means inborn implanted by Nature implanted by others instruction so what will save your souls the inborn word the word that's born in you that's planted in you that will save your souls amen according to James see it's not it's not just saying words it's actually something that takes place on the inside it's received with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your Souls praise God brother benam in the token message he says full obedience to the word brings God the word Eternal in you and that is the token when the word is in you it's Christ in you what word the word for this day am the word that's to be received by the elect today that's Christ and when the word is in you Christ is is in you receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls brother bam says God who is rich in Mercy this quote I've read so many times but I'm going to place it here I know you know it well but we're going to read it again so I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are you're not going to be but now you are the the sons of God but's not talking future he's talking about a Salvation that's taking place now yeah a restoration a wholeness a healing of sons of God the healing of an Amnesia that caused us to be ignorant in our minds our minds darkened and alienated from the things of God there's a healing that's taking place now to take away that Amnesia that Darkness so that we can to do what to properly identify ourselves he said you don't know who you are that's Amnesia that's Amnesia you are not going to be but now you are the sons of God see you always were the sons of God for when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God before well when he before he even became material here on Earth before there was anything but God you were one of his attributes he know what your name would be he know the color of hair you would have he knowed all about you the only thing happened is when you become you being a sinner many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy I want to stop there brother B says he knew when you would come on the earth he knew what your name would be he knew what color hair you would have and he knew what color eyes you would have so God has never had Amnesia it's only we who were born in this condition came with amnesia God knew who we were and where we were but God has a method for unlocking it to bring us out of Amnesia so that we can identify ourselves because if we don't know who we are we're still stuck in Amnesia says many of you can Fellowship me on this with me on this thought when you was a little boy or little girl you would walk around and there would be certain things that would just where it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was God somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then and then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination did you catch that you picked out something you heard the gospel you went from denomination to denomination so you would have heard the traditional teaching but one day you being part of God you had to be part of the word and when you heard the word you know where you come from you know that was the truth so if you went from denomination to denomination but you didn't hear the word right but yet they were preaching out of a Bible and they were saying things that had really happened and were true what kind of word did it take to wake you up it was the word for this day it was the present it was the message of the hour but one day you being part of God you were part of the word and when you heard the word you know where you come from you know that was the truth you were always the seed was in you always the word the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you came to it so what saw the word it wasn't your brain amen it was the word that was trapped inside of you that little form of life of God the word saw the word and came to it I which one came to which I don't know but there was a magnetism and these two things came together and the third seal brother says now that's what's the reason today the revivals that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere no no the bride hasn't had a Revival yet there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God distur the bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it when did he say that that was in the third seal then he comes now he comes to to 1964 and he says why are they crying for revivals Revival in our day he says my good friend Jack Moore in his paper he's calling he says they haven't recognized The Awakening of the Bride what woke her up it was that hidden word that had been hid that only Christ himself could reveal and when Christ came himself and through a prophetic gift open the mystery of the seals all of a sudden there was something and wake up in the bride so she could get rid of her church Amnesia her denominational Amnesia and she could identify herself I'm not a church member I'm not I am heart of God it'll take those seven unknown Thunders to wake her up that's for the bride that's for the elect that's her salvation in the message spiritual Amnesia 1964 this is April 1964 it's a linky quote but I'm going to read it all I believe but just listen carefully now he's preaching spiritual Amnesia now to be a true Christian you have to be the same we don't want to forget that all that he was I'm identified with him I'm identified with him to be a true Christian notice and he is in me and I in him notice that every Christian that's a real genuine Christian Christian was with him when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy but before there was a foundation of the world Amen I'm going to read that again that hits me with such impact friends this message came to break spiritual Amnesia so we could properly identify ourselves every Christian that's a real genuine Christian was with him when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shout it for Joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in The Immortal Realm with God 10 million years before the world was ever formed and I was back there with him if I got eternal life I was there with him I was identified with him when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy what a thing brother brandom is saying listen to what this this is a human being a man born in Kentucky amen who's ministered the gospel for so many years but he's come to a place of Revelation that his Amnesia is broke and he can identify himself and he can say that I was there when the sons of God shouted for Joy I was there amen that's a man who no longer has Amnesia amen and if we haven't come to that Revelation then there's still some spiritual Amnesia and I say God save me amen heal me open my blinded eyes free me from the alienation and the ignorance that is blinding me to the real reality of who I am that's what this message is here to do save us save us from what save us from partial save us from misunderstanding save us from Darkness save us from separation to heal to restore to buy back to make whole to deliver Amen brother said I was identified with him when the morning Stars sang together and the Suns of God shouted for Joy he goes on to say some some I'll just say it this way in the humid realm of thinking he goes on to say some extreme things I was with him when he called Abraham at the age of 75 years old and his wife being 65 I told him and told him they were going to have a baby I was with him when he took his stand upon thus sayith the Lord I'm going to have a baby I stood with him every other Christian stood with him I was was with him when his Temptations come I was with him when he went up on the top of the mountain to offer up Isaac I was with him when the ram appeared I was with Joseph when he was rejected of his brothers because he was spiritual and the rest of them was carnal I was with him when he knowed the reproach he had to stand by his own Brothers what he was I am what I am he was for we were all one in Christ Jesus I was with Joseph in his cave his grave I was with him when he went to the right hand of pharaoh you had you had to be identified with him I was with Jacob that night when he wrestled all night with the angel I've wrestled myself I know what he went through with so I wrestled with Jacob the same time he did for I am his brother I was with Moses when he went down into Egypt I was with Moses at the burning bush if you're a Christian you're identified with them Bible characters don't forget it I was with Moses when all the people turned against him I was with Moses when he crossed the Red Sea when he raised his hand and walked forward and the Red Sea opened I was identified in Christ right then and I was with Moses at that hour what every Christian has been what every believer has been every believer now is identified with the same person whatever it is you must be identified don't forget that when you do you've got spiritual Amnesia you've forgotten who you are now ident now identified with him with Moses when he crossed the Red Sea I was with Elijah in the days of ABAB when they had to make a choice who they would serve God or balam we was with him on Mount Carmel when he had to make his choice for we are identified in the body of the same God that he was identified that he he was identified in so if we're identified in that body then we must remember we were with him that's right now I was with David when he was rejected by his own brother I was with David you were too if you're a Christian you have to be identified his rejection I was with the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace the fire couldn't burn them because of the presence of the fourth man I was with Daniel in the Lion's Den I was identified in there when the angel the Lord identified him there I was most surely with him at Calvary I must be identified with him at Calvary I must be there to a to a place that where not also I was identified with him at Calvary I died with him at Calvary every Christian must die with him at Calvary if you don't die with him at Calvary you can't be of his I was there when he died I died with him and then I was with him when he raised up from the dead I came up on Easter morning with him in the resurrection whatever he did I was right there with him every believer was the same and now I am seated with him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus with all the powers of Hell conquered through him every Christian believer has was seated the same way cuz you have to be identified now I find myself in this last days with the many of the believing Christians identified in his ministry he is the same yesterday today and forever I find myself in this day identified in his ministry do you find yourself that way believing it walking in it notice the works that he did he said the believer would do the same thing the works that I do shall you do also then can you be identified with him then when the reproach comes on the word Can You Stand The reproach like he did see identified with him I was identified with him brother R goes on and he goes example after example and and listen you you you you read these things and what what is he saying it sounds so extreme but the reality is if I am part of God I am part of God and wherever God was I was there too because I have representation there because what God is amen and what I am are not two separate things I'm certainly not fullness but a little measure is still part of God part of Jesus Christ part of the word to be the bride you have to be part of the word and wherever the word was you had part in that and this message came to break our spiritual Amnesia to recognize where you can say I was with the Hebrew Chen I was with the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace how I don't have conscience of it I didn't see anything I can't describe it to you but whatever is alive in me now was there whatever power is working in me was there res resing them bringing through CU it was the fourth man it was Christ and if you're part of Christ and Christ is you and you're in Christ then you were there why because whatever was there is in [Music] you amen Were You There When the sons of God shout her for Joy I don't remember it I don't have consciousness of it I can't describe it to you but something inside of me jumps up and down and says amen when I hear the prophet say that why because brother brother bham said they were shouting for Joy when he showed him his Plan of Redemption and we're in the day when he's taking the veil off his Plan of Redemption and I'm shouting for Joy today at the same thing I shouted for joy in that day if I can rejoice in the opening of the seals the peeling back of the entire mystery of redemption and shout and clap my hands then I certainly can believe I did it there when I was with him there he said to be a true Christian you have to identify yourself there amen you see that's a pretty big leap it's a leap that only faith can make human mind can't make that leap it's impossible we can we can act like we can go along with That's What Judas did right Judas believed so much Judas believed Jesus was a prophet amen Judas believed all the Miracles he saw he believed in the raising of dead he believed in the opening of blind eyes Judas did it himself he cast out demons and he healed the sick because he had a portion of the ministry of Christ Judas believed that this man was righteous he believed he was a good man he believed the things that Jesus said but brother Brandon made a statement one time he said he just couldn't see that man being God he could go so long with the message the healings the campaigns the truths the Beatitudes he could go so long but when it came to accepting that that man in flesh was actually God Judas couldn't cross that line yes that's why he sold him out we can go so long with the message but you can believe that these people are Christ they are the body of Jesus Christ The Dwelling Place of Christ that the head has come to the body and they are one that message is our Salvation sir it's bringing us back to God through a channel to break away spiritual Ania so we know who we are and we know who we are we know how to act we know what to do we know what to believe we know who we are then when we get into scraps and we get into stries and we get into trouble all we have to do is look back at what happened when that happened before when the Hebrew children had to stand for their faith well I was there I can certainly stand today cuz we stood then amen amen when Moses come against the Red Sea and had no place to go I can certainly believe in the face of unsurmountable obstacles because it worked then and I was there then and he's here now and nothing has changed with the power of God I can stand in my place because of an identification of who I am amen that I'm part of this word part of it from Genesis the Revelation all I've got to do is gain strength from what I seen Christ do before Christ in me can do it again I was part of that and now they're part of me right cuz they're not yet made perfect without us this is our healing friends this message is salvation amen this message that God gave us to peel back the sickness of a sinick soul that's ignorant to who they are who God really is and what the truth really is this message is healing this message will make us whole this message will rest restore us to the right Faith this message is salvation and the true sense of Soo this is it it's delivering us bringing us back when you know that you've been part of you are part of the word that you come from God and you go to God and you're here to live out your portion of the word that he's allotted for you now when you come to obstacles when the spiritual Amnesia is gone it's totally different where before we would run crazy before worry would put us back into spiritual Amnesia being halt between two opinions would bring us back or the shock of the trial would bring us back into spiritual Amnesia if we can just hold steady and look at what God's told us amen and not go back into spiritual Amnesia so don't let being halt between two opinions bring you back out of the message don't let worry bring you out of this Revelation and don't let shell shock from hard trials amen Knock You Out amen let's hold fast and remember who he said we are and if they could stand before then with Christ we can stand now if the word could overcome then then the word can overcome Now where's the word the word is in me the same word that was there is here Lord this is our Salvation it's not a folding of the hands and repeat meeing of prayer it's not a traditional something it's not an act that took place long ago that may have been the beginning of our journey but it actually is the thing that's preserving us into the Heavenly Kingdom it's keeping us healing us delivering us amen do you still need some Deliverance do you still want more salvation amen oh I believe you know we've given our hearts to the Lord we've received his word we received him we're saved but I want to be more saved say brother CH how can you get more saved you're eternally secure I was eternally secure before the foundation of the world when my name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life the moment I recognized it was not the time I became eternally secure I've been secure I'm in a section I believe with all my heart in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life that's written an indelible ink of the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed before the foundation of the world and can no more be lost and God can be lost not worried about being lost I'm worried about being saved fully saved completely saved absolutely saved 100% made whole I want to touch the H of His Garment as he goes by in the word today that's him amen what we're preaching is the word the message is him I want to reach out and touch him and be made every bit ho I want my confusion to go away my doubt my anxiety all the things that I'm plagued with my past experiences that are still like chains around my ankles I want to get a hold of him and say bring me greater Revelation and greater Revelation that breaks away everything I want to be more saved than I was yesterday I want to be more saved tomorrow than I am today I want to be delivered made whole set free restored and this message and faith in this message is what's doing the work you say like Jesus so be it according to your faith but we all know it's not my faith it's the faith that God gives it's a gift of faith to believe and it's faith in this revealed word when Jesus looked at the woman who touched the H of His Garment he said thy faith has made you whole I don't know how I I wish I could take what's stirring in me and give it to you but he says thy faith what you found inside of you to believe in me has made you whole right listen Jesus didn't know who touched him he just felt strength went out of him and the strength that went out of him went to her not because he went and took it out and put it in her right right I hope you're understanding right amen it was because there was something in her that could reach out and pull it from him he talked to the woman who washed his feet at Simon's house and he says all your sins are forgiven listen she didn't go down through the list of sins that she had and confessed them each one to Jesus she didn't go to the priest she didn't offer a turtle dove how could Jesus say such a thing she didn't come the traditional way of paying a price she didn't list it all out she didn't when she saw the word for her day and believed it amen he said all your sins are forgiven he didn't tell her to go to the priest he didn't tell her to go to the temple he didn't tell her to offer a lamb he says your faith has saved you that's the Bible amen that's the scriptures she believed in what Simon couldn't believe she believed in what multitudes couldn't believe she believed What Judas couldn't believe that that that man is God God has placed something in his elect that when they come in contact with the manifested Jesus Christ present tense something in them says if I can touch him I'll be every bit ho if I could serve him if I could just give to him and the same thing that was true for those women is true today thy faith has made you whole because we're saved by grace through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of God it's not your faith your faith is weak but it's the faith that's been imparted into you before the foundation of world when it was placed in your soul that part of God you have something to believe with and that is found in you so God calls it yours when you know what good and well it's not yours it's just the part of God that's been imparted unto you amen and because it's found in you it's called yours I thank God for the faith to believe this word but I want to believe more of it I want to be further United with I I I want to touch the him of His Garment every time he passes by I want to wash his feet and serve him and kiss his feet every every chance I get I want to continue being healed I want to read one more thing from the prophet as we close musicians if you'd please come brother John if you'd make your way up please this is out a resume of the ages out of the church age book this is Brother Brenham this is the last paragraph this isn't the last sentence but it's almost the last sentence the last thing that he says in the res of the ages out of the church age book he says not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I have never done that and I will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men wherein men become new creatures New Creations in Christ filled with the spirit and live according to his word what was brother Benham hoping his message would do it would break the Amnesia and bring man and God back together as one bring them back to their true identity where they came from and his message was to do what this what was broken in the Garden of Eden Fellowship between God and man it was broken they lost it and they began wonders and then they slipped into spiritual Amnesia and they could no longer identify themselves Fellowship was broken what did this message came to do what was brother benham's Ministry to do and what did he want to do restore broken Fellowship how did he do it through the revelation of the word which is Christ God used that vessel to present himself to his church again and say this is who I am this is me and those who could receive it found salvation and find Salvation and is finding Salvation let's all stand amen let's bow our heads and pray dear Lord Jesus we thank you Father we thank you for all that you've given to us Lord for we know that these things are impossible in ourselves well we don't have the capacity in our minds through genetics to reach out and touch you Lord we find ourselves incapable but Lord you place something in us something that's beyond even our thinking Lord something that just wants to reach out and grab you Lord to touch you as you pass by to serve you for we love you father God we've come into this world with our minds darkened and alienated but oh God you've shined the light in this hour to wake us up to restore us to heal us to bring us back God we want to come back I pray Lord that you would preserve us into the Heavenly Kingdom God I pray that you continually washing Us by your word and opening our eyes and giving us isav Lord as you bring your word may it continually open our eyes so that we as your people can properly identify ourselves would you heal us from spiritual Amnesia Lord would you break away all the confusion of our minds and allow the seed that's within us to come to life I pray God that you would awaken us Lord to the realities of the day we live in and may you restore us back to that Fellowship that you long for that we long for to be one with you Lord we know you're taking us back to Eden to the walking in the cool of the evening to fellowship with you Lord you're healing us and restoring us to that walk God I pray Lord that your healing work would continue that your Soo work your salvation work could continue in our lives as you take away layer by layer of Amnesia that you remove Lord everything that's been bound to us that holds us back would you heal us Lord Heal our broken hearts set us free from captivity Lord uh heal the places in us that's been bruised Lord that we might be completely free to serve you the way you want us to in this day we love you we thank you we ask that you would bless bless your people Lord as we go and return for communion I pray you would bless us Lord bless us Lord by Your Word by a a greater revelation of your word I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you we'll see you back here at 4: for
