[12:33] us lord and through us
[12:35] god may we serve your purpose lord with
[12:38] all that you've given us may we yield
[12:40] ourselves in a greater way than ever
[12:42] before that you might take us in your
[12:44] hands and use us as instruments in this
[12:46] day
[12:47] in the climax and the final moments of
[12:50] the gentile dispensation
[12:52] when everything is wrapping up lord may
[12:54] we be extra sensitive to the leading of
[12:56] your spirit may we be extra yielded to
[12:59] your hand that you might do lord what
[13:01] you've promised to do in this time
[13:04] we love you father we ask you to break
[13:06] the bread of life to us
[13:07] in jesus christ's name we pray
[13:10] amen
[13:11] man god bless you all you're standing if
[13:13] you take your bibles we're going to go
[13:15] to revelation chapter 1
[13:18] and we're going to continue with the
[13:19] seven golden candlesticks i believe this
[13:21] is part five if i'm not mistaken
[13:24] and um
[13:25] this would be kind of a continuation
[13:27] from wednesday wednesday we spoke about
[13:30] the the presence of the judge the judge
[13:33] amongst the bride and judge in our midst
[13:36] but now we want to talk about the judge
[13:38] through the bride amen and so that's
[13:40] what we'll look at this morning if the
[13:41] lord will help us
[13:43] in revelation chapter 1 verse 9
[13:47] i john who also am your brother and
[13:49] companion in tribulation and in kingdom
[13:52] and patience of jesus christ was in the
[13:54] aisle that is called patmos for the word
[13:56] of god for the testimony of jesus christ
[13:59] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[14:01] and i heard behind me a great voice as
[14:03] of a trumpet let's go over to verse 12.
[14:07] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[14:09] with me and being turned i saw seven
[14:11] golden candle sticks and in the midst of
[14:13] the seven candlesticks one like unto the
[14:15] son of man clothed with a garment down
[14:18] to the foot and gird about the paps with
[14:20] a golden girdle
[14:22] his head and his hairs were white like
[14:24] wool and as white as snow and his eyes
[14:26] were as a flame of fire and his feet
[14:29] like undefined brass as if they burned
[14:31] in a furnace in his voice as the sound
[14:33] of many waters
[14:35] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[14:37] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[14:39] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[14:43] as the sun
[14:44] shineth in his strength amen god bless
[14:47] you as you're seated
[14:50] amen we've been dealing quite a bit in
[14:52] this subject with the seven golden
[14:54] candlesticks and staying primarily
[14:56] in the verse 13 amen showing that
[15:00] when john heard a voice he turned to see
[15:03] the voice and he saw seven golden
[15:05] candlesticks and he saw one in the midst
[15:08] of the seven golden candlesticks like
[15:10] unto the son of man and now we want to
[15:12] look at at the the attributes of christ
[15:15] in the midst of the seven golden
[15:17] candlesticks and start talking about
[15:18] that as we go
[15:20] brother bam said in the patmos vision he
[15:22] says come to the ancient of days whose
[15:25] hair was white as wool and john turned
[15:27] and he saw one like the son of man
[15:29] standing in the midst of seven golden
[15:31] candle sticks with snow white hair the
[15:34] judge not girded around the waist but
[15:36] girded around the paps up here a judge
[15:39] with the sash of the judge over his
[15:41] shoulder he stood with a golden pure
[15:43] holy refined girdle that held his
[15:46] righteousness his cover he was covered
[15:48] all the way to the feet watched the
[15:50] seven-fold manifestations of his purpose
[15:52] as person and glory and brother bran was
[15:55] referring to there's seven attributes or
[15:57] seven uh characteristics of christ
[15:59] described here and we're going to go
[16:01] through those quickly but there's one
[16:02] that i really want to spend time on this
[16:04] morning but we know that he's coming in
[16:08] this dispensation we spoke about it last
[16:11] last service as a judge he's in between
[16:14] priest and in between king and he's his
[16:16] judge and i'd like to also remind you
[16:19] that brother branham said every age
[16:21] overlaps the previous age amen so
[16:24] brother branham showed us that god
[16:25] doesn't come down as a meat cleaver and
[16:27] cut something off and stun but one
[16:29] blends this way and blending that way
[16:31] and they overlap and it's very much a
[16:34] transitional phase it's a transition
[16:37] amen from church ages amen brother ben
[16:39] called it the ushering end of the
[16:40] millennium not exactly in the millennium
[16:43] yet but the ushering in the movement
[16:46] that will take us into millennium the
[16:48] movement is on the ushering in is going
[16:50] on so it's a transitional phase and we
[16:53] know that the judge amen is descending
[16:56] because in first thessalonians 4 it says
[16:59] he shall the lord himself shall descend
[17:01] with a shout with the voice of the
[17:03] archangel and the trump so we know that
[17:06] there's there's stages as he descends
[17:08] there's there's things that are being
[17:10] manifested him and the shout which is
[17:12] the message to gather aim in the elect
[17:14] the bride together the voice he said the
[17:17] same voice that raised lazarus from the
[17:19] dead amen and we're going to talk about
[17:20] that a bit today and the trump of god so
[17:23] we know that we're in the rapture cycle
[17:25] we know this is the rapture season and
[17:27] we know the culmination of the rapture
[17:29] season is the change of the body and the
[17:31] translation of the saints amen
[17:33] but we cannot say that the rapture has
[17:35] not begun because the rapture begins
[17:37] with the shout
[17:38] out so the trans the the translation is
[17:41] on the body change god is changing us
[17:43] more into the image of the word day by
[17:45] day until this outer man is coming
[17:48] subject to the life on the inside and
[17:50] being reigned in more and more to
[17:52] reflect the life of jesus christ amen so
[17:55] our soul changed amen we we've got the
[17:57] full revelation of the word so this is
[18:00] the resurrection of the bride amen
[18:02] resurrecting amen what she was meant to
[18:05] be in the beginning and died through the
[18:07] church ages when he preaches a
[18:09] restoration of the bride tree we see
[18:10] there's a restoration of that bride back
[18:13] to what she was originally intended to
[18:15] be only now with the full revelation of
[18:19] the sevenfold mystery of god to finish
[18:22] what she did not finish in the beginning
[18:25] amen so we're together
[18:26] so when we see him coming as the white
[18:29] wigged one amen amongst the seven golden
[18:31] candlesticks we realize we're in a
[18:33] transitional phase amen
[18:36] praise god
[18:39] because the the one thing that i want to
[18:42] discuss and talk about too is when we
[18:45] see him moving his judge and we see that
[18:47] the lamb took the book and and we
[18:49] understand that these things amen we we
[18:52] sometimes get caught up amen in the
[18:54] symbols of god and the transitions and
[18:57] we think that now there's no more
[18:59] possibility of anybody being saved amen
[19:02] but that's a foolish thing for me to
[19:04] preach because we know that the seals
[19:07] were open in 1963 and i was born in 1977
[19:12] so if i believed that it was cut off
[19:14] like a meat cleaver when the lamb took
[19:15] the book and opened the seals amen
[19:17] through the ministry of the prophet in
[19:19] this end time then i would find myself
[19:21] cut off with no chance for mercy and no
[19:23] opportunity to be part of the bride
[19:25] amen but we know the lamb took the book
[19:28] he's the only one who can loose the
[19:29] seals
[19:30] the seals have been loosed the seals
[19:31] have been opened amen he tore open the
[19:33] seals and sent it down to a seventh
[19:35] church aged messenger that was on earth
[19:37] at that time and he turned around and
[19:39] gave it to the elect to the bride amen
[19:41] so we know the lamp taking the book we
[19:43] know we're in transition we know we've
[19:45] heard the shout we know the voice is
[19:47] ongoing we know we're in the rapture
[19:49] cycle we know this is the resurrection
[19:51] we know this is a transitional phase
[19:55] but
[19:56] as there is an ushering in of the
[19:58] millennium
[19:59] there will be a day when the millennium
[20:01] starts
[20:02] and we know when the rapture is
[20:04] beginning as he's gathering his elect
[20:06] together we know there'll be an end to
[20:08] the rapture amen in the final
[20:09] translation amen
[20:12] so praise be to god hold that in your
[20:14] minds
[20:15] now brother ben said in spiritual food
[20:17] in due season said and just started
[20:20] walking around but
[20:22] i put my shovel down he's he's in the
[20:25] at sunset mountain he's there camping
[20:27] with the brothers or on a hunting trip
[20:29] and the whirlwind's about to descend
[20:32] he said i just put my shovel down turned
[20:34] around took off my hat and here he come
[20:36] the glory of god falling in a whirlwind
[20:38] that tore the side of the mountain out
[20:40] like that and blasted and
[20:42] shook the place like that cut the top of
[20:44] the bushes out just about three or four
[20:46] five feet above my head went back up
[20:48] like a funnel like that it blasted again
[20:50] and here it come three times
[20:52] then when it left the third time brother
[20:54] banks come over and said that's what you
[20:56] was talking about i said yes
[20:58] he said what what was it i said god
[21:00] appears in whirlwinds i didn't know
[21:02] whether he wanted me to tell the people
[21:03] or not then i went on and prayed a
[21:05] little bit and then he told me i could
[21:07] tell them i said it's judgment striking
[21:10] the west coast
[21:12] look at her today look what happened a
[21:13] few hours after that alaska sunk and now
[21:16] the whole thing is going under we're
[21:18] entering into the judgment mercy has
[21:21] been spurned
[21:23] that true
[21:24] [Music]
[21:25] brother branham says we're entering into
[21:27] the judgment mercy has been spurned but
[21:30] brother branham never said amen mercy is
[21:33] over amen mercy's been spurned amen they
[21:36] rejected the opening of the seals now
[21:39] the judgment cycle has begun amen but
[21:42] will not be fully unleashed until until
[21:45] the bride is taken out of the way and
[21:47] the tribulation period sets in
[21:50] but he says we're entering into the
[21:52] judgment remember everything overlaps
[21:56] now he goes on to say but thanks be to
[21:58] god we got hidden food
[22:02] spiritual food that we're living on the
[22:04] goodness and mercy of the revelation of
[22:06] jesus christ in the last days
[22:07] vindicating himself among his people
[22:09] amen they went in elijah went in before
[22:12] the drought set in thank god for being
[22:15] in before the judgment sets in now is a
[22:17] time of coming out and going in getting
[22:19] out of these organizations and getting
[22:21] into christ coming out and going in time
[22:23] for all true believers
[22:25] then he was called and stayed in there
[22:27] remember he never left that brook until
[22:29] god called him
[22:31] and he's referring to a statement he
[22:33] made earlier in the same message and
[22:35] amen in that statement is this
[22:38] he says it several paragraphs before
[22:40] said remember he went into his secret
[22:42] place he's speaking of elijah by the
[22:44] plan of god by the call of god and the
[22:47] word of god elijah entered into a secret
[22:49] place by god's foreknowledge plan and
[22:52] the call upon his life and according to
[22:54] the word if that ain't the way we
[22:56] entered i don't know why why we i don't
[22:59] know why we get there
[23:01] and notice before the drought began
[23:03] elijah went into the place of secret of
[23:06] his living a very type of before the
[23:08] judgment starts to strike the earth the
[23:10] church is already called out the bride
[23:12] has already chosen and just waiting
[23:14] before the judgment strikes already
[23:16] waiting eating the food of god enjoying
[23:19] the blessings of god any man in his
[23:21] normal mind knows that we're headed
[23:23] straight we're right in the hour of
[23:26] judgment
[23:27] so brother bam shows that the the
[23:30] judgment cycle has begun there was a
[23:32] mighty prophet on the earth at the time
[23:34] that was told to pick up a rock and
[23:36] throw it in the air and he says see you
[23:38] have to do something to cause something
[23:40] and so when it come down it started a
[23:42] whirlwind and then the next day is when
[23:44] the whirlwind came down and blast three
[23:46] times over his head and he told him what
[23:48] it said his judgment striking the west
[23:50] coast and then just shortly after that
[23:52] it goes up and strikes alaska
[23:55] and alaska nearly sinks has a major
[23:57] earthquake amen and so brother telling
[23:59] us that the judgment is upon us the
[24:02] judgment we're entering into the
[24:04] judgment mercy has been spurned we're in
[24:06] a transitional phase but in the
[24:08] transitional phase before the drought
[24:10] come god had called elijah
[24:13] god had called elijah out into the
[24:15] wilderness by the brook of kidron and
[24:17] promised there to feed him amen with
[24:20] special food and sustain him throughout
[24:22] the drought and brother bam says that's
[24:24] what's happened to us amen that god has
[24:26] drawn us aside there's a there's a
[24:28] drought that hit the churches there's a
[24:30] drought spiritually that hit the world
[24:33] there's darkness upon the world gross
[24:34] darkness upon the people amen but we've
[24:37] been drawn aside to a secret place in
[24:40] the midst of the desert an oasis amen
[24:42] and the oasis is his word amen he has
[24:45] given his word that's why the prophet of
[24:47] god was told to store up the food amen
[24:50] not to go on the trip to overseas but
[24:52] stay and store up the food and he said
[24:54] the nicest prettiest vegetables i ever
[24:56] seen they were storing up and bringing
[24:58] them into the tabernacle and he says
[25:00] that's when we canceled the trip and
[25:02] just made tapes amen because he was
[25:04] storing up the food amen for the season
[25:07] of drought there was a place amen that
[25:10] god could draw his elect to and sustain
[25:12] them
[25:13] through the drought
[25:15] say thanks be to god amen
[25:19] in the message who do you say this is
[25:20] from 64 the prophet says day before i
[25:23] took a rock and throwed it up in the air
[25:25] and said thus saith the lord the hour is
[25:27] here judgments will start into the earth
[25:30] earthquakes and everything will be
[25:32] taking place and all the west coast will
[25:34] be shook and so forth look how perfect
[25:36] day by day everything just exactly the
[25:38] way he said
[25:40] so there's no question that we've
[25:42] entered into judgments that the earth is
[25:44] reeling under the judgments of god amen
[25:47] and these are only pre-trimmers amen
[25:49] these are only precursors to the to the
[25:52] tribulation that is coming upon the
[25:54] earth and of these we're seeing the
[25:56] frequency and intensity amen of
[25:59] pestilence of earthquakes of civil
[26:02] unrest of political distress a financial
[26:05] distress if we're seeing all that and
[26:07] it's building and building the whole
[26:09] world knows it's building
[26:11] there's not a question in anybody's mind
[26:13] that trouble is brewing something's
[26:15] building that the whole world is about
[26:17] ready to pop amen
[26:20] and we see that but there's a place that
[26:22] god has to sustain his elect there's an
[26:25] oasis in the desert there's a light
[26:27] that's shining brighter than ever before
[26:30] in the midst of darkness amen he says
[26:32] arise and shine for thy light has come
[26:35] amen
[26:36] praise be to god so i want to show the
[26:39] the whole point of this is showing we've
[26:41] entered into a judgment cycle
[26:44] mercy has been spurned the prophet's
[26:46] message has been rejected amen we're in
[26:48] a transitional phase and judgments have
[26:50] begin to roll upon the earth
[26:53] during that time we have an oasis we
[26:56] have a hiding place
[26:59] now we spoke we've been speaking about
[27:01] the first attribute of this judge that's
[27:04] amidst in the midst of the seven golden
[27:06] candlesticks
[27:07] and it was his hair as white as wool we
[27:10] read this quote out of the rising of the
[27:12] sun it says well if you'll turn the
[27:14] picture like this and look you can
[27:16] probably see it from the audience it's
[27:18] christ see his eyes looking here just as
[27:20] perfect as it could be wearing the white
[27:22] wig of supreme deity and judge of all
[27:26] heavens and earth can you see his eyes
[27:29] nose his mouth just turn the picture
[27:31] from this the way they had it this way
[27:33] the way it's supposed to be can you see
[27:35] it he is supreme judge there is none
[27:37] other but him and that is a perfect
[27:40] identification again a vindication that
[27:43] this message is the truth
[27:46] this is the truth it's true and making
[27:48] him not a third person but the only
[27:50] person remember wednesday we spoke that
[27:53] brother bannon when he saw that capstone
[27:56] in the in the form of a a of a pyramid a
[27:59] capstone in the sky the cloud amen he
[28:01] knew it was seven angels and he knew it
[28:03] was the seven angels of the seven church
[28:05] ages that come and picked him up and he
[28:08] was received into them amen into them
[28:11] who had the mystery of the of what was
[28:14] on the white rock amen the mystery that
[28:16] was with inside themselves amen
[28:19] and in the capstone amen and he knew
[28:22] that and he knew it was the fulfillment
[28:24] of his vision amen but it was months
[28:26] later that he was looking at the picture
[28:28] and told to turn it to the right when he
[28:30] turned it to the right he recognized
[28:32] that this was the head of christ this
[28:33] was the capstone is the headship of
[28:36] christ coming back upon the body amen
[28:38] and he's coming back as judge
[28:42] as the white wigged one amen and he has
[28:44] supreme authority and supreme judge of
[28:47] all heavens and earth
[28:49] so we looked at that but if we go back
[28:51] to our scripture
[28:53] and revelations chapter one
[28:58] verse 14 begins the description his head
[29:01] and his hairs were white like wool as
[29:02] white as snow and his eyes were as a
[29:05] flame of fire
[29:07] amen this is a description
[29:10] of christ
[29:11] the judge
[29:13] but remember where he's at
[29:15] he's in the midst of the seven golden
[29:17] candlesticks
[29:20] and this is what brother brahm said i'm
[29:21] just going to grab excerpts of these and
[29:23] i'm just going to give a brief
[29:24] description because like i said before
[29:25] there's one that i want to spend time on
[29:28] in the patmos vision from the church age
[29:29] book he said those fiery flaming eyes of
[29:32] the judge are even now recording the
[29:35] lives of all flesh amen the eyes amen
[29:39] represent something that can be seen
[29:41] amen uh they represent an illumination
[29:43] understanding intelligence and the
[29:46] ability to see so this is a judge who
[29:49] can see but his vision is perfect and
[29:52] piercing amen his eyes are a flame of
[29:55] fire he said
[29:57] the and i'll repeat this those fiery
[30:00] flaming eyes of the judge are even now
[30:02] recording the lives of all flesh running
[30:04] to and fro throughout the earth there is
[30:06] nothing he does not know he knows the
[30:09] desires of the heart and what each one
[30:11] intends to do there is nothing hidden
[30:13] that shall not be revealed for all
[30:15] things are naked before him with whom we
[30:17] have to do think of it he knows even now
[30:21] what you are thinking
[30:23] no one will escape those flaming eyes
[30:26] they pierce to the heart and he knows
[30:29] the motive behind our actions
[30:32] and not just our actions the actions of
[30:34] the whole world because he is the judge
[30:37] amen the next attribute we see
[30:40] here is
[30:42] verse 15
[30:44] in his feet like in defined brass as if
[30:46] they had been burned in a furnace
[30:49] his feet like fine brass amen and
[30:52] and we know that the prophecy says that
[30:54] he will tread upon his enemies and put
[30:56] his enemies under his feet and brass in
[30:59] the scriptures is a type of judgment
[31:02] remember the serpent on the pole of
[31:03] brass amen the the brass altar amen
[31:06] where the lamb is sacrificed and many
[31:08] many animals are sacrificed and burnt
[31:11] because it's sin being judged the
[31:13] serpent on the pole with sin from the
[31:14] garden being judged amen so brass is a
[31:17] type of judgment and judgments on his
[31:20] feet because he will put everything
[31:22] under his feet amen everything that is
[31:25] wicked everything that is hybrid
[31:27] everything that amen is not of god will
[31:30] be put under his feet amen
[31:33] let's look at revelation 19. i want to
[31:35] look at this in a couple scriptures
[31:38] revelation 19.
[31:43] revelation 19 is christ coming on a
[31:45] white horse in the armies of heaven
[31:47] following behind him
[31:49] but i want to read uh starting in verse
[31:51] 15 revelation 19 verse 15.
[31:56] and out of his mouth goes sharp
[31:58] i'm sorry out of his mouth go a sharp
[32:00] sword that with it he should smite the
[32:02] nations and he shall rule them with a
[32:04] rod of iron he treadeth the winepress of
[32:07] the fierceness and wrath of almighty god
[32:10] and he hath on his vesture and on his
[32:12] thigh a name written king of kings and
[32:14] lord of lords
[32:16] he will stamp out the residue he will he
[32:18] will put everything under his feet there
[32:21] will be nothing above him but everything
[32:23] will be under him in judgment amen
[32:27] we're told in in genesis chapter 3
[32:30] when god is pronouncing his judgment
[32:32] amen after he comes into the garden of
[32:34] eden after the fall he begins to judge
[32:37] the serpent he says and the lord god
[32:39] said unto the serpent because thou has
[32:41] done this thou art cursed above all
[32:43] cattle and above every beast of the
[32:45] field upon thy belly shalt thou go and
[32:47] thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy
[32:50] life and i will put enmity between thee
[32:52] and the woman in between thy seed and
[32:54] her seed it shall bruise thy head and
[32:57] thou shall bruise his heel
[32:59] here we have a prophecy showing that the
[33:02] serpent and everything that the serpent
[33:05] represents amen all of satan's works and
[33:08] all of satan's kingdom amen will be
[33:11] crushed his head will the head will be
[33:13] put under the foot amen so the highest
[33:16] of the of the serpent order will be put
[33:18] under the king of kings amen
[33:21] so that's one prophecy but let's go to
[33:23] romans 16.
[33:27] and look at another
[33:31] so we know the seed of the woman is
[33:33] christ
[33:36] but when we go to romans chapter 16
[33:40] we want to look at verse 20.
[33:44] romans 16
[33:46] and 20
[33:48] said
[33:50] and the god of peace shall bruce satan
[33:52] under your feet shortly
[33:54] see this judge was in the midst of the
[33:57] seven golden candlesticks
[34:00] and those feet of brass he says that
[34:03] that that
[34:04] he will bruise your head
[34:06] but you will bruise his heel that you're
[34:08] going to be bruised in the head under
[34:11] his heel amen but then he comes along
[34:13] and paul says and the god of peace shall
[34:15] brew satan under your feet shortly
[34:18] showing that the bride of christ is
[34:20] included in the prophecy of christ amen
[34:22] because it's christ she is him she is
[34:25] part of him she come from his side she
[34:27] he is the word made flesh in his day she
[34:30] is the word made flesh in her day she is
[34:32] a part of god a part of christ amen a
[34:36] part of the revelation of the word and
[34:38] she is lumped together in the prophecy
[34:40] he will put the serpent under his feet
[34:43] amen god will put bruce satan under your
[34:45] feet shortly
[34:46] showing that they're tied together so
[34:48] this judge is in the midst of the seven
[34:50] golden candlesticks which represents the
[34:52] church through seven church ages
[34:55] amen let's go back to revelation chapter
[34:57] one
[35:05] revelation chapter one
[35:09] in second part of verse 15 in his voice
[35:12] is the sound of many waters i'm going to
[35:14] come back to that i'm not going to go to
[35:16] that one yet i want to end on that
[35:18] verse 16 and he had in his right hand
[35:20] seven stars
[35:22] in his right hand seven stars and we
[35:24] know that the seven stars are the seven
[35:27] uh church age messengers and the
[35:29] ephesians church age out of the church
[35:31] age book he says there he is with the
[35:33] seven stars in his right hand the right
[35:35] hand our arm signifies the power and
[35:37] authority of god psalms 44 3 for they
[35:40] got not the land in possession by their
[35:42] own sword neither did their arms save
[35:44] them but the right hand and thine arm
[35:46] and the light of thy countenance because
[35:48] thou hates favor unto them
[35:50] and thy right hand of power are seven
[35:53] stars who according to revelation 1 20
[35:56] are the seven church messengers this
[35:58] signifies that the very power and
[36:00] authority of god are behind his
[36:02] messengers to every age they go forth in
[36:05] the fire and power of the holy ghost
[36:07] with the word so being in the right hand
[36:10] they signify that they have the
[36:11] authority and power of jesus christ
[36:14] those seven messengers but brother
[36:16] branham is not going to limit it only to
[36:18] the seven messengers because in the in
[36:21] the church age book and the patmos
[36:22] vision he says as each age pulled away
[36:25] from god his faithful messenger turned
[36:27] that age back to the word
[36:29] their strength was from the lord or they
[36:32] never could have stemmed the tide they
[36:34] were safe in his care for nothing could
[36:37] pluck them out of his hand and neither
[36:39] could anything separate them from the
[36:41] love of god let it be sickness peril
[36:43] nakedness famine sword life or death
[36:46] they were truly yielded to him and kept
[36:48] by his omnipotence they were not
[36:50] concerned about the persecution that
[36:52] came their way pain and derision was but
[36:55] caused to give glory to god that they
[36:57] were counted worthy to suffer for him
[37:00] and in thankfulness for his salvation
[37:02] they burned with the light of his life
[37:04] and reflected his love patience meekness
[37:06] temperance gentleness faithfulness
[37:09] and god backed them up with wonders
[37:11] signs miracles they were accused of
[37:13] being fanatics and holy rollers they
[37:16] were denounced by organizations and held
[37:18] in mockery but they kept true to the
[37:20] word
[37:21] now he's speaking this of the seven
[37:24] church age messengers that are in his
[37:25] right hand but he's saying they could
[37:27] not be plucked out of his hand and who
[37:29] else cannot be plucked out of his hand
[37:31] you and i cannot be plucked out of his
[37:33] hand
[37:34] and he goes on to say and this comfort
[37:37] is not for the seven church age
[37:39] messengers only
[37:42] every true believer is in the hand of
[37:44] god and can draw from his love and power
[37:47] amen and receive the full benefit of all
[37:50] that god is to the believer what god
[37:52] gives the messenger and how he blesses
[37:55] and uses the messenger is an example to
[37:58] all believers of his goodness and care
[38:00] to all members of his body although
[38:04] there was seven stars in his hand which
[38:06] represented the seven lights amen to the
[38:09] seven church ages the seven angels and
[38:11] the seven dispensations what he shows
[38:14] through the messenger life becomes an
[38:16] example to all just like brother branham
[38:18] amen his life the word coming to
[38:21] manifestation and his flesh became an
[38:24] example to all of us it became the wave
[38:26] sheath amen that showed this is full
[38:28] harvest maturity take courage what
[38:31] happened here will happen to you also
[38:33] amen so what he did to the messengers
[38:36] was an example of what he's doing for
[38:38] you and i
[38:39] we're not the messengers but we're
[38:41] holding up that light
[38:43] amen and we're in his hand just like the
[38:46] messengers were
[38:48] we're in his hand we're securing his
[38:50] hand and can draw from the power of that
[38:53] strong arm
[38:55] not our power
[38:57] his
[38:58] power amen you see how these attributes
[39:02] they apply to christ but they apply to
[39:04] his bride because they are one
[39:07] amen let's keep going
[39:10] and first revelation revelations one
[39:14] 16 he had his right hand seven stars and
[39:17] out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged
[39:19] sword
[39:21] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[39:22] two-edged sword and in the church age
[39:24] book again he says hebrews 4 12 for the
[39:27] word of god is quick and powerful and
[39:29] sharper than any two-edged sword
[39:31] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[39:34] soul and spirit and of the joints and
[39:35] morrow and is the discerner of the
[39:37] thoughts and intents of the heart
[39:40] it is the word it is
[39:42] it is performing where unto it was sent
[39:46] for it the word is full of power it is
[39:49] the same spirit that was in jesus the
[39:51] word that is present again in the church
[39:54] in the last age as a last sign trying to
[39:57] heed the people off from judgment
[40:00] for they
[40:01] for they that reject him the word are
[40:03] now already come into judgment
[40:05] crucifying him afresh hebrews 6 6 if
[40:09] they shall fall away to renew them again
[40:11] unto repentance seeing they crucify to
[40:13] themselves the son of god afresh and put
[40:16] him to an open shame
[40:18] now paul said that the word came in
[40:20] power as well as voice the word preach
[40:23] actually demonstrates itself
[40:26] like a flaming cutting sword it went to
[40:28] the conscience of men and like a
[40:30] surgeon's knife it cut out the disease
[40:33] and set the captives free what did that
[40:35] the preaching of the word amen the sword
[40:38] amen it came in and in it and it it cut
[40:41] in the conscience of man and like a
[40:44] surgical knife it cut out the disease
[40:46] and set the captives free what was it it
[40:48] was the word amen
[40:52] he's gone
[40:55] everywhere those early believers went
[40:56] they went preaching the gospel word and
[40:58] god confirmed the word with signs
[41:00] following the sick were healed devils
[41:03] were cast out they spoke in new tongues
[41:05] that was the word in action that word
[41:08] has never failed in the mouths of
[41:10] believing christians
[41:12] and in this last age it is here stronger
[41:14] and greater than ever in the true word
[41:17] bride
[41:18] oh little flock you little minority hold
[41:21] on to the word fill your mouth and heart
[41:24] with it and someday god will give you
[41:26] the kingdom
[41:28] amen that that sword that was coming out
[41:30] of his mouth was not only supposed to
[41:33] come out of his mouth but it's supposed
[41:34] to come out of our mouth too amen it is
[41:37] supposed to be the word that we speak
[41:39] the word that we preach the word that we
[41:41] testify with it's the word that does the
[41:43] work amen because psychology will never
[41:46] do it emotionalism will never do it but
[41:48] the word can go into the conscience of
[41:50] man and cut like a surgeon's knife and
[41:53] cut the disease that's laying there out
[41:55] amen and the man who's doing the
[41:57] preaching and the person who's doing the
[41:58] testifying often doesn't even know the
[42:01] work that god is doing amen with his
[42:03] mighty sword but is there something
[42:05] laying in the conscience of a man of
[42:08] another person amen the only thing you
[42:10] can do for them is give them the word
[42:13] and the word amen will do the work and
[42:15] cut out the disease
[42:18] amen
[42:21] there's so much
[42:23] amen that has been given to us the
[42:25] answer is in our hands amen god has
[42:28] given us the word amen he sent a mighty
[42:31] prophet to vindicate that word and that
[42:33] word is here amen been given to us and
[42:35] handed to us for us to use so we don't
[42:38] need to use reasoning we don't need to
[42:40] use uh intellectualism we don't need to
[42:42] use
[42:43] schools of theology we don't need to use
[42:45] emotionalism we don't you use
[42:47] psychological techniques what we need to
[42:50] take and use is the word because the
[42:52] word is what works and the word has
[42:54] never lost its power in true believing
[42:56] christians
[42:57] it's not the diminished one i owe to
[42:59] amen and brother beam said let it come
[43:02] from your mouth and your heart amen let
[43:04] the word be coming out of the mouth of
[43:06] the bride
[43:08] now don't think for a minute that i
[43:09] think we should not have compassion or
[43:11] sympathy
[43:12] or feeling amen we should have all kinds
[43:14] of feeling when somebody's in trouble
[43:16] somebody's in need and somebody's coming
[43:18] to us love them have compassion have
[43:20] feeling have emotion for them amen care
[43:23] for them but that care and love and
[43:25] emotion won't fix anything if there's no
[43:28] word present the word is what does the
[43:30] work.
[43:33] but we should love
[43:34] everyone
[43:37] look on them with compassion considering
[43:38] ourselves
[43:40] amen let's go back to our scripture
[43:43] in revelation
[43:45] verse 16. now we're at the bottom of the
[43:47] verse
[43:48] and his countenance was as the sun
[43:51] shineth in his strength and his
[43:54] countenance was as the sun
[43:56] shineth in his strength the church age
[43:58] book the prophet of god says there it is
[44:00] again the sun shineth out and all its
[44:02] strength
[44:03] oh the strength of the son of god
[44:05] shining in the midst of the seven golden
[44:07] candlesticks
[44:08] there he stands the judge the one who
[44:11] suffered and died for us he took the
[44:13] wrath of divine judgment upon himself he
[44:15] tread the winepress of the fierceness of
[44:17] the wrath of god alone as we have
[44:19] already stated to the center his voices
[44:22] as the sound of the cataract or the surf
[44:25] pounding in the waves of death upon the
[44:27] rocky shores
[44:28] but to the saint his voice is as the
[44:31] sound of the sweetly singing brook as
[44:33] you lie at rest
[44:36] i want you to catch this
[44:38] first we'll see he's talking about his
[44:39] son shineth in his strength amen because
[44:42] you know brother bran was was also
[44:44] speaking the church age book that the
[44:46] city that new jerusalem has no need of
[44:49] sun or moon amen because the glory of
[44:51] god shineth upon it and the lamb is the
[44:53] light thereof he's the illumination he's
[44:55] the light he's in full glory he in this
[44:58] day he's shining forth as the sun in the
[45:02] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[45:04] hey our light has come amen that's why
[45:06] brother ben said shalom little bride
[45:08] good morning and the sun is up amen it's
[45:11] a new day the bright and
[45:13] shining light is here the sun is shining
[45:15] and all its power and its glory where in
[45:18] the midst of the seven golden
[45:19] candlesticks in the midst of the bride
[45:21] at the end time the sun has risen where
[45:24] it has risen it's arisen upon you and i
[45:28] amen that's our light our light isn't
[45:31] anything else nothing else that man can
[45:33] produce but he's our light and that
[45:35] light is supposed to shine through the
[45:37] city because the city is made of stones
[45:40] of jasper as clear as crystal amen so
[45:43] they shine with crystal and light
[45:45] reflecting the light of jesus christ
[45:47] into the world and that's what we're
[45:49] supposed to do he's in the midst of the
[45:51] seven golden candlesticks
[45:53] he's in the city he's in her and shining
[45:56] his light amen that's why brother ben
[45:58] was talking about that little seed amen
[46:00] that's laying there under the ground
[46:02] under the dirt amen and the seed will
[46:04] lay there and that bright warm sun will
[46:07] hit it and he said and all the dirt
[46:08] around it will say oh that sun's hot
[46:11] it's uncomfortable and the seed says oh
[46:13] that's what i'm waiting for that's what
[46:15] i'm looking for that's what i want and
[46:17] it'll bring the seed to life amen
[46:20] some don't want the light some need the
[46:22] light to come to life amen and there's
[46:24] seeds laying out there i believe there's
[46:26] still seeds laying out there that needs
[46:29] the full power of the hot light amen to
[46:32] bring them there's dirt there that'll
[46:33] say that's uncomfortable for me i can't
[46:36] tolerate the heat's too much for me but
[46:38] there's seeds laying under the dirt that
[46:40] says that's what i've been waiting for
[46:42] that's what i've been looking for that's
[46:44] what i need to come to life
[46:47] so his countenance was as the son
[46:49] but as brother branham goes to explain
[46:51] this then he gets into the the back into
[46:54] the voice of god
[46:57] and i'll read this again because it's
[46:58] it's important as we go next
[47:01] it says as we have stated to the center
[47:04] his voice is as the sound of the
[47:06] cataract or the surf pounding in the
[47:08] waves of death upon the rocky shore
[47:10] so to the center that's what his voice
[47:12] is like
[47:13] troublesome and fearful and powerful and
[47:16] in a rage and in a torrent
[47:20] then he says but to the saint
[47:23] see it's the same voice
[47:26] the same word
[47:27] but depending on who's hearing it they
[47:29] hear two different things
[47:32] one
[47:33] the center is the sound of the cataract
[47:36] or the surf pounding in the waves of
[47:39] death upon the rocky shores
[47:41] but to the saint his voice is at the
[47:43] sound of the sweetly singing brook
[47:46] as you lie at rest satisfied in christ
[47:51] the question is what do you hear
[47:54] what do you hear
[47:56] it says shining upon us with his warming
[47:58] rays of love he says fear not i am he
[48:01] which was which is which is to come i am
[48:04] the almighty beside me there is no other
[48:07] i am the alpha and omega that all of it
[48:09] he's the lily of the valley the bright
[48:11] and morning star he's the fairest of ten
[48:13] thousand to my soul yes that great day
[48:16] is ready to break and the son of
[48:17] righteousness will arise with healing in
[48:20] his wings
[48:22] i'm so glad we can sing the sun is up
[48:26] amen
[48:27] now i want to go back and this is where
[48:29] i would have spent the rest of the
[48:30] service in the bottom of verse 15. we
[48:33] skipped over
[48:34] his voice as the sound of many waters
[48:39] and this is what brother bram says in
[48:40] the church age book
[48:41] he says now
[48:44] now
[48:46] what do the waters represent here in
[48:48] revelation 17 15 the waters which thou
[48:51] sawest are peoples and multitudes and
[48:54] nations and tongues
[48:56] his voice was as the sound of multitudes
[48:58] speaking
[48:59] who is this this is christ where is he
[49:02] in the midst of seven golden
[49:03] candlesticks what image is he in he's in
[49:06] the image of judge amen so here the
[49:08] judge has a voice of many waters amen in
[49:12] the many waters represent multitudes
[49:15] speaking not just one but multitude
[49:18] speaking it's one voice it's one person
[49:21] it's one word spoken through a multitude
[49:24] of voices amen
[49:26] [Music]
[49:27] what is it
[49:29] it's the judgment
[49:31] for these are the voices of the
[49:32] multitudes of witnesses who by the holy
[49:35] spirit all through the ages have
[49:37] testified to christ and preached his
[49:39] gospel it will be the voice of every man
[49:42] rising in judgment against the sinner
[49:44] who would not take warning the voices of
[49:46] the seven messengers will be heard loud
[49:48] and clear those faithful preachers who
[49:51] preach the saving power of jesus who
[49:53] preached water baptism in jesus name who
[49:55] preached the infilling and power of the
[49:57] holy ghost who stood with the word more
[49:59] than they stood with their own lives all
[50:01] of them were the voice of jesus christ
[50:04] by the holy ghost down through the ages
[50:07] this is the judge and the judge has the
[50:09] voice of many waters it's the multitudes
[50:12] through the ages that stood with the
[50:14] word
[50:16] and this is the judgment
[50:18] then he quotes a scripture out of john
[50:20] 17 20 says neither pray i for these
[50:22] alone
[50:24] but for them also which shall believe on
[50:26] me through their word
[50:29] this is what i want to talk about now is
[50:31] judgment in the bride but now judgment
[50:33] through the bride
[50:35] let's turn together to john 15.
[50:45] and really the thing that i want to
[50:46] labor on the most
[50:49] is the right attitude
[50:53] the right attitude
[50:55] as we teach this this is what i'm
[50:56] laboring on the most
[50:59] john 15 22 jesus said in john 15 22
[51:05] if i had not come and spoken unto them
[51:08] they had not had sin
[51:10] but now they have no cloak
[51:13] for their sin
[51:15] jesus said if it wasn't that i had come
[51:19] and that i had spoken the word and i had
[51:21] demonstrated the life if i had not come
[51:24] and spoken to them
[51:25] then they had no sin
[51:27] but now they have no cloak there's no
[51:30] covering for their sin their sin has
[51:32] been exposed not by calling somebody up
[51:35] and saying you're a sinner i'm exposing
[51:37] your sin no but by him coming and living
[51:40] the life and speaking the word now their
[51:42] sin is exposed
[51:45] so the exposure amen the exposure is not
[51:49] and this is this is the attitude that i
[51:51] want us to come up with it's not that we
[51:53] are here judging the world i have no
[51:55] desire to judge the world jesus told us
[51:58] judge not amen so i have no desire to
[52:00] judge anyone i want everybody to have a
[52:03] free pass if god asks me today i want to
[52:06] give everybody mercy and everybody a
[52:08] free pass and everybody come with me and
[52:10] let's dwell together in the new heavens
[52:12] and new earth there's nothing in me that
[52:14] wants to condemn anybody because if i
[52:16] condemn them i must also be condemned
[52:19] because the only way that i'm where i'm
[52:20] at is by the grace of god not by my
[52:22] actions not by my deeds so why do i want
[52:25] to condemn people for actions and deeds
[52:27] when there's no action or deed that's
[52:28] brought me here it's the grace of god
[52:30] that's brought me here
[52:32] so it was up to me i would extend it to
[52:34] everybody so we're not here saying
[52:37] you're in you're out you're this you're
[52:39] that because you didn't listen to me
[52:41] you're this and because of this you're
[52:43] that i have no desire for that i don't
[52:45] want anything to do with that but the
[52:47] reality is when you're here accepting
[52:50] the word and lining up to it amen you
[52:52] have taken the cloak away for the sin of
[52:54] those who refuse the word
[52:56] it's your life that's bringing judgment
[52:59] it's your it's your submission to the
[53:01] word amen it's it's it's the it's the
[53:03] surrender that you have to god and the
[53:06] holy ghost living through your life and
[53:08] the the way you carry yourself the way
[53:10] your family is structured the way you
[53:12] submit to god and the way you treat
[53:14] other people the way you speak the word
[53:16] of god amen it is bringing a
[53:18] condemnation to everyone who will speak
[53:21] evil against it and hate it
[53:24] and that's what jesus said if i had not
[53:26] come and spoken unto them
[53:28] they had not had sin but now they have
[53:31] no cloak for their sin
[53:35] he goes
[53:38] i'm going to skip ahead to something
[53:39] here there's a part that i want to i
[53:42] want to bring in
[53:46] let's go to matthew chapter 12.
[53:50] i didn't think i wanted to get to this
[53:51] now but i want to get to this now
[53:54] matthew chapter 12. let's look at this
[53:56] together
[54:00] in matthew 12
[54:01] i'd like to begin with verse 38.
[54:08] matthew 12 and 38 then certain of the
[54:10] scribes and of the pharisees answered
[54:12] saying master
[54:13] we would see a sign from thee
[54:15] but he answered and said unto them an
[54:17] evil and adulterous generation seeketh
[54:19] after a sign
[54:21] and there shall no sign be given to it
[54:23] but the sign of the prophet jonas
[54:26] for us jonas was three days and three
[54:28] nights in the whale's belly so shall the
[54:30] son of man be three days and three
[54:32] nights in the heart of the earth
[54:34] then listen what he says next
[54:36] the men of nineveh shall rise in
[54:38] judgment with this generation and shall
[54:41] condemn it because they repented at the
[54:43] preaching of jonas and behold a greater
[54:46] than jonas is here
[54:49] verse 42
[54:51] the queen of the south shall rise up in
[54:53] the judgment with this generation and
[54:55] shalt condemn it for she came from the
[54:57] uttermost parts of the earth to hear the
[54:59] wisdom of solomon and behold a greater
[55:02] than solomon
[55:04] is here
[55:06] jesus is telling them
[55:08] that the the the people of nineveh that
[55:11] repented under the preaching of jonas
[55:14] will raise with that present generation
[55:18] and condemn them because they repented
[55:21] at the preaching of jonas
[55:23] but they refused the ministry of jesus
[55:26] christ and he said a greater than jonas
[55:28] is here
[55:30] then he referred to the
[55:32] the queen of sheba he said that queen of
[55:34] the south amen he says she shall rise in
[55:38] the judgment and condemn this generation
[55:41] amen because she came from the uttermost
[55:43] parts of the earth and brother banham
[55:45] would tell us that she went through
[55:47] great lengths to get to solomon amen she
[55:50] really sacrificed a great deal she had
[55:52] to go through a lot and travel a great
[55:54] distance and she had to leave her
[55:56] religion and had to leave her priest at
[55:59] the objection of her priest and and she
[56:01] went amen to to go to hear the wisdom of
[56:04] solomon and she brother jesus said you
[56:06] come from the uttermost parts of the
[56:08] earth so she traveled and he said
[56:10] traveling through that desert where
[56:11] there was bands of robbers and all kinds
[56:13] of threats and traveled on camel for
[56:15] months amen just to hear a man who had
[56:19] the wisdom of god and the understanding
[56:21] of god and he says behold a greater than
[56:23] solomon is here he was right in their
[56:25] myth and they were rejecting him and
[56:27] didn't want him but here come a woman
[56:29] that would sell out that would give up
[56:30] that would take amen all kinds of
[56:32] contrary talk and people trying to hold
[56:34] her back but would still persevere just
[56:37] to get to solomon but there was a
[56:39] greater than solomon there being
[56:40] rejected in that day
[56:43] and he said the queen of the south shall
[56:45] rise with this generation
[56:47] and condemn it
[56:49] in the judgment
[56:51] listen i don't think this is just purely
[56:55] me
[56:56] i don't think the queen of sheba is
[56:58] going to stand up there
[57:00] at the judgment and say
[57:01] you you
[57:02] you you i condemn you
[57:05] i pass judgment on you i condemn you
[57:08] all she has to do is stand there and all
[57:11] god has to do is is show her life
[57:16] and it condemns all who stood right in
[57:18] the face of a greater than solomon and
[57:21] rejected his wisdom
[57:23] that's why the saints will judge the
[57:24] earth i i personally don't want any part
[57:28] of saying you my neighbor who didn't
[57:30] listen to me you're gone and this and
[57:31] that and i don't want anything to do
[57:33] with that amen i i don't want to do that
[57:36] i don't want to bring judgment or
[57:38] condemnation upon anybody the queen of
[57:40] sheba didn't travel across the desert to
[57:43] hear the wisdom of solomon to condemn an
[57:45] entire generation that wasn't the point
[57:48] the point was she was moved in her heart
[57:50] she knew there was somebody that had the
[57:52] wisdom of god and she had to get to that
[57:54] person to hear whether these things be
[57:56] true or not it was her love for god and
[57:58] her love for truth that moved her but
[58:00] that action became condemnation to all
[58:03] those who would reject
[58:04] it wasn't her motive to judge anybody
[58:07] amen those who repented amen at the
[58:09] preaching of jonas they didn't repent so
[58:12] that they could bring condemnation
[58:13] against a generation they repented
[58:15] because they believed the preaching of
[58:16] jonas and they wanted to be right with
[58:18] god
[58:19] amen so the the a judgmental judgmental
[58:23] critical attitude has no place in the
[58:25] bride of jesus christ we don't take
[58:27] pleasure in judgment we don't take
[58:29] pleasure in condemnation amen we're just
[58:31] here to serve god with all our hearts
[58:33] because we can't help ourselves because
[58:35] of what he's placed within us
[58:38] we serve god we surrender to god we give
[58:41] our lives to god we obey his word not to
[58:44] bring condemnation not to judge the
[58:46] world amen and when you see somebody
[58:48] amen who god has been so good to raise
[58:51] up with the religious pride and say how
[58:54] dare you how can you and why do you do
[58:56] this and why do you do that god is going
[58:58] to judge you you have this and you're
[59:00] this and you're that i'm telling you
[59:02] that's a judgmental critical religious
[59:04] attitude amen that the queen of sheba
[59:06] didn't have and that those in nineveh
[59:08] didn't have they had a repentant humble
[59:11] attitude and submission to the word and
[59:13] truth
[59:14] when you start to see that criticalness
[59:18] criticizing
[59:19] listen
[59:20] people are unbelievers they don't know
[59:22] any better
[59:24] is the world a mess it's a mess
[59:27] are people in darkness they're in
[59:28] darkness are their lives vile and
[59:31] ungodly they're violent ungodly but they
[59:34] were raised up in that and if there's no
[59:36] seed of god on the inside and that
[59:37] they've never seen the light where would
[59:39] you be if you were raised the way they
[59:41] were raised in the flesh they were in
[59:43] and had no seed of god to bring you out
[59:48] amen
[59:50] to me the attitude is so important
[59:54] we serve god because god has drawn us to
[59:56] himself
[59:58] we serve god because we can't help
[59:59] ourselves some of us have given up jobs
[1:00:01] some have moved locations some of us
[1:00:04] have
[1:00:04] made great sacrifices but not one of us
[1:00:07] did it to condemn another human being at
[1:00:09] least i hope not
[1:00:11] and i hope not one of us will take pride
[1:00:13] in the fact well i sold everything and i
[1:00:16] moved and i and i and i you didn't do
[1:00:19] anything if god didn't help you there
[1:00:20] wasn't a thing in this world that you
[1:00:22] could do to save yourself or help
[1:00:24] yourself or keep the word of god by
[1:00:26] yourself
[1:00:28] that whole attitude has got to go amen
[1:00:32] [Music]
[1:00:33] and just say god
[1:00:35] just use me
[1:00:37] for whatever your purpose is
[1:00:39] do i believe the bride in this end time
[1:00:42] will be a condemnation in the judgment
[1:00:44] against this whole generation i believe
[1:00:45] it with all my heart but not because she
[1:00:47] stands up and says you treated me this
[1:00:50] way and i told you and you didn't listen
[1:00:52] to me i don't believe that's going to be
[1:00:54] the white throne judgment friends
[1:00:56] i believe it's the very fact that there
[1:00:58] was a people on this earth that received
[1:01:01] the word of god would line up to the
[1:01:03] word of god would surrender to the word
[1:01:05] of god and manifest it and live it that
[1:01:08] becomes the condemnation that becomes
[1:01:10] the judgment
[1:01:13] amen
[1:01:14] so do we serve god with all of our
[1:01:17] hearts we serve god
[1:01:19] but not to put somebody down
[1:01:22] and we don't take pride in where we are
[1:01:25] but we recognize
[1:01:27] but for the grace of god
[1:01:29] there go i
[1:01:32] but for the grace of god
[1:01:34] i would be maybe worse off than the
[1:01:36] picture than i'm looking at
[1:01:39] so i say god help us to have the right
[1:01:42] attitude
[1:01:44] so there is a voice
[1:01:46] of many waters
[1:01:48] is that right
[1:01:50] and it's the voice of judgment
[1:01:53] but listen to what the prophet of god
[1:01:55] says in the church age book
[1:01:58] have you ever thought how terrifying it
[1:01:59] is to a man drifting helplessly toward a
[1:02:01] cataract
[1:02:03] think now that roar as he approaches his
[1:02:06] sure and certain doom and just exactly
[1:02:09] like that is coming the day of judgment
[1:02:11] when the roar of multitudes of voices
[1:02:14] condemns you for not having paid heed er
[1:02:16] it was too late
[1:02:18] take heed this very hour for at this
[1:02:20] moment your thoughts are being recorded
[1:02:21] in heaven there your thoughts speak
[1:02:24] louder than your words like the pharisee
[1:02:26] who the pharisee who claimed so much
[1:02:29] with his mouth but not listening to the
[1:02:31] lord his heart became corrupt and evil
[1:02:33] until it was too late even now this
[1:02:36] could be your last call to hear the word
[1:02:38] and receive it unto eternal life
[1:02:40] it will be too late when you approach
[1:02:42] the roar of the many voices of judgment
[1:02:45] and doom
[1:02:46] but have you ever noticed
[1:02:48] how sweet and relaxing the sound of
[1:02:50] water can be
[1:02:52] see brother rams flipping both sides
[1:02:54] on one side the voice of many waters is
[1:02:58] a terrible voice it's a voice of a
[1:03:01] a pending doom judgment dashed upon the
[1:03:04] rocks is going over the falls to the
[1:03:06] center it's a voice of doom but to
[1:03:09] others it has a whole different feeling
[1:03:11] to it altogether
[1:03:14] he said
[1:03:15] have you ever noticed how sweet and
[1:03:17] relaxing the sound of water can be
[1:03:21] i like to fish and i like to find a spot
[1:03:23] where the water is whispering and
[1:03:25] ripples
[1:03:26] i can just lie back and hear a speaking
[1:03:28] peace and joy and contentment to my
[1:03:30] heart how glad i am to be anchored in
[1:03:33] the haven of rest where the voice of the
[1:03:35] lord speaks peace
[1:03:37] as his word of the waters of separation
[1:03:39] hath declared how thankful we should be
[1:03:41] to hear his voice of love and care and
[1:03:43] guidance and protection and someday we
[1:03:46] will hear that same sweet voice speak
[1:03:48] not in judgment but unwelcome to us
[1:03:51] whose sins have been remitted by his
[1:03:53] blood whose lives have been
[1:03:54] spirit-filled and whose walk was in the
[1:03:56] word what could be more precious than to
[1:04:00] hear the multitudes of welcoming voices
[1:04:03] what voice is the voice of many waters
[1:04:06] down through the ages
[1:04:08] how great to hear the welcoming voices
[1:04:10] and be surrounded by those multitudes
[1:04:12] who have been how have believed unto
[1:04:14] eternal life
[1:04:15] oh there is nothing like it i pray that
[1:04:18] you will hear his voice and harden out
[1:04:20] your heart but receive him as your king
[1:04:22] oh if you would only see it it was the
[1:04:25] waters that destroyed the world
[1:04:28] but it was the same waters that saved
[1:04:29] noah
[1:04:31] and also saved the whole earth for noah
[1:04:34] listen to his voice the voice of his
[1:04:36] servants as it calls to repentance and
[1:04:39] to life
[1:04:40] listen it's the voice of judgment it's
[1:04:43] the voice of many waters but to those
[1:04:45] who will heed that voice it becomes the
[1:04:48] voice of the sweet melodious voice of a
[1:04:52] rippling of water over brooks speaking
[1:04:54] contentment and peace and love to the
[1:04:56] heart because brother branham said the
[1:04:58] same waters that destroyed the earth
[1:05:00] saved noah amen the same waters that
[1:05:03] destroyed everybody that was on the
[1:05:04] earth were the same waters that lifted
[1:05:06] noah up and moved him above the judgment
[1:05:09] oh praise god amen that means that the
[1:05:12] waters that are coming from our mouth
[1:05:14] amen the sound of many waters the word
[1:05:16] that's coming from the bride is not only
[1:05:19] for condemnation and judgment but it is
[1:05:22] also for salvation it is also a sweet
[1:05:24] sound in somebody's ears amen
[1:05:27] not everybody will hear it multitudes
[1:05:29] may not listen to it amen to that one
[1:05:32] person who finds that voice of many
[1:05:35] waters and hears it singing to him
[1:05:37] sweetly like a rippling brook amen for
[1:05:39] them that will be a voice of love that
[1:05:42] will be a voice of salvation that'll be
[1:05:44] a voice of life it'll be the sound of
[1:05:46] the river of life
[1:05:48] that's what our attitude should be we're
[1:05:51] we're not here to sound the cataracts
[1:05:54] we're here to sound sweet
[1:05:55] love joy peace the love of god the mercy
[1:05:59] of god and the grace of god that's
[1:06:01] extended to this world we're speaking
[1:06:03] peace we're speaking love we're speaking
[1:06:06] joy we're speaking contentment we're
[1:06:09] speaking a communion with god that
[1:06:11] should be always our attitude and always
[1:06:13] our approach and to somebody else they
[1:06:16] may hear it as the
[1:06:18] as as terrible churning waters of
[1:06:21] judgment but that's not our intent and
[1:06:23] giving it that was not jesus intent and
[1:06:25] living the life and giving the word he
[1:06:28] came to bring life not death
[1:06:31] amen
[1:06:32] let's look at luke
[1:06:34] luke chapter 6.
[1:06:42] luke chapter 6.
[1:06:49] and verse 37
[1:06:54] luke 6 and 37
[1:06:56] judge not and you shall not be judged
[1:06:58] contem condemn not and you shall not be
[1:07:02] condemned forgive and you shall be
[1:07:05] forgiven
[1:07:06] i want to live by this scripture right
[1:07:08] here
[1:07:10] all my judgmental critical thoughts i
[1:07:11] want god to take away
[1:07:13] i want to forgive everyone
[1:07:16] and let god judge who needs judged
[1:07:19] i don't want to judge anybody if my life
[1:07:23] and the words that i speak that are true
[1:07:25] if that judges them it's not me that's
[1:07:27] judging them i don't want to judge them
[1:07:29] it's their refusal to hear the word of
[1:07:31] god and refusing the life of god that'll
[1:07:34] judge him but it's not me that'll judge
[1:07:36] them amen
[1:07:37] because i will forgive everyone so that
[1:07:39] i can be forgiven i will not condemn so
[1:07:42] that i'm not condemned
[1:07:44] because listen i've said before you take
[1:07:47] if god lifts his hand off any of us for
[1:07:49] a day we will be screaming and begging
[1:07:52] for him to bring him back
[1:07:54] the thoughts of wickedness that go
[1:07:55] through your mind the lust of the flesh
[1:07:57] that would consume you if god lifted his
[1:07:59] hand off of you for a day you would be
[1:08:01] terrorized and screaming for mercy for
[1:08:04] god to put his hand back upon us
[1:08:07] i don't want to judge it's god's grace
[1:08:10] that holds me here
[1:08:11] i don't want to condemn i would be
[1:08:13] condemned because it's god's grace that
[1:08:15] holds me here
[1:08:17] let's go to matthew
[1:08:19] chapter 7.
[1:08:24] i said before i don't need to judge any
[1:08:26] man and say whether he's in or out or
[1:08:27] whether he'll make it or not god will
[1:08:29] take care of that it's not my i don't
[1:08:31] want the responsibility
[1:08:34] i would hate to have that responsibility
[1:08:36] let god sort those things out
[1:08:40] matthew chapter 7 verse 1
[1:08:43] it says judge not that you be not judged
[1:08:46] for with what judgment you judge you
[1:08:48] shall be judged and with what measure
[1:08:50] you meet it shall be measured to you
[1:08:52] again
[1:08:54] oh these are terrifying words
[1:08:57] to me these are terrifying words
[1:08:59] if you take a judgmental critical
[1:09:01] attitude that's going to come right back
[1:09:03] to you someday
[1:09:05] you just wait and see
[1:09:08] shall be measured to you again and why
[1:09:10] beholdest thou the mote that is in thy
[1:09:12] brother's eye but consider us not the
[1:09:14] beam that is in thine own eye or how
[1:09:16] wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull
[1:09:18] out the moat out of that eye and behold
[1:09:21] a beam is in thine own eye
[1:09:24] when i read this scripture i remember
[1:09:27] i remember with embarrassment
[1:09:30] my zealous days of first coming to the
[1:09:32] message
[1:09:33] when i was right and everybody else was
[1:09:36] wrong
[1:09:36] did anybody else have those days i hope
[1:09:38] i'm not the only person in the room i
[1:09:40] now knew the truth i now heard the word
[1:09:42] i now was right and i know what's wrong
[1:09:44] with the rest of the world and everybody
[1:09:45] else is wrong and i'm walking around
[1:09:47] with a beam in my eye trying to poke
[1:09:50] pluck motes out of everybody else's eye
[1:09:52] and then later in life when god begins
[1:09:54] to reveal your immaturity to you he
[1:09:56] reveals your pride to you he reveals an
[1:09:58] arrogant attitude to you he reveals how
[1:10:01] you had things wrong and how you had
[1:10:02] things not lined up in your life and
[1:10:04] he's constantly molding us and we
[1:10:06] constantly have things dropping off of
[1:10:08] our life and we look back and i don't
[1:10:10] know about you but i get that little
[1:10:12] shiver that goes up my spine when i'm
[1:10:13] embarrassed thinking oh i can't believe
[1:10:15] i did that
[1:10:16] i can't believe i said that well if that
[1:10:19] is true then could it be true today
[1:10:22] good to be something i'm missing in my
[1:10:24] own life where something in my life is
[1:10:25] not lining exactly to the will of god
[1:10:28] and i'm going around trying to fix
[1:10:30] everybody else and i'm the one still in
[1:10:32] need of fixing
[1:10:34] it's better to say god help me god help
[1:10:37] us all god help him god help me god help
[1:10:39] all of us amen we need help amen
[1:10:44] go to john chapter 3.
[1:10:55] john chapter 3
[1:10:57] 16.
[1:11:06] for god so loved the world
[1:11:08] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:11:11] that whosoever believeth
[1:11:13] in him should not perish but have
[1:11:14] everlasting life
[1:11:16] for god sent not his son into the world
[1:11:18] to condemn the world
[1:11:20] but that the world through him might be
[1:11:22] saved
[1:11:23] so what was god's motive condemnation or
[1:11:25] salvation his motive was salvation
[1:11:29] verse 18
[1:11:30] he that believeth on him is not
[1:11:32] condemned
[1:11:33] but he that believeth not is condemned
[1:11:36] already
[1:11:37] because he hath not believed in the name
[1:11:39] of the only begotten son of god
[1:11:42] and this is the condemnation that light
[1:11:44] has come into the world and men loved
[1:11:46] darkness rather than light because their
[1:11:49] deeds were evil for everyone that doeth
[1:11:51] evil hateth the light neither cometh to
[1:11:53] the light lest his deeds should be
[1:11:55] reproved but he that doeth truth cometh
[1:11:58] to the light that his deeds may be made
[1:12:00] manifest that they are rotten god
[1:12:04] so god never sent his son into the earth
[1:12:06] to condemn the world but that through
[1:12:08] him the world might be saved
[1:12:10] man condemns himself by not receiving
[1:12:13] god's light man because his
[1:12:16] deeds are evil he condemns the light he
[1:12:19] rejects the light and when he rejects
[1:12:21] the light he himself is rejected and he
[1:12:23] man has condemned himself by refusing
[1:12:26] god amen it wasn't even god condemning
[1:12:29] man man condemned himself by refusing
[1:12:31] the light
[1:12:34] amen
[1:12:35] let's go to john chapter 12.
[1:12:41] john chapter 12
[1:12:44] verse 44.
[1:12:47] john 12 and 44 jesus cried and said he
[1:12:50] that believeth on me believeth not on me
[1:12:52] but on him that sent me
[1:12:54] and he that seeth me seeth him that sent
[1:12:57] me
[1:12:58] says i am come a light unto the world
[1:13:01] that whosoever believeth on me should
[1:13:02] not abide in darkness
[1:13:04] and if any man hear my words and believe
[1:13:06] not i judge him not for i come not to
[1:13:09] judge the world but to save the world
[1:13:12] he that rejecteth me and receiveth not
[1:13:14] my words hath one that judgeth him the
[1:13:17] words that i have spoken the same shall
[1:13:20] judge him in the last day
[1:13:22] for i have not spoken of myself but the
[1:13:24] father which sent me
[1:13:26] he gave me a commandment what i should
[1:13:28] say and what i should speak and i know
[1:13:30] that his commandment is life everlasting
[1:13:34] whatsoever i speak therefore even as the
[1:13:36] father said unto unto me so i
[1:13:39] speak
[1:13:41] the commandment that was given to jesus
[1:13:43] that he gave out was life everlasting he
[1:13:45] was there giving life the jews in that
[1:13:48] day didn't want life they rejected life
[1:13:51] they rejected the light they rejected
[1:13:53] the life they rejected the word and he
[1:13:55] says i won't judge you
[1:13:58] but there'll be another judge you the
[1:14:00] words that i speak they shall judge you
[1:14:03] basically you have judged yourself by
[1:14:05] refusing this word that came from my
[1:14:07] father you refused the father's word and
[1:14:09] now you put yourself in judgment and the
[1:14:12] same thing applies to us we don't have
[1:14:14] our own word we have his word we're only
[1:14:16] speaking his word that's why the bride
[1:14:19] amen in revelation chapter 10 amen 8-11
[1:14:23] she is to take the book and eat the book
[1:14:25] and prophesy again she's not to have her
[1:14:28] own prophecy she's supposed to take the
[1:14:30] prophecy that's been given and prophesy
[1:14:33] again and the spirit of prophecy is the
[1:14:35] testimony of jesus christ
[1:14:38] so you see now that that it's not our
[1:14:42] word amen it's the father's word this
[1:14:44] was in the back part of god's mind he
[1:14:46] brought it down through a channel
[1:14:48] delivered to us and we're living
[1:14:49] according to his word we're speaking
[1:14:51] according to his word and now when
[1:14:53] that's rejected amen i don't judge you i
[1:14:56] don't i mean there was a time that i
[1:14:58] didn't think the message was right amen
[1:15:00] god had to quicken it inside of me so if
[1:15:02] you don't understand it i'm not going to
[1:15:04] judge you amen this is light if you
[1:15:06] continue to refuse the light amen you
[1:15:09] judge yourself but i don't want to judge
[1:15:11] you
[1:15:12] you've condemned yourself i don't
[1:15:15] condemn you amen in the end time amen
[1:15:17] god will raise up the bride and the end
[1:15:20] time amen in the judgment and she shall
[1:15:22] condemn this generation
[1:15:24] how will she condemn this generation
[1:15:26] because she kept the word she spoke the
[1:15:29] word she lived the word she preached the
[1:15:31] word amen she dressed like a lady amen
[1:15:34] he acted like a gentleman and then they
[1:15:36] lived before the people the way christ
[1:15:39] would live in your flesh and it becomes
[1:15:41] a sweet sound to those who love the word
[1:15:44] and it becomes destruction and judgment
[1:15:46] to those who hate the word
[1:15:49] but for us
[1:15:51] let's be like the queen of sheba
[1:15:54] just excited to hear his voice
[1:15:57] just happy to know the truth just
[1:16:00] willing to give up willing to sacrifice
[1:16:02] willing to travel willing to to risk
[1:16:05] danger to risk ridicule to risk
[1:16:08] persecution just to come to a greater
[1:16:10] than solomon amen let's be like those of
[1:16:13] nineveh who are happy to repent amen
[1:16:15] under the preaching of this prophet and
[1:16:17] surrender our lives and line up amen but
[1:16:20] but let's not be amen like the pharisee
[1:16:23] who goes into the temple and says i
[1:16:25] thank god that i fast twice a day i
[1:16:27] thank god this and i thank god i'm not
[1:16:29] like this publican
[1:16:32] and he was worse than the public and he
[1:16:35] was worse off than the publican because
[1:16:37] he but he thought because he could keep
[1:16:39] some traditional teaching and he could
[1:16:40] keep some rudiments of the scripture and
[1:16:42] he could have some obedience that he was
[1:16:44] better off he was like the rich young
[1:16:46] ruler who thought he should make it in
[1:16:48] based off his ability to live the life
[1:16:51] his parents raised him to live amen and
[1:16:53] thought he would be okay not realizing
[1:16:56] that in his heart there was a problem
[1:16:58] and he had to make a full surrender
[1:17:01] and he refused
[1:17:03] and he condemned himself
[1:17:06] let's not be like the pharisee but let's
[1:17:08] be like the queen of sheba
[1:17:11] i just got to hear the truth
[1:17:13] let's be like those are nineveh i just
[1:17:15] gotta line up to the word i just gotta
[1:17:17] repent under this preaching amen
[1:17:19] whatever the consequences in fallout are
[1:17:21] i'm not responsible for that that's not
[1:17:23] even my vision that's not even my
[1:17:25] purpose amen my purpose is just to
[1:17:27] repent under this preaching just to
[1:17:29] travel and hear this wisdom that come
[1:17:31] from solomon
[1:17:33] [Music]
[1:17:35] in that life surrendered
[1:17:38] that
[1:17:39] life lived
[1:17:41] will rise up in a generation and condemn
[1:17:43] a whole generation
[1:17:45] but not because we ever wanted to
[1:17:48] condemn a generation
[1:17:50] if there is a generation condemned
[1:17:52] they're condemned because they refused
[1:17:54] the light because they didn't love it
[1:17:56] and they didn't want it not because we
[1:17:58] did anything
[1:18:02] amen
[1:18:04] sometimes i
[1:18:05] i think sometimes people handle the word
[1:18:07] in a nasty arrogant way
[1:18:10] and the nasty hateful arrogant way of
[1:18:12] condemning and cutting and and you this
[1:18:15] and you that and and and say things
[1:18:17] about other churches and other uh
[1:18:19] denominations and nominal believers and
[1:18:22] and criticize and cut down and speak
[1:18:24] just harsh and evil
[1:18:26] and
[1:18:28] and i think why
[1:18:30] you handle the word so rough and when
[1:18:33] they reject what you're saying you say
[1:18:34] they rejected the word sometimes they
[1:18:36] haven't rejected the word sometimes they
[1:18:37] just rejected you
[1:18:40] and your attitude needed to be rejected
[1:18:43] they were right in rejecting you even
[1:18:46] though you were speaking true words amen
[1:18:49] you're not speaking it the way christ
[1:18:50] would speak it you're not speaking with
[1:18:52] the intent and purpose of the word amen
[1:18:54] and so sometimes i think we've we've
[1:18:56] passed righteous judgment when all that
[1:18:58] they've rejected was our hypocrisy and
[1:19:00] our arrogant attitude and then our
[1:19:02] self-righteousness is what was rejected
[1:19:04] not the word
[1:19:06] so i said god help me live the life that
[1:19:09] i never in myself cause somebody to
[1:19:11] refuse your word because of my actions
[1:19:14] because i don't believe they'll be
[1:19:16] condemned if it's my fault
[1:19:20] amen
[1:19:22] i said god just let me in simplicity and
[1:19:25] humility love you and your word more
[1:19:27] than anything else in this world
[1:19:29] and would you by your grace give me your
[1:19:32] spirit to help me to live this life and
[1:19:34] would you live it through me as i
[1:19:36] surrender to you daily
[1:19:38] i die daily i keep under my body amen i
[1:19:42] keep under my body unless i preach to
[1:19:45] others i should be a cast away i bring
[1:19:47] this flesh into subjection to that word
[1:19:49] amen because i love god and i want to
[1:19:52] surrender to the word and whatever you
[1:19:54] do with that that's up to you but i'm
[1:19:56] not looking forward to a day of judgment
[1:19:57] when i get to stand up and say you out
[1:20:00] you over here you're you remember what
[1:20:02] you said to me remember the conversation
[1:20:04] we had in the lunchroom
[1:20:06] 2018.
[1:20:09] i don't think that's what the queen of
[1:20:11] sheba is going to be doing
[1:20:14] i don't think that's what the men of
[1:20:15] nineveh are going to be doing
[1:20:17] i don't even think that's what the
[1:20:18] lord's going to be doing i think by the
[1:20:19] time we get to the white throne judgment
[1:20:21] and ev the secret of everybody's heart
[1:20:22] is before them
[1:20:24] i don't think there's going to be any
[1:20:25] questions there's not going to be any
[1:20:27] rebuttals there's not going to be any
[1:20:28] disagreements
[1:20:30] everybody will know
[1:20:33] let's go to acts chapter 13.
[1:20:49] acts chapter 13
[1:20:52] and verse 46.
[1:20:56] then paul and barnabas wax bold and said
[1:20:58] it was necessary that the word of god
[1:21:00] should first have been spoken to you
[1:21:03] but seeing you put it from you and judge
[1:21:05] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
[1:21:08] lo
[1:21:09] we turn to the gentiles
[1:21:12] paul never judged them unworthy of
[1:21:14] everlasting life paul said you judged
[1:21:17] yourself unworthy of everlasting life
[1:21:20] because jesus says the commandment of my
[1:21:22] father is life everlasting so the word i
[1:21:25] speak to you there is spirit and life
[1:21:27] and he gave that word to paul and paul
[1:21:29] was now giving out the word of the
[1:21:30] father and as he gave it out that word
[1:21:33] was life when they rejected that word
[1:21:35] they judged themselves unworthy of
[1:21:37] everlasting life it wasn't paul passing
[1:21:40] judgment it was the people passing
[1:21:42] judgment
[1:21:45] brother bram said in
[1:21:47] in the message revelation chapter four
[1:21:48] when he's preaching like we said before
[1:21:50] between the church ages before he gets
[1:21:52] to the seals after he's finished
[1:21:54] preaching the first three chapters of
[1:21:56] revelation he starts in 1961 preaching
[1:21:59] revelation chapter 4.
[1:22:01] and in part three of this message he
[1:22:02] said now the voice of the throne noticed
[1:22:05] the throne before the throne with seven
[1:22:07] stars the voice of the stars voices you
[1:22:10] see there was more in revelation 4 here
[1:22:12] of five we find out and out of the
[1:22:14] throne proceeded lightnings thunders and
[1:22:16] voices not one voice voices plural what
[1:22:20] was it god speaking to the church
[1:22:22] reflecting himself through the seven
[1:22:24] spirits when the true anointed of god
[1:22:26] speaks it is the voice of god
[1:22:29] to reject it is to remove the
[1:22:31] candlestick voices the voice of the
[1:22:33] seven church ages
[1:22:35] over here in the corner the is speaking
[1:22:38] with thunder and lightning
[1:22:40] he says now everybody can't be a
[1:22:42] preacher
[1:22:43] but you got a voice
[1:22:46] if you can't preach the people a sermon
[1:22:48] if you're a preacher you're called to
[1:22:49] the pulpit to preach if you're not
[1:22:51] you're still a preacher but live the
[1:22:53] people a sermon
[1:22:55] let your sermon be lived and it's the
[1:22:57] voice of god that'll bring reproach to
[1:22:59] them who reject it
[1:23:01] you hear that
[1:23:03] you live your sermon and it's the voice
[1:23:06] of god that'll bring reproach to them
[1:23:08] that reject it
[1:23:09] you don't have to reject anybody listen
[1:23:12] if somebody continually rejects you you
[1:23:15] don't have to reject them
[1:23:18] if somebody continually speaks evil of
[1:23:20] you you don't have to speak evil of them
[1:23:22] amen look at brother branham for our
[1:23:24] example he was ridiculed by other
[1:23:26] preachers he was mocked he was lied
[1:23:28] about he was spoke evil against but he
[1:23:30] never returned the favor he didn't
[1:23:33] condemn he didn't judge amen any time he
[1:23:36] passed a condemning condemning statement
[1:23:38] he made it a broad statement that would
[1:23:40] cover everybody in this category
[1:23:43] but he wasn't calling out you who could
[1:23:45] you who resisted me you who said this
[1:23:48] you're this and you're that amen brother
[1:23:50] branham when they would draw him out of
[1:23:51] the circle he would draw his circle
[1:23:53] bigger than include him back in he would
[1:23:55] forgive people who hadn't even
[1:23:57] apologized to him
[1:24:00] and he told us to do the same thing
[1:24:03] so when a man has done you wrong i mean
[1:24:05] really done wrong
[1:24:07] he said just forget about it
[1:24:09] just forgive him just move on amen i am
[1:24:13] not in the judging condemning business
[1:24:15] amen i want to be retired from that
[1:24:17] business i've taken that sword too many
[1:24:19] times and it leads nowhere but
[1:24:21] bitterness and corruption in my own
[1:24:23] heart i want to be say god have mercy
[1:24:25] god forgive god whatever whatever you
[1:24:28] can do for him do for him i'm it's in
[1:24:30] your hands not mine
[1:24:34] i've had to pray some hard prayers
[1:24:36] before going through some really
[1:24:38] difficult times when people would say
[1:24:40] things that were not true and people
[1:24:42] would uh you know try to defame your
[1:24:44] character and you go through some dark
[1:24:46] hours and bitterness tries to creep in
[1:24:48] your heart but you have to keep praying
[1:24:51] until you can forgive from your heart
[1:24:53] because if you cannot forgive not
[1:24:55] intellectually but from your heart amen
[1:24:58] you can forgive from your head because
[1:25:00] the bible says forgive
[1:25:02] if you don't forgive neither will i
[1:25:03] forgive
[1:25:05] so you can say intellectually i'm going
[1:25:07] to forgive them that's not going to work
[1:25:10] it says unless you can forgive from your
[1:25:12] heart amen you've got to pray until god
[1:25:15] can root that bitterness out of your
[1:25:17] heart and plug it out until you can
[1:25:19] forgive somebody who's done you wrong
[1:25:22] not say i forgive them but forgive them
[1:25:24] until you can get on your face and i've
[1:25:26] had to pray sometimes so i got to the
[1:25:28] place where i could get down and say god
[1:25:31] i don't want anything bad to happen to
[1:25:34] this brother what they did to me was
[1:25:36] completely wrong what they did was
[1:25:38] against the word but don't judge them
[1:25:41] for my sake if it's for me i forgive
[1:25:44] them and i ask you to forgive them too i
[1:25:46] don't hold them accountable i don't hold
[1:25:48] them guilty and i do not want you to
[1:25:50] judge them for what they did to
[1:25:52] me and when you can pray that way amen
[1:25:56] you know that that bitterness is leaving
[1:25:58] your heart when you can pray god to
[1:26:00] bless and forgive and look over
[1:26:02] somebody's sin when they've really done
[1:26:04] you wrong
[1:26:06] but that's exactly what jesus was able
[1:26:08] to do nailed to a cross he was able to
[1:26:10] look down against those that mocked him
[1:26:12] laughed at him spit upon him beat him
[1:26:15] wagged their heads and mocked him as a
[1:26:17] as a king and as a prophet amen and he
[1:26:20] said father forgive them
[1:26:23] for they don't know what they're doing
[1:26:24] stephen was able to do the same thing
[1:26:26] amen in the face of an angry crowd who
[1:26:28] hated him for what he believed wanted to
[1:26:31] kill him because he spoke the truth amen
[1:26:33] they were taking up stones to stone him
[1:26:35] and he said father lay not this sin to
[1:26:37] their charge
[1:26:40] that's true forgiveness
[1:26:42] [Music]
[1:26:44] when you say i forgive somebody but do
[1:26:46] they got it coming
[1:26:49] that's not forgiveness
[1:26:51] you say i forgive them but they better
[1:26:53] watch out god's going to get them
[1:26:57] true forgiveness is when you can stand
[1:26:58] in the gap for them and say god
[1:27:01] when you can recognize no matter how
[1:27:03] wrong they've done you that you could do
[1:27:06] that to somebody else if god didn't help
[1:27:08] you
[1:27:10] that i've spoke evil about people before
[1:27:12] i've gossiped about people before i've
[1:27:14] said things that painted people in a bad
[1:27:16] light i'm just as wicked as any other
[1:27:19] human being as wicked it's the grace of
[1:27:22] god in my life how can i condemn another
[1:27:24] human being
[1:27:27] till we can get to be a place of mercy
[1:27:31] love
[1:27:32] forgiveness
[1:27:33] and stand like jesus and say god forgive
[1:27:36] them
[1:27:37] they don't know what they're doing
[1:27:40] they don't mean it lord
[1:27:41] let them go that's what jesus did for
[1:27:43] his wife or is what brother ben did for
[1:27:45] his wife he's out washing his car she
[1:27:47] slammed the door in his face she said
[1:27:48] something short with him slammed the
[1:27:50] door in his face and brother was washing
[1:27:51] the car and said god forgive her she
[1:27:53] didn't mean it
[1:27:55] she don't mean that lord
[1:27:58] see god had to pass a judgment anyways
[1:28:01] and there was a tumor that began to grow
[1:28:03] but not because brother branham wanted
[1:28:05] it and not because god brother ben was
[1:28:06] hoping that god would correct his wife
[1:28:08] he was interceding for and said god she
[1:28:10] didn't mean it
[1:28:11] forgive her lord she's under so much
[1:28:13] stress she stands and he becomes the
[1:28:15] intercessor for the one who's wronged
[1:28:17] him
[1:28:19] that's the real attitude friends that's
[1:28:21] the real approach
[1:28:23] amen
[1:28:25] i don't want to be a judge i want to be
[1:28:27] an intercessor
[1:28:29] i don't want to be a condemner i want to
[1:28:31] be a forgiver
[1:28:32] and i know that god will do whatever god
[1:28:35] must do and i know that my life if god
[1:28:38] through through me through the grace
[1:28:40] that he's put in my life allows me to
[1:28:42] line to the word and live it and preach
[1:28:43] it true i know that that life will be
[1:28:46] condemnation judgment to others but not
[1:28:49] because i want it to be that way but
[1:28:51] because it has to be that way what i
[1:28:53] want is god to forgive everybody
[1:28:56] i think that's the right
[1:28:58] spirit that's the right approach
[1:29:01] so is this the hour of judgment yes if
[1:29:03] judgments begin upon the earth yes has
[1:29:04] mercy been spurned yes
[1:29:06] but i pray there's some mercy left
[1:29:10] as long as i'm here upon this earth i
[1:29:12] pray that my life can get can sing a
[1:29:16] sweet rippling sound of a brook to
[1:29:18] somebody i don't want my life to be
[1:29:20] judgment and condemnation to everyone
[1:29:23] i wanted to bring life to somebody
[1:29:28] he said
[1:29:30] brother brahms going on in the same
[1:29:31] quote
[1:29:33] he said the voice of god
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:37] that'll bring reproach to them who
[1:29:39] reject it he said let your sermon be
[1:29:41] lived and it's the voice of god that'll
[1:29:43] bring reproach to them who reject it
[1:29:44] they say no one could put a finger on
[1:29:46] his or her life they're sweet living if
[1:29:49] there ever was a man of god it's that
[1:29:51] man or that woman see live your sermons

[1:29:59] up and you'll get people tangled up and
[1:30:01] you won't know well you'll ruin them and
[1:30:04] yourself too just live your sermon

[1:32:28] devil bait
[1:32:31] but what will shake his kingdom
[1:32:34] is that life
[1:32:36] this message came to produce the life of
[1:32:39] christ in a bride
[1:32:41] that's the purpose of the message
[1:32:43] and i want the purpose of the message to
[1:32:46] take root in my life

[1:32:50] that message
[1:32:54] amen
[1:32:57] let's go to 2nd thessalonians chapter 2.
[1:33:08] second thessalonians
[1:33:11] chapter two
[1:33:24] thessalonians 2 and verse 7.
[1:33:29] for the mystery of iniquity doth already
[1:33:30] work
[1:33:31] only he who now letteth will let until
[1:33:34] he be taken
[1:33:35] out of the way
[1:33:38] this word he who now letteth the word
[1:33:40] letteth means to hold fast to possess
[1:33:44] to hold back to detain to retain
[1:33:48] to restrain to hinder
[1:33:51] the course of progress that which
[1:33:53] hinders antichrist from making his
[1:33:55] appearance
[1:33:56] so
[1:33:57] there's a there is a force that is
[1:34:00] hindering or letting or holding back
[1:34:03] brother branham
[1:34:05] speaks of this verse in the first seal
[1:34:07] it says for the mystery of iniquity doth
[1:34:09] already work deceivers you see deceiving
[1:34:12] the people often to something see
[1:34:14] only he
[1:34:15] god
[1:34:16] that letteth will let until he
[1:34:19] the church christ the bride
[1:34:22] be taken out of the way let's read that
[1:34:24] together let's follow along in ii
[1:34:26] thessalonians
[1:34:28] 7. i want you to read it in your bible
[1:34:30] go to the part it says only he who now
[1:34:32] letteth will let until he be taken out
[1:34:35] of the way and let's let brother branham
[1:34:36] interpret these two he's to us
[1:34:39] he says only he
[1:34:41] god
[1:34:43] who letteth will let until he the church
[1:34:46] christ the bride
[1:34:48] be taken out of the way
[1:34:52] what a statement my after the bride is
[1:34:54] taken away then this man of sin will
[1:34:57] reveal himself she the true bride of
[1:34:59] christ has been elected out of every
[1:35:01] church age
[1:35:02] so now he that letteth
[1:35:06] will let till he be taken out of the way
[1:35:08] god is holding something back amen as
[1:35:12] long as christ in the bride is here
[1:35:15] something's being restrained something's
[1:35:17] being hindered something's being held
[1:35:19] back and limited amen but when when
[1:35:21] christ and the bride depart amen then
[1:35:24] something is unleashed amen so our very
[1:35:27] presence here with christ in the midst
[1:35:29] of the seven golden candlesticks in this
[1:35:31] day is actually hindering the progress
[1:35:34] of antichrist to fully launching his
[1:35:36] whole plan and in all of his deeds and i
[1:35:39] say praise god amen if it takes me
[1:35:41] remaining here to hold that back for one
[1:35:44] more person to make it in then i'm no
[1:35:46] longer going to to be contrary and angry
[1:35:48] and upset that i'm still here let me
[1:35:51] stay here and let me shine the light and
[1:35:53] let me thunder against the devil as long
[1:35:55] as there's a restraint on the antichrist
[1:35:57] system
[1:36:00] that's when they asked they asked
[1:36:01] brother branham and questions in answers
[1:36:03] in 64 said after the bride is raptured
[1:36:06] will any of the foolish virgins be saved
[1:36:08] or will they all be lost it says no see
[1:36:11] everything will be finished for the
[1:36:12] gentile church when the bride is taken
[1:36:14] from the earth
[1:36:16] the spirit of god leaves the earth
[1:36:19] he that's filthy is filthy still he
[1:36:21] that's righteous is righteous still he
[1:36:23] that's holy is holy still
[1:36:25] in other words the sanctuary became
[1:36:27] smokey the attorney stands to plead the
[1:36:29] case christ leaves the sanctuary his
[1:36:31] days of media turns over the rapture
[1:36:33] comes he leaves from the sanctuary goes
[1:36:35] forth takes the book of redemption
[1:36:37] claims everything he redeemed there's no
[1:36:39] more mediatorial work how many
[1:36:41] understand that i got into one of the
[1:36:42] seals yeah the seals i believe that was
[1:36:45] that christ comes forth to claim his
[1:36:46] mediator work now just a minute will the
[1:36:49] foolish virgin be saved no whatever
[1:36:51] happens happens now after that time
[1:36:54] she's in the state
[1:36:56] so what he's saying is in this
[1:36:58] transition period
[1:37:00] when judgment has come amen when he's
[1:37:02] come to claim
[1:37:04] his inheritance he's in the claiming
[1:37:05] ministry now and he's come as the white
[1:37:08] wigged one in this interim as long as
[1:37:10] the bride is still here amen the spirit
[1:37:13] of god is still present amen and
[1:37:15] whatever happens now whatever choices
[1:37:18] are made in the foolish virgin now amen
[1:37:20] once the bride leaves the spirit of god
[1:37:22] leaves the earth and then it's set it's
[1:37:24] fixed and it's not changing
[1:37:27] so that means while the bride is here
[1:37:29] there is still a chance not just for the
[1:37:32] elect but also for the foolish virgin
[1:37:34] and also for them that would do good to
[1:37:36] the bride
[1:37:38] and i said god let my life shine such a
[1:37:42] lie that somebody will find entrance
[1:37:44] into that great kingdom
[1:37:46] at the end of time
[1:37:48] amen let me stand here as an intercessor
[1:37:51] let me stand here as an open door to the
[1:37:53] ark amen not judging everybody's gone
[1:37:56] we're the only ones that got it
[1:37:57] everybody's failed it's just me but oh
[1:38:00] god if i'm one of them let my life have
[1:38:03] an effect on this one and that one and
[1:38:05] this one and that one while your spirit
[1:38:07] remains while mercy's available while
[1:38:09] the door is open let something be done
[1:38:12] because when the bride leaves there's no
[1:38:14] more chance for any gentile to change
[1:38:16] their status
[1:38:18] what they are is what they are
[1:38:22] and it's fixed
[1:38:24] but i remember saying christ is the
[1:38:26] mystery of god revealed he said that's
[1:38:27] christ in the church today taking his
[1:38:29] wife back see the threefold mystery now

[1:39:25] condemnation and judgment god will take
[1:39:27] care of that those things must be it has
[1:39:29] to be he has to purge and rid his
[1:39:31] kingdom of everything that doesn't love

[1:39:37] i'm not going to stand there joyful amen
[1:39:40] watching multitudes go off into oblivion
[1:39:42] into the lake of fire that's not my
[1:39:44] desire it's not what i want what i'm
[1:39:46] watching for at the white throne
[1:39:48] judgment is that one that i know can
[1:39:51] receive a reward amen that one that i
[1:39:53] know that can receive life that one that
[1:39:55] i know that made it amen because i held
[1:39:58] a testimony because i shined the life
[1:40:00] and to them amen they didn't hate it
[1:40:03] they didn't reject it they may not have
[1:40:05] understood it they may not have been
[1:40:06] able to receive it but they didn't hate
[1:40:07] it and they didn't reject it
[1:40:13] praise god
[1:40:17] brother ben said
[1:40:19] christ the mystery of god revealed again
[1:40:20] he says but when the current is flowing
[1:40:22] freely
[1:40:23] the word of god it expresses itself the
[1:40:25] works that i do shall you do also and in
[1:40:28] the last days shall come to pass behold
[1:40:30] i send to you elijah the prophet you
[1:40:32] shall learn the hearts of the children
[1:40:33] back to the faith of the fathers and
[1:40:36] then there there would be a time come
[1:40:38] forth when he would express himself in
[1:40:40] fullness of his godhead deity through
[1:40:42] his church having the preeminence in his
[1:40:45] church oh my
[1:40:46] what the anointed man now the anointed
[1:40:49] people oh my to bring back the anointed
[1:40:52] bride and bridegroom anointed by why
[1:40:54] accepting what eve turned down and adam
[1:40:56] coming back with the anointing of the
[1:40:58] word because he said my word is spirit
[1:41:01] see anointed with the word what eve
[1:41:04] turned down he comes back and we accept
[1:41:08] see how the hybrid condition again just
[1:41:10] exactly what he'd done he done eve he
[1:41:13] told eve don't you do this and don't you
[1:41:14] do that and you can do this and that and
[1:41:17] satan said oh you know
[1:41:19] but she turned around and listened to
[1:41:20] him
[1:41:21] but the even the last day
[1:41:24] is not going to do it
[1:41:27] because
[1:41:28] she's predestinated not too
[1:41:32] it's not our willpower and our strength
[1:41:34] but it's his predestination it's his
[1:41:36] will power and his strength
[1:41:39] but the eve
[1:41:40] in the last day
[1:41:42] is not going to do it because she's
[1:41:44] predestinated not to
[1:41:46] yes sir god's going to do it he knows
[1:41:49] he'll have it
[1:41:52] what in the world can we take pride in
[1:41:56] he'll do it he'll have it
[1:41:58] it's his will
[1:42:01] he said church would be there without
[1:42:04] spot or wrinkle she is going to stand
[1:42:06] there in the splendor of him his word
[1:42:08] made manifest
[1:42:10] shall be a token to the world
[1:42:13] she'll be a nix he stopped he was going
[1:42:15] to say example she'll be an ex she'll be
[1:42:18] something to the world that the world
[1:42:19] can look at
[1:42:21] and say well the rest of the world might
[1:42:23] say oh she's a holy roller she's a
[1:42:25] second cousin she don't belong to our
[1:42:26] group i know that that's a good thing
[1:42:28] see she belongs to this group up here
[1:42:32] but in the end time this bride
[1:42:34] in the full glow of the light of the
[1:42:36] seven
[1:42:37] ages and the seven golden candlesticks
[1:42:39] with the judge in her midst
[1:42:41] she will be a token to the world
[1:42:44] an example that they can look at some
[1:42:46] will speak evil against it some will
[1:42:48] reject it but not all will
[1:42:51] and in the day of judgment some
[1:42:53] will receive life
[1:42:55] because of the word that they respected
[1:42:57] coming through your life
[1:43:02] brother brahma said back in the church
[1:43:04] age book
[1:43:05] he said there he stands
[1:43:07] one like unto the son of man as the
[1:43:09] jewel
[1:43:10] is beautified by the mounting of the
[1:43:12] ring
[1:43:13] so he is glorified in the midst of the
[1:43:15] churches
[1:43:17] it is the lord's day for john sees him
[1:43:19] standing not as a priest but as the
[1:43:21] coming judge the golden girdle is no
[1:43:23] longer girded around the waist where the
[1:43:25] priest must wear it as he ministers to
[1:43:27] god in the holiest place but it is now
[1:43:29] around his shoulders for he is not now
[1:43:32] the priest
[1:43:33] but the judge
[1:43:35] and as the judge as the jewel is
[1:43:38] beautified by the mounting of the ring
[1:43:40] so he is glorified in the midst of the
[1:43:42] churches
[1:43:44] this is where he wants to display
[1:43:45] himself in the end time
[1:43:48] he wants to come one with the end time
[1:43:50] bride and he wants to manifest himself
[1:43:52] in her until the two become one
[1:43:56] and is it a judgment it's a judgment
[1:44:00] will it condemn the world it is
[1:44:02] absolutely condemning the world
[1:44:05] but i pray and hope it's not condemning
[1:44:07] the whole world
[1:44:08] i hope some are coming to salvation
[1:44:12] is it judgment time yes are judgments in
[1:44:15] the earth yes
[1:44:17] are the people being judged by how they
[1:44:19] received the word in bright form yes
[1:44:22] but oh may some find it a reward on the
[1:44:25] day of judgment for how they receive the
[1:44:27] word in bride form
[1:44:29] and if there's any elect seed out there
[1:44:31] may the light that's shining from this
[1:44:33] bride from this word in this day made
[1:44:35] manifest may it strike the seed and
[1:44:38] though the dirt rejects it and finds it
[1:44:40] uncomfortable may the seed find it
[1:44:42] warming and powerful bringing life to
[1:44:44] the seed may our life and the light
[1:44:47] shining through us and the word coming
[1:44:48] through us may it produce that result on
[1:44:51] the seed of god so they can spring to
[1:44:52] life
[1:44:54] praise god
[1:44:56] it's judgment time
[1:44:58] but i'm not interested in judging
[1:45:00] anybody
[1:45:01] it's a judgment cycle it's a judgment
[1:45:03] season but i'm not interested in judging
[1:45:05] anyone i want i want somebody to find
[1:45:09] mercy
[1:45:11] i want as long as as i'm here as part of
[1:45:14] the bride present on earth and the holy
[1:45:16] ghost is here and the bride is the blood
[1:45:18] by the spirit i want there to be an
[1:45:20] opportunity for somebody i want to live
[1:45:22] the life not the judge i want to live
[1:45:24] the life to give life
[1:45:26] i want to live the life to share life i
[1:45:29] don't want to live the life to condemn
[1:45:31] to death
[1:45:32] our motivation and our purpose in
[1:45:34] everything is for life
[1:45:37] the word came for life the word was
[1:45:39] restored for life he is a tree of life
[1:45:42] she is a tree of life restored back to
[1:45:44] him the bride tree is a tree of life
[1:45:46] light that's illuminating this age is
[1:45:48] the life of men light is life the water
[1:45:52] is life it's all about life and you and
[1:45:55] i are here for life
[1:45:57] the world will be judged because they
[1:45:59] didn't want the life
[1:46:01] they'll be judged because they rejected
[1:46:03] the life
[1:46:04] but we are here for life
[1:46:07] and let our life be lived
[1:46:10] to impart eternal life to somebody else
[1:46:13] may our life be lived to shine the light
[1:46:16] without compromise because if a light is
[1:46:19] lit and hit under a bushel basket what
[1:46:21] good does it do man if we live in
[1:46:23] compromised water we withholding from
[1:46:25] others if we live and speak in a
[1:46:27] compromising way how will others find
[1:46:29] their way to light how will life come
[1:46:32] forth no we must stand in the full glory
[1:46:34] and splendor of him by full obedience to
[1:46:37] his word we must let the light shine in
[1:46:39] its full magnitude in power
[1:46:42] compromise withholds life
[1:46:44] let's live an uncompromised undefiled
[1:46:47] life by the holy ghost and let that
[1:46:50] light bring life
[1:46:52] to somebody
[1:46:54] and if somebody is judged it's because
[1:46:57] they judged themselves because they
[1:46:59] didn't want the light not because i
[1:47:01] judged them
[1:47:03] but because they judged themselves
[1:47:05] by the time we get to the white throne
[1:47:07] judgment
[1:47:08] everything's already finished the deeds
[1:47:10] are done
[1:47:11] everybody's already in one category
[1:47:14] another amen the white throne judgment
[1:47:16] is where the reward is given out for the
[1:47:18] deeds done amen it's already sorted out
[1:47:22] people have already made the decision in
[1:47:23] their lifetime they've already met the
[1:47:25] two trees in the garden they've already
[1:47:27] made their choice
[1:47:30] and then it's just going to be the
[1:47:32] movement of categories
[1:47:34] and however it works i don't know how to
[1:47:36] work in that day
[1:47:38] but the judgment is going on now
[1:47:41] the sentencing will take place in the
[1:47:43] future
[1:47:45] and i say god
[1:47:47] let me live
[1:47:49] for life
[1:47:51] not live for judgment
[1:47:53] but let me live for life
[1:47:55] and part of that
[1:47:57] is judgment it is a judging time
[1:48:01] but i'm focused as the queen of sheba
[1:48:03] was on getting to the greater than
[1:48:05] solomon
[1:48:08] my focus is as the nineveh were to
[1:48:11] repent under the preaching of this
[1:48:12] prophet and line up to his word
[1:48:14] that's what i want what god uses that
[1:48:17] for and in judgment and in mercy is up
[1:48:20] to him
[1:48:21] but my motivation is to repent my
[1:48:24] motivation is to sell everything and
[1:48:27] obtain this pearl of great price
[1:48:30] praise god let's all stand
[1:48:34] so in the hour of judgment
[1:48:36] i think it's important to have the right
[1:48:38] attitude
[1:48:39] because the right attitude
[1:48:41] can bring life
[1:48:44] and the wrong attitude doesn't bring
[1:48:46] anything to anyone
[1:48:49] but condemnation
[1:48:50] and musicians if you'll make your way up
[1:48:53] let's pray lord jesus we thank you
[1:48:55] father
[1:48:56] then in the hour of trouble that's upon
[1:48:58] the earth
[1:49:00] god i think of my own life
[1:49:03] after the prophet through the stone in
[1:49:04] the air
[1:49:06] after he declared that mercy has been
[1:49:08] spurned and were entering into judgment
[1:49:11] many years after that i was born
[1:49:14] after the time of judgment was upon the
[1:49:17] earth after the earth was in a desert
[1:49:20] condition spiritually speaking after
[1:49:22] darkness and gross darkness are on the
[1:49:24] people
[1:49:25] after all of that
[1:49:26] i was born and lived 20 something years
[1:49:30] and after all of that time you still
[1:49:33] knew how to find me lord
[1:49:35] you still brought a life with a light in
[1:49:39] my path and i could see the light and i
[1:49:41] could hear the words that were spoken
[1:49:43] and it became a light that brought life
[1:49:45] to a seed within me and if you can do
[1:49:48] that for me you could do it for somebody
[1:49:50] else lord it's not too late i pray it's
[1:49:52] not too late lord i i don't want it to
[1:49:55] be too late i ask god what you've done
[1:49:57] for me so many years after we've entered
[1:50:00] to a judgment cycle lord it's been many
[1:50:03] years since but may there still be life
[1:50:06] available to people
[1:50:08] may there still be a light shining and a
[1:50:10] pure word preached that'll give life to
[1:50:13] multitudes of people
[1:50:15] god let our life be the right reflection
[1:50:18] let it be the right light let us
[1:50:19] surrender more than we've ever
[1:50:21] surrendered before
[1:50:23] for god it's your mercy it's your grace
[1:50:25] lord it's your goodness to us that's
[1:50:27] brought us here
[1:50:29] and god shine through us the light
[1:50:32] and may somebody find that light
[1:50:35] and in that light may they find life
[1:50:38] everlasting
[1:50:40] we love you father
[1:50:41] we thank you for being amongst
[1:50:43] your people
[1:50:45] may you find welcome amongst us lord
[1:50:48] may you find us carrying you in our
[1:50:50] hearts and your word and our hearts with
[1:50:52] the right attitude with the right
[1:50:54] approach towards people with the right
[1:50:55] approach towards life
[1:50:57] may we reflect your character may we
[1:50:59] reflect your attitude may we reflect you
[1:51:02] in every way
[1:51:04] forgive us where we've been critical
[1:51:06] forgive us where we've been judgmental
[1:51:08] lord purges of those things
[1:51:11] wash it out of us lord and make us lord
[1:51:14] to carry your very nature the nature of
[1:51:16] the word the nature of the seed may it
[1:51:18] take preeminence over every part of our
[1:51:21] lives over our thinking over our speech
[1:51:24] over our emotions over our reactions may
[1:51:26] your word take precedent may you have
[1:51:29] absolute authority in our lives
[1:51:32] we love you lord
[1:51:34] i pray god as long as the doors open may
[1:51:37] you be seeking souls
[1:51:39] souls that might live on beyond time
[1:51:42] whether in the city or out of the city
[1:51:44] as long as they have life
[1:51:46] be on time
[1:51:48] we could have fellowship together
[1:51:50] i pray god that you would do what you
[1:51:52] can do that your word as a mighty power
[1:51:55] as a mighty light can go out
[1:51:57] and find everyone and place everyone in
[1:51:59] their position
[1:52:01] for it's all in your hands and you know
[1:52:03] what is right and you know what is
[1:52:04] righteous and we submit to your
[1:52:06] leadership in all things
[1:52:08] have your way with us o god and use us
[1:52:11] in this end time to finish your purpose
[1:52:14] amongst the gentiles
[1:52:16] in jesus christ's name we pray
[1:52:19] amen
[1:52:20] and god bless you brother john

[1:52:45] o
[1:52:46] shine
[1:52:48] through me
[1:52:50] o
[1:52:51] shine
[1:52:54] through me
[1:52:56] let the light
[1:52:59] of the lighthouse
[1:53:03] shine
[1:53:05] through me
[1:53:08] o live
[1:53:10] through
[1:53:19] [Music]
[1:53:33] through me
[1:53:36] lord
[1:53:40] me
[1:53:41] let the light
[1:53:44] from the lighthouse
[1:53:49] live through me
[1:53:54] you know and
[1:53:55] in the great judgments of god
[1:53:59] god is going to bring
[1:54:02] every circumstance
[1:54:05] to his word
[1:54:07] so that there is no excuse on the day of
[1:54:09] judgment
[1:54:11] somebody will say you know
[1:54:13] but god i was handicapped and i i
[1:54:16] couldn't serve you he'll have somebody
[1:54:18] in his bride who was handicapped and
[1:54:20] served
[1:54:22] but god i didn't live near a church i
[1:54:24] couldn't drive two hours so have
[1:54:25] somebody who will drive two hours to
[1:54:27] hear the word
[1:54:29] to show that
[1:54:31] that's no excuse
[1:54:33] you know somebody says you know if you
[1:54:35] knew what religious abuse i came from
[1:54:38] he'll have somebody in the bride who's
[1:54:39] come through religious abuse
[1:54:42] and surrender to the word there'll be no
[1:54:44] excuse on that day he said well i was
[1:54:46] neglected of my father if somebody was
[1:54:48] neglected of the father i was abused by
[1:54:50] my mother he'll have somebody who was
[1:54:51] abused by their mother
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:54:54] just like you have somebody that will
[1:54:56] traverse the sands and deserts and
[1:54:58] robbers to come see solomon to stand as
[1:55:01] a testimony against a generation
[1:55:04] he'll have somebody who's went through
[1:55:06] persecution
[1:55:07] rejection abuse
[1:55:10] fallen pastors and and all kinds of uh
[1:55:13] troubles and and all kinds of violence
[1:55:16] and
[1:55:17] and rejection and neglect
[1:55:19] he'll let all of that come
[1:55:21] to show that my word was enough
[1:55:25] that it would work
[1:55:26] and there's no excuse on that day nobody
[1:55:28] will have an excuse
[1:55:30] and we didn't drive two hours for that
[1:55:33] reason and we didn't we didn't overcome
[1:55:35] by god's grace uh rejection in complexes
[1:55:39] and and neglect and abuse
[1:55:41] we did it because we loved him and we
[1:55:43] found his grace sufficient for us
[1:55:46] we did it because we were so happy that
[1:55:48] there was a word that can deliver us we
[1:55:50] came to him because he was our only
[1:55:51] option and our only source we gave him
[1:55:53] our life because for us it was a great
[1:55:56] exchange my life for eternal life my
[1:55:58] life for his it was an easy exchange for
[1:56:01] us
[1:56:02] but that very act
[1:56:05] amen will be condemnation for somebody
[1:56:07] who tries to use that same excuse for
[1:56:09] why they couldn't serve god
[1:56:11] and we never meant it for that we just
[1:56:13] lived the life he called us to
[1:56:16] we just lived grateful we lived for him
[1:56:17] we surrendered him because we had to
[1:56:19] because he put something in us that
[1:56:21] would live that way
[1:56:24] and i said let the word work in our
[1:56:26] lives
[1:56:27] and let it shine the light
[1:56:30] and everybody else
[1:56:32] just love them
[1:56:34] love them
[1:56:36] if i'm going to be guilty for anything
[1:56:39] i want to be guilty for being too kind
[1:56:42] too loving too generous and too merciful
[1:56:47] i don't want to be guilty of being too
[1:56:48] judgmental too critical
[1:56:52] if i'm going to make a mistake i want to
[1:56:54] make a mistake in being too kind
[1:56:57] and too loving
[1:56:58] and too generous
[1:57:01] god will sort everything out and make
[1:57:03] everything right on that day i don't
[1:57:04] have to sort it out today
[1:57:07] i don't have to figure it out
[1:57:09] i don't have to figure out the
[1:57:10] destination of all men and by the
[1:57:12] actions they commit where they fit in
[1:57:15] god will figure all that out
[1:57:17] i just want to love everybody
[1:57:19] because that person who's vile today
[1:57:21] could be my brother tomorrow
[1:57:24] that person who is living ungodly amen
[1:57:27] tomorrow could be sitting in the pew
[1:57:29] next to me the one that i hugged her
[1:57:30] neck every service i don't want to treat
[1:57:32] him bad i don't want to speak evil god
[1:57:35] will sort all that out
[1:57:37] my advice
[1:57:39] is let's love everybody
[1:57:41] let's do whatever we can for anybody
[1:57:43] brother bam said if i can do anything to
[1:57:45] make the life of another human being
[1:57:47] better that's what i want to do
[1:57:50] he spent himself to pray for sick people
[1:57:53] who would reject his ministry but he had
[1:57:56] the gift in his life and he was willing
[1:57:57] to give it out
[1:58:00] jesus's gift
[1:58:01] he never used his gift to deliver
[1:58:03] himself in the temptation in the
[1:58:05] wilderness he never used his gift or his
[1:58:07] power to deliver himself from calvary
[1:58:09] but he always used his gift and his
[1:58:12] power on others
[1:58:14] when they were coming to arrest him
[1:58:17] to destroy his lies
[1:58:19] to murder him to unjustly amen peter
[1:58:23] drew out a sword and cut off the ear of
[1:58:25] the high priest servant and jesus had
[1:58:27] the power to deliver himself he had the
[1:58:29] power to smite him dead at one of his
[1:58:31] words they all fell over
[1:58:35] he had all power but he didn't use his
[1:58:37] power for him he used his power to heal
[1:58:40] the servant of the high priest
[1:58:43] brother branham stood in a pulpit so
[1:58:45] weak
[1:58:46] he could hardly stand but he had
[1:58:48] compassion on the people and prayed for
[1:58:50] them
[1:58:52] he used his gift for others not on
[1:58:54] himself
[1:58:56] brother abraham said living for others
[1:58:59] is looking heaven in the face
[1:59:02] there's an eternal quality
[1:59:04] to living for somebody else's benefit
[1:59:07] for somebody else's life or somebody
[1:59:09] else's betterment
[1:59:11] i say god help me to follow the example
[1:59:14] of the prophet of this age
[1:59:16] and help me to follow example of our
[1:59:18] lord
[1:59:19] and the saints through time
[1:59:22] amen
[1:59:24] i'm not what i used to be
[1:59:27] sure not what i ought to be
[1:59:30] but i thank god i'm not what i used to
[1:59:33] be
[1:59:34] and he has brought us this far
[1:59:36] i believe with all my heart if we catch
[1:59:38] this word the right way with the right
[1:59:41] spirit
[1:59:42] that we will emulate that life

[1:59:47] we're not where we ought to be but we're
[1:59:49] not where we used to be
[1:59:51] and thank god the word that brought me
[1:59:53] from there to here i believe that word
[1:59:55] will take me from here to living that
[1:59:58] life of christ
[1:59:59] and that's my goal in this life
[2:00:02] to surrender all
[2:00:04] and to manifest that life
