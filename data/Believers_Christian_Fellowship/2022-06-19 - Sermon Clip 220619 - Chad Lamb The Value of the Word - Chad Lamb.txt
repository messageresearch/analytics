========================================

he's giving us a clear understanding he says they're talking about revivals amen and in his day they were trying to revive the azusa street revival the the outpouring of the gifts from 1906 and they were looking for that kind of revival that there'd be a pentecostal revival again and brother branham says there hasn't been a revival amen there hasn't been a stirring yet we've had millions and millions but no revival yet so what is revival revival then is not a crowd revival is not a week-long sermons we're not revival is not an avengers in the pulpit none of that is revival because brother brahm they the pentecostals had all of that amen during those revivals they would have manifestations they would have enthusiasm they would have good preaching they would have ecstatic worship they would have but brother bam said none of that's a revival yet here's what he goes on to say the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifestation of god to stir the bride yet so that means all of those things that through the 50s and 60s they were calling revivals weren't revivals that would stir the bride and he said there's been no revival there no manifestation of god to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it probably now is bringing some clarity to the pentecostals in that day and he even begins and we'll read a quote in a minute he even has good friends and saying revival in our time revival in our time we'll read that quote next and he says but but that's there's been no revival there's been no revival for the bride there's been no stirring of the bride there's been no manifestation of god to wake her up yet although there's been all kinds of exciting things take place even in brother bannon's ministry there was like five exciting things that took place but nothing to wake up the bride yet first and second paul didn't wake her up it attracted her attention but didn't wake her up amen there had to come something and brother venom said it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again what is those seven thunders a revelation of the word there's a mystery in the word that has to come and when the word comes it'll wake her up that's the revival she's waiting for amen not a revival of a stirring not a revival of noise not a revival of a crowd not a week-long services she was waiting for the word to come back and when the word came back that's what would bring the bride back the word is everything friends
