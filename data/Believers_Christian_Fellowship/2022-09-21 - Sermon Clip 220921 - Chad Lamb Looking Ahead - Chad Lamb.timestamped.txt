[0:00] one thing I love about the prophet of
[0:03] God Amen is he was so real and he was so
[0:06] normal
[0:07] he wasn't a super spiritualist into
[0:10] fanaticism he was a normal person
[0:13] and he acted in a normal way you could
[0:15] relate to him because he wasn't a
[0:17] fanatic amen he wasn't he wasn't trying
[0:19] to confess that he never had problems
[0:21] but he realized he even said now he said
[0:24] we got these aches and pains and we know
[0:26] as we get older these things will come
[0:30] this is a man who preached Divine
[0:31] Healing and had a gift of healing in his
[0:34] life there was a minister to him by an
[0:35] Angel and he's admitting the reality of
[0:38] life is as we get older these things
[0:40] must come on and they'll come more and
[0:42] more as we as we age and he says and he
[0:46] says I just hope God gives me strength
[0:48] to endure it
[0:53] he's not even saying oh I'll never have
[0:55] I've got faith he had Faith but he also
[0:58] knew that this body is sown in
[1:00] corruption this is part of the Fall it
[1:03] has to be reversed everything has been
[1:04] changed until that time this is the
[1:07] reality that we live in
[1:09] I love the prophet of God being normal
[1:12] being a human being that you and I could
[1:15] relate to
[1:17] I want to be real like him
[1:19] not a religious fanatic but the reality
[1:22] of life and understand my position and
[1:25] how to live in this life how to to deal
[1:28] with people how to love people how to
[1:30] deal with situations it was all
[1:32] demonstrated for us in this end time
[1:34] and I thank God for it he said these
[1:37] things come I'm so thankful there's
[1:39] death to get us out of this pest house
[1:41] he says look at Bill Dow he said he's 90
[1:43] years old can you imagine another 30 40
[1:45] years amen can you imagine amen your
[1:48] body deteriorating down to where you
[1:50] have no Mobility no quality of life an
[1:53] absolute deterioration but you can't die
[1:55] there's no Freedom there's no way to get
[1:57] out of the pest house but it gets weaker
[1:59] and weaker and more deteriorated all the
[2:01] time I said Thank God this is not my
[2:04] destination amen this is this this world
[2:07] is not my home I'm just a passing
[2:09] through I'm here to gain character I'm
[2:11] here to display the word I'm here to
[2:13] become the manifested word for this day
[2:16] as Christ lives his life through me I'm
[2:18] here to shine the the Glorious Gospel of
[2:20] the end time as I yield myself to his
[2:23] hand and let him live his life through
[2:25] me I'm here to shine as a light I'm here
[2:27] to walk the path he has for me and I'm
[2:29] to do it with joy in the midst of the
[2:31] troubles that he and his wisdom allowed
[2:33] to come my way because this is not my
[2:35] permanent destination I I'm just passing
[2:37] through I'm just running a race but I've
[2:39] got a prize at the end of this race
[2:42] whether it be through the change of my
[2:45] items instantly or I get to die and go
[2:47] on to the sixth Dimension either way
[2:49] I've got a reward coming amen and I'm
[2:51] not living for now I'm living for that
[2:53] reward
[2:55] and we stay focused on that amen the
[2:58] disappointments of Life become minimal
[3:01] because this is just another thing it'll
[3:03] pass it'll be okay I just want to gain
[3:06] the character that I'm supposed to gain
[3:08] and move forward and Shine the Light
[3:09] that I'm supposed to shine in this
[3:11] problem
