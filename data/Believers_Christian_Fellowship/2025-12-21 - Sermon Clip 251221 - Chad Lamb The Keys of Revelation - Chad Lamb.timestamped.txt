[0:00] Now listen verse 37. I think this is the
[0:03] most important one.
[0:05] &gt;&gt; Now when they heard this, they were
[0:07] pricricked in their heart.
[0:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:11] &gt;&gt; They were pricricked in their heart and
[0:13] said unto Peter and to the rest of the
[0:15] apostles, men and brethren, what shall
[0:17] we do?
[0:20] Listen, to me, this is the most critical
[0:22] part because there has to be somewhere
[0:25] for the fulfillment of prophecy, the
[0:27] mystery to strike.
[0:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[0:30] And where does it strike? It struck
[0:31] their heart.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; And they were pricricked in their heart.
[0:34] There was some that day who were not
[0:37] pricricked in their heart.
[0:39] &gt;&gt; This is not about going through the
[0:40] motions. This is not about copy and
[0:42] paste. This is not about repeat after
[0:44] me. This is about when the disposational
[0:47] change was manifest was preached and
[0:49] when he was declared to them the day
[0:51] that they were living in with the
[0:52] fulfillment prophecy for that day,
[0:54] something inside of them began to jump
[0:56] and they were pricked in their heart.
[0:58] THEY KNEW INSIDE THAT WHAT Peter was
[1:00] saying was the truth.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAID, "NOW WHAT DO WE DO?"
[1:06] &gt;&gt; It wasn't like, "What do I need to do to
[1:08] go to heaven? I'll do what it takes to
[1:10] go to heaven. GIVE ME THE PROCESS." IT
[1:12] WASN'T THAT kind of thing, friends.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; They were hearing the word preached. And
[1:16] when they heard the word for their hour
[1:18] priest and the fullness of the
[1:20] revelation, the mystery, the key,
[1:22] opening up the the the kingdom of heaven
[1:24] TO THEM, SOMETHING INSIDE of them began
[1:27] to move and they were pricricked in
[1:28] their heart. And they said to Peter AND
[1:30] THE BRETHREN, "WHAT DO WE DO NOW?"
[1:33] &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THE TRUTH. AMEN.
[1:35] WE COME TO THIS FEAST. WE COME, WE'VE
[1:37] BEEN FULFILLING ALL THE LAW OF MOSES.
[1:39] We've been looking forward TO THIS DAY
[1:40] FOR GENERATIONS FROM GENERATIONS AND
[1:43] GENERATIONS. NOW, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
[1:45] TOUCHING ME IN MY SOUL. IT'S BRINGING A
[1:47] REACTION OUT OF ME. NOW, WHAT DO I DO?
[1:50] AND HE SAYS, "REPENT. CHANGE YOUR MIND
[1:52] ABOUT ALL OF THIS. AND COME TO THE OPEN
[1:54] WORD. COME TO THE TRUTH."
[1:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; And be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:00] Jesus Christ for the remission of SINS
[2:01] AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE
[2:03] HOLY GHOST.
[2:06] &gt;&gt; IT STILL WORKS TODAY. THE SAME EXACT
[2:08] WAY, THE SAME EXACT FORMULA, NOT AS A
[2:11] FORMULA LIKE THE BAPTISTS DO. TAKE YOU
[2:13] THROUGH the old Roman road, read to you
[2:15] a couple scriptures, get you to agree
[2:17] with it, and repeat after me PRAYER AND
[2:18] YOU'RE SAVED. NOT THAT KIND OF PRAYER,
[2:20] NOT KIND OF SALVATION, BUT THE KIND FROM
[2:23] THE BIBLE, THE KIND from Pentecost WHEN
[2:25] WHEN YOU PREACH THE PROPHECY FULFILLED
[2:27] IN YOUR DAY, THE WORD FOR THIS
[2:29] DISPENSATIONAL change that we're in
[2:31] RIGHT NOW, PREACHING CHRIST ALIVE IN OUR
[2:33] DAY, AMEN, AND GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
[2:35] THEM, THIS IS THE TRUTH, THIS IS THE
[2:37] DAY, NOT AS OUR FATHERS, BUT GOD HAS
[2:39] BROUGHT SOMETHING TO PASS IN OUR DAY.
[2:41] AND WHEN THEY HEAR THAT, THEY'RE
[2:43] PRICRICKED IN THEIR HEART. WHAT DO YOU
[2:44] DO THEN? REPENT FROM YOUR DENOMINATIONAL
[2:46] UNDERSTANDING. REPENT FROM YOUR WORLDLY
[2:48] IDEAS AND COME TO THIS JESUS CHRIST, THE
[2:51] TRUTH REVEALED before you
[2:53] &gt;&gt; and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:55] Jesus CHRIST. AND YOU [screaming] SHALL
[2:57] WITHOUT ANY SHADOW OF A DOUBT, WITHOUT
[2:59] ANY QUESTION, receive the baptism of the
[3:02] HOLY GHOST.
[3:03] &gt;&gt; THAT FORMULA STILL WORKS today
[3:05] &gt;&gt; if we approach it the same way
[3:08] &gt;&gt; and if it comes by the same results in
[3:10] effect.
[3:13] It's the revelation of the word.
