========================================
[Laughter] [Music] oh worship [Laughter] praise the lord amen such a pleasure to be with you this morning and i've enjoyed the worship and now it comes time to hear from him and we're excited to be here together while we're standing if you could just take your bibles and turn to john chapter 18 the gospel of john chapter 18. we'll just get started verse 37 pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesus answered thou sayeth that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice so what was one of the purposes jesus came into the earth he tells you here he says to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth says bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this opportunity lord that you've given us to gather together to worship your lord and we're here to receive your word we just ask now in jesus name lord that you would come down that you would break the bread of life with your own hand lord that it wouldn't be the working of a man but lord you would take these lips of clay and you would take my mind out of the way and all my ideas lord let me die to them now but i pray that by the power of your holy ghost you would pick up a gift that's laying in this vessel that you would use it lord to minister to your children lord to feed your sheep we come needy we come hungry we come because we want more of you lord i just pray that you'd give us a greater portion we ask in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated praise god so we find out jesus here standing before pilate and he says pilate asked him were you a king and he says thou sayest that i am a king but he's going to tell him his purpose amen his purpose for coming this end was i born you know we we're at the time when this is the season that everybody talks about the birth of jesus christ you know at the christmas time and brother branham we know he set that straight and he told us all things that we need to know but yet this is the season that everybody chooses to talk about this but when jesus when jesus was talking about it he was giving the purpose for his birth amen to this end was i born and for this cause came i enter the world amen that i should bear witness unto the truth amen so what did he come for to bear witness unto the truth and everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice praise god let's look over at john chapter 12. let me just go back a couple chapters to john chapter 12 verse 46 in john chapter 12 46 he says i am come a light unto the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness so he come a light into the world amen and that was his purpose for coming we see here in christ is the mystery of god revealed i'm going to read several quotes out of this message crisis mystery god revealed and i've just been been reading in it and enjoying it very much and i'm going very slowly through this this book and i'm enjoying it very much so you might hear a lot about it coming up because it's really been inspiring to me but i want to minister on search the scriptures they are they which testify of me as a subject i want to take search the scriptures they are they that testify of me and when we hear that our mind always goes to a certain place and jesus is talking and we'll get to that in a minute but but i think that could be applied today to you and i amen i believe the same statement could be applied today to you and i brother bam says in christ is the mystery of god revealed now god had a purpose in a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living see then you will understand clearly then you see on believe on what is being done amen so we know that christ is the mystery of god revealed brother ben was talking about the threefold purpose that was in the back part of god's mind and here we have a prophet of god on the scene that is going to reach back into the back part of god's mind and he's going to begin to talk about things that have been laying there from before the foundation of the world that nobody's been able to talk about before and he says he's had a purpose amen an idea something that he was trying to accomplish amen and he's going to do it in a three-fold manner amen the first fold to get preeminence in a man and he did that in christ jesus but the second fold is to get preeminence in a people and the bride and then third is to restore them back into perfect fellowship back into an eaten condition and so this has been his plan all the way through this is his plan through the entire bible this is his plan before he wrote the bible when he throw the stars out this was his plan when enoch built the then he built the pyramid this was the plan when he had the prophets begin to prophesy and record down the prophecies this has always been his plan this is what he's been working on since before the foundation of the world hallelujah praise the lord see it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living then you understand clearly then you will see i believe in what is being done god's great great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of a half hour and seven thunders uttered their voices and john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't no he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible so yeah he he hasn't said it right out amen when brother bram comes to the third pool he's told don't say anything about this you explain the first one you explain the second one you cause the mess you cause interpretation don't say anything when you come to the seventh seal there's silence brother man comes to the seventh seal and he gets to the end he says now i said so i stop right there i feel to stop i wrote in here stop right here go no further he's told not to explain it but now he's coming along and christ is in the mystery garden review and it says he hasn't he says he hasn't see what he says he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he'll come it's a good thing that he doesn't no he has showed it or revealed it in every type that's in the bible so now brother branham he's he's going to come he's going to show us this great mystery amen this great mystery of the seventh seal it's been showed and typed in every type that's in the bible if you want to see it it's there it's in the bible amen it's already there therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in time in expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it praise god but it's not for everybody it's by revelation it's only to the predestinated it's not for the masses it's not for everybody it's not something that can be interpreted it's for those that will pass through the little room and go behind the veil amen brother branham he has the tent vision and then the tent vision he's told all that he tells it back in 1956 all the way back in 56 he starts talking about this great giant tent or cathedral and inside a little wooden room amen and he and he's told that this will be your third pool this will be the third pole and in there there's people that they're lined up and and and it's amazing they're coming in one by one and he says i saw that light go down into that room amen i saw the light the pillar of fire christ himself go down into that room and brother said i went to move my feet and i couldn't go down there amen there was a little little room and in that little room was christ a pillar of fire and they were going in one by one and one by one they would go behind the veil amen and they would come in contact amen with that light and they would walk out totally changed different than the way they walked in they walked in and they were stretchers they come out pushing their stretchers on crutches carrying the crutches something changed when they passed through that little room they come out the other side and there was somebody there brother venom said writing things down and they asked him what happened and the people themselves could not explain what happened in that room all they know is something has changed i was afflicted before i'm whole now something has changed [Applause] it wasn't a public show nobody else could see what was happening the prophet of god himself could not see what was happening in that little room but as they passed one by one an individual affair an individual slipping in behind the veil amen and what is the new birth jesus christ personally revealed to you what was that light that pillar of fire jesus christ meeting them one by one and he's told that this vision this will be your third pool it's amazing he first talks about the first place i found him talking about it is january 1st new year's message in 1956. and he says there's a pointing forward this will be your third pool but then he comes to sabine canyon in january of 1963 seven years later you think god's not in control seven years later in january he's in subpoena can he's praying his hands are in the air and something strikes his hand and it's a sword and he hears a voice say it's the sword of the king we know all of that and he's looking at that and now that angel says this is your third pool no longer pointing to the future amen now what was shown you in the future is now coming into manifestation there's going to be the opening of the word and this is your third pool but it's an individual affair it's by revelation hallelujah he said i don't know if i finish this quote or not i'll just read it again in the last days he has revealed it and shows it and god's help well you'll see it right here this morning see what this great mystery the part that wasn't spoken amen the part's been kept quiet the secret the things the angels didn't know nothing about amen the thing that john was forbidden to write amen all of that with god's help you'll see it right here this morning hey if you're going to see it right here this morning it's only going to be by god's help amen it's not going to be by the the eloquence of a preacher it's not going to be by slides or charge amen it's not going to be by just straight teaching if you're going to ever catch this mystery it's going to be by the help of god [Applause] god's help we'll see you'll see it right here this morning and what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it so he's been expressing it amen this isn't the first time he's expressing it he's been expressing it all the way down through so the entire bible is this expression therefore you can see the great meaning of what it has been to know this and then try to bring it to the people and and you know i haven't went into details to try to explain it as god has revealed it to me hallelujah that's why i love that message christ is the mystery god revealed means so much to me let's look in the gospel of john again at chapter 17. i just want to read something else you all know me by now and know how i work i'm slow and we go around the horn and we finally get to the path that we want to walk but just bear with me just pull the harder you pull the faster we get there amen so just pull john chapter 17 verse 4 i have glorified thee on earth on the earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do and now o father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was do you think jesus had any spiritual amnesia you think jesus was struggling with his origin where he came from what he was to do on the earth what his purpose he said i've glorified your name on the earth i did the work that you told me to do now glorify me with the glory i had with you before amen he's not under spiritual amnesia he knows exactly where he's at he says verse 6 i have manifest thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world now where did these men come from amen i have manifested the name to the men that thou gave us to me amen it wasn't jesus walking along and saying you look like a pretty good fella i think you'll hold up under pressure i think i'm going to choose you no they were already given to him of the father he was going around collecting what was already belonged to the father and given to him of the father and he was just there led by the spirit to collect what the father had already given i manifest thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gave us them me and they have kept thy word now they ha they have known that all things whatsoever thou has given me are of thee for i have given unto them the words which thou gave us me and they have received them and have known surely that i come out from thee and they have believed that thou did send me i pray for them now let's let's look at verse 8 again because it's interesting he's saying i've given them thy words which thou gave us me and they received them and have known surely that i come out from thee it's amazing because the pharisees say where did you come from and the pharisees where did you get that but here here the disciples the ones that the father given to him they knew he came out from them and they knew he was speaking the words the father gave them but the well-trained pharisees they were asking where did you get that and where did you come from and who do you belong to and what's your origin but here these fishermen and tax collectors and whatever else they were they knew where he came from and they knew where his words came from it was it wasn't an intellectual thing it was by spiritual revelation they were already predisposed to believe they already had something in their spiritual dna amen that the word of god could unlock and it come to life and they would say thou are the son of the living god they're a christ the son of the living god where did that come from my father told that to thee [Applause] they were already by predestination amen they were already wired to believe it was we say it that way they already amen they already had the ability within them to believe because they were the fathers the father gave them to them and he says they know that what i'm saying comes from you and they know that i come from you how did they know that the same way you know that this is nothing but the truth when you listen to the message amen and you hear what the prophet saying and you read christ as the mystery of god revealed you've got the same wiring on the inside that same spiritual dna amen as it begins to unfold something and you say that's true that's true that's true how do you know it's true because i know it's true based off what i have nothing to base it off of hallelujah you say he based it off the word but if i get into a theological debate over the things that brother branham brought amen and i start to talk with a theologian he's going to make me feel stupid and foolish and like i don't know nothing in about 50 15 or 20 minutes he'll start breaking down greek and this word here and exit jesus this and whatever else he wants to talk about amen because it's not that kind of understanding it's not that kind of knowing amen it's something that's much higher than an intellectual knowing it's something that is already wired in the soul in the seed gene of god that came from god that's going back to god amen that recognizes anything that comes from god that which also came from god can recognize its origin that's god somebody else will say amen that's heresy no that's god that's a false prophet no that's god those are a bunch of fanatics no that's god prove it don't have to hallelujah amen where are we at verse 8 verse 9 i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorified in them and now i am no more in the world what jesus says some amazing things he's right here with the disciples on the earth praying a prayer and he's saying he's saying i now and now i am no more in the world jesus does this all the time he talks to nicodemus and he begins to talk to nicodemus and he said to nicodemus he said the son of man which is in heaven and here jesus he's been calling himself the son of man he's been referring to himself as son of man but here he's talking to nicodemus and he says now the son of man which is in heaven and now nicodemus could go now amen after jesus his death and he buried he resurrected and now somebody starts talking to him about the son of man ministry and that son of man ministry and it was in that man and nicodemus says i heard him say the son of man was in heaven so that couldn't have been the son of man just take jesus's words he said the son of man which is in heaven nicodemus heard that nicodemus may have had a recording he may have went down and wrote it down and now he could discredit the flesh ministry of jesus christ because he himself said the son of man was in heaven because the son of man was in heaven and the son of man was standing there talking to him on earth amen heaven is not far away heaven's all around it's just moving at a faster dimension amen we are right now seated in heavenly places in christ jesus amen we get the idea that it's impossible to be in two dimensions at the same time where does the scripture ever say that it's not there in fact jesus makes it clear you can be in two dimensions at the same time paul makes it clear you could be seated in heavenly places in christ jesus that's why he he looks at his disciples jesus says and he says follow after me that where i am ye may be also not future tense present tense if you're following after him where he is you may be also where is he amen in heavenly places where am i in heavenly places [Applause] hey my body's still in this dimension i'm still standing here i'm not denying that any more than jesus denied that he was the son of man in a body of flesh but he was also the son of man in heaven at the same time [Applause] amen the message came to get us out of kindergarten an earthly intellectual understanding that he can only be here and then he can be here and he's got to move from here to here hey he can be here and here at the exact same time if not the bible doesn't mean anything and jesus doesn't even have common understanding if that can't be true hallelujah it's fundamental that we erase everything science has taught us when we want to understand spiritual things because it doesn't follow the rules of science jesus was not speaking in intellectual terms that could be easily understood when he looked at them and said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you amen that wasn't intellectually easy to understand and what he was saying was exactly the truth but it wasn't what they thought he was saying hallelujah amen god is good all right let's go back to our scripture amen verse 11 and now and now now i am no more in the world can you imagine the disciples with their heads about listen to jesus pray and they're like what it's like nicodemus he had heard him say things about the son of man but now nicodemus he's got some questions on his heart he wants some answers so he comes by night to jesus to have his questions answers and jesus doesn't answer questions jesus starts talking in mysteries lest the man be born again he said can a man go the second time into his mother's womb hey jesus isn't about explaining anything he says you're a master you're a master in israel you don't know these things what do you mean know these things you're talking about something i've never heard about that i must be born again amen that wasn't a term that was thrown out among the jews that wasn't something that they could turn to their scriptures and see that phrase used amen jesus is now saying you must be born again and nicodemus is stuck an intellectual he's stuck in human and he's saying how can i enter into my mother's womb a second time and jesus doesn't say well let me explain it to you it's spiritual no he says how you being a master how can you not know this it doesn't come by much study nicodemus could have never studied to the point to know that it comes by spiritual revelation the same thing that hit peter who was ignorant and unlearned amen and couldn't sign his own name but he could catch what the pharisees were missing it wasn't by learning amen it was by a spiritual revelation all of a sudden he said thou art christ the son of the living god flesh and blood had not told this to thee but my father which is in heaven when did the father tell him that that's what we don't have any record of in the scripture when did the father tell peter that maybe before the foundation of the world maybe he had that knowledge already in the seed maybe that revelation that knowledge that understanding was there when that attribute was with god when god was alone with his thoughts that's where the attribute that was in peter was abiding amen and maybe there is where he caught the revelation and now it's got to be manifest on the earth flesh and blood until my father which is in heaven has told you this how far away was heaven how did peter get there how did god come down we've got to get out of kindergarten we've got to get past first grade we've got to get up to where we have a spiritual understanding that all things are possible to them that believe praise god amen verse 11 and now i am no more in the world i wasn't supposed to stay this long on this god bless you all i got something really burning me up to get to so you better start pulling fast faster faster and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to the holy father keep through thine own name those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are one as we are while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name though those that thou gavest me i have kept and none of them as lost but the son of perdition that the scriptures might be fulfilled and now come i to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world all right now he's drawing an equal sign just as he is not of the world is the same way in which they are not of the world let's read it again he says the world has hated them because they are not of the world even just like equal sign even as i am not of the world hallelujah brother branham he comes to communion the last message he's going to preach and in that message communion he starts talking about god pulling him and that little eagle and he says and then i realized i'm not the son of charles and ella branham i'm not what's he saying amen he's talking out of his head this isn't logical it doesn't make intellectual sense he's not speaking on the intellectual side he's saying i realized right then i am not the son of charles and ella branham [Applause] totally defying logic totally defying reason amen i am a son of god amen i come from god my origin wasn't through the womb of that woman it wasn't from the seed of that man it goes way back before that amen this is only my earthly coming but it's not who i am i'm not identified by the names on my birth certificate amen i am identified with the marriage certificate and my marriage certificate has a name on it and that marriage certificate is the lamb's book of life amen that will open in this day so that i could hear the mysteries and hear my name and know that i'm on that marriage certificate that goes back before the foundation of the world so just as jesus was not of the world we are not of the world amen hallelujah amen verse 15 i pray not that thou should just take them out of the world but that thou should keep should us keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as i am not of the world i'm not of the world either i'm in the world but i'm not of the world amen this body was formed they meant out of elements of the dust they met when when when genetic material got together and man and formed a cell and then mama kept eating and kept forming my body and i was born and i kept eating this body has come from the earth but this body is not who i am this is a temple a tabernacle a tent that i'm dwelling in i come from god and i'm going back to god i am not of the world even as jesus christ was not of the world amen praise god hallelujah amen they are not of the world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have i sent them into the world and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth brother iran comes and says in christ is the mystery god revealed paragraph 4 54 says and watch here here it's beautiful i don't want you to miss this now everybody and you people on tape out in the jungles and wherever you hear it now listen and as the father has sent me so send i you jesus said now watch the father that sent him went in him to vindicate himself right for he was the word and the same jesus that sends you goes with you and in you to vindicate the same god as the father has sent me and i live by the father so i'll send you and you live by me what is he he's the word you live by the word turn to matthew the gospel of matthew chapter 5 matthew chapter 5. and verse 14. matthew 5-14 ye are the light of the world and the city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven and what's interesting about this is jesus said that he came into the world of light that men should not walk in darkness but now he in his physical form amen as the man christ jesus he's leaving the earth in that form amen and now there's going to be a transfer of the light now he says i come a light that men should not dwell in darkness but then he looks at the disciples and he says ye are the light of the world but i thought he said he was the light and the true light but then he says year the light amen because it's him in them that are the light amen they come from the same place amen they come from the same origin amen they come from the same father and now it's he pouring his life into them now they become the light amen and he says the light is not put under a bushel but set on a candlestick or on a hill for all the city to see and this is where vashti failed when we were talking wednesday night vashti was the bride he meant she was the wife of the king but vashti did not want to be put on display the king had had a banquet and he had gathered all the royals and he had gathered all the important people and it was time now for him to call forth his bride it was at the end of seven days so he sends seven chamberlain's amen at the end of seven days to go fetch the bride amen and she's living amen she's living in a palace she's comfortable rich and increased with goods and has need of nothing she's a laodicean woman and she's having a feast for the women [Music] she's content being with the other churches she's content being like the other churches because a church is always represented by a woman so she's here in the feast of the churches she's here with the other i'm just like the other churches i'm content with the other churches i don't want to be separated out from the feast of the women i don't want to be brought before the king to be put on display let your light so shine before men that they see your good works and glorify god we don't light a light and stick it under a bushel back we're not here to be like another church we're not here to be like the denominations but at the end of the seven days he sent seven chamberlain to call him out of the feast of women to call vashti to come out of the feast of women and come into the presence of the king to be put on display [Applause] he wanted them all to see her [Applause] hallelujah i'm so thankful amen though some may reject the call there was a little esther and esther was willing to be on display not for herself but for the king praise god this is where vashti failed to set that light where else is there light where else is there light he looked at him and ye are the light of the world amen when jesus amen when he ascends to the father where's light where is it is it in the jewish religion is it with the pharisees and the sadducees where where is the light amen they're walking in darkness he came as light coming into darkness they were already in darkness they were in a laodicean condition they were in the darkness the light had almost completely faded out so he comes as light and when he leaves he leaves them as the light and if they refuse to go on display if they refuse to get on the candlestick amen now where is everybody going to see but he's calling for one that says i'll stand on the candlestick and i'll tell the truth i'll say what's right i'll say what's wrong i'll give the revelation in this message if somebody wants to hear i'll tell them god sent a prophet in this day because this condition is dark amen laodicea has gone in complete total blackout a complete total blackout so come out over my people whose call is that the spirit and the bride saying come amen she's got to be on display it says in the message things that are to be in 1965 now the only way that you can be a son or daughter of god is because you have to have to have eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's god's life only one form of eternal life that was god there to be a son of god you had to be in him always the gene of your life the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there was even a molecule so how old are you how old are you brother jeremy don't say 42 i'm eternal brother ma'am says you have never seen me they were looking right at him brother bam talks just like jesus doesn't he he's standing before the crowd he says you have never really seen me what are you talking about brother brown i'm looking right at you that's not what he's talking about he's talking about the real hymn amen that real predestinated sieging of god that him was that was meant to be him all along amen he's talking about that eternal life that's dwelling inside and he's looking right out of people amen the people have perfectly fine vision and he says you have never really seen me and he tells him he said he's talking to people who know his heritage you know his birth who know where he came from amen in communion and he's saying i'm not the son of charles and ella branham amen he's talking just like jesus christ just like the scriptures are written amen i'm not the son of my mom and dad i'm the son of god amen amen i don't count i don't count my years you can't count eternity [Applause] the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing first can you say you're nothing that's the way to start this quote i'm nothing i'm nothing then the next little word is really exciting but you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as a son of god you're not a farmer you're not an engineer you're not an accountant amen you're not a housewife you're not any of that you're not a deacon you're not a pastor you're not you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god at the beginning as a son of god that's what you are not the son of charles and ella branham amen not the flesh body that you see that's not what you are that's why brother ma'am can say i'm not the son of charles allen bram you've never really ever seen me because he's caught this revelation jesus had the same one he knew where he came from he knew where he was going he says now now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age hallelujah i thought he was the light of the world he is in every form he takes whether it's pillar of fire whether it's lord jesus christ on earth whether it's the bride whatever form that he takes he's here to light up the earth when he would come and his disciples on the day of pentecost amen they were the light amen in the only light that was on the earth it wasn't their light it was his light in them whatever form he comes in he's the light of the world he's the word now you're expressed now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age you are expressing god's life in you because you're a son or daughter of god therefore you get what i mean you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express god to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate wherever you are god knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you if you ever if you've got eternal life then it always was eternal life and god before there was a foundation the world knew that you would be here and when the word or the water the washing of the water the word fell upon you it was expressing a being it wasn't expressing this flesh now under a moral more a moral conduct amen that washing of the water the word came amen amen the word came to wash away the old life and it came to express a being what being it came to express christ christ is the mystery of god revealed christ is the entire bible christ is the lamb's book of life christ amen it was christ and moses it was christ and noah it was christ and abraham it was christ all the way through and it's christ here today in the manifestation of his bride it's christ the mystery of god revealed [Applause] hallelujah be to god let's go to first john chapter three i'm still laying a foundation i love you guys i do because you know it takes a lot of patience and grace and love for you guys but i love you back for it first john chapter 3 verse 8. he that committeth sin is of the devil we know sin is unbelief he that committeth sinners of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning is that right sin didn't start in the garden of eden so brother bram said sin started in heaven so the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifest that he might destroy the works of the devil the devil said from the beginning because the devil would simply from beginning in the mind of god it would require the son of a son of god to be made manifest to destroy the works of the devil because he said from the beginning there was already a plan in the mind of god and because of that the son of man was expressed the son of god was expressed was manifest that he might destroy the works of the devil brotherhood says in the spoken word is the original seed from 1962 now christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil you believe that now i can't explain all this i'm just going to go through it just quickly now hit the high places so you won't stay too long hallelujah christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil is that right you all believe that what was he god's word god's word he was the word made flesh you could say what was he you could say he was a man you could say he was a man from galilee or come on that he was but really what he was was the word the word made flesh that's really what he was you believe that what was he god's word which destroys the works of the hybrid the devil is that right he was done to do that he was born to be that to destroy the works of the devil now his body is to do the same why because it's the same life with the same commission and the same ministry brother branham said they're just husband and wife same everything same life same ministry same anything hallelujah his body is to do the same because the body is head and body is together that right if christ is the head was the word his body has to be the same thing as his head was so what's the body what's the bride the word made flesh what is the word made flesh here to do it's manifest to what destroy the works of the devil you're here to destroy the works of the devil amen what are the works of the devil amen to discredit god's word to destroy god's people how does he do it he does it by deception on the word by changing the word by compromising the word what did he do in the beginning with eve he got her to change one word amen and that's how he discredited god's word that's how he destroyed god's people and we're here amen the manifestation of the word of god for this day to destroy the works of the devil by not changing the word by not compromising on the word by not hybridizing with her own intellect hey guess what brother branham says some things that don't make sense to the intellect jesus christ may said things that don't make sense to the intellect amen but we're not here to make it make sense we're here to believe it and to manifest it to make it live and you don't have to comprehend an intellectual brain to make it live i don't know how faith in his word can cause cancer cells to die i don't know how faith in his word can make a border on a woman's neck fall at her feet and there's no scar there's fresh skin i mean it's not like there's a hole there how how intellectually explained to me get a medical doctor to tell me how in a prayer in an instant of time a quarter can fall at somebody's feet amen and there's not a scar they don't have to stitch skin up hey man they don't have to put anything on it you can't understand it but you can certainly believe it and watch it manifest and live in this life we're not looking for somebody that can make the message make sense we're looking for people who can believe it and make the message live live it not make it make sense live it [Music] you can have all the doctrine in the world right but if it doesn't translate into a life we miss the message when you say i understand sermon seed and i understand this and i got my scriptures lined up and i've got all my ducks and i've got all my bible studies and i've got everything tightly knit together on all the doctrines but if you can't make that word live in your life then we have missed the entire purpose of the message because it's a threefold plan not that she will understand serpenty not that she will understand the godhead that she will be the very manifestation of the very life of jesus christ on the earth that's the message not somewhere over the rainbow but right here in this age that we're living now that's why the word came that's what the opening of the word is all about that's why a great faith has been put into the church by what the revealing of the word to do what live his life on earth not a substitute life not life part two not jesus light but the very same life and full measure has been brought back to the earth again to be encapsulated and embodied in a people on this earth which is his body his headship which is the revealed word has come down to connect with his body which is the bride of jesus christ to do what amen to manifest the son of man again the son of man the very flesh manifestation of christ not in one man in a mini-membered bride that's the message well i understand this and i understand it and i want to argue with you on that don't argue with me just make it live just live it don't argue and live it who was arguing with jesus when he opened the blinded eyes who was arguing with him when he resurrected from the dead there was no more argument [Applause] they could disbelieve it but what are you going to argue with i was dead but now i'm alive forevermore just live it hallelujah let's go to romans chapter 16. brother branham's trying to show us that scripture we take this scripture in first john 3 and and we read the scripture and we apply that to jesus christ and his earthly ministry is that correct and that's not wrong that's correct but brother brandon comes and he takes that same scripture and he doesn't leave it in brother branham's earthly ministry but he pulls it into the ministry of jesus christ in the bride today so that scripture has a compound revelation and a compound fulfillment who's it for christ who's supposed to fulfill it christ not just the man by the sea of galilee but christ in whatever form he comes in that scripture applies to christ so if christ comes in the formation of the bride that scripture applies to christ that's what brother branham is doing in the message he's taking that scripture which was for jesus christ the son of god god may manifest to destroy the works of the devil and he says now his body is to do the same thing whose body is it what's the body of the bride no who's body his body and it wasn't the prophet of god brother brahm told us that that was paul the apostle who told us it was his body not a separate body not a second body are we getting this his body his head did not come to a second body his head came to his body his body his head connected together what do you mean by the chad that body it's in heaven sitting my goodness do we not know the bible have we not read the scriptures search the scriptures they are they that testify of me when god made them in the beginning he made them male and female and called their name adam he called he made them male and female and called their name jesus christ male and female brother man said this seventh seal has been shown all the way back at the beginning in genesis where's the seventh seal in genesis it's all through genesis the genesis is full of the seventh seal all you gotta do is go reading and you see the seventh seal here the seventh seal here the seventh seal here you find the seventh seal and the threefold purpose of god wants to get preeminence in the man so he created a son and he put him in the flesh and he had his son adam upon the earth but it was not good that adam dwelled alone so he laid adam down and put adam to sleep and took out of his side the ingredients for a bride and he made a woman amen in the image of the man amen to reflect the characters that were in that man and what's inside of her was inside of him [Applause] and when god looks at that he doesn't see two he sees one but the carnal human mind sees two it's the carnal human mind that would see the bride of christ separate from christ the carnal human mind will see the bride of christ as something separate than christ she is him that's what the prophet told us she is him his body his body the body of jesus christ stop counting with your eyes stop looking say 1-2 have spiritual eyes let's say 1-1 christ in christ christ and male christ and female christ in christ it's all christ [Applause] amen hallelujah so brother bannon is now he does this all the time amen but sometimes when we're in message kindergarten or in message preschool we'll see brother branham do that and we'll just think like he's just making an analogy he just will see him do things with scriptures that make your mind just fall to pieces brother ben will take the scripture in a quote a certain way and you're like i i have no idea how how you could read that and say that have you ever been there just read the message some more you'll get there how he he's not relying on his intellect to interpret the scriptures he's relying on the leadership of the holy ghost and god is vindicating and backing it up that this is what the the man has it right and he's not leaving one scripture pigeonholed anywhere in the bible but brother branham does the same thing jesus christ does and does the same thing paul the apostle does they can go back in the old testament and they can grab any scripture they want and make it fit in their day paul the apostle does jesus christ does brother branham does we need to have the mind of christ not the mind of a man so let's go to romans chapter 16. so jesus christ was manifest to destroy the works of the devil his body will do the same brother graham says he's not making an analogy he's properly placing the scriptures romans 16 20. romans chapter 16 verse 20 and the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet shortly wait a minute paul paul you've made a mistake oh apostle paul you've done you've really done it this time you've went out on the limb because the prophecy i read the prophecy i can go back to genesis 3 and i can read the prophecy and he says that serpent shall bruise the seed of the woman it's the seed of the woman and the serpent shall breathe his heal and he shall bruise his head so paul i've read the old testament i read it i studied it in seminary i could tell you the hebrew amen i know all the punctuation i got a down path that prophecy is for the seed of the woman and here the apostle paul picks it up and he says and the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet shortly i thought that applied somewhere else in another time unto jesus christ i thought he did that at calvary he did and he's doing it again under your feet amen because it's christ christ on calvary christ in the bride amen christ is the manifested word on earth that is bruising the head of satan [Applause] how can paul do this because he's a prophet how can brother branham do that he's a prophet let's go to john chapter five i think i'm ready to get to my text on chapter five don't amen too loud i get my feelings hurt john chapter 5 verse 39 jesus says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify which testify of me now put yourself right here let's not go let's not use a a modern thing let's go right here jesus is here living a life manifesting signs the pharisees have no idea where he come from didn't come from their school doesn't have a formal education he's saying things about the word that they have never said to ever been taught and never seen it that way before but he's doing things to back it up amen and they're they're coming against him and they're trying to contradict him what they're trying to do to jesus is they're trying to find fault so that it can discredit him they're trying to find somewhere even where they can fault him so they find out he's illegitimate born and he was raised in nazareth and supposed to come out they're trying to find some way that they can make him wrong so they can discredit him because he's a threat to their kingdom he's a threat to the religious leaders he's a threat to the preachers and so what they have to do is they have to say you've got to be wrong somewhere and jesus looks at him and he says search the scriptures you're preachers search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life he never said they had it he said in them you think you have eternal life but the very thing the very thing that you're basing your eternal destination on is the very thing that testifies of who i am and you've missed it if you've missed him did you get eternal life they were reading the scriptures and basing off what they read in the scriptures they thought they had eternal life but he said they are they that testify of me so the very scriptures that you're reading and putting stock in for eternal life are the very scriptures that are speaking of jesus christ but you're rejecting him and if you're rejecting him are you really saved by these scriptures no sir there's something jesus is pointing out there's something you've missed you think you have eternal life but the very thing that you're reading and feeling confident and comfortable that everything's fine with you are the very scriptures that point of me that declare me and you're rejecting me showing that you have nothing to be confident about you're misreading the scriptures hallelujah amen you know history repeats itself it just keeps running in a revolving cycle amen it just comes back around and back around spirits don't die and they just manifested another body they just change bodies all the way down through time the same thing jesus faces the same thing we're facing now [Applause] search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me brother man says in christ is the mystery of god revealed now notice again he said search the scriptures for they are they that testify of me search the scriptures the scriptures the entire scriptures amen don't leave anything out search the whole scriptures because brother bram said this whole thing is the record of christ if you go back and you read a line and you don't see christ in every line go back and read it again you missed something so what the prophet said search the scriptures were there to testify me search the scriptures the scriptures the entire scriptures what am i trying to do to show you that this bible is the thing that's right amen now here paragraph 120 says now here he says search the scriptures they testify of me in them you think you have eternal life and that's true and they are the one that bear record of me and i'm bearing record of them and if i do not the works that's promised that i would do then don't hear me but if i do the works and you can't believe me believe the works because they testify that he is the word oh it looks like it couldn't be any plainer see all right now search the scriptures he said moses and all the law and so forth the prophets in psalms spoke of him and again he said the scriptures testify of him further down in paragraph 128 he says now you realize that any of these places here you could take a text and just it's hard for a preacher to hold his peace it looked like he want to keep going with it but you've got to get back to what we're teaching on he is the principal theme of the bible he was in the prophets he was in the psalms he was in the history of the bible the bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and there you find christ he was in the prophets he was in the psalms he was in the history and he is also in the bible is the thing that is to come so he was before till after what does that make him the same yesterday today and forever what does this make this bible the written record of christ search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me they testify of christ let's turn to luke chapter 24. luke chapter 24. hallelujah verse 13. this is after jesus had been crucified and buried and resurrected this is the road to emmaus story verse 13 says and behold two of them went the same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about three score furlongs 60 furlongs and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him so who is it that's walking beside them jesus himself is what the scripture says but if you pick it up in mark and you look at mark when when he when mary magdalene had seen him and not recognized him she supposed he was the gardener now mary magdalene knew what jesus looked like she had seen him on multiple occasions she had followed the ministry she had been wherever he was at she was in the meetings amen as often as she could be there mary magdalene was wherever jesus was she was intimately familiar with him she knew what he looked like and here jesus himself not another person jesus himself is talking to mary and mary does not recognize him supposing him to be the gardener until he says mary and then she says rabboni being master what opened her eyes his voice calling her name what opened our eyes his voice calling our name how did he call our name he revealed the mysteries the revealing of the mysteries was calling our name he called us the same way because this mary magdalene is the woman typing the church she's the first one to see jesus after his resurrection and she happens to be a woman that had an ill-famed life that had seven devils cast out of her she had come and been rescued from the seven church ages and after she come out of the seven church ages amen and jesus christ she's the first one to recognize he's resurrected they all thought that they had taken his body somewhere and she even asked the gardener where have you laid him the carnal understanding the carnal mind seeing an empty tomb says stolen body but there's got to come a revelation of the word to this woman who's come through the seven churches and been delivered to the seven devils and now she's the first one to stand talking to the resurrected jesus christ and she doesn't even know it's him it's possible that jesus christ could be standing talking to you and you wouldn't even know it's him because he's not in that body there but he's in another form that's the bible that's mary magdalene it was jesus himself not jesus and something else jesus in another way it was jesus himself amen and he wanted to open her eyes so to open her eyes amen he called her name revealing the mysteries is calling the name it was his voice calling her name all he had to do was say mary and her eyes were open she knew it was the lord all he had to do was call us and we recognize who it was talking to us that's not a man from kentucky that's jesus christ in another form then that same scripture in mark that says that it said and then he appeared to two others in another form and they're speaking to the two on the road to the mass he comes in another form if it's jesus christ on another form what do you call it it's not the same body that was pierced with nails it wasn't the same body that was was pierced through the feet it wasn't the same one that had marks on his skull amen and down his head from the thorn it wasn't that same one but it was the same person he was there he was talking to them the scripture says jesus himself drew deer and the bible said he showed himself to two others in another form in another form it was jesus himself that's the bible that's not the figment of a man's imagination that's a bible but you've got to grow up out of christian kindergarten got to get out of first grade we've got to have spiritual eyes of revelation to see he can be there and here all at the same time heaven's here heaven has come down the two dimensions are blending together and they're blending together in the bride that's why jesus christ could stand in flesh looking at nicodemus and say the son of man which is in heaven was he in heaven yes was he on the earth yes he was a multi-dimensional being this bride has been called out of the laodicean church called into a higher spiritual realm this body is still working walking in a world there's an absolute utter darkness it's a laodicean condition laodicea is going all around and my body is walking through a world in laodicea but i have been resurrected out of dead denominationalism i have been lifted by the opening of the word the open door in revelations 4 and lifted into a higher plane and i am walking in two places at the same time seated in heavenly places in christ jesus and with my feet and flesh on this earth the same position jesus christ was in when he was talking to nicodemus and here he comes on the road to emmaus in another form but the bible says jesus himself drew near how can it be him if it doesn't look like him you mean jesus himself can come in another body jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what man of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad and one of them whose name was cleopas answered said unto him aren't thou only a stranger in jerusalem and has not known the things which are come to pass there in these days he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet might indeed in word before god and all people and how the chief priests and the rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things are done yey and certain women also of our company made us astonish which were early at the sepulcher and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which which were with us went to the sepulcher and found it even so as the woman had said but him they saw not see how funny this is they're complaining they're on the road to emmaus they're leaving jerusalem which is a type of the church and they're walking away from jerusalem and he told them to wait in jerusalem they're walking away from jerusalem and he himself jesus himself comes out and joins them but in another form is what mark says he's walking along there and they're complaining we thought it had been he that should save us it was he he is saving you they were looking with carnal eyes with an intellectual understanding and missing what was happening present tense it's easy to miss what's happening present tense when you have to understand it with your brain or see it with your eyes or touch it with your hands here he is himself he himself jesus himself so the bible says jesus himself and now they're complaining that they they said that he he was gone his body was was not in the sepulchre and they went and they found him not we don't know where he's at he's standing right next to you they're crying about jesus body being gone his body's gone we don't know where he is and they've stolen that they're taking it somewhere and we can't find him he's standing right next to you but you're so spiritually blind and you didn't hear what he was telling you on earth you took a carnal interpretation and you're missing the very event that's unfolding you're walking right in the vision and you're missing what's happened because you're looking for nail prints brother man said we don't look for nail prints we look for the word made manifest and where the word made manifest that's him in this day it's he himself walking with us on the road to emmaus open our eyes lord and let us see who's here with us oh oh he's gone he's not here when he gets back it's going to be wonderful he's back it's wonderful open your eyes and see who's walking right with us they took his body what do you care about the body i'm here can you imagine jesus is standing there in another word jesus himself i just want to refer that jesus himself because it's so easy to say if that body is somewhere else and it's not jesus himself no the bible says jesus himself in another form himself is standing there and they're saying we we don't know where they took his body we can't find his body where's his body and jesus stands there forget the body i can come into anybody anybody i want i can take over it's the life you should be looking for it's the manifestation of the word quit looking for the body and look for the life look for the word made manifest look for the promise being unfolded the promise of a resurrection the promise that i will come to you look for the promise quit looking for the body leaving jerusalem leaving the place you're supposed to stay and walking away down into the church ages walking away [Applause] [Music] why because they don't see his body [Applause] didn't see his body and we're sad he said why do you walk along the way and talk and are sad well we're sad because he's dead he's gone and we can't see his body why are you sad i'm here i'm standing right next to you i'm walking with you the head has been united with the body in an invisible union he himself has come to her why are we sad because i don't see his body i'll be happy when i see his body if i can't be happy about the manifestation of the word his body's not going to change anything from me if i can't see him now in the unveiling of himself unveiling of god unveiling of the word and recognizing his presence what makes me think i'm going to be happy when i see a nail scarred body amen it's the same jesus jesus himself is here in the form of his bride and if i can't be excited about that he's already said mary amen mary was excited she was ecstatic he meant he didn't have to have nail scars as soon as he said mary she didn't need nail scars she didn't need the same body she didn't need the same garment she didn't care what form it was in she said raboni [Applause] she was excited she was happy all her questions vanished all of a sudden she was excited not because she saw nail prints amen but because she heard him call her name and she recognized that's him hallelujah we got to grow up we got to mature spiritually we got to get out of kindergarten playing with little blocks this scripture goes here and this scripture goes here oh my goodness amen the scriptures that speak of christ are the same scriptures that speak of the bride [Applause] the prophet has already told us he's already pointed out we just have to believe it he's not making analogies he's interpreting the word hallelujah let's get back here 22 and certain women also of our company made us astonish which were early at the sepulcher when they found nana's body they came saying they also seen a vision of angels not that they had really seen angels we're having a hard time believing this because we didn't see it so they saw a vision they didn't really see angels they saw a vision of angels brother maybe it was a dream maybe you ate something amen they knew what they saw also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive hallelujah and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre and found it even so as the women as the women had said but him they saw not where's the problem you saw it was just like they said the angels told them that he's alive why are you walking away from jerusalem why are you walking in the church ages leaving jerusalem why are you so sad he's alive i didn't see his body my goodness you realize jesus is going to rebuke them hard for not believing it's not seeing it's believing all right but him they saw not i just love that they're sad walking away from jerusalem because they didn't see him oh the angel said he's alive and when they went sure enough his body was gone but i don't know it just doesn't make sense to me i don't see him he's standing he's the one talking to you right now open your eyes he's the one on the road he's the one on the journey he's right here jesus himself is right here amen but i don't see oh when i see him oh that day my goodness we're in the day [Applause] jesus is here in another form it's time to describe cry raboni master lord you're here everything's fine my questions are answered i'm happy i'm rejoicing i'm testifying because now i recognize you're here it's just another form it wasn't what i expected it wasn't the same one that i seen crucified but it doesn't matter i heard your voice you called my name and i know it's you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's the message that's what makes our hearts burn that's why they call us crazy that's why amen the whole world will one day band together to shut this church down because they think we've lost your rocker they don't realize we see what they don't see they don't realize amen we don't need a body with nail prints to recognize that he's here jesus himself is here we're walking in two worlds at the same time brother branham said jesus walked in a world all to himself what kind of world do you think the bride's going to walk in one that makes sense to everybody around us one that could be easily explained amen one that they said how how can how can he be here and there at the same time how can i go back into my mother's womb a second time how can you say the son of man is in heaven and you say you're the son of man how amen it's not our job to explain it friends just answer like jesus you call yourself a preacher and you don't know these things you call yourself a child of god search the scriptures and then you think of eternal life these are they that testify of me what i'm telling you is laying in the word just believe it it doesn't lay in there according to your seminary teaching or to 2000 years of indoctrination through the church ages of course not amen because they messed the word up i'm not going to go read what matthew henry said about the word matthew henry didn't have the full revelation of the word i like charles spurgeon but i'm not going to rely on what charles spurgeon said charles spurgeon was revealing the word for his day but he only had partial light he didn't have the full light but what's coming this day is full light on the scriptures when he opened the seals he took the veil off the entire bible the whole word is open and unveiled and unsealed amen i'm not going to go back for a partial understanding brother branham says this but what did matthew henry say forget matthew henry amen he built and he built and he built through matthew godly man man of god we're going to see him on the other side charles spurgeon finney knox are all godly men but god was building revelation upon revelation upon revelation amen and we're not to go backwards [Music] here they are walking out of jerusalem walking away from jerusalem but god and his mercy comes to them and walks with them in another form but him they saw not then he said unto them oh fools that wasn't a nice word that wasn't a really nice thing to say the preacher should always say nice things no just say what jesus said o fools and slow of heart o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken are not christ who have suffered see it wasn't that they didn't believe anything they didn't believe at all well fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded to them all the scriptures the things concerning himself hallelujah i'd loved to have been there starting at moses now he's not talking about moses life he's talking about moses writings which starts in genesis so starting at the beginning of the bible and all through the prophets he's talking to them the entire bible on the road to emmaus jesus now in another form one that they don't recognize him as jesus yet but he's breaking down to them the scripture starting at moses starting in genesis and going all the way through all the prophets he's taking the entire scripture the entire bible for his text and brother branham comes to christ is the mystery of god revealed showing the seventh seal and he says i take the entire bible for my text oh hallelujah friends here he comes in another form what form do you think that was that was the form of son of man in a prophet that was not a man taking christ the mystery of god revealed that was god in a man that was the son of man that was jesus christ in another form saying i will take the entire bible for my text these guys on the road to master said wow this guy is kind of smart he knows a lot and i'm sure as their heart's burning within them amen as they talk to them along the way it's like wow i never saw that wow where is he getting all this stuff see at that point all they could see was the form but they couldn't identify who it was i can see the form but i can't identify who it is so many times we can see the form and miss who it is well that's the form of brother branham no who is it who is it he who is it that opened the seals said christ opened the seals christ is those seals what is the opening of seals revealing christ it was christ in another form the form of an end-time prophet the form of a man revealing a son of man revealing the son of man quit looking at the form and start looking for the word made manifest the revealing of the word in our hour and then we'll recognize him hallelujah let's keep reading oh fools and slow of heart to believe all the prophets have spoken not not christ have suffered these things and entered into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the scriptures the things concerning himself what was the bible talking about him he goes back and reads adam and eve it's him abraham him moses him exodus him he's talking about him because this entire bible is christ and here is christ in another form and he's talking them out of the scriptures all things that are referring to him hallelujah how about when he starts to break down all things that referring to him as her [Applause] [Music] when he starts breaking down the scriptures and then he starts going through the scriptures to the entire bible and starts showing the seven seal mystery the threefold plan of god and gets into the second phone and starts showing everywhere in the bible he starts showing everything that pertains to him and her to him inside of her because her is him he called their name adam it was one hallelujah hallelujah let's keep reading 28 and they drew nigh into the village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone farther further but they constrained him saying abide with us for this toward evening oh evening time we've walked all day and now we've come to the evening time and the day is far spent and he went in to terry with them and it came to pass as he sat and meet with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them and their eyes were opened then say he changed his form didn't say all the sudden he showed him nail print no he didn't say he changed his form he said their eyes were open the problem wasn't with the form he was in the problem was in their spiritual eyesight don't ask him to change his form ask him to open our eyes lord don't change your form i'm going to say i'll believe you when i see i'll believe you in this i'll believe you in the meeting and there i'll believe that don't ask him to change his form so that we'll believe ask him to open our eyes so we'll see him whatever form he's in today [Music] amen and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us as he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures it was the third pull the opening of the word in the evening time and they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them which were with them saying the lord has risen indeed and hath appeared to simon and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking of bread he was known in breaking the bread breaking the bread of life breaking the man and breaking the word and their eyes were open when in the evening time now brother bam says in events made clear by prophecy from 1965 he said here's another thing they had done you know they had heard a six-hour sermon on prophecy being vindicated now brother branham he takes this uh six score furlongs his 60 furlongs and he breaks it down says about six miles he says some amazing things why does it matter that it was six miles and why does it matter that it was six hours [Laughter] hallelujah god is so good prophet doesn't leave anything undone they heard a six hour sermon on prophecy being vindicated that's what he talked to them along the road just as soon as they started down the road he stepped out for he was right there at jerusalem six hours later 60 furlongs they was right down the road six miles to emmaus 64 long six miles six hours that's what it is and he had preached confirming prophecy for six hours don't condemn me on three then amen but notice they had preached they had heard a six hour sermon on prophecy and being confirmed vindicated now it was getting along toward evening time you know he's the same yesterday today and forever brother graham's always trying to get you to read between the lines see the hear the unspoken part the thing that's not said and now it's getting along towards evening time you know he's the same yesterday today and forever it was then that he opened their eyes to know that hebrews 13 8 he's the same yesterday forever at the evening time events are made clear by prophecy what was he doing he was taking all the prophets and he was revealing things concerning himself and in the evening time everything that was going on in their life was made clear by the prophecy what's taken place in the modern hour can be easily what's taking place in the modern hour can be easily identified if you'll just believe the prophecy of the hour same thing further down in same messages notice when these disciples invited him in their fellowship around the table it was then that he'd done something just like he did before his crucifixion and their eyes come open they knowed his manner his style they knowed what he'd done and he did it amen he did it then just like he did before that's why brother branham shows us abraham on the plains of memory and he had his back to the tent beginning to discernment and brother branham and the sermon turns around and he turns around and starts discerning what's going on behind what's he doing he's showing he's doing something just like he did before to what so our eyes will come open amen so he can see that this is him amen now listen to this they knowed what he'd done and he did it then just like he did before and they said that's him and quickly they raised up to scream it out and he vanished and where they took six hours to listen to this sermon maybe 20 minutes they were light-footed back to tell the rest of them he is risen indeed he is really alive amen brother branham is showing us the scriptures showing us 64 long they're leaving jerusalem and now they begin walking in the church ages for six hours and for six hours six church ages he's with them in another form in the form of son of god he walks along and he talks to them about the word and and they get in at evening time after the six hour journey is done they're going to go into the seventh hour and the seventh hour is not going to take place in the journey it's going to take place in the privacy of the house around the table and they constrained him to come in and he came in so now we've come into the seventh hour and in the seventh hour in the seventh church age now he's going to reveal who has it been in the journey all along how will he identify himself he's got to do something just like he did it before he's got to create squirrels speak to a storm turn us back to a crowd open blinded eyes heal the lame heal epilepsy he's got to do something just like he did before in the seventh church age so that our eyes will come open and we'll recognize who has been in this journey all along the brother said it taken them six hours and that fast where do they go right back to jerusalem he turned their hearts back to the pentecostal fathers amen six hours journey six church ages but at the revealing hour amen in the small company not when anybody can walk past and hear what's being said not when anybody can join in on the conversation but when they went into the house and they invited him to the house and now he's going to do something and just like he did before and break the bread and their eyes were open and then he vanishes amen and then they run right back turn their hearts right back and go right back to the original place they started from right back to pentecost friends quit looking at forums and look for him the word made manifest let's go back well i've already quoted that genesis chapter 5 verse 1 i'll just quote again this is the book of the generations of adam and the day that god created man the likeness of god made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created brother branham says in christ the mystery god revealed notice now down through the ages he has been gradually letting this out slowly unfolding the mystery through the prophets and through the types now we can just go on that onto that and expressing himself he expressed himself in moses look moses born in the time of persecution of children he was born to be a deliverer he was hid in the bull rushes just like jesus was taken down into egypt he come out he went up to the mountain come back with the commandments jesus went up to the mountain his first sermon on the mount come back down with commandments you've heard them say them of old times thou shalt not commit adultery i say unto you who whoever look upon a woman to lust after has committed adultery lawgiver priest king leader just exactly so brother brahm's taking a little journey here in christ the mystery of god revealed and he's going back and he's showing all the types of jesus christ typing him and moses as law lawgiver timing him is he born at a time of persecution of children they were killing the babies in egypt when when moses was born herod was killing all all the baby boys amen in bethlehem when jesus was born he's showing all the types he's showing how moses was manifesting christ and he was speaking of christ coming that's why he says you have moses amen you you have moses you read moses moses testifies of me amen brother brennan is now showing us here christ the mystery of reveal it's not just when moses says god will send a prophet like unto me yes that's a prophecy of him coming but his whole life was testifying of his coming it wasn't just the words he pinned but his actual movements through life amen as he led them through an exodus amen as he as he did the things that he did his life was actually showing christ you have moses you believe moses moses wrote of me moses portrayed me moses amen he displayed what it was going to be like he goes on and says he expressed himself in joseph born amongst denomination his brethren they hated him without a cause because he was spiritual he saw visions god was with him he could interpret dreams his brothers hated him by his brethren he was sold by his brother and by almost 30 pieces of silver just exactly like he was sold by judas iscariot one of his brethren by 30 pieces of silver he was thrown into a ditch and supposed to be dead that's right the father in them was told he was dead that he's thrown into a ditch taken up and went to the right hand of pharaoh in the dungeon how he suffered there and there was two saved the butler and the baker one of them lost one was saved rather and one of them was lost and the other one saved just as on the cross when he was in prison house tacked to the cross for our sins became a prisoner one thief was lost and one was saved see just exactly then he became at the right hand of pharaoh the king that he dreamed that he had the vision that he would set at the king's feet and all authority in egypt was given to him his vision had to come to pass so brother branham and christ is mr god he starts showing us through the types not just the prophecies he's shown us through the types jesus christ was portrayed in moses he was they should have seen it they should have recognized it's the same thing further down he says now notice that through the types we could take even david as a spoken of a while ago going off his throne rejected by his own people going up the same mountain mount of olives as he's going over to his prison he was going to his prison house because he was rejected of his brother and of his own people he went up weeping that was the spirit of christ in him to be rejected as he looked out over jerusalem and wept and said jerusalem how oft i would a rejected king 800 years later the son of david stood on jerusalem up there above jerusalem and rejected and wept over jerusalem and said now your hour has come that's right all these things typed him just in time but yet the mystery was hid them men didn't know what they were doing they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do something now holding it back in the last days for the great revelation all of this is laying in the scriptures so that a prophet could come and pick it up and say this is that this is that this is that this is that didn't even understand why they were going through what they were going through and doing what they were doing but they were portraying christ so that when christ was come you could look back at the bible and say that's right that happened the most that's right to happen to joseph that's right that happened to david oh friends this is about to get fun just hang on pinch yourself wake up stand and shout wave your arms spin about whatever you got to do we're about to turn a corner here all those things typed him but they were holding it back in the last days for the great revelation but expressing it expressing himself in moses and david and joseph and elijah and on down through we could take each one of these prophets and bring their lives out and show it expresses jesus christ perfectly exactly yet never giving his secret and full waiting for for to make it known in the last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended see before he could express it if he told the whole thing what's brother graham talking about he's talking about the seventh seal he's talking about it hasn't been expressed it hasn't been made known it's been silenced it hasn't been told about amen but it's been expressed in every type in every character and all through the bible and the whole thing is expressing this great mystery that god has had in his mind the threefold purpose the seventh seal the coming of the lord it's all the same thing and he's expressing it all through the bible expressing it in moses expressing it in david expressing it in joseph so that in the end time a prophet of god could pick it up and show it and say i take the entire bible for my text all right keep going he never give a secret and full waiting for him to make known in the last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended see before he could express it if he told the whole thing because the bible is written in mysteries jesus thanked the father for it see that it was wrote in mysteries hallelujah it's still written in mysteries but it's not a mystery to the bride the mystery has been revealed amen the seals have been opened the mysterious thing's been unveiled and now we can see it brother branham said in the message spiritual amnesia from 1964 o soldier of the cross that's been shocked with so much training so many shocks of denomination and creed and things of the world why don't you just step off for a few minutes and go to looking around at the bible oh hallelujah what a wonderful statement friends he said all soldier of the cross and then he's talking to brothers and sisters and denominations and people have come through the nominations and he's saying you've been shocked with so much teaching of denomination and creed tells put a shock on you and he's preaching spiritual amnesia they were shocked and a shock that caused them spiritual amnesia they didn't know who they were and he said why don't you take a walk through the bible he's talking to people who have read the bible their whole lives but they've never really seen it they've seen this verse and this greek and this hebrew and that verse and they chop it all up they've never seen the one great love story they've never seen the threefold purpose they've never seen the seventh seal they've seen a book called ruth and they saw a book called job and they saw a book called this and that was the exodus but the exodus has nothing to do with he said won't you just take a walk through the bible a little bit he's telling a story about a man that was coming back i think from world war one and he got shell-shocked in the war and he forgot who he was and he was going through france on a train and and there was guards there watching them because they would wander off and this man gets off the train and and all of a sudden he has a funny look on his face man didn't know who he was didn't know who his parents were didn't know what his name was didn't know where he grew up didn't know anything about his past he was just living in the present that's how we were before the word came to us just living in the present just living for the now not knowing anything and i said he gets off the train and the train disembarked in his old hometown and he looks around and he begins to scratch his head and something begins to stir inside of him memories he didn't know he had feelings that he felt so long ago he begins to walk around and and as as revelation takes off in recognition of where he's at because he begins to move faster and faster goes to the end of town he turns right here and he goes down and he catches a path and he goes down the path and it leads him right up to an old front porch with an old man sitting on the porch and that was his home and that was his daddy and he said son i knew you'd come back i knew you would come back amen the familiarity of walking in his hometown and walking down old paths it began to break his spiritual amnesia and that's why brother bam said won't you go walking around the bible a little bit and let it break your spiritual amnesia but don't read it with intellect don't read it the way the denominations read the bible don't take a seminary idea we said i don't have a seminary idea i grew up in the message if you use your own reasoning and intellect it's a seminary idea if you say that word that bible means that and it can only mean that then you're stuck in the intellect brother said every prophecy has a natural and spiritual type and multiple fulfillments just let the prophet tell us what it means he says step off for a few minutes and go to looking around at the bible might wander around and you might find yourself identified here in the word as a believer one of these days you might find your identification in here how can i find my this was written long time ago about other people it wasn't written about me spiritual amnesia that what happened in the old testament doesn't have anything to do with the new testament church spiritual amnesia amen we're supposed to look around here until we find our identification in the bible our identity is in here amen all about us is in here he said you might not know him you may come to yourself like the prodigal son did and find yourself you might find your identification in the words of god so just for a few minutes before we close i want to take a little walk through the bible brother branham comes and the christ is the mystery of god revealed and he begins to show that that every type every character was showing this threefold purpose and showing christ so he shows him he shows the life of moses types it with christ the life of joseph types it with christ amen then he goes and he shows the life of david and he types it with christ and he starts to show the mystery of the first fold of the threefold purpose was laying in that bible all along you believe that the mystery of the first fold to get preeminence in a man he'd been working all through the prophets and all that building up like the legs the feet the head all the way coming to the head when jesus christ himself would come and cap that old testament body that's what the prophet tells us amen it was building up and he starts to show it and then so he shows the first fold of the threefold purpose and all the types but the mystery is he's also showing the second fold of the threefold purpose and all the types moses got married didn't he did he marry a jew he married a gentile moses as he's walking through and manifesting christ by his is a gentile bride the second fold of the threefold purpose is walking right through the scriptures as moses is unfolding the life of christ zipporah is there manifesting the bride of jesus christ everywhere you go in every christ type amen has a gentile bride he talks about joseph amen joseph he's separated from his brothers in the separation from the jews amen he goes into the gentiles and while he's there he gets asanath amen who's a gentile bride so joseph gets a gentile bride and before joseph can present himself to his brothers he sends his bride to the palace and then he sends her away so that he can reveal himself to the 144 thousand so all through the scriptures is not just jesus christ the man but also christ the bride is right there beside him in every story and every type marching right through when he shows himself as the kinsmen redeemer in the book of rome you see boaz and in boaz you see christ but in ruth you see the gentile bride [Applause] amen you go you go to to to abraham abraham sending away for his son to have a wife got to go back to the original birthplace amen's got to come from the same place amen even abraham had to marry a woman that came from the same father because jesus christ is marrying a woman that comes from the same father when he's looking for a son amen for isaac he sends his he sends his servant eliezer which is a type of brother branham sends them back to the homeland sends them back to the original origin to the original seed line they get a woman and everything that woman does is type the bride she waters tin camels amen those camels are the message that packs her to her isaac and then she listens to the message of eliezer she makes her own choice comes all the way back amen and meets isaac between home and the place she left she meets him in the field just like the meeting in the air you see it wasn't just jesus christ that would come in the form of a man that was manifest to the old testament the bride of christ is laying through the entire old testament if you look you'll see her she's there she's there with moses she's there with joseph she's there with david we talked about this when david goes down amen to destroy nabal nabal's the fool out of the family of caleb caleb's the gentile that was grafted into judah caleb's the dog amen and out of there he's married to to abigail and abigail a man is going to be rescued from her first marriage she was married wrong married to the full because we come to this earth buried wrong married to the full married to the first nature but she's going to be rescued when she recognizes the prophecy and the day that she lives at and speaks it to david she goes back and she tells neighbor all that old husband this is what i've done i've accepted the word of the hour and god kills nabal and david sends down and marries her and then david has a son by her and that second son his name means like his father what did she do she brought forth the image of her husband what's the bride to do to manifest christ again what did abigail do she manifest david again because the very name of the child means like his father see brother branham in christ mr god he's not just showing us you can see jesus christ you can see jesus christ jesus christ you can see bride of christ bride of christ we're mister mr jesus christ this mrs jesus christ is right there too there's been a hidden mystery all through the bible what is it it's the seventh seal amen what is the seventh seal preeminence and a man preeminence of the people restored back to an eaten condition it was in adam he made adam adam was alone but inside adam was his wife and it wasn't good that adam be alone so he laid him down took out the ingredients for the wife took the wife out amen there was a time that the wife was standing there how long we have no idea but adam was asleep because he had to raise adam up to join the two together so the woman was here adam was asleep and if somebody would come up and say what is this who is this the only answer you could give is adam because god never named this being god never named this figure it was adam who called her woman and it was adam who called her eve god called her adam he didn't give her a title he didn't give her a name her name your name was her identity and her identity was where she came from and this bride has come out of the side of jesus christ and her name is jesus christ [Applause] mrs jesus christ we don't take another name i'm not message this i'm not this i'm not pentecostal i am mrs jesus christ because i'm not taking another title or another name see the mystery of the seventh seal is in the bible show me the scripture read the whole thing open your eyes it's the road to emmaus he's here with us and he's taking the bible he's taking rachel he's taking rebecca amen he's taking sarah he's taking ruth he's taking esther he's taking abigail he's taking bathsheba he's taking rahab how many more do we have to mention till we realize that this old testament was prophesying of you and i standing here today that's why i say to you search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life but they are they that speak of us the bride we're there in the bible just the same as jesus christ was there in the scriptures the bride of jesus christ is laying there right next to him every time brother branham points there's a bride right there everything you point to say there's christ there but there's his bride there too there's christ there there's his bride there too there's christ there there's his bride there too hallelujah everywhere you look it's there we open up the new testament matthew first book of the bible first thing you do is go into the genealogies of jesus christ and there you'll find four women tamar gentile rahab gentile ruth gentile and then it doesn't say bathsheba says the wife of uriah and uriah was a hittite what's happening he's opening up the new testament and he's laying in there the mystery of the bride in chapter one and we've come to the end of time it's been laying there it's a secret he never let it be known he just laid it in the bible in a mysterious secret way and you say you're making something of it i'm preaching the same way the prophet preached laying that mystery in the bible because you can't add one word to it you can't take one word from it laying in the bible and you come down to our day and he's taken the veil off of it and now you can see i know why it was rahab i know why it was tamar i know why it was ruth i know why it was bathsheba and then as soon as he finishes the genealogies as soon as immediately when he's done with the genealogies he said there was a virgin named mary what's the new testament telling us jesus christ fulfilled the old testament now something's happening this new testament brother brahman said what is the word bride the new testament that's all he is the old testament she's the new testament bridegroom and bride united together now the apostle paul can come now and say for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother amen be joined to his wife and they too shall be one flesh and he says i speak a great mystery this is a great mystery what do you mean a mystery we've always known that a man leaves his father they get married to become one flesh that's not mystery that's all the way back in genesis we've known that for thousands of years but paul is taking what's been laying in the word for thousands of years and he's going to bring it up to date and bring a revelation out of the word that has been written for thousands of years he says but i speak to you a great mystery concerning christ and his bride that story all the way back there adam and the woman and cleaving that's really the seventh seal unfolding that's really the mystery laying there in a mysterious way it's in plain view everybody can see it but without eyes to see you can't see it jesus was walking with those two on the road to a mass everybody could walk by could see the third man but who's the third man everybody can see mary but who's mary everybody can see elizabeth who's elizabeth everybody can see amen christ and his bride christ in his church but who is it amen just watch open your eyes let the let the that christ and the form he's in today come around and expound upon the scriptures and open our eyes of understanding that we will see there she is there she is there she is there she is there she is there she is all through the scriptures i say search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life but they are they that testify of me [Music] [Applause] have you ever read the book of ruth have you ever said that to me you ever read about rahab the harlot that's me have you ever read about mary magdalene ill-famed woman seven devils never said that's me you ever read about the woman in the what the well of samaria with six husbands amen five husbands the one she's with is not hers and now she's come through six church ages she's here in a messed up condition and she's gonna meet jesus christ the seventh and you can read that and say that's not just about a woman at the world that's about me and that's about today amen there's a woman with a blood issue 12 years that's not just about a woman with a blood issue that's about god healing his jewish children see it's not about what you can carnally understand it's by spiritual revelation the mysteries have been revealed mysteries we want it hard we want it dotted eyes and cross teeth no it's the mystery it's in the types it's laying in the shadows we've read it for thousands of years but now we know who ruth represents thousands of years we know who rahab represents who the woman of the well represents we know who this little harlot woman who took the alabaster box and broke it at jesus feet to get forgiveness of sins because her faith had saved her now we know who that is that's me search the scriptures they are they that testify of the bride where do you guys get that you point open the bible and point and i'll show it to you you pick a story pick noah i'll show it to you they had to go in with wives pick a story flip through your bible point any old testament story you want show it to me you're going to find that all through the bible is the mystery of the bridegroom and the mystery of the bride that's why brother brennan christ is a mystery talks about the threefold purpose and takes for his text the entire bible oh my there's so many there's no no way to get all of them but we come to the end of the book of the bible in the book of revelation revelation 21 and 9 says and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials huh i wonder who that is one of the seven there's not 21 angels there's only seven angels in the book of revelations seven angels having which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will shew thee the bride the lamb's wife who which angel one of the seven which angel showed john john's the type of the bride which angel showed john the lamb's wife showed her in the types showed her in the stories showed her in the bible showed her it was brother branham it was the seventh angel we've come to the end now when he's showing us who this really is where she is what she looks like and i say to you search the scriptures search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life but they are they would testify of me and you and the bride around the world it's those same scriptures that testify to christ are the same ones that testify to us let's let's finish by going to mark 16. we'll finish it up here mark 16 and 9. mark 16 9 says and now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils and she went and told them what had been that that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that it was that he was alive and it's been seen of her believed not verse 12 after that he appeared in another form in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it unto the residue neither believe they them it doesn't matter how how much he reveals the word to them how much they can say about the scriptures that was unfolded because they didn't see his nail prints they didn't believe their testimony i saw him how did you see him oh he was in another form it wasn't the one that we saw it wasn't the one we were in the boat with it wasn't the one that we ate with it was another form but it was him just the same i don't know about that i won't believe it until i stick my finger jewish blessed is he who doesn't see and yet believes we're starting again they went and told it into the residue neither believed they them afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and unbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not when he believed not them which he had seen him after he was risen who did they see him not in the same form they saw him in a different form and when they didn't believe them because it was a different form then jesus comes and he rebukes them for their hardness of heart they're living by the head not by the heart because their heart would tell them it's true but that old carnal thinking that old mind of man would limit what the heart knows to be true already amen we gotta have the mind of christ and let the heart and then let what god placed within us before the foundation of the world let faith rise up out of the heart and say that's true in acts 9 the apostle paul he's walking every riding or whatever he's doing on the road to damascus amen and he goes along and all of a sudden there's a bright light that appears and he and he says here in verse 3 and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly they're shined around about him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him now brother bram said it was the pillar of fire hear the voice saying unto him sauce all why persecute us thou me and he said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus [Music] i am jesus he wasn't even in a flesh body he was a light he was a pillar of fire and the pillar of fire now was talking and the pillar of fire said i am jesus and brother brethren said we've come to the day amen where the holy ghost has been bound for nearly two thousand years by creeds and dominance but have been loose in the evening time by the evening time message the holy ghost back in the people again and he says the pillar of fire back in the church what was the pillar of fire jesus said it is jesus i am jesus not jesus part two not jesus half not jesus light but i am jesus this light that you're looking at i don't see nail prints i don't see the body on the cross forget the body on the cross he said i am jesus [Applause] the pillar of fire identified itself and brother branham tells us where the pillar of fire is now where's the pillar of fire in the bride [Applause] so where's jesus we're sitting here and one day he'll get up my goodness read the bible believe the word amen the body can sit in the sanctuary of god but his personal presence can come and he can say i am jesus without the nail print body it was the same lord jesus christ talking to the apostle paul and furthermore he says why are you persecuting me why are you persecuting me who are you paul as far as we know never laid a finger on jesus in his earthly body jesus of nazareth as far as we know he never had any physical contact but who was he persecuting he was persecuting the church and jesus didn't say why do you persecute my church he didn't say why do you persecute my bride [Applause] he said why do you persecute me who are you lord who is it i'm persecuting where was the light ye are the light of the world the light is in you you are the light now that light is shining and blinding paul by the light the same light that was in the bride the same light he was persecuting he was touching flesh it wasn't the flesh he was referring to it was the light on the inside why are you persecuting me who are you lord i am jesus whom you persecute that means when paul was going down there and he broke up a house meeting and he was arresting a woman and he grabbed a little child amen and he had his people grabbing soldiers grabbed the husband and he handcuffed them all together and leading them away he was persecuting jesus because jesus was in another form a form that he did not recognize but the revelation on the road to damascus began to identify who it was he was arresting he was persecuting jesus christ in another body praise god that's the word of god let's go to second john we are winding down we are wrapping up we are i hope we are believing the word how does that make sense i don't know go back and talk like nicodemus if you want to talk like nicodemus do i have to go back into the womb are you son of man here i don't want to talk like nicodemus i want to answer like peter they are christ the son of the living god how did you know that i haven't got a clue how i knew that i just know it it wasn't my teaching it wasn't i i mean he was ignorant and unlearned brother branham said he couldn't even sign his own name couldn't even read he wasn't pulling out the scroll and saying it's right there it was something in peter that could identify that that's nothing but the truth what was it in hattie right humble humble humble woman where could she go to the scriptures and where could she pull it up and say a voice of god one day is going to talk into the woods into a prophet and he's going to say make whatever you want and that prophet is going to say i want three squirrels and coming from here and here she had zero scriptures zero scriptures and when brother bam told the story she said that ain't nothing but the truth and god loved it so much that she would say that with no scriptures but was it god it was nothing but god and she had something in her could recognize what that prophet saying is nothing but the truth what scripture are you referencing hattie i don't know where did you hear that before i've never heard it before how do you know it's true i don't know but i know it's nothing but the truth and god so loved it he told the prophet to stand on his feet and he told him he says whatever you ask for do you realize how much god loved what that woman said whatever you asked for he gave her the power to change the entire universe brother baby said whatever you say whatever you ask for if you haven't got it instantly he goes i'm a false prophet a million dollars it'll be in your life whatever you want healing of your sister whatever you want god's not trying to get us to figure something out dissect something learn something start a new message seminary he wants people who can catch the revelation of the hour they're living in and recognize that's nothing but the truth how do you know i don't i believe unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood that's a hard saying but what if and the son of man showed a sin where he came from before many of them left him turns to his disciples will you go also peter says where are we going to go i can't even read the bible where are we going to go i've never had theological training i can't even read the bible all i know is fishing nets and fishing and and all i know is when the moon rises full on an overcast day there'll be a good spot out there the fish that's all i know about all i know is stitching in that all i know is survival i don't know anything other than that where else are we going to go you alone have the words of eternal life where else are we going to go to matthew henry's commentary we're going to go charles spurgeon's writing the message has the word of god i don't know anything else all i know is bending nets and trying to survive and making a paycheck all i've ever known all my life is how to get through school and how to get some money and buy some groceries and raise some babies and change some diapers how are we going to figure it out not by intellect friends but something something on the inside was there before the foundation of the world that same thing that was in hattie right the same thing brother branham the same thing in paul the apostle the same thing and you and i can say that's nothing but the truth figure it out all right no way write you a bible study i'd be lost before i got started but it's truth i know it's truth that doesn't mean god doesn't want to reveal it doesn't mean he won't show it out of his word everything comes out of the word but it doesn't come out of an intellectual understanding of the word jesus didn't bring it intellectually they had all the intellect in the world they had the whole bible figured out yes the day jesus was here and he would pull scriptures out and apply it to his day and they'd be like how i mean when he was 12 years old they were astonished at his teaching how can he put these things how can he handle the word that way because he is the word second john 1 7. for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh has come will come is come when jesus was in the pillar of fire talking to the apostle paul he said why you persecute me paul was persecuting flesh who's flesh jesus is flesh he said why do you persecute me he was living as a son of god and the holy ghost in that little church let's read this again verse 7 for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist that scripture applies just the same today as it did the day it was written brother branham says in the rising of the sun that's that divine revelation of the word made flesh the divine revelation the word made flesh it was flesh and that day by the sun the groom it is fleshed today by the bride the invisible union of the bride of christ he says in jesus the word took my place he became me that a sinner that i might become him the word amen let me hold true to it not to the church the word amen oh that spiritual union of christ in his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested vindicated just what the bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day how many can say it's happening day by day the flesh is becoming the word and the word is becoming flesh and anyone that will deny that jesus christ is come in the flesh is a deceiver and an antichrist he will come in the flesh no he's come in the flesh right now in the flesh of his bride in your flesh in my flesh don't deny the lord don't deny what he told paul don't deny the scriptures just believe it how does it all work what's the chemistry and the mechanics and who's where how much this and who cares just believe the word believe the prophet believe the message he says he's here jesus part two jesus light or is it jesus christ himself manifest in the flesh the flesh of his church we know that body's coming the same one that was nailed to the cross we'll see it and we'll worship him in that form it's that form that it receives eternal worship in and we long to see it but i'm not waiting till i see that to believe that he's here or to believe that he's come in our day because i can see him right here i can see him all around me in the manifestation of the hour and everything that's taken place is pointing to the same thing bible days are here again we're living this word out this word is flesh now in a mini-membered body the flesh of jesus christ living the word out for our day right here 2018 soon to be 2019 it's still going on i say god give us eyes to see search the scriptures they are they that testify of this bride let's all stand god bless you saints we love you it's good to be together that was my christmas message [Laughter] amen why has he come to bear witness of the truth why are we here to bear witness of the truth he come to be a light why are we here to be a light whatever he was she is praise god i say god let it be today not tomorrow some other time let it be today that this great manifestation takes over my life day by day it's happening let's pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord we ask all that you would move upon us lord jesus god that you would forgive us for our stupidity lord all we know that these carnal minds are not fit to understand your revelation to grasp what you're doing in this day we're just as unfit lord as all they were that were in jerusalem when you were there when you were gone up to the temple to worship and you began to preach lord god there was some that could believe there was some that would reason and not understand but lord forgive us for relying on the wrong kind of understanding let us rely lord on that faith that you've put inside of us that seed that you have locked in us before the foundation of the world we need you lord jesus we need you to unlock the mystery for us and we may have eyes to see and ears to hear all that you have for us in this day let us search the scriptures for they are they that testify this second fold of your threefold purpose god bless your people as we go so many of us will be gathering with families over the next couple days lord i pray that you let us be a light that shines in darkness let us be a light that sits on a candlestick lord if there's opportunity put words into our mouth lord let us not think what we will say or do in that hour but lord i pray that we just yield ourselves in that you would take control speak to the lost lord bring light to dark places god that you may be honored and you may be glorified in every setting we find ourselves in in every place we go let us go bearing you lord bringing you on the scene in every situation let us see who we are lord what we are what our we live in and what you're doing inside of us through us and to us god i pray that your light would shine brighter than it's ever shined before and your little bride in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you saints got a song well this is the evening time it's later than you think [Laughter] [Music] the bride is preparing them for her lord to me all things the evening time is here
