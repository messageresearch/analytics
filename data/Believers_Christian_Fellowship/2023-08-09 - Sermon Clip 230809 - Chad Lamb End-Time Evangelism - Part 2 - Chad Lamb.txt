so what is end time Evangeline finding the stones and it's also shaping the stones so now it you can take this and this is where I want to take this understanding you can take this and say okay we we have to shape people into sons of God well my goodness you can shape all day long if they're not already sons of God you're not going to shape them in the sons of God all the preaching and all the shaping and all the doctrine and all the rules and all the legalism none of it will ever turn anybody into a Son of God but brother Brenham says you have to shape them and get them to quit this and stop that and square them up and get them to fit in it can be confusing it's like so do we shape them or or how do we shape them and listen all that we're doing amen is we're taking the word of God and we're presenting the word of God and that word of God Amen will cause somebody to reject part of their natural life and for forsake their own thinking and forsake their habits forsake their family tradition lay them all down so that the Son of God that's on the inside can grow to manifestation and not be hindered by the hindrances of the outside man to me this is shaping the stones not making something that's not a son into a son but no by the word of God by the preaching by the fellowship by whatever tool God uses amen taking and lopping off the things that aren't in the seed amen lopping off things that are hindering the growth just like the father is the husband man what's the husband been doing he's cutting off everything that's not bearing fruit snip snip snip snip snip he's not making it a Vine he's not making it a branch he's not turning it into something it's not what he's doing is the husbandman has found a Vine he's found a branch and that branch has the potential to bear fruit it's an original it's taking life out of the root so what's he doing he's he's clipping off everything that's dead and he's taking the vine and he's cleaning it purging it bringing it up putting it into place so that it can manifest the life that's on the inside of it so for me shaping the stones is not turning something that's not a son into a son it's not making somebody look like a Christian act like a Christian amen go along with Christians that's not in time evangelism end time evangelism is preaching the word of God because the word of God is calling for the life to come out of the seed it's calling for manifestation it's drawing life out but the word of God is also corrective it's also telling you what's not the life of Christ what is not his motive what is not his objective what is not his goal in this day what his character is not so that you can repent and say God forgive me take that out of my life a husbandman come and prune this out of me so that I can be the full potential of the life of the inside
