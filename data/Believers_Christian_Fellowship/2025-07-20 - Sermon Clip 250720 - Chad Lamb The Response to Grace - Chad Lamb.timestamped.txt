[0:00] Now, there's a reason the prophet tells
[0:02] us to put on your spiritual thinking
[0:03] anointed jacket
[0:05] &gt;&gt; because he wants us to understand
[0:07] something more than what happened in the
[0:09] book of Zachchariah and what happened
[0:11] hundreds of years ago. He wants to bring
[0:13] it right up to what's going on right
[0:15] now.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; And he says now he laid the foundation.
[0:19] And as we read on farther, we find out
[0:21] that God said Zerubbabel has laid the
[0:23] foundation with his hands. He also shall
[0:26] bring forth the headstone. I want you to
[0:28] notice he never said he shall bring
[0:30] forth the cornerstone. He shall bring
[0:32] forth the headstone.
[0:34] And we know that the scripture says that
[0:36] Jesus is the chief cornerstone. And he's
[0:39] also the headstone. Now, if we will
[0:42] think for a few minutes, the seventh
[0:44] church messenger was to restore the
[0:47] faith of the children back to the
[0:48] fathers. In other words, rebuild the
[0:51] church again under the power of the
[0:52] spirit. Not by power, not by might, but
[0:55] by my spirit. He's quoting Zechariah. By
[0:58] my spirit, sayith the Lord, not by
[0:59] organization, not by denomination, but
[1:01] by the Holy Spirit. God will bring forth
[1:03] the church in the last day. Zerubbabel
[1:05] the prince with Joshua was the one that
[1:08] was to bring forth this headstone. He
[1:10] had laid the foundation. He had to took
[1:12] the people back to the foundation in
[1:15] type. Brother Re's telling us now the
[1:18] seventh angel is going to do the same
[1:20] thing that Zerubbabel is doing. He's
[1:21] tying the ministry of Zerubabel to the
[1:23] ministry of the seventh angel. and the
[1:25] ministry of the seventh angels, the
[1:26] seventh church age messenger which is
[1:28] William Brham and he came to do what?
[1:31] Bring us out of Babylon which was
[1:33] denominationalism
[1:35] &gt;&gt; and bring us back to a restoration of
[1:37] the temple of God. What is the temple of
[1:39] God? The church is the temple of God.
[1:41] You are the habitation of God. You are
[1:43] the temple of the Holy Ghost. And he
[1:45] goes back to the foundation because Paul
[1:47] says, "I laid the foundation." And he
[1:50] brings us back to the foundation that
[1:52] Paul laid. That's why brother Brennham
[1:53] taught what Paul taught.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; Tied together the loose ends. And so he
[1:57] brought us back. Amen. And begin to
[1:59] build on that. But at the end of his
[2:01] ministry, he's going to bring forth.
[2:03] Amen. What? Christ again. The
[2:05] headstone's going to come down to cap
[2:07] off this church, to cap off this temple
[2:10] in the end time under the ministry of
[2:12] the seventh angel. And what is going to
[2:14] be crying? Amen. Unto that unto that
[2:17] that that headstone that's coming down,
[2:20] the headship that's coming to the
[2:21] church. is going to be crying out grace,
[2:24] grace unto it. Amen. Because this
[2:26] building realizes it's your grace. Your
[2:29] grace. A double emphasis on grace.
[2:32] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a church, a bride at
[2:34] the end time. And she's going to know
[2:36] she had nothing to do with it. It's
[2:38] purely by the grace of God. And we've
[2:40] come to the capping of the the pyramid,
[2:43] the capping of the temple, the headship
[2:45] of Christ to unify with his body. And
[2:47] what is the what is the major
[2:49] declaration at that time? Grace.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; Grace.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace.
