Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday it's exciting it's been a while since we've had that many services together so praise God it's an exciting time amen I've been looking forward to this we tried to have brother Daniel come last year but with all the restrictions and the borders and all the things it was not possible but God opened the door and made a way but it hasn't been easy as a brother he sure had his challenges amen I found out yesterday that his Visa was held up as he's traveling through Canada he needed a Canadian visa he didn't get it till he got to the airport to fly out I said brother I'm glad I didn't know that then when they got here the they were in Toronto to come into the United States they got to cross through customs U.S customs in Toronto U.S customs literally shut the door in their face 8 30 were closed in your in their face and I told him I said I'm ashamed of America so ashamed they had to stay another night travel through Washington DC come back then when they landed they lost three pieces of their luggage which they just recovered this afternoon when they told me all of that I said brother I can't wait to hear what God has in store for us because that's a whole pile of resistance but you know through it all God is good amen and you can't ever blame the devil for trying that's what he's supposed to do but I thank God God always makes a way through every obstacle and here we are tonight amen I'm thankful and let's stand together and we'll invite brother Daniel to come take his Liberty and may may we pull to the point that he can relax and rest and let God use the channel the gift to minister to our hearts rather Jesus we just want to thank you yeah we just want to thank you Jesus we just want to thank you to thank for me so good [Music] amen amen the Lord bless you tonight you can take your seats for a moment [Music] brother sing another song that song that you we came out on LOL well greetings from Australia it's uh quite a ways over here but it's a real honor and privilege to be here with you all and we just feel like royalty we're being treated like royalty we want to thank all the sisters that supplied the the food in the house that we're staying in and it's a real real treat for us and we we feel honored and privileged on behalf of the family we'd just like to thank you all I did bring my support crew it was the best crew that I could bring so it's uh they feel very honored also to be here with you and it had certainly been a struggle to get here but we understand if God has a plan and Satan knows that plan he tries to interrupt it you know that's okay to us it's it's no big in fact it encourages us when uh when these things happen Satan don't understand it because he does it to discourage us but it becomes an encouragement so uh we thank the Lord that we're here we may have been here a little late we may have not had all our luggage but we're here safe and we know that we're in the will of God being here and we trust that the services will be a blessing to you all and uh not coming to minister anything wild and new or just coming to be a blessing and Minister what God places upon our heart and I know if God places something on our heart then it's here for someone it may be just for one but we're a body of Christ and we're all gonna one at one time we're going to be in the same place amen amen by his grace so we uh we just want to thank you for the opportunity to be here thank you to brother Chad and family God bless you and uh it's just a real honor amen amen I'm man a few words but uh so you'll just have to put up with my um my lack of introduction but here we are and God bless you praise the Lord amen let's stand to our feet amen I just want to sing this song again it's a wonderful song thanks brother God bless you Lord we come to you In Worship no matter what the circle stands no matter what the situation oh foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] amen amen thank you brother thank you musicians the Lord bless you we appreciate you very much amen let's turn in our Bibles tonight to the book of Book of Joel very familiar scriptures here brother Franco you could put that first slide up thanks bro amen Joel chapter two we're just going to read verse 23 25. we want the Lord to have the Liberty tonight amen we want the Lord to be the preeminent one uh amongst us we may have our thoughts and our ideas but um praise God he he's got all things in control amen Joel chapter 2 verse 20 23 be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the flaws shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore unto you the years that the locusts hath eaten the canker worm the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you amen if we could turn to the Book of John thought tonight is that the restoration of true worship the restoration of true worship John chapter 4 verse 19. we're just cutting into this story here but I think we know it well enough woman at the well the woman saith unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship in Jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour Commerce and now is I just want to pay attention to that verse 23 I believe that the hour cometh is speaking of this time in which we are living in now the hour cometh and now is when the true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen amen I've got Revelations 21 here but I'm just going to change that we're going to go to the Book of Genesis chapter 22 Genesis 22 we're going to look at this story tonight Genesis 22 verse 5. foreign and Abraham said unto thee to his young men abide ye here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again unto you amen let's bear our hearts tonight our heavenly father Lord it certainly is a privilege and honor Lord to be in service for you Lord Jesus we just dedicate ourselves to this very moment Lord this very hour and in which you have allowed us to be here on this Earth Lord Lord may you do the impossible in our lives Lord may you do Lord for us Heavenly Father perhaps what we've tried to do for ourself for so long and yet Lord the things that are impossible for us to do in our own lives Lord God are possible for you Lord there is nothing too hard for you there is nothing that you cannot achieve Lord there's there's nothing that cannot be done heavenly father so Lord we just dedicate this time to your hands Lord we dedicate ourselves into your hands heavenly father that you Lord God might achieve Lord God what you had ordained to achieve before the foundation of the world through this night Lord God Bless the people that are here Lord we pray in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen God bless you you can take your seats tonight amen so like I was saying there the the thought here is the the restoration of true worship and as a as a subtitle here I've got the the Lord's desire for you we see here in the Book of John uh chapter four Jesus is saying here but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth so we understand that that is thus saith the Lord we understand that that there is no question whether that is going to come to pass or not come to pass we understand that this is going to come to pass but I believe that who this is going to come to pass who who is God going to give this it says the hour comethan now is when the worshiper who who are those worshipers because I believe that those worshipers God has ordained worshipers to be here in this hour not just to worship him but to worship Him in spirit and in truth amen I love this last part of this verse 23 for that father seeketh such to worship Him amen for the father seeketh such to worship him it's not some a place it's not a thing that we can do of ourself but it's so it's God's desire for you amen we understand that this within Fellowship today this come up a few times that we are not looking for a church experience we are not looking for a church walk we are not even looking for a family experience or a family walk we are not looking as a husband and wife walk we are looking at at a walk that God wants with us individually behold I send you amen not a group but the individual behold I send you the prophet of God says in the in the writing to the late I see in church age to him that overcome us he said that is not a church that is not a group that is not a family that is an individual amen that is an individual so God's desire for you as an individual is to worship Him in spirit and in truth amen and and whether we we understand that's my desire I desire to worship Him in spirit and in truth amen I I believe that the true worshiper I believe that this woman here that Jesus was speaking to I believe her desire was to Worship in spirit and in truth but in the confusion of the of the church or whatever was going on in that day there had to be a personal visit of our Lord Jesus Christ to that individual that allowed her to take that position and worship in spirit and in truth amen now I believe if that was God what God wanted for her that's what God wants for you and that is our desire because our desires are only the result of God's desire for you amen my desire the desire that I have to worship Him in spirit and in truth is because it's his desire for me to worship Him in spirit and in truth amen he's not going to come to me because I have a desire but he's going to come to me because I he placed that desire in there amen as the predestinated seed of God as a predestinated seed of God he wants you he desires to for you to worship Him in spirit and in truth I love that because he seeketh such amen he seeketh such amen it's not you finding him he's seeking you amen he he wants you to worship Him amen the prophet of God said he said he loves to be worshiped amen but there's a there's a there's a special people don't like when we talk like this but it's the truth the the the the elect are a special group of people amen and the elect are the are a group of people who can worship him like no other like Noah there is no one on the face of this planet that that satisfies me more than my wife amen amen because she is my elect I elected her amen and he elected me amen and because of his election he desires My Worship amen he desires me to worship him he he's he seeketh you amen he seeketh you he seek he's seeking me amen not not Living Word Fellowship in Australia not BCF in in Ohio but as an individual amen he seeketh you amen all right Dan but I'm only 21. it don't matter how old you are it don't matter how young you are amen if God is seeking you you we it as a worshiper then he will find you amen because God doesn't look for anything and not find it amen because he he he's God Amen so those that he has chosen before the foundation of the world to to worship Him in spirit and in truth he's his he sets out to find them he sets out to to reveal himself to to them as individuals so that they can worship Him in spirit and in truth amen we want to be everything that God wants us to be amen but there's a catch to this and that is that you can't make yourself what he desires you to be you are totally dependent upon him to be who he has ordained you to be there's nothing that you can do to make yourself better there's nothing that you can do to to help God achieve his purpose oh we like that you've got a hand at times huh let me help you with that Lord yeah oh it doesn't work quite like that we find that out after if you've lived a few years you know you find that out that the the more you try to help God the more of a mess you make and all you're doing is making more work for him and he's just saying just let me do what I am ordained to do Amen Let me do what only I can do you just think you can do it but you can't do it just just leave it up to me amen but our desire is to be everything that God has ordained us to be but we are totally dependent upon him bringing us to that place of maturity where we can be what we are ordained to be because we can only be what we are ordained to be through maturity as we mature amen as we stay in the presence of the son amen so as a worshiper I I call it Progressive worship because as we mature it allows us to worship at a higher level now when I say worship don't get confused with singing or or or um playing an instrument because worship is not restricted to playing of instruments or singing a song because I can't play an instrument and I I can sing but I don't know if you call it singing all right so if it was restricted to that that rules me out either that I have to wait for God to give me a gift to be able to play a guitar I'd love to be able to play a guitar but that's not what that's not what worship is restricted to in fact our life is worship amen You by coming to church this morning this evening you're worshiping God you might say well brother Dan I'm not singing you don't need to sing you're worshiping God by coming to church amen so it's the the restoration of true worship this is something that God has allowed us to be or to do is to worship Him amen and it's a restoration God has restored worship because he's restored the word and worship and and the worship and the word are connected we'll see this in Genesis 22 because Abraham went to worship stay here while I and the son go to worship go and worship well I don't think they sung a song right but what they were doing was walking in the light of the word of the revealed wood amen let's not get too far ahead of ourselves all right all right the the the beautiful thing about this is that the Lord desires this for your life amen this is just so so wonderful that brother Brown says it's a it's a love story and this is exactly what it is God desires this for you it's his desire for you to worship Him in spirit and in truth amen amen little dry but there's plenty of water around here so amen amen so we want to thank the Lord for the opportunity that he's given us to be able to worship Him and I know this isn't the beginning of the special meetings but I just can't help it this is going to lead into the the next Services as well but um we we want to we want to worship the Lord we want to be who we are ordained to be in the offices that God has given us amen because we can't rely on anyone else's experience we can't rely or you know my wife is worshiping God therefore I'm worshiping God God I'm in a different office to my wife I'm a father I'm a husband she's a she's a wife and a mother it's a different office you know so God desires to be worshiped fully fully in the in the offices that we hold so I've got a few slides here and I'll just um we'll just begin this this story here in uh in Genesis 22. um I I and the lad will go and worship we've looked at that one there we'll just start here in Genesis chapter one and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham we know that means to try Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am so we want to notice here that God was not talking to Abram but God was talking to Abraham all right so we understand the process of this we understand that this is that God had given Abraham Abram a part of his own name and that that that signified the marriage when a man marries a a woman she takes on a part of his name all right so we understand that this was God speaking to a to a man who God had formed a relationship with that had already been in Union as if we can bring it into our time in which we are living in you know they were they were in Union Abraham had received the sign of circumcision he had taken on a part of God's name so he had we could say he'd received the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon his soul and God wanted to mature Abraham he wanted to take Abraham to a another level of worship so this was all about a relationship that God had established between himself and Abraham right God sought Abraham Abraham didn't seek God but God sought Abraham and found Abraham and Abraham said unto him behold here I am so we can see that this is all about a relationship that God had with an individual and this is the same thing that God wants with me this is the same thing that God wants with you I I haven't reached the Pinnacle of maturity as a husband I've been married for 28 years but I'm still learning I'm still maturing in in that office all right so no matter how no matter where we are if God is still speaking to us the purpose of this relationship that you have with God is that he might bring you to full maturity amen but it's all about a relationship with the Lord and it's so important for us to to stay in tune with the voice of God Amen and to be able to hear that voice and not only hear the voice but respond to that voice when that that voice is speaking to us in Jeremiah 29 11 it says for I know the the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end so we understand this and God God had thoughts towards Abraham God had thoughts towards Abraham when he was Abram all right but when after the union after that Union as bring it again into our time after that Union God still had thoughts towards Abraham that had not been revealed yet all right so just because we received the Holy Ghost just because we come become new creatures in Christ it it God still has thoughts concerning you amen and how we mature is by the unveiling or by the revealing of those thoughts amen and I I my desire is to know the thoughts of God concerning me amen I think this is such a beautiful thing because this is how a husband and wife work yeah if what a wife desires to know is the thoughts of her husband concerning her amen there's no the wife won't find satisfaction out of the out of the words of her husband she won't find it but that the husband can bring satisfaction she can he can bring peace to his wife by just expressing how he loves her how he appreciates her etc etc and God is doing the same thing here with with Abraham because God had thoughts concerning Abraham that Abraham did not know anything about he did not know anything about perhaps when Abraham um was finally a son to that that promise a father to the promised son perhaps he thought he'd reached his full potential but God had other thoughts amen God had other thoughts and we know that the scripture says I and the lad will return so this is quite some time after the after Isaac had been born but God has an appointed time also when those thoughts are to be revealed amen and this proves to us that we cannot reach maturity without the unveiling without the revealing of God's thoughts concerning us as an individual amen it's not a group it's not a church it's an individual affair amen and I I love this so much because it places me in a position where I I can't I can't be dependent upon anybody else I'm just purely relying upon God to allow me to be who I'm ordained to be how could John in the Book of Revelation come up higher if God didn't ask him to come up higher how could John come up higher if God didn't send a spirit down if to catch up John and bring him up higher amen John didn't try and build a ladder or build an escalator or elevator or something like that no sir God right John was Reliant upon the spirit of God catching him up and lifting him up into Heavenly places amen because now John had a new message now he had an Earthly message now he had a Heavenly message he was seeing Earthly things but then God took him up and now he was writing the Heavenly things what he saw in heaven amen so God has thoughts concerning you amen God has thoughts concerning you and those thoughts here are expressed in Psalm 40. many O Lord my God are they wonderful Works which thou has done and thy thoughts which are to us would they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee for if if I would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered amen that's a lot of thoughts amen and and we are we are not we are not meant to try and presume what those thoughts are and God doesn't want you to presume what those thoughts are amen because when we presume anything we go forward without Authority we we just mess things up there's there's no confidence in it amen but if God has thoughts towards you he's not going to keep those thoughts to himself but he's going to reveal those thoughts it's his desire for you to know the thoughts amen it's his desire for you to know the thoughts that he has toward you amen amen I think that's just such a a beautiful uh it puts God in his place in our lives amen and that's what we want to do we want to take our position under under the headship of Christ amen as as his as his bride so God God has thoughts concerning you he wants you to know those thoughts God has thoughts uh to Abraham and now God was going to reveal those thoughts those thoughts that Abraham knew nothing about God says to Abraham he says take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of there's a couple of things here we want to notice here the beginning there it says take now thy son thy only son I thought Isaac had two uh Abraham had two sons but God didn't recognize the first birth amen God only recognized the faith birth amen so this wasn't even on the cards here is this the only son amen so so Satan wants to point you to your first birth but God doesn't even recognize your first verse it's just pointing you to the second verse amen you must be born again amen and that's what enabled God to be able to come now because God couldn't say these things earlier on he had to wait for that Faith seed to come to life and now God could come and speak certain things to uh to Abraham concerning Isaac take now thy son their only son whom thou lovest you know God doesn't if you have many you don't mind parting with one but when you only have one it's deity right so God doesn't want something that is like second in your life he wants something that's first in your life he wants something that you only have one off and we only have one life on this Earth Amen in this in this body we only have one life and this is what God wants from us it meant he want he wants the thing that we have and that is the life that he has given us he wants us to give back to him what he has given to us amen and get thee into the land of Mara and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of so we see here that there were more than one mountain there was more than one mount because it says it says offer upon one of the mountains so there was one mountain and there was mountains but God had a desire for Abraham to offer Isaac as a sacrifice on one mountain not just any mountain there was one provided place of worship amen because this is what Abraham was doing remember he said stay here while I and the sun go and worship there was a provided place of worship amen there were places but God had a place God had a place that Abraham he desired Abraham to worship Him in but Abraham didn't know that place God says here he says which I will tell thee off in other words I will reveal this place to you amen I I will I'm going to give you the opportunity to worship me in a place that I'm going to reveal to you amen God God is a is a he's a mighty God Amen this was God's desire for Abraham God's desire for Abraham was for Abraham to worship him in a particular place amen and it's God's desire for you to worship him in a particular place God wants you to come to full maturity in that place not a place of your liking not a place of your choosing not a place of the church's choosing or the pastor's choosing or mum's choosing or Dad's choosing about a place that he had chosen for you before the foundation of the world that's the place that he wants you to be and that's the place he wants you to worship and that's the place where your worship will come to full maturity in that place amen so that's God's desire for you amen it's my desire for you too but it's God's desire for you I can't get you there but he can amen he can so God it it God had promised to Abraham because we know when God speaks it's thus saith the Lord because the Lord is speaking we don't need to when the Lord speaks we don't need to judge whether it's thus saith the Lord or not it's just thus saith the Lord because it's the Lord speaking all right so when when God said to Abraham which I will tell thee of Abraham had thus saith the Lord amen Abraham had no reason to question is God going to keep his word or isn't he going to keep his word Abraham had already experienced that new purse Abraham had already experienced receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost in his life Abraham knew that if God promised he will he will bring it to pass amen and if God has promised us maturity maturity will come if God has promised that before we leave here that all the greenness will be baked out of us then brothers and sisters oh the greenness will be baked out of us amen if God has promised us a body change you don't need to question oh I don't know if it's going to happen or not no if this does say of the Lord amen you can put your life on it it's gonna happen because God said it amen God said it amen so we see here that that what was happening now is that God was beginning to reveal his mind to Abraham God was starting to reveal his thoughts concerning Abraham to Abraham and this is why worship and the opening of the word are connected together as the opening of the word as the word opens you are then able to worship at a higher level amen as the the word progressively opens to us uh the word's still opening to me that the book is open but the book is still being opened to me the contents of the open book are still being revealed to me if if they're not what are you coming to church for if you're not you should be a pastor but we understand even the the to the Ministers of this gospel the word is opening and it opens progressively amen because God just doesn't whoosh open his open the word and we we he gives us character to handle the opening of the word amen because without the character we can't handle the power that comes with the opening of the word so when when when we come to a certain level of of character God opens the word to that level and then when he takes us through another trial and our character Rises and the word rise he opens the word another level you know when I was 10 but no way no way my dad would give me the car keys not to his car at least we had a farm car but not to his car amen but when I reached the level of maturity then then he he gave me the the keys to his car and allowed me to drive his car and God does the same thing he waits until we reach a level of maturity we get a level of character in our lives and then he opens the word a little bit more amen so we thank God for who he is in our lives this is God's desire for you this is God's desire for me God and God is revealing his mind to Abraham God is revealing his mind concerning you amen and with the opening of the word comes a higher level of worship amen as the word opens if the word is open to this level you can worship to that level God opens the word up higher it allows you to worship at a higher level God opens the word you rise up again God opens the word you rise up again that's why it's Progressive worship because it's a progressive revealing of God's word and my desire is to worship Him fully but what that's going to take is for the word to be fully open amen and that's where we're at now is the word is opening to us that's why there's there there's a people on Earth who can worship him like no others and I know that's an offense to some but that's just the truth because the word is open to some and it's not open to others I meant the word become open to Noah when God said Noah I need a boat build and I built what what got what God allowed Noah to do was to worship Him otherwise Noah would have continued planting his vegetables all right but God allowed Noah to enter into a worship through the opening of the word concerning Noah amen and there is an opening of the word concerning you as an individual there's a there's must be an opening of the word to you and that opening of the word allows you to worship him in the office that he has placed you in amen Noah was in office Moses was in office David was in an office when David put the Ark on a new cart where the Branham said God rejected the whole thing why because it wasn't according to the words so God rejected the worship because the worship wasn't according to the word so God had to bring David back to the word he had to restore David back to the word so then God could accept his worship because now he was doing according to the word amen so worship is worship is is an expression of the word and that worship is the word expressed when when when Noah built the ark it had one window if it had two it wasn't worship but God accepted the ark because it was built according to the word and God accepted Noah because it was he he worshiped God according to the word amen so our worship is not just something well I I I want to worship God we all want to worship God but God provides a way to worship and God provides a place of worship amen I like that so much God provides a way to worship and God provides a place of worship amen a Villain at home now amen praise the Lord so we see here that that God was going to reveal to Abraham where this place was he hadn't done it yet which I will tell thee of right he hadn't done it but Abraham had to walk by faith he told him a general direction the land of Moriah all right I was preaching this series at home and I never preached the same service twice uh in in the respect that because once you preach it once it opens up more so how can you go back to your previous note you've got to write it all again that I was preaching it over and over and over and and um my my son and daughter-in-law they um she was expecting and that chosen this name Mariah every time I'd preach it they come out say you said that name again I just couldn't put the two together you know they wouldn't tell me what it was and uh when she was born 12 weeks ago uh little little baby girl well that's her name Mariah you said it like 200 times in five weeks yeah foreign amen verse 3 and Abraham rose up early Abraham didn't hesitate amen he knew if God if God said something it's best just to rise up early and do it don't procrastinate about it just rise up early in the morning and did it and he saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and and Isaac his son Enclave the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him so we see here that that somewhere along the line here God had revealed to Abraham where this place was all right so we see in verse 2 abrah God was going to tell Abraham we see in verse 3 he went to the place of which God had told him amen so so Abraham was walking in a confidence that came from the thoughts of God revealed he wasn't walking in the confidence of himself he was walking in the conf he had the confidence of God wow the same confidence that God had God had when he said let there be [Music] it's the same confidence now that Abraham had in God's word you know God had faith in his own word amen and now Abraham was walking according to God's word he had the same confidence Abraham had the same confidence in God's word that God has in his own word wow that's that's pretty big that's but that's why God wants us to come to that's God's desire for you is to have complete Trust in his word amen complete trust you may not know all of it but what you do know walk in it amen place your confidence in what you know amen and as you walk with that confidence in what you know God will continually progressively unveil more and more of his plan for you amen Satan likes to tie us in knots sometimes and well you know you don't know very much it don't matter how much you know amen it's your desire to know everything amen but your your focus is what you know now amen and what you know now there's enough power in what you know now to defeat every demon that is trying to prevent you to walk in God's way right now amen that's why Abraham woke up early amen because he got an early start he knew that the devil would be there to tempt him we know that this was a three-day Journey we know that the the prophet of God said those three days is that three days of Temptation the devil come to him the devil come to him the devil come to him what are you doing what are you doing you know what why is why are you doing uh why are you sacrificing your son your only son all Abraham could say was because God told me to amen he didn't have a great explanation he didn't have a formula he didn't have a theological understanding he just said because God said so and if this is what God wants me to do then that's what I'm doing no matter what the circumstances I'm going to worship God amen sometimes we need this same attitude when we're coming to church a man who goes when we come to church we come to worship him and then by coming to church we are worshiping him but we often wonder why we have such a battle on Sunday morning yeah if you're gonna sleep in at any time it's Sunday morning right that's the morning that you feel the sleepiest it just is when I go to church I go to over a bridge water under the bridge ocean under the bridge you know the best day to fish Sunday morning Sunday afternoon the wind's up Sunday morning is the best day to fish why because Satan don't want you to make it there amen and Satan didn't want Abraham to make it there but when you have that confidence in God's word nothing can stop you nothing at all can stop you your God God requires more from us God requires us God requires a greater level I'll say that again God desires a greater level of worship than us sitting at home and streaming I'm not talking covert I'm talking those who choose to sit at home and Street stream God desires a greater level of worship from you than you sitting at home it's the truth it's because because of who you are God desires it God it's God's desire for you amen and and yeah I I know churches are a hard place there's all types of prickly people in church yeah most of them think I'm the prickliest the past is always the prickliest but you know that's God's order this is what God desires for us so Abraham was going to worship God had a provided place for him and God desired Abraham to be in that place amen God had provided the place of worship but it wasn't revealed the place was there but it wasn't revealed huh so what God was going to do was to reveal a place of worship that existed the revelation of it was not going to bring it into existence but it already existed amen and he what he was going to reveal who existed right he was going to reveal this mountain that existed there were mountains but there was a mountain that God wanted Abraham to come to and that mountain existed amen God has a provided place of worship amen that's a that's a beautiful message God has a provided place of worship it's here it exists amen but it's going to become a revelation to it's got to be something that God opens up to you amen oh yes but then I'll be over in Australia next week that's God's provided place of worship no it ain't don't bother stay here don't waste your money you'll lose your luggage and everything just just stay here until you receive a revelation of that place because you're going to find that place is closer then you think it is and it's not a geographical location amen amen God's provided place Ephesians oh sorry I didn't have this one on slide Ephesians 3 9 says to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ amen God has a provided place of worship amen amen all of these events all of these things all this journey that Abraham was on was going to happen by the opening of the word for Abraham's day it wouldn't happen if if Abraham took Noah's message or Moses message this was God revealing the word for his day this was God making things possible in Abraham's Life by the revealing of the word for his day it was God that was going to reveal this place it was the word of God that revealed the place it was the word of God that allowed Abraham to see the place it was the word of God that allowed Abraham to Worship in that place amen so we can't hold any credit to ourself amen it's all God amen we we're fellowshiping this morning and we we we're all going to have the same conclude the same testimony of how we got to that wedding supper and we'll all point to the same individual and as we'll say it's because he made it possible it's it's nothing that I did it's nothing that anyone did it's something that he did he made it possible amen and he's still making it possible amen we see here then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place are far off and Abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you so we see here that progressively as Abraham walked by faith God's thoughts concerning him will become revealed all right so now Abraham he went from being told there was a place to being told where that place was to now in verse 4 he was able to see that place so it was obvious here that the only way that he could see God's provided place of worship was if God had revealed the particular place the mountain amongst the mountains where God desired for Abraham to worship Him amen so what who who made this possible God made this possible amen God made it possible for Abraham now to see it so what we understand now is that once upon a time the thoughts of God were revealed to Abraham and now those thoughts of God were the thoughts of Abraham right so Abraham had taken on the mind of God all right so the thoughts of God were now the thoughts of Abraham but now God was looking at that place but so God could see that place but Abraham couldn't see it but now here in verse 4 now Abraham could see what God saw amen so it went from being having a mind of God to to now seeing what God saw amen Abraham could see Abraham had the vision of God concerning him he still wasn't in that place but he could see that place amen he could see the place in material form amen remembering that these this world was created it was once a thought that became word that became manifested amen so now what Abraham was looking at was the manifested thoughts of God amen he was looking at the spoken word of God he was looking at a mountain amongst the mountains and looking at it as the manifested word of God saying that is God's provided place of worship that is the place that God has revealed that he wants me to worship him in amen and and that's it's such a beautiful thing the the mystery had been revealed Abraham was now fellowshipping with the mystery amen he was looking at the mystery and he was fellowshipping with the mystery amen Abraham didn't look at God didn't point it I don't know how God revealed it but let's just say God didn't point it out to Abraham and then Abraham turned away and then Abraham turned back and say now which one was it hey Isaac can you remember if it's a rebel it's it was a revelation to him amen it was a revelation to him he testifies of it here in verse five you stay here while I in the lad go Yonder in worship and we will return unto you he knew where he was going he knew he knew God's provided place of worship it had been revealed to him amen the mysteries of God had been revealed all right he was now fellowshipping with the mystery beautiful God's desire for you God's desire for Abraham God's desire for you as an individual is the fellowship with the mystery amen it's a it's a revealed place it's a place that God reveals to you it's a secret place it don't matter if we're getting confidence by numbers there's something wrong with that experience because Abraham was alone amen Abraham was alone if if the bigger the church the more confident we become I question your experience because you should be able to stand alone if you're the only one if you're the only David I mean you should be able to stand alone if it's revealed to you if it's a revelation to you don't you don't need a group mentality amen you don't you don't you don't get confidence because there's one brother standing beside you amen because that's all you need to be a denomination is two people you don't need a group you just need two people all right so you've you've got to be able to stand alone and Abraham's stood alone and he looked at that mountain he said that's God's provided place for me that's where God is directing me to that's where he wants me to go for you man that's the place where all things are possible that's the place where the impossible is impossible God's elect this is his desire for you this is his desire for me he he desires you to come to full maturity he desires me to come to full maturity amen and I thank him for it because without him having that desire I can't reach it and part of the part of coming to maturity is receiving the revelation of the mystery Christ is the mystery of God revealed a part of the Fulfillment of of God's desire for your life is the revealing of the mystery amen it's so so beautiful it's so personal it's such a personal love story you you you you speak to people we've heard a couple of testimonies since we've been here and our our walks are personal and it's meant to be that's how God wants it that's how he desires it amen amen in that place all things are possible Abraham knew this based upon verse 5 because he said I and the lad will return the very lad that God said I want you to offer him as a sacrifice Abraham said we will return and you don't think the devil was on his shoulder saying but God said you're going to have to sacrifice him right Satan will try and run you down right up into the end the prophet of God said he says Satan hates Revelation but we love it amen but whenever Revelation comes you can expect there to be a challenge and he'll fight that right to the end right to the end and this is why also the opening of the word overcoming and worship are connected because we worship by overcoming and we overcome by the opening of the word amen so you'd think Abraham had some things to overcome oh sure he did the biggest thing he had to overcome was himself amen this is the biggest thing he had to come let me ask you a question what was the greater Abraham receiving the promised son or now Abraham's obedience to God to go and offer that promised son at us as a sacrifice that's a tough place to be that's a tough place to be but it expresses the the relationship that God had with Abraham because we're all going to come to this place we're all going to come to a place where God asks us to do things that are hard to understand why he's asking us to do it but he he only does that when we reach a level of maturity where we can handle the challenge amen so God is God is not out of order God knows what he's doing amen and I thank him for that because sometimes I think I do but I find out that I don't but God never has that problem he doesn't think he had things in order and find out that he doesn't he he has everything in order so God brings us to a place where we can handle the trials that he allows to come in our life no matter where you are now if you are facing a trial the only reason that you are facing that trial is that because God believes in you you think God believed in Abraham of course he believed in Abraham God believes in you amen God a king hazarus Esther's King Esther's husband believed in her he believed in her he believed that she would do what was necessary to meet the challenge of her day and I want to tell you something God believes in you amen Satan wants you not to believe in yourself but guess what you're not meant to believe in yourself you're meant to believe in God's word so take his advice and don't believe in him but believe in God's word see he believes in me and that's who I believe I believe in him amen let's not trip ourselves up look by looking at our own flesh because our own flesh is the very thing that we must overcome we don't have confidence in self no sir we don't have confidence in this body no no we have confidence in the one who gave us this body but we don't have confidence in this body whatsoever amen this body cannot change itself it's got to be changed amen are you ready for the Rapture yeah have you started changing your body how could Abraham be turned back to a young man again how could Sarah be turned back to a young woman Again by yourself by themselves it's impossible it's absolutely impossible it's it takes the the hand of the Lord in our lives Amen to make the changes in our life that need to be need to be changed for us to reach our destination this is why it's a message of Grace and people want to make it a law I'm sorry you don't have the same revelation of the same thing that I have you've got a different revelation of what of what I that than what God has given me amen but we can't even have the revelation of what we have unless he gave it to us amen says oh God your education don't help your your ability to to speak in excellence doesn't help thank God for that but it's him who helps and that my Help Cometh From The Lord amen amen and we thank him for his faithfulness to us amen I thank him for his faithfulness so Abraham knew this was the place that God has put his name Abraham knew that this was the place that God had chosen for him to worship Abraham knew that this was the place that that he was going to do the impossible Abraham knew that that if if Abraham knew that God had the ability to provide himself a sacrifice but all along Abraham went all the way with the Lord so we see here that Abraham saw that place this is interesting because this is not where it stopped because when he saw it he wasn't there he was at the foot of it but he hadn't entered into it all right so we can't stop just because it's we see it we've got to go all the way all right because Abraham was fellowshipping with that mystery but what God wanted for Abraham was to have a higher level of Fellowship God didn't want Abraham to fellowship with the mystery from a distance God's desire for Abraham like his desire for you is for you to become one with the mystery amen and this is why Abraham says here in um uh sorry I've jumped ahead of myself no I haven't and they came to the place which God had told him of so now he came to that place he entered into that place now his his even though he was fellowshipping with the mystery now he was fellowshipping at a higher level all right before you married your wife you would fellowship with her but when you married your wife you you entered into a higher level of Fellowship right but but even through marriage your fellowship is growing so some people think that that um when you get married you don't have trials people who think that aren't married never read a book about marriage that uh from a person who hasn't been married never read a book from about raising children if they haven't raised children but in Fellowship through trials our fellowship increases amen through trials our fellowship increases we grow together go go closer together God's desire here was was now for Abraham to enter into that place and Abraham came to that place that God had told him of so now Abraham and the and the Mystery become one now Abraham could flip off his sandals and dig his feet into the mystery and say this is God's provided place for me this is God's provided place of Fellowship for me this is where God is going to this is the place that God's going to work through me Abraham could get bend over and pick up the soil from the from the ground and run it through his hands and say this is the mystery this is I'm fellowshipping with the mystery at a great level amen so God desires you to be one with the mystery but God desires you to be totally one with the mystery amen God desires a complete Oneness between you and the Mystery amen so to to today so I must have skipped the slide here let me just see what this next one is and Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father and said my father he said here I am my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt offering and Abraham sounded and Abraham said my son God will provide for him himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together amen so it's interesting today where are we standing as as the Bride of Jesus Jesus Christ where are we particular time because it's important for us to understand as it was for Abraham to understand where he was standing because in that place all things are possible in that place all things are possible because in that place you are no longer the preeminent one but God is the preeminent one and to him there's nothing that is not impossible all things are possible to him amen so where are we as the Bride of Jesus Christ been baptized into him by that one Spirit into the body of Christ this is where he has placed his name in his body he has placed his name in his body who is his bride in in there all things are possible amen where are we standing where where are we at where where the the things that weren't possible Once Upon A Time are now possible amen the things that that weren't possible for me as a husband are now possible the things that weren't possible for me as a father are now possible amen because God Has Lifted me to a higher level of fellowship with himself enabling me to be who I am ordained to be as a husband as a pastor as a father etc etc I cannot be who I am ordained to be as a husband without the opening of the word I cannot it's impossible it's impossible for me to be who I am ordained to be as a pastor without the opening of the word and it's impossible just like the same here it was impossible for Abraham to come to full maturity without the opening of the word First Kings 17 the woman who was who was who was dying because of the the drought that was upon the Earth and God sent Elijah to that woman a woman who had he had commanded to sustain him that that woman was dying the same curse that the rest of the world was all right if God had not have intervened she would have died the same way that her neighbor died and meant the curse that was upon you even though she was elect even though she was chosen without the opening of the word she was going to die the same curse amen she could not be the mother she was ordained to be to her son without the opening of the word but the opening of the word allowed her to be the mother that she was ordained to be now that woman that she didn't like woman she represents the body of Christ she represents fathers mothers wives husbands pastors grandparents Etc Sons daughters whatever office you hold that is who she represents as the body of Christ but the body of Christ cannot be who she is ordained to be without the opening of the word so the opening of the word enables me it makes it possible for me to be the husband that I'm ordained to be to my wife in it enables me to be the father that I'm I'm ordained to be to my children it enables me to be the husband the pastor that I'm ordained to be to my to my church [Music] without it my family dies the same curse that the world dies wow wow she she was preparing herself for death she knew this amen well you know we should know it too because it makes it makes us very grateful for what God has given us amen God has given us life God has given us the the ability by the opening of the word to be who we are ordained to be for this day in which we live in amen she she fellowshipped with the mystery she she was not feeding on the word of Elijah she was feeding on the body word son of man as long as she was feeding from that word life was being restored I met she was getting ready for death she said we're gonna have this little morsel of bread and we're gonna die so by then her countenance had had become like a a starving woman a cheeks had begin to sunk in and sink in perhaps her son was in a better State than what she was because you know a mother's love is a sacrificial love you know they'll give to the children if there's not enough for everyone just to make that allow their children to get through and perhaps a child was in a better condition than what she was but she understood that that without the words she cannot be who she's ordained to be but that that word in which she received and she began to feed on it slowly progressively restored her strength so that through that restoration she could then be who she was ordained to be to her family amen and that's what God's word does for you as parents is it restores your ability to be able to be the parents that you are ordained to be to your children amen we we don't we don't need Google to tell us how to be parents amen sorry Google we don't we don't need YouTube for tutoring lessons of how to be a husband if we feed on the body word you find yourself becoming you'll find yourself progressively becoming the wife that you are ordained to be to your husband the the very wife that God desires you to be amen it's God's desire for you and meant to be who you are ordained to be in 2022. in the office that you hold officers that we hold God desires you in that office to come to full maturity in that office amen me as a husband God desires for me to be the the the the most godliest husband that was ever on earth that's his desire for me and that's his desire for you and it's same with my wife God's desire for my wife is for her to be the most Godly wife there is on Earth [Music] amen and it's my desire for me to be what he wants me to be [Music] God's provided a place of worship the prophet of God Says by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and that body is a family the family of God and that's the house of God and the house of God is the name of Jesus Christ the name of the Lord is a mighty tower the righteous run into it and are safe there are many fine women in this building tonight find women in this building tonight find loyal women but there's only one Mrs Branham William Branham she's the one goes home with me she's the one that's my wife there is a fine people in the world fine churches but there's only one Mrs Jesus Christ and that's who he's coming for that's where his name lies there is where his worship is in her and her alone amen that is true oh yes sir amen we understand that when after Abraham um Abraham went through the process of building the Altar and placing the the wood in a particular order and putting the fire under the warden Isaac was upon the the the the Altar and Abraham had had raised his hand to to go through with God's plan God knows when we're bluffing he knows when we're not serious all right because the angel of the Lord was standing right behind Abraham because God knew Abraham amen God knew Abraham so God knew that what Abraham got what God had asked Abraham to do he was going to go through it meant so so God had the angel of the Lord he was the angel of the Lord was standing right beside him amen because he knew that Abraham was going to go through it you know God God knows when we're bluffing he knows when we're not bluffing we don't know when we're bluffing but but we find out when we are bluffing but but God knows when we're serious about him amen and that's that's what we want to be but we understand that that God provided a lamb and and that's why Abraham called that place Jehovah Jireh God provided for himself a sacrifice so that was the place that God had put his name and this is the place that God had put his name in this place all things are possible in this place nothing is impossible be it unto you according to your faith Amen in this place nothing is impossible it may seem impossible but it's not impossible why because it's God's provided place and God's provided place of worship is in her and her alone there is no other place he has not placed his name in any other woman he has placed his name in his bride in his body and in that place all things are possible I've noticed here I've I've almost quit having discernment anymore just lay my hands on the sick I've been noticing when my things I've I never I didn't get to one third of the people otherwise this way I get to more than I ever did get to and I find out a better results by just getting myself into God's arms and saying Lord God you promised it it's your promise it's not mine it's yours and you promised you would do it and I've seen you do it and I'm going to believe you're going to do it because you've been baptized I've been baptized into your body and your spirit here to identify that that's the truth amen that's the place of worship then you get into a place all things are possible then you get into a place that your motives and your objectives for your achievements is just exactly in the will of God and when you lay your hands there and believe it it's going to happen do you believe that amen so he's he's drawing confidence here from the place that he is standing amen you'll notice right at the beginning there he says I'm I'm going to believe I'm going to believe you're going to do it because I've been baptized into your body so the place that he was gave him conf the confidence that he need needed to meet the challenge of his hour the place on the second day Abraham didn't have that confidence because he wasn't in that place but when he entered into that place there was a confidence that came as a result of entering into that place that now all things are possible huh it's like entering into it if you walk into the airplane but you're not on the airplane well you're not going to get to your destination until you're in the airplane but when you're in the airplane there's a there's a confidence that comes that now I'm in the place I'm in the place that I need to be in in order to get to my destination and and that's what being in the body of Christ is it's a place that God has provided for you to be in and you must have confidence in the place that he has placed you in and that is in the body of Christ in that place all things are possible in that place nothing is impossible all things are possible in that place amen and there there is a bride who is in that place now the the way that I am speaking is the way that I'm going to project this over the next couple of services is in our offices that God has placed Us in all things are possible amen as a father all things are possible nothing is impossible for me in that place I can be who I'm ordained to be in that place as a pastor as long as I'm in that place all things are possible in that place as a wife all things are possible in that place you have nothing to fear in that place it doesn't matter how Wicked This World gets you have nothing to fear in that place because in that place God will provide for himself sorry Hallelujah your children are not your children they're God's children that he gave to you in that place God will provide for himself God will provide for his own children the love and care that your children need the love and care that your wife needs the love and care that your husband needs all things are possible in that place amen we've got to recognize Where We Are amen we've got to take confidence from the place where we are amen we might be living in Satan's Eden but that's not my place of worship my place of worship is in that body of Christ and in Satan's Eden I will worship Him in Satan's Eden he will be worshiped through my office as husband amen but he cannot be worshiped as through me through my office as husband if I am being a husband my own way no it's not possible it's the same as it's not possible it's impossible for God to accept the ark um that Noah built if Noah had put another door or another window or made it a different measurement or just one plank higher than what it was meant to be God could not have accepted it amen and God can not accept my worship as husband if I'm doing it my way it's got to be God's provided way amen and when it's God's provided way he's worshiped and this is my desire to worship Him amen this is my desire I have not know I have no desire to worship myself if if I didn't have to look at you I wouldn't if because I don't want you to see me because I don't want you to think well this is a great preacher I'm not a great preacher God's the preacher I'm not a revealer of the word God's the revealer of the word amen let's not get tangled up in in big names and self-image and and insecurities etc etc all we're going to do is repeat what they did with the prophet we don't want that today amen we want people to see God and God alone and understand that it's God behind a veil it's God operating behind a veil it's God standing in your office it's God is a wife it's God is a father it's God is a son it's God as a daughter it's God is a grandmother a grandfather it's God as a pastor it's guarded the deacon amen that that's that's what we're here that's how he is worshiped amen it's not me it's him isn't that what the prophet struggled so hard for the people to see it's not me doing these things I was just there when he came along amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's not me who's doing these things I was just here when he come along amen amen this is my story amen this is my song God chooses people who it's it's not in their natural ability to be what God wants them to be yes sir he does I'm a testimony of that God chooses people that it's not their natural ability to speak to speak yeah he chose Moses right Moses made all types of excuses about his speech impediment but God said hey Moses who made the tongue uh and this is this is God's choice and God's choice as God has chosen his bride and she looks at herself and thinks why why why would why would he choose me to be his bride I mean I I have nothing Brethren talks about the ranches son and how he went looking for a wife and there's all these fine women on the Dance Floor Etc and he's sitting at the back standing out the back leaning against the fence and washed woman comes out she throws the dishwater over the fence and he didn't know she didn't know he was there then the prophet of God says she was holding the dish pan up like this and she she dropped it down because she was ashamed and she had no feet no shoes on her feet she tried to what what why why would you choose me and not these other fine ladies God God chooses who he wants to choose and and we're not the bride because of of any great qualification that we have or education or specification well just the bright because he chose us to be the bride I mean he chose you before the foundation of the world to fulfill the last part of his Earthly Ministry through yeah and and I I Can't Tell You Why I can't explain to you why you explain to me why God chose the uh the prophet with a seventh grade education to be the prophet to be the voice to the Lord to the church age oh you can't explain it there's no well it's because of this or because no it's just God chose him and that's as far as our understanding goes and if our understanding is in anything else then just put it aside because why look Abraham didn't plead with God and say God I don't know why you chose that mountain it's three days journey there's one just here or this one's prettier or this one's higher or this one's got a a bit of a unique rock on it you know why didn't you chose this one or why didn't you choose that one Abraham said Lord if that's the mountain you chose then that's the mountain I'm going to and we've got to come to the same conclusion if God chose me who am I to question who he chose I was going to accept his choice and say Lord if you chose me then praise God I accept your choice [Applause] [Music] I just don't know I'm so humble I just don't know if I can accept God's choice that's not humility there's not a humble bone in your body that's Pro that's false humility that's Pride you need to humble yourself to God's choice say Lord here I am Here I Am Lord if if I'm your choice then I'm your perfect choice somebody tell me why God chose Gideon of all the men he could have chosen why did God choose Sarah who was barren his choice and he proved his choice was right amen and God proved that the place that he had chosen Abraham to worship Him was right because in that place all things are possible amen and God is going to choose God is going to prove not that we need the proof but God will prove his bride to be the right choice amen he will prove that even though to the to the carnal mind she's insignificant she's this and that she's mixed up she's whatever whatever whatever God is going to prove that she is his perfect choice because how can God have an imperfect choice amen you've got to have a revelation of of who is speaking he chose you before the foundation of the world he chose you in him before the foundation of the world amen don't argue with God's choice just accept God's choice amen what did God do to Abraham he brought him to a position of full maturity in the office that God had placed him in I believe that that's exactly what God desires for each one of us God desires us to come to full maturity in the office that we hold I cannot be a successful father if I father to the level that my father passed fathered it's not going to work it's not going to work but God won't allow me to be that because he's opened the word the word has opened since then amen allowing me to become a better father than my father it's not that my father didn't live to his potential he did put the potential our potential is the opening of the word and he lived to the potential that the word that the word was open to and now we are the opening of the word is progressively continually unfolding to me I don't know where you are I can't really speak for you and honestly I'm not meant to speak for you I'm just meant to speak from my own experience about what the Lord is doing in my life and he's he's progressively opening the word to me amen that the seals are off the book the book is open the contents of the book are becoming a greater and greater Revelation to me every day that I live and I pray that God that that I am becoming a greater and greater husband and father I I want to be a better father today than what I was yesterday I want to be a better husband today than what I was yesterday amen and that that's that's that's my desire and it's something that God desires for me God desires a higher level of worship from from me than he did from my father higher level of worship amen God requires God desires for me to overcome me at a greater level than my father overcome himself when we overcome ourself we worship amen Abraham had to overcome himself with with every inch that he's hand raised he was overcoming overcoming because of that same knife that he was prepared to thrust through Isaac's chest could have Cut the Ropes loose but instead of dropping the knife he raised the knife he raised the noise with every inch that he raised that knife he was overcoming himself amen and the greatest thing that I need to overcome it's not covert it's me it's not the church it's me amen it's not anyone else's problems it's me amen and as I overcome myself I'm worshiping I'm worshiping amen so God God give us the grace God give us the the the the the things that we need to fully Express him in this hour amen I I believe that we're coming to a place where undeniably it's it's not God it's not God being uh sorry it's not me being a husband to my wife but it's God in Me and I believe the same for my wife well it's it's it's not her being a wife to me it's God in her expressing himself through her to me as wife as husband amen you love him amen God's desire for you God's desire for you is to in in to reach full maturity amen there's a lot of overcoming that we need to do but you're looking at what I need to overcome okay you're looking at what I need to overcome amen and I I need to look at what I need to overcome amen how how will we overcome will overcome by faith what's faith faith is a revelation a revelation of what a revelation of the word a revelation of the word for your day amen a revelation of the word for your day gives the you the ability to be who you are ordained to be on earth now amen God no longer manifesting himself through one man but God manifesting himself through a many-membered body amen amen what a privilege what an honor it is to live in this time this day in which we are living in and at very special time very special time in uh in in which we are living in we want to thank God for the opportunity to be living in this time amen amen let's stand to our feet lost the musicians to come amen

identified by the word amen but not just edified challenged amen when my brother was preaching I was thinking there must be a whole lot more of God to be revealed to me because I'm far from where I want to be amen there's I don't believe any of us feel like we've come to the level that we want to be in Christ come to that Perfection as a son or a daughter of God but I'm so thankful that there's more of Christ to be revealed amen there's more in this Revelation to open up to bring us to what he intended for us to be and if there's more to open then there's a greater potential you know what's so exciting about the age we live in is we don't have to wait for another age for a greater potential to come the seals have been taken off the book The Mystery of the book is unveiled the whole Revelation is open and available the potential for everything is here we don't have to wait for the next stage with the age after that it's here I say thank you God now open the potential to me let me climb higher in Revelation open my understanding that I will be more like you in every way oh what a what a privilege it is to live in this day I don't know that we even fully realize that we want more but there's more to be had and we don't have to wait for somebody else to come on the scene God sent the messenger for our day we don't have to wait for another dispensation this is the dispensation I say thank you God now take all that potential that you unlocked and unlock it inside of me so that I can be what you've ordained me to be oh praise God I thank him for his word it is it is our overcoming power in this day because with the word comes the spirit to perform the word amen to make it live may God bless you I feel like we've had a wonderful start to this weekend I'm excited anticipating what more the Lord has for us God bless you let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus for this day God we can truly from the depths of our heart be grateful Lord that you chose us before the foundation of the world and you weren't looking at Merit you weren't looking at performance you weren't looking at ability but you were looking something deeper Lauren and God we may not with natural eyes be able to see what you saw but with eyes of faith we believe that you made the right choice Lord because it's your choice and there's something in us that's crying back to you that wants to be connected with you in a greater way that wants to please you and wants to serve you and God is Not ourselves and our human birth but lord it's something you placed there before the foundation of the word and your word has come and waking up in this day God I'm so thankful Lord that you brought a word of light Lord that can bring this seed to full manifestation we can never do it ourselves we can never work harder or try harder we would just fail but you brought the light you brought the water you brought everything that's needed to bring the full life out of the seed that you ordained for this day help us Lord to stay in that light to stay under that water and Lord help us to grow into what you've called us to be but I thank
