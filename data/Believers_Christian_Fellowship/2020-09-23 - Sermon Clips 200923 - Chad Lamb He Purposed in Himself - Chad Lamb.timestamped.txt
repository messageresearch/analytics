[0:01] so abimelech is acting righteous
[0:03] that's why government and reformation is
[0:06] never going to produce a seed of god
[0:08] it is never going to produce a bride
[0:10] there's no reformation we're not
[0:11] reformers we're not trying to change
[0:13] people's lives
[0:14] by being kind and nice to them and
[0:16] encourage them and have a buddy system
[0:18] amen the only way to change their life
[0:19] is give them the word of god if they
[0:21] take the word of god
[0:22] the spirit of god will come and they
[0:24] will be changed
[0:25] [Music]
[0:27] man we're not here to counsel you along
[0:29] counsel your law counsel you alone
[0:31] that's human efforts and human efforts
[0:33] will fail
[0:33] we are here to take the word and put the
[0:35] word in the situation
[0:37] when you receive that word there's a
[0:39] life that comes at that word and it has
[0:41] the power of transformation
[0:44] and if there's a seed of god in there
[0:45] that can receive that word amen that's
[0:48] got a power of transformation
[0:50] already built into the seed i don't care
[0:52] how
[0:53] low down your flesh has been and i don't
[0:56] care how
[0:56] vile and what kind of vile acts that you
[0:59] have died
[0:59] i don't care how shameful and
[1:01] embarrassed amen your life has been
[1:03] the power of transformation is not in
[1:05] your mind the power of transformation is
[1:07] in
[1:08] that seed and all that seed needs is the
[1:11] light the spoken word of god
[1:13] to hit that seed and it'll come to life
[1:15] and the power to transform
[1:17] wrong thinking wrong actions wrong
[1:19] habits is already there
[1:22] it was put in you before the foundation
[1:24] of the world when your name was put in
[1:25] the lamb's book of life
[1:26] god was ensuring that his purpose would
[1:28] not be defeated
[1:30] when he put a portion of himself and
[1:32] attributed to you to come forth in this
[1:34] day
[1:34] he was guaranteeing that nothing would
[1:36] disrupt his plan
[1:42] why because before he allowed this earth
[1:45] to fall into chaos after genesis 1
[1:48] i don't know what happened but something
[1:50] happened and he allowed it to happen
[1:51] because he was foreshadowing what was
[1:53] going to happen to you
[1:56] and before the chaos broke out that
[1:58] would have an earth
[2:00] and judgment and chaos he made sure
[2:02] there was some good seeds that got down
[2:04] in that ground
[2:05] so nothing would defeat his purpose
[2:08] [Music]
[2:11] hey amen amen it's not you it's him
[2:15] get the whole idea of you out of the
[2:17] picture all this idea of i can't do it
[2:19] and i can't live enough and i've tried
[2:21] and failed
[2:22] forget it just surrender to the word and
[2:24] say god give me all of that word
[2:26] every bit that i can get and stay with
[2:29] the word friends
[2:31] i've seen so many people jump in and
[2:33] jump out jump in and jump out and jump
[2:35] in and jump out
[2:35] and say i just can't have victory i just
[2:37] can't stop failing you stick with the
[2:39] word
[2:40] don't leave it no matter what happens
[2:42] how discouraged you get
[2:43] how bad how much sin and backsliding you
[2:46] stay with that word
[2:47] until it changes your life because the
[2:50] seed of god will stay with that word
[2:52] they won't leave it they'll stick with
[2:54] it and the power of transformation will
[2:56] change that life
