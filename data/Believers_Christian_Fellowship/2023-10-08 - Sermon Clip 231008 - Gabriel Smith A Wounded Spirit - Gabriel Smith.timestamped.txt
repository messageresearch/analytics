[0:44] in such a way you know you think you

[0:50] past six seven years brother I was in
[0:53] some of the darkest places I've ever
[0:56] been I mean and and so I I know I know
[1:01] what it's like to sit in a message Pew
[1:04] and be
[1:09] miserable I know what it's like to hear
[1:12] the prophet and though you can hear him
[1:15] it's it's and though you you know it's
[1:17] true it's not ringing in your heart cuz
[1:21] there's a cloud of Darkness over you not

[1:31] sir well you thank God I know it's
[1:35] real but is it real for
[1:39] me I'm talking about Blackness I'm
[1:42] talking about Blackness where you think
[1:44] the only reason why I'm I'm up and going
[1:46] is because I I would see you ever you
[1:49] ever see a picture of of little
[1:51] birdies Little Birdies newborn babes and
[1:55] they got their mouths up ch ch ch
[1:57] ch you know how many years
[2:00] I had that imagery in my
[2:03] mind and and and the guys will be
[2:06] working they be like man you working
[2:07] overtime what are you doing and I tell
[2:08] them you know you ever see them little
[2:12] birdies with their mouths open ch ch he
[2:15] go they go yeah like they don't know
[2:18] where that food comes from all they know
[2:21] is they're
[2:23] hungry and they look at me kind of
[2:26] funny
[2:28] okay
[2:31] but that's what got me through I
[2:35] thought in my mind neither did Ne
[2:39] needless did I know it wasn't but the
[2:40] tender hand of Jehovah carrying me the
[2:43] whole time but what I'm telling you
[2:46] friends you may be in that position
[2:49] where it may not be Little Birdies but

[2:53] because my family and I'm this and I
[2:56] feel like this and that and nobody likes
[2:58] me nobody and you know what what's all
[3:00] you're doing building walls isolating
[3:03] yourself insulating yourself nobody
[3:07] understands well listen I promise you
