[0:00] have we really come to that time in this
[0:02] omega ministry where god continues to
[0:05] work and to fulfill his great desire and
[0:07] to fulfill those things that he left
[0:09] undone for his body to be fulfilled
[0:11] has he put us back in the position of
[0:13] the garden where we're calling ourselves
[0:15] to a conference
[0:17] and saying
[0:18] what cross did i pick up today
[0:21] how can i give him this preeminence how
[0:22] can he take his rest so that i can take
[0:25] mine
[0:26] you know when enoch took the rapture it
[0:28] wasn't like enoch did this all alone
[0:31] he was with somebody
[0:33] he was walking with the lord and he took
[0:34] a rapture you know when brother
[0:36] branham's body changed and he became a
[0:38] young man
[0:39] it wasn't because he was alone he was in
[0:41] the presence of the right person the
[0:44] presence of the right person asked him a
[0:46] question and said
[0:48] you want to walk with me
[0:50] he said lord be the greatest desire of
[0:51] my life
[0:53] right
[0:54] before then he had to make a decision
[0:57] and lord had to reveal to him you walk
[0:59] with too many
[1:01] if you're going to walk with me you walk
[1:02] alone from this point on
[1:04] and so much of us we just don't
[1:07] we know god calls us to those types i
[1:09] could totally i just talked to you like
[1:10] we're sitting at the table right is that
[1:11] okay
[1:12] and we know sometimes god calls us like
[1:14] that he whispers something to us he says
[1:17] hey
[1:18] if you're gonna walk with me you gotta
[1:19] give that up
[1:20] you're gonna walk with me you can't keep
[1:22] doing that
[1:23] if you're gonna walk with me
[1:25] you have to separate why do you think
[1:27] moses god had to take or moses had to
[1:30] take the tabernacle outside of the camp
[1:32] to meet with god there comes a point in
[1:34] time where it's you and you only
[1:37] and it's him and him only and that is
[1:39] your place of rest that is his greatest
[1:42] desire and i think that's the rapture
[1:46] i believe that that's the rapture a
[1:48] place of rest a hiding place in him
[1:53] you know what i mean
[1:54] we are in rapture cycle i get it i know
[1:57] to wit the change in the body is the
[1:59] fullness of redemption but i'm looking
[2:02] at this rest and i'm realizing the
[2:04] earnest
[2:05] of my redemption was the holy spirit and
[2:08] the holy spirit guidance is leading me
[2:10] back behind the veil where the curtain
[2:13] can be shut
[2:14] and i'm with him alone
[2:17] then let the world do whatever it's
[2:19] going to do
[2:20] let it blow up let russia drop bombs and
[2:23] let the economies of the world collapse
[2:25] what do i care i've been shut in
[2:28] i'm shut in i'm closed in and it's just
[2:31] joy bells ringing for me
[2:34] because i know the one i put my
[2:36] confidence in he's promised i'll never
[2:38] leave you and i'll never forsake you
[2:39] i'll lead you i'll guide you don't you
[2:41] ever worry what do i have to worry about
[2:43] i'm in the palm of his hand
