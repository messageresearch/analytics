TRANSCRIPT
========================================
sing hallelujah to the lord [Music] see [Music] oh first [Music] just myself [Music] comes let's just sing it again lift up our hands is let's sing it again [Music] [Music] me is amen praise god it's a privilege once again to be with you um to pray to speak to the bride of christ this what an honor so we're going to pull right yeah it's good to be back in the house of the lord everything looks really what is supposed to be basically god show me that butterchat will ask me to preach i didn't tell him and like unexpectedly and i share that with my family where are my children anyway okay our church is the side all right um i enoch remembered that i told him i described even the place i was in a place a circular like a circle and they asked me to preach and how i had hard time with my notes and everything looks like yeah i asked brother franco to wait a little bit uh pulling uh you know come get my notes so it's all just working perfectly [Laughter] the lord does things like that just to encourage you he knows you know under what circumstances things are happening what's going on in your life and you want to let you know that is here no matter how small the message seems to be he's here so i just let pull and let's see what the lord won't uh have in his mind for us my wife's sister josie could not make it she has not fitting well all this week but nothing major so just keep her in prayer okay let's bow ahead for word of prayer heavenly father what a privilege what an honor to be part of the body of christ to share what you are put on in our heart if you have decided to do so then you have something for someone for your children so once again we pray that you put us aside and just use us mightily with what you have in store for us for this day we commit everything to you in jesus christ's name amen thank you musicians we're going to go straight with the word genesis 37 by the franco if you can pull it thank you genesis 37 5 as i was saying that god does not have to supernaturally tell you that you have to preach it doesn't have to do everything in with a supernatural sign it got just to be the word you're a preacher you're ready to preach right yeah i want to make sure that sometimes we have the wrong we can get the wrong impression that everything has to be uh supernatural signs no uh god as i say god does this for a purpose just to give us some courage god does not do anything for the show [Music] it's uh for a purpose and uh we thank him for that so we're reading uh genesis 37 5 and joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his brethren and they hated him yet the more and he said unto them here i pray you this dream which i have dreamed for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my shift aroused arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves stood round about and made of obeisance to my ship and his brethren say to him shall thou indeed reign over us and shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for this dream and for his words and he dreamed yet another dream and told it his brethren and say behold i have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made of obeisance to me and he told it to his father and to his brethren and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou has dreamed shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth and his brethren envied him but his father observe the same amen may god bless the reading of the word you may take your seats are we ready for the word now um i want to talk i want to continue what i started before this old corona virus hit i was talking about what was in the silence but god keeps changing it so you cannot be really ready with the message you're preaching until that day arrive you can change it many many times until that they arrive and people start praying about the service and as they start praying and god starts changing things so um that's why i will title it not what is in silence but i'm going to talk about the three element that you follow but abram talks about that uh here i wrote that follow you is all the same there are three elements that brother benham talks about that follow you and uh that's what we want to talk again full disclaimer i am exploring this if another preacher comes he may look at it in different angle but it's i pray that to be an edifying and he stays with the world now this is when barabanam talks about it in the message the ark you say now there's three elements that people live in not just follow you or you follow them but you live in first is the humanistic second is divine revelation and third is vision now this like in prayer when you pray for anyone in humanistic we say well i hope you get well i'm hoping i'm believing with you trying to use all the faith i can that's human now second is divine revelation when something is revealed to you you just know in your heart it's going to happen yet with nothing but just the revelation and third is a vision of course that's that saves the lord that's perfectly positive now it entered up into this rim here and something just said to me you're going to have a boy and you will call his name joseph so you know the story brother branham was um reading about the story of joseph just like we read and he started praying in his closet and and telling god how he appreciate that he had we had a man like joseph a man like us how could such a man exist and he cried to look into his life and he says something say to him that you're going to have joseph you say it was not the audible voice but it was internal voice it was something of the faith realm is it not it was not a vision it was not the audible voice but it was just something that tells you you're going to have a child a boy and you're going to give him the name of joseph so the prophet is trying is showing us that there are three elements first you see him you know reading his bible and praying then enjoying the life of joseph maybe saying just for the drama that oh if i had a boy i'll give him a name the name of joseph and then a voice say to him not a voice something down there say that you're going to have joseph and he hold on to that promise and then one day the promise was fulfilled and one day the promise was fulfilling they say that uh it started in a human level where you just thinking about something desire something hope for something and then god takes your hope and your hopes your desire according to god's words and god says i'm going to give it to you and you hold into it you hold on it and god makes it happen and those are the three elements now the prophets say that they follow or you follow them or they dwell in you in other words all of us there is an element that we follow three elements we follow them from where so we must have followed them from where we come from [Music] so we can see it but when i'm talking about it here in melchizedek the great prince and king he said there's three elements that a man follows i'm pretty sure it is a believer fat the three there is a three element that a man follows first is humanistic second is divine revelation third is a vision it's thus safe the lord many times we are down in here we are in the human realm and never claim into this in the revelation if you you are not down in there cast your hopes through the veil up here to the safe the road though you don't see the vision though the vision doesn't come though when you pray for you say i i just wish i could believe that doesn't make any difference cause you ain't go down there call it so anyhow so basically saying that continue confessing it continue believing it until it you get from the human desire hopes and to a revelation amen and brother brahm says that okay so those are the three elements and you and i have them it doesn't say four element it's a tree okay now i say that for purpose because when uh on the human realm you know you have the desire the hope and then god uh anointed that desire or the hope into a revelation and in into a faith then come the vision where god said that saith the lord you're gonna get it and then you get it if i say it that way that will be four steps four element all right hope faith and then vision and the thing happen but he doesn't say that he say there are only three all right not four and he say that all of us have them but i can tell you that some of us will never see a little vision is that right no one not everyone will see it but yet the prophet says that we all have this and it follows us that's why it needs us to explore it all right it's uh we have the right to explore every portion of the world that god gave us that's why i'm taking the courage this morning to explore it it's there amen why do you go to high mountain hiking because the mountains are there good answer not everyone sees visions so we have the right to explore don't we have the right to explore the land the land has been given to us it's a promised land is the promised word of god is given to us can we go explore or are we going to be afraid at all of their giants in the land so we gotta go and explore by god's grace we can see something you remember brother branham prophecy that was given in french you know when god wants to compliment his prophet you know i love english you know but god spoke in french i'm just saying that's what he did brother you're bragging but god is god of diversity you know god understands all the languages it goes beyond languages he can uh he can even listen to what we did not say did not the the angel told brother abraham the very first thing that the angel told what branham said was go tell men their thoughts are speaking louder than what they're saying is that right yes but god was good he just decided to put it in french so we know god knows french he knows all the language he knows our pain he knows when we try to pray we cannot even pray he understands he goes he he knows the past the present the future you are in a good hands you have somebody to talk to amen you can stay assured that he cares the problem the prophet says is do we care that's the problem so this is what he said because of this momentous decision that you made william branham you were not forced to do it but you made this decision he said a huge portion of heaven awaits thee now but i'm saying that uh heaven now in paradox he said now that's what i wondered when i die will it be then i happen to think heaven is not portioned off uh different to different portions to us up there heaven is the kingdom of heaven that's within us one with us why do i say that you're gonna see i'm talking about exploring right now okay but i'm saying the heaven is not like portions small portions here and there then he in christ the mystery of god revealed then he say then our headship is a kingdom the kingdom of god is within you what is what is heaven the kingdom of god is within you say the bible jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of god made spirit and life in our own life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in the day when the world and god was one and the word and god is one in his church today there you are so i was i want to say that i want to take that french prophecy to show you that we have the right to explore because god said to the prophet he has a huge portion and we it turns out that huge portion is the word made manifest and we can go and explore it and keep exploring it and that's to remind me one thing that i uh read uh in the message uh no it it not where um brother jr jackson had a dream or a vision in that vision he sees brother branham as a soldier with a great authority like a ranger and he sees brother branham and barabam calls him three times and brother branham had a big horse a real pube breed of horse and he mount on it and he took reins and went to heaven and then a smaller a smaller let's read it in know it it not and he say just a minute i look around and here come a horse smaller than that one and the same breed but smaller and students say i walked around and say he must have sent this back for me so this is what a junior jackson is saying that brother brennan must have sent this smaller same breed of horse for him [Applause] he uh he must have sent it or say i got it in a junior has done a little writing too so it takes that horse in does a little writing in heaven he say you know how you uh your saddle fits you brother branham the stirrups and everything say i thought well this fits me just right so i pull up on the reins of through the skies and say i pull on the reins and stopped him turn him around and went back see i went back and say i stopped the horse got off talked to the wife the horse was gone i don't know who what a genie jackson represent in that dream but uh if i was in that dream i wish that he did not stop and get out of the horse but continue to explore heaven because that horse was not just a horse that walks around but he has to go to heaven a huge portion has been given to us to explore and i don't see how again i don't know it was a vision or a dream whoa rep brother daniel jackson represents but i don't want to be that person where i'm giving this horse to go and explore and see the marvelous things of god and i just go a little bit a little ride then i come back and then i go talk to the system oh i go talk to the wife the church do i have the time to go doing that when the prophet told me follow me come and explore with me it's a huge portion that's waiting for us to explore oh this gives us a courage to keep going to explore all those things we know we will not we will not go outside of the framework of the world as we are exploring we know where our bolts are all our nuts are we know where we stand amen we we can we we still in the we we have our boundaries our boundaries are the message of the hour we will stay there and when you look at what we say somewhere down there is still the word but i'm saying when it's if it comes from the lord it must be the word or the continuation of the same word amen i want to stay there so i take all this to just a show that is good when we see something maybe the lord put it in our heart we need to explore it we have to have this liberty and that's what this church allows us because we have that liberty and the people are mature enough to follow to understand why we disclaim what we disclaim but we gotta still go into it because there's some blessing just to know it may be just a little something but it can't help i don't wanna leave my horse down there and go talk this is not the time of churchianity this is not a time of the system this is the time to explore and i want to explore by god grace oh my i see something that i put here let me just talk a little bit about this brother branham never seen a vision for joseph so that's why i'm taking this brother but i've never seen a vision about joseph so that's why this is for every christian these three elements are for every christian and the way buddha banham got it was not like okay he's a is a a prophet he was in human realm desire praising god for what he a man he made was joseph right then receiving the revelation then receiving the vision no brother branham never received a vision when it comes to joseph then is teaching us about the three elements so what happened to him was you know the story is when he received it and when the time came for joseph to be born god did not even tell him uh god did not give him a vision he just told him go to back to your book go back to your work that was it there was no vision so that's why we need to understand this one this vision i'm not teaching but just something that i saw and i want to share jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever as i said there's three elements that people dwell in the first one is humanistic we down here we say well i will pray for that person i'm hoping that now they'll get well now next is divine revelation that's when something down in your heart anchors it and say it's going to happen then something is going to happen then the third element is a vision or the word of the lord made manifest when you see that it's thus saith the lord now can we have we noticed something the way but abanam defined the vision in this uh example is the word of the lord manifested that's the vision therefore everyone can have it you don't have to be a prophet to have it so there are really three elements that follows you that you follow yes you have a play a part to play in the humanistic level you receive the divine revelation about who christ is then what happened is the word that you have received is manifested have you are you with me so is if his vision is the vision that god had about you and that's why i look at this i say it applies everywhere you were born you were like you were born you were a woman then you become a mad a mother a mother as a mother you gave birth to children that's what you did in a humanistic use the word humanistic you understand human realm you raise children that's why you doing in your human realm then god revealed to you the word you believe it and then comes the vision you live the word of god that has been revealed to you it becomes manifest because that's what the vision it does because today if the pro a prophet tells you that uh by 4 by 4 45 you're going to receive 20 it's over is that right so if we say you're going to receive 20 by 5 o'clock it's over you have it you can already go on the internet and order a pizza because it's over so you don't have to wait it's there because when the prophet says something you can and he said that says the lord you can go take it to the bank there are vision is not another step but it is that word made flesh okay so if if the vision is that word mad flesh that is not another step with so vision is the supernatural things be blending with the natural if god called you and giving the revelation you are a child of god then one time the the uh the supernatural one time what god it was had in his mind will be manifested openly you start to manifest christ in your life amen so as you can see now whatever is saying that we read it then something is going to happen the third element is the vision or the word of the lord made a manifesto manifest what this tells us is this that you you did not come here let me just put it you did not come here by luck you no one can take your place you have a role to play in this world this gives you security give give you assurance that you have a role because these three elements are following you in this life you cannot even die before fulfilling this in your life they are wrong to play they are something that god has in his mind for you you can't and no one else is qualified explain to us well let me tell you that brother branham made sometime a mistake of going to a place when god gave him a vision and he goes there he starts praying for the child without that old woman to be present is that right to be present in the room and having a glass and cleaning up her glass she was very important in the vision without her the vision will not take place without you playing your role your part the word of god cannot take place or what god had in his mind he waits for you to be in position he wait for the bride to be in position before anything can take place i'm just going ahead the way even though i have a power presentation that's the problem with power presentation so you go uh you see it had to be william branham he had to be born the way he was born before revealing the seals it has to be in west it has to be in the sunset mountain it has to be that day otherwise it won't take place therefore you playing part this morning even this morning you had to be where you are now you have to be here for something to take place so without you god cannot do anything and sometimes we just delay what god had is in mine is that right what happened to that child was the child had polio the child was really dying they and the brother branham just god showed him that he's gonna pray for that child but he he went without looking at everything and when he picked up that child his situation became worse so guess what he did he just delayed he just delayed the healing but the healing took place anyway but he delayed it and sometimes we delay the plan of god because we are not in our position and without us without that woman who had to come and and sit down or start cleaning her glasses eyeglasses god could not do anything as soon as everyone was in place then the holy ghost came now how can the devil tell you that you are worthless that there's nothing good with you that i mean what do you have no you're playing a role this woman what did she do what did she do to help the prayer what did she do but without her nothing could happen so you are important in god's plan without you god is not complete we know that but since you are here the vision is fulfilled the supernatural what god had in his mind and the natural you are blending together amen and sometimes vision happens in phases right small pieces here small pieces there this person comes and sit over there this person comes and does this we sit on this chair and it comes like that it's what the supernatural is becoming little by little flesh pieces are falling into place amen oh what a wonderful lord we serve this supernatural the natural blends together that's what you are that's what we are ah the spiritual realm have become a flesh yes amen god help me keep us now as i was saying there was no literal vision on uh regarding but uh uh regarding brother branham um desire or um praying for how joseph and how great the man was there was no little vision and that explain as i was saying that explains that this vision is actually the word made flesh now i want to switch a little bit here and say when you you had hope in your human realm then god gives your hope a anchor and become divine revelation and then god said to you that something but it turned out between the time god revealed to you something and the time where it becomes flesh there is a silence it's always almost always like that god say something you believe it then there is a silence and it happened to brother branham god spoke to him a divine revelation and then there was a silence four years later a child is born i don't know how long it was that child is a girl what happened i believe you you say i'm gonna have a son but god did not say when there is a silence remember what we're saying the other day was like a silence does not mean there is no activity silent doesn't mean god is not present silent is just a silence is the time god gives to you to see where you stand it's a time that god maybe the devil has some rights and he goes to god and say you made things too easy for him so if i know you are a righteous god give me some time i want to do something and check this fate and that's why is there is always silence between the time where something is revealed to you and when he has to become flesh god help us to actually to know these things to receive the revelation of these things because they always happen it's uh some of us will spend years and years praying over something praying crying praying ears and ears out believing confessing but yet god seems to be silent and what do you do about it but abraham said be certain of god at that time because that's the it looks like a pattern because somebody laughed at butterburner and say did you mean josephine he said no no i said joseph and you will go through those things where people will mock will say all kind of things but that's the way it works right yes so after joseph promised there was a silence there was a silence for sarah and abraham so let's look a little bit about the silence of joseph after joseph told the story that we just read when he told his parents his siblings that it will this the vision about the shift the vision about the uh the moon the star and the 11 stars and the moon and the sun bowing to him after he told them that story there was a silence is that right and for the family of joseph where is joseph where is what he say what is he is it silence but silence is not a lack of activity there was a big activity that was taking place actually silence during that silence he was sold he went to egypt and he learned to know the living god and during the silence what happened is he get something major was taking place during the silence during the silence he get married to a uh a giant bride and so during the silence of the seventh seal during the silence of the seventh seal there is something major taking place a marriage is taking place between christ and the bride is the coming of christ in the bride so silence was good for joseph it was much better than joseph becoming the number two in egypt this was more important because something was taking place and marriage was taking place so therefore sometimes when we see there is a silence in our lives we don't understand what is going on that silence is good for us if we look closely god is doing something in that silence is that right genesis chapter 18. genesis 18 9 and they say unto him where is sarah thy wife and he say behold in the tent and he say i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now abram and sarah were old and wealth stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the man of women now we know the story we know what's taking place but i just want you to to notice there is a silence in the bible when god give this promise to abram and sarah that they're going to have a son and as i say silence doesn't mean lack of activity doesn't mean god forgot silence is just a silence god keeps silence as sometimes as a secret he has a secret that is happening something is happening and he takes a prophet to go where nothing is written and tell us what is not written and the prophet goes into it and say during the promise that abraham received between that time and when we see isaac something took place this is the promise i'm going to come to you abraham and sarah your wife will have a child then what silence so what what happened during that time no we just see uh sarah now has isaac it took the prophet to go into the silence and tell us that at that time after that visitation the body of sarah and abraham was transformed there was a body change amen so what was important i mean the body change during the time of silence is not what is happening this time that god is preparing his church for the body change but the body change is only through the revelation of what actually is the rapture amen i'm going to take a lot of few more examples i see the uh these three elements everywhere i look in your calling why do you do the job that you do well it's something in a humanistic level you know you know why do you live where you live why you come to the this church there is something predestinated it's very important that we realize that that uh you know so that we will not be going you know just doing things just the way we feel like we got to do them let me read something hopefully i wrote it down i told you about my notes right all right i think it's john 21. john 21 i think um let's go to verse 18. this is jesus speaking to peter he say this verily verily i say unto thee when thou wast yang thou gildeth thy seph and walketh o way there thou buddhas but when thou shalt be owed thou shalt stretch forth thy hand and another shall guilt thee and carry thee wither thou would not this speak his signifying by what death he should glorify god but i look at this it's not it's also showing that peter had a lot of liberty before i mean human liberty before the holy ghost comes it could go wherever you want ah it could go to anything you want but when he became old when you receive the holy ghost then every little step he need help any little step you want to know if what he's doing is right because we understand that every thing that we do you know we understand that god has called us to play a certain role therefore we need to make sure it's always him that even do a movie move from my house sell my house and going to a different house you got to be a leadership of god at least praying about it and say god guide me because we see that the vision in the vision you have to be where you supposed to be today we so much we say well i am an american i can go to any church i want to well you are more than an american you are a child of god you know you cannot say that you cannot say i just go because god has a predestined church where you have to be to be under certain ministry it's hard to sometimes people don't want to say this but it's true you know and everything has to be in place for the vision to happen but but yet we just decided ah i'm an american like this woman when brother brennan was preaching she said as an american we have the right to to to smoke cigarettes and wear shorts but i don't have that right no i gave to god my free moral agency i told him whatever you want me lord that's what i want to be so therefore he has to guide my steps because i have a role to play we saw that god plays role make people play role in history of humanity in history of the world we learn that acts the book of acts never close it keeps going and you are part of it if another book was written it'd be written with your name on it so but what role do you want to play because there are so many roles there's a period jones role but there is a judah role too what role you will play i want to be on the right side of the prophecy i want to be on the place that god as a place may is extremely important brothers and sisters therefore i need to be sincere and say to the lord am i at the place spiritually speaking am i at the place that you want me to be spiritual place spiritual position is my life worthy the gospel that i'm hearing day in day out am i where you want me to be or do i just go with the movement the age of christianity is over you see when people say i have the right maybe i have the right to go to any church i want but no brother no sister it's not like that you are not in love this year you have past love this year positionally you are not in laozi anymore you were in the bright age those games are over amen i'm playing a role i was reading sunday before sunday service when we were so blessed wednesday was whoa the anointing was coming from the screen to wow that was wonderful wow now when i was reading i i may have uh listened i was listening to the uh the spoken word is the original life of the original seed and then i was doing the yard and i was i before i listened to it i was like lord i don't want to listen to this message the way i used to why or like because i was not understanding it i was listening i didn't get it i want to hear it differently i want to get something and he did it he did it i was doing my yard work i had headsets and i'm listening to the spoken word suddenly things start clicking click clicking say wow that if somebody has questions about the the bride coming of christ give him this book this message it was not just a message it was a declaration well it was 1962 brother branham had to make a declaration it caused for a special meeting it tells people it's going to take time and if you listen to it he was making a big statement declaring to the world standing on 1962 and say right now all the seeds have been planted and god will honor the right seed god will the the the church that has the right seed will birth christ are you with me that's what happened 1963 you see christ being birthed that's it oh am i the only one i i need to fill the pool right anyway and when i look i gather my children around and my wife my children around and i i i just just telling them i say you cannot have the holy ghost without the right seed you can have the seed pentecostal seed you can have denominational seed whatever but you get to really have the holy ghost you have to have the right seed wow you know these things but for me was just mind blowing if i can say that have the holy ghost where you may have the holy ghost but on what that holy ghost sits is sitting what what message what world thank god for the pure word of god the fullness of the word that has been revealed to us in this time thank god that we've taken position for it no matter what boycott whatever in your life don't ma don't don't mind that it happens oh my oh o well god is so good and i come to church and i heal ah wow my goodness the uh oh my how the word with the chronology oh i used to tell people without really putting together like that i used to tell people that you know the seventh seal came before the first seal the second seal the third why did not not to put it together but that was wonderful you know because i say well the seventh seal no the first seal cannot be opened without christ coming first therefore the seventh seal came before the first the second the third the fourth and fifth the sixth hallelujah christ himself had to open that seal so what is this order that we learn who is god has a perfect order in this this disorder seemingly it is old but is a perfect order just like one time i had my desk with all kind of paper and everything there and maybe somebody asked me oh what is this i said there is a perfect order in this disorder yeah god does things like that that's how he hides the secret because every army has to have its secret it makes things scramble when when brah chad was talking about how how a preacher will have hard time to preach something god get to him very clear clean and it comes to his mind because he's a human being he has because to qualify to preach you have to be a human and you have to have flaws otherwise you not qualify now you take it you don't know how to say it and i was thinking all these computer people like jiraiya you understand like the scramble the data you know there are scramble so that nobody will pick up in that network you understand i'm all i have only one believer when they send me today it's in even the work we do look moses in a humanistic he was a liberator oh my uh you see my typo there he was a liberator but he was not divine he actually killed a uh an egyptians right he killed an egyptian in human love is that right but it was called when he received the revelation the pillar of fire then what was in his mind god has placed that desire to be the liberator of israel when he got the pillow fight then he went to liberate the children of israel with a stick on his hand amen what about david in the humanistic he was a shepherd boy then simon came and anointed him any in vision meaning in the in where the supernatural and the natural blind blinds in the time of manifestation what did he manifest a shepherd again for israel yes sister middle used to tell brother branham i don't have anything you know i don't have anything i don't have any vision i don't speak in tongues and oh you have a lot do you know in a human rim sister media was uh taking care of the children of the prophet right at maybe 12 years old she received the revelation she was one of the people that closed their eyes when barbara say close your eyes when the voice came from heaven when he was baptizing she closed her eyes and she heard the voice that say i sent you as john the baptist who was saying she heard it she got the revelation and then in to play a role when the uh the supernatural this supernatural becomes flesh what was she a prophet wife what was her role again taking care of the children of the prophet high on his shirts and stand between people and him people all want his time his time they took even advantage of it uh we have to be honest right yeah but she has to stand to protect him her hair become gray yet she's saying what do i have how many people feel the same way how many people feel like they are worthless there's nothing good going on for them and look at these people look at that one look at this family look at this one they do look how the blessed they are they have the pictures on facebook right but yet there is no small role and you must be there before something happens you are important play your role just make sure god search me if there is anything in my life i want you to get it out i want to be where you want me to be play i want to be positionedly placed in where the word the way that was preached placed me it has to be the cry of our heart if you truly realize that things that we see news that we hear events all the things are not just by luck something is taking place and you have a role to play i want to be the right place i should not wait for tomorrow israel was supposed to be in a certain position they were supposed to be in the land after four days they delay the things and they spend 40 years instead of just a few days to get to the promised land we don't want to go in circle [Music] we don't want to delay the lord because without us he cannot move on but we have to be willing we have to accept it but yet we delay him many ways if we can come out of this place saying lord i say it sincerely mold me change me search me the position you want me in that's where i want to be no matter what brother branham put it very bluntly blindly say that if god wants me to be a doormat that's where i want to be that's a very powerful statement you know why you say that because he has the revelation that whatever position god gives you is the best position because he knows the past the present and the future he knows exactly and he gives to his children their best i want to play my role until the lord say is enough and i have to accept it's enough it's enough if he says enough it's enough i have to be happy because god said so therefore there is a blessing behind it i i'm doing well with time you a mother you receive the time the word of your time you manifest christ in your your season that's your calling when the bride of christ you have a role to play just like brother branham did you have a role to play there will be a lot of things that may take place but it's all good you see i give all this example you hope one day to go home because of the hope you live a sanctified life and then rapture is revealed to you you accept the revelation then the vision is actually the body change you go home it's all over the place is a role you must play in the role you must play in the history of this world and anything that you do god still remember i remember story i wrote it down here 1954 1962 brother branham in 1954 he decided to take side with jesus and start preaching the tough things he used to preach about the divine healing salvation things that uh power of healing things that people can you know agree upon that at the end of 1954 it felt like this is the time i need to tell the people the truth because their denominations are not telling them the truth so he made that decision knowing what that will cost him but he went ahead anyway for eight years there was god never talked about it eight years later he sees a vision or a dream a man who looks like his father is building a woman that looked like his mother and it turned out the denomination that beating the church when she want to rise up and explore a promised a beta and baraban was afraid because he saw the denomination the system is so big i'm just a simple man seventh grade what can i do against the big systems they're all together they're gonna boycott me but because of the suffering of the bride he stood and he said you cannot treat her like that and when once he did it his muscle become big and the man look at his muscles and get afraid and god show him eight years later the position you're taking for the word of god is not lost god is saying this that you taking position for him it will bless you amen brother branham in that year 1962 god said to him that the never failing presence of god will be with you do anything oh some come and say go anywhere do anything because the never failing presence of god is with you when god says something like that you think the whole the all the trials are over no we gotta be more spiritual than that when god says to you that i'll be with you there is a chance that you're gonna go through tough that's why he said it yeah that's why he said it the never failing presence of god will be with you 1962. do you know what happened in that time his friends abandoned him the state the the state of my ministry something like that you know where he explained how people abandoned him you know 1962 he almost died because that gun he had purchased was not the right gun it was not a just right it was not the original and he almost blew his face i you know it was a time of great try after god say that never fell in presence of god is with you wow i remember reading he preached about the pressure let it go the pressure even even his associate pastor by the navel went through tough time and you got to read it between line to see it you say never is not sick but not too well i had to go cover for him and pray for the sick in the hospital but it was a promise that things will be great things were great because this is the time it declared the seed has been planted 1963 the opening of the seas christ comes it was great years 1962 not in the flesh you are christian you know sometimes it's so hard that you cannot see in front of you you don't understand what is going on but yet the never failing presence of god is with you ignore the reasoning [Music] take faith that's how it works no vision will be fulfilled without you amen you are very important in god's economy this gives us security that's what he's supposed to give to us there is no envy there is no jealousy it is just a joy that god knows he knows my name he has a plan for me i gotta play play that part i cannot even die until that is fulfilled and god is not complete his vision is not complete without my presence therefore he makes me become sanctified i want to be in that position god help me help me you know things will happen what can i do about them i don't have anything to do about that the never failing presence of god is with me so for us preachers it will be you know you taking that position you preaching that fullness of the message you keep talking about that bride the coming of the lord and the bride we won't give you our pulpit it's okay right it's okay because that's what he says he saying we are going to in the message reaction to an action he said we are going to the grocery a few weeks ago and we noticed a woman with a dress on it was the common the most uncommon thing we've seen in a long time see me there said to me she said bill what is the matter i say honey is what it is we don't want to get a accustomed to the world she said well some people have said we've got letters you're going to ruin your ministry by making such remarks as you do i say if preaching the truth wins a ministry then it ought to be ruined god has not called us to bash this to complain and but we still have to tell each other to take position anyway we still have to encourage each each other that by taking this position we are in a position that god gave us therefore we are allowing him to do what he has in his mind we have to encourage each other and uh i i have to do my part if you allow me yes do you believe it let's let's stand i've been doing very very well today let's stand and musician can come yes the bride has to be in the position that god has given to her because she has to declare things when i hear the messages that are being preached it's like the bride is declaring something that is not just brother branham who had to declare things that the bride is declaring things because the germ of life is in the body the gem of life is in the body without the body the thing will not take place therefore we may declare things what we say well we don't just have to look at what uh you know brother branham in history that was his message that was his ministry you and i have our ministry that we may declare things that will take place and it's written that we have that position but if we don't take it we delaying god god help us help me not to delay you all right help me to accept where you want me to be spiritually speaking help me search when we say to the lord search maybe the only thing that missing is i am being sincere because when god searches he finds things and then he comes with it do are we going to heed to those things that's the point but it's very important church the time of system is over the bride is rising up and she has something wrong she's playing right now all of us together there is no small one everything has to be in place like in a vision before the child can be healed amen it turns out when when everything is in place but abandoned feels some presence before that it doesn't feel anything once the everything is in position he starts feeling he knows the angel of the lord is there and god can do what he has in his mind when we are in position help us the word we hear day in day out is so powerful is the pure word of god amen he has the power to transform to mode to change to make us new creatures in christ jesus amen do you agree with me god bless you wow brother you have a song okay me that i might be [Music] my [Music] [Music] okay [Music] foreign [Music] my [Music] is [Music] me that's about our head prayer heavenly father it's over now it's a little message broken up that you gave me put it on my heart i lay it on the heart of your children it's only i can only do with the ability that you gave me it's not our ability is you father now that is laying on the heart of your children i pray that they they take it if it's your word it will have to reproduce according to his own unkind your kind so father [Music] do just that help us father with sincere heart we can say where am i at what is going on with my spiritual life is my position really where the position that he had in his mind for me and father that's what we're asking today father just come down and help us you can teach the holy ghost you can teach even deeper you can unveil things that we could not say [Music] we did not know how to say heavenly father be merciful to us we we just come humbly to you and say you gave us a free moral agency we are giving you back that free moral agency do with it whatever you want whenever you want whatever you want father grant it to us as we commit ourselves to you this bride has a role mighty role oh god open our eyes is coming oh she must prophesy she must prophesy now oh god she must prophesy the same prophecy but declare it and say it was a sad is fulfilled oh god help us you are waiting we say we wait you're coming [Music] or our body change but you are waiting upon us to take position so granted to us as we commit this church the people in your hands listen to their prayers father speak to each and every one many have believed you have trust what you say let now what they have believe what they have asked you become flesh father let it happen many have waited and waiting they have praying pray they have confess and confess god give them according to you according to your promise i'm adding my prayer upon their prayers let your grace and mercy be upon each and every one in jesus christ's name amen [Music] let's sing another [Music] is the testimony of the lord is sure [Music] making wise the simple more to be desired praise the lord we want the word to put us in position and the word has told us our position and we each one have a place [Music] and i want to be in that place but i also want you to be in your place because if you're not in your place and i'm not in my place nothing's happening so we need to encourage one another like brother brother kadima was saying encourage one another because we all must find our place and hold that place amen so that the vision can come into manifestation so things can happen remember the silence and the story that brother brenham told about the washer woman and the and the owner of the ranch's son who comes to find a bride and he speaks to her privately without everybody by knowing it but there was a private revelation he gave just to her and then he leaves amen and now she's got to get in position because she's supposed to be ready on a certain day because he said on a certain day she's got to take the promise that he gave and she's got to bring that in the manifestation on her part she's got to make the wedding dress she's got to put the wedding garment on and she's got to be ready on that day and she was faithful to her part and he was faithful to his part but in the silence amen no brother man when he tells the story doesn't tell us about letters that were coming back and forth no phone calls in that day amen but she and the silence was doing her part to show that she believed what he said about her [Music] and as it got closer come to the day and then they begin to recognize that she's been making a dress amen she's been taking this word amen and putting this word together that's been given and and all of a sudden the ridicule goes higher they've mocked her and teased her but it got worse why because in the silence she's doing something and what she's doing is proving amen that she believed what he said [Music] and then comes the day she slips the wedding garment off and she has the audacity to say that today i am the bride none of the cousins believed her none of the denominations nobody else believed her in fact they went from uh feeling sorry for her to open scorn and rebuke that open face laughing right in her face because she put the garment of the word on and she's clothing the word and she's now making a declaration she's saying i am the bride he made a promise to me i'm the one he's not marrying any of you he's marrying me [Music] oh praise god what hour we come to friends have we come to the hour that we can slip the word on and say it fits me just right because it's for me a prophet has come and clothed me with the clothing of the word amen what he's done for you is between you and god but i can say as for me that prophet came to clothe me in the word because i am the bride amen the lord has come how do you know because he's right here veiled behind this flesh boy it goes from feeling sorry for those poor people to hoping that their eyes will be open to absolute open mock and scorn but it didn't matter because she could hear the wagon wheels and when she could hear those wagon wheels when all of a sudden they saw some dust coming up on the horizon amen all the cousins you know they still weren't believers but they knew something was changing the environment is changing something's happening this hasn't happened before and before they knew what happened she was whisked away and she was gone i tell you in the silence something's happening there's something that he was doing and there was something that she was doing and god is going to be faithful to every promise he's faithfully completing everything he said he would do amen i want to be found just as faithful doing what he told me to do to put what did she do oh praise be to god she kept on washing dishes she already had the promise she was already engaged she was betrothed she knew it was happening she had the promise it was as good as done and she kept washing dishes and she kept being the servant to everyone else around her amen receiving the promise didn't give her a right to change her position until her husband said it's time to change position she had to get up monday morning after a fantastic sunday service i got my the scales fell off my eyes i realized i'm the bride i realized that the bright coming of christ is happening in me i wake up monday morning and i gotta put boots on and go right back to the same old dirty job praise be to god what's that amen that's allowing the manifestation of the word in your position [Music] but then she spent all her time faithful he left her there amen you stay here you prepare i'm coming back what did she do she spent all of her spare time with the word her wedding garment all of her spare time she did in this earth what she was supposed to do she held a position as the washer woman amen as a servant of all she held that but in all her spare time she was busy with the word making sure it would fit just right making sure everything was just right what should we be busy in this time we should be busy with the word friends all of our spare time we still have to work we still have to do all the things that we're in this life to do amen we're here he wants us here he wants us doing all of those things but in all our spare time we should be spending private time enjoying that word that he's left us praise god amen i have an announcement and it goes well with what we're talking about the wedding there's a wedding this saturday josiah mcnulty and zoe greeley are going to be getting married down in north carolina but it's going to be live streamed on facebook so make sure we can all watch it we can all be there be praying for our brother god bless you brother it's good to see you and he'll have somebody standing next to him probably next time we see him so god bless you all don't forget that this saturday and then we got some information on the bulletin board about it but god bless you hold your position friends move into your position give your life to god and be busy doing what he called us to do we love you all let's sing a song yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] and make me more likely [Music] break me lord and bless the broken pieces let me be [Music] fear and make me more like me love and bless the broken jesus [Music] i you know when brother banham saw a vision just like our brother kadima was telling us he saw the vision going to pray for the girl and the old lady was here and somebody had to move a hat from one place to another and there was another lady everybody was in position and until it was positioned he couldn't pray for the child to be healed but when everything was in position what that means is that scene has played out somewhere before that means it's finished it's already happened it's already done if god can show it by vision to a prophet it means it was already took place in the mind of god it has already happened amen and now he's showing it to the prophet and now the prophet is getting down into the vision where it's becoming manifest and all he's got to do is wait for everything that was already the way it's the way it was in the mind of god to now come into the perfect reflection on the earth and when that happens it's the manifestation of the vision or the fulfillment of the vision although it was done from before the foundation of the world that's why when when brother john told us he said the manifestation of the promise is the fulfillment of the vision so you don't have to see the vision amen to operate in the vision because god has already seen the vision god has already seen in his mind amen and now by divine revelation he's moving us by revelation amen and as that word comes to manifestation it is the vision on display whether we saw it or not god already saw it and now we're living friends if you're a predestinated sieging of god you are living in the vision your life he already saw your life he already saw certain things that were going to take place amen it's already taken place in the mind of god and now we're trying to be sensitive to get the leadership of the holy ghost and move by divine revelation so that the manifestation of the promise becomes us living in the vision that's the way i want to live brother branham had a vision and in that vision he saw a bride just like the first one marching right in time and right in step all dressed right all looking right all moving right amen i want to be the manifestation of that vision lord clean me out and make me live and walk and march by vision by what you've already seen god bless you saints it's been good to be together let's just sing a little bit as we go to be dismissed [Music] my redeemer is everything he has said here [Music] my redeemer is [Music] whose mercies [Music] [Music] is [Music] morning [Music] down from his glory everly [Music] [Music] to his older strengths tears oh oh oh [Music] [Applause] is god he laid aside his [Music] [Music] my and all god's [Music] is [Music] [Applause] sacrifice [Applause] [Applause] oh is and all dismiss so set your wings to the winds of faith you can fly in a higher place it's by grace oh there are take the word of god is in a higher place do not struggle it's my grace [Music]
