[4:06] many righteous men many holy men many
[4:08] prophets would have longed to see this
[4:10] day but god you've chosen us to be here
[4:13] and god may we take
[4:15] advantage of the privilege that's given
[4:17] to us to be here today
[4:19] god we love you and we thank you for
[4:21] your presence lord we ask that you would
[4:23] come
[4:24] and break the bread of life lord that
[4:26] you would feed us your sheep that we
[4:28] would receive the portion we have need
[4:30] of and lord thy i pray god that you
[4:32] would work through this vessel to
[4:33] minister your true word
[4:35] may we feed on it lord and gain strength
[4:38] may we give honor and glory to you and
[4:40] lord we give you preeminence and ask
[4:41] that you take preeminence among us this
[4:43] morning
[4:44] in jesus christ's name we pray
[4:47] amen
[4:49] amen god bless you while you're standing
[4:50] if you'll take your bibles and turn to
[4:53] genesis chapter one we'll begin there
[4:56] i'd like to just um
[4:59] you know mention we all know what's
[5:01] going on on the world stage and how
[5:04] things are moving right along with
[5:06] prophecy amen
[5:08] and then when brother benham told us to
[5:09] watch russia watch the king of the north
[5:12] you can see russia's rising
[5:14] and when you look at end time prophecy
[5:16] russia is when you get to the very end
[5:18] they're the dominant force on the earth
[5:21] and you can see russia rising but i just
[5:23] want you to remember our brothers and
[5:25] sisters in ukraine because i can't
[5:27] imagine what the situation is like for
[5:29] them as we're gathered here to worship
[5:31] together and enjoy the presence of the
[5:33] lord together i'm sure they're not able
[5:35] to this morning in most all of ukraine
[5:38] uh if not all of it so just remember
[5:40] them as you pray just remember the uh
[5:42] ilie and natasha's family i'm sure
[5:45] they're concerned for their family
[5:47] and with having them in the assembly it
[5:48] hits even closer to home you know so
[5:50] let's just join forces together and
[5:53] let's just pray together really quick
[5:55] for our brothers and sisters before we
[5:56] move on let's bow our hands
[5:59] lord jesus we have a special request
[6:02] lord
[6:03] as we're standing with the privilege
[6:04] you've given us to gather this morning
[6:07] and the freedom and the peace lord to
[6:08] come and hear your word to sing praises
[6:11] to your name
[6:12] lord our brothers across the planet they
[6:14] don't have that same privilege this
[6:16] morning
[6:16] our brothers and sisters in ukraine lord
[6:18] they're under stress and i'm sure
[6:20] tension and no doubt a lot of turmoil
[6:23] and confusion
[6:25] but i pray that you'd supernaturally
[6:27] intervene for them lord
[6:29] that you would be a friend that sticketh
[6:30] closer than a brother that you'd be a
[6:32] hedge of protection a wall that would
[6:34] that you would guard them lord from all
[6:36] danger from all anxiety and fear may you
[6:39] inject yourself into the situation and
[6:41] take out lord all the trappings of the
[6:44] enemy and all the dangers that are there
[6:46] against them and you supernaturally
[6:48] reveal yourself as the great husband to
[6:50] the bride may you protect your little
[6:52] bride there and may you bless them and
[6:54] may they grow and prosper in strength
[6:57] lord seeing your hand of protection upon
[6:59] them
[7:00] pray a special blessing lord
[7:02] oh brother ilya and sister natasha's
[7:05] family lord i pray you'd bless them and
[7:07] guard them watch over them and keep them
[7:09] safe provide for them even the basic
[7:12] needs that they need of food and water
[7:14] for you've promised that you will
[7:15] provide for us it's a promise in your
[7:17] scriptures and i pray that you show
[7:20] yourself mighty on their behalf and show
[7:22] how true you are to keep your word and
[7:24] provide for them lord everything that
[7:27] they have need of lord we love you our
[7:29] hearts are united with theirs and we ask
[7:31] you that all these things lord that you
[7:33] would do them for your glory in the name
[7:35] of the lord jesus christ amen
[7:39] and god bless you i just appreciate it
[7:41] we would just remember that need also i
[7:43] want to remind you that brother samuel
[7:45] wallach from poland will be here on
[7:47] wednesday so be praying for that service
[7:49] and i'm sure traveling out of the
[7:51] country might have been hard for him i
[7:53] don't know what it's like poland being a
[7:54] neighbor there to ukraine and under
[7:56] tension as well so just pray for him
[7:58] while he's out of the country and pray
[7:59] for his family
[8:01] amen the world is changing
[8:05] it's hard to see but for you and i it's
[8:07] a good thing
[8:08] because everything is moving rapidly to
[8:11] the final destination and where god is
[8:14] restoring he's bringing back all that
[8:16] was lost i mean all these things must
[8:18] needs be so we praise god that there's
[8:20] been a prophet in the land in our day to
[8:22] tell us these things to show us through
[8:24] the scriptures so that our hearts don't
[8:26] fear that we look at this and say this
[8:27] is what was told us
[8:29] these are the things we've been prepared
[8:31] for this hour these are the things that
[8:33] the lord has revealed to us amen and
[8:35] they have to be this way and we thank
[8:37] god that we have a promise for this hour
[8:40] man while we're standing let's read
[8:42] genesis
[8:45] chapter 1 verse 1.
[8:48] genesis chapter 1 verse 1.
[8:51] in the beginning
[8:53] god created the heaven
[8:54] and the earth
[8:56] let's go to john the gospel of john
[8:59] john chapter 1.
[9:10] john chapter 1
[9:13] and we'll read verse 1.
[9:16] in the beginning was the word
[9:18] and the word was with god
[9:20] and the word was god
[9:22] and the same was in the beginning with
[9:24] god
[9:25] now let's turn to revelation chapter one
[9:34] revelation chapter 1
[9:41] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[9:43] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[9:46] things which must shortly come to pass
[9:48] and he sent and signify it by his angel
[9:51] unto his servant john
[9:52] man may the lord have the blessing to
[9:54] the reading of his word as you're seated
[9:56] amen
[9:58] franco if you could bring up that first
[10:00] life for me on the powerpoint
[10:03] i'd like to go to one more scripture
[10:04] before i get into the powerpoint if we
[10:06] can go to colossians chapter one
[10:09] these are scriptures we've been looking
[10:10] at for the last
[10:12] uh two weeks
[10:13] or more
[10:15] and i want to look at colossians
[10:20] chapter
[10:21] 1
[10:22] and i'm going to
[10:23] begin reading in verse 15.
[10:27] who is the image of the invisible god
[10:29] the firstborn of every creature for by
[10:32] him were all things created that are in
[10:34] heaven and that are in earth visible and
[10:36] invisible whether they be thrones or
[10:39] dominions or principalities or powers
[10:41] all things were created by him and for
[10:44] him and he is before all things and by
[10:47] him all things consist and he is the
[10:49] head of the body the church who is the
[10:51] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[10:53] that in all things he might have the
[10:55] preeminence for it please the father
[10:58] that in him should all fullness dwell
[11:02] we've been looking at this uh subject
[11:04] for a few services now the seven seals
[11:07] opened the entire bible and we were we
[11:10] we went back the first time when we
[11:13] established the truth that brother
[11:15] branham brought to us out of the
[11:16] scriptures that jesus christ is the word
[11:19] of god amen
[11:20] he is the word and and when god was
[11:23] alone with his thinking god was with his
[11:26] thoughts and when he wanted to express
[11:28] those thoughts he expressed them in the
[11:30] word and brother branham says that's
[11:32] when the logos came forth or the
[11:34] expression of the thought of god and
[11:36] brother branham describes it he says i
[11:37] can see it like a little uh light amen
[11:40] like a little light coming forth and
[11:42] what is that that's the expression
[11:43] that's the that is the uh i would say
[11:46] the the first tangible expression that's
[11:49] that is explained to us of the
[11:51] expression of the thought of god and in
[11:53] that that came from the father amen was
[11:56] the son
[11:58] and it was the word it was the word the
[12:00] word in in john 1 1 says in the
[12:02] beginning was the word that word is
[12:04] logos and logos is not just a word a
[12:08] word that's just written just a written
[12:09] word
[12:10] is the greek word rima but logos is a
[12:13] little different than that logos is the
[12:15] word with the thought or with the intent
[12:18] amen so it's a word that is understood
[12:21] that
[12:22] that explains or you can comprehend by
[12:24] that word the thinking amen so it's a
[12:27] word that's an expression of the
[12:28] thinking
[12:30] and so now
[12:32] from the father comes amen the the logos
[12:35] or the word amen and brother branham
[12:37] tells us when when you read amen your
[12:40] bible if you don't see christ in every
[12:42] line go back and read it again for it's
[12:44] all christ amen and he said all the way
[12:47] back in the beginning when it says in
[12:49] the beginning god created he said
[12:51] there's christ right there
[12:53] and then we come to colossians and we
[12:55] find out that absolutely in the
[12:57] beginning he created what did he create
[12:59] by he created by the word we know that
[13:02] by the word of god the worlds were
[13:03] framed we know the worlds were framed by
[13:05] the word of god so god made all things
[13:08] by him and for him and without him
[13:11] nothing was made that was made
[13:14] so christ amen amen is the word of god
[13:17] the thought of god expressed coming into
[13:20] manifestation amen is christ and christ
[13:24] amen is a reflection or a manifestation
[13:27] of the father of god
[13:30] amen so we're gonna we're reviewing
[13:32] these things but we want to build on top
[13:34] of them because they have everything to
[13:36] do with you and i and everything to do
[13:38] with the day that we're living in and
[13:39] the manifestation of this moment in time
[13:42] amen
[13:43] there's a manifestation of god that is
[13:46] taking place on the earth in this moment
[13:48] and you and i have everything to do with
[13:51] that expression of god
[13:53] and we must understand these things as
[13:56] the prophet brought them to us because
[13:57] they were brought to us for a reason
[13:59] amen they were brought to bring us faith
[14:01] to take away amen the the mystery that
[14:04] has been enshrouding our existence and
[14:07] the church and the church ages and all
[14:09] down through the bible amen at the end
[14:11] time god has come with a revelation to
[14:13] peel back the mystery of the entire
[14:16] bible to give us a faith like like human
[14:19] beings have not had before amen a faith
[14:21] that will absolutely reverse the curse
[14:24] amen that came upon us in the garden of
[14:26] eden
[14:28] how did that curse come by leaving the
[14:29] word amen so what mechanism will god use
[14:32] to bring us out of that curse he'll
[14:34] restore the word amen and the
[14:36] restoration of the word will bring us
[14:38] out of that curse
[14:41] and souls that are in prison now
[14:43] says the mystery was in the seven seals
[14:46] when these seven seals was open that
[14:48] opened up the entire bible the seven
[14:51] seals it was sealed with seven mysteries
[14:53] and in these seven seals held the entire
[14:57] mystery of it this is where i this is
[14:59] where i got my text from as i said two
[15:02] services back and i was looking at this
[15:04] and saying when the seven seals was open
[15:07] that opened up the entire bible and i've
[15:09] just been praying and meditating and
[15:11] said god i want to understand that
[15:14] better i want to understand that
[15:15] statement that the prophet made better
[15:17] that when he opened the the mystery was
[15:19] in the seven seals when the seven seals
[15:21] was opened that opened up the entire
[15:23] bible because brother branham also says
[15:25] in the invisible union
[15:27] what did he do he opened up the seven
[15:30] seals of the last message you notice
[15:32] that the seven seals which all the
[15:35] mysteries of the seven church ages was
[15:37] sealed with seven seals
[15:39] the reformers didn't have time to do it
[15:41] in their days they didn't live long
[15:43] enough but but this blessed revelation
[15:46] of the seven seals it's opened to us in
[15:48] this last days from a prophecy that went
[15:51] forth to arizona
[15:52] so the the thing that i've been
[15:54] meditating on is this statement where
[15:56] brother bannon said the seven seals
[15:59] which all the mystery of the seven
[16:00] church ages were sealed up with the
[16:02] seven seals
[16:04] which you can see that so clearly that
[16:06] you know christ came and when christ
[16:08] came we talked about this on the road to
[16:10] emmaus amen he beginning at moses in all
[16:14] the scriptures amen revealed the
[16:16] scriptures pertaining to himself amen
[16:18] jesus christ was the fulfillment of the
[16:20] word of god everything that the prophets
[16:23] were showing foreshadowing telling us
[16:25] prophesying he come and he was the
[16:27] fulfillment of all of it he was the full
[16:30] word in flesh
[16:33] and so jesus on the road to emmaus amen
[16:35] and then later with the disciples behind
[16:37] the closed doors he is opening to them
[16:40] the scriptures what's he doing he's
[16:43] opening the word amen and when he's
[16:45] opening the word he's showing that this
[16:47] entire word was pointing to me
[16:50] it was showing you who i am this word
[16:52] was declaring this day and what moses
[16:55] was declaring this day amen joshua was
[16:58] declaring and jesus is standing there as
[17:00] the fulfillment peeling back the seals
[17:03] of the old testament saying it was me
[17:06] moses was showing forth me joseph was
[17:08] showing forth me
[17:10] right we see that and so he opened unto
[17:13] them the scriptures and then he opened
[17:15] their understanding to understand the
[17:17] scriptures
[17:18] but then out of christ amen the prophet
[17:21] tells us comes a chunk amen comes a
[17:23] peace amen and what is he doing now he's
[17:26] making the new testament and brother ben
[17:28] tells us here in the invisible union
[17:31] that when we get to the end of the new
[17:32] testament amen now we know that the
[17:36] those church ages have been sealed with
[17:39] seven seals and the seven seals amen the
[17:43] the mystery of the seven church ages was
[17:45] sealed with seven seals and when you
[17:47] look at the seven seals you can so
[17:49] easily see that the revelation of the
[17:52] seven seals unlocked the mystery of the
[17:55] church ages
[17:57] is that right
[17:58] the anointing the antichrist anointing
[18:00] the christ anointing coming through the
[18:02] church ages amen all of that how god
[18:05] redeemed from the time of christ on what
[18:08] the book of redemption looked like from
[18:10] christ's time on amen is all revealed in
[18:12] the seven seals so i could see that but
[18:15] brother branham said the seven seals
[18:18] opened it opened the entire bible amen
[18:21] the entire bible not just the church
[18:24] ages not just the new testament but it
[18:26] opened the entire bible and that's what
[18:28] i've been meditating on saying god let
[18:30] me see that more clearly amen how did
[18:33] the revelation of the
[18:35] christ anointings for the last 2000
[18:37] years unlocked the entire bible
[18:40] how did understanding a white horse a a
[18:42] red horse how did it unlock the entire
[18:44] bible god what are you well i don't want
[18:46] to just read something and read over it
[18:48] i don't want to just say something and
[18:50] say it but i want a revelation of why
[18:52] the prophet said it this way
[18:55] when you can look at the seals and see
[18:57] that it unlocks the new testament it
[18:58] reveals the uh the mystery through the
[19:01] church ages absolutely but brother
[19:03] branham said it did more than that it
[19:05] unlocked the entire bible
[19:08] and i want to know that amen
[19:13] he says now
[19:14] he is the one who opened those seals
[19:17] he is those seals
[19:21] that means the seals are more than just
[19:24] information amen
[19:26] the seals are more than just data
[19:30] it's not just downloaded data and facts
[19:34] and figures the seals are more than that
[19:36] friends when you open those seals he is
[19:39] those seals for the whole word of god is
[19:42] christ and christ is the seals that was
[19:45] opened what is the opening of the seals
[19:47] then revealing christ
[19:50] praise be to god then the opening of the
[19:53] seals for us has to be revealing christ
[19:56] amen it's got to be unlocking christ
[19:59] unveiling the mystery
[20:02] he says in revelation 10 1-7 but in the
[20:05] days of the voice
[20:06] of the seventh angel when he should
[20:08] begin to sound the mystery of god should
[20:11] be finished
[20:12] as he hath declared to his servants the
[20:14] prophets
[20:16] now brother brennam goes to this
[20:17] scripture and he ties
[20:19] revelation 10 1-7 the mighty angel
[20:22] coming down the seven thunders the
[20:24] sealing up of the thunders and and then
[20:26] revelation 10 7 here the mystery of god
[20:28] being finished in the days of the voice
[20:29] of the seventh angel he ties all of that
[20:32] to malachi 4 and he puts them together
[20:34] and we know that he comes to fulfillment
[20:36] of malachi 4. he was the seventh church
[20:39] age messenger he is the seventh angel he
[20:41] is the seventh messenger and in the days
[20:44] of his voice the mystery of god should
[20:46] be finished
[20:49] and at the opening of the seals amen the
[20:51] revelation was given forth that would
[20:54] finish the mystery of god
[20:59] and that mystery of god has been laying
[21:02] in the entire bible
[21:04] because the entire bible
[21:07] is christ
[21:08] and christ
[21:10] is a revelation of god
[21:13] so the entire bible is the revelation of
[21:16] god through christ christ is the word or
[21:20] the manifested thought of god
[21:24] all right so i think by now by the
[21:27] teaching that brother branham has given
[21:29] us we've been able to break away from
[21:32] denominational views of christ to where
[21:34] every time we see christ the only thing
[21:36] that we can imagine is that the the
[21:38] manifestation 2000 years ago when it was
[21:41] all bottled up in the body of flesh amen
[21:44] that was that was born and laid in a
[21:45] manger but christ amen was being
[21:48] expressed before the world was framed
[21:52] as the logos that came from the father
[21:54] christ has been expressed all the way
[21:56] down through the entire bible is christ
[21:59] amen is the manifestation of the thought
[22:02] of god the reflection or revelation of
[22:05] the thought of god that is all christ
[22:08] because the bible tells us christ was
[22:10] that rock that followed him through the
[22:13] wilderness
[22:14] so we know that that rock was christ
[22:20] all right moses when moses left egypt he
[22:23] esteemed
[22:25] the treasures of christ more than all
[22:27] the pleasures of egypt
[22:30] the reproach of christ he esteemed it
[22:32] greater bearing the reproach of christ
[22:34] and all of the treasure all of the
[22:36] pleasures that are in egypt
[22:37] so it means christ was being made
[22:39] manifest back then
[22:42] and christ we'll get on here and brother
[22:44] ben says now for a text i want to take
[22:46] out of there this for a text basing it
[22:49] upon the entire bible this is so
[22:51] critical that we we begin to take what
[22:53] the prophet said and just pray god let
[22:56] it sink so deep into my soul that it
[22:58] becomes a living reality a revelation
[23:01] not terminology amen not something i nod
[23:04] my head and say yes to again and again
[23:06] but this becomes a living reality inside
[23:09] of me that i
[23:10] i know what that prophet was talking
[23:12] about he's basing his text upon the
[23:15] entire bible but what i want to title
[23:18] this is christ is the mystery of god
[23:20] revealed christ being the mystery of god
[23:24] revealed
[23:25] what is the whole bible christ
[23:28] he's the mystery of god that is being
[23:30] revealed
[23:32] and in the days of the voice of the
[23:34] seventh angel when he shall begin the
[23:36] sound the mystery of god should be
[23:39] finished
[23:41] now
[23:42] he says now in saint john the first
[23:45] chapter
[23:46] don't forget it
[23:48] in the beginning was the word and the
[23:49] word was with god and the word was god
[23:51] and the word was meant made flesh and
[23:53] dwelt among us hebrews 13 8 said he's
[23:55] the same yesterday today and forever
[23:59] and this book is a revelation of jesus
[24:02] christ all the way from genesis to the
[24:05] last book of revelation it's the
[24:07] revelation of jesus christ the prophets
[24:10] and all those things were foreshadowing
[24:12] christ and everything in the book is
[24:14] jesus christ
[24:16] and so now we know that he is the word
[24:18] and the weeds the word made manifest for
[24:21] the day and season for the age in which
[24:23] it's meant to be made manifest making
[24:25] him the same yesterday today and forever
[24:29] so it's the same
[24:31] and that he is the word made manifest
[24:34] not the exact same actions or else in
[24:37] order for him to be the same we'd have
[24:39] to be coming out of egypt again and
[24:41] coming out of egypt again and coming out
[24:43] of egypt again
[24:46] you understand he's the same yesterday
[24:48] today and forever
[24:50] not amen not the expression has to
[24:53] repeat but he is the same that he is the
[24:56] word being expressed the manifestation
[24:59] of the word for that day makes him the
[25:01] same what was he in moses day the
[25:03] manifestation of the word
[25:06] what was he in joshua's day the
[25:07] manifestation of the word what was he in
[25:09] solomon's day the manifestation of the
[25:11] word what was he amen in our day the
[25:14] manifestation of the word making him
[25:15] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[25:18] and forever
[25:20] he is the word
[25:24] now he says the bible is not a book of
[25:26] systems let's catch this
[25:30] this is what tears down denominational
[25:32] understanding
[25:34] the bible is not a book of systems no
[25:36] sir it is not a book of systems nor a
[25:38] code of morals
[25:40] the bible is not a book of systems so
[25:42] many systems and so forth no sir it is
[25:44] not a book of morals no sir nor is it a
[25:47] book of history altogether or neither is
[25:50] it a book of theology
[25:52] it is the revelation of jesus christ
[25:56] that's why i said before we've been
[25:58] reading the bible for thousands of years
[26:01] but not seeing the bible amen reading
[26:04] but not seeing
[26:06] getting the details but not
[26:07] understanding the mystery amen seeing
[26:10] the breaststrokes but never seeing the
[26:11] picture
[26:14] and then fighting over the brush strokes
[26:17] separating over the brush strokes
[26:20] starting new divisions over portions
[26:23] that we see amen but what is it that
[26:25] tears down divisions what is it that
[26:27] crushes denominationalism when you can
[26:29] fly on eagle's wings a little bit higher
[26:31] and see the whole revelation from
[26:33] genesis
[26:34] to revelation and then all of a sudden
[26:36] you realize amen it's not the details
[26:39] that i'm fighting over the details are
[26:41] painting the picture it's the picture i
[26:43] need to see amen
[26:45] and so this bible is not a book of
[26:48] morals
[26:51] boy that really shocks some people
[26:54] neither it is a book of theology that's
[26:56] not the purpose of the written word and
[26:59] now the morality of god is contained in
[27:01] there the theology of god is contained
[27:03] the doctrine of god is contained in
[27:05] there but that's not why he gave us this
[27:07] word he gave us this word to manifest
[27:09] himself so that we would see him
[27:14] it is the revelation of jesus christ so
[27:17] you see how the bible can be so easily
[27:20] misused
[27:23] because it's not being used to manifest
[27:25] christ or reveal christ it's only being
[27:28] used to create another division
[27:31] it's being used to create another
[27:33] religious sect
[27:35] another form of theology another moral
[27:38] code another system and when the bible
[27:41] is used for that the bible is being
[27:43] misused
[27:46] because the scriptures are here to
[27:48] declare christ
[27:49] and christ is declaring god
[27:54] now he says
[27:56] all those things typed him just in time
[27:58] but yet the mystery was hid
[28:01] them men didn't know what they were
[28:03] doing they only knew that they were led
[28:05] by the spirit to do some now holding it
[28:07] back in the last days for the great
[28:09] revelation but expressing it expressing
[28:12] himself in moses and david joseph elijah
[28:16] and on down through and we could take
[28:18] each one of those prophets and bring
[28:20] their lives out and show
[28:22] it expressed jesus christ perfectly
[28:25] exactly yet never giving his secret in
[28:27] full waiting for to make it known in the
[28:30] last days as he promised waiting for it
[28:33] to be fully comprehended see before he
[28:36] could express it if he told the whole
[28:38] thing
[28:40] praise be to god the whole bible was
[28:42] expressing the mystery
[28:44] giving it out in portions and shadows
[28:47] and in times it was expressing the
[28:49] mystery and expressing the mystery but
[28:51] holding back the great revelation of it
[28:54] because the great revelation of it was
[28:56] going to be sealed and the last book of
[28:58] the bible sealed under seven seals and
[29:00] it was going to be shadowed and typed
[29:03] and shadowed and typed and spoke of and
[29:05] prophesied about and typed and shattered
[29:08] all the way through they were expressing
[29:09] it expressing it expressing it
[29:11] expressing it but holding back the great
[29:14] revelation of it until the last days and
[29:16] in the last days he would take the veil
[29:18] off the whole thing and show the mystery
[29:20] of god
[29:24] he has showed or revealed it in every
[29:26] type that's in the bible
[29:28] therefore the entire bible is the
[29:30] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[29:34] the entire bible is an expression of one
[29:36] goal that god had one purpose he wanted
[29:39] to achieve in the entire bible and all
[29:41] the acts of the believers in the bible
[29:43] has been in type in expressing what
[29:45] god's great goal is and now in this last
[29:48] day he has revealed it and shows it
[29:52] and god said well you'll see it right
[29:54] here this morning what the lord has had
[29:55] in his mind all along and has expressed
[29:58] it brother comes down to christ as the
[30:00] mystery of god revealed takes the entire
[30:02] bible amen for his text and entitles it
[30:05] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[30:09] and then does the entire bible is the is
[30:12] the revelation of god's mystery in
[30:14] christ and he tells us the entire bible
[30:17] is an expression of one goal that god
[30:19] had
[30:20] now you can see
[30:22] why if we go to the bible and we can do
[30:24] the same thing with the message of the
[30:26] hour if we go to it and we start digging
[30:29] around in there in the details and start
[30:31] and start uh
[30:33] fixating on on details and complicating
[30:37] and dividing and and arguing and and
[30:40] creating new doctrines and new movements
[30:42] and all of these things we it shows
[30:44] right there we've missed the whole thing
[30:47] because it wasn't given for that purpose
[30:49] this revelation in the end time is to
[30:51] show us the mystery of the entire bible
[30:53] and the mystery of the time bible is
[30:54] christ and christ is the mystery of god
[30:56] that's being revealed
[30:58] so it's all about revealing god
[31:03] and in the last days he has revealed it
[31:07] brother man says he has revealed it
[31:10] and shows it
[31:13] and he was preaching christ as the
[31:15] mystery of god revealed hoping
[31:17] that you'll see it right here this
[31:19] morning
[31:21] and how many guilt were guilty of not
[31:23] seeing it right then
[31:27] but by god's grace he's constantly
[31:29] unfolding the mystery to you and i as
[31:31] individuals so we can see more clearly
[31:34] what this whole thing is all about and
[31:36] who it is that we love
[31:40] it says the book of revelation is the
[31:41] last book of the bible
[31:43] it's sealed to unbelievers
[31:46] in there the bible says in the 22nd
[31:49] chapter whosoever shall take one word
[31:50] from it or add one word to it it'll take
[31:53] his part from the book of life we
[31:54] realize that it was all together given
[31:57] for believers and it opens the book of
[31:59] revelations and reveals who the author
[32:01] of the entire book is
[32:03] he is the look upon his alpha and omega
[32:05] from genesis to revelations jesus christ
[32:08] just the same right straight through and
[32:10] reveals his complete mystery of himself
[32:14] and his plan for his church ages that is
[32:16] to come and was sealed in there by seven
[32:18] seals
[32:20] so now brother benham is specifically
[32:22] talking about the last book of the bible
[32:24] the book of revelation and he says that
[32:26] book of revelation amen
[32:29] is sealed to unbelievers amen that book
[32:32] is sealed to unbelievers
[32:34] and he says it is it reveals the
[32:38] complete mystery of himself
[32:40] so the book of revelation
[32:43] is to reveal the complete mystery of
[32:46] jesus christ
[32:48] hold that in your mind
[32:51] he goes on to say and now remember the
[32:53] word always comes to a prophet we all
[32:55] know that god does nothing without
[32:57] showing it to his prophets that's the
[32:59] reason the book of revelation of jesus
[33:00] christ is the full fullness of christ
[33:03] right here before us the book
[33:06] so now brother branham says that your
[33:08] entire bible is the revelation of jesus
[33:10] christ
[33:12] and then he'll go to the last book
[33:16] just
[33:18] oh
[33:20] just about that much
[33:23] and he'll say that is the complete
[33:24] revelation of jesus christ
[33:29] praise be to god
[33:31] these are why we meditate
[33:34] these are why we ponder this is why we
[33:36] go back to the message this is why god
[33:38] sent a prophet is our day because
[33:40] brother ben said all of these things for
[33:42] a reason and everything he said carries
[33:44] great weight and brings a great
[33:45] revelation of god the entire bible is
[33:48] the revelation of jesus christ the book
[33:49] of revelation is the complete revelation
[33:52] of himself
[33:54] now let's look at this let's go to
[33:56] revelation chapter one together
[34:10] the revelation
[34:11] genesis revelation 1 1 the revelation of
[34:14] jesus christ which god gave to him to
[34:17] show unto his servants things much which
[34:19] must shortly come to pass
[34:22] so
[34:24] this book
[34:25] is the revelation of jesus christ
[34:28] right from the beginning he's telling
[34:31] you what the entire book is about it is
[34:35] the revelation of jesus christ
[34:38] and
[34:39] it was given to christ
[34:41] and given from christ to a servant to be
[34:44] given to
[34:46] an angel to give to his servants but if
[34:48] we look at this uh word revelation in
[34:50] the bible it's apocalypses
[34:53] it's interpreted revelation
[34:55] manifestation coming appearing these are
[34:58] all the times it's used in the new
[35:00] testament
[35:01] it's used in those words but if you get
[35:03] to the definition there in part part one
[35:05] of the definitions it says a laying bear
[35:08] a making naked
[35:10] a disclosure of truth
[35:12] instruction concerning things before
[35:14] unknown and then down the part that i
[35:16] have an orange it says used of events by
[35:19] which things or states or persons
[35:21] hitherto withdrawn from view
[35:24] are made visible to all manifestation
[35:27] and appearance
[35:28] so this is the revelation of jesus
[35:30] christ this last book of the bible which
[35:33] is the capping off of the entire bible
[35:36] which is the capstone book of the entire
[35:38] bible that book is the revelation of
[35:41] jesus christ
[35:43] and that word apocalypse means
[35:45] events by which things or states or
[35:48] persons hitherto withdrawn from view
[35:51] are made visible to all manifestation
[35:54] and appearance so what is this
[35:56] revelation of jesus christ going to do
[35:58] it is going to open your eyes to
[36:00] something that's been previously out of
[36:01] view
[36:03] there's been a person that's been out of
[36:05] view there's been a person that's been
[36:06] unseen his appearance has not been
[36:09] recognized amen through the church ages
[36:11] and that appearance is going to be
[36:14] unveiled amen in the book of revelation
[36:16] now it is the unveiling it is the
[36:19] unmasking amen it is it is the opening
[36:22] the manifestation of jesus christ
[36:26] what the book of revelation is so the
[36:28] book of revelation this prophecy that
[36:30] he's laying down is going to become his
[36:32] the revelation of himself what is it
[36:35] something that's been previously
[36:37] out of
[36:38] sight
[36:40] not that he wasn't there
[36:43] but been out of sight amen not not made
[36:46] known not declared but now that thing
[36:49] that's been there but undeclared is
[36:51] going to be declared and what will
[36:53] declare it this end time book which is
[36:56] sealed to unbelievers and sealed by
[36:58] seven seals when the seven seals comes
[37:00] on it unlocks that book when it unlocks
[37:02] that book and unlocks the entire bible
[37:04] and what does it unlock the revelation
[37:07] of jesus christ what had been previously
[37:09] unseen
[37:11] is now
[37:13] appearing
[37:17] out of the church age book he says the
[37:19] scribe not author of this book is saint
[37:21] john the divine historians agree that he
[37:24] lived the last part of his life in
[37:25] ephesus though at the time of the
[37:27] writing of this book he was on the isle
[37:29] of patmos it is not the life story of
[37:31] john but it is the revelation of jesus
[37:34] christ in the future church ages
[37:37] in verse 3 it is called a prophecy and
[37:40] then is actually what it is
[37:43] so when jesus gave this to john it was a
[37:46] prophecy of what was coming
[37:49] but what was coming
[37:51] amen it was his revelation of himself
[37:54] but a prophecy
[37:57] and let's look at this in chapter one
[37:59] let's go over to verse nine
[38:02] chapter 1 verse 9 right in the beginning
[38:06] i john who also am your brother and
[38:09] companion in tribulation and in the
[38:10] kingdom and patience of jesus christ
[38:13] was in the aisle that is called patmos
[38:15] for the word of god and for the
[38:16] testimony of jesus christ and i was in
[38:18] the spirit on the lord's day and i heard
[38:20] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[38:23] saying i am alpha and omega the first
[38:26] and the last what thou seest write in a
[38:29] book and send it unto the seven churches
[38:31] which are in asia unto ephesus and unto
[38:33] smyrna unto pergamos and unto thyatira
[38:36] and under sardis and then to
[38:38] philadelphia and unto laodicea
[38:40] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[38:42] with me and being turned i saw seven
[38:45] golden candle sticks and in the midst of
[38:47] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[38:49] of man clothed with the garment down to
[38:52] the foot and gird about the paps with a
[38:54] golden girdle his head and his hairs
[38:56] were white like wool as white as snow
[38:59] and his eyes were as a flame of fire and
[39:01] his feet like in defined brass as if
[39:03] they burned in a furnace in his voice as
[39:06] the sound of many waters
[39:08] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[39:10] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[39:12] two-edged sword and his countenance as
[39:14] the sun shineth in all of his strength
[39:17] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[39:19] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[39:21] saying unto me fear not i am the first
[39:24] and the last i am he that liveth and was
[39:26] dead and behold i am alive forevermore
[39:28] amen and have the keys of hell and of
[39:31] death
[39:33] write the things which thou has seen and
[39:35] the things which are and the things
[39:36] which shall be hereafter the mystery of
[39:39] the seven stars which thou sawest in my
[39:41] right hand and the seven golden
[39:43] candlesticks the seven stars are the
[39:45] angels of the seven churches and the
[39:47] seven candlesticks which thou sawest are
[39:49] the seven churches
[39:52] now i want to look at this right out of
[39:54] the chute in revelations chapter 1 and
[39:57] revelations 1 1 this is called the
[39:59] revelation of jesus christ brother bam
[40:01] told us this is the revelation of
[40:04] himself
[40:06] and when you go to see
[40:08] christ being revealed in the book of
[40:10] revelation amen i just i'm going to say
[40:13] some things but stay with me on this and
[40:15] don't don't let your mind amen uh just
[40:18] listen to me okay
[40:21] when he when he hears a voice like a
[40:23] trump and he turns amen he is now seeing
[40:27] jesus christ in an expression but that
[40:29] expression he is seeing is not the man
[40:32] from nazareth
[40:35] he is seeing the man from nazareth
[40:37] didn't have white hair the man from
[40:39] nazareth didn't have a sword coming out
[40:41] of his mouth the man from nazareth
[40:42] didn't have feet like brass amen that
[40:44] the man from nazareth that wasn't that
[40:47] was this was jesus christ but he's
[40:50] represented in another form and another
[40:52] expression and another manifestation
[40:55] it's the same jesus christ but now he's
[40:58] revealing himself another way than what
[41:01] john had seen him last
[41:04] is that clear
[41:06] and now we see jesus christ and when he
[41:09] turns listen when he turns to see the
[41:13] voice that spake to him he turns to look
[41:15] and and it doesn't say that first he saw
[41:18] him the first thing he saw was seven
[41:20] candle sticks
[41:22] so the first thing he sees is seven
[41:24] candlesticks we'll read that here in
[41:26] verse 12 and i turned to see the voice
[41:28] that's spaking to me and being turned i
[41:31] saw seven golden
[41:32] candlesticks and in the midst or in the
[41:35] middle of the seven candlesticks one
[41:37] likened to the son of man
[41:39] amen so if i could say it this way when
[41:42] he turned
[41:44] he heard the voice he turned we know by
[41:47] the description
[41:48] that this is christ amen this is christ
[41:51] he is the white wigged one he is the
[41:53] white raymond the face shining like the
[41:55] sun he is the one with the feet of brass
[41:57] the sword coming out of his mouth the
[41:59] the the white wig of supremacy this is
[42:02] jesus christ but when he turned to hear
[42:04] the voice he saw the candlesticks and in
[42:07] the middle of the candlesticks he saw
[42:09] this one that was talking to him
[42:12] so what is the revelation of jesus
[42:14] christ in the book of revelations the
[42:16] revelation of jesus christ in the book
[42:18] of revelations is not the manifestation
[42:21] of the baby in the manger it is the
[42:22] manifestation of jesus christ in the
[42:25] middle of his church
[42:27] the revelation in the book of
[42:30] revelations is the revelation of jesus
[42:33] christ coming forth in bride form
[42:37] that's the book of revelations
[42:39] it's not going back and saying he was
[42:42] born in bethlehem he was in a manger we
[42:46] saw his star that manifestation already
[42:49] came that was the fullness of the word
[42:51] made flesh but now we come to the book
[42:54] of revelation and he's saying the
[42:56] revelation of jesus christ that god gave
[42:58] to him and he gave unto uh sent it and
[43:00] signified it by an angel and to a
[43:02] servant john
[43:04] now here's another revelation or the
[43:07] revelation of himself but how is he
[43:09] going to reveal himself he's gonna
[43:11] reveal himself standing in the middle of
[43:13] seven church ages
[43:17] that's why when we come to the book of
[43:19] revelation we come to the seals when he
[43:21] takes the seals off the revelation the
[43:24] apocalypse says amen the unfolding the
[43:27] unveiling is something that's previously
[43:29] not been seen but now coming into
[43:31] manifestation because through the church
[43:34] ages we weren't seeing that this is
[43:36] christ coming through his body
[43:40] praise be to god
[43:42] so now we come to the revelation 1 1
[43:45] sets the tone for the rest of the book
[43:47] of revelation and it is the revelation
[43:49] of jesus christ how is he manifest first
[43:52] he you you you see you hear the voice of
[43:54] a trumpet amen it's the voice of god
[43:57] amen you turn to see and you see seven
[43:59] candlesticks and then in the middle of
[44:01] the candlesticks is the one who's
[44:02] speaking he's speaking out from the
[44:04] candlesticks
[44:08] and then
[44:09] you go to revelation chapter two
[44:12] chapter three
[44:15] it's the church ages
[44:18] you go to chapter four after the church
[44:20] ages john a type of the bride is caught
[44:22] up higher to get a heavenly revelation a
[44:25] spiritual understanding sees that the
[44:27] book is open takes the book the lamb
[44:29] takes the book and opens the seals
[44:31] bringing us to revelation chapter 10 the
[44:33] seven thunders and when we come to the
[44:35] time that the seventh angels on earth
[44:37] the mystery of god to be finished the
[44:39] the seven thunders will now uh be
[44:42] revealed when they're revealed it looks
[44:44] back amen and explains redemption
[44:47] through the last two thousand years
[44:50] which is what
[44:52] christ coming in pride form
[44:56] so the revelation of jesus christ in the
[44:58] book of revelation is christ in the
[45:01] midst of the seven candlesticks
[45:04] so the book of revelation
[45:07] it's not
[45:10] it's not
[45:12] rehearsing again
[45:14] the previous manifestation
[45:17] it's a prophecy showing from that point
[45:19] on where christ is going to be
[45:24] and when the revelation is made known
[45:26] it's the unveiling of christ
[45:29] and we see where he's been that's what
[45:31] the seals opened up to us is where
[45:32] christ has been the last two thousand
[45:34] years
[45:35] and what he's been doing and how he's
[45:36] been redeeming
[45:42] he says
[45:43] the book of revelations the greek word
[45:45] apocalypse
[45:47] which means the unveiling
[45:49] taking a veil off a statue is really
[45:51] what the greek means by taking the veil
[45:53] from a statue and letting the people see
[45:55] what's been made and it's the revelation
[45:57] of jesus christ in his church
[46:01] what is the book of revelation the
[46:03] revelation of jesus christ in his church
[46:05] what did the seals open up how he's been
[46:07] redeeming for the last 2000 years christ
[46:09] through his church but the prophet told
[46:12] us that when he unlocked those seals it
[46:14] unlocked the entire bible not just the
[46:16] last two thousand years
[46:21] amen
[46:22] let's go to revelation chapter two verse
[46:24] one
[46:36] unto the angel of the church of the
[46:37] ephesians write these things saith he
[46:40] that holdeth the seven stars in his
[46:42] right hand
[46:43] who walketh in the midst of the seven
[46:45] golden candlesticks
[46:47] brother branham is going to pick up this
[46:48] statement
[46:50] because when john turned to see the one
[46:52] who spoke to him which what what is john
[46:54] receiving the revelation of jesus christ
[46:56] don't ever forget that friends john is
[46:58] receiving the revelation of jesus christ
[47:00] john's a type of the bride he's
[47:02] receiving the revelation of jesus christ
[47:04] and jesus christ is revealing himself
[47:07] through his church
[47:09] and now
[47:10] now
[47:11] we come to uh ephesians and where where
[47:14] he saw when he turned to see the voice
[47:17] of the one speaking to him he saw seven
[47:19] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[47:21] candlesticks one like to the son of man
[47:23] and then we got the description of that
[47:25] but now we get a a little further
[47:27] depiction or declaration of christ and
[47:30] the candlesticks he says now uh
[47:33] uh let's read it again unto the angel
[47:35] the church of the ephesians right these
[47:36] things saith he that holdeth the seven
[47:38] stars in his right hand who walketh in
[47:41] the midst of the seven golden
[47:43] candlesticks that means he's walking in
[47:46] the midst he's not stationary he's in
[47:49] motion
[47:52] he says in the ephesians church age
[47:54] walking in the midst of these seven
[47:55] golden candlesticks was jesus christ the
[47:57] almighty god what is he doing he didn't
[48:00] say he was walking in one candle stick
[48:02] he was walking in the midst of all of
[48:04] them what does that denote that he is
[48:07] the same god yesterday today and forever
[48:10] and in every church age to every
[48:12] believer he comes to with the holy ghost
[48:14] to every age and to every person same
[48:17] yesterday today and forever so what's he
[48:21] doing in the seven church ages he's
[48:23] walking through the set he's walking in
[48:27] the midst of the seven churches once
[48:29] he's moving through the church ages what
[48:32] is this movement all about it's christ
[48:35] building his bride building his body
[48:37] through seven church ages what is it
[48:40] it's the revelation of himself he's
[48:42] revealing himself in feminine form and
[48:45] he's in the church this is the
[48:47] revelation of jesus christ he's in the
[48:49] candlesticks walking
[48:52] in the midst of the candlesticks through
[48:54] seven church ages
[48:57] where has he been
[48:58] he's been there all along
[49:00] that's what the seals opened up where
[49:02] has he been it's been him it's been him
[49:05] moving been him moving and moving and
[49:07] moving what's he doing building from the
[49:09] legs amen up to the arms up to the head
[49:12] what's he doing he's now expressing
[49:14] himself in his bride form amen he's
[49:17] building a bride through seven church
[49:19] ages it's he himself walking in the
[49:22] midst of the seven church ages
[49:26] now
[49:28] he says now remember
[49:30] in the first of the church ages as we
[49:32] close he was walking among the seven
[49:34] golden candlesticks is that right
[49:36] the seven church ages
[49:39] and at the end here we find him outside
[49:42] of the church
[49:43] the laosei and the laodicean church
[49:45] let's go to revelation chapter 3.
[49:55] let's start at the latest in church age
[49:57] in verse 14
[50:01] and unto the angel of the church of the
[50:03] laodiceans write these things saith the
[50:05] amen the faithful and true witness the
[50:07] beginning of the creation of god
[50:10] i know thy works that thou art neither
[50:11] cold nor hot
[50:13] i would thou were cold or hot so then
[50:15] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[50:17] cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my
[50:19] mouth because thou sayest i am rich and
[50:22] increased with goods and have need of
[50:23] nothing and know us not thou art
[50:25] wretched and miserable and poor blind
[50:28] and naked this is the condition of the
[50:29] church in the end time
[50:32] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[50:34] in the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[50:36] white raiment that thou mayest be
[50:37] clothed
[50:38] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[50:40] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[50:42] eyes as that thou mayest see
[50:44] as many as i love i rebuke and chase and
[50:46] be zealous therefore and repent i want
[50:48] to go back and read verse 18 again i
[50:50] counseled thee to buy of me gold tried
[50:52] in the fire
[50:53] that thou mayest be rich white raiment
[50:55] that thou mayest be clothed
[50:57] and anointed on eyes with eyes after
[50:59] thou may see
[51:00] friends everything he's offering to
[51:02] laodicea he offered in the message of
[51:04] the hour
[51:06] if you want the gold tried on fire if
[51:08] you want the white raiment to cover your
[51:09] neckiness and you want the anointing oil
[51:11] anoint your eyes it's all in the message
[51:13] of the hour amen and if you refuse the
[51:16] message you stay in blindness and
[51:18] nakedness and wretchedness and misery
[51:21] because everything he provided to the
[51:23] laodicean age to bring them out of that
[51:25] condition he provided through the
[51:27] message of the hour the message is the
[51:29] word it's our white raiment it's the
[51:31] gold amen the revelation of god himself
[51:34] it is the i salve amen to open our eyes
[51:36] to see it's all in the message the
[51:38] message has the cure for laodicea
[51:43] verse 20 and behold i stand at the door
[51:46] and knock if any man hear my voice and
[51:48] open this is where we find him outside
[51:50] the church
[51:51] when you look at
[51:53] revelation 1 the revelation of jesus
[51:54] christ he's standing in the midst of the
[51:56] seven candlesticks amen then when you
[51:58] look at ephesus he's the one who's
[52:00] walking through the midst of the
[52:01] candlesticks but now when you get to the
[52:04] end of the laodicean church age he's
[52:06] standing outside knocking on the door
[52:08] amen i thought he was in the
[52:10] candlesticks i thought he was walking
[52:12] through the candlesticks but now we see
[52:14] a transition at the end of the laodicean
[52:16] church age something we haven't seen
[52:18] previously but now the one who was in
[52:20] the midst of the of the the candlesticks
[52:22] the one who was walking is now outside
[52:25] the church knocking on the door
[52:29] behold i stand at the door and knock if
[52:31] any man hear my voice and open the door
[52:33] i will come into him and will sup with
[52:35] him and he with me
[52:36] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[52:38] sit with me in my throne even as i also
[52:40] overcome and have set down with my
[52:42] father in his throne he that hath an ear
[52:45] let him hear what the spirit saith and
[52:47] to the churches here's what the prophet
[52:49] of god goes on to say
[52:51] the most pathetic scripture i've ever
[52:53] seen is is revelations the third chapter
[52:56] when at the laodicean church a jesus
[52:58] standing on the outside of his own
[52:59] church knocking trying to get back in
[53:02] at the first church he was walking
[53:03] through the seven golden candlesticks
[53:05] the church ages but in laodicea he was
[53:07] on the outside trying to get back in his
[53:10] own church it shows what this age has
[53:12] done to him
[53:15] in the unveiling of god he said for this
[53:17] act he changes his form then he come the
[53:20] form of son of man
[53:22] now i want to stop for just a minute and
[53:25] show
[53:25] that when he's in the midst of the seven
[53:27] golden candlesticks
[53:30] and when he's walking through the midst
[53:31] of the seven candlesticks he's in the
[53:33] form of son of god he's the holy ghost
[53:35] in the church
[53:37] but something changes when they reject
[53:40] him and put him outside the church when
[53:41] they reject him and put him outside the
[53:43] church now he's going to change form and
[53:46] he's going to begin operating in another
[53:48] form
[53:49] the signal is when they rejected christ
[53:52] amen when they rejected him amen and
[53:55] pushed him out of the of the churches
[53:57] when they pushed him out in laodicea now
[54:00] he begins another manifestation of
[54:02] himself he comes in another form
[54:07] that's why this book of revelation is
[54:08] the revelation of jesus christ
[54:12] let's read this
[54:13] he changes his form then he come in the
[54:15] form of son of man he's been son of god
[54:18] for nearly 2 000 years but when they
[54:19] reject him now they've pushed the son of
[54:22] god out the holy ghost out and now he's
[54:24] coming to reveal himself the son of man
[54:27] for the reformers age wesley luther and
[54:29] all down through
[54:30] when they find out that they got to so
[54:32] bundled up just like the israelites did
[54:34] to when he does appear in the last days
[54:36] and the pentecostal age as the holy
[54:39] spirit they rejected it they did the
[54:41] same thing israel did
[54:43] and what does he do now return as son of
[54:46] man and then from that son of david see
[54:49] how close we are son of man son of david
[54:52] son of god he is revealed in the last
[54:55] days as son of man according to malachi
[54:58] 4
[54:59] so brother man it's attaching this to
[55:01] malachi 4 behold i send you a lie the
[55:03] prophet before the great and dreadful
[55:04] day of the lord
[55:06] and all the rest of the prophecies
[55:07] pertaining to this hour
[55:10] no more dealing with the church they put
[55:12] him out on the outside knocking at the
[55:15] door
[55:16] so this son of man ministry this of son
[55:19] of man was not for the churches anymore
[55:22] he's not dealing with the churches
[55:23] anymore they put him out a son of god
[55:26] now he's coming a son of man to reveal
[55:28] himself in another way and another
[55:30] expression what is it the revealing
[55:33] the unveiling of jesus christ
[55:36] now he's unveiling himself as son of man
[55:39] for we have son of god through the
[55:41] church ages then son of man is is the
[55:44] prophetic office the son of man is jesus
[55:48] christ in flesh
[55:51] jesus christ in flesh is the son of man
[55:56] and then when he's finished with that
[55:58] it's going to be son of god in the
[56:00] millennium when he sits upon the throne
[56:01] of david his father
[56:03] that's why brother bram said see how
[56:05] close we are we've already moved they've
[56:07] pushed him out in the later season
[56:09] church ages son of god he's come back a
[56:11] son of god a man
[56:12] attaching it to malachi 4.
[56:16] luke 17 30
[56:18] in the revealing of the son of man
[56:20] what is it it's the prophetic office
[56:22] it's jesus christ in the form of a
[56:25] prophet a son of man revealing the son
[56:28] of man
[56:30] and it's the revelation of jesus christ
[56:34] amen
[56:35] and when he comes to that point he's no
[56:37] more dealing with the church
[56:40] they put him out
[56:45] now he says
[56:46] jesus said
[56:48] that would come again
[56:49] as it was in the days of sodom so shall
[56:51] it be in the coming of the son of man
[56:54] again the spirit of god will come upon
[56:56] mortal human flesh
[56:59] as it was in sodom
[57:01] what happened in sodom amen when god
[57:04] came upon mortal human flesh god picked
[57:07] up dust of the earth and he made himself
[57:09] a body and god himself stepped into that
[57:11] body and came to speak to abraham
[57:14] and when he spoke to abraham he told
[57:16] abraham the plan of god he told abraham
[57:19] the timing of god he was revealing the
[57:21] word to abraham and as he was revealing
[57:24] the plan to abraham
[57:26] he discerned the thoughts of sarah in
[57:28] the tent behind him showing the sign of
[57:30] the messiah
[57:32] is that right
[57:34] so now
[57:35] we're going to have a repeat of that
[57:38] where there's going to be god the life
[57:40] of jesus christ is going to step back
[57:42] into a body of flesh a son of man
[57:44] revealing the son of man brother branham
[57:47] wasn't the son of man he was the vessel
[57:49] a son of man that the son of man was
[57:51] going to work in
[57:53] and to prove it he would turn his back
[57:55] to the crowd and say over here is a
[57:57] sister and this brother and you this and
[57:59] that showing that we've come right back
[58:02] to this place we're in the son of man
[58:04] ministry that jesus christ himself is
[58:07] here working in human flesh
[58:10] he's not dealing with the churches
[58:11] anymore they put him down this is not
[58:13] the son of god ministry anymore this is
[58:15] the son of man this is god himself
[58:18] stepping into flesh amen to to manifest
[58:21] himself and he was doing that in that
[58:23] prophet
[58:26] and the spirit of god will come upon
[58:28] mortal human flesh
[58:30] brother branham is talking about his own
[58:32] flesh
[58:34] this is why so many times brother
[58:35] branham would say things like now i hope
[58:38] you're catching it i hope i don't have
[58:39] to come right out and say it i i hope
[58:41] you're getting my meaning he's not
[58:43] wanting to stand up and say listen god
[58:45] is in my flesh listen to what i'm saying
[58:48] if you ignore what i'm saying you're
[58:50] rejected because christ is here
[58:53] he's basically saying he's not in your
[58:55] churches he's not in your systems he's
[58:57] not in your theology he's not there he
[58:59] is in me right now and the only way to
[59:01] get the revelation of jesus christ is
[59:03] come to the vessel that he is in
[59:08] but he didn't want to come right out and
[59:10] say that i mean who does
[59:16] but that's what he can't say
[59:19] because the third pool he can't say
[59:25] he can't give the full revelation the
[59:28] third pool can't be spoken out the the
[59:31] elect has to catch it
[59:36] again the spirit of god will come upon
[59:37] mortal human flesh
[59:39] that man eat the meat of a calf drink
[59:42] the milk from a cow eat butter and bread
[59:44] in human flesh and abraham said he was
[59:46] elohim god manifested in flesh
[59:50] jesus promised that god before his
[59:52] coming would be manifested in human
[59:55] flesh again
[59:57] did you see it
[59:59] have you seen it
[1:00:01] have you seen him discern the thoughts
[1:00:02] of sarah in the tent behind him have you
[1:00:04] seen him give the plan to abraham and
[1:00:06] reveal his mind to abraham wow we're
[1:00:09] discerning the thoughts of sarah and the
[1:00:10] tent behind him we have seen amen the
[1:00:13] fulfillment of malachi 4 revolut luke 17
[1:00:16] 30 revelation 10 7 we have seen it we
[1:00:19] have heard it we have witnessed of it it
[1:00:22] is god himself working through human
[1:00:24] flesh
[1:00:27] that's why you cannot reject that human
[1:00:29] flesh
[1:00:30] that's just flesh
[1:00:32] but it's the flesh that god spoke
[1:00:34] through
[1:00:35] it's the one he chose
[1:00:38] and that is the son of man coming back
[1:00:41] into the church
[1:00:44] listen when we want to see the son of
[1:00:46] man coming back into the church
[1:00:48] people want to see nail pierced hands
[1:00:51] but brother branham said we don't look
[1:00:52] for nail pierced hands we look for the
[1:00:54] word made manifest
[1:00:56] to recognize him
[1:00:58] and when the son of man the ministry of
[1:01:01] jesus christ himself come back into the
[1:01:02] church it came through the prophecy of
[1:01:05] malachi 4.
[1:01:07] luke 17 30.
[1:01:09] that was in the prophet brother branham
[1:01:15] there's no
[1:01:16] wiggle room on that
[1:01:18] and there's no way around that
[1:01:22] and without that we do not have the
[1:01:25] revelation of jesus christ
[1:01:32] improving his word
[1:01:34] now follow this quote
[1:01:38] carefully
[1:01:39] in the days of sodom so will it be at
[1:01:41] the coming of the son of man it's
[1:01:42] referring to the same thing
[1:01:44] when the son of man is being revealed

[1:02:34] giving a greater manifestation what is
[1:02:36] it jesus christ revealing himself

[1:02:42] and he says
[1:02:44] not no more as a church see not no more
[1:02:47] the bride is called see it's not church
[1:02:50] ages anymore when we get to this point
[1:02:52] he's done dealing with the church now
[1:02:54] he's calling a bride and how is he
[1:02:56] calling a bride he's calling a bride one
[1:02:59] by one amen he's not dealing with a
[1:03:01] system he's not dealing with a group
[1:03:03] he's not dealing with the church he is
[1:03:05] calling his bride he's calling her
[1:03:08] by
[1:03:09] revealing himself as the son of man at
[1:03:12] the end of the church ages revealing the
[1:03:14] word opening the seals declaring the
[1:03:16] mystery is him calling her name amen and
[1:03:19] she has something on the inside of her
[1:03:22] ears to hear that are not these ears
[1:03:26] listen when brother branham talks
[1:03:28] talking about the restoration of the
[1:03:29] bride tree and he starts preaching he
[1:03:31] goes oh he goes how i wish i could go
[1:03:33] back to ezekiel and pull up those dry
[1:03:35] bones
[1:03:37] and he's showing the three stages of the
[1:03:40] church coming back the restoration of
[1:03:41] the bride tree the church coming through
[1:03:43] luther through wesley through pentecost
[1:03:45] now standing upon her feet but there was
[1:03:47] one last thing that had to come a
[1:03:49] calling for the wind which was the life
[1:03:51] and the life had to enter back in and
[1:03:53] they'd be a mighty marching army
[1:03:54] marching to zion amen
[1:03:56] and so he's showing he's taking ezekiel
[1:03:59] and he's showing how through through the
[1:04:01] church ages the body has been built back
[1:04:04] up and now it's back there but it's
[1:04:06] going to take another speaking of the
[1:04:08] prophet another prophecy a calling forth
[1:04:10] for the wind for the life for the spirit
[1:04:12] to come back in full measure back into
[1:04:15] this army again and then it's a marching
[1:04:17] army
[1:04:19] but listen to what he says
[1:04:23] hear ye dry
[1:04:24] bones the word of the lord
[1:04:28] how did those bones hear
[1:04:32] he is not talking about natural hearing
[1:04:37] this has nothing to do with your ability
[1:04:39] to play a tape
[1:04:42] you can play a tape and you can hear the
[1:04:44] prophet's voice
[1:04:45] but you're going to have to have a whole
[1:04:47] different set of ears than these you
[1:04:49] have to have the same ears those dry
[1:04:51] bones had that could hear the prophecy
[1:04:52] from the prophet ezekiel and they would
[1:04:54] start coming together bone to bone send
[1:04:56] you to send you it wasn't these that
[1:04:58] will get the job done you can come to
[1:05:00] service after service play tape after
[1:05:02] tape but you're going to have to have
[1:05:04] another set of ears down on the inside
[1:05:06] to hear what the spirit is speaking to
[1:05:08] the church
[1:05:13] amen
[1:05:15] see not no more bride is called in that
[1:05:18] day the son of man will be revealed what
[1:05:20] to join the church to the head to unite
[1:05:23] the marriage of the bride so why the
[1:05:26] ministry of brother branham why the
[1:05:28] seventh angel why the son of man
[1:05:30] ministry in that man why jesus christ
[1:05:34] himself amen showing amen brother
[1:05:36] brahman said you know that's not me i
[1:05:38] can't do that
[1:05:40] that has to be him he said my whole
[1:05:41] ministry is to declare that he's here
[1:05:43] amen you didn't touch me you didn't
[1:05:45] touch the hem of my garment you touched
[1:05:47] his garment what's he trying to do he's
[1:05:49] trying to show you that he's here that
[1:05:51] it's really him amen it's him he's here
[1:05:54] he's present he's in this vessel but
[1:05:56] it's jesus christ
[1:06:00] what did he come for so you could say
[1:06:02] that was jesus christ and that man his
[1:06:04] whole purpose was unite the head and the
[1:06:06] body together to bring the marriage to
[1:06:08] the bride
[1:06:09] that ministry was not so that we can
[1:06:12] play tapes and we could we can listen to
[1:06:14] testimonies and say wasn't that a great
[1:06:16] thing god did through brother branham
[1:06:19] wow to see a man so consecrated that god
[1:06:22] was working that wasn't the whole point
[1:06:25] friends the point was so that you would
[1:06:27] recognize your day and hour so that he
[1:06:29] would wake you up out of your
[1:06:30] denominational sleep so that the the
[1:06:33] isaf would come in you could get the
[1:06:35] wedding garment that ministry was here
[1:06:37] to unite the headship and the body back
[1:06:39] together the whole purpose of the end
[1:06:41] time message is you married to christ to
[1:06:44] receive the headship
[1:06:47] which is what the restored word
[1:06:51] which is who
[1:06:52] christ
[1:06:54] which is what the revelation of god
[1:06:58] it's all
[1:06:59] god
[1:07:03] and that in that day the son of man
[1:07:06] will be revealed
[1:07:07] what to join the church to the head
[1:07:10] unite the marriage of the bride
[1:07:12] the bridegroom call will come right
[1:07:14] through this
[1:07:16] when the son of man will come down and
[1:07:19] come in human flesh
[1:07:22] to unite the two together
[1:07:25] what human flesh did he come down into
[1:07:27] to unite the headship to the body he
[1:07:30] came in the flesh of that prophet
[1:07:31] william branham that was god in that man
[1:07:35] but what was the purpose not to say put
[1:07:37] him up on a pedestal and say whoa that
[1:07:39] was god and that man he came to unite
[1:07:41] you with the headship amen
[1:07:43] he come to unite you with christ he come
[1:07:45] to the god through him was going to
[1:07:48] reveal the mystery of the entire bible
[1:07:50] take the seals off open our eyes amen so
[1:07:52] that we would recognize who we are who
[1:07:54] he is what our purpose is and by that
[1:07:57] receive the headship and be united back
[1:07:59] together in a marriage union in an
[1:08:00] invisible union with jesus christ
[1:08:02] himself
[1:08:04] that was the purpose
[1:08:06] that's why
[1:08:08] what was it it was the ministry of jesus
[1:08:10] christ himself in human flesh
[1:08:13] now listen brother branham had to deal
[1:08:15] with an issue in brew serpent
[1:08:17] and that issue was they were baptizing
[1:08:20] in his name and calling him christ
[1:08:22] believing that he himself his flesh body
[1:08:25] the man that was born a woman was jesus
[1:08:27] christ
[1:08:29] but he himself wasn't jesus christ it
[1:08:31] was jesus christ in full expression
[1:08:34] inside that vessel
[1:08:38] right
[1:08:39] now that's why in dawson riley's
[1:08:41] testimony dawson said brother venom told
[1:08:43] him you know they're baptizing in my
[1:08:44] name and and dawson said he says he goes
[1:08:47] i just thought
[1:08:49] you know
[1:08:50] wow
[1:08:50] and brother branham said they're not as
[1:08:52] far off as you think
[1:08:56] and then i think dawson made the comment
[1:08:57] like wow i thought they was pretty far
[1:08:59] off
[1:09:03] so the ones who believed that brother
[1:09:06] branham was god
[1:09:07] and was jesus christ
[1:09:11] and were baptizing in his name
[1:09:13] i'm going to make a shocking statement
[1:09:15] but don't be offended
[1:09:18] they may have been closer than the ones
[1:09:20] that were offended by them doing them
[1:09:24] they may have been closer to the truth
[1:09:27] than the ones that were appalled by them
[1:09:29] doing that
[1:09:33] because it was ace on a man revealing
[1:09:35] the son of man
[1:09:37] it was the ministry of jesus christ
[1:09:39] himself working through that fallen
[1:09:41] flesh that had been redeemed it wasn't
[1:09:43] the flesh it was god in the flesh
[1:09:46] brother branham says it's like a razor's
[1:09:48] blade between truth and a lie
[1:09:52] because we don't want to be a part of a
[1:09:53] lie sometimes we want to stay way way
[1:09:55] away no he says it's a razor blade
[1:09:57] difference between truth and life if you
[1:09:59] want the truth you've got to get close
[1:10:01] to the lie
[1:10:06] the lie was that that man himself was
[1:10:08] jesus christ the truth was that that was
[1:10:11] jesus christ in that man
[1:10:14] to get the truth you've got to get a
[1:10:16] razor's width away from the lie
[1:10:19] that's why only the elect is going to
[1:10:20] make it through this message
[1:10:22] [Music]
[1:10:24] the truth is so shocking
[1:10:27] it's so
[1:10:28] remarkable it's so marvelous
[1:10:31] that it takes your breath away
[1:10:34] that it seems unbelievable that
[1:10:35] something in you believes it
[1:10:38] only the elect can go down this road
[1:10:40] only the elect can bring believe the
[1:10:42] truth the full truth and stay in the
[1:10:44] full truth without taking the half step
[1:10:46] over to fanaticism into a lie
[1:10:49] and the bride will not move herself so
[1:10:51] far away from fanaticism and a lie that
[1:10:53] she no longer believes the truth
[1:10:56] but she's the only one that can walk on
[1:10:58] this edge of this razor blade
[1:11:02] why by revelation not by education not
[1:11:05] my natural ears but by revelation she's
[1:11:07] going to catch what this is
[1:11:10] when the son of man will come down and
[1:11:13] come in human flesh to unite the two
[1:11:15] together
[1:11:16] the church has to be the word he is the
[1:11:18] word and the two unites together and to
[1:11:21] do that it will take the manifestation
[1:11:24] of the revealing of the son of man not a
[1:11:26] clergyman oh do you see brother venom's
[1:11:29] wanting you to see it's in order to
[1:11:32] unite you the word the bride word the
[1:11:34] bridegroom word has to get united
[1:11:36] together in order to unite that it is
[1:11:38] going to take the manifestation of the
[1:11:41] revealing of the son of man it takes
[1:11:43] this prophetic ministry at the end time
[1:11:44] to unite you to the headship
[1:11:47] it takes the the prince zerubbabel to
[1:11:50] bring down the headstone with shoutings
[1:11:51] of grace grace unto it amen so that you
[1:11:54] can recognize the grace in this hour and
[1:11:56] be united to the headship
[1:11:59] it takes the revealing of the son of man
[1:12:03] now let's go further in the same quote
[1:12:06] what i mean see it's son of man jesus
[1:12:09] christ will come down in human flesh
[1:12:11] among us i hope you got that by now
[1:12:15] jesus christ will come down in human
[1:12:17] flesh among us
[1:12:21] and will make his word so real
[1:12:24] that it'll unite the church and him as
[1:12:26] one the bride
[1:12:28] and then she'll go home to the wedding
[1:12:29] supper amen she's already united see we
[1:12:32] go to the wedding supper not the
[1:12:34] marriage then he goes to quote part of a
[1:12:36] scripture fill your flesh yourself of
[1:12:38] all the flesh of the mighty men because
[1:12:39] the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:12:42] but the rapture is going to the wedding
[1:12:43] somewhere when the word here unites with
[1:12:46] the person and they too become one and
[1:12:49] then what does it do then it manifests
[1:12:52] the son of man again
[1:12:56] again
[1:12:58] not the church theologians the son of
[1:13:00] man the word and the church becomes one
[1:13:04] whatever the son done he was the word
[1:13:06] the church does the same thing
[1:13:09] so now we know it takes the
[1:13:10] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:13:12] son of man when jesus christ himself
[1:13:14] comes down into flesh to manifest
[1:13:16] himself and it'll take that to unite the
[1:13:19] bride to the the body to the head but
[1:13:22] after that
[1:13:24] what does it do that for what happens
[1:13:26] next
[1:13:31] when the word here
[1:13:33] unites with the person
[1:13:35] that's you
[1:13:38] and they too become one that's the
[1:13:40] invisible union
[1:13:42] and then what does it do then it
[1:13:44] manifest the son of man again
[1:13:48] it didn't stop with brother branham all
[1:13:51] that god was he poured into christ all
[1:13:52] that christ was he poured into the bride
[1:13:54] to his church amen god jesus christ was
[1:13:57] here amen in that son of man revealing
[1:14:01] himself the son of man it was the jesus
[1:14:04] christ himself in flesh
[1:14:06] [Music]
[1:14:08] the flesh of brother branham
[1:14:11] manifesting declaring the revelation of
[1:14:13] the son of man to unite the head and the
[1:14:16] body together to do what to manifest the
[1:14:18] son of man again he didn't go back to
[1:14:20] being son of god
[1:14:23] this when brother brenham left the scene
[1:14:24] he did not go back amen to being what he
[1:14:27] was in the church ages amen they kicked
[1:14:29] him out as son of god amen now he comes
[1:14:31] the son of man when brother branham
[1:14:33] leaves the son of man doesn't leave amen
[1:14:35] when he leaves it doesn't go back to
[1:14:36] being son of god brother bam told us
[1:14:38] it's son of god son of man son of david
[1:14:44] he doesn't go back to being son of god
[1:14:45] what it was in the church ages what that
[1:14:48] was in brother branham is now in
[1:14:50] fullness in the bride it's the ministry
[1:14:52] of jesus christ himself in a flesh body
[1:14:56] on this earth but it's a many membered
[1:14:58] body now
[1:15:00] brother branham was the wave sheath that
[1:15:01] was plugged up and showed this is it
[1:15:04] this is it this is it and god when he
[1:15:07] finished that ministry to unite the two
[1:15:09] he says now he must increase and i must
[1:15:11] decrease
[1:15:13] how is he increasing he's increasing in
[1:15:16] the mini-membered bride the wave she
[1:15:18] showed what was coming to the crop now
[1:15:20] it's got to mature in the crop and now
[1:15:22] that son of man is in you and i yeah
[1:15:26] what is this we're talking about the
[1:15:28] revelation of jesus christ the book of
[1:15:30] revelations
[1:15:33] that was sealed with seven seals
[1:15:36] and when that opened it opened the
[1:15:37] entire bible
[1:15:41] it didn't just open the church ages
[1:15:43] it opened the entire bible
[1:15:48] christ is revealed in his own word
[1:15:52] for jesus himself
[1:15:53] is the interpretation of the bible
[1:15:56] when he may when he's made manifest in
[1:15:58] the age that that part of his body is
[1:16:00] being made manifest
[1:16:02] if it's a hand age it must be a hand it
[1:16:04] can't be a head age
[1:16:06] if it's a voice age well then it can't
[1:16:08] be a foot age
[1:16:10] see now we're at the i age
[1:16:13] and the next is him himself
[1:16:16] to come
[1:16:18] seeing prophetic
[1:16:19] brother i'm saying we're now at the ih
[1:16:21] why he said seeing prophetic we're at
[1:16:23] the we're at malachi 4.
[1:16:26] we're at the prophet we're at the seeing
[1:16:30] but he said there's something to come
[1:16:31] next
[1:16:33] after the prophet's ministry there's
[1:16:35] something to come next
[1:16:37] see down through the age we started off
[1:16:39] from the foundation from the first
[1:16:41] church age when the seed went in the
[1:16:42] ground the complete seed then it come
[1:16:44] out through the feet luther come back
[1:16:46] out through wesley then the pentecostals
[1:16:48] the tongues and the lips see now it's in
[1:16:50] the eyes prophetic malachi 4.
[1:16:54] is there any question
[1:16:56] he's got a bill he's got the body built
[1:16:58] all the way up to the eyes amen malachi
[1:17:00] 4 amen the ministry of the prophet
[1:17:03] and so
[1:17:05] and so forth and now there's nothing
[1:17:07] else left for it to come but him himself
[1:17:11] to step into that
[1:17:14] to what the body that's being formed
[1:17:17] over seven church ages it's formed
[1:17:19] through the legs to the thighs through
[1:17:20] the arms to the head through the mouth
[1:17:22] pentecostal speaking in tongues to the
[1:17:24] eyes amen the prophet restoring the word
[1:17:26] but there's nothing left now but for the
[1:17:29] mind he himself the headship the person
[1:17:32] of jesus christ himself to step into
[1:17:34] that to what the body
[1:17:38] after what after the seeing
[1:17:43] now there's nothing else left for it to
[1:17:45] come
[1:17:46] but him himself to step into that
[1:17:48] because that's the last thing there is
[1:17:51] the next is the intelligence
[1:17:53] what is the intelligence
[1:17:55] the thought of god
[1:17:57] the mind of christ
[1:17:59] the word that has been restored in this
[1:18:01] hour
[1:18:03] we have no sight of our own
[1:18:05] a man
[1:18:07] how can a man foresee these things he
[1:18:09] can't do it it's god himself it's
[1:18:10] becoming to a place and he's governed
[1:18:13] the body all the way through then the
[1:18:15] complete body of christ is revealed in
[1:18:17] the form of a bride that was taken out
[1:18:20] of his side like adam did at the
[1:18:22] beginning like adams was rather at the
[1:18:24] beginning so now he brings us all the
[1:18:27] way down through amen we've gone through
[1:18:29] the old testament come through the new
[1:18:30] testament got to the end of the church
[1:18:32] ages now at the opening of the seals
[1:18:34] amen it's a son of man revealing the son
[1:18:36] of man christ himself is the one who
[1:18:38] opens those seals and reveals how he's
[1:18:41] been redeeming where he's been what he's
[1:18:43] been doing for the last two thousand
[1:18:45] years
[1:18:47] and now he's stepping into that body
[1:18:50] that bride at the end time that's on the
[1:18:53] earth at the end time
[1:18:54] now he's stepping down the intelligence
[1:18:58] the headship
[1:18:59] he himself
[1:19:01] the full revelation is coming down to
[1:19:03] that body
[1:19:05] and it's to reveal the son of man again
[1:19:10] now the complete
[1:19:12] body of christ
[1:19:15] is revealed in the form of a bride
[1:19:19] the complete body of christ
[1:19:22] is revealed in the form of a bride
[1:19:24] this is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:19:27] it can't be complete
[1:19:30] until you have a revelation of the bride
[1:19:34] it can't be finished until you have the
[1:19:37] bride formed into the image of christ
[1:19:40] it can't be complete without the bride
[1:19:45] genesis chapter 2 verse 18 he says and
[1:19:48] the lord god said it is not good that
[1:19:51] man
[1:19:52] should be alone
[1:19:54] i will make him a helpmeet for him and
[1:19:55] out of the ground the lord god formed
[1:19:57] every beast of the field every fowl of
[1:20:00] the air and brought them unto adam to
[1:20:02] see what he would call them and
[1:20:04] whatsoever adam called every creature
[1:20:06] that was the name thereof and adam gave
[1:20:08] names to all cattle and to the foul of
[1:20:10] the air and to every beast of the field
[1:20:11] but for adam
[1:20:13] but for adam there was not found to help
[1:20:15] me for him and the lord god caused a
[1:20:17] deep sleep to fall upon adam and he
[1:20:19] slept and he took one of his ribs and
[1:20:21] closed up the flesh instead thereof and
[1:20:23] the rib which the lord god had taken
[1:20:25] from man made he a woman and brought her
[1:20:27] unto the man
[1:20:30] this is one of the most profound
[1:20:31] scriptures in all of the bible
[1:20:34] because it will be the description of
[1:20:36] the rest of the bible
[1:20:39] brother brahm says that's what the
[1:20:41] church is doing for jesus is the word
[1:20:43] and he's the bridegroom
[1:20:45] and the bride is a part of the
[1:20:47] bridegroom
[1:20:48] what was the bride in eden a part of the
[1:20:50] bridegroom in eden
[1:20:53] therefore the word that is to be
[1:20:55] fulfilled this day is the same part of
[1:20:57] the word that was fulfilled in his day
[1:20:59] and it's the same word same experience
[1:21:02] same life
[1:21:03] and when god separated adam he was both
[1:21:06] we find out adam was spirit to begin
[1:21:08] with he made man in his own image
[1:21:10] created him male and female and in
[1:21:12] genesis 2 and and on he created man out
[1:21:14] of the dust of the earth man was created
[1:21:17] in god's image
[1:21:18] god is a spirit so he's a spirit man
[1:21:22] then when he's become flesh man animal
[1:21:23] flesh on the earth he is showing or
[1:21:26] portraying hear the bride
[1:21:28] so go back to genesis chapter 2 what is
[1:21:31] god showing in genesis chapter 2 he's
[1:21:33] showing the book
[1:21:36] he's showing the plan
[1:21:38] he's showing the bride
[1:21:41] he never taken and made another being
[1:21:44] but he took part of adam
[1:21:47] the original creation
[1:21:49] took from him a rib from his side and
[1:21:52] took the feminist spirit out of adam
[1:21:53] left the masculine spirit in there and
[1:21:55] placed it in the feminist part therefore
[1:21:57] part of his spirit part of his body
[1:22:00] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word
[1:22:03] of his word life of his life and that's
[1:22:05] the way the bride is to christ
[1:22:09] he says all the old testament was types
[1:22:12] that pointed to christ in his church
[1:22:14] you believe adam and eve pointed to
[1:22:16] christ in his church
[1:22:18] you believe jehovah and his wife pointed
[1:22:19] to christ in his church well them are
[1:22:22] types and this is the anti-time it has
[1:22:24] to be like the type because the type
[1:22:26] takes from the anti-type takes from the
[1:22:28] type christ is the head the true stone
[1:22:30] of god you believe that
[1:22:32] the true word the bride is the body
[1:22:36] let me go to genesis 2 a little further
[1:22:38] down in verse 23 and adam said this is
[1:22:41] now bone of my bones flesh of my flesh
[1:22:45] adam did not look at this other creature
[1:22:48] and say what are you who are you
[1:22:50] introduce yourself to me where did you
[1:22:52] come from he says
[1:22:54] you are me
[1:22:58] this is what this is what adam is saying
[1:23:01] he's saying you or me
[1:23:03] i am you
[1:23:05] we are one
[1:23:07] adam said this is now bone of my bones
[1:23:09] flesh and my flesh she shall be called
[1:23:10] woman because she was taken out of man
[1:23:13] therefore shall a man leave his father
[1:23:14] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[1:23:16] wife and they shall be one flesh amen
[1:23:20] what is god doing all the way back in
[1:23:22] the beginning of the bible amen he he is
[1:23:25] creating and he's forming and fashioning
[1:23:28] the world and putting it in a certain
[1:23:29] order by a spoken word and the spoken
[1:23:32] word is ordering something he's making
[1:23:34] something you can tell that he's doing
[1:23:36] something with creation he's ordering it
[1:23:39] and fashioning it and placing it and
[1:23:40] getting it all regimented and all
[1:23:42] ordered and all outlined
[1:23:46] and after he does that amen
[1:23:49] he he says let us bring forth a man in
[1:23:52] our image in our likeness male and
[1:23:55] female amen so now god is going to
[1:23:58] create a man in his likeness but from
[1:24:00] the very beginning he calls it male and
[1:24:02] female
[1:24:04] male and female male and female what is
[1:24:07] this god wants to be expressed in male
[1:24:09] and female
[1:24:12] from the very beginning so god takes the
[1:24:14] man
[1:24:15] what is the man he's the reflection or
[1:24:18] the expression of god
[1:24:20] adam on earth was the reflection of god
[1:24:23] his father
[1:24:24] he's a type of christ he's on earth he's
[1:24:27] ruling and reigning upon the creation of
[1:24:30] god god made a perfect setting and he
[1:24:32] placed him in the setting amen but god
[1:24:35] was not finished with his great work
[1:24:37] amen because he's not completed yet i've
[1:24:39] talked about this before you can tell
[1:24:41] that god's not done because god doesn't
[1:24:43] go to his rest yet he's still finishing
[1:24:46] the task at hand and the task at hand
[1:24:49] was to create a masterpiece
[1:24:52] and when he finished the first part of
[1:24:54] that masterpiece it was a perfect man
[1:24:56] and then that perfect man was a
[1:24:57] reflection of god amen but the
[1:24:59] expression of god was not completed yet
[1:25:03] he wasn't finished in his masterpiece
[1:25:05] work because the man was alone and he
[1:25:08] said it's not good that the man should
[1:25:09] dwell alone whether it was god who made
[1:25:12] him there alone
[1:25:14] how could it not be good the only reason
[1:25:16] he said it's not good so that you and i
[1:25:18] will understand god was not finished
[1:25:20] this was not his period on his creation
[1:25:22] this was not his period on his
[1:25:24] masterpiece he had something else he
[1:25:26] wanted to express in the beginning
[1:25:29] so he struck a little blow brother
[1:25:31] branham said to his left side
[1:25:34] pulled out a rib a part of himself and
[1:25:36] out of that part of himself he fashioned
[1:25:39] another atom
[1:25:46] do you believe that
[1:25:49] he didn't make something different
[1:25:51] that's why he had to take from adam he
[1:25:54] took from adam and he refashioned this
[1:25:57] portion of adam amen into another vessel
[1:26:00] but it wasn't something different it was
[1:26:03] still adam
[1:26:06] but now god was expressed in man male
[1:26:11] and female
[1:26:14] and god brought the two together
[1:26:17] brother man said the first marriage that
[1:26:19] was ever performed was performed in the
[1:26:20] garden of eden
[1:26:23] and adam said
[1:26:25] they are now
[1:26:26] one flesh
[1:26:28] one
[1:26:30] flesh
[1:26:32] the male form of adam
[1:26:34] was adam's flesh
[1:26:36] the female form of adam
[1:26:38] was adam's flesh
[1:26:42] god was not finished making adam
[1:26:45] until he put him to sleep and pulled out
[1:26:48] a part of adam and fashion it to another
[1:26:50] vessel and put the two back together
[1:26:53] then he was finished making adam
[1:26:57] then he put them in rulership upon his
[1:27:00] earth in the garden ruling from the
[1:27:02] garden ruling creation
[1:27:04] and then he took his rest
[1:27:07] he was done
[1:27:08] this is what i had in my mind
[1:27:11] amen
[1:27:16] we know the serpent slipped in
[1:27:19] created a fall
[1:27:20] we know the fall works to god's plan
[1:27:23] to reveal all of his attributes
[1:27:26] but god's plan was not going to be
[1:27:27] defeated this brother branham tells us
[1:27:30] that as masterpiece fell
[1:27:33] the great image the great statue the
[1:27:35] great work of our it fell
[1:27:37] he said but he wasn't going to leave it
[1:27:40] in ruin he started right away making it
[1:27:43] over again
[1:27:46] i'd like to present to you that that's
[1:27:48] what this is
[1:27:51] your bible is the record of him
[1:27:53] rebuilding that masterpiece
[1:27:56] and that masterpiece is jesus christ
[1:28:01] male and female
[1:28:03] the son of god
[1:28:04] male and female
[1:28:08] this is a book of redemption
[1:28:10] redeeming what redeeming the original
[1:28:13] masterpiece
[1:28:14] that fell he went right to work
[1:28:17] immediately and started building it back
[1:28:20] and he worked in the old testament to
[1:28:22] build back the last atom
[1:28:24] the final the last atom
[1:28:27] then he struck a little blow to his left
[1:28:29] side
[1:28:30] and pulled out the elements he needed to
[1:28:32] build his bride
[1:28:34] and for 2 000 years he's been building
[1:28:37] the bride but at the end there's going
[1:28:39] to be a wedding like there was in eden
[1:28:41] like the first marriage that ever was
[1:28:42] performed now there's been a son of man
[1:28:44] on earth to do what to unite the
[1:28:45] headship and the body together the
[1:28:47] marriage of the bride
[1:28:49] and now they've been united back
[1:28:51] together again what is this bible all
[1:28:53] about it's all about jesus christ the
[1:28:56] mystery of god revealed jesus christ
[1:28:59] male and female because the mystery of
[1:29:01] god is god always wanted to dwell as a
[1:29:04] family upon the earth
[1:29:06] he wanted to materialize he wanted to
[1:29:08] become tangible he wanted to come down
[1:29:10] to the earth he was going to do it
[1:29:12] through eden and there was going to be
[1:29:13] offspring there was going to be more
[1:29:15] that came forth he said all the elements
[1:29:16] were laying here but it fell into ruin
[1:29:18] but that didn't stop his plan he kept
[1:29:20] working right on and he started working
[1:29:22] a plan of redemption and at the end he
[1:29:25] will have what he originally started
[1:29:27] with there's going to be a perfection on
[1:29:29] this earth again and his sons and
[1:29:30] daughters his attributes portions of
[1:29:33] himself that have been come down
[1:29:34] materialized are going to be upon this
[1:29:37] earth and he will be fellowshipping with
[1:29:38] his family
[1:29:41] that is the mystery of god
[1:29:44] and jesus christ is the mystery of god
[1:29:46] revealed
[1:29:48] that's why this entire bible is christ
[1:29:52] it's the rebuilding of the masterpiece
[1:29:56] let's go a little further
[1:29:59] he said now i'm choosing of a bride the
[1:30:01] other is pregnanted by the word of god
[1:30:03] and will bring forth the body the
[1:30:06] finished body of jesus christ which is
[1:30:08] the bride the body of christ isn't
[1:30:11] finished yet
[1:30:13] how many knows that a man and the woman
[1:30:15] is one and christ is one body the word
[1:30:17] the bride will have to be the rest of
[1:30:20] that body
[1:30:21] and the two together makes the one body
[1:30:23] again like adam was at the beginning man
[1:30:25] and his wife are one now she the true
[1:30:28] bride so sold out to him that she used
[1:30:30] no mind of her own his mind of course is
[1:30:33] his will and his will is his word
[1:30:38] christ is one body
[1:30:40] the word
[1:30:41] so what is the bride the word what word
[1:30:44] the part of the word to be made manifest
[1:30:46] today which is christ
[1:30:49] in the formation
[1:30:51] of a bride
[1:30:52] in the end time they're to be united
[1:30:55] again
[1:30:58] she has to be molded and made into the
[1:31:00] image of christ and christ is the word
[1:31:02] that's the only thing see
[1:31:04] it's in there the word there cannot be
[1:31:06] one thing added cannot be a woman with
[1:31:08] one hand like a man the other hand like
[1:31:11] a paul like a dog it's got to be exactly
[1:31:13] the word of the lord like he is the word
[1:31:15] the bride is a part of the bridegroom
[1:31:17] the woman is a part of her husband
[1:31:18] because she's taken out of the husband
[1:31:20] eve was a part of adam from his side and
[1:31:24] so is the bride not taking from a
[1:31:26] denomination but taken from the bosom of
[1:31:29] the word of god for this day
[1:31:31] what was she pulled out of she was
[1:31:33] pulled out of the word for this day not
[1:31:35] taken out of a denomination god didn't
[1:31:37] pluck you out of a denomination he
[1:31:39] pulled you out of himself
[1:31:41] the word for this day
[1:31:45] now for nearly 2 000 years
[1:31:47] god has been again making him a
[1:31:49] masterpiece
[1:31:50] because he struck adam to get a piece of
[1:31:52] him part of him a rib to make a wife for
[1:31:55] him and now that perfect masterpiece
[1:31:57] that he struck at calvary he got a piece
[1:31:59] off of him it's just the new testament
[1:32:02] that's all
[1:32:04] he fulfilled the old testament now it's
[1:32:06] the new testament another piece to be
[1:32:09] fulfilled
[1:32:10] see the new and old is husband and wife
[1:32:14] and it taken the new the old to
[1:32:16] foreshadow the new christ come the
[1:32:18] masterpiece to fulfill
[1:32:20] that now his bride will fulfill
[1:32:22] everything that's in the new testament
[1:32:25] another masterpiece in the making
[1:32:29] so what is the bible
[1:32:32] it's christ
[1:32:34] what is christ
[1:32:35] the mystery of god
[1:32:38] what is the mystery of god that god
[1:32:40] wanted to materialize on this earth
[1:32:42] he wanted to become tangible
[1:32:45] and crowded he did it he did it through
[1:32:46] christ what is christ the word made
[1:32:49] manifest
[1:32:51] his attributes coming into manifestation
[1:32:54] is god making himself tangible upon the
[1:32:57] earth
[1:33:00] this bible the old testament
[1:33:03] is groom
[1:33:06] the new testament is bride
[1:33:09] he come forth to restore the first part
[1:33:12] of the masterpiece in jesus christ and
[1:33:14] he was the perfect son of god
[1:33:16] redeeming back all that adam lost
[1:33:19] but the picture wasn't perfect yet we
[1:33:21] can't go to the millennium which is rest
[1:33:24] because god couldn't go to rest until he
[1:33:26] finished the work that he was initially
[1:33:28] doing
[1:33:29] until he finished the masterpiece
[1:33:32] we could not go to millennium after
[1:33:34] calvary
[1:33:36] i understand
[1:33:38] he paid the price but we could not go to
[1:33:40] millennium after calvary until he
[1:33:42] brought forth the bride and after he
[1:33:44] brought forth the bride and united them
[1:33:45] together now we can go to millennium
[1:33:48] which is the restoration to eden
[1:33:50] you can't do it till the bride's been
[1:33:52] restored until the marriage has come
[1:33:54] together
[1:33:58] and as he being the groom
[1:34:01] the bride has to come forth because it's
[1:34:02] part of him and it can only be the
[1:34:05] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[1:34:07] the revelations and others has spoke of
[1:34:09] the bride it can only manifest if it
[1:34:11] does something different from the groom
[1:34:13] it isn't the bride because she is flesh
[1:34:15] of his flesh bone of his bone life of
[1:34:18] his life power of his power she is him
[1:34:24] that may sound strange to your friends
[1:34:25] it shouldn't by now we've preached it so
[1:34:27] many times but she is him the same way
[1:34:30] the woman was him in the garden
[1:34:33] when you look at when when you look at
[1:34:35] at eve she didn't have the name eve she
[1:34:37] was not eve she was woman her name was
[1:34:40] adam
[1:34:42] he made them and called their name adam
[1:34:44] they were adam male adam female they
[1:34:46] were the same they were one they were
[1:34:48] united they
[1:34:49] she came out of him she was part of him
[1:34:52] she was not ever to have her own
[1:34:54] identity when she took her own identity
[1:34:56] by taking adultery by taking another
[1:34:59] thought amen and manifesting that wrong
[1:35:01] thought she got a name then eve is the
[1:35:03] name of adultery
[1:35:06] because it's the mother of all living
[1:35:07] how did she become the mother of all
[1:35:08] living by adultery by leaving the word
[1:35:11] her name was adam amen this bride's name
[1:35:15] is jesus christ amen it is christ in
[1:35:17] bright form amen not something different
[1:35:20] a further expression of the same one the
[1:35:22] same person that's why the book of
[1:35:24] revelation is the revelation of jesus
[1:35:27] christ and immediately you see him
[1:35:29] standing in the midst of seven
[1:35:30] candlesticks
[1:35:32] this is not bridegroom form anymore now
[1:35:34] this is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:35:36] in bride form
[1:35:39] and she is him
[1:35:42] she's his word she's part of the word
[1:35:45] part of the mystery what god wanted to
[1:35:47] express before the foundation of the
[1:35:49] world is now being expressed in her and
[1:35:52] she is him he's the word she has to be
[1:35:55] the word
[1:35:58] and the word is coming to the word to
[1:36:00] finish the masterpiece
[1:36:03] so that now we can go to the millennium
[1:36:06] so that god see
[1:36:08] god he he molded and made for six
[1:36:12] thousand years until he finally got a
[1:36:13] man and his wife that he could put in
[1:36:15] charge of the whole creation
[1:36:17] and then he went and took his rest and
[1:36:18] while he was resting brother and said
[1:36:20] his rest was interrupted
[1:36:24] that means there's something in the
[1:36:26] program of god that's unfulfilled
[1:36:29] and what's unfulfilled is god's
[1:36:31] thousand-year rest
[1:36:35] that's why at the restoration of the
[1:36:38] bride uniting with christ amen there's
[1:36:40] going to be a finishing of redemption
[1:36:42] and christ the earth is going to burn
[1:36:44] and christ is going to come back to set
[1:36:46] on the throne of his father david and
[1:36:48] his bride will rule and reign with him
[1:36:49] for a thousand years amen what's he
[1:36:51] going to do just like in the garden of
[1:36:53] eden when he got a son and his son's
[1:36:55] wife and he put him in charge of it all
[1:36:57] he took his rest now he's building back
[1:36:59] another son and his son's wife to put
[1:37:01] him back in charge in the millennium so
[1:37:04] he can take his rest because that's an
[1:37:05] uncompleted part of the plan of god
[1:37:08] and there'll be no part of the plan of
[1:37:10] god uncompleted he will have his seventh
[1:37:13] day amen
[1:37:15] he will have his rest why how when he
[1:37:18] puts a son
[1:37:19] and his son's wife over the creation
[1:37:21] again
[1:37:25] praise be to god
[1:37:27] the revelation of jesus christ in this
[1:37:29] hour not what he was in another hour
[1:37:32] what he is now the bible expresses it's
[1:37:34] growing in the bride to the full stature
[1:37:37] therefore the corn of wheat of christ
[1:37:40] had to fall in the ground and and so did
[1:37:42] the bride have to fall in the ground
[1:37:43] through the dark ages and any grain that
[1:37:45] goes in the ground must die or it can't
[1:37:47] produce itself produce itself and the
[1:37:49] great church that he established on the
[1:37:51] day of pentecost by the sending of the
[1:37:53] holy ghost had to suffer martyrdom and
[1:37:55] go into the dirt and into the earth in
[1:37:57] the dark age to bring forth again the
[1:37:59] age of luther
[1:38:01] and come on out to the full stature of
[1:38:05] the bride of jesus christ for this last
[1:38:07] day
[1:38:08] that is the manifestation of this hour
[1:38:14] oh god if the world could only see that
[1:38:18] that god and man are one
[1:38:20] the super sign was that first man that
[1:38:23] god could come into
[1:38:24] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:38:27] that was the super sign
[1:38:30] and all that christ was he poured into
[1:38:32] the church
[1:38:33] super sign
[1:38:35] god and man together
[1:38:37] that was to be the super sign of the
[1:38:39] last day
[1:38:40] when the entire bible was to be
[1:38:42] fulfilled in the last day
[1:38:47] what is the entire bible
[1:38:49] what will be the fulfilling of the time
[1:38:50] bible
[1:38:52] when you have
[1:38:53] the full
[1:38:55] restoration
[1:38:56] of the bridegroom
[1:38:59] and the full restoration of the bride
[1:39:02] and you unite those two things back
[1:39:04] together
[1:39:05] that's the expression of the entire
[1:39:08] bible
[1:39:09] that is why when he opened these seals
[1:39:13] it opened up the entire bible
[1:39:15] because there's a mystery in the entire
[1:39:17] bible and that mystery is god
[1:39:19] wanted to be expressed in jesus christ
[1:39:23] and christ is male and female he showed
[1:39:26] it in eden it fell and he's been
[1:39:28] rebuilding it all the way back and you
[1:39:31] and i are part of the last part of that
[1:39:33] rebuilding to be the bride manifest in
[1:39:37] full measure in this day upon the earth
[1:39:39] jesus christ and you and i the son of
[1:39:42] man ministry
[1:39:47] that is the reality of where we are
[1:39:50] that is why opening seals unlocked the
[1:39:53] entire bible because the entire bible is
[1:39:56] the restoration back to eden
[1:39:58] and if you don't unlock the mystery of
[1:40:00] the bride you haven't unlocked the
[1:40:02] entire bible
[1:40:04] when you look and see christ as the
[1:40:06] redeemer you can look down through the
[1:40:07] bible and you can see him coming as
[1:40:09] moses
[1:40:10] the redeemer to deliver you could see
[1:40:12] him coming as joseph rejected of his
[1:40:15] brothers and cast into a pit ascended on
[1:40:17] the right hand of power to save his
[1:40:18] brother you can see him as joshua amen
[1:40:21] you could see him as david amen cast out
[1:40:23] and run amen from cave decay finally
[1:40:26] coming into power you can see christ
[1:40:28] christ christ christ christ but at the
[1:40:29] revealing of the seven seals you can go
[1:40:32] right back to that same old testament
[1:40:34] said moses had a gentile wife
[1:40:36] joseph had a gentile wife that he
[1:40:38] dismissed to the palace before he
[1:40:39] revealed himself to his brothers amen
[1:40:42] you can go back now and say abraham was
[1:40:44] the type of christ amen and abraham and
[1:40:46] sarah brought forth the promised son but
[1:40:47] if you look a little deeper you're going
[1:40:49] to say there was something special about
[1:40:50] sarah too because after sarah got a
[1:40:52] visitation from the god from god and
[1:40:54] after she conceived and brought forth
[1:40:57] the promised sign now the word was in
[1:40:59] her
[1:41:01] because she looks at abraham and she
[1:41:04] says
[1:41:05] cast out the bondwoman and her son for
[1:41:08] the the child of the bondwoman shall not
[1:41:10] be heir amen with my son and he said wow
[1:41:13] and abraham didn't know what to do about
[1:41:16] that
[1:41:16] so he goes to the lord and the lord says
[1:41:18] hearken to the voice of thy wife
[1:41:20] for what she says is right
[1:41:23] and then you go to the new testament to
[1:41:25] the book of galatians and the apostle
[1:41:26] paul picks it up and says doth not
[1:41:29] scripture say
[1:41:31] doth not scripture say
[1:41:34] doth not scripture say cast out the
[1:41:36] bondwoman and her son who said the
[1:41:39] scripture sarah amen sarah the woman
[1:41:43] after amen after she received the word
[1:41:46] after the visitation on the plains of
[1:41:48] mamrie after god unfleshed the son of
[1:41:50] man after she turned back young after
[1:41:52] she conceived c after she brought forth
[1:41:55] the word then she had the word the word
[1:41:57] was in her
[1:42:00] abraham didn't say she said
[1:42:04] and the apostle paul says doth not
[1:42:06] scripture
[1:42:07] say
[1:42:09] he could have just easily said did not
[1:42:12] god say through sarah
[1:42:17] what was that
[1:42:19] that was
[1:42:21] that was the secret
[1:42:23] not being fully revealed yet
[1:42:26] he was letting it out he was shadowing
[1:42:28] it every character in the bible has been
[1:42:31] showing this great mystery
[1:42:33] every character all the details it's
[1:42:36] been expressing but not letting it out
[1:42:38] in full holding it back to the end time
[1:42:41] until the seals can be peeled off
[1:42:44] and you can say
[1:42:45] oh my goodness
[1:42:47] look at esther
[1:42:49] look at ruth and boaz look at salmon and
[1:42:51] rahab look at the gentile wife the
[1:42:54] gentile wife the gentile wife and the
[1:42:55] lineage of christ i see it now amen when
[1:42:58] he took the seals off it unlocked the
[1:42:59] entire bible the entire bible was christ
[1:43:02] was going to be the very desire mystery
[1:43:05] thought of god was going to be expressed
[1:43:06] in jesus christ and jesus christ was
[1:43:08] going to be male and female amen and the
[1:43:10] female was going to be a mini-membered
[1:43:12] bride and he was going to have a bride
[1:43:14] of his own choosing that he took out of
[1:43:16] the gentiles a gentile bride so in the
[1:43:19] old testament he showed a gentile bride
[1:43:21] a gentile bride a gentile bride what was
[1:43:24] it they were expressing it but not
[1:43:25] revealing it holding it back expressing
[1:43:28] the mystery that's why he said the
[1:43:30] entire bible has been expressing this
[1:43:32] mystery
[1:43:34] and until he unlocked the seven seals
[1:43:36] which unlocked the new testament which
[1:43:38] opened up where christ has been for the
[1:43:40] last two thousand years where he's been
[1:43:43] in the midst of the church how he's
[1:43:44] coming back a son of man how he's
[1:43:46] uniting with the bride then we don't see
[1:43:49] the mystery of the whole bible when we
[1:43:51] don't see the mystery of the bride
[1:43:55] so when i was asking god
[1:43:57] i want to fully understand
[1:44:01] when he says when he unlocked those
[1:44:02] seven seals that unlocked the entire
[1:44:04] bible
[1:44:05] i was laying in bed praying god i want
[1:44:08] to understand it better i feel like i
[1:44:09] got some understanding i want to
[1:44:10] understand it better and all of a sudden
[1:44:12] all these scriptures and quotes start
[1:44:14] coming back
[1:44:15] friends
[1:44:16] unless the bride is
[1:44:18] manifest the mystery of god is not
[1:44:21] finished
[1:44:24] but when the bride is built back through
[1:44:26] seven church ages and at the end time
[1:44:28] she's united with the headship now
[1:44:30] expressing jesus christ in the formation
[1:44:33] of his bride that is finishing the
[1:44:36] mystery of god that's under the seventh
[1:44:38] seal that's under the opening of these
[1:44:41] seals
[1:44:42] and the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:44:44] angel the mystery
[1:44:46] of god should be finished
[1:44:49] where is it being finished
[1:44:51] it's being finished and you and i
[1:44:54] you are finishing the mystery of god
[1:44:58] that is a sobering
[1:45:01] that is one of those things that take
[1:45:03] your breath away cause you to step back
[1:45:05] and say what is this message
[1:45:09] i thought it was a gifted man it's more
[1:45:11] than a gifted man friends
[1:45:13] i thought it was a a restoration of all
[1:45:15] the truths that were lost through the
[1:45:17] through the church ages it's more than
[1:45:18] the restoration of truths friend
[1:45:22] it's the son of man the ministry of
[1:45:24] christ himself come back to unite the
[1:45:25] head and the body to finish the mystery
[1:45:28] of god
[1:45:30] that's why when you look at those seals
[1:45:32] you go back in those seals the first
[1:45:33] four are anointings horse riders that
[1:45:36] are antichrists four anointings of the
[1:45:38] holy ghost that are christ
[1:45:40] what's he doing building his church
[1:45:42] protecting them from the false
[1:45:44] two vines coming through what is it it's
[1:45:47] the church ages
[1:45:48] what's he doing he's walking in the
[1:45:50] midst of the church ages and these
[1:45:52] anointings are guiding his bride
[1:45:55] keeping them from the antichrist
[1:45:57] protecting them from the horse riders
[1:45:59] bringing them up truth by truth by truth
[1:46:01] by truth and to the restoration of the
[1:46:03] bride tree
[1:46:05] and in the fifth seal he shows how he
[1:46:08] saved how he is going to save have grace
[1:46:12] upon the jews amen that died from the
[1:46:14] time of christ on
[1:46:16] that's the last two thousand years
[1:46:18] that's not all the jews that's not six
[1:46:20] thousand years from the time of christ
[1:46:22] on what is this it's unlocking the new
[1:46:24] testament and how he had to blind them
[1:46:27] to take the gentile bride because he
[1:46:29] blinded him for a gentile bride he'll
[1:46:30] give them white robes at the white
[1:46:31] throne judgment as an act of grace
[1:46:33] because he had to blind them to get a
[1:46:34] gentile bride what's the seals about the
[1:46:36] bride
[1:46:38] what's their what's their white robes
[1:46:40] attached to he had to blind them to get
[1:46:41] a bride it's all about the bride
[1:46:46] we go to the sixth steel then the sixth
[1:46:48] deal was the purging
[1:46:51] of the foolish virgin
[1:46:52] that were along with the bride all the
[1:46:54] way through but just didn't have oil
[1:46:55] just couldn't see it
[1:46:57] the purging of the 144 000 which is the
[1:47:00] redemption of israel
[1:47:02] and the purging of earth for the
[1:47:03] honeymoon rain
[1:47:05] what is the seals
[1:47:07] it's the mystery of the new testament
[1:47:09] and when he when he opened those seals
[1:47:12] he unlocked the entire bible
[1:47:15] because you can't know christ
[1:47:17] if you don't see his bride
[1:47:20] you couldn't fully know adam until the
[1:47:23] bride came forth
[1:47:24] to express that part of adam that had to
[1:47:27] be expressed in that form
[1:47:31] god 2 000 years ago couldn't finish the
[1:47:34] work because the bride had to come forth
[1:47:38] she had to be built up she had to be
[1:47:40] displayed she had to be united back with
[1:47:42] her bridegroom
[1:47:44] then the earth has to be purged and she
[1:47:46] goes back
[1:47:47] for the thousand year reign tell your
[1:47:50] friends this message
[1:47:52] is unbelievable

[1:47:56] do you want to argue about doctrine
[1:48:00] no desire
[1:48:02] i'm not interested if you have this take
[1:48:04] or that take
[1:48:05] this is the only thing i can see now
[1:48:09] this is the whole purpose this is the
[1:48:11] whole bible that's been unlocked

[1:48:17] makes him the center of the life of the
[1:48:19] revelation see
[1:48:20] christ's life in you makes him the
[1:48:22] center of the revelation

[1:48:26] complete revelation of christ and christ
[1:48:28] in you makes you the complete
[1:48:31] revelation
[1:48:32] of the whole
[1:48:33] thing

[1:48:40] he's trying to reveal his mystery in
[1:48:43] this end time
[1:48:46] colossians 1 26 even the mystery which
[1:48:48] had been hid from ages and from
[1:48:50] generations but now is made manifest to
[1:48:52] his saints to whom god would make known
[1:48:54] what is the riches of the glory of this
[1:48:56] mystery among the gentiles which is
[1:48:59] christ in you
[1:49:00] the hope of glory
[1:49:02] all that scripture means more and more
[1:49:04] to us all the time friends
[1:49:07] it says what is it not them people
[1:49:10] the headship and the body has become one
[1:49:13] unit
[1:49:14] it's god manifested in his people that's
[1:49:18] the reason the husband and wife is no
[1:49:19] longer twain they are one god and his
[1:49:23] church is one christ in you

[1:49:46] be sober and hope to the end for the
[1:49:47] grace that is to be brought unto you
[1:49:50] at the apocalypses
[1:49:52] the unveiling
[1:49:54] of jesus christ
[1:49:56] how was he unveiled in the midst of
[1:49:58] seven golden candlesticks
[1:50:00] walking in seven golden candlesticks as
[1:50:03] four anointings that was guarding and
[1:50:04] protecting his church through the church
[1:50:06] ages and at the end time he was put out
[1:50:08] of that a son of god and come back a son
[1:50:11] of man and a prophetic ministry to unite
[1:50:13] the head and the body together and then
[1:50:15] bring forth the son of man again now
[1:50:17] christ the headship and his body are one
[1:50:22] and she is the manifestation of this
[1:50:25] hour
[1:50:28] it's my last quote
[1:50:31] the new birth is christ
[1:50:33] is a revelation god has revealed to you
[1:50:36] this great mystery and that's a new
[1:50:38] birth now what are you going to do when
[1:50:40] you get all that group together where
[1:50:42] the revelation is perfectly in harmony
[1:50:44] and god expressing it through his word
[1:50:46] by the same actions the same things that
[1:50:48] he did making the word manifest oh if
[1:50:50] the church only knew its position it
[1:50:53] will one day
[1:50:55] then the rapture will go when it knows
[1:50:57] what it is
[1:51:00] oh friends that's why god keeps taking
[1:51:02] listen there is not one quote that i
[1:51:05] read this morning that i have not read
[1:51:07] here before
[1:51:08] there is not one scripture that i read
[1:51:10] here that i have not read before but god
[1:51:12] is constantly peeling back the layers
[1:51:14] and peeling back the layers peeling back
[1:51:16] the layers because this bride has got to
[1:51:18] know what she is amen what is she she is
[1:51:21] him amen she is the word she is the
[1:51:24] mystery she she is part of that great
[1:51:27] mystery that god had when god dwelt
[1:51:29] alone was his thoughts she was there
[1:51:31] amen when the logos came out she was
[1:51:33] there amen when he was manifest as jesus
[1:51:35] christ she was there and now she is here
[1:51:39] taking her manifestation in her turn
[1:51:42] that's why when he opened those seals
[1:51:45] it opened the book of revelation the
[1:51:47] revelation
[1:51:48] is the apocalypse of jesus christ and a
[1:51:51] bride
[1:51:52] he was already had an apocalypses of
[1:51:55] jesus christ as a bridegroom
[1:51:58] but the book of revelation in the new
[1:51:59] testament is the apocalypse of jesus
[1:52:01] christ
[1:52:02] in bride
[1:52:04] bridegroom bride husband wife
[1:52:08] united to make the whole bible
[1:52:11] now it's not two parts of a bible
[1:52:13] testament new testament we're living in
[1:52:15] a day where it's one bible
[1:52:18] one story
[1:52:19] one goal that he wanted to achieve in
[1:52:21] the entire bible
[1:52:23] one purpose he had and that purpose amen
[1:52:26] was expressed in jesus christ the
[1:52:29] manifested manifestation of god almighty
[1:52:32] we've come to the day where it's not 66
[1:52:35] books it's not a moral code it's not a
[1:52:37] book of systems it's not a book of
[1:52:39] theology the message wasn't here to show
[1:52:41] a mighty gifted man the message was here
[1:52:43] to to take the body bring it up unite it
[1:52:47] with the head amen and now the the
[1:52:49] expression of jesus christ is in the
[1:52:51] formation of the bride that's to be
[1:52:53] expressed in this end time
[1:52:56] and when she's done expressing that when
[1:52:58] the last member comes and she's done
[1:53:01] expressing that then he'll lift her up
[1:53:03] purge the earth and they'll come back
[1:53:05] down to finish the unfinished part
[1:53:09] in the beginning of the book
[1:53:11] god our father will take his rest
[1:53:13] when his son and his son's wife sit upon
[1:53:16] the throne in the millennium
[1:53:19] brother bram said
[1:53:20] now do you see the message
[1:53:24] all the arguing all the fussing
[1:53:27] all the fussing over details i say god
[1:53:30] give me wings like an eagle let me fly
[1:53:32] on the ingo wigs of this prophet and
[1:53:34] lift up above the carnality of of all of
[1:53:37] the trying to decipher and trying to
[1:53:39] figure out and let me see this mystery
[1:53:42] and if you reveal this mystery
[1:53:44] everything else fits into this mystery
[1:53:47] everything else brother brenham said
[1:53:49] everything he was doing every everything
[1:53:51] that he taught fits to this mystery
[1:53:55] and when he opened the seals now do you
[1:53:57] believe it we believed it before but now
[1:53:58] do you believe it when he opened the
[1:53:59] seals he opened the entire bible amen
[1:54:02] praise be to god let's all stand
[1:54:05] musicians if you'll come
[1:54:09] i said it before and i'll say it again
[1:54:11] like jesus said to his disciples many
[1:54:13] righteous men many prophets
[1:54:16] long to see this day
[1:54:20] amen
[1:54:21] long to see this day
[1:54:23] and we live in a day that's going to
[1:54:25] take greater revelation than has ever
[1:54:27] struck to earth to bring a greater
[1:54:28] manifestation this is the hour for so
[1:54:30] god brought back the fullness of his
[1:54:33] word he brought back his mind he what
[1:54:35] did god bring back to us he sent a
[1:54:38] prophet who could go into the back part
[1:54:39] of the mind of god where this book was
[1:54:41] sealed
[1:54:43] when he was alone with his thoughts
[1:54:46] god could take the prophet back
[1:54:48] there and bring that mystery down
[1:54:52] and show it through the bible
[1:54:54] and we could find out
[1:54:56] what god was thinking about when he
[1:54:58] dwelt alone with his thoughts
[1:55:01] who else in the history of this creation
[1:55:04] has been able to do that
[1:55:08] who else has been able to do that
[1:55:10] friends when when when
[1:55:12] you know isaiah gave a prophecy but
[1:55:14] isaiah never saw the fulfillment of that
[1:55:16] prophecy
[1:55:18] moses gave a prophecy he never saw the
[1:55:20] isaiah can you imagine how isaiah would
[1:55:22] ponder i wonder how a virgin conceived
[1:55:25] is that now is that in the future is it
[1:55:27] the virgin nation is it one person will
[1:55:29] it be the daughter of the high priest
[1:55:30] will be a commoner can you imagine how
[1:55:33] he wondered you know what would isaiah
[1:55:36] have exchanged to see the baby in the
[1:55:38] manger
[1:55:41] think about that if he had the
[1:55:42] opportunity would he give up wealth
[1:55:44] would he give up popularity would he
[1:55:45] give up everything what would he give up
[1:55:47] to actually see the fulfillment of the
[1:55:50] prophecy
[1:55:53] what are we willing to give up
[1:55:57] because we see the fulfillment of the
[1:55:58] prophecy
[1:56:00] oh
[1:56:01] paul
[1:56:02] was laboring with the church says i i
[1:56:05] travail in birth i travail again till
[1:56:08] christ before you i want to see christ
[1:56:11] in you
[1:56:13] he said i have espoused you unto one
[1:56:15] husband but i fear lest as evil as
[1:56:17] begotten you shall be beguiled
[1:56:21] how paul would have loved
[1:56:24] to stand here and see what we see
[1:56:27] and hear what we hear the fulfillment of
[1:56:29] what he was preaching what he was
[1:56:30] longing for what he was trying to
[1:56:31] protect the church from what he was
[1:56:32] trying to guide them to now we're here
[1:56:36] righteous men holy men godly men
[1:56:38] prophets long to see this day and you
[1:56:40] and i are here and god has so taken his
[1:56:43] mind so perfectly and unveiled it opened
[1:56:46] himself with the complete apocalypses of
[1:56:48] jesus christ the unveiling of jesus
[1:56:50] christ was the opening of the mystery of
[1:56:52] god
[1:56:54] revelation 10 7 and he's given it to
[1:56:56] common human beings
[1:56:59] and when you break it down in its rawest
[1:57:01] form it's so simple a five-year-old can
[1:57:05] understand it
[1:57:08] god showed what he wanted to do in
[1:57:09] making a man and his wife and that fell
[1:57:12] and he's been restoring it all the way
[1:57:13] back and it'll be restored in jesus
[1:57:15] christ and his bride
[1:57:17] how complicated is that
[1:57:20] what is it
[1:57:22] it's the mystery of god
[1:57:26] that is finished in this day
[1:57:28] finished in you and i
[1:57:33] i wonder if we sufficiently appreciate
[1:57:36] the word in our minds
[1:57:39] i don't think we've even begun to
[1:57:41] understand
[1:57:43] what is all around us
[1:57:45] i don't even think we've begun to
[1:57:47] comprehend what god wants to do through
[1:57:49] us
[1:57:50] i don't even think we can even begin to
[1:57:52] comprehend how much we are changing by
[1:57:55] the word
[1:57:58] and where he wants to take this
[1:57:59] manifestation and what he wants to
[1:58:01] declare i don't think we can even begin
[1:58:03] to understand but i'm saying god help me
[1:58:06] to see give me that i sap let me have
[1:58:09] the gold tried and fired let me have the
[1:58:11] white raiment let me have the isaf god
[1:58:14] this is i tell your friends when god
[1:58:16] opens his word it's the greatest thrill
[1:58:17] of my life i have never experienced the
[1:58:19] thrill more exciting than god revealing
[1:58:21] himself
[1:58:24] i said god keep revealing yourself to us
[1:58:26] we need you lord we believe this message
[1:58:29] we believe that you've called forth for
[1:58:31] a bride manifestation in this day and
[1:58:33] we're apart we believe it with all of
[1:58:34] our hearts that this is the son of man
[1:58:36] ministry in a bright form i believe it
[1:58:38] with all my heart but god help me to see
[1:58:40] it correctly
[1:58:42] help me to recognize it in every area of
[1:58:44] my life help me to manifest it to live
[1:58:46] it to portray it is my desire let me be
[1:58:49] everything that i'm looking at let me
[1:58:51] see it clearly
[1:58:53] and let me live it
[1:58:54] is that your prayer too

[1:59:13] same tapes reading the same scriptures
[1:59:15] bible verse over and over quoting it by
[1:59:18] heart

[1:59:23] and open our understanding
[1:59:25] to understand the scriptures
[1:59:28] and god the thrill that unlocks from our

[2:00:04] in human flesh
[2:00:07] god help us to give you that preeminence
