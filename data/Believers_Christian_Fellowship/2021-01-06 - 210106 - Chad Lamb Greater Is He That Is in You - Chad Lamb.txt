========================================

oh god is good all the time he puts a song of praise in this heart of mine god is good all the time the darkest night his light will shine god is good oh god is good all the time amen is he good to you all the time amen i know he's good to me and i love that holy [Music] spirit [Music] [Music] of mercy [Music] oh lord in thy presence there's healing evil [Music] [Music] lord in these this place [Music] in this place [Music] our amen as brother chad comes this evening oh more of you i've had it all but what i need it's just [Music] lord hear my prayer for more [Music] it's is my [Music] amen brother branham said if you desire more of him then there's more of him to be had is it even never put a fin on a fish's back unless it was water water to swim in and if you desire more of god then there's more of god for you to have and while you're standing let's take our bibles and turn to the book of psalms psalm chapter 82 this is the scripture we open with on sunday so we're going to continue on with that thought the book of psalm chapter 82. in verse 6 i have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high and i like that scripture let's turn over to first john 4 all the way over close to revelation 1 john chapter 4. we'll read one scripture first john chapter 4 and verse 4 ear of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world i mean let's bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father for the goodness that you've given to us we appreciate your word lord it's so rich to us lord as you open it to us it's so meaningful lord it means so much to us we find our identification in your word and god as we come tonight we've set aside this time we've gathered according to your word nor we ask now that you would feed us lord your lambs we've come lord and you're our great shepherd and we're asking that you would break the bread of life for us and feed us from your own hand use this vessel lord for your glory and give us ears to hear in our heart to perceive all that you're speaking to us in this day in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can have your seeds when you seed i just want to announce that uh i've asked brother ben to preach on sunday brother ben siebold so he'll be preaching for us on sunday and it was obvious last time that he had a lot more material than he covered and i didn't want it to go a big long gap before he ministered so i wanted to get him in quickly so be praying for him he'll be taking the sunday service and i also wanted to share a little testimony with you on this past monday just two days ago we baptized a man here in the baptistry a man by the name of dean and he was a man that's been coming into the barbershop for years and brother jeremy sanders has been cutting his hair and they've talked about the bible and talked about different things for many many years and brother jeremy even shared that many years ago he even took this man this gentleman dean to speak with brother lonnie and brother lonnie was sharing some of the message with him and brother lonnie kept taking him to water baptism and every question and every every time they went off in a new direction they came back to water baptism but it seemed at that time that it just didn't click it didn't register and brother jeremy said just a little bit ago a week or two ago he was talking to the man again in the barbershop and he wanted to know more about revelation the book of revelation he had a desire and when he made a mention of something jeremy was brother jeremy's getting ready to tell him something and he felt a strong urge to talk to him about water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and he did in that time it clicked and the man wanted to be baptized so we brought him he came here monday monday was the day he could come he came here monday and we baptized him in the name of the lord jesus christ and this baptistery here and he wants to come to services when he can he mentioned that he might come wednesday i don't see him tonight but he may come his name's dean so if you see a visitor named dean just greet him in the name of the lord he's hungry for revelation he's hungry to know the word of god he's been raised as a catholic man all of his life and so just be praying for him and be prayed that god fills that hunger he's got for the word and the god will open his eyes to truth amen that i took from a text out of this uh chapter 4 verse 4 first john and i want to talk about greater is he that is in you and this is a good time to talk about this this was the subject god actually he had laid this on my heart before sunday's message but laid it on my heart to preach after sunday's message so i i was thankful for that that i knew what to cover this time as some of you may have seen that there was riots that broke out in washington dc today and i didn't know it i i was studying not watching the news but somebody sent me a text and i looked it up and and i can say the world is falling apart this nation is falling apart it's coming unglued at the seams as the prophet told us it had to none of these things are outside of what the prophet told us said america will never rise again shall fall she's rejected the gospel she is finished he goes i don't even pray for her anymore you know and that was a prophet who could see that thing afar off but this is the fulfillment of everything that he talked about and so there were riots you know pro-trump rioters and they had you know breached the security barricades at the capitol and uh got into the the building and breaking out windows and climbing in and and they're protesting the certification of the election because they they know the country's corrupt but that wasn't new brother ram told us that back in the 60s amen and so the world's in chaos and uh i just thank god he's put us in a different position when there's riots breaking out and there's there's pro this riot and anti this riot and now anybody who gets upset needs to go out into the street and break something and destroy something but when the world's falling apart god is bringing himself back together the body is being knit back together to display christ in all of his attributes in the form of his bride and i thank god that those things are troubling those things are terrible that i'm not even putting my eyes on those things because there's something so much glorious we're looking at there's something so much wonderful that the world is going the way the world has to go brother brenham said the world is falling apart let it fall apart it has to fall apart to bring about the millennium unless there's a destruction of all the world orders there'll be no millennium friends so it's got to fall apart it's got to fall apart for the kingdom that's coming so man is destroying himself he's in the process of destroying himself and he's in the process of creating his own hell because that's what man does best man as he rejects god when he tries to save himself he loses himself as he tries to create a better a better standard of living in a better society than what god had in mind he destroys himself and that's what's happening but greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen god is giving us an identification so we don't be we don't have to be identified as americans we can be identified as christians who live in america this is where god planted us this is where he wants us to be and i thank god whether it rises or whether it falls i want to be where he wants me to be and i want to serve him where he has me at but i do not want i can say this way i do not want to act like an american americans are selfish and childish and rebellious they are the epitome of laodicean people's rights my rights i want i want a stimulus check to buy enough gas money to go back and break out the windows of the very building that passed the law to give me the check how that went full circle but praise god we've got another kingdom we've got something else that means so much more to us these things will go the way they'll go i'm not going to protest i'm not going to get upset i'm not going to complain because my god is good and his word is true and the clock is ticking right on time i want to read out of the message as the eagle stirs her nest from 1961 brother bram says no sir papa eagle they look just like him they believe the same thing he does they look like him yes sir they're made like him they're built like him and he knows they're genuine eagles oh my that's what god wants a genuine messiah yes he is messiah messiah is the anointed one and we are his children which have a lesser anointing so we're as jehovah eagles great eagle and we're eaglets he's messiah and we with the same anointing are messiahs amen anointed messiah means the anointed one are you anointed amen what with the same spirit that he was anointed with we have it in measure he has it without measure he was god manifest in the flesh and we're sons of god parts of him come on yes sir the very works that i do shall you do also i might take a spoonful of water out of this ocean out here and you'd never miss it in the ocean that's the way we'd be that's the way we'd be missed if we would happen to to drop out but remember the same chemicals that's in the entire ocean is in that spoon some spoon some of water that's just more of it out there so that's what it is you say what is it out there ocean water what is it out there ocean water what is it in here in the spoonful ocean water what is it out there ocean water what is it in here ocean water it's exactly the same thing just a portion of what that is he said that's the way papa eagle thinks about his little ones think about that that's the way papa eagle thinks about his little ones that's not how the little ones think about themselves that's how papa eagle thinks about his little little ones it's the same thing only in a portion the spoonful is in you amen what is it out there it's god what is it in here it's god it's the life of god there it's the life of god in here brother brahma says in the message messiah from 61 he says man was made to be a god god was made to be man striking o messiah the great jehovah dwelt in a human body made that body like his so he could be a human body a messiah to govern this earth and control it amen the works that i do shall they do also oh i like that we come down here to questions and answers from 1964 he says now brother branham could jesus look like you or you be jesus or something like that this is a great question amen and we know back in the day there was a deity spirit that was moving in and brother branham was battling that at this time and they were saying that that he was jesus christ and so somebody asked the questions and questions and answers and look at how brother branham addresses this question he said could you could jesus look like you or you be jesus or something like that and this says one sense of the word that's exactly the truth another sense of the word is an antichrist that's the difference between right and wrong to make me the person of the lord jesus christ would be an antichrist for that person of the lord jesus is sitting at the right hand of majesty on high and will come again in great power and glory but for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you who have him it's exactly the truth and you become christ you remember my message on messiahs you you are the word messiah means the anointed one now you are if you have the holy spirit you become the anointed one then there's all kinds of anointed ones as paragraph 88 we jump down to the bottom of this where he's answering this question in paragraph 111 he said now you understand we are not we are messiahs but not that jesus he's our father we're just anointed with his spirit and that's the reason his life and that's and that gets people see if you don't set and think it through it gets people to believe well this guy would be the messiah sure he is sure he is this one over here could be they both are so which one's the messiah both amen well how can there be two of them there's thousands of them see but you see his life is it separated on the day of pentecost when that pillar of fire come down it separated separated like tongues and set upon each of them god dividing himself among his people because the church and christ is one just as the husband and wife is one so we find out when we say greater is he that that is in you amen it's it's him it's his life amen that makes you a messiah that makes you an anointed one that makes you part of christ amen and he said this one could be messiah of course he can and this one too yeah there's no conflict there's no argument amen how could both of them be how could there be two of them he said there's thousands of them why it's the bride expressed on earth amen is the messiah is the anointed one is god anointed in flesh again and the message is your life worthy of the gospel he says and did you know that you're a little creator yourself you know that certainly you've seen people that you just love to be around you don't know why you just love that type of person have you seen that just as kind there you like to be around them they create that atmosphere by the life they live the way they talk their conversation then you've seen those that every time you shun them all the time they want to talk about something evil and talk about somebody say oh my there they come they're going to criticize somebody there here's in here now he's going to talk me about this man all they're going to do is tell dirty jokes or something about women or something like that you just hate to get around them see they create seemingly pretty nice people but they create that atmosphere and the things that you think on and the things that you do the actions that you think you talk about creates an atmosphere this is what i want to talk about for a little while greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world and what's in there it's the life of god it's zoe life it's a it's the anointed it's the messiah a messiah amen but there's a power of creation within us that's right brother branham said if you have a a fraction i think he said of the life of god there's enough power in you to speak a world into existence and go and live a private life on there he said but that power is controlled by a law and it's the law of faith amen it's got to operate by the word of god amen according to the will of god and be led by the spirit of god so we know that there's a power of creation within amen the children of god and we we saw that expressed in brother branham we saw it when the lord spoke to him and he spoke squirrels into existence and it wasn't like in in the days of jesus christ when jesus took something and broke it and multiplied it now we're moving into a realm where there is a man that was born in sin not virgin born but sin born he's come to a place in the cycle of redemption where god can tell him amen to speak a spoken word creation amen and not take elements and change them not take elements and alter them but speak and absolutely create but it means where there was nothing create squirrels amen so we've seen that dynamic power and remember what i want to when i want to labor on what i want to talk about is the ability to create atmosphere because those things are those things are wonderful when we see that we see amen that god's power of redemption is a complete power when he can bring man to that place but i want to look at the god's power of redemption in us and in the zoe life on the inside and the ability to create around us to be creators and create atmosphere it talks about there's even an ability to create with those who have no zoe life because they create a bad atmosphere and if they have power to create atmosphere who don't have the life of god what can we do with the life of god so then that the things that you think on the things that you do the actions the things you talk about create an atmosphere i'm going to read a couple more quotes here as we move on in 1957 the message life he said then if we have zoe god's life in us we become sons of god and amateur creators in the message love from 1956 he says now do you realize being a son or daughter of god that you are a minor creator do you know you create the atmosphere that you live in did you hear that you create the atmosphere if you live in if you don't like the atmosphere you're living in who are you going to blame amen you're going to blame the government or cnn or you're going to blame democrats or the management at work amen greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world amen there's a power a creative power within the believers and and brother branham says you create the atmosphere that you live in amen and if we can be conscious of this and aware of what's going on and what's working in us and through us amen we can create an atmosphere that we can live in that will affect others and create an effect all around us and then we don't have to live in everybody else's atmosphere or the atmosphere of the world we can live in a different atmosphere brother brahman says i'm going to read two quotes from 1955 where brother brown just gives absolute practical advice on how to do this he says now it's strange that this is so much thought of people they say well i'm weak my faith is not very much i'm not a very good christian he said that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then see and sometimes there's a there's a false humility uh within us that wants to just almost like if we can abase ourselves and say well i'm no good and i'm really nothing and i and i'm this this and this that somehow that's more christian or more of a christian attitude but i i want to get to the place where there's no more pride because that that whole thing is based on pride actually because you know when we think too much about ourselves like whether somebody thinks about me or doesn't think about me or they like me or don't like me then you're just thinking about yourself you're consumed with your thinking about what people think of me whether they think well of me or what they think bad of me and and you know and i don't want them to think wrong of me so i'll just tell i'm no good and i'm nothing that that's just a self-absorption amen we got to get away from that until we can get to the true reality of who we are amen where i am a child of god by the grace of god his word has called me out and he's placed me in this age and i'm comfortable with what he's done in me amen and it has nothing to do with the human side of me i know that in me is no good thing amen but there's a life that he's placed down in the soul that he came and he quickened himself to life and that is nothing less than god so i stand here as a paradox yes there's nothing good in me of course that we're all in the same boat there there's nothing good in any of us amen but if you're a child of god there's a portion of god down there there's a spoonful out of the ocean amen and we've got to recognize that in the reality amen and the reality of what it is because if we keep speaking that down amen we're pushing down the very thing that's going to give us overcoming power until we can get to the reality that says by the grace of god i am who i am paul the apostle he struggled he was struggling with this in the uh the book of corinthians he's he's saying i'm an apostle and lisa the apostles and not worthy to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church paul brother talks about that paul always he always was reflecting back on on the persecution and the death of stephen and he said it troubled him and he looked back and he says i i'm lisa the apostles not even worthy to be called an apostle amen because i persecuted the church but by the grace of god i am what i am oh if we could all get to that place and create that atmosphere around us amen i'm not the worst and i'm not the best i'm just what he made me and i want to be all that he made me and i don't want to hold back his expression anymore and i don't want to downplay what god has done amen because to be a son of god to be a child of god is no trivial thing it's no light thing it's not something to be trampled on and put down and put in the back pocket and hid from people it's the greatest privilege in the world it's a wonderful thing amen so we want to be careful how we talk brother says well i'm weak my faith is not very much i'm not a very good christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then you mustn't never say that amen you mustn't never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time see listen we're talking about creating an atmosphere that we're amateur creators who create an atmosphere amen brother brother branham is giving us practical advice and he's telling us what to say and what not to say to create this atmosphere don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time i'm saved i have god in my heart i believe him with all my heart do you believe in divine healing with all my heart he's he's showing you what to say i'm saved i have god in my heart i believe him with all my heart amen he says now your testimony always in your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts that don't entertain it well you say i can't help the thoughts from coming well that'll be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from roosting so that's the good thing you see you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on no sir jesus christ is my savior all things are mine by god i'm going to keep them i'm going to testify of them and god can only bless you as you confess what he has done for you see his th he's the high priest of our confession is that right hebrews 3 he said that he's the high priest of our confession he can only do it for us as we accept it and believe it and confess it so part of what creates our atmosphere that we live in are the words that come out of our mouth because the power of life and death lay in the tongue and happy is the man that eateth the fruit thereof and you find sometimes we find believers they believe this message and remember they're always in a cycle of defeat and always in a cycle of destruction always in a cycle of negative and losing and not in a cycle of winning and my question is are we creating that atmosphere and living in the own creation that we've created with spoken word like it never works out for me well just keep saying that right because the power of life and death laying the tongue you keep saying what never works out for me i i just don't believe i'm ever going to get over this i just don't believe i can ever conquer this i just don't know how things are ever going to be right in our home i just don't know how our marriage is ever going to be right i just don't know how my children have ever come to the lord hey you keep confessing that amen and you're expressing amen creative power out of the lips of a son of daughter of god there's power in what we say there's power in what we confess amen and sometimes we i believe many times the cycle of defeat in the cycle of destruction and the cycle of negative in our life is our very own fault because we don't simply take the word of god and say what the word says we start speaking symptoms and feelings and reasonings and all the messages that the devil give us and we deny the very word that will help us overcome amen and saying well you know i hope i'm a son of god that kind of confession will get you nowhere but if you've got an inkling of a feeling in your heart towards god you say i am a son of god amen if there's something pricking you and pulling you you say god is calling me god is drawing me amen god is working in my heart i belong to him sometimes we we want to we want to be so honest we lie we're so worried about being honest with the thoughts on our mind and not honest with the still small voice in our heart amen and because we have a doubt comes through our mind we feel obligated to confess that doubt amen remember brother branham said satan can put thoughts in your mind he can't read your thoughts all he can hear is what you confess out of your mouth and see the way you act but he can put thoughts in your mind amen and then when he watches you confess those thoughts or act them out then he just smiles because it's exactly the goal because inside of you is a dynamo power of god that can create an atmosphere amen that can move circumstances that can bind enemy forces and loose things upon this earth there's power there if you'll take that power and express it by the word of god so we get in this nega i just don't know how i'm ever going to get better it's always been this way i i mean we are always struggling how about saying my father owns the cattle on a thousand hills amen and he has promised to pour blessings upon me i've paid my tithe i've given my offering and he'll pour out a blessing i cannot contain and i'm excited to see what god's going to do next instead of saying you know it seems like we're just one of those we never have enough it's always been rough for us i guess that's my lot in life amen where in the word did you read that what scripture are you quoting we're creating the atmosphere we live in we're creating you know sometimes you know we we we hold back on confession the word amen and and we don't either we we don't want to be fanatical we we don't want to just be self-deceived and so we have to reason things in our mind and speak things based off reasoning and feelings that are absolutely contrary to the word of god i mean like well you know if i'm not elect i'm just going to serve the elect where will that confession get you that confession will keep you always wondering whether or not you're chosen of god if you keep confessing that you'll never be able to get over that hump and what good does it do it doesn't accomplish anything but if god is dealing in your heart and you believe this word amen and god is drawing you by the word who does he draw he doesn't draw non-elect he draws his elect to the message of the hour he shines the light in their heart they receive it by faith they know it's the truth amen there's this word coming to word there's a natural attraction don't throw that away because of a thought that's in the mind a doubt or a mistake don't throw that away say i believe this word i believe it's true and i believe it's for me because i believe it why do you think it's for you because i believe it like i'm not pretending to believe it i believe it amen and i know in my heart that it's the truth i know that god sent a prophet in this day i know the word is true i know god is manifest in his bride amen who knows that who knows that in the bottom of their heart the elect know that friends not an intellectual understanding but a reality inside amen god has showed you his word of life he has revealed it to you and i would take that and say by the grace of god he has revealed himself to me and i'm his because he only reveals himself to his elect and so we create an atmosphere that we walk in and then brother branham said listen your mind in your mind you could be thinking you're the worst christian on the planet and you may have evidence to back up that statement but brother bam said don't say that say i'm a good christian i believe the word god is my father amen say i'm overcoming by his grace and say i will overcome this trial and i will overcome the next trial i will not always be in this cycle of defeat but i will come clear and the things i don't understand i will understand by revelation someday amen amen if we're living in a bad atmosphere we have nobody else to blame amen it's not the news it's not social media amen it's not anybody else if we or children of god are living in a bad atmosphere there's nobody to blame but us because there's creative power by the sea gene of god to create a new atmosphere and if we want a new atmosphere we've got to start speaking a new atmosphere we've got to change our language and make our language match the bible amen and say it and then i can say this because brother branham said it say it until you believe it is that honest is that honest say it till you believe it i mean i'm saying i believe it but i have doubts and i have questions brother branham said say it till you believe it how could he say such a thing because he's telling you to say what the bible says and if you say what the bible says you can say it till you believe it and if you disbelieve it there's another spirit and not the spirit of god because the spirit of god will not give you a contrary thought that's contrary to this word so say what the word says and if you're struggling with a doubt or a question in your heart say it until the question goes away say it till the doubt is quiet and say it till you believe it hallelujah in the next message in 1955 brother bam still talking about giving advice to just around the corner when you get to thinking about divine healing get to thinking about christ keep him on your mind if there be any praise if there be any virtue the bible says think on these things if any thought comes by well maybe it couldn't be so maybe get it off your mind right quick think on these things that's positive never let a negative thought pass through don't let it stop anyhow if it starts to keep your thoughts positive jesus don't think sitting there in a wheelchair you that are your hope don't think that you're hopeless helpless you're not did you catch that he said think i'm going to read that again don't think sitting there in a wheelchair you that you're hopeless helpless you're not you're not don't let that negative thought ever pass through don't let it anchor you can't help it from going through your mind that's right but don't let it stop like the old farmer said i can't keep the birds from flying over my place but he had a double-barreled shotgun said i can sure keep them from roosting so you do the same thing you too don't let them roost let them pass right on through now here's the shotgun to use both new and old testament a double barrel very good too i'll tell you it keeps them all away so what do we do to keep the negative thoughts away you take the double barrel shotgun of the word and blow them out of the sky amen keep shooting those birds away you can't stop them from coming but you do not have to identify with that thought you do not have to confess it if it doesn't match the word you do not have to speak it out of your lips and i would just take the scripture and blow it out of the water blow it out of the sky or wherever it's at but praise be to god brother branham in such a simple way he showed us how practically to create a different atmosphere and we take the word of god and we speak the word of god by faith in the message token brother ma'am is talking about the token and he's talking about applying the token in our lives and our family and of praying with the token applied and here's what he says he says get get ready apply it believe it clean up let your children let your family let your loved ones see it in you that's right it'll take effect yes sir then apply the token in prayer with consideration with believing apply it with such love and so forth until you know it's going to take it's going to take place that's all apply in confidence believing it's going to help when you talk to that child when you talk to your husband talk to your wife talk to this loved one believe that it's going to help just stand there and say lord i've claimed them they're mine i'm getting them for you lord apply it and create that atmosphere around you create that atmosphere around you that they'll just drop right in it see oh you you are if you've got the token you create a spirit around you a power that when you walk people know that you're a christian they love for you to say something to them they believe your word what you say they hold on to it see that's it and i'll tell you when brother-in-law talks about applying this token if you've got the token you create an atmosphere around you amen and it's an atmosphere of faith in the word amen and you created your own atmosphere so if you come into the room and people scoot out the back door don't blame them do you understand if every situation you find yourself in turns acostic at some point if every relationship and everything at some point or another i'm fighting with everybody around me and and nobody understands me and nobody loves me and everybody judges me i'd say look at the atmosphere that you've created because we want to create that atmosphere where people love to be around you they just want to talk to you they want you to say something to them why because it's the atmosphere of god amen they're sensing something they may not put it in the words but when they get around you and they begin to talk to you there's a calming spirit brother branham would feel it on the platform he says now you've got a you've got a familiar spirit i i sense your spirit you're a christian we create our atmosphere if we're if we're at odds with somebody every day that's the atmosphere we created it's not all those other people's fault it's us brother said i was listening to a message in the tape he said he says you only reflect what you're looking at or what you're pointed at and see sometimes we're reflecting back because either we're not staying with our mind stayed on him all the time we've got something else where we're looking at we're caught up in something in the world we're we're troubled by some other things that's going on we're caught up in entertainment or caught up in the news of the day amen we begin whatever we're looking at we begin to reflect it back whatever we're pointed to whatever we're focusing our attention on we begin to reflect it back amen and that's why it's important to keep your mind state on him amen think about him things that are lovely things that are just if there be any value there be any virtue think on these things amen keep your mind on christ amen when another thought comes push it out listen to the message have fellowship with believers be in church amen whatever you have to do read your bible pray keep your mind full of the word of god amen because there's messages all day every day trying to fill your mind with something else and then you've got to constantly reject those and fill yourself with the word of god all the time because what you what you pointed out what you're looking at you will begin to reflect and so keep your eyes on christ all the time now i want to go back to this quote i wasn't going to go here but i'm going to go here when i was looking at this quote when he says brother ben's talking says you sitting there in the wheelchair you that you're hopeless helpless you're not and you think about somebody who may have been in a wheelchair all their life they've got some physical ailment or something that's crippled them or held them in a wheelchair created some weakness or something uh and all their life you can easily in the flesh if you've lived all your life that way feel hopeless or helpless like it's i think we would all experience those emotions every one of us if you lived all your life in that condition and you never had the strength to rise above that and you've never known what it was to be different than that you would feel hopeless or you would feel helpless amen but brother brenham said you're not and i would i want to i want to look at a scripture together if we could uh look at luke i think it's in luke i think i might be able to find it yet luke chapter 13. yeah luke chapter 13. i was reading this the other day and when i come across it it just it hit me with such impact i began to realize some of the things i want to share like i said i didn't intend to go into this tonight but praise the lord anyhow luke 13 10 and when he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself so she is crippled she is bowed over like like hunched back they're curled over and bowed over and she could in no way straighten herself up she is she this is a crippled woman who's bowed over in the back and could not raise herself and couldn't know wise lift up herself and when jesus saw her he called to her he called her to him and said unto her woman thou art loosed from thine infirmity and he said and he laid his hand on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god what i like about this is in verse 11 there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity she did not have a crippled body that was a spirit of infirmity that was reflecting in a crippled body you understand you understand what i'm trying to say we would look at that and say that poor woman she was probably born a she's probably a hunchback she's bowed over her spine is probably deformed i mean she she may she may have been disfigured she may have been in that condition so long her muscles have have molded to that position and she could not even raise herself up and we look at that as a physical condition and that is not a physical condition that is a spiritual infirmity and i'll tell you why that is amazing the reason that's amazing is because he hath made us kings and priests and we're kings over a spiritual dominion over a spiritual kingdom we're spiritual kings and priests and if that's a spiritual affirmative infirmity we have the power and the spiritual realm to exercise our dominion as a king and a priest over the spiritual realm and cast that thing out and reject that and let it go and not worry about how the muscles will work and how the spine will come back and it's not hopeless it's not helpless it's not because there's kings and priests on this earth spiritual kings and priests over a spiritual kingdom now not will be but he hath already made us kings and priests see we defeat ourselves by what our eyes see we see a in a wheelchair we see a hunchback we see a withered arm amen we see a club foot we see crossed eyes we see blind or deaf and we think oh that's a physical ailment they might need a surgery they might need that amen those things are brought on by spiritual infirmities and we can deal with that thing in the spirit realm amen is that what the scripture says brother jesus goes on to say they they condemn him for healing on the sabbath and he says is it wrong on the sabbath amen you loose your ass you lose your ox to take them to get water why couldn't i loose this being a a daughter of abraham lucifer from satan's bound she wasn't bound in the flesh it was a spiritual infirmity it was reflected in the flesh see when we start flesh flesh and see we're incapable when we keep it in the realms of flesh we're incapable we're unable we're totally we can't straighten the spine we can't stretch muscles we can't create we can't create eyeballs you understand i'm talking flesh in the flesh we can do nothing but in the spirit it's a different story where he's brought us to it's different amen we could speak to the life that's bringing crippled we can speak to that life amen it's bringing infirmity we can speak to the life that's brought a club foot and we can cast out that life and resist that life in the name of jesus christ and watch the flesh go to match amen the confession we have to quit being so naturally minded and so locked down by our natural uh senses and our natural reasoning and get get to the position called god has called us to be in and how are we gonna ever live there if we don't start speaking a different kind of language to create a different kind of atmosphere all around us the disciples so had that revelation of who they were and the power that was given to them over scorpions and serpents and all the power of the devil that when peter would walk down the road they would lay people in his shadow there was nothing physical it wasn't it wasn't the physical properties of a shadow changing something physical in their body amen it was driving spirits away from people and we may be weak in the flesh may we be incapable in our mind we may not have strength in our arms or intelligence enough to fix things amen but that's not our condition in the spirit realm spiritually we're warriors mighty gentile warriors we've been restored amen we've been brought back amen by the grace of god and by the plan of redemption we are now kings and priests over a spiritual dominion we have to create that atmosphere that brings changes and quit speaking things we see and start speaking things we believe if we only speak what we see we're never going to see anything because we're going to have to wait till we see something to confess it but that's absolutely backwards to the reality we have to confess something before we see it we have to stick with the word so brother-in-law says you in that wheelchair you're not hopeless you're not help you think you're hopeless you think your help is you're not whatever the physical condition whatever the infirmity the physical condition the the limitation whatever the the cycle we've been in whatever the family situation whatever the work whatever finance whatever i don't care what it is amen you're not hopeless you're not helpless if you can take the battle out of the natural to the spiritual amen you'll find that there's an overcomer living within you but we gotta we gotta rise above the natural brother braham says in the spoken word is the original seed it says in a real seed of god is an absorbent for the spirit all denominationalism is took out all unbelief is out and when the holy spirit comes into that germ of life that's laying there it produces another seed just exactly another son of god is born amen another amateur god son of god when the holy ghost comes in quickens the seed on the inside it's another amateur god he's not talking about will be he's talking about the new birth is birthed why it's birth the creation of god a son of god an offspring of god an amateur god amen the the heathen caught this faster than the jews because when paul and barnabas went to the heathens amen and they began to heal amen they brought offerings to them and bowed down and said the gods have come down from heaven unto us they recognize that these are gods that come down from heaven amen and you know what they weren't far from the truth they just had the wrong gods they thought it was they thought it was jupiter and they thought it was mercury or mars they didn't realize that these are just offspring of the one and true god amen so they raised them up and said don't you sacrifice those animals don't you worship us in the flesh you worship god because that's who we're part of the heathen caught it the jews missed it and i don't want to be like the jews i don't want to miss it amen when the new birth takes place there's an amateur god on the scene brother man said i'm a branham because i was born of charlie and elebranum that makes me a branham because of their seed their two agreements with their sperm together made a seed and that made me when god in his word becomes one hallelujah when god's spirit waters the seed of god the word of god it produces god it produces god and it's not the individual it's god that's why we don't even pay attention to the flesh the flesh feels bad i don't care the flesh doubts in the mind i'm not paying attention it's not the individual it's god and i'm paying attention to the god on the inside amen that's who i want to identify with because that's who i really am down deep so if my mind says something contrary forget it amen that's not who i am if my flesh begins to rebel amen i don't care amen that is not who i am it's not the individual it's god for what you are dead you're not yourself no more you reckon yourself dead hallowed hollowed out waiting for the seed germ then what is it it isn't you no more it isn't the man it's god in the man it's the seed germ like the beginning spoken word it's god's word made manifest in a man then it isn't the man it's a man that's died he could be a hybrid and a son at the same time he can't be a hybrid and a son at the same time he's either a son of death or a son of life so he was the son of death get over to the devil and let him kill it i mean give over to god i meant and let him kill the devil that's in you run him out hollows you out then let god plant his own life in you then it's not you no more it's god's life because it's god's word watered by the holy spirit will produce the same thing you see it he says now in the message jehovah jireh is now now here he is among his church today made flesh in his church certainly elohim now oh if you could only realize that you men you were made to be an amateur god the fall took us out of our rightful position but you were made to be a god upon the earth that is god's original intent for his sons and daughters upon the earth to be to be gods upon the earth you were made to be an amateur god you're a son of god you're an heir of god and you have a domain genesis 1 26 he give him dominion over everything in the earth he made him a god over the earth that's right he give him a domain he's a king god and where he got his fall he could speak to trees be changed plucked up and said over here to the winds and waves be still and be stopped it was god an amateur god a son of god like you're a son of your father and all the world is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god waiting for the church to get back in its place again sons of god to be made manifest waiting for that hour hope that don't hurt but i just had to say it see the church is so far away from its place it needs to be back to be sons of god again rulers governors of the earth under the spiritual reign it will be someday when the chief one comes jesus christ the great millennium nature's groaning for that day god god intended for us to be gods offspring of god amateur gods he has now made us kings and priests over a spiritual dominion we do not have to live in a bad atmosphere we do not have to accept that everything the devil throws our way every thought in our mind every doubt every confusion every ache and every pain and every symptom we don't have to accept it we may have to suffer through it but we don't have to accept it we can challenge that thing we can challenge the spirit behind that thing see it's like when you have somebody who gets irate with you i could be in the grocery store because you get in line in front of them or or they could be just i mean smoke rolling out of the ears because you got the last roll of toilet paper you know we were in that atmosphere earlier this year or because you didn't notice them and pulled out in front of them and they curve around you and make bad hand gestures at you and yell and all of those things amen when you realize that's not that person i'm not even going to look at the flesh that's a spirit amen those angry words amen that's i'm not even going i'm not even going to go there amen because there's a spirit behind that and that spirit is trying to get to me as a son of god and trying to get me to confess something other than the word so many times amen we feel justified in responding to criticism responding to angry words responding to hatred and malice and all these things because it's so over the top sometimes sometimes you do something this big and the response you get is this big and you have to realize it's not that person there's a spirit there trying to get to me a son of god and i'm not going to take the devil's baits so the next time somebody gets smoking hot at you say i'm i'm really sorry can i buy you a cup of coffee they may be dead wrong every which way they're wrong amen just tell them they're right and reach in your wallet and give them 20 bucks and tell them you love them because it's not them and you telling them the truth is not going to fix the situation and you repairing their bad attitude or correcting their wrong statement isn't going to fix it there's a spirit back there and if you do something like that you'll drive that spirit right out of that person the devil's trying to get us out of this atmosphere and bring us down into this atmosphere and i've taken the bait so many times i don't want to take it anymore it's like a mother at home amen all of a sudden everything will be going wrong the noodles are boiling over on the stove the baby's crying two of them are pulling each other's hair out over there it's not the baby and it's not the stove it's a spirit trying to get to you amen brother branham came in that situation at his home and then he had visitors all day long and the house was a wreck and the kids were fighting over blocks his wife was upset haven't fed the kids all day had company she's in turmoil amen and she she's not being uh sweet and submissive she's being frustrated and upset and and troubled his kids aren't running up and say daddy daddy you're the greatest thing on the earth but he walked in there and he realized that this situation is trying to get to the ministry amen i've been helping people all day and the devil's out here attacking my family trying to get to me and he didn't address you know calm down sweetheart don't talk that way you two kids you hush up over there what he did is he stepped in as an amateur god and he said i'm going to change this atmosphere and he tells us he did he tells us about it multiple times he went in and put on an apron he started washing dishes amen he did start quoting scriptures he started talking about a dress they buy for his wife and he said then he didn't even address the kids fighting over the blocks you understand that he addressed his wife he calmed her spirit he came with a calm spirit he had an atmosphere around him that calmed his wife he said pretty soon the kids had calmed down and were playing with blocks the house was in order and the best part is his wife told him quit helping me with the dishes i've got it it's good to be an amateur god because if he had handled that wrong he might have been doing dishes for a long long long time but you see brother benham he shows us these things they're demonstrated in his life so that we can see it's not necessarily about i've got to make everything right line everything up i just got to bring as an amateur god i've got to create another atmosphere amen and there's a power that is emanating out of the children of god to create another atmosphere and so many times i mean just in family life and i i have no intention of talking about family life tonight but praise god here we are just in family life there's traps all around trying to get the family from up here to down here always trying to get your home and your family amen because your family your home is the atmosphere where your children can be born again amen because birth takes place in the right atmosphere so the devil is constantly trying to disrupt your home atmosphere and if we go in there with the wrong attitude and not realize what the devil's trying to do we're going to cause a greater disruption to the atmosphere because we ride in with a posse on a horse and a big gun and we start fighting fleshly things in fleshly ways instead of just bringing a different atmosphere instead of just coming in calm and quiet and recognizing what the devil's trying to do this is not this is not because my children are disrespectful they're always respectful that something's going on this isn't because my wife hates me she loves me this isn't because my husband doesn't love me he loves me something else is going on and if we could recognize those things and actually speak the word live the word create that atmosphere and have confidence and atmosphere you'll find that that atmosphere begins to change situations it'll change situations at work it'll change situations wherever you go you ever find yourself in the grocery store and somebody just wants to keep talking to you have you ever been there they talk to you and they want to keep talking to you and it's like i've got to go but they want to keep talking to you you realize if you had the awareness of what's going on in the spirit realm amen you have no idea that that presence that they feel when they come near you is something they're longing for they don't feel it here and they don't feel it there and they may never feel it at home but they come into an atmosphere around you that's different and they just want to say hello how are you then they want to show you pictures of their grandchildren and we could get irritated about that or we could understand this is probably the most peaceful feeling they've had all week if we just could be aware of who we are and what god's trying to do through us it it's different we get so accustomed to ourselves and so accustomed to each other i remember the first time i come to church and heard the saints worship and everybody sing with their whole heart it floored me it floored me i'm i was used to a worship team up front and everybody sitting and watching the worship team and a few congregational songs and we were pretty happy when they were done especially if they weren't fast enough and when i come into a service where the atmosphere was different where the whole congregation was singing and they were seeing with their whole heart and you felt like they meant every word they said it floored me and i don't think we get so accustomed to it we don't realize when the visitor comes in there's something that's shocking to them we create a different atmosphere if we could just be aware of that we could benefit from that brother brahm says in the message it is the rising of the sun and so is it today we don't try to be some big person we don't care what the people say about us our name ain't nothing it's his name our life it's nothing it's his life it's his power not our power and there's only one thing that we love to do is see him glorified how can it be when he's glorified in us by his resurrection that's in us we see him represented again as he was today did you get that see our desire is not to be glorified our desire is not some big name our desire is not to boost some church or make more in this sunday school or try to bring in a hog tie push in offer a picnic party or bring stars buttons or something else like that that's not our desire our desire is to see him glorified glorified what not with self-pride but in us our lives to prove he is alive and living in us we this creating an atmosphere this amateur god it's not about the individuals not the individual it's god and if we could just release ourselves to god's life in us and let god have control and let god's life be forefront and let our life be secondary we'll see more things friends you know jesus when he was when he was here on the earth he would open blinded eyes and after he opened the blinded eyes he said see that you tell no man he wasn't doing it for his glory he was following the commandments of the lord and when our primary objective is for him to be glorified i believe with all my heart we'll see more when there's no more pride and there's no more self-vindication amen i i want i want and i long to get to the place where we can see somebody struggling and we can tell them about divine healing and they ask for prayer and we lay hands on them and blind eyes open somebody crippled walk a foot strains or whatever and we thank god for that and they go testifying and we don't tell nobody i long for that day i long for the day where god can come down and manifest and he's the only one who gets the credit that i realize that i'm so i'm so incapable in my flesh that the individual is dead and i have no ability or capability that if anything happened it was god anyways i tell you i i've had trouble sometimes where i've come to the pulpit so tore up in my spirit i was in the back crying and begging god not to make me come out and preach that i was on the verge of playing a tape and i'll come out and i'll preach and during the whole sermon i'm not edified and i'm still troubled in my spirit and i and i preach just what god's given me and it doesn't it does it's not doing anything for me i'll just preach it and that'll be the very service somebody will come and say you said word for word what we talked about on the way to church it was like you were in our home amen and all i can say is i don't know i was in the back crying i didn't want to preach i wanted to play a tape you understand when we can get to the place where we recognize it's not us it's him but when we recognize it's him and let it be him and get with his program and say what he said say and do what he said do we'll see more and more and more when we quit waiting for the feelings to match when we quit waiting until we feel good to confess and feel good to preach feel good to pray when we can just get in the program and say it's not my life it is if i'm having the worst day of my life and this person wants to hear about god i'm going to let myself be dead and tell them about god i'm going to tell them there's a healer even if i'm sick in my body even if i'm suffering with symptoms i'm going to tell them there's a god who heals and i can lay hands on you and you'll be well because brother branham did it standing in the pulpit so sick he could hardly stand up but he was still doing what god told him to do it wasn't him it's not the individual it was god it was an amateur god upon the earth i want the same thing in my life where i look so to that life and that might be dead i could be troubled in my mind having problems at home financially and ruin whatever is going on but if there's somebody there and they ask a question i'm telling them about the word if they need prayer i'm laying hands on them and praying on for them because that's what we're here it's not the individual it's god it's the life on the inside it's not the outer man back to this quote and it's the rising of the sun but he's in us not with self-pride but in us our lives to prove he is alive and living in us if i can get myself out of the way so when william branham not even thought of and you not even thought of till we can see jesus glorified among us see him that's our desire see gives us quickening power and it gives us joy to know that we are with him both flesh and bone of him being the bride of him and seeing his same vindicated methods proving in us that he is now risen from the dead no wonder he said fear not for now notice we are redeemed by him and now risen with him that's what easter means to the people risen with him now we have his spirit in us the abstract deed fully paid no you don't say well i hope i make it you've already made it not i will make it i've already made it i never made it he made it for me see not me him well brother branham they say i don't care what they say there he made it for me that's all i want i'm caring about just want to see him manifested how can you do it call him down no he's in you how can i see him manifested how can i see him glorified amen all i want to do is seem glorified he said the only way he'll be glorified is to be glorified in you i want to see him glorified i want to see him manifest how will you do it call him down no you're not going to call him down he's in you see he's in you well then lord if i can get myself out of the way you can manifest how can you do it because you ordained us so all that the father has given me will come hallelujah let's turn together to john 14. john 14 and 6. jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him philip saith in him lord show us the father and it sufficeth us jesus said in them have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that has seen me had seen the father and how saith then show us the father believeth now not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works even jesus could get himself out of the way and notice it's not me but it's him that dwelleth in me it's not me to do with the words it's my father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works let's go down to verse 18. jesus says i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me because i live you shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you and then you can say it's not me that do the works it's christ that's in me in the message perfect faith i wanna i wanna pay close attention to this as we wind down to a close here perfect faith but jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect god in which he was if we live in a perfect faith of a christian oh my goodness let's read it again because this next statement is is one that blows us out of the water jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect god in which he was understand he was there god and flesh he said he believed in the perfect i had perfect faith and a perfect god in which he was now he's going to take it to the church and then take it to you and i if we lived in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are christ said to recognize what he was we have to recognize what we are if we can live in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are we'd be a mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you would not do then the people begin to say you'd be a mystic person to them that's the way it is to all believers they're a mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't understand them when he spoke to them they say they say this and then they said why you talking riddles we don't understand this how can this be see they wasn't in the world that he lived in they couldn't understand them nobody could understand them and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now you're getting into bride material so how do you get in the bride material let's read it again when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now you're getting into bride material see you're getting into raptured condition rapturing condition now that means for each one of us not just the pastor deacon's trustees that means for the laity every individual walks in a world with god alone you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere you walk right on if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same now you're coming into perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail then that faith never fails yes he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now that those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others i want to be a mystic to the world i want them to know when the world is falling apart and the nation is failing and riots are breaking on the street i want them to know why are you humming that little tune why are you still smiling and waving at me when everybody has their head down and everybody's so distraught and we're so worried about what's going to happen next amen i'm not worried about what's going to happen next the next step is already ordered for me amen and i'm going to walk in that step by faith he who orders my steps has ordered my next step amen if the government collapses tomorrow if russia shows up on the border and sets a new government nothing's wrong with me can there be hardship yes could it be difficulty yes may we have to deal with things absolutely but there's nothing out of kilter nothing's wrong with me i'm still walking in the same world i walked in yesterday amen if everything changes amen and the 401 case fail and the stock market crashes and there's no more employment i want to walk in the same world before the crash that i walk in after the crash i don't want it to change my atmosphere my world amen the dimension that i choose to live in all those things affect the outer men but i do not want them to hinder the inner man let's go to galatians chapter 4. galatians chapter 4. i'm going to read verse 19. my little children whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you the apostle paul was travailing to try to get christ formed in the church because that was the goal christ formed in you christ in the church christ in the bride form paul started it paul desired it paul was laboring and travailing to get christ formed into the church now we've come to the end time with another prophet who has brought us to this realization of christ in you the hope of glory christ in the formation of the bride christ formed in you it's not i that liveth it's christ that dwelleth in me it's not my life it's his life amen it's not the old man that's dead but this is god there's an amateur god on the earth and it's not me my mind it's not me my emotions but but it's god amen it's the real me it's the portion of god he intended to be me it's alive on the earth it's christ formed in me and it creates its own atmosphere man and while i align with the word and i allow and i force my thoughts to match the word i reject every thought that doesn't match the word when i ignore my emotions when i ignore my symptoms and i stick with the word amen it's creating an atmosphere all around i want to read this last quote and then there's the rising of the sun brother is praying and he says in the mechanics by going in the dynamics come from above the holy spirit and catch them away lord quicken their mortal body then we shall hear genuine new tongues powers of god love untold dying grace and living grace and a resurrected christ a body a bride representing him on earth what's that what is the resurrected christ a body a bride representing him on earth this is the rising of the sun this is the resurrection it's not the it's god it's not you it's the god on the inside of you we have to say what the word says deny the old man stay in that creative atmosphere of power all the time let's finish with second thessalonians 2 thessalonians chapter 1 we'll read this as the musicians make their way up and brother ben let's read this together thessalonians 2 thessalonians chapter 1 verse 11. therefore also we pray always for you that our god would count you worthy of this calling and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness in the work of faith with power that the name of our lord jesus christ may be glorified in you and ye in him i in you you and me in that day you shall know i am the father the father me i in you and you and me and in this day the name of our lord jesus may be glorified in you and ye in him according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ i said god help me to create an atmosphere by the spoken word god is still god has still set us in free moral agency he's still given us the ability to choose what we will speak choose what we accept as thoughts and if we can choose the word we will see the rise of immature gods upon me if god gets all the credit and god gets all the glory and i can let myself be nothing to william branham or chad lamb or anybody else has not even thought of but it's christ glorified it's the word amen front and center then we're going to see more of the supernatural of god because god will not share his glory with any man he's not going to do something to vindicate you so that you can feel special about yourself he's going to fulfill his purpose his word and he's going to keep it for his own glory when we can get in that same channel of thinking so it's all about him and not about us it's not about having the right ministry or the right church or being the right person amen it's just about him it's about the word it's about professing the word claiming the word walking in the word creating an atmosphere of power it'll change it'll change circumstances all around us friends we have the power to create an atmosphere we create brother ben said we create the atmosphere we live in let's all stand i'd like to say tonight if you're not happy with the atmosphere you're living in change oh initially the devil will be like how can you change it's because of your parents it's because of your husband it's because of your wife it's because brother branham said you create the atmosphere you live in if you're not happy with the atmosphere you live in create a new one how do i do it never speak a negative thought and never let a negative confession come out of your mouth speak the word and let the word create the atmosphere we live in such a world in such a society that and it's getting more complex it's getting more perplexed that when they come into an atmosphere that's not afraid that's not nervous that's not scared that's not worried about the future i'm telling you friends that is going to stand out more and more and more as the days progress you thought that we just walked through this life and weren't noticed and nobody paid attention to us you let things keep going the way they're going and let the bride keep going the direction she's going it's going to be a standout crowd they're going to want to know why you know isn't this horrible what's going on you say you know what's going on the world is horrible but what's going on in christ is wonderful what's going on in me is marvelous amen what god is doing with me is fantastic and you're going to have somebody's interest friends because all that's around them is death and sorrow and trouble amen but the bride is not going down she's going up he's creating an atmosphere let us speak that atmosphere and let's sing that song greater is he that is in me amen let's sing it with revelation it's not me it's he that's in me brother ben reader is he that is he that is isn't me then he that is in the world oh yes greater is he that isn't me oh greater is he that is in greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world oh satan's like a roaring light roaming to and fro seeking whom he may devour the bible tells me so oh many souls have been his prey to fall in some week out but god has given us just today his overcoming power oh greater is he that isn't me oh greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world oh on the day of pentecost a rushing mighty way o blew into the upper room and baptized all of them with the power and i'm so glad i've got it too i'm gonna let the whole world know oh greater is he that is in me oh greater is he that is then he that is in the world oh yes greater is he that isn't me oh great is he that isn't me than he that is in the world amen we say all the time i want to witness i want to be a witness i want to witness this message you just be happy be joyful thank god for the revelation of the hour sing when nobody else feels like seeing you sing when you don't feel like singing keep your mind stayed on him think of the hour that we live in think of the tremendous things that he's revealing think of the power that's being poured out with the opening of the word amen and sing and sing with gusto sing from your heart sing with joy focus on those things and speak them out this is this is the greatest time to be alive say that right amen when you when you get a big dose of the news and all the gloom and the doom and the horrible things that are happening i mean you can't help from it affecting your spirit and it's troubling and it's violent and it's vulgar and and you can't help it be troubled but if you want to overcome that spirit you get back to the revelation of the day and say there's never been a day like this day this is the hour to be alive amen prophets and wise men is long to see this day and i get to be alive in it it's not about storming the capitol building it's about returning back to my inheritance it's about everything that i lost being restored to me how can i be troubled when everything's been promised to come back it's been restored redemption has come full circle it just depends on what we're looking what we're looking is what we reflect if we look at and focus on trouble and problems we're going to reflect back troubles and problems but oh if we could be the woman elisha amen saw a woman a shunammite woman who made a room for him and and she had no child and by the by the ministry of elijah she receives a child a promised word amen manifest in her life and then that child dies and she has no place to go but back to the place that gave her this life back to the word for her day back to the manifestation of that hour she saddles a mule and she goes rioting after and she comes to a license and elijah says is all well she says all is well oh i want to live that way that's my desire i i'm not where i want to be i'm not what i ought to be but thank god i'm not what i used to be but i want to get to the place that no matter what the condition is in the natural my confession is all as well all is well everything is as it should be god is good he's on the throne he's in my life i'm redeemed i'm a child of god and all is well i'm blessed beyond measure by the truth that he's revealed to me i've seen my inheritance i'm going to it in full measure i don't care amen what i have to pass through in this life it's not going to take that joy from me you want to be a witness in this day you keep your eyes centered on christ in the revelation of this word and your life will be a testimony your life will be a witness when you smile and you wave and you say god bless you and you say please and you say thank you when your children are happy not troubled when you as a family are are happy together they're going to wonder what's going on they're going to through the same things i'm going through but it affects them different because there's a creator on the inside an amateur god that's creating a different atmosphere and that's the atmosphere that i want to live in i choose to live in and if i choose to live in i'm going to exercise my free moral agency and i'm going to speak the word that matches this word so that i can stay in that atmosphere amen let's just bow our heads and pray
