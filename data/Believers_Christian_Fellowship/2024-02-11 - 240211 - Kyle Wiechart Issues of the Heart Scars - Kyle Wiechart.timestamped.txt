[16:27] all the time and you would think I'd get
[16:29] over that I just can't seem to get over
[16:31] that and and um I'm not the same man
[16:34] that was here the last time you know I
[16:35] had a birthday I'm
[16:37] 40 I'm
[16:40] old thank you thank you it's like uh
[16:43] congratulations you made it to the
[16:45] pulpit good job out of you you know you
[16:47] didn't get lost along the way you got
[16:49] enough strength to stand um they used to
[16:51] say 50s over the hill but I don't know
[16:53] how that math Works he said 70 and 80
[16:55] was strength so my math is right
[16:59] I'm going downhill now so so you pray
[17:02] for me I may get tired I may forget my
[17:05] words forget my thoughts but you just be
[17:07] praying for me uh just wanted to say how
[17:09] much I love you and I appreciate you um
[17:12] I was thinking about yesterday I was
[17:14] like you know I I get to thinking about
[17:15] the attributes of God you know as a kid
[17:18] I was like oh if I could just be with
[17:19] the people that you know I knew that
[17:21] they loved God and and I knew that they
[17:23] were God's chosen people how wonderful
[17:25] it would be to just be a part of them
[17:27] you know just to be with them not that I
[17:29] think I would add anything to you I know
[17:31] I'm a net negative I probably take away
[17:33] but it's always been um a a great desire
[17:36] of me to just be with a a people that
[17:38] love God and um I believe I am I believe
[17:41] I am I was getting to thinking about
[17:43] different faces you know in different
[17:44] names and I was thinking oh my that
[17:46] quality of Christ that I see in that
[17:47] person you know that that patience of of
[17:50] job sometimes or that Joy sister Joyce
[17:53] not saying any names but nonetheless the
[17:55] joy of the Lord or some of those
[17:57] different characters and those
[17:58] characteristics of Christ that's amongst
[18:00] the body and and you all are just making
[18:02] up that body of the body of Christ with
[18:05] all of those wonderful characteristics
[18:07] and and it's been a tremendous honor for
[18:09] me to be able to be a part of that body
[18:12] and um sometimes you can maybe uh get
[18:14] too focused on what we don't have and
[18:16] then you can get down and often times
[18:19] you got to stop thinking about what you
[18:20] don't have and start considering what
[18:21] you do have and then it gets real
[18:24] special to you you know and so we we
[18:27] need one another I know that now more
[18:29] than ever before that every one of us
[18:32] that's in the body is necessary we all
[18:35] are going to need each other even more
[18:37] as the evil day is approaching I believe
[18:39] that's why the Lord said draw yourselves
[18:41] together assemble yourselves together
[18:43] even more cuz we're going to find out we
[18:46] need all of us every one of us is
[18:49] necessary and needed and I know that I'm
[18:52] perfecting you and I know you're
[18:54] perfecting me and I think that's just
[18:57] all part of the plan the great mystery
[18:59] secret that God had in his mind he's
[19:01] still building up
[19:03] masterpieces and uh I'm just so thankful
[19:06] for that so I have a I have a lot of um
[19:10] not well organized thoughts woohoo
[19:13] nothing new there um but I so I just I
[19:17] just pray you'd help me to just deliver
[19:19] my heart my soul um lot of inspiration
[19:22] it's amazing to me amount of inspiration
[19:24] I went outside for a walk and then
[19:26] Carrie had to call me she's like where
[19:27] are you I'd been walking around in a
[19:29] circle for an hour and 45
[19:31] minutes just lost in a thought and um it
[19:34] that was what um I made me go this
[19:36] direction I thought I would I brother
[19:38] Chad called me Thursday and I think
[19:40] brother Brian we were talking you I
[19:42] thought he asked me Wednesday night he
[19:44] says you know um you going to minister
[19:46] on that thought for the Youth I said
[19:48] yeah I think so but some reason I'm
[19:49] having this inspiration before service
[19:52] start writing down
[19:53] notes that's how it works for me and I
[19:55] said so I'm a little nervous now all of
[19:57] a sudden maybe I'm not supposed to
[19:58] Minister that to youth maybe I don't
[19:59] know I have to pray about it and then
[20:00] brother Chad
[20:01] calls the next day I says well maybe I
[20:06] couldn't say no cuz I was like uhoh I
[20:08] had
[20:09] inspiration scary it's scary and
[20:12] inspiration is such a weird thing
[20:14] ministers know it it's it's it's not
[20:16] something you produce it's not something
[20:18] it's like it comes out of you and you
[20:20] just got to write it down it's it's such
[20:22] like a I think like a person who writes
[20:23] a song it's it's not like you're trying
[20:25] to construct a song it's like it's
[20:26] you're just capturing the song you're
[20:28] just trying to write it down and and
[20:30] deliver it the way God gave it to you
[20:32] and that's kind of the same way with me
[20:33] I just get this inspiration and I get a
[20:35] feeling and I I write down some notes
[20:37] and it's like a generalized Direction
[20:39] with absolutely no detail which scares
[20:41] me to death um and and that's that's
[20:44] just how it works and I um I always
[20:47] believed that the sons of God are just
[20:49] led by the spirit of God they're not
[20:51] real well organized they're just
[20:53] spirit-led and I I I I believe that's
[20:56] part of a maturing son is just resting
[20:58] in the fact that God is leading and
[21:00] guiding his children you know we were
[21:03] predestinated unto adoption and I'm my
[21:06] my message is not adoption today well it
[21:08] probably is to a part but um but when I
[21:10] was thinking about that predestinated
[21:11] there's an end point I'm coming to a
[21:14] place that he predetermined that I was
[21:16] going to come to despite
[21:18] myself and he let you make so many
[21:20] mistakes along the way and it's all part
[21:24] of the plan he can't take away your free
[21:26] moral agency he lets you make decisions
[21:28] and sometimes those decisions are bad
[21:30] decisions just like Abraham he was
[21:32] supposed to stay in the land and then a
[21:34] famine came and he goes down to guer but
[21:35] it all fit the plan God was going to get
[21:38] his man right where he needed him to be
[21:40] at just the right time and what the
[21:42] devil intends for evil God works it all
[21:44] for good so then we can just rest say
[21:48] Thank you lord it's an amazing grace
[21:50] that started this work and it's an
[21:51] amazing grace it's going to bring me to
[21:53] the maturity of a son and so I feel a
[21:57] little bit more relaxed why don't you
[21:59] stand now amen hope that's
[22:02] okay if you only knew how nervous I get
[22:05] it's horrible it's a
[22:07] torture would you turn in your Bibles to
[22:10] proverbs
[22:11] 4 proverbs
[22:17] 4 and you you're going to love me if we
[22:19] go all over the place right you're still
[22:21] going okay I needed to hear it I need to
[22:23] hear these things um because we will be
[22:29] Proverbs 4:
[22:32] 20 going to read two portions of
[22:35] scripture it says my son attend to my
[22:38] words and incline thine ear unto my
[22:41] sayings let them not depart from thine
[22:44] eyes and keep them in the midst of thine
[22:47] heart for the for they are life unto
[22:50] those that find them and they are Health
[22:52] to all their flesh keep thy heart with
[22:56] all diligence for or out of it are the
[22:59] issues of
[23:01] life now please turn in your Bibles to
[23:04] Ecclesiastes chapters 3 verse
[23:22] 1 just say Amen when you're there
[23:26] am
[23:29] the word of God says to everything there
[23:31] is a season and a time to every purpose
[23:35] Under the Sun a time to be born and a
[23:38] time to die a time to plant and a time
[23:41] to pluck up that which is planted A Time
[23:44] to Kill a time to heal a time to break
[23:48] down and a time to build up a time to
[23:51] weep A Time To Laugh A Time to mourn and
[23:54] a time to dance a time to Cast Away
[23:57] stones stones and a time to gather
[23:59] Stones together A Time To Remember of
[24:02] embrace and a time to refrain from
[24:05] embracing a time to get a time to lose a
[24:09] time to keep and a time to Cast
[24:12] Away a time to Rend and a time to sew a
[24:18] time to keep silence and a time to speak
[24:22] a time to love and a time to hate and a
[24:25] time of war and a time of peace
[24:28] what profit hath he that worketh in that
[24:31] wherein he labor Earth I have seen the
[24:33] travail which God hath given to the sons
[24:37] of men to be exercised in it he hath
[24:41] made everything beautiful in his
[24:44] time you may have your seats may God add
[24:47] His blessings to the
[24:51] word
[24:53] so the last time that I actually
[24:56] ministered from EES eclesiastes was
[24:59] middle of Co and I was thinking of that
[25:02] and uh this uh I just got drawn back to
[25:05] this again and you know that was a time
[25:07] where uh I think it was a good testing
[25:09] time for each and every one of us our
[25:11] American rights were being tested and we
[25:14] were uh struggling I was struggling with
[25:16] the fact that what do you mean I can't
[25:17] assemble with the Saints what do you
[25:18] mean I I got to put on a mask what do
[25:21] you mean this uh social distancing the
[25:23] very word of it puts Terror into our
[25:25] heart social distancing you know all of
[25:27] these things became a a
[25:30] prevalent test of my will and uh at the
[25:34] time I I was meditating on that I was
[25:36] like you don't have a right to tell me
[25:38] this stuff you going to tell I'm a
[25:40] Christian we we are the sons and
[25:42] daughter of God if we want to assemble
[25:44] if we want to hug if we want to not wear
[25:46] a mask who are you to tell us then I
[25:49] came across the
[25:52] quote and brother brandham says you know
[25:55] a lamb forfeits all its rights
[25:58] he said real Lambs forfeit their rights
[26:01] we have rights nobody can deny them but
[26:04] the lamb forfeits its rights as American
[26:07] you have rights but we're not Americans
[26:10] we're Christians our kingdom is from
[26:13] above and so we know the nature of the
[26:16] Lamb if it's present forfeits its
[26:19] rights and that's where I had come
[26:21] across this scripture and at that time
[26:23] it was a real check for me I thought oh
[26:26] my I've been wrong
[26:28] I was wrong I was exercising my American
[26:31] rights and denying my Christian rights
[26:34] because my rights get forfeited that's
[26:36] the plan and it's just you're you're
[26:39] just never going to separate a cross
[26:40] from Christianity it's a constant
[26:42] bearing the cross and I think as time
[26:45] goes on it becomes something that it
[26:47] comes from something that's like you
[26:48] don't want to Bear the cross to
[26:50] something you you embrace you you you
[26:52] hug it up a little closer to you uh and
[26:55] you begin to learn to love the very
[26:57] thing um that draws you to him and at
[27:00] this time I was considering this time to
[27:03] Rend and a time to sew a time to keep
[27:06] silence and a time to speak and that was
[27:09] a time where
[27:11] um I think I had I had thought taken a
[27:14] thought where um the bride's time to
[27:17] stand yeah that's what it was and uh boy
[27:20] I wanted to say something but sometimes
[27:22] when you want to say something you need
[27:23] to learn to be
[27:25] quiet and then there's times when uh you
[27:29] you want to be quiet and it's time to
[27:30] say
[27:31] something and I think that's just the
[27:34] part of learning to walk as a Son of God
[27:37] and just learning to follow the leading
[27:39] of the Holy
[27:40] Spirit and um in considering all of
[27:43] these things I had a subject that I'd
[27:45] like to discuss and I titled it the
[27:48] issues of the heart issues of the heart
[27:52] and as a subtitle
[27:55] scars and um
[27:58] I'm not a rocket scientist by any means
[28:00] but I I kind of have a feeling I shared
[28:02] it with brother Ben I think God's doing
[28:03] heart
[28:04] surgery for each and every one of us I
[28:06] hope I'm not the only one that's going
[28:08] through this I've began to notice here
[28:11] in the last few months that um God's
[28:14] going deep he's going real deep and
[28:17] going into some doors that maybe we all
[28:20] shut and uh we didn't want to have
[28:23] exposed you know we want God to save us
[28:25] brother bam said we want him to save us
[28:27] but we don't want him to get in messing
[28:28] with our private life we got all these
[28:30] little doors in our heart that he we
[28:32] don't want God to get in there Pride
[28:34] selfishness you know all those things
[28:36] don't go in there Lord I want you to
[28:38] save me but I really don't want you to
[28:40] be Lord see Lord has rulership and
[28:43] dominion over every aspect of it and and
[28:46] it's been pretty safe to say um I think
[28:49] heart surgery's been happening here
[28:50] lately for each and every one of us and
[28:53] it certainly has for me and uh so I
[28:56] could identify with brother Ben I sent
[28:58] him a text I said hey if you're going to
[28:59] get a a cardboard cut out just get a two
[29:01] for one deal grab one for me that'll be
[29:04] fine I can sit there with you because I
[29:06] was indicted too and sometimes you just
[29:09] got to take the punches right brother
[29:11] Ben and I found it interesting cuz the
[29:13] last time I was talking here on that
[29:15] last step of adoption was I said it's
[29:18] painful it's just painful it's hard
[29:21] nobody wants to be hurt nobody wants to
[29:24] expose wounds nobody wants to go to some
[29:27] something that you may be trying to
[29:28] cover up it's just
[29:30] painful and uh we all have
[29:34] scars right I hope I'm not the only one
[29:39] I've got scars I got one I'm looking at
[29:40] right now my wonderful dog that I just
[29:43] had to put down sadly bit me he left me
[29:47] a gift a few years ago I think I even
[29:50] mentioned it here it's the one scar that
[29:52] I have and I can see it now I appreciate
[29:54] him he left me a gift to remind me of
[29:56] how Wonder wonderful of a dog he was I
[29:59] think I talked about it here we got him
[30:00] at the pound we thought he was three we
[30:01] found out he was like seven or eight we
[30:03] thought he could bark he couldn't bark
[30:05] found out his teeth are falling out his
[30:07] hips are caving in he can't walk I and
[30:09] then he bit me and I'm like you're not
[30:11] adding any value to my
[30:12] life you're a net negative you're taking
[30:15] away after you bit me I'm like do you
[30:17] not realize like I rescued
[30:20] you you would have been put to sleep by
[30:23] now if I wouldn't have come on the scene
[30:24] nobody wants a old worn out dog except
[30:27] us we got an old worn out
[30:29] dog but I you know I was considering
[30:32] this Scar and when I had spoke on it
[30:34] here that scar came as a result of me
[30:37] him biting me um when I was I was trying
[30:40] to help him out the poor fella bad hips
[30:42] old worn out trying to move him over
[30:44] closer to the furnace cuz he was by the
[30:45] door and he bit me and I got furious at
[30:49] that dog he latched down on my hand
[30:51] wouldn't let go I'm yelling at him I
[30:53] might have been tapping him on the head
[30:54] a little bit just please let go of
[30:59] me sorry for those who really love
[31:01] animals I it was I it wasn't conscious
[31:04] it was a reaction you know he finally
[31:07] let go and uh and I thought you dirty
[31:11] dog you I'm trying to help you I was
[31:15] sincere I was trying to drag him over to
[31:18] where it was warmer and he was laying on
[31:20] his bed and and I I really felt
[31:23] justified in what I was doing and then I
[31:25] got to thinking about him and I was like
[31:27] ah you know what that poor guy we know
[31:30] he was beaten we know he was mistreated
[31:32] as a dog cuz he never trusted me ever
[31:36] well yeah never trust barely trusted
[31:39] Carrie kind of like the girls but he was
[31:41] always nervous you move make a move he
[31:43] would cow maybe show his teeth a little
[31:45] bit he just something was wrong he had
[31:46] been wounded in earlier in life and he
[31:49] was cautious around any man he just
[31:52] you're going to hurt me too I know how
[31:55] this goes and uh so you know I got the
[31:59] feeling like he was feeling I was like
[32:00] you know what I invaded his space I
[32:03] tried to help him and he's like you know
[32:04] what this is the only place I feel safe
[32:06] in my little bed and here I am I'm
[32:08] trying to help him out but I didn't
[32:10] realize he just didn't trust me and he
[32:12] bit me so then I was like Wow poor guy I
[32:16] got to feeling the way he
[32:18] felt and uh it's just interesting we
[32:22] have scars in our lives I got scars but
[32:25] I there's lessons from scars
[32:27] every scar that you go through in life
[32:29] not just natural but spiritual scars
[32:32] then there's lessons to be learned in
[32:35] them and um you
[32:38] know when when the Bible says here
[32:41] there's a season there's a time in our
[32:43] life there's times where it's good and
[32:44] there's times when it's just not good
[32:47] there's sunny days and there's cloudy
[32:49] days don't be shocked that's part of a
[32:52] plan um I've I've had many times where
[32:56] God was close I've I've had many times
[32:57] where he seemed so far away I've had
[33:00] times where I felt I had great victory
[33:02] in my life and then there's other times
[33:04] I felt like I am just a miserable
[33:05] failure good for nothing I should just
[33:07] find a
[33:09] bridge I'm human if I I hope I hope that
[33:12] doesn't sound too crazy that's
[33:14] legitimate amen um I've often had that I
[33:18] I I don't add value I'm not creating
[33:21] help I if I'm not helping any what I'm
[33:22] wasting
[33:24] space you feel like that sometimes
[33:29] and um and then the question is it's
[33:31] like why do you feel like that what
[33:33] makes a person feel that way you
[33:37] know um Jeremiah says the hardest
[33:41] deceitfully Wicked Above All Things
[33:43] desperately wicked and who can know it
[33:47] who can know it do you know who knows it
[33:49] I don't know your heart nobody else in
[33:51] here knows your heart God knows your
[33:53] heart amen there's one that knows my
[33:56] heart yeah there's only one that's
[33:57] qualified to do heart surgery that's
[33:59] Jesus Christ that's the word of God
[34:03] because Hebrews says the word of God is
[34:05] quick and it's powerful sharper than a
[34:06] two-edged sword a piercing and a
[34:09] dividing aend of the soul and the spirit
[34:11] of the joints and the marrow and he's a
[34:13] discerner of the thoughts and the
[34:14] intents of the
[34:16] heart that's what cuts me that's what
[34:20] cuts me and so a few weeks ago when
[34:23] brother Chad was preaching the twin
[34:25] Within was I the only one that was cut
[34:29] oh my goodness I will be honest honest I
[34:33] was smoked so hard in my heart I was
[34:36] smoked I was cut wide
[34:39] open because my failure at times is I'm
[34:42] able and we all are good at this we're
[34:44] able to identify Esau's and others at
[34:48] the same
[34:49] time avoiding your
[34:52] own it's true it's easy to see the two
[34:56] natures
[34:57] many times you've seen it in me I mean I
[35:00] if Paul says oh Wretched Man that I am
[35:03] who are we to boast like we are nothing
[35:07] oh my goodness we think we're that great
[35:10] you are nothing if the grace I'll tell
[35:13] you what if the grace of God hadn't come
[35:15] my way I promise you promise you I
[35:20] promise you I wouldn't have a family and
[35:22] I would probably be on the brink of
[35:24] insanity I would be self-medicating
[35:26] myself
[35:27] to the point of maybe even gone and I'm
[35:30] not making that up that is 100% the
[35:34] direction I was going 100% And if it
[35:37] wasn't for the grace in your life you
[35:38] would too you would totally be out of
[35:41] your mind in this crazy age that we live
[35:44] in so I have so much compassion for
[35:46] those that are around like what do you
[35:48] expect the world to do in this insane
[35:50] age that we're living in don't get upset
[35:53] because they're self-medicating give
[35:54] them some medicine of the Gospel maybe
[35:57] that will help them I don't know but my
[35:59] goodness I certainly don't look down
[36:01] upon someone that drinks themselves to
[36:02] sleep every night just to cope through
[36:05] life amen cuz you shouldn't feel like
[36:07] you shouldn't feel any better than that
[36:09] but by the grace of God there go I and
[36:12] there go you right faster than a plane
[36:14] can cut through the
[36:16] sky that's just a
[36:18] reality and so I was so smoked in my
[36:22] heart CU I had failed I had failed
[36:28] and I want to say this cuz it's it's
[36:31] been on my mind for a long time Jesus
[36:32] said I shared it with brother Jeremy the
[36:35] Bible says if I be lifted up I will draw
[36:37] all men unto
[36:39] me and I got to thinking about this a
[36:41] year or so ago I I I don't know a couple
[36:43] years ago I says you know what how was
[36:45] he lifted up before all men on a
[36:48] cross he was lifted up on a cross and
[36:53] nobody put it on nobody put him on that
[36:55] he chose it
[36:58] himself he said no one takes my life
[37:01] from me I Lay My Life down for
[37:04] others and when they lifted him up on
[37:07] the cross that so inspired a people what
[37:11] looked to be a great we'll say defeat
[37:15] was actually the greatest victory that
[37:18] had ever been
[37:19] seen a man had the capability to deliver
[37:23] himself didn't a man who could have
[37:26] defend himself chose not to a man who
[37:29] could have changed the scene with one
[37:31] little finger said no I'm not going to
[37:34] do
[37:35] it but he did it for you and for me he
[37:38] didn't do it without a reason he had a
[37:40] reason in doing it oh yeah he had
[37:42] somebody on his mind it was
[37:44] me and so I began to think of that
[37:47] lifting up on a cross and brother
[37:49] brandham says he'll lift her up to show
[37:52] she had the
[37:53] goods and I've often thought about that
[37:55] you know none of us we always want to
[37:57] think it's going to be a glorious thing
[37:58] it's going to be wonderful it's going to
[37:59] be fantastic I'm going to look great
[38:01] you're going to look great everybody's
[38:02] going to know we are the sons of
[38:06] God you know what's beautiful in the
[38:08] eyes of God is horrendous in the eyes of
[38:11] men it didn't look like a beautiful
[38:14] Victory there with a mangled up face and
[38:16] blood running all over him stripped
[38:18] naked and humiliated and it didn't look
[38:21] like a great
[38:23] Victory but brother B said it was the
[38:25] most Sublime thing in
[38:27] history when a bloody lamb came and took
[38:30] the book amen most Sublime thing in
[38:34] history and so I I think if we're going
[38:36] to rule and reign with
[38:38] him I think we're going to have to know
[38:41] as he knows as Paul said that I may know
[38:44] him and the fellowship of his
[38:47] sufferings and that I may be conformed
[38:50] into the image of his dear
[38:51] son and so as I've looked at this I
[38:55] realized oh oh my goodness I failed you
[38:59] as a people often times I find and I can
[39:02] see so clearly something that's
[39:05] wrong I can see it I'm like that's
[39:08] wrong and little did I know you can see
[39:10] me and say that's
[39:12] wrong but we have that
[39:15] ability and instead of doing what I'm
[39:18] supposed to
[39:20] do and the scripture says if you see a
[39:22] brother in awe or fault you who are
[39:25] spiritual right brother Gage you're
[39:27] spiritual go to such a one and talk to
[39:30] him sorry this is rubber meat's Road for
[39:33] a moment Lord and
[39:36] um you're not spiritual because you can
[39:39] identify a problem and tell everybody
[39:41] about it don't make you
[39:43] spiritual what makes you spiritual is
[39:46] you have the maturity and love of God in
[39:48] your heart for that man and for God to
[39:51] be able to go to him and just say can we
[39:55] talk that's
[39:57] spiritual that's a real spiritual
[39:59] brother not to be able to point
[40:01] fingers but to go help
[40:04] somebody and I began to point fingers
[40:07] and that's where I
[40:09] failed and I had to make some things
[40:12] right I had to call some brothers up and
[40:15] uh say I was wrong please forgive me
[40:19] listen to brother Chad's you know this
[40:21] twin within it's okay brother Chad I'm
[40:23] sorry I'm just being honest that twin
[40:27] within
[40:28] and and I'm like oh my goodness I
[40:31] couldn't see my own
[40:32] twin I couldn't see that Esau in me gee
[40:37] and for months I've been looking at the
[40:38] two Spirits so close it would deceive
[40:40] the elect of God if it was possible and
[40:41] you know who can deceive you greater
[40:44] than anybody else it's
[40:47] you you can deceive yourself like nobody
[40:50] ever could deceive yourself you begin to
[40:52] thinking you're pretty good I'm
[40:55] something like brother Ben I think Mary
[40:56] Magdalene she think she's pretty pretty
[40:58] yeah I am pretty pretty now I don't
[41:00] think I'm pretty pretty but you know
[41:01] that brother Brian we ain't pretty just
[41:04] being honest everybody knows that we
[41:05] ain't pretty but sometimes you get to
[41:07] thinking I'm doing pretty good I'm not
[41:10] too bad God let me see some things and
[41:12] he's if I see things and that brother
[41:14] doesn't see I must have favor with God
[41:15] you know I'm
[41:17] something and I ain't nothing amen it's
[41:20] just a trap just a trap make you think
[41:24] you're something
[41:26] and
[41:28] so confession was good for the soul you
[41:32] make things right when you do
[41:34] wrong and because I realized if I love
[41:37] someone right if I love them the right
[41:41] way I'll I'll go to them but if I love
[41:44] myself more than the brother I'll say
[41:48] nothing I'll sit back and say he's
[41:54] off right it's just not right amen I
[41:58] mean we're going to like brother Ben
[42:00] said if we're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[42:01] better act like it yeah don't sit back
[42:04] here and say look at me look at me I'm
[42:05] the bride I'm the bride just don't say
[42:06] nothing let's see it in
[42:08] action let's see it in action had John
[42:11] Wesley on my mind where he was saying
[42:12] you know he went to he was going to
[42:14] bring the gospel to the natives here in
[42:16] America and he left a failure tail
[42:18] between his legs he knew he hadn't he
[42:20] didn't have anything to offer him and he
[42:23] saw some Arabians there storm raging you
[42:26] know he's afraid for his
[42:29] life and I don't think he heard a sermon
[42:31] he looked over and he saw those Moravian
[42:34] children and mothers happy Not
[42:38] Afraid nothing he's like they got
[42:40] something real they don't got words they
[42:44] got a life they got something real that
[42:47] Expresses in the midst of Storms and I'm
[42:50] convinced God brings some storms
[42:52] sometimes real solid storms just just to
[42:56] shake you up see if you got what you
[42:58] think you got amen really you need that
[43:02] we don't need to be told how great we
[43:03] are I need to be told How Far We've
[43:06] fallen short and if it wasn't for his
[43:09] grace we got nothing to stand
[43:12] on so I uh I told you I'm all over here
[43:18] we go I'm on
[43:20] pivot I had a uh here's what's so odd to
[43:23] me um about five years ago
[43:26] I started having really bad back pain
[43:28] only some brothers know and I I shoot a
[43:32] pain when I'd go to stand up shoot pain
[43:34] when I'd sit
[43:35] down and I couldn't run no more if I go
[43:38] to run my back would hurt so bad I mean
[43:40] for two days I could barely move you
[43:42] know just bad couldn't lift real well
[43:45] couldn't you I go to turn and pick up my
[43:48] I could barely pick up Ellie I strained
[43:50] to pick her up during service that was
[43:52] about 5 years ago and I'd started
[43:54] wasting a bunch of money going to a a
[43:56] lot of different chiropractors and
[43:57] trying a lot of different things and
[43:59] nothing seemed to fix it and uh so odd
[44:02] about this was brother Elmer was tell me
[44:04] about a chiropractor a few weeks ago
[44:05] hope stay with me there's a meaning
[44:07] behind it amen I told you I'm weird and
[44:11] um I went over to that chiropractor and
[44:14] he spent an hour and a half with me
[44:15] which is a shocker you you don't usually
[44:18] see that someone that actually cares um
[44:21] but he wasn't there to do a quick fix
[44:22] and try to treat a symptom he really
[44:24] wanted to find why
[44:26] what's the problem here why is your
[44:29] lower back a problem why is your neck a
[44:32] problem why are you having knee pain
[44:34] started doing a bunch of checks like a
[44:35] good doctor does to diagnose the case
[44:38] and he got down he says had me take off
[44:40] my shirt he was going to look at
[44:42] everything he said what's wrong with
[44:43] your rib cage I said I have no
[44:45] idea and he says well you got a bulge
[44:49] like a muscle bulge and I said well
[44:50] that's where I have these spasms you
[44:52] know I was told I went to the hospital
[44:54] when I was a kid I was told those are
[44:55] muscle lung
[44:56] spasms he says there is no such thing as
[44:59] a muscle lung spasm he said you mean a
[45:01] diaphragm spasm I said I think I don't
[45:03] know that's what they told me he said
[45:05] that's a diaphragm P he said I've done
[45:07] this 20 years I ain't never seen this
[45:09] and he says huh he said well don't be
[45:13] upset he said we can fix this he said
[45:15] that's why your back and neck's messed
[45:16] up I go you serious like I have these
[45:19] spasms every year he said yeah he said I
[45:22] told him what happened I was a kid I was
[45:24] lifting a bunch of stuff heavy we bued
[45:26] up a bunch of concrete with Dad and I
[45:27] was loading it out and every day we did
[45:29] this we hauled it to a dump we didn't
[45:31] was before Bobcats we didn't have the
[45:32] money for that we just did it by hand
[45:34] and and I ripped that diaphragm muscle
[45:38] or partially tore the my diaphragm in my
[45:40] chest from lifting those heavy
[45:42] concrete and they took me to the
[45:44] hospital I couldn't breathe or nothing
[45:46] and um ever since then about once a year
[45:49] I get a spasm because it's a weak spot
[45:52] and I can't breathe because it's like a
[45:53] charlie horse in your chest a lot of fun
[45:56] and
[45:57] um he goes okay he says this makes sense
[46:00] now he goes all right he says see what
[46:03] happened was you were wounded as a kid
[46:06] down here real deep and your body to
[46:08] protect that weakness that sore spot it
[46:12] sent a bunch of nutrients there to
[46:14] rebuild it but it it kept doing it to
[46:16] cover up the space you build up too much
[46:17] scar
[46:18] tissue and you've got so much Scar
[46:21] Tissue built up here in your chest that
[46:23] it's literally pulling somehow it's
[46:26] pulling the muscles which is causing
[46:28] your vertebrae to be out of line
[46:29] constantly that's why he said they can
[46:31] go pop you in and you get pulled out
[46:33] immediately I was like well this is
[46:35] amazing I said what do we do he said we
[46:37] rip it
[46:38] apart he said it's painful I said do
[46:41] what you got to do so it made me lay on
[46:44] my belly and full grown heavy man makes
[46:48] me take in a deep breath expose those
[46:50] rib cage he starts jamming his hands
[46:52] down where that scar tissue is where
[46:53] that rib cage is and he's trying to rip
[46:55] it apart
[46:57] but it was the only way to solve the
[46:58] problem and you know what's weird it
[47:02] worked I literally have no back pain
[47:04] went skiing last week no back pain none
[47:08] zero
[47:10] zilch
[47:12] amazing so all this while I thought that
[47:15] this symptom in me this lower back pain
[47:17] and neck pain was uh that was the
[47:19] problem wasn't the problem right it was
[47:22] just a symptom of a deeper problem and
[47:24] the reality of it is in our life we have
[47:26] deep
[47:28] pains that cause us sometimes to act
[47:31] wrong do things wrong say things wrong
[47:35] treat people
[47:37] wrong and you want to somebody may say
[47:40] that's a simp no it it or that's the
[47:42] cause it's not the cause that's the
[47:43] symptom of something deeper than
[47:45] that and in this life we just there's
[47:48] there's lots of wounds we have lots of
[47:50] scars and we bear many pains sometimes
[47:53] things happen to you when you were a kid
[47:55] things people treated you certain way
[47:58] acted a certain way said something to
[48:00] you there's lots and lots of ways to get
[48:02] scarred up inside the
[48:04] heart deep wounds family problems
[48:08] anybody have family problem me and you
[48:10] brother
[48:11] Gabe family problems left little scars
[48:15] little wounded spots that I covered them

[48:20] up disappointments anybody in here been
[48:23] disappointed you thought your life was
[48:25] going to go this way and for some reason
[48:27] it went this way right big
[48:30] disappointments it's
[48:33] amazing
[48:35] criticism anybody love
[48:37] criticism ever been
[48:39] criticized said ah you'll never amount
[48:41] to anything ah good for
[48:45] nothing yeah nobody likes
[48:48] criticism
[48:50] rejected rejection
[48:52] complexes news flash I got one that's
[48:55] right
[48:58] yes ever been
[49:00] insulted ever been
[49:02] mocked ever been physically and verbally
[49:05] abused it's wounds deep
[49:09] Cuts they
[49:12] hurt you know where you get most of
[49:14] these
[49:15] wounds from the ones you love the most
[49:18] right where did Jesus get his wounds in
[49:20] the house of his
[49:22] friends that's where your deepest wounds
[49:24] come from right a close a mother a
[49:27] father a best
[49:30] friend situation at a church a
[49:33] fellowship with people you love that you
[49:35] would give your life for and something
[49:40] happens okay way too quiet any
[49:44] amens okay
[49:46] good I'm like I'm going to hide if
[49:48] nobody says
[49:51] amen but these wounds all serve a
[49:55] purpose
[49:57] I wonder how many times I have oh so
[50:00] many times so many times hundreds and
[50:03] hundreds of times I have sat alone and
[50:05] said why' that have to happen why' it
[50:08] have to go that way why did I do that
[50:12] why did I say
[50:13] that why didn't I do this why didn't I
[50:17] do that so many regrets so many
[50:21] situations that they kind of tilt you in
[50:23] a certain way and you wonder why you
[50:25] keep walking that way why you keep
[50:28] acting that way you don't even know
[50:30] sometimes right right
[50:34] like why did I why did my back hurt well
[50:38] something way down deep from years
[50:40] ago amen it just needed to be dealt
[50:44] with you know brother brandham said he
[50:47] said I have some scars from when I was a
[50:51] kid I know some things that had happened
[50:54] and it turned me and in a certain way
[50:57] but you see it was all God right making
[51:00] and molding me for this present
[51:04] hour we all sat and listened to the life
[51:06] story of brother brandom a couple weeks
[51:08] ago we saw the Deep scars and the
[51:11] effects it had on him yeah I mean if
[51:14] half of that would came your way we
[51:16] would have probably succeeded in blowing
[51:18] out our brains that's right and that's a
[51:21] reality of it so much pain so so much
[51:27] pain he said uh he said I've went
[51:30] through so much he said my heart has
[51:32] just got scars all over it Lord from so
[51:36] many hard battles I'm an old veteran
[51:39] Lord help me I need help that's
[51:42] right he said maybe all of this was for
[51:45] a purpose and I trust that it has been
[51:48] Lord but help
[51:51] me 1962 your prophet of God end of a
[51:55] sermon crying out for help no he had
[51:58] been really really cut up really hurt
[52:01] having a hard time staying on the
[52:03] battlefield saying Lord help me if you
[52:05] don't help me I can't do
[52:08] this welcome to being a Christian
[52:12] everybody this is just part of the
[52:14] Christian
[52:18] Life brother b or the Bible
[52:21] says oh I want to yeah David
[52:25] he says about David he says and when he
[52:28] had removed him he raised him up there a
[52:31] David to be king whom also he gave
[52:33] testimony and said I have found David a
[52:36] son of Jesse a man after my own heart
[52:39] which shall fulfill all my
[52:41] will and that's what I was doing on
[52:43] Wednesday I started writing down I was
[52:45] so drawn to David I just started writing
[52:47] down David's life and in looking at
[52:50] David's life a man who was called and
[52:52] anointed to be king went through so much
[52:57] pain I mean consider this he's a young
[53:00] man the prophet's coming he's going to
[53:02] choose a king of his own
[53:03] choosing and David's a part of the
[53:06] family and his own father doesn't even
[53:08] say have you considered David he forgets
[53:12] about David David oh yeah I have a son
[53:15] named David the prophet I'm going to
[53:17] pick one of your well surely it's this
[53:18] one surely it's that one surely his own
[53:21] father natural father didn't even think
[53:24] we
[53:25] good enough to be anything probably just
[53:27] stay out there and take care of the
[53:28] sheep boy good for nothing right
[53:31] literally that's probably what happened
[53:33] like you don't get that mindset of a
[53:34] father unless there's something going on
[53:37] like he didn't even consider David yeah
[53:41] and then as you know the prophet anoints
[53:44] him to be king he says you're going to
[53:46] you're going to be the next king of
[53:47] Israel and anoints him and his father
[53:50] his brothers thought so much of him that
[53:52] they made fun of him after he was
[53:54] anointed by the prophet oh you silly boy
[53:58] get out of here you and so his own
[54:00] brother's
[54:02] rejecting time goes on you know he God
[54:06] delivers Goliath into his hands and he
[54:10] loves The King The King loves him and
[54:12] then after a while the king hates him
[54:15] like jealousy hates him and tries to
[54:18] kill him and David did nothing wrong
[54:21] what did David do nothing he was
[54:24] constantly just trying could be a
[54:25] blessing but he hated him then he went
[54:30] for he had to run for his life just to
[54:32] stay alive he's on the Run Saul trying
[54:35] to kill him the whole
[54:37] time even delivers him into his hand one
[54:40] time God does and his soldiers say hey
[54:44] God delivered him into your hands take
[54:45] his
[54:46] life he said no I ain't going to touch
[54:48] the Lord's anointing he could have
[54:50] stopped it right there he said nope no
[54:53] it wouldn't be right
[54:56] I'm going to keep
[54:57] going then he becomes king and his own
[55:00] wife makes fun of him man ge now my
[55:05] wife you embarrass me praising God my
[55:09] own
[55:11] wife just keeps on
[55:14] going then his own people reject
[55:18] him but he loves the people so much he
[55:20] doesn't want to have the people killed
[55:23] so he leaves right
[55:25] just flees the city yeah his own family
[55:29] reject him his own son Rises up against
[55:31] him
[55:34] yeah David knew what pain was all about
[55:38] David knew it intimately and experienced
[55:42] it his whole
[55:43] life you know what I love about
[55:47] David David had a heart like God Amen he
[55:51] was always considering the other person
[55:55] right he never once said I don't deserve
[55:57] this they shouldn't treat me this way
[56:00] don't they know yeah no he always
[56:04] preferred the other person's needs above
[56:06] his
[56:09] own he said in Psalm 73 he says
[56:12] nevertheless I am continually with thee
[56:15] thou H has Holden me up by by thy right
[56:19] hand David never was getting this
[56:22] arrogant feeling of saying look at me
[56:24] I'm doing a great job
[56:25] he says Lord if you don't hold me up I'm
[56:28] done Thou shalt guide me with thy
[56:31] counsel and afterward receive me to
[56:34] Glory Whom Shall I have in heaven but
[56:37] thee and there is none upon the Earth
[56:39] that I desire but
[56:42] thee My Flesh and my heart faileth but
[56:46] God is the strength of mine heart and my
[56:49] portion
[56:51] forever he says in Psalms 1392 23 says
[56:55] search me oh God know my heart try me
[56:59] and know my thoughts and see if there be
[57:01] any wicked in me lead me in that way
[57:05] that way
[57:06] Everlasting Psalms 147 he Health the
[57:10] broken heart and he bindeth up their
[57:13] wounds Psalms 51:10 create in me Lord a
[57:17] new a clean heart oh God renew the right
[57:20] Spirit Within Me amen that's four
[57:23] there's about 25 more
[57:27] God David wanted to he wanted his
[57:32] actions and his reactions to be pleasing
[57:35] to
[57:36] God and often times I don't believe my
[57:39] reactions to actions were pleasing to
[57:42] God and I'm convinced more than ever
[57:45] that God allows sometimes wrong actions
[57:48] for a purpose to check my reactions to
[57:52] the
[57:53] situations and some sometimes he does
[57:56] the right thing but I react
[58:02] incorrectly I I I believe I'm sorry but
[58:07] when he said I'm going to send you
[58:08] Elijah the prophet and he's going to
[58:10] turn the hearts of the children back to
[58:12] the fathers I think that was more than
[58:14] an outwardly appearance and a correct
[58:16] understanding of
[58:17] Doctrine I believe that he was going to
[58:19] create in me the very heart of
[58:21] Christ that what Christ is I will
[58:26] be and he just knows how to do it I
[58:29] don't know how to do it you know what I
[58:31] believe I believe he's custom made a
[58:33] course for each one of us to run and he
[58:35] just knows just the right trial just the
[58:38] right Joy just the right rejection just
[58:42] the right criticism just the right pain
[58:45] at the right time to make you what he
[58:47] desired you to
[58:50] be so can really the clay say to the
[58:53] Potter why
[58:55] why are you doing this you know I've
[58:58] seen it happen me over and over again
[58:59] it's like uhoh cool maybe we're about
[59:01] done no more pain coming together pretty
[59:04] good he says Nope not
[59:07] now wrong
[59:09] attitude wrong attitude yeah amen I
[59:13] think God's checking
[59:15] attitudes amen sir yeah you know you
[59:19] could do all the right things for all
[59:21] the wrong
[59:22] reasons all the wrong
[59:25] reasons I don't want to be that I really
[59:29] to me this is not a game this isn't
[59:31] convenient this isn't great do you think
[59:33] I enjoy this I
[59:35] don't I I I didn't I didn't come here to
[59:39] play Church didn't come here to just
[59:41] have friends oh I love you all and I
[59:43] have that I I really came in search for
[59:46] God and I've always from a kid I've told
[59:49] you that I'd go out there on the roof at
[59:51] night look at the stars I'm all alone
[59:53] something come over me I said Lord I'm
[59:54] I'm going find you someday I'm going to
[59:56] find
[59:57] you it wasn't me looking for him that
[1:00:00] was a father looking for a
[1:00:03] son and I'd get up there and I would cry
[1:00:05] I'm a 13-year-old boy you I mean some of
[1:00:08] you I mean come on you know what you
[1:00:09] were thinking as a 13-year-old boy full
[1:00:12] of hormones you wanting to fight
[1:00:13] something punch something do something
[1:00:14] like that I'd go up in that roof and cry
[1:00:17] it's
[1:00:18] weird i' I've just wanted to have
[1:00:20] fellowship with him I really did
[1:00:23] amen
[1:00:25] I I don't I don't care to be thought of
[1:00:27] as a minister I don't I don't care I've
[1:00:29] said that before it doesn't bother me to
[1:00:30] minister if I never get asked it's fine
[1:00:32] Brother Chad but I want to be a proud
[1:00:36] son I just want to hear well
[1:00:38] done I may not have 10,000 trophies to
[1:00:41] lay his feet but I want to be able to
[1:00:42] lay
[1:00:43] there I want to say there's one trophy I
[1:00:45] want to give you Lord It's
[1:00:47] Me couldn't do much else so I lay myself
[1:00:53] down
[1:01:00] I gotta find where I'm
[1:01:04] at first Samuel says but the Lord said
[1:01:07] unto Samuel look not on his countenance
[1:01:10] nor on the height of his stature because
[1:01:12] I have refused him for the Lord seeth
[1:01:15] not as men see for man looks on the
[1:01:19] outward appearance but the Lord looks on
[1:01:21] the
[1:01:23] heart I'm so thankful for that cuz he
[1:01:26] does know my heart he knows my
[1:01:31] heart why little Bethlehem David oh when
[1:01:34] he was anointed king that little boy
[1:01:36] he's just a ruddy little fella but he
[1:01:38] must have been there must have been
[1:01:39] something in him that looked real to God
[1:01:42] a little bitty probably the smallest in
[1:01:44] the family all the rest of the boys were
[1:01:46] great big fine looking men would be good
[1:01:49] to look upon with robes the crown would
[1:01:52] sit good on their head but God showed
[1:01:55] what he was looking for not the outward
[1:01:58] appearance but the inside of a man he
[1:02:01] looked at his
[1:02:02] heart he knew what was in David's heart
[1:02:06] no matter what a crown looked like on
[1:02:08] him he knowed he was finding him a man
[1:02:12] that was a man after his heart which
[1:02:15] David would be a man after his own heart
[1:02:17] that's why he poured the anointing oil
[1:02:20] upon
[1:02:21] David didn't matter how well the crown
[1:02:24] set didn't matter how good the robes
[1:02:27] looked on him that didn't matter at all
[1:02:29] to God God just had a man that would do
[1:02:32] his
[1:02:33] will would always be considering the
[1:02:36] people over himself that's why he was a
[1:02:38] Shepherd
[1:02:39] King he cared for the Sheep went out I
[1:02:43] don't think he went out after the bear
[1:02:44] and the lion to say hey I'm going to
[1:02:46] show that thing how good I am I'm going
[1:02:48] to show him how good I can throw this
[1:02:50] Stone I don't think he was trusting in
[1:02:52] human ability I think brother bam said
[1:02:55] that's the thing you got we all got to
[1:02:57] conquer is the thought of human
[1:02:59] ability I believe he just was simply
[1:03:01] humbly trusting God and I think the
[1:03:04] scripture says except you become like a
[1:03:06] child simple innocent unable and
[1:03:10] dependent we're not going to be able to
[1:03:12] please
[1:03:13] him right brother bam said this is the
[1:03:16] only trip everyone we're going on that
[1:03:17] we have to unpack
[1:03:20] for this is not a trip to see how much
[1:03:22] we can load up this is a Tri to see how
[1:03:24] much we can get rid of and the biggest
[1:03:27] thing I'm trying to get rid of is
[1:03:29] me that's the one he can't make that
[1:03:33] trip he's too
[1:03:36] heavy
[1:03:37] [Music]
[1:03:39] so brother bam said in the human heart
[1:03:41] there's so many
[1:03:43] doors brother Ben went into the door of
[1:03:46] pride of life you know there was a lust
[1:03:49] of the Flesh
[1:03:50] and lust of the eyes he said there's
[1:03:54] another little door it's called that
[1:03:56] door of Pride oh it's a hard one to get
[1:03:59] open human beings are just prone to
[1:04:01] think that maybe they're just a little
[1:04:03] bit better than the
[1:04:05] Joneses just a little bit better we are
[1:04:09] predisposed to think that way everyone
[1:04:12] your human nature is
[1:04:14] predisposed to gravitate to the thought
[1:04:17] that you're just a little bit better
[1:04:18] than somebody else it's human nature and
[1:04:22] it's hellish amen it's not of God that's
[1:04:26] not
[1:04:27] God Revelation humbles you down brother
[1:04:32] bam talks about the wheat in the field
[1:04:34] right he said those little I forget how
[1:04:37] he described he the happy little Wheats
[1:04:38] they think they're really something
[1:04:39] their head just flying woooo look at me
[1:04:41] look at me he said cuz there's nothing
[1:04:43] in
[1:04:44] there he said when that wheat gets full
[1:04:47] of the the grain like right the head
[1:04:48] starts to mature what's it
[1:04:51] do its head begins to bow down there's
[1:04:54] actually something there there's a
[1:04:57] substance there's a reality and it's
[1:04:58] bringing a humility and a dropping of
[1:05:00] one's head in the presence of God that's
[1:05:03] the reality of a Christian that's the
[1:05:05] reality of a mature son and daughter of
[1:05:08] God Revelations dropping us really low
[1:05:11] and we're not thinking we're better than
[1:05:13] anybody cuz we are
[1:05:17] not Fellowship 1960 something happened
[1:05:20] to me a few weeks ago and I am
[1:05:22] determined by God's help that I will
[1:05:24] never be negative on anything
[1:05:27] anymore to blast my heart out there and
[1:05:30] remind me that no matter what it will
[1:05:33] cost me I'm going to be sincere and see
[1:05:36] that's the truth men begin to educate
[1:05:39] themselves they educate themselves away
[1:05:41] from one another then they get complexes
[1:05:45] you don't get a complex by the blood of
[1:05:47] Jesus Christ you get
[1:05:49] love that's where you see you get love
[1:05:53] not complexes
[1:05:55] that little bit I'm a little bit bigger
[1:05:57] than somebody else I'm a little bit
[1:05:59] better than somebody else and know a
[1:06:01] little bit more than the other guy you
[1:06:03] just got your arms around everybody
[1:06:06] because see it's on the basis of love
[1:06:09] which is brought through the
[1:06:11] blood oh my you ever notic that when you
[1:06:13] first came to Christ you love everybody
[1:06:15] that's right it don't matter who they
[1:06:17] are what they think you're just so happy
[1:06:19] to be recipient of the grace of God in
[1:06:21] your life you're just like I love you
[1:06:23] anyhow you know I don't care I love you
[1:06:26] you know what is it if we ever get away
[1:06:28] from that we got away from something we
[1:06:30] shouldn't have got away from we better
[1:06:32] go back to that we don't think we're
[1:06:34] better than anybody else we think we're
[1:06:35] little than everybody else I remember
[1:06:37] saying that to brother Jeremy that first
[1:06:38] Bible study I said my goodness God
[1:06:41] revealed his truth to me and I'm the
[1:06:43] worst one I know I said surely God's
[1:06:47] going to reveal this to everybody else
[1:06:48] at my church cuz I promise you I'm the
[1:06:51] worst
[1:06:52] one that was the attitude oh I wish I
[1:06:54] would have stayed with that
[1:06:56] attitude I'd be we'd all be a little bit
[1:06:59] farther up the road if we would have
[1:07:00] stuck with that kind of an attitude
[1:07:02] right man I'm the worst one but God saw
[1:07:07] fit to save me God saw fit to redeem me
[1:07:10] amen let's go back to
[1:07:15] that he said in the super sense he says
[1:07:18] now you see you're all in love with one
[1:07:21] another how I see that you're standing
[1:07:23] here in the aisles this morning and just
[1:07:24] weep with all your hands up to God see
[1:07:27] the lovely Spirit moving all around you
[1:07:30] now don't you listen to one foul thing
[1:07:32] the devil's got to say see if the devil
[1:07:35] shows you shows you some or tells you
[1:07:38] something evil about one of the members
[1:07:40] of the body of Christ don't believe it
[1:07:42] for as soon as you believe it you will
[1:07:44] Mar your
[1:07:45] experience and if you see a member of
[1:07:48] the body of Christ doing something evil
[1:07:50] don't tell nobody but you go to that
[1:07:53] member with love and see if you can
[1:07:56] bring them back to Christ and if you
[1:07:58] can't do it then tell one person or let
[1:08:02] let them go with you you do it the way
[1:08:06] the scripture said if somebody said
[1:08:10] sister so and so or brother so and so
[1:08:12] don't you believe one word of it you
[1:08:15] just let it go because remember it's
[1:08:18] just the devil trying to tear you to
[1:08:20] pieces now you just look for him to come
[1:08:23] in cuz he's going to do it now you let
[1:08:26] that good man of the house Faith stand
[1:08:28] right there and don't you receive one
[1:08:30] thing these people that have been set
[1:08:33] there in Heavenly places with you
[1:08:35] fellowshipping together around the
[1:08:36] blessings of God taking communion at the
[1:08:39] table and the Holy Spirit as a witness
[1:08:41] that they are the children of God so
[1:08:43] let's just be real sweet kindhearted and
[1:08:46] forgiving loving and if other person
[1:08:49] talks evil against you you just talk
[1:08:51] real sweet to them praise God
[1:08:55] Amen watch how sweeter it comes to you
[1:09:00] then see that's the right you always
[1:09:03] return good for evil and love for hate
[1:09:07] amen
[1:09:08] wow
[1:09:11] see Christianity is a
[1:09:13] reality Christianity is
[1:09:16] rugged and it expresses itself in loving
[1:09:19] one another the scripture says if you
[1:09:22] say that you love God whom you've not
[1:09:24] seen and you love not the brother who
[1:09:26] you can see right well see This is Love
[1:09:30] Yes real love if you see me an all you
[1:09:33] see a fault with me you owe it to
[1:09:36] me told that to brother Jeremy at The
[1:09:39] First beginning said hey if I get off
[1:09:42] you get a hold of me you tell me cuz I
[1:09:45] get off I can get off am I would want
[1:09:49] some I don't I don't consider you to
[1:09:51] really love me unless you do that for me
[1:09:53] right right we do that for one another
[1:09:55] we love one another and we all make we
[1:09:57] all make mistakes we all get off the
[1:09:59] path at times and don't act like you
[1:10:02] don't you
[1:10:03] do you
[1:10:05] do but real spiritual maturity is when I
[1:10:08] see my brother he's he's off a little
[1:10:10] bit I'm concerned for him I go talk to
[1:10:12] him a little bit I mean just talk to
[1:10:14] that brother I'm I'm I'm concerned don't
[1:10:17] go tell everybody certainly don't go
[1:10:19] tell everybody Mar is testimony and hurt
[1:10:23] is influence
[1:10:24] just go talk to him sit down we're
[1:10:27] brothers let's
[1:10:29] talk and you say well he won't change
[1:10:32] that don't matter you got to do what God
[1:10:34] Said do doesn't matter what he does what
[1:10:37] if what if he doesn't listen to me
[1:10:39] doesn't matter it's off of you then you
[1:10:42] done what God told you to
[1:10:44] do and let God do the rest and I think
[1:10:47] there's something oh wait yeah when
[1:10:49] Divine love
[1:10:51] projects Sovereign Grace steps in
[1:10:54] finishes the work I think we're going to
[1:10:57] know how Divine love works by the time
[1:10:59] we're out of here and I think we're
[1:11:01] going to be living by
[1:11:05] it Bible says it'd be so deceptive in
[1:11:08] that last
[1:11:10] day you know I was considering
[1:11:12] Lucifer Lucifer was
[1:11:15] beautiful and the very first sermon that
[1:11:17] I ever preached was over in Philippines
[1:11:19] when brother Chad abandoned me at the
[1:11:22] airport the first inspiration that I
[1:11:25] ever ministered on I titled it deception
[1:11:28] by
[1:11:29] beauty that was the first sermon I ever
[1:11:32] preached deception by
[1:11:34] Beauty and uh we know Lucifer was
[1:11:37] beautiful he was amazing he was created
[1:11:40] co-equal with God I mean that's quite a
[1:11:43] being yeah right I mean God can't show
[1:11:46] his great strength unless he has a
[1:11:47] worthy opponent amen so this is a worthy
[1:11:50] opponent everyone and he was so
[1:11:53] stunningly beautiful so stunningly smart
[1:11:57] and Brilliant
[1:11:58] and that he got deceived by himself
[1:12:02] nobody deceived him he deceived
[1:12:06] himself he got to thinking I am pretty
[1:12:08] amazing in fact I'm greater than God I
[1:12:13] can build a greater Kingdom than Michael
[1:12:15] can build yeah I can do this better than
[1:12:17] they can do it let me make the decisions
[1:12:21] right I'll figure it out I can do it
[1:12:23] they can't
[1:12:24] yeah amen that's right that's
[1:12:28] right it's still the spirit of the
[1:12:31] devil it is what it is I've been guilty
[1:12:35] I've been
[1:12:37] guilty it's still the devil he is slick
[1:12:40] he hides he's Shifty he moves from one
[1:12:44] spot he never fully exposes himself he's
[1:12:46] shifty is all get out changes his mask
[1:12:49] here here here here
[1:12:51] here that's right he wasn't content in
[1:12:54] the place he was in he wanted to be a
[1:12:56] little bit more brother Bram said you
[1:12:59] know that same attitude I'm a little bit
[1:13:01] better I could do a little bit more
[1:13:03] that's right I think we need to have the
[1:13:05] attitude I'm just happy to be a
[1:13:07] Christian I'm just oh my goodness I
[1:13:10] don't deserve it never I have failed
[1:13:13] every day of my life I don't deserve to
[1:13:15] be here with you guys but I really am
[1:13:17] honored to be
[1:13:19] here I'm happy to be a part of it and
[1:13:22] you're you're all Ed but you're just see
[1:13:24] you're perfecting me I'm the one that
[1:13:26] needs
[1:13:27] perfected and
[1:13:29] see Iron sharpening iron
[1:13:33] Amen brother B said an influence he said
[1:13:37] when a man or a woman no matter if he's
[1:13:39] a bishop a cardinal or whatever he will
[1:13:41] be when you begin to feel a little
[1:13:44] self-reliant then you better watch you
[1:13:47] better take heed because God is not
[1:13:49] going to let you get away with that
[1:13:51] because he is not going to share his
[1:13:53] glory with anyone God will get the glory
[1:13:56] in him alone sometimes God can bless a
[1:14:00] man and give him a little ministry
[1:14:01] that's just a little bit better than his
[1:14:03] Brethren or not better but see it's just
[1:14:06] a little different than his Brethren and
[1:14:08] then the first thing you know that that
[1:14:10] that man gets a little exalted his chest
[1:14:12] sticks out and oh he would or he would
[1:14:15] just brush you off the street and that
[1:14:18] that's the time that I believe that the
[1:14:21] man is starting his way out the door
[1:14:24] God ain't going to let that happen God
[1:14:27] ain't going to let you get a puffed up
[1:14:28] chest and think you're something special
[1:14:30] cuz we're
[1:14:32] not it's not a great people it's a great
[1:14:34] God in a people just a great God living
[1:14:38] and dwelling and having expression in us
[1:14:40] but we no we're Badger skins right we're
[1:14:44] we're we're just the Veil Just a
[1:14:49] veil brother BR brother Gabe shared this
[1:14:52] with me and it's something I've I've
[1:14:53] chewed on
[1:14:55] here and brother brandham refers to
[1:14:57] popular sins in the last day and I like
[1:15:00] to read this because it Frameworks
[1:15:02] something he says and how can I overcome
[1:15:05] 1963 he said and he caught them who
[1:15:09] looked for that so will he come in each
[1:15:11] New Testament the Saints that's overcome
[1:15:14] every denominational critic who has ever
[1:15:16] overcome all of the popular sins of that
[1:15:20] day of that age that we live in now like
[1:15:23] he did in all the other Church ages
[1:15:25] those who overcome in that church age
[1:15:28] those who overcome what okay what are we
[1:15:31] going to
[1:15:32] overcome I am rich I have need of
[1:15:36] nothing oh I'm all this I'm all that I
[1:15:41] am the
[1:15:42] bride I have need of nothing yeah right
[1:15:46] amen yes he follows up by saying and you
[1:15:49] don't know you are naked and blind amen
[1:15:53] direct quote look it up then he says you
[1:15:56] see that deceiving age that I
[1:15:59] said it's not like them that they were
[1:16:02] going to have their heads cut off to get
[1:16:04] that white stone those that were under
[1:16:06] martym and they were burn at Stakes he
[1:16:08] says no but it's so it's such a
[1:16:10] deceiving age now that think that they
[1:16:14] are
[1:16:15] everything right see I am a good church
[1:16:18] member I am a good man I'm a good woman
[1:16:22] I am this and I am
[1:16:24] that there's your
[1:16:26] deception that's the deception that we
[1:16:28] have to watch for
[1:16:30] everyone that's it right if the devil
[1:16:33] can't pull you into something what's he
[1:16:34] going to
[1:16:35] do he's going to push you
[1:16:38] up just push you
[1:16:41] up
[1:16:45] amen still okay okay okay
[1:16:50] okay sorry I'm going to read a couple
[1:16:54] things this one's a little lengthy but
[1:16:57] listen here he said in time tested
[1:17:00] memorials some time ago there was the
[1:17:02] great Caesar Augustus after this great
[1:17:04] famous battle he had won a great Victory
[1:17:07] and he was going down to have a
[1:17:08] celebration in Rome and he said to them
[1:17:11] I want someone to ride by my side who's
[1:17:13] worthy to ride by my side I want some
[1:17:16] man to share all of these blessings with
[1:17:19] me and it went down through the camps
[1:17:22] and all the off officers they trimmed
[1:17:23] their plumes and they polished up their
[1:17:25] swords and they made their armors real
[1:17:27] bright and everything and they practiced
[1:17:28] standing just the right way so they
[1:17:30] could salute the king and so forth and
[1:17:32] each one walked up with their great big
[1:17:34] armors on before him and he sat there on
[1:17:36] the throne watching and there came up an
[1:17:38] officer with his big fine plume with his
[1:17:40] feather edged sword uh feather edged
[1:17:43] stood and made his salute uh Caesar
[1:17:46] shook his head and he just walked away
[1:17:48] another one come up made his salute
[1:17:50] Caesar shook his head and just walked
[1:17:52] away time after After Time After Time
[1:17:54] Soldier after Soldier finally way down
[1:17:57] along the line there was a little
[1:17:58] footman he didn't have a Polish he
[1:18:01] didn't have a shield to polish neither
[1:18:03] did he have a plume to trim but he
[1:18:05] walked up in front of Caesar he didn't
[1:18:08] even know how to salute him right but he
[1:18:10] just bowed his head and he walked away
[1:18:14] Caesar said wait a minute you come back
[1:18:18] here he walked up there he looked at him
[1:18:21] and there were scars all over over his
[1:18:23] face he had been cut up disfigured and
[1:18:26] crippled where'd you get those scars he
[1:18:29] said I was out on the battle fighting
[1:18:31] for my Lord he said you climb up here
[1:18:34] and sit down by my side you're the one
[1:18:36] that's been tested and proved brother
[1:18:39] it's plume trimming time it's not an
[1:18:41] educational time it's time testing time
[1:18:44] it's a time that God is going to test
[1:18:46] his church to find those Battle Scars of
[1:18:49] real hard trials fights and in battles
[1:18:53] that's the one who's going to ride by
[1:18:55] his
[1:18:57] side you know I began to
[1:18:59] realize those scars sometimes that we
[1:19:02] look back in our life we get really
[1:19:03] ashamed of those aren't scars of defeat
[1:19:07] I'm are Victory
[1:19:09] scars those are scars we
[1:19:11] overcame you know when Jesus was all
[1:19:14] scarred up beat up bruised up they stood
[1:19:17] there at the foot of the cross those
[1:19:18] that were walking from the road to emus
[1:19:20] their heads down low they felt like it
[1:19:23] had all been defeated it was all over
[1:19:26] these are fatal wounds and what what
[1:19:28] could come good out of this but then
[1:19:31] Jesus came and started showing off these
[1:19:33] nail scarred hands these weren't scars
[1:19:36] of defeat these are scars of Victory to
[1:19:38] showing that one had overcome all the
[1:19:41] pains all the rejections all the
[1:19:44] despisement the spitting the mockings
[1:19:46] the humiliations and he kept on with the
[1:19:48] purpose of God in his heart amen he just
[1:19:51] kept going yeah
[1:19:53] and I think that's what it's going to be
[1:19:54] like there's not a one of us that isn't
[1:19:57] going to Bear a scar we're all going to
[1:19:59] be cut up by the time we get out of here
[1:20:01] we're going to be bruised cut up worn
[1:20:04] out humiliated it's all going to happen
[1:20:06] to all of us give it enough time and
[1:20:09] you're going to see that it happens but
[1:20:11] we're doing it for a purpose amen it's
[1:20:13] not in vain it's none of it's in vain
[1:20:17] it's all making me what he wanted me to
[1:20:19] be it's all making you what he had
[1:20:21] determined to make
[1:20:24] you every failure every disappointment
[1:20:27] every trial it's all for a great
[1:20:31] purpose they're going to be signs of
[1:20:34] Victory they're going to be Battle Scars
[1:20:36] of Victory not
[1:20:40] defeat he says we pray tonight Lord that
[1:20:44] you'll sanctify this church by thy great
[1:20:46] Holy Blood clean out all the blows all
[1:20:49] those weak spots all those foul threads
[1:20:52] run through here with the machine and
[1:20:54] ret tape them up again make them a new
[1:20:56] material oh blessed father and while we
[1:20:59] have our heads bowed if there would be
[1:21:01] such a person here tonight that would
[1:21:03] feel that God is test it that God in his
[1:21:07] testing time has never found you to be
[1:21:10] faithful at your post of Duty when
[1:21:12] arguments would come up you would jump
[1:21:14] right in and partake of them when corals
[1:21:16] would come in then indifference and
[1:21:18] differences in the church you took your
[1:21:21] side you you jumped with a click or a
[1:21:23] cult and you did it do you listen to
[1:21:27] gosp gossip if you're guilty of all that
[1:21:31] you've been blowed through by the
[1:21:32] devil's blows let's go right back to the
[1:21:35] furnace tonight and be remelted over
[1:21:38] again and come out uh come out without
[1:21:42] them in us let God thread us down and
[1:21:45] get us ready for that great bridge of
[1:21:47] the Rapture if such a person is here
[1:21:50] would you like to be
[1:21:51] remembered I want to be remembered
[1:21:54] everyone I need remelted down I need
[1:21:57] mended up I need old scars ripped apart
[1:22:01] I need those things exposed in me I need
[1:22:04] to be refined
[1:22:06] over just to show you that I believe
[1:22:08] these scars they all serve a
[1:22:10] purpose sometimes you know we try to
[1:22:12] protect things in our life you know
[1:22:14] someone hurts you really bad really bad
[1:22:17] and you're like you ever heard of the
[1:22:18] Chinese torture
[1:22:20] drills yeah ever heard of it okay I
[1:22:22] think I think this is how it works they
[1:22:23] take a drop of water and they drop it on
[1:22:25] your forehead and they just do it for
[1:22:28] days and days and days until finally the
[1:22:32] person is going insane in pain can't
[1:22:35] handle it no more just this little bit
[1:22:37] of pain at just the right spot long
[1:22:40] enough cause a man to go crazy and it's
[1:22:43] amazing we all have wounds we have soft
[1:22:46] spots we have little spaces little Parts
[1:22:48] in our heart my goodness don't touch me
[1:22:52] there it hurt right and amen it's true
[1:22:57] it does hurt but God can heal the wound
[1:22:59] am if God can heal the leg heal anything
[1:23:04] in the physical cannot God heal the
[1:23:07] heart did not David say that yeah do not
[1:23:10] we believe that anything that has caused
[1:23:13] damage in our hearts over the Liv or
[1:23:14] over our years God can heal it and
[1:23:17] actually use it as a victory rather than
[1:23:19] a time where we constantly seem to fall
[1:23:21] we fall here we fall here we fall here
[1:23:24] you have weak spots brother bam said you
[1:23:26] got them and you better get ready to get
[1:23:28] punched in them yeah but you got to have
[1:23:29] God covering that spot for you you can't
[1:23:31] cover it no more it's just that time
[1:23:33] he's ripping these things apart and he
[1:23:36] said you ain't covering this anymore I
[1:23:38] am going to be your covering and if I
[1:23:41] can't be your covering right you're done
[1:23:45] amen that's just a reality sorry I'm
[1:23:48] using such plain terms I hope it you
[1:23:49] makes sense to what I'm saying amen amen
[1:23:53] so brother brandham tells this story he
[1:23:56] said not long ago there was a young lady
[1:23:58] that came from college her
[1:24:00] mother uh had washed over a board to
[1:24:03] send her to college and when she drove
[1:24:05] down to the station she had uh she had
[1:24:08] brought a young girl with her and she
[1:24:11] had gotten away from God and she had
[1:24:13] gotten away from church and that young
[1:24:15] girl was with her and the young girl
[1:24:16] sitting there and the train was looking
[1:24:18] out in there stood her mother on the
[1:24:21] outside you see she was all scarred up
[1:24:24] and the young girl was looking at her
[1:24:26] from the train and finally said would
[1:24:29] you look at that old haggy looking woman
[1:24:32] that was the girl's mother said isn't

[1:24:36] horrible my wouldn't you hate to have to
[1:24:39] sit across the table from her that was

[1:24:47] she got off the train this old wrinkled
[1:24:50] up woman run up to her and she threw her

[1:25:20] the shoulders and said you lookie here

[1:25:26] your mother since you've been away to
[1:25:29] college said remember let me remind you
[1:25:32] of the story one day the house was
[1:25:34] burning your mother was a beautiful
[1:25:37] woman far more beautiful than you will
[1:25:39] ever be and said you were the tiny
[1:25:42] little baby when she when she was
[1:25:45] hanging her clothes out on the backyard
[1:25:47] and all at once the house caught fire
[1:25:49] and here comes the fire anes to put it
[1:25:51] out and the the house was full of flames
[1:25:53] you were screaming from the upstairs no
[1:25:56] one would go in and Pierce those Flames
[1:25:59] but a little mother your little mother
[1:26:01] wrapped herself up and in there she ran
[1:26:04] through those flames and she grabbed you
[1:26:06] she took off she took the clothes from
[1:26:08] off of her face and wrapped you all up
[1:26:11] in it and put you in her arms and and
[1:26:14] and placed her face to the flames and
[1:26:17] Through the flames she came to rescue
[1:26:19] you that's why you're pretty today and
[1:26:22] that's why she so scarred you are
[1:26:25] ashamed of those scars that's the way
[1:26:27] Jesus has done for us when we were
[1:26:30] Sinners ugly before God cast down and
[1:26:32] turn away he came and that the lovely
[1:26:35] Son of God from his Ivory Place palaces
[1:26:38] he came down to earth and he took upon
[1:26:40] the shame and the humiliation upon
[1:26:43] himself and the sin upon himself and he
[1:26:45] died there on calary crying out should I
[1:26:48] be ashamed of a gospel Christians on the
[1:26:51] street are ashamed to to stand for the
[1:26:53] gospel but he was marred and he was made
[1:26:55] ugly so that I could be made
[1:27:00] free and so in considering
[1:27:04] that uh you know I'm so glad those those
[1:27:08] scars were a testament of a mother's
[1:27:11] love for a baby she was willing to
[1:27:13] endure the scars for somebody else's
[1:27:16] sake and when we consider Jesus Christ
[1:27:18] he was willing to endure the rejections
[1:27:20] rure the pain in endure the
[1:27:22] embarrassment the humiliation for
[1:27:25] somebody else's sake now I think the
[1:27:27] question is coming to all of us what are
[1:27:29] we willing to endure are you willing to
[1:27:31] endure the rejection you willing to
[1:27:33] endure the criticism are you willing to
[1:27:34] endure all of these pains that you're
[1:27:37] going to have to handle for somebody
[1:27:40] else's
[1:27:42] sake if we're living our life for
[1:27:44] ourselves we haven't
[1:27:46] arrived if we're living our life for
[1:27:48] somebody else we're looking Heaven
[1:27:50] heavenward we're pointed the the right
[1:27:52] direction and that's the reality of it
[1:27:55] in Hebrews 12 it
[1:27:57] says um looking unto Jesus the author
[1:28:00] and the finisher of our faith who for
[1:28:01] the joy that was set before him endured
[1:28:05] the cross there's a time where you just
[1:28:07] have to endure the pain you just have to
[1:28:10] go through it it's painful when they
[1:28:12] ripped open that scar tissue it's
[1:28:14] painful but it had to be ripped open to
[1:28:17] set me right so I could walk right act
[1:28:20] right scripturally or spiritually
[1:28:22] speaking there's wounds in me had to be
[1:28:24] ripped apart I had to have some spots
[1:28:27] that I've been covering over ripped to
[1:28:31] shreds so that I could start walking
[1:28:33] right talking right acting right
[1:28:36] treating people right it's not fun it's
[1:28:40] painful amen maturing is
[1:28:45] painful he says uh
[1:28:48] father while we're here in this battle
[1:28:50] of life let us be strong and courageous
[1:28:54] knowing that just beyond the water out
[1:28:56] yonder is an eternity help us to come in
[1:29:00] that day as great warriors with Battle
[1:29:03] Scars all over us showing the results of
[1:29:06] the battle must I be carried home on
[1:29:09] flowery bed of ease While others have
[1:29:11] fought to win the prize and they sailed
[1:29:14] through bloody Seas said the poet let us
[1:29:17] come all that
[1:29:20] way we're not coming on a flowery bed of
[1:29:23] Beast I this ain't going to get easier I
[1:29:27] I don't believe it's getting easier I
[1:29:29] believe it's going to get much more
[1:29:32] difficult and uh I think we're going to
[1:29:34] have a lot of scars by the time we're
[1:29:36] out of here but I think he's going to
[1:29:38] see those scars I think he's going to
[1:29:40] say ah my son come stand with me I want
[1:29:44] you to sit on my throne with me I know
[1:29:47] why you bore those scars you did it for
[1:29:48] somebody else amen you did it for
[1:29:50] somebody else and it's all going to be
[1:29:52] worth it one of these
[1:29:55] days it says in John where I read it if
[1:29:59] I be lifted up I'll draw all men unto me
[1:30:02] brother Ben I appreciated the sermon
[1:30:04] last Wednesday and there's not a one
[1:30:07] person in here that didn't and it
[1:30:09] encouraged me to take this
[1:30:12] step it's hard it's not easy to be
[1:30:15] humiliated it's not easy to show your
[1:30:18] wounds it's not easy to have them
[1:30:20] exposed
[1:30:22] to show your
[1:30:23] failings your faults your
[1:30:26] mistakes that we all got
[1:30:29] them everyone
[1:30:31] does and so I think by the grace of
[1:30:36] God
[1:30:37] um if there's a cross for brother Ben
[1:30:41] and there's a cross for me there's
[1:30:43] probably a cross for you somewhere maybe
[1:30:47] it's sitting behind the door tried to
[1:30:50] cover it up with a sheet tried to hide
[1:30:52] it so you don't have to look at
[1:30:55] it humans avoid
[1:30:57] pain we do everything we can to to to
[1:31:01] resist it but Christ
[1:31:03] doesn't Christ doesn't he Embraces the
[1:31:06] cross he goes right for it right for it
[1:31:10] and you consider that always Moses
[1:31:12] brother B said stumbled me how could
[1:31:14] Moses say Lord block my name out but
[1:31:17] don't forsake your people right and he
[1:31:20] said Till I struck me it was Christ in
[1:31:22] Moses Christ in Moses was saying let me
[1:31:25] suffer but don't let your people suffer
[1:31:28] David said the same thing he said Lord
[1:31:30] stop it don't hurt your sheep bring it
[1:31:32] bring it to me David said the same thing
[1:31:35] those Christlike characters and if
[1:31:37] Christ is going to be in us we're going
[1:31:39] to say beat me bruise me wound me it's
[1:31:42] okay I know it's serving a purpose I'm
[1:31:46] going to have to be exposed I'm going to
[1:31:47] have to put myself in a position where I
[1:31:50] could be hurt right brother Ben
[1:31:54] but I think Christ will be lifted up and
[1:31:58] if Christ is lifted up then I know the
[1:31:59] people will be helped and that's the
[1:32:02] purpose of ministry Ministry is there to
[1:32:05] help and minister to you and ministers
[1:32:08] are sometimes the first partakers of
[1:32:10] these
[1:32:11] things and um Zechariah
[1:32:17] says oh that which the um the one shall
[1:32:22] say unto him what are these wounds in
[1:32:24] your hands and he shall say and answer
[1:32:27] those of which I I was wounded were in
[1:32:30] the house of my
[1:32:31] friends and
[1:32:33] so don't feel so
[1:32:36] bad and know we got some wounds that we
[1:32:39] have to just endure amen ah and they're
[1:32:42] going to come from the ones we love the
[1:32:43] most and it's all part of the plan amen
[1:32:47] you know um we're not getting out of
[1:32:50] here without coming into His Image and
[1:32:53] uh it's painful everyone it's just
[1:32:57] painful I don't know how El to say it I
[1:32:59] wish there was more words I could say to
[1:33:00] make it more
[1:33:03] palatable first John says if we love him
[1:33:06] because we love him because he first
[1:33:08] loved us if a man say that I love God
[1:33:11] and he hates his brother he is a liar
[1:33:14] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[1:33:16] he hath seen how can he love God whom he
[1:33:19] hath not seen and this commandment we
[1:33:22] have from him that he who loveth God is
[1:33:27] love loveth God love his brother
[1:33:30] also I think the scripture says greater
[1:33:32] love hath no man than this he lays down
[1:33:34] his life for friends you know and so I
[1:33:39] think that's what's
[1:33:40] happening I think uh all of our lives
[1:33:43] are being exposed by the grace of God
[1:33:46] and
[1:33:48] um and we're not playing Church no more
[1:33:52] God musicians will you
[1:33:55] come um will you
[1:33:58] stand
[1:34:01] um I'm kind of like the bucket I carry
[1:34:04] it all out here and I dump it all at one
[1:34:07] time I don't know how to trickle it out
[1:34:10] I'm working on it brother Chad I'm
[1:34:12] sorry I I I
[1:34:15] I will you forgive
[1:34:18] me love you
[1:34:20] all
[1:34:22] times I'm ashamed of
[1:34:25] myself just
[1:34:28] ashamed but I'm still honored to go
[1:34:32] through the shame I'm honored to be to
[1:34:35] go through whatever humiliation he needs
[1:34:37] to bring me to so I can just have
[1:34:38] fellowship with him that's the desire I
[1:34:41] just want to have
[1:34:43] fellowship and uh I know that
[1:34:48] um I I don't know I I I'm just amazed at
[1:34:51] times how God works things out you know
[1:34:55] the timing of things is so unique it's
[1:34:58] he's making everything perfect in his
[1:35:01] time everything's being made beautiful
[1:35:04] yeah right on his time amen never on
[1:35:06] mine I would bypass some things along
[1:35:09] the way I would try to avoid some
[1:35:13] disfigurements and some bruises and some
[1:35:16] pains along the way but it's a time to
[1:35:20] Rend there's a Time time to sew back up
[1:35:23] and by the grace of God I think he's
[1:35:25] rented and now he's sewing back up am
[1:35:29] and for each of us that may be a
[1:35:30] different
[1:35:31] thing maybe something you got to go make
[1:35:34] right maybe a conversation you need to
[1:35:37] correct maybe uh humbling of
[1:35:40] oneself you're not as good as you
[1:35:43] think um but ultimately I think you'll
[1:35:47] be glorifying God I think you'll be
[1:35:49] lifting him up
[1:35:52] and I think
[1:35:53] honestly you'll have respect not only
[1:35:55] amongst God you'll have respect amongst
[1:35:58] men brother Ben I sent him a text I said
[1:36:01] brother Ben 10 foot taller than my eyes
[1:36:03] now and then he had to say uhoh now I
[1:36:05] got another trial you I oh boy oh boy
[1:36:07] here it going to get
[1:36:09] bad we're just brothers we're just
[1:36:12] learning together we're
[1:36:14] family and I'm glad to be a part of the
[1:36:16] family of God and I'm glad to be
[1:36:18] perfecting in your midst I still
[1:36:20] wouldn't trade it for the world I still
[1:36:23] wouldn't trade it for the world Isaiah
[1:36:26] says 53 he was wounded for our
[1:36:29] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:36:31] iniquities and the chastisement of our
[1:36:34] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[1:36:36] we are
[1:36:39] healed everything Body Mind heart
[1:36:45] everything he paid the price to heal it
[1:36:48] all that's right amen but it takes the
[1:36:51] word sometimes to rip something apart so
[1:36:54] he can pour in that ointment that
[1:36:56] healing ointments got to go right to the
[1:36:58] right spot and so sometimes you just got
[1:37:01] to rip it
[1:37:02] apart would you bow your
[1:37:07] heads gracious heavenly
[1:37:09] father thank you Lord for your grace to
[1:37:12] each and every one of us thank you for
[1:37:14] your
[1:37:15] word thank you Lord you promised I'll
[1:37:18] never leave
[1:37:20] you
[1:37:21] never forsake you Lord we all stray we
[1:37:25] all like sheep have gone astray at times
[1:37:28] and Lord You're the great Shepherd that
[1:37:29] comes after each and every one of us
[1:37:32] Lord I'm just so thankful for that I
[1:37:35] think we as a people would all bow our
[1:37:37] heads in humility when we recognize just
[1:37:39] how great you are Lord you you inspire
[1:37:43] all of us to want to be like you Lord
[1:37:46] seeing the great price you paid and the
[1:37:48] life that you lived and how you end
[1:37:51] endured such such difficult things and
[1:37:55] Lord you did it all for
[1:37:58] me and Lord It's my great honor and my
[1:38:00] privilege if you could just keep your
[1:38:02] hand of Grace upon
[1:38:04] me to help me to come into that image
[1:38:08] someday may you help us all to come into
[1:38:12] that image that's our desire
[1:38:14] Lord I don't want to just be
[1:38:17] saved I want to be able to have
[1:38:19] fellowship with you and you're so great
[1:38:22] how would I know how to have fellowship
[1:38:24] with you but Lord you humbled yourself
[1:38:27] you became obedient unto death even
[1:38:29] death of the Cross and so Lord God I
[1:38:32] just pray that you'd help each and every
[1:38:33] one of us to follow in those same
[1:38:36] footsteps they're big footsteps Lord but
[1:38:39] I just pray that your anointing would be
[1:38:40] upon us to walk in them and I believe
[1:38:42] that it is I don't believe these things
[1:38:45] are for no reason I don't believe this
[1:38:47] is all a fable I don't believe this is
[1:38:50] all just something we've made made up no
[1:38:51] I believe this is God and man coming
[1:38:54] together again and so Lord search our
[1:38:57] hearts you've been searching mine and
[1:39:00] keep searching it over and over and over
[1:39:03] search each of us father both young and
[1:39:06] old Lord if there be anything Wicked in
[1:39:09] US father show it to us so we can make
[1:39:11] it right help us father we need help
[1:39:15] like your Prophet crying out 1962 God

[1:39:25] can't do this without you we never could
[1:39:28] we never will we need your help we need
[1:39:32] your grace every day and I I I I believe
[1:39:35] we've received it and we'll continue to
[1:39:37] receive it Lord I sure love you I love
[1:39:41] these people I know I do and I just pray
[1:39:44] that you'd bless each and every one both
[1:39:46] young and old take the Bro broken up
[1:39:50] thoughts I'm sorry sorry Lord I know it
[1:39:51] wasn't put together right but Lord you
[1:39:54] know my heart and that was my desire and
[1:39:57] I just pray you use it to bring you
[1:39:58] glory and just I pray your sheep are fed
[1:40:01] in some way and Lord may you just help
[1:40:04] them all to Come a Little Closer to You
[1:40:07] Lord we love you so thankful for what
[1:40:10] you have done what you are doing and
[1:40:13] what you will do in each and of Our
[1:40:15] Lives we love you we commit ourselves to
[1:40:18] you in Jesus name amen
[1:40:22] brother Chad will you come so happy for
[1:40:25] the
[1:40:26] baptism man I heard about it I was so
[1:40:29] excited God bless you both I just got a
[1:40:32] chance to shake your hand and uh and it
[1:40:35] was about uh 15 years ago this August I
[1:40:38] was able to get baptized right here and
[1:40:41] and uh it was just the grace of God
[1:40:43] Shine the Light down my path and I
[1:40:46] hadn't seen it I had been baptized
[1:40:48] multiple times before but when you see
[1:40:50] the truth you just want to walk in it
[1:40:52] and that's just the desire of our hearts
[1:40:55] as whatever he shows us to do we just
[1:40:57] want to be faithful to do it and uh I'm
[1:40:59] sure today he shows us something and
[1:41:02] tomorrow sister Joyce is's going to show
[1:41:03] us something else ain't he and I think
[1:41:06] that was all because God is restoring
[1:41:08] Fellowship he wants to walk with you
[1:41:11] that was his promise and I believe we're
[1:41:14] going to be walking with him we're going
[1:41:16] to learn to walk at the pace that he
[1:41:18] walks we're going to learn to walk where
[1:41:21] he goes we'll follow we're not going to
[1:41:23] Veer off and go our own way by the time
[1:41:25] we're all said and done we're not going
[1:41:27] to take our eyes off of him we're going
[1:41:29] to hold on to him and say Lord I'm not
[1:41:31] letting you get one step ahead of me or
[1:41:33] one step far from me I want to walk with
[1:41:36] you Lord and so by his
[1:41:40] grace he's doing it I believe he's
[1:41:43] restoring the fellowship that I've
[1:41:45] longed for right brother Roger in your
[1:41:48] heart something crying out can't explain
[1:41:50] it don't know what happened we wander
[1:41:54] away we go our own way at times he lets
[1:41:58] us learn some hard
[1:41:59] lessons it lets us get all battled up
[1:42:02] and scarred up but it all served a
[1:42:06] purpose and one day there'll be Battle
[1:42:08] Scars of Victory brother Roger said you
[1:42:11] know what it didn't stop me I got right
[1:42:14] back up and I kept going amen we're
[1:42:17] going to get knocked down we're going to
[1:42:19] get punched really hard but it's not
[1:42:21] going to stop us cuz greater is he
[1:42:23] that's in me than he that was in this
[1:42:26] world and by his grace he's drawing us

[1:44:11] Denny and sister Carrie if you'd like to
[1:44:12] make your way around back and there'll
[1:44:14] be a one of the brothers there to help
[1:44:17] you amen I'm so blessed by the word
[1:44:21] today amen amen not just blessed because
[1:44:25] I was told you're great you're wonderful
[1:44:27] I was blessed because God's trying to
[1:44:29] fix this vessel so that he can use it
[1:44:32] and I'm thankful he's still working on
[1:44:34] this
[1:44:35] vessel thought it was so interesting
[1:44:37] when Brother Kyle talked about the scar
[1:44:39] that he had and how had to be ripped
[1:44:41] back apart
[1:44:42] and so many things are causing us to
[1:44:45] walk in a deformed way amen it's causing
[1:44:49] us problems in our SP spiritual life and
[1:44:51] in our natural life and we don't even
[1:44:53] know what it was amen but the grace of
[1:44:55] God will come along and he'll find that
[1:44:57] spot and he'll tear it
[1:44:59] apart I thank God for that because he
[1:45:02] knows what we have need of sometimes we
[1:45:04] don't even really know what our problem
[1:45:06] is but God will come by by the word and
[1:45:08] he'll identify our problem and then
[1:45:10] he'll tear that apart and then it'll
[1:45:11] heal and there may always be a scar
[1:45:14] there but it won't be a scar it won't be
[1:45:16] from a wound that healed the wrong way
[1:45:17] but it'll be from a wound that was
[1:45:19] healed the right way amen I say God heal
[1:45:22] me the right
[1:45:24] way remember the scripture that says
[1:45:27] amen make straight paths for your feet
[1:45:29] lest the lame be turned out of the way
[1:45:30] but rather let it be healed amen and I
[1:45:34] say God whatever's got me walking
[1:45:36] crooked would you come and heal it Lord
[1:45:39] come and heal it thank God for
[1:45:42] that
[1:45:44] amen I was thinking of something brother
[1:45:46] bandom said when it comes to humility
[1:45:48] there was something that Brother Kyle
[1:45:49] was talking about about where when we
[1:45:51] get feeling lifted up and we feel like
[1:45:54] maybe we've got something and we've got
[1:45:55] it accomplished that's the moment we're
[1:45:58] ready for a really hard fall it's
[1:46:01] happened to me so many times and I don't
[1:46:03] want to go through it again but brother
[1:46:05] Brandon remember the time he was laying
[1:46:06] there and say well Bill brandom you're
[1:46:09] nearly 50 years old if you're ever going
[1:46:11] to do anything for the Lord you better
[1:46:13] get started
[1:46:16] now by the time he was 50 look at what
[1:46:18] he had done for the Lord
[1:46:21] if that was his attitude what should our
[1:46:23] attitude be I want to have I said God
[1:46:25] help me to have the same attitude not to
[1:46:27] pretend but in reality help me to
[1:46:29] realize I have not done anything but I
[1:46:31] want to do something I want to yield I
[1:46:34] want to surrender and may God keep us in
[1:46:37] the right
[1:46:39] attitude
[1:46:41] amen God's doing something for us
[1:46:44] friends he's doing something in us and
[1:46:48] maybe that's the most necess Neary work
[1:46:51] of all maybe that's where the real
[1:46:52] Miracles are taking place right now is
[1:46:55] what God's doing inside of us to break
[1:46:59] those broken places maybe something was
[1:47:01] broken inside of us and it healed but it
[1:47:03] didn't heal necessarily right and it's
[1:47:05] still causing us
[1:47:07] problems but the great Physician's
[1:47:10] here he may have to rebre it but he
[1:47:14] knows how to set it right so that we can
[1:47:17] serve his purpose on this Earth
[1:47:20] how many of you want to be set
[1:47:22] right how many feel like God is setting
[1:47:25] you right through the services through
[1:47:26] the word this message has come to make a
[1:47:30] bride in His
[1:47:32] image and I believe the word's doing it
[1:47:36] let's just bow our heads together and
[1:47:38] pray dear heavenly father I'm so
[1:47:41] thankful Lord that you're so mindful of
[1:47:44] our needs that you come along Lord and
[1:47:46] you begin to expose areas that we need
[1:47:49] you more
[1:47:50] God we may have been blind to it we may
[1:47:52] have known there's a problem there
[1:47:54] somewhere but what the problem is we
[1:47:56] don't necessarily know but but God you
[1:47:58] keep coming down and you keep exploring
[1:48:01] and probing and opening all the doors
[1:48:03] Lord to our heart and God help us not to
[1:48:06] resist it but help us to yield and let
[1:48:08] you open any door you want to explore
[1:48:11] all of our life Lord and all of the
[1:48:12] innermost parts of our being and God
[1:48:15] when you find something there that's
[1:48:17] unpleasant we don't like and we don't
[1:48:18] want expose would you help us Lord would
[1:48:20] you come and fix that place inside of us

[1:48:39] need your help every step of the way and
[1:48:42] God I believe you're speaking to us
[1:48:44] through the ministry Lord and you're
[1:48:45] showing through the brothers that you're
[1:48:47] here to help that it's the season it's
[1:48:50] the time that you're going to do a
[1:48:52] mighty work in our lives and Lord we
[1:48:54] just want to lay on your operating table
