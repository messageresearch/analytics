there's only one group of people that can give him praise we will read it there's only one group of people that can praise him and that's you A peculiar people A peculiar treasure you are his his own inheritance God bless you you may be seated thank you brothers and sisters appreciate your gifts days in and days out they are here ministering to us and we just want to appreciate all that they do well God bless you all again I have uh the opportunity to be today here to announce that our pastor is on his way back this is what the services all about all the ministers have to preach and the only one has to announce that our pastor is coming back and that was me so he he's sending his greetings to you all and him and uh with uh his uh precious beautiful beloved blessed two companions I'm glad they were not sitting there because they would have been shrinking so an hour ago they were to board the their first flight headed back to the us and we're just so blessed that our pastor is coming back home with the family and uh meeting his family here that has been so precious to us uh we don't want them to shrink right now we had too many things to say but we're want to hold that we just appreciate everyone here is for years just think that for years the denomination used to say when the poly Ghost came on the day of the Pentecost the Pentecost God was dividing himself but here comes the prophet at the end time he said no it's the opposite it's God reuniting himself and I'm seeing here God reuniting himself there's some toes sitting somewhere some hands sitting there and some tongues there so we are one body we have come to minister to one another just to just to love him I don't have something special we just going to be reading uh the scripture today so beside the greetings from our pastor I also have greetings from uh brothers and sisters uh from Fresno California where we were uh visiting last weekend they uh send their greetings to you and say that they know you they feel like they're they are part of the congregation and uh Brother Rich cob is the one who is very instrumental there towards them and uh he provided that we were able to make there and just to be a blessing to them so they're sending their G greetings to you and I'm pretty sure they're probably watching the uh stream a lot BCF and so those are my announcement let's stand up and read the word of God and just relax and let me relax too so if if um if if it's just uh if it's lengthy we're going to stop it somewhere because by uh 8:30 so I start to become nervous so so we can we can get it out of the way the scripture is in the book of [Music] Psalm chapter 33 it's a familiar scripture and we're going to just be just rehearsing what we we know and just to see the goodness of Our Lord 33 and we can start at verse 12 and it says blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance wow that's a mouthful there but we won't be speaking on that so we're going to be going down there because that could take probably 100 of years just to dissect about his own inheritance there 13 says the Lord look look from Heaven he beholdeth all the sons of man from the place of his habitation he lookth upon all the inhabitants of the earth he fashion their hearts alike he consider all their works there's no King saved by the multitude of an host a mighty man is not delivered by much strength and horse is is a vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver any by his great strength behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him upon them that hope in his Mercy to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine let's have a word of prayer together precious Heavenly Father father we have again approached this moment that every Mortal father takes a step back to behold what you are about to say sometimes you can speak in little small voice some something just so simple but you know how to plunge it into our heart and father as we have come this evening we are that blessed nation that blessed the inheritance of yours because we know that you have purchased us through the blood of your begotten son our Lord Jesus Christ father we were unworthy we were not even called of of of you but now we can call you father and thank you for giving us that grandest opportunity that the Mortal cannot give to anyone as we have come father we cannot approach you without asking for you you to forgive us our our mistakes and shortcoming father we have seen Lord in all these messages father have been coming through Lord for the two months here not only you have given us your precious message but father you are now dealing with our hearts to hold this blessedness of the Lord in our heart cleanse us father from inside out and Lord and as we have come we just to want to appreciate to you for all that you do for us how you have Lord put a group of people here each individual loving you with a special love father I know that you see each and every one of us here Lord thank you for ordaining us to life for putting something inside each and everyone that can father love you that can look towards you alone and father as we have come we know that you will not Lord turn us hungry we're now thanking you for blessing our pastor and his daughters on a trip far away Lord to the end of the world and Lord you have used him Lord to fulfill your Great Commission men were to do it and father you allowed and ordained that my brother our pastor and his daughters could be there to be used of you and you did that now they are on their way home and father maybe with the the the lapse in in the time we just ask that you will give them traveling Mercies and father that you will give renew their strength as they come back and father as Lord as they come we are anticipating a testimony a report to know what you are doing among your children because we heard the great news that you are the same yesterday today and forever and we know that you are you were there to do what you always know how to do better than anyone else know know we ask now father that you will be with us here as we open the scripture that you'll give us a thought that you Lord you put me aside and just Lord let me be a conduit that Lord I can you can use me to say something that would encourage someone this evening that you'll prepare the hearts of your beloved children father just to receive it father to glorify your name we're here for one purpose everything is for you looking up to you you created us just for you and there's no one who would take any credit for anything we love you father we thank you bless now your word in Jesus Christ name we pray amen you may be seated praise be to his name I'm pulling up uh I was as I was back there you know you can come back there you preparing May putting some scriptures together and then something comes up before you just want to just put it out you might not even cope with the line of your what you were about to talk but this is so tremendous that in this time just think that God is not wasting any second on you he's not resting yet he will rest remember that the only time in the Book of Genesis when God could take his rest it was when that image was standing there on Earth image both male and female in Perfection then God took a rest as long as you and I we have not reached that what we've been ordained to he is working on you every second even things that you think that these are hindrance this is just killing me this is just you know what it is perfectly working before God perfectly working before God he say that before Jesus could be born he was the king who gave a degree decree there that you have to go be back in your hometown to to to give tax people said this is Harsh great Jehovah in heaven is said he's just fulfilling my purpose on Earth he has to be born there back there in Bethlehem so the the the clock is just taking on time the only thing we need and that's probably the title of our uh sermon this evening the eye of the Lord once you have that eye because he will give you a permission to look through it once you get to look through that eye things change amen amen amen the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him so there there was a little secret there to tap into that eye amen it requires fear the fear of the Lord now just think that the prophet of God said he's gone to prepare a place prepare place you we think might be doing up there he's preparing that place right now through you and me he's preparing his own place inside of that body that you are there he playing preparing that that place there he said he's gone to prepare a place a perfect place where no evil exists perfect place no sickness exists no old age exists no death exists it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there you have to be perfect to get there our start here was already imperfect right where you where are you going to start from yes something has to happen yeah amen and he said the Bible said so Jesus said be there perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect wow it's a perfect Kingdom God is not calling us to be an average believer yes average Believers were in seven Church ages amen they were fine there yeah fine and Justified checked out an average believer this group of people this is not an average believer amen she is the Crim of the crop of the Divine Divine institution amen a perfect so if we had that probably denomination mind that let me just be a believer as long as paying my tithe checking my box my good religion saying my little prayer here being in the fellowship that's not it it doesn't work in this generation it doesn't work we've been called up to be the perfect because he said it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people to come in because you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God listen listen the requ the religion cannot provide that would take something greater than the religion to break us through the sound barrier you must be and you must be a perfect bride not only a bride right no God is looking for a Perfect Bride because you know they also Brides so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God he has provided it yeah yes amen amen now he's Desiring to have a people that will connect it to that perfect word amen that will fear Him amen he can marry them yeah how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God which is the water of Separation yes that washes us from our sin amen that's right blood the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody word am you've got to get wet with it you've got to get wet with it's bleeding you can never be there dry the blood of Jesus Christ think of it dripping bloody word the blood the word of God bleeding blood to wash the bride amen she stands perfect that's not a future T amen right now she stands perfect virgin and adulterated she never sinned in the first place then we can say that our start was perfect right was perfect not in my sight amen through his eye am yes I can see that we can see that amen she was trapped into it yes we were trapped into that as we coming back to the reading of the scripture here I'm starting to get nervous on the time now so I'm taking the second part of the scripture which says that there's no King saved by the multitude of an host a mighty man is not delivered by much strength a horse 177 a horse is a vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver any by his great strength now David is talking about we know that the king a king is the highest in every hierarchy of men the men who can have as many the host that he would want a great number following him and in every Kingdom the strange thing is when you are in the Kingdom a subject could give his life for his King in any sit any condition in the countries like in America no you're free you cannot give your your life for any for for any president especially the ones we have right now and the one after if we have someone after but in the Kingdom every subject in the Kingdom if they want to spare the King's life they can kill even until to the last subject in the Kingdom that's how the that's the difference between the kingdom and any other any other power or any other Nation governed by president now David is saying that regardless how many host how large is the number of people in in any kingdom yes it can they can never save that King amen right so the number doesn't count yeah amen they can kill even to the last subject will never save a king not only look uh coming from the King coming now to leaving the king coming to Men He said even the Mighty Man his strength his power his virtue can never never deliver him amen so there's no Deliverance out of outside of any strength and they bringing in even an horse which is the the the the the the the strongest animals they representing power said even the power cannot provide you there's no power that can provide you safety your salvation there's no number of people that can provide you that that salvation no power no might of any man no no ability of any man that can provide you that and then David is giving us a secret that secret is the eye of the Lord amen amen is upon them that fear Him upon them that hope in his Mercy so rather than surrounding yourself with Mighty Men surrounding yourself with a large number of people that can fight for you with the with the powers on this Earth and horse or horses no David said that's everything is in vain you only need one thing you need that eye from the Lord to be upon you to to guide you and if you take a Psalm let's read it bit Psalm 25 chapter 25 verse 12 starting there says what man is he that fearth the Lord there's a question there him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose so the the Lord will teach that man that fear fears him his soul shall dwell at ease and his seed shall inherit the earth the secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him there's a secret there in the fearing of the Lord and He will show them his Covenant he has a secret and he has a covenant amen mine eyes are towards the Lord for he shall pluck my feet out of the out of the net so there's a secret there and within that Covenant that's where we can find the Salvation within that Covenant we will find a Deliverance within that Covenant we will find our safety and we will find eternal life it is within that Covenant don't know the time if it's allow I see it's it's going fast so the reason there's a covenant here that has certain things and those certain things that are of value God has kept these for his people let's go to Exodus 19 1-6 keep your Bibles handy to see why God is holding this Covenant he's holding it for a people Exodus 19 1- 6 this is God the reminding Moses the reason for which he took his children out of is out of Egypt he said in the third month first chapter uh first verse uh Exodus 19 in the third month when the children of Israel Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt the same day came they Into the Wilderness of Si for they were departed from reiden and were come to the desert of Si and had pitched in the wilderness and there Israel camped before the mount and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel now let's listen to what his the Lord is wanting Moses to tell to the children of Israel he said ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I buar You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed he's giving us a little secret there and keep my Covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto [Music] me above all people for all the Earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which thou shall speak unto the children of Israel so we see that God by taking the children of Israel out of Egypt he had a purpose into that as they were going through the desert they were not walking in the hard the the dry place they were coming onto God himself amen that was the desert was God's provided way to come unto himself amen right your hardship or some CH you have right now let me tell you that those are taking you straight back into the bosom of God am right because he was bringing them not to any country he gave the promise to Abraham not to Israel but he was bringing them to himself to be a peculiar treasure not out there unto himself I like when we don't have to turn in there the book of Deuteronomy says that the Lord has a vouch to thee meaning he has chosen you yeah amen he has avouched to thee this day to be his peculiar people I'm talking let don't leave it 3400 years ago just bring it on your lap amen he has a vouched thee to be his peculiar people as he has promised thee and thou should keep all his Commandments and to make thee I'm talking to you don't look to the one on your left right it's just straight back to you he said and to make thee not an average yeah right above all nations which he has made amen and listen now in Praise this is the only class of people that can give him praise because he chose them unto himself for what for his praise and in name the only people group of people that can bear his name amen and in honor amen the only group of people that can honor God this is this group is here and thou mayest be an holy people unto the Lord thy God as he has spoken so we see that we there was a covenant there he wants us to fear him but we need someone to open the Covenant so we can look into yes I didn't see something but we need someone and that's someone it's God himself and the the the eye of the Lord as we will be reading if we will will not finish it this evening before we even finish the eye of the Lord is God himself he becomes your eye praise God there are so many benefits When You fearing the Lord Psalm 37 34:7 said you don't have to turn the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him he doesn't send more than one Angel it's himself yeah sometimes we say the Angels no that's God's Own job Amen to encamp about them that fear Him that's his own personal job he doesn't command any angel in heaven he said I'm there this is my personal job to watch over them to keep them and to give them my eye Psalm 8 859 says surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him that glor that Glory May dwell in our land Psalm 14711 the lord taketh pleasure in them just think that the Lord desires to take pleasure in you in you whether you don't you don't sing or you not maybe you don't know how to play instrument like myself but he wants to take pleasure in you amen amen remember the first time now let's look into the fear before we we walk into the Eyes eye of the Lord the first time ever recorded that the angel of the Lord Lord is seeing a fear the fear in a man this is when he spoke to Abraham when he asked Abraham to offer his son for a burnt offering Abraham took uh Isaac went with him to the to mount uh Mariah to offer him when he was about to offer to plunge the knife into Isaac the Lord the angel of the Lord spoke yes he said that's the Genesis 22:12 you don't have to turn unless you fast and he said let me start at 11 or 10 and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord cth unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearth God Amen seeing thou has not withheld thy son thine only son for me and Abraham lifted up his eye his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in in a Thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the the RAM and offered him up a burnt offering instead of his son that there where the first time the third pool was manifested the first time it was manifested back then they asking him Abraham are you coming his the his servant said are you coming back said I'm coming back with the lad Isaac dad but here's the the the the the wood and where's the the fire the wood where's the the ram the the sacrifice Abraham is speaking something that God is going to bring into an existence amen amen he's saying this is Genesis 22 don't have to turn in I can read it 1 and two and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham the prophet of God said that God does not tempt he tested Abraham with he's is bringing correction to that translation amen that God did test Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou Lov and get theee into the land of Mariah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of at the verse 8 of the same chapter and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together this is the answer that the father is giving to his son who was about to die said God himself will provide and in Genesis 2213 God is honoring a word of a man who feared him the third poor coming into an existence not even counting on his word that Abraham go offer your son God said not I I will let my my word not even fulfilled but the for the man that has feared me his word will come into an existence amen now fear is not being afraid right amen no no God never forced anyone to do anything he's a gentleman amen fear is not being afraid right because he take simply take thy son Abraham has full right to say I'm not doing it this time God would not have forced him amen that's right but the the angel of the Lord will be giving us the interpretation of the fear of the Lord himself still in the Book of Genesis Genesis 221 15-18 tells us and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time after Abraham had showed to the angel of the Lord how he feared him how he feared God God is calling him for the second time out of heaven and said by myself have I sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and hath not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gat the Gate of his enemies 18 is giving us the clue and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed be because thou has feared me he's giving us the translation of the fear because thou has obeyed my voice that is the fear of the Lord it's simply obeying God's voice he's not pushing on you it's something that comes out of you and once you obey God's voice his eye will be upon you we will see how that eye comes upon you the prophet of God says in the Jehovah Gyra message Jehovah Gyra preaching 1961 he said so we find out then just as he started to stab his own little son to death speaking about Abraham speaking of of of Abraham the Holy Spirit must have cut his hand said Abraham Abraham stay your hand I know now that you fear God I know that you love me obeying his voice is loving him amen ecclesiast uh 1213 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man oh my goodness this is the conclusion of the whole matter amen this summarizing everything that we will ever do on Earth just see how the Holy Spirit has been dealing with us here the message has been given to men it's more than 50 years ago but look how the pride of life how things God is unfolding he just to now you have the message now I'm dealing with the inside of you how would you did brother Ben had eyes to see he had full eyes he still had them but why didn't he see that yes meaning that someone is giving him a set of eyes now amen and importing the same set of eyes to all of us praise God amen cuz that eye will tell you differently from your own eyes it goes deeper inside of us and that's the proof that he's Among Us and he wants to dig deeper inside of us God do it am the prophet of God says this in the message respects preached in 1961 he said Solomon said also in the Proverbs that the fear of the of God is the beginning of wisdom now that don't mean that you are afraid of him but that means that you are giving respects and reverence and when you respect God you fear God you fear fear that this is it you fear that you might displease him in some way you fear less you would do something wrong it's no longer fighting trying to to become I when he's looking at me let me let me stay this way no I I don't want to do something that's wrong to him it's it's your at your disposal amen no if if if the message is something that someone is beating you with I was listening to the message last Sunday here taking almost same words we were sharing in uh in Fresno on Saturday I said you can have this message and kill the people with it rather than taking it to heal Amen to encourage to bind yeah to bring together amen and we've done that without maybe knowing it little harsh but now right now we're growing we're maturing how to use the power that has been given into to us in our hands this is God himself given to us his full being in our in our disposal what are we going to do with it amen he molding us how we can use it he said I fear my mother the prophet of God say I fear my wife I fear my my church I fear all God's servants unless I should put a stumbling block somewhere in their way is that a warness yeah right and that love because it's a love that is incentive to that fear right amen it's a motivated it's not motivated by anything else it's love the love towards God towards another and that love brings a fear not what men calls a fear to be afraid no it puts you you into the fellowship with that person I fear the people I fear the people of the city unless I should do something wrong that would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian that's the fear of the Lord and Samuel even said behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken the fat of rams so the eye of the Lord does more than just beholding or looking from heaven or looking at what we are doing or contemplating no he does more than than that let's take uh Psalm 32 here's David David is regretting for his sin he's crying out he's confessing and during his confession as he's singing we know that these are songs he's been singing and worshiping crying out we will hear that there's someone now talking no more David still using d David's mouth but it's God speaking through David 325 starts I acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgive forgest the iniquity of my sin for this shall everyone that is Godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of Great Waters they shall not come nigh unto him Thou Are art my Hiding Place Thou shalt preserve me from trouble Thou shalt Compass me about with song of Deliverance Sila in the next verse 8 still David but it's now God giving a straight message to David's you still using David's mouth he said I will in instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shal go I will guide thee with my eye that's the guiding that we need if God can guide you but this eye is not only to look for to look at you to behold you to contemplate you it's there even to guide you the prophet of God said in the message I don't have it here he said the pillar of fire was God's eye in that time Amen to guide the children of Israel back to their Homeland but that eyes is still here in the message Revelation chapter 4 part two the prophet of God said preached in 1961 he said now what is a man he's going to be we're going to be entering into the eye that is guiding that is supposed to be guiding David the prophet of God is saying now what is a man he is a Triune being Body Soul and Spirit how many knows that Watch God's approach what is his heart you remember my message God chose a man's heart for his control tower now we're listening now God is choosing man man's heart to be his control tower the control tow is to be able to see further the devil chose his head for his control tower yeah God is chosen the heart of man for his control tower and the devil is chosing the head of man for his control tower see the devil he makes him see things the Devil Makes he choose chose the head he makes men see things right to look through his eyes the devil looking through eyes of a man but God chose his heart where he makes him believe things that he cannot see amen this one has a head yeah with both eyes and Satan can make him see things right and God is choosing one in the heart a control tower amen not here a control tower down yeah right and then he makes him believe things that these could not see meaning God Imports this one another set of eye to see remember when Satan attacked Adam's bride in the beginning he started the attack was on her eyes in Genesis we don't have to turn in Genesis 3 5 said for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as God Gods knowing good and evil now these eyes were not closed yeah Adam's eyes were open his bride's eyes were open amen but Adam is coming his head for something meaning that he wanted to have access to Adam's bride's eyes so he can start showing her things and when the woman saw still had two set of eyes they were always open but she never saw that way right amen someone made her see things yeah amen when she the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes yesterday she did not see that she had it for how long no one knows he wasn't pleasant still with the same eyes but right now because something happened there's a conversation there is an encounter she's seeing now things are different she's seeing what Satan wanted to see through her so Satan took over her head and made her see things right she say it's says it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were opened but they were not they were not closed because those eyes they were no longer using them they were some power the devil because the devil got a a hold of their heads now he's making them see things right right see it beautiful that God still know how to get his children he still left them a sense of hearing because they heard the voice yeah right of the Lord Walking In The Garden in the C of the evening yeah proverb 27:20 says hell and destruction are Never full so the eyes of men are never satisfied listen to this cunning enemy of God once he gets a hold of this head and then start looking through your eyes you will never be satisfied how much you can have right you will never be satisfied but glad in re 3:18 hearing a voice counseling us to buy I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in with and white Ren that thou mayest be clothed in that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear in anoint thine isav thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see the prophet of God says that God's eye this is in the God's eye message preached in 1958 okay good God's eye has been with the prophets Through the Ages yes amen not these yeah because God got a hold of the heart they were seeing things that these two could not see so God's eye has been with the prophet through the age ages that could see ahead of time what was going to happen meaning when you see a prophet arriving on the scene know that God's eye is on on the earth amen amen yes he said before there was a one drop of water that fell from the heavens Noah seen the rain coming he did not use this amen something was inside his heart that was able to go 20 years see things that were happening and and once you see that with The Eye Inside you can see nothing else but that somewhere the prophet of God said that once you see this message you will see nothing else but this message once you see Christ you see nothing else but Christ amen because you're not using this that eye is amen down there right it sees where nobody else is able to see he said there was never been any rains from Heavens the skies were always clear there were no clouds never had been a cloud upon the Earth why because it was God's program to water vegetation through the springs and things but Noah because God said that eye is connected to God's voice amen that eye is connected to God's saying amen and when it's connected there's a fear there love there because he will never allow anything in but Noah because of because that God said it's going to rain he saw the rain coming 12 120 years before one drop fell it's a long range Vision yeah amen amen and he made preparations to get away to get away from it and ever since he heard that word there was something beating in his bosom like a puls it's it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain so just think for 12 years this is what was beating in in in Noah's heart even when they were inside of the the ark was already built sitting there went 7 days no drain even his family testing time came I can see no as wife said husband could you review that that message you preached the other day even the sons yeah amen yes but the prophet of God said is they were sitting there the seventh day they felt something got loose in the bottom she was floating yeah Noah was resting that eye the eye of the Lord is the only thing that can give you rest amen it shows you exactly who you are where you are and then you are resting Amen in the message looking at the Unseen the prophet of God says Noah waited believed moved with fear the same fo we spoke about with the love of God obeying his voice right and built an ark all people were criticizing the the old fellow must have been crazy but yet no Cloud had ever come before there was a cloud before there was a drop of water in the sky Noah with the Unseen of the natural eye with his spiritual eye tuned to the word of God he saw the rain falling excuse me and he said in the same message he said now there had never been any rain before and so science would would have said to him where's the rain coming from and so forth but Noah had caught the voice of God that eye is catching the voice of God in your day and obeying it amen Noah caught the voice of God and seen God's program there was great things that so many Miss saying is God's program and you know the prophet of God says also that when Enoch saw Noah building the ark Enoch started getting ready there was an eye inside of his heart said the catching up is Drawing Near I like how the prophet of God dramatized said going to tell his wife honey I'm going to be I used to go this direction walking around this time I'm going to go on the other side giving her a kiss and kissing his children grandchildren and then he was caught up in the message from that time few more minutes from that time the prophet of God says sometimes when you meet God he makes you believe things that the natural mind can't conceive amen right there is something about him when you meet him it changes you and makes you a different person you look through different eyes from that time on for the time sake he said in the message God's eye the great eye of Jehovah Jesus was looking through his eyes looking through Jehovah's eye the same eye that God is going to be giving you to look through as he gave to his son the Lord Jesus to look through he's going to give to his bride to look through the same eye he said it must have been Jehovah's eye that he was looking through when Simon came up and he told him that his name was Simon and he was going to change it to cus and told him his father's name was Jonah he just had to be God's eyes that he was looking through it could have been nothing else but God's eye when he told Nathaniel that you are a man with no gu there couldn't be nothing else but through God's eyes when he saw that woman at the world who had many husbands he looked through God's eye am he said he couldn't do it couldn't be nothing else but God's eyes he was looking through when he saw that woman who touched him the board of His Garment Peter saying but you have the multitudes everybody's touching you but he looked through a different eye yeah his natural eyes never even caught that but he was looking through a different set of eye because he was in contact he had the voice he was the voice and he was fearing God as Jesus said in John 4 14:19 he said yet a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me because I live you shall also live so God's eye reflects his will that's the prophet saying it he said God's eye reflects his Spirit he said God's eye reflects his word spirit will and his word amen in the message the resurrection he said the Holy Ghost had him speaking about about Steven he said he had him wrapped up till he wasn't his own he only looked through God's eye he only seen what God sin and tonight ask God to open our eyes as the M musician you might be coming up I don't 1 to stop 30 let us tonight ask God to open our eyes and give us sight and let his Spirit come into our hearts that he can look through our eyes he will not use this he will place one there in our heart in this eye look at the things that people cannot see yeah yeah this bride is seeing when this world is completely distracted the bride of Christ is seeing a perfect union perfect wedding with a perfect husband he said he's giving us a little story of the little boy that went to his mom and asking mom can I see God his mom said no no you cannot see God go ask the Sunday school teacher Sunday school teacher said the same I don't know how to do that I cannot show you God go to the pastor the Pastor said no you cannot see God until he found that man that the prophet of God describes an old man who was uh on the water in the Ohio river and he said you have to have you have to have God in in here to see him out there God on the inside Looking Through Your Eyes the only way you can see God has to be inside first and it comes when there's
