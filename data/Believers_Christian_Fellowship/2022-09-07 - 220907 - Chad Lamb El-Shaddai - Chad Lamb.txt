words lord that'll bring us comfort that will bring us correction that will teach us the way in which we should live and may you get preeminence among each one of us lord as we yield ourselves to you and have your way in this place and be glorified amongst us we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you while we're standing let's turn to genesis chapter 17 together genesis chapter 17 and we'll begin by reading a portion of scripture there i'm in genesis chapter 17 verse 1 and when abraham was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thou thy name shall be called abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee and i will make thee exceedingly fruitful and i will make nations of thee and king shall come out of thee and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and i will give unto thee unto thy seed after thee the land wherewith wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god amen god bless you as you seated may lord bless his word amen i want to look at verse 1 and take from there our subject tonight when he says i am the almighty god this is a term that's used for the first time in our bible when he says almighty god and that term is actually el shaddai and i'd like to minister tonight on el shaddai for a little while but when he says i am the almighty god the el shaddai he says walk before me and be thou perfect and he says i will make my covenant between me and thee and i will multiply thee exceedingly now god begins to declare what he's going to do this is what i'm going to do i'm going to keep my covenant between thee and me i am going to multiply thy sea i have out of you are going to come many nations i will bring you to the land i will establish your seed and my promise with thee and i see that i will do this i will do this i will do this praise almighty god so when god uses this new term uh and and expressing himself to abraham he uses this term that's in our bible almighty god but the term is el shaddai after he uses this term el shaddai he begins to say i'm going to do this i'm going to do this i'm going to do this i'm going to do this amen so he wasn't depending on abraham and abraham's strength he wasn't depending on abraham's ability he was telling abraham i am el shaddai and this is what i'm going to do so i'd like to look at what brother better says about this term el shaddai it's very interesting in the in the message god of the provided way from 1956 said if you break those words down sometimes maybe i'd like to have a revival at the tabernacle here in jeffersonville when we can get our tent and things set up somewhere where we could take those words and break them down and see what they mean just the meaning of those words the almighty in hebrew is el shaddai which means the breast like a woman abraham i'm coming to you in the name of the breasted one the nurse the life-giver this is so interesting the the word picture that the bible's painting and what brother bannon picks up on amen is going to it means so much to me amen and i hope to share that the way it's come to me he says like a little baby when it's sick you know the mother holds it to her breast and she nurses it and the little baby is fretting and crying and skinny but it just lays there and nurses and gets strong where is it nursing its life from from the mother and god appears to us today as el shaddai the breasted one both of them the new and old testament just as full of promises as they can be not a breast but the breast excuse me but the breast did too amen and he's showing that's it's it's not it comes from the root word shad which is breast for a woman amen but it should die and he says it's brother bremtel says it's plural the breasted god and he types it right back with the new and old testament amen it's the word of god amen that's giving his children strength amen brother branham also types it with salvation and healing amen the the the two places that draw strength for salvation and for healing amen he also says in the message the approach to god from 1955 he says the word in hebrew l almighty means el shaddai which means the almighty one or el means god and shadow means breath should die is in the plural i am the almighty the strong one the all-sufficient one you see it now abraham watched what that name was that he appeared i am the el shaddai in other words i am the breasted one abraham the god really the word shad comes from in the bible it means like the woman the place the nursing place of the baby in other words abraham i am the strong one i am the life-giver not only a life-giver like a baby fretting i am the satisfier the little baby if he's fretting sick still got the tummy ache as long as he's laying on his mother's arms nursing it satisfies him oh my you get it he may be sick and this little head is swimming around everything else but if he's laying on his mother's arms his mother's breast nursing it pacifies him no matter how sick you are what takes place how long the lord is answering as long as you're laying on his breast pulling from the word it satisfies the believer amen i think it's interesting this this word picture amen because if you if you take it some of the newer translations of the bible don't write almighty god and if you look in the strong's um not in strong's but here in the scofield bible amen scofield makes a note very similar to what brother brampton taught us amen so i'm sure he read these notes and he tells us the same thing but he says it's a shame that this term has been translated almighty god because the name el already means the mighty one he as l and elohim he is already the mighty one he is already the almighty he's already the strong one amen so it's it's it's like a redundant term the almighty god el already covers the fact that he's the mighty one and he's god but shaddai brings another expression of the nature of god and it shows that god is the one who can supply amen like a mother can supply for her baby and if you catch the word picture here when an infant is born to a mother amen that infant needs nothing else but what comes from mother amen so mother in order to sustain the life of this infant amen mother becomes the all-sufficient one for life mother becomes the all-sufficient one for comfort she becomes the all-sufficient one for strength amen you take a fretting infant you know you take one that's a few weeks old amen and fretting and upset and and and maybe not feeling well or whatever amen there's no nothing that dad can do amen amen your dad you love this baby this baby is part of you 23 of its chromosomes have come from you you you're part of making this life amen but you don't have what the baby needs amen what mother has is what the baby needs and she becomes the all-sufficient source of life and comfort in everything this baby needs so when god comes to abraham he is saying i am the all-sufficient one i am everything you need i will keep my covenant i will raise you up a nation i will restore your sin i will i will i will all you have to do is come to me and draw strength and draw life and draw satisfaction amen and god is still today el shaddai amen he is all i need he has everything i need we don't need anything else we need the almighty god el shaddai amen the all-sufficient one who's the creator of life and the sustainer of life and the great comforter at the same time amen that little infant you know when it gets to feeling bad and needs something amen there's nobody that can satisfy it like mother when it lays against mother and all is well amen all is well and it begins the the el shaddai becomes the great comforter and becomes the great satisfier now the baby is satisfied but but the the comfort and satisfaction aren't the only thing being gained amen at mother's bosom because it is satisfied the baby is comforted and when we come to the word of god and receive the promises of god it satisfies us it comforts our heart amen but it does something else it puts strength into the baby amen it puts strength it puts life that brings strength that will actually bring growth and bring the word to pass it's coming amen as the child of god connects to god and begins to draw from god the word the promises that are made amen it not just satisfies but it gives strength amen the strength to bring the word to pass that's what god was coming to abraham he had already given abraham a promise is that right abraham already had a promise he already had the word he was already told amen that he'll be a father amen but now comes el shaddai who says now i'm i'm the strength of that word amen i'm the life source for that word if you come to me i'll provide the strength to bring that word to pass praise god this morning i'd like to or this evening it's not morning god help us we're going to read quite a few scriptures so if you can turn with me to the book of psalms and keep your bibles handy i'd like to read quite a few scriptures psalms 121. we'll begin there psalms 121 verse 2. my help cometh from the lord which made heaven and earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not slumber my help the helper my helper the one who's helping me is the one who made heaven and earth do you need another helper are you looking for a better helper who else would you turn to for help he says my help cometh from the one who made heaven and earth this is a huge statement friends the one who's helping me the one who's aiding me the one who's comforting me he's the one who made heaven and earth i don't need to go anywhere else for help this is my source of hell then he then he goes on to say he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not slumber he's not sleeping on the job but he's he's steadily watching after you amen because he won't slumber he can bring you into rest you can rest at the bosom of god drawing from his strength drawing from his word you can take a refuge in his arms you can take rest amen at his word amen because he won't sleep he'll watch over you and bring that word to pass you can rest because he's not resting praise god there is a place of rest amen it's drawing from god's word amen psalms 28 let's turn back here and read psalms 28. psalm 28. and verse 6 psalm 28 and verse 6 blessed be the lord because he hath heard the voice of my supplication the lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusteth in him and i am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoices and and with my song will i praise him the lord is their strength and he is the saving strength of the anointed save thy people and blessed on inheritance feed them also and lift them up forever who's my strength the lord is my strength who's my helper the one who made heaven and earth who is keeping my foot from slipping the one who's not sleeping amen amen i need el shaddai i need the strength that comes from his word i need the one amen that will draw me close and provide everything that i have need of but branham says in 1965 in the message i have heard but now i see he says now just like abraham when he was 90 and 9 years old i believe in genesis 17 god appeared to this old man now 99 years old when he was almost 100 years old and they had been waiting upon that promise all these years he appeared to him in the name of el shaddai the breasted one and what an encouragement it was yet the promise wasn't fulfilled then but abraham i am the almighty god el shaddai the strength giver the breasted god like i've told you before like the little baby that's fretting and sick and crying and it lays upon its mother's breast and nurses his strength back from her because it's satisfied while it's a nursing because the only access it has and knows of is the mother's breast it knows no dose of medicine you might give him a dose of medicine he'd squeal and cry give him a shot in the arm he'd carry on but the only access to satisfy him is the mother's breast and he said abraham you're old your strength is gone your arms are withered up your manhood's gone but i am your mother that's what the prophet of god said i am your mother just take a hold of my promise and be satisfied while you're waiting be rested amen oh praise be to god he says i brother branham says i'm your mother amen i'm going to care for you i'm going to nurture you in the message thirst from 65 he says notice jerusalem the word jerusalem is from above the bible said which is the mother of us all and christ is our mother we realize that god is our mother for we are born of him amen so we know that god amen is represented in both male and female god has male attributes and female attributes amen so god is our father and our mother and then he takes on both attributes as he relates himself to mankind amen and and there's an attribute of mother where he will give of himself he'll give of his own life he'll give of his own strength and he'll give it amen to his waiting child amen who can nurse from him from drawing from him that life stream that word amen that that stream that they need to live and to grow amen and take courage and take strength he'll give of himself because the mother gives of herself to her child amen when the when the baby needs something it needs its mother it needs strength it needs nourishment it needs comfort it needs all of those things she'll take that little infant amen and take that infant to herself and she will give of herself of her strength to the baby even sometimes when mom is weak and tired and up in the night amen and not feeling well it doesn't change anything she'll still give her strength to that child amen she'll give her strength in the middle of the night in the morning all day long amen she'll give her strength to that child because that's the only source the child has it has no other option but to come back to mama and get comfort get strength and find rest in the arms of mother amen we need the we need to we need to have that same approach unto god sometimes i have no other place to go i have no other option amen there's no nothing else that's going to give me strength for life there's nothing else that'll make this word come to pass i've got to get a hold of this live stream from god and i've got to draw and draw and draw and rest in his arms will i draw from him the strength i need and then he will perform his word he will bring it to pass praise god almighty we need god to be our mother and our father what care what love what what an ability to provide all that we need so the word picture for the word picture for us that the bible's painting that brother brenham opens up for us in understanding is there is a there is a people who have no other option there are people who don't have a plan b there are people who who who don't find their own way they can't get their own anything amen there is a people on this earth that know no better than to come back to the source of life come back to the one that brought them forth and keep drawing strength and nursing amen from the word of god and pulling down everything we have need of because there's a people on the earth that don't have anywhere else to go amen god's not giving us denominational bottles and denominational formula but he's giving of himself amen his word is himself the life of the word is his very own life and he's giving us life as we draw from his word there's a there's a people who can't get satisfied anyplace else amen you can't give me an imposter pacifier it might work for a few minutes amen but when no life comes from it i'm gonna spit the pacifier out and call for the real thing amen there's so many pacifiers in life and entertainments and religious societies and religious notions amen they're little pacifiers amen just giving a sucking motion to satisfy and quiet down the nerves of some people but there's no life coming from that pacifier there's no word stream life coming amen and that baby will only be pacified for so long amen because it's got to have strength and it can't get it anywhere else from god but from god almighty so we need to spit all the religious pacifiers out and forget all the man-made formula and come back to the one that gave us life come back to the one that birthed us in the word and draw from them life praise god let's look at isaiah together isaiah 49. isaiah 49 and verse 15. [Music] isaiah 49 15 can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget yet will i not forget thee we have a better spiritual mother than that they may forget and look what he goes he goes to the strongest human bond that you can find between a mother and her suckling child it is one of the strikes the strongest human bond that there is is between a mother and a suckling child and he says is it even possible for a mother to forget her child if it is even possible yea though she may i will never forget thee my bond with you will never be broken even if it's possible for the strongest attachment on earth maybe in some wicked form a woman amen can become detached from her suckling child but god never will detach from you he will never put you away amen he will never detach from his child he'll never forget his child let me go and read this next verse behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me this is the god who's watching for your foot not to slip because he never sleeps amen when when this el shaddai come to abraham abraham had no strength to perform the word physically his body was finished his stream of life was dried up there was no possibility for him to bring forth to perform the word of god but he didn't need to perform the word of god all he had to do was lay in the arms of el shaddai all he had to do was trust in the promise that was given to him and if he'll trust in the promise and draw life from the promise the word of god will produce its own life in him amen and change his very body [Music] in the message jehovah jireh from 1964 the prophet of god says he is still el shaddai you believe that i i don't just believe that i need that to be true it's not just i believe that he still should die i need him to remain el shaddai amen when i'm all tore up and i and i'm in a mess and i don't know what's happening and i get nervous and i get upset i need el shaddai amen and when i get to where i get weak and i need some strength i need el shaddai i need him to remain el shaddai i need him to always remain the faithful one who will not forget me even if a woman can forget her suckling child he'll not forget me and there's a source that i can go to in times of need for comfort and for strength he is still el shaddai he is still the breasted god new and old testament just draw your strength from it oh everything you have need of the baby he is helpless he has to pull his strength from his mother that's the only way he can get his strength that's the only way a believer can get his strength is to pull it from the word of god that is his strength god's promise to him stand by it and believe it listen nothing else will produce everything else is a weak substitute there's nothing there's no form of entertainment there's no form of man's wisdom there's no form of man's religion there's no form of psychology there's nothing else that will produce what we have need of amen only el shaddai giving us his strength and us nursing from him from his word the strength we need it's the only thing and we need we need to recognize that we as children of god are just as helpless as a newborn baby without its mother we as children of god without el shaddai are just as helpless and doomed to failure and death is it an infant is without its mother we without without el shaddai are in the same place [Music] and if we would realize that we would be ten times better off than we are today all of our problems all of our failures all of our mistakes is because we thought we had a little strength and we thought we knew what to do we thought we could overcome and we thought we could do a few things and we tried some other techniques or we tried some other ways instead of just sticking with the word and coming to the word and drawing from the word we tried a little reasoning and we tried a little tradition and we tried a little of somebody else's ideas and somebody else's suggestions and i'll tell you i don't know where it got you but i knew where it got me it's gotten me into heaps of trouble amen i need to realize that there's only one source for my strength is to come back to el shaddai and say oh god i'm laying here for satisfaction for comfort and for strength we need to pull from the word of god and the word of god only amen i think this is why i this me person just a personal preference i hate to see a baby with a propped bottle sitting all by itself and bottle propped over against the thing and mom off doing something else i'm like that's not the picture god painted amen that baby needs to be held needs to be comforted needs to be nurtured needs to needs a mother it needs more than just food it needs comfort it needs to be satisfied by mom that's why god is so gracious to us that he makes his presence known and he promised to be a friend that sticketh closer than a brother amen because he didn't just give us his word and move off somewhere else and treat it like a prop bottle amen but god says come unto me you that are laid in heavy heavy laden weary i will give you rest amen come unto me amen he's not just that i sent my word and now you go deal with it no he sent his word but he says come to me and draw strength amen come to me for comfort come to me for your satisfaction amen he has all that we need and he is all that we need let's go back to psalm 91. psalm 91 verse 1 [Music] he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty this a word almighty should die he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the shaddai the breasted god i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god and him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night for the arrow that flyeth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday why will we not be afraid because i'm under the shadow of el shaddai why will i not be afraid because he's covered me with his feathers i'm underneath his wings what's it mean to be under his wings like a mother brooding over her chicks pulling them to her side and sheltering under her wings she becomes their protection she becomes their safety she becomes their wall of defense that's what god is to us amen he is our security he is our safety he is our satisfier he is our wall of defense he is our fortress he's our shield and buckler he is our strong tower we got the picture amen i think we need to stop being afraid to run to him amen we got to stop being afraid to run to him and say god i need you amen i need you this moment i need you every moment amen i if there's one thing that i wish that i could completely erase from my existence is that it's any form of pride amen it was sewn into humanity at the fall because you see it rise up in cain and when you see it in lucifer and lucifer's nature entered in through the serpent because that was the spirit he was anointed and comes into cain and cain rises up in pride and defiance against god and since that time humanity has been suffering with this curse of pride amen somehow we feel like we can do something or we're strong enough or we have something figured out i said god erase that from me that thing has destroyed my life everything that i have suffered from i've suffered with from human pride but let me be as weak and pitiful as an infant let me consider myself incapable of taking care of myself help me god to see myself as helpless without you help me to see myself as completely dependent upon you amen and then i think we'll get the right picture because when we come to him completely helpless and completely dependent then he pours his strength into us and then the strength that we have to live the life and do the works of god it's not us anymore even jesus says it's not me that doeth the works it's the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works so then when we draw strength amen now it's not our strength it's his strength that's come through his word amen and now it's his word living out through us because it's his strength help us god to recognize that we are helpless without you let's go to matthew 23. matthew 23 and verse 37 matthew 23 and verse 20 i'm sorry matthew 23 and verse 37 o jerusalem jerusalem thou that killeth the prophets and stonethem which are sent unto thee how oft how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gather their chickens under her wings and he would not and you would not same kind of picture jerusalem how oft would i have gathered you as a hen gathers her chicks underneath their wings just like he said in the psalms he covers us with feathers he would have done this for jerusalem but they wouldn't they had their own idea they had their own strength they had their own way of doing things but he was there willing to cover them i say today he's here willing to cover us but we've got to recognize we need to be covered under his wings we need to be under his feathers amen i mean there's so much that we just feel like in the routine of life that we've got covered and we can take care of but i say there's not a day that we can make it without him there's not a moment that we could survive without him we need to be if there's an offer to come under his wings i want to be under his wings if he's present spreading his wings and there's a place of shelter and refuge i want to be under those wings covered with feathers because i don't want to take on the world outside of that shelter outside of that fortress and thank god he's here he gave jerusalem the opportunities that how often would i have done this but you would not it wasn't god's lack it wasn't god's unwillingness it was the people's unwillingness to come under his wings he was there he provided he had the shelter he gave the word he sent the prophets he had everything in place they're the ones who refused and i believe with all my heart el shaddai is still present he's here he's the mighty one he's the breasted god he's got more than enough for comfort for strength for rest but we've got to go to him and draw the message there's a message brother ben preached from that time in 1960 and he says what does the baby have to do he says we are god's babies i don't feel so bad now we are god's babies i want you to get this sisters you all there we're god's babies and what does the baby do when it's sick and freddie it's real freddy and sick now the only thing you have to do the only thing that will pacify it is for the mother to pick it up hold it to her bosom and nurse it now what does the mother do the mother produces the milk and the baby nurses the strength from the mother to the baby then the baby is strengthened by the mother's strength and when we take hold of god's promise into our heart we are nursing god's strength the strong one so when we take god's promise into our heart we're nursing his strength into our life amen we're drawing from him how am i drawing from god amen listen it's not weeping and wailing that's not how we draw from god it's coming to a promise of his word and drawing from that word and saying your word says and i believe your promise and i believe when you said that to be true and then you're drawing strength through the word drawing strength whose strength you're drawing god's strength the one that birthed you the one that gave you life is the strength giver to you through his word so it's not wailing and saying i'm coming to el shaddai i'm coming to el shaddai no if you want to come to el shaddai and latch on and draw life you need to come to the word amen and get a hold of the promise of god and draw life through the promise of god's word amen so many times people get emotional ideas and they get concepts in their mind and they think screaming out and yelling and something is going to be getting god's attention and going to be drawing strength from god no it's coming to him his provided way amen the provided way he's given us in this day he's given his word now he's saying latch on to that word because the word is god amen the word is god and he said the words that i speak unto you jesus said are spirit and they are life amen so where do you get the life from the word remember he said there's he said this is the breasted god plural amen too old and new testament remember when we were preaching on the candlesticks zachariah's vision of the two olive trees what were the two olive trees brother brenham said they were the new in the old testament pouring out of themselves the golden oil the life amen the holy spirit and pouring it into the candlestick which is the type of the church and when when zerubbabel wanted to know what this meant amen the angel said this is the word of the lord and the cerebral not by my not by power not by strength but by my spirit saith the lord where was it coming from the new and old testament pouring its life out into the candlesticks amen where is it coming from el shaddai the breasted god the old in the new testament pouring forth streams of life amen strong living water amen for us to take strength from [Music] keep showing the same picture over and over and over again how do i go get in the arms of el shaddai how do i find el shaddai how do i nurse my strength from el shaddai amen you find this promise for today and get a hold and draw from there and if you really catch the promise of god for this day it'll bring a satisfaction like nothing else it'll bring a rest like nothing else will bring a rest and if you draw from that it'll bring a strength amen to take us from where we are to a complete body change where will the strength come from el shaddai amen from the promised word praise be to god let's go to first kings 19. first kings 19. i love this story because it's elijah and i love this because it shows the tenderness of god with his children first kings 19 verse 1 and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done this is after the mount carmel showdown when elijah challenged the prophets of baal the priest had baal and he had slew them all and ahab goes and tells jezebel and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword excuse me then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying let so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belonged to judah and left his servant there but he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now oh lord take away my life for i am not better than my father's and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and suddenly him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake baked on the coals in a cruise of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee we get a picture here of elijah after the mount carmel showdown he had had a tremendous success in the meetings doing what god had said just obeying the vision that the lord had given him it was tremendously successful it was a showdown amen between uh the the prophets and priests of baal and the prophet of god and god showed up and god performed a miracle amen and was to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers and slew the priest and prophets of baal and had a great victory but then now jezebel puts a threat on his life and he runs away he runs away into the wilderness amen and he climbs under a juniper tree and he asks god to take his life and you know god doesn't rebuke him god doesn't chastise him god doesn't call him names god doesn't belittle him god sends an angel to feed him brother brahma says in 1959 the message what hearst thou elijah he he gives us some background to this story he fills in some of the blanks for us he's the poor little fella skinny laying there in his gray hair hanging over his shoulders god said my servant needs some rest god's mercy to a servant he just laid him down on the bunch of weeds and he went to sleep i'd imagine there was ten thousand angels watching him sleep there's one assurance the believer has though the world turned him down yet god loves him it's one assurance the believer has if the whole world turns you down god still loves the world may call you holy roller they may call you fanatic but if you're true to god there's one sure thing god loves you and his angels are encamped about those who fear him i'd imagine on every limb all around through the place was swarms of angels and god came down and he said my poor little tired servant now i want you to we can think about elijah and brother dramatizing for elijah but you for a moment go to your worst day go to the worst day you've had when you had no more strength to go on when you wished you despaired of life when you wished that you could just go on to the sixth dimension when you wish that you could just you wished it could all be over you wish that that you could just god could just take you on or that we could all go together and the great catching away and under trouble and under stress and and and tired and weak and feeling like a completely worthless as a child of god running away too tired to fight too tired to stand too wore out to even you know stand for truth anymore you're just under a juniper bush you're you're you're finished put yourself there and he said i imagine there's ten thousand angels around those limbs do you think elijah thought so you think he felt like god was watching over him you felt like you think he felt like he was he was the apple of god's eye that god was watching him unless his foot should slip and he was the god that doesn't slumber he was saying god what what good is it i'm no better than my father's just take me now let me die little did he know all around were 10 000 angels watching over him and your worst day never changed god's opinion of you the worst day for a child of god amen is when it comes to the affection of god and god's desire for you and god's plan for you your worst day was no different than your best day because god's thoughts of you doesn't change their eternal god's desire for you doesn't change he had a desire for you before the foundation of the world will god spank a child he'll spank a child and he'll spank you good sometimes but that's because of his love amen but don't ever think that he forgot where you were don't ever elijah under the juniper tree in the wilderness running away amen tired and wanting to die god knew right where he was the angels were camped about him and god was going to take care of him he says i'll read that again he he i'd imagine on every limb all around through the place with swarms of angels and god came down and he said my poor little tired servant he's so nervous and tore up he don't know what to do i'm so glad brother ben preached this i'm so glad he didn't come down and say what good are you you worthless thing didn't you just see what i did how dare you run away how no he said my poor little tire servant he's so nervous and tore up he don't know what to do you think brother branham is not relating himself here you think he doesn't know what elijah feels you think he does you think he's not the poor little tired servant on nov nervous and torah if there's anybody that understands our condition it's god if anybody understands what hybridization did to us it's gone if anybody understands what we were meant to be what the what the perfect plan would have been and what hybridization has done to us and how it's messed up our minds and weakened our bodies and weakened our everything about us god understands what happened to us amen at the fall and it's god who with tender mercy promised to watch over us and hold us in his hand and not lose us amen you think all of a sudden god's disappointed in you god's disappointed in me because we get weak we get nervous we get all tore we want to run away and we think somehow god's displeased and will cast me away he understands where the nervousness came from he understands where the self-doubt came from he understands amen where all of this came from amen it came from the fall it came from hybridization and now you're affected because every generation gets weaker and wiser amen and our bodies are still continually breaking down and our minds are breaking down with it and god knows so don't think he's mad at you just because you get weak and tore up and all nervous listen to what the prophet says next this is god now coming down this is what god is saying my poor little servant tired servant he's so nervous and tore up he don't know what to do i want to pick out the angel standing here that's got the softest hands says listen don't you scare him walk over and stroke his brow right easy and i want the best cook among you and go up there and get all the vitamins that you can find and put them in this corn meal the world's turned him down but i'm going to treat him right hallelujah that means praise our god don't get scared of that bring forth the best that we got cook him a corn cake set him down some water and this soft-handed angel went over and stroked the little servant of god on the brown remember if you've done your best god still got those angels in order he loves you just the same as he loved elijah if you've done your best to serve him and you get all war on get tired and you get weak and you get to where you just don't think you go on don't forget he loves you just the same as he loves elijah and he's still got some angels that can tend to you it says the angel said he and he stroked his brown and elijah woke up and i may hear him say something like this the lord your god who loves you you've done your best elijah i only sent those signs for a witness that in the day of the judgment they'd have to stand it alone you've done just as i told you to do i know you're tired and weary now and the lord god creator of heavens and earth has sent me to feed you this bread in this water elijah rubbed his eyes raised up little frail shaking hands took a hold of that the bread and eat it just then the great angelic choir come out formed a little panoramic around him like that and began to sing the songs like no mother could coo her baby to sleep let him sleep again then father turned around and said you know i love him so much the journey's great he's got a lot to go through with yet i'm not through with him yet so i must feed him again so he called the angels and dumped in another big bundle of vitamins and cooked up another corn cake and sent him a cruise of water and stroked his brow and fed him again i'm so glad that there is a juniper tree when we get all worn and tore up we can go under that juniper tree and find spiritual vitamins to travel any kind of a trip there he laid woke up feeling a little better and went 40 days and 40 nights i'd imagine if there's a doctor listening in wouldn't you like to know what kind of vitamins he used that'll keep a man on corn cake and a glass of water for 40 days and 40 nights that's the power of our god see the angel brought down a little corn cake full of vitamins but today god keeps dropping us manna from heaven keeps bringing us portions of his word amen full of vitamins for the journey amen and then he brings it down to us and it's his mercy it's his love it's his grace to his children that he keeps bringing when we're all war out and tired he'll bring another corn cake amen he'll bring another man up he'll bring something down he'll send an angel from heaven amen to come at the right season the time and bring some bread from heaven amen and bring it to you amen and bring some water so that you can get strength for that to finish the commission that god has and it was god in his tender mercies it was god and his love for elijah amen he wasn't pushing elijah kicking elijah yelling at elijah but there's a tender side to god when it comes to his children god understands that doesn't mean god won't correct you get out of line he has a rod he has a staff amen but when you've done the best you can and you get all wore out don't worry there's a loving heavenly father that'll send an angel with a corn cake that's got vitamins that'll get you going the next part of the journey why is it we keep playing the tapes amen because it's manna from heaven why is it we keep coming to church amen it's to get the baked corn cakes from our father who's caring for us in the journey there's still more journey left we're not finished here yet there's more to do there's more of god's plan in our lives but oh we need him to come and sustain us we need him when we're at the end of our rope he's got to give some more rope when we have nothing left he's got to give us something to keep us going he's got to be the god who gives nourishment and strength and comfort to the weary we can't give it to ourselves let's go to jeremiah chapter 17. praise god jeremiah chapter 17. jeremiah 17 and verse 7 blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope is whose hope the lord is read that again blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope the lord is that means if you put all your trust in him you're blessed if the lord is your hope you're blessed if you have no other hope you're blessed if you have no other source you're blessed if you have no place else to turn you're blessed if your hope is in the lord and the lord is your hope you're a blessed person amen those those who have options will keep taking options amen but when you come down to no more options then you come back to the source of life and receive the strength that we need for the journey amen the prophet of god says in 1955 he says abraham was an old man a hundred years old when god appeared to him in the name of almighty god the almighty there comes from the hebrew word of el shaddai which means the bosom abreast of a woman now he was old his strength was gone but el shaddai is the almighty the strength giver and all abraham had to do to obtain this promise was lay right on that promise other words like the baby to its mother and nurse from the mother strength for the baby and we do the same thing when we come to god and see his promise we just lay right to him and draw from his word the strength of god given in its course not taking our own mind just believing in after he had endured he obtained the promise what's the secret just lay right to him when you see the promise in the word lay right to him and draw from his word the strength of god how do i get the strength to overcome it comes from the word friends it's the word that's been given to us amen the word has been unveiled amen there's life in that word and that word amen if you draw from that word and nurse from almighty god from the promised word you will draw strength from almighty god and that strength will be the performance of that word it's not what you and i do it's what he does through us amen but not through us as we run all over the place trying to find options but through us as we stay connected to him and draw from him alone then when our strength comes from him that strength performs its own word how does the baby grow tall how does the baby grow along how does the baby grow up how does the baby grow hair how does the baby grow teeth it just nurses that's all it does it just comes back to the one that birthed it and lays upon the bosom of mother and then comfort and satisfaction begins to draw life from mom and that life that comes from the one who gave it life that life is going to bring it into a fuller measure of life and the same thing's happening for us the one that birthed us the one that brought us here amen if we connect back to him his life is going to bring us into a fuller life amen to manifest his word so i want to look at some of these promises i want to send you home with a little list of promises because if you're looking for a place to draw life then the life comes from the word let's go to psalms 103. we're just going to flip through the bible a little bit psalms 103. you can jot these down and go over them and you can add to them because this is certainly not an exhaustive list this is a tiny list but psalms 103 2 bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquity who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies who satisfy us thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles that's what you get from el shaddai this is what comes to you nursing from el shaddai amen write this promise down and read this if you need it amen he's the one that forgives he's the one that uh forgiveth all thine iniquities he healeth all thy diseases amen he gives us life he fills our mouth with goodness he renews our strength like the eagles [Music] let's go to keep your place in psalms we'll come back but let's go to isaiah 53. that was quoted in a prayer request this afternoon or this evening isaiah 53 and 5. isaiah 53 5 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace is upon him and with his stripes we are healed that is still true and still worth quoting there is still life in this scripture there's still a promise of god laying here and we can still draw strength from this word strength for what strength for that word to come into manifestation let's go to matthew 28. we are coming back to psalm we'll be back there in a minute matthew 28. matthew 28 19 go you therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you alway even to the end of the world elijah was running to the end of the world running past beersheba running into the wilderness and he found out god was still there i'm always with you even to the end of the world amen no matter where you go amen if god is alive in you no matter where you go he's still there you're never going to outrun him you're never going to run away from him god knows where you're at and god's still watching over you and he made a promise i'll be with you always even to the end of the world let's go to hebrews 13. i don't know which one of these you need you might need all of them i need them all but we need to encourage ourselves in the lord we need to remember the word that's been given to us and we need to draw from this word amen this isn't a bible amen to carry into church and read once in a while and and memorize a verse this is something to draw strength from this is a gateway a portal amen to the life of god to grab a hold of his promise and receive it by revelation and go to drawing the life that that will fulfill this word right through this promise hebrews 13 5 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper i will not fear what man shall do unto me oh i love that one i'm going to read that one again he said he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee i'm claiming that as my personal promise he will be with me all the way to the end of the world and he said to me to chad lamb by revelation on this word that he will never leave me and never forsake me and the day that i feel the most forsaken he will not forsake me because his word said he won't and he can't amen i'm claiming it as my promise no matter what happens to me this word won't change and his mind won't change about me and his word that he promised to us will not change so so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper a if the lord is your helper what other help do you need amen if the lord the almighty god who created heaven and earth is your helper amen why run anywhere else for help amen why why if the lord is your helper amen why run around like crazy when trouble comes trying to find somebody to help you the lord is your helper be still be steady and know that i am god amen if the lord is your helper and he's promised to be with you always even to the end of the world and he's promised never to leave you nor forsake you and he's promised to watch over you that your foot wouldn't slip and he promised to never slumber then don't run around like you're crazy stand still and say god i'm drawing from these promises strength i'm drawing from this life lord let that word manifest in my life i'm not running anywhere else i don't need a pacifier i don't need a bottle i don't need a formula my the life that i needs coming from this promise today straight from the promise straight to my life praise god let's go back to psalms psalms 34. psalms 34 17. psalms 34 17 the righteous cry all right stop right there don't read anymore do the righteous cry they cry out to god there's times we cry out to god but here's what he said the righteous cry and the lord heareth that's a promise the righteous cry and the lord heareth and delivereth them out of all a double l all their troubles the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saith such as be of a contrite spirit many are saveth such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth them out of them all has anybody had many afflictions then the lord promised he'll deliver you out of them all amen a-l-l is all amen many are the afflictions of the righteous that shouldn't bother us anymore amen because he's promised to deliver us out of them all that's worth remembering let's go to first peter chapter five keep your place in psalm keep a hand inside because we'll come back excuse me and finish there first peter chapter 5 verse 6 first peter 5 and 6 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you this word casting means to throw upon to throw upon our place upon and he's actually telling us to throw all of your cares and this word care means care or anxiety whatever you're worried about whatever stressing you whatever is giving you anxiety he's telling you to throw or place upon him all of your anxieties and cares and it says casting throwing all of your anxiety upon him for he careth for you this word care is is to care about or to take care so cast all of your anxieties on him for he takes care for you you don't have to take care of it he'll take care of it you don't have to worry about it he's got it under control if we could learn to throw all of our cares and anxieties upon him because he takes care or cares for us amen he's made promises that this thing that you're going through will not destroy you he's made promises that this thing that you're going through will not finish you that he's with you in the midst of it that he'll not forsake you that you'll not be plucked out of his hand that your foot shall not slip that he won't go to sleep that he'll never forget about you and he'll be with you all the way to the end of the world amen he is actually caring for your cares if you'll just throw them on him just throw on your cares your anxieties your stresses throw it on him there's nothing in the world you can do about it anyways if there was something you can do about it you wouldn't be anxious for it amen if you could have fixed it you would no longer be under stress because you would have fixed it so the very fact that it's causing you stress and anxiety proves that you can't do anything about it you might as well cast it on him and let him do it and throw it upon him and go back to nursing from his promises and drawing strength from his word amen and as he strengthens you he'll bring every word to pass i have wasted i've wasted i can't unmeasurable amounts of time worrying over things that i could never change i wish i could have back the hours that i spent in fretting anxiously wearing and wringing my hands and pacing the floor and at the end of it nothing changed i'm ashamed at the time that i've wasted fretting and nervous and anxious and worried and tore up and i say god if you can have compassion on poor elijah can you have compassion on me god because i get nervous and tore up and wearing and anxious but god i'm sorry i'm coming to you to draw my strength now i'm coming to you to nurse from you the strength i need to overcome this situation i'm not going to keep running amen running it through my mind if i fix this and maybe if i fix that i'm just giving it i'm just casting it upon you amen and you care for me god let's go back to psalm psalm 36. psalm 36 verse 5 thy mercy o lord is in the heavens and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds thy righteousness is like the great mountains thy judgments are a great deep o lord thou preserve us man and beast how excellent is thy lovingkindness o god therefore the
