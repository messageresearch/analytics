[8:03] to see her here pretty soon
[8:05] so thank you for that let's look in
[8:07] genesis chapter 1
[8:10] verse 27.
[8:14] if you notice we're having a hard time
[8:15] getting completely out of genesis but
[8:18] it's the seed of everything it's the
[8:20] beginning and everything that we see
[8:22] throughout the rest of the bible began
[8:24] in genesis
[8:25] and genesis 1 and 27 says
[8:30] so god created man in his own image in
[8:32] the image of god created he him
[8:34] male and female created he them and god
[8:37] blessed him and god said unto them be
[8:39] fruitful
[8:40] and multiply and replenish the earth and
[8:43] subdue it
[8:44] and have dominion over the fish of the
[8:45] sea and over the fowl of the air
[8:47] and over every living thing that moveth
[8:50] upon the earth
[8:52] amen let's just bow our heads and ask
[8:54] the lord to bless his word
[8:56] lord jesus we thank you for the
[8:58] privilege father of coming here today
[9:01] for we know lord at your grace and your
[9:03] mercy in our lives that has drawn us to
[9:05] yourself and brought us back to this
[9:06] time
[9:08] and god as we look into your word we
[9:10] just ask all that you would come
[9:12] yourself
[9:13] and with your own hands would you take
[9:15] the bread of life and break it for us
[9:17] lord
[9:18] that our eyes might be open and we might
[9:19] see it you who's breaking the bread for
[9:21] us and you
[9:22] who's feeding us lord with the fresh
[9:24] manna from heaven
[9:26] i pray god you'd have preeminence that
[9:27] you would open our eyes to see and give
[9:29] us ears to hear
[9:30] may our hearts perceive all that you're
[9:32] trying to speak to us in this day
[9:34] for this is the day that you're calling
[9:36] us to manifest your word
[9:38] to live your life to manifest your name
[9:40] upon this earth
[9:41] and god we need you we need your word we
[9:44] need your word alive inside of us
[9:46] we ask that you would bring quickening
[9:47] power to make this word live we ask for
[9:50] your blessings now in jesus christ's
[9:52] name
[9:53] amen you can have your seats
[9:57] let's stay in in genesis here we see
[9:59] that
[10:00] there was a commandment given to adam
[10:02] when adam was not yet put in flesh
[10:05] he was still spirit man and he was male
[10:08] and female
[10:09] and he had given a commandment that he
[10:12] should multiply
[10:13] and replenish the earth and so that was
[10:15] the word of god that was a commandment
[10:17] given to him
[10:18] and we know that that spirit man was
[10:20] taken and placed in a body of flesh in
[10:21] genesis chapter 2
[10:23] and that god saw that he was alone and
[10:26] god said it was not good that man should
[10:28] dwell alone
[10:28] so god himself amen performed the first
[10:32] marriage and in order to find a suitable
[10:34] help me he brought up out of the ground
[10:36] all of his creation everything and
[10:38] brought it before adam and adam could
[10:40] not find a suitable help me
[10:42] out of all of that because adam's
[10:44] suitable help meet was within him
[10:47] he could only find something that
[10:48] reflected him that reflected his
[10:50] character
[10:51] it reflected his nature reflected what
[10:52] he was he could only have fellowship
[10:55] amen with a part of himself
[10:58] so god took and laid him down asleep and
[11:01] pulled from him a rib
[11:02] and you know he split the feminine and
[11:04] masculine spirit of adam and he
[11:06] from the rib he made a the woman and he
[11:08] placed that feminine spirit within the
[11:10] woman
[11:10] and then he united the two back together
[11:12] again amen in holy matrimony
[11:15] and he said it is very good and after he
[11:18] finished with this masterpiece then he
[11:20] took his rest
[11:22] praise god but then we know the serpent
[11:26] slipped in to disrupt god's masterpiece
[11:29] and let's look at genesis chapter 2
[11:32] verse 16.
[11:37] chapter 2 verse 16 and the lord god
[11:40] commanded the man saying of every tree
[11:41] of the garden thou mayest freely eat
[11:43] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[11:45] and evil thou shall not eat of it for in
[11:47] the day that you eat us thereof
[11:48] thou shalt surely die so god gave
[11:52] man one commandment that man
[11:55] he was told to multiply and replenish
[11:57] the earth and subdue it and
[11:59] have dominion over it and he was told
[12:00] one thing to avoid and that was this
[12:02] tree of knowledge of good and evil
[12:04] now we look at chapter three and go to
[12:06] verse six and we know this is the
[12:08] temptation of the woman
[12:10] and the serpent came and began to ask
[12:12] questions and began to tempt her with
[12:14] wisdom
[12:15] and ask her and begin to say
[12:19] verse four let's start at verse four and
[12:20] the serpent said unto the woman you
[12:22] shall not
[12:22] surely die for god doesn't know that in
[12:25] the day you eat thereof then your eyes
[12:27] shall be open and you shall be as gods
[12:29] knowing good and evil
[12:30] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[12:32] good for food and that it was so
[12:34] pleasant to the eyes
[12:35] and a tree to be desired to make one
[12:37] wise she took of the fruit thereof and
[12:39] did eat and gave also into her husband
[12:41] with her
[12:42] and he did eat and the eyes of them both
[12:45] were open and they knew that they were
[12:46] naked and they sewed fig leaves together
[12:49] and made themselves aprons so we see
[12:52] we've been talking about this quite a
[12:54] while but they were
[12:55] under a veil of innocency they they did
[12:58] not know
[12:59] they did not see and view one another if
[13:01] naked they could see one another naked
[13:03] but
[13:03] there was no lust there was no
[13:04] temptation amen for the nakedness of the
[13:07] other one because they were under a veil
[13:08] of innocency
[13:11] but when the serpent came to them and
[13:13] began to
[13:14] persuade her amen concerning this tree
[13:17] that they were not
[13:18] supposed to partake of amen he begins to
[13:20] entice her
[13:21] and begins to contradict the word of god
[13:22] and she begins to look at this tree
[13:24] and now her wisdom and intellect and
[13:27] reasoning begins to kick
[13:28] in and instead of just simple faith in
[13:30] the word of god she begins to reason it
[13:32] out because
[13:33] there is this commandment to multiply
[13:35] and replenish and surely
[13:37] i mean surely this is the way god wants
[13:39] to do it and surely
[13:40] the serpent knows what he's talking
[13:41] about and she was deceived thinking
[13:44] that this was a good thing amen she was
[13:46] beguiled
[13:48] and so now she partook then she gave to
[13:52] her husband and he
[13:53] took with her and then their eyes were
[13:54] open and they knew that they were naked
[13:56] and immediately they made themselves a
[13:58] religion
[13:59] a covering of fig leaves something they
[14:01] made themselves to cover their nakedness
[14:05] and when god came in the cool of the
[14:07] evening and he began to speak the voice
[14:09] of god began to penetrate the religion
[14:13] the voice of god began to penetrate all
[14:16] the
[14:17] all that they had made to cover
[14:19] themselves their own atonement their own
[14:20] covering
[14:21] their own shield for their own sin the
[14:23] voice of god began to penetrate that
[14:25] and adam hid himself in the presence of
[14:27] the lord and and god called for him and
[14:30] he said i hid
[14:30] myself because i was naked amen
[14:33] technically he was not naked he had
[14:35] fig leaves covering his uh his covering
[14:37] his sin his neckiness was covered
[14:39] but in the presence of god and the
[14:41] presence of that voice
[14:43] that voice penetrated his fig leaves and
[14:45] he knew that he was still naked before
[14:48] god
[14:49] and i thank god that he sent a voice of
[14:51] a prophet in this day which was the
[14:53] voice of god that penetrated our fig
[14:55] leaves amen
[14:56] penetrated our catholic and baptist and
[14:58] presbyterian fig leaves
[15:00] amen until he had no more comfort and
[15:02] man-made religion and man's system of
[15:04] covering for himself
[15:05] taking the word of god and fashioning in
[15:08] any way that was comfortable to him
[15:09] and then he began to dress himself and
[15:11] dress other people in a product that he
[15:13] had made
[15:17] what were the fig leaves the fig leaves
[15:18] were something that god provided
[15:20] but man had taken and perverted even
[15:22] god's fig leaves
[15:28] man can't get anything right
[15:33] imagine god saying what are you doing
[15:34] with my fig leaves
[15:40] shows you the foolishness of man
[15:43] the very thing that god made man begins
[15:46] to pervert it and corrupt it and
[15:48] and misuse it and he makes his own
[15:50] covering out of it
[15:53] but the voice of god penetrates that
[15:55] covering
[15:56] and i thank god the voice of god
[15:58] penetrates the cover
[16:00] i'm so thankful when i heard that voice
[16:02] amen
[16:03] i found myself naked was it a pleasant
[16:05] experience no it wasn't a pleasant
[16:07] experience
[16:08] that it caused fear and trembling
[16:09] absolutely amen
[16:11] there was times amen that i wished i
[16:13] hadn't heard
[16:16] is that the truth there was times that i
[16:19] wish i hadn't heard because once i heard
[16:21] amen the voice penetrated my fig leaves
[16:23] and i knew that these were no good for a
[16:25] covering
[16:27] and i had to throw away my religious
[16:29] ideas and throw away the traditions of
[16:31] my family
[16:32] throughout the traditions of my parents
[16:34] and how i was brought up
[16:35] and i had to come to that voice and that
[16:38] voice would provide a blood sacrifice
[16:40] and that voice would provide a covering
[16:42] for my nakedness
[16:46] the very presence of god that adam was
[16:49] hiding
[16:49] from was the very father who would
[16:51] provide for him a reconciliation back
[16:55] to a restored fellowship and there's
[16:58] many people who are hiding with fig
[17:00] leaves on amongst the trees
[17:02] out amongst the people in the garden
[17:04] amen they've hid themselves
[17:06] and they won't come to that voice
[17:08] because they fear the voice because the
[17:10] voice will bring judgment to their
[17:11] condition
[17:14] and they want to stay away from the
[17:15] voice of the father but it's the voice
[17:17] of the
[17:18] father that will come and judge you
[17:20] wrong
[17:21] but as soon as he judges you wrong he
[17:23] will provide a sacrifice
[17:25] for an atonement for you and clothe you
[17:27] in the skins of that substitutionary one
[17:30] and he will redeem you
[17:31] he will bring you back to fellowship
[17:33] with himself
[17:36] so we don't want to be afraid of the
[17:37] voice of god
[17:39] in this day in the pergam church age out
[17:44] of the church age book the prophet of
[17:45] god
[17:46] says the first son adam was the spoken
[17:48] seed word of god
[17:50] he was given a bride to reproduce
[17:52] himself
[17:54] is that what the commission was multiply
[17:56] and replenish himself
[17:57] he was given a bride to reproduce
[17:59] himself that is why the bride was given
[18:02] to him
[18:02] to reproduce himself to produce another
[18:05] son of god
[18:06] but she fell she fell by hybridization
[18:09] she caused him to die so god
[18:15] he went through this whole act of
[18:17] separating out of adam his wife
[18:20] and restoring the two back to one and
[18:22] saying the two shall be one flesh
[18:24] and all of that he was given a bride to
[18:26] reproduce himself
[18:28] that's why she was given and so
[18:33] if we just think about this statement
[18:35] the prophet makes
[18:38] he was told to multiply and replenish
[18:40] and then then god in fulfilling his own
[18:42] word
[18:43] amen was going to bring about the
[18:45] necessary
[18:47] fulfillment of that word and the first
[18:49] thing that he would need is he would
[18:50] need himself in the form of a woman
[18:54] adam in the form of a woman adam and
[18:57] adam couldn't do it alone but adam in
[18:59] the form of a woman and now a uniting
[19:02] back together of the male and the female
[19:04] amen was going to be god's provided
[19:06] means amen
[19:07] and now god was god was
[19:11] working his plan but the whole purpose
[19:14] of separating out eve the woman
[19:18] and bringing her back into restored
[19:20] fellowship with adam
[19:21] the whole purpose was for adam to
[19:23] reproduce himself
[19:26] and if they never got to the
[19:29] reproduction
[19:30] amen for another son of god upon the
[19:32] earth she would have failed in her
[19:34] purpose
[19:36] is that right
[19:41] now i forgot to tell you my title
[19:46] i often forget but we're continuing on
[19:49] religion versus relationship part 11
[19:51] but the subtitle is sarah's final
[19:53] declaration
[19:55] sarah's final declaration and we're
[19:57] going to go around the cow shed to get
[19:59] there so just hang on tight
[20:01] but we'll get there by the grace of god
[20:05] in the message wisdom versus faith
[20:07] prophet said eve come and said the lord
[20:09] god said the day we eat thereof that day
[20:11] we die
[20:12] then she stopped to see what he would
[20:14] say he said but listen my dear
[20:17] you lovely little thing see surely god
[20:19] made you for a purpose
[20:22] where is he striking her at
[20:27] god had never given that revelation yet
[20:30] of how and when
[20:31] and why
[20:35] but he says surely god made you for a
[20:37] purpose you know that's right
[20:39] you're a woman you were made for this
[20:40] purpose that's what it is
[20:42] you don't know it now but you were made
[20:44] for this purpose oh
[20:45] you're a lovely little thing dear look
[20:47] at those dainty little hands why sure
[20:50] you will surely but he said if we did we
[20:53] we'd die he said but oh you think that a
[20:56] good loving father god would do a thing
[20:58] like that
[20:59] what'd she do she listened to reason
[21:02] took his wisdom
[21:03] said it's a tree delight one can be
[21:06] desired of it
[21:07] she fell for it that's exactly and when
[21:09] she did what happened
[21:11] like it would to any woman as soon as
[21:13] you fall for it it finishes right there
[21:15] that's right now you see the seed that
[21:17] she was holding
[21:18] and would have finally become a mother
[21:20] by the will of god through a spoken word
[21:22] she would have finally become a mother
[21:24] but she couldn't wait
[21:26] she went into that
[21:29] so there was a there was a prophecy and
[21:32] the prophecy was going to have a
[21:33] fulfillment the commandment to multiply
[21:35] replenish
[21:36] but she wouldn't wait for the spoken
[21:38] word of god amen she was enticed to move
[21:41] ahead of the word of god
[21:42] by wisdom and by reasoning
[21:48] in the resume of the ages out of the
[21:51] church age book the prophet says
[21:53] with these principles in mind we start
[21:55] to trace the church through the various
[21:57] seven ages
[21:58] the birth of the church was at pentecost
[22:00] as the first adam was given a bride
[22:02] fresh from the hand of god and was
[22:04] undefiled for a brief span
[22:06] so was christ the last adam given a
[22:08] bride pure
[22:09] and fresh at pentecost and she remains
[22:12] separated and undefiled for some time
[22:15] and he goes to two scriptures out of the
[22:17] book of acts it says and the rest durst
[22:19] not man join himself to them
[22:21] and the lord added daily such as would
[22:23] be saved
[22:25] goes on to say how long this continued
[22:28] we do not know but one day
[22:29] even as eve was tempted and seduced by
[22:31] satan so the church was contaminated
[22:34] by the entrance of the antichrist spirit
[22:39] first john 4 3 and this is that spirit
[22:41] of antichrist wherever you have heard
[22:43] that it should come and even now
[22:45] already is it in the world and jesus
[22:47] said concerning his bride in the first
[22:49] age i have somewhat against thee because
[22:52] thou has left thy first love remember
[22:54] therefore from whence thou art fallen
[22:56] and repent revelation 2 4.
[23:00] it goes on in the quote to say the
[23:01] church was in that first age
[23:03] already a fallen woman
[23:06] he's showing a repeat of what happened
[23:08] in the garden
[23:09] already a fallen woman as satan had
[23:12] gotten to eat before adam
[23:13] even now had satan seduced the church
[23:15] the bride of christ before
[23:17] the marriage supper of the lamb and what
[23:19] specifically was in her midst that
[23:21] caused that fall
[23:23] what but revelation 2 6 the deeds of the
[23:25] nicolaitans
[23:27] already that first age had turned from
[23:29] following the pure word of god
[23:31] they turned from god's demand of a
[23:32] church absolutely dependent upon him
[23:35] depending entirely upon god to fulfill
[23:37] his word from start
[23:39] to finish apart from human government
[23:44] how did eve fall what was the fault of
[23:47] the woman in the beginning
[23:49] amen she started to think she had
[23:51] something to do in it amen
[23:53] and he began to entice her that through
[23:55] human effort through
[23:57] wisdom through knowledge and through
[23:58] understanding amen that she would
[24:00] produce the promise
[24:01] and she failed to wait amen
[24:05] and this church now under the deeds in
[24:08] the nicolaitans
[24:09] they began to move a church that was
[24:12] completely dependent on god producing
[24:15] his word
[24:17] they turned from god's demand of a
[24:20] church
[24:21] absolutely dependent upon him dependent
[24:24] entirely upon god
[24:26] to fulfill his word from start to finish
[24:28] apart from human government
[24:30] to nicolaitanism which is organizing a
[24:33] human government within the church
[24:35] which is all governments do legislate
[24:38] for the people
[24:39] they did exactly what israel did they
[24:41] took the expediency of human government
[24:44] instead of the word and the spirit
[24:48] what happened what caused her to fall
[24:50] and then she began
[24:52] to think she had something to do with it
[24:54] and through human government through a
[24:56] structure
[24:57] through an organization through a church
[24:59] system and then they become
[25:00] begin to come up with a system by which
[25:02] they could serve god
[25:03] and fulfill god's word instead of
[25:05] remaining completely dependent on the
[25:07] spirit of god to lead the church
[25:10] then men got in and men begin to
[25:12] legislate and control and dictate
[25:14] then they started their schools and
[25:15] their seminaries and their educations
[25:17] and meant
[25:18] through wisdom and intellect and
[25:19] understanding started dictating to the
[25:22] church
[25:22] amen how to serve god and what pleased
[25:25] god what the interpretation of the word
[25:27] was and
[25:27] how you should do this and how you
[25:29] should do that and that that's not what
[25:31] god wanted
[25:32] god wanted a church that was completely
[25:34] dependent
[25:35] upon him to fulfill his word through
[25:38] them from start to finish
[25:44] and if eve would have stayed there if
[25:45] the woman would have stayed there all
[25:47] would have been fine
[25:50] but she began to listen to the wisdom of
[25:53] the serpent
[25:56] and the fourth seal brother bam says
[25:58] what is the
[25:59] organizational system the first number
[26:02] one church organized
[26:04] and we took the understanding of
[26:05] constantine at the nicene council
[26:08] we brought them women last night and
[26:09] showed how that eve the first bride
[26:11] before her husband ever got there she
[26:13] fell by disbelieving god's word in eden
[26:15] the spiritual bride that was born on the
[26:17] day of pentecost of christ before
[26:20] he could get to her what happened she
[26:21] fell at rome
[26:23] forfeited her virtue of the word for
[26:25] dogma
[26:29] amen if if
[26:33] adam was given a wife a bride to
[26:36] reproduce himself
[26:37] then christ through the pentecost was
[26:39] given a bride to reproduce himself
[26:43] it's the same thing continuing on so if
[26:46] there's a failure where's the failure
[26:48] the failure is staying virtuous the
[26:50] failure is staying
[26:52] pure and clean and virtuous and
[26:54] separated for him to come and fulfill
[26:56] his own word
[26:57] his way in his time from start to finish
[27:02] and when eve began to take on the wisdom
[27:05] and understanding of the serpent
[27:07] and began to by her own lust looking and
[27:10] by her own discernment
[27:11] amen no longer to the discernment of the
[27:13] word but by her own mind
[27:14] began to analyze the tree and could not
[27:17] find fault with the tree for it was good
[27:19] pleasant to the eyes
[27:20] good for food one to be desired to make
[27:23] one wisdom
[27:24] make one wise she was using her own
[27:26] understanding
[27:27] and by her own understanding she was
[27:30] listening to the serpent
[27:31] and then she began to think that this
[27:33] would be correct i've got something to
[27:35] do into this
[27:38] and it caused the fall then the first
[27:42] church came out under the baptism of the
[27:43] holy ghost
[27:44] amen by the spirit of god moving and
[27:46] leading the churches and the church
[27:48] and they begin to do the same thing they
[27:50] begin to listen to the enticement of the
[27:52] devil
[27:52] and begin to bring in wisdom and
[27:54] understanding in their own
[27:56] intellect and it began to tie down the
[27:58] church and move them
[28:00] into ways that was contrary to god's
[28:02] design
[28:05] now let's go to genesis 15.
[28:08] i want to pick up here and talk about
[28:10] sarah
[28:13] but i want to lay that as a foundation
[28:14] so we understand
[28:16] what we're looking at genesis
[28:20] chapter 15 we're going to begin reading
[28:22] at verse 1.
[28:30] after these things the word of the lord
[28:31] came unto abram in a vision saying fear
[28:33] not abram
[28:35] i am thy shield and i exceeding great
[28:37] reward
[28:38] and abram said lord god what will thou
[28:41] give me seeing i go childless
[28:43] and the steward of my house is this
[28:44] eliezer of damascus
[28:46] and abram said behold to me thou has
[28:49] given no seed and lo one born in my
[28:51] house was mine heir
[28:52] and behold the word of the lord came
[28:54] unto him saying thus shall not
[28:57] this shall not be thine heir but he that
[28:59] shall come forth out of thine own
[29:01] bowels shall be thine heir and he
[29:04] brought him forth
[29:05] abroad and and said look now toward the
[29:08] heaven and toward the stars if thou be
[29:10] able to number them and he said unto him
[29:12] so shall thy seed be and he believed in
[29:16] the lord
[29:17] and he counted it to him for
[29:18] righteousness
[29:21] what did abraham do to be righteous
[29:23] believe the lord
[29:26] he believed what the lord told him in
[29:28] that day and that hour the promise for
[29:29] that hour
[29:30] he told him and he believed and it was
[29:32] counted unto him for righteousness
[29:33] then he told him what was going to
[29:35] happen he says
[29:36] but one of your loins out of you your
[29:39] own seed
[29:40] i shall raise up a son this servant
[29:42] won't be your seed your heir
[29:44] but one out of your own vows and so that
[29:48] was the promise of god
[29:49] now listen there was that there
[29:52] this was what god had promised to do
[29:55] this is what god had said he would do
[29:57] and if abraham and sarah can just hold
[29:59] still
[30:00] god will perform his own word but the
[30:03] problem is that they're going to move
[30:05] the same way
[30:06] this story has always been told down
[30:08] through the bible
[30:09] what happened to the woman and what what
[30:12] happened to the first church now begins
[30:14] to work in sarah
[30:17] and in genesis chapter 16
[30:21] verse one after the promise is already
[30:23] given to abraham
[30:24] that he shall have a son of his own
[30:26] bowels
[30:28] it says now sarai abram's wife bare him
[30:30] no children
[30:31] and she had a handmaid an egyptian whose
[30:33] name was hagar
[30:35] and sarah i said unto abram behold now
[30:38] the lord hath restrained me from bearing
[30:40] i pray thee go in unto my maid
[30:42] it may be that i may obtain children by
[30:44] her and abram hearkened to the voice of
[30:47] sarah
[30:47] of the voice of sarai and sarah abram's
[30:50] wife
[30:51] took hagar her maid the egyptian after
[30:54] abram had dwelt ten years in the land of
[30:56] canaan
[30:57] and gave her to her husband abram to be
[30:59] his wife
[31:00] and he went in unto hagar and she
[31:03] conceived and when she saw that she had
[31:05] conceived
[31:06] her mistress was despised in her eyes
[31:11] you see sarah is
[31:15] now doing the same thing that the woman
[31:17] did at the beginning what eve had done
[31:20] there's a promise given the promise is
[31:23] sure god will do it god will keep his
[31:25] word and whatever god said
[31:27] be sure that god will keep his word but
[31:29] now sarah
[31:30] she becomes the tool in the devil's hand
[31:33] just like
[31:33] the serpent was the tool in the devil's
[31:35] hand then the woman became the tool in
[31:37] the devil's hand
[31:38] now sarah is a tool in the devil's hand
[31:40] to try to disrupt this plan
[31:44] and she begins to use wisdom and
[31:46] intellect and reasoning
[31:48] and she begins to look at her own
[31:50] condition
[31:52] and and she blames god
[31:56] is that what she did verse 2 sarah said
[32:00] unto abram
[32:01] behold now the lord hath restrained me
[32:04] from bearing
[32:06] obviously obviously this is not god's
[32:09] plan
[32:11] because god has stopped me
[32:14] from bearing now
[32:18] take my handmaid this is her own wisdom
[32:22] this is her own understanding she's
[32:24] trying to get to the promise
[32:26] but she's trying to come according to
[32:28] her own design her own wisdom her own
[32:30] intellect
[32:32] and she's looking at her condition and
[32:35] the inability of herself to
[32:37] bring forth a child and she's beginning
[32:39] to doubt because of what her eyes see
[32:44] she begins to doubt because of what her
[32:45] eyes see she begins to doubt because of
[32:47] what she feels
[32:48] amen and and so now because she believes
[32:51] the word
[32:52] it's not that she doubts the word she
[32:54] believes the word
[32:56] but now she begins to say obviously
[32:59] obviously how obvious is it that the
[33:02] lord
[33:03] won't do it this way who says god won't
[33:05] do it this way
[33:06] just because he hasn't done it that way
[33:08] doesn't mean he won't do it that way
[33:10] just because you haven't conceived yet
[33:11] you had lived with your husband since
[33:13] you were a young girl
[33:14] they lived together as husband and wife
[33:16] for all of these years
[33:17] and there was never a conception that
[33:19] has nothing to do with the word of god
[33:21] amen
[33:22] that has nothing there's no limiting
[33:24] factor in god
[33:25] the physical condition the situations
[33:27] the time it means
[33:28] nothing to the word of god because the
[33:30] word of god is eternal and it's powerful
[33:32] it breaks every bond it heals it
[33:34] delivers the word of god
[33:36] will find its own way to bring itself to
[33:39] pass
[33:42] because the word has its own life
[33:47] i want to go on in genesis but i want to
[33:49] break right here hold your place in
[33:50] genesis
[33:51] and go over to read hebrews 11 with me
[33:55] we'll read one passage in hebrews 11 and
[33:58] jump right back
[33:59] to genesis
[34:13] hebrews 11 and verse 8 by faith
[34:17] abraham when he was called to go out to
[34:19] a place which he should after receive
[34:21] for an inheritance
[34:22] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[34:25] whether he went
[34:27] see abraham had the kind of faith
[34:30] he didn't have to know everything before
[34:32] he obeyed
[34:35] you know brother branham calls this age
[34:37] the abrahamic age
[34:40] and the abrahamic age well because
[34:43] what's he doing he's calling the royal
[34:44] seed of abraham
[34:46] who have the same nature the same faith
[34:48] amen the same characteristics of abraham
[34:50] is going to be expressed in the seed
[34:52] of abraham in this end time this bright
[34:54] age is an
[34:55] abrahamic age and in the abrahamic age
[34:58] god could call abram and he would go out
[35:00] not knowing where he went
[35:04] because that's the faith that he's
[35:06] looking for the faith of abraham
[35:08] that will move out at the command of god
[35:09] without knowing what the destination is
[35:12] or how long the journey will be
[35:13] when we'll arrive and what it will look
[35:15] like where there will be food will there
[35:16] be a city will i have a house
[35:18] they didn't know any of those things all
[35:19] they know was god called him out and he
[35:21] eventually obeyed and he went
[35:23] out by the word of god not knowing what
[35:25] they would look like he had never been
[35:27] there before he didn't have any contacts
[35:29] there
[35:31] he didn't have any arrangements when he
[35:32] got there i could stay with aunt so and
[35:34] so and uncle this well
[35:36] he had nothing but the word of god to
[35:38] tell him to go
[35:40] and in this abrahamic age he will have a
[35:42] seat of abraham
[35:44] that will operate by the faith of
[35:46] abraham
[35:48] they'll have somebody who will believe
[35:49] his word even when you can't see in your
[35:51] own self how it's possible
[35:53] even when your eyes and your ears and
[35:54] your intellect and your reasoning
[35:56] and all the history that you've had upon
[35:58] this earth tell you that it's not
[35:59] possible
[36:00] there'll be something on the inside of
[36:02] the abraham see abraham's faith seed in
[36:04] the abrahamic age that'll say
[36:06] it doesn't matter what i see it doesn't
[36:08] matter what i hear
[36:09] it doesn't matter what i understand all
[36:11] that matters is he
[36:13] said
[36:17] so abraham verse 8
[36:21] by faith not by reasoning
[36:24] not by intellect not by wisdom
[36:27] not by experience
[36:31] by faith abraham when he was called to
[36:34] go out into a place which he should have
[36:36] to receive for an inheritance
[36:38] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[36:40] whether he went
[36:42] by faith he so adjourned in the land of
[36:44] promises in a strange country dwelling
[36:46] in the tabernacle
[36:47] and going in tabernacles with isaac and
[36:49] jacob the heirs with him of the same
[36:51] promise
[36:52] for he looked for a city which has
[36:55] foundations
[36:56] whose builder and maker is god
[37:00] you know abraham never stopped his
[37:03] journey
[37:04] because he was looking for the city of
[37:06] god
[37:07] he didn't settle down he didn't build a
[37:09] kingdom and he didn't build a walled
[37:10] city
[37:11] abraham never stopped because his
[37:13] pursuit was not for gay
[37:15] selfish gain his pursuit was not for
[37:17] himself but he was pursuing god and he
[37:19] was looking for that city
[37:24] a city that has foundations
[37:28] whose builder and maker is gone
[37:31] now verse 11 is what i want to
[37:32] concentrate on
[37:34] through faith also sarah herself
[37:38] received strength to conceive seed
[37:40] and was delivered of a child when she
[37:42] was past age
[37:44] because she judged him faithful who had
[37:48] promised
[37:50] therefore sprang there even of one and
[37:52] him as good as dead
[37:53] so many as the stars of the sky and
[37:55] multitude
[37:56] and as the sand which is by the seashore
[37:59] innumerable
[38:01] if adam was given a bride to reproduce
[38:05] himself
[38:06] and christ at pentecost was given a
[38:07] bride to reproduce himself
[38:09] why was abraham given a bride
[38:13] to reproduce himself
[38:16] and until sarah
[38:20] oh just listen to me
[38:23] until sarah could believe
[38:29] until sarah through faith receive
[38:32] strength to conceive see
[38:33] until sarah's faith got to this place
[38:35] until sarah
[38:37] through faith could get strength to
[38:38] conceive seed that purpose was not
[38:41] realized
[38:43] the purpose was for abraham the promise
[38:45] was to abraham
[38:47] that abraham was going to bring forth a
[38:49] seed that there was going to be a
[38:50] promised deed through abraham
[38:52] but abraham needed sarah sarah was part
[38:55] of abraham
[38:58] and sarah could or abraham could have
[39:00] faith amen
[39:01] but until sarah had faith to receive
[39:04] strength to conceive seed
[39:06] nothing was moving forward in the
[39:07] program of god because everything moves
[39:09] in the program of god by faith
[39:13] and abraham had faith but sarah was part
[39:15] of abraham so the other part of abraham
[39:18] had to have the faith of abraham also
[39:22] abraham had enough faith to go out and
[39:24] so joined in a strange land not knowing
[39:25] where he went
[39:26] sarah just went along with abraham but
[39:29] there was going to come a time
[39:31] that it was going to require that sarah
[39:33] herself
[39:34] had faith amen that sarah herself had
[39:37] faith
[39:37] because when sarah herself could have
[39:39] faith then would bring the word of god
[39:41] to pass
[39:46] praise god adam believed
[39:51] his wife believed but she believed and
[39:54] reasoned
[39:58] because she was going to have to have
[40:00] faith to produce this promise
[40:05] christ was given a bride but before she
[40:09] could come to that place
[40:12] to conceive she was already a fallen
[40:15] woman
[40:17] there was no fault in christ
[40:21] there was no lack of faith in him but it
[40:24] was going to take something in her
[40:26] also because she was part of him and
[40:28] together they were wide
[40:30] and together it would produce the
[40:31] promise
[40:34] so sarah herself was going to have to
[40:38] have faith
[40:40] let's read that again through faith also
[40:44] sarah herself received strength
[40:47] to conceive seed and was delivered of a
[40:50] child when she was past
[40:51] age because she judged him faithful who
[40:54] had promised
[40:57] something happened
[41:00] between her offering hagar
[41:04] and this scripture being fulfilled
[41:08] is that true because it says here
[41:12] that she was past age but she
[41:16] judged him faithful who had promised
[41:19] but we just read in chapter 16 that she
[41:21] said
[41:22] the lord has restrained from me bearing
[41:25] forth seed
[41:26] now take hagar my servant
[41:30] she she wasn't judging him faithful who
[41:33] promised
[41:33] she was saying he who promised is not
[41:35] letting me have it so now maybe there's
[41:37] another plan and i think i can take this
[41:39] handmaid and give it to you
[41:40] something was going to happen to change
[41:42] sarah's faith
[41:43] to bring her faith to a higher level
[41:46] because she was not
[41:47] operating by the right faith in genesis
[41:49] chapter 16.
[41:52] there was going to require something she
[41:54] was going to have to see something
[41:55] experienced i mean something
[41:56] was going to have to get sarah into a
[41:58] better position
[41:59] because she was going to have to judge
[42:01] him faithful who made the promise
[42:04] but so far she was saying he was the
[42:06] reason it wasn't happening to her
[42:11] and so obviously it's not this isn't how
[42:14] he's going to do it
[42:15] so we're going to have we can't just sit
[42:17] here abraham and die
[42:18] we've got to do something
[42:22] what can we do well you know it's legal
[42:24] for you to take my hand mate and
[42:26] apparently that's how god may
[42:27] be that that's how god's going to
[42:29] fulfill his word
[42:32] by reasoning by intellect that's the
[42:36] downfall of religion all over the world
[42:39] that's the downfall of christianity
[42:40] everywhere we've got something to do in
[42:42] this we've got to figure something out
[42:44] and then god's not going to do it all he
[42:46] left something for us to do
[42:47] that's true he left something for you to
[42:49] do and that's to believe his word
[42:51] that's what he left for you to do
[42:53] believe his word and surrender yourself
[42:55] to his word and let him do what he
[42:57] promised to do
[42:58] because the only way it's going to be
[42:59] right is if he does it
[43:01] if you do it it won't be right if you do
[43:04] it it's going to become perverted
[43:06] corrupted somewhere along the line
[43:08] it's going to fall apart because
[43:09] everything man does and everything man
[43:11] touches
[43:12] falls into ruin but you've got a part
[43:15] you absolutely have a part that part is
[43:17] to believe what he said
[43:19] and surrender yourself to it wholly
[43:21] completely
[43:22] with no thought of your own with no
[43:24] reasoning with no holding back
[43:26] just believe the word and give yourself
[43:27] to the world
[43:30] and until you have the right kind of
[43:32] faith
[43:33] the promises is on hold amen
[43:39] is that right and sarah until
[43:42] sarah had the right kind of faith the
[43:44] promises on hold
[43:45] yes
[43:51] so sarah herself
[43:55] i love that word herself
[43:59] amen just bring it home
[44:03] today friends just bring it home
[44:08] sarah herself received strength to
[44:11] conceive seed
[44:12] and was delivered how did how did sarah
[44:15] herself receive strength
[44:16] to receive seed through faith
[44:20] something moved her faith from where it
[44:22] was in genesis 16 to where it was here
[44:25] in hebrews chapter 11.
[44:28] through faith also sarah herself
[44:29] received strength to conceive seed and
[44:31] was delivered of a child when she was
[44:33] past
[44:33] age because she judged him faithful who
[44:36] had promised
[44:36] therefore sprang there even of one
[44:40] and him as good as dead so many as the
[44:42] stars of the sky and multitude as the
[44:44] sands of the sea
[44:45] for sure innumerable what was verse 12
[44:48] verse 12
[44:49] is the fulfillment of the promised word
[44:51] that god gave to abraham
[44:53] look at the stars so shall thou seed be
[44:55] verse 12 saying
[44:56] the now comes therefore therefore
[44:59] therefore
[45:00] what does therefore mean because because
[45:03] of what
[45:04] because she had faith and because
[45:06] through faith she was given strength to
[45:07] conceive seed
[45:08] because she judged him faithful who had
[45:10] made the promise to keep the brothers
[45:12] because of that now is the fulfillment
[45:14] of the promise
[45:17] between god making the promise and the
[45:20] fulfillment of the promise
[45:21] stood sarah amen
[45:26] and sarah through faith
[45:29] would receive strength to bring forth
[45:33] the promise
[45:36] praise be to god let's go back to
[45:39] genesis
[45:45] so god said i will raise you up a seed
[45:48] your seed shall be as the stars
[45:50] innumerable then god further clarified
[45:54] later he said out of sarah
[45:56] from sarah shall the seed be born
[46:01] so god god was promised this word from
[46:05] abraham
[46:06] he was given a bride to produce the word
[46:10] to produce the promised son and that
[46:12] promised son would bring the fulfillment
[46:13] of the word
[46:14] but it was going to be done by faith
[46:17] when sarah
[46:18] herself received strength
[46:23] it didn't matter how strong abraham was
[46:27] because when abraham was strong in the
[46:29] faith there was no conception
[46:31] but when when sarah through faith
[46:33] received strength to conceive
[46:34] now there was a conception amen
[46:40] let's go to genesis chapter 18.
[46:48] in verse 17 god comes to abraham to
[46:52] confirm the promise and
[46:53] there's a covenant made by the dividing
[46:55] of the animals and the
[46:56] pillar of fire passes through and he
[46:59] speaks and in verse 17
[47:00] god says that you're going to change
[47:02] sarai's name to sarah
[47:04] because she's going to get a name change
[47:06] amen because there's an identification
[47:09] there she's a princess
[47:10] amen and she's going to bring forth this
[47:12] promised seed
[47:14] and god confirmed the promise and then
[47:16] in verse 18
[47:18] it says and the lord appeared unto him
[47:20] in the plains of memory
[47:23] something is going to happen between
[47:25] verse 16
[47:26] and the fulfillment of the promise
[47:28] something that is going to give
[47:30] sarah faith
[47:33] amen because in verse 16 she didn't have
[47:37] faith that she was going to conceive is
[47:39] that true
[47:40] and she didn't have strength to conceive
[47:43] in verse 16. she didn't have strength to
[47:45] conceive she didn't have faith to
[47:46] conceive
[47:47] she offered up her handmaid but she's
[47:49] going to get to the place that hebrews
[47:51] 11 declared that she through faith was
[47:54] going to receive strength
[47:56] and the lord appeared unto him in the
[47:58] plains of memory and he sat in the tent
[48:00] door
[48:00] in the heat of the day and he lifted up
[48:02] his eyes and he looked and loathed three
[48:04] men stood by him and when he saw them he
[48:07] ran to meet them in the tent door
[48:08] and bowed himself toward the ground and
[48:11] he said my lord
[48:13] if now i have found favor in thy sight
[48:15] pass not away i pray thee from thy
[48:17] servant
[48:18] let a little water i pray be fetched and
[48:20] wash your feet
[48:22] wash your feet and rest yourselves under
[48:24] the tree
[48:25] and i will fetch a morsel of bread and
[48:27] comfort your hearts and
[48:28] after that you shall pass on for
[48:30] therefore are you come to your servant
[48:33] and they said so do as thou has said and
[48:36] abraham hastened
[48:37] to the tent and to sarah and said make
[48:39] ready quickly three measures of fine
[48:41] meal knead it and bake cakes upon the
[48:43] earth
[48:44] and abraham ran into the herd and
[48:47] fetched a calf
[48:48] tender and good and gave it unto a young
[48:50] man and he hasted to dress him
[48:52] and he took butter and milk and and the
[48:55] calf which he had dressed and set it
[48:56] before them
[48:57] and he stood by them under the tree and
[48:59] they did eat
[49:01] and they said unto him where is sarah
[49:03] thy wife and he said behold
[49:05] in the tent
[49:08] praise god
[49:11] abraham in his is going to receive a
[49:15] visitation from
[49:16] elohim in flesh
[49:19] in this visitation of elohim and flesh
[49:22] it is
[49:23] god coming in a tabernacle of flesh and
[49:25] in that tabernacle of flesh
[49:27] he had dust on his feet that could be
[49:29] washed off by abraham
[49:30] he would eat the meat of a calf he would
[49:32] drink milk taste the butter
[49:34] amen he was in flesh but it was elohim
[49:37] and elohim was going to perform a sign
[49:41] it was going to be the sign of the
[49:42] messiah and he was going to show this
[49:44] sign
[49:45] because this sign is the one that we are
[49:47] going to recognize in this day
[49:51] he said where is sarah thy wife and he
[49:53] said behold in the tent
[49:55] and he said i will certainly return unto
[49:57] thee
[49:59] according to the time of life and lo
[50:02] sarah thy wife shall have a son
[50:05] and sarah heard it in the tent which was
[50:07] behind him
[50:09] where was the tent behind him
[50:14] now abraham and sarah were old and well
[50:17] stricken in age and it ceased to be with
[50:19] sarah
[50:19] after the manner of women she could not
[50:22] possibly
[50:23] conceive in her natural condition
[50:26] therefore sarah laughed within herself
[50:28] saying after i am waxed old shall i have
[50:31] pleasure
[50:32] my lord being old also and the lord said
[50:35] unto abraham wherefore
[50:37] did sarah laugh he's discerning her
[50:41] thoughts
[50:42] in the tent behind him this is the sign
[50:45] of the messiah
[50:46] because when jesus christ came he could
[50:48] do the same thing when the pharisees
[50:50] would come to him he could discern their
[50:52] thoughts
[50:52] and begin to answer their questions
[50:54] because he knew what was in their heart
[50:57] and now elohim in flesh he comes on the
[50:59] scene
[51:00] amen and now shares in the tent behind
[51:02] him and he's coming to confirm the
[51:03] promise
[51:04] but in confirming the promise he has to
[51:07] build faith
[51:09] and in building faith he's got to tell
[51:11] sarah
[51:12] it's not hagar it's not anybody else but
[51:15] it's going to be sarah your wife
[51:17] i'm going to confirm the promise through
[51:19] sarah your wife
[51:20] and sarah once again looks at her
[51:23] condition
[51:25] once again she looks at herself
[51:29] oh if we ever fail god it's by looking
[51:31] at ourselves friends
[51:33] if you ever look at yourself too much
[51:34] you're going to fail god you're going to
[51:36] fail to believe his promise in this hour
[51:38] because you're going to look at a body
[51:39] of flesh that was born through
[51:41] hybridization
[51:42] you're going to look at what comes
[51:43] through the union of your mother and
[51:44] father
[51:45] and what's written on your birth
[51:46] certificate but if you can look past
[51:48] that to what was in the mind of god
[51:50] before the foundation of the world if
[51:52] you could look to this attribute and the
[51:53] seed and the soul
[51:54] and not look to the flesh and have faith
[51:57] in what god said
[51:58] god is able to perform everything that
[52:00] he has said would be performed by the
[52:02] bride in this day
[52:04] there's nothing to hinder him there's
[52:06] nothing to stop him the only thing that
[52:08] stops him is a lack of faith
[52:13] because when jesus christ was on earth
[52:15] he would go into a city
[52:16] amen and he would heal all the sick that
[52:19] they brought to him
[52:20] in that city he would go to another
[52:24] travel to another city
[52:25] and there he could not do many mighty
[52:27] works because of their
[52:30] unbelief you say jesus christ
[52:34] he was limited jesus christ chose to
[52:36] move his program forward by faith
[52:40] that's god's chosen method that's god's
[52:42] chosen way
[52:43] amen so when sarah was struggling with
[52:45] faith he was going to show up in a body
[52:47] of flesh
[52:48] amen so that he can confirm the promise
[52:50] no it's not hagar no it's not anybody
[52:52] else but it's sarah
[52:53] and sarah when god was here in flesh
[52:56] sarah began to look at her old age
[53:04] shall i being old have pleasure with my
[53:08] lord and him
[53:08] also we're going to go back to living
[53:10] like young men and women
[53:14] and she laughed within herself
[53:21] the whole purpose of elohim being here
[53:23] was to get sarah to believe
[53:30] the whole purpose of elohim coming down
[53:33] in a body of flesh
[53:34] to perform the sign of the messiah was
[53:36] to get sarah to believe that she's the
[53:38] one
[53:39] and this word is true and the time is
[53:41] now
[53:43] and god has sent a prophet in our day
[53:45] and it was none other than
[53:46] god himself operating through that
[53:48] tabernacle of flesh
[53:49] with feet that could be washed and could
[53:51] eat amen it could converse with you and
[53:53] could walk down the road
[53:54] amen it was god tabernacled in a body of
[53:57] flesh
[53:57] and that flesh was his prophet william
[53:59] branham and he would turn his back to
[54:01] the crowd
[54:02] and begin to discern the thoughts of the
[54:03] people here and over here and in the
[54:05] balcony
[54:06] showing the sign of the messiah not to
[54:08] show off a sign
[54:09] not to show off the gift but to get to
[54:11] sarah to believe that it's you
[54:13] you're the one the promise is for you
[54:16] and the time is now
[54:18] why did you hear and see that sign why
[54:21] are you
[54:22] the one who got the tape and there's
[54:23] millions out there that didn't get the
[54:24] tape
[54:26] why are you the one who got to see
[54:27] prophet visit south africa read prophet
[54:29] vs south africa
[54:30] why are you the one that got to see 20th
[54:32] century prophet and deep call it to the
[54:34] deed
[54:35] millions have seen it millions haven't
[54:37] seen it millions have seen and rejected
[54:40] it but something in you said
[54:41] that's the truth that's god a man can't
[54:44] do that that's god
[54:46] and it wasn't done so you can say that's
[54:48] god and i've seen god in flesh and god
[54:50] come in flesh but god come in flesh for
[54:52] a purpose
[54:53] and that purpose was to bring sarah's
[54:55] faith up a little bit higher
[54:58] because sarah was doubting because of
[55:01] her condition
[55:05] praise god i hope we can stop doubting
[55:08] because of our condition
[55:09] it has nothing to do with our condition
[55:11] god has already sent a word to change
[55:13] our condition
[55:14] he had already brought us from death
[55:16] unto life abraham's seed was dead
[55:18] sarah's wound was dead but in the
[55:20] visitation of elohim
[55:22] he was going to bring a resurrection
[55:24] from the dead and this
[55:26] is a resurrection ministry this is a
[55:28] resurrection hour
[55:30] it's the raising up of the word it's the
[55:32] raising up of the bride
[55:35] everything was dead when elohim came to
[55:37] them
[55:41] the word had been laying dead for years
[55:44] the seed word that was in abraham has
[55:46] been laying dead for years
[55:49] the bride was stuck in formalism and
[55:52] reasoning stuck in an
[55:53] old thinking in an old condition that i
[55:56] being old can't
[55:58] bring forth life
[56:02] everything was dead
[56:05] when elohim and flesh came on the scene
[56:10] and the purpose of elohim coming in
[56:12] flesh was to quicken them to life
[56:14] to bring them back to the condition
[56:17] where the seed can be given and the seed
[56:18] can be received
[56:23] praise god there's so many
[56:27] that can see that god sent a mighty
[56:29] prophet there was a mighty work that was
[56:31] done and there was amazing discernment
[56:32] amazing healing
[56:33] amazingness amazing that it's like
[56:35] people know that there was an elohim
[56:37] there was a
[56:38] jehovah god who showed up on the plains
[56:40] of memory to talk
[56:41] to abraham and discern the thoughts of
[56:43] sarah and the tent behind him
[56:44] but they missed the purpose of that
[56:46] discernment
[56:47] [Music]
[56:51] you and i are the purpose of that
[56:53] discernment friends
[56:58] praise god
[57:02] verse 11. now abraham and sarah were old
[57:04] and well stricken in age
[57:06] and it ceased to be with sarah after the
[57:08] manner of women therefore sarah laughed
[57:10] within herself saying after i am waxed
[57:12] old
[57:13] shall i have pleasure my lord being old
[57:15] also
[57:17] and the lord said unto abraham wherefore
[57:20] did sarah
[57:21] laugh saying shall i of surety bear a
[57:25] child which i'm old
[57:27] is anything too hard for the lord and at
[57:30] the same
[57:31] point at the same time appointed i will
[57:33] return
[57:34] at the time appointed i will return unto
[57:36] thee according to the time of life
[57:38] and sarah shall have a son then sarah
[57:42] denied saying i laughed not
[57:46] who is she talking to god
[57:51] in flesh sarah denied saying i laughed
[57:54] not for she was afraid
[57:56] and he said nay but thou
[58:00] did laugh
[58:03] now the discernment was performed on her
[58:08] now the thoughts of her heart were being
[58:11] declared openly
[58:14] and although she denied it
[58:17] there was a man there there was god
[58:21] in a body of flesh and a man there that
[58:23] could go beyond her words
[58:26] and know what was in her heart
[58:28] [Music]
[58:29] and i'm telling you there's a man here
[58:31] today that can go beyond whatever you
[58:33] say
[58:34] whatever your false confession whatever
[58:36] you're denying there's still
[58:37] elohim here and he can come now and he
[58:40] can begin to discern what's in your
[58:42] thoughts amen
[58:43] he can begin to break down what you're
[58:45] thinking amen and he's not
[58:47] doing he wasn't doing it to punish sarah
[58:49] he wasn't doing it to cast her away
[58:51] he was giving her the discernment so she
[58:53] would know that he was god amen because
[58:55] no man could know what i was thinking
[59:01] no man would know what i was thinking
[59:03] that has to be god
[59:04] and what did it do to her it gave her
[59:06] faith for a body change
[59:13] praise be to god
[59:16] brother banham says in the spoken word
[59:18] is the original seed he said
[59:20] and the angel showed abraham who he was
[59:22] that he was the word he said why did
[59:24] sarah laugh
[59:25] so he he called her forth and said i
[59:28] never
[59:29] but he said you did what that's gracie
[59:33] right there
[59:34] god would have slew her right there but
[59:36] he couldn't
[59:37] [Music]
[59:42] hey amen i don't care what you're
[59:44] thinking i don't care what you thought
[59:46] i don't care what you said what you've
[59:47] denied amen there's one thing that holds
[59:50] you in the plan of god
[59:52] and that's predestination has everything
[59:54] to do with where you came from and who
[59:55] you're part of
[1:00:00] he couldn't all see our stupidity
[1:00:03] he'd kill every one of us but he can't
[1:00:06] to kill sarah he'd had to take abraham
[1:00:09] because sarah was part of abraham
[1:00:11] they were one in union and to take the
[1:00:14] church and destroy it
[1:00:15] he can't do it because it's part of
[1:00:17] himself
[1:00:19] christ part of himself the word being
[1:00:20] made flesh amazing grace how sweet the
[1:00:23] sound
[1:00:24] couldn't do it you get it he couldn't
[1:00:26] kill her
[1:00:27] he couldn't take her life because she
[1:00:28] was part of abraham
[1:00:30] she was flesh of his flesh and bone of
[1:00:32] his bones
[1:00:35] and our mistakes don't say well i made a
[1:00:38] failure no
[1:00:38] don't make them abraham made failures
[1:00:40] too see
[1:00:42] but he couldn't take the church he can't
[1:00:44] kill the elected
[1:00:45] he can't take your life because you're
[1:00:47] part of himself you're the word the word
[1:00:49] is in you it's
[1:00:50] manifest itself proving itself love joy
[1:00:53] peace long suffering
[1:00:55] all the words of god you believe every
[1:00:57] one of them
[1:00:58] you believe every one of them work and
[1:01:00] god working through you
[1:01:01] you're a part of the word which is
[1:01:03] christ and we are taught that he is the
[1:01:05] word and we are flesh of his flesh
[1:01:07] and bone of his bone there you are
[1:01:12] you're part of christ an attribute of
[1:01:14] god a son or daughter of god come from
[1:01:17] god the only way you can be a son or
[1:01:18] daughter of god is if you originated in
[1:01:20] god
[1:01:21] if you've come from god you're a part of
[1:01:23] christ amen
[1:01:27] and we've thought all kinds of things
[1:01:29] amen
[1:01:30] and probably said all kinds of things we
[1:01:32] shouldn't say but he couldn't destroy us
[1:01:35] because there's a promise
[1:01:38] there's a promise and that promise has
[1:01:41] to be fulfilled
[1:01:42] and god made that promise to abraham it
[1:01:44] automatically included abraham's wife
[1:01:48] because those two are one and when god
[1:01:50] made a promise
[1:01:51] to him he made a promise that promise
[1:01:54] included sarah
[1:01:55] and he was going to use sarah to fulfill
[1:01:58] the promise
[1:01:58] and without sarah the promise was on
[1:02:01] haunt
[1:02:02] [Music]
[1:02:04] do you understand the church ages
[1:02:10] she'd gotten older and older
[1:02:13] and older and older
[1:02:20] until it looked impossible
[1:02:23] and that's when elohim come in flesh
[1:02:25] [Music]
[1:02:28] to bring the sign of the messiah
[1:02:31] to increase her faith
[1:02:34] to believe
[1:02:37] in the message the token he says it has
[1:02:39] to be because a woman
[1:02:41] and her husband become one they become
[1:02:43] one and so does the bride in christ
[1:02:45] become one
[1:02:47] the ministry of the bride and the
[1:02:49] ministry of christ
[1:02:51] is the same
[1:02:54] how can he do it without his bride the
[1:02:57] ministry of the bride and the ministry
[1:02:59] of christ is the same
[1:03:00] listen the ministry of abraham and the
[1:03:02] mystery of sarah became the same
[1:03:06] so abraham was to bring forth a royal
[1:03:08] seed abraham was going to
[1:03:09] and then the natural was going to type
[1:03:11] that and bringing forth the promised
[1:03:12] seed of isaac
[1:03:13] that was his commission that was his
[1:03:15] promise that was the work god was going
[1:03:16] to do for him that was his ministry
[1:03:18] amen but his ministry became her
[1:03:20] ministry
[1:03:22] because they were one they had the same
[1:03:24] ministry
[1:03:25] [Music]
[1:03:28] and that ministry was to bring forth the
[1:03:29] promisee
[1:03:33] so god had to get her in the right
[1:03:36] condition
[1:03:37] let's turn to malachi 4. but we're
[1:03:40] coming back to genesis
[1:03:41] so don't lose your place there
[1:03:50] malachi chapter 4.
[1:04:02] malachi chapter 4 verse 5.
[1:04:08] behold i will send you elijah the
[1:04:10] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:04:11] and dreadful day of the lord
[1:04:13] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:04:15] fathers to the children
[1:04:16] and the heart of the children to their
[1:04:18] fathers lest i come and smite the earth
[1:04:20] with a curse
[1:04:23] god has left the second half of this
[1:04:25] prophecy
[1:04:27] to turn the children the hearts of the
[1:04:29] children to their fathers
[1:04:30] he has saved it for our day and he has
[1:04:33] sent the spirit of elijah and the
[1:04:35] prophet of brother branham
[1:04:37] and he's come to turn our hearts back
[1:04:41] to what we were in the beginning
[1:04:45] prophet of god says 1963
[1:04:48] malachi the fourth chapter promises us
[1:04:50] that the last days that
[1:04:52] there would come forth the message that
[1:04:53] would turn the hearts of the children
[1:04:55] back to the faith of the fathers the
[1:04:56] original
[1:04:57] faith of the fathers they promised it
[1:05:00] jesus promised it
[1:05:01] faith of the end time believers we see
[1:05:03] the original messiah
[1:05:05] sign notice if he's raised from the dead
[1:05:07] and the creeds has put him out
[1:05:09] all these years and denied that that
[1:05:11] truth then the thing that we've got to
[1:05:13] look for in the last days
[1:05:15] is a turning back to the original faith
[1:05:18] back to the faith of the early
[1:05:20] pentecostal fathers
[1:05:24] in jehovah jairo from 1964 he says and
[1:05:26] he was well told us
[1:05:28] and promises these things according to
[1:05:30] the bible in many places even the old
[1:05:31] testament promises it
[1:05:32] in malachi 4 that how it would be the
[1:05:35] last days
[1:05:37] would turn the hearts of the children
[1:05:38] back to the faith of the fathers
[1:05:40] as the pentecostal fathers the original
[1:05:42] doctrine of the bible
[1:05:43] the original word that what it would do
[1:05:47] so what does it mean to turn the hearts
[1:05:48] of the children back to the faith of the
[1:05:50] fathers
[1:05:50] he wants to bring him back to the
[1:05:52] original word the original new testament
[1:05:54] church
[1:05:54] back to what paul wrote back to what the
[1:05:56] apostles wrote back to what they meant
[1:05:58] when
[1:05:59] what they said he's going to take them
[1:06:02] back to the original doctor in the bible
[1:06:04] back to the original word
[1:06:07] and resume of the ages he says but what
[1:06:09] about the true seed it will happen
[1:06:11] just as we have said the people of god
[1:06:15] are being made ready
[1:06:16] by the word of truth from the messenger
[1:06:18] to this age
[1:06:19] and her will be the fullness of
[1:06:21] pentecost for the spirit will bring the
[1:06:23] people
[1:06:24] right back to where they were at the
[1:06:27] beginning
[1:06:29] thus saith the lord
[1:06:37] see
[1:06:41] when god was going to bring forth his
[1:06:43] promise
[1:06:44] of abraham's seed the promised seed
[1:06:49] it was god's word and that god god's
[1:06:51] word went and that word had to be
[1:06:53] fulfilled and
[1:06:54] god was going to have to get them in a
[1:06:55] condition amen so that they could
[1:06:58] conceive and bring forth a child so god
[1:07:01] shows up on the planes of memory
[1:07:03] and there's been so many things happen
[1:07:05] in so many obstacles and separations and
[1:07:08] and things that they had learned and
[1:07:09] finally he shows up and
[1:07:11] and it's elohim and a body of flesh and
[1:07:13] he's going to perform the sign of the
[1:07:15] messiah
[1:07:16] and in performing the sign of this
[1:07:17] messiah he's also confirming the promise
[1:07:22] and in confirming the promise when he
[1:07:24] confirms the promise
[1:07:26] he specifically mentions sarah
[1:07:31] because sarah is the key to fulfilling
[1:07:35] the promise
[1:07:39] that's why in this day when that prophet
[1:07:41] gone that prophet preached so much about
[1:07:43] the bride and preached the church would
[1:07:45] be the bride
[1:07:45] the bride the bride the bride because
[1:07:47] she's the key to the fulfillment of the
[1:07:50] promise
[1:07:53] amen our our last adam has already come
[1:07:57] he's already
[1:07:58] performed the word he's already done
[1:07:59] exactly what the word will say he will
[1:08:01] do
[1:08:01] he's already paid the price of
[1:08:03] redemption to buy back his lost wife
[1:08:05] and all of creation he's already
[1:08:07] provided his spirit amen
[1:08:09] that'll bring a new birth that'll bring
[1:08:11] a restoration to the church
[1:08:12] he's already done his work he's already
[1:08:14] done everything and now
[1:08:16] he's got to get this bride in condition
[1:08:20] she's the key so when when when god
[1:08:23] shows up in memory speaks to abraham
[1:08:25] he speaks specifically it's time now for
[1:08:27] you this child i will perform this word
[1:08:29] and i will bring through sarah
[1:08:35] and that's when sarah doubts because the
[1:08:36] discernment has to be done on sarah
[1:08:40] so that she'll believe and what does he
[1:08:42] do
[1:08:44] he turns them back
[1:08:47] immediately after the sign of the
[1:08:50] messiah
[1:08:51] after this episode and what else does he
[1:08:52] do he reveals the sixth seal
[1:08:54] to abraham because he shows him the
[1:08:56] destruction of sodom and gomorrh and he
[1:08:57] shows them that there'll be a remnant
[1:08:59] that will be saved out of that because
[1:09:00] he intercedes
[1:09:03] and all of that takes place right there
[1:09:05] in between what is it
[1:09:06] he's showing the sixth seal to abraham
[1:09:10] amen
[1:09:14] and at that time he does the he does the
[1:09:17] discernment he shows the sixth seal to
[1:09:19] abraham
[1:09:20] and then we know
[1:09:23] as the prophet told us when they wake up
[1:09:27] something was different
[1:09:30] maybe sarah looked over at abraham and
[1:09:32] screamed
[1:09:34] she may have thought some strange man is
[1:09:36] in my tents
[1:09:38] because he had been turned back young
[1:09:40] again
[1:09:42] and he looked at sarah said what are you
[1:09:44] screaming about
[1:09:46] go look in the mirror and then she
[1:09:48] screamed a second time
[1:09:52] because he came to show the sign of the
[1:09:54] messiah
[1:09:55] to take them back to their original
[1:09:58] marriage condition
[1:10:00] when they were first unionized when they
[1:10:02] were first brought together in marriage
[1:10:06] because that's what god has done he has
[1:10:08] restored the word
[1:10:10] back to the full word that was given
[1:10:12] through the apostles and the prophets
[1:10:13] he's taken the word back
[1:10:15] and he's taken the bride back he's
[1:10:17] brought them back to their original
[1:10:19] condition at pentecost
[1:10:22] that's what this message has done
[1:10:23] friends it's brought that
[1:10:25] it's brought the word and has brought
[1:10:26] the bride back to their original union
[1:10:29] their original
[1:10:30] marriage condition at pentecost
[1:10:33] [Music]
[1:10:36] and we know that's true because after
[1:10:39] chapter 19 which is destruction of sodom
[1:10:41] and gomorrah
[1:10:42] and the saving of lot and all that
[1:10:43] happens there
[1:10:45] you go to verse 20 or chapter 20. let's
[1:10:47] turn to chapter 20.
[1:10:58] genesis 20 and abraham journeyed from
[1:11:00] thence toward the south
[1:11:02] country and dwelt between kadish and
[1:11:04] sure
[1:11:05] and sojourn and gerar and abraham
[1:11:08] said of sarah his wife she is my sister
[1:11:10] and a demon like king of garage sent
[1:11:12] and took sarah 90 years old
[1:11:18] he wanted her for his harem because she
[1:11:20] was so beautiful
[1:11:24] 90 years old he could have any woman in
[1:11:26] the kingdom he wanted
[1:11:27] but here come a fresh new 90 year old
[1:11:34] and he wanted her showing
[1:11:37] that the event and memory brought them
[1:11:41] faith
[1:11:41] to go back to their original marriage
[1:11:43] condition
[1:11:50] oh praise god i said god help me
[1:11:54] to deliver what's on my heart
[1:11:58] in the laodicean church age from the
[1:12:00] church age book
[1:12:01] prophet of god said now this messenger
[1:12:03] of malachi 4 and revelation 10
[1:12:05] 7 is going to do two things
[1:12:08] one according to malachi 4 he will turn
[1:12:10] the hearts of the children to the
[1:12:11] fathers
[1:12:12] two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:12:15] seven thunders in revelation
[1:12:17] 10 which are the revelations contained
[1:12:19] in the seven seals
[1:12:23] it will be these divinely revealed
[1:12:25] mystery truths that literally
[1:12:27] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:12:29] pentecostal fathers
[1:12:32] it was when he come and showed that
[1:12:34] elohim was hearing flash
[1:12:35] and elohim could confirm the promise and
[1:12:37] elohim could discern
[1:12:38] and then it was it was showing that the
[1:12:40] lamb was present to take the book and
[1:12:42] break the seals and loose the revelation
[1:12:44] thereof amen
[1:12:46] this this revelation this manifestation
[1:12:49] this presence of
[1:12:50] god among them through the sign of the
[1:12:51] messiah and the restoration of the word
[1:12:54] will bring them back to their original
[1:12:56] marriage condition
[1:12:59] and now they're turned back young again
[1:13:03] now she goes back to being the bride
[1:13:06] that she was at pentecost
[1:13:10] the word goes back to its original
[1:13:12] condition
[1:13:14] not old not weak not incapable
[1:13:18] of producing life but the word has gone
[1:13:20] back to fervency in
[1:13:21] life and its original strength
[1:13:24] and the bride is coming back with the
[1:13:27] word
[1:13:31] but still there's no conception
[1:13:35] amen they wake up they're young
[1:13:41] is that right they wake up
[1:13:44] they've been turned young under the
[1:13:48] revelation of the six seal and all that
[1:13:49] they're turned back at the same time
[1:13:54] and when they're turned back young they
[1:13:55] go back to their original condition
[1:13:57] back to what they were when they were
[1:13:58] first married amen when abraham was
[1:14:01] first
[1:14:01] given a bride fresh
[1:14:04] virgin bride and christ was
[1:14:08] given at pentecost a fresh virgin bride
[1:14:11] but she fell away by deception but god
[1:14:13] is going to restore to him a fresh
[1:14:15] virgin bride and brought them back to
[1:14:18] the original condition
[1:14:19] but now they go to gerrard and there's
[1:14:21] no conception yet
[1:14:23] that's right amen because
[1:14:28] when sarah was young and fresh
[1:14:31] and healthy and strong she still didn't
[1:14:34] conceive
[1:14:37] and when the pentecostal church was
[1:14:39] fresh and young and virgin
[1:14:41] she didn't come to the marriage either
[1:14:46] just going back to the original
[1:14:48] condition wasn't enough
[1:14:49] they needed something more
[1:14:54] oh stay with me friends don't think i'm
[1:14:56] saying something wrong it's right here
[1:14:57] in the bible
[1:14:58] amen they went back to young when they
[1:15:00] were young something happened at
[1:15:02] pentecost and before he could get to her
[1:15:03] she was already a fallen woman
[1:15:06] abraham sarah go back to young but they
[1:15:08] were young once before and didn't
[1:15:09] conceive
[1:15:12] but there was going to have to bring
[1:15:13] something to bring a greater faith amen
[1:15:16] that was going to hold her in that
[1:15:17] condition and give her faith and through
[1:15:19] faith she was going to get strength to
[1:15:21] conceive
[1:15:23] not just strength to go back young again
[1:15:25] but go back young and now conceived
[1:15:27] because that's what was missed back
[1:15:29] there
[1:15:29] and never came to the marriage supper it
[1:15:31] never came to the union
[1:15:34] but it's going to be different this time
[1:15:38] amen
[1:15:42] the spoken word is the original seed
[1:15:45] prophet said then from a little group of
[1:15:47] the true seed of the word
[1:15:48] god will present christ a beloved bride
[1:15:51] a virgin of his word and through them
[1:15:54] and by them will be fulfilled all that
[1:15:56] has been promised
[1:15:57] for his word in the virgin who knows no
[1:15:59] man made creeds with dogmas
[1:16:02] the word of promise in himself like it
[1:16:05] was
[1:16:06] in mary god himself made manifest he
[1:16:08] will act himself
[1:16:09] by his own word of promise
[1:16:13] he will act himself by his own word of
[1:16:15] promise
[1:16:18] sarah tried to act and it was wrong
[1:16:22] eve tried to act and it was wrong the
[1:16:24] first church tried to act and it was
[1:16:26] wrong
[1:16:26] but he's going to do it himself amen and
[1:16:28] she'll just hold still
[1:16:30] and trust him and have faith and believe
[1:16:32] him his faith in her will bring the
[1:16:34] promise upon her and he will do the work
[1:16:36] through her
[1:16:42] they just couldn't stay in the word long
[1:16:44] enough
[1:16:45] because couldn't trust him long enough
[1:16:47] probably god says
[1:16:50] by his he will act himself by his own
[1:16:54] word of promise so to fulfill all that
[1:16:56] has been written of him
[1:16:58] as he did when he came from the virgin
[1:17:00] womb a type of the spirit womb now so
[1:17:03] will the virgin now
[1:17:04] accept his word be it unto me
[1:17:07] as thou has said though it was said by
[1:17:11] an angel while it was yet the written
[1:17:12] word isaiah
[1:17:14] 9 6. now he's referring to mary
[1:17:18] amen the the eve had this promise she
[1:17:22] wasn't eve yet i don't i don't even like
[1:17:24] to call her eve we can look back and say
[1:17:25] that that was eve
[1:17:26] but at that time her name was adam she
[1:17:30] was one with her husband
[1:17:31] he said that he made them two male and
[1:17:33] female and called their name adam
[1:17:35] [Music]
[1:17:37] eve was the name she got because of her
[1:17:39] adultery she became the mother of all
[1:17:41] living
[1:17:43] both false and true vine
[1:17:46] but the woman she was in this place and
[1:17:49] she was
[1:17:50] that she was given the word they were
[1:17:51] given the word to keep but it's her own
[1:17:53] reasoning mixed in and mixed with the
[1:17:54] word
[1:17:55] and hybrid designed it and brought death
[1:17:59] sarah was given a word but her own
[1:18:01] reasoning slipped in
[1:18:02] and she hybridized it by offering hagar
[1:18:05] and it brought death
[1:18:07] the first church was given the word to
[1:18:09] keep amen but before he could come to
[1:18:11] that he could come to her
[1:18:13] amen to perform the word she hybridized
[1:18:15] it with man's reasoning and man's
[1:18:17] thinking
[1:18:18] and man's interpretation of the word and
[1:18:21] it brought
[1:18:24] death
[1:18:28] and god come to mary
[1:18:34] mary was a chosen elected seed
[1:18:38] so was the woman in genesis so was sarah
[1:18:44] she was predestinated chosen and elected
[1:18:47] there was a word that went forth but in
[1:18:49] order for god to fulfill his word he
[1:18:50] needed a woman
[1:18:55] in order for god to fulfill his word he
[1:18:57] needed a woman
[1:19:00] and so he come to this little virgin in
[1:19:02] nazareth
[1:19:04] and when he comes to this little virgin
[1:19:07] the angel appeared and said
[1:19:09] it's now time for the promise
[1:19:13] why do you think that angel showed up to
[1:19:15] her and an angel began to speak to her
[1:19:17] because the visitation of the angel was
[1:19:19] going to give her strength was going to
[1:19:20] give her faith to believe the word of
[1:19:22] god
[1:19:24] so god sent an angel at the time it was
[1:19:27] going to require this woman to have
[1:19:28] faith
[1:19:32] god sent the angel to her and says it's
[1:19:34] time to confirm the promise
[1:19:36] and she slips into that reasoning mode
[1:19:40] how can these things be knowing that
[1:19:43] seeing that i know no man
[1:19:45] i have never had relations with a man
[1:19:47] how am i going to conceive
[1:19:49] she asked a very natural question
[1:19:52] in fact the humanly speaking is a very
[1:19:54] reasonable question
[1:19:56] and the angel gave her a very
[1:19:58] unscientific
[1:20:00] unreasonable answer he said the holy
[1:20:03] spirit
[1:20:04] shall overshadow thee she asked a very
[1:20:07] biological question
[1:20:10] that actually had to do with cells and
[1:20:12] and
[1:20:13] cell fusion and cell multiplication
[1:20:16] she was a scientist
[1:20:19] and she said all my science books they
[1:20:21] tell me this is not possible
[1:20:24] so i'm looking for a scientific answer
[1:20:26] on how this is going to work
[1:20:28] and so the angel came and gave her what
[1:20:30] she needed she didn't need a scientific
[1:20:32] answer
[1:20:32] she needed to know that this was going
[1:20:34] to be the power of god amen as the holy
[1:20:36] ghost the spirit of god himself
[1:20:38] he's going to perform his own word in
[1:20:40] you
[1:20:42] and that was enough for this little
[1:20:44] chosen seed she didn't need any better
[1:20:46] understanding she didn't need a better
[1:20:47] explanation
[1:20:48] the explanation she got did not answer
[1:20:50] her question the explanation she got
[1:20:52] showed the true power of god to keep and
[1:20:55] perform his own word
[1:20:56] [Applause]
[1:20:57] and she said be it unto me
[1:21:01] according to your word she had nothing
[1:21:04] she could do to produce this word
[1:21:06] she could have read isaiah 9 6 all day
[1:21:08] long she could have read all the
[1:21:09] prophecies of a promisee she could have
[1:21:11] read genesis 3.
[1:21:12] amen but she had no power within herself
[1:21:15] to produce the word
[1:21:16] although she was the chosen elected one
[1:21:20] god needed a woman she was that woman
[1:21:22] but she had no power no matter how much
[1:21:24] she read it no matter how much she
[1:21:26] believed it
[1:21:27] she didn't have the power to perform
[1:21:28] herself
[1:21:31] when time is right an angel would come
[1:21:34] to give her faith that she's the one
[1:21:40] and this is the time
[1:21:43] what was the angel telling her you're
[1:21:45] the one
[1:21:47] and this is the time
[1:21:50] there's a group of people on the earth
[1:21:52] that's had a visitation from an angel
[1:21:55] and that angel has come to us through a
[1:21:56] prophetic ministry and that angel has
[1:21:58] come to us to say
[1:22:00] you're the one and this is the time
[1:22:04] and that built such a faith in those
[1:22:06] elect people that they could say
[1:22:08] be it unto me according to your word i
[1:22:10] can't do it but you can do it it's not
[1:22:12] my power but by your spirit
[1:22:14] i'm just yielding myself to you and you
[1:22:16] can do it
[1:22:19] there's nothing that the church can do
[1:22:21] to produce the word except believe him
[1:22:23] and yield to
[1:22:24] his word surrender
[1:22:29] in the message proving his word the
[1:22:31] prophet says now we say
[1:22:33] he's raised from the dead i didn't say
[1:22:36] it
[1:22:36] the word here said it they said he
[1:22:38] raised from the dead he says he's the
[1:22:39] same yesterday
[1:22:40] and forever you believe that he promised
[1:22:43] these things to happen in this last day
[1:22:45] the same son of man will be made
[1:22:46] manifest
[1:22:48] now remember that was not jesus talking
[1:22:51] to abraham there
[1:22:52] that could discern the thoughts in
[1:22:53] sarah's mind behind him that was not
[1:22:55] jesus he had not yet been born
[1:22:58] but it was a human it was a man in human
[1:23:00] flesh
[1:23:02] that abraham called elohim the great
[1:23:05] almighty
[1:23:06] showing and jesus said as it was in the
[1:23:08] days of sodom
[1:23:10] now watch close in the days of sodom so
[1:23:13] will it be at the coming of the son of
[1:23:15] man
[1:23:15] when the son of man is being revealed
[1:23:17] not no more as a church see not no more
[1:23:20] the bride is called in the day the son
[1:23:24] of man will be revealed
[1:23:25] what's the revealing of the son of man
[1:23:26] doing calling the bride
[1:23:29] calling her back to her original
[1:23:31] marriage condition
[1:23:32] back to her virginity when she was
[1:23:36] offered fresh
[1:23:37] from the hand of god same thing
[1:23:40] that the visitation and memory was doing
[1:23:42] to sarah
[1:23:43] amen
[1:23:47] see no more as a church see the bride is
[1:23:49] called in the day the son of man will be
[1:23:51] revealed what to join the church
[1:23:53] to the head unite the marriage of the
[1:23:56] bride
[1:23:57] the bridegroom call will come right
[1:23:58] through this when the son of man will
[1:24:00] come down and come in human flesh to
[1:24:02] unite the two
[1:24:04] together the church has to be the word
[1:24:07] he is the word
[1:24:08] and the two unites together and to do
[1:24:10] that it will take the manifestation
[1:24:12] of the revealing of the son of man not a
[1:24:15] clergyman
[1:24:17] do you see what i mean it's a son of man
[1:24:19] jesus christ will come down in human
[1:24:20] flesh among us
[1:24:21] and will make his word so real that it
[1:24:24] will unite the church and him as one the
[1:24:25] bride
[1:24:26] and then shall go home to the wedding
[1:24:28] supper amen she's already
[1:24:30] united see we go to the wedding supper
[1:24:32] not to the marriage
[1:24:35] so see fill your flesh you're starting
[1:24:37] to quote the scripture for yourself of
[1:24:38] all the flesh of mighty men because the
[1:24:40] marriage of the lamb
[1:24:41] has come but the rapture is going to the
[1:24:43] wedding supper
[1:24:44] when the word here unites with the
[1:24:46] person and they too become
[1:24:47] one and then what does it do then it
[1:24:50] manifests the son of man
[1:24:52] again not the church theologians the son
[1:24:55] of man
[1:24:56] listen i want you to catch this amen
[1:24:59] that
[1:24:59] son of man that manifestation was to
[1:25:02] bring her
[1:25:03] back and unite the two together like
[1:25:05] they were supposed to be at pentecost
[1:25:09] but before he could come to her to bring
[1:25:11] forth the promised word
[1:25:12] she was already a fallen woman but
[1:25:15] there's going to be a restoration back
[1:25:18] so in the restoration back he's got to
[1:25:20] bring her back to the condition she was
[1:25:22] at pentecost
[1:25:24] and then he's going to unite the two
[1:25:26] together to bring the headship to the
[1:25:28] body
[1:25:28] to bring the marriage the union the
[1:25:30] uniting the invisible union of the bride
[1:25:33] in christ
[1:25:36] and what's it to do to manifest the son
[1:25:40] of man again
[1:25:43] what's it to do to reproduce himself
[1:25:51] the manifest it manifests the son of man
[1:25:54] again
[1:25:55] not church theologians
[1:25:58] the son of man the word and the church
[1:26:01] becomes one whatever the son of man done
[1:26:05] he was the word the church does the same
[1:26:08] thing
[1:26:11] the spoken word is the original seed he
[1:26:13] says o people
[1:26:14] god bless you hear me i can't believe
[1:26:16] nothing but god's word
[1:26:18] i want it to be my life everything that
[1:26:20] i am i want you to do the same let your
[1:26:22] walks your talks your moves everything
[1:26:24] you do be in the word of god
[1:26:26] let the mind of christ come into you and
[1:26:28] that'll pregnant you with the word
[1:26:31] if you don't if you let the mind of the
[1:26:32] denomination come in you'll be a
[1:26:33] denominational impregnated
[1:26:36] if you do you hear what he said if you
[1:26:40] let the mind of the denomination
[1:26:44] doesn't even mean entering into a
[1:26:46] denomination or joining the nomination
[1:26:47] but you let the mind of the denomination
[1:26:49] command
[1:26:49] you'll be the nomination impregnated
[1:26:53] some people believe that i can only
[1:26:54] become denominational impregnated if i'm
[1:26:56] in a denominational church that's not
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:02] true
[1:27:04] if you let the mind of christ come into
[1:27:06] you he can't deny his own word
[1:27:09] because he's god you be pregnated with
[1:27:11] the word and believe it
[1:27:12] i don't care if they put you out kick
[1:27:14] you out run you out and every door is
[1:27:16] closed you'll go just the same amen
[1:27:18] i got he says i got to hurry now christ
[1:27:20] is now
[1:27:21] taking himself a bride to be pregnant
[1:27:23] with his own
[1:27:24] seed word in her womb spirit womb in her
[1:27:27] mind
[1:27:28] and won't mix with any denominational
[1:27:30] trash with it she is a virgin
[1:27:33] to him
[1:27:36] that's why we had this mighty visitation
[1:27:39] that's why and when the seals were open
[1:27:42] that's why
[1:27:43] her heart was turned back to the the
[1:27:45] heart of the fathers the pentecostal
[1:27:47] fathers
[1:27:48] she was brought back to original virgin
[1:27:50] condition where the prophet of god would
[1:27:52] say
[1:27:52] those that are standing with the word
[1:27:54] and standing on this word every jot and
[1:27:56] every title
[1:27:57] you're the sinless spotless virtuous
[1:27:59] bride of jesus christ
[1:28:01] what's he doing he's bringing you back
[1:28:03] to your wedding condition
[1:28:05] so that he could unite the two together
[1:28:09] the the apostle paul he said i'm jealous
[1:28:12] over you with a godly jealousy because i
[1:28:14] have espoused you to one husband but i
[1:28:16] fear for you lest you be beguiled
[1:28:18] as eve was begotten in your mind be
[1:28:21] deceived in your mind
[1:28:22] amen paul wanted to present a virgin to
[1:28:25] christ i've espoused you
[1:28:26] but i'm worried that you're going to
[1:28:28] fall out of this virgin condition
[1:28:30] by being deceived in your mind and that
[1:28:33] is exactly what happened to the first
[1:28:35] church
[1:28:37] so god had to restore he had to bring
[1:28:40] back
[1:28:41] the restoration of the bride true had to
[1:28:42] bring a bride back for christ
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:45] and through this ministry he has brought
[1:28:48] a bride back to christ
[1:28:49] amen and she's not polluted in her mind
[1:28:51] but she's been washed by the water of
[1:28:53] the word that washed all the prostitute
[1:28:56] spirits away from her from the great
[1:28:57] and all her prostitute daughters
[1:29:01] so she could come back to a virgin
[1:29:03] condition by the grace of god
[1:29:06] and be united with christ
[1:29:10] let's take a look at genesis
[1:29:13] 21.
[1:29:17] god had showed up and talked to abraham
[1:29:20] so many times
[1:29:22] he told abraham to come out of his land
[1:29:23] he told abraham he was going to have
[1:29:25] seed
[1:29:26] he told abraham eliezer wasn't going to
[1:29:28] be a seed he told him sarah
[1:29:30] was going to be the one who produces the
[1:29:31] seed he had come on the plains of mamrie
[1:29:34] to show the sign of the messiah amen to
[1:29:36] bring the revelation of the word
[1:29:38] to bring them back to their original
[1:29:39] marriage condition and he was going to
[1:29:41] show they were turned back young by
[1:29:43] letting them go down to gerar
[1:29:46] king was going to desire her and god was
[1:29:48] going to rescue and preserve that
[1:29:50] vergency
[1:29:53] look at how the devil when when she's
[1:29:55] turned back to virgin again and she
[1:29:57] comes back
[1:29:58] to her youthfulness and then she goes
[1:30:00] back to her original marriage condition
[1:30:02] look how quickly the devil tries to
[1:30:04] enter in
[1:30:05] and disrupt the plan of god by them like
[1:30:07] taking her and corrupting her womb
[1:30:09] [Music]
[1:30:11] but although abraham now failed
[1:30:14] abraham was chosen amen sarah was chosen
[1:30:17] these two were one god through a
[1:30:19] ministry
[1:30:20] of elohim and flesh with the sign of the
[1:30:22] messiah and the revelation of his mind
[1:30:24] had taken them back to a youthful
[1:30:26] condition and now
[1:30:28] this whole deal with abimelech looks to
[1:30:30] threaten that so what does god do god
[1:30:32] comes on the scene and rescues him now
[1:30:34] because it's not going to happen this
[1:30:36] time
[1:30:37] it's happened time after time after time
[1:30:40] but god comes down on the scene this
[1:30:41] time and said
[1:30:42] it's not going to happen this time and
[1:30:45] this bride has been turned
[1:30:46] back to original condition at pentecost
[1:30:49] and been united with christ
[1:30:50] amen and don't think there's not a
[1:30:52] beamelec moves out there
[1:30:53] trying to move but god is watching this
[1:30:57] bride
[1:30:58] god's going to make sure no matter what
[1:31:00] decisions are made no matter what
[1:31:02] happens
[1:31:02] he is not going to let a beamelec move
[1:31:05] move on this bride
[1:31:06] and ruin the vergency of that bride
[1:31:09] he has restored her this is the time for
[1:31:11] the promise to be fulfilled and
[1:31:13] god himself is interjecting himself in a
[1:31:16] supernatural way to make sure that this
[1:31:18] time it doesn't fail
[1:31:24] then after all that he comes to chapter
[1:31:28] 21.
[1:31:30] amen and the lord visited sarah
[1:31:34] as he had said and the lord did unto
[1:31:37] sarah
[1:31:38] as he had spoken and sarah conceived
[1:31:43] and bear abraham a son in his old age at
[1:31:45] the set time
[1:31:47] of which god had spoken to him
[1:31:50] amen this
[1:31:54] time it's to sarah
[1:31:58] amen every other time to abraham to
[1:32:01] abraham to abram
[1:32:03] even on the plains of memory he came to
[1:32:04] abraham but then he included sarah
[1:32:08] but this time he comes directly to sarah
[1:32:13] this is a visitation of the lord and the
[1:32:16] lord visits
[1:32:17] sarah because this time it's not a
[1:32:20] public
[1:32:21] show this is the third pool this is the
[1:32:24] inner chamber
[1:32:25] this is the private union this is the
[1:32:27] confirmation this is the conception of
[1:32:29] the sea
[1:32:30] this is going to bring forth the
[1:32:31] promised side this is what it's all been
[1:32:34] about amen
[1:32:35] this is what the whole bible has been
[1:32:37] about because the heart purpose of god
[1:32:40] was to have a bride of his own choosing
[1:32:42] and he gave christ a bride to reproduce
[1:32:44] himself but it got disrupted just like
[1:32:46] in the garden amen but god this time has
[1:32:48] come
[1:32:49] down in flesh to make sure that he would
[1:32:51] do something that would give them faith
[1:32:53] to go back to their original condition
[1:32:55] [Music]
[1:32:56] but after they went back to the original
[1:32:57] condition he still has another work to
[1:33:00] do
[1:33:01] and that work is not going to involve a
[1:33:04] tabernacle of flesh
[1:33:05] that work is not going to involve a
[1:33:07] public show that work is not going to
[1:33:09] involve a public
[1:33:11] discernment
[1:33:14] because this is the breaking of the
[1:33:17] seventh seal
[1:33:18] individually personally to the
[1:33:20] individual sarah
[1:33:22] it is not going to be a platform
[1:33:24] demonstration it's not going to be a
[1:33:26] manifestation that all can look at
[1:33:28] it's not going to be for everybody but
[1:33:30] it's for one person
[1:33:31] and one person only and it's the lord
[1:33:34] visiting himself
[1:33:35] to sarah and he confirms the promise to
[1:33:37] sarah and
[1:33:38] sarah conceives
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:44] she didn't conceive until this
[1:33:48] visitation
[1:33:51] not memory that brought her back
[1:33:56] that brought her back to her youthful
[1:33:57] condition that brought her back to her
[1:33:59] emergency
[1:34:00] union to her mate but that didn't bring
[1:34:02] conception
[1:34:04] this private visitation
[1:34:08] with no details what happened what did
[1:34:11] he look like how did it come what was
[1:34:13] her sensation
[1:34:16] did she speak with tongues did she dance
[1:34:17] on the floor did she
[1:34:20] what did she do tell us more
[1:34:23] this is the confirmation of the promise
[1:34:25] this is the climax
[1:34:27] this is the greatest part of the story
[1:34:29] what happened
[1:34:32] she went into the little room
[1:34:35] [Applause]
[1:34:37] inside the tent she went to this little
[1:34:39] room where the pillar of fire was
[1:34:41] and she came on the other end changed
[1:34:43] something changed something was
[1:34:44] different
[1:34:45] she was now impregnated by the word of
[1:34:47] god
[1:34:48] the promise and her were now one what
[1:34:50] god had promised
[1:34:52] and her had now become one because the
[1:34:54] promised seed was now in her
[1:34:56] they were persons together as one
[1:35:01] you gotta say what happened i don't know
[1:35:04] [Music]
[1:35:06] what happened in there i don't know
[1:35:09] i can't explain it but i'm changed
[1:35:13] everything about me is different
[1:35:16] she had passed through the private
[1:35:19] meeting of the visitation of the lord
[1:35:20] to her personally
[1:35:24] and there she conceived on the promise
[1:35:27] and now she became the carrier of the
[1:35:30] promised word for that day
[1:35:32] now the very promise of jehovah now the
[1:35:34] very word
[1:35:35] was her she was manifesting the word the
[1:35:38] word was in her
[1:35:39] flowing through her and now she
[1:35:43] was going to bring forth the promised
[1:35:45] land because the whole thing was hinged
[1:35:48] on sarah
[1:35:54] praise god praise the lord
[1:35:58] i don't know about you but this makes me
[1:35:59] want to fly i am flying
[1:36:02] i'm in heavenly places i'm so far above
[1:36:04] laodicea right now it can't touch me
[1:36:07] so far above denominations they don't
[1:36:09] mean anything to me
[1:36:10] the criticisms of man and the light of
[1:36:12] this truth mean nothing amen
[1:36:14] the eagles are flying amen they're above
[1:36:16] the storm they're above the denomination
[1:36:18] they're above the criticism
[1:36:19] they're above it all because this
[1:36:22] revelation has resurrected us and lifted
[1:36:24] us into heavenly places
[1:36:25] and now the promise is in her her and
[1:36:28] the promise are the same thing
[1:36:31] because it's in her tabernacle of flesh
[1:36:33] now she's bearing the promise
[1:36:35] now she's bringing forth the promise
[1:36:40] praise be to god this is heavenly places
[1:36:44] and if this doesn't excite you friend
[1:36:46] might as well go to a ball game because
[1:36:47] this is the
[1:36:48] this is it amen this is the climax this
[1:36:51] is the time
[1:36:52] that god has built his whole word to to
[1:36:54] this time now
[1:36:56] and he has brought amen the sign of the
[1:36:59] messiah he has brought himself in a body
[1:37:01] of flesh
[1:37:02] to show us the son of man ministry
[1:37:05] to bring us back to what they were in
[1:37:08] pentecost
[1:37:10] back to the faith of the fathers and
[1:37:13] then when it was time
[1:37:15] he came to us individually
[1:37:22] because hebrews 11 hebrews 11.
[1:37:28] let's turn it let's just turn let's just
[1:37:29] read it we got time
[1:37:32] hebrews 11.
[1:37:46] hebrews 11
[1:37:50] verse 11 11 11.
[1:37:54] i didn't even realize this is part 11.
[1:37:59] through faith through faith
[1:38:03] also sarah herself received strength
[1:38:08] to conceive
[1:38:11] not strength to be turned back young
[1:38:16] strength to be turned back young came to
[1:38:18] the manifestation
[1:38:19] through the second full manifestation
[1:38:21] and the restoration of the word
[1:38:24] is that true the planes of mammary after
[1:38:27] that incident she was turned back young
[1:38:30] but it says here through faith also
[1:38:32] sarah herself
[1:38:34] herself herself one individual one
[1:38:37] person
[1:38:37] this revelation is to one person and one
[1:38:40] person only
[1:38:43] through faith also sarah herself
[1:38:46] received strength
[1:38:48] to conceive when did she receive
[1:38:51] strength to conceive rev genesis
[1:38:55] chapter 21 when the lord of the lord
[1:38:59] came and visited sarah herself
[1:39:03] it's the private union between you and
[1:39:05] him it's the private meeting of almighty
[1:39:08] god in you
[1:39:09] it's the private thing that takes place
[1:39:11] in the little room when you enter into
[1:39:12] that little room in the tabernacle
[1:39:14] and you can't explain what happened but
[1:39:16] when you come out you know you've met
[1:39:18] the pillar of fire you know everything's
[1:39:20] been changed that god has revealed to
[1:39:21] you that you're the one down carrying
[1:39:23] the seed
[1:39:25] what was it it was the private meeting
[1:39:27] when the lord came to her
[1:39:28] and the lord and when the lord came to
[1:39:31] her
[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:33] then it produced in her of faith
[1:39:37] her she was given by through faith she
[1:39:41] was given
[1:39:41] strength
[1:39:45] it's going to take a supernatural
[1:39:47] strength to conceive on the sea
[1:39:49] but this strength is going to come when
[1:39:51] he comes to you
[1:39:54] when he comes to you through faith he's
[1:39:57] going to give you strength to conceive
[1:40:02] so many people have saw planes of
[1:40:04] mammary so many people
[1:40:05] can know that the seals are open amen
[1:40:08] but it's when he comes to you
[1:40:11] that he'll give you strength to conceive
[1:40:13] to do what to produce the son of man
[1:40:15] again
[1:40:17] amen god did not turn sarah young
[1:40:20] so she could go back to what she was at
[1:40:22] pentecost just to fall again by
[1:40:24] receiving denominational ideas
[1:40:27] he didn't bring her back to where she
[1:40:29] was at the beginning to not conceive to
[1:40:31] repeat the process over again
[1:40:33] but he brought her back through the
[1:40:34] visitation on the planes of memory he
[1:40:36] brought her back
[1:40:37] so that he could restore to her
[1:40:39] conception so that she could bring forth
[1:40:41] the promised word
[1:40:43] and in this hour we can shout we can
[1:40:46] dance
[1:40:46] we can be happy that there was a elohim
[1:40:49] and flesh
[1:40:50] that could turn us back to the crowd and
[1:40:52] discern thoughts that gave us strength
[1:40:54] to go back to be a pentecostal church to
[1:40:56] the original faith of the fathers
[1:40:58] that's wonderful but we can dance dance
[1:40:59] and shout now and i'm sure abraham was
[1:41:01] excited and sarah was excited but it
[1:41:03] didn't
[1:41:04] yet bring a conception
[1:41:07] and the purpose was the conception the
[1:41:10] purpose was that sarah was going to
[1:41:12] bring forth the promised son
[1:41:14] and i'm sure they got up that morning
[1:41:16] and they were dancing and
[1:41:18] i'm sure that they were excited and i'm
[1:41:20] sure that there was a jubilee in the
[1:41:21] camp
[1:41:27] but god wasn't finished yet
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:31] that wasn't the end of the story yet
[1:41:34] because he did all that for a purpose
[1:41:37] to bring the promised son through sarah
[1:41:40] and until that purpose was finished god
[1:41:42] wasn't done working
[1:41:45] amen so in verse 21 he would allow him
[1:41:48] to go in garage so you and i would know
[1:41:49] that they've already been turned young
[1:41:51] so we wouldn't be confused about this
[1:41:53] process
[1:41:56] then after that he comes to her
[1:42:01] privately and doesn't tell us
[1:42:05] anything else
[1:42:08] the greatest part of the story
[1:42:11] the most thrilling part the most
[1:42:13] exciting part
[1:42:14] the one that changes every the one that
[1:42:17] makes this story worth retelling
[1:42:21] the climax
[1:42:24] is so anti-climatic
[1:42:29] brother comes preaching the seven seals
[1:42:31] amen and he's preaching the first the
[1:42:33] second and the third and they're
[1:42:34] thrilling
[1:42:35] amen you're getting excited amen the
[1:42:37] church has turned back to the original
[1:42:38] doctrine
[1:42:39] of the fathers amen everything's so
[1:42:41] exciting then he comes to the seventh
[1:42:43] seal
[1:42:44] and this is it this is the crowning this
[1:42:46] is the whole thing this is the whole
[1:42:47] bible this is the whole purpose of
[1:42:49] everything god's written and god's done
[1:42:50] seventh seal
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:54] and it's so anticlimactic
[1:42:58] now we've come to the point of the whole
[1:43:02] week of services
[1:43:06] now we've come to the point of brother
[1:43:09] branham's entire
[1:43:10] ministry that's his ministry
[1:43:13] he's the messenger of the seventh seal
[1:43:16] that's what he said he's the messenger
[1:43:17] of the seventh seal
[1:43:19] his whole ministry comes down to this
[1:43:22] one message
[1:43:24] and he spends most of the message
[1:43:26] preaching the sixth seal
[1:43:30] and when he's done preaching the sixth
[1:43:31] seal he says
[1:43:33] i just feel a stop
[1:43:37] right there
[1:43:40] because when he had the vision of the
[1:43:41] third pool back in 1956 when he first
[1:43:44] tells it
[1:43:45] in 1956 he was trying to catch the
[1:43:48] rainbow trout the covenant fish the
[1:43:49] children of god
[1:43:51] and in the first pool that was going to
[1:43:53] be the sign in the hand and the healing
[1:43:55] and he pulled the lure amen and that
[1:43:58] attracted all the little fish
[1:44:00] so it would get the attention of the big
[1:44:01] fish and they all gathered around the
[1:44:04] lure
[1:44:04] then he says you've got to jerk it a
[1:44:06] second time and in the second pool which
[1:44:08] is discernment
[1:44:11] he pulls it clear out of the water
[1:44:13] tangles his line he's got a little bitty
[1:44:15] fish just like skin over the lure
[1:44:17] and he failed and he's talking about his
[1:44:19] failure and the angel said i told you
[1:44:21] not to do that
[1:44:23] then he gives him a baby shoe and he's
[1:44:25] trying to take this big cord and he's
[1:44:26] trying to shove it through this baby
[1:44:27] shoe
[1:44:28] and the angel tells him i told you you
[1:44:30] cannot teach spiritual things to
[1:44:32] to babes to pentecostal babes because
[1:44:35] brother bran was trying to bring them
[1:44:37] up higher in the word and he was trying
[1:44:39] to bring them to spiritual realities but
[1:44:41] they were pentecostal babes and they
[1:44:42] were not able to grow
[1:44:43] because you have to take the meat to
[1:44:45] grow and they wanted the milk
[1:44:48] so they refused to grow so they couldn't
[1:44:50] get this cord
[1:44:51] through the little eyelets then he
[1:44:54] lifted him up and he showed him a
[1:44:55] tabernacle
[1:44:56] a huge tabernacle and a crowd they were
[1:44:58] calling a prayer line crowd going out of
[1:45:00] the building
[1:45:01] and in the in the tabernacle was a
[1:45:02] little wooden room
[1:45:06] and in the little room he's still
[1:45:07] showing him three pools
[1:45:11] and in the little room
[1:45:15] you don't see brother branham on the
[1:45:17] platform
[1:45:19] you can't see anything a line of people
[1:45:23] this way
[1:45:24] and people coming out one by one this
[1:45:27] way
[1:45:29] and if you try to figure out that third
[1:45:32] pull
[1:45:34] all you're going to find out when you
[1:45:35] ask the people who were going through
[1:45:37] the little room
[1:45:38] is that they have no idea what happened
[1:45:41] but they changed
[1:45:46] and god told him he says this will be
[1:45:48] your third pool
[1:45:52] and it won't be a public
[1:45:56] show that's why when brother branham
[1:45:59] gets into the seventh seal he's breaking
[1:46:00] down the seventh seal
[1:46:01] and then he says i feel to stop before
[1:46:03] he gets into it he's reviewing he gets
[1:46:05] into the seventh seal
[1:46:06] he says i feel to stop then he starts
[1:46:07] going into parables and trying to remind
[1:46:08] you remember the baby shoe remember the
[1:46:10] tent
[1:46:11] remember the sword remember that and he
[1:46:13] goes to the sword and sabino came in
[1:46:14] when god put the sword in his hand at
[1:46:16] sabino canyon
[1:46:17] before in the tent he said this will be
[1:46:19] your third pool but when he gets the
[1:46:21] sword dropped in his hand he says
[1:46:22] this is your third tool
[1:46:26] and what was the third pool to do to
[1:46:28] catch the rainbow trout the covenant
[1:46:30] fish
[1:46:31] to bring them into the kingdom of god
[1:46:35] and so when he gets to the seventh seal
[1:46:37] he says i feel to stop why
[1:46:38] it matches the vision perfectly he had
[1:46:41] back at the end of 1955.
[1:46:44] it's come now a full seven year cycle to
[1:46:46] completion
[1:46:47] and at the end of seven years now we're
[1:46:49] standing here in the completion
[1:46:50] and when he's completing it he's just
[1:46:52] demonstrated the seventh seal
[1:46:54] because the lamb is the only one that
[1:46:55] can take the book and open the seals
[1:46:59] he's been demonstrating all a week that
[1:47:01] the seventh seal is here
[1:47:03] it's a person
[1:47:08] and he gets down and he doesn't explain
[1:47:11] it
[1:47:14] because he failed by explaining the
[1:47:16] first two
[1:47:18] and he's told this won't be a public
[1:47:19] show and then brother bam says
[1:47:21] now now it won't be broke to the public
[1:47:26] until that hour amen he didn't say it
[1:47:29] wouldn't be broke
[1:47:31] he said it wouldn't be broke to the
[1:47:33] public amen
[1:47:36] this seventh seal came to sarah
[1:47:40] and it wasn't a public show
[1:47:43] in revelation 21 or in genesis 21 he
[1:47:46] came to sarah and it wasn't a public
[1:47:49] show
[1:47:49] and it wasn't broke to the public until
[1:47:52] that time
[1:47:53] amen but there come a time she can only
[1:47:55] carry it so long
[1:47:59] amen and then and then it broke forth
[1:48:03] amen and the promised son came forth
[1:48:05] from her
[1:48:05] and there was no hiding anymore and now
[1:48:08] was broke forth
[1:48:09] [Music]
[1:48:12] praise be to god
[1:48:21] through faith sarah
[1:48:25] receives strength what is this third
[1:48:28] pull to do
[1:48:29] to bring you the faith to conceive
[1:48:33] to bring you back to what you were but
[1:48:35] if you go back to what the church was at
[1:48:37] pentecost
[1:48:38] that church fell
[1:48:41] so to go back to the church you were at
[1:48:43] pentecost amen in order not to fall you
[1:48:46] need
[1:48:46] something more to happen because that
[1:48:49] condition wasn't enough
[1:48:52] it was going to take the presence of god
[1:48:55] himself amen
[1:48:56] and not just coming down in somebody
[1:48:58] else but coming down to you personally
[1:49:00] and injecting his life inside of you
[1:49:02] amen until now you
[1:49:04] were the carrier of this promised son
[1:49:09] to seal the bride
[1:49:12] so that nothing else can get to her
[1:49:16] pentecost fell by taking another seat
[1:49:19] brother man said this bride won't fall
[1:49:21] she's predestinating that
[1:49:24] he's coming himself
[1:49:28] through faith sarah
[1:49:33] through faith sarah receives strength
[1:49:37] what does this personal revelation of
[1:49:40] christ reveal personally to you to do
[1:49:42] to give you strength
[1:49:45] without this revelation you don't have
[1:49:47] the strength to conceive
[1:49:51] all of it come down to give you
[1:49:53] personally as an
[1:49:54] individual a revelation then god himself
[1:49:57] will come to you to give you a
[1:49:59] revelation to conceive on this seed
[1:50:03] and then now you and the promise are one
[1:50:07] amen for the promise is alive
[1:50:10] in you amen that's the secret
[1:50:15] that's right brother brahm says now
[1:50:19] it is a revelation for the revelation is
[1:50:22] faith
[1:50:23] you cannot have a revelation without it
[1:50:25] being faith faith is a revelation
[1:50:27] because it's something that's revealed
[1:50:29] to you
[1:50:29] faith is a revelation faith is something
[1:50:31] that has been revealed to you like it
[1:50:33] was to abraham
[1:50:34] that could call anything contrary to
[1:50:36] what he had been revealed to him
[1:50:37] as though it was not so now faith
[1:50:40] that's what faith is is the revelation
[1:50:43] of god the church is built upon a
[1:50:45] revelation
[1:50:46] the whole entire body
[1:50:49] and the message choosing of a bride he
[1:50:51] says we find today that the modern
[1:50:54] church a modern world church the modern
[1:50:56] world church and also that the
[1:50:57] spiritual church are both pregnanted to
[1:50:59] give birth to sons
[1:51:02] one of them a denominational birth is
[1:51:04] going to give one day
[1:51:06] to these days a a world council of
[1:51:08] churches
[1:51:09] which will produce the world which will
[1:51:11] produce to the world the antichrist
[1:51:13] through a denomination
[1:51:14] that's exactly the truth i may not live
[1:51:17] to see it but i believe i will but
[1:51:19] you young people remember that you heard
[1:51:21] a minister say that that'll finally wind
[1:51:23] up
[1:51:23] and that is the mark of the beast when
[1:51:25] she comes forth the world council
[1:51:27] churches and she'll give birth to her
[1:51:28] son
[1:51:29] the antichrist the other is pregnanted
[1:51:33] by the word of god and will bring forth
[1:51:34] the body
[1:51:35] the finished body of jesus christ
[1:51:39] which is the bride
[1:51:42] what is she bringing forth the bride
[1:51:46] what is that that's the manifestation of
[1:51:48] this hour
[1:51:49] that is the word promised for this hour
[1:51:53] the body of christ isn't finished yet
[1:51:55] how many knows that a man and his woman
[1:51:56] is one
[1:51:57] christ is one body the word the bride
[1:52:00] will have to be the rest of that body
[1:52:01] and the two together makes the one body
[1:52:03] again
[1:52:04] like adam was at the beginning man and
[1:52:06] his wife were one
[1:52:07] now she the true bride so sold out to
[1:52:10] him that she uses no mind of her own
[1:52:12] his mind of course is his will and his
[1:52:15] will is his word
[1:52:16] amen that's all she needs
[1:52:20] now how many remember my title i said
[1:52:23] we're going to go around the couch yeah
[1:52:26] we're around and it's sarah's last
[1:52:29] declaration let's go back to genesis 21.
[1:52:44] genesis 21
[1:52:50] we read in verse one where said and the
[1:52:52] lord visited sarah as he had said
[1:52:54] and the lord did unto sarah she had
[1:52:56] spoken
[1:52:57] for sarah conceived in barry abram's son
[1:52:59] in his old age at the set time of which
[1:53:01] god had spoken to him
[1:53:02] and abraham called the name of his son
[1:53:04] that was born unto him
[1:53:06] whom sarah bared him isaac and abraham
[1:53:09] circumcised his son isaac being the
[1:53:11] eight days old as god had commanded him
[1:53:14] and abraham was a hundred years old when
[1:53:16] his son isaac was born unto him
[1:53:18] and sarah said god hath made me to laugh
[1:53:21] so that all that hear me
[1:53:23] will laugh with me she said who would
[1:53:26] have said that abraham
[1:53:27] unto abraham that sarah should have
[1:53:29] given children suck
[1:53:30] for i borne him a son in his old age
[1:53:34] and the child grew and was weaned and
[1:53:37] abraham made a great feast the same day
[1:53:39] that isaac was weaned
[1:53:41] i want you to pay attention here this
[1:53:43] word that's now coming from sarah
[1:53:45] is coming into maturity and as this
[1:53:49] word that's coming through sarah is
[1:53:50] coming into maturity
[1:53:52] it's going to come into conflict again
[1:53:57] and the child grew and was weaned and
[1:53:58] abraham made a great feast the same day
[1:54:00] that isaac was weaned
[1:54:02] and sarah saw the son of hagar the
[1:54:04] egyptian
[1:54:05] which she had born unto abraham mocking
[1:54:09] they're mocking friends the mocking is
[1:54:12] going on
[1:54:14] rest assured ishmael is mocking
[1:54:19] the sons of the bondwoman are mocking
[1:54:23] wherefore she said unto abraham cast out
[1:54:25] this bondwoman
[1:54:26] and her son for the son of this
[1:54:28] bondwoman shall not be heir with my son
[1:54:31] even with isaac
[1:54:32] listen this is the final declaration of
[1:54:35] sarah
[1:54:36] what is it she says she says unto abram
[1:54:39] cast
[1:54:40] out this bondwoman cast out this
[1:54:42] denominational system
[1:54:44] cast out this false birth cast out all
[1:54:47] this wrong
[1:54:48] cast it out for this will not be heir
[1:54:50] with what's come from me
[1:54:52] this will not be aired with what's been
[1:54:54] produced by that private meeting with
[1:54:55] god himself when he came to me and i
[1:54:57] conceived and brought forth the word
[1:54:59] this has no part with that that has no
[1:55:01] part with this it's time
[1:55:03] for a separation sarah had got to the
[1:55:07] place
[1:55:07] when the word was coming to maturity she
[1:55:09] saw the mocking and said it's
[1:55:11] no more this is not going to happen
[1:55:16] anymore
[1:55:18] fault was it there was an ishmael
[1:55:22] sarah's fault
[1:55:25] whose fault was it there was an ishmael
[1:55:28] it was sarah's fault it was sarah's
[1:55:30] reasoning
[1:55:30] it was sarah's program it was sarah's
[1:55:32] handmade and sarah presented the
[1:55:34] handmaid
[1:55:36] but after she kept walking with god all
[1:55:38] of a sudden god began to reveal himself
[1:55:40] and reveal himself and reveal himself
[1:55:42] and he come on the plains of memory and
[1:55:43] show the sign of messiah he brought her
[1:55:45] back to the original doctrine
[1:55:47] and now he come himself to her
[1:55:49] [Music]
[1:55:50] and now she becomes so one with the word
[1:55:53] that the word
[1:55:54] is she's impregnated with the very
[1:55:56] promised word and that promised word
[1:55:57] becomes
[1:55:58] it comes forth from her and comes into
[1:56:00] maturity and now it's time that sarah
[1:56:02] says

[1:56:22] spirit of god and god has visited me

[1:58:09] see how perfect your word is
[1:58:10] how perfect your plan is how absolutely
[1:58:13] sure it is
[1:58:14] and now you've brought me this far i can
[1:58:16] say of my own lips

[1:58:21] cast out the false cast out the hybrid
[1:58:25] amen
[1:58:29] it was her fault sure whose fault is it
[1:58:32] the churches
[1:58:34] but who's he going to use to bring for
[1:58:36] the son his bride
[1:58:37] [Music]
[1:58:39] we may have failed a dozen times but it
[1:58:41] doesn't change who you are
[1:58:44] may have had wrong ideas and wrong
[1:58:46] efforts and trials and failures and all
[1:58:48] kinds of attempts that fall into ruin
[1:58:50] but it doesn't change you're part of
[1:58:51] abraham you're part of christ
[1:58:54] this promise has to come through the
[1:58:56] predestinated chosen one
[1:58:59] no matter what sarah has done she was
[1:59:01] the predestinated chosen one
[1:59:03] she's the one that had to come through
[1:59:08] that's why god came down
[1:59:12] was to discern her
[1:59:14] [Music]
[1:59:15] so when the discernment happened to her
[1:59:18] she would say that's god it's got to be
[1:59:21] true
[1:59:23] god has come down and discerned you and
[1:59:25] discerned i with this word
[1:59:27] so you would know it's not a man it's
[1:59:29] gone that wasn't brother brenham that
[1:59:31] was god he was discerning everything
[1:59:33] that was in my heart
[1:59:37] bring me back lord to that useful
[1:59:40] position back to the church of pentecost
[1:59:44] don't let me stay there
[1:59:47] but bring to me strength for conception
[1:59:51] how will that strength come by a private
[1:59:53] visitation from god
[1:59:56] when he's revealed personally to you
[2:00:01] when he reveals personally nobody else
[2:00:04] may know about it
[2:00:05] nobody else experienced what you
[2:00:06] experienced no nobody else was there
[2:00:08] nobody else saw nobody else could prove
[2:00:10] it
[2:00:13] how could sarah prove it it was going to
[2:00:14] take a few months
[2:00:17] but what had happened to her changed her
[2:00:20] life
[2:00:21] and it became more evident as time came
[2:00:23] what went on that something happened to
[2:00:25] her there
[2:00:28] as the word began to grow inside of her
[2:00:34] i want to keep looking at this scripture
[2:00:35] just for another minute
[2:00:39] she said unto abram cast out the
[2:00:40] bondwoman and her son for the son of
[2:00:42] this bondwoman shall not be
[2:00:43] heir with my son even with isaac
[2:00:47] and the thing was grievous unto
[2:00:49] abraham's sight because of his son
[2:00:52] and god said unto abraham let it not be
[2:00:54] grievous in thy sight because of the lad
[2:00:56] and because of the bondwoman
[2:00:58] and all that sarah hath said and all
[2:01:01] that sarah hath said
[2:01:03] he's saying sarah is giving you the word
[2:01:08] and all that sarah has said unto thee
[2:01:11] hearken unto her voice
[2:01:13] now the voice is in sarah now sarah
[2:01:17] has the word now sarah has the voice
[2:01:23] even abraham's it's grievous i don't
[2:01:25] know but god is saying
[2:01:26] you listen to sarah and you hearken unto
[2:01:29] her voice
[2:01:30] for the things she says is right
[2:01:34] why because when you come into that
[2:01:36] personal meeting
[2:01:37] in the in the little room under the
[2:01:39] third pole the opening of the seventh
[2:01:41] seal to you personally
[2:01:42] he comes and injects another life in
[2:01:44] there
[2:01:45] gives you strength to conceive on this
[2:01:47] promised word and it begins to change
[2:01:49] the way you think
[2:01:50] it begins to change the way you talk
[2:01:52] amen it changed everything about sarah
[2:01:56] until now after this time
[2:02:00] now the voice is in sarah
[2:02:04] amen
[2:02:08] amen amen amen amen
[2:02:12] hearken unto her voice for an isaac
[2:02:15] shall thy seed

[2:02:54] the say with me scripture

[2:03:03] for the son of the bondwoman should not
[2:03:05] be heir with the son of
[2:03:06] who said this scripture
[2:03:10] who gave the word of god that would be
[2:03:12] called the scripture it came from the
[2:03:14] voice of a woman
[2:03:16] it came from sarah the voice was in
[2:03:18] sarah amen and it became
[2:03:20] the word of god it was the scripture

[2:03:39] out the bondwoman and her son for he
[2:03:42] shall not be heir with my son
[2:03:43] and god said listen to her but paul
[2:03:45] picks it up and says what saith the
[2:03:47] scriptures
[2:03:50] he didn't say what saith
[2:03:54] sarah
[2:03:56] because what sarah said was the word of
[2:03:59] god

[2:04:44] mouthpiece in this day
[2:04:46] it's not the churches but it's the bride
[2:04:51] and what she's saying will have been
[2:04:53] said before in the word
[2:04:55] she cannot add to it she cannot take
[2:04:57] from it
[2:04:59] she can't come up with anything new she
[2:05:01] can't just say words
[2:05:04] but she's been given the word by a
[2:05:07] prophet
[2:05:07] now the word has been burst inside of
[2:05:10] her now she's bringing forth the
[2:05:12] promised word for this day
[2:05:15] and now she's become under her messenger
[2:05:18] the final voice to the final age
[2:05:23] and what is she saying come that's it
[2:05:27] prophet got to the laodicean church age
[2:05:28] and he said in church book

[2:05:42] what is she saying cast out the
[2:05:44] bondwoman

[2:05:47] voice that she has in this end time
[2:05:49] she's saying come come out from her come
[2:05:52] away
[2:05:53] come out from the the the and the
[2:05:56] harlots come out from the systems of man
[2:05:58] come out from all the hybridization come

[2:06:06] that's the final call that's going on
[2:06:09] the earth today
[2:06:11] his voice will be in his bride
[2:06:16] what they will be saying will have
[2:06:17] already been said in the word and that
[2:06:19] is
[2:06:19] come out from among her my people and be
[2:06:22] separate now
[2:06:27] she's saying come
[2:06:30] and the spirit and the bride
[2:06:33] says come amen separate
[2:06:37] leave hagar let hagar go
[2:06:40] come it's time for the bride to say god
[2:06:46] cast out this bond woman
[2:06:50] cast out the bondwoman thinking in my
[2:06:52] mind
[2:06:53] whatever caused me to think that was a
[2:06:55] good idea cast it out
[2:06:57] the thing that it's produced cast it out
[2:07:01] whatever caused me to think that this is
[2:07:02] the right way to serve you
[2:07:04] cast it out cast it away because now
[2:07:06] i've got something that's real
[2:07:08] i've got the genuine i don't need that
[2:07:11] hybrid i don't
[2:07:12] need that partial anymore
[2:07:16] it's time to say cast it out cast it
[2:07:19] away from me god cast it out of my mind
[2:07:21] cast it out of my life
[2:07:23] cast it all away from me lord all of my
[2:07:26] plans and all of my ideas and everything
[2:07:28] i thought i was serving you i thought it
[2:07:30] was right cast it out
[2:07:33] for now under the seventh seal i know
[2:07:35] what you've been trying to get me to
[2:07:36] believe all along
[2:07:38] i know what you've been trying to get me
[2:07:40] to do and trying to get me to say all
[2:07:42] along and i've come to that
[2:07:43] and now that's maturing and cast it all
[2:07:46] out
[2:07:48] because it only mocked the true word
[2:07:51] your hybrid spirit will only mock the
[2:07:53] true word
[2:07:55] your thinking will only mock the true
[2:07:56] word i say cast it out
[2:07:58] let the mind of christ be in us cast it
[2:08:01] all out
[2:08:03] and then say to everybody else come
[2:08:09] in the beginning the devil had to get a
[2:08:12] tool to work through
[2:08:14] so the devil got the tool that god was
[2:08:16] going to use
[2:08:17] and that was the woman in the garden of
[2:08:20] eden
[2:08:21] god he wanted to produce amen his seed
[2:08:24] his predestination seed upon the earth
[2:08:26] he wanted
[2:08:27] he saw that he foresaw and he wanted it
[2:08:30] so god had made a tool and that tool was
[2:08:33] the woman
[2:08:36] and the devil got in and used that same
[2:08:38] tool and corrupted the tool and used it
[2:08:39] for his purposes
[2:08:42] god had a tool to bring forth the
[2:08:45] promise to abraham and that tool was
[2:08:47] sarah
[2:08:49] and the devil got in and used sarah as a
[2:08:51] tool to bring a hybrid product
[2:08:54] but we saw god himself come down to
[2:08:56] bring it back
[2:09:00] in the beginning of the church age
[2:09:01] before the church they just started in
[2:09:03] pentecost
[2:09:05] at the feast of pentecost when the
[2:09:06] church was birthed it was birthed to be
[2:09:08] a bride
[2:09:09] it was birthed to be a tool that god
[2:09:11] would use to reproduce christ upon the
[2:09:13] earth
[2:09:14] and the devil got in and started to use
[2:09:16] that tool
[2:09:19] but we saw that god come down himself
[2:09:22] god come down himself amen to break all
[2:09:26] of the efforts of the devil away
[2:09:27] break the deception away to bring her
[2:09:29] back to what she was intended to be amen
[2:09:31] then
[2:09:32] he so wanted his plan to be fulfilled
[2:09:35] that he made a way where he would come
[2:09:37] his very self privately to you
[2:09:39] [Music]
[2:09:44] in producing you his own life
[2:09:49] and bringing you the prophesied word for
[2:09:52] this day
[2:09:54] he himself even when amen even when we
[2:09:57] were brought back amen through this
[2:09:59] ministry of malachi 4 brought back
[2:10:01] amen and all the abimelech tried to do
[2:10:03] their little things god come down
[2:10:04] himself and stopped it
[2:10:08] because he had a purpose and he had a
[2:10:10] tool
[2:10:11] and he wanted to use that tool to finish
[2:10:13] his purpose and the devil kept grabbing
[2:10:15] hold of that tool and grabbing a hold of
[2:10:16] a tool and grabbing a hold of that tool
[2:10:19] but in the end time he come down
[2:10:24] and he put the tool back in his own hand
[2:10:30] amen now he's going to finish his work
[2:10:34] that he didn't finish all in the days of
[2:10:35] jesus christ he left some now to do in
[2:10:37] and through the bride
[2:10:40] and now that tool's come back into his
[2:10:42] hand by her own free choice
[2:10:44] by her surrender to his will and casting
[2:10:47] down of everything that's contrary to it
[2:10:50] and that tool what the devil used to
[2:10:52] pervert and corrupt
[2:10:53] god is now going to take that same tool
[2:10:55] to woman
[2:10:57] and he's going to bring a restoration
[2:10:59] and a redemption
[2:11:01] what the devil used the woman to bring
[2:11:02] death god is now going to use the
[2:11:04] restored woman to bring back
[2:11:05] life and restore back all that's been
[2:11:08] lost
[2:11:10] and god wants to do it through you
[2:11:15] but i can't do it sarah couldn't do it
[2:11:17] first church couldn't do it
[2:11:19] and we can't do it what could mary do
[2:11:23] nothing what ability does she have none
[2:11:28] but when the angel came to her
[2:11:31] and began to explain her mysterious and
[2:11:33] misunderstood life
[2:11:36] her place in the scriptures and what she
[2:11:38] was called for
[2:11:41] she tried to reason but he overrode her
[2:11:44] reasoning with the word
[2:11:47] and when she overrode her reasoning with
[2:11:48] the word something inside of her
[2:11:51] connected
[2:11:52] with that word and she just simply said
[2:11:55] be it unto me
[2:11:58] god is restoring that tool back into his
[2:12:01] hand the one the devil used for
[2:12:02] perversion
[2:12:03] the one the devil used for corruption
[2:12:04] the one the devil used to bring
[2:12:06] death god is restoring that word to
[2:12:08] bring back the true word amen to bring
[2:12:10] back the real life amen and to bring
[2:12:12] back the life
[2:12:15] and all he's asking us to do is say be
[2:12:18] it unto me
[2:12:20] according to your word
[2:12:23] it's a word that he confirms and he
[2:12:27] produces
[2:12:28] himself abraham couldn't do anything
[2:12:32] what could abraham do to bring the
[2:12:33] promise
[2:12:34] nothing every effort fell in ruin
[2:12:38] what could sarah do nothing they
[2:12:39] couldn't do anything all they could do
[2:12:41] was believe in their belief in god the
[2:12:43] word he gave him for that day was
[2:12:44] accounted them for righteousness
[2:12:46] and when it came time god himself would
[2:12:48] come down and do the work
[2:12:50] well i'm telling you it's come time god
[2:12:53] himself has come down to do the work
[2:12:56] he has come down to confirm the promise
[2:12:58] he has come down to give the sign of the
[2:13:00] messiah
[2:13:00] he has come down to meet with sarah
[2:13:03] individually so she can conceive on this
[2:13:05] word
[2:13:05] and now it's time for sarah to say
[2:13:08] separate
[2:13:10] and cast out the bomb
[2:13:13] i don't know about you but i'm feeling
[2:13:14] it stronger than i've ever felt in my
[2:13:16] life
[2:13:16] saying god cast out this bond woman god
[2:13:19] cast out this wrong thing
[2:13:21] cast it away from me god it can't be air
[2:13:24] with what's inside of me
[2:13:26] this thinking can't be air with what's
[2:13:28] inside of me these feelings can't be
[2:13:30] heir with what's inside of me cast it
[2:13:32] out oh god
[2:13:34] let this word have preeminence let this
[2:13:37] word take position
[2:13:38] let this word be the only air
[2:13:42] let everything else be cast to the side
[2:13:45] that's the hour we live in friends
[2:13:46] that's the cry of sarah that's our cry
[2:13:51] and we invite anyone else to come
[2:13:54] leave the bondwoman system leave all the
[2:13:58] denominations and ideas of man
[2:14:00] perversion and corruption and adaptation
[2:14:02] to the lord
[2:14:02] bring it all back to the original
[2:14:05] there's a fountain here
[2:14:07] flowing with clean pure water come and
[2:14:10] drink
[2:14:13] abraham was a prophet
[2:14:19] so what would sarah be she's whatever he
[2:14:22] is
[2:14:23] so when sarah spoke sarah said a lot of
[2:14:27] things
[2:14:28] that weren't called scripture

[2:14:35] god said you listened to her
[2:14:38] there's a lot of things we said that's
[2:14:39] not right but
[2:14:41] god is still going to use this bride to
[2:14:43] speak the true word
[2:14:45] that's been given through a prophet
[2:14:47] she's going to take what's been given
[2:14:49] and she's going to continue to give it
[2:14:51] out
[2:14:53] and god is going to back up what she
[2:14:55] says

[2:16:40] lord jesus we thank you
[2:16:44] god you have done what we could not do
[2:16:46] ourselves
[2:16:48] any more than barry could have conceived
[2:16:51] on our own
[2:16:53] any more than sarah and abraham and
[2:16:54] their condition could have brought forth
[2:16:56] the promised son
[2:16:58] there was nothing they could do there
[2:17:01] was
[2:17:01] nothing that mary could do and there's
[2:17:05] nothing that we in ourselves can do
[2:17:09] but god at the right time when it was
[2:17:12] time you sent an angel to mary
[2:17:17] and when it was time you sent an angel
[2:17:20] messenger to us
[2:17:22] to declare to us that it was time
[2:17:25] and that we were the one oh god give us
[2:17:28] the faith that mary had
[2:17:31] to throw everything else away all her
[2:17:33] plans her
[2:17:34] fears the consequences lord in a moment
[2:17:38] she cast it all to the side and she took
[2:17:42] what you offered to her her position in
[2:17:45] the word
[2:17:46] and she said be it unto me according to
[2:17:49] your word
[2:17:51] god we want to say the same thing lord
[2:17:53] let me not reason or think god
[2:17:55] let me not scheme or plan but let me
[2:17:57] throw it all away and just simply say
[2:18:00] i believe it lord i receive your plan
[2:18:04] for me

[2:18:18] lord by faith in the word you've brought
[2:18:21] us back to a virgin womb
[2:18:24] so that you can bring forth your seed
[2:18:27] god let us stay under the washing of the
[2:18:29] water the word that cleanses and
[2:18:30] purifies

[2:18:34] the little room not met you personally
[2:18:36] not been quickened to life
[2:18:38] by your very presence i pray you'd let
[2:18:42] it take place now
[2:18:43] lord that there'd be no more reasonings
[2:18:47] no more schemings no more plans no more
[2:18:50] trying
[2:18:51] to bring the word to pass but may they
[2:18:54] now
[2:18:54] just under the manifestation of this
[2:18:56] word that's being preached in this hour

[2:19:19] you turn your back to the crowd
[2:19:21] it gave me strength lord to go back to
[2:19:25] the faith of the fathers
[2:19:28] god bring a personal
[2:19:31] a personal meeting that you would come
[2:19:35] yourself
[2:19:36] to each individual life

[2:19:47] life
[2:19:49] that it might be now the promised word

[2:20:16] touch each heart in each life
[2:20:19] may your holy ghost lord go and
[2:20:20] interrupt the lives and the thoughts of
[2:20:22] each individual's seed may you go to
[2:20:26] them lord
[2:20:27] you interrupted mary's plans she was
[2:20:31] fine with that
[2:20:33] you interrupted that day when abraham
[2:20:35] was on memory whatever he had planned
[2:20:37] that day you interrupted his plans by a
[2:20:39] meeting
[2:20:41] he was fine with that you come to sarah
[2:20:44] privately
[2:20:45] in genesis 21 and whatever she was doing
[2:20:47] you interrupted it with your presence
[2:20:50] you came to her and she was fine with
[2:20:54] that
[2:20:55] lord i believe this morning you're
[2:20:56] coming to individuals
[2:20:59] by the preaching of the word lord which
[2:21:01] is your method for saving souls
[2:21:03] i pray lord that that word would come
[2:21:05] down now and find a resting place in the
[2:21:07] womb of your seed
[2:21:10] may you interrupt our plans lord and may
[2:21:13] we be so satisfied with that
[2:21:14] interruption
[2:21:16] that we can say be it unto me according
[2:21:19] to this word
[2:21:21] let me bring forth the son of man
[2:21:25] let me be part of this ministry lord
[2:21:28] let me bring forth the word
[2:21:32] cast away all the bond womanness
[2:21:36] thinking and planning and scheming and
[2:21:37] what it's produced cast it out of my
[2:21:39] life
[2:21:41] let me be pure and true to you alone
[2:21:44] oh god thank you for this word help us
[2:21:47] yield in a greater way to you lord take
[2:21:50] us in your hands
[2:21:51] use us for your glory inspire us unto
[2:21:54] this anointing lord to do whatever
[2:21:56] you've called us to do
[2:21:58] to manifest this living word in this
[2:22:00] hour
[2:22:01] for it's our purpose for for it's hinged
[2:22:04] upon this bride in the end time
[2:22:07] being in position you've brought us
[2:22:10] you've cleansed us you've filled us let
[2:22:13] us stay surrendered to you as you finish
[2:22:15] your work in us
[2:22:17] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[2:22:22] god bless
[2:22:37] according to your promises
[2:22:43] i can stand secure
[2:22:48] carve upon my heart
[2:22:53] the truth
[2:22:59] according to your world
[2:23:05] [Music]
[2:23:16] according
[2:23:27] [Music]
[2:23:30] with you
[2:23:32] [Music]
[2:23:45] according to me
[2:24:01] [Music]
[2:24:07] according to your promises
[2:24:23] the truth that sets me free
[2:24:28] [Music]
[2:24:41] amen god bless you saints
[2:24:44] i think i've said before you can't do
[2:24:47] this
[2:24:49] is that true in your own flesh and your
[2:24:52] own human ability
[2:24:53] you can't do it but without you it's not
[2:24:57] getting done
[2:24:59] because there's one predestinated woman
[2:25:01] there's one predestinated seed
[2:25:03] there's one people on the earth that's
[2:25:04] going to fulfill the promise
[2:25:07] and you can't do it on your own but yet
[2:25:10] it's not happening without you
[2:25:14] so the only solution is to say yes to
[2:25:17] the word
[2:25:19] and surrender to it there's no other
[2:25:21] choice there's no other option
[2:25:22] you can't manufacture you can't produce
[2:25:24] it that's what's produced
[2:25:25] every messy situation all around us
[2:25:29] in our lives and and all around what's
[2:25:31] called the message well every mess that
[2:25:33] we've seen
[2:25:34] is because we tried to get to it
[2:25:36] ourselves
[2:25:38] we can't do it the love mess we have in
[2:25:40] our lives is we tried to produce our we
[2:25:42] can't do it
[2:25:45] there's only one thing we can do is say
[2:25:49] god
[2:25:50] [Music]
[2:25:51] i'm here whatever was preached today
[2:25:55] is me there's a witness in me said
[2:25:59] that's
[2:25:59] me that's me mama that mirror i looked
[2:26:02] in today at church it was reflecting
[2:26:04] i am that one not because i deserve it
[2:26:08] not because i've earned it
[2:26:10] not because i feel value but because i
[2:26:12] can't help it i believe it lord
[2:26:15] [Music]
[2:26:19] then just lay your life down to the
[2:26:20] world
[2:26:22] whatever else we're holding on to
[2:26:24] whatever else is distracting and
[2:26:26] complicating
[2:26:28] let's just throw it down just throw it
