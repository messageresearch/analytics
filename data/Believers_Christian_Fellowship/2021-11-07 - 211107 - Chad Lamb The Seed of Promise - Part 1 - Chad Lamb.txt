amen god bless you this morning let's bow our heads and pray together lord jesus we thank you father for the privilege of once again gathering lord and we thank you that you've been so good to us to watch over us and take care of us and protect us and bring us back to this time of fellowship again where we can bind ourselves together to worship you in spirit and in truth and to hear your word i pray god as we come to this time in the service where we open and lord your word and we read from it god we're asking that you would do the supernatural part lord we can turn pages and we could read but god we need you to come and bring divine revelation upon your word we need you to give us the eye sabb to see and give us ears to hear may we have a heart to receive and perceive all that you have for us lord may this word become flesh in our lives for that is the manifestation of this hour god i pray you would have your way take preeminence among us and find welcome among us may we receive you lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you while you're standing if we could take our bibles and turn to the book of galatian chapter 4 amen and welcome back brother john kadeem it's good to have you back he was gone last sunday preaching over in pennsylvania so i'm glad you're here brother amen also want to remind you there's communion service this afternoon so we'll make an announcement about that at the end of service again but today will be our communion service amen let's read galatians chapter 4 verse 28 now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise that's all i want to read you can have your seeds amen god bless you we now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise what a wonderful scripture amen if we can catch the full reality of that this morning i'd like to minister on a subject called the seat of promise and and what i'd like to do is take some time and i'm going to force myself i've talked myself into going slow and i hope that i can keep myself talked into going slow and i want to go through several scriptures because there's so many things that we talk about that the prophet of god brought to us in understanding and so much terminology we use in quotes that we use amen it's become such second nature to us it is something that's so commonly understood among us but we don't realize how foreign that is or maybe we've forgotten how foreign it is to the rest of the world to everybody else in the denominational understanding these concepts are so far removed and so foreign amen but we want to just by the grace of god look into the scripture and see what a solid foundation brother branham has for making the comments that he has and i want to go back and take my time and go through that because there's some things that i really in my heart want to get to and i don't know if i'll do it today or wednesday or next sunday but there's a certain direction that i the lord has me going in and i want to lay this solid foundation and realize that for some this will be review but always in review they're always digging up new gold nuggets amen and we always have new ones coming up and youth coming up to a greater level of understanding and new ones that have come in and visitors so i want to take my time this morning and maybe like a bible study and i've said that before and end up preaching and i thought i'll come out and preach and do a bible study so i really can't predict anything i just got some things in my heart i want to share so god bless you however you pull is probably what we'll get amen but praise god i want to look at this seed of promise and what paul says here is out it's outstanding it's a it's an outstanding statement if god could give us the revelation of what this really means and what all's included in this so now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise that means we are the children of promise amen and so when god was speaking to abraham he was giving abraham a promise that he was going to have a seed amen and we know we're going to get into this in the scriptures that that seed was speaking of christ amen and now paul and and the promises the blessings and the promises that are given to abraham also apply to abraham's seed and so what god speaks to abraham in the way of a promise and in the way of a blessing amen that promise and that blessing passes right onto the seed so now when he says we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise now what he's doing is he's linking us all the way back to abraham abraham standing in the presence of god and god giving promises and blessings to abraham and now those promises and blessings to abraham apply to abraham's seed and now paul comes in the new testament and say we like isaac are the children of promise and now you can say all that was given to abraham all that was promised to abraham and all the blessing on abraham is mine too see it it is it is it's fundamental amen that we can understand this and it's it's interesting how the apostle paul can come along and he can pull this out of the old testament because it seems so uh if you were alive in the day of the apostle paul and you were raised in the jewish tradition of understanding your bible when the apostle paul begins to preach in the book of romans in the book of galatians amen there you there's no way amen that you with a traditional understanding and no seed of god there's no way you could accept what paul's preaching and i'm going to get into that and read the scriptures and start to show that paul was absolutely revolutionary in the way that he took the old testament and brought it into the present day and it was so contrary to carnal understanding so contrary to any reasonable thought there's no way that he could go read that amen and pull it in and apply it the way he does unless god himself gave him the revelation of that word let's go to romans 4 and begin to look at that i've got some long scripture readings and i hope long scripture readings don't bore you but they excite me it just amen it just takes eyes to see and it takes a word of revelation to see what god has written here and then it becomes so exciting uh romans romans chapter four and we'll start at verse one what shall we say then that abraham our father is pertaining to the flesh hath found for if abraham were justified by works he hath aware of to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness that word counted is the same word that's interpreted imputed later so the word to impute or to count means to account somebody as having or lay it to their account or to to recognize it as uh in their account or accounted to them or this is where they're at okay so for for what say the scriptures abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness so it was in his account it was reckoned it was imputed it was it was reason that that he was righteous why because he could believe god amen and i love the way it's written for what saith the scriptures abraham believed god it did not say he believed in god because in abraham's day everybody believed in god amen so it wasn't that he believed in god but that wasn't counted to him for righteousness even more than believing in god is accounted today for righteousness because there's there's like i said millions billions of people who believe in god but how many people believe god amen to believe god a minister receive his word amen to receive his word is to receive the word that applies to your day that is to believe god for what say the scriptures abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt so he's going back to the law and he's talking to a people that are breaking free from the law and coming into into grace and he's saying what let's look at abraham and he says now abraham when he believed god it was counted unto him for righteousness it wasn't based off his works because if it was just that he got the deeds right amen then god would owe him but it was by grace not of debt god didn't owe abraham anything god gave by grace to abraham his favor amen because why because abraham had the ability to believe god and when he expressed the ability to believe god he showed that he was already in grace so because if it was reckoned not of grace but of debt then if you could do everything right which the law proved no man could do everything right but if you could somehow do everything right then god would owe you something but god owes no man anything verse 5 but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as david also described the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputed righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin now listen this is interesting the way he says that because if you go back to verse 6 it says even as david also described the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works and and when you go back you can't find david saying that god imputed righteousness without works but what he does say is blessed is the man who god will not impute because we were all born sinners amen we're all born wrong amen we're all born in this in this world of hybridization thinking wrong believing wrong but god there are some that god will not impute their sin amen if he will not impute sin unto you it's the same as imputing righteousness unto you blessed is the man whom the lord will not impute sin come with this blessedness then upon the circumcision only now when he says circumcision or uncircumcision he's talking jew and gentile these are generic terms for jew and gentile so this blessedness then cometh the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision so he believed god before he received the the commandment for circumcision so when he was yet uncircumcised and remember abraham was chosen by god and abraham there was no jews as of yet that term jew came later to the family of abraham after abraham so this abraham was just like everybody else he was in the same mix of humanity as every other person was in the mix of humanity amen it was not yet divided into jew or gentile everybody was just mankind and in this mankind amen god comes down and by his own sovereignty he selects one man now remember amen we by faith amen are seed of abraham amen so what what god does with abraham he does with the seed and what god promises to abraham he promises to the seed so now when god is going to come down and call abraham amen in in the commonality of mankind he goes and finds one amen not because he was better not because of his works not because anything that abraham had done amen brother benham said his daddy was an idol maker he come his daddy brought him down amen from the into uh amen from babylon amen when god broke up babel the tower of babel amen his daddy come down from that and brought brought abraham down from that so he was stuck in that idolatry and that false religion of the day of the thing that god had to come down and destroy so abraham and his family was caught up in this and so god did not select abraham by any of abraham's merit he selected abraham by his own predestinated determined counsel and so he chose one man amen we're going to spend a lot of time talking about abraham because paul tells us that we are the children of promise he's going to tell us that we're abraham's children and so then this is the start of the family i would say of abraham not carnal but abraham spiritual so there's a carnal family of abraham and remember you can't just look at the family of abraham and say the seed of abraham children of abraham because really in the seed of abraham and carnally you've got isaac in his lineage but you also have ishmael in his lineage and you also have other sons that were born to him to a second wife and they are a car carnal natural seed of abraham that's why the natural lineage will not work there must be a spiritual lineage coming down a lineage of faith a spiritual line coming from abraham that all of these promises apply to amen now that does not mean i'm not not in any way saying that there's not still an application for the seed through isaac through the natural seed of abraham through isaac and that lineage which became the jews amen which were the chosen people of god there's still a blessing there there's still work there there's still promises that god has applied there but i'm taking what paul did taking the spiritual side and the spiritual lineage and it goes on to say um verse 10 how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision and uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision so god calls a common man by his own uh foreknowledge he calls him by his own choosing and this man he has the capacity to believe god but in his capacity to believe god amen he does not yet have the capacity to fully obey god because he only partially obeyed he was told to leave his family leave his land and go to a land where he told him but he didn't leave you know he went with his father up to haran and took lot and then when his father passed away then he went over to the land and he took lot he was supposed to separate from his family so he had the capacity to believe god even yet he was not fully obedient but his faith was counted to him for righteousness not his works praise be to god now we know abraham will grow into perfect obedience but god had already imputed righteousness unto him before he had grown into full obedience as abraham matures in his walk with god he grows into full obedience and gives god preeminence but god had already imputed righteousness unto him and already sealed it with a sign of circumcision before he had grown into perfect obedience oh i'm telling you it's good to be in this lineage this is the right family tree amen so not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also so abraham he he he received the truth and righteousness was imputed unto him amen before he received the seal of circumcision so that he could be the father of all that believe so if you can believe god abraham is your father if you just believe in god the demons do that also amen all right let's keep going verse 12 and the father of circumcision the father the jews to them who are not who who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised and what he's saying here he is the father of all he's the father of on the uncircumcised who can believe he's also the father of the circumcised who can go on in faith and believe who are not just stuck in circumcision only but can move on with faith so he's the father of faith whether circumcised or uncircumcised whether jew or gentile he's the father of faith for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith verse 13 i am included in verse 13. for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith so that means i am part of abraham's seed by faith not by law not by works but by faith i'm part of that seed if i'm part of the seed then i am heir of the world amen that's why i have a right to sit on the throne with christ amen and be a amen be in joint rulership with him through the millennium be a joint heir with christ why because i am of the seed of abraham amen by faith amen in righteousness through faith and praise god this promise is to me for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham but to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of non-effect because the law worketh wrath for theirs whereas no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickened the dead and called those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so so shall thy seed be so so shall thy seed be it'll be coming through many nations but it's not a natural lineage it's a spiritual lineage it's a lineage of faith and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification so praise god revelation or romans chapter 4 is telling us if you can believe like abraham believed that you can you can have the promise that abraham had amen you can have the imputation of righteousness you can become heir to the world the blessing and the promise if you can have the faith that abraham had then abraham is your father and you're one of the children of abraham by faith you're part of that lineage of abraham and the the promise was to the seed and you're part of that seed and now you're part of every promise that was to abraham if you can believe the way abraham believed let's go to john chapter 8. let's go to 8 31. then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how sayest thou you shall be made free jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed i know that you're abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you i speak that which i have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father they answered and said unto him abraham is our father jesus saith unto them if you were abraham's children you would do the works of abraham now jesus is having a conversation here with the jews amen and and they're claiming abraham as their father and and jesus says i know that you are abraham's seed jesus is speaking naturally i know that you're abraham's seed but if abraham were your father [Laughter] amen what a confusing conversation amen i know that you're abraham's seed but if abraham were your father amen praise be to god i know that you're naturally that you can trace your lineage back to abraham i understand that that you're a natural seed of abraham amen but you seek to kill me this did not abraham do amen it's because my word has no place in you so abraham is not your father amen see when when they can no longer go on in faith they become a natural seed of abraham amen and like i said there was other natural seeds of abraham but what what was important to retain retain the promise amen was to stay the faith seed of abraham yeah i said i speak that which i've seen in my father you do that which you have seen with your father and they answered and said unto him abraham is our father jesus saith unto him if you were abraham's children you would do the works of abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that had told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham and then why didn't abraham do that you have to think he's not saying amen you're seeking to kill me abraham didn't kill people because abraham did kill people when he delivered lot he's not saying because of because you're going to fight me because you're going to kill me you're not abraham's seed he goes i have told you the truth amen and i have told you the truth abraham didn't do this because abraham believed god so now he's saying but now you seek to kill me amen that have told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham basically jesus said i am telling you the truth from god abraham would never reject this amen because abraham believed god and when abraham believed it was imputed unto him for righteousness and if abraham you were your father you would receive me amen because i come with the word of god i am the word of god and abraham would never reject the word of god in his day so now they have no imputation of righteousness amen they have put themselves out from under that blessing because they are rejecting the word of god and jesus can clearly identify that abraham is not your father amen so he could identify the lineage not by physical characteristics but by spiritual response to the word the way they responded to the word and listen these were these were men and men and women who were responding to the word every day of their life because they had the commandments from moses they had the law they had the orders that were given they had the book of ordinances in every day of their life they were keeping the ordinances out of the book their whole life was structured around the word of god and they had received that word and they were walking in that word they were obeying that word amen but and they thought by keeping that word they were coming down the right lineage moses gave the word we come from abraham everything is established amen but when they rejected the word for their day it to jesus to jesus it no longer mattered how many ordinances they were keeping from the previous dispensation they could keep all of the ordinances but when they rejected the present tense word of god god said abraham is not your father amen oh praise god this is why the the the jews are having such dispute with jesus and his disciples amen because they have so ordered their life around what they thought the word was and what they thought it meant to be a child of abraham and what they thought it meant to be a chosen nation amen they they had gotten the details in the order to the ordinances and they had whole they had so fixed their life to match every ordinance but then when they saw jesus disciples and men walking through a field and plucking corn amen and eating it on the sabbath day they couldn't even imagine that this would have anything to do with god and then when they saw they ate with unwashed hands which was not part of the law which was not the word of god but it was added to by rabbis and teachers and priests but they had so gotten locked into the order to the church order that it all equaled salvation to them and all equaled amen being a seed of abraham and all equaled being under the promise so when they saw jesus disciples amen not towing up to the order they said there's something wrong with this this doesn't work how come they eat on the sabbath and jesus jesus never he never even addressed them eating on the sabbath he says didn't you read the bible when david walked in and took the show bread it was only for priests and gave those to the soldiers that were with him and they were like i'm sure i'm sure they were going but they're still eating on the sabbath and then he says the sabbath wasn't given the the man was not given to the sabbath but the sabbath was given to man it takes them all the way back to the principle in the mind of god that laid down the word to begin with but they wanted to hold to the concrete word and they missed the present tense word which was the reality and jesus could so clearly identify their father and their lineage on the spiritual side by how they responded to the word in their day let's read that again in verse 39 they answered and said unto him abraham as our father jesus said that him if you were abraham's children you would do the works of abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham you do the deeds of your father jesus just took it one step farther now jesus now i really i'm still talking about the book of life i thought that wednesday i was done but god let me know that i wasn't done but now jesus is saying you're of your father why did he say you're of your father because they were fighting the word for their day they were trying to destroy the vessel that contained the word that was trying to destroy the word made flesh in their day they were trying to shut it down keep it from speaking keep it from the people they were directly fighting against the word for their day and he could say no you're not of abraham abraham's not your father but you're of your father and they they instantly knew what this meant because the response is then said unto him we be not born to fornication we have one father even god we're not we we didn't come from that cain line we know what you're saying we're not born of fornication amen we have we have one father even god how can they say god was their father because if they come down from adam the the adam was a son of god so if you come all the way down then god is your father but they said we'd be not born a fornication we're not from that cane line they knew exactly what he was pointing to and jesus was not pointing to dna he was not looking at their dna he was not looking at the family tree amen he was looking at that spiritual line that line of life that bloodline that was coming all the way down through and that bloodline was the life of the word and that life of the word was coming down with the word amen stage by stage day by day age by age until finally that lifeline had come and all of it was now contained in this vessel here all of the word was standing there speaking to him the word that he had got from the father so it was the god it was god's word speaking through his mouth and when they fought against that he knew who their father was now jesus never said this to the people who didn't understand didn't get it didn't hear it he was not saying this to the ones who sat in the meetings and it went over their head he was saying this to the ones who were directly opposed to the word and fighting the word not the ones who didn't comprehend it who never came in contact with it never made a decision about it he wasn't talking to them he was talking to the ones who fought it and he says you're of your father let's go on verse 42 jesus said unto them if god were your father you would love me how many people let's put it this way how many millions of people on the earth on a sunday morning will say i love jesus i love jesus and and and what they're envisioning is is the jesus christ 2 000 years ago who died in their place and they loved that jesus but i'm telling you jesus christ is here today that word that was in him is here today amen and to love him is to love the manifestation of the word for your day jesus was the word made flesh in their day and he says listen i'll just read it again he said if god were your father you would love me amen if god were your father you would love me not fight me and not be indifferent about me like there's three ways to respond either to love him to fight against him or to have never heard about it or have no opinion either way and not know amen jesus was invited to simon's house simon didn't love him but the harlot woman who come and wash his feet she loved him showing that simon had a different father than this harlot woman had the high priest wanted to kill him but the samaritan woman recognized him as messiah proving her father was gone and she was of abraham c oh but she was a samaritan how but she was of abraham's seed and the high priest was of his father the devil amen it's never what it appears to be that's why when we really get to what the message has done for us friends is so remarkable that when the when the when the message came the seals opened the bible became a new book now you can go back and you can read the book amen and what brother branham has done is he was so good at placing us back in the day and not reading it from a 2000 year previous past history amen where we know everything we know now looking back but going back into that day into that hour and recognizing what jesus was preaching was absolutely turning them upside down it was so contrary to anything they had heard what he was saying to them was blasphemy what he was saying was absolutely wrong and contrary to the bible they were reading they were abraham seed they were the lineage of isaac amen they were part of the 12 sons of jacob and they were reading their bible finding their position naturally amen through all of that and when jesus comes and said if god were your father you would love me amen you do the works of your father he was a liar from the beginning he said if god were your father you would love me abraham were your father amen you would believe me and now they're looking and reading their bible and thinking this man is crazy amen remember this was before the temple was destroyed and before all the records were destroyed they could go back to the temple and trace the family line and leap all the way back and find out their tribal father and their tribal father goes to jacob amen jacob goes to isaac isaac goes to abraham and because they could leaf through parchments and they could find their way back naturally they thought that they were the seed of abraham and jesus comes along and said abraham i know you're the seed of abraham i can live through the same thing in fact i don't even need to leave through it i know it i know you're the seed of abraham but abraham's not your father you have another father and they knew what he was talking about so you see jesus is making a uh jesus is making a declaration of their origin based off their conduct with the living word and really that matches the whole bible that's not just in jesus day like this this message that god has given to us amen it took the seals off and unlocked the entire word the whole bible is unlocked not just this passage or that passage but the whole book is now unlocked amen you know there's there's some churches out there that will only call themselves new testament churches and will only preach the new testament because they believe the old testament for the jews and the new testament and so they'll call themselves a new testament church and they will only read out of the new testament there's whole denominations that will do that but listen my promise amen that you find in the new testament my promise originated in the old testament amen because i'm seed of abraham and the promise to abraham is my promise too and the promise that he'll be heir of the world is my promise as well because i am part of the seed of abraham so i want the whole book amen not just the new testament not just these books not just this section i want the whole thing because i can find my lineage through the entire scripture amen let's keep reading all right verse 42 again jesus said unto them if god were your father you would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word i love this scripture amen jesus was having dialogue back and forth so could they hear him speak yes amen if they had been deaf they would have come to him for prayer and he would have healed them but jesus is speaking on a whole nother level he says he says why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word amen jesus is speaking and he's speaking to them and he's speaking another language although he's probably speaking aramaic and they're understanding aramaic but he's speaking another language because he's speaking a language he got from his father so now he's speaking a heavenly language and he may speak in aramaic speaking hebrew you can speak in greek you can speak it in english you can speak in russian but even today amen christ is here on earth and his bride and she is speaking another language she's speaking a heavenly language and why can't some hear it jesus says you do not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word so god christ is appealing to another set of ears verse 44 you are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there was no truth in him when he speak of the lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it i don't think there's any wiggle room now on who he's talking about and this whole concept that says to be a christian you always have to be really sweet well they were not viewing jesus as sweet and kind right here he was telling them the truth and he was telling in love and man he didn't hate them he was telling them the truth but he was telling them exactly where they are you're of your father the devil how did he come to this understanding based off remember he's going back he's basing the whole thing on the way they react to the word made flesh in their day you have your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do boy he just nails it all down verse 45 and because i tell you the truth you believe me not which if you convince which of you convinces me of sin and if i say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of god heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because you are not of god then answered the jews and said unto him say we not well that thou art samaritan and has a devil what else could they say i mean they answered back and say didn't weren't we right when we said you're a samaritan you have a devil oh my goodness they didn't want to hear that they didn't believe they didn't believe it because of the natural because the natural lineage natural this natural that they couldn't believe it amen but there was people in that day that could receive the word made flesh in their day and when they received that word in their day it declared their origin who their father was who they came up what lineage they're a part of and what promises that they can receive let's go to galatians chapter 3. i love bible studies like this galatians chapter 3. i'm going to start at verse 6. even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness know you therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham all right so where are you at i'm in the bible i'm in chapter 3 verse 7 that's me therefore they that which are the faith the same are the children of abraham and the scripture for seeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed as every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of law to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god it is evident for the just shall live by faith and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith brethren i speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth thereto now that abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not unto seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ oh now brother paul's nailing it down he's zeroing it in he's tightening it up he's saying the promise was not to seeds as of many but the promise was seed as of one amen we can see this even in the natural amen because when when when we know that that abraham first had ishmael but he wasn't the seed of promise isaac was so he had isaac amen and then after sarah dies he marries and he has more children amen but none of that other natural seed is the seed of promise the seed of promise was isaac because isaac was the word amen was isaac the word isaac was the word made flesh because god had told him before you have a son out of your own loins amen from sarah amen that was the child of promise that was the word made flesh when isaac was born so so we see this in the natural amen how even abraham could have many seeds but there was one seed isaac but now paul is bringing it into the spiritual side and he said now abraham and his seed were the promises made so that promise doesn't go to every natural avenue amen of abraham he said now abraham and his seed where the promise is made he saith not unto seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ so what is the seed of abraham christ who are the promises to christ christ is the royal seed christ is the faith see christ is the seed of promise do we agree verse 17 in this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before of god in christ the law which was 430 years after cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but god gave it to abraham by promise so it's it's by promise it's by the word of god it's by the foreknowledge of god because it was given by promise for what comes in the future and that's the foreknowledge of god let's go to verse 26 for year all the children of god by faith in christ jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus and if you be christ then ye are abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise praise be to god if you have put on christ by a new birth if you be christ amen by being born again by the spirit of god then you are abraham's seed and heirs of the promise amen that means everything abraham was promised is promised to me every thing abraham every blessing abraham was under is my blessing too amen so you see how the apostle paul now he comes here and he is absolutely unraveling amen church doctrine he's unraveling church teaching amen and he's bringing uh you know for for thousands of years they've understood this bible a certain way and down through hundreds of years as it unfolded amen but paul comes and he's taught by god himself christ himself is the teacher and christ gives him a revelation and when he looks at that word he's saying now listen that seed you're making a mistake you're thinking that it was it was the dna that went into isaac and the dna from isaac that went into jacob and the d and a from jacob and to the 12 sons he said you're wrong it's not the dna because that seed amen was not dna that seed was christ so what was isaac isaac was christ brother chad how can you say such a thing because brother branham said such a thing that's how i could say it let me find it here i've got to skip down i'm getting all out of whack and the message three kinds of believers from november of 1963 brother bram said he that receiveth my words and believeth on him that sent me has already passed from death to life but can you receive the word first can you receive the word all the word all of christ christ is the anointed word he is the word anointed christ means the anointed one the anointed word for that day made manifest the savior the redeemer i'm going to read that again so we all lock it in christ means the anointed one the anointed word for that day made manifest so what is christ the anointed word for that day made manifest what was isaac isaac was the fulfillment of a promise of god isaac was the fulfillment of the word of god isaac was a prophecy that god had gave a promise that god had gave and when the word of god that went out of a spoken word now come and made manifest and was birthed that was the seed of abraham that was christ the anointed word for that day made manifest amen so isaac was a manifestation of christ it was christ in isaac amen so now it's not the flesh line it's the spiritual line as the words moving down brother branham tells us that the word is spirit because jesus tell us the word that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so the the nothing has life without the spirit the spirit is what gives it life when the spirit goes out of something it's dead so the word the word has in it a spirit there's the word and spirit are the same thing so as the word is moving down through time amen the word the present tense word the word for your day has life in it it is life it is the location of life it is christ so what is christ christ means the anointed when the anointed word for that day made manifest so that's how the promise was given to abraham and how the promise could move right down to the gentiles that have no genetic tie to abraham see what paul is preaching is revolutionary what paul is preaching amen what paul is preaching sounds like blasphemy to their ears because for generations they've been tied into the natural fulfillment they've been locked into isaac's birth record amen the birth record of jacob the birth record of the 12 sons they've been locked into that so long that they missed that that was just the word coming into manifestation in its season they saw birth take place but they didn't realize those births were taking a place according to the foreknowledge of god and as they were coming on the earth and manifesting as jacob's 12 sons come into manifestation amen they were the word of god made manifest in that day so what was it christ in that day amen when moses was born a proper child amen moses came by the foreknowledge of god it was the word of god from the thoughts of god when god knew his word coming down through amen oh praise be the god god wrote his first bible where in the heavens he wrote his second bible in the pyramid and we've got a record of those two in the written word but god was manifesting what was written in the heavens and written the pyramid all down through time what was he doing he was writing in life the manifestation of that word so when moses came forth born a proper child he was christ why was he christ because abraham received the prophecy that after 400 years amen i'll deliver your children out with a mighty hand so that prophecy required a deliverer and the deliverer was already in the mind of god which is where the word of god comes from and when god speaks that word amen that word now now moves down into place when that word comes in manifestation in its day it is christ and it has the life in it that's why to receive that was life and to reject that was death so i got to go way back up here praise god now if you by grace have a faith seed inside the ability to believe your word manifest for your day then it shows that you are christ and if you are a christ you are abraham's seed and heir to all the promises amen so if we can find ourselves in this position by the word amen then there should be nothing that troubles us friend there should be nothing god foresaw this before the foundation of the world his word has been coming down through a line of life a line of the word a bloodline a lifeline you can call it anything you want it's the lamb's book of life being written out in each age in each generation and when you come and you find yourself in that on that line you find yourself by grace placed there by a revelation that god has given you then you're on the lifeline amen you're part of that expression god is expressing the word through you in this day and you are united with christ and you are christ and you are abraham's seed and if god could take care of the lineage all the way down through can he not take care of it now if god has watched over it listen this was in the thinking of god before the foundation of the world god knew who would become and when they would be expressed what age they'd be expressed and what they would accomplish did he know that he knew his seed he knew the christ line he knew the word line he knew it all before the foundation of the world and as it's coming down through amen he's watching over it he's moving it in position he's rearranging the the politics of the entire world he's restructuring everything to keep this moving and if you can find yourself as part of that word then what a consolation it should bring what a peace what a reassurance amen what a satisfaction to know that god has not messed up yet he's not going to mess up now amen let's go to romans chapter 9. i love this word romans chapter 9 verse 6. romans 9 6 not as though the word of god hath taken none effect for they are not all israel which are of israel paul's saying the same thing they may be of israel but they're not israel they may be natural but they're not spiritual neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called this is they which are the children of flesh these are not the children of god but the children of promise are counted for the seed all right paul's saying the same thing it's not the natural lineage that's what he's saying all israel is not israel amen amen it's not it's it's the seed of promise is the seed of abraham what god promised to come when it comes that's the seed of abraham not every seed that's born but the seed of promise that's the seed so if it was promised by the word of god and then it comes in its season in a fulfillment to the will of god and that promise comes into manifestation that's the seed of god and guess what god promised that he'd have a bride without spot or wrinkle in the end time amen that's the promise all of those who are fulfilling that portion of the word are part of christ are part of the seed the one seed the seed line praise be to god let's keep reading now i want to read verse 8 again that is they which are the children of flesh are not the children of god imagine being a jew hearing that that day they are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seed for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and sarah shall have a son and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated oh what a fantastic scripture friends because now he's saying he's saying it's not the natural children amen let's go back to verse 8 they which are the children of the flesh they are not the children of god but the children of promise are counted for the seed so it's not the children of flesh that are the children of god but the children of promise are the ones counted for the seed this is so important because when you get down to isaac amen the promise goes from abraham to isaac isaac was the promised word for that day he was christ he was given a bride that bride come from eliezer eliezer went and fetched the bride amen brought her back she was the word for that day the two coming together was the word for that day the two coming together they came together in a natural union and in the natural union they produced twins oh the apostle paul is so good here he is so good at taking the bible that the jews are reading and prove what he's saying by the bible that they're reading and he goes all the way back to jacob and esau and he says look isaac was the promise rebecca and isaac coming together fulfillment of the promised word they come together amen to produce the produce another seed which was still the promise of the word but they had twins there was two that came out of the same mother the same father if this was natural if these were the natural children of the flesh would be children of god esau would have to be a child of god but esau before the children were born god told rebecca that the younger the the older shall serve the younger god had already given his spoken word and now when it comes out amen esau and jacob they they live their lives they do their things esau's the better man according to the prophet takes better care of his daddy he's a better son jacob says shyster amen he's a surplanter he's always getting in fixes and he cheats his dad cheats his brother runs away comes back amen but he was the seed of promise esau wasn't by the foreknowledge and predestination of god by election where god will make his choice before so it was not based off conduct because it was based off conduct again esau would have been the choice not jacob but god already had a thought before the foundation of the world that jacob have i loved but esau have i hated god already prophesied to rebecca before the children are born the placing of the sons so when jacob although he's not the one that we would have enjoyed being friends with he's not the one we would have picked for the seed he does all kinds of stuff to his family he teaches family what kind of person cheats their family well somebody who has the potential of being a child of god [Laughter] i love the bible friends because it's what what matters more than anything in this world is what god thought before the foundation of the world it is the it is what matters it is the absolute amen it is the foundation it is the seed it is the word it is the life it's everything so now they come from the natural line and the jews are all natural line natural line natural line natural line but now paul takes the bible and says okay natural line let's go back to jacob and esau see god's line god's seed of abraham is by election by foreknowledge by god's choosing before the foundation of the world so when they were born and expressed two different natures two different lives amen esau would have been the one who would have got the gold star for merit and jacob would have been put in remedial training but jacob was where the promised word was so jacob was the promised word for his day jacob became the christ in his day how so because god chose it so not by what he did but what god chose not by his choice but by god's choice and when that came down that now was the promised seed and esau was not the promised seed and now the lineage moves on down through to 12 sons and this and that and the other they got hung up in the one born of this one and born of this one and born of this one but what paul was able to do was look beyond amen just what the eyes could see and go back into the mind of god and say oh it makes sense because god already foresaw jacob and not esau so jacob was the seed of promise that's why the seed line went right down through that without that understanding you're looking at jacob and esau and saying how did god pick what do they do what should i emulate to be the right one what kind of deeds can i do what kind of acts should i act what should i do to be the one that god would choose and he's looking at the life of jacob and esau showing that you can't look at their life to decide which one's the seed amen that was four known before the foundation of the world the thought of god will bring the change in the necessary time but they could not become seed by making a change themselves but god's thought amen is not going to be thwarted by anybody's attitude by anybody's conduct god has a way of orchestrating the circumstances until he can finally get a surrender so that his word could come in the manifestation because jacob was foreordained to be the christ in his day praise be to god now let's go back to genesis chapter 12. genesis chapter 12 verse 1 now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from my father's house into a land that i will show thee and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curseth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed i want to stop here for a minute and look at this promise this is a promise given to abraham but remember abraham's promise goes to abraham's seed and and the everyone in the bible i mean all bible scholars and bible teachers would tell you that this verse chapter verse 2 and verse 3 is pointing to the coming of christ as in jesus christ of nazareth but what they failed to see is it's pointing to the coming of christ everywhere christ comes every time the promised word is made manifest in that season amen there the promise of abraham lies amen and listen to what it said i will bless thee and make thee a great name and thou shalt thou shalt be a blessing so abraham did not go forth just to be blessed god called abraham to be a blessing why because christ is always a blessing everywhere he goes christ is a blessing amen if you can receive the blessing and he says in verse 3 and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed i say if we can find ourselves in christ how many believe you're in christ then you're a seat of abraham you believe your seat of abraham then you're under the promise abraham you believe that we're under the promise of abraham according to the bible then this promise is upon you you are on this earth to be a blessing that's why you're here you're on this earth to be a blessing because the promise of abraham is on you and that whoever blesses you will be blessed and whoever curses you will be cursed why because that's where god's word is in this day wherever the seed of abraham is to bless god's word is to be blessed to curse god's word is to be cursed i i so want this understanding this revelation to soak into me that it will change my conduct every day and i will realize i am a seed of abraham by faith i am a seed of abraham by union with christ i am a seed of abraham and the promise of abraham is upon me and i am here to be a blessing to anyone that can receive a blessing amen let's go on let's go to hebrews chapter six there's a few more i want to read real quick hebrews chapter 6. i trust you're enjoying the bible study there are so many scriptures on this see one thing that i find amazing is when you you when you i've said this so many times about i'll say it again i'll probably say it a thousand more times so forgive me but if you look at the way jesus handled the word in his day he did not speak the word when he was speaking of what moses taught and all of this and even jonas he was taking scriptures from david and from jonas and from joel and from zechariah and all of these things and he was preaching in a way they had never heard it preached like that before they couldn't even understand it applied that way it didn't even make any sense to them the way that jesus was presenting the word because he was presenting it so differently than their intellectual understanding and then the apostle paul comes and does the same thing with the scriptures we read i'm telling you it's hard to go back and think like a jew we've never thought like a jew but if you could go back and think like a jew and then paul would be absolutely tearing the height off of you your understanding flipping your understanding on its heel and messing up everything that you had learned all of your life but i tell you the prophet of god in our day did the exact same thing to the denominational understanding of the word and when the word comes to fulfillment and the interpretation of the word is always different than the humanistic understanding of being able to read words being able to read words and comprehend language amen when when jesus came he tore that to shreds when paul came he tore that to shreds and when brother branham came he tore that to shreds that's why people say i don't need anything else i just want my bible that's wonderful if you've got eyes to see and ears they're here you'll be good but if you're reading it the way the jews read their bible when jesus was here you'll be as lost as the jews who were rejecting jesus because they they didn't want this they just wanted their bible but this was their bible amen and we've come to the end of time where god and his mercy and grace has sent a prophet in this age and that prophet was here to bring the correct interpretation of the word to illuminate the word so that we could see the scriptures the way god wanted the scripture seen and you have people with the audacity to say i don't want that i just want my bible you put yourself right back where the jews were in the day jesus was here because this message is christ in and it's it's it's troubling to me to hear statements like that because it shows there's no revelation but what hurts me worse than anything is when message believers will take that kind of language and say you know i don't want to uh i don't want to you know quote brother branham this much i don't want to do that i just want to stick with the bible amen brother branham was sticking with the bible do you think he's saying something different than the bible what's your revelation of what the message is and brother bam said you can never separate the messenger in his message [Music] so i don't mind taking somebody through scriptures i have no problem with that but but to be afraid of the very mechanism god sent in our day to give us this word i don't think that's right i don't think it's right because what authority eventually no matter how many bible studies you do you're eventually going to hang up somewhere to where you see a scripture this way and somebody else will take the same scripture and see it another way and you're quoting the same scriptures and not not adding anybody else's dialogue just your own understanding that scripture and your own understanding of scripture and coming to two different conclusions at the end of the day somebody has to have the authority to say this is the right interpretation of that scripture and if you don't have a vindicated prophet who is able to say this is the correct interpretation of that word so when we want to leave the when we want to leave the messenger out of the message and take just the bible listen friends you're not going to work somewhere along the line you're going to get hung up in a place that eventually the only way that the only way that you can be right on that scripture is if god sent a prophet to vindicate that that's the correct interpretation of that scripture because if not it could be your view versus their view your understanding versus their understanding and and listen if you've ever gotten to those conversations at some point you just throw in the town say hey listen here's how i know how do you know you're right here's how i know because god sent a prophet so vindicated so thoroughly vindicated that prophet so that we would understand that this is the authority god has sent on the word listen if we try to leave the prophet away separate him from the bible then what we're trying to do is ignore the vindication that god gave because look at the effort god went to vindicate that man's ministry don't throw that away god vindicated it for a reason so that he would have the right to say this is the correct interpretation of that scripture is that right so we want the correct the correct interpretation of the scripture but listen without the vindication of a prophet you've got no authority to make that the correct interpretation of spirit we had to have a prophet and he had to be vindicated and he come and he taught the bible different than anybody else ever taught it and besides paul he come and he did to the denominations what paul did to the jews totally bamboozled them and look how brother ram does it he always takes the bible he says you know abraham and sarah after their visitation on the plains and memory they got a body change well how could you say something like that we'll go look next you know she's 80 something years old and she goes to the king of gerard and the king of gerard can have any virgin he wants and he wants to marry her what did brother broom do he did the same thing paul did you think it's a natural seat you think you're children of god by the flesh let's go back to j let's go back to isaac and rebecca and let's look at jacob and esau brother branham does the exact same thing so one thing i i guess i said all that to say this that brother branham is always preaching the bible don't ever don't ever let anybody else put any thought in your mind he's always preaching the bible just because you haven't seen it yet doesn't mean it's not there but he's always preaching the bible and if you'll respect that office god will open up your understanding of the bible but if you disrespect that office you're not going to see anything some will look and look and i don't see it i don't see it i don't get it it's because you won't respect what god so thoroughly vindicated you won't honor and won't respect what god sent amen you reject what god sent which was christ and you want to understand christ first you must show respect because the jews asked jesus in in john chapter 6 what must we do to do the works of god he said this is the works of god believe on him and got a sent but if you disrespect that then how will you receive the truth of the word eyes to see and ears to hear amen but the same thing's true for every every gift if you brother branham said i can only help you if you have confidence in me if you disrespect the ministry you disrespect the pastor you disrespect that amen you're not going to see you'll sit in service and say i don't understand what he's talking about i don't understand what he's talking about i don't understand what he's talking about are you respecting or disrespecting the gift that god has placed if you disrespect it you won't understand anything the church around you would be shouting amen and hallelujah be sitting there like i don't understand what he's saying because you have to respect the office of a prophet to receive the understanding and revelation that god sent through that prophet amen hebrews chapter 6 verse 13 for when god made a promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swerved by himself praise god let's think about this for a minute for when god made a promise to abraham i want to ask you a question when god made a promise to abraham where's your promise where's your promise your promise is what he promised abraham are you promised to be heir of the world absolutely all the promises of abraham are for abraham's seed so when god made made a promise to abraham which also applies to abraham's seed which applies to me because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself my promise god swore by by himself amen he's promised to confirm it he's promised to stand by it he's promised to uphold it he swore by the greatest that could be swore by he swore by himself because there was none greater verse 14 saying surely surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise amen i'm going to keep reading no i'm not going to keep reading no yeah i am going to keep reading after efficiently and dirty obtain the promise for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife so an oath of confirmation once it's confirmed with an oath there's no more arguing it's settled that's what this is saying this this promise to abraham and his seed is settled it's settled by a promise god made which is his word and it's settled by an oath that he bound himself by an oath to this promise for the for an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife wherein god willing more abundantly to show into the heirs of promise the immutability immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things his promise and his oath his word and his oath by two immutable things that means immutable is impossible to change unchanging by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation with fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us paul now hang on to this that we just read i'll read it again and then i want to make another statement for by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have strong consolation he started this off by saying when god made a promise to abraham and now he's talking about our consolation because our consolation is in abraham's promise abraham's promise has come to us according to paul so now he starts off this by saying for when god made a promise to abraham now he talks about god's word and god's oath and now he says that's our assurance now we might have strong consolation with fled for refuge to lay hold upon hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast which entereth into that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made a high priest forever after the order of melchizedek amen jesus paul tells us that when god made this promise to abraham's seed which also comes to us because he could swear by none greater he swore by himself that means for the promise not to come upon you god would have to destroy himself or something i don't know what that means and god can't be destroyed god can't vanish the way god nothing can change in god so the promise is so sure to you it's as sure as god is sure god made it sure by himself so when you make something sure you make a a deposit or you become a surety for somebody you co-sign for something what you're doing is you're promising that if they can't make the obligation i will you become surety well god because he could swear by no matter he became sure to himself upon himself amen so the promise cannot fade away as long as god exists god would have to cease to exist for the promise to abraham to fade away that's how sure the promise is to you and i friends it is not changing it is immutable it is not fading away it is not going anywhere i am under the promise i'm to be a blessing amen and all that blessed this word made manifest will be blessed and all that curse it will be cursed why because it's the manifestation of the word of god coming down through which is what the lamb's book of life amen i want to read here in the smyrnan church age i'm doing a horrible one time god loves me anyways i'm sure of it we're not going to go much longer but i just want to lay in a few more pieces here in the smyrnan church age from the church age book the prophet of god says according to romans 4 16 we find that god has given a sure promise to all of abraham seed and paul puts himself in all believers under that designation because he says abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on and not only and and not only narrowed down his definition but rather to finalize it for in galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with jesus and counted the seed children as children of the promise and promises of having to do with election are the choosing of god and that is exactly what we have been saying those who are the royal seed or the elect of god are the predestinated foreknown of god and we're in the mind of god and his thoughts in very plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and it took its place in the body thus the bride is the lit is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting god in a many-membered body whereas once god was manifest in one member even our lord jesus christ amen i'm going to try to explain what's on my heart god through the old testament was rebuilding his masterpiece had fallen in the garden of eden and in that masterpiece first he had to get the man back so he had to get the last adam he had to restore fallen adams so he begins working right away and he comes down through the old testament and he's building back the image of the man and he's using no one he's using moses and he's using the judges he's using david he's using all of this amen that's why you can go back to those stories and you can find the new testament in those stories because he's building back the image because because listen when god when god created adam he first created him in spirit form and in spirit form he was both male and female now we we we get this so many times and we say yep adam male and female but you realize what god was doing was he was demonstrating the seventh seal he was trying to get us to understand the rest of the bible so when when christ amen is manifest he's male and female in spirit form so adam was taken and he was formed into a body amen out of the out of the dust of the earth was created a body amen and that life went into that body and that was a son of god it was a created son of god and that son of god had within him his female expression now listen i don't want to say eve was in adam it wouldn't be wrong to say that but it brings the wrong image to your mind the female portion of adam was in adam it was adam singular and adam was the blend of feminist and masculine together it was one and god brought that forth but in due time he would he would need a help meet because he's foreshadowing something he's showing what was in the mind of god he's showing what was always in god's mind and he's foreshadowing what's going to be coming down through time and so he brings a piece of adam part of his flesh the word and he forms the woman and he splits that spirit and brings the feminist spirit of adam not eve the feminist spirit of adam over and places it in this vessel and he calls their name adam male and female so so i'm going to say this oh the best way i know how god was not forming adam and then forming eve god formed adam and by the spirit of god adam became the woman he became by the moving of god amen by god's spirit and god's work he became the woman adam she didn't get a name until she until she left her husband and committed adultery then she received the name before that she didn't need a name her name was adam she was a further expression of adam she was adam being formed into female so it was adam and singular male and female then adam formed into female now you have adam male and female united as one which is adam [Applause] so the old testament is bringing back adam but in that last atom is male and female amen this is why brother bran he's so clear on this because he can see it laying in genesis he said this seven seal was spoke of all the way back in the beginning in genesis it's laying right there amen so in jesus christ was his bride at calvary amen amen he was smote in the side under his ribs by a spirit and out came the ingredients for his bride amen in the spirit returned on the day of pentecost and now that bride's being formed out of the word because he was the word made flesh and the life of christ the life of the word is now making the woman amen and so this is not eve this is jesus christ forming himself into a bride amen i'm just gonna say that's the truth we believe it or we don't believe it but it's the truth we believe it and so if i could i just wish i had better language but it doesn't take language anyways it takes revelation as god was rebuilding the masterpiece he was sending the life of christ as he sent the word down right remember in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god all right same was in the beginning with god and in him was life and that life was the light of men we got that so that was the word and as the word came down to express a portion in each age that word was christ and when christ is expressing god's rebuilding the masterpiece and as that word is expressing life is in that word so as that word's expressing god is manifesting the book of life the lamb's book of life it's coming into manifestation step by step and all of this was building back to the image of the man and life was there and then all of that life wrapped up into one vessel when john 1 14 says and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now all of that word that was expressed in each day is now flesh and brother branham says you were in him when he went to calvary because if you were the thought of god that was the word that portion of the thought of god that became word when that word came forth it was christ and you were in there because your word you're part of the word as the word expressed you were there listen brother branham says you were there when moses opened the red sea i mean i mean i have all the terms right but you were there when he did this you were there you were there why because that same life of that word is in me now and that life was there then that life is here now and i was there how well way what do you remember i don't know i can't tell you the details i don't know what color moses was wearing when he stood up and and rested his rod and split the red sea amen but there's something in me now that was there then that's why i can receive the word so so as let me come back here to the old testament noah's expressing moses is expressing joshua's expressing the judges are expressing what are they expressing it is it is christ becoming manifest is that right it's the word becoming manifest it's christ becoming manifest it's the seed of abraham moving down through it's the manifesting of the lamb's book of life it's it's all of those things all coming up so it was it was forming christ and the capping of it all was when he came down in full measure now not a portion but now the fullness and i was there now when we come over to the new testament it comes out in first aid second age all of this what's it doing now now it's building an image of a bride but is it a different life or is it the same life is it a different word under a different promise or is it the same word with the same promise amen it was if i was there he's here so now the life of christ that seed as is coming down with the promise of abraham that seed is moving down through and now that same life that same word that was in the thought of god that was spoken the word that was with god the word that was god amen that word is now amen coming into expression in the in the fourth church age and the fifth church age and the sixth third day finally till comes back to be capped again and the capping off that full life of christ returns back but it doesn't return back in the same physical image as it was when the full capstone came down there this is the capping by the headship christ returning back the fullness of the word with the fullness of the life coming back and it's in the image of a mini-membered bride but down through the church ages what was happening it was christ forming himself into a bride now why'd you explain all that brother chad because any place that christ is being expressed now do we all believe that that was christ are we thoroughly convinced that that was the word and christ is the anointed word for that day made manifest so every day that was present tense word made manifest that was christ all right and christ is that word which is the life which is the light oh there so now that word is there for a blessing to bless that you receive a blessing to curse it you receive a curse all those that are part of that life they recognize that life they become one with that life and now they're the expression of that life and that's how you can see that it wasn't just adam and then eve it was adam and adam and this is not christ and the bride it's christ and christ that's why to reject luther's message was to reject life in your day because luther was he his message was christ the anointed word for that day made manifest so it's always the same thing over and over and over again so we want to catch that now that's why he says in the smyrna church age each came forth in the designated decree season and each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus the bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting god in a many-membered body whereas once god was manifested in one member even our lord jesus christ let's go to hebrews chapter 2. hebrews chapter 2 verse 10. hebrews 2 and 10 for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things okay who is that that's the word right if you go back to john 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made all right we got that so let's read this for it became him for whom all who for whom are all things and by whom are all things this is the word which is christ things in bringing many sons into glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one he who's doing the sanctifying and you who's being sanctified you're all of one you're all of christ you're all part of that worm for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praises unto thee and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and the children which god hath given me for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham praise be to god i'm going to stop there's way too much but i want to say don't miss what god's doing don't miss and don't miss the promise that is on your life listen the promise that was on jacob's life was the promise of abraham came to jacob jacob could look at his mistakes his failures his shortcomings and never be able to receive that promise but see it was independent of his failure his mistakes and his shortcomings it was based on the foreknowledge and election of god but when when god called jacob and he changed him to israel and israel went through his chains he became a blessing to all nations and that's what he was here for because he was to manifest christ he was to manifest the word which the word is the blessing to all and so now we come by election by god's foreign nation it wasn't listen it wasn't jacob's flesh that was so special it was the predetermined counsel of god that this flesh would contain a life that would manifest me and when it comes to us it's not our flesh that's so special other than it's being ordained by god before the foundation of the world to house a life and that life will be quickened by the spirit of god and that manifestation will be the manifestation of the anointed word for this day and that is here to be a blessing amen and to be part of the seed of abraham to receive the promises of god and now we understand now there's a seed of abraham coming through which is also speaking of the lamb's book of life but that lamb's book of life is here to be a blessing remember we were talking about uh wednesday that those all around that life who blessed that life were part of the book of life and received life why because that life was a blessing but those who cursed that life became cursed at the white throne judgment remember the white throne judgment matthew 25 when he separates them as he separates sheep from goats and he says to the sheep or to the ones on the right hand because you fed me when i was naked you clothed me and when i was naked fed me when i was poor visiting me in prison because you did this to me and they said lord when did we do it to you he said when you did it to the seed of abraham brother chad you're misquoting the scriptures i'm saying the same thing when you did it to the seed of abraham you did it to me to the ones on the left hand because you didn't feed me you didn't do this you didn't do that you go into eternal judgment they say lord when did we see you and not and see you and not and he said when you did it not to the least of these seed of abraham you did it not unto me and that is the scene of the white throne judgment and i see that blessing that blessing is as sure as god is sure because god has confirmed it with an oath the blessing to abraham god is going to stand by it at the white throne judgment and we are here this manifestation of the word is here to be a blessing if it brings a curse it's because somebody refused it and hated it and didn't love it but it came to be a blessing everywhere abraham went was a blessing if they would receive abraham if they cursed abraham or did wrong to abraham it became a curse to them but if they would bless abraham it became a blessing to them and that same promise is coming down through and thank god there's still seed of abraham on this earth because when there is no longer seed of abraham on this earth it's going to be a bad thing for this world but we're here with a promise and that promise is just sure as god is sure i want to live my life under the promise of abraham and i want to live my life under the blessing of abraham oh there's so much more i want to get to but you pray for me and we'll come back wednesday let's all stand musicians if you could come i don't think we could ever fully grasp how blessed we are i don't think we could ever fully comprehend or maybe we are beginning to comprehend and maybe there will come greater comprehension as the days go by but oh i want to see amen i want to if i could see me the way god sees me i would never struggle again we could see how sure our position is and how sure the blessing is and how sure the promise is i don't think we would sweat it near as much as we sweat it i think our levels of anxiety would come down when we see how solid and sure this promise is to abraham see the real question is is do you have faith to believe your abraham's seed because we shouldn't be in doubt of the promise and we shouldn't be in doubt of the blessings because god has made those sure so we can't be in doubt of that the devil will try to make you doubt whether or not you're abraham's seed or not but i say shake off the devil and take the word amen and believe the word and say i am a child of god amen by faith that god has planted in my heart i believe this word i believe it to the core of who i am and i am part of that christ seed [Applause] and i want to live like it act like it talk like it pray like it i want to live with the revelation of who i am let us bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your goodness lord for your word that is so solid so sure god i so thankful lord for you lord as you wrote your bible and you brought it down to the apostle paul and he caught the revelation lord of the spiritual seed of abraham the christ seed well now you sent a prophet in this day to take us back to what paul taught so that we would understand lord that it's not by merit but it's by election and that election is planted within us a seat of faith for by grace we are saved through faith and that not of ourselves it's your gift you've given us lord and here we are your children by faith here we are under the promise and under the blessing of abraham because you've given us a seed of faith to believe god we just want to raise our hands to you and say thank you god we love you father because we could have never done this on our own but you did it lord you did it before the foundation of the world and they are opening our eyes to see how sure the promise is and what we're here for god take us into your hands and use us for your glory minister lord through these vessels speak through these mouths touch through these hands use us for the purpose you've intended us for in this life we will give you all the praise and all the glory take your preeminence now among us we pray in jesus christ's name amen god bless you friends we're going to gather
