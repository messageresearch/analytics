[0:09] and help us
[0:18] [Music]
[0:26] [Music]
[0:39] praise the lord
[0:41] it's very very good to see you guys the
[0:44] few that are gathered here it's such a
[0:46] privilege
[0:47] to be able to be back in church and i
[0:49] know that most of the congregation is
[0:51] streaming which is very unusual for us
[0:54] it's an odd feeling
[0:56] but i know that
[0:57] many assemblies have had to do this
[0:59] they've been forced into a shutdown of
[1:01] one way or another
[1:03] and so now it's our turn to experience
[1:05] it for now and we pray god's mercy and
[1:08] grace be upon us and that god will just
[1:10] speak the way he always has amen
[1:13] you know that um
[1:15] i was just i was thinking the other day
[1:17] that
[1:18] the apostle paul made a strange
[1:20] statement i haven't looked it up it just
[1:21] comes to my mind fresh but he has that
[1:23] statement where he's telling them in the
[1:25] in the corinthian church how to deal
[1:27] with an issue they've got an issue that
[1:29] they need to deal with
[1:30] and he tells them when you're gathered
[1:31] together and my spirit is present
[1:34] you have to ask yourself paul was where
[1:36] else in the world
[1:38] but he said when my when you're gathered
[1:40] together to deal with this issue and my
[1:42] spirit is present with you this is what
[1:44] you should do
[1:45] showing that spirits don't they're not
[1:47] restricted by space matter and time
[1:50] amen so we have some that are streaming
[1:53] they may be on the at home in many
[1:55] different places in many different
[1:56] locations but if we're gathered together
[1:59] amen let's make our spirits here too
[2:01] amen let's just let's just put our licks
[2:03] of fire together and ask the lord to do
[2:05] what only he can do
[2:06] these are unusual times and unusual
[2:08] circumstances and we find ourselves in a
[2:11] place we don't want to be
[2:12] i can assure you more than anybody else
[2:14] this is a place we don't want to be i
[2:16] don't want to be in this condition
[2:19] in this time
[2:20] having to endure what we're enduring but
[2:23] god knew from before the foundation of
[2:25] the world and this is his will and so he
[2:28] takes it out of our hands and he does
[2:30] what he wants to do for his own glory
[2:33] and he does it in a way that no man will
[2:35] get glory nobody can say they had it
[2:37] figured out because nobody had this
[2:39] figured out
[2:40] but god already had it figured out from
[2:42] before the foundation of the world so
[2:44] we're learning to trust
[2:46] this whole life we've been learning to
[2:48] trust and this is still more learning to
[2:50] trust
[2:52] and while we're standing let's just take
[2:53] our bibles and look at psalms 103.
[2:58] psalms 103 and verse
[3:01] 1.
[3:04] so we've missed two services last
[3:07] wednesday and sunday so i'm out of
[3:09] practice in preaching
[3:11] so you'll have to help me
[3:13] brother bam said preaching something you
[3:14] got to stay up with
[3:16] and so
[3:17] praise god
[3:19] psalms 103 verse 1
[3:21] bless the lord o my soul
[3:23] and all that is within me bless his holy
[3:26] name
[3:27] bless the lord all my soul and forget
[3:29] not all his benefits
[3:31] who forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[3:33] healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth
[3:36] thy life from destruction who crowneth
[3:38] thee with lovingkindness and tender
[3:41] mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good
[3:44] things so that thy youth is renewed like
[3:46] an eagles
[3:48] amen we all need this right now there's
[3:50] many in the assembly not feeling well
[3:52] they need this right now but it's god's
[3:55] promise for his children
[3:56] let's just bow our heads and pray dear
[3:59] lord jesus we thank you father for all
[4:01] that you've done for us
[4:03] and lord we're so appreciative of you in
[4:06] this hour that we live
[4:07] that you've promised to be a friend that
[4:09] sticketh closer than a brother
[4:11] you promised you'd never leave us nor
[4:13] forsake us and lord if we can't gather
[4:15] together if we can't see one another for
[4:17] a week or two on end or however long you
[4:20] see fit to allow it
[4:22] god you still are a friend that sticketh
[4:24] closer than a brother
[4:26] lord you are the tower that we run into
[4:28] you are the very present help in a time
[4:30] of trouble you are the one that is
[4:33] always near and watching over and and
[4:35] you're you're trying to get us to rely
[4:38] on that lord and it's a lesson we don't
[4:40] want to learn this way it's a lesson
[4:42] that we don't want to have to endure
[4:44] through hard trials but it's something
[4:46] that you want to get us to to we learn
[4:48] to have total confidence and reliance
[4:51] upon you
[4:52] and not anybody else
[4:54] lord we submit to your ways we submit to
[4:56] your will we ask god that you would give
[4:59] us grace to walk in a way that's
[5:01] pleasing to you and lord that you would
[5:03] give us the wisdom to to understand what
[5:05] you want done every step of the way
[5:08] for all these times these are paths that
[5:10] we've never walked before these are not
[5:12] things that we can ask lord our
[5:14] grandparents or our parents what they
[5:16] did when they came to a time like this
[5:18] they've never come to a time like this
[5:21] but god you saw fit to place us here and
[5:23] your holy ghost leadership has not
[5:25] diminished one drop
[5:27] we're trusting in you and not in
[5:29] ourselves to lead us all the way and the
[5:32] paths of righteousness for your name's
[5:33] sake that you might be glorified
[5:36] lord bless your children that are not
[5:38] able to gather be with them wherever
[5:40] they are
[5:41] lord bless those that are still sick and
[5:43] body lord those that are struggling i
[5:46] pray that you would strengthen them i
[5:48] pray that you would just give them vigor
[5:50] and life lord and that the promise would
[5:52] begin to take effect in their body that
[5:54] you would bring their physical body
[5:56] subject to the promise in your word and
[5:58] make it line up in obedience to your
[6:01] promise that by your stripes we are
[6:04] already healed
[6:05] though we trust in you in jesus christ's
[6:07] name we pray amen
[6:10] you can all have your seats
[6:14] amen if you can turn to proverbs
[6:17] turn with me to proverbs chapter 3.
[6:28] proverbs chapter 3 and verse 5.
[6:33] it says trust in the lord with all thine
[6:35] heart and lean not into thine own
[6:37] understanding
[6:38] in all thy ways acknowledge him and he
[6:40] shall direct thy paths
[6:42] what a good scripture
[6:45] trust in the lord with all thine heart
[6:47] and lean not into thine own
[6:49] understanding
[6:51] in all thy ways acknowledge him and he
[6:53] shall direct thy paths so that's
[6:55] instruction but it's instruction with a
[6:56] promise
[6:57] that he will direct thy path
[7:00] we just have to acknowledge him in all
[7:02] of our ways we need to
[7:04] uh
[7:06] trust in him with all our heart and lean
[7:08] not and that's the key lean not to our
[7:11] own understanding
[7:12] where we fall into trouble is leaning
[7:14] upon our own understanding
[7:16] and and you know i i feel like when
[7:18] we've come to this this trial that we're
[7:20] in the whole world's in a trial
[7:23] you know but us as an assembly we're in
[7:25] a trial certain individuals and families
[7:27] within the assembly are in in hard
[7:29] trials
[7:30] and we never wanted to be here and in
[7:33] fact you know i didn't believe we would
[7:34] have to see this i didn't believe any
[7:36] sickness in this virus would touch our
[7:38] assembly
[7:39] and i knew i didn't have thus saith the
[7:41] lord and i knew i didn't have the word
[7:42] of the lord or our promise
[7:44] but i believed that we honor god's words
[7:47] we stand for him and i believe the bride
[7:48] would have been spared
[7:50] this as it swept through but god had a
[7:53] different understanding than my
[7:54] understanding and he's not obligated to
[7:57] do things according to our understanding
[7:59] but he already has a plan before the
[8:01] foundation of the world
[8:03] and although i wanted it to go a
[8:05] different way and i thought that it
[8:06] would and and i and i you know i was
[8:09] confident that god was going to spare us
[8:11] and this would sweep over and god would
[8:13] protect his children and his bride
[8:15] you know just because god didn't meet my
[8:17] expectations doesn't change anything
[8:21] like nothing has changed there's
[8:22] absolutely nothing changed the word
[8:24] hasn't changed the the seed of god
[8:27] hasn't changed the plan of god hasn't
[8:29] changed the purpose and all this just
[8:31] because it didn't meet my or your
[8:33] whoever else's expectation changes
[8:35] nothing
[8:36] the program of god is not off by one
[8:39] click
[8:40] and so we have to remind ourselves you
[8:42] know because
[8:43] when i first uh wednesday when i first
[8:46] got the report that somebody in the
[8:47] assembly had been uh tested positive for
[8:50] coven 19 it it took my breath away i
[8:52] mean it just shocked me and it come from
[8:55] out of left field you know in a place i
[8:57] didn't expect and it was wednesday as i
[8:59] was preparing for service and i didn't
[9:01] know what that would mean i didn't know
[9:02] what we'd have to do differently for
[9:04] service and so i canceled the service so
[9:06] we had time to figure out what to do and
[9:08] and as we tried to figure out what to do
[9:10] and learn more and we began to
[9:12] make some phone calls and we found out
[9:14] that the the government was really good
[9:16] with us and the health department was
[9:18] really nice nobody ever said anything we
[9:20] didn't have to you know jump through any
[9:22] hoops we didn't have any anything that
[9:24] we had to change or do differently they
[9:26] were very very kind and very easy and
[9:28] good to work with so so but as we went
[9:31] through that process we begin to learn
[9:33] more about the the director's order and
[9:36] and more about the extension you know
[9:38] there was an extension that went until
[9:40] may 1st and as we learned more than we
[9:42] had a brother who understands law who
[9:43] helped us break it down and understand
[9:45] and as we begin to understand more we
[9:47] begin to realize what what our exemption
[9:50] entailed we are allowed to have
[9:51] religious services but under certain
[9:53] exemptions and we need to fulfill
[9:55] certain requirements and so all of that
[9:57] came together friday and saturday and
[9:59] really on saturday so i felt like there
[10:01] was no way to get all the implementation
[10:03] in place before sunday so we cancel
[10:06] sunday service so here we are cancelled
[10:09] wednesday service cancel sunday service
[10:11] and all i want to do is see the saints
[10:14] like the only thing i want to do is see
[10:16] the people i just want to see their
[10:17] faces and i just want to talk to them
[10:19] and i want everybody to know that that
[10:21] everything's okay and we're going to be
[10:23] fine but because once we learn what the
[10:26] requirements and obligations are for
[10:28] what they consider an essential business
[10:30] which is churches are included as a
[10:32] religious entity under the exemption but
[10:34] we have things that we need to do in
[10:36] order to fulfill the obligation and that
[10:38] exemption so we can still gather
[10:41] so in order to do that we just needed
[10:42] more time so that's why we're here with
[10:45] just the officers in the church and
[10:47] their families because everybody
[10:48] understands what those requirements are
[10:50] because we met last night and talked
[10:52] about it and so we're going to move
[10:54] forward as the lord leads we don't know
[10:57] what we don't know exactly what sunday's
[10:59] going to be like the next wednesday to
[11:01] sunday after that we're just asking god
[11:03] to give us leadership so that we can do
[11:05] what we're supposed to do according to
[11:08] the to the law to fulfill what caesar
[11:10] requires but still be able to gather
[11:12] together in some fashion or another and
[11:15] have life preaching so that the
[11:17] streaming can go out to those who aren't
[11:19] able to make it in so just pray for
[11:21] god's leadership so that we know how to
[11:23] make every step so that we know what to
[11:25] do and we can do it according to god's
[11:27] perfect plan and god's perfect will
[11:30] and he said we don't
[11:33] we would have picked a different path
[11:36] we would have we would have chosen
[11:38] different outcomes
[11:40] we would have we would have had you know
[11:43] if it was us we would have had something
[11:46] super fantastic take place and we would
[11:48] have all been gathered together and and
[11:50] the walls would have shook and and the
[11:52] the rafters would have lifted and the
[11:54] power of god would have swept through
[11:55] and there would have been prophecy go
[11:57] forth and nobody would have been touched
[11:59] by anything and anything would have been
[12:01] lifted off amen that's in our minds
[12:03] that's the way we always want it to be
[12:05] but god is always wanting to do
[12:07] something in a different way than what
[12:09] we ever anticipated and god is full of
[12:11] surprises
[12:13] and part of spiritual maturity is
[12:15] learning to just move with the way god
[12:17] wants to move and when god decides to
[12:20] move differently and you know for for
[12:22] this evening i just want to preach on
[12:24] expectations
[12:26] expectations
[12:28] because we had expectations i i don't
[12:30] want to say we i don't want to include
[12:31] anybody else but i had expectations
[12:34] and god did not meet my expectations
[12:36] amen but i don't ever
[12:39] when we come to a place as children of
[12:41] god we're being trained we're being
[12:44] trained to come to the final showdown
[12:45] friends this is part of that training
[12:48] what we're going through now is part of
[12:50] learning to fully rely on god lean not
[12:52] to our own understanding trust in him
[12:54] acknowledge him in all our ways and let
[12:56] him direct our path not to have
[12:58] everything figured out but to let him
[13:00] who's got it figured out lead step by
[13:02] step
[13:03] and it doesn't ever stop us from having
[13:05] expectations
[13:07] i don't know that it ever can stop us
[13:08] from having expectations it'll never
[13:10] stop us from pondering it'll never stop
[13:12] us from probing and poking and starting
[13:15] to try to put puzzle pieces together
[13:17] before the time i don't know that god
[13:19] ever wants us to stop doing that because
[13:21] that's part of loving his word
[13:23] that's part of anticipating what he's
[13:25] going to do that's looking forward with
[13:27] joyful expectation to what god will do
[13:29] next i don't know that he ever wants us
[13:30] to stop that but we have to learn that
[13:33] that's just us
[13:34] and that's not god and god can do it
[13:36] different and it's going to be okay
[13:39] and when god comes in and shakes your
[13:41] puzzle back apart and says you have it
[13:43] all wrong amen we got to say well thank
[13:44] you god
[13:46] and not just get so disappointed and
[13:48] discouraged you know when i found out
[13:50] that what happened to us i what i
[13:52] thought wouldn't happen happened i was
[13:53] at first disappointed
[13:56] there was disappointment my first
[13:57] emotion was disappointment
[13:59] and then i had concern for the
[14:01] individuals who weren't well and you
[14:02] know i would begin to mourn for them i
[14:04] had concern and began to pray but
[14:07] but then my disappointment faded and i
[14:09] realized nothing changed
[14:12] god is still god
[14:14] i was personally disappointed because
[14:16] god didn't do what i thought he should
[14:18] do
[14:19] but i can't be disappointed in god
[14:21] because god didn't change
[14:23] and i can't be disappointed in the word
[14:25] of god because the word of god didn't
[14:26] change
[14:28] you know and so we we've got to come
[14:30] back to that place where the word of god
[14:33] is unmovable and if we had the wrong
[14:35] idea about the word of god doesn't
[14:36] change the word of god all it does is
[14:38] prove that we we you know it proves the
[14:41] fact that i'm i'm very consistent
[14:46] in being wrong about the future
[14:50] very consistent if there's anything i'm
[14:52] consistent and i'm very consistent about
[14:54] being wrong in the future and god gives
[14:56] us just enough to know that there's
[14:58] these pieces in the future that are
[15:00] coming and there's these things that'll
[15:01] happen and you just have enough pieces
[15:04] to know that something's out there but
[15:05] he doesn't paint the whole picture until
[15:07] you get there and you're right in the
[15:09] middle of it and in the middle of it you
[15:10] still sometimes don't clearly understand
[15:12] but as soon as you step forward to step
[15:14] or two you're like that's it that's it
[15:16] that's it
[15:18] because god wants us to walk by faith
[15:21] not by sight
[15:23] and if we could figure it out ahead of
[15:24] time we would walk by sight because we
[15:26] already have it figured out and all we
[15:28] have to do but god wants us to walk by
[15:30] faith and not by sight so he will he'll
[15:33] even let us like children play with his
[15:35] word
[15:37] like his children will take this is this
[15:39] is my father's word and look it seems to
[15:41] match and fit here and god's smiling
[15:43] because he knows he's going to train his
[15:45] child to know you're not me and you that
[15:47] you don't know and he's going to mess it
[15:49] up so that we can learn to fully rely on
[15:52] him
[15:53] so it was it was disappointing
[15:56] but
[15:57] but in that disappointment we
[16:01] had to make a quick decision on
[16:02] wednesday and we decided to stream
[16:04] brother abraham's service
[16:06] and i had recommended people watch it
[16:08] and i had watched it with my family as a
[16:09] devotion and and it just come to mind
[16:11] let's just do that and i watched it and
[16:13] i sat in my living room and watched it
[16:15] again
[16:16] knowing all the circumstances that we're
[16:18] now in that we weren't in in november
[16:20] when he preached it
[16:21] and then when he preached that sermon i
[16:23] was just astounded at how prophetic and
[16:25] how perfect it was and how it fit the
[16:28] situation and i was greatly comforted by
[16:30] that
[16:32] but then sunday
[16:34] again we had to make a quick decision
[16:35] because we canceled church
[16:37] saturday i believe saturday afternoon
[16:39] and i had to make a very fast decision
[16:43] so first message popped in my mind on
[16:45] the wings of a snow white dove
[16:48] i didn't even have to ponder didn't even
[16:49] have to think about it as soon as i
[16:51] decided to cancel the next thought on
[16:52] the wings of the snow white dove and we
[16:54] played that and we gathered our family
[16:56] and many most of you i'm assuming
[16:58] gathered to to watch that as well and i
[17:01] was shocked again at how perfect
[17:03] how perfect and it was not by
[17:05] forethought no thought no thought
[17:07] injected in that at all first message
[17:09] popped in my mind and i said it brother
[17:12] franco came over and he got it going for
[17:14] us so we could do it
[17:15] with the words so we appreciate him
[17:17] being instant in season and out of
[17:20] season
[17:21] but
[17:23] but it was perfect
[17:25] so through it all god's perfect
[17:28] even when we weren't able to be together
[17:30] god was perfect and i was marveled in
[17:33] brother abraham when he began to preach
[17:35] on
[17:36] the weakening of the ministry
[17:38] because i can tell you i felt weak
[17:40] friends
[17:41] i couldn't even come to church and
[17:43] preach i mean that's the weakening of
[17:44] the ministry you can't even get behind
[17:46] the pulpit and preach to the to the
[17:49] people that god has called to gather
[17:50] together an assembly in one service and
[17:53] then the next service and then you know
[17:56] things changing is the weakening of the
[17:58] ministry
[17:59] because the weakening of the ministry is
[18:02] the rising of the bride is the maturity
[18:04] of the bride because the bride is not
[18:06] going to be
[18:07] held in second place but the bride is
[18:09] coming to full manifestation
[18:12] that doesn't mean there won't be a
[18:13] ministry there'll be a ministry but it
[18:15] can't be the strong ministry that solves
[18:17] every problem and figures everything out
[18:19] and it's right and correct every time
[18:22] and so we got a good dose of that and i
[18:24] i appreciate it brother brother abraham
[18:26] brought that out that we can't just rely
[18:29] on one or two or three people or strong
[18:32] ministers they'll figure it all out then
[18:34] they'll tell me and then i'll do what
[18:36] what god brought over the pulpit and all
[18:38] be figured out god could at any time
[18:40] remove that so that we as an individual
[18:42] have to say god's in control he can tell
[18:44] me what to do next
[18:47] that we all have to be able to hear from
[18:49] god
[18:50] and so it was breaking my heart not to
[18:52] be with the people and it's breaking my
[18:54] heart now you have no idea how hard it
[18:56] is for me not to have everybody here
[18:58] i want more than anything to have
[19:00] everybody here to see everybody to see
[19:02] how they're doing
[19:03] to have the dynamics of preaching to
[19:06] make that connection on the spirit realm
[19:08] during the service so i can feel how
[19:10] everybody's doing and it's breaking my
[19:12] heart but this is what god wants for
[19:14] right now
[19:15] this is his path this is his choice and
[19:18] i know it is
[19:19] god definitely laid on my heart not to
[19:21] fight it just to go with it
[19:23] and so i don't have anything else
[19:25] figured out past that just don't fight
[19:27] it
[19:28] but
[19:30] god wants every one of us to know
[19:32] in our homes and in our workplaces and
[19:34] in our prayer closets
[19:36] he can lead us as an individual
[19:39] he can tell us personally what to do or
[19:42] he can tell us nothing and make us wait
[19:44] it out
[19:46] but that we learn to rely on him not
[19:49] somebody else
[19:51] we've all had to go through this
[19:54] we've had some lessons you know when
[19:56] whenever something happens in an
[19:58] unexpected way you begin to ask yourself
[20:00] questions
[20:01] why why is this happening
[20:03] why why didn't it go the way i expected
[20:06] it
[20:06] you know and we we know that god's made
[20:09] promises there's a there's promises out
[20:11] there there's quotes out there that
[20:12] there's plagues coming and they won't
[20:14] touch any of those that have the holy
[20:16] ghost and that's true and i believe that
[20:18] but we don't know what point and what
[20:20] plagues
[20:22] they're coming there's things coming up
[20:24] on the earth and even in the in the
[20:26] exodus and the exodus when the plagues
[20:28] were falling the first three affected
[20:30] those in goshen just like they affected
[20:32] everybody else but when it came to the
[20:34] fourth plague god said i'm going to
[20:36] create a distinction now that that
[20:38] goshen's going to be separated out to
[20:40] create a distinction between my people
[20:42] and those that aren't and then the
[20:44] plague didn't affect them until they get
[20:45] to the last plague then it affected
[20:47] everybody
[20:49] so
[20:50] so some affect everybody
[20:53] some the the the children of god will be
[20:55] free from in the exodus journey god
[20:58] decides where he makes that
[21:00] cut god decides where he makes that cut
[21:04] but i'm not ashamed that i believed that
[21:06] he would bypass us
[21:08] i'm not embarrassed
[21:10] that i believed that he wouldn't let
[21:12] this sickness fall on us
[21:14] because that's how children should
[21:15] believe
[21:17] that my dad won't let this hurt me
[21:20] is that how we want our children to
[21:22] believe my dad will take care of me my
[21:23] dad's not gonna let anything bad happen
[21:25] to me my father's gonna take care of me
[21:27] knowing in your mind that anything can
[21:29] happen and then when we got in our car
[21:31] and we drove here we believed that god
[21:33] wouldn't let us get an accident coming
[21:34] to church
[21:36] right we never get in our car and
[21:38] believe today's the day god's going to
[21:40] let me get an act we always believe
[21:41] god's going to protect us god's going to
[21:43] provide for us and we're going to get
[21:45] here and i'm not embarrassed to believe
[21:48] that
[21:49] and then if god allows us to be in an
[21:51] accident or allows us to get hurt or
[21:53] allows the tragedy to come then i'm not
[21:55] embarrassed that i believed he wouldn't
[21:57] let it happen
[21:58] because i believe that my father takes
[22:00] care of me and if he's allowed a tragedy
[22:03] to come a sickness or an injury or an
[22:06] accident or something to come then
[22:08] that's what he wants to happen and now
[22:10] my faith will switch to him protect
[22:13] caring for me healing me delivering me
[22:15] from this situation
[22:17] and i'm not embarrassed to be a child
[22:19] with child like faith
[22:22] so you know
[22:24] i'm embarrassed sometimes that my
[22:26] intellect is a failure
[22:28] but i'm not embarrassed to have
[22:30] childlike faith
[22:31] i'm not ashamed to believe
[22:34] i'm not ashamed to have believed that
[22:35] god would not let this plague that's
[22:38] sweeping the earth touch touches bride
[22:40] but i'm also not ashamed that he let it
[22:42] touch his bride
[22:44] because now i believe it's time to
[22:45] switch to the promises and said there's
[22:47] promises for this too that by his
[22:50] stripes we are already healed that he'll
[22:52] take care of us and that nothing happens
[22:54] in the life of a believer unless it
[22:56] first crosses god's desk and he signs
[22:58] off on it everything is clicking just
[23:01] right on time
[23:02] nothing is out of cater with god
[23:04] so we either have to accept that or we
[23:07] don't accept it you can't have it in
[23:08] between because if we mix that somewhere
[23:11] in between then we're always on pins and
[23:13] needles and we're always nervous and
[23:14] we're always uncertain of where we stand
[23:18] so when god lets things like this happen
[23:20] it means sometimes it's just so we can
[23:23] learn not to rely on our own
[23:24] understanding
[23:26] and maybe that we can be more cautious
[23:28] with what we think
[23:31] and to bring a greater humility
[23:33] which we'll take
[23:35] we'll always take it a greater humility
[23:37] god it's not a bad thing
[23:39] if you if you show me that my intellect
[23:42] is poor
[23:45] and my ability to see the future is
[23:47] flawed
[23:48] thank you god that's a good reminder
[23:51] if you're going to humble us back to
[23:53] full dependence on you and not to take
[23:55] and inject our own thinking so much and
[23:57] get so comfortable with assuming that we
[24:00] can think things and put pieces together
[24:02] but god will sometimes strip that right
[24:04] out so we don't get comfortable in that
[24:06] arena i'm okay with that
[24:09] so every once in a while god will do
[24:11] something like that so we realize hey
[24:13] this is just what i think
[24:16] and it could be wrong and more likely
[24:19] than not it is
[24:21] but i still like thinking about these
[24:22] things
[24:24] so
[24:25] so we're learning to trust in the lord
[24:27] regardless
[24:29] whether it happens the way we thought
[24:31] or we didn't think
[24:33] we're learning to trust in the lord
[24:36] i want to drop something in a brother
[24:38] shared with me from the assembly here
[24:40] concerning brother branham
[24:42] in a worldwide pandemic just because i
[24:44] thought it was very interesting and
[24:46] encouraging
[24:47] but this brother shared with me that in
[24:50] 1957 and 58 there was a worldwide
[24:52] pandemic
[24:55] and then he and he pulled this off the
[24:57] cdc website and went and looked at it of
[24:59] the center for disease control
[25:01] website
[25:02] and there was a
[25:04] a new virus a new influenza virus
[25:06] emerged in east asia triggering a
[25:09] pandemic called asian flu
[25:12] and
[25:13] that was in 1957 and into 1958
[25:17] then according to the cdc it says the
[25:19] estimated number of deaths was 1.1
[25:22] million worldwide
[25:24] 1957 1958 1.1 million worldwide
[25:30] where
[25:31] this pandemic is at 80 some thousand
[25:34] worldwide so this was 1.1 million it was
[25:36] huge
[25:37] so far to date it was much bigger than
[25:41] the one that's going on now we don't
[25:42] know how this would win we don't know
[25:44] how much bigger it'll get but to date
[25:46] 1.1 million worldwide
[25:48] that's how many people died not infected
[25:51] died
[25:53] and 116 000 died in the united states
[25:58] so this was a big deal this was a big
[26:00] pandemic that was sweeping the world
[26:02] but listen what brother branham says in
[26:04] sirs we would see jesus from december of
[26:07] 1957
[26:08] and now to be here with my good friend
[26:10] brother hutchins and brother joseph jose
[26:12] and this was supposed to be my vacation
[26:15] this fall i started a vacation and i
[26:17] like to hunt real well so i went out
[26:19] west to go hunting the party that i went
[26:21] with including myself all broke down
[26:23] with this here asian flu we didn't even
[26:26] take our guns from the cases and came
[26:28] back home
[26:29] so brother branham caught the asian flu
[26:32] him and the whole hunting party was with
[26:34] so being with brother branham would not
[26:37] have spared you from the asian flu
[26:41] him being a prophet of god for the age
[26:42] didn't spare him from the asian flu that
[26:45] was a worldwide pandemic so if we've not
[26:48] been spared from the asian flu or from
[26:51] from the coronavirus then we're just in
[26:54] the same category as the prophet of god
[26:58] he says a few days later four days later
[27:01] and speak to this mountain
[27:02] and i come up here on my vacation i
[27:04] started on my vacation early fall and
[27:06] the whole group broke down with the
[27:08] asian flu we had to come back
[27:11] so
[27:11] don't feel discouraged
[27:14] if you caught a sickness as a worldwide
[27:16] pandemic brother branham did too
[27:18] and everybody that was with him in his
[27:20] hunting party did too so even if brother
[27:23] brenham was here preaching in this
[27:25] church we could still catch
[27:28] a disease from a pandemic
[27:31] so
[27:32] god's god if he would allow one child to
[27:36] go through that he'll allow another
[27:38] child to go through that amen and it
[27:40] doesn't spare us only until it comes to
[27:42] the time where god says now i'm going to
[27:45] make a distinction between what's mine
[27:47] and what's not and from that point on
[27:49] and god's the only don't god's the only
[27:51] one who knows when he's going to make
[27:52] that distinction he's the only one who
[27:54] knows when and where he'll draw the line
[27:56] amen and then he'll just do it and he
[27:58] won't consult us ahead of time
[28:00] he'll just do it and we'll see it happen
[28:04] so praise be to god
[28:06] so when we look at expectation we can
[28:09] look all the way through the scriptures
[28:11] and we find that god god i don't think
[28:14] has ever done anything according to his
[28:16] people's expectations
[28:19] i don't think i don't think i can see
[28:21] anywhere in the scripture where they've
[28:22] never he's ever done anything according
[28:24] to now listen according to his people's
[28:27] expectations these aren't even
[28:29] unbelievers but his believing children
[28:31] had an expectation and he did it
[28:33] different to their expectation but i i
[28:35] i'd like to inject this and say it like
[28:37] this
[28:38] just because god doesn't doesn't do
[28:41] things according to my expectations i
[28:44] never want to be in a place where i quit
[28:46] expecting him to do the miraculous
[28:48] [Applause]
[28:49] i want to be an expectation every moment
[28:53] of every day for the hand of god to move
[28:55] understanding that god doesn't have to
[28:57] do it according to my expectation but i
[29:00] will never lose expectation for him to
[29:02] do the miraculous
[29:04] any way he chooses and any time
[29:06] and any time he decides in any manner
[29:09] possible i'm still expecting him to move
[29:12] i'm expecting him to heal i'm expecting
[29:14] him to deliver i'm expecting him to
[29:16] protect i'm expecting him to show his
[29:18] hand mighty i'm expecting him all the
[29:20] time
[29:22] knowing that he may not meet my
[29:23] expectations but i'm expecting him to
[29:25] move
[29:28] amen
[29:29] let's go to second kings and we'll just
[29:30] look at a couple places here like a
[29:32] bible study if we could
[29:39] second kings chapter five
[29:48] second kings chapter five and i'm going
[29:50] to start reading at verse nine
[29:54] so naaman came with his horses and with
[29:56] his chariot and stood at the door of the
[29:57] house of elijah and we all know this is
[29:59] naaman the syrian
[30:01] he's a general
[30:02] uh in the army
[30:05] in syria and he had leprosy and then he
[30:07] had a little maid that he had stolen in
[30:09] a campaign that was a servant a little
[30:11] maid out of israel
[30:13] and when she knew that the master had
[30:15] leprosy she told uh she told her
[30:17] mistress she said oh that he could go
[30:20] and see the prophet elisha in israel for
[30:22] he would heal him so this word got out
[30:25] and he came and now he's coming to
[30:27] elisha and it says so naaman came with
[30:29] his horses and with his chariot and
[30:31] stood at the door of the house of elisha
[30:33] and elisha sent a messenger to him
[30:34] saying go and wash in jordan seven times
[30:37] and thy flesh shall come again to thee
[30:39] and thou shall be clean
[30:41] but naaman was wroth and went away and
[30:43] said behold i thought he would surely
[30:45] come out to me and stand and call on the
[30:47] name of the lord his god
[30:49] and strike his hand over the place and
[30:51] recover the leper
[30:53] are not at abner and
[30:56] farper rivers of damascus better than
[30:58] all the waters of israel may i not wash
[31:00] in them and be clean so he turned and
[31:02] went away in rage
[31:05] so here naaman come down with his horses
[31:07] and with his chariots so naaman's an
[31:09] important person he's a mighty man where
[31:11] he comes with wealth he comes with gifts
[31:13] he comes with a with a train with with
[31:16] servants with whatever so it's an
[31:18] impressive showing he's coming in an
[31:20] oppressive way to this great prophet
[31:23] who's going to heal him and he's so used
[31:25] to pomp and he's so used to uh
[31:27] performances and he's so used to being
[31:29] in the royal palace and in the courts
[31:31] he's got a certain expectation
[31:34] and like us he's always expecting god to
[31:37] do super duper big things amen but the
[31:39] prophet of god says great things are
[31:41] silent amen god evaporates millions of
[31:45] gallons or billions or trillions of
[31:47] gallons of water off the earth every day
[31:49] and never makes a noise he said the
[31:50] earth turns and you never hear it creak
[31:53] you know nothing ever happens and so
[31:55] it's not it's not always the way we
[31:57] think it's going to come we have in our
[31:59] mind our expectation and naaman had an
[32:02] expectation and the prophet of god sent
[32:04] a messenger out to him to tell him
[32:07] exactly what to do to be healed he was
[32:10] getting an exact answer to his request
[32:12] and he was going to get a perfect
[32:13] healing
[32:15] a perfect healing according to his
[32:18] desire but because it didn't come the
[32:20] way he expected it he was angry instead
[32:23] of happy
[32:26] oh what a lesson friends how many times
[32:28] our disappointment turns into
[32:29] frustration because something didn't
[32:31] happen the way we wanted it but god was
[32:33] doing exactly what we asked him to do
[32:36] but he was doing it in such a humble
[32:39] unique different way than what we
[32:41] expected we didn't recognize that this
[32:43] was healing
[32:45] this man he thought what does it matter
[32:47] jordan what does it matter muddy george
[32:50] what do you mean dip in jordan yeah this
[32:52] has nothing to do with anything you know
[32:54] we have a we have a question on our mind
[32:56] or a desire from god and god comes in
[32:59] and waylays our plan brings something
[33:01] else on the scene what in the world now
[33:03] i got to deal with this problem why is
[33:05] this happening when i'm in already in
[33:07] this situation and not recognizing that
[33:09] the new problem is bringing the solution
[33:11] to the first problem
[33:15] but we become roth and disappointed and
[33:18] angry because we have another trouble or
[33:20] another trial or i thought god would
[33:22] just come down and boom it would all be
[33:25] over
[33:27] but he was angry
[33:29] verse 12 or verse 13 and a servant came
[33:32] near and spake unto him and said my
[33:34] father if the prophet had bid thee do
[33:36] some great thing would thou not have
[33:38] done it
[33:39] how much rather than when he saith to
[33:41] thee wash and be clean
[33:43] then when he down and dipped himself
[33:44] seven times
[33:46] and the man
[33:47] dipped himself
[33:49] seven times in jordan according to the
[33:51] saying of the man of god and his flesh
[33:54] came again like unto the flesh of a
[33:56] little child and he was clean
[33:59] when he dropped his expectation and just
[34:01] took what was in front of him he got a
[34:04] perfect healing and in this situation if
[34:07] we can just drop our expectation now god
[34:09] smashed our expectation it's done it's
[34:11] over with forget the expectation but now
[34:14] god's doing something now there's
[34:16] something before us we can fight against
[34:18] it or we can say god's doing something i
[34:21] don't understand what he's doing but
[34:22] every step of the way as he leads me i
[34:24] want to walk with humility and reverence
[34:27] and i want to walk joyfully amen because
[34:30] he's doing something
[34:32] i don't understand it it didn't come to
[34:34] my expectation but i don't want to be
[34:35] disappointed i don't want to grumble and
[34:37] complain i don't want to begin to throw
[34:39] away all the confidence that i've had
[34:41] that got me to this point
[34:44] you know god has been so perfect all the
[34:47] way through he has led us so perfectly
[34:49] to get us to the spot that we're in now
[34:52] amen and we were joyful rejoicing two
[34:54] weeks ago because we saw service after
[34:57] service perfection and god coming in and
[35:00] preaching the word in such a way it was
[35:01] hitting the perfect spot and we were so
[35:04] happy but god was actually preparing us
[35:06] for this not to be happy during that
[35:08] service
[35:10] the service wasn't coming to bring joy
[35:12] during the preaching the service was
[35:14] coming to give instruction for today
[35:17] and we were happy then but let's not
[35:19] throw away the confidence of what god
[35:22] has done just because of the
[35:24] the missed expectation that we have now
[35:28] so now now's the time to say you know
[35:30] what god didn't do what i thought he
[35:32] would do but he's doing what he always
[35:33] thought he would do
[35:36] and there was a time that i was in his
[35:38] thoughts
[35:39] and in his thoughts we had fellowship
[35:41] and i knew what he would do and i was
[35:42] happy with the plan then
[35:45] i was confident it was correct i saw the
[35:47] plan of redemption and i shouted for joy
[35:50] with the sons of god amen i clapped and
[35:52] sang praises because i agreed with his
[35:54] plan then when i was an attribute in his
[35:57] thinking and i want to say down in my
[35:59] soul i agree with his plan now
[36:02] i don't understand his plan in my human
[36:04] mind my human flesh doesn't want to walk
[36:07] this way i don't want one person in the
[36:09] assembly to suffer i don't want people
[36:11] to be offended because of our actions i
[36:13] don't want the community and the medical
[36:14] staff to feel like we didn't care i
[36:16] don't want any of those consequences but
[36:19] i agreed with his plan then and i agree
[36:21] with his plan now
[36:23] don't understand it many people
[36:26] misunderstand
[36:28] why we've done what we've done
[36:30] but god doesn't misunderstand
[36:34] there's a leadership of the holy ghost
[36:36] that's more important
[36:39] than the leadership of mind common sense
[36:42] science or reasoning
[36:45] we haven't walked so far in faith now
[36:48] that we're going to allow reasoning and
[36:50] science to dictate our only actions from
[36:51] here on out
[36:53] i won't do that regardless of how
[36:56] difficult things are regardless of how
[36:59] how wrong my thinking was and how
[37:01] inaccurate my idea was i'm not going to
[37:04] go just because god didn't meet my
[37:07] expectations and what i thought and
[37:09] first saw what happened didn't happen
[37:10] the way i thought and foresaw it i'm not
[37:13] going to run to the side of reasoning
[37:15] and science amen to make all our
[37:17] decisions from here on out
[37:20] because reasoning and science is going
[37:22] to go one way
[37:24] and that's in the satan civilization
[37:27] no matter what happens we've got to
[37:28] continue to walk by faith in the
[37:30] leadership of the holy ghost even if it
[37:32] makes no sense and even if nobody else
[37:35] around us agrees with what we're doing
[37:38] it's not we can't make everybody happy i
[37:41] just want to make one happy
[37:43] and that's my father that's in heaven
[37:45] the situation is is difficult
[37:49] things are
[37:50] not fun
[37:52] they're heartbreaking
[37:53] we're grieving we're praying
[37:56] night after night all night i've been in
[37:58] prayer
[37:59] i haven't slept through the night
[38:02] for over a week i haven't slept more
[38:05] than just a few hours at a time
[38:07] one night and over a week i've got seven
[38:09] hours sleep because i'm interceding on
[38:11] behalf of brethren all night long
[38:14] this is not where we want to be
[38:16] but it's where he wants us to be
[38:20] and we're willing to go his path
[38:22] even if it's different than our path
[38:28] you know
[38:31] abraham had an expectation
[38:34] when god spoke to him and said you're
[38:36] going to have a son
[38:37] his expectation was immediately he was
[38:40] going to have a son
[38:42] but after waiting so many years and not
[38:44] having the son that he expected to have
[38:47] his wife began to have a doubt about how
[38:50] it would come so she she had an
[38:53] expectation and her expectation was that
[38:56] god wants us to do something ourselves
[38:59] that god gave us his prophecy and and
[39:01] god expects us we can't just sit around
[39:04] forever we got a little something we
[39:05] need to do
[39:07] that's been the failure of the church
[39:09] that was the failure of eve that's been
[39:11] the failure of the of the of the church
[39:13] ages is that we got to do a little
[39:14] something ourselves and so she thought
[39:17] well well i think what would be best
[39:18] brother branham explains this in detail
[39:20] is to take hagar my maid because it's
[39:22] legal then it's it's okay according to
[39:24] the law amen and take her and then
[39:26] she'll bear a son unto me and that's how
[39:28] we'll fulfill the promise and because of
[39:30] the waiting and because of the missed
[39:32] expectation and not having a son right
[39:34] away amen abraham gave in to his wife
[39:36] and they fulfilled their plan and it was
[39:38] the wrong idea
[39:41] it was reasoning it was reasoning and it
[39:44] failed to produce the promised son but
[39:46] god's plan never stopped one drop just
[39:49] because they did wrong
[39:52] just because they had the wrong idea and
[39:54] move forward in the wrong idea god's
[39:56] god's plan didn't miss one click in the
[39:59] cog
[40:00] at the right appointed time the right
[40:03] appointed woman in the right season
[40:05] conceived seed from the right man and
[40:07] brought forth the promised son according
[40:09] to what god's plan always was
[40:13] and then when god asked him to to slay
[40:15] that son
[40:17] take him up and slay him in the hill
[40:19] where i told you abraham now has learned
[40:23] he has learned
[40:24] that what god says do what god says
[40:27] he learned it through the circumstances
[40:29] with his with his father through the
[40:30] circumstances with lot he's learned to
[40:33] do what god says and so god says slay
[40:35] your son he's going to slay his son but
[40:37] he also had so much confidence in the
[40:39] word of god and the promise of god that
[40:41] if god promised by isaac shall my seed
[40:43] be called that god's going to do
[40:45] something to preserve the life of isaac
[40:48] so now
[40:50] abraham is stuck between two words of
[40:53] god
[40:55] one that says
[40:56] by thy son isaac shall thy seed be
[40:58] called
[40:59] and slay thy son thine only son and
[41:02] abraham finds himself smack dab between
[41:05] two
[41:06] spoken words of god
[41:09] what do you do when you get in that spot
[41:11] pick which one you're gonna no he
[41:12] couldn't pick either they both have to
[41:15] be true how are they true i don't know
[41:17] how they're true but he's so confident
[41:19] that both are true that he's confident
[41:21] he will kill his son but he's confident
[41:23] that out of isaac shall the seed be
[41:25] called
[41:26] so much so that the two lads that are
[41:28] coming with them and bearing the stuff
[41:30] he tells the servants he said the lad
[41:31] and i will go and worship yonder and
[41:33] return
[41:35] the lad and i will go and return but if
[41:38] you pick up the story in hebrews i'll
[41:40] read it to you here hebrews 11 17
[41:43] says by faith abraham when he was tried
[41:45] offered up isaac and he that had
[41:48] received the promises offered up his
[41:49] only begotten son
[41:51] of whom it was said that in isaac shall
[41:53] thy seed be called accounting that god
[41:56] was able to raise him up even from the
[41:58] dead from whence also he received him in
[42:00] a figure so abraham had an expectation
[42:04] when he went up to mount moriah to slay
[42:06] he knew he was going to keep the word of
[42:08] god and he knew he's going to kill isaac
[42:10] but he knew and isaac shall his seed be
[42:12] called
[42:13] seed be called so he assumed in his mind
[42:16] that god would raise him from the dead
[42:18] and that was never god's plan it was
[42:21] never god's plan to raise him from the
[42:22] dead it was always god's plan to show
[42:25] himself jehovah jireh and provide a lamb
[42:27] as a substitute for the sacrifice
[42:30] but abraham didn't know that part of the
[42:32] plan he wasn't told that part of the
[42:34] plan all he knew was to move forward
[42:37] with what i know i know and isaac is my
[42:40] seed called i know that he told me to
[42:42] slay him so
[42:44] reasonably thinking he's going to raise
[42:46] him from the dead
[42:48] but god wasn't depending on abraham's
[42:50] reason and abraham's wrong reasoning
[42:53] never stopped the plan of god amen as
[42:55] long as he just stayed obedient to what
[42:57] god said he could have the wrong idea
[42:59] about how god's going to perform it but
[43:01] god will still perform it as long as
[43:04] abraham stays obedient to the part he
[43:06] knows to stay obedient to
[43:08] so you see what i'm saying friends all
[43:10] we got to do is walk in full obedience
[43:12] to the revealed word of god and there's
[43:14] portions that we don't understand
[43:16] there's portions that we cannot figure
[43:18] out and even if we think wrong about it
[43:21] it doesn't matter god's still going to
[43:22] do what god's going to do if we just
[43:24] stay obedient to what he told us to do
[43:28] everything he says do if we'll do he'll
[43:30] worry about the rest even if he does it
[43:33] different than the way we thought and
[43:35] even if the way we thought is totally
[43:37] wrong it doesn't matter
[43:40] we just have to walk in obedience
[43:44] don't throw away that confidence abraham
[43:47] got to a place where god had given him
[43:49] the promised son through sarah his wife
[43:52] amen he worked the miraculous he did it
[43:54] he can't throw that confidence away now
[43:57] he's got to say hey god's going to do
[43:59] what he whatever he's going to do he's
[44:00] going to do but it doesn't change the
[44:02] promise
[44:03] it doesn't change the word that he told
[44:05] me
[44:06] amen when what god has told us
[44:09] the promises that he's made to us is not
[44:10] going to change
[44:12] the circumstances don't change the
[44:14] promise
[44:17] things get worse it doesn't change the
[44:21] brother brandon said if i prayed and if
[44:24] everybody i prayed for tonight died
[44:28] he said i'd come back the next day and
[44:31] have a healing line and pray for the
[44:32] sick
[44:35] why he said because the promise is true
[44:38] and the circumstances don't change the
[44:40] promise
[44:42] god's promised to bless us and prosper
[44:44] us but if we go through a time and trial
[44:47] of losing money in a time of trial of
[44:50] losing prosperity it doesn't change that
[44:52] promise
[44:53] he still promised to bless us and
[44:55] prosper us he will in his own good time
[44:57] but if he allows a trial to come to look
[45:00] like you're moving in the opposite of
[45:01] this word don't worry about it this word
[45:04] is still true
[45:06] if he promised to heal you and it looks
[45:08] like you get sicker don't be discouraged
[45:10] believe the promised word god will do
[45:13] what god promised he will do
[45:15] just trust in him whatever the outcome
[45:18] trust in him
[45:20] don't throw away the confidence that we
[45:21] have he's led us this far
[45:24] he can do things we never expected him
[45:26] to do he can do things we never wanted
[45:27] him to do but he still knows what he's
[45:29] doing
[45:31] he's smarter than we are
[45:35] he just wants obedience
[45:37] he just wants children that learn to
[45:39] walk
[45:40] according to his word
[45:43] and if he does something in an
[45:44] unexpected way
[45:46] we'll say well bless god anyways
[45:49] if he does something we don't want him
[45:50] to do we say we bless god
[45:53] anyways
[45:55] he does something that hurts we say we
[45:57] bless god anyways
[45:59] for god is god
[46:03] let's look at matthew chapter 3 together
[46:05] i just want to look at a couple more of
[46:06] these
[46:08] we haven't been together in a while so
[46:10] let's just stay together
[46:12] it feels good to be together in the word
[46:24] matthew chapter 3.
[46:31] verse 11.
[46:36] this is uh john the baptist now
[46:38] preaching he says i indeed baptize you
[46:40] with water unto repentance but he that
[46:43] cometh after me is mightier than i whose
[46:45] shoes i am not worthy to bear
[46:48] he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[46:50] and with fire whose fan is in his hand
[46:52] and he will thoroughly purge the floor
[46:54] and gather his wheat into the garner but
[46:56] he will burn up the chaff with
[46:57] unquenchable fire
[46:59] so john the baptist is the prophet of
[47:01] the age
[47:02] and the prophet of the age is now giving
[47:04] the prophecy for that age and he's
[47:06] talking about the coming messiahs coming
[47:08] about jesus christ that he's going to
[47:10] bow i'm baptizing with water under
[47:11] repentance but he's going to baptise you
[47:13] with the holy ghost and fire and his fan
[47:15] is in his hand and he'll thoroughly
[47:16] purge his dressing floor and he's going
[47:18] to burn up the chaff
[47:20] that's a prophecy he's laying out a
[47:22] prophecy but john's going to take his
[47:24] own idea about that prophecy
[47:28] and john is the prophet of the age the
[47:30] one to give the prophecy a seed gene of
[47:33] god but he's going to take his own idea
[47:34] about that prophecy
[47:36] let's go over to matthew chapter 11.
[47:38] [Music]
[47:44] matthew chapter 11 verse 2.
[47:52] now when john had heard in the prison
[47:53] the works of christ he sent two of his
[47:55] disciples and said unto him art thou he
[47:57] that should come or do we look for
[47:59] another
[48:00] john was the one who was the forerunner
[48:02] to declare he coming he saw the spirit
[48:04] like a dove descending out of heaven and
[48:06] lighting up on christ he's saying this
[48:08] is him he baptized him amen he fulfilled
[48:10] that word he's the one who gave the
[48:12] prophecy amen but because jesus ministry
[48:16] didn't match his expectation of jesus
[48:18] ministry he began to question whether he
[48:21] was the one or not or do we look for
[48:22] another and he sent two of his disciples
[48:24] and brother bam said see his eagle eye
[48:26] got filmed over he wasn't backslidden he
[48:29] wasn't he wasn't the eagle of the age he
[48:31] was no long he wasn't that he wasn't a
[48:33] child of god amen he was he his eagle
[48:36] eye got filmed over because his own
[48:38] reasoning his own understanding amen had
[48:42] had hid from his view the fulfillment of
[48:44] the word
[48:46] because jesus did miracles that day and
[48:48] he says now you go tell john i'm
[48:51] fulfilling these scriptures
[48:53] the lame walk the blind see the gospel
[48:56] is preaching to the poor what's he doing
[48:58] he was fulfilling the word and telling
[49:00] him go say you saw the fulfillment of
[49:02] the word so that he'll know this is
[49:03] still the word being fulfilled just not
[49:06] the portion that he thought was for now
[49:10] praise be to god amen this is how god
[49:12] trains his children and if it can happen
[49:14] to john the baptist can it happen to you
[49:16] and i
[49:17] absolutely
[49:19] and so
[49:20] brother baby says in modern events are
[49:21] made clear by prophecy he said john's
[49:23] eagle eye had been filmed over and he
[49:25] was in the prison he was fixing to die
[49:27] said go ask him
[49:29] see john said oh his fan is in his hand
[49:31] he'll thoroughly purge his floor he
[49:33] thought the millennium would start right
[49:35] then
[49:36] he thought the grain was ready but it
[49:38] had to die and go to the stalk and come
[49:40] up again to make the true bride
[49:43] john thought it was ready john thought
[49:45] because he was there messiah was here
[49:47] everything's in place it's going to
[49:49] happen just like this and when the
[49:51] millennium didn't set in like he thought
[49:53] all of a sudden he began to wonder is
[49:56] this him or do we look for another
[50:00] right
[50:01] jesus never condemned john
[50:06] jesus performed a sign before the word
[50:07] and said go tell him the word
[50:10] go show him the fulfillment of the word
[50:11] because john's in the lexi he'll
[50:13] understand the fulfillment of the word
[50:16] he didn't pet him he didn't baby him he
[50:18] didn't condemn him
[50:20] he just showed him the word
[50:22] children of god are led by the word of
[50:24] god
[50:25] they respond to the word of god
[50:27] let's look at matthew 16 together
[50:36] matthew 16 and 21
[50:43] from that time forth began jesus to show
[50:45] unto his disciples how that he must go
[50:47] into jerusalem and suffer many things of
[50:49] the elders and chief priests and scribes
[50:51] and be killed and be raised again the
[50:52] third day then peter took him and began
[50:55] to rebuke him saying be it far from thee
[50:57] lord this shall not be unto thee
[51:01] but he turned and said unto peter get
[51:02] thee behind me satan thou are an offense
[51:05] unto me for thou savers not the things
[51:07] that be of god but the things that be
[51:10] of man of men
[51:13] jesus was the word made flesh
[51:16] and he was speaking the word
[51:18] but because peter had something else in
[51:21] his mind
[51:23] peter's refusing the word coming from
[51:25] the word
[51:27] because peter wants something else to
[51:29] happen
[51:30] peter wants jesus to set up his earthly
[51:32] kingdom then because peter's part of it
[51:34] already
[51:36] peter's in the inside and peter's going
[51:38] to get a position
[51:40] and peter wants certain portions of the
[51:42] word to be fulfilled right now
[51:45] but god wasn't doing it right then there
[51:48] was another portion of the word that had
[51:49] to be fulfilled first
[51:52] let's go to luke
[51:54] 24.
[52:01] luke 24 and 19.
[52:05] this is the road to emmaus
[52:07] cleopas and his friend are walking along
[52:10] talking in verse 19
[52:13] it says and he said unto them what
[52:14] things jesus had drawn up alongside he
[52:16] heard them talking and he said unto them
[52:18] what things and they said unto him
[52:20] concerning jesus of nazareth which was a
[52:21] prophet mighty indeed and word before
[52:23] god and all the people now the chief
[52:25] priests and our rulers delivered him to
[52:27] be condemned to death and have crucified
[52:29] him but we trusted that it had been he
[52:32] which should have redeemed israel and
[52:34] beside all this today is the third day
[52:36] since these things were done yea and
[52:38] certain women also of our company made
[52:40] us astonish which were early at the
[52:41] sepulcher and when they found not his
[52:44] body they they came saying that they had
[52:46] also seen a vision of angels which said
[52:49] that he was alive and certain of them
[52:51] which were with us went to the sepulcher
[52:52] and found it even so as the women had
[52:54] said but him they saw not
[52:58] he said jesus is walking alongside of
[53:00] him he's in another form now
[53:03] he says what things in the beginning
[53:04] describe you know concerning jesus of
[53:06] nazareth who was killed we had thought
[53:09] verse 21 we but we trusted that it had
[53:12] been he
[53:13] they were trusting that it was him but
[53:15] because of the circumstances they lost
[53:18] faith in what they believed
[53:20] and they were right it says and we
[53:23] trusted that it had been he which should
[53:25] have redeemed israel he was the one to
[53:28] redeem israel they just saw the act of
[53:30] redemption they had the right word they
[53:32] were correct in what they believed but
[53:35] because they expected it to happen in a
[53:37] different way now they threw away the
[53:40] very word that they were believing and
[53:42] the fulfillment of the word because it
[53:43] didn't happen according to their
[53:45] expectations
[53:47] oh friends if that could happen to the
[53:49] disciples what about you and i
[53:53] we can't throw away everything god's
[53:55] done because things don't happen the way
[53:57] we want we've got to stand still and see
[53:59] the salvation of our god
[54:00] [Music]
[54:02] when the pillar of fire come to rescue
[54:04] the children of israel in exodus they
[54:06] had a prophet they had a pillar of fire
[54:08] they had signs and wonders they had
[54:10] plagues they had everything that
[54:11] happened and they went out with a mighty
[54:13] hand and who knows what their
[54:15] expectation was but you can put yourself
[54:16] in their spot
[54:18] in bondage for 400 years in hard bondage
[54:20] for the last several years crying out as
[54:22] a nation to be delivered all of a sudden
[54:24] a mighty deliverer comes all the turmoil
[54:26] surrounded it's going to be free then it
[54:28] gets harder and then plagues and you're
[54:30] subject to the plagues then a
[54:32] distinction and then a mighty spoiling i
[54:34] mean the emotions were all over the
[54:36] place
[54:38] but when they finally went out they went
[54:39] out of victorious army spoiled all the
[54:42] goods of israel went out free amen went
[54:45] out of people with robes and silk and
[54:47] linen and and gold and jewels and and
[54:50] all of these things they went out and
[54:51] they were told specifically i have given
[54:55] you a land that flows with milk and
[54:57] honey and i will send at the be in
[54:59] before you and drive the inhabitants out
[55:02] and the cities are already built the
[55:04] houses are built the vineyards are
[55:05] planted the crops are in the ground
[55:09] and all of it was true
[55:12] but god didn't tell him the whole story
[55:15] he only told them part of it and that
[55:18] part was true but he reserved a part
[55:21] back because god has to teach them to
[55:23] walk by faith
[55:26] they they they i imagine they could have
[55:28] walked out of there and said now
[55:30] everything's looking up now
[55:33] finally 400 years of bondage these last
[55:36] few months with all these plagues weeks
[55:38] months however long it took all of this
[55:41] finally we're going out and look what
[55:42] all we got
[55:45] now let's just march up there by the
[55:47] time we get there the bees the hornets
[55:49] would have driven out all the
[55:50] inhabitants and we can just take all of
[55:51] our new jewels and all of our new
[55:53] furniture that we got from our neighbors
[55:55] and we can just move it into our new
[55:56] houses that are already built
[55:59] and then i'll just pluck some grapes off
[56:01] of the of the vine that's already
[56:03] planted
[56:05] you see their expectation was wrong but
[56:07] the word was right
[56:10] the word was true the expectation was
[56:12] wrong
[56:13] they were going to get there
[56:15] but they were going to be trained first
[56:18] they were going to endure hardness first
[56:20] they were going to have things go
[56:21] backwards upside down in every which way
[56:23] first to prove them to teach them to
[56:26] train them and then when they crossed
[56:28] into the land they were going to fight
[56:30] for every inch weren't they walled
[56:31] cities yes were the vineyards planted
[56:33] yes was the corn growing yes did it flow
[56:36] with milk and honey yes were there
[56:38] already houses built yes but it wasn't a
[56:40] walk in and take it amen that's the
[56:43] expectation and when they didn't meet
[56:45] the expectation they began to grumble
[56:47] and cry and complain to moses
[56:51] you said it's better if we stayed in
[56:53] egypt this blah blah blah blah blah
[56:56] why it'd be not because god lied
[57:00] not because moses lied not because the
[57:02] pillar of fire led one wrong step not
[57:05] because god wasn't faithful in every way
[57:08] amen they grumbled and complained and
[57:09] they fussed and they moaned and they
[57:11] were afraid because it didn't happen
[57:13] according to their expectations
[57:16] and all of a sudden what was joy turned
[57:19] in the morning
[57:20] in half a second
[57:24] they come
[57:26] the pillar of fire
[57:28] leading a victorious group of people
[57:30] freed from bondage by a mighty hand
[57:33] having destroyed egypt and spoiled them
[57:36] that pillar of fire leads them right to
[57:38] a trap
[57:41] but it was still the pillar of fire that
[57:43] did it
[57:45] he's still the pillar of fire
[57:47] i don't care if it's a trap
[57:49] he's the pillar of fire
[57:51] there's nothing to be afraid of
[57:53] if you're following the pillar of fire
[57:56] they saw the egyptian army coming down
[57:59] and they were finished and reasonably
[58:01] speaking there was no hope
[58:03] reasonably speaking
[58:06] that's why we can't rely on reasoning
[58:09] their their eyes their senses their mind
[58:12] could not find a way of escape
[58:16] what they saw as the dust cloud was
[58:19] rolling of the 600 chariots coming down
[58:23] the thunder they began to hear rolling
[58:25] on the horse's hoes pounding towards
[58:27] them
[58:28] they looked around they could see the
[58:30] cliffs they could see the the red sea
[58:33] they could see the only path of escape
[58:35] their eyes
[58:36] were lying to them
[58:41] their ears were lying to them their
[58:44] thoughts were deceiving them because the
[58:46] pillar of fire had led them there and
[58:48] said that he would take him all the way
[58:50] they had to deny sight
[58:52] sound thought feel they had to deny it
[58:55] all and choose to believe god's word
[58:59] and moses was willing because god had
[59:01] told him amen you're going to see this
[59:04] army you see you'll see no more amen he
[59:06] told him that he was going to harden his
[59:07] heart and he was going to destroy
[59:08] pharaoh and he looked at them and he
[59:10] says stand still
[59:13] don't run don't fret don't fuss stand
[59:17] still and see the salvation of god
[59:21] now having done all to stand stand
[59:25] amen do you have the armor on stand
[59:27] do you have the helmet of salvation the
[59:29] breast plate of rice is your feet shot
[59:30] with the preparation of the gospel do
[59:32] you do you have the sword of the spirit
[59:34] i mean do you have have you been have
[59:36] you been prepared as an army have you
[59:38] been equipped by the word of god have
[59:40] you been clothed by the armor of god and
[59:42] given the sword now it's time to stand
[59:44] still and see the salvation of god it's
[59:47] not time to fret and run around it's not
[59:49] time to let discouragement rob us of our
[59:51] faith you can't help being discouraged
[59:53] but you've got to cast down
[59:54] discouragement and cast down reasoning
[59:57] and take every thought that exalted
[59:58] itself against the knowledge of christ
[1:00:00] and bring it into captivity and
[1:00:02] obedience to christ and say god has not
[1:00:04] forsaken us god has not forgot us god
[1:00:07] has not led us into a death trap god has
[1:00:10] led us to the place he wants us to be
[1:00:12] and whatever we have to go through in
[1:00:14] this place is what he has determined
[1:00:17] and i want nothing more than to be found
[1:00:19] faithful at this hour
[1:00:22] i want to stand and see the salvation of
[1:00:24] god it may not look like we expect it to
[1:00:26] look like but will be his salvation
[1:00:33] brother brahma says
[1:00:35] referring to this road to emmaus
[1:00:38] so they went along the road oak cleopas
[1:00:41] said his friend i tell you i'm
[1:00:43] discouraged this morning but how could
[1:00:45] that man ever die
[1:00:47] cleopas he died i seen him dying
[1:00:50] he said can we just put ourselves in the
[1:00:52] disciples spot
[1:00:54] they saw this man walk on water
[1:00:58] they saw him take the loaves and fishes
[1:01:00] and break them with their very eyes they
[1:01:01] saw moore grow back they saw the
[1:01:04] fragments gathered up they saw the
[1:01:06] multitude that was fed
[1:01:08] for us we read it in a few lines they
[1:01:10] lived it they saw the hungry people they
[1:01:13] knew that it was impossible to feed them
[1:01:15] and they saw the little humble man just
[1:01:17] say a quiet prayer and take and break
[1:01:20] and break and break and and feed and
[1:01:22] feed and feed they saw them sitting by
[1:01:24] groups of 50s and groups of hundreds all
[1:01:26] over as far as the eye could see
[1:01:30] they saw a storm rise up that was going
[1:01:33] to kill them but they saw a man come
[1:01:35] walking on the water and as soon as he
[1:01:37] stepped into the boat it calmed and they
[1:01:39] found himself on the other side
[1:01:42] they saw a man who they wanted to take
[1:01:44] and stone and cast him off of precipice
[1:01:46] but they saw him turn invisible in a
[1:01:48] moment and walked past through the cloud
[1:01:50] crowd where they never saw him
[1:01:53] they saw him speak to the lame and they
[1:01:55] walked they saw him a woman touch his
[1:01:57] garment and be healed they thought he
[1:02:00] was invincible and could never be
[1:02:02] destroyed
[1:02:03] if you walked with a man like that for
[1:02:05] years what would you think
[1:02:07] i'd stay real close to that man
[1:02:10] i can't fault people for believing that
[1:02:11] brother branham would raise from the
[1:02:13] dead
[1:02:13] if you had walked like some of them
[1:02:15] walked to the brother branham and seen
[1:02:17] and heard what they had seen you would
[1:02:18] have believed for anything at that
[1:02:20] moment
[1:02:22] and these men walked with jesus christ
[1:02:24] saw the miracles heard the preaching and
[1:02:26] then saw what had happened and here they
[1:02:29] can't believe that he died because they
[1:02:31] never expected him to die but his death
[1:02:34] was not outside the word
[1:02:36] not outside the plan of god but outside
[1:02:39] of their own thinking
[1:02:43] oh i hope we can learn the lessons
[1:02:46] no matter what we see
[1:02:48] we gotta we gotta remember who we are
[1:02:52] do you have a revelation of who you are
[1:02:54] and do you have a revelation of whom
[1:02:57] whom you belong to
[1:03:00] if we have a revelation of who we are
[1:03:02] and who we belong to then i say stand
[1:03:04] still and see the salvation of god
[1:03:06] because he's not forgotten he knows
[1:03:08] exactly who we are and where we are and
[1:03:11] we know that he's our father we know
[1:03:13] we're his child and that revelation
[1:03:15] should bring a peace deep down inside
[1:03:17] maybe not to your mind but deep down
[1:03:19] inside there's something that says he's
[1:03:21] not left me he's not forsaken me he's
[1:03:23] not forgotten me but all is well
[1:03:26] all is well
[1:03:29] it may not be the way i want it
[1:03:31] but all is well
[1:03:33] he said he died back to this quote again
[1:03:36] i seen him dying i seen the sun go down
[1:03:39] i seen the stars refused to shine i know
[1:03:41] he died i seen the soldier ram the
[1:03:43] spirit through his heart he died and i
[1:03:45] know he's dead and how could he do it he
[1:03:48] trusted in him that we we trusted in him
[1:03:51] that he would be the great messiah that
[1:03:52] should take and mul and and would mold
[1:03:55] all of our spears and pruning hooks and
[1:03:57] go out and the romans would be finished
[1:03:59] and the world would be trampled down and
[1:04:00] he'd rule it with a rod of iron and he
[1:04:03] sat on david's throne and there he is
[1:04:05] laying up there in a grave how can it be
[1:04:07] they just couldn't understand it
[1:04:10] you know what they were believing in
[1:04:12] they were believing in the word
[1:04:17] pounding their pruning hooks
[1:04:19] their spears and the pruning hooks
[1:04:23] they were believing the prophecy
[1:04:26] but they were believing the prophecy out
[1:04:28] of sequence
[1:04:32] there's nothing wrong with them
[1:04:33] believing the prophecy
[1:04:35] that's good they should have believed in
[1:04:37] it he's the messiah and the messiah will
[1:04:40] do these things that's exactly right the
[1:04:42] messiah will do all of those things they
[1:04:44] believed he would do but they didn't
[1:04:45] realize the corner wheat must first go
[1:04:47] into the ground and die or to bite alone
[1:04:49] and then the process of the bright tree
[1:04:51] being cut down and restored they didn't
[1:04:53] understand that part but what they
[1:04:55] believed was a hundred percent true and
[1:04:57] they were good believers for believing
[1:04:59] it
[1:05:02] but they didn't realize the process that
[1:05:04] would come to that he is the messiah
[1:05:07] that would bring the millennium without
[1:05:09] a doubt
[1:05:10] they just wanted to get that part over
[1:05:12] here
[1:05:16] i don't even fault them for that
[1:05:20] what god faulted them for is not
[1:05:21] believing all that he said
[1:05:25] jesus never faulted them for believing
[1:05:28] that that would happen
[1:05:30] and believing he'd be the great general
[1:05:32] that would defeat all the armies he
[1:05:34] never condemned them for that he said oh
[1:05:36] fools of heart not to believe all that
[1:05:39] the prophets had said
[1:05:45] sometimes we get our own idea
[1:05:48] but praise god there's nothing wrong
[1:05:50] with believing the word
[1:05:52] believe it amen
[1:05:54] i
[1:05:54] i tell you what if if another worldwide
[1:05:57] deceased comes sweeping by you know what
[1:05:59] i'm going to believe it won't touch me
[1:06:02] i believe it won't touch me
[1:06:05] and if it touches me i believe he'll
[1:06:06] heal me
[1:06:09] and if he chooses to take me home i'll
[1:06:11] believe it was my time
[1:06:14] because we're believers
[1:06:15] we're children of god there's nothing
[1:06:18] wrong with believing in the full promise
[1:06:20] of god
[1:06:21] and knowing knowing that any of the
[1:06:23] above could happen to me but still i i
[1:06:26] would rather somebody believe that god
[1:06:29] will let it not touch them than be
[1:06:30] fearful and nervous and worried and say
[1:06:32] oh what if what if what if leave the
[1:06:34] what if to god just believe for the best
[1:06:38] believe when you get in your car and
[1:06:39] pull out believe that you're not going
[1:06:41] to have an accident
[1:06:44] believe that you're not going to fall in
[1:06:46] the financial ruin believe that you're
[1:06:48] not going to be hungry and begging for
[1:06:50] bread believe that you're not going to
[1:06:52] lose your job believe that you're not
[1:06:54] going to lose your house believe that
[1:06:56] your children are going to be saved and
[1:06:57] serve god believe just believe all of
[1:06:59] those things
[1:07:01] there's nothing wrong with believing all
[1:07:03] of it and if god does something
[1:07:05] different there's nothing wrong with
[1:07:06] believing that he would do that
[1:07:09] as long as we don't stop believing in
[1:07:11] him when he changes our expectation
[1:07:17] see
[1:07:18] the problem is
[1:07:21] they made the statement
[1:07:23] we trusted it had been
[1:07:26] that was the mistake
[1:07:28] that was the mistake
[1:07:30] not saying i don't understand i thought
[1:07:32] this would happen first but i know he's
[1:07:34] the messiah
[1:07:37] you see what i'm saying
[1:07:38] i know he's the messiah i know he
[1:07:40] fulfilled the word i know this is right
[1:07:42] but i don't understand why this didn't
[1:07:44] happen the way i thought it would happen
[1:07:45] i don't understand what's happening but
[1:07:47] i know he's right
[1:07:49] and i know he's the messiah and i know
[1:07:50] he's fulfilling the scriptures
[1:07:53] can we do that can we say i don't
[1:07:55] understand what's happening but i know
[1:07:56] i'm a son of god
[1:07:58] because that didn't change because my
[1:08:00] circumstances changed that didn't change
[1:08:01] because i'm now disappointed in what's
[1:08:03] happening that didn't change because i
[1:08:04] had the wrong idea about the future
[1:08:07] if i was ever a son of god i'm always
[1:08:08] the son of god i mean
[1:08:10] if i'm sealed i'm sealed until the day
[1:08:12] of my redemption i didn't lose my seal
[1:08:14] because i had the wrong idea
[1:08:16] or the wrong expectation so don't throw
[1:08:19] those things away but say you know what
[1:08:20] i didn't understand i didn't expect this
[1:08:23] but praise god anyhow he's god and i
[1:08:25] know he's doing something now
[1:08:27] he's still the messiah he's still the
[1:08:29] word he's still my father and i'm still
[1:08:31] his son
[1:08:34] he goes on to say
[1:08:37] no we finished that one they just
[1:08:39] couldn't understand it
[1:08:41] thought he would start the throne of
[1:08:42] david they just couldn't understand it
[1:08:44] but praise god we don't have to
[1:08:46] understand it
[1:08:47] we just have to believe him
[1:08:52] i want to read a quote to you
[1:08:55] from it is the rising of the sun
[1:08:58] talking about brother branham's trip
[1:09:00] he's here in the rising of the sun 1965
[1:09:02] in april when he's getting ready to go
[1:09:03] to africa
[1:09:05] and he had longed for years to get back
[1:09:07] to africa
[1:09:09] and listen what he says you all know
[1:09:10] where i'm going don't you africa i've
[1:09:12] called for a long time for years i've
[1:09:14] tried to get back
[1:09:16] now a vision the spirit of the lord has
[1:09:19] prepared the way
[1:09:21] listen to what he's saying this is going
[1:09:22] to be really important
[1:09:24] and a vision
[1:09:25] the spirit of the lord has prepared the
[1:09:27] way
[1:09:28] they said when those poor natives heard
[1:09:31] heard it they didn't come the lat that i
[1:09:33] didn't come the last time when i was
[1:09:34] there they laid on the ground day and
[1:09:36] night and moaned and cried saying lord
[1:09:37] what have we done thousands of them
[1:09:39] those people don't even believe they got
[1:09:41] a soul and they cried and they moan and
[1:09:43] they cry
[1:09:44] don't you send no word ahead please
[1:09:46] don't see if that visa would happen to
[1:09:48] go through there and get amongst the
[1:09:49] ministers they would stop me right there
[1:09:51] i have to go in as a hunter i'm going up
[1:09:53] to the queen that brought up 17 train
[1:09:55] loads down and come down to the meeting
[1:09:57] i get to go up and hunt on her territory
[1:09:59] and i go in my passport and everything
[1:10:01] calls for a hunter not a religious
[1:10:02] service
[1:10:03] then there's going to be one brother
[1:10:05] meet me say why don't you have a little
[1:10:07] meeting for us the stadiums are already
[1:10:09] ran and they don't even know it see oh
[1:10:11] glory
[1:10:13] pray that the will of god will not be
[1:10:14] hindered that my soul that's cried for
[1:10:16] africa since i've left may i be able to
[1:10:18] return again then bring you a message of
[1:10:21] a great meeting
[1:10:23] what do you think brother branham's
[1:10:24] expectation was
[1:10:28] because he had had a vision
[1:10:30] the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:10:33] and he had a plan
[1:10:35] they've already rented the auditorium
[1:10:38] i'm going in as a hunter
[1:10:41] boy this is slick
[1:10:43] he's got it all figured out
[1:10:45] i'm going in as a hunter my visa don't
[1:10:47] say no religion it just says hunter i'm
[1:10:49] going in with sydney jackson and then
[1:10:51] they've already got it and while i'm
[1:10:52] here he'll say oh won't you just have us
[1:10:54] a service
[1:10:55] it's perfect and when brother ben is
[1:10:56] preaching it he's getting really excited
[1:10:58] because he believes his plan is going to
[1:11:00] work and he believes it's the will of
[1:11:02] god
[1:11:03] are you convinced of that
[1:11:05] [Music]
[1:11:06] he comes back and the next time he
[1:11:08] preaches is july 11th
[1:11:10] ashamed
[1:11:13] he says
[1:11:14] i had planned on so hard coming back
[1:11:16] burned in my heart
[1:11:18] i just returned from africa as you all
[1:11:19] know and when i got over there i had a
[1:11:22] restricted visa and wouldn't let me
[1:11:24] wouldn't let me preach because it
[1:11:26] gathers too many together
[1:11:28] they're expecting an uprising there at
[1:11:29] any time and they wouldn't let me preach
[1:11:32] because of that gathering too many
[1:11:33] people together the only way i could
[1:11:37] would to have some organization that
[1:11:38] represented by the government in the
[1:11:40] government to invite me over then that
[1:11:41] would automatically let the government
[1:11:43] send out a militia for protection see
[1:11:45] there is just going to be an uprising
[1:11:47] and that's all there is to it it's just
[1:11:49] right in hand see that government man
[1:11:51] said the last time you was here you had
[1:11:53] about a quarter of a million people
[1:11:54] together and he said then you see that
[1:11:56] would just be the very thing that
[1:11:58] communism is looking for for an uprise
[1:12:00] so i couldn't preach
[1:12:02] brother branham just told us
[1:12:05] and it is the rising of the sun that
[1:12:07] he's going by a vision and the
[1:12:08] leadership of the lord
[1:12:11] and that he's going in as a hunter to
[1:12:12] sneak in
[1:12:14] don't let any of those ministers know
[1:12:16] don't let the word get out i've got a
[1:12:18] good plan i'm going to sneak it in on
[1:12:20] them
[1:12:22] auditoriums rent it he's going to say
[1:12:24] hey since you're here let's just have a
[1:12:25] meeting amen and right before he leaves
[1:12:28] he gets a restricted visa
[1:12:32] he goes on in the shame
[1:12:34] further on he says and so when i started
[1:12:36] to go over i'm telling you i never had
[1:12:38] so much trouble in all my life of trying
[1:12:40] to get there and then at the very last
[1:12:42] minute the very last minute to go there
[1:12:43] was a road across my visa i cannot
[1:12:46] anticipate in any kind of religious
[1:12:48] service can only come hunting
[1:12:50] right across his visa
[1:12:52] you know what brother branham did
[1:12:55] obeyed what the law said
[1:12:59] he went over there to preach the prophet
[1:13:02] of the age went over there to preach
[1:13:04] and he's got a scripture that says go
[1:13:06] into all nations
[1:13:07] preach the gospel but because caesar
[1:13:10] said don't do it he didn't do it
[1:13:12] and we find ourselves in that situation
[1:13:14] here we're allowed to preach and we're
[1:13:16] allowed to gather some but we're under
[1:13:18] restrictions we've got to do it a
[1:13:19] certain way
[1:13:20] and we're going to do it a certain way
[1:13:23] because that's the right thing to do
[1:13:25] but praise god we can still have people
[1:13:27] in the sanctuary and we can still preach
[1:13:30] thank god
[1:13:32] so anyways he says
[1:13:34] he goes on to say
[1:13:37] he said well then it was rank
[1:13:41] that's about how we would all feel
[1:13:44] but i said i don't care what the devil
[1:13:46] does i can't voucher for what brother
[1:13:48] jackson said about yellow main line and
[1:13:50] this that or the other i can't vouch it
[1:13:52] but i i do know god told me see sydney
[1:13:55] jackson and go hunting see that's the
[1:13:57] fulfillment of the
[1:13:58] vision but cindy jackson invited him on
[1:14:01] a hunting trip and brother branham was
[1:14:02] praying about getting back into africa
[1:14:04] and preached and when god said see
[1:14:06] sydney jackson and go hunting brother
[1:14:08] bran that's all god told him but brother
[1:14:10] branham assumed that meant to go back
[1:14:12] and preach
[1:14:15] so you can see how the man
[1:14:17] thought
[1:14:18] that yes this is i've been praying for
[1:14:21] years trying to get back in cindy
[1:14:23] jackson invites i'm laying before the
[1:14:24] lord what should i do and the lord tells
[1:14:26] him go sidney jackson go hunting and he
[1:14:30] says that's it i'm going back to preach
[1:14:32] now
[1:14:33] and that was never god's plan
[1:14:36] but god didn't condemn him for being a
[1:14:38] human and having his own idea
[1:14:44] see
[1:14:45] he said god told me see sydney jackson
[1:14:47] and go hunting and i said i'm going he
[1:14:49] said and sometime and i had one of the
[1:14:52] greatest trips
[1:14:54] he had one of the greatest trips
[1:14:57] i found out what the trouble was
[1:14:59] now now listen oh my
[1:15:03] this is going to be good friends
[1:15:07] he goes through this whole scenario
[1:15:08] where he's trying to get to africa he
[1:15:10] comes up with a plan he sneaks in god
[1:15:12] tells him by vision he's going to go
[1:15:14] hunting and that's to him that equals
[1:15:17] equals i got it figured out
[1:15:20] then be right before he leaves they
[1:15:22] stamp his passport can't participate in
[1:15:24] religious services hunting only and he
[1:15:26] says it was rank
[1:15:27] he says well i don't care what the devil
[1:15:29] says
[1:15:31] i'm going anyways because i can't vouch
[1:15:33] for what sidney said what his vision was
[1:15:35] or word of the lord i can only say one
[1:15:36] thing god said sea city jackson go
[1:15:38] hunting it's unclear what the devil says
[1:15:39] i'm going hunting anyways
[1:15:42] then he figures out what the problem was
[1:15:44] the government told him it wasn't
[1:15:46] because of what he preached
[1:15:48] it was because there was going to be an
[1:15:49] uprising there because of apartheid and
[1:15:52] the communist movement was moving in and
[1:15:54] stirring up the people and they didn't
[1:15:55] want to have big crowds gathered unless
[1:15:57] they could dispatch the militia and they
[1:15:59] couldn't do it unless a recognized
[1:16:00] organization sponsored him
[1:16:02] so he found out the reason why it wasn't
[1:16:05] just a religious persecution it was
[1:16:07] because of the situation in the country
[1:16:10] at the time
[1:16:13] so he says
[1:16:15] and i found out what the trouble was
[1:16:17] now look what he does next
[1:16:20] now i think about october the lord
[1:16:22] willing i can go back and have a meeting
[1:16:23] and everything
[1:16:26] now he starts planning another meeting
[1:16:29] because obviously god worked all of this
[1:16:32] out so i could figure out the problem
[1:16:34] solve it so i could come back and plan
[1:16:35] the meeting and go back and have the
[1:16:37] meeting i always wanted to have
[1:16:39] well guess what friends he never went
[1:16:41] back and he never had that meeting so
[1:16:43] what he thought was wrong
[1:16:47] but god didn't condemn him for it
[1:16:50] he said maybe october
[1:16:52] i can go back and have a meeting
[1:16:53] everything full cooperation everything
[1:16:55] else see in africa now i got to the
[1:16:57] bottom of it and found out where it was
[1:16:58] at and what caused it up here writing
[1:17:01] this one has got to say and something's
[1:17:03] got something to say and this one here
[1:17:05] the best thing to do is go find out
[1:17:07] yourself and i know what the trouble was
[1:17:09] and what the reason of it was and it was
[1:17:11] because of so many people gathering
[1:17:13] together the government wouldn't leave
[1:17:14] me
[1:17:15] let me have it
[1:17:17] now if the christian businessman any
[1:17:19] organization will bring us in then the
[1:17:21] government automatically because it's
[1:17:22] the organization is represented with the
[1:17:24] government the government sends militia
[1:17:26] protection if there would be 25 man out
[1:17:29] of one denomination 25 out of another
[1:17:31] still that wouldn't receive that it's
[1:17:33] got to be the head of the organization
[1:17:35] and the christian businessman is a
[1:17:37] non-sectarian organization representing
[1:17:39] all churches dr simon their head over
[1:17:41] there a very fine man i got to meet him
[1:17:43] and talk with him and they are taking
[1:17:45] the meetings and all the rest of the
[1:17:46] church is coming together see and i
[1:17:48] believe we'll have one of the greatest
[1:17:50] meetings that's been had in africa
[1:17:54] he believed
[1:17:56] that he was going back because he solved
[1:17:58] the problem and that he believed that
[1:18:00] whole scenario go hunting with cindy
[1:18:01] jackson was to solve this problem so
[1:18:04] that he could go back and have one of
[1:18:05] the greatest meetings that had been had
[1:18:08] in africa
[1:18:10] and he didn't do it
[1:18:13] but my point was this
[1:18:15] when you know
[1:18:16] that you're trying to do what's right
[1:18:18] the first thing is if you feel led to do
[1:18:19] anything then check it with the word and
[1:18:21] see if it's right with the word and then
[1:18:23] let nothing stop you i don't care how
[1:18:25] many wheels the devil throws in your way
[1:18:27] just move right over the top of them
[1:18:30] why because if it's wrong god will stop
[1:18:31] you
[1:18:34] just like he stopped him
[1:18:36] but you see that i explained that whole
[1:18:39] thing to understand
[1:18:40] brother brennan went through all of that
[1:18:43] and he had his own idea
[1:18:45] he said i think i believe i believe
[1:18:48] we'll get it in october i think well i
[1:18:50] believe we'll have one and i believe he
[1:18:52] truly believed that
[1:18:54] but that wasn't god's plan but you know
[1:18:56] i i had the privilege of talking to the
[1:18:58] motifs
[1:18:59] and brother branham went over to south
[1:19:01] africa and he didn't have any meetings
[1:19:02] they wanted him even to mean churches he
[1:19:04] wouldn't do it because of his visa and
[1:19:06] when the law said something brother
[1:19:07] brown didn't break it unless god told
[1:19:08] him to
[1:19:10] and he would meet in house meetings and
[1:19:12] several times there was a man there who
[1:19:14] drove him around and met with him and
[1:19:15] his name was willie retief
[1:19:17] and willie ratif is the father of gideon
[1:19:19] ratif and willie ratif was the one who
[1:19:21] really started duplicating messages him
[1:19:23] and some other brothers and getting them
[1:19:25] out through the and a lot of the
[1:19:27] foundation of the message with some of
[1:19:29] those brothers who were there in those
[1:19:30] home meetings
[1:19:32] and it got started right there and the
[1:19:33] message went out
[1:19:35] so do you think something great was
[1:19:37] accomplished absolutely but not in the
[1:19:40] way even brother branham thought it was
[1:19:42] accomplished
[1:19:43] it didn't even happen in the way that
[1:19:45] brother thought it would happen
[1:19:50] but it happened the way god intended it
[1:19:52] to happen and it was so humble and so
[1:19:54] meek it was like dipping in jordan seven
[1:19:56] times
[1:19:57] and it went under the radar and
[1:19:59] unnoticed even to the prophet
[1:20:01] but yet god did a mighty thing there in
[1:20:03] an unexpected way and brother branham
[1:20:06] was gone over a month um he he was gone
[1:20:10] over a month out of the ministry
[1:20:13] no preaching
[1:20:15] no campaigns no healing he went a couple
[1:20:18] weeks hunting shot a bunch of game
[1:20:21] lost his whole itinerary and it looks
[1:20:24] like a big waste of time
[1:20:26] except god accomplished exactly what he
[1:20:28] wanted to accomplish
[1:20:32] we've got to be able to take god
[1:20:35] hey if i never in this lifetime
[1:20:37] understood why i i thought it would
[1:20:38] happen it didn't happen i don't
[1:20:40] understand if i never understand it
[1:20:41] doesn't matter god accomplished
[1:20:42] something i believe that with all my
[1:20:44] heart that the footsteps of the
[1:20:46] righteous are ordered of the lord
[1:20:49] we don't have to understand it we just
[1:20:50] have to believe him
[1:20:53] let's go to acts chapter 2.
[1:21:04] acts chapter 2
[1:21:06] and verse 42.
[1:21:10] we're in the new testament church
[1:21:13] after we've had the day of pentecost
[1:21:15] inaugural message to the church and now
[1:21:17] they're setting up the church people are
[1:21:19] gathering in and verse 42 says and they
[1:21:22] continued steadfastly in the apostles
[1:21:24] doctrine and fellowship and in breaking
[1:21:25] of bread and in prayers
[1:21:28] and fear came upon every soul and many
[1:21:30] wonders and signs were done by the
[1:21:32] apostles and all that believed were
[1:21:34] together and had all things common and
[1:21:37] sold their possessions and goods and
[1:21:38] parted them to all men as every man had
[1:21:41] need and they continued they continuing
[1:21:44] daily with one accord in the temple and
[1:21:46] breaking bread from house to house did
[1:21:47] eat their meat with gladness and
[1:21:49] singleness of heart
[1:21:51] praising god and having favor with all
[1:21:53] the people and the lord added to the
[1:21:55] church daily such as should be saved
[1:21:58] praise god i like a church like that
[1:22:03] we may wind up here before it's all over
[1:22:07] but they sold all they had they laid at
[1:22:09] the apostles feet they had everything in
[1:22:11] common
[1:22:12] and you can see they were rejoicing
[1:22:14] verse 46 and they continuing daily with
[1:22:17] one accord in the temple breaking bread
[1:22:19] from house to house to eat their meat
[1:22:20] with gladness
[1:22:22] and singleness of heart praising god and
[1:22:25] having favor with all the people and the
[1:22:27] lord added to the church daily such as
[1:22:29] should be saved
[1:22:31] they were having a good time
[1:22:33] do you believe that
[1:22:35] i think they were rejoicing at the move
[1:22:37] of god
[1:22:38] they were seeing people added they were
[1:22:40] seeing miracles work they were they they
[1:22:43] had no selfishness among them they had
[1:22:44] given everything up they had it all in
[1:22:46] common they were living in brotherly
[1:22:48] love and they were living in harmony by
[1:22:50] the spirit
[1:22:51] and the church was led by the spirit of
[1:22:53] god in
[1:22:54] imperfect lock step with the spirit
[1:22:57] and they were enjoying the fellowship
[1:22:59] they were enjoying the time and can you
[1:23:01] imagine what their thoughts was
[1:23:03] this is the kingdom
[1:23:05] this is the kingdom
[1:23:07] it's coming and he says you know
[1:23:10] you know i'm coming back and i'll set up
[1:23:12] the kingdom and they know the prophecies
[1:23:14] and now they're seeing it all come
[1:23:16] together
[1:23:17] they're all in order all led by the
[1:23:19] spirit nobody has to tell anybody they
[1:23:21] come and they give their goods they give
[1:23:23] their heart to the lord they're all in
[1:23:25] communion with one another they're all
[1:23:27] in harmony together oh praise god any
[1:23:30] day now he's going to return and he's
[1:23:31] going to set it up the throne here in
[1:23:33] jerusalem we're all here thousands of us
[1:23:35] are gathered now it's time
[1:23:40] but he was gathering them together for a
[1:23:42] different purpose
[1:23:44] let's go over to chapter 8.
[1:23:48] verse 1
[1:23:55] chapter 8 verse 1 and saul was
[1:23:57] consenting unto his death
[1:23:59] and at that time there was a great
[1:24:01] persecution against the church which was
[1:24:02] at jerusalem and they were all scattered
[1:24:05] abroad throughout the regions of judea
[1:24:07] and samaria except the apostles
[1:24:11] right there
[1:24:13] all
[1:24:15] their hopes and dreams
[1:24:17] fell to pieces
[1:24:20] all their ideas
[1:24:22] about the kingdom coming
[1:24:24] about we're going to live this way
[1:24:26] forever
[1:24:27] about
[1:24:28] you know we're all together everything's
[1:24:31] going to be like this forever isn't this
[1:24:33] wonderful right here it all was smashed
[1:24:37] their idea failed
[1:24:39] their thoughts of the timing of the
[1:24:41] prophecies failed
[1:24:43] everything failed
[1:24:46] but god was right on time
[1:24:49] brother bam says in the message
[1:24:50] presuming 1962
[1:24:52] said that night on the ground the place
[1:24:54] where i was talking to the men after i
[1:24:56] got them over there and was telling them
[1:24:57] about it a little fellow walked up to me
[1:24:59] and said how wrong you are
[1:25:01] i said wrong
[1:25:03] he said yes sir when you made that
[1:25:05] statement about the pentecostals back
[1:25:06] there how the people sold all they had
[1:25:09] said that was the worst thing they ever
[1:25:11] done i thought how worldly can you get
[1:25:14] right
[1:25:16] and he said that's the worst i said then
[1:25:18] you mean to tell me that the holy ghost
[1:25:19] made a mistake what kind of god are you
[1:25:21] serving if he makes mistakes he's
[1:25:23] infinite omnipotent omniscient amen sure
[1:25:26] how can he make a mistake he said i'll
[1:25:29] prove to you that you're wrong that
[1:25:30] wasn't the holy ghost i said
[1:25:32] act of the holy ghost in the bible
[1:25:34] wasn't the holy ghost he said look i
[1:25:37] thought all right you brought yourself
[1:25:39] out here now you just saw your own limb
[1:25:41] off
[1:25:44] amen
[1:25:46] just like putting a rabbit in a pen if
[1:25:47] you know
[1:25:48] where every place is and every hole is
[1:25:50] stopped up and he's got to come back
[1:25:52] here to get out just stay right here
[1:25:54] he'll have to come back to him he will
[1:25:56] put his head in every hole but he will
[1:25:57] never get through just pin him up stay
[1:25:59] right there that's the way with one of
[1:26:01] them just keep moving with the word just
[1:26:03] take the word in front of you keep
[1:26:04] moving you got every hole stopped up out
[1:26:07] there anyhow see just keep moving on
[1:26:09] moving up
[1:26:10] i said then the holy ghost made a
[1:26:12] mistake he said well then people made a
[1:26:14] mistake
[1:26:15] i said they were inspired by the holy
[1:26:16] ghost he said look preacher when the
[1:26:19] persecution come and the fuss come up
[1:26:21] among them said that wasn't the holy
[1:26:23] ghost i said no sir but the holy ghost
[1:26:25] was in the first move
[1:26:26] he said when the persecution come up
[1:26:28] those people didn't even have a home to
[1:26:30] go to
[1:26:32] i said that's just what god wanted them
[1:26:34] to do so they went everywhere preaching
[1:26:37] the word if they'd had a home they'd
[1:26:38] have went back to it but god was
[1:26:40] scattering the message they got a home
[1:26:43] in heaven see
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:45] what was god doing to the first church
[1:26:47] under the leadership of the holy coast
[1:26:49] under the apostles teaching they had all
[1:26:51] things in common they sold their homes
[1:26:53] they sold their goods they threw it all
[1:26:55] together they lived together and they
[1:26:57] thought it was the best thing that ever
[1:26:58] happened
[1:27:00] and god was leading them into a trap
[1:27:03] and they were singing and dancing with
[1:27:05] joyfully the whole time
[1:27:08] when everything got just right amen and
[1:27:10] they thought this would go on forever
[1:27:12] all of a sudden a great persecution
[1:27:15] rises in jerusalem against the church
[1:27:17] and smites them and scatters them
[1:27:19] everywhere and they carry the message
[1:27:21] preaching ever because they have no more
[1:27:22] homes to go to they have no more goods
[1:27:24] no more possessions they're scattered
[1:27:26] everywhere
[1:27:28] and that's exactly god's plan
[1:27:32] the holy ghost doesn't make mistakes
[1:27:35] even if it looks like a mistake
[1:27:38] to the carnal mind that looked wrong
[1:27:42] but through the spiritual mind which
[1:27:43] brother branham had he said it was
[1:27:45] perfect
[1:27:48] if we believe the holy ghost led us here
[1:27:52] do you believe the holy ghost led us
[1:27:53] here
[1:27:54] do you believe the spirit of god
[1:27:56] compelled us to continue on
[1:27:59] then god's in control
[1:28:01] he's got a plan
[1:28:03] if others think it's a mistake as long
[1:28:05] as it's not a mistake to the holy ghost
[1:28:08] we're fine
[1:28:10] as long as the spirit of god has led you
[1:28:12] to where you're at as the longest spirit
[1:28:14] of god has led me to where i'm at then
[1:28:16] stand still and see the salvation of god
[1:28:20] don't throw away the confidence that we
[1:28:22] have in the leadership of the lord he's
[1:28:23] led us thus far he'll lead us all the
[1:28:25] way he's brought us here for a purpose
[1:28:27] now let's be bold in our faith watching
[1:28:29] for what god will do i can't figure it
[1:28:32] out i have no idea but let's just watch
[1:28:34] for what god will do
[1:28:36] let's just trust him let's throw all of
[1:28:37] our trust in him and cast down reasoning
[1:28:40] and lean not to our own understanding
[1:28:41] but in all of our ways let's acknowledge
[1:28:43] him so he can direct our steps
[1:28:47] he's not lettuce in a mistake
[1:28:49] this wasn't a mistake it was the plan of
[1:28:52] god but you wouldn't get their
[1:28:54] unbelieving family members to believe
[1:28:55] that they didn't make a mistake by
[1:28:57] selling the family farm and giving it to
[1:28:59] the apostles
[1:29:02] do you understand
[1:29:06] you realize they had unbelieving family
[1:29:10] do you realize they were surrounded by
[1:29:12] an unbelieving church
[1:29:14] in jerusalem that day
[1:29:16] do you think the unbelievers around them
[1:29:18] thought what they were doing was wise
[1:29:23] you sold
[1:29:24] your inheritance
[1:29:27] yeah i don't need it no more kingdom's
[1:29:28] coming
[1:29:31] you realize i mean put yourself back in
[1:29:34] that day
[1:29:36] this is the move of god this is the
[1:29:38] spirit supernatural things are happening
[1:29:39] the other day what do i need a farm for
[1:29:44] do you understand what i'm saying
[1:29:45] friends
[1:29:46] nothing has changed the spirits are the
[1:29:48] same god just changed the people
[1:29:52] a little bit different circumstance same
[1:29:54] story
[1:29:57] you sold your farm you gave up your job
[1:30:00] you moved
[1:30:02] all the way across the country
[1:30:05] for this
[1:30:07] it's the kingdom kingdom's coming
[1:30:11] christ will be here any moment don't you
[1:30:13] see don't you want to sell your farm no
[1:30:15] sir i don't want to sell my farm you're
[1:30:17] crazy
[1:30:20] and then
[1:30:21] when the persecution came and got
[1:30:23] scattered
[1:30:24] can you imagine what's that those poor
[1:30:25] people
[1:30:26] right
[1:30:28] i knew that was a bad idea i knew they
[1:30:30] shouldn't have done that
[1:30:31] i told them i tried to tell him that was
[1:30:34] wrong
[1:30:37] praise god anyhow
[1:30:40] you know what i imagine that they left
[1:30:42] scattered
[1:30:44] i imagine they left confused
[1:30:46] poor
[1:30:47] with no home
[1:30:49] not understanding and having no clue
[1:30:51] what in the world god was doing but
[1:30:52] every step they were taking was ordained
[1:30:54] of god
[1:30:56] running from a persecution with no money
[1:30:58] no houses no goods no more fellowship
[1:31:01] with the other believers but just
[1:31:02] running maybe just their family maybe
[1:31:04] just a couple people running to another
[1:31:06] place to find a place of safety and they
[1:31:08] were step for step in the perfect will
[1:31:11] of god
[1:31:12] but everyone around them thought they'd
[1:31:14] made a mistake and the devil probably
[1:31:16] was laughing his head off
[1:31:20] and
[1:31:21] the his joy over their demise was going
[1:31:24] to be his demise in every city they went
[1:31:27] to
[1:31:28] amen yes sir let the devil laugh now he
[1:31:31] won't laugh later
[1:31:35] god's plan is perfect and god's children
[1:31:38] moved by the spirit of god amen and
[1:31:41] we've got to have enough maturity about
[1:31:43] us to say god's still god and he's still
[1:31:45] sitting on the throne and i'm still his
[1:31:46] son and the blood's still atoned for me
[1:31:48] and nothing's changed
[1:31:51] i don't understand what's happening and
[1:31:53] i may not like what's happening and it
[1:31:54] may hurt what's happening and i may cry
[1:31:56] over what's happening but he's still in
[1:31:58] control of my life
[1:32:01] and if god led me and i'm confident he
[1:32:04] letting me then he didn't lead me in a
[1:32:06] mistake he led me in his perfect will
[1:32:10] and everything that looks wrong is going
[1:32:12] to be made right someday and if in this
[1:32:14] life i don't understand that i still
[1:32:16] know it's true
[1:32:20] see friends
[1:32:21] there were scorners that day there was
[1:32:23] mockers there was family there was
[1:32:25] politicians there was everything you
[1:32:27] could imagine in that day just like
[1:32:29] there is in this day
[1:32:31] but those poor people all they knew to
[1:32:33] do was love god and do what he said
[1:32:36] they
[1:32:38] was it unreasonable to sell their farm
[1:32:40] yes
[1:32:43] was it unreasonable to join this new
[1:32:45] movement
[1:32:48] it hadn't even had time to be tested
[1:32:51] like there wasn't a few generations to
[1:32:53] see if it was kooky crazy was peter
[1:32:55] going to go off on the deep end a few
[1:32:57] months that you realize it wasn't tested
[1:33:01] it wasn't proved
[1:33:03] they didn't have any data
[1:33:06] to verify the claims
[1:33:08] they didn't have history they didn't
[1:33:10] have pedigree they didn't have anything
[1:33:13] amen that would justify the reason for
[1:33:15] giving up everything you've worked hard
[1:33:17] for all your life and maybe your father
[1:33:18] and grandfather worked for all their
[1:33:20] life and throw it away amen just to join
[1:33:22] something that nobody thinks is right
[1:33:25] that nobody understands and give
[1:33:27] yourself totally over to something that
[1:33:29] looks like it could be crazy and it
[1:33:31] could all fall apart tomorrow
[1:33:35] you know what
[1:33:36] they weren't leaning to their own
[1:33:38] understanding
[1:33:39] there had to be something else moving
[1:33:42] these believers it had to be the spirit
[1:33:44] of god moving in an ordained seed of god
[1:33:46] that would respond to the word for that
[1:33:48] day because nothing else makes sense
[1:33:53] and then when their whole plan came
[1:33:55] crashing down when the whole thing
[1:33:56] crumbled and fell apart they didn't
[1:33:59] become unbelievers they ran scared they
[1:34:02] ran away lonely they ran away poor they
[1:34:05] ran away stricken but they ran away
[1:34:07] believers because they preached the
[1:34:09] message everywhere they went
[1:34:12] so they left destitute they left naked
[1:34:16] they left without fellowship but they
[1:34:18] left a believer
[1:34:21] and everybody laughing at them because
[1:34:23] what i thought i told you i told you
[1:34:24] there was a dead end road i told you
[1:34:26] that was going to come to not i told you
[1:34:27] that peter didn't know what he was
[1:34:28] talking about
[1:34:33] but when they got to whatever place that
[1:34:35] god led them to
[1:34:36] it proved what was down in the soul
[1:34:38] because without peter without the income
[1:34:41] of everybody else without the fellowship
[1:34:43] they still preached the message
[1:34:46] if god decides to close every message
[1:34:48] church and scatters the believer the
[1:34:50] real ones will carry the message
[1:34:52] everywhere they go
[1:34:53] if they lose houses if they lose lands
[1:34:55] and they lose fellowship if they lose it
[1:34:57] all they will still carry the message
[1:34:59] because that's who they are
[1:35:02] and they won't cry that god led them
[1:35:04] into a trap they may not understand they
[1:35:06] may cry over the suffering but they're
[1:35:08] not going to blame god
[1:35:12] say god whatever you want from me is
[1:35:14] what you're going to get
[1:35:16] if this is what you want that's what
[1:35:18] you're going to have and if i have to
[1:35:20] suffer i have to suffer if i have to
[1:35:22] look bad in the eyes of my family then
[1:35:24] i'll look bad
[1:35:25] if i have to look like an ignorant fool
[1:35:28] i'll take the way of an ignorant fool as
[1:35:30] long as i'm standing on your word and as
[1:35:32] long as i'm following your leadership
[1:35:34] call me a fool but i'm a fool for christ
[1:35:38] i don't know nobody has this figured out
[1:35:42] there's not a person in the world can
[1:35:44] tell you what's going to happen tomorrow
[1:35:46] there's not i mean
[1:35:48] with a virus or no virus nobody can tell
[1:35:50] you what's coming tomorrow and we've
[1:35:52] seen things change so fast we have no
[1:35:54] idea what next week is going to look
[1:35:55] like but but so somebody tell you you
[1:35:58] should do this and you should do that
[1:35:59] forget it all just throw yourself on the
[1:36:01] hands of jehovah and say god i can't
[1:36:04] figure a thing out and all the models
[1:36:06] they show they keep changing so
[1:36:07] obviously the scientists can't figure it
[1:36:09] out either
[1:36:12] so i'm not going to depend on them i'm
[1:36:15] not going to depend on the government
[1:36:16] i'm not going to depend on my family i'm
[1:36:18] not going to depend on my friends i'm
[1:36:20] going to trust wholly on what you tell
[1:36:22] me to do is what i will do
[1:36:25] and if i do what you tell me to do then
[1:36:28] i've got faith that says you'll take
[1:36:30] care of the rest
[1:36:33] we may not
[1:36:35] enjoy the process
[1:36:37] but we're going to enjoy the destination
[1:36:41] he may not do things the way we expect
[1:36:43] him to
[1:36:44] but don't ever stop expecting him to do
[1:36:47] the miraculous
[1:36:49] don't ever let your
[1:36:51] diminish just because he didn't work it
[1:36:54] according to your expectation
[1:36:58] god
[1:36:58] you didn't meet my expectation
[1:37:01] you must be getting ready to exceed it
[1:37:06] [Music]
[1:37:07] you didn't do it my way your way must be
[1:37:09] better
[1:37:11] it's all the attitude friends we've got
[1:37:13] to adjust the attitude to keep god on
[1:37:16] the throne of our lives
[1:37:18] and not let reasoning
[1:37:20] brother branham said science is of the
[1:37:22] devil
[1:37:24] don't let it be your guide
[1:37:27] science and education and civilization
[1:37:30] he said is of the devil don't let that
[1:37:32] guide you let the word of god anointed
[1:37:35] by the spirit of god be our only guide
[1:37:39] it's dangerous to put all your
[1:37:41] confidence in science
[1:37:43] civilization
[1:37:44] education
[1:37:47] we've got to put all our confidence in
[1:37:49] him
[1:37:51] and he'll lead us in places that look
[1:37:53] terrible
[1:37:54] don't think god won't take you
[1:37:57] and put you in the worst of the worst
[1:37:59] situations
[1:38:02] he's gone
[1:38:03] and you belong to him
[1:38:06] what did he do to the apostle paul
[1:38:11] what did he do to peter
[1:38:14] what did he do to the christians to the
[1:38:15] ages
[1:38:17] if he wanted to strip them naked and
[1:38:19] hang them on the cross he did it
[1:38:21] do you realize
[1:38:23] we've got to get past the maturity of
[1:38:25] god loves me he's a good god he won't
[1:38:27] let anything bad happen to me get past
[1:38:29] that
[1:38:30] get past that right now
[1:38:32] because he wants to make a public
[1:38:34] mockery out of you he will
[1:38:36] and he can
[1:38:37] and if it serves his purpose to make you
[1:38:39] look like a fool and if it serves his
[1:38:41] purpose to make you and i look like a
[1:38:43] public example and a mockery and a shame
[1:38:45] that's exactly what he'll have
[1:38:47] and that's exactly what we should give
[1:38:49] him
[1:38:50] whatever he takes he can take
[1:38:53] my life's nothing anyways it's not worth
[1:38:55] anything it doesn't mount to a hill of
[1:38:56] beans
[1:38:58] we just got to surrender to him
[1:39:00] don't think well god won't let that
[1:39:02] happen he could let anything happen
[1:39:05] if it serves his purpose for his glory
[1:39:08] he'll let it happen
[1:39:10] don't run away scared when it happens
[1:39:13] just stand and say you're still god
[1:39:16] i'm still yours
[1:39:18] lead me lord because i don't know where
[1:39:19] to step next
[1:39:21] and no reasoning is going to help me
[1:39:24] we have to have faith friends
[1:39:27] man let's all stand musicians if you
[1:39:29] could come
[1:39:31] blake if you could come
[1:39:35] amen
[1:39:37] i appreciate so much you few who are
[1:39:39] able to be here and
[1:39:41] appreciate so much those who are
[1:39:42] faithfully pulling
[1:39:44] across the streaming
[1:39:46] may god bless you wherever you are
[1:39:49] i'm looking forward to the day we can
[1:39:50] all see one another face to
[1:39:52] face but if god never lets that day come
[1:39:56] it doesn't change anything
[1:39:59] i expect that we'll all be gathered back
[1:40:01] into this assembly again together and
[1:40:03] i'll see each other face to face
[1:40:05] but if god doesn't meet our expectation
[1:40:07] and we never come back together it
[1:40:09] doesn't change anything
[1:40:11] god is still gone
[1:40:13] hold fast to their faith to the
[1:40:15] profession of your faith don't let it
[1:40:16] waver believe god despite all
[1:40:19] circumstances
[1:40:20] and everything will be
[1:40:22] just fine amen let's pray
[1:40:26] dear lord jesus we love you
[1:40:29] we thank you god for your word
[1:40:32] for it's a light and to our feet lord
[1:40:34] it's a lamp into our feet in the light
[1:40:36] into our path lord so that we can know
[1:40:38] how to walk
[1:40:40] god everything you've done and written
[1:40:42] us for our example
[1:40:44] help us lord to just be faithful to this
[1:40:46] word
[1:40:48] god you've led us in ways so many times
[1:40:50] that we're confusing to the carnal mind
[1:40:53] so many ways that made no sense to the
[1:40:55] eye
[1:40:57] but god somehow you worked a perfect
[1:40:59] plan
[1:41:00] you've brought us through obstacles
[1:41:02] trials
[1:41:04] you've taken us sideways and backwards
[1:41:06] and upside down through everything in
[1:41:07] life
[1:41:08] but somehow it's always come out right
[1:41:11] but we've lived long enough on this life
[1:41:14] we've served you long enough in this
[1:41:16] life to know
[1:41:17] that your plan always works out perfect
[1:41:20] and god give us faith in this hour
[1:41:23] to stand the test and to stand the trial
[1:41:26] no matter what others say lord help us
[1:41:29] not to lose confidence in you for you
[1:41:32] have started a good work in us will be
[1:41:33] faithful to complete it
[1:41:35] you're the author and finisher of our
[1:41:38] faith
[1:41:39] you've brought us this far
[1:41:40] we're trusting you to take us all the
[1:41:43] way through
[1:41:44] god help us not to lean to our own
[1:41:46] understanding
[1:41:47] help us not to to look with the eyes
[1:41:51] the natural carnal eyes but let's look
[1:41:53] at the eyes of faith and see you in
[1:41:55] every situation
[1:41:57] you've armed us you've equipped us now
[1:42:00] you're asking us to stand
[1:42:02] you've led us with the pillar of fire
[1:42:05] by the leadership of your holy spirit
[1:42:07] and now you're asking us to stand still
[1:42:09] and have faith in you
[1:42:10] [Music]
[1:42:12] god as you would have us to say several
[1:42:14] weeks ago
[1:42:16] my father's a good shot
[1:42:19] lord i still believe you're a good shot
[1:42:22] god it may look scary
[1:42:25] it may look like we're defenseless
[1:42:28] in the open
[1:42:29] and easy target for the devil
[1:42:32] an easy target for criticism
[1:42:34] hatred and malice
[1:42:37] but god you know
[1:42:39] and i just want to declare
[1:42:41] you're a good shot
[1:42:43] and i still believe it
[1:42:45] i don't know when you'll pull that
[1:42:47] trigger i don't know when you'll drop
[1:42:49] this devil
[1:42:50] but i believe you will
[1:42:52] i believe you promised lord that you'll
[1:42:54] take care of us
[1:42:56] that you'll lead us in the paths of
[1:42:58] righteousness for your name's sake
[1:43:00] that you'll care for us as your children
[1:43:02] lord that you'll shelter us under your
[1:43:04] wings
[1:43:05] and i still believe it's true
[1:43:08] god help us to hold steady and have
[1:43:10] faith in you
[1:43:12] it may look like a trap
[1:43:15] but there's a tunnel here somewhere
[1:43:17] there's a path through the water or on
[1:43:19] the water or under the mountain
[1:43:21] i don't know where
[1:43:23] but god somehow you're going to open up
[1:43:25] a path
[1:43:27] and you're the only one who's going to
[1:43:28] get the glory
[1:43:30] no man will glory
[1:43:31] nobody will have it figured out
[1:43:34] but you alone will be worshiped and
[1:43:35] glorified because you're the only one
[1:43:38] who knew where the path was
[1:43:40] i pray to give us faith to stand still
[1:43:42] and see your salvation
[1:43:44] for god i know you've led us
[1:43:46] and you haven't stopped
[1:43:48] we're trusting you to lead us all the
[1:43:49] way through
[1:43:51] god we give you our lives
[1:43:53] we pray lord that you would bless those
[1:43:55] who are not feeling well and struggling
[1:43:57] with symptoms
[1:43:59] prayed you deliver each one lord
[1:44:01] prayed you boost their faith lord and
[1:44:03] that that faith would rise to the
[1:44:04] occasion lord and i pray that you would
[1:44:06] take away the symptoms and help them to
[1:44:08] feel well
[1:44:10] bless every circumstance lord for your
[1:44:12] glory
