TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And as I said to you, the woman at the well, she initially she said, "Sir, I perceive that they are a prophet, right?" And that was good. That's great. But he talked to her a bit more. Amen. And then she said, "Well, well, when Messiah comes, he's going to tell us these things." Who are you? And when when she thought he was a prophet, she didn't move. Right? But when he when she said, "When Messiah comes, he's going to tell us these things. Who are you?" He said, "I am he." She drops the water pot and she's gone. It changed her. She then gives a report in the city. She doesn't go and say, "I've seen a prophet." She said, "This is Messiah. Come and see." See, it motivated her. And and and Jesus could could rest in that. He's she's caught the revelation. Amen. Because she was elect. He couldn't leave her any sooner. He had to wait until she she caught the the revelation that the man in John nine that he was talking to the uh to the scribes and Pharisees and they asked him, "What sayest there of him that have opened thine eyes?" The Pharisees say, he said, "He's a prophet." Uhhuh. Well, that's a good report. That's how it started. And he says, "Will you also be his disciples?" He was very confident. I love this man. And they said, "We're Moses' disciples. As for this fellow, we know not whence he is." And he goes, "Well, here it is a marvelous thing." You know, he's he's starting to mock them now. You know, he had no fear of them like his parents had. You know, he's like, "Wow, here is a marvelous thing. Ye know not from whence he is, and yet he had opened mine eyes. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing." And they cast him out. But when Jesus heard that they had cast him out, he came and found him again. And when Jesus found him, he asked him, he said, "Dust thou believe on the Son of God?" And he said, "Who is he, Lord?" And he said, "It is he that talkketh with thee." And he said, "Lord, I believe." He was elect. He couldn't leave him just believing as a prophet. He had a good report. He's a prophet. No. He said he had to come to the point where he says, "Actually, who is he, Lord?" Oh, it's him. Okay. And he worshiped him. Amen. Praise the Lord. The two on the road to Emmas. Jesus slips up next to them and he hears the conversation. They're sad and they're talking about and they're saying, he says, "Well, you know what things?" And they say, "Well, if Jesus of Nazareth, you know, he was a prophet, mighty in word and deed that they've got a good report. He's a prophet." But Jesus walks with them and he starts talking to them and he starts breaking the scripture and he says, you know, from the time of Moses and all the prophets, all the things concerning himself and you they must have been thinking, man, we've got to have this guy in our pulpit. We got to bring him back. He's going to he could preach, man, he could preach a great sermon. You know, they still weren't recognizing who he was. So, I got to walk a bit further. He walks a bit further and he tells them what they still didn't recognize him. They walk a bit further. They get to the place where they're staying. And Jesus makes out he's going to go on. He had no intention of going on, but he needed them to ask him to come in. They asked him to come in and then he broke the bread and they recognized that's who he is. Then he disappeared out of their sight. He couldn't disappear out of their sight until they recognized who he was because they were elect. Amen. He can't disappear out of our sight till we catch the revelation of who he is. Amen. It's just uh such a marvelous thing. They were reading between the lines.
