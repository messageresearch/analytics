evening friends let's just take our bibles while we're standing and go to genesis chapter two we'll start right into the word while you're turning there i want to make an announcement not this coming sunday but the following sunday august 23rd brother aaron mcgeary will be here ministering for us in the service so be praying for that it's interesting to note that the last visiting ministry we had was aaron mcgeary in march before all the covert broke out and now we've got this long gap and now the first visiting minister will have after that will be aaron mcgeary so god just worked it out that way so we thank god for that she'll be praying for that that'll be august 23rd amen let's look at genesis chapter 2 verse 8. and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden in the tree of knowledge of good and evil and a river went out of eden to water the garden and from thence it parted and became into four heads so i want to look at verse 10 closely and a river went out of eden to water the garden so the the water was the garden was watered by this river that went out of eden and from thence it was parted and became into four heads let's bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing lord jesus we ask that you would bless our time together lord we've come here for a purpose and has to worship your name we've come to commune with you lord we've come to hear from you and we pray o great shepherd would you feed us your sheep now lord while we know your method we know how you've chosen lord to communicate in this hour and we receive that lord we ask that you would take these lips of clay and speak your eternal words give us ears to hear and a heart to perceive all you have for us so father may you be glorified and praised in all we say and do in jesus name we pray amen you can have your seats so we see here in the very very beginning of the book god had planted a garden eastward in eden and there there was a river that went out of eden to water the garden and from then it split into four heads and i wanted to take a look uh this evening if we can at the subject a tree of life fed by the water of life the tree of life fed by the water of life and just take a look at this for a little while we know that the book of genesis in the book of revelations they mark the cornerstone and capstone of the bible if we could understand it that way everything that finishes in revelations began in genesis genesis the seed chapter revelations is the capping off the the capstone of the bible and brother bam said both of them are written symbols so so we're not we're looking at the symbols here and what it means for us because to me under the revelation of the hour as god has brought it so close to us personally that all of these things that we talk about find representation in us and we find the application in us for so many of these things and brother branham says in the message super sign from 1962 nebuchadnezzar built a super city it had hanging gardens and it was a great place it was a pattern of heaven right before the throne flowed the river euphrates and they found out that that's the way the throne of god the river of life by the throne of god is trying to achieve something trying to make it big great big great so he could say see what i done and he goes on and there's another message the sign of the time in 1958 he said like in oslo not long ago i went down to the main part of the city and it was a narrow so narrow that an automobile could hardly squeeze its way through because it was made for chariots before they had automotive and we are told that the streets of babylon were 200 feet across and the gates of the city were made some 80 feet tall of solid brass and the walls were 200 feet tall and was wide enough on top that they could run three chariots and a breast a horse race around the city and it was also the great city had gardens great gardens all along these walls and the palace set in the center of the city and every street led straight to the palace rome rome's built the same way it was called by our bible in modern babylon and all roads lead to rome all streets lead to the palace and the palace was built where the river euphrates which irrigated this big shinar valley came down from tigris and irrigated the valley it was a great rich country and this river was built or the throne was built rather so that the river run right along the front of the throne now if my friends hear you bible readers understand that was a pattern of the heavenly throne the river of life flows by the throne of god and the great garden so you see it was a perverted version of glory it belonged and was built and brought up by satan like all other kingdoms of the world are ruled and governed by satan so you can see what nebuchadnezzar was was reproducing as anointed by satan what was satan was trying to reproduce on earth what was in heaven and we find out it's very similar when you look at it and in junction with the garden of eden the garden of eden had this river that flowed through it and and out of it it branched into four heads and and there was there the tree of life and also the tree of knowledge of good and evil and then if you begin to look at the garden eden and you reflect it back to what's being told about the the tree of life and the and the water of life flowing from the throne of god and and all these things you see that eden itself the garden of eden was a reflection of heaven god had made something on earth that was reflected in heaven amen and we see all these same types carrying through and now now satan is trying through nebuchadnezzar through babylon to reproduce what's in heaven but doing it in a carnal way even so that it had great gardens and a river come from the throne by the throne and went out and watered the gardens and it became a beautiful place and so satan is always trying to reproduce what god is doing trying to replicate it let's turn to genesis 13 together this is a as i got into this i actually started on another subject and uh early today god just shifted me in another this direction and this is a really large subject it's huge but we won't have time to exhaust it at all we're just going to hit some points and i want to draw something out of that for ourselves and then maybe the lord sunday will let us move on to my original thought and genesis 13 verse 10 and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorre even as the garden of the lord liked the land of egypt as thou comest unto zore then lot chose him all the plane of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other so now we find in the separation of abraham and lot we know that there was tension and and god ordained it because there had to be a separation because abraham had not would not willingly separate from lot and and when he told lot you can go wherever you want lot looked out and he saw the plains of jordan where sodom and gomorrah was and he saw that it was well watered amen like the garden of god amen and there was a garden of god on earth because there's a garden of god in heaven and brother venom reflect he uses phrases like this and so now we see there's one reflected to another reflected and then another reflection but we know the the well watering it's well watered you well water a land to produce fruit a well-watered land produces fruit a well-watered land is desirable and a well-watered land is tender and sweet and so god had a well-water he's got a well-watered garden in heaven he had a well-watered garden in eden and now we find that the the valley in jordan was well watered but satan came in and corrupted it and they took the blessings and they took the benefits of that and they perverted it until sodom became absolutely con perverted and corrupt although it was well watered like the garden of god just like babylon sodom and gomorrah so satan is always running a parallel tract with god trying to reproduce but his reproduction always goes into corruption and perversion every time brother man says in the message super sign nimrod one time he wanted to achieve a way to go to heaven without an atonement so he built a super tower there's many towers but he tried to build a super tower what happened to it it fell along came nebuchadnezzar and he built a super city though he could build these big walls walled wide enough that he could run a chariot race around them the great iron gate and the things that he built put the river right through the middle a type of heaven swinging gardens in his throne right by the river like the river euphrates and like the river of life in the garden of eden and the river of life and the kingdom of god and what happened it fell because it could not stand so god brother branham is drawing these parallels between the the garden and the kingdom of god the garden in heaven the garden in eden and now satan tried to reproduce the same kind of garden in babylon but it fell because there's only one garden of god that can stand amen and it is well watered there's a water coming from the throne of god the water of life flowing out and watering this let's look at john chapter 7. now remember genesis and revelation are a book of symbols don't forget that as we move on don't miss the symbols because so many times you know we're trying to get back to a garden of eden and we want to return and and there was a a message uh friday night when we were up at brother dan ratliffs and brother mcgeary preached friday night and he took a subject on the original purpose and was talking about some things in the garden of eden and it triggered a lot of thinking for me i've been meditating on it a lot and and we find that that that god when he we want to get back to the garden of eden that's our goal we want to go back amen we want to go back where we can walk in the cool of the night and eat the fruit and and all of this but remember those were symbols and it's not that there's not a real garden and there's not that there wasn't a great place where they actually walked on this earth but but god wants to produce amen a garden of eden then you and i god wants us to be able to walk in the cool of the evening with him now amen spiritually he wants us to come to the invisible union amen the bridegroom and the bride a return of adam and eve and he wants to do that now spiritually he wants the symbols amen to be real in our lives now so we're longing to get back to something amen but if we want along to get back to the physical as in so many things in the scripture we must understand and realize the supernatural spiritual that god's desiring to do in our lives now and let's go to john chapter 7 verse 37 and look at just a couple things john 7 37 in the last day the great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water so here we come back to this whole idea of a river of life or a river of living water and a living water is water that's alive or has life in it so he says uh if any man's thirst let him come to me and drink so what is jesus jesus is the river of life what river of life the one that flows out of the throne of god from heaven you see jesus is the river of life he's the bread of life he's the throne of god he's the temple of god he's the lamb of god you see christ christ is the anointed word whatever god thought when that comes into an expression that's christ so he can be the bread of life he can be the throat he can be the throne of god and the water of life that comes out from that throne and the tree of life that's watered by that water you understand he can he can be the bridegroom and he can be the bride oh don't you love the word of god amen he can be he can be in our communion and feet washing service he can be the one it can be christ kneeling at your feet to serve you and wash your feet and it can be cr it can be christ washing christ's feet praise be to god so these things are all symbols of god the thought of god god's intention god's desire god's thinking now comes in an expression and he expresses it in word and he expresses it in symbols he expresses it in in nature and reality amen it's all expressing the same thing the thoughts of god amen and so and so christ is those anointed thoughts made manifest so we we don't want to get caught up in terminology and and separate things and this is this and this is that it's all god it's all god it's all god's word it's the expression of god's thought amen it's christ expressed in the throne christ expressed in the water of life christ expressed in the bread of life christ expressed in the tree of life christ expressed in the streets of gold so so he says now i want to read this again if any man thirst let him come to me and drink why come to him and drink amen because when he was with the samaritan woman in john chapter 4 he said if you knew who you were talking to you'd ask of me of water i would give you that you would never thirst again what water is he talking about the water of life amen springing up from you a well of everlasting life this is the water of life coming from the throne of god and he says he that believeth on me verse 38 he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water so now when you come to christ and drink and you drink of christ now what comes out of your belly amen whatever you drank is now coming out of you verse 39 but this he spake spake he of the spirit which they that believeth on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified so he's saying if you come to me and drink and receive in my spirit then out of your belly will flow the spirit the holy spirit brother branham said in the message revelation chapter 4 from 1961 he preached this after he was done with the revelation of the church ages this is this is uh january of 1961 he said now the first throne was in heaven judgment see the second throne was in christ the third throne is in man so the first throne was in heaven and out of that throne came a river of life then the second throne was in christ and out of that throne came a river of life and the third throne is in man and out of that throne comes a river of life it's the same thing as john chapter 7 and so he says in the fourth seal when he's preaching the seals in march in 1963 in the fourth seal he says as the natural wine reveals itself in stimulated power so does the new wine as it reveals the word of god which is spirit now remember when he says if you if you drink out of your belly shall flow with the rivers of living water and he was speaking of the spirit that shall come and now brother branham is telling us now now so does the new wine as it reveals the word of god which is spirit the word itself is spirit but the presence the fourth field the word itself is spirit so the question is what is receiving the spirit the word itself is spirit you believe that let's read it he says let's see who said it and then we'll know whether it's truth saint john the sixth chapter sixth chapter i believe it's the 60 or 63rd verse all right yes it is the spirit that quick and it's the flesh prophet and nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life then brother brahm says the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form amen because the word contains the spirit the spirit comes with the word the word and the spirit are linked together and we've been through this so many times brother brahm said the spirit the holy ghost was bound amen it was bound why it was bound by in denomination by denominational rivers by creeds and dogmas so the misunderstanding of the word of god and the false teaching of the word of god when the word of god was hindered or bound the holy ghost was bound but it's to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy ghost back in the church again what came back and what came back in the end time message the full revelation of the full word came back and when the word came back the holy ghost now was unbound to come back in the church again you cannot separate these two things the word and the spirit so the word itself is spirit it's spirit and word form and then you see when it is quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts now look here i thought a thought has to be a thought before it can be a word and then when it's a thought it's presented it's a word amen when that word comes it comes with the spirit or with the life to make that word live he's not talking about brother man's not talking about just being able to read a text and i got the word no but when you receive amen that word by revelation into the soul when you receive that word that word comes with a spirit and that spirit comes to bring life to that word that you receive so that back out of you comes life or spirit back out of your belly first throne was in heaven second throne was in christ third throne was in man and out from under the throne comes the river of life and the word itself is spirit now let's turn to revelation i hope god will help me tie these things together but if i can't do it god can do it he can do it in your heart revelation 22 17 we go all the way to the end of the book of revelations right here at the finishing up and revelation 22 17 says in the spirit and the bride say come see now they're working in conjunction they're working as one the spirit and the bride say come it's not like the spirit is over here saying come and then the bride's over here also saying come but the spirit and the bride are coupled together amen and the spirit and the bride are saying come that voice is now coming from the to through the final voice to the final age it is now coming through revelation chapter 10 verse 8 to 11. eat the book and prophesy again amen she now is the final voice to the final age and the spirit now is speaking amen it's speaking where out of those who have come to christ and drank received his word and now out of their belly is flowing rivers of living water and now the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely let's turn back to revelation 19. revelation 19 and 5. and the voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thundering saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready now brother ben is going to tell us in proving his word when the marriage takes place because in the message proving his word he said the marriage takes place here we go to the wedding supper but the the marriage the union is here so this is something that takes place on the earth amen when when each member of the bride amen comes to that place amen where they're born again by the spirit of god amen they go into an invisible union with with christ and he says now he says the white i read verse 7 again let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints let's read on to verse 9 and he sayeth unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god let's look over at chapter 21 verse 1. and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband now it's interesting that the city is described as a bride adorned for a husband because you know it's not brick and mortar that god is so interested in but it's his attributes or his seed and see you know when sometimes when we get that image or at least for myself sometimes when i get an image of christ and his bride i'm looking at two figures like a man and a woman standing at an altar two getting married together but really the images that image is not correct because christ's bride is not one vessel christ's bride is a mini-member bride so christ's bride is a city is the new jerusalem is the heavenly city every individual stone placed in that city making up the city makes up the bride of jesus christ amen it's not it's not an image of just one man one woman and we know collectively the bride is one but when you look at that that singular pyramid-shaped city coming down all of those stones in there represent individuals it's in the bride making up one bride and the bride is a city because the bride is many and cities are in the feminine and this city's coming down like a bride adorned for her husband amen because he's coming as a king and the king has to come to a place there's no there's there's no kings there's no point in kings or kingdoms if he has no throne to sit on and he has no subjects he has he has nothing it's just a man says i'm a king so what you're a king but a king needs a place to rule a king needs people a king needs a family a king needs a throne and now the throne is at the top of the city because it's been building over seven church ages and now come to the capstone age where the holy ghost is loose to come in fullness christ himself can now come and sit on his throne at the top of the city so the city is a mini-membered bride the city or the seat of christ that city is now christ is joined to the city the king is on the throne amen christ is now the light of the city all of these terms represent they're all symbolic and they're representing what's happened in your in our day today christ has come the light has come all light of all seven church ages and the revelation of the seven thunders the light has come into the city the lamb is on the throne at the top in the cap and now he's illuminating the city and the city doesn't need sun or moon it doesn't need anything natural it doesn't need anything from the previous dispensations amen but now the lamb is here and he is the light the illumination the revelation amen the teacher he is here and he's shining the whole bible and she is adorned amen as a bride adorned for her husband why because this is a marriage union christ is coming into a city christ is coming to his throne where at the top of the city and so you know we we get uh ideas you know and and the symbolism can begin to tie us down amen and not realize that these symbols all are represented right here all around us all over the earth amen are living stones built into a habitation of god they've been building up over seven churches but to be capped off at the end and what what is each stone it's a living word and the living word through each aid was built up and built up until collectively the living word at the end of time becomes the capstone ministry christ comes down and connects with that and when he connects with that he connects with the whole city so what are we waiting for we're waiting for the last member to come in praise be to god so now this city it's like a bride prepared for his husband christ is the king is the husband the city is his people his bride they're joining together he's back on his throne and out from under his throne comes the river of life let's look at verse 5. and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he saith unto me right for these words are true and faithful let me see am i in the right spot no i'm in the wrong spot let's go down to verse 9. and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife now remember everything i told you before because now one of the seven angels which of the seven angels showed us the lamb's wife so this comes right to our day one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and her light was likened to a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal he goes on down to the rest of the chapter describing that city and the placing of the things in the city but it's interesting that one of these angels one of these seven angels having the seven plagues amen come to john and said i'm gonna show you the i'm gonna show you the bride i'm gonna show you the lamb's wife and when he looked to see the lamb's wife he saw a city and and brother branham is preaching in future home and he's preaching about this city and he's giving dimensions and he's talking about after the millennium this great fire that's going to come down and a mountain's going to push up a city that's going to rest over top of this mountain and he's going through all of this and show us all of the natural amen that's going to take place and but he but then he says something right there in in a future home and he says i could drop a little something right here and he says that 1500 miles that's about the dimensions that we have sitting right in this church tonight now why you have to ask yourself why is he dropping this is it just purely anecdotal is it just purely coincidence and interesting was the prophet just interested in the fact that we have people here from georgia to maine and from saskatchewan you know was that just a curious set of circumstances and he just wanted to drop something and just point out this is weird hey man i've been talking about a city 1500 miles square and you know what's weird is we got people here representing about that kind of border but what he's showing you is that city is reflected on this earth now the city is here friends amen everything that the symbol symbolized is here amen being symbolized and lived down and fleshed out through the bride what he's trying to drop i'm going to drop a little something here amen this this brother's from jordan this brother's from maine and this brother's from saskatchewan so what i want to interrupt what i'm teaching and drop a little something here where people live you realize the the prophet there's so many things that he's trying to get the people to say but under the third pull he's not allowed to come right out and say it but can you see that that city is a bride and that bride is on earth amen and everything that's symbolized in that city is in this bride there's a throne there's a river of life there's a tree of life praise be to god he says in future home and in here we'll dwell the redeemed these avenues and big freeways as it was parks the river of life will draw run through it and every house will be made of transparent gold and the streets will be made of gold and the trees the trees of life will be there i'll read that again the trees of life will be there and will bear twelve manner of fruit and the kings and the honored men of the earth shall bring their honor and glory into the gates and the gates shall not be shut by night because there is no night there you know uh the if you look at the the house is made of transparent gold now this is a funny statement because what's the point of gold if it's transparent like it's transparent you can see right through it but it's gold see these are it's symbolic friends amen what do you want with transparent gold just get glass but it's showing that the house amen every house in the city is pure it's pure deity on display so what's inside can be seen outside these are these are symbols and they mean something the streets are transparent gold amen there's no corruption you know color is an impurity so this is gold deity not mixed with any more impurity and now you're walking on the word amen with no more impurity the houses are transparent gold praise god and you're comfortable living in them because you have nothing to hide [Music] in this city amen you're comfortable amen don't put me in a house of glass i'll shut all the blinds i'm a private person you know but this this is displaying something brother bam is trying to show us something amen it's transparent glass your life is on display amen nothing is hid this is deity it's coming through the lens of deity and what's on the inside has to shine forth to everyone that's walking by he goes on in future home said notice the river of life perhaps many little streams make it up now in this earth i'm going to close in just a few minutes said in this life i have never seen nothing so quenching as to be in the mountains and find as i preached on the other night that stream bubbling up it's a life-giving resource you'd be tired and thirsty fall down by a good stream way down where germs can't go way down hundreds of feet in the earth is bubbling forth pure genuine life-giving water we appreciate that that's little now the earth has its many streams with refreshing water when you're thirsty and dying you get a good cold drink of that it'll help you to live but look where this one comes from from the throne there is where it gets its life-giving resource comes from under the throne of god where god sits now this water of life jesus says in in john 7 come and drink from me then out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water amen because his throne will be in his bride and out from there will come the waters of life and the spirit and the bride say come come if the spirit and bright say come you realize the spirit and bright are not saying go they're saying come so they're saying come you have to come to where they are to get the drink and so now brother branham is saying it's the life it's coming from under the throne of god amen because when you when you talk about under the throne of god you're going all the way back to original the where did this water come from where did this river of life come from it came from god so if we can follow this river of life all the way back to its original with its original intent with its original meaning with its original revelation amen when we come to the top of the city amen as this water trickles out of the throne and it goes through the avenues and it goes through the streets and it winds its way down the city amen you realize brother bam says it it splits up and it wanders this way and wonders that way and as you come up through seven church ages you can get a little drink over here and a little drink over here but as you get to the top you get closer and closer to the source to the original to the full flow before it's broken up before you can have a little sip here and a little sip here you come right back to the original with the original intent the original meaning original purpose and original thought see where the bride's come to he says now comes from under the throne of god where god sits all of it all of this earth this earth here we live in now everyone whether it be christian or pagan has temples did you ever think of that church is all of them but this one doesn't have any the bible said there was no temple there but the lord god and the lamb is the temple of it the lamb is the light the lamb is the temple the lamb is the throne are you catching this so what is the lamb he's the light he's the temple he's the throne the lamb is the life he is the temple all these temples have objects that are they're worshipping but in this city he is the object he is with his people his spirit his spirit light floods the pyramid city now i realize what brother ben is saying it says that there there'll be a light at the top and that light illuminates but brother ben just called it spirit light we're not talking about natural light we're talking about spirit light that floods the pyramid city like peter and john on top of the mountain the light covered the top of the mountain and the voice spoke this is my beloved son in revelation 21 3 and 4 the tabernacle of god was with man god has tabernacled in man by redeeming him by these three processes now god is going to redeem the earth and the tabernacle in the earth with his subjects of the earth which he brought forth from the earth now god by these three processes which was water amen which was which was water spirit and life amen so he gave the earth a baptism amen with noah's day he burned it with fire amen and he's gonna or he dropped blood on it to sanctify he's gonna burn it with fire under the baptism holy ghost at the end time so that he and his bride could dwell upon it in perfection so he does the same thing to you because you're the temple of god you're the habitation of god so he brings you through justification and water baptism sanctification amen by the life and the blood and now he burns you off amen by the spirit of god why so that the so that the person of the spirit the person himself can come and dwell in you so that there can be amen so that the lamb can sit on the throne where here and out from the throne can come waters of life in the ephesians church age from the church age book he says now that tree back there in eden that tree which was the source of life was jesus in john chapter 6 through 8 jesus sets himself forth as the source of eternal life he called himself the bread from heaven he spoke of giving himself and that if a man ate of him he would never die he proclaimed that he knew abraham and the and that before abraham he was he prophesied that he himself would give them living water that if any man drank he would never thirst again but would live eternally he showed himself as the great i am he is the bread of life the well of life the eternal one the tree of life he was back there in eden in the midst of the garden even as he will be in the midst of the paradise of god so you have to you say what what is christ what is he he's the bread of life he's the well of life he's the river of life he's the eternal one he's the tree of life what is that expressions of christ he was back there in eden you know remember genesis symbols how was he back there in eden because god gave him his word they had the manifest word for their day they had christ they had the tree of life amen they could have kept eating from the tree of life and live amen but they decided to go over eve decided to go over and sample from the tree of knowledge of good and evil and she sampled from the tree that was mixed with reasoning and lust but she could have kept eating from the tree of life but she chose to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil according to her own reasoning you realize that those those trees are still here those steel those trees are still here amen and we can eat from water we can eat from the other but what we eat from is going to produce a life because you are what you eat and what you eat becomes your life so there's still two trees friends and we can eat from either one of those trees but he he is the tree of life that was back there in eden in the midst of the garden even as he will be in the midst of the paradise of god because what was will be what started in in genesis will be in revelation let's look at revelation 22. revelation 22 and verse 1. and this is really the thought i wanted to get to so i've been working the whole time to get here revelation 22 1 and he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations now we know this is the tree of life we know that christ was the tree of life in the garden of eden christ is the tree of life and the paradise of god but yet this tree of life is referred to as her and we see also that in the midst of the street and on either side of the river was the tree of life so in the midst of the street on either side of the river is the tree of life if there's a tree of life on either side of the river you have a river and you have a tree of life here and a tree of life here right but it's only one tree of life one tree of life and one expression and one tree of life and another expression are one tree of life and male expression and one tree of life and female expression because the bridegroom tree without the bride tree cannot produce any fruit so it takes male and female to coming together to reproduce itself again and the same thing's true and the tree of life the tree of life is also bridegroom and bride we'll get to that in a minute and so now this this she this this tree of life bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations let's go to mark chapter 11. i'm going to take a strange deviation but there's a real reason for it so when you start thinking what in what what in the world is brother chad doing just bear with me humor me just a little bit mark chapter 11 verse 12. mark 11 and 12. on the morrow when they were come to bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree of far off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs were not yet this is really important jesus is hungry he wants to be satisfied from this tree and he sees leaves on the tree but but he's hoping to get something from the tree but when he gets there the tree has no figs to give him there's no fruit coming from the tree amen and and it wasn't even the time for figs amen you can say it this way jesus comes out of season jesus came to the tree and we know all his footsteps were ordained everything was right on time but he comes to the fig tree at a time when it wasn't yet time for the fig tree to bear figs but he was he was desiring to get figs from the tree and when he didn't he curses it and let's see here uh verse 14 and jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever and his disciples heard it then they move on and then they come back and they realize the tree is withered to the root and they marvel and that's where jesus says that famous line and if you have faith amen the side as the grain of mustard seed you can say unto this mountain be plucked up and cast through the sea and if you doubt not in your heart it'll happen but i want to keep looking at this fig tree because we know the fig tree is a type of israel all right when you see the fig amen budding forth amen know that the time is nine brother bram tells us now very plainly that the fig tree represents israel and when jesus came in his first earthly journey he came to israel out of season it wasn't yet time for them to bear figs because the prophecy said that the nation will be born in a day and that will come at the day of the two witnesses at 144 000. so it looks as though jesus comes out of season amen out of time but it's right on time and he comes to israel amen and there's no figs that he can get from from the nation of israel amen they've got leaves but no figs amen and because it wasn't time for figs that'll come in the future in revelation chapter 11. so he curses that tree amen why because he has to reject he has to reject the jews to turn to the gentiles he has to blind them they have to reject him amen they can't bring forth fruit he's got to reject him and curse them they have to become a cursed people so that he can get a gentile bride so now they they they you say they missed their chance they didn't bring forth fruit he came at a time when it wasn't yet in season they have a time their time is coming when that tree will produce figs and when christ comes he'll find fruit on that tree but i want to look now at the turning to the gentiles because now he's turning to another tree not a fig tree but another tree let's look at ii peter ii peter chapter one second peter chapter one and verse three according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain into life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge and the knowledge temperance into temperance patience to patience godliness into godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful what was wrong with the fig tree it was unfruitful it wasn't in season it wasn't bearing but by the time you get to the end of the statue of a perfect man by the time the church comes through faith virtue temperance knowledge as the time the church gets all the way up to the capping of the capstone of charity amen when you come all the way through to the bride age and the capping of charity this if these things be in you in the church in the bride and they abound now the church will neither be barren or unfruitful why because now she will be a tree of life restored back amen julia bridetry restored back to the tree of life and she beareth amen did should bear 12 man or a fruit one for every month what does it mean it means this tree never goes out of season this tree every month new harvest new harvest pick pick pick all month new harvest every month this tree will never be barren or unfruitful because it has come to the divine nature built up amen all the way back through ephesus and smyrna and pergamus and thyatira built all the way up to finally the word is restored and the great charity capstone love union marriage whatever you want to say comes to the top and if all of these things be in this bride in the bright age it makes it so that she is neither barren nor unfruitful and christ can find fruit on this tree because she brings forth constantly makes you that you're neither barren nor fruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ let's go to psalms chapter 1. we are all over the bible tonight praise be to god psalms chapter 1. psalms 1 and verse 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and it is long does he meditate day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit and his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper say be like a man planted what does he meditate on the word of god his delight is the law or you could say the word of god his delight is the word of god and in the word does he meditate day and night what is the word bring the word is the spirit the spirit and the word come together his delight is the word receiving the spirit in the word which brings the spirit does he meditate day and night what's he doing drinking from the river he shall be like a tree i wonder what kind of tree maybe like a bride tree she'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of water water the water of life the word that bringeth forth his fruit in season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper why because he's drinking from the word drinking from the river of life that's flowing from the throne of god amen the pure water of life the pure water that washes the bride the pure water that brings with it life brother bram says in god identifying himself by his characteristics in 1964 said i come from tucson where it's really good and dry and i come here and it's really good and wet so there is quite a contrast if you all got all the water over here if you just send it over our way we'd appreciate it but you can't do that of course but i tell you one thing there is a parable there so you just explain you got water we don't got water this is a parable there's a parable there our things in arizona are trees it's full of stickers everything has a sticker it's because it's dry now if that same bush growed over here it'd be a nice lovely leaf see it's without water that's the reason it becomes a sticker and when the church becomes without the water of life it gets dry and sticky too sticking and punching and everything but where the waters of life flows it opens up the leaf and makes it tender mellow sweet holy and acceptable unto god so may the lord god water us tonight that we won't be stickers but we'll be fine leaves that the wayward people might sit down under the tree of our shade and find rest to their souls brother benham is typing a man like a tree just like proverbs 1 amen just like in eden just like in the paradises of god brother bear's doing the same thing he's drawing a parable between a tree and a man then over here in arizona he said if you take that same bush and plant it over here amen it wouldn't be sticky it wouldn't have stickers on it it would leaf would unroll and unfold amen and he's showing us what the word will produce amen because the word amen brings the water of life with it and you drink from the word the water of life not a sterile word not a word in print but a word with life a living word that's been given to us in this day is a crystal clear river that's flowing from the throne of god and if we drink from that it gives us sweetness and mellowness it makes us acceptable to god we bring forth fruit in season amen and the bride amen shall never be without fruit in her life in every circumstance and every month every change amen and season every change of the month every every thing you face there'll be more fruits 12 months 12 manner of fruit that means constantly through every change more fruit through every status in life through every season through every condition more fruit more fruit more fruit more fruit what is it the word that is being sucked up amen drunk in by the life now coming out as fruit that is on display with leaves that are tender and soft and lush and nourishing where the wayward souls can come and find rest wayward souls lost people can come and find rest in our shade why because we've drunk enough of the water of life that we're not a sticker we're not irritable cranky and angry and poking everybody but we become mellow and soft and tender and loving you see the drink from this river if you're if you're a bride tree part of the tree of life when you drink from this river you'll bring forth fruit you'll bring forth a life amen in that life we'll be reflecting what water you're drinking but when it gets irritable and cranky and bitter my question is what are you drinking what are you drinking why is it you're in conflict with everybody around you why is there always a hateful statement why is there always something mean and nasty why is there always irritation and strife and grumbling and complaining and fighting between individuals what is it if if if the lamb is here if the lamb's on his throne if the water of life is gushing forth if the tree of life is planted by the river of water and drinking forth this fresh clean water coming from the throne of god how how can it have the temperament of a cactus how can it be as fruitless as the fig tree out of season waiting someday someday some day no today amen someday i'll be changed someday it'll be different someday i'll get past this someday i'll go with this i said friends just drink from the river just take this word in delight in the word of the lord day and night amen always meditate on it day and night feast on it drink it in and let it produce fruit in our lives if you're the right tree all you need is the right condition the right tree just needs the right condition it needs the right light which has come in this age and it needs the right water that's coming this age we have everything we need to produce the life of jesus christ we don't need another move where we don't need another great a revival we don't need any we have everything has been given to us the full light is here amen to ripen the fruit the water of life is here and the full intent as it gushed out from the throne of god it's here to drink from to produce that fruit the light is here the water is here there is nothing lacking amen we've come amen to the divine nature amen through seven steps to the capping off and if these things be in you and about it makes you that you're neither unfruitful or barren in the knowledge of jesus christ where the water of life flows it opens the leaf and makes it tender mellow sweet holy and acceptable unto god so may the lord god water us tonight that we won't be stickers but will be fine leaves that the wayward people might sit down under the tree of our shade and find rest to their souls but the man says in christ is the mystery of god revealed he said when he come on earth he was the tree of life you believe that what tree of life the same one that was in the garden so you mean the body of jesus christ was back there in the garden it was the word it was the word of god that was there in the garden it was the word of god standing in flesh by the sea of galilee and it's the word of god that's come back to us today the same tree of life same one that was in eden same one all the way through and he came on earth he was the tree of life do you believe that and rome what did they do he had to be chopped down and he was put on a tree of disgrace cursed is he that hang on a tree he became a curse for the human race and now through that he brings forth a bride tree which will be the tree of life restored back to him catch that was he the tree of life when he was here on earth he was the tree of life same one that was in eden same one as any same one that'll be in the paradises of god the same one from revelations 22 same tree of life do we believe that that tree was chopped down so out of him could come the bride tree which will be the same tree of life restored back to him as husband and wife in the garden of eden oh glory to god by the same word the same god made manifest in husband and wife the same bride tree back again i say friends the bride tree is not a secondary tree to the tree of life the bride tree is the female part of the tree of life amen jesus christ is the bridegroom tree which is the tree of life amen the the bride tree amen is the tree of life the bridegroom tree is the tree of life because when you look in revelation 22 there's a tree on either side of the river but in the end of the book she she she bringeth forth her fruit in season why because the bridegroom the bridegroom tree and the bride tree has come together again christ has been given a virgin bride by the spoken word to do what to reproduce himself on the earth again to do what to bring forth the fruit of the tree of life the water's been restored the light's been restored the tree has been restored back to the tree of life to do what to bring forth the fruit of the resurrected jesus christ and human beings so that we're not stickers and we're not pricks and we're not poking people and no but we're tender mellow sweet humble and powerful but not by our own might powerful by our faith in the word of god and the word of god by word of god god is waiting for somebody to take his word and believe on it so he can act upon it powerful by faith in the word of god not by might an invincible army because she believes the word an invincible army because she's drinking of the water of life an invincible army because she's planted by the river of life invincible army because god is on the throne his third throne his church the city is represented here in the bride with a river of life in a tree of life and a throne of god in a city that's taking the light from the lamb and shining that light to the whole world why because you live in a transparent house of gold deity tabernacled in flesh god wanting to display what's inside on the outside let's all stand we're not going to go any further tonight that is my introduction see when we start to make when we start to make the symbols everyday life it takes the mysterious symbology garden of eden future home amen bring it right down here today what is the bread of life the word of god which is christ when i do when i receive the word of god really receive it by faith and bring it into myself amen what am i doing i'm feasting on the lamb and then i'm receiving the bread of life i'm eating the word and then that word and i become one i digest and then what comes out of me i drink from the river i'm married to christ see these are all expressions of the same thing eat the bread of life drink the water of life become one with christ it's all the same thing when christ presented himself as the word revealed word amen now to take that revealed word amen is to drink of the water of life and receive the spirit it is to eat the bread that come down from heaven and it is to be united with christ see brother these are all different ways of brother branham explaining the same thing they're not three different things they're the same thing what is it to receive the word by revelation when he opens the word to receive the word that's to receive your bridegroom to receive the spirit to drink of the water of life and now when we turn around and live that word you realize it's not just speaking the word brother branham could have never fulfilled his commission by just speaking the word he had to live the word the bride cannot just repeat like a parrot amen what brother benham said and expect to get the full benefit of the word but she has to live the word and when that word comes back out of her now it's rivers of living water flowing for somebody else to come and get a drink some wayward traveler to come and rest their weary soul under the shade of your tree because you've drunk and now you're constantly you're never out of season somebody at work treats you bad you're not out of season you have your wife doesn't misunderstand you you're not out of season something happens in the church you're not out of season why every change every opportunity every new month bringing forth fruit bringing forth fruit bringing forth fruit that is the bride tree restored to the tree of life what fruit are we bringing forth this written word alive in human flesh when route against ryle's not back that's fruit honest living with integrity that's fruit what are you doing shining forth the life of jesus christ by drinking receiving giving back out and a life lived this is why going and preaching on the corner amen may not get it done but living that life of jesus christ the word on display is what god is after every verse every line living in human flesh i don't know about you but i think it's time for her to bear forth her fruit in season christ has come this tree won't be like the jewish tree this tree is bringing forth all the time and to sing and shape and nothing satisfying there i found but to the blessed cross of christ one day i [Applause] came happy now am i my soul they satisfy when i'm drinking at the springs supply how sweet the living water from the hills of god it makes me glad and happy all the way [Applause] now glory [Music] of living water a wonderful and bountiful supply [Applause] the savior now invites you to the water creek where thirsting spirits can be satisfied

not you lord we realize that stickers and thorns and pricks we're asking lord for the only solution that will soften us up and that's your water of life flowing from your throne god your word is true your word is powerful it's able lord if we can just drink it and receive it not hear it in our ears and give a mental acknowledgement but receive it into us and say that's nothing but the truth and i have to have that life god let us become one with you our bridegroom let us embrace you now the revealed word the word that's been preached tonight let us wrap our arms around you and hold you tight
