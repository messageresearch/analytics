[0:00] the trouble of it is you're asking
[0:03] people to stand up and accept Christ as
[0:06] my personal testimony stand up like that
[0:10] and that's all they know about it worked
[0:12] up under a little mental enthusiasm the
[0:15] next thing you know it's
[0:20] gone the only way that man will ever
[0:23] stay is for him to lay down there and
[0:26] die out to himself and be reborn again
[0:30] by the spirit of God and filled with the
[0:32] Holy
[0:35] Ghost one way one prescription has it
[0:38] changed since the day of
[0:40] Pentecost don't think that we're going
[0:42] to come to this age and Proclaim and
[0:45] testify we know who Malachi 4 is and
[0:47] we're okay no where's the death to self
[0:51] where's the indwelling of the Holy
[0:55] Spirit where's the real New Birth not
[0:58] pretending
[1:00] I'm afraid we've watered down the holy
[1:03] spirit so much we will take that quote
[1:05] where brother brandom says the holy
[1:07] spirit is just a temporal gift to get
[1:09] you through this life the real gift is
[1:11] that soul in there and I believe that
[1:13] and I say yay and amen but I want to
[1:15] remind you what he said the Holy Spirit
[1:18] was given to you to get you through this
[1:21] life you are not going to get through
[1:24] this life without the Holy
[1:28] Spirit we should seek it it desperately
[1:31] every day of our life unless you don't
[1:34] want to get through this
[1:37] life you think that you have the
[1:40] capability to withstand Le oysa and
[1:43] however million demons were loosed on
[1:46] this age on the Bride of Jesus Christ in
[1:48] your own capacity without the Holy
[1:50] Spirit and say oh well I've got the real
[1:53] gift of Soul inside I don't it's
[1:55] temporal I'll take it or leave it no
[1:57] you're going to find yourself in a house
[1:58] with the padded walls is where you're
[2:00] going to find yourself wrecked up
[2:02] pretending to be a Christian you
[2:05] desperately need the Holy Spirit I
[2:07] desperately need the Holy Spirit every
[2:09] day of my life just to get through
[2:14] life don't water down the spirit of God
[2:17] there was a life that was given for that
[2:21] the life of God was given for that the
[2:23] life of God was given to release that
[2:25] Spirit on me and you just so we could
[2:27] get through this life
[2:30] amen
