prove me he he he didn't say just you know set it home and you know if you feel like it come down and throw something in the bucket no he say improve me he says don't come in our day don't come and set in a message church and get lost in the crowds I wrote in my Bible back in the 80s I think it was uh inside one of my Bibles and it says there's safety and numbers because I just really felt like I could go and just set and and no one would see me right but we're we're way pass that amen and so we we have to come into the body and we have to expect God to prove who he says we are amen amen I I want that I I you know I don't want a boyfriend girlfriend relationship I want to make love to Jesus Christ right and so he has to know that we are all in amen and you know how he proves that is when he pulls you through the fiery trials because you you come down and you're just emptied out and you can't go any farther and you say blessed be the name of the Lord right I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you and so he says and prove me now here with sayeth the Lord of hosts if I will not open up the windows of Heaven Amen in our day he has opened the windows of Heaven of this word and and we still see overt Supernatural right praise the Lord but I think in the last year or so I've seen more Supernatural coming to pass of the word in our life in our attitudes in our relationships than I've ever seen amen amen the ministry coming into the pulpit and speaking back the very things that you're thinking on or you've prayed about right that's a supernatural God that's the spirit of discernment that's the Holy Ghost right Hallelujah if I will not open up the windows of Heaven no one should be sad no one should be down oh why isn't God moving fast enough oh he is he's just waiting for us to stop saying that right amen hallelujah and pour you out a blessing that you shall not be room enough to receive it God Amen right amen we're not talking money right we're talking about you being so in love with Jesus Christ that every word he speaks you say it is written that's thus sayth the Lord amen and then you wait on on the outpouring of that word it it's even the word comes and and it it it it it forms and creates the atmosphere in your house so that when you even your language changes to where when you're when you're speaking to the family then it's it's it's like you you're you're creating the outcome prise oh Hallelujah because after all we're little messes praise the Lord
