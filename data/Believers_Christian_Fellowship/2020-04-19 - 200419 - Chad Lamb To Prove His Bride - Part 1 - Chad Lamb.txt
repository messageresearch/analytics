TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] here i am again just to worship you [Music] to lift my voice in grace [Music] yesterday [Music] here i am [Music] one more time here i am [Music] in praise [Music] yesterday today [Music] forever i will praise your holy name here i am again [Music] praise the lord don't you love to worship him don't you love to tell him how wonderful he is and how much you appreciate him amen that it's certainly good to be here with you today and it's nice to see the families together and some of the sisters are able to join us the singing is much nicer and god bless you we just appreciate it while we're standing let's take our bibles and we'll go to first corinthians and we'll read this scripture and pray we'll let you have your seeds look at first corinthians chapter three verse 18. first corinthians 3 and 18 let no man deceive himself if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise hallelujah what a statement let him become a fool that he may be wise for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain so many times we think wisdom is the pinnacle of everything but only godly wisdom is the wisdom of man is just vain and let's bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you god for this day and this opportunity to be here though we appreciate god that you've allowed us this privilege where we can gather together even if it's not the whole congregation but this is a privilege for us lord we don't take it lightly but we want to thank you god and we want to worship you with full hearts and when i ask lord that you would just take this vessel of clay inadequate and incapable as a human being but in your hand you can do all things lord we ask that you would move the man out of the way but you would come yourself by the power of your holy spirit and preach your eternal words of life lord then we might receive exactly what we have need of in this hour that we're living for we can look nowhere else but to you lord for leadership because there is no other leadership that can lead us through we love your god and ask your blessings over everything that will be said bless our ears to hear in our hearts to perceive all that you have for us in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated if you can just keep your spot here in the bible i want to give you a little update i saw uh brother steve and sister marsha here on friday brother steve's having a hard time keeping out of the office so he came in to get a little work done so it was really good to see him and sister marshall was actually here at the prayer time on friday and it was really good to see them and see they're doing good they're improving brother steve still has a little bit of weakness but he's getting better and better we thank god for that and also sister bessie's doing really well she's really made a good bounce back and brother dave's been doing great no symptoms but he's been under quarantine and he told me his quarantine's supposed to lift tomorrow so he is looking forward to that he told me he's just gonna pack a lunch get in the car and take a long drive somewhere so i just pray the lord will bless him with a beautiful sunny day and clear roads and letting him and his wife enjoy their time out but he's been stuck in the house and brother dave doesn't do well stuck in the house and so he's been under a different kind of trial also i had the privilege yesterday of talking to brother gene petry he's in the hospital in an icu unit and he's been there for several days and it looks like he'll be there several more days he had double pneumonia the bad case of pneumonia in both lungs so he's getting treatment there but he's responding to it he's still tired he's still sick he needs the lord to deliver him but he was in good spirits when i talked to him yesterday and i talked to him the day before and you know he was really tired and weak and from one day to the next the next day i talked to him he started quoting scripture and when he started quoting scripture to me i knew things were on the upswing and he started talking about the word and started talking about you know connections he was making in the message and i thought praise the lord god bless brother gene and he told me the only people he has to witness to is the people coming in to care for him so he's witnessing down there so god bless him just keep praying for him he's still in serious condition but stable he needs the lord to touch him he's still very sick so just keep praying for him and for his family as well so we appreciate that i also say it's really nice to be able to have some more together i thank god for this opportunity you know most of the world is completely shut down and then completely shot doors closed no opportunity but by the grace of god ohio is deemed churches religious institutions an essential business and allow the doors to stay open and we have to fulfill some requirements we have to do you know what's in the order for us to do but that to me that's a small price to pay to be able to gather together and worship the lord it's not the way we would like to do it but i thank god that we can be here and i can see your face and we can worship together so it's a privilege that we shouldn't take lightly because very few in the world have this privilege we just want to thank god for that and we want to respect them also i want to say it's really hard not to have the older ones with us our older brothers and sisters because you know we would have no church we would have nothing without them they're our fathers and our mothers they're the one who's paid for this building they're the one who paid for the camera to have streaming they're the one who who's labored to keep the message and stay true to the word and keep things going we would have nothing we have if it wasn't for our older brothers and sisters so it's we would love to give them a place of preference amen that they would get to go first and not us but it's just the way things are in the situation we find ourselves in this is the way it needs to be but it's no lack of respect for them we have tremendous respect and we've had some threats of an uprising but but praise the lord because they're also the most faithful and they've been the most faithful for the longest and this is a trial for them too and just keep praying for them and we just want to say that we love you we appreciate all you've done for us because we couldn't be here if it wasn't for you all and you're in our thoughts and in our prayers and we think of you often and we can't wait till things change and with with with no restriction we can all come back together and and worship the way we want to i also want to say that we had nice to see people at the prayer time friday and yesterday it was really a special time i came in at the end yesterday and just broke down you know because it was such an atmosphere when god's people are praying you know i usually come in and pray at the beginning of the prayer time so at five yesterday i came in and prayed and the people were just in and out at different times praying and there's just a few people at a time they come in and pray and then go and then somebody else will slip in but when i come at the end of that prayer time after five hours something's different and uh there's an atmosphere that you just can't explain and so i just appreciate god's people coming together to pray i appreciate having that privilege as well and i know many of you are praying in your homes i know you're remembering you know the rest of the body the rest of the bride and we appreciate that and i know for a lot of people this has been a time of revival and refreshing and renewing because some people have had less work or no work and time at home as a family and i've heard from several people they've listened to a ton of messages they've read books they've went back and streamed archives and streamed other services from other places and so for a lot of people this has been a strengthening time and i thank god for that because i feel like this is a time to get stronger for what comes next and we always like to think that when this trial is over everything well you realize this one's just building for the next and the next we'll build for the one after that and god is just training us and strengthening us and building us for what he wants to accomplish in this day that we live in and so we always think we'll be out of the woods after this one but it hasn't happened yet i mean it just hasn't happened brother branham said you know you're either going into a trial in a trial you're coming out of a trial so if you're out of one just beware there's another one coming somewhere we didn't come to this life for a picnic we're not here for pleasure we're here for training and training for reigning and god is going to accomplish his purpose in us he's going to help us to go through enough of the negatives and enough of the up and downs to know that we can trust his word and his word only and we're going to know his characteristics and we know his character we're going to have a love for him a profound love for him because we've seen the contrast and so that's what god is accomplishing and we want to let him accomplish it and i i don't want to begrudge the things that he allows to come our way because it's accomplishing his purpose i don't want to be too upset it's not what i like and i've expressed some of my dislike and i have to repent for that but i thank god that he knows what's best and he knows what we need and he knows when we need it and he gives it to us exactly when we have need of it so this trial is also accomplishing something good in his kingdom and that we're thankful for we just want to ask god to have his absolute perfect way with us uh this morning i'd like to take as a subject to the the title to prove his bride to prove his bride and these are nothing new that i want to share in fact it's a review of many things we've been talking about for quite a while and it's just the way the lord has led and this is the inspiration that he's given for today and i myself have been looking for different inspiration i waited all day for two days i wanted to go in a different direction i said god we want something fresh something different let's forget about our troubles and our trials and let's launch into new territory and open up the word but but you know you can't make god open something if he doesn't open it and you can't get away of god's leading if god wants to go one direction no matter how much you want to go another direction you can't go another direction it's impossible and and so here we are god wants us to glean all that we can out of this time and learn all that we can from the circumstances we're in and so we're going to talk some about those things but but let's look at this scripture again in first corinthians chapter 3 and verse 18. let not man let no man deceive himself if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain so our goal in this life is not to have more worldly wisdom but you know everyone around us is moving in a different direction because the goal is more education and more knowledge and more wisdom and and you know to grow and increase in these things that are in this world but for us we have to deny the things that are in the world to seek after the wisdom that comes from god which is foolishness to this world so we have to if if we even consider ourselves to be wise we must become fools that we may be wise because the wisdom that we're seeking is not the wisdom is not what the world calls wisdom it's not what those in the world would look to his wisdom it looks to them like foolishness but to god it is the true wisdom because to god the wisdom of man is foolishness because god you know he's all-knowing and supreme in every way and the wisdom of man is trying to outpace god and trying to prove that there is no god or trying in their own foolishness to prove god but all they're doing is proving a god of their own thinking of their own understanding and god is watching the whole thing and to him it's absolute rubbish it's childish it's foolishness but man is thought he's achieved to such a pinnacle of wisdom he thinks that he's come to such a place it must be like the tower of babel you know where they they think they've come to such a wisdom such an achievement that somehow they can outsmart god that they can build a tower that will somehow uh give them a power and an ability to overcome the judgments of god and and god destroyed the whole thing and now we've come back in many ways by science to a tower of bible where where man believes that he can you know he can take care of himself and he can whatever obstacles you know if we pull our resources in the world we can overcome this thing but god's proving that the wisdom of man is foolishness man doesn't know he doesn't know what's happening tomorrow he doesn't know what's happening next week he doesn't know how to protect himself or save himself he doesn't know what he's doing and it becomes more apparent all of the time but the wise just think they're wise but to become a fool is my desire to become a fool for christ just to take him at his word you know we all got an education of some sort it was the law and that education brother branham tells us you need in this life he said you need he said i'm not i'm not promoting ignorance you need some sort of education and depending on your job depends on how much education you need to work your occupation to do your job and brother branham wasn't saying that that in itself was wrong but he's trying to get us to look and not to look at that and depend on that for anything eternal or anything in the kingdom of god because that means nothing in the eternal nothing to the kingdom of god that's just a temporary thing for a temporary life because we've come down to in this life and to do that we need certain things and a certain amount of education in a certain amount of training because he's accomplishing something through it all but the real thing that we need is not the education and the training for the job but the real thing we need is education and training in the word of god and how to stand on the word of god and the word only and so you know when i when i preach on this i've told myself over and over chad be careful because i don't want to push something too hard i don't want to get my own nature involved and that happens so many times i get my own thinking own nature and i push something too hard because i don't want this morning to push anything too hard i just want to share what's on my heart amen so so paul and i told one brother i said if you see me going too strong stop pooling amen because we're always susceptible of injecting ourselves and our own nature but i want to look at things the way god looks at them amen and i want to have god's perspective on things not my own and not the worlds and not anybody else's let's go to first corinthians chapter one and let's look at another scripture here don't exactly know where we're going to get to uh this has been unusual for me it's been a different kind of preparation but usually i like i have lots and lots of time and lots and lots of no's and usually i'm cutting out pages of notes and i think last night at 11 i had one quote yeah i'm preaching like an evangelist but you know it's because i i want to go somewhere else i want to talk about something else and god would give me no inspiration i labored all day for other inspiration but god this is all they gave me and this morning he just tied all these thoughts that have been random in my mind and he lined them up for me so i could see a vein so i just pray that you just relax in the spirit pull on the word of god and let's see what god has to share with us this morning first corinthians chapter 1 verse 26 for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but god has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and the base things of the world and the things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are you in christ jesus who of god has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth led him glory in the lord so you know this scripture is opposite of what the world is looking for brother bram said the world is looking for a superman they're looking for somebody that and brother bam said they're looking for a president that can outsmart russia you know they're looking for someone that can win the arms race or or or win the trade uh whatever the trade war and somebody that can bring a better economy and somebody that can outsmart or fix all these problems and and they're looking for a mighty man they're looking for a superhero they're looking for the super intelligent they're looking for the phds amen and every leader that they want you know man wants a leader who's strong and capable and and can overcome great obstacles that's the leader that the man's looking for and the church is the same way i mean they want their pastor to be good-looking and they want their pastor to be smart and they want their pastor to be witty and funny and and serious and all those other things and so i'm sorry to disappoint you in all of those areas but god's not taking that kind to display his word god is taking the base things of the world god is taking the humble he's taking the weak amen because god wants to be the only one who gets glory that all our glory will be in him because we realize our frailty our weakness we're not capable of doing these things we're not capable of doing what he asked us to do we're not capable of of being wise enough to navigate through this world and i think as things have changed for us in the last several weeks we've come to the realization that i don't have the wisdom to figure out what's happening i don't have the wisdom to figure out what's happening i have no idea what's happening next you know the governor made a statement that maybe they'll start rolling back things may 1st i have no idea what's going to happen may 1st he doesn't have an idea what's going to happen may 1st and so we realized that god is weakening everything and and one of the places that he's weakening is he's weakening us he's weakening us in our own uh uh our own wisdom our own uh knowledge our own ability to figure something out because we realize we haven't figured anything out correct yet we've guessed and probed and maybe got close and maybe been far off and all these things but we realize when god does something he does it it's sure it's solid amen and he doesn't do it according to our understanding and so he's weakening us in our own intelligence he's weakening us in our own wisdom amen because that's the thing that he wants to use he wants to use things that are not to bring to not things that are god is not looking for a superhuman to accomplish his goals when he came himself amen he had no form or comingness that we should adore him that we should want him and then he was despised and rejected brother bannon said he was stoop shouldered and a small man right he didn't come as a hulk he doesn't come as a military mind he become meek and lowly i mean that's what god that's what god's wanting that's what god's doing so he'll take us in all of our wisdom and ability and he'll pull the rug out from under us and that's a good thing he'll flatten us and he'll say hey you know don't worry just follow me it'll be all right amen you don't have to have anything figured out you don't have to be smart you don't have to be wise amen you don't have to be able to predict the future you don't have to have an angle you know we don't have to have an angle we don't have to know what's coming next that's not what god needs god needs somebody who knows they don't know he has somebody who's been abased and knows that they don't know anything he had to take an apostle paul until apostle paul said all of these things my resume i count as done i had a nice resume and it accomplished lot in the religion of the jews because they like a nice resume the jewish religion they liked the pedigree and they they liked accomplishment and they liked the zeal and they liked that he come from the school of gamaliel and they they liked the uh that he was you know a jew by birth of the tribe of benjamin a pharisee by faith zealous for the word of god my he was ticking every box amen for the jewish leaders and they got paul he was the up and coming amen but god wanted paul for his own purpose but he didn't want paul that way so god flattened paul amen and paul realized everything i knew i didn't really know correctly amen everything i thought i knew i found out i was wrong and he abased paul amen he blinded him because paul thought he could see [Music] so he blinded him so he could realize he was a blind man and that he would need one of these saints that he was running to persecute one of these that he hated one of these that he called a heretic and an ignorant you know who knows who knows what paul would have called these christians what names he would have used about their heretics and this new you know this new faith and and that they're leaving the faith and we got to defend the faith who knows what they would say but now he got paul in the condition where paul was going to need one of these people he was persecuting and hating to come and lay hands on him so that he could see why because that's what god wants he wants something humble and abased and will forget everything they knew moses was trained in all the military might and wisdom of the egyptians brother bam said he could teach the egyptians raised with the best tutors and the best education in pharaoh's house but that's not the way god wanted moses he just wanted moses but he didn't want moses education and he didn't want moses's wisdom he didn't want moses ability he just wanted moses he just wanted paul and he didn't want paul with all the scholarly achievements he wanted paul and when he got paul to where he wanted paul says i count everything before i count it is done i give it up i lose it all that i might no know him and then god had a paul that he could use and guess what all those characteristics that made paul what he was were the characteristics god still wanted to use but he wanted it humble and he wanted it based he wanted his own way so god had chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise because the wise can't figure it out because it's achieved by faith and there's no figuring out faith and god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty in the base things of the world and the things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are you in christ jesus who if god has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption where is our wisdom in him our righteousness is in him our sanctification is in him and our redemption is in him that according as it is written he hath he that glorieth led him glory in the lord let's turn to the book of acts and look at acts chapter 4. acts chapter 4 and verse 13. i was going to pull one little scripture out of a story here and not take time for the whole story but acts 4 13 now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled why did they marvel because they were ignorant and unlearned but yet they were bold in the face of the council they would answer according to the scripture they would answer according to their faith they weren't intimidated they weren't backing down but yet they were ignorant and unlearned and and when they perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus why because they had no record of what school jesus came out of amen and they reckon him to be the same way ignorant and unlearned i mean where did this man learn letters where did he learn these things at 12 years old he's disputing with them in the temple where did he learn those things what school did he go to what was his pedigree and jesus had none amen and so now when he comes up with two more amen they begin to act like jesus they're the base things of the world these are fishermen god chose if you look at god's choosing god when he begins to choose for his disciples he goes and chooses men who are washing out their nets after a day's catch i mean this is not these are not the allies that you would choose if you were starting a new political move and if you wanted to start a new denomination these are not the guys to pick but jesus is not interested in a political move he is not interested in a denomination he is interested in the word amen he's interested in accomplishing the word of god amen and god and god doesn't need wisdom your wisdom he doesn't need your strength he doesn't need your ability he just needs you as a weak broken humble base vessel so that anything that's accomplished the credit all goes to him because when they looked at peter and john and they realized they were ignorant and unlearned they marveled they didn't marvel at john and and peter being wise and so smart they marvel that they're being unlearned they're able to answer this way in boldness amen and and confirming the word amen they marveled and they took note that they had been with jesus who was getting the credit what were they crediting with their boldness what were they crediting with their answers amen it wasn't those two guys because they knew they were ignorant and unlearned fishermen but they realized when they saw the boldness and they saw the answer and they saw the miracle they realized that they had been with jesus and if i if there's anything that i can accomplish in this life if they could just realize i've been with jesus because they i want them to look at me and say that man he's got nothing which is the truth i've got nothing i literally have nothing i have no big bank account i have no extra funds amen if if my paycheck went away tomorrow i've got about three four weeks and i'm done amen i don't have i don't have anything no super wisdom no super powers no super intelligence no formal education i barely got out of high school and i graduated because i went to vocational school because i was bored in school i hated it so i went to vocational school just because at least you get to do stuff you know and you know and vocational school wasn't a high level of education for me because all i was learning to do was electrocute people and blow stuff up and so i didn't get you know the best education but god wasn't interested in that like many of you i come from broken home from family situations that were not pleasant from disasters come from raised in denomination raised in independent pentecostal churches and assembly of god pentecostal churches raised all of these ways i had no understanding i thought i knew something but i realized when first time i got a hold of a message book that i didn't know nothing and when i i got a concordance my wife bought me a concordance because i thought man i'm the smartest guy in town i have a concordance and i could look up any word in the bible and i could read every every scripture where this word is used and i was a smart duck until brother jeremy came along and he gave me a church ages book and i realized that concordance that i thought made me smart that concordance unraveled with the church age book in that concordance and unraveled everything that i'd been taught all my life so there's no heritage there's there's no heritage in the message there's no knowing things the right way or learning them the right way or pedigreed or education or understanding or any super ability because that's what god's looking for that's what he wants he wants the handicap he needed the halt lame and blind to show that he was fulfilling the word and that he was the messiah he needed the fishermen who were ignorant and unlearned brother branham said peter couldn't sign his own name ignorant and unlearned and that's what god was looking for then when he when he got somebody with a little bit of education he chose a tax collector to make sure he was hated and despised god's choice what's god looking for he's not looking for fineries he's not looking for wisdom he's not looking for power he's not looking for strength he's looking for a vessel that he can use a predestinated ordained vessel and that predestinated ordained vessel he has to get it in a condition where it has no dependency on itself so that it can be utterly dependent on him and when it can be utterly dependent on him then he can accomplish his purpose so when god abases it's a good thing and when god amen you say how could god choose me how could he not choose you i've had people tell me before i've had such a terrible life if you knew the things i've done if you knew the things i've been through if you knew the sin in my life and blah blah blah blah blah and i'm just thinking perfect how's this different than anybody in the scriptures you know so many times people struggle but my situation but my marriage but my family but but my parents but my but but that's perfect you realize god wants things that are broken so when they're fixed he gets the glory and so don't ever don't ever downplay what god doing how could it be me or why did he choose me or or why hey if you feel like you're unworthy to be one of them then praise god you're probably one of them at least you're getting close to where god wants us to be brother madam says in things that are to be from december of 1965 it's now in this world that we live in this education i want to prove to you education science civilization and all these things that we seemingly so enjoy today is of satan and will perish i'm going to say this clear because brother branham said it clear and and and not mince words but but education science civilization and all these things that we seemingly so enjoy today is of satan now i say it but i also want to include brother remember said now we need an education to live in this life and products that science have produced we use i mean we use cell phones we drive a car brother bam said man in this wisdom intelligence made a car he kills more people with the automobile right because whatever man does has an element of death attached to it it's never perfect he said he made penicillin and that was a great thing for mankind and brother branham said it was a great thing but sometimes the penicillin kills because man cannot get anything perfectly right everything he does has an element of death attached to it but yet we'll take the penicillin we'll drive in the car brother ben said we need automobiles when jesus was here he rode a donkey he ate in an upper room slept in a house rode in a boat you understand we're in this life amen in the way this life is constructed god has ordained us to live in this life that means a certain element of education a certain element of science even some benefits to our physical body from science right brother branham had no problem taking medicine he did so it's it's not that we will throw all that away and become amish that's not the point so don't don't make me say something i'm not or brother bam say something he's not but what he's trying to get you to see is don't put any confidence in those things because that car that we love can kill you that tablet that can help you might kill you when you get in the car amen and you turn the key it's got to take an element of faith to know that god's going to keep me and get me to my destination safely it's not this car that's going to do it and it's not the airbag that they engineered but it's going to be god that gets me safely to my destination and if god has led me to some medical help and i have faith that god wants me to take this medication then i've got faith that god wants me to take this medication and faith is what's going to make it work because if we put too much faith in the airbag or too much faith in the medicine god is going to let that fail us at some point so you realize i can't put my faith in education science and man's achievement i can only put my faith in the word of god but yet we live in this life as creatures in this world because that's how he wants to be displayed he wants to be seen in your clothes in your car and in your house at your job that's how he wants to be displayed because that's how he was displayed when he was here and whatever the whatever was in the culture he was in the culture whatever was whatever technology was available he was using that technology we understand that but yet god when he was in christ he was not limited by that civilization or that technology he used it but wasn't limited by it because he knew it had limits right when the boat would fail he could walk on the water when the when the bakery was not sufficient to feed 5 000 he could multiply bread so although although he would send his treasurer into a town to buy food you understand he would send the treasure into the town to buy food what's he doing living a normal life living like everybody else we need a little money we'll take a little money and we go buy us a little food you go fetch the food and bring it back here well i talked to this woman at the well he would send judas to go give some money to the poor he sent judas after an errand he would send two to go make the upper room ready right he was living like a man amen like we're supposed to live but he was not bound by that technology he was not bound by that civilization any time that civilization would hinder the word of god he would just step over that science and education and civilization and accomplish what he had to accomplish for the word of god so my brother ben said we go out on the limb of knowledge of good and evil we go to the doctor but we go so far until they can't help us no more and we jump over to the tree of life because where man has limits god has no limits why i said i don't want to push this too hard in one way because we've got to understand we're creatures amen that we're supposed to live in this dimension in this time element to perform what god wants us to perform to accomplish what he wants accomplished and it's going to take a car it's going to take whatever means that god wants us to use but we should put no faith in those things we should have no confidence in them because every one of them are limited and they will all fail his education science civilization and all these things that we seemingly so enjoy today as of satan and will perish you say brother random civilization yes sir this civilization came by come by satan genesis 4 proves it cain's son sees started this civilization building cities and organs and so forth and civilization came by knowledge knowledge is what the devil sold eve in the garden of eden and that caused her to to cross her to cramp transgress god's commandment so there will be a civilization in the world that we're going to but it won't be this kind of civilization for in this civilization we have sickness sorrow lust death everything in this civilization wrong but in that civilization there will be none of these things we don't need science hallelujah science is the perversion of the original anyhow you split a molecule to split atoms and do so and so to blow you up you take gun powder bang this to kill something you take the car and take gasoline out of the earth and the materials out of there to loosen it up the fibers so it can blow up and go down the road at 90 miles per hour and kill somebody see oh so nervous squeeze and hurry up we got to push and taking oh see it's all of the devil the kingdom of god will not have automobiles airplanes or any scientific achievements oh hallelujah i don't know why that sounds so good to me but it must be i originate from some place like that because when i hear something like that it feels so good to me that's the place i want to be it won't have any education at all it'll be an education so supreme to this that this won't even be thought of see education civilization and all this comes from satan 1965 power of transformation now he had six thousand years to do it with his poison spray and how did he do it now this is the striking part and listen close now he did it by civilization which is only about six thousand years to make satan's eden how did he do it he did it by civilization now that sounds strange but that's what i'm going to make a statement here that will keep you guessing maybe for a few minutes i hope not but did you realize this no i'm not trying to support ignorance but did you know that civilization science education and the things that we cherish so great today is the very instrument of satan even civilization civilization never come by god civilization come by satan now i'll prove that to you by the word just in a few minutes civilization is not of god for let me show you in this civilization the more civilized we get as we work through science we are always killing ourselves and this civilization has built up to this pinnacle now and we got death in this civilization we got sin in this civilization we got sickness in this civilization that can't be of god so god in this great own great kingdom that is to come will have a civilization but it will not be anything like this it won't be by science it'll be a faith civilization by the word hallelujah it'll be a faith civilization by the word amen guess what we're already part of that kingdom do you believe you're already a citizen of that kingdom then we need to operate by faith in the word we need to operate according to the civilization we're going to and while we're in this civilization the greatest thing to us has got to be faith by the word that everything is conquered by faith everything is overcome by faith in the word of god that that science is not my uh science is not my savior the word is my savior the government is not my savior civilization is not my savior but the word of god jesus christ himself is my savior he is the strong tower that the righteous run into are safe not a civilization not a scientific achievement not a program none of that but the only thing that i run into and i'm safe is in jesus christ he is the strong tower he is the word he is the one with the feathers that i hide under it's him and him only we work in a realm in our physical and our physical attribute we work in a realm of science and education and civilization but we're not from this world we're from another world and that other world is a faith civilization this is a civilization based on unbelief it was founded on unbelief it's rooted in unbelief and it's expressing unbelief where we come from a civilization that's rooted in faith amen grounded in faith amen and faith in the word of god amen because in us is the word and the word made spirit and life is the kingdom so the kingdom of god is within us that's what we have to live by that's the set of rules we live by but that doesn't put us in communal living in montana on the backside of a desert puts us right here walking like the disciples were ignorant and unlearned but they took note they had been with jesus because they believed something that changed their whole life they believed something that gave them a different perspective on every situation that they now face where once they were intimidated and fearful afraid of the council afraid of the jews amen afraid to be taken captive amen and all the sudden when that seed quickened to life with the baptism of the holy ghost they ran out preaching the gospel amen no longer intimidated no longer afraid amen because faith was awakened they realized that they were citizens of this kingdom they have nothing to be afraid of they were arrested but they had nothing to be afraid of they were beaten but they had nothing to be afraid of they were killed but they had nothing to be afraid of you realize god allowed god allowed the governments of those days to take his apostles and nail them upside down on a cross and they had no power to resist it why because it was the will of god but yet inside of them was enough power to speak a world into existence and go live a private life on it but it was controlled by a law a law of faith and without a commandment they couldn't have faith to speak it into existence without god giving them permission they didn't have faith to move it into existence and so if god said you're going to be nailed to a cross then they were going to be nailed to a cross with enough power in them to change the whole circumstances jesus christ when he was spit on and beaten and mocked and nailed to a cross there was enough power in him and the power that created the whole world was resting in him enough power to change the whole circumstances but he wouldn't because it pleased the father to be here so you realize it's power under control it's got to be power under the control of god and that's what we're seeking in this civilization to operate by faith not intellect not reasoning not selfish desire not willfulness but that our lives are conducted and directed by faith the spirit of god moves and we respond let's look at galatians chapter 2. galatians chapter 2 and verse 20. this is paul the apostle paul after his conversion galatians 2 and 20. i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me paul was saying the life that i now live in the flesh this life where paul rides on a ship right where paul maybe uses a cart where paul writes letters where paul uses language where paul in this life he now lives in the flesh he lives by the faith of the son of god not in the son of god it's the same faith and the life that we live in the flesh we live by the faith of the son of god not faith in our civilization not faith in our government not faith in science but faith in god the faith of the son of god let's go to second corinthians 10. i just want to lay these in and then move on second corinthians 10 and 4. for the weapon of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations in every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ you realize this is what we have to do every day because every day we have to cast down imaginations in every high thing that exalted self against the knowledge of god because every message that we get every day is against the knowledge of god everything science and education and civilization pushes through your cell phone to you is contrary to faith in the word of god it's contrary amen to it's it's every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ do you realize that as you if you go to your cell phone and you watch the news you're going to have to apply this scripture because you're going to hear things that are contrary to the word of god you're going to hear things that are absolutely opposite of what told us in the word amen the news is going to tell you you're in danger the word's going to tell you you're safe the news is going to tell you to be afraid but but he's going to tell you fear not so we're going to have to as we watch the news and it's not that we don't read the news brother branham read the newspaper he listened to the radio it's not that we don't catch the news but we must have this scripture active in us all the time that these thoughts that are coming in where are they coming from science civilization education and it's of the devil trying to get in my mind a cloud to come into my mind to get me to drop my faith in the word of god and as i begin to drop my faith in the word of god the devil begins to push me into all kinds of circumstances where faith would ride over everyone now the waves begin cresting over the ship all because i haven't kept faith in the word the primary thing i spent too much time in social media too much time in the news too much time in these things and not enough time in the word of god and now i'm from a faith civilization going to a faith civilization living in the midst of an unbelieving civilization and i've got to be on guard all the time to bring every thought captive into the obedience of christ which is the word and so we realize that this is a battle every day we have to know where we're at we have to know who we are and not just duly walk through this life with our senses dulled not keenly aware what's going on the the media and now you know with this social media has the ability to influence the whole world in a way of thinking in a matter of hours or days they can put out some social media blurbs pass it through facebook twitter whatever in a few hours they can have hundreds or thousands of people gather in a capital in a capital city for a protest nobody mailed a letter they don't even send emails anymore it's too slow take their phone got an idea send out the idea if a few people pass it along in a matter of hours and a day or two they can get three or four thousand people to show up in lansing michigan to protest something you realize what power that is but that's not how we're supposed to live we're supposed to be influenced by the word of god and only by the word of god amen we're supposed to have faith faith is supposed to be the thing that moves us not doubt not unbelief not suspicion not hearsay amen not not not conspiracy theories none of those things should move us we should be moved by faith in the word of god and sometimes we get into a place and god allows us to come to a place where we don't know where to move next but we're of a faith civilization without the wisdom of the world because the wisdom of the world when you get into a place where you don't know where to go next they call a council they bring the wise men together they make a decision and they move forward but the children of god don't move that way the children of god when they get back to in the corner they don't know where to go they can't move without faith so they have to hold still because this isn't wisdom this isn't a figuring out god this isn't a figuring out my circumstances this is resting in the leadership of the holy ghost to lead me in the plan of god and if we're going to go by faith we've got to go all the way by faith because god will lead by faith and he'll lead us down a dead-end road seemingly but if we're going to go down there by faith then when we get to the end of that road we're going to have to sit there by faith until faith opens up another way you can't go down there by faith amen and get out by reasoning if you do you're going to miss the tremendous victory that's getting ready to take place you're going to miss the parting of the waters you're going to miss the moving amen the moving of god when we go when we're led by faith we've got to stay put by faith until faith opens up another way and many times god leads us in ways we didn't anticipate and we didn't expect and it wasn't the answer that we wanted but when god gives it god gives it brother kyle was preaching on uh wednesday you got armor got a sword got all the power of the word all power of heaven here to back you up is it true the fullness of the word is here with the full life of the holy ghost here to back it up to enforce your claims power like like unspeakable amounts of power is here with the bride do you believe that but it's power under control and when god says yeah you look good everything's on right you did a good job now go sit down my goodness that's not what you wanted to hear i wanted to hear speak to squirrels talk to the mountain i wanted to hear do this supernatural thing i i wanted to hear make custer's last stand make him shoot you in the pulpit you know that's the nature of man god god is going to break every idea that we have every thought about power and strength and ability and break it down do we say okay god i don't know what to do next i'm just waiting for you i don't know where to go yeah you've led me here i know you've led me here followed you here where do we step next i don't know then he opens up a way and you say no no that's not a good way it can't be that way but if we're going to go by faith we've got to go all the way by faith faith doesn't work according to wisdom god's wisdom is so much different than our wisdom god's ways are so much higher than our ways but he chooses the base the low the humble and he does great things brother branham says in the god of this evil age from uh august of 1965. so what would god call a people out of this evil age for this is a good question what would god call people of this evil age for his name the reason that it is is to try her his bride when she has made manifest been tried been proven proved to satan like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end so why did god call a people out of this evil age to prove his bride a couple paragraphs later he says we find now this evil age is to prove to satan she is not like eve that she is not that type of a woman and she will be tried by his word the bride as adam's bride was tried by the word so god now is he's bringing the whole redemption story full circle now because he had an adam first adam and he had an last adam and he had a first woman of first even he's going to have a last eve and and then this first adam his bride she was living in a perfect world of righteousness everything perfect godly it was a faith civilization friends it was what we're going back to it was perfect in every way everything was in harmony it was a perfect peace it was a perfect innocency it was a perfect life everything was perfect and in the perfect world the serpent came in the devil through the serpent and begowed eve in god's perfection amen and deceived the woman and by that came the fall so god now is going to bring a full circle of redemption and now he's going to let satan produce his own eden and now we've got a message brother branham preached at the end of august of 1965 and called satan's eden and now when it comes to satan's eden everything has come to satan's perfection to where to where he can move the masses with his technology with his scientific achievements and his governments and his civilization and education he can control the whole world he's come to the peak of satan's eden to this evil age which is this age that we live in but this is the age god chose to call his bride amen his perfect image of a perfect bride come back to seed again why this age because he wants to prove to satan she's not like eve you could get even perfection but this one's going to come in your perfection and he's going to and you've defiled my perfection but this woman's coming to defile your perfection coming to destroy and disrupt your education in science and achievements and civilization and governments are all going to come to not he's going to take the things that are not of this world and bring to not the things that are and why did he bring a little humble bride made up of fishermen and farmers and mailmen and blah blah blah all of these things to bring it up because he's going to take nothing he's going to take the base he's going to take the rejected he's going to take the despise and he's going to overturn satan's eden with him because he's the only one that can get the glory and they're going to get a people who's not going to depend on science it's not going to depend on achievement god going to depend on the government praise god but they're going to depend on the word of god there's a quote out of the message and ensign from 1953. i'm going to read this quote because i find it very fascinating i said if i prayed for a thousand people and all of them died in the morning tomorrow night i could preach divine healing and pray for the sick just as easy as i can tonight because it's god's word and it can't fail that's a big statement it's god's word god has given it to us don't bypass it embrace it claim the promise say it's mine oh lord so brother bam says a thousand people before this he said if i pray preached salvation to a thousand people and they accepted their salvation by faith and they died and they come back from the dead and they told me brother branham quit preaching that amen because it's wrong there's nothing there he said i would still preach it because i believe it it's the word those are big statements then the next thing he says is if i prayed for a thousand people and all of them died in the morning tomorrow night i could preach divine healing and pray for the sick just as easy as i can tonight because it's god's word and it can't fail now this is this is where my mind goes my mind always goes funny places but as soon as i read that my mind goes what would the papers be like in the morning what would be on social media what would the news say what would the parking lot of that auditorium look like how many cameras and news stations would be there how many protesters would be at the end of the road let's bring it home to the reality you know because if if he prayed for a thousand people brother ben and prayed for a thousand people and in the morning they all died i guarantee the press would have something to say about it and the government may have an investigation that they open and the people that the social pressure would be intense but he said i could come back the next night and preach divine healing just as easy because the word of god and the word of god can't fail so brother branham knew where he stood if that happened to him he would come right back preaching the word of god the same way he preaches the night before now that wasn't the next place my mind went so who wants prayer card number one it's fine for brother branham to say that and to say amen but if you were there that next night would you be there early to get a prayer card would you hope and pray that you're the first person in the prayer line it's not just brother branham's faith that's at the test it's the faith of the people it's not just brother bran's faith that's on the line now it's yours hey brother brahm did his part he brought us a message he delivered the word he delivered it true and straight but now it's our turn to take it and believe what he said it's our turn to take it and stand upon it no matter what anybody says no matter what anybody thinks no matter what's happening all around us is to stand on it i say god help me help me help me help me to die to reasoning to die to unbelief that i would want to be in the prayer line the next day make me the kind of believer that if he was going to get back and preach it that i would be the first one in line that day that i would have been the first one at the church to come in and get my prayer card and march up there because he believes in divine healing i want to believe in divine healing he believed in the power of god to deliver i want to believe in the power of god to deliver you realize you've got to have faith under those conditions to get in the prayer line now you're not just depending on that man because what that man can do can fail now it's not the man anymore now it's your faith and it's the word of god the first thousand might went through trusting in the man because he's done it thousands of times he's prayed for the sick thousands of times we've heard thousands of testimonies that first thousand through that night might have been basing their faith on those testimonies might have been basing their faith on that man and his righteousness and his calling and his gift from god and his visitation of an angel they might have been able to go through the line with that kind of faith but the second night all of that's going to be different now the next time they come through the line they're going to have to come through the line believing the same word that he's standing preaching because it looked like everything he said and did had just failed praise be to god you think god won't test his children with things like that he certainly certainly certainly will god doesn't need to make things nice and pretty and comfortable and easy he can make them uncomfortable and he can make them difficult i'll ask another question if brother branham was preaching in this pulpit this morning where would the people be now i'm not talking about defying any laws because i don't think brother branham would right he never did when he went with a restricted visa he didn't preach when he had to take a yellow fever shot to travel he said that's what caesar requires he would do he would keep the law i'm not talking about the law put the law aside say there's no restrictions none whatsoever everything's open but we got the same kind of issues going on in the world if brother branham was preaching where would the sick people be i say this for a reason i don't like hypotheticals because it's not hypothetical brother brandon's not here god doesn't want him here it's a different day something different supposed to take place today so i'm not saying that we should repeat what brother branham did i not at all i'm just saying this for us to get us to think a little differently i want to think just a little bit differently where is our faith when brother branham was having healing lines you were standing in line patiently waiting for your turn to be prayed you could be standing behind a man with tuberculosis and the woman behind you could have a sick baby with a mysterious disease you don't know about but the people stood in line waiting to get prayed for because they believed that that man had a gift and that god was answering his prayer and that i could be healed when brother branham was preaching please don't misunderstand me because i don't think i have no desire to go against the requirements of the government none whatsoever and i don't think brother branham would and i'm not condemning anybody for anything i just want us to think when brother branham was in an auditorium there was every disease imaginable laying on cots out in front of him and out in the seats and there was no guarantee that you wouldn't get sick there there was no guarantee but there was something that god was doing that was compelling the people to come anyways now we don't have to go to an auditorium we don't have to have a prophet we don't have to have a prayer line that same presence is with his word now the same presence that was with that man on the platform is the same present that's with his word and if his word is in you the same presence is with you in your home when you go to work when you have to go out in public wherever you go that same presence is with you that same presence with that man and that man would get the asian flu and he'd get a headache and he'd have a stomach condition that would tear him up every seven years it didn't create perfect health for him it didn't create perfect health for his family do you understand it's not about perfect health it's not about no trials it's not about ever having to face sickness it's not about if that presence is there nothing bad will ever happen lots of bad things happen to brother branham he had a gun blow up in his face and almost take his eye out he talks about being sick all the time do you ever read the message but he still believed god he believed god to take care of him he believed god to deliver him he believed god to heal him he believed god to watch over him he believed god to move him he believed god and i want to believe god i want to believe god the same way that wherever i am in whatever situation i'm in amen not to be rebellious brother branham wasn't rebellious but i just want to have faith to believe god that he's going to take care of me that he'll deliver me that whatever happens to me he'll bring me through i just want to have faith in him not faith in science i'm not holding out for uh a a vaccination to fix everything christ has already fixed everything for the believer he's our portion he's our hiding place he's our deliverer don't let the situations change our faith in the word of god that doesn't mean that we're foolish it doesn't mean that we're that we're uh uh reckless or or hazardous in any way it just means we believe doesn't keep us from washing my hands i wash my hands because my hands get dirty i've washed them for years we wash them because that's what we do we use hand sanitizer because it works you know what i mean because we live in this life like we drive a car like we use a cell phone but you know we we we do things because of the life we live in if we're sick we don't go make other people sick we don't go around hugging everybody just to prove that they're not going to get it and then the next day they're all sick we're not here to prove anything we're just here to believe god just to believe him to take care of us wherever we are wherever we go and that his spirit will lead us lord if there's some place that's dangerous for the girl he'll check me in my spirit and i won't go to be led by the spirit of god by faith and if god says don't go there i won't go there regardless of what anybody thinks because god's in control that i'm led by faith not by fear amen not by science not by anything else but i'm ready by faith in the word of god and i know that i can hear the still small voice and when he says don't go there i'm not going to go there and when he says you're free then i'm free but i i don't i don't want to live my life afraid of something i don't want to live my life afraid of rejection afraid of persecution afraid of sickness afraid of injury i don't want to live my life afraid because i have a heavenly father who watches over me my steps are ordered he has ordained the way that i take he watches over me he he is he has he's already ordained me to accomplish certain things in this life and until his purpose is complete in me i'm not leaving this life we just want to believe the word of god so i used that hypothetical brother branham was here knowing that god doesn't want him to be here he doesn't want our faith in that that's not the day and age that we live in but i use that to get our thinking to be a little different because brother branham said you know he's in church in jeffersonville if you've been to the tabernacle it's not a big place and he says bring your sick and bring your afflicted call your friends bring them all in we're going to have prayer for the sick tomorrow night brother branham didn't tell the sick people to stay home you understand what i'm saying i'm not saying be rebellious i'm not saying fight against the governor's decree i don't believe we should i'm not saying that please don't make me say something i'm not but brother branham invited all the sick to come to be prayed for i don't want to have to protect myself i want him to be my protector i want to be led by a spirit i want to be sensitive i want to be thoughtful i want to be caring i want to care about people around me and i want to be sensitive and caring to those people i want to project divine love i don't want to take my faith and force somebody else into a comfortable position because of my faith i don't want to do that i have no desire to do that i don't want to push somebody beyond their faith because of my faith but i do want to live by faith i want to live more by faith than i've ever lived by faith and i don't want my faith to become an arrogant bold in your face insensitive unfeeling uncaring type of thing not at all and i don't want my faith to become a rebellious thing where i even fight against god's commandment to obey the authorities that are over us i don't want to do that either but i do want to live by faith i do want to believe the word of god i don't think we have to give up anything we can believe the word of god and still be sensitive and caring towards others around us be thoughtful and mindful of of their anxiety or their fear their worry or even their health i think we can be mindful and thoughtful and caring for those things but not out of fear no fear out of faith i want to believe the word of god but i want to act the way jesus did he wasn't arrogant he wasn't boastful he wasn't uh he wasn't insensitive or uncaring or unfeeling he was just led by the spirit of god he did what his father taught him to do and that's what i want to be and that's what i want to do i wouldn't want i wouldn't want if i heard if i heard brother branham was going to be over in such-and-such a city i wouldn't want all of a sudden my faith to go to the roof i don't think that's the day we live in i don't think that if we find out brother ben is having a healing campaign over here now don't think i wouldn't want to go watch hear him preach love and admire the gift and the man that's not what i'm saying i don't want all the sudden for me to go from no faith to having faith because he's in this city preaching i don't think that's what he's called his bride to in this day i think he wants us to have the faith of the son of god i think he's calling the bride to have a perfect faith in perfect submission to his perfect leadership and perfect faith in a perfect word he's not calling his bride to be insensitive and uncaring and mean but he is calling her to believe to believe to believe the word to believe in god and let god be her portion and her deliverer let's look at matthew 14. now you can see why when i want to preach this i don't want to push it too hard i want to go slow because you can push this too hard and you can wind up on the opposite side of where god is you can push something so hard that you're actually fighting against god i believe what kyle preached the other day was timely and correct that god gives you all the armor and gives you faith in that armor and tells you to sit still sit still and wait and do no harm i believe that but i believe sometimes sitting and waiting requires as much faith as moving in action i think sometimes to do nothing requires just as much faith to be in a bunch of action and doing a bunch of stuff i think sometimes it might require just as much faith to subject ourselves the ordinances and rules because god wants us to as it would to blow past all of them and just be bold and arrogant sometimes sitting still requires just as much faith as moving forward and i want to be sensitive enough to catch where he's at what's he going to what's he telling me not what do i want to do but what does he want me to do and i want to do it by faith you know we we're in complete compliance with what's been required for us as an exempt business because that's what we feel like the lord wants us to do and i'm happy to do that because that's what the lord wants and and i don't want to begrudge that or be angry about it or say horrible things about it because if that's what god wants that's what i want i want god to have his way but we're not doing this to protect ourselves because the word is our protection we're not doing it because we're afraid because he says don't be afraid but we're doing it out of obedience because he's asked us to be obedient so i want to have the right mental attitude about why we do what we do we do it because he's asked us to we do it because we're subject to the ordinances of the authorities that are over us and he hasn't told us to do different so this is an act of obedience but the act of obedience should never breed fear because the obedience to the rules is it it's obedience to god and shows our love for god but the word is our shield the word is our protector the word is our defender the word is our deliver it's always the word and part of the word is to obey the ordinances of the king and the governors that's still part of the word so it's our faith in the word is our obedience so more anything i just want to operate by faith not my own thinking i want him to cast down reasoning in every high thought in my own wisdom and my own desire and i just want to obey god but i sure want to believe him matthew 14. look at verse 22. and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him and to the other side while he sent the multitudes away we've been over this scripture so many times but i just can't get away from it and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway jesus spoken to them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus and when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore this thou doubt and when they were coming to the ship the wind ceased and they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of a truth thou art the son of god and when they were gone over they came into the land of gnaserad i want to read out a quote here out of jehovah jireh part 3 from 1964 today people are something on the order like they was in the days when the disciples was out on the ocean and one night a storm came up and there was nothing all hopes was gone that they would ever be saved and they seen him coming walking on the water now the ship was waterlogged and the sails was broken the oars was gone they were holding one another screaming and they looked out there and seen him coming walking on the water and was scared of him their only hope and they were afraid of the only thing that could save them if that ain't a true picture today again they thought it looked spooky you know they said they cried out for fear it was a spirit it looked like too like spiritual that's the same thing it is today but if you'll just do like they did when they cried out they heard that voice coming fear not it is i be not afraid be of good courage and if you'll just watch the word of promise for this day you'll hear that same voice speaking through the word it's me i promise to do this in this last day fear not don't be scared put your trust in me the son of god who he is believe it now hey we've been in a storm tossed about but this word of god has come amen in this revelation of this hour is christ come walking on the water it's him and it looked scary to many of them they didn't understand it at first it looked a bit spooky it looked a little bit too spiritual amen but as they were fearful he said it is i be of good cheer it is i be not afraid and so many times we get into a situation god knew they were going to get in that situation he sent them in the boat he sent them out and he went up under the mountain and brother branham said he went up to the mountain to pray and was watching over them they were never out of his eyesight they were never out of his foreknowledge they were never beyond his reach but he let them get in that situation why because he wanted to come in the midst of the storm walking on the water and he wanted to be their deliverer when there could be no other deliverer you realize these were fishermen who lived their life on the sea and there was no hope for them to deliver themselves their only hope for deliverance was this one who came in an unorthodox way he came in a way that that had never he did something that had never been done before you realize jesus christ and his ministry love to break religion apart he loved to break traditions apart he would often do things in a way that had never been done before and they couldn't accept it because they'd never seen it before and now their deliverance come walking on the water in a super unexpected way oh friends let him work in the unusual let him do what's never been done before let him do something in a way that that's totally different than what we've ever seen him deliver before and when he comes walking on the water don't be afraid amen let him speak to your heart be of good cheer it is i be not afraid [Music] don't be afraid of his deliverance just because it's weird just because it's different just because the circumstances are unusual amen if you would have not accepted the unusual you could have not accepted jesus ministry and if you don't accept the unusual you cannot accept brother branham's ministry because it was unusual it was different he was breaking the traditions of the day brother brother the lord jesus christ was breaking the traditions of the day but peter when he heard those words be of good cheer it is i be not afraid peter there's something in peter that is marvelous peter said lord if it's you bidding me come if it's you bid me come and jesus says come see peter when he saw the deliverance he was afraid like everybody else was afraid but when he heard the voice of the lord peter wanted to be wherever the lord was you can find that all the way through peter wanted to be with the lord and peter had such a desire to be with the lord he would chance getting out of the boat he would take a chance and he said lord if that you bid me come and he said come and peter climbed down out of the boat and began to walk upon the water what what was the motivation i don't know the bible doesn't say but he wanted to come to the lord i just take it as his motivation he wanted to come to the lord and how many want to come to the lord in the midst of the trial want to get to the lord amen it may be a scary way to get to him might be a frightening walk it might be a walk we've never walked before but but we asked him can i come peter didn't just climb out of the boat he had permission to come remember this power is under control and it's by permission every time brother branham manifest the manifestation of the spoken word it was by permission so he said can i come he says come he climbed down the boat and he began to walk upon the water to go towards the lord he was doing what nobody besides the lord himself had ever done before and as he's walking upon the water all of a sudden he begins to look at the circumstances around him and when he looks at the circumstances he begins to begin afraid when he becomes afraid he begins to sink and when he sinks he cries out to the lord lord save me and the lord reaches down and pulls him up and rebukes him for not believing pulls him up and he says oh thou little faith wherefore didst thou doubt i'll tell you why he doubted because he was standing in the middle of a storm standing on water that nobody had stood on before watching the storm and the waves blow and and the waves crush over him that's why he doubted what would you do if you were there right he doubted because of the human nature but what was in him that made him want to get to the lord what was in him that made him walk on the water it was faith amen and the enemy to faith was doubt when he began to look at the circumstances and begin to see but he cried to the lord and the lord rescued him and brought him to the shed now there was other disciples in the ship and none of them asked to come out you say well they wanted to take the safe road that ship wasn't safe that wasn't the safe place to be where is the safe place to be in the trial wherever the lord is peter had more sense than the rest of them but when peter got out trying to exercise his faith and trying to get to the lord he failed as a man and he sunk in the water and god had to rescue him and rebuke him amen and when he went back to that boat and maybe he went back to that boat seemingly a failure but i want to say this i would rather be peter than everybody else that stayed in the boat i would rather i would rather take a chance to get to the lord than try to stay in a boat that's not going to survive anyways and without the presence of the lord that boat's not going to make it that boat was flawed it was failing amen they had no more hope in it brother branham says amen and they stayed with the sinking vessel rather than ask the lord if i can come to him peter was of a different nature he was willing to leave the the known to step into the unknown he was willing to leave his comfort because his comfort as a fisherman had been his boat all his life since the time he was a child he had been in a boat and he wanted to get out of that boat and get to wherever the lord was god is breaking every traditional idea we've ever had [Music] he's breaking church gatherings in most places in the world he's breaking up our he's breaking apart so many things he's bringing forward every traditional idea we had and the question is do we want to stay in the thing that's failing or do we want to take a chance and maybe fail and maybe have the lord come and rescue us are we willing to take a chance to get out of the familiar because it's not going to work it's not going to work what worked all their lives as fishermen wasn't working anymore friends there's coming a time very soon what's worked for all of our lives won't work anymore it's not going to work there's going to come a time that we've got to be willing to get out of the boat when he says he says it's me this is me and you say can i come can i come and wait for him to say yes see this is a walk of obedience what if jesus had said no peter better stay in the boats i want to have enough faith to stay in the boat or get out whatever the lord says do i want to get to a place where i have such leadership of the holy ghost and such faith in the lord that when i see something no matter how odd it is no matter how unusual no matter it's the first time i've ever seen this before amen but if if it's him and i ask to come and he says come i want to come if i ask to come and he says stay i want to stay i want to have that much faith to do what he tells me to do i want to be obedient more than anything else in my life i've come to the place more than anything i want to be obedient i don't want to look good i don't want to look smart i i don't care if the whole world thinks this or thinks that things are ignorant and unlearned it doesn't matter i just want to be obedient i just want to be wherever he is wherever he is in the storm that's where i want to be and if he's moving on the water i want to say can i come to you if he says no i want to stay but if he says yes i want to climb down out of the boat and risk looking like a fool in front of everybody else risk failure risk drowning but i'd rather be on that water than in that boat god's moving us it's moving us he's we're losing faith in things that we used to have faith in we're losing confidence in things that we used to put confidence in and we may not have realized how much confidence we put in some of these things but god's going to let him fail and maybe especially for his bride they may fail first to get us out of the boat jesus i want to go look at matthew 9. i want to look at a couple scriptures back to back if you'll just take this walk through the gospels with me i want to look at something and then we'll start winding down matthew 9 and 27 and when jesus departed thence two blind men followed him crying and saying thou son of david have mercy on us and he was coming to the house the blind men came to him and jesus saith and believeth believe ye that i am able to do this and they said unto him yay lord then touch to their eyes saying according to your faith be it unto you and their eyes were open and jesus straightly charged him saying see thou see that no man know it so we have two blind men saying lord save us he ask them what they want to see and he touches their eyes and their eyes come open let's go to mark chapter 10. mark 10 and 46 it says and they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of timaeus sat by the high by the highway side begging when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on us and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more oh great cried the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they called the blind man saying unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee and he casted away his garment rose and came to jesus and jesus answered and said unto him what will thou that i should do unto thee the blind man said unto him lord that i might receive my sight and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith have made thee whole and immediately he received the sight followed jesus in the way let's go to john chapter 9. this will all make sense in just a minute john chapter 9 verse 1 and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind jesus answered neither hath this man sin nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world when he had thus spaken he spat on the ground and made a clay of spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay and said unto him go wash in the pool siloam which is by interpretation sent he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing all right this is interesting why do we read all this well because we have three healings of blind men the first time he touched their eyes and they could see so the second time when blind bartimaeus starts calling out and he calls for blind bartimaeus to come what do you think the disciples are waiting for they're waiting for jesus to touch his eyes because he touched his eyes before so obviously to heal a blind man you touch their eyes but jesus didn't touch his eyes he said go and be go seeing and he could see his eyes came open well then they get to the third one there's a man born blind and he sees him they asked him the question who sinned he said no one but the works of god might be made manifest and he goes to him and now the disciples have an argument what's he going to do this time flip a coin he's either going to touch or not touch i think touch because of this certain i think not touch because in this circumstance and this is like that circumstance and under these conditions he touched and remember he used his right hand and because he was standing with his right foot and now he's got his left foot forward and that time he just spoke the word can you see yourself [Music] we always try to figure god out we always try to mentally understand what god's going to do we always try to get ahead of the program and figure it out and i don't think the disciples were any different than us they probably questioned among themselves why did he touch one and not touch the other like why if you could just speak why would you even touch like if he could speak to blind barnabas why would you touch him but if he touched him to hit him how did he know he could speak and not touch i it's confusing but then when he comes to the third man it's going to get more confusing still because one's healed by touching his eyes one's healed by speaking the word but now he's gonna spit in the clay and he's gonna make a mud out of that spit and he's gonna take it he's gonna rub it in the man's eyes well now they have no clue this isn't left foot forward right foot forward this isn't he does this in june and he does this in august no this is a complete different set of circumstances now they're just as bewildered as ever why why if you can speak why spit if you can touch why something like this amen god knows why i don't know why god knows why but there's one thing for sure is jesus christ would never start a new tradition and he wouldn't get painted into a box he wouldn't get backed into a corner but god can show himself mighty any way he wants and he's requiring us to believe him if he does it one way one day a different way than next he's not going to do it the same way twice oh i love that in him it keeps us on our toes we're not going to figure him out we're not going to figure out what's going to happen next we're not going to get into this situation i've seen this situation before and under these circumstances it ain't going to happen like that friends god you'll get right to the point of having it figured out and god will do a sharp right turn just to throw you off so you quit relying on reasoning and come back to faith in god god can do what he wants to do the way he wants to do it when he wants to do it and we're required to believe him he can he can heal one one way and he can heal you a different way somebody can have an instant touch and you can fight it out for a week but who's going to complain he healed the man with the spit and the clay in his eyes wasn't complaining and saying why i'm so dirty why didn't you do like you did blind bartimaeus hey this guy wasn't complaining he had been delivered and it was the program of god and it was the desire of god and his obedience to that program of god delivered him and he could see we've got to get away from thinking our own thoughts amen and just rely upon him is he a healer absolutely how will he do it i have no idea he can use a doctor he can use a chiropractor he can use music is that what brother branham said is this the time for music or the chiropractor i don't know but i'm going to follow his leadership and let him be god and if he heals me one way one day and he heals me someplace totally different the next time will praise be to god he's the healer and he can do it any way he wants to do it we've got to cast down reasoning in every high thought that exalted himself against the knowledge of god and we got to be a fool so that we can become wise it's a good time to say i don't know what's going to happen next but i don't know but i know who's got it figured out and whenever i see him move i want to be wherever he is if i see him moving over here i'm going to try to get over there and say lord can i come if he says no i said okay if he says yes i want to go why would he call a bride in in this evil age to prove she's not like eve why you realize the messages that we are bombarded with is different than it's been in any generation the amount of unbelief that we face every day is unprecedented it has never been this way satan's eden has come to perfection and everywhere you turn your head is his message not the lord's everywhere you turn your head is his images his signals his words there's been this is unprecedented it's never been like this amen and you're bombarded constantly with news and information and and the information is contrary to one another the experts don't agree but they're still experts praise god i don't know where they got their expert certificate this one got one from one place that's different in this place because these experts don't agree but yet they're experts and we're supposed to believe the experts no we're supposed to believe the word of god i mean i'm not angry at the experts thank god for them i mean let them do whatever they can but i'm not putting my confidence cnn nbc fox it's all the same not putting my confidence no drudge is better no it's the same it's all products of unbelief and reporting on unbelief through unbelievers it's all it's a flood of unbelief but i want to say god just take me to your word just flood my heart with your word flood my mind with your word let me stay in the tapes constantly let me stay in the message books in my bible and in prayer and in fellowship constantly lord because th these these signals are all wrong they're everyone wrong this is right let every man's word be a lie and let god's word be the truth amen i mean it's amazing you talk to somebody about a disease and one person has one fact that one person has another fact and you're safe within six feet no you're not safe within 10 feet 10 feet or 6 feet i don't know sheltered in the arms of jesus because the experts are not sure i don't know when they'll be sure i don't know when they'll have it figured out but it doesn't matter i'll do what god asked me to do i'll submit to the authority that is overplaced over me but i'm going to believe god for my protection because if they say six foot and ends up ten foot what are we gonna do lose faith do you see what i'm saying if the safe distance is six foot but they find out all experts agree tomorrow it's ten foot well what about us being six foot apart you realize god's our protector he's got to be our protector we have no other hope it's got to be god it's got to be him there's no other hope friends this is the only one we've got he's got to be our protector he's got to be our deliverer he's got to be our healer amen there's nothing else that we can trust i trust in him you talk to people you talk to somebody and they got a whole different set of facts than what you got well i heard this and this well i heard this and this i don't know what to but i heard the true report that by his stripes i'm healed i've heard the true report that he is my father and he's watching over me i've heard the true report and i choose to believe that broadcast the gospel the good news and i want to believe it every day of my life and not not be nervous and not be afraid i'll be compliant i'll be kind and then i'll be loving and i'll project love to others but i'm not going to be afraid because if i'm all of a sudden needing to protect myself then why does god protect me he's got to be my shield he's got to be my buckler he's got to be my strong tower i don't have any other hope oh so much i want to say but god is good friends i want to read one more scripture and i got so much but maybe we'll get to it on wednesday some of these other things but let's go to john 21. john 21 and verse 5. my thoughts are a little scattered because i'm just sharing from my heart trying my best to just let god lead and not push my own ideas or own personality but just let god lead if i can put your faith in anything i want to put it in the word of god amen if i could put you in any safe place it would be in the word of god if i could give you any protection it would be the word of god i have nothing else i have nothing else that i can guarantee that'll keep you safe and keep you protected and keep you out of harm the only thing i have is the word of god and when it looked like the word of god when it looks like the word of god fails all we can do is go right back to the word of god because we have nothing else it was like brother ben if i prayed for a thousand people i'd come back tomorrow why he has nothing else to give the people but the word and if you stand on the word and it looks like the word failed what do you do you come right back to the word because we got nothing else there is nothing else there is no other hope the only hope we have is the word of god nothing else is going to change our bodies it's going to be faith in that word we've got to believe him and let him lead john 21 verse 5 then jesus saith unto them children have you any meat they answered him no you know where they're at they're in a boat they're fishing jesus is resurrected they don't know what else to do peter says i go fishing and several of them said we'll go with you they're out in the boat a little ways from land and and jesus calls out them children have you any meat they said no and he said unto them cast a net on the right side of the ship and you shall find wow he's going to do something unusual again he's going to do something weird kind of like something he's done before and they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes therefore that disciple whom jesus loved which is john saith unto peter it is the lord now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he gird his fisherman's coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea oh i like peter i like peter friends when he saw jesus come walking on the water in the midst of the storm he said can i come to where you are she said come and he got out of the boat to come but now the circumstances are different and things are a little different there's no storm but they're empty they're not having any success jesus says cast it on the right side and they did and john the type of the bride caught it it's the lord but peter always wants to be where the lord is he was in a perfectly good boat and that boat had oars and a sail and all the equipment needed to get to the lord in fact everybody else rode the boats without peter's help to get to the lord but peter just couldn't help himself he gird himself about and he jumped in and he swam to the lord he couldn't wait to get to where the lord was and i'm not i i'm not ashamed that that was peter i'm not ashamed there was a nature god had to train some things out of peter he had to teach peter to be obedient he had to bring peter to humility but there was something god loved in peter he swam up and the lord fixed food for them and he began to redirect peter peter just wanted to be where the lord was but he says if you love me feed my sheep if you love me feed my sheep if you love me feed my sheep and god was training peter peter you love me you jump out of a perfectly good boat just to get to me you'll climb out of a boat in the middle of the storm to come to where i am peter you love me if you love me feed my sheep if you want to get to me if you want to be near me do what i told you to do he had to redirect peter i want to be able to be redirected i want to be where he is hey if the lord's here i'm out of the boat if the lord's not in the boat i want to be wherever the lord is i want to get out of the tradition i want to get out of the uh of whatever my own idea i want to get out i want to jump out of it as fast as i can and swim to wherever the lord is but if the lord sits me down and says no i want you over here i want to go over there he says you're loving me do this i said i'll do that lord whatever i want to be wherever you are but if you send me here i'm going to go there because that's what you want peter learned how to be obedient but peter had a love for the lord that would get him out of the boat that would get him out of the normal that would get him out of the usual that would get him out of the comfort zone and would get him to where other people weren't willing to go and i want to be that way i want could he look foolish yes i mean he's standing there how far ahead of the boat he was i don't know maybe he beat him by 10 minutes and he's sopping wet but it was worth the 10 minutes to peter somebody might have said you fool if you'd have just stayed 15 more minutes in the boat we would have got here you wouldn't have had to nearly drown you wouldn't have had you fooled why did you climb out in a storm and go walking where you nearly drowned it wasn't for the lord you'd be dead right now you fool peter was no fool it was worth it to him to be wherever the lord was i'm proud of peter amen not ashamed to peter i don't want to be more worried about my reputation it's going to take looking like a fool to be wherever the lord is then call me a fool i want to be where the lord is you nearly drowned peter look at you you walk in the water you nearly drowned and the lord had to bail you out peter probably wasn't mean but he could have said thomas have you ever walked on water by being a fool i've gone places i've never been before i've experienced supernatural things in the lord i've never experienced before staying in the tradition i've never felt like it was to be supported by faith peter wasn't supported by water peter was supported by faith he lost the support of the familiar old ship the old church walk the old churchianity and he got out there and he walked on something that wasn't supposed to work but his faith held him up thomas john and james and they stayed in the old church system peter was the one who looked like the fool but peter had been a place they'd never been and peter had an experience they've never had i said make me a fool i just want to be where he is if i got to swim walk on water if i try and fail and he's got to rescue me hey he'll rescue me but i want to get to him i want to be wherever he is wherever he's working where he's moving if it's unusual i want to be there if it's odd i want to be there if it's scary i still want to be there but i want to be where he is wasn't safer in the boat no matter what anybody thought it wasn't safer in the boat wherever the lord is they just said peter peter peter peter peter he was coming to the boat right when he picked you up after you made a fool of yourself and after you drowned he picked you up and he come to the boat and you remember what happened when he got on the boat everything stopped everything was fine why didn't you just wait for him to get in the boat oh praise god praise god cast down reasoning in every high thought hey you had no guarantee without peter he was coming in that boat maybe he was coming for peter i don't know i don't know why the circumstances were the way they were but i want to be able to get out of this boat and go wherever he is if he bids me come and if i see him over there i want to get rid of the familiar and i want to swim to wherever he is and if it doesn't look orthodox and they're not pretty strokes amen and it's not a good job swimming i don't care as long as i get to where he's at and he's revealing himself in this word and he keeps popping up in strange places in the scriptures and he keeps popping up in strange places in the message and he shows the seventh seal over here and the son of man ministry over here and it pops up and i just want to jump out of the boat and swim to that because this boat is too slow for me i want to be wherever he is fear not it is i be of good cheer don't be afraid to get out of the boat will you look like a fool it's a good chance will the people in the boat understand you probably not well maybe you need rescued maybe you'll get out in unfamiliar territory and start to get nervous and start to get afraid and start to sink possibly but he'll save you he'll rescue you just keep pressing towards the mark of the high calling in christ jesus just become a fool that you might be wise let's cast down reasoning science education civilization it's of the devil brother bam says it over and over and over i'm not ashamed to say it and i'm not ashamed to use my phone or drive my car but all those things will fade away but the one thing that's going to change my body is faith the faith of the son of god the one thing that's going to move me into the kingdom of faith is my faith in the word of god and that's the thing that i want to have faith in his word above civilization above science above education i want faith in his word and i want everything else to be subjected to faith in his word and i want that to be supreme so friends in the days of pandemics and the days of uncertainty and financial crisis and the days of contagious diseases i've only got one thing for you that's the word of god i've only got one recommendation that's the word of god i've only got one guarantee that i'll never fail and that's the word of god and if i if i die and the lord takes me let him take me screaming this to this congregation stay with the word don't trust science don't trust wisdom don't trust governments stay with the word because the word won't fail if it looks like it failed come right back to the word again because the word can't fail right amen pray for a thousand people in the morning they're dead get prayer card number one [Laughter] i wonder which prayer card peter would have yes [Applause] amen if everything goes haywire everything goes wrong and the intellect and and the reasoning all goes crazy ask god to give us enough faith to have prayer card number one next night i want god's word to be supreme in my life god bless your saints let's stand together man musicians if you'd come please and blake if you'd come i'll tell you what i love you all i've just come to the place where i give up trying i quit trying to be a good preacher i quit trying to have a nice subject i quit trying to go a different direction i quit trying to have something new all i know to do is say believe the word follow him and everything will be all right how will it work i don't know would it be bad maybe could it be scary probably will it work absolutely there's nothing else that we can point each other to but to work to the word to what the message the prophet brought us it will work the same faith in the same word it will produce the same results and if you have to try it two times or three times or four times he never said how many times we'd have to try he didn't say how long we'd have to stick with it but he said it would work and it will work friends god bless you let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word lord god it means more to us than life god when this life is gone this word will continue on god when this natural fades away when we no longer need science or a car or an airplane or a cell phone or a computer when it's no longer necessary lord your word will continue marching forward your word will still be the foundation that we stand on and it'll still be our life it'll still be our portion god forgive us lord for all of our confusion and all of our wondering in our mind help us lord to cast all of that down help us to become fools lord that we might be wise lord you choose the base things choose us lord you choose the things that are not choose us lord and that you may bring by your power by your authority by your own work by your spirit that you may bring to not all the things that are god you've called

but what we need is his leadership we've got to we've got to be led by the spirit of god according to the word of god and that's got to be where we put our whole faith there's got to be a bit of abandonment in this day to abandon our own thinking and when god anoints us and inspire us amen and shows us in the word we've got to be willing to take that word if it didn't work for somebody else that doesn't mean it won't work for you if it didn't work for you last time that doesn't mean it won't work for you this time we've got to be able to take him at his word god bless you god bless you whatever happens next stay with the word [Music] if we never see each other's face again stay with the word we used to say things like that and say [Music] it's possible it's becoming more possible all the time stay with the word all the way and if you stay with the word by the leadership of the spirit of god and i stay with the word we're going to wind up in the same spot someday whether on this side or that side or we're going to wind up in the same spot but you stay with the word cast down reasoning forget the news take the word and it will work we're going to sing some more songs and
