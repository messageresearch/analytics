the good things that you have for us in this day for Lord this is the day of abundance this is the day of overflowing this is the day where you've opened the word and everything is available Lord help

lives bless us as we look into your word Lord God take preeminence among us we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen man God bless you while we're standing let's if we could take our Bibles and go to Ephesians chapter 4 and we're going to continue on with the subject we've been on the last two services with members of the body I believe this is part three and I subtitled this a a healthy body members of the body a healthy body and we just want to say uh God God bless you to brother Emanuel and his family God bless you brother Emanuel it's good to have you back with us amen you're always missed but we know that the Lord used you there and so we're happy to have you back also want to let you know that this Wednesday brother Minn Fen will be here preaching so we caught him in town and uh we talked to him and he agreed to come and do it so we're looking forward to having him here this Wednesday and also one other exciting announcement at the end of service today we'll have a baptism amen our sister Jade Lynn desires to be bap apz in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and she's got quite a testimony and I'm I'm so thankful that God's brought her our way she's been fellowshipping with us now for several weeks and uh so we'll be happy to baptize her at the end of service amen God is good God is good God is hunting out his Sheep amen and he's bringing them to himself and so we're just so excited to be able to witness that amen I'm going to say welcome to all the visitors I see several faces God bless you it's always good to have you here with us and we want you to feel very welcome just relax pull on the word receive from God Amen let's look at Ephesians chap 4: 1 together I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you were called with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace amen so we see the attitude by which Paul is instructing us how we should walk in the calling wherewith we were called and we've been called to be part of the body of Jesus Christ and in this last day it's a tremendous calling to be the manifested bride but he wants us to walk with all lonliness that's all humility and meekness and longsuffering that's patience forbearing are caring caring one another are yeah supporting one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace this is how that we should be working amen this should be our attitude our approach it should be our effort and then we we we've been going into chapter 4 as we know that uh Christ ascended on high and gave gifts unto men and we went into the fivefold ministry as the five office gifts and we went into what was the purpose of those gifts and it was you know for the uh uh to BU build to equip the Saints to build up the body till we all come in the unity of the faith to the stature of a perfect man that's why this was given and then we go all the way down to verse 16 which I want to read together which to me becomes the culmination of the whole thing in verse 16 from whom that's from Christ the head from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in in love amen God bless you as you have your seats amen I've been enjoying this uh Ephesians chapter 4 so much because I'm beginning to realize more and more what the gifts are for what the fful ministry was for what the purpose God gave it it all comes down to his body and that's the great manifestation in the end time is the fulfilling of the promise of his body Amen in Bride form amen and she's supposed be standing here in the Splendor of him in the end time amen so it's going to be a complete building up of this body and a display of that body in full measure in the end time and that's where we're at amen it's going to take a fivefold Ministry to bring us there and it's also going to take every gift in the body and every joint supplying and every member working together for one purpose amen it's not just a fful Ministry and it's not just a few gifts it's everything working together for one goal that God had one one thing he wanted to achieve one purpose that he had in the back of his mind that's been unfolding through three folds the first he accomplished in Jesus Christ amen the second he's doing now getting preeminence in a people amen which will be the bride amen which is also his body amen and it's going to take every member every person every attribute everyone working together for the same purpose for the same goal which is for the body so that this body for working together in the measure of every part that doesn't exclude any every part making increase of the body what body the body of Jesus Christ on Earth making increase of the body unto the edifying building up of itself in love so now we find that we're all responsible for the same thing every one of us has a shared responsibility to do the same thing that we are all as members of this body as a joint that supplies we are all here for the same thing to build up the body of Christ to the edifying of itself in love praise God so we all have the same responsibility regardless of our gift regardless of our position whether we hold an office or don't hold an office we have a diversity of gifts we have a diverse distribution of gifts we have a diverse Ministry of those gifts we have a diverse working of those gifts we understand all of that and it's all different and and it and it's there's no cookie cutter right there's quite a diversity but it's all there for one purpose and that's this purpose to build itself together in love for the building of of the body so we all have a shared responsibility regardless if we're man or woman regardless if we're aged regardless if we're new in the into the message where're where we have experience or little experience whether we're a young person a teenager a young adult a young family or a senior citizen we all have the same goal the same purpose and are being used for the same thing so it doesn't matter our status our position it does none of that matters we all have the same responsibility praise God brother B says in the message choosing of a bride says the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride so one is pregnated and will bring forth an antichrist amen that's the false church but the true church is pregnated on the by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride so what's the finished body of Jesus Christ the bride the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and a woman is one and Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again like like Adam was at the beginning man his wife are one and this is the age that we lived in for this unification The Head and the body coming together amen and the body coming into full display brother bam said several of these things we're going into right here at the beginning our review from the last two services and then we'll go forward but in this uh uh quote from the voice of the sign says when God has called a person for a job to do there is no one can take its place there is no one can take your place your peculiarity I I love that because we have peculiarities amen I mean it it doesn't take long for us to recognize that we are peculiar from one another we have uniqueness and we have differences and those differences we can allow to become a problem if we allow them to become a problem or we can see them as a benefit if we allow them to become a benefit it kind of depends on our attitude towards the peculiarities amen and brother bam goes on to say I can can never take or Robert's place he can never take mine nobody can take your place and he and he and then he says you're each one set in God's economy just for its place one fast all the time and communes with God while another one cast out Devils because this one is fasting but it's the whole body of Christ working together the unity amen sometimes what I find and many of us what we struggle with is is not that we don't believe in our brothers or sisters but most of the time we're not believing in ourselves most of us are struggling with self-doubt and we we have self- questions and and many times because we can't easily label ourselves I have this gift and I have this office you know when when uh when I I we talked before about the uh nine spiritual gifts that are in the church out of First Corinthians 12 we talk about the gift of tongues it's easy to be identified as having the gift of tongues because it's self-evident you speak in tongues you have the gift of tongues also for interpretation of tongues it becomes self-evident but many of the other gifts aren't self-evident amen how do you know you have the gift of wisdom I mean the person who says I have the gifts of wisdom listen to me he probably is not the one that we we're actually going to listen to amen some things are not so self-evident amen it begins to declare itself amen but it's not like amen the church votes you in as wisdom so so so many times we have questions about where we fit into the body and what our gift is and where our position is amen and and then that begins the devil can use that to bring self-doubt why I don't have a position I don't have an office I don't have a gift because I can't show up to church with my label on my shirt that I am I have wisdom or I have knowledge or I have discernment of spirits or I'm placed in the body for helps or I'm here for governments right and so we're always wondering what are we and what are we doing but but the scripture is so clear that you've been placed in the body by God Amen that God has positioned you and God has also equipped you and the prophet comes along to confirm the scriptures so well to say that God has been looking after you generationally to get a certain Ting out of your life and then God by a spirit has placed in you something that he wants to use to minister to the rest so now it's not about I I think we need to get away from trying to figure out what I am what's my gift what's my role amen and just seek God and say God use me any way you want to use me and I just want to be engaged I want to be plugged in I want to be part of the body so that you can use me for whatever and I may never I may never get to the end of my life and say I had XYZ gift or I was this in the body but you're still going to be it and you're still going to have it regardless if you can identify or not identify and usually it's the people around you that can identify it amen but the point is we're not seeking labels we're not seeking positions we just want to be a joint that suppli us we just want to be a a a member where every member amen is building up is is strengthening is giving something amen and God didn't Place us God didn't place you in the body to be a parasite just to suck life and give nothing no go God placed you in there to be a joint amen that Supply amen where there's a symbiotic relationship where there's a coexistence where I'm giving and receiving amen I'm supplying and I'm being supplied too amen by being in the body and that's what God wants amen so God has placed Us in there with our peculiarities amen and we I think what we need to do more than anything is learn to relax and learn to trust God right because at some point our self-doubt becomes doubting God that's right right and we think it's okay just to doubt ourselves and we think it's okay amen somehow that it's humble just to keep doubting ourselves amen and keep questioning ourselves amen but at some point you're doubting the very wisdom of God to place you in a body in an assembly you're you're doubting the very work of God to make you the way you are amen and and to place you where he's placed you and to equip you the way he's equipped you amen and we begin it and sometimes I think we're doubting God Amen not just doubting ourselves and I wonder how many times we stay in this self-doubt and we hinder ourselves from just engaging in supplying and giving because we're so concerned about what am I what what should I do and we we reserve Reserve Reserve Reserve until we're actually not doing anything for anybody because we won't just trust God put me here for a purpose and I'm part of it and I'm going to be part of it I'm going to be fully committed and fully part of it and God can do whatever he wants yeah amen so when it comes also to gifts brother Brenham said God can drop a gift on one person one time in their life and it never operates again a gift of Prophecy they can have a a word of knowledge they can have uh tongues or interpretations and never again so it's not all it's not like you've been endowed with that gift forever amen so being plugged in and being a channel God can drop something on you one time amen and do something for the body amen and it's a great help it doesn't mean he ever will do it again or it could be a way in which he'll operate with you many times amen let's not worry about it let's just stay engaged amen so that God can use us once he can use us many times he can use us in a different way at different time yeah and not worry about it but just say I'm here to build the body of Christ I'm here here to supply for the body and I and to do that I can't do that separated from the body right let's go to Romans chapter 12 together it's amazing how sometimes we get into some of the simplest subjects like members of the body and yet it's so profound and sometimes the simplest things the things that's slowing us down or hindering us are holding us up yes you remember you know no matter how advanced you get in algebra you're always going to need your ABCs so all of a sudden the ABCs become profound yeah when because when the ABCs get applied to a higher form of language or to a higher form of math it's the same basic structure of the alphabet it's the same word Blends when you're talking about Advanced language amen but all of the sudden this simplistic uh uh alphabet keeps going deeper and deeper and deeper amen but you can't go deeper without keeping the simple alphabet so all of a sudden the simple things are absolutely profound amen and the profound things can be absolutely so simple so it all works together Romans 12 and3 says for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think this is such good advice but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man The Measure of Faith you're only here because God gave you a Measure of Faith to believe you only believe the message because something was in you to believe with something predestinated before the foundation world not because you're a genius not because you're great or you're super spiritual amen you believe because he dealt to every man The Measure of Faith so let's not get puffed up in vain in our imaginations as if we're something special amen we're not special God is special amen and what he's done is special so let's not think more highly of ourselves than we ought to think but to think soberly according as God to dealt every man The Measure of Faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith what is he saying here let us do it according to the grace that is given to us this means you're not inventing anything you're not making up anything you're not trying to have you're just operating in the grace that he's already given given you if you prophesy the prophecy according to the proportion of Faith what faith the faith he's already given you this isn't a striving for something this is letting what he's put in you come out in the measure he's put it in you or Ministry now remember Ministry is not just Pulpit Ministry amen prophesy in the New Testament many times just means to preach many times you see Prophet or prophesy means to preach Ministry means to serve or minister to so if Ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimilation abore that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affectionate one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one another it always comes back to love when we talk about the body and the building of the body and the operation of gifts and the offices and ministering to the body it all comes back to love praise God so we find then that we operate according to the grace that's given us according to the prop proportion of faith that we have it's not something that we're trying to achieve to is something that God has placed in us that he can work through us let's go to First Peter chapter 4 1 Peter chapter 4 1 Peter chapter 4 verse 7 but the end of all things is at hand be therefore sober and watch un prayer and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins this comes back to love again have love uh have fervent that means Earnest an Earnest desire have fervent love among yourselves for love shall cover the multitude of sins use Hospitality to one another without grudging that means don't just do kind things but secretly you're really angry about it I always have to do that and I that's wrong amen if you feel that way just don't do it amen I'd rather you not do something nice for me if you turn around and say I always have to do that and just please don't do it amen let's be genuine in the way we minister to one another and let's just do what what genuinely comes from the heart not out of obligation but out of a genuine desire to serve amen verse 10 as every man hath received the gift even so Minister the same one to another what you have received not what you got not what you tried to have but what you've received Minister that to one another you're ministering what you have not trying to have something to minister you're ministering from what you have amen amen amen this verse 10 again as every manath received the gift even so Minister the same one to another as good sto stewards of the manifold grace of God if any man speak let him speak as the Oracles of God if any man Minister this is serve let him do it as of the ability which God giveth that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praise and Dominion forever and ever amen so how should we serve how should we Minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth amen amen so we should relax yeah if God wants to use me he'll give me the grace he'll give me the faith he'll give me the ability he'll give me what I have need of to give to others and all I'm doing is giving what I have amen I'm giving whether it's finances whether it's time amen whatever God's put in me the measure of Grace the gift that he's given to me is what I minister to others I'm not trying to say well this is what the body needs I'll go become this and when I become this I'll give that to the B that's not how this works God puts in you a gift he puts in you The Measure of Faith he puts in you Grace amen he puts in you the manifold Gifts of of of Grace and now he asked you to minister the to the body according to the ability that is in you I I this is beautiful we should relax whatever God wants me to do he'll put in me to do and then it'll be a natural outflow from what he put in me amen so that we're never putting on we're never being obligated We're Never Getting constrained into something that doesn't fit and we're not comfortable with and it doesn't work right for us but yet God's equipping and God's giving Grace and God's giving faith and God's giving ability and God's giving gifts and out of those things we give to others if you think about even just the fful Ministry and the diversity of Brethren that God has called to preach the gospel and how different they are and and all of us all of us preachers are the same way we always look at somebody preach and say oh I wish I could preach like that that is so effective it is so good they look at look at how they're able to take this and this and go right to somebody's heart and look everybody's weeping and he touch their hearts and I'm like I wish I could do that somebody else is looking at somebody saying how can they get that out of that scripture and tie it back to how did they do that I wish I could do that is that right I hope I'm not the only one who can do that I watch somebody Minister said that's so good but we can only Minister according to the ability that he's given us under the grace that he's given the gift he's put in us that's the only way that we can Minister we can never try to copy it won't work we can never try to conform and say that's effective I'll do that it won't work friends you can come to a dynamic service a powerful service and it was so effective and the people were so moved and you say I'll just preach the way he preached because it worked it won't work for you because you can only Minister out of the ability that God's put in you out of the grace you have and The Measure of Faith that's already in you so we need to relax and just be exactly what we are and not try to be anything else listen we don't need four of the exact same preachers right and if we do God will just disperse them around the world cuz you don't need them all in the same place we should just relax and be what God's called us to be amen so uh I want to come and read a quote out here of the message from adoption brother brandom he he starts talking down the lines we're talking and he's going to make a switch and I want to make the switch with him so halfway through you'll see where he turns in 1960 adoption part one he says how that God has set some in the church through the labor pains oh they get tremendous sometimes when a church is groaning under the persecution in the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost how they groan and cry under labor pains but when they are born and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists then he's given to their speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing all kinds of Miracles see where the church is now now this is my purpose of doing this the church is always trying to take someone else's corner but don't do that you can never raise corn in ephraim's corner if you're Manasseh you've got to take your place in Christ positionally take it oh it gets deep and Rich when we get in here how that God puts one in the church to speak with tongues another now we have we have been taught many times we all have to speak with tongues that's wrong we all got to do it no we don't they all didn't do one thing yeah each one was see the land was divided and divvied up by inspiration and I could take the scriptures and show it to you exactly that he put them in the place where they were supposed to be positionally how that the two half tribes had to stay across the river how that their mothers cried that in their birth and how that each place was supposed to be and now after you're in that don't mean that you're out free from war you still have to fight for every inch of ground you stand on sea Canaan did not represent the great Heaven because it's war and troubles and killings and fightings and so forth but it did represent this that it must be a perfect walk so now he comes down to the placing of the children of Israel Amen in the promised land under Joshua's Ministry and as they were placed there they were placed in tribal order they were set there in positionally placed by their birth am because when they were birthed amen the the mothers would grown under the labor paines and they would call out the tribal name Ephraim or Manasseh and all of that and then as the lot lots were cast and the land was divided under Joshua they would all go to their inheritance and the position that they held in the promised land determined what their purpose was for the whole nation Zebulon by the Sea he was to fish amen he was a fisherman and he was Coastal and lived a Coastal Life and all of those things but Ephraim was in the Bread Basket amen and they they would produce uh the wheat they were the wheat Center amen so so we begin to find that brother B talks about this one would grow corn one would Plant Fish the one with corn would Supply the coastal tribe the coastal tribe would Supply the Inland tribe amen and they were all doing for one another and So based off their birth coming into the promised land amen would position them their position would determine what they did amen and they just did and they were supposed to stay in their Lane amen amen right just do this don't try to be everything else somebody else will take care of this you just do this amen and then everything else will be taken care of sometimes we try to be everything amen I want to do this this and I see that that's good I want to do that oh I like that that brother I'm going to do that and all we're going to do is just hinder the thing that God's actually built us to to do we just need to stay in our lane and do what God called us to do and if we do it and we do it from the abundance that he's given to us and we do it with joy we do it with freedom amen and all of a sudden everybody else will take care of everything else that's undone amen right if we just stay in our lane he said the church is constantly getting in someone else's corner he says it this way they're trying to take the ball out of the guy's hand is running with it instead of blocking for him somebody needs to be a ball Runner somebody needs to be a blocker amen so it's it's something that everybody every joint must Supply and everything work together and he and he talked about this moving into the promised land and he types it to the spiritual church so we've got to stay our positions for the benefit of the whole body amen the problem is sometimes you know they don't give a Heisman Trophy to the blocker that's sometimes the problem that's sometimes the problem we run into they don't give the Heisman Trophy to the to the pooling guard to the tackle yeah yeah that's right is that true maybe maybe he gets some accolades once in a while they get into a Hall of Fame but generally it's the ones scoring the points making the pass throwing the ball running the ball their name gets mention they is mentioned game after game after game right but sometimes you don't even know who's on the [Music] line they get substituted in and out and you never even knew there was a change made right that's where the problem is yeah that's why sometimes a tackle wants to run the the ball and he's not built for it right he wants to catch the pass he wants to kick the field goal it's not his position right and it messes everything up yeah sometimes it's what happen because we see things and pride enters into man and we want to be where the name is mentioned and where the Highlight Reel film shows and and we're all susceptible to the same thing every one of is weak this area cuz that Old Pride was injected in the fall of Man and sometimes we have a hard time working in the shadows for the body of Christ that's sometimes where the devil trips us up we end up taking a position that's not ours or getting upset for not having a position that God never intended us to have rest assured God gifts find their place nobody's going to stop it God's gifts find their place if we don't believe that then we've got a problem because God's gifts will find their place and so we just need to rest and just do what comes natural and let God position let God move let God be blessed and let the body be increased edified in self and love that's the real purpose for the day we live in the purpose that for the day we live in is not to have a position the purpose is for this body to come into manifestation and if all I could I want to do everything I can to Foster that and I don't want to do anything to hinder that I would say we come to a place where God forgive me if I've done anything to hinder the building of the body together in itself in Love by not doing my part or or or criticizing somebody for doing their part if I've done anything to hinder this last day move God forgive me because we're all responsible for this same goal brother Benham then comes and this is where he takes a little turn he talks about the position and positional placement then he comes here uh continue on in the same quote and there's where the church is failing today on that walk he said it must be a perfect walk in your position in your land do you know that even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed your misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of You Believers can cause this church to bitterly fail and at the day of judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it you say now wait a minute brother brandham well that's the truth think of it Joshua after he crossed over into the land God gave him the promise just think to fight an entire campaign without losing a man without even getting a scratch without having to have a nurse or first aid or Band-Aid God said the land's yours go fight think of fighting a companion there's no Red Cross around at all there's nobody going to get hurt and they slayed the amorites and the Hittites but there wasn't one hurt among any of them until sin came in the camp and when achen took the Babylonian garment and the gold wedge and hid it under his Camp the next day they lost 16 men Joshua said stop stop wait a minute there's something wrong something's wrong here we're going to call a 7day fast God made us a promise there will be nothing hurt uh nothing hurt us our enemies will fall at our feet and there's something wrong here something went wrong somewhere cuz we got 16 dead men laying here there's Israelite brothers and they're dead why did they die innocent men because one man stepped out of the line you see the reason this needs to be taught the church lining up lining up with the word of God lining up with God and lining up with each other walking perfectly upright soberly before all men fearing God because one man stole a garment and done something that he should not done took the life of 16 men I think it was 16 maybe more I believe it was 16 men that was dead Joshua called and said there's something wrong God made the promise and something's wrong and when we bring the sick up before us and they fail to be healed we need to call a solemn fast call an assembly something's wrong somewhere God made the promise God's got to stick to that promise and he will do it so all of a sudden we realize that because I'm part of the body my personal Behavior has an effect on the body I can no longer once I become part of the body and been baptized by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ I can no longer separate myself out and think what I do in private doesn't affect the body that's not true amen because we are spiritually linked to one another and what we do affects one another and now if we have a responsibility to build the body of Christ in each member in every joint that supplies then we have a responsibility to keep it built to keep it clean to keep it pure we each one have a personal responsibility this is why our own spiritual condition is so important our own spiritual health becomes vital to the spiritual health of the body amen so what each one of us does becomes important because we each have a personal responsibility to work in the program of God but you know what the enemy knows what the program of God is yes so what's he constantly trying to do he's trying to stop the program of God right and if the program of God is to manifest a body Jesus Christ body on Earth which is the bride amen if that's the program of God in this age then what's the devil trying to do he's trying to stop that manifestation of that body yeah amen and so each one of us how now have to be guarded because what we do and how we live becomes important am not just for me but for everybody else one thing that's so critical about recognizing that we're part of a body integrated with one another is now it causes me to think differently I can no longer live selfish this is what happens when a sing single man takes a wife and then has children he can no longer think as an individual unit anymore because now everything he does will affect his wife and then everything he does will affect his wife and his children this man no longer has the right just to please himself anymore that's why the Bible says when a man has a wife he seeketh to please the wife the wife to please the husband amen because that's the way it works we've lost our right when we come into a marriage Union amen just to seek our own pleasure but we're Now We're Here amen living for two amen and then the children come along and now we're not living for ourselves we're living for our family amen now when a wife amen she becomes a mother now every decision she makes she's weighing the children in the balance of every decision it just comes natural amen everything she everything she thinks about fixing everything she thinks about buying every place she thinks about going amen dad will say hey let's go on a date we haven't been out in forever I want to go and automatically mom's going well this one has the sniffles and I don't know and I don't want to leave them with a sitter they might need me and this other one they were scared last time we went and I think we'll just not go it's not that mom doesn't want to go it's Mom is sacrificing herself for the benefit of the body Hallelujah that's a real mother somebody who's struggling to be a real mother will say yeah get somebody here to watch them I don't care but that comes right into the body of Christ amen we cannot live selfish lives for ourselves and only doing what pleases ourselves CU what we do will affect the body we're connected to we have a responsibility amen praise God and the greatest battle ever fought he says and I thought then if that great Heavenly Host we read this last week that great Heavenly Host has has to keep its place to make everything in order he's talking about the the the stars and the constellations and the Sun and the Moon what about the disorder of the Earthly host how when one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually strive to keep the order of the spirit I would to God this morning that we would bring this to a real healing service that we could keep this part this group that we have gathered under the roof this morning in such a Harmony that the Holy Spirit would place every member of the body that that's here this morning in such Harmony till there would be such a spontaneous healing of soul and body if we'll just hold our position I love this quote amen this quote has come to mean something to me amen because it's become so simple but so complicated it's so simple that if we could just get in Harmony and unity and each one of us hold our position not take somebody else's position and not abandon our position but just be in our position and be in harmony with one another until there could bring such a spontaneous healing of soul and body so now one member getting out of harmony with the word amen can cause us not to have healing is that what he typed with aen right one member out of harmony with the word out of harmony with the B body can hinder amen the promise of the word from taking effect amen now he's showing the opposite if we could each get in position and come into harmony there' being a spontaneous is healing of soul and body this is so much more this is so much bigger than we think this is not about getting dressed up putting on a suit and going to church twice a week it's more than that friends this is the this is the manifestation of our day this is the word taking on flesh and we all have a part to play in it and if we all play our part and give our full self to it it'll benefit everybody and we'll see the promises of God take effect again and again and again and again because this is the word we're not sitting here waiting for the word to be fulfilled like often the future someday something's going to happen we're all just sitting here waiting for the change of the body Amen brother brah said we're waiting on God he said God's waiting on you he says those Saints amen those sleeping Saints they're waiting for this church to come to Perfection to come into the stature of a perfect man amen Maybe what's holding up the resurrection is me amen me being fully engaged Plugged In selling out completely to the word of God and staying involved and staying plugged in amen we have way too much Flo floating around jumping from church to church not being committed not being tied in not be fully engaged we have too much getting our feelings hurt and not coming to church for three or four weeks it's nonsense we're not recognizing our position and our day we're not recognizing the message and our part in the message when we do foolish little childish acts like that getting our feelings hurt and pulling back criticizing Brothers going around saying things we shouldn't be saying we're doing more damage than we realize amen we've got to be careful because if we if we believe we are who we say we are what we say counts what we do matters how we act has everything to do with what's transpiring in this day it's important friends we all have got to take stock with who we are and where we're at each one of us we've got to be sincere we've got to be serious we got to take a little time to have be self-reflecting amen it's not about me anymore it can't just be about me anymore it's got to be about everybody else aen wanted something for himself and look at what happened if we take a selfish attitude what are we going to do I don't want to be guilty myself of hindering the work of God say God help me I think one of the most wicked things that we can do in this day is stop the forward progression of the manifestation of the hour not committing adultery not going out and drinking not selling drugs I think the most wicked thing that we can do today is stopping the forward progression of the manifestation of the word for our day that's right amen amen am amen God said in the message 10 virgins and the 144,000 juice this is a good time to read this quote you find out why said if you got a resenting audience the Holy Spirit won't reveal you got to have something that's working together they were in one place in one Accord and then there came a sound from Heaven rushing no matter how much I'd pray brother R's talking himself no matter how much I'd pray and lay day and night studying and praying before the Lord walked down there maybe the anointing on me walk up here and feel that resentment it Grieves him right away he won't reveal nothing but when you walk down here under the anointing and feel your audience under the anointing that's when the Holy Spirit begins to work then and he begins to move and do great things for us there's such a power that comes in unity this is why brother Benham recommended us come early to church come and pray get in the same Spirit don't come in last minute don't don't be busy and just rush in here and and be flustered but he recommended to us to come 30 minutes early come in early sit quietly get the right atmosphere and create the right atmosphere I mean so many times we decide what time we want to get to church based off what we want I mean it's just the truth I I don't want to get there early I I'm busy I want to do this and I want to do that we come to church based off what we want and we stay after and pray as long as we want but the question is what if it's not about me what if my coming early and creating an atmosphere is about the person next to me somebody else what if it's about creating the atmosphere where the word the gift that's in that brother can rest and relax and you have free flowing we're way too selfish as a people but Jesus Christ was our example and he gave he surrendered he yielded he didn't come for himself he came for others he didn't live for himself he lived for others and so many times we we we want preaching a certain style cuz that's what we like we want singing a certain way cuz that's what we like we want a certain amount of time we want a certain this we want a certain that and it ends up all being about what I want me I I think I feel I want we should have I instead of just saying God I want whatever you want and I want to be here to plug in and pull amen I want to pull so it'll come right amen I want to get connected not so I can sit here and say well this is wrong and that's not coming right and this not coming right then get plugged in and pull it right amen if you think it's going wrong pull it the right way amen throw your shoulder to the wheel pull from God and say God I need fed I need an answer and for me I need something directed to my heart amen pull it right out of the ministry pull it right out of the song service yeah I mean it's easy to sit and criticize and say this should be that way and this should be that way but it takes a whole lot more effort to engage ourselves and say I'm here to make a difference I'm here Amen to pull it correct if I think it's wrong pull it right praise God Amen so I sometimes I get disgusted at myself how selfish I am with my family with others in the church how many times I'm find myself preferring myself and that's something I think we just need to be aware of and guard ourselves against let's look at First Peter chapter 5 and we're going to begin at verse eight 1 Peter 5:8 it says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the Devil is a roaring Lyon walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world this verse eight is stunning telling is be sober be vigilant because your adversary the Devil is a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour that means the devil is always looking for an opportunity I don't think he goes on vacation I don't think he gets days off the devil is always looking for an opportunity so we must be sober we must be vigilant because if we get laxed we could create an opportunity what's the lion when he's hunting what is he looking for he's looking for weakness the Lion's looking for the sick gazelle he's looking for the weak gazelle the old gazelle the young gazelle or the one that Strays too far away he's not going after the Lion's not going after the strong he's not going after the the the the multitude the numbers that are clean close together he's looking for the outlier he's looking for the one that's Too Young Too feeble too old sick weak he's looking for an advantage to take opportunity of advantage and the devil is going about as a ling roaring lion using the same tactics he's looking for an opportunity amen and the and I do not want to give him that [Applause] opportunity because he's constantly there he's our adversary he's constantly seeking whom he may devour and there's a there's a couple quotes that I want to go to and relating it from the spiritual the natural body to the spiritual body brother brandham all the way back in 1954 he begins to teach about sicknesses and cancer and he says in this message from 6 or 54 he says now let's think about cancer what is cancer then a cancer is another life how many knows that's true tumor cataract any of those things a germs or any other life now here comes in you somewhere another little life usually a cancer comes from a bruise and all the things of the natural type to spiritual so he's going to show us that the natural typees to spiritual and and many times a cancer comes into your body what's cancer looking for it's a life what's it looking for it's looking for something it can take advantage of it's looking for an open door it's looking for a weakness it's looking for an opportunity you think we we have if you have a healthy immune system you probably don't even realize how many things your immune system kicks out on a daily basis how many how many uh uh germs and viruses you come in contact with on a daily basis if we saw them floating around we'd probably be nervous how much coid is floating around and how much influenza is floating around and how many cancer Spirits you come in contact with in a day but that Spirit cannot find access to you and unless there's a weakness somewhere you know how it is many times you'll do good you You' went all winter you haven't got sick the whole family got flu and everybody else got this and they all got that and they got the cough and they got the sniffles and you didn't get anything but all of a sudden you got overworked over taxed put in some overtime didn't sleep two nights and next thing you know here comes a sore throat what was that what was that Spirit looking for it was looking for the weakness in your body to take advantage of the weakness CU with right nutrition good sleep a healthy immune system we kick out tons of stuff but when we when we when when our our nutrition's affected when our our overall wellbeing is affected there's a weakness that comes into the body and how many times you go from one sickness to the next you got one thing and went right to the next because the next thing took advantage of the weakness left over from the previous and the natural types to spiritual so in the body of Christ all these spirits that are hovering around what are they looking for they're looking for a weakness they're looking for an opportunity listen I don't ever want us to get comfortable with the fact to think we're safe and secure amen we're safe and secure in the word as long as we're staying under the word and living the word amen but what happens is there's many things that happen in life we get discouraged we get disappointed we get hurt we get weak we get tired we get stressed and we start to pull away from the body or pull out from under the word and all of a sudden that's when the enemy is going to come in and start laying something on us it's why it's important to be a healthy body so many of those spirits that are floating around are kept out just by every joint supplying just by everyone being in their post of Duty everyone doing their part and everyone contributing to the overall health of the body will keep so many spirits out he goes on in 1957 the message life is the Healer so notice the difference um water blood and spirit all the Natural Things type the spiritual then in the natural things on earth types the spiritual a cancer could be a scavenger like the Buzzard eats dead things cancer usually comes from a bruise the bruise first it's bruises and you're full of little cells and one of those little cells gets mashed it backslides if we just think about members of the body one little cell could get bruised or or backslide and that could be the entrance for a foreign life right he says when the first there is a life not the life that was there another life comes in where did it come from think of it it's not complicated where did that come from the Devil the devil cannot create nothing the devil only perverts he can't create he perverts and first he has to have a way ask the doctor if your body was perfect and like God made it in the beginning it would be impossible possible to get sick but the devil has to find a weakness somewhere to pervert so if the devil wants to harm the body of Christ he's got to find a weakness somewhere God forbid he would use my weakness but the devil has to find a weakness somewhere to pervert that's the same thing with your soul reason you don't believe in Divine Healing the devil has found a weak spot in you and he perverted it God is the Healer and we're offspring of God Sons and Daughters of God believing it like our father believed it notice this little cell it was a bruise and then a life comes in that little bruise the cell backslid he says and it backslid and the devil put a German there called cancer tumor whatever it may be and they begin to develop cells you realize that what we talk about now is one one cell backsliding one weak spot one weakness where another life can get in that life comes in the intent is never to destroy that cell the purpose is always to destroy the body it's coming in one cell but it doesn't want to stay in one cell the purpose was not the cell the purpose was to destroy the body and it'll begin to affect other cells and spread and move many times it's moving in secret underlying moving here and moving there though all of a sudden the symptoms all pop up and there's a major sickness amen you find out there's cancer leukemia or something what happened there was one Open Door there was one weakness and another Spirit came in and it never came in for that cell it always came in to destroy the body now do you see how important our spiritual life in Christ is as an individual he's never coming after you right we are so entrical all of us we're so entrical we think everything about us how I feel how I think and me and I felt this way and I felt that way and I wanted this and I wanted we're so entrical amen but really God doesn't doesn't see it that way he sees us as part of the body he sees as part of himself and everything's interconnected amen and we think that this just come to affect me it didn't come to affect you it came to destroy the body the devil's trying to find a way to stop the forward progress of the word for this age that's what he's always attempted to do that's what he did in Luther's day we trying to do in Wesley's day he was trying to stop the further progress of the word for that day and he's got to find an entry point Judas found a way into the church that spirit that was in Judas found a way into the church and it found it through Judas because Judas was had the heart of a thief yeah right is that what the Bible says he had the heart of a thief amen and that devil found entrance into where did he come in Jesus's church amen Jesus was the pastor and how did he come into the church he came into the church through Judas Judas was a thief in his heart and from there he worked the plan and what was the plan the plan was to destroy the manifestation of the word for that day he just didn't realize that he was working right in with the plan amen there's always Spirits floating around the church they were in brother brandom's day they were in Jesus's day they were in Paul's day they're in our day and we know Spirits never die right so whatever Spirit was there is here there's a Judah Spirit floating around looking for a Judas there's an Absalon Spirit floating around waiting for somebody who will play the part of Absalon there's joab Spirits looking for somebody to play the part of joab there's Deus Spirits there's there's all these Spirits floating around trying to find access how will it find access through a bruise a weakness an Open Door an open Channel and one cell yeah but it's never for one cell right it's always to destroy the body you think of it this way it's like at your home you know your home at night I mean we live in Lin so we don't always lock our doors a lot of times we forget but if you lived in a place that was dangerous had a lot of break-ins every night you would go around and make sure the windows are locked and the doors are locked because there's always thieves probing what are they looking for Access yeah right it's like the thief walks by every night while you're sleep and he tries this door locked tries this window it's locked and he makes his round and goes to the next house makes his round goes to the next house but the one day you forgot to flip the latch that's what he's been waiting for all this time you realize what a position we're in this is why we have to stay so surrendered to the word because the word is our security the word is our Shield the word is our wall the word is everything he can't get to us behind the word but the devil's always trying to get us out from around the word like he did Eve that's what I want to speak on now in the message Christ is revealed in his own word he says I was just talking to a young Minister and his wife in the room just a few moments ago and both of them are nervous just like the rest of the world rest of the human beings on Earth I said remember Satan's got a Punch coming at you don't care who you are he's got a right for that one punch which had you rather be that punch be blind or be arthritic sitting in a chair or be nervous see he's got somewhere he can punch you he's got a right to that open place now that's the spot you got to keep covered all the time this seems so I don't like this amen I want to know that there's no place he can access in me but brother REM showing us that we all have weaknesses we all have areas in our life where we've been tripped up before and listen I I'd say it this way if you've ever been tripped up in a certain way that's probably the way you've always been tripped up because that's probably a weakness that you have and so that's the spot we need to keep covered in pray prayer because we need to realize that weakness just like Paul's weakness was given to him for humility to keep him dependent upon God Amen there's things in our life that keeps us absolutely dependent upon god brother brandham had a nervous tension in his life and one time he says you know I got the feeling like pop used to say I've Got the Blues and you get the feeling down and he says I get the feeling like nobody loves me nobody cares for me he says now I know that's not true that's just me doing that that is what he said he says but I can't help it I feel that way and brother B had this nervous tension and he always wanted this nervous tension to go away and then he got to thinking one day hey it was this tension that drove me to Christ this tension is a good thing without tension what would I be I would just be a ragd dooll with no emotions nothing God's using this to keep me tied to him to keep me dependent on him and keep me close to him so there's many things in our life amen that's a weakness we have complexes and we have wrong Concepts and we have old hurts and we have things that become a weakness in our life brother B said you have to keep that covered in prayer and recognize you are not Invincible you have a weakness and you're not living for yourself that that weakness can be an open door to the enemy to trouble the whole church so now it creates a greater dependency on God than ever before because I need your help with this Lord I need you to strengthen me I need you to help me I don't want to fail in this again Lord I know that this is just my nerves amen help me to overcome help me to get Beyond this amen we need uh we need these things to keep us dependent on God because it's that independent nature that sets us up for Destruction when we think we've got it all under the wraps and everything's okay and I can't be defeated and I know what I'm supposed to be doing that's the moment you're most susceptible to be taken by by surprise amen but we need these things in our lives that cause us to say God I need you Lord cuz I'm I'm going to fall in that hole again if you don't help me and we need to keep those things covered in prayer and and brother brandham it comes to the message standing in the Gap and he says I let the sick lay I wanted the Lord to tell me where to go and what not to do that's wrong I had built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message I want to talk about complexes for a minute brother Brenham he he I love the message he was so open and so honest and so truthful it helped us so much Amen to understand even ourselves he says he we know when he comes to standing in the Gap he had already just preached the seals standing in the Gap is preached in June of 1963 in March of 63 he comes and preaches the seals and when he comes and and and preaches the seals for brother brandom that's an extremely momentous time amen because they've been pondering and wondering could this ministry be Malachi 4 could this be amen the Fulfillment of the word for our day could this be the Elijah Ministry and he thinks so and he's questioning and he's looking at it but as soon as he can go over to Revelations 10 1-7 and see the mighty Angel come down and reveal amen the unspoken word to lift the seals off of what was in the back part of God's mind he knew right then this is a revelation 10:1 7 and the and the messenger of Revelation 10:7 is Malachi 4 he could tie it together and now he knew what he had wondered about all his life he knew that's why when brother bam came to the seven seal he said oh friend you don't know what this means to me all my life I've wandered of all things I appreciate those other six why because this is his seal he's the messenger of the seven seal amen the seven seal is the opening of the word amen when he comes to that now he knows his identification he knows his place in the scripture he knows he's not guessing he knows such a marvelous time for this man amen and what happens immediately after that rejection they don't believe it and even if they even if they're not unbelieving they're not catching it they're not getting the gravity of it his even his friends are not recognizing what this means or what the significance is and brother brandom slips into depression and he says himself I built myself a complex I love the way he words that because we think sometimes that we just got a complex like we got the cold but brother B said I built myself a complex he shared the blame for it he wasn't willing to pass it off on somebody else I built my why did he build himself a complex because he was hurt he was rejected he goes on to say a little further down standing in the Gap he says Moses lost the feeling of his people because they wouldn't listen to him and brother Roy you see your dream brother Roy Roberson had a dream of brother brandom he was at the head of a table he was lifted up and carried out west and when he came back amen he been changed and he looked like the immortal Moses with a white hair and a beard at the head of the table and that was his dream he said brother Roy you see your dream and brother bram's typing it back to Moses Moses had to go to the Wilderness he lost the feeling for his people and he ran out into the Wilderness but God had to change his heart and bring him back to be the Redeemer and now he's tying that to brother Roy Robinson's dream which he's attaching the standing in the Gap he said now you can't go with a Ministry like that I can't go go with a Ministry like that until I feel different in my heart about it no matter if God did tell me but that is that change brother Roy that you've seen coming brother brandham had to go through a change like Moses went through a change what was happening and standing in the Gap was brother bham had come through this highlight of his ministry where all his questions now about himself are answered and then it's rejected whale or not understood or misunderstood and the rejection left him lonely and hurting and he starts devising a plan where he can get away and I'll say it in my own words and I hope I'm free to say this he wants to get away from the pain of rejection so he comes up with a plan where he can run up to Northern British Columbia he wants to be a guide and help out bud Southway he said want to be great said I'll let my beard grow out won't have to get a haircut just hunting fish he said it'll be great and then if God gives me a message this is where the religious part comes in because none of us want to move away from God without having religious reasons to do it this is where Hey listen I I don't think any of us are just going to wake up one morning and decide I'm just going to fail God fail the church and I'm going to just be an open door for spirits to come in no all the sudden the devil is so slick he begins to paint it in religious reasoning that's so deceptive friends and brother brandom starts thinking you know you called me to be a prophet and those prophets didn't fool around with the people they just went out to the Wilderness they stomped out with a message and went back and I'm going to be like an Old Testament prophet and all of these things he's thinking and he's mulling over as he's driving down the road and we know God comes and corrects him and stops him and says you know you you you weren't called to be just that you were called in the apostolic way you have more gifts than that amen and and he says if you go up there he said your wife won't stay up there she'll leave she won't stay up like that and you'll become a bum and all of the we know it so well I'm not going to rehearse it all but all of these things would happen and if if God said they would happen I believe they would have happened I don't know how to sort that out with predestination but God's not lying yeah gives him an identification of who he is shows him this name written in the mountain with the highs and the lows and the valleys and the Peaks and begins to understand all these things has to be this way and now he comes back and preaches standing in the Gap and standing in the Gap he's taken the correction he knows he's wrong he knows because of a complex he lost the feeling for the people and he knows that he was wrong and God corrected him and he's got to go back amen but he says but my heart has to change I can't go back this way I've I've lost the feeling for the people he said you see something something's got to change me because I in my heart if I go out there feeling the way I do now I still feel that they ought to have heard that message they ought to have done it and I don't have the feeling for the people that I should have who was brother Brandon primarily feeling for himself the Trap was laid by getting him to try to protect himself guard himself avoid the pain that was the Trap and as a human being I don't blame him one drop I can't condemn my brother CU who wants to go through the pain he went through but I he lost the feeling for the people his own hurt diminished the feeling for the rest of the body I don't have the feeling for the people that I should have until I get that feeling there's no need in me going CU I'd be a hypocrite and all these years I've tried to serve him with a true heart and I won't go out there being a hypocrite I got to feel that it isn't Ricky and Retta and it isn't this Bunch it's God's children that's in bondage and I must go to them you think about this man he got this complex and it's the question is where did this come from and brother Bren tells us in the message a guide from 62 he says I was thinking the other day no more than a few years ago standing down here on the street and because that my family had done wrong no one would talk to me I was lonesome for Fellowship nobody wanted anything to do with me they said he's his daddy is a boot Bootlegger and the Lord's saw no one would talk to me and I loved people brother Brenham was a little boy was wounded by rejection by a bad family name by his father being alcoholic and a bootlegger by their poverty by the condition of his clothes by all of those things he something said in his heart where he had scars he had wounds in his heart because he had a rejection complex I want to read to you the definition of a complex in a complex it the word complex is a complex word so it has multiple meanings but in the context that we're using it in this is the definition there's two parts Part One a group of repressed desires and memories that exerts a dominating influence Upon A personality so a group of repressed that means they're not really on the surface they're laying back there repress desires and memories that exerts a dominating influence Upon A personality so why was brother Brenham so hurt with rejection because he had been so rejected as a child then part two this is another there's another definition of complex an exaggerated reaction to or preoccupation with a subject or situation an exaggerated reaction to or a preoccupation with a subject or situation so if you think about that kind of complex you can have a complex about your appearance the size and shape of your nose the color of your complexion the color of your hair your weight your skills or abilities or lack of skill you can have a complex about all of those things and what it is is an exaggerated reaction to or a preoccupation with a subject or situation till you're so preoccupied with your appearance you're afraid to go out in public when there's nothing wrong with your appearance there's nothing actually wrong amen there's something about your features that you don't like and wish was different and this one's prettier you get something worked up in your mind there's actually no problem but you create a problem and it's an over it's an exaggerated reaction or preoccupation with a subject or situation so or a group of repress desires and memories that exerts a dominating influence upon the personality you know that first one sometimes is so subtle we don't recognize it we don't know sometimes why we react the way we react to things we haven't put our finger on it we can't pinpoint it amen and sometimes we may never be able to pinpoint it we may never be accurately able to diagnose it but the one thing that I want to watch for is I want to watch for the reaction to it because I think that's how we'll begin to recognize whether I'm being motivated right or motivated wrong CU sometimes we don't really know what motivates us sometimes it's so hard to discern ourselves there's things that's happened that shaped us from childhood and we're reacting to that and we don't even know we're reacting to that so it becomes that's why it's called complex comp it's complicated it's complex it it's multifaceted and sometimes is so hard to figure out amen and and sometimes you can drive yourself mad trying to figure it out and I I'm here to say don't try to figure it out just look for the direction everything's pushing you in and try to discern what's behind it based off where it's pushing you brother brandham his complex first of all he built the complex this current one but it was fed from an old complex yeah from childhood because brother benam goes on in the quote that I read he goes to say no one would talk to me I was lonesome because my dad was a bootlegger and I love fellowship and I long for fellowship and he says now I got so many friends I got to go out in the woods and hide amen because everybody loves me but now amen then that was in 1962 now he comes to standing in the Gap and saying everybody's rejected me and I'm hurt and I want to run away from everybody again so you can see the boy went from low to high back to low and it ties him right back to a former pain so here he is but what's the motivation he's actually being motivated to run away from his commission that an angel gave him right said you have a gift of healing to take to the peoples of the world right he has lost the feeling for his brethren for the people and he's willing to deceive his wife through a deception to get her trapped into going up there with him and he's got a religious reason because the prophets of old amen but the religious reason is just a covering for all the selfish reasons amen oh God help us to look at ourselves we have done this again I should say I have done this again and again and again and again I get hurt I don't like something I react somewhere I come up with a religious reason and really the underlying issue is me I'm trying to say me I'm trying I was hurt they said something about me I'm protecting me I'm trying to get away from pain I don't want to hurt anymore and so I create this whole world this whole scenario amen where brother brandham is actually overreacting to the situation amen because the whole world hasn't left him he comes right back in a few weeks and he's preaching his church loves him all the people still love him they still show up at meetings he has exaggerated the whole thing in his mind wow he may have heard a few comments and he may have had some people not understand and it's always that's always the way it goes amen I'll preach a sermon amen it doesn't matter how many people tell me they love it one person said I didn't understand a word you said brother Chad and I messed up for a week right it can be it can be one comment and then you can exaggerate that and make it everybody everybody I've been so rejected and they don't understand me and blah blah blah and whine whne whine and the reality is I'm just feeling sorry for myself and the truth is you come back to next service and preach and everybody likes and the people are still there and still saying amen it's you do you exaggerate it in your own mind you build a complex and and to build a complex you have to receive a lie at some point you have to receive a lie and so the the question is who's giving you the LIE amen and so I I I think of it this way the Devil's over here and he's got all these lies and they're bricks and he gives you a brick and you know nobody loves you and brother BM takes this brick and he slap some mortar on it nobody loves me Devil's over here they should have listened to you because of all the Vindication said they should have listened to me because of all the Vindication who built the complex he did who handed him the lies to build a complex at some point you have to receive lies yeah amen nobody loves me that is so far from the truth friends yeah right I don't know if anybody on this planet that nobody loves you see there are always extreme statements nobody will listen to me nobody cares nobody understands that's not even reasonable that's just the way we feel yeah so we've received a lie and the lies become truth and we place it in our wall of complex and we build ourselves a complex amen I say God free us from such nonsense let's go back to Genesis I want to look at this in the beginning Genesis chapter 3 oh my goodness I love the word of God you know I love I love when the word of God peels me away like a banana and I'm so exposed I don't even have any place to hide and I don't even have an excuse I can't even all I can do is hang my head and say God forgive me I can't even make an excuse for it anymore Genesis 3 verse one now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the when yeay hath God said You shall not eat of the every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons I'd like to propose to you that the fall came came because the serpent gave Eva complex yes in the very beginning the serpent gave her a complex and she took it because he began to say to her you know you're not really going to die but God does know that the day you eat thereof what's he doing he's saying God's keeping something from you you know there's something else to this Mystery of Life and God's keeping it from you and all of a sudden it says after he handed her the the complex and she took it she began to look at that tree again it was pleasant to the eyes good for food a tree desirable B to make one wise she was believing the Serpent's lie that God was keeping something from her you say why didn't she just go talk to Adam why did she go to the serpent before she went to Adam amen because that's what happens when you get a complex you think if God's keeping me from it Adam may keep me from it and now she wanted it this is what brother renom says says Eve did not want to do that but he showed her how it was more wisdom in it she didn't know she wanted to know she didn't understand but she wanted to understand and God told her not to try to understand in the seat of discrepancy he says now this is Harvest Time at the beginning when God swed his seed upon the Earth and gave it in the hearts of his children his family to keep the word that was their only defense keep that word here comes the enemy and broke that barrier by sewing the seed of discrepancy contrary to the word of God how did the serpent get Eve to move out from behind the word where he couldn't touch her amen he gave her a complex that God was withholding information from her you're not going to die that's not it but God does know amen and all of a sudden why didn't she wait and ask God because the prophet tells us that God would come in the cool of the evening and walk in fellowship with his children every evening why didn't she just wait and listen this is my personal belief you don't have to take it but I don't believe this was a oneoff conversation with the serpent I don't believe it just one time I believe this was a matter of discourse when he when he started telling her you know there's more you know there's something else you know God knows there's there's another Revelation beyond what you have you know there's more to this whole thing than what you see and I don't know how many conversations I don't know how long but this is just me personally I don't believe it was one conversation because remember now all of a sudden she wants it amen she wants that knowledge she wants that wisdom she wants what's ever being kept from her now she wants it and if now God is the one keeping it from her she will not go to God yeah if you become convinced that God is keeping something from you then you don't go to God Amen and if you can find if you can create a division between her husband and her now she doesn't even go to Adam she takes the ACT first and then goes to Adam because maybe Adam is on God's side you see how a complex brought the entire division by bringing a lie to her and she took the lie and believe the lie amen because now she all of a sudden was being held back she could have more and now she doesn't go to her husband she doesn't go to God Amen now she starts to look at the tree yeah right amen the fall in the beginning came by a complex and now all of a sudden we see over and over and over again the same pattern in us the devil gets us to believe something it's not at all true we tried to get her to believe wasn't true it wasn't that God was holding something back it God had a plan for her God had perfect plan for her and she was already a god upon the Earth yeah right but he twisted her mind and believing things uh about God and about the word and all of a sudden she left the word and how did she how could she know that she was receiving a complex because she was willing to go against the word amen because of what she now believed she was willing to go against the word what was brother brandham willing to do brother brandham didn't want want to go up to BC to be a sinner he didn't want to go up there to reject the word amen but he was walking away from a god-given commission he was leaving the people he had a gift of healing to the peoples of the world and that's what he said he said I let the sick people lay I got to get back out there I got to get back I got a gift of healing to give to them amen that was his original commission God had told him what to go do and now he's taking it upon himself to change the direction and go a different direction he's moving away from what God told him to do that's how you can concern that this is a complex say what about what about us brother Chad because anytime something will get you to leave the ABCs amen you know it's wrong amen something that will get you to leave Fellowship it's wrong because we're not to forsake the assembling together of ourselves amen even the more so as that day approaches that's a commandment and brother Brenham said amen that commandment drives us into church we should have a heart to get to church every time the doors open and if our heart's not there he said we need to get to praying but when all of a sudden our heart turns from there and we don't want to be in the fellowship that doesn't mean that God won't move You from One Church to the other God has the Liberty to move his sheep wherever that's not what we're talking about but when we start laying out a church and not connecting and becoming disconnected I if I would search that out I would say there's a complex there somewhere and somebody's believed a lie somebody has received and accepted a lie and they're disbelieving something I had a sister come to me one time and she was so troubled about something that was happening in the church many years ago and she says this happened this brother came from this church to this church and that influenced this and and you decided to do that and you did that because of what that brother did in other church and the whole thing was a complete fabrication complete 100% there wasn't a threat of Truth in it at all but she saw things and connected them and what happened was she she had a complex from a previous Church she was at she had an overbearing Pastor who took control and the whole church fell apart now she's afraid and so she's on the lookout anytime she saw something that she didn't understand then all of a sudden all of a sudden she worked up a whole scenario that was not true yeah amen what's he looking for an Open Door a bruised cell a weakness the minute that that we can get pulled off the word the minute that we can think it's all right to gossip there's a complex driving that somewhere the minute I can speak evil or critical of another brother without going to that brother and talking to them just talk to other brothers there's something driving me to that cuz that's not the word the that I can lay out a church and not go and be comfortable just bailing out and not going anywhere there's something wrong something's driving that you say what is driving that because the word says don't forsake the assembling together that's the word now there's something in me that doesn't want me to come to the word what's driving that is it an old pain from childhood is it because of something somebody said is it a rejection pain is it a hurt what is what is causing me to want to pull back from the body what is causing me Amen to want to speak evil to somebody what is going on Amen that I am going down this path I think we need to stop and say what is pushing me because this isn't the word that's not the word amen we may not be able to figure out what our complex is we may not be able to figure out what happened to us as a childhood but we can certainly figure out the moment we step off the very ABC's basics of the word go to church pay your tith love the Brethren speak nice things about one another no gossip no back back biting I mean those are the simplest when we move off of that we need to say wait a minute something's going on here something's pushing me out from around the word and you know what it's never just about me the devil's trying to destroy the body bring in through a brw cell another life and through that other life spread God say God please help us please Lord help us we've been wounded we've been rejected we've been mistreated is that true that's all true brother Brenham was wounded rejected mistreated and it left in him a susceptibility and if the prophet of the age was susceptible what do you think about you and I if he was acceptable to actually move out of God's program and hinder the forward progress of the word for his day yes sir what about you and I is there a susceptibility in us could God use old hurts and Old Wounds and old pain and misunderstandings could he bring a new hurt that matches an old hurt like he did with brother Brandon to cause us to do something against the word to cause us to do something that would hinder the forward progress of the manifestation of the word for this day be sober be vigilant for your adversary the devil Werth about as a roaring Lyon seeking whom he may devour and he doesn't want one member that's you know Satan didn't want Eve he wanted to destroy the whole plan praise God praise God this Bible is so perfect we are weak we are needy but God give us the Simplicity of his word to keep us right things in our minds become so complicated the way we feel the way we view things they become sometimes so complicated we misund understand situations we misjudge things we believe things that aren't true all because of complexes and all because of our own ideas and things can get so complicated in our own mind amen that we don't know what's going on Amen and the reality is we may never figure out what's going forget about what's going on just what's driving me to do what is it driving me to stay with the word is it driving me to stay with a fellow Fellowship is it driving me to stay in Harmony and unity or is it moving me elsewhere if it's moving me elsewhere I got a problem am simple is something moving me to become a disjointed joint is something moving me to stop being a member of the body that's here for the edification of itself in love is there something detaching me causing me not to coales and knit but to become unknit if there's something doing that there's something wrong motivating me somewhere brother bham he's got this quote I want to read this quote but before that I want to go to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 as I stand Here preaching this I tremble because I know that I'm the most susceptible of all if you think about it friends none of us are strong or powerful have our act together whether we're a preacher or a pastor or a deacon a teacher an elder someone's served the Lord 40 50 years none of it matters we're all susceptible and if God if the enemy wants to destroy the Devil do you think that I should be less Vigilant myself you think he doesn't want to check my windows and my doors in my life cuz why it's not even about me he wants to destroy the body if you can get into one of those five Ministry offices how much destruction can you do if you want to get into an elder brother or an elder sister who's highly respect how much damage can there that do you want to get into somebody with a gift on the platform how much damage can that do really I stand Here trembling because we have a devil a roaring Lon seeking we can destroy and he's just looking for an opportunity he's looking for an Open Door he's looking for a weakness and we all have them including me amen I get wounded with rejection just like anybody else gets wounded with rejection I get hurt when things are said and things are done just like anybody else gets hurt but my goodness if it begins to drive me to disfellowship and drives me to hate a brother and drives me I realize there's something going wrong because this is not the Holy Ghost God help us all amen that that we don't become the open door I say God help me that I'm not the access point for a devil please God and any one of us can be that's right when he comes to chapter 12 1 Corinthians chapter 12 he begins to talk about the gifts and the working of the body and the Natural Body typing the spiritual body we've been through all of this but he comes to the end in verse 31 of chapter 12 he says but cover earnestly the best gifts and that means uh cover earnestly the best gifts means to earnestly seek the most beneficial gifts that's what it means not the best gift as far as I got promoted to the best gift that's not the mentality at all that this one's higher than that it actually means the most beneficial gift seek to be the most benefit to the body that you can be that's what he's saying he says yet show I unto you a more excellent way next verse though I speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not love I become a sounding brass or tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not love I'm nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity love suffereth long now we're going to look at the attributes of love because every one of these gifts must be ministered in love because the body must be edified together in love seeking the bond of the spirit and the unity of love love everything should be done with love love suffereth long that means love is patient with the other members of the body yeah and is kind love envieth not doesn't get jealous when God uses somebody else and not themselves you have to realize friends any time somebody gets picked for something it means other people didn't get picked that's where this comes into play Love envieth Not says love vaunteth not itself it doesn't promote itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own it is not easily provoked and thinketh no evil love rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth love beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things love never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away all of these gifts must be administered by love no Envy no vaunting no puffed up doesn't seek its own like we said the first service when we preached this I don't know of any member in my body that exist to take care of itself but every member in my body exist to provide something for other members of the body why am I here I'm not here for myself I'm here for others we each one are here not to serve ourselves not to protect our El make ourselves happy or bring pleasure to ourselves we have been knit to the body to be a joint that supplieth to make sure we're here edifying the body in itself and love whatever moves me away from that is wrong whatever is preventing that in my life that expression is anti- word Jesus said to his disciples before he Departed he said this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you but as a tall order friends we're supposed to love each other the exact way Jesus loved us how did Jesus love us he gave up his reputation he gave up Heaven he gave up Glory he gave up honor he gave up Prestige he came to Earth to be mocked spit on ridiculed killed that's how he loved us amen and we're supposed to love each other that way yep said greater love hath no man than this that a man laay down his life for his friends question is can we love like Jesus that means can I give up my life for the body can I Surrender my happiness my prestige my honor my good name my self- protection can I be hurt for the body Jesus was can I stand there and get stepped on when it's crushing my heart for everybody else that's how Jesus loved us amen he didn't preserve or protect himself he gave himself God so loved the world he gave if we're to love the way God loved we give we're not here to take we are here to give the devil uses all of these things all of our makeup our nature our path he uses it against us and what is he trying to do he's not trying to destroy you and I friends I'm sure he loves to destroy any attribute of God but he's here to kill the program of God he here to destroy the body why are we here here to promote the body brother Bram said in the seventh seal said it's an old battle that started way back Beyond Time Satan and his angels was kicked out and then they come to earth and the battle set in again because Eve broke down the barrier from where she was isolated behind the word of God and from that very hour Satan won the battle over God's word because one of his subjects the weaker let down the bar and that's EX exactly how he's won the battle every time has been because one of his subjects let down the bar from the word how has Satan won the battle every time because a whole church because 10 subject because one of his subjects let's make this personal Satan will win the battle over God's word when I let down the bar on the word I be become personally responsible for the program of God in this generation can't put it off on other people's shoulders it rests squarely on my shoulders that one subject letting down the bar on one word brought brought defeat Satan had victory over the word of God and that's how he's had it every time when one of his subjects let down the bar on one word we should be on guard be vigilant be sober because he's as a roaring ly circling what's he waiting for a moment of weakness laxness why to destroy the move of God brother bham come in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed and before he preaches Christ as the mystery of God revealed you have to think brother brandham goes through preaching of the seals March 1963 then he has all this between that time he has the rejection and the hurt and he comes and standing in the Gap at the end of June June 23rd 1963 and then he's telling us what he's been dealing with and he's been hurt and how he's going to run away and all of these things how God corrected him and here he comes almost exactly one month later July 28th and now he's going to give the church some really good advice right before he breaks down the seven seal he says love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his Target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving sweet and kind to one another what is that that's the immune system of the body working pray for that man that he'll be saved too or that woman or whoever it is just pray for them and stick one with another stay with your pastor he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through and call because he's ordained of God to do so now do you remember that the enemy will come listen brother B's not saying it might you got to watch out for this just in case he's not giving a just in case speech he's telling you this is going to happen this is what you need to do the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil's using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all don't never Clan among or talk and make yourself clan we are one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away cuz you're not a right hand he he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another is that what God wants that's what God wants what's the enemy trying to do he's trying to stop God from having what he wants right it's that simple and now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you've got tapes on discipline in the church how we behave ourselves in the Church of God how we got to come here together and sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to have fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you got to praying cuz we're in the last days listen brother B didn't say just overcome your feelings and come to church no he said pray and find out what's going on till your feelings change he didn't say just be a hypocrite stuff it and fake it that's not what brother B's saying he said if you don't feel that way you better get to praying something's wrong something could be wrong in a relationship with a brother something could be wrong with yourself something's wrong somewhere if we don't feel that way don't just fake it don't just swallow it down don't just come because brother B said if if God's in my heart listen let's be real if God's in my heart I'll be there every time the doors open I want everybody to know God's in my heart and you're coming for the the wrong reason because you want people to see that God's in Your Heart Right but if you don't really feel that way it's time we got to praying because something's wrong because this isn't we should have love one for another and a desire to fellowship with one another and if that begins to dissipate something else is coming in that's wrong he said cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exhorted us to much more as we see the day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus and love one another this will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life how many times we live with those little roots of bitterness brother B said it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison acid of malice and jealousy and hatred that we just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it'll run him from the Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything don't you do that you just wax that much closer together take the Buckle as the brother testified and Minister here the other night about about having a buckle seeing it in a vision the buckles on the whole armor of God just pull her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you what is that that's the immune system of the body loving one another sticking with one another caring for one another amen oh praise God there's so much we're just going to we're just going to let some things go but let's go to Luke chapter 4 let's finish here Luke chapter 4 verse 17 and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted I love this we talk so much about The Healing Ministry of Jesus Christ but Jesus says he sent me to heal the brokenhearted amen and to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovery of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to priest the acceptable year of the Lord what a Ministry Jesus comes to bind up the Brokenhearted to set at Liberty those are captive you know sometimes we're captive by things that happened to us in the past captive by memories captive by emotions and Jesus come to set the captives free am he's come to bind up the Brokenhearted many of the things we react to and the things we struggle with is because of wounds broken heart and he also came to set at Liberty them that were bruised how does a cancer come many times a bruise but oh Christ is here to heal the bruise so we don't have to walk around a wounded Spirit a bruised Spirit susceptible for the enemy to come in say oh God keep me close to you I've been wounded I've been hurt would you pour the balm of Gilead into my heart cuz now this is not about me this is about everybody else I can't continue to go on nursing this hurt holding this bitterness I can't go on with this anymore because it'll take the Christ right out of my life it'll affect my brother it will drive Christ that God out of the church it'll do so many negative things I can't go on like this God would you come and heal my broken heart would you bind up my broken heart would you set at Liberty those that are bruised man let's Stand Together musicians if you'll please come in Matthew 8:16 it says when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick I believe God has sent his word today to cast out Spirits amen amen things that would hinder us things that would cause us to disconnect from the body or Harbor bitterness or allow complexes to to to cause us to believe lies and separate fellowship or or cause a an open window where the devil can get in I believe he's come to cast out Spirits with his word to set us free we don't have to continue fearing relationships we don't have to continue fearing rejection we don't have to continue being suspicious of everybody in leadership just because it was wrong in the past doesn't mean it's going to be wrong again we can't live suspicious of the pastor suspicious of the deacon we can't live suspicious of our brother and sister we can't live that way that's not a healthy church we can't live amen with a towards one another we can't live amen with with not wanting to be fully engaged that's not going to work this is not the day we live in we have to have some Freedom so we can plug all the way in amen amen and be a joint that supplieth now my personal responsibility the responsibility of Chad Lamb is to see this body built in love and to be a joint that suppli and anything in my emotion realm my past my H anything that would disrupt that is wrong and I want it to go away and I need to seek God if I've got something that's hindering that and I can't just get over it I need to get to praying because something's got to get out before I do damage to other people right and that's true for each one of us we are each one personally responsible for the building of the body the edifying of the body together in itself in love and that's why we're here God may use you one time this way and another time that way he may use you every time the same way it doesn't matter you're here to build the body of Christ together in love to move the plan of God forward in this day to move the manifestation of the word for our day forward am and the devil is constantly working to stop that that's where the battle is friends that's where the battle is I say God help me I don't want to be a window I want to be a wall I don't want to be a trap door and opening I want to be a fortress a wall and the devil's not going to enter in here to hurt everybody there I realize how dangerous my position is I have got to stay clean in my heart I've got to stay prayed up because it affects everybody else's lives but I think we all need to come to that realization that we've got to

the devil want to do derail disrupt stop the plan of God so God don't don't let it be me I tell you what God is doing is so amazing I'll share just a minute with you sister Jade's testimony my wife and I met with her Friday morning and I was stunned she works at the school with sister Deb John's they both are teachers and their caddy corner across the hall from one another this is Jade's first year at the school and and sister Deb goes over and introduces herself to her and and she begins to befriend her and tell her if you need anything you can come to me and I you ask me any questions and I'm here to help and so they struck up a friendship and Deb just befriended her and was kind to her and helpful and sister Jade has always had a heart for the God from from the time she was a young girl she would go to church by herself even her parents didn't go she would walk to the local church she got old enough to drive she would drive to church and she's been to several churches she told us but she said she got concerned about the world condition and how bad it was so she got on the internet and started looking up end time Pro prophecies and she came across a book by Owen jurgenson called Supernatural the life of William Brandon and she bought book one and she read book one and she took it to school one day and she walked across the hallway to Deb John and she says do you know anything about William brandom God is seeking out his children God is finding them as Beyond a needle in a Hy stack friends Beyond put the odds together that I could you can't even run the statistics on it amen it wasn't that Deb was witnessing to her she was witnessing by her life and she never mentioned brother brandom she asked her do do you know anything about William Brandon I would have been stuttering i' uh uh uh uh maybe something you [Music] know we've seen God do this with many people that are here several God has just grabbed you and pulled you in he found you he sought out his children and he brought them here and if God brought his children here I say God if you've entrusted this tender lamb here let us create the environment where that lamb can grow into your full measure cuz now I'm responsible for her growth should be serious about these things I had a brother overseas I was sharing with him some testimonies that were here and the brother said something to me that was struck me funny he said doesn't it feel good when you cast the net and fish come in I said brother we never cast a net the fish are jumping in the boat I mean we can't take any credit for anything we didn't do anything God is finding his own children God is bringing them into the fellowship himself and I just want to be faithful to do my part God's done his part I want to do my part I want to create the right atmosphere man God bless you all we sing will I give my mind completely to you Lord fill me with your thoughts make it all BR new change my life [Music] let me live in all that's true

in the scriptures she was talking about reading the messages she's been reading the message for quite a while she streamed some of our services and has been here for several weeks now but she loves reading the message and and she told us she goes I don't know I can't explain it I just know it's the truth I just know it's right and I said that's our experience too we can't explain it we just know inside that this is the truth so this is a wonderful blessed day for our sister Jade amen sister Jade because you love the Lord Jesus Christ you want to receive his pardoning grace you want to be identified with him we'll baptize you in his name but now because you want to obey his commandment to be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost we will do that according to the revelation of the word and baptize you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ dear Lord Jesus Oh I lay hands on my sister Lord that you would fulfill the confirmation of your promise in her life you promis that if we repent and are baptized in your name that you will fill us with the baptism of the Holy Ghost I pray God that you would fill her with your very life and presence and Lord may you bring this seed within her to full manifested life and use her Lord shelter her protect her guide her through every trap of the devil and every while of the enemy that would try to destroy her now Lord we ask that you would take her through Lord that you would lead her every step of the way if you could have Peter walk on water you can have our sister walk through every trial you can protect her and guide her and I ask that you do it now in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you Sister all right Blake set my spirit free that I might worship thee set my
