[13:26] world may you use him for your glory in
[13:29] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God
[13:34] bless you
[13:34] [Music]
[13:42] amen we can all stand now
[13:47] it's at the beginning of the year I like
[13:49] the baby dedications I wanted one for a
[13:51] month and we haven't hit the quota yet
[13:53] but we're doing pretty good
[13:55] but thank God I appreciate the Lord's
[13:57] goodness and I appreciate the people as
[13:59] dark as the world is they're not afraid
[14:02] for any gift God gives for life to come
[14:05] to this world some were afraid to bring
[14:07] children into the world but but if God
[14:09] gives the life God has a purpose for
[14:11] that life in this Dark Age and so we're
[14:13] not afraid we know what God gives God
[14:16] will take care of Amen
[14:17] and while we're standing let's turn to
[14:19] Revelation chapter 8 together we'll look
[14:22] at verse one
[14:23] and I want to welcome our visitors
[14:25] sister Samantha's most parents are here
[14:27] God bless you it's good to have you with
[14:29] us in the service and also I'm a good
[14:31] friend brother Irvin Ray Miller and his
[14:33] wife are sitting right here brother
[14:34] Irvin is from The Junction City group
[14:37] that me and Kyle went down to minister
[14:39] to we saw them baptized so make sure you
[14:42] greet them and shake their hand out
[14:43] their service God bless you it's good to
[14:45] have you both in the service today amen
[14:47] it worked out good they had a wedding to
[14:48] attend just north of here yesterday for
[14:51] a family member so they were in the
[14:53] neighborhood and so I thank God that he
[14:55] brought him our way amen
[14:58] so let's look here at Revelation chapter
[15:00] 8 verse one while we're still standing
[15:03] it says and when you open the seventh
[15:05] seal there was silence in heaven about
[15:07] the space of half an hour man God bless
[15:11] you as you take your seats
[15:14] and then I'd like to minister on a
[15:16] subject
[15:17] titled it the seventh seal brings him to
[15:20] Earth
[15:21] this is a phrase brother Branham uses it
[15:23] comes out of the message Souls that are
[15:25] in prison now and we'll take a look at
[15:27] that in just a few minutes when we get
[15:29] to that and I'll just share with you
[15:31] what my inspiration is and what I've
[15:33] been thinking
[15:35] but uh as we look at this we we find
[15:38] that when we when we look at the Book of
[15:41] Revelation we come through the Book of
[15:42] Revelation we come through the church
[15:44] ages and and chapters two and three and
[15:47] we come to chapter four when John is
[15:49] caught up and he sees one on the throne
[15:51] and he sees a book in his hand and the
[15:54] book is sealed with Seven Seals and and
[15:56] there's a cry going out for one who is
[15:58] worthy to take the book and loose the
[16:00] seals thereof and then we we see the the
[16:02] line of the tribe of Judah steps forward
[16:04] he steps forward as a slain lamb we know
[16:06] this is the picture of Jesus Christ and
[16:08] he comes to take the book and when he
[16:10] takes the book then he loosens the seals
[16:12] and then that's chapter five and then in
[16:14] chapter six we see the opening of six of
[16:17] the Seven Seals and we see them open in
[16:19] symbol form a symbol that represented a
[16:22] truth that was laying there and it went
[16:24] out as a symbol of a white horse rider
[16:26] or or a a
[16:28] red horse rider or a black horse rider
[16:31] pale horse rider so his opening in
[16:32] symbol form the the show that there's a
[16:35] truth laying here there's a mystery here
[16:37] and it opened in symbolic form but with
[16:39] without giving the revelation of the
[16:41] symbols and then we see the injection of
[16:44] Revelations chapter 7 and then we come
[16:46] to Revelation chapter 8 and this is the
[16:48] scripture we just read this is when he
[16:49] opens the seventh seal when you open the
[16:52] seventh seal there were silence in
[16:54] heaven about the space of half an hour
[16:55] and then this silence there's no symbols
[16:58] given there's there's nothing that would
[17:01] give you an indication or a clue amen
[17:04] about the truth that's laying in the
[17:06] seventh seal amen but it's one of the
[17:08] seals that sealed up the book that was
[17:10] in the hand of the one on the throne the
[17:12] the one that the lamb had overcome to
[17:15] redeem that he has a slain lamb had paid
[17:17] the price that he was the sacrifice amen
[17:20] that could buy back Redemption buy back
[17:22] what Adam had lost and now he comes and
[17:24] takes the book which we know is the
[17:25] title deed to all of creation and he
[17:28] takes it and he loosens the seals and
[17:30] then loosing the seals is unlocking the
[17:33] great mystery of what's contained in the
[17:36] book and how it got in the book and why
[17:37] it's in the book and and why it had to
[17:39] be redeemed and all about Redemption is
[17:42] sealed up in this book
[17:45] and then the sixth break I said like I
[17:48] said in symbolic form but the seventh
[17:51] there was silence
[17:53] and when we come over to Revelations
[17:56] chapter 10 now we find another book
[17:59] and brother Brown tells us this is the
[18:01] same book that was closed in Revelations
[18:03] chapter 5 now in Revelation chapter 10
[18:06] it's open and it's in the hand of the
[18:08] mighty Angel which is Christ
[18:10] and let's let's read together Revelation
[18:12] chapter 10 verse 1 and I saw another
[18:15] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[18:17] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[18:19] upon his head and his face was where the
[18:21] sun and his feet as pillars of fire this
[18:24] imagery it matches the imagery and
[18:26] description of Christ if we go back to
[18:28] Revelation chapter 1
[18:31] amen let's just go back to Revelation
[18:33] chapter one
[18:34] and and I'll just uh uh just freely
[18:37] admit to you that I'm going off the cuff
[18:40] here I'm going without notes but I'm
[18:42] just leading and following the leading
[18:43] of the spirit amen but but we want to
[18:45] see here that that in Revelation chapter
[18:49] 1 John now is receiving a revelation
[18:52] amen and he's on the Isle of Patmos and
[18:55] let's go down to verse 9. John chapter
[18:58] or Revelation 1 9 I John who also am
[19:01] your brother and companion and
[19:03] tribulation in the kingdom and patience
[19:04] of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is
[19:07] called Patmos for the word of God and
[19:08] for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was
[19:11] in the spirit on the Lord's day and I
[19:13] heard behind me a great voices of a
[19:15] trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the
[19:17] first and the last and what thou seeest
[19:19] writing a book and send it into the
[19:21] seven Church churches which are in Asia
[19:23] and to Ephesus and to Smyrna to pergamus
[19:25] unto thyatira and this artist unto
[19:28] Philadelphia unto laodicea so what we
[19:31] see is that voice is declaring itself
[19:33] I'm Alpha and Omega first and last this
[19:35] is Jesus Christ
[19:37] and in verse 12 says and I turn to see
[19:39] the voice that spoke with me
[19:41] so he turned to see a voice that's
[19:43] interesting language
[19:45] amendments the voice of God and he
[19:47] turned to see The Voice being turned I
[19:49] saw seven golden candlesticks and when
[19:51] he turned to see the verse The Voice the
[19:53] first thing he sees the seven golden
[19:54] candlesticks
[19:56] and in the midst of seven candlesticks
[19:58] one likened to the son of man clothed
[20:00] with a garment down to the foot and gird
[20:01] about the paps with a golden girdle amen
[20:04] and brother Benham early in his ministry
[20:06] he says amen this is in female form gird
[20:09] around the paps and the paps in the
[20:11] Bible were always the breast and we see
[20:13] him in the midst of the seven golden
[20:14] candlesticks in the midst of the church
[20:16] so here is Christ one like the son of
[20:18] man in the midst of the church and the
[20:21] Seven Church ages amen gird around the
[20:23] paths which later brother Brahm also
[20:25] said is the place the sash is worn for
[20:27] judgment amen or I mean priesthood I'm
[20:30] sorry and then no no judgment yeah
[20:32] that's right and so then he says
[20:35] I want to read this again in the midst
[20:36] of the seven going cancels one like unto
[20:38] the son of man clothed with the Garment
[20:40] down to the foot and gird about the
[20:42] paths with a golden girdle
[20:43] in his head and his hairs were white
[20:45] like wool as white as snow in his eyes
[20:47] were as a flame of fire and his feet
[20:49] like undefined brass as if they burn in
[20:51] the furnace and his voice is the sound
[20:53] of many Waters it's interesting he said
[20:55] one like unto the son of man he doesn't
[20:57] say it was the son of man but one like
[20:59] unto the son and this is one in the same
[21:00] image as the son of man and it's in the
[21:03] midst of the seven Church ages and it's
[21:05] in female form and the voice was the
[21:07] voice of many Waters and we know the
[21:09] interpretation of many Waters in the
[21:11] Bible is many peoples Nations and
[21:13] tongues
[21:15] so this is Christ through the churches
[21:18] Christ through his bride amen and he's
[21:20] showing it in a full picture amen this
[21:22] is a preview of what he's coming to in
[21:23] fullness
[21:25] and he had in his right hand Seven Stars
[21:27] and out of his mouth with a sharp
[21:28] two-edges sword and his countenance was
[21:30] as the sun shining in his strength and
[21:33] when I saw him I fell at his feet is
[21:34] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[21:36] saying unto me fear not I am the first
[21:39] and the last I am he that liveth and was
[21:42] dead and behold I'm Alive forevermore
[21:44] amen and have the keys of hell and of
[21:47] death
[21:47] so we know this is Jesus Christ speaking
[21:50] but his voice was the voice of many
[21:52] Waters His Image he was in the midst of
[21:55] the seven golden candlesticks and we see
[21:57] some things that describe him his head
[21:58] and hair were white like wool
[22:01] clothed the Garment down to the foot
[22:03] amen Gert about to pass with the golden
[22:05] girdle with hairs and head white like
[22:07] wolves white as snow eyes is a flame of
[22:09] fire feet like in the fine brasses that
[22:11] they have been burnt voice of many
[22:12] Waters amen his in his countenance was
[22:16] as the sun shining in his strength verse
[22:18] 16. so now we come back to Revelation
[22:21] 10. let's go back to revelation 10.
[22:28] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[22:31] from heaven clothed with the cloud
[22:34] and a rainbow was upon his head a
[22:36] rainbow is the the Covenant sign that
[22:39] was given to Noah and it was the promise
[22:41] of God that I will no longer destroy the
[22:43] world with a flood it was a promise to
[22:45] the people of Mercy a promise of God's
[22:48] salvation and now he has the rainbow
[22:51] Covenant because he is God's promise of
[22:53] salvation
[22:55] he is the escape from judgment
[22:58] he was clothed with the cloud and
[23:00] rainbow was upon us and his feet his
[23:02] face was as it were the son his
[23:04] countenance as the sun his face as it
[23:06] were the son and his feet as pillars of
[23:08] Fire
[23:09] and he had in his hand a little book
[23:11] open not closed now but open and he set
[23:15] his right foot upon the scene is left
[23:16] foot upon the Earth and cried with the
[23:18] loud voices when a lion roared and when
[23:20] he had cried seven Thunders uttered
[23:22] their voices
[23:23] and when the seven Thunders had uttered
[23:24] their voices I was about to write and I
[23:26] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me
[23:28] seal up those things which is seven
[23:30] Thunders uttered and write them not
[23:34] and the angel which I saw stand upon the
[23:36] sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[23:37] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[23:40] liveth forever and ever who created
[23:41] heaven and the things that therein are
[23:43] and the earth and the things that there
[23:45] and are in the sea and the Sea and the
[23:48] things which are therein that there
[23:50] should be time no longer
[23:52] but in the days of the voice of the
[23:54] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[23:56] sound the mystery of God should be
[23:58] finished as he had declared to his
[24:00] servants the prophets
[24:03] so there was one great mystery which is
[24:05] the mystery of God
[24:07] and that mystery was going to remain
[24:09] sealed up
[24:11] or silent until the seventh angel begins
[24:15] to sound
[24:16] then the mystery of God
[24:19] should be finished as he is declared to
[24:21] a service to prophets and we know that
[24:23] the seven Thunders uttered their voices
[24:25] and when the seventh unders uttered
[24:27] their voices they uttered something
[24:29] intelligible they under uttered
[24:31] something that could be understood
[24:32] because John was about to write what the
[24:35] seven Thunders uttered so they
[24:37] communicated something they disclosed
[24:40] something and John was going to write it
[24:41] down amen but but the voice from Heaven
[24:44] told him to not write it but seal up
[24:47] amen so the voices were then put back in
[24:50] silence
[24:52] only John heard it amen and when John
[24:54] heard it he was about to write because
[24:56] that's what he was told to do write the
[24:57] things that he sees and he hears and put
[25:00] it in a book amen but he he goes to
[25:02] write it and he's told don't write it
[25:03] but seal it up so so there's something
[25:05] else the seven Thunders were to remain
[25:08] sealed amen until a later time
[25:11] and we live in the later time amen we
[25:14] live in the end time amen when the seven
[25:16] Thunders are to be unsealed and the
[25:18] Seven Thunders amen they contained the
[25:20] revelation of what the symbols were amen
[25:23] back in Revelation chapter 6 amen but
[25:25] but but Revelation chapter 8 when the
[25:28] seventh seal was opened there was
[25:30] silence
[25:31] why because the opening of the seventh
[25:33] seal amen and the Seven Thunders are
[25:36] tied together
[25:38] they were silenced they spoke but they
[25:40] were silent so that we could see it's in
[25:42] the word that something's there
[25:43] something was said because brother
[25:45] Branham he used to think that these
[25:47] Seven Seals amen they're still he said
[25:49] he used to say it like this there's
[25:50] seals on the inside of the book on the
[25:51] back side of the book and he would say
[25:53] the front side and the backside he would
[25:55] make statements about these seals and
[25:57] seals that are open and seals that are
[25:58] closed amen and what brother Brown was
[26:00] seeing is he's seeing amen the opening
[26:03] of The Seven Seals in symbol form but
[26:05] he's also seeing there's something else
[26:07] sealed seven Thunders are sealed amen by
[26:10] the voice of Heaven telling John to seal
[26:12] them up and he knows they have to be
[26:13] open and brother Benham used to think
[26:15] those are something that's not even
[26:16] written in the word but then he said you
[26:18] can't add to and you can't take away
[26:20] amen so God had to show it here in
[26:22] Revelation 10 so that we would know that
[26:25] those were voices that spoke that
[26:26] relayed some information some Revelation
[26:29] but it had to be sealed so it had to be
[26:31] put in the book so we would know but it
[26:34] was silenced in this book
[26:39] when the lamb opens it in Revelation 8
[26:42] it's silent when it speaks then it was
[26:44] silenced again
[26:47] so the seventh seal in the revelation of
[26:50] seven Thunders are linked together
[26:54] and it has something to do with the
[26:56] mystery of God being finished
[27:01] that's what I so want to look at today
[27:03] by the help of God
[27:06] amen and I I get to to places like this
[27:10] where you look and you look and you read
[27:12] and you read and you meditate and you
[27:14] get to the point where you've read so
[27:15] much and you just don't want to read
[27:16] anymore you just you just I just want
[27:20] the reality
[27:22] of everything I've read and everything
[27:24] that prophets told us
[27:26] I get to the place where I I'm studying
[27:28] this I just can't study anymore I told
[27:30] my wife I get to the place where I just
[27:31] got to go preach it because I'm just
[27:33] fiddling with it it's too much and I
[27:34] just don't I don't I don't like my notes
[27:37] I don't I got too much stuff and I get
[27:39] rid of half of what I got and I just got
[27:41] to come and preach and share what's on
[27:42] my heart and ask God to pull it out
[27:46] because this this seventh seal we we
[27:51] live in the end time we know that as
[27:53] Believers we believe we're in the end
[27:55] time and that's the time of the the last
[27:57] Angel's message and when the last Angel
[27:59] begins to sound the mystery of God
[28:01] should be finished as he declared to his
[28:03] servants the prophets and we live in
[28:05] that age amen where the mystery of God's
[28:07] finished we're the Seven Seals have been
[28:10] revealed where the seven Thunders have
[28:12] sounded
[28:14] amen and it's all to do something it's
[28:17] all for a purpose amen and it's all to
[28:20] bring about a manifestation it's all to
[28:22] bring something to pass
[28:25] and and so I'm gonna take a look at a
[28:29] few quotes here but I want you to
[28:31] remember the title of the seventh seal
[28:33] brings him to Earth and that's a direct
[28:35] statement from a message and we'll get
[28:37] to that just in a minute and I pray that
[28:39] God will will help bring things clear
[28:41] not confusing but clear
[28:43] in the message the seven seal the
[28:45] prophet says the eighth chapter only
[28:47] reveals the scene of the seven seal
[28:49] where nothing else is revealed
[28:51] because it was silence
[28:53] now nothing is not revealed in the
[28:55] seventh seal now has nothing to do with
[28:58] the seventh chapter of Revelations it's
[28:59] the revealing of the Seven Seals
[29:01] perfectly mute
[29:03] and if I only had time I'll try a few
[29:05] places to show you all the way back from
[29:07] Genesis the 7th chapter the seventh seal
[29:10] is spoke of from the very beginning in
[29:12] Genesis this seventh these seals move
[29:14] right up
[29:16] that's such an interesting statement and
[29:18] for a while I would say that statement
[29:20] perplexed me
[29:22] because I was looking at the seals as
[29:25] something to do with the New Testament
[29:26] only because it it laps over the church
[29:29] ages and all of these other things and
[29:31] now he says all the way back in Genesis
[29:33] you can see the seventh seal you can see
[29:36] these seals from the very beginning
[29:37] moving right up and so I always like to
[29:41] go back to the beginning so let's go
[29:43] back to to Genesis chapter 1.
[29:47] we've done this many times this is not
[29:49] something we have not ever gone through
[29:50] before but I just want to reintroduce
[29:54] the foundation and re-familiarize
[29:56] ourselves with these scriptures and then
[29:58] move forward from there
[30:00] in Genesis chapter 1 verse 26
[30:05] it says and God said let us make man in
[30:07] our image after our likeness and let
[30:09] them have dominion over the fish of the
[30:11] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[30:12] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[30:14] and over every creeping thing that
[30:16] creepeth upon the Earth
[30:18] so God created man in his own image in
[30:20] the image that God created he him male
[30:22] and female created he them
[30:25] and God blessed them and God said unto
[30:28] them be fruitful
[30:31] and multiply and replenish the Earth and
[30:33] subdue it and have dominion over the
[30:35] fish of the sea and over the fount of
[30:36] the air and over every living thing that
[30:38] moveth upon the Earth
[30:39] and God said behold I have given you
[30:42] every herb-bearing seed which is upon
[30:44] the face of all the Earth and every tree
[30:45] and which is the fruit of
[30:47] fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it
[30:50] shall be for meat and to every beast of
[30:52] the earth and every fowl of the air into
[30:54] everything that creepeth upon the Earth
[30:56] wherein there is life I have given every
[30:58] green herb for meat and it was so
[31:00] and God saw everything that he had made
[31:02] and behold it was very good in the
[31:05] evening in the morning were the sixth
[31:06] day
[31:07] let's go over to chapter 2 thus at the
[31:09] heavens and the Earth were finished and
[31:11] all the hosts of them and on the seventh
[31:13] day God ended his work which he had made
[31:15] and he rested on the seventh day from
[31:17] all his work which he had made and God
[31:20] blessed the seventh day and Sanctified
[31:22] it because that in it he had rested from
[31:24] all his work which God created and made
[31:28] so we see now God in the sixth day in
[31:32] the making of man he made the male and
[31:34] female he told them to multiply and
[31:36] replenish and subdue the Earth bring it
[31:39] under Dominion have dominion over the
[31:41] Earth and when he's seen all that he had
[31:43] made he said behold it is very good and
[31:46] when he said it was very good then he
[31:49] moved into his rest he moved into the
[31:51] seventh day and in the seventh day he
[31:53] ended his work which he had made and he
[31:55] rested on the seventh day from the work
[31:57] which he had made and we've been through
[32:00] this several times but we always ask the
[32:01] question did God need to rest
[32:04] was he tired
[32:06] were the previous six thousand years
[32:08] taxing on him
[32:10] into a place where he had to rest no but
[32:13] this rest of God is very uh interesting
[32:16] because the Bible is a very interesting
[32:17] book amen the prophet of God tells us
[32:19] that the Bible condenses its truths
[32:22] it's got to bring the whole revelation
[32:24] of God Amen of Jesus Christ and bring it
[32:27] into these pages
[32:29] and it condenses its truths amen and and
[32:31] it's also hidden and revealed in
[32:34] Simplicity and brother remember says the
[32:36] the true meaning is read between the
[32:39] lines
[32:40] like a love letter when somebody writes
[32:42] to you a personal note and they they
[32:44] make innuendos or little statements that
[32:46] only you and them would know and you get
[32:48] the meaning but a stranger picking up
[32:49] the letter wouldn't get the meeting
[32:50] brother Adam said that's how this
[32:52] Bible's written amen it's written to his
[32:55] bride it's written to his elect amen and
[32:57] by Revelation she catches what he's
[33:00] saying
[33:01] and then God took his rest I don't
[33:03] believe God was tired I don't believe he
[33:04] was out there with a pickaxe and a
[33:06] shovel until he had blisters on his
[33:07] hands
[33:09] but after he had made everything that he
[33:12] had made in the six days and he had put
[33:14] man and Dominion of it all and given him
[33:16] destructions to multiply and replenish
[33:18] take dominion and bring something so
[33:20] subjection all of my creation now he
[33:23] could take his rest because he could
[33:25] rest while his son was in charge
[33:29] he arrested from all that it created and
[33:32] all he made he wasn't creating a making
[33:33] anymore now he put rulership of
[33:36] everything he created and made he put it
[33:39] into the hands of his son and his son's
[33:40] wife and now amen if I could say it this
[33:43] way this seventh day is the silence
[33:48] of God
[33:50] God's not the queen God's not working
[33:53] God's not the one Speaking he's not the
[33:56] one that's positioning and moving he's
[33:57] not doing all of that amen God went to
[34:00] take his rest but now his son is the one
[34:03] doing that his son is decreeing and
[34:05] taking dominion and keeping and ordering
[34:08] and protecting his son now it's not that
[34:10] there's no work taking place amen but
[34:13] the work is not being done by God is
[34:15] being done by the son of God
[34:19] yeah amen so we see a silence in the
[34:22] seventh day brother bam said this is all
[34:24] the way back in Genesis
[34:26] all the way back in the beginning amen
[34:28] we see and we see a Breaking of a
[34:31] revelation of six days or six seals we
[34:34] see the breaking of the first day
[34:36] there's light the breaking of the second
[34:37] day and we see a breaking and under the
[34:40] breaking amen we see something under
[34:42] that seal which coming into
[34:44] manifestation but when it comes into the
[34:46] seventh we don't see anything all we see
[34:49] is God rests
[34:51] now he's not decreeing now he's not
[34:52] speaking now there's a silence in the
[34:54] seventh day but in the seventh day
[34:56] there's still something happening amen
[34:59] because now in the seventh day amen
[35:02] there's a Son of God and there's a
[35:04] daughter of God who are united together
[35:06] as one flesh taking dominion over the
[35:09] Earth
[35:11] this is what's going to happen in the
[35:13] great seventh day which is the
[35:15] Millennium the thousandth year we've
[35:16] come 6 000 years since the fall and in
[35:19] six thousand years God went back to work
[35:21] he was resting leaving Dominion to his
[35:23] son but when his son fell amen it ruined
[35:27] the Great Masterpiece of God which God's
[35:29] Masterpiece was a masterpiece family
[35:32] for the prophet of God says in the
[35:33] message Masterpiece God's Masterpiece
[35:35] amen it wasn't done when he just created
[35:38] the son he looked at the Sun and he said
[35:40] not good that man should dwell alone I'm
[35:42] not finished yet there's a there's
[35:44] something this picture is not what I had
[35:46] in my mind yet it's not good that he
[35:49] should dwell alone and so in order to
[35:51] make a wife for him he takes out of him
[35:53] amen takes out of him a rib a part of
[35:56] Adam to become a further expression of
[36:00] Adam and he takes the feminine life that
[36:02] was in Adam and puts it in this second
[36:04] vessel which was made from the elements
[36:06] of Adam amen and now we have Adam and
[36:09] Adam
[36:10] [Music]
[36:12] Adam male Adam female Adam in a further
[36:16] expression out of Adam is now the female
[36:21] and then he the knights them back
[36:23] together and what is the first marriage
[36:25] amen and and Humanity in our Bible Amen
[36:29] in that first marriage now he looks at
[36:31] it all and says it's very good and now
[36:34] he can take his rest now the Masterpiece
[36:36] is finished it wasn't just a masterpiece
[36:38] male it's a masterpiece family and in
[36:41] the Masterpiece he gives a decree
[36:42] multiply replenish fill the Earth and
[36:45] subdue it
[36:47] this is God's masterpiece
[36:50] then the enemy comes in and through
[36:52] deception he ruins God's Masterpiece and
[36:54] in the ruining of the Masterpiece now
[36:56] God moves out of his rest
[37:01] and he comes down to re begin Redemption
[37:04] of a fallen race and then first thing he
[37:07] does is when he comes amen he comes and
[37:09] declares what's happened he passes
[37:11] judgment amen he gives a prophecy of a
[37:13] redeemer coming the seed of the woman
[37:15] which will bruise the Serpent's head
[37:17] amen so he comes down and he starts with
[37:20] judgment then he gives a prophecy and
[37:23] then he slays the lamb to start the work
[37:25] of redemption
[37:27] and then for six thousand years he's
[37:29] been building back the masterpiece
[37:32] bringing back the image of what was
[37:34] falling in the whole Old Testament amen
[37:36] amen was was the Patriarchs and the
[37:39] prophets and God building building
[37:40] building amen he he starts with Abraham
[37:44] amen he builds and he builds and he
[37:46] comes to the nation of Israel and he
[37:48] brings him to the promised land and he
[37:50] builds all the way up to David he builds
[37:52] all the way up to Solomon amen and he
[37:54] comes through the prophets and he comes
[37:55] to the Psalms amen until finally the
[37:58] perfect one that all the prophets were
[38:00] expressing amen that all the prophecies
[38:03] were expressing that all the Patriarchs
[38:05] were expressing the perfect one comes on
[38:07] the scene which is Jesus Christ himself
[38:09] God and flesh
[38:10] and he was the fullness of the word
[38:14] all that the Old Testament was now he
[38:17] stands what is he he's the last Adam
[38:22] he's a restored he's he's a Son of God
[38:26] to bring the restoration
[38:30] but what does God do in restoring the
[38:33] Masterpiece when he when he finally
[38:34] proved that he was the perfect son when
[38:36] he was tested in every way amen when he
[38:39] was found without spot or blemish now he
[38:42] became a tested lamb the Lambs that come
[38:44] to pass over weren't just any lamb they
[38:46] had to be a perfect lamb and they had to
[38:48] go through the testing amen by the
[38:49] priest now Christ comes through the
[38:51] testing period and proved that he would
[38:53] not forsake one word
[38:57] and now as as the perfect sacrifice amen
[39:02] he comes and he sheds his blood which is
[39:03] his created blood of God and that shed
[39:06] blood becomes the price of redemption to
[39:07] buy back and at Calvary amen he takes
[39:10] from his side
[39:13] blood and water the elements where which
[39:15] you'll build now his spiritual bride
[39:19] what's he doing he's restoring what was
[39:21] falling in Eden he's bringing back the
[39:24] Masterpiece and now for 2000 years he's
[39:25] been building a bride
[39:28] to do what to bring back a union
[39:32] to do what to bring on a millennium and
[39:35] what is the Millennium the seventh day
[39:38] the first time God took his rest and
[39:40] gave his creation to a son and his son's
[39:43] wife amen his rest was interrupted by
[39:45] the Fall amen but now amen he's come
[39:48] himself in flesh as Jesus Christ amen
[39:51] and he's created a bride and United the
[39:53] two together so that God can finish the
[39:56] seven thousandth year the one thousand
[39:58] year period the seventh day that was
[40:00] interrupted before and now when God
[40:02] rests what's happening in his rest in
[40:04] the Millennium now he turns back all of
[40:07] creation back to the son of David who
[40:09] will sit on the throne of David which is
[40:11] Jesus Christ and his bride
[40:17] the seventh is completion
[40:20] so the seventh seal is completion
[40:29] so
[40:31] the prophet of God says in the message
[40:34] the spoken word is the Original Seed he
[40:35] says all of God's Sons must be the same
[40:37] yes sir
[40:39] to be born of the word and spirit brings
[40:41] us back to the spoken word again like in
[40:43] John 3 see to be born of the water and
[40:46] the spirit what does it do then it
[40:48] brings you right back again to the place
[40:50] of where you should have been at the
[40:51] beginning
[40:53] we were all born wrong because of the
[40:55] serpent seed because of the fall in the
[40:58] garden it corrupted humanity and we we
[41:00] all came but we didn't come the way we
[41:03] were originally intended to come
[41:06] and so now we've come with corruption
[41:07] but when we're born of the water and the
[41:09] spirit that's why we have to be born
[41:11] again even the term born again points
[41:14] right to serpency right to the fall amen
[41:16] because our first birth Us in corruption
[41:18] amen but our second birth versus
[41:20] incorruptible
[41:23] by The Incorruptible seed
[41:26] so now we have to be born again because
[41:29] of what happened Amen in that when we're
[41:31] born of the water spirit what does it do
[41:33] it brings us right back into the place
[41:35] where we should have been in the
[41:36] beginning
[41:37] why because of the price of redemption
[41:40] he paid the price that's the reason
[41:42] Christ's death brings us right back
[41:44] again to where sons of God
[41:46] that's what we were supposed to be
[41:48] now he says if Eve would have brought
[41:50] forth that child
[41:52] she would have finally done it did not
[41:54] God tell her multiply and replenish the
[41:56] Earth but she had to walk over here and
[41:58] play the part of a
[42:00] what did God want
[42:03] God he set forth his son and his son's
[42:07] bride and why was Adam given a bride to
[42:10] reproduce himself
[42:12] what would it be to reproduce himself to
[42:15] reproduce another Son of God
[42:17] a son of God
[42:19] male out of him comes female United back
[42:23] together they're still the same thing to
[42:25] do what to reproduce another Son of God
[42:29] and reproduce another Son of God and
[42:31] another Son of God and another Son of
[42:33] God and then this is just my personal
[42:35] belief based off the message amen if
[42:38] there had been no fall
[42:40] I would have come forth
[42:43] that way
[42:46] I don't understand the mechanics of it
[42:47] I'm not going to talk about the
[42:48] mechanics but I would have come forth
[42:49] that way the original way
[42:52] without corruption and been on this
[42:54] Earth that was God's original intent
[43:00] but now I've come forth in corruption
[43:02] because of perversion because of leaving
[43:04] the word because of the fall and now I
[43:06] have to be redeemed back there have to
[43:08] be a price paid for me and then I by
[43:11] faith amen have to connect back to the
[43:13] price that was paid for me and I have to
[43:15] be born again which means to see Gene
[43:17] have gone inside of me must be quickened
[43:19] by the spirit of God and come to life to
[43:21] unite me back to what I originally
[43:22] should have been
[43:24] and then that revelation will bring
[43:26] changes in my life and bring me into the
[43:28] image of Christ and will bring me back
[43:31] to the place I should have been because
[43:32] it will eventually change this body
[43:35] and we'll have a glorified body like
[43:37] unto his
[43:38] and to reconnect me with my theophany
[43:40] which I should have had from the
[43:42] beginning
[43:45] so
[43:46] now we find that God is restoring and
[43:50] don't forget we're we're still talking
[43:52] about the seven seal we're talking about
[43:53] the seven seal brings him to Earth
[43:56] and the message Satan's Eden Prophet God
[43:59] says so God knew that we would be here
[44:01] but then he put us in flesh so we would
[44:03] be contacted in order he could contact
[44:05] he became one of us when he became Jesus
[44:08] Christ the son of God himself the
[44:10] fullness of the manifestation of God
[44:12] therefore that was God's purpose to
[44:15] display his attributes and fellowship
[44:17] so what was God's purpose to display his
[44:19] attributes and fellowship
[44:21] when I was in my father I knew nothing
[44:23] about it but when I became his son and
[44:24] was born of him I was an attribute a
[44:26] part of my father and you're a part of
[44:29] your father
[44:31] as and as children of God we are part of
[44:34] God's attribute that was in him made
[44:36] flesh like he was made flesh so we can
[44:38] have Fellowship one with the other as a
[44:40] family of God upon the Earth and that
[44:43] was God's purpose at the beginning
[44:46] what did God want he wanted Fellowship
[44:49] of his attributes of himself Amen to
[44:51] become Sons and Daughters of God to have
[44:54] Fellowship together with him and one
[44:56] another upon the Earth that's why he
[44:59] created this Earth that's why he placed
[45:00] his son and daughter here and that's why
[45:02] he told him to multiply and replenish
[45:05] that was what he wanted in the beginning
[45:08] yes sir that's what God wanted at the
[45:11] beginning
[45:12] he had everything under control and he
[45:14] turned man over in the Garden of Eden on
[45:17] free moral agencies say son it's yours
[45:19] what a beautiful place God Was So
[45:20] Satisfied until he just went back and
[45:22] rested from all his works every tree
[45:24] never brought forth Thorns with thistles
[45:26] no berries ever come off of a Thorn Tree
[45:28] everything was perfect all seeds were
[45:30] perfect everything was in perfect
[45:31] condition
[45:33] then when he went to take a little rest
[45:35] his enemy slipped in with the seat and
[45:37] took it over by misinterpreting his
[45:40] program to his children
[45:43] how did how did Satan ruin the program
[45:46] by misinterpreting the word of God
[45:51] he he
[45:52] mistranslated misinterpreted
[45:54] misrepresented what God Said and twisted
[45:57] what God Said and enticed even by her
[46:00] own lust she was led away amen and
[46:02] caused the fall and ruined nation and
[46:04] now for six thousand years he's built
[46:06] building his own Eden
[46:08] Satan's in which is about come to
[46:10] perfection
[46:14] and so
[46:16] we see now coming to this seventh seal
[46:20] seven is the number of completion
[46:23] so in six days God made all that he had
[46:27] made and he established it as perfect
[46:29] and and and gave them Dominion on the
[46:32] seventh day he turned it over to them
[46:35] and he rested signifying a complete work
[46:38] the Masterpiece is done
[46:41] now that wasn't the end of the
[46:43] Masterpiece because the Masterpiece was
[46:45] going to multiply
[46:47] that was the intention to become a
[46:48] family upon the Earth
[46:50] but he had done everything he needed to
[46:53] do
[46:54] his work was completed now they were
[46:56] commissioned to continue on and multiply
[46:59] and replace and if they would have
[47:00] stayed behind the word it would have
[47:02] been perfect
[47:04] but they left the word and we know that
[47:05] that serves a purpose because in the
[47:07] fall we learned so much about God
[47:10] we learned about Redemption we learn
[47:11] about salvation healing and all of these
[47:14] things so God is expressing himself even
[47:16] through the the fall
[47:18] but we see here that in the seventh seal
[47:21] brother Brandon makes this statement
[47:23] here in the seventh seal
[47:25] he said we must remember that this
[47:27] seventh seal was the end of time of all
[47:29] things
[47:30] that's right
[47:32] the things written in the seven seal
[47:35] book seal up of the Plan of Redemption
[47:36] from before the foundation of the world
[47:38] it every bit ends it is the end it is
[47:41] the end of the struggling world is the
[47:43] end of struggling nature it is the end
[47:45] of everything and there is the end of
[47:47] the trumpets it's the end of the vials
[47:49] it's the end of the Earth It's The End
[47:51] even of the end time
[47:53] it's even the end of time sorry time
[47:55] runs out the Bible said so
[47:58] uh Revelation chapter 10 1 to 7th verse
[48:02] runs out the angel said time shall be no
[48:05] more in the days of this great thing to
[48:07] happen everything runs out in this time
[48:09] the end of at the end of this seventh
[48:12] seal
[48:12] so the seventh seal is the completion of
[48:16] whatever was sealed in this book under
[48:18] these seals the seventh is coming to the
[48:20] completion
[48:22] and it's the completion of redemption
[48:24] and the completion of redemption is what
[48:26] well what is being redeemed redeemed
[48:29] means to buy back and bring into its
[48:31] proper place or to its former State what
[48:33] was being redeemed being redeemed back
[48:35] to what God originally looked at and
[48:37] said it's very good and went and rested
[48:40] so everything is redeeming back to this
[48:43] place Amen in the seventh seal amen the
[48:46] seventh seal brings everything back to
[48:49] this place it ends time it ends the time
[48:51] for this and the time for that
[48:53] everything just ends up on the seventh
[48:55] seal and we come right back into the
[48:57] full masterpiece
[49:03] and because of that
[49:06] I wouldn't say the seventh seal is one
[49:09] thing
[49:10] and I might say that wrong I don't even
[49:12] know what language to use
[49:14] but if I take the seven seal and just
[49:16] make the seven seal one pin prick event
[49:20] and the timeline
[49:21] the seventh seal is the end of the Trump
[49:23] is the end of the vial the end of the
[49:25] ushering into the Millennium it's the
[49:27] end of all time which we know time runs
[49:29] out on the seventh seal but time doesn't
[49:31] run out to the end of the millennium
[49:33] which is the end of the seventh day and
[49:35] then we step into new heavens and new
[49:37] earth and into eternity where there is
[49:38] no more time
[49:41] so so the seventh seal encompasses the
[49:45] completion
[49:47] and the completion is a process
[49:49] here's how brother Branham says it
[49:51] notice it's the end of the church age
[49:53] it's the end of the Seven Seals it's the
[49:56] end of the trumpets it's the end of the
[49:58] vials it even ends the ushering end of
[50:00] the Millennium that's on the seventh
[50:02] seal so you see there's a lot of things
[50:03] included in the seventh seal
[50:07] it's just like firing a rocket into the
[50:09] air and that rocket explodes here and it
[50:11] goes up then it explodes again it puts
[50:13] out five stars one of those Stars
[50:15] explodes and blows out five stars from
[50:17] it and then one of them Stars explodes
[50:19] blows out five stars from it see it
[50:21] fades out
[50:22] that's what the seventh seal it just
[50:24] ends the time for the world it ends the
[50:27] time for this it means the time for that
[50:29] it ends the time for this it's it ends
[50:32] the time
[50:33] everything just ended up on the seventh
[50:36] seal
[50:38] why because it's the completion of
[50:40] redemption
[50:42] it's the finishing of the work of
[50:44] redemption It's the final seal it's
[50:47] completion and everything finishes it's
[50:50] the brother remember calls it the end
[50:52] time seal
[50:54] it's the seal under which reveals the
[50:57] mystery of God
[50:59] and then brother Branham comes along and
[51:01] preaches Christ is the mystery of God
[51:03] revealed he couldn't preach that until
[51:04] the opening of the seventh seal because
[51:06] the seventh seal will reveal the mystery
[51:08] of God and Christ is the mystery of God
[51:10] revealed
[51:11] so if you want to see the Revelation or
[51:13] the revealing of the mystery of God from
[51:15] Revelation 10 7 then you must see Christ
[51:18] because Christ is the mystery of God
[51:20] revealed and Christ is revealed under
[51:23] the seventh seal
[51:25] that's why this whole Bible is the
[51:27] seventh seal
[51:29] because this is the revelation of Jesus
[51:31] Christ this is the mystery of God being
[51:33] unfolded through through time
[51:37] how's it unfolded through people
[51:42] we go back and read the Bible
[51:44] the Bible is a record of people
[51:48] it's people from the beginning to the
[51:50] end and when one person Fades off the
[51:52] scene another comes on the scene and we
[51:54] follow their life and they fade off
[51:55] another comes on the scene they fade off
[51:57] another what is this the brother Benham
[52:00] said the Bible is the written record of
[52:02] the son of God
[52:05] Jesus Christ is the word is the word of
[52:07] God is is the word made manifest and
[52:10] here we have the word of God the record
[52:12] of the Son of God but he also called
[52:13] this a book of redemption
[52:15] he also called it a marriage certificate
[52:18] he also called it the title deed
[52:21] he also called the written record of the
[52:22] Son of God he also called it God in
[52:24] written form
[52:27] and what is it it's it is records of
[52:31] lives
[52:35] so the mystery of God must have
[52:37] something to do with Christ and Christ
[52:39] must have something to do with people
[52:46] amen
[52:50] oh God is amazing
[52:54] in the message shalom
[52:56] it says we heard the word say that in
[52:58] the days of the seventh angel and the
[53:00] church age he just said the seventh
[53:02] Angel's message would be the last
[53:04] message
[53:05] and then oh we find out over here in
[53:07] Revelation 10 and the days of the
[53:09] message of the seventh angel the
[53:10] mysteries of God should be finished the
[53:13] seventh seal would be pulled back
[53:15] it should be there then all at once when
[53:18] it happened a vision broke said go to
[53:20] Tucson a great noise will take place at
[53:22] this time so you'll thoroughly
[53:23] understand and know that it's sin it'll
[53:26] just shake the Earth nearly all of you
[53:28] know about it it's on tape months before
[53:30] it happened then it happened then
[53:32] appeared in the sky Shalom what is it
[53:35] it's the changing beats the sympathy or
[53:37] the symphony he's talking about
[53:41] we know Revelation 10 in the days of the
[53:44] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[53:46] sound well we all know clearly that
[53:49] William Branham was the seventh angel
[53:52] and when he began to sound he said not
[53:54] when he went on his healing campaigns
[53:55] but we begin to sound out his ministry
[53:57] amen the message that God had given him
[53:59] which was the seventh seal he was the
[54:01] messenger of the seven seal that was his
[54:03] message
[54:06] and he said the seventh seal will be
[54:09] pulled back at that time and be pulled
[54:10] back and then when it happened
[54:12] a vision broke forth we're talking about
[54:15] the pulling back of the seventh seal the
[54:17] opening of the seventh seal a vision
[54:18] caught him out to Tucson amen where he
[54:21] could contact in that constellation of
[54:23] angels which come in the form of a a
[54:25] cloud a white pyramid and brothers the
[54:28] pyramid which is the Capstone the
[54:29] finishing off of the New Testament
[54:31] Church amen but later when the angel
[54:33] told him to turn it to the right he
[54:34] turned it to the right and he saw that
[54:37] it was the head of Jesus Christ the
[54:39] headship coming to the body
[54:42] the full word amen the mind of Christ
[54:45] now coming down to connect with his
[54:47] bride on Earth Amen to form one being
[54:50] the marriage amen the union of Christ
[54:52] and his bride amen was taking place
[54:54] under what under the pulling back of the
[54:56] seventh seal
[54:59] had to bring back to a marriage because
[55:00] in the beginning that's where it went
[55:03] so we got to bring it back to that Union
[55:06] and in that he turned the picture to the
[55:08] right and he saw him and what was it he
[55:10] said it was angel's wings and they make
[55:12] up a cloud and it looked like a cloud
[55:13] and the cloud was made by angel's wings
[55:15] and they were the seven the the seven
[55:17] angels to the seven Church ages
[55:19] representing the completion of the
[55:21] church ages and at the completion of the
[55:23] church ages the fullness of that was
[55:25] Christ amen we saw it prefigured in
[55:27] Revelation chapter one
[55:29] and now the fullness is coming to the
[55:32] body
[55:33] and he was
[55:35] clothed with a cloud
[55:38] like Revelation 10 1.
[55:40] the mighty angel coming down clothed
[55:42] with a cloud
[55:44] in his face shine like the sun and his
[55:47] feet as pillars of Fire
[55:50] what is it it's Christ
[55:53] the anointed word of Christ the anointed
[55:55] one Christ Jesus Christ coming to his
[55:59] body
[56:00] what under the seventh seal
[56:04] because it's the ending of the church
[56:06] ages
[56:08] that ends under the seventh seal in the
[56:10] ending of the church ages brought
[56:12] completion and completion would bring a
[56:13] bride to connection with her bridegroom
[56:18] praise God
[56:22] and what was that what was that cloud in
[56:24] the sky he said that was shalom
[56:27] peace good morning changing of the
[56:30] Rhythm changing of the beat reading the
[56:31] sheet music now we've been through
[56:33] church ages Church ages Church ages but
[56:35] all of a sudden this marks a change in
[56:38] the symphony now it's time to play the
[56:41] next part
[56:43] and the next part amen is not the part
[56:46] of building a bride body the next part
[56:48] is the part of the marriage Union
[56:51] and that's the part we're living in the
[56:54] union the invisible Union of Christ and
[56:56] his bride the marriage is taking place
[56:58] now the union is taking place now that's
[57:01] the part we're playing not the church
[57:03] Ages part but this part
[57:05] what under the seventh seal
[57:09] and the message Christ is the mystery of
[57:11] God revealed he says God's great mystery
[57:12] of how it's a secret he kept it a secret
[57:15] nobody know nothing about it even the
[57:17] angels didn't understand it see he
[57:19] didn't reveal it that's the reason under
[57:21] our seventh mystery when the seven seal
[57:23] was opened there was silence
[57:25] I love this message of Christ is the
[57:27] mystery of God revealed like I said he
[57:28] couldn't preach it to the opening of the
[57:30] seventh seal
[57:31] but he's tying it together with the
[57:34] great mystery that even Jesus wouldn't
[57:36] reveal to his disciples
[57:38] and that's the mystery of his coming
[57:42] so there's a mystery of his coming that
[57:43] he wouldn't reveal to the disciples amen
[57:46] but now uh brother attaches that to the
[57:50] seventh seal
[57:53] that's the reason under our seventh
[57:55] mystery when the seventh seal was open
[57:56] there was silence Jesus when he was on
[57:58] Earth they wanted to know when he would
[57:59] come even the son himself don't know
[58:02] when it's going to happen see God has
[58:03] this all to himself it's a secret and
[58:06] that's the reason there was silence in
[58:07] heaven for the space of half an hour and
[58:10] seven Thunders out of their voices
[58:12] and John was forbidden to write see the
[58:14] coming of the Lord
[58:15] this is what brother Brown says Christ
[58:17] is the mystery of God revealed he says
[58:19] the reason there was silence in heaven
[58:20] for the space of half an hour
[58:22] is the same reason the seven Thunders
[58:25] uttered and John was told not to write
[58:27] see the coming of the Lord
[58:31] it's all connected to the seventh seal
[58:33] which is the coming of the Lord which is
[58:35] the ending of everything because it's
[58:36] now completion
[58:39] which is attached to the seventh seal
[58:41] which is attached to the silence in
[58:42] heaven for half an hour which is
[58:44] attached to the seven Thunders
[58:47] which is attached to the the message of
[58:49] the seventh angel which is the mystery
[58:52] of God being revealed
[58:56] all of these things are the same thing
[59:01] and John was even from bitten to write
[59:02] it see the coming of the Lord that's one
[59:05] thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he
[59:06] will come and when he will come it's a
[59:09] good thing that he doesn't it's a good
[59:11] thing that he doesn't know
[59:13] that's good he says it's a good thing
[59:15] that he doesn't he hasn't revealed yet
[59:18] it's a good thing that he doesn't next
[59:20] line he has showed it or revealed it in
[59:23] every type that's in the Bible
[59:26] amen this seventh seal won't be broke to
[59:29] the public but it doesn't mean it won't
[59:31] be broke to his bride
[59:34] amen he hasn't declared it he hasn't
[59:36] openly stated but he has showed it in
[59:38] every type that's in the Bible
[59:40] therefore the entire Bible is the
[59:42] revelation of God's mystery in Christ
[59:46] the mystery of God Christ is the mystery
[59:48] of God the entire Bible is the
[59:50] revelation of the seventh seal
[59:57] oh praise God
[59:59] the entire Bible is an expression of one
[1:00:02] goal that God had one purpose he wanted
[1:00:05] to achieve in the entire Bible and the
[1:00:07] acts of the Believers in the Bible has
[1:00:09] been in type and expressing what God's
[1:00:10] Great goal is and now in this last day
[1:00:13] he has revealed it and shows it
[1:00:16] in God's help well you'll see it right
[1:00:18] here this morning what the Lord has had
[1:00:20] in his mind all along and has expressed
[1:00:22] it
[1:00:23] so the seventh seal no he he hasn't told
[1:00:26] it
[1:00:27] but I hope you get it tonight
[1:00:30] I I hope you get it this morning
[1:00:33] he said I hope you get it amen because
[1:00:35] he's revealed it in every time and with
[1:00:36] God's help I hope you see it this
[1:00:38] morning
[1:00:40] what is this Christ is the mystery of
[1:00:41] God revealed this is the great mystery
[1:00:43] what God has had in his mind all along
[1:00:45] there's been a mystery of God Amen a
[1:00:48] mystery that he's held within himself
[1:00:49] that he has not revealed and he's sown
[1:00:51] seeds of it and and all of these things
[1:00:53] we can see he's displayed it in every
[1:00:55] time amen as this record of people come
[1:00:58] forward it's amazing the the the it's
[1:01:00] amazing the types and the shadows and
[1:01:03] all the things that he's expressing
[1:01:04] through the lives of his children
[1:01:06] all foreshadowing foreshadowing
[1:01:08] foreshadowing even all the way back in
[1:01:10] Eden he was foreshadowing what he had
[1:01:13] done amen was a snapshot a picture of
[1:01:15] what he wanted to achieve and then he
[1:01:17] allowed that snapshot to fall into ruin
[1:01:20] amen so that he could build it back so
[1:01:22] that he could fully Express his full
[1:01:24] nature as Redeemer and healer and savior
[1:01:26] because with no fall he's not a redeemer
[1:01:29] with no fault I mean he is a redeemer
[1:01:31] but he's not expressed as a redeemer He
[1:01:33] Is A Healer but without the fall he's
[1:01:34] not expressed as a Healer
[1:01:37] so now he expresses himself but in the
[1:01:40] end the culmination when the mystery of
[1:01:41] God is finished when he's done
[1:01:43] expressing himself and he's putting his
[1:01:45] attributes upon the Earth then under the
[1:01:47] seventh seal he'll finish the expression
[1:01:49] collect it all back together return it
[1:01:52] back to an Eden condition the Millennium
[1:01:54] he'll finish his Seventh-Day rest that
[1:01:56] was interrupted amen and let the Son of
[1:01:58] God Amen on the throne of David with his
[1:02:00] wife rule the Earth amen rule all of
[1:02:03] creation to complete the seventh day
[1:02:07] and then time will run out under the
[1:02:09] seventh seal and after time runs out
[1:02:11] then he'll Purge the Earth completely
[1:02:13] with Holy Fire and bring down new heaven
[1:02:16] bring down New Jerusalem into new
[1:02:17] heavens and a new Earth and then he will
[1:02:20] be himself a family upon the Earth the
[1:02:23] attributes of God Express fellowshipping
[1:02:25] together on a perfect Earth
[1:02:28] which is what he wanted from the
[1:02:29] beginning the mystery that he's held in
[1:02:31] his mind what he wanted to achieve was
[1:02:33] this fellowship with attribute to it
[1:02:35] understand him in all of his expression
[1:02:38] that would know him as a father would
[1:02:40] know him as the Holy Ghost would know
[1:02:41] him as a comforter would know him as a
[1:02:42] Healer would know him as a husband would
[1:02:44] know him in all of these attributes he
[1:02:46] would be fully known and then now in
[1:02:48] this great eternity God in his
[1:02:51] attributes his children would would have
[1:02:53] Fellowship together when Harmony and
[1:02:55] understanding in unity because
[1:02:58] of the mystery of redemption
[1:03:02] and this mystery was laying in the whole
[1:03:05] Bible
[1:03:06] but sealed under these Seven Seals
[1:03:09] and the seventh seal is The Silent One
[1:03:12] it's the
[1:03:15] it's the culmination it's the finishing
[1:03:18] it's the end time
[1:03:19] it's the finishing of time time Runs Out
[1:03:22] for denominational system times ran out
[1:03:25] on ages times run out
[1:03:27] why because he's bringing everything
[1:03:30] and Redemption to the end
[1:03:33] he brings the Gentile disposition to the
[1:03:35] end
[1:03:36] he restores the Jews as a nation
[1:03:39] amen he brings back a son and a dog a
[1:03:43] son and a son's wife to rule on the
[1:03:45] earth for a thousand years to complete
[1:03:46] the the rest
[1:03:48] then he purges it completely purges the
[1:03:51] Earth again completely
[1:03:53] and brings back Harmony and unity and
[1:03:55] Perfection upon the Earth what is the
[1:03:58] seven seal the completion
[1:04:00] of all things
[1:04:02] then we move into the eighth
[1:04:04] which is not eight it's one
[1:04:06] it's back to the beginning
[1:04:09] after seven you go back to what it was
[1:04:11] in its original intent in an original
[1:04:14] desire
[1:04:16] and this seventh seal these seals
[1:04:18] contain the mystery of redemption and
[1:04:20] the seventh seal contains the mystery of
[1:04:23] God which was the secret that he had in
[1:04:25] his mind and what he wanted to
[1:04:27] accomplish all along
[1:04:29] and now has been revealed
[1:04:32] to those who can receive it
[1:04:37] is it broke to the public no
[1:04:40] because only the elect can receive this
[1:04:42] revelation
[1:04:44] listen
[1:04:45] we can find people who can agree with it
[1:04:49] but that's not the same thing
[1:04:52] only elect can receive it
[1:04:56] it's not agreement
[1:04:57] but it's by faith it's a revelation
[1:05:04] he goes on to say
[1:05:07] what shall I do with this Jesus called
[1:05:09] Christ
[1:05:10] and this message at the end of 1963 says
[1:05:12] and who would dare to say that wasn't
[1:05:14] the inspired word of God when he
[1:05:16] foretold it here and sent it out
[1:05:17] yondered to Arizona and brought it right
[1:05:20] back even with science and everything
[1:05:21] else and proved it so the book is
[1:05:23] already opened
[1:05:26] the book is already open that's right
[1:05:28] just waiting for the seven seal to be
[1:05:31] identified of the coming of Christ
[1:05:34] it's already opened amen that's what the
[1:05:36] opening of the seals was about the book
[1:05:37] is open now he's waiting for the seventh
[1:05:40] seal to I to be identified of the coming
[1:05:42] of Christ he he wants the people to
[1:05:45] catch what it is
[1:05:47] it's got to be identified at the coming
[1:05:49] of Christ and that's what I want to talk
[1:05:50] about now now I'm going to get to this
[1:05:52] quote where we extracted our title out
[1:05:55] of the message Souls that are in prison
[1:05:57] now
[1:05:58] and in this message souls are in prison
[1:06:00] now brother Branham is struggling within
[1:06:02] himself you can hear him through the
[1:06:03] entire duration of the message because
[1:06:05] he knows that the lamb took the book
[1:06:08] he knows that the seals are open he
[1:06:10] knows it
[1:06:11] it's not a doubt in his mind and what
[1:06:13] he's dealing with in souls in prison now
[1:06:15] he's dealing with the implications of
[1:06:17] that truth
[1:06:18] he's saying is the third pool like when
[1:06:21] Jesus went down to the souls that were
[1:06:23] in prison and preached to them amen they
[1:06:26] were lost there was no hope for
[1:06:27] Redemption but he went and told them I'm
[1:06:30] the one Noah spoke of I'm the one
[1:06:31] Abraham was declaring to you and you've
[1:06:33] rejected it and now you're doomed amen
[1:06:35] and brothers is questioning is that what
[1:06:38] we're doing now now that the Seven Seals
[1:06:40] have been open they meant now that the
[1:06:42] lamb has taken the book is there no more
[1:06:44] Mercy is there no more amen is there no
[1:06:47] more Mercy because is it all over is
[1:06:49] everything sealed to sealed and it's all
[1:06:51] over and nobody else can be saved
[1:06:53] this is what he's struggling with
[1:06:57] this is what he's preaching in souls are
[1:06:59] in prison now why is he struggling he's
[1:07:01] struggling because he knows the lamb
[1:07:03] took the book
[1:07:04] if he doesn't know the lamb took the
[1:07:06] book and opened all Seven Seals there's
[1:07:08] nothing to struggle about
[1:07:09] the struggle shows the faith of the
[1:07:12] Prophet that he knows that the lamb has
[1:07:14] taken the book and opened the seals
[1:07:18] and now he's wondering if the third pool
[1:07:20] is a Ministry to the totally lost
[1:07:26] and he says not by speaking in tongues
[1:07:29] not by dancing in the spirit not by
[1:07:31] joining church not by the fruit of the
[1:07:33] spirit Christian Science can outsmother
[1:07:34] any of you on that see and deny even
[1:07:37] Jesus Christ was divine not that but
[1:07:39] it's the word living
[1:07:42] there it is if they had only looked he
[1:07:44] was Messiah he was the Living Word made
[1:07:47] manifest
[1:07:48] and a man that's got the spirit of God
[1:07:50] in him or a woman lives that word lives
[1:07:52] right out in them that's the heartbeat
[1:07:55] the predestinated for the word of the
[1:07:57] Lord comes to them and they are the word
[1:07:59] to the people written Epistles read of
[1:08:01] all men is that right could the third
[1:08:03] pull be on
[1:08:06] tape people that's listening to the tape
[1:08:08] I wish you could look at this
[1:08:10] congregation at this time I hope you're
[1:08:12] feeling the same way what if it is look
[1:08:14] at the scriptures piling in here brother
[1:08:17] I'm showing so many scriptures this
[1:08:19] shows it's the end
[1:08:21] It's The End
[1:08:23] could it be is the third pool to preach
[1:08:25] to the Eternal Doom that's rejected the
[1:08:27] message of salvation
[1:08:29] will you say the church is going yeah
[1:08:30] they will they'll go right on just the
[1:08:32] same but remember all this time Noah was
[1:08:35] in the ark the bride is sealed in with
[1:08:38] Christ the last member has been redeemed
[1:08:40] The Sixth Seal has produced itself the
[1:08:42] seventh seal brings him back to Earth
[1:08:45] the lamb come and took the book out of
[1:08:47] the right hand of him that sat and
[1:08:49] claimed that he owned and what he had
[1:08:51] redeemed that's right it's always been
[1:08:53] that third pool three is perfection the
[1:08:56] ministry come to its Perfection when it
[1:08:58] reproduced Christ again in natural
[1:09:00] amongst human beings as was predicted as
[1:09:04] it was in the days of lot
[1:09:06] now I'm going to break this down a
[1:09:08] little bit brother man I'm saying are we
[1:09:10] here are we at the end of everything is
[1:09:12] it all over and there's no more home and
[1:09:14] I believe later he begins to show amen
[1:09:16] that there still is Mercy but Mercy is
[1:09:18] found only in Christ and Christ is the
[1:09:20] word that was revealed Mercy is no more
[1:09:23] found in systems and denominations and
[1:09:25] church systems and in church ages amen
[1:09:28] but now it is found in Christ because
[1:09:29] Christ the message is the ark amen and
[1:09:32] remember Before Destruction set in Noah
[1:09:34] was already sealed in the ark amen and
[1:09:36] the bride is sealed in Christ
[1:09:39] before the destruction Falls
[1:09:43] amen
[1:09:46] the sixth steel has produced itself amen
[1:09:48] the six seal is already opened amen the
[1:09:51] six brothers showed that the 60 opened
[1:09:53] the same time the six by was poured out
[1:09:55] and tied it to they were tied it to
[1:09:57] World War II in the releasing of the
[1:09:59] demons out of the river Euphrates
[1:10:02] amen but showing that was an amateur
[1:10:04] form that it's going to come to its
[1:10:06] fullness later and the Great Tribulation
[1:10:08] period but it's already opened
[1:10:12] and he says the seventh seal brings him
[1:10:14] back to Earth
[1:10:17] the lamb come and took the book
[1:10:20] then he says the ministry come to its
[1:10:22] Perfection when he's speaking of his own
[1:10:25] Ministry now the ministry of Christ in
[1:10:27] him
[1:10:28] the ministry come to its Perfection when
[1:10:30] it reproduced Christ again in natural
[1:10:33] amongst human beings
[1:10:36] as was redicted as it was in the days of
[1:10:39] lot
[1:10:40] the third poll on brother benham's
[1:10:42] Ministry
[1:10:43] amen when he was a son of man revealing
[1:10:46] this
[1:10:49] when the ministry come to Perfection
[1:10:51] when it reproduced Christ again in the
[1:10:54] natural amongst human beings
[1:11:03] and the seventh seal brings him back to
[1:11:05] Earth
[1:11:06] it's amazing how we can make a statement
[1:11:08] like that the seven seal brings him back
[1:11:10] to Earth
[1:11:11] and immediately through thousands of
[1:11:14] years of denominational teaching
[1:11:17] we automatically picture Jesus in flesh
[1:11:21] with nail prints coming and standing
[1:11:23] upon the Earth
[1:11:26] immediately our minds will go there's so
[1:11:28] much imagery from from books and from
[1:11:31] denominational teaching and all of that
[1:11:33] comes and we believe that's coming but
[1:11:35] that won't come until the Millennium
[1:11:37] till he comes the son of David his feet
[1:11:39] won't touch the Earth and this Gentile
[1:11:41] dispensation we'll meet him in the air
[1:11:45] so the coming of the Lord is not Jesus
[1:11:47] coming and standing on the earth and the
[1:11:49] flesh body that was crucified
[1:11:53] but the Gentile form the coming of the
[1:11:55] Lord will still come
[1:11:57] and he's coming to take his bride away
[1:11:59] and we'll we'll be translated and meet
[1:12:01] that body in the air
[1:12:04] but he's coming to lead us back home
[1:12:07] he's come to take us there
[1:12:10] how did he come he come as the mighty
[1:12:12] angel
[1:12:13] it didn't say his flesh Revelation 10 1
[1:12:15] didn't say especially come as the mighty
[1:12:17] Angel The Covenant angel
[1:12:19] the angel of the Covenant descended with
[1:12:21] an open book in his hand
[1:12:23] and when he descended with an open book
[1:12:25] in his hands seven Thunders uttered
[1:12:26] their voices
[1:12:27] and that's what happened in the
[1:12:29] preaching of the seals
[1:12:31] and so now he says
[1:12:33] the ministry come to Perfection when it
[1:12:35] reproduced Christ again in natural
[1:12:37] amongst human beings as was predicted
[1:12:40] as it was in the days of law
[1:12:43] he goes on to say in the message crisis
[1:12:45] the mystery of God revealed he says and
[1:12:48] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[1:12:50] it be in the coming of the son of man
[1:12:52] and as the days of lot when a modern
[1:12:54] Billy Graham Oral Roberts went down into
[1:12:56] Sodom and preached to the sodomites and
[1:12:58] blinded their eyes see with the gospel
[1:13:00] and the angel stayed back a messenger
[1:13:02] with Abraham in the elected group and
[1:13:04] what kind of sign did he do see what did
[1:13:06] Abraham call him Elohim God manifested
[1:13:09] in flesh
[1:13:11] Jesus showing that he himself God in him
[1:13:13] will be manifested in his bride in the
[1:13:16] last days
[1:13:19] so
[1:13:22] let's go to Genesis chapter 18. let's
[1:13:24] just look at this in Genesis chapter 18.
[1:13:31] brother Branham is showing
[1:13:34] that the sign of the end time
[1:13:36] is what Jesus says but as it was in the
[1:13:39] days of Noah as it was in the days of
[1:13:40] lot
[1:13:42] so he goes to show us what's going on in
[1:13:44] the days of Noah and in the days of Law
[1:13:45] and in the days of lot it was in the
[1:13:48] world was in a Sodom condition and in in
[1:13:50] the days of lot amen there also was one
[1:13:53] who came and visited Abraham in the days
[1:13:55] of lot
[1:13:56] and brother Branham starts to show that
[1:13:58] there was three that came amen one
[1:14:01] Abraham called Lord but the other two
[1:14:03] angels went down into Sodom and he and
[1:14:05] he he actually tells you who they were
[1:14:07] it was Billy Graham and Oral Roberts
[1:14:11] so brother Ren was not pointing this to
[1:14:13] the Future this is past
[1:14:16] he's preaching in his present tense
[1:14:18] truth
[1:14:20] he said Elohim God was manifested in his
[1:14:23] flesh Jesus showing that he himself gone
[1:14:26] in and would be manifest in his bride in
[1:14:27] the last days and we look at this in in
[1:14:30] Genesis 18 verse 1.
[1:14:33] and the Lord appeared unto him in the
[1:14:35] planes of memory
[1:14:36] this is Jehovah
[1:14:39] a self-existing one who reveals himself
[1:14:42] and the Lord appeared unto him in the
[1:14:44] planes of memory and he sat in the tent
[1:14:45] and Door In the Heat of the day and he
[1:14:47] lifted up his eyes and looked and loathe
[1:14:48] three men stood by him and when he saw
[1:14:50] them he ran to meet them from the tent
[1:14:52] door and bowed himself toward the ground
[1:14:54] he said my Lord if if now I have found
[1:14:57] favor in thy sight pass not away I pray
[1:14:59] thee from thy servant
[1:15:02] that a little water I pray thee be
[1:15:04] fetched and wash your feet and rest
[1:15:05] yourselves under the tree
[1:15:08] so Abraham comes and calls him my Lord
[1:15:10] and then we go down to when when this
[1:15:13] Angel begins to speak
[1:15:16] now we know that that he eats the calf
[1:15:19] he drinks the milk he eats the butter
[1:15:22] he's in flesh
[1:15:24] but this is Jehovah according to the
[1:15:26] word
[1:15:27] but he's in flesh and he's eating
[1:15:30] so it's Jehovah and flesh
[1:15:34] and then he begins to speak
[1:15:36] and they said unto him where is Sarah
[1:15:39] thy wife and he said behold in the tent
[1:15:41] and he said I will certainly return unto
[1:15:43] thee according to the time of life and
[1:15:45] lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[1:15:47] Sarah heard it in the tent door and the
[1:15:50] tent door which was behind him so well
[1:15:52] where was Sarah in the tent door and
[1:15:54] where was the tent door behind him
[1:15:57] so he had his back
[1:15:59] this Jehovah that was in flesh
[1:16:02] with dust on his clothes eating
[1:16:05] behind him was Sarah
[1:16:08] he says now Abraham and Sarah were old
[1:16:11] and well stricken in age and it ceased
[1:16:12] to be with Sarah after the manner of
[1:16:14] women therefore Sarah laughed within
[1:16:16] herself saying after I am waxed old
[1:16:18] shall I have pleasure my Lord being also
[1:16:20] old also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[1:16:23] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[1:16:25] have Surety bear a child which him own
[1:16:27] is anything too hard for the Lord at the
[1:16:29] time appointed I will return unto thee
[1:16:32] according to the time of life and Sarah
[1:16:34] shall have a son
[1:16:36] then Sarah denied saying I laughed not
[1:16:38] for she was afraid and he said nay but
[1:16:40] thou did laugh
[1:16:44] we see brother Ben refers back to this
[1:16:46] over and over again
[1:16:48] and and his reference to this he's
[1:16:51] trying to get us to see the day we're
[1:16:54] living in
[1:16:56] he he will so much so that at the end of
[1:17:00] his service he will turn his back to the
[1:17:02] audience and begin to call out people
[1:17:04] and he'll reference this he'll explain
[1:17:06] this story and say she was in the tent
[1:17:08] or behind him and he knew the thoughts
[1:17:10] of her heart and he declared them amen
[1:17:12] when when when when when she was in the
[1:17:14] tent behind him and brother man will
[1:17:15] turn his back to the congregation begin
[1:17:17] to call people you in the balcony you
[1:17:19] were there with a red dress and the
[1:17:21] yellow and this and that and it would be
[1:17:23] exactly what he said and what's he
[1:17:24] trying to show he's trying to show amen
[1:17:27] that this is the ministry of Christ
[1:17:28] recreated in flesh Christ in flesh again
[1:17:32] a man with dust on his clothes who can
[1:17:35] eat amen could eat enough flesh but it
[1:17:37] was God in that flesh amen the flesh
[1:17:41] wasn't God it was God In the Flesh and
[1:17:43] here brother Branham is a flesh man but
[1:17:45] he's a son of man revealing this on a
[1:17:48] man the son of man is Jesus Christ
[1:17:50] himself and he was working brother
[1:17:52] Branham as a human being could no more
[1:17:54] know who was behind him and what their
[1:17:56] ailment wasn't what their name was that
[1:17:58] wasn't the man that was Jesus Christ
[1:18:00] working through that flesh
[1:18:03] which takes us right back to Genesis 18.
[1:18:06] because at the time there's a man doing
[1:18:08] that to the Royal seed that
[1:18:10] predestinated there's two other Angels
[1:18:12] going and smiting blind Sodom and he
[1:18:15] says preaching the gospel smites them
[1:18:17] blind because they get a dose of the
[1:18:19] Gospel but they don't get the true
[1:18:20] Revelation and they're blinded
[1:18:25] amen
[1:18:27] yep so this has happened yeah
[1:18:30] yeah this has already happened this is
[1:18:31] where we are
[1:18:35] let's look at the prophecy in Luke
[1:18:37] chapter 17.
[1:18:47] Luke chapter 17.
[1:18:58] Luke 17 verse 26.
[1:19:05] and as it was in the days of Noah so
[1:19:08] shall it be also in the days of the son
[1:19:10] of man
[1:19:11] they did eat they drank they married
[1:19:13] wives they were given and married until
[1:19:14] the day that Noah entered the Ark and
[1:19:16] the flood came and destroyed them all
[1:19:18] likewise also as it was in the days of
[1:19:21] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[1:19:22] they sold they planted they builded but
[1:19:25] the same day that lot went out of Sodom
[1:19:27] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:19:29] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[1:19:31] it be in the day when the son of man is
[1:19:34] revealed
[1:19:36] what was the ministry of William Branham
[1:19:38] it was the revealing of the son of man
[1:19:41] it was revealing that Jesus Christ was
[1:19:44] present
[1:19:46] he knew your name
[1:19:47] your ailment where you came from what
[1:19:49] you were struggling with
[1:19:51] and he was there to deliver
[1:19:54] so in the days of lot that was the Sodom
[1:19:59] you see what happened in the days of lot
[1:20:01] we've seen it repeat in this generation
[1:20:04] and there was a prophet on the scene to
[1:20:06] say this is that
[1:20:07] and this is that and this is that
[1:20:10] so here we are
[1:20:14] but
[1:20:17] when we look at this now actually I want
[1:20:19] to look at one more Matthew 24 let's go
[1:20:21] to Matthew 24.
[1:20:24] because brother Ram ties these two
[1:20:25] statements together to the same prophecy
[1:20:27] they're just worded slightly different
[1:20:28] in two different places
[1:20:30] Matthew 24 36.
[1:20:36] it says but of that day and hour knoweth
[1:20:38] no man
[1:20:39] no not the angels of heaven but my
[1:20:41] father only stop right there
[1:20:45] brother random referred to this when we
[1:20:47] read crisis mystery God reveal Nobody
[1:20:48] Knows the day or hour of Us coming
[1:20:51] that's the question
[1:20:52] and Jesus answered and said but of that
[1:20:54] day and hour knoweth no man no not the
[1:20:57] angels of heaven but my father only he
[1:21:00] said nobody knows the day or hour only
[1:21:02] my father
[1:21:03] but look at what he says next
[1:21:06] but as the days of Noah were so shall
[1:21:09] also the coming of the son of man be
[1:21:12] he said nobody knows the day of our but
[1:21:16] but
[1:21:18] if you have spiritual ears ears to hear
[1:21:21] it'll be like it was in the days of Noah
[1:21:24] it'll be like it was in the days of lot
[1:21:26] when you see the days of knowing you see
[1:21:28] the days of lot repeating hey we're here
[1:21:31] no man knows a day of our but I'll give
[1:21:33] you a clue I can't give you the whole
[1:21:35] thing I can't declare it openly it must
[1:21:37] still be a mystery but I'll give you a
[1:21:39] clue this is exactly what the prophet
[1:21:41] did when he came to Christ the mystery
[1:21:43] of God revealed he said nobody knows
[1:21:45] that god holds this mystery only to
[1:21:46] himself amen it's a good thing he
[1:21:48] doesn't know but he has revealed it and
[1:21:51] showed it in every type that's in the
[1:21:52] Bible if you'll pay attention like it
[1:21:54] was in the days of Noah like it was in
[1:21:56] Sodom like it was in the days of lot
[1:21:59] what's he doing brother bantam's coming
[1:22:01] and preaching exactly the way Jesus is
[1:22:03] preaching concerning this question
[1:22:08] because he was a word Prophet because it
[1:22:11] was Christ in him it was a Ministry of
[1:22:13] Jesus Christ not a Ministry of a man and
[1:22:16] he's repeating the same thing and nobody
[1:22:18] knows a day or hour it's glad he he's
[1:22:20] not revealed it's not open to the public
[1:22:22] it's not any of that but
[1:22:24] it's laying open in every type that's in
[1:22:27] the Bible amen and I hope with God's
[1:22:29] help you'll see it here this morning
[1:22:33] but as it was in the day of Noah
[1:22:37] so shall also the coming of the son of
[1:22:40] man be
[1:22:41] not just the revealing but the revealing
[1:22:43] and the coming are together
[1:22:46] for as in the days that were before the
[1:22:48] flood they were eating and drinking Mary
[1:22:50] and giving and marriage until the day
[1:22:51] that Noah entered into the ark
[1:22:54] and knew not until the flood came and
[1:22:56] took them all away so shall also the
[1:22:58] coming of the son of man be
[1:23:01] so now we see
[1:23:03] that we see the indications of the time
[1:23:06] of his coming
[1:23:08] and you know when Noah went into the ark
[1:23:11] he was sealed into the ark before the
[1:23:13] destruction came
[1:23:15] and the bride is sealed into Christ
[1:23:17] Before Destruction came
[1:23:20] and this message is Christ it's the word
[1:23:22] it's the revealed word of God which is
[1:23:26] Christ
[1:23:27] and this message is our Ark and we are
[1:23:30] sealed into Christ
[1:23:33] by the word sealed into Christ come into
[1:23:35] an invisible Union as a bridegroom and
[1:23:38] bride sealed into him before the
[1:23:40] destruction comes
[1:23:41] and everybody else for those days that
[1:23:44] Noah was sealed in the ark they
[1:23:46] continued to marry and give in marriage
[1:23:48] and buy and build and sell and have
[1:23:50] church services and alter calls and
[1:23:52] everything else they were doing but Noah
[1:23:54] was already sealed in the ark and the
[1:23:56] bride is now sealed in Christ
[1:23:59] and all around this Ark the same things
[1:24:02] are going on
[1:24:05] praise God
[1:24:07] it's repeating
[1:24:10] so
[1:24:11] what's interesting to me is now in this
[1:24:16] Genesis 18.
[1:24:18] what was Elohim coming for
[1:24:22] Elohim was coming down
[1:24:24] it was God coming down to reveal himself
[1:24:27] through flesh
[1:24:30] and and to give an indication that it
[1:24:33] was God and to show when we would
[1:24:34] recognize when he come again amen he
[1:24:37] would have his back turned to Sarah and
[1:24:39] he would discern the thoughts of her
[1:24:40] heart
[1:24:41] giving us a key indication so we would
[1:24:44] recognize here we are again
[1:24:46] at the same time
[1:24:48] two are going down to solve them
[1:24:52] and so at that time why did Elohim come
[1:24:56] what was the purpose of Elohim coming
[1:24:58] Elohim was coming down to confirm a
[1:25:01] promise he had made
[1:25:03] he was coming on the scene to confirm a
[1:25:05] promise and in that promise is that
[1:25:08] Abraham would have a son
[1:25:10] and that that son would come through
[1:25:12] Sarah and Sarah was part of Abraham
[1:25:17] and so he came down
[1:25:20] to
[1:25:22] culminate
[1:25:24] finish complete the promise
[1:25:28] he came down for the seventh seal
[1:25:32] he came down to initiate the end time
[1:25:35] which would be the end of this prophecy
[1:25:37] the End of This Promise the end that you
[1:25:40] shall have a son and by Sarah you shall
[1:25:41] have a son he came down Amen to finish
[1:25:45] the prophecy he came down to complete
[1:25:47] the prophecy he came down in the mystery
[1:25:50] of the seventh seal
[1:25:52] and in that mystery he would speak and
[1:25:55] in speaking he would restore back
[1:25:57] Abraham's seed he reached over back what
[1:25:59] the word do the elect and he would
[1:26:01] restore back the womb
[1:26:03] so that the word could come to the womb
[1:26:10] what happened in this end time ministry
[1:26:12] of the seventh angel amen the son of man
[1:26:15] returned amen it was the recumbing of
[1:26:17] the son of man Jesus Christ himself was
[1:26:19] here to finish the promise that he had
[1:26:22] made amen and that promise was he was
[1:26:24] going to restore all that was lost and
[1:26:26] he came down and in coming down He
[1:26:28] restored the word amen and brother bam
[1:26:30] says the word had been laying as if it
[1:26:32] was dead been laying amen but now has
[1:26:35] been resurrected how is it resurrected
[1:26:37] because the chains were taken off the
[1:26:39] denominational misunderstandings the
[1:26:41] ideas of men were ruined it was holding
[1:26:43] it back the Holy Ghost had been bound
[1:26:45] for nearly 2 000 years
[1:26:48] man
[1:26:49] but it's been loosed in the evening time
[1:26:51] the Holy Ghost back on the people
[1:26:54] so now brought back the word to full
[1:26:57] expression the full Revelation and
[1:27:00] restored a womb
[1:27:02] a bride to receive that word
[1:27:06] to do what
[1:27:08] to produce the promise of the age
[1:27:11] which was a son
[1:27:13] the promised son to come into
[1:27:16] manifestation
[1:27:18] that's what all this happened for that's
[1:27:20] why he came down he came down to fulfill
[1:27:23] his promise he came down to speak the
[1:27:25] word he came down to reposition
[1:27:27] everything
[1:27:29] so that the seed
[1:27:31] remember in Abraham it was dried up
[1:27:33] to restore the seed to restore the womb
[1:27:37] so the seed could come to the womb
[1:27:40] to reproduce
[1:27:42] the Sun
[1:27:45] why did the ministry of William Branham
[1:27:47] come for the same reason
[1:27:53] and the message proving his word
[1:27:56] 1964 it's August of 64. he says now we
[1:28:00] say he's raised from the dead I didn't
[1:28:02] say it the word here said it he raised
[1:28:04] from the dead he says he's the same
[1:28:06] yesterday and forever you believe that
[1:28:08] he promised these things to happen in
[1:28:10] the last day that the same son of man
[1:28:12] will be made manifest
[1:28:15] now remember that was not Jesus talking
[1:28:17] to Abraham there that could discern the
[1:28:18] thoughts and Sarah's mind behind him
[1:28:20] that was not Jesus he had not yet been
[1:28:22] born but it was a man in human flesh
[1:28:24] that Abraham called Elohim the great
[1:28:26] Almighty showing and Jesus said as it
[1:28:29] was in the days of Sodom now watch close
[1:28:31] in the days of Sodom so will it be at
[1:28:33] the coming of the son of man when the
[1:28:35] son of man is being revealed
[1:28:38] so at the coming of the son of man is
[1:28:39] when the son of man is revealed
[1:28:42] not no more as a church see not no more
[1:28:45] the bride is called see in that day the
[1:28:49] son of man will be revealed what to join
[1:28:51] the church to the Head unite the
[1:28:54] marriage of the Bride so what did he
[1:28:56] come for what was the purpose of the
[1:28:58] coming of the son of man and why was he
[1:29:00] demonstrating himself through a son of
[1:29:02] man the purpose was to unite the body
[1:29:04] and the head together as a unit in an
[1:29:07] invisible Union
[1:29:08] brother man said that God showed him
[1:29:10] that his ministry was Eliezer fetching a
[1:29:12] bride for Isaac and Eliezer brought the
[1:29:14] bride all the way to Isaac
[1:29:18] praise God
[1:29:21] amen so
[1:29:23] the bridegroom call will come right
[1:29:26] through this when the son of man will
[1:29:28] come down and come in human flesh to
[1:29:31] unite the two together
[1:29:33] have we seen it did the son of man come
[1:29:35] down through human flesh and show the
[1:29:38] sign of the Messiah
[1:29:40] knowing the thoughts and intents of the
[1:29:42] heart amen
[1:29:44] to do what to unite the two together
[1:29:47] the church has to be the word he is the
[1:29:49] word and the two unites together to do
[1:29:51] that it'll take the manifestation of the
[1:29:53] revealing of the son of man not a clergy
[1:29:56] man I don't know I do you see what I
[1:29:58] mean it's not a man Jesus Christ will
[1:30:01] come down in human flesh Among Us and
[1:30:04] will make his word so real that it'll
[1:30:06] unite the church and him as one the
[1:30:08] bride and then shall go home to the
[1:30:10] wedding supper
[1:30:12] so where are we at in the timeline amen
[1:30:15] the son of man has been revealed in
[1:30:17] flesh amen we've we've had we've had a
[1:30:20] replay of Genesis 18 and he's come down
[1:30:23] and spoke the promise now is the season
[1:30:25] for fulfillment now the seventh seal is
[1:30:28] in full motion now is the time of
[1:30:30] restoration back the church is coming
[1:30:32] back to its original condition the words
[1:30:33] coming back to its original revelation
[1:30:36] to unite together to bring forth what
[1:30:39] the revelation of Jesus Christ The
[1:30:41] Promised son
[1:30:42] [Music]
[1:30:45] now where are we at we're in the uniting
[1:30:47] time
[1:30:52] and when she'll go home to the wedding
[1:30:53] supper amen she's already United see we
[1:30:56] go to the wedding supper not to the
[1:30:58] marriage the marriage is taking place
[1:31:00] now
[1:31:03] he quotes a scripture he says fill your
[1:31:05] self on the Flesh of Mighty Men because
[1:31:07] the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:31:09] but the Rapture is going to the wedding
[1:31:11] supper when the word here unites with
[1:31:13] the person and day two become one and
[1:31:16] then what does it do then
[1:31:20] the whole point was was to to bring back
[1:31:23] Jesus Christ to bring back the word that
[1:31:26] had been separated from the People by
[1:31:28] denominationalism
[1:31:30] and in bringing back the full measure of
[1:31:32] the word bringing back Christ Christ
[1:31:34] showed himself present amen
[1:31:37] and He restored a bride back to what she
[1:31:40] should have been in her original
[1:31:41] condition at the day of Pentecost before
[1:31:44] the fall before denomination before
[1:31:46] creeds
[1:31:49] to do what to unite to do two together
[1:31:53] to become one and then what does it do
[1:31:56] in this Union in this Union the
[1:31:59] invisible Union then what does this
[1:32:01] Union do
[1:32:03] it manifests the son of man again
[1:32:07] it wasn't left just in William Branham
[1:32:10] but now Christ is to be revealed through
[1:32:12] his body
[1:32:14] after the union has taken place
[1:32:17] it manifests the son of man again not
[1:32:20] the church theologians the son of man
[1:32:21] the word and the church becomes one
[1:32:24] whatever the son of man done he was the
[1:32:26] word the church does the same thing
[1:32:29] what did this great scene in the plans
[1:32:31] of memory that's repeated in our day
[1:32:33] what was it for why have we seen the
[1:32:35] days of lot the days of Noah what is the
[1:32:37] son of man come for he's come down to
[1:32:39] fetch a bride he's come down to claim
[1:32:41] what he's redeemed which is his bride
[1:32:43] and in claiming her he possesses her and
[1:32:45] he takes her unto himself the union the
[1:32:47] marriage is now to do what to reproduce
[1:32:50] his life again Adam was given a bride to
[1:32:53] reproduce himself Christ has given a
[1:32:55] bride to do the same thing but before he
[1:32:57] could come to her to reproduce himself
[1:32:59] she was already fallen in the first
[1:33:00] church age and she stayed Fallen but he
[1:33:02] was working his Plan of Redemption to
[1:33:04] bring a bride back to her virgin
[1:33:06] condition Virgin by the word
[1:33:10] it took a perfect virgin word restored
[1:33:12] to bring the virginity back to the bride
[1:33:15] washed away from man's Creeds man's
[1:33:17] ideas but a pure word restored to bring
[1:33:20] her back to her virgin condition to do
[1:33:22] what to unite the word in her as one to
[1:33:24] do what to reproduce the son of man
[1:33:27] again
[1:33:29] through where
[1:33:31] through her
[1:33:37] through where I'll say it this way
[1:33:39] through me
[1:33:42] this is where the Revelation is coming
[1:33:43] to
[1:33:45] where is this Revelation coming to why
[1:33:48] did God let me see the manifestation of
[1:33:51] the son of man
[1:33:53] others saw it and called it beelzebug
[1:33:55] others saw it and walked away others saw
[1:33:57] and said this false prophecy but why in
[1:34:00] my heart I knew it was true amen because
[1:34:02] he came to me he only this only came to
[1:34:05] the Royal Seed of Abraham amen the other
[1:34:07] Messengers went to the rest of the
[1:34:09] denominational systems but this
[1:34:11] messenger which was Jehovah himself
[1:34:13] which is Jesus Christ the son of man in
[1:34:16] a body of Flesh he only came to speak
[1:34:19] something to the elect
[1:34:22] why did God let me stay when others
[1:34:24] walked away God why did God give me a
[1:34:26] heart to believe and to perceive what he
[1:34:28] was saying when others called it
[1:34:30] confusion and left why because the
[1:34:32] message is for me the message that came
[1:34:34] through that manifestation was for me
[1:34:36] and he says I will restore your time of
[1:34:39] life I will bring you back Amen to a
[1:34:42] virgin condition to youthfulness as a
[1:34:44] bride to where you can receive the seed
[1:34:46] and bring forth life again
[1:34:49] that's why I heard it because I was
[1:34:51] predestinated to hear it I was always
[1:34:53] part of that Royal Sea
[1:34:57] and now I have been predestinated like
[1:34:59] Sarah was predestinated Sarah thought
[1:35:01] she's too old she thought I can't do it
[1:35:03] I can't produce a wound so she came up
[1:35:05] with another plan and started the whole
[1:35:07] system of churches by using intellect
[1:35:09] and reasoning and saying take haggar
[1:35:11] amen haggar will bring up a child for me
[1:35:13] this is reasonable it's lawful it makes
[1:35:15] sense and she started the whole
[1:35:17] denominational thing
[1:35:21] but that failed and was separated out
[1:35:23] amen and she had to come to the
[1:35:25] realization it's not anybody else this
[1:35:27] is going to happen through me amen I'm
[1:35:29] the one I'm promised why because she was
[1:35:32] the one who was part of Abraham Hagar
[1:35:34] wasn't part of Abraham wasn't his law
[1:35:36] for why but she and Abraham were one
[1:35:38] flesh
[1:35:40] she was Mrs Abraham
[1:35:42] and so the promise was for Abraham out
[1:35:46] of your loins from you amen and Hagar
[1:35:49] wasn't Abraham but Sarah was
[1:35:52] Sarah was Abraham
[1:35:54] in female form
[1:35:57] so now the promise had to come through
[1:35:59] Abraham
[1:36:00] so it could only come through Sarah so
[1:36:02] Sarah had to be restored to produce the
[1:36:04] Sun
[1:36:06] why do we hear this message because this
[1:36:08] message
[1:36:09] is the revelation of the seventh seal to
[1:36:11] you
[1:36:12] to unlock the mystery of God so that you
[1:36:15] would know it's not a mystery anymore to
[1:36:17] the bride it's a secret
[1:36:22] it's not a mystery it's a mystery to the
[1:36:24] world it's a secret to the bride
[1:36:26] because God has revealed what was in the
[1:36:29] his secret
[1:36:30] the back part of his mind and he's
[1:36:32] whispered love secrets to his wife
[1:36:36] why so that she could have faith
[1:36:41] why Hebrews 11 said let's go to Hebrews
[1:36:44] 11. Hebrews 11.
[1:36:49] I love this word friend the message came
[1:36:52] to bring an identification so we
[1:36:54] wouldn't be stuck in this confusion not
[1:36:56] knowing who we are or where truth was it
[1:36:58] came to establish us why because if we
[1:37:00] don't have faith we cannot be who we
[1:37:02] were called to be and God wants a
[1:37:04] manifestation in this hour and to have
[1:37:05] that manifestation he needs your body
[1:37:08] so God had to bring something that would
[1:37:10] lift your faith out of the carnal into
[1:37:13] the supernatural where all things are
[1:37:15] possible so that he could use your body
[1:37:16] to finish his work
[1:37:18] so God had to bring a revelation in the
[1:37:21] hour that would lift us up out of
[1:37:23] laodicea Lift us up out of carnal so
[1:37:25] that we could see who we really were
[1:37:27] when the back part of God's mind where
[1:37:29] we were in Residence before we came here
[1:37:38] now remember
[1:37:41] Sarah was turned back Young
[1:37:44] but remember that she woke up in the
[1:37:45] morning and they were shocked looked in
[1:37:47] the mirror she screamed he dramatizes
[1:37:50] they returned back young amen then
[1:37:51] there's a little trouble in the land
[1:37:53] they go down to qurar and a baby like
[1:37:54] the king of garage he wants to take her
[1:37:58] at 80 years old and make her his his
[1:38:00] wife because she's a beautiful virgin
[1:38:03] the scripture is giving us an indication
[1:38:05] Something's Happened to this woman why
[1:38:08] does the king of Gerard who could have
[1:38:09] any virgin he wants one an 80 year old
[1:38:12] woman
[1:38:14] because she had been turned back Young
[1:38:16] but just because she was brought back to
[1:38:19] Virgin condition
[1:38:21] did not mean she would conceive seed
[1:38:23] because in her original virgin condition
[1:38:26] she could not conceive seed
[1:38:28] she had been married for years but I
[1:38:31] said possibly since she was 16 years of
[1:38:32] age amen and she had never conceived she
[1:38:35] needed something more than just be
[1:38:37] brought back to Virgin condition
[1:38:39] she needed to conceive seed
[1:38:43] and all the time through Genesis Genesis
[1:38:47] we have God coming to Abraham God
[1:38:49] speaking Abraham God coming to Abraham
[1:38:50] God coming to Abraham God coming to
[1:38:52] Abraham but then God says I will visit
[1:38:54] you according to the time of life I will
[1:38:56] visit you he says I will visit you
[1:38:57] according to the time of life and that
[1:38:59] visitation shows up later in Genesis and
[1:39:03] in Genesis he says and the Lord
[1:39:06] visited Sarah
[1:39:10] this time it wasn't Abraham it was it
[1:39:12] was Abe it was Mrs Abraham because
[1:39:15] that's who needed the visitation for
[1:39:17] this manifestation
[1:39:19] but he told Abraham I'll visit you
[1:39:21] because she was part of Abraham she was
[1:39:23] Abraham she was the part that was going
[1:39:25] to bring forth the promised son that
[1:39:27] came out of Abraham so he says I will
[1:39:30] visit you in that visitation is the
[1:39:32] seventh seal it's the secret because we
[1:39:35] don't know the conversation we don't
[1:39:36] know what the Lord said we don't know
[1:39:38] anything it just says he visited Sarah
[1:39:40] and Sarah conceived
[1:39:46] that's the hour we're living in that's
[1:39:48] what's happening to you and I
[1:39:51] and the Mystery of the seventh seal and
[1:39:53] the silent in the little room in the
[1:39:55] place where nobody can explain what's
[1:39:56] going on Amen he's visiting you who are
[1:39:59] you part of Christ part of the word he's
[1:40:02] visiting the part of the word that now
[1:40:03] has to manifest the word in this
[1:40:05] generation
[1:40:08] and he's visiting you in the privacy of
[1:40:11] your heart
[1:40:16] where you can't even copy
[1:40:18] you can't even copy somebody else's
[1:40:20] visitation because there's no example
[1:40:22] given
[1:40:24] the Bible doesn't say what happened to
[1:40:27] Sarah just said the Lord visited her and
[1:40:30] we see the results she conceives and
[1:40:32] brings forth to child
[1:40:34] in the 10th Vision when they went into
[1:40:36] the little room they came out the other
[1:40:37] end changed still restored whole but
[1:40:40] they couldn't explain what happened
[1:40:42] you could just see the results of what
[1:40:44] happened and so now God he said the
[1:40:46] third pull it'll be a secret because
[1:40:48] there's not going to be any imitation of
[1:40:51] this there won't be an imitation all
[1:40:53] there will be as a result a
[1:40:55] manifestation but not an imitation
[1:41:00] God will visit you in the privacy of
[1:41:02] your heart where under the seven still
[1:41:03] under the end time under the Fulfillment
[1:41:05] of the promise under the completion
[1:41:08] of the Gentile dispensation
[1:41:11] now over here in Hebrews 11
[1:41:21] . let's go to verse 8.
[1:41:24] by faith Abraham when he was called to
[1:41:26] go out into a place which he should
[1:41:27] after receive for an inheritance obeyed
[1:41:29] and he went out not knowing whether he
[1:41:31] went by faith he so adjourn in the land
[1:41:33] of promise as in a strange country
[1:41:35] dwelling in the Tabernacles with Isaac
[1:41:37] and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same
[1:41:39] promise for he looked for a city which
[1:41:41] hath foundations whose Builder and maker
[1:41:43] was gone
[1:41:44] through faith also Sarah herself
[1:41:48] received strength to conceive seed
[1:41:54] it wasn't just that she was turned back
[1:41:56] Young
[1:41:57] she was turned back young before she
[1:41:59] conceived but at the visitation of God
[1:42:02] when he said I will visit you and he
[1:42:04] visited Sarah
[1:42:05] it gave her faith
[1:42:08] through faith Sarah herself received
[1:42:12] strength to conceive seed
[1:42:15] the seed was good
[1:42:18] the restored seed when Abraham was
[1:42:20] restored to youth the seed was good the
[1:42:22] word that we've been given is good
[1:42:25] the church has been brought back to a
[1:42:27] virgin condition brought back to the
[1:42:28] word but something else must happen in a
[1:42:30] private visitation to Sarah to you the
[1:42:33] bride you must have a visitation of
[1:42:35] Christ in your heart that gives you
[1:42:37] Faith to conceive the seed
[1:42:40] seed's good the restoration is good but
[1:42:43] we must have a personal visitation where
[1:42:46] this mystery is revealed to us and we
[1:42:48] receive strength by what by faith we
[1:42:51] receive strength to conceive
[1:42:53] and so this word can reproduce the son
[1:42:56] of man again
[1:43:02] in Galatians 4 19 I'll just read it to
[1:43:04] you Paul the Apostle says my little
[1:43:06] children of whom I travail in birth
[1:43:08] again until Christ be formed in you
[1:43:12] what was Paul wanting for the church he
[1:43:14] wanted Christ to be formed in you
[1:43:17] that's why he espoused them only to one
[1:43:19] and and he was nervous over them but he
[1:43:21] espoused them as a Chase virgin even one
[1:43:23] even to Christ why because he wanted
[1:43:25] Christ to be formed in them
[1:43:27] he knew it would take a virgin womb and
[1:43:29] now Christ would be formed in them and
[1:43:31] then now he's he's laboring to try to
[1:43:35] bring forth the manifestation of Christ
[1:43:37] in them
[1:43:39] that's the day we live here
[1:43:43] and the message things that are to be
[1:43:45] the prophet says now if we are those
[1:43:47] attributes of God we cannot live by
[1:43:49] Creeds we cannot live by
[1:43:51] denominationalism we must live by the
[1:43:52] word because the bride is part of the
[1:43:55] bridegroom like any wife is part of her
[1:43:57] husband therefore we must be that word
[1:43:59] bride and what is the word bride the
[1:44:01] manifestation of this hour the bride not
[1:44:04] a Creed or denomination but a living
[1:44:07] Oracle of God a living attribute of God
[1:44:10] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:44:12] of God in the formation of the Bride
[1:44:15] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[1:44:17] we're now living
[1:44:19] what's the hour the expression of the
[1:44:22] son of man of the word through the bride
[1:44:25] that's the expression I want you to do
[1:44:27] she's reproduce the son of man again
[1:44:31] amen
[1:44:34] when brother Bram comes to crisis
[1:44:36] mystery God revealed he starts with the
[1:44:38] scriptures out of Colossians 1 and quite
[1:44:40] familiar we know them but I'm just going
[1:44:42] to recite this one to you
[1:44:44] he said wherefore I am made a minister
[1:44:46] according to the dispensation of God
[1:44:47] which is given to me for you
[1:44:49] to fulfill the word of God
[1:44:51] even the mystery would have been hid
[1:44:53] from ages and from Generations but now
[1:44:55] is made manifest to his Saints to whom
[1:44:58] God would make known what is the riches
[1:44:59] of the glory of this mystery among the
[1:45:01] Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope
[1:45:04] of glory
[1:45:07] it can't stop with brother Branham
[1:45:10] that that manifestation had to take
[1:45:13] place
[1:45:15] before I could ever come into my
[1:45:17] manifestation
[1:45:19] without it we're nowhere
[1:45:21] without the seventh angel we're nowhere
[1:45:24] we're lost in the scripture somewhere
[1:45:25] with no Mark no placing
[1:45:27] without a son of man revealing the son
[1:45:30] of man amen we don't know who's here in
[1:45:32] this hour we don't know what the hour is
[1:45:34] we don't know the manifestation we
[1:45:36] haven't had declared to us the days of
[1:45:37] law we don't understand but through that
[1:45:40] Ministry it declared to us the hour in
[1:45:42] the season and day and who's present
[1:45:45] and what's to be accomplished
[1:45:51] and then when we see Eliezer fetch a
[1:45:54] bride for Isaac once Isaac and Eliezer
[1:45:57] or Isaac and Rebecca are connected
[1:45:59] eliezer's work is complete
[1:46:03] [Music]
[1:46:05] brother Ben says in God's provided place
[1:46:08] of worship from 1965 but he promised
[1:46:11] just before the coming of the end time
[1:46:13] the world would get like it was in Sodom
[1:46:15] when a man come down in human form three
[1:46:17] of them two angels and God himself that
[1:46:19] was God the Bible said it was now he
[1:46:21] come down and he manifests himself there
[1:46:23] by turning his back to the tent where
[1:46:25] Sarah was and told Abraham what Sarah
[1:46:27] was thinking in the temp that's right
[1:46:28] now Jesus himself said at the day when
[1:46:32] the son of man is being revealed in
[1:46:33] other words the son of man the ministry
[1:46:36] of Jesus Christ himself
[1:46:38] that way we don't have any mistake on
[1:46:39] what the son of man is the ministry of
[1:46:41] Jesus Christ himself
[1:46:43] the church will come through
[1:46:44] justification through Luther through
[1:46:46] sanctification through Wesley through
[1:46:47] the baptism the holy ghost or the
[1:46:49] Pentecostals and go right on into the
[1:46:51] Perfection of the son of man
[1:46:53] so we go through justification
[1:46:55] sanctification the baptism that goes
[1:46:57] into the Perfection of the son of man we
[1:46:59] don't stop at the baptism in the Holy
[1:47:01] Ghost that's to bring us to the person
[1:47:02] of the Holy Ghost himself
[1:47:04] and to the Perfection of the son of man
[1:47:06] and what is the Perfection of the son of
[1:47:08] man that when husband and wife will be
[1:47:10] the same self person
[1:47:13] when the two become one
[1:47:15] and began to manifest itself
[1:47:18] why was Adam given a bride to reproduce
[1:47:20] himself why is Christ given a bride to
[1:47:22] reproduce himself
[1:47:27] God will be so manifested in his into
[1:47:30] his bride his church until they will
[1:47:32] both be the same they are one
[1:47:34] now you see where we're at
[1:47:37] I love that last statement he preaches
[1:47:39] in April of 1965. he says now you see
[1:47:42] where we're at
[1:47:43] the seals have been opened the seven
[1:47:45] seal has been opened the son of man has
[1:47:47] come the Lord Has Come and revealed
[1:47:49] himself through a son of man
[1:47:51] to do what to to unite The Head and the
[1:47:54] body together so that she can manifest
[1:47:57] the son of man
[1:47:59] said now you see where we're at
[1:48:02] I hope we see where we're at this is
[1:48:03] where we're at
[1:48:05] but if this is where we're at amen what
[1:48:07] kind of people do we need to be and what
[1:48:09] kind of Revelation do we need to have
[1:48:15] amen let's turn to Ephesians chapter
[1:48:17] four together
[1:48:26] Ephesians chapter 4.
[1:48:34] we'll read from verse 10.
[1:48:39] he that descended is the same also that
[1:48:41] ascended up far above all Heavens that
[1:48:44] they might fill all things and he gave
[1:48:45] some Apostles and some prophets and some
[1:48:47] evangelists and some pastors and
[1:48:49] teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:48:51] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:48:53] the edifying of the body of Christ
[1:48:55] till we all come into the unity of faith
[1:48:58] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[1:49:00] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[1:49:03] the stature the fullness of Christ
[1:49:05] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:49:07] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:49:08] every wind of Doctrine by the slide of
[1:49:10] men and the cunning craftiness whereby
[1:49:12] they lie and wait to deceive but see
[1:49:15] beeking the truth in love may grow up
[1:49:16] into him in all things which is the head
[1:49:19] even Christ
[1:49:21] you can see here I want to look at the
[1:49:24] the work of the ministry and God uses a
[1:49:27] faithful Ministry but the faithful
[1:49:28] Ministry is the work of Christ
[1:49:32] and to do what to bring us into the
[1:49:34] unity of Faith verse 13 in the knowledge
[1:49:37] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[1:49:39] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:49:42] fullness of Christ
[1:49:43] what's the point of the ministry
[1:49:46] brother random said the ministry in his
[1:49:48] third pull the ministry come Perfection
[1:49:49] when it reproduced Christ and natural
[1:49:51] again amongst the bride
[1:49:54] what will be the completion of the
[1:49:56] Perfection of the ministry even through
[1:49:58] the faithful Ministry the ministry of
[1:49:59] Christ
[1:50:01] is to bring the church the bride the
[1:50:03] people
[1:50:04] into a perfect man
[1:50:07] into the stature of the fullness of
[1:50:09] Christ
[1:50:11] until we can look back at the
[1:50:14] culmination and see the pre-figure the
[1:50:17] pre-figure from Revelation chapter one
[1:50:19] when we see one like the son of man
[1:50:23] until this bride becomes one like the
[1:50:25] son of man
[1:50:27] till she is in his very image she is in
[1:50:29] his very likeness she has this very
[1:50:31] character
[1:50:32] displaying his very
[1:50:33] life
[1:50:36] brother bear says in the message
[1:50:38] desperations
[1:50:40] he said
[1:50:44] how is it then how is it that we can see
[1:50:47] other great signs and wonders done on
[1:50:49] others and what about us
[1:50:50] it should cause an estate of desperation
[1:50:53] that we are determined before God
[1:50:55] the signs of his coming should bring
[1:50:57] this entire congregation when we've read
[1:50:59] it from the word and the Holy Spirit has
[1:51:01] told us go at a certain place such and
[1:51:03] such a thing will happen not tell us
[1:51:05] what it was but it would happen we go
[1:51:07] there it happens that way the newspapers
[1:51:10] packet the magazines packet show the
[1:51:12] picture of it he's talking about Tucson
[1:51:14] he's talking about getting caught up in
[1:51:15] the consolation of angels and the and
[1:51:17] the picture of Christ in the sky the
[1:51:19] Clown
[1:51:21] he said
[1:51:22] the newspapers back at the magazines
[1:51:24] packet showed a picture of it come back
[1:51:26] here and see those great Mysteries
[1:51:28] hidden in the Bible opened up to us on a
[1:51:30] new field that we never knowed before
[1:51:32] and perfectly Blends into the coming of
[1:51:35] the Lord Jesus
[1:51:37] then at the end of the messages see the
[1:51:38] action of the great Holy Spirit see him
[1:51:40] come down visible before people even
[1:51:42] take pictures of it see it working and
[1:51:45] showing that it's not a man it's not
[1:51:47] just a preacher it's not a certain
[1:51:49] congregation it's the Holy Spirit
[1:51:51] showing the same thing he did when he
[1:51:53] was embodied in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:51:56] now it's in body in the body of his
[1:51:59] bride
[1:52:02] what was embodied in the body of Jesus
[1:52:04] Christ is now to be embodied in the body
[1:52:06] of his bride
[1:52:10] and brother Ben said it should throw us
[1:52:13] into desperation
[1:52:16] this is the part that I I want to end on
[1:52:20] if this is true
[1:52:23] if everything we've seen is true if
[1:52:25] we've seen a repeat of the days of Sodom
[1:52:27] and we've seen a visitation of Jehovah
[1:52:30] amen like on the plains of memory if
[1:52:32] we've seen the sign of the Messiah and
[1:52:34] the discernment behind
[1:52:35] if we've seen the ministry of Eleazar if
[1:52:38] we've seen all this
[1:52:40] then what does that mean for me as an
[1:52:42] individual
[1:52:45] we we can say we can use group
[1:52:48] statements and group statements are nice
[1:52:50] and comforting the bride is this and
[1:52:52] she's that and she's this but the
[1:52:55] Revelation must move away from group
[1:52:56] statements and become individual
[1:52:59] come to the place where I say have I had
[1:53:01] a visitation like Sarah God do get has
[1:53:04] he given me by faith strength to
[1:53:06] conceive the seed
[1:53:09] not as a church receives of course it's
[1:53:11] come to the church that's the
[1:53:12] dispensation where this has been
[1:53:14] restored the bride has been restored the
[1:53:16] word has been restored she's been given
[1:53:17] faith for strength to conceive but what
[1:53:19] about me as an individual have I got
[1:53:22] that visitation from him has he visited
[1:53:24] me and given me Faith to receive seed
[1:53:27] and conceive seed
[1:53:29] man
[1:53:31] and then what kind of Life am I supposed
[1:53:33] to produce
[1:53:34] [Music]
[1:53:35] what has the if I do I believe that the
[1:53:40] manifestation of the son of man in my
[1:53:42] day was to do what to unite The Head and
[1:53:43] the body I'm part of the body and the
[1:53:46] whole purpose of the ministry was
[1:53:47] brother better was to get me connected
[1:53:49] to Christ
[1:53:53] bring it personal
[1:53:55] and if that Ministry was meant to get me
[1:53:58] connected to Christ so I take the
[1:53:59] headship of the word amen and then I and
[1:54:03] then then what is it to do then then
[1:54:05] reproduce the son of man
[1:54:07] then that means all the preaching and
[1:54:09] all the teaching and all the faithful
[1:54:11] Ministry and the ministry of it was all
[1:54:13] to do one thing to bring me into the
[1:54:16] stature of a perfect man into the
[1:54:17] fullness of Christ
[1:54:21] so that now he can live through me
[1:54:25] so that I
[1:54:27] can manifest the Sun
[1:54:30] I myself want to be given to Christ
[1:54:33] so that he can reproduce himself
[1:54:36] me in my life can I do it all no it's
[1:54:39] not all for me to do but I want to do my
[1:54:40] portion
[1:54:42] I want to be true to the message true to
[1:54:44] the hour not by mental acceptance I can
[1:54:47] say amen amen amen no it can't be just
[1:54:50] Amen in the mouth it must be Amen in the
[1:54:53] life amen the life is the amen
[1:54:56] the life the consecration the reality
[1:54:58] the lining up to the word The Obedience
[1:55:00] to surrender all of that is the amen to
[1:55:03] the word I can amen and doubt in my
[1:55:06] heart I can say Amen loud on this Earth
[1:55:07] I can even agree intellectually that
[1:55:09] this is the bride this is the time he
[1:55:11] fulfilled Revelation or Genesis 18 yeah
[1:55:13] Revelation 10 I agree with all of that
[1:55:15] but my life is nowhere near manifesting
[1:55:18] Christ I say God I need that visitation
[1:55:21] amen I need a visitation from you
[1:55:23] personally to me amen that'll that'll
[1:55:26] give me Faith to conceive the seed of
[1:55:28] this word
[1:55:31] so that you can reproduce yourself
[1:55:33] through me
[1:55:35] he has no hands but your hands no feet
[1:55:37] but your feet no eyes you are the body
[1:55:40] of Jesus Christ according to the Apostle
[1:55:42] Paul
[1:55:43] his body On Earth Is His Bride
[1:55:47] if he's going to do anything he must do
[1:55:49] it through her
[1:55:51] amen
[1:55:53] brother man said in the spoken word is
[1:55:55] the Original Seed he says you become
[1:55:56] nothing
[1:55:57] Christ becomes alive
[1:56:00] you die he lives
[1:56:03] listen he died so I can live
[1:56:07] now I must die so he can live
[1:56:10] life comes by death my spiritual life
[1:56:13] came by his physical death amen now his
[1:56:16] life and me will come by me dying to the
[1:56:19] flesh
[1:56:23] when I die he lives again when I die he
[1:56:26] promised me life and I died out to
[1:56:28] myself so in order I can have his life
[1:56:30] and how how do I do it by taking his
[1:56:33] word his seed put a seed in here by
[1:56:36] faith and believe it and then it
[1:56:37] produces exactly what the Bible said
[1:56:41] it's gone
[1:56:44] you know the natural types to spiritual
[1:56:47] and in the natural types in the
[1:56:49] spiritual you know a woman
[1:56:53] is made we know that now life comes in a
[1:56:55] perverted way but God still allows it it
[1:56:56] works to his perfect will and his
[1:56:58] permissive will
[1:56:59] but a man has life within him
[1:57:03] he has seed
[1:57:05] he is live
[1:57:07] but that man needs another body to bring
[1:57:09] forth the life that's in him
[1:57:11] is that right
[1:57:13] he needs a womb he needs a woman he
[1:57:16] needs a counterpart he needs his wife
[1:57:19] but the wife she has no power to bring
[1:57:22] forth life on her own she needs to seed
[1:57:25] from the man
[1:57:28] and how does she get the seed from the
[1:57:30] men the only way is for her to
[1:57:32] completely surrender herself
[1:57:35] she can't work she can't produce she
[1:57:38] can't put forth ever what she does is
[1:57:41] surrender
[1:57:42] and in her surrendering herself the man
[1:57:46] can do the work
[1:57:47] to bring forth to life
[1:57:51] we must surrender to Christ Christ has
[1:57:54] deceived
[1:57:56] he's got what I need I can't do nothing
[1:57:58] I can't do nothing of myself but I come
[1:58:00] to him but Christ he needs a body to
[1:58:03] work through to reproduce himself
[1:58:05] and I want to be that body
[1:58:08] I want to lay down my life and surrender
[1:58:11] and say I give myself holy to you so
[1:58:13] that you can come and produce your life
[1:58:15] through me
[1:58:18] amen what's it going to take it's going
[1:58:20] to take surrender
[1:58:23] not I'm going to live this life I'm
[1:58:24] going to take this I'm going to go and
[1:58:26] get we're not going to go and get
[1:58:27] anything amen amen I'm telling you if
[1:58:30] the if if the man doesn't sow the seed
[1:58:32] there's nothing that you're going to do
[1:58:33] as a woman there's nothing you're going
[1:58:35] to do I'm going to produce life I'm
[1:58:37] going to have a family I'm going to do
[1:58:39] this I can show you I don't need a man
[1:58:40] please
[1:58:43] if the man's not willing Amen to sow the
[1:58:46] seed there's no life coming
[1:58:49] amen so the only thing we can do is say
[1:58:52] Lord I surrender all hey I'm here Lord
[1:58:55] amen you told me to receive the spirit
[1:58:57] I'm receiving your spirit now I'm open
[1:58:59] to it you can't give it to yourself you
[1:59:02] can't take it you can't make it but all
[1:59:04] you can do is go to the source and say
[1:59:06] you promise this is your word I believe
[1:59:09] it in my heart and now I receive it I
[1:59:11] open myself to receive you in me
[1:59:16] so your word so your life so your spirit
[1:59:18] into my soul
[1:59:21] and manifest your life
[1:59:24] why this is the seventh seal
[1:59:28] and this brings him to Earth
[1:59:33] the son of man came to Earth
[1:59:36] the mighty Angel has descended Christ
[1:59:38] himself returned to the church where
[1:59:41] where was he returned to the church in
[1:59:43] that prophet
[1:59:44] I saw him he said it's not me
[1:59:47] it's Christ
[1:59:49] but that's not where his destination
[1:59:51] went to be he wanted to be in his bride
[1:59:54] that Ministry came to connect the bride
[1:59:56] and the body together and what's the
[1:59:58] bride to do she under the seventh seal
[2:00:00] is to bring him to Earth in what form in
[2:00:04] Bride form
[2:00:06] in Mrs Jesus Christ form she can't do it
[2:00:10] herself he must sow something into her
[2:00:12] to bring the life but she must receive
[2:00:15] by faith the the the life the receive
[2:00:18] the power to conceive
[2:00:20] strength to conceive by what by faith
[2:00:23] by God revealing to me who I am
[2:00:27] en unless God reveals to me who I am
[2:00:29] seed can be sown every Sunday every way
[2:00:32] good seed pure seed true seed Abraham
[2:00:35] was sowing good seed Amen in the early
[2:00:37] years of their marriage but she never
[2:00:39] conceived every Sunday Wednesday good
[2:00:41] seed good seed but even after she was
[2:00:43] turned young she needed a visitation to
[2:00:46] give her strength to conceive that good
[2:00:48] seed
[2:00:50] the message of the hour is good seed
[2:00:52] it's the seed of Christ
[2:00:54] it's the word
[2:00:55] listening to the message reading the
[2:00:57] message coming to preaching where the
[2:00:58] word is being preached it's sowing good
[2:01:00] seed amen but I need something more than
[2:01:03] being able to say that's right that's
[2:01:04] true I need strength to conceive because
[2:01:07] I need to know that whatever that is I
[2:01:09] am that's for me and I'm the recipient
[2:01:12] of that word that in the womb of my
[2:01:14] heart is where that seed is supposed to
[2:01:16] land
[2:01:17] because I'm part of it I'm part of
[2:01:19] Christ I'm part of the plan I'm the
[2:01:21] recipient for the seed and I'm also the
[2:01:24] place of manifestation
[2:01:29] how did Sarah conceive seed by faith
[2:01:32] how will we conceive seed by faith
[2:01:35] I need that visitation
[2:01:38] so that I can know
[2:01:41] that this is for me
[2:01:43] I can believe it's for the bride I can
[2:01:46] believe it's for Abraham's seed I can
[2:01:47] believe it's for brother random I must
[2:01:48] believe it's for me
[2:01:55] in Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[2:01:57] again he says
[2:01:59] and organizations from Men of God who
[2:02:01] went forth to establish truth in the
[2:02:03] earth before that truth could go on and
[2:02:05] Proclaim and proclamate and get on to
[2:02:07] the real revelation of Christ
[2:02:09] Fallen Angels came in and took it over
[2:02:11] and made denominations out of him
[2:02:14] that's the reason the revelation of the
[2:02:16] seven seal mystery had to be unfolded
[2:02:18] it had to unlock all that mystery of
[2:02:21] what's been wrong with the church all
[2:02:22] these years
[2:02:24] why didn't the first church produce what
[2:02:26] it was supposed to produce why have we
[2:02:27] had the denominations why was the Dark
[2:02:29] Ages what is all of this what is the
[2:02:31] Reformation what's it all about the
[2:02:33] Seven Seals unlocked the whole mystery
[2:02:36] so that we could rise above all of that
[2:02:39] nonsense and come back to origin
[2:02:42] the leaves the picture of church
[2:02:46] and churches and reformations and
[2:02:47] teaching and leave all of that and move
[2:02:50] so far up that we could see all the way
[2:02:52] back oh a Son of God and a wife and
[2:02:56] connected together reproduce themselves
[2:02:57] sons of God on the earth oh I get what
[2:03:00] this is all about
[2:03:02] it's not about teachings and it's not
[2:03:04] about church buildings and it's not a
[2:03:05] it's not about revivals and it's not
[2:03:07] about groups and it's not about
[2:03:09] doctrines amen it's all about Christ and
[2:03:12] a bride going back to Eden to what God
[2:03:14] originally wanted that's what was locked
[2:03:16] under the seventh seal the mystery of
[2:03:19] God Amen God becoming a family and
[2:03:22] fellowshipping with his attributes and
[2:03:23] love and in Harmony and in unity
[2:03:27] if this mystery hadn't been revealed
[2:03:30] we'd fall right back into the same cycle
[2:03:32] of getting more truce building walls to
[2:03:33] defend our truth honing everybody to the
[2:03:35] tree and missing the whole purpose of
[2:03:37] Truth coming
[2:03:39] and I'm afraid sometimes that's what
[2:03:41] we've done
[2:03:43] defend our truth got a new truth hold on
[2:03:45] to that truth don't lose that truth
[2:03:46] build a wall around the truth that it
[2:03:48] was never for you to gather around the
[2:03:51] this this teaching this Doctrine serpent
[2:03:53] seed and all of these things and wow
[2:03:55] whoa no it was to bring you to a higher
[2:03:57] understanding than to a higher
[2:03:59] understanding to unlock the mystery of
[2:04:01] the whole Bible
[2:04:03] why do we have to understand serpent
[2:04:05] seeds so I'll know why I came into this
[2:04:07] earth like this why I'm messed up and
[2:04:09] why I'm struggling when I love God so
[2:04:11] much and what it's going to take to get
[2:04:13] back to where I should have been from
[2:04:15] the beginning
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:17] so that I wouldn't fall into the same
[2:04:19] traps of legalism really trying to
[2:04:21] reform flesh I'm not to perform flesh
[2:04:23] forget reforming flesh I need a
[2:04:25] transformation on the inside that'll
[2:04:27] control this flesh until the day the
[2:04:28] flesh changes
[2:04:32] I needed the revelation of the seals to
[2:04:34] bring me higher than Church ages Beyond
[2:04:36] denominations out of doctrinal fights
[2:04:39] and bring me back to the picture
[2:04:42] that God had in his mind before the
[2:04:44] foundation of the Lord
[2:04:46] and now every truth is painting brush
[2:04:48] Strokes in that picture
[2:04:50] and the point is to get the picture
[2:04:53] and know where I am in the picture
[2:04:57] I'm not in the church ages I'm not in
[2:05:00] I'm not allowed to seeing believer
[2:05:03] I've been called out of that to be a
[2:05:05] bride
[2:05:07] I'm in the age of the Union the
[2:05:09] invisible unity in Christ in his bride
[2:05:10] to come together to do what to do what
[2:05:13] to do what to reproduce the son of man
[2:05:15] again I'm here to lay my life down to
[2:05:19] surrender to him to receive his
[2:05:20] visitation receive his seed and allow
[2:05:23] that word to live through this flesh so
[2:05:25] that the world will see that Christ is
[2:05:27] on Earth and a bride
[2:05:30] because the seventh seal brings him to
[2:05:33] Earth
[2:05:34] and the seventh seal in this time has
[2:05:37] brought him to Earth where all that God
[2:05:40] was
[2:05:41] he poured into Christ
[2:05:43] all that Christ was he poured into the
[2:05:46] church
[2:05:47] that life was bound up in chain and held
[2:05:50] behind denominational Rivers for 2000
[2:05:52] years but has been released at the
[2:05:54] opening of the seals
[2:05:56] the full life all that was poured into
[2:05:58] Christ Christ has poured all of it in
[2:06:00] the end time
[2:06:04] so that we have the power
[2:06:07] to conceive
[2:06:09] D so that we would have the power not by
[2:06:11] our power but by his power his life to
[2:06:13] Manifest this life friends that should
[2:06:16] throw us into desperation
[2:06:19] if that be true for me I cannot be
[2:06:22] sincere enough I cannot give up enough
[2:06:24] if this this is what the whole hour is
[2:06:27] for this is the whole purpose of my life
[2:06:29] this is why I'm planted here is to
[2:06:31] manifest his life I can't go on selfish
[2:06:33] I can't go on with my own wants I can't
[2:06:35] go on trampling over the word of God to
[2:06:38] have what I want I can't go on wait I
[2:06:41] can't go on Faking I can't go I'm
[2:06:42] playing a part I can't go on singing One
[2:06:44] Way at church and living another way I
[2:06:46] can't do that anymore this hour is a
[2:06:48] different hour
[2:06:51] I've got to surrender all that I am so
[2:06:54] that I can come to this
[2:06:56] manifestation of the hour that we live
[2:06:58] in
[2:07:00] what a travesty for God to come like he
[2:07:03] did on the planes of memory and he came
[2:07:06] in our day through a prophet to turn his
[2:07:07] back to a crowd and discern dozens of
[2:07:10] people in the crown so that there was no
[2:07:12] mistake that Jesus Christ was present
[2:07:15] and shows through every type in the
[2:07:17] Bible and through every scripture of the
[2:07:19] end time and fully manifest it and
[2:07:21] declare it what a shame
[2:07:23] for Sarah to be changed back to never
[2:07:25] bring forth Isaac
[2:07:28] but oh I'm so glad he's got a plan
[2:07:33] and I believe I'm part of that plan
[2:07:35] where I were left to me it would fail
[2:07:37] it's not left up to me it was left up to
[2:07:39] him all I can do is surrender myself to
[2:07:41] his plan and say God take your way with
[2:07:44] me
[2:07:45] should bring us to desperation
[2:07:48] should bring us to a constant seeking
[2:07:52] it should bring us to a constant place
[2:07:53] where we're saying God I need more
[2:07:57] I need more than what I had yesterday
[2:07:59] there's new challenges there's there's
[2:08:01] still old self I need more
[2:08:04] I need more of you and less of me Lord I
[2:08:07] want to die out I want to receive more
[2:08:08] there should be a constant need for more
[2:08:11] of him
[2:08:12] I'm one of the most dangerous things we
[2:08:14] can fold into is complacency
[2:08:17] where we feel like we've arrived that
[2:08:19] I'm the bride I've got the Revelation
[2:08:20] I've arrived now I'm just waiting for
[2:08:22] everybody else to catch up to where I am
[2:08:24] so our bodies can change
[2:08:25] right what a dangerous place to be
[2:08:28] friends
[2:08:32] I don't want to be in that place I want
[2:08:34] to be in the place where say Lord
[2:08:35] if there's any more for you to manifest
[2:08:37] manifest it through me
[2:08:40] Lord I know that I'm not to where I need
[2:08:42] to be
[2:08:43] I want to be further down the road I
[2:08:46] want to manifest your word
[2:08:47] help me God to die
[2:08:50] I want to be a sacrifice
[2:08:54] so that's the reason the Revelation the
[2:08:56] seven seal mystery had to be unfolded
[2:08:58] now you see it what they left off if
[2:09:00] Luther would have went on it had been
[2:09:02] here why because Luther was a
[2:09:04] predestinated seed
[2:09:06] if Luther would have kept moving in the
[2:09:08] revelation of the word he'd come to hear
[2:09:10] any predestinated seed if they would
[2:09:13] keep moving the Revelation word will
[2:09:14] come here
[2:09:15] we're not different than any other
[2:09:18] predestination from the first age second
[2:09:19] age third age they just didn't get to
[2:09:21] come here
[2:09:23] they didn't get to hear what we hear
[2:09:25] they didn't get the Revelation they
[2:09:27] weren't here for the unveiling of the
[2:09:28] seals amen we were positionally placed
[2:09:30] here to reveal a certain thing and we're
[2:09:32] predestinated see like they're
[2:09:33] predestinated
[2:09:35] so if Luther would if he would have been
[2:09:37] here if he would have went on
[2:09:39] if Leslie would have went on Pentecost
[2:09:41] would have went on what would they have
[2:09:43] done
[2:09:44] now there is only one thing can happen
[2:09:46] there has to be a message at the end
[2:09:48] time when there is nothing else can
[2:09:50] follow it and now the ecumenical world
[2:09:52] has set up such a regime that there can
[2:09:54] be no denomination and no not nothing
[2:09:56] else follow him you're either in it or
[2:09:58] you're not in it the fruit is in the top
[2:10:00] of the tree and the light is shining on
[2:10:02] the predestinated fruit and she is
[2:10:04] ripening into christ-like Fruit bringing
[2:10:07] forth the same meloness and sweetness
[2:10:09] and the same spirit that he had in him
[2:10:13] the bridegroom tree without the bride
[2:10:16] tree can't produce the fruit
[2:10:20] Abraham without Sarah couldn't produce
[2:10:23] the fruit of his loins
[2:10:26] Christ without his bride which is a
[2:10:29] further revelation of himself
[2:10:32] won't produce the end time
[2:10:34] seed
[2:10:35] it'll be produced
[2:10:37] by in Christ comes through his bride
[2:10:40] when the two unite and she conceived
[2:10:43] seed and now Christ takes over
[2:10:46] and he manifests himself
[2:10:48] through her
[2:10:50] it will become so much fun she'll be
[2:10:52] coming in his very image she will be him
[2:10:57] one like the son of man
[2:10:59] standing in the midst of Seven Counties
[2:11:02] amen the seventh seal brings him back to
[2:11:06] Earth
[2:11:08] right now it's bringing back to Earth
[2:11:10] and a bride
[2:11:12] soon it'll bring him back to Earth as a
[2:11:14] revelation to 144 000. that's on the
[2:11:16] seventh year then it will bring him back
[2:11:19] to Earth as the son of David to sit on
[2:11:21] the throne of David to A Thousand Years
[2:11:22] the seventh seal brings him back to
[2:11:24] Earth
[2:11:25] but right now the seventh seal has
[2:11:27] brought him back to Earth in the
[2:11:29] formation of his bride
[2:11:31] and that's the manifestation of the hour
[2:11:34] and that's the manifestation I want to
[2:11:36] give all myself to you so that he can
[2:11:39] manifest that through me
[2:11:41] let's all stand
[2:11:44] the seventh seal is the completion
[2:11:48] what's the seven seal completing in US
[2:11:51] it's completing the marriage of Christ
[2:11:53] and his bride as a restoration Back to
[2:11:56] Eden he had to have a gentile bride and
[2:11:59] that was never completed his Gentile
[2:12:01] Pride was never completed and brought
[2:12:03] into Union with him until now
[2:12:05] that's the seventh seal for the Gentiles
[2:12:08] then to the Jews he'll restore the Jews
[2:12:10] the the nation will be born in a day
[2:12:13] under the 144 000. that's the seven
[2:12:15] sealed to them their seventh trumpet
[2:12:18] and then for the Earth there'll be a
[2:12:20] seventh seal
[2:12:22] when Christ and his bride Return To Rule
[2:12:24] and Reign for a thousand years the
[2:12:26] seventh day
[2:12:28] and the seventh seal brings him back to
[2:12:30] Earth
[2:12:32] I want the seventh seal to bring him
[2:12:34] back to Earth in me
[2:12:38] if you don't get anything else take this
[2:12:40] away
[2:12:41] if the seventh seal will bring him back
[2:12:43] to Earth it needs to bring him back to
[2:12:45] birth in me
[2:12:49] you can't say in my church it's not in
[2:12:51] my church
[2:12:52] it's not in my church
[2:12:54] it may be fine if it's in the people
[2:12:56] that attend your church but it's got to
[2:12:58] be manifest in me
[2:13:01] I have to have the Revelation I have to
[2:13:04] surrender myself I have to come into
[2:13:06] Union and I have to yield
[2:13:08] and I have to die so that he can live
[2:13:12] I have to have faith to conceive seed
[2:13:16] to bring forth Christ and I can only do
[2:13:18] it by the gift of God
[2:13:21] amen all I can do is recognize it to be
[2:13:23] nothing but the truth
[2:13:25] and all I can do is go to God and say
[2:13:27] God that ain't nothing but the truth
[2:13:30] I was preached it struck my heart I know
[2:13:33] it's nothing but the truth but God it's
[2:13:35] going to take you
[2:13:37] it's going to take you to bring it to
[2:13:39] life in me
[2:13:40] help me surrender help me wash out help
[2:13:43] me to to remove whatever I can remove
[2:13:46] but oh God it's going to take you
[2:13:48] I can't produce this life by myself I
[2:13:51] need you
[2:13:52] to come and do the work in me that I can
[2:13:55] do
[2:13:56] but oh how exciting to live in the day
[2:13:59] that this is the very manifestation of
[2:14:02] the hour
[2:14:04] when we ask for these things we're not
[2:14:05] asking for things that we hope to get we
[2:14:08] we're not asking for things that we hope
[2:14:09] will happen we're asking for things that
[2:14:11] we know are the manifestation of the
[2:14:13] hour will come according to the word
[2:14:15] asking according to the word yielding to
[2:14:17] the word so that the word could be made
[2:14:18] manifest in US
[2:14:20] this isn't oh I hope so no this is the
[2:14:23] hour
[2:14:24] this is the time
[2:14:26] and I'm one of them
[2:14:28] God live in me
[2:14:30] amen God bless you let's pray
[2:14:33] dear heavenly father we thank you Lord
[2:14:36] for your word
[2:14:38] God we stand
[2:14:40] Lord Believing by Revelation that we are
[2:14:43] your bride that you've called to
[2:14:45] manifest yourself in this end time
[2:14:47] Lord you've given us a heart to believe
[2:14:49] you've put something in us that could
[2:14:51] receive
[2:14:52] though thousands will walk away tens of
[2:14:55] thousands will shake their head
[2:14:57] something in us will say it's true it's
[2:15:00] all true
[2:15:02] and God we recognize by Your Grace by
[2:15:04] your faith the hour that we're living in
[2:15:06] and we're recognizing that it'll take
[2:15:08] you Lord manifesting yourself through us
[2:15:11] and in this Union that's what you want
[2:15:13] to do we've come to the union now
[2:15:16] I pray God that you would unlock the
[2:15:18] faith within us
[2:15:19] you can see this seed and let it bear
[2:15:22] Witness
[2:15:23] that you're alive that you're here that
[2:15:25] you're present
[2:15:27] that you're on the earth walking in
[2:15:28] flesh Again In the Flesh of your body
[2:15:31] your bride
[2:15:33] while we surrender ourselves to you
[2:15:36] pray that you would take full possession
[2:15:37] Lord for we are in the second fold of
[2:15:40] your threefold plan and that's that you
[2:15:42] will get preeminence
[2:15:44] the very reason you preached your word
[2:15:46] is so we could surrender to it so that
[2:15:49] we could receive it so that you could
[2:15:50] come and manifest yourself in Bride form
[2:15:54] and here we are Lord
[2:15:56] you told your disciples to receive the
[2:15:58] spirit and you breathed on them
[2:16:00] God you breathed your word Upon Us
[2:16:02] you've commanded us to receive it Lord I
[2:16:04] receive it
[2:16:06] Jesus Christ's name I receive all of
[2:16:08] your word
[2:16:09] let it live in me we stand just as
[2:16:11] helpless as any woman is to bring forth
[2:16:13] life on our own
[2:16:15] but God we're standing here surrendered
[2:16:17] to you inviting you to come and bring
[2:16:19] forth your life
[2:16:20] through us
[2:16:22] we thank you for the hour we live and we
[2:16:24] thank you for the revelation of the
[2:16:25] seals we thank you for peeling back the
[2:16:28] mystery
[2:16:29] opening that seventh seal and revealing
[2:16:31] the mystery of yourself
[2:16:33] God you've given us such Faith to walk
[2:16:35] in this hour
[2:16:36] but it seems so impossible for human
[2:16:39] beings to come to this level of life God
[2:16:41] you made it possible by the preaching of
[2:16:43] the word and when you preach the word
[2:16:45] and you open the seals you release the
[2:16:46] power a life to come back into your
[2:16:49] church
[2:16:50] and God you're pouring it in even now
[2:16:52] under the preaching of the word
[2:16:54] Lord we're receiving it Lord we're
[2:16:57] lifting our cups fill us Lord fill us to
[2:16:59] overflowing with this life you're
[2:17:01] pouring out amongst us
[2:17:03] and Lord may it flow out of us become a
[2:17:06] well of Living Water a spring of Living
[2:17:08] Water welling up into everlasting life
[2:17:12] we love you God we ask for your
[2:17:14] blessings over your people over your
[2:17:16] word may it find deep root
[2:17:19] in our lives we love you God

[2:17:25] keep us help us as we come back to the
[2:17:27] communion service this afternoon by your
[2:17:29] will

[2:20:15] greetings to everybody it was a blessing
[2:20:18] to be here
[2:20:20] thank you for receiving us
[2:20:24] and for Dave
[2:20:27] Woods that they opened their house last
[2:20:31] night we could have a great fellowship
[2:20:34] with them and good night of rest and
[2:20:37] what a blessing
[2:20:39] it was a blessing to be here
[2:20:41] to hear about the seventh seal
[2:20:46] we just started to receive this message
[2:20:48] since New Year's I think January
[2:20:52] was the first time
[2:20:54] I would start reading William branham's
[2:20:57] message just the seven h
[2:21:00] book The Red Book was so dear I stood up
[2:21:04] at four o'clock in the morning to just
[2:21:06] get more of it
[2:21:07] we never heard anything like this I
[2:21:09] didn't know anything about William
[2:21:11] Branham a year ago I didn't know there
[2:21:13] was a man like that
[2:21:15] and I didn't know it took a profit to
[2:21:18] reveal the Mysteries
[2:21:24] why did God
[2:21:27] come through Junction City
[2:21:30] why did Jesus come through Junction City
[2:21:32] [Music]
[2:21:34] for me
[2:21:35] my wife and of our friends
[2:21:42] one thing I want to share
[2:21:44] I wasn't going to be up here but Chad
[2:21:46] put me on a spot
[2:21:48] it doesn't matter
[2:21:51] but we were in a real good church or we
[2:21:53] we thought we were in the best Church in
[2:21:54] the world
[2:21:55] we really did
[2:21:58] but we were having problems and
[2:22:00] so
[2:22:02] I don't know if anybody of you know
[2:22:05] chantis and Franklin he taught about
[2:22:08] fasting and prayer a 21 day fast and
[2:22:11] different things so somebody gave us
[2:22:12] that book and so we went on a 21 day
[2:22:15] fast and prayer and brothers and sisters
[2:22:18] I'm telling you
[2:22:19] if you're serious if you fast for 21
[2:22:22] days is so Daniel's fast like we can
[2:22:25] read in Daniel like he fast for three
[2:22:27] weeks a liquid fast if you do that if
[2:22:30] you pray and fast God will move in your
[2:22:33] life and I think as far as we know
[2:22:35] everybody that went on that fast and
[2:22:37] fasted for three weeks left at church
[2:22:41] seriously
[2:22:45] so we believe that and we we've done
[2:22:48] that since that and God answered prayers
[2:22:51] for us and opened our heart and mind to
[2:22:54] receive the word of God for in this hour
[2:22:58] and we thought we were right
[2:23:01] but we were in the denomination loss
[2:23:04] when I I often wandered in Revelation
[2:23:06] Chapter 2 uh when where it talks about
[2:23:09] the Jezebel woman
[2:23:11] um I often wonder why would God kill
[2:23:14] somebody's children with death
[2:23:18] now I know what he's talking about
[2:23:20] now I know what he's talking about
[2:23:24] it's by the grace of God that I'm here
[2:23:27] today
[2:23:33] so we had Chad come down he preached a
[2:23:36] message for us here a couple weeks ago
[2:23:38] Kyle
[2:23:39] and his family was down we would have
[2:23:41] loved to just keep them guys down there
[2:23:45] we need a pastor like that to teach us
[2:23:48] we had Jesse Smith down he taught us
[2:23:51] wonderful things and so now we had a
[2:23:55] baptismal service he
[2:23:57] Jesse came down he one evening he
[2:23:59] baptized 17 there
[2:24:03] later we went Kyle baptized the one up
[2:24:07] in brinkhaven that we were witnessed to
[2:24:10] and then a couple weeks ago
[2:24:12] [Music]
[2:24:14] Jad baptized three more so it's just
[2:24:19] it's just amazing to me how God brought
[2:24:21] things together from one person to the
[2:24:23] other and and when we left the Amish
[2:24:26] Church an English man told me you're
[2:24:28] going to make a lot of new friends
[2:24:30] [Music]
[2:24:31] here we are
[2:24:33] and and the good thing is they're true
[2:24:36] friends
[2:24:41] it's just amazing to me how the spirit
[2:24:43] of God moves and how it works in
[2:24:45] people's lives and how we can connect to
[2:24:47] each other last night when I met Dave we
[2:24:49] were brothers we just connected same as
[2:24:52] Jet and you guys it's just a blessing if
[2:24:55] you got the spirit of God within you it
[2:24:57] it'll draw people together with the same
[2:24:59] spirit
[2:25:02] but not everybody thinks well of us
[2:25:04] there's people that think now we're
[2:25:05] deceived because we left the Amish
[2:25:07] system
[2:25:10] but I know where we stand
[2:25:12] in January I was one morning as I was
[2:25:15] having devotions God gave me a
[2:25:17] revelation of Matthew 16 about Upon This
[2:25:20] Rock I will build my church and that
[2:25:23] changed the whole Bible a new Bible came
[2:25:27] out that he is the revelation of the
[2:25:30] word and he gave us many Revelations
[2:25:32] since and I'm looking forward for more
[2:25:35] and more and more to grow in Christ
[2:25:37] praise God
[2:25:41] thank you
[2:25:43] for having us and may God's blessings be
[2:25:46] richly upon you and I ask for your
[2:25:48] prayers that we can grow in Christ and
[2:25:51] keep growing and be in a witness for him
[2:25:54] in this Future Let's borrow his prayer
[2:25:57] Heavenly Father we thank you for Jesus
[2:26:01] Christ we thank you Lord for your love
[2:26:05] for us

[2:26:42] to just help us lead us guide and direct
[2:26:45] us and Lord may you bless everyone here
[2:26:49] today and help us that we can be

[2:26:52] and looking forward for your appearing
[2:26:56] to meet you in the air thank you Lord
