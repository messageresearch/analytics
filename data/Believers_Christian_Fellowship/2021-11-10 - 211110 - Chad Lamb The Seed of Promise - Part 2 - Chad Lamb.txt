[Music] [Music] you are beautiful [Music] oh [Music] [Music] amen god bless you this evening let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father for yet another privileged lord to gather

and that you would break the bread of life we're looking to you lord to come and take your place at the head of the table lord and break the bread and give it to us lord that we might eat of it lord we might see you as you are and know you better give us that portion you've allotted for this hour lord that we might have strength to be all you called us to be in this day for we love you and we give you preeminence lord take your preeminence among us we pray in jesus christ's name amen and god bless you while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to galatians chapter four i'd like to continue with the thought from sunday this will be the seed of promise part two and we'll read from galatians chapter 4. and i'm going to not do all the scripture reading that we did last night i'm just going to pull out a couple nuggets and we'll go through those as we get started but we'll start here with galatians 4 and verse 28. now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise amen i hope that means a whole lot to you amen we brethren and paul is talking to the the new testament church jew and gentiles all those that have gathered amen and by faith in jesus christ and been born again by a spirit it says now we brethren so we're included in that we brethren amen now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise that's a good place to be amen you can all have your seats keep your bibles open here to galatians let's turn back to galatians chapter three we did some lengthy bible readings on sunday but i'm just going to pull just a couple highlight scriptures out of that in galatians chapter 3 verse 6. yeah even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying indeed shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham it's amazing how the apostle paul can take the old testament and preach it in such a way that he's telling us that god already knew that the heathen would be justified by faith when he called abraham you know the the jews didn't understand this but but because he had met christ in the arabian was taught the scriptures by the lord himself by revelation paul could reach back there into the old testament that they all had and he could show his current dispensation was laying there all along he said now i read verse 7 again i'm going to read this starting in verse 6. even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness know you therefore that they which are of faith the same were the children of abraham so if you can believe like abraham believed that you're a child of abraham and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed so now when he's saying in thee shall all nations be blessed the jews would take that in a natural way and because that they were the natural seed of abraham because of their nation all nations would be blessed amen but paul's taking that scripture and he's using differently than they've used it for generations and for hundreds and hundreds of years now he's taking that and saying in you because you had the capacity to believe there is going to be a promised seed come through you abraham amen and you are justified by faith with an imputation of righteousness and your seed will have the same thing but not natural lineage a spiritual lineage of faith and that's how all nations are blessed in abraham because the promise that went to abraham would go into all nations when they would find faith the same faith that abraham had when it was found wherever it's found amen that same faith amen makes you a child of abraham so the apostle paul amen his preaching is absolutely revolutionary it's dynamic it's nothing like they had ever heard before amen amen i say that and you know why i say that i say that over and over again because brother branham came and he took the scriptures and he preached away in such a way that baffled theologians it dumbfounded all of those that had been through seminary and had been taught the scriptures and had read it a certain way and then a certain common understanding of the scriptures and brother branham comes along and takes those scriptures and uses them in such a way that absolutely bamboozles the religion of the day and and the religious leaders of the day but that's exactly what paul did and this is what he's doing here in the scriptures and he's saying indeed shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham let's turn over to verse 16. same chapter chapter 3 verse 16 now unto abraham and his seed where the promise is made he saith not unto seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ so now we're looking at the promise that's coming through the seed of abraham and he's not talking seeds because it won't be all the children of abraham because abraham had many children amen but he's coming through the seed of abraham which is christ praise god now let's look at verse 28 there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus if you be christ then are you abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise praise be to god brother of says in the message modern events may clear by prophecy it says now we are supposed to be the royal seed of abraham isaac was the natural seed but the faith seed catch that the faith seed the faith in the promised word the promised word don't miss it was that royal seed that was the seed abraham's faith we being dead in christ where abraham's seed heirs with him according to the promise so what he says here is that was the seed was abraham's faith amen abraham believed god and it was accounted unto him for righteousness and so now we're looking at a faith seed that's coming down amen brother branham goes on to say here in three kinds of believers these are two quotes that we read sunday we're just reviewing he that receiveth my words and believeth on him that sent me has already passed from death to life but can you receive the word first can you receive the word all the word all of christ christ is the anointed word he is the word anointed christ means the anointed one the anointed word for that day made manifest the savior the redeemer so lock that in as a definition of christ and never forget that we know christ is the word but brother man said christ means the anointed one the anointed word for that day made manifest amen so that is christ and that's why when we go back to verse 16 it says now to abraham and to his seed where the promise is made he saith not into seeds as many but as of one into thy seed which is christ and so it's the lineage of christ the faith seed that's coming down through that is going to be the one that's obtaining these promises and christ is the anointed word for that day made manifest let's look at this in hebrews hebrews chapter 11. verse 24 hebrews 11 and 24 by faith moses when he come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasure in egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward so this is one of those scriptures where brother branham picks he picks out the scripture and he gains an understanding of what christ or who christ is what christ is because he could see that moses was esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than all the treasures in egypt amen but but when when you come to this modern understanding of jesus christ and the manifestation of christ amen everybody when they talk about christ is talking about the dispensation when jesus came in the fullness of flesh and was a man on this earth the man from nazareth and they call that christ amen but now the apostle paul is saying that that moses esteemed the reproach of christ that was that was hundreds and hundreds of years before so christ was there back in moses day and moses could esteem the reproach of christ greater riches he could value the reproach of christ greater than all the treasures of egypt so christ was all the way back there in moses's day so this is how brother branham can make the statements that he can make amen that christ is the anointed word made manifest in that day and when moses caught the revelation of that day amen he would rather bear that reproach than all the treasures in egypt because that was christ the word may manifest in that day praise be to god i'm going to have to restart my computer so so we don't ever want to forget this this is really really important to hold on to because if we can't follow brother branham in that thinking then we're going to be lost in so many statements that he's making and we're going to misplace things in the wrong place let's go to john john chapter 1 the gospel of john chapter 1. super familiar scripture but i just want to read these together john chapter 1 verse 1. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and when we go to verse 14 it tells us in the word was made flesh and dwelt among us so the word um was part of god the word was was was god and was with god amen it was in the beginning with god and all things were made by the word and that word was life and that life was the light of men and that word was made flesh so when you look at that word coming down through you can see christ is the anointed word for that day that word as it comes into manifestation is christ is christ is christ is christ all the way down to jesus christ and when it comes in jesus christ it's all that word made flesh everything bundled into one and in that word is also the bride word so male and female is there everything is there in that manifestation so let's go to first john we'll go back past hebrews go to 1st john chapter 5. i did not finish laying my foundation on sunday so i'm still technically laying a foundation first john 5 and 7 for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost so where's christ the word the word amen what is christ that word made manifest in the day is christ amen and so that that becomes very very important brother rem says in the message turning on turn on the light in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god hebrews 13 8 he is the same yesterday today and forever we've talked about this statement before but let's think about this for a minute he's the same yesterday today and forever but when you read down through the bible amen the characters are changing the story's changing the circumstances are changing he's at one point he's working with all of mankind amen now he's working with just one family amen now he's moving on to the gentiles both jew and gentile and he's moving on to a gentile bride he's the dispensations are changing amen the characters are changing the circumstances are changing but yet he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and christ was back there amen in moses day christ was that rock that followed them through the wilderness so how is christ the same yesterday today and forever because christ is always the word made manifest in the day so whenever the words made manifest in the day that's christ amen and then we come to another dispensation and the word is made manifest that's christ we move to another dispensation and the word may manifest that's christ jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so now the test for the seed has always been the ability to believe god when he's manifesting when christ is being manifest in your day that portion of the word allotted to your day when you can catch that revelation and catch that word and identify with that it identifies you as part of that word it's the word coming to the word it's the two uniting together amen and so and so now it's been jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that's why there's so many things that i want to share my i just have so much on my heart i'm just going to trust that god will help me help me do this he said hebrews 13 8 he's the same yesterday today and forever it's the word of god always it was christ and noah it was christ and moses it was christ and david that looked up as a rejected king upon the city where 800 years later christ sat there weeping over a city being a rejected king just like david was it's always the spirit of christ so brother man was saying it was christ that was a noah that was christ that was in moses that was christ that was in david jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever but not in the same body that he was in in nazareth not in the same figure not in the same actions but he is the same because it's the word of god made manifest in that day which makes him the same in every day praise god i'm just pausing because i don't know exactly where to go amen there's so many so many things along these lines that i want to share let's start here i'm going to draw a picture brother franco if you can help me pull this up i'm going to i'm going to redraw what we drew some time ago with this this line and i'm going to label it again and then i want to break it down a little bit smaller here but while i'm doing that let's turn to first corinthians chapter 12. first corinthians chapter 12. okay first corinthians 12 and 12. for as the body is one and half many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ now paul did not say christ is like a body with many members right he's he's listen to carefully saying for as the body is one and half of many members and all the members of that one body being many or one body so also is christ so what is christ christ is a many-membered body sometimes we say a many many body and when we say a mini-member body we look at we think about the church or the bride and then christ over here and there's christ and there's a many-membered body but this is the body of christ so the life of christ goes into the body of christ and christ is a many-membered body that is the manifestation of the word for this hour christ is a many-membered body so so sometimes we get the wrong images in our mind amen by language amen so we talk about a body as if the body's here and then christ is here and this is the body of christ but in the end time they've been unified friends and now christ is a many member body so i want to serve christ in my day i want to find christ in my day whereas i want to find jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i'm telling you today christ is a mini-membered bride that is christ amen that is the manifestation of the word that is the that is christ the word made manifest the anointed word for this day praise god let's go to hebrews chapter 2. so many directions i want to go in i can't pick one hebrews chapter 2 and verse 10 hebrews 2 and 10. for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons into glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one praise god for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and the children which god hath given me amen so when he he he made the captain of our salvation which is jesus christ perfect through suffering for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one amen we all come from god we are all children of god amen i'm going to try to go back here and use this thing correctly okay before we we drew a line across here we drew the cross on the line and and i came up here and i and i just put a circle here like this and i just put the mind of god or something like that and that thoughts of god is coming down into manifestation on this line it's going back to god but not just back to his mind it's going to be going back to all that he thought in his mind before so it's not just going back to the mind of god but it's going back to the image god had his thought his perfect thought from before the foundation of the world so that redemption is running in a cycle and it's coming back to the materialization of that thought amen and so now on this line of the mind of god the thought of god when when the thought of god comes forth amen and comes into manifestation it becomes the word of god amen and the word of god is the thought of god expressed so as it comes down this line it begins to express amen it is expressed in individuals these individuals come from the thought of god let's just write on here noah abraham there's many more you can fill that that line up but what i want to what i want to show if i can just god will help me this this line coming down through here is the word it's the thoughts of god coming into manifestation it's the word adam was the word noah was the word abraham was the word if i could write it if you just let me maybe do this in my own way it may not i don't know any better way to do it than this it's also uh it's the word it's christ it's the lamb's book of life it's also the tree of life it's also the stream of life and and i hope that doesn't stumble anybody but it's the thought of god coming into manifestation in each age which is the word of god which is christ the anointed word for that day which was the eternal thought of god coming into expression because god had a plan before the foundation of the world and we know that god had mapped out his plan before the foundation of the world and it's so perfect because we know jesus christ was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world so because jesus christ was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world god foresaw that there would be a need for a lamb slain before the foundation of the world so he foresaw the fall so god understood what was going to be coming down through time and what was going to be coming into manifestations and as it was coming down it i'll just do some more drawing this half is the restoration of the bridegroom tree to here right because the masterpiece fell on the garden of eden god was going to restore first he restored the male so the old testament is the restoration of adam until we finally come to the last atom because we don't need another atom when we come to the last atom but then over on this side in the new testament we have the bride tree restoration until at the end you have the restoration of the tree of life male and female back to the garden of eden again and what is that it's all the word amen it's all christ amen and the word is life amen the word is eternal life so so i i don't mean to stumble anybody with my drawings this is just my way of explaining what i'm seeing what i'm understanding because we get images in our mind we see things like a piece of paper a book and and there's a book and and the book is is got writing on it because god had to write it down because he was going to forget who was in the book you see these are symbols for us to understand certain things i don't believe that god i don't believe that god was ever going to forget who was written in that book so i don't think he wrote it down for memory or to keep the name secure amen god foresaw what it means when you see a book a book that sealed is god already knew before the foundation of the world who is part of that word who the seed line is and he was already sealed before the foundation of the world amen so so uh god is not waiting for the seals to come off to find out who's in the book god knows who's in the book amen but when we see a book written and sealed before the foundation of the world it's showing us the symbol the symbology of that is showing us that god already knew who was in that book before the foundation of the world and so god knew where his word would fall and where it would come into manifestation where his seed would fall in what age and he predestinated which seed would fall and then where it would fall what attributes would fall in what age and what would be expressed in each age and he started um after adam fell restoring back the image of a son amen that's why the old testament is male all right and then at calvary he smote him under the rib and took out the ingredients for the female amen and he brought a bride united a bride back to him but we know she fell and there's been a restoration process through the seven church ages to restore back the bride tree to unite the two back together amen that's why the new testament is female amen so now you have the bible which brother branham called the book of redemption which is the book of life so the bible's the book of life the bible is the book of redemption right the bible is the mind of god expressed it's all the same thing and so now okay so the bible is the book of redemption right the bible amen is an expression of the mind of god it's the word of god which is an expression of the thought of god but but before the bible was written god had already declared it in the stars so god had already written it because god had already wrote his bible amen before it began to manifest on the earth it was already finished in god's mind so god put a witness in the stars that i already know what's going to happen and i've already have it determined that right so god has a lamb's book of life sealed because he already knows who his seed is okay so now then he writes it in the pyramid form so we know he's got the same thing that's in the heavens in the pyramid form now as god begins to work his plan amen what was in his mind comes into manifestation over thousands of years bit by bit as it's coming forth what is he doing on earth but he is he is writing on earth in the lives of human beings what is written in the stars and what is written in the stars what was first thought in his mind so what's in the stars is in the pyramid is now in noah before it was written in the bible so that makes noah living word amen and then after noah would live the word amen abraham would live the word moses would live the word amen then god would tell moses to write it down so moses wrote down what was expressed in living word what was god doing he wrote his bible in the heavens he wrote his bible in the pyramid but he's been writing his bible through human life and through the stream of human life has been coming the christ seed the faith seed been moving down through and god is writing his bible in the lives of his children that's why when we get to this day we're written epistles living epistles written of god so so we we've been taught so many things brother venomous shared with us so many things and he'll use all kinds of language all kinds of terminology all kinds of ways of describing but he's describing the same thing over and over again with different terms with different terminologies with different analogies with different parts of the scriptures but it's all telling us the same story that that there has been a a thought that god had something he wanted to achieve a desire that god had as an expression and the entire bible this is what brother brahm tells us in christ is the mystery of god revealed the entire bible is what is expressing what god has wanted to achieve what's the entire bible expressing the entire bible is expressing the thought he had before the foundation of the world when there wasn't a molecule or a speck of stardust or anything else amen god had a plan he had an idea he had a design of expression where he would express himself and as he expressed himself he would become he would become from invisible to visible he would become from uh intangible to tangible and as he was expressing himself he was becoming amen and becoming what was he becoming he was becoming a family he was becoming himself in multiple form amen so that he could fellowship with his attributes his attributes with him his attributes with one another amen as god was writing his bible and living epistles and living uh human beings what was he doing he was expressing himself god was becoming his thought was now coming into manifestation oh praise god all right let's try this see if i can do this praise god it worked all right let's go back to our line i always draw calvary in here one it's a it's a good uh differentiation between old testament new testament but also because that we would come in a fallen condition because of what adam did and because we were coming in the flesh and now our flesh was hybrid and fallen amen there had to be a price paid for everything on this line amen and for everything that would be uh associated with everything on this line let's just put it that way so everything that god created fell amen in this in this creation and this dispensation fell when adam fell and everything that fell when adam fell when christ came as the last adam and shed his blood he redeemed back everything so he purchased back everything and that's why you always have to have a calvary no matter where you are on the line you have to have a calvary so when you were all the way back amen when you were all the way back here okay when you're all the way back here and noah's dispensation you have to have a calvary that didn't look good noah's dispensation you have to have a calvary but noah wasn't alive for calvary but noah amen could receive the word of god for his day and when noah received the word of god for his day he became the expression of that word for his day and he connected himself with the life of that word and when he connected himself by receiving the word and manifesting the word he became connected to that word amen and as that word's moving down through then you have you know an abraham abraham needs a calvary moses needs a calvary david needs a calvary they all need a calvary amen but none of them are here amen to actually watch jesus die at calvary and say i believe that word amen but what they did is they believed christ and received christ in their day and when they received christ they attached himself to the life of that word the life of christ that was moving down through they caught it in their age and now when all of that life is bottled up into one human being amen what noah attached himself to and what moses attached and tells you what abraham attached himself to and what david attached himself to was now standing in the sacrifice all of that word was in him and so everything that was represented in the thought of god in the word of god was in jesus christ and when he paid the price of redemption he redeemed everything that was connected to that line now listen i don't want to stumble you but i'm just going to write this over here i was on that line too now that line hadn't come into expression yet that's what's happening now but i was in christ when christ was here because if i'm part of the word and part of the thought and part of the lamb's book of life i had to be in that expression of flesh when the word was made flesh and that's what brother branham tells us we don't have to pay for our sins because i already paid for my sins when i was in him on the cross so in the thought of god remember god is the one who invented time time means nothing to god when we stretch out a timeline we say this happened first and this happened next and then this happened and way over here thousands of years later they'll come a chad they'll come up brother bob they'll come brother brian they'll all be down here amen and we don't know what's going to happen to them till we get down over here that's not how god thinks amen when god looked down on calvary hey listen god didn't have to wait to look down on calvary to know that you and i would be redeemed before there was a molecule he looked down on calvary and when he looked down on calvary back then he saw you and i all bundled up into that word amen because that word was the very life of god made manifest in this world and he was given created blood and that blood was shed for you and i and it was shed for everyone that was in that thought so although i wasn't there to stand at calvary and say i believe that i'm standing over here a couple thousand years later and i still believe it because that's christ but remember oh praise god there has to be a christ in my day too and i've got to be connected to that christ right and if i'm connected to this christ i'm connected to this christ but what if i refuse my connection to christ and i will not receive the life of christ the manifest word in my day how am i linked to calvary so let's go back here so when we were looking at the the book of life if i could just draw an arrow here and say this is the lamb's book of life or the life of the lamb as it's coming down through in each dispensation it's the word made manifest which was the life of the lamb it's made manifest in each age and each dispensation now all around this line are all kinds of names we already took off abraham we had the three brothers who were in a coalition with him right off david we had he had a friend hiram who was also solomon's friend and helped him build the temple we come down through here and we've got you know peter we've got paul we've got uh seven church ages and the messengers and all the true seed in those seven church ages we've got them all down through there but attached to all them like we took paul and we we talked about the centurion that saved his life there was a centurion that saved his life in jerusalem when they were beating him there was another centurion that took care of him along the journey to rome amen and provided for him to continue in his ministry and protected his life there and obeyed him and all these other things so so there was people associated with paul amen we came down here i'm just going to draw it again we had demas well sorry demas demas was a fellow minister associated with him and in the ministry and through the seven church ages you had you had all kinds of individuals all kinds of names that were associated to this right all the way down through don't try to read those because there's nothing there but but what we're showing is they were they were they were uh attached to or an association amen with that life of christ it was coming down through and that's why this is this is ties in with the being seed of abraham because when you go to genesis chapter 12 in genesis chapter 12 amen god comes to abraham and says amen he comes to abraham and i want to i want to ask you this question what did abraham do to get god's attention what did abraham do did he build a temple did he i mean what record do we have that abraham did anything to get god to come down all we know is abraham was living like everybody else was living he was doing what everybody else was doing in life and god come and said abraham amen i want you to leave here and i want you to go to a place i tell you to go to i'm choosing you amen it had nothing to do with abraham it had everything to do with god and the thought he had of abraham before the foundation of the world it didn't matter at that time how many idols abraham was worshiping it didn't matter what abraham was doing amen because abraham was a thought of god a gene of god from before the foundation of the world that was expressing in the day he was living and god had to get him and move him into position because he was part of the plan of redemption he was part of the book so god comes to him amen of no merit of his own that's why amen when you when we come to this revelation of abraham and abraham's seed and you see how god called abraham it should help us relax so much because we're always struggling with am i good enough am i good enough am i good enough and abraham wasn't good enough abraham was foreknown by god god didn't come to abraham because abraham was good enough god came to abraham because god already knew there would be an abraham abraham was the next expression on that line amen and there had to be abraham coming his season come in his time or else the rest of christ would not unfold so he's got to get abraham and he's got to get abraham in position amen with no abraham the plan stops because remember it was already finished in the mind of god and it's already written in the stars of heaven and it's already in stone in the pyramid so now god can't do anything else but get abraham in position because god is not rearranging the stars if the plan is fixed from before the foundation of the world he's not unsealing the book unrolling it and rearranging the names amen and the portion of the book of life called the lamb's book of life it was fixed and sealed before the foundation of the world so because of that god comes to abraham not on the merits of abraham but on the merits of god his thought and his word expressed so he gives abraham and and he brings abraham into position but when he brings abraham into this position there's a great dispensational change that's taking place because before god had he hadn't selected out an individual people or an individual nation god was had all humanity and one lump amen and he was he was dealing with them and when he saw that the corruption of man was was uh wicked and his thoughts were evil all the time and the imagination of his hearts were evil he was going to destroy all of mankind is that true he was going to destroy not just mankind he was going to destroy everything off the earth he was going to stall the earth he was going to destroy everything is that true but then he found one do you think he just found him or do you think he already knew he was there amen and he found noah righteous in all the earth amen and he takes noah and noah is righteous and we know righteousness is imp imputed righteousness because noah believed god and the evidence that noah believed god was that gigantic ark behind him so noah was righteous in his generation amen and so noah amen was critical to the plan of god going forth because god in his justice has got to destroy the earth amen but he finds one in this righteous line one in this seed one on the uh one part of his word a part of his thought that's on the earth an expression of the lamb's book of life an expression of christ is it okay if i use all those terms and he finds that and now what did i do with my pen oh it's up here now through noah because of now of noah the earth is saved because there was an attribute of god on earth because there was an attribute from the book of life because there was part of god's thought god's seed on the earth at that time god could work through that individual and that individual would become salvation to the earth and salvation to the creation because all the animals were going to die without the ark and all humanity would die without the ark and the birds would die without that ark amen so noah coming and expressing christ in his day the word amen he obeyed the word and he created the ark which was the manifestation of the word of god and that manifestation of the word of god became salvation to creation that's why i say that this line is the lamb's book of life then that which is associated around that i'm gonna draw my my circle again is the book of life now just follow me in this thought brother benham says there's a portion or a section of the book of life that's called the lamb's book of life he says it's all the lamb's book of life he has all these different terminologies he said it looks like it's two books but it's really not it's one book but in this book is a record of the seed and that's that red line and all that's on that line now coming down through you can't as it's coming down through you can't tell that's the seed because you all you see is abraham all you see is noah you see is moses but you don't see the life that's working down through that so back behind it i'll say it this way back behind moses was a life of christ behind abraham was the life of the word or the life of christ amen behind david was christ behind all of this was christ and you saw when you looked you saw a man you saw no one you saw moses and you saw abraham and you saw david and you saw these men but you didn't realize that that was god writing in flesh that same bible he wrote in the heavens and we saw flash but we didn't see christ until the opening of the seals and when the seals open we recognize where christ was all along amen because god was writing his word in the lives of flesh human beings who were manifesting that word god was writing his bible remember what we have here came after it was expressed on the earth or after the prophet gave us prophecy then it was recorded after amen after paul's ministry began paul began to write epistles right right so they were writing it was happening it happened then moses wrote what happened so so this is a record of god manifesting his word in human beings that's our bible so you could say that that line is the bible is that right yes so all that's around that associated with that amen just like in noah's dispensation because of noah it could receive life i'll say it maybe i'll word it differently if you take the book of life that circle i draw and take out the seed life you have no life and all the same names will be there but if you take out the seed life there's no life but in the lamb's book of life because there's a section of the record of the seed which is the mind of god which is the thought of god which are the attributes of god which are the seed genes of god which is god himself broken up into forms because that's contained in the book of life now everything in the book of life can have life because of the stream of life that's in the book of life but if you take the stream of life out there's no life i hope you understand so i hope you don't think that i'm just just off my rocker but then those who are re those who are saved in the book of life who are not necessarily the seed gene of god the seed thought of god amen they're coming in under a covenant that god made with abraham because now when he chose abraham listen for no good earthly reason he chose abraham there was no good earthly reason for him to choose abraham there was a good heavenly reason but there was no good earthly reason but he chose abraham and before abraham could do anything before abraham obeyed his first commandment god said hey let's go to let's go to genesis 12 and just read it let's go to genesis 12. because i don't want to just quote it i want to read it together genesis 12 verse 1 now the lord had said unto abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee god had god had already showed him this before because this is what he said the lord had said but before he could fully obey that tyra his dad took him and lot and took him from ur up to hiran amen and so brother bam tells us he didn't fully obey the voice of god because he went with his daddy and went with a lot and so now tyra dies amen but then it tells us tyra dies here at the end of chapter 11 but chapter 12 says now the lord had said the lord's not saying again it's telling us what the lord had said before this was before abraham obeyed are you with me before abraham obeyed the word the scripture says now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed praise god amen that that covenant with abraham is a new kind of covenant that god has not made yet before amen he had a covenant with adam if you don't eat this amen it'll be fine if you eat this you'll die adam broke the covenant he made a covenant with noah amen noah couldn't keep the covenant the generation after noah they went to build the tower of babel and started a false religion and started all of this stuff and god come down and because he swore he would never destroy all flesh again amen he couldn't destroy him in the tower of babel so what he did was confounded their languages and separated them and after he confounded their languages and separated them he pulls out one and he says i'm going to start redemption right here and he tells abraham you're going to be for a blessing and i will bless them that bless you and curse them that curse you and we are still under that same blessing all the royal seed from that day on the faith seed from that day on are under that blessing and that has everything to do with the book of life right because when we get up here to demas when demas forsook paul when demons forsook paul his name was removed from the book of life we know that right here we had judah or judas judas walked with jesus was a partaker in the ministry a true ministry gifts of healing we know all of that his name was in the book of life but because he cursed christ and fought against christ his name was removed from the book of life well whose names remained brother branham said like nicodemus and gamaliel who helped the children of israel in a time and stood up for them what did gamaliel do remember when they were persecuting the christians after the resurrection of jesus christ after pentecost they were persecuting the christians and gamaliel said leave them alone he said if it's of god you'll find yourself fighting god if if it's not it'll come to not that's all he did and brother branham said perhaps it's gamalia and nicodemus that are those that have their names on the book of life because he stood up for the elect of god what was he standing up for he wasn't standing up for peter he wasn't standing up for john he was standing up for that life that was in peter that life that was in paul and and nicodemus too who was a help and and and stood up for jesus in the council and he said something like is it right amen to persecute a man without a trial first or condemn a man with no trial and they looked at him and said are you one of his disciples too he stood up for christ and brother branham used those two as an example who could be in the book of life and so you realize if christ was not expressed in that day what would those two men do to have a chance at life i hope you follow me you take the lamb's book of life and you remove the record of the seed there's no life but because of the record of the seed now there's a chance for life and well i just don't know any other way to say it just say it that way so now what are you doing here on this earth amen under the blessing of abraham you're here to be a blessing amen there's a manifestation of christ in this day amen and not everybody is is ordained in the foreknowledge of god to be part of that seed life amen but because god started dealing amen with humanity in a certain way under abraham amen now there's a blessing that can come under that covenant which we're still part of there's a blessing that can come amen to those that will bless that life amen but there's a curse that will come to those that will curse that life so now we see that the the those in the book of life they receive life because of their association or their conduct or action towards the record of life of the record of the lamb's life god's life the life of the seed that's contained in the book of life that's what gives them life because brother brahma tells us that they don't already have eternal life only that seed that's on that line are the only ones that already possess eternal life but they're they're allowed to come into eternal life at the white throne judgment based off what they did with the word that they came in contact with amen so praise be to god where do we go from here oh let's draw another picture so let's go back to this line i'm just going to be on this half so when we come to abraham god is he is writing on earth in the life of abraham what he's already written in the stars in heaven and so now as abraham's moving whatever's happening to abraham god is watchful over abraham's life he knows what's happening with abraham because it's critical what happens to abraham is critical to god's plan of redemption the restoration of the masterpiece and and so god's eye is on abraham because what happens to abraham matters oh my goodness there is no way we're going to get anywhere close all right i'm going to read this quote this is really familiar we've been reading this for quite some time out of crisis the mystery god revealed he says now you see the seals when he was in his mediator work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him so that's what was expressed in each day or each age the words in the book and all that's in that book would be him all right all right let's go to genesis chapter 12 or we're here in genesis chapter 12. let's go to verse 10. i'm going to try to finish up with this thought here and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into egypt to so join there for the famine was grievous in the land and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into egypt that he said unto sarah his wife behold now i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon therefore it shall come to pass when the egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is the this is his wife and they will kill me but they will save thee alive say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee and it came to pass that when abram was coming to egypt that the egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair and the princes also of pharaoh saw her and commended her before pharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaoh's house and he entreated abram well for her sake and he had sheep and oxen and asses and men servants and maidservants and shias and camels and the lord plagued pharaoh in his house with great plagues because of sarai abram's wife and pharaoh called abram and said what is this that thou has done unto me why does thou not tell me that she is thy wife why said thou she is my sister so i might have taken her to be my wife now therefore behold behold thy wife take her and go thy way and pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all that he had now when we look at this story we see we see that abraham now goes down into egypt which is a place he's not supposed to be because god told him to sojourn in that land and the land of promise but he left because the time of famine he went down into egypt to sojourn in egypt and while he was there he tells his wife we read the whole story and so pharaoh takes her into his home amen and then god begins to curse pharaoh with plagues now pharaoh didn't know he was doing anything wrong and abraham wasn't abram that i wasn't doing anything right but god already had a plan written in the stars which came from the thought in his mind before the foundation of the world which was reflected in the stars which was reflected in that pyramid and god can't change his plan and that plan comes down here on the plan that part of abraham is sarah they're connected together they are one in the mind of god and out of this union is going to come in isaac because isaac is in the stars because isaac was in god's mind because isaac was on the lam's book of life so he was in the stars so he's in the pyramid so isaac has to come forth from abraham and sarah so god god is not looking down there and saying oh poor sarah she don't want to be in that fix i feel sorry for sarah it's not that kind of thought god is protecting his own word amen god is watching after his word and he's guarding his word and he's plaguing pharaoh because of his word amen it wasn't that pharaoh was such a rotten guy and did a horrible thing pharaoh hadn't done anything wrong as far as he knew but god was watching over his word because that word can't change he's the same yesterday today and forever god has to bring forth his word so isaac has to come forth from the bowels of abraham through sarah his lawful wife these two have already become one in the mind of god and now from there has to come isaac so god is protecting sarah not because he felt sorry for sarah he's protecting sarah because of his word so so then oh praise god let's keep going let's go to genesis 20. i want to do this quickly last time i told you how long i was going to preach and i'm not going to do that anymore because it just makes me say things that aren't true and i feel guilty afterwards and i have to repent i'm just not even going to do that but there's just you just bear with me for a few minutes there's a really important thought i want to get to and share with you before we move on genesis 20 and verse 1 and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and dwelled between kadish and sure and and sojourned in gerar and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister and abimelech king of gerard sent and took sarah but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to him behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou hast taken for she is a man's wife and abimelech had not come near her and he said lord will thou slay also a righteous nation said he not unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother and the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have i done this and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me he did not stop abimelech from sinning against sarah that's not why he came down to him in a dream that's not why he smote them with curses and closed their wombs because that had already taken place at this time he had he had come down to speak to him in a dream abimelech was not what abraham was abraham was the seed line abimelech was not but abimelech was righteous because he wasn't doing this intentionally and because abimelech was righteous god came to him and said you're but a dead man you're under a curse the wounds are already shut up in your nation and you're going to die because you've taken a man's wife and he says you know the integrity of my heart he told me he lied to me and god says i know the integrity of your heart that's why i kept you from sinning against me what was he doing he was protecting his word because isaac had to come from sarah and abraham amen and so abimelech didn't know it but bhimalek was standing in opposition to the word of god he was going to hinder the word he was going to stop the word he was going to derail the word so god comes down supernaturally injects himself into the situation because he has to manifest what's in his mind he has to manifest what's written in the last book of life he has to manifest what's written in the stars do you get what i'm saying so now god has to come down he has to play he has to warn he has to speak because he's got to preserve this womb because it's this is his plan and from there the word is coming forth to stop that word from coming forth brings a curse and brings death even though abimelech wasn't aware of it even though pharaoh wasn't aware of it they weren't doing it intentionally but to come against the word even unintentionally will bring death because the word is life and to come against life is death so the movement of life in that day was coming from abraham through sarah unto isaac and that was the movement of life and to stop that would bring death and curses upon you so god was coming down to protect his word god i want to read one more let's go to genesis 22. i hope this gets clearer and clearer and clearer genesis 22 and 6 and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and isaac spoken to abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for the burnt offering and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i he said lay not thine hand upon the land neither do thou anything unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing that thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son for me and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son and abraham called the name of the place jehovah jireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen let's turn over to hebrews chapter 11. hebrews chapter 11 and verse 17. hebrews 11 17 by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall all the seed be called accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him and a figure listen abraham was given a commission abraham's told to go and kill isaac but abraham is a seed of faith abraham received isaac as from the dead with a pro by a promise and he knows that god has said in isaac so thy seed be called and that is the word of god that cannot change so now this is the word of god and he's told to go and kill isaac so abraham by this stage in his journey he's learned not to question he's learned to obey so he's going in obedience and as they're walking up in obedience he's taking his son he's taking the fire he's taking the wood he's got everything for a sacrifice and isaac looks and says dad we've got everything for a sacrifice and he says listen he says where is the lamb and he says god shall provide himself a lamb amen what is he saying god has to take care of this amen i'm going up here he's going up with every intention of slaying his son but hebrews tells us that he believed that god even if he slays him god can raise him up from the dead because he knows that in isaac shall thy seed be called isaac must live god cannot kill his own word isaac's not just abraham's son isaac is the manifested word of god and the seed of abraham was going to be called through isaac isaac cannot stay dead isaac's got to come back to life and that's the faith that abraham goes to mount moriah with he so knew that god had preserved sarah stopped him in pharaoh's house stopped him in a bemalex house and he knew that this is the promised seed that in isaac shall thy seed be called not in ishmael but in isaac and he knew by this stage in the journey he has come to perfect faith and he knows now that god's word will never fail and that even if i slay him god will raise him up from the dead because in isaac shall my seed be called so he's going there with a heart perfect in faith and perfect obedience to god not knowing what will happen but believing god will raise him up so what did god do i want to ask you a question did god provide abraham a ram and the thickets no he did not god provided himself a ram and the thickets that ram was not for abraham and that ram was not for isaac that ram was for god amen because god cannot kill his own word amen he's got to offer a substitute and he offers the substitute because he's already said in isaac shall thy seed be called god provided himself a lamb is that what the scripture says here's what brother branham says about that and possessing the gate of the enemy after the trial did you ever think where did the ram come from remember the country is full of lions and wolves and jackals and the sheep devouring beast and how far back from civilization was he and then up on top of the mountain where there is no water and he had picked up the stones all around to make the altar where did that ram come from but it wasn't a vision he killed the ram it had blood what did he say god is able to provide for himself a sacrifice god was preserving his word with this he created a ram in the thickets to preserve his word he supernaturally injected himself into the situation amen to preserve the word oh praise be the god he said how are you going to come out of that chair how is that child going to get well are you from that chair are you from there you heart you with the heart trouble whatever's the matter god is able to provide himself amen abraham believed that the patriarch stayed true to the promise and he gave the promise that your seed because you believed my word and regardless of what the circumstances your seed shall possess the gate of the enemy why every enemy that come up is a figure against abraham the enemy of she's too old i'm too old all this and everything else he still stayed right true to that promise now the man that possesses that faith still will take god's word regardless of circumstances now if you can't do that then you're not abraham's seed that's the faith that abraham had his seed abraham was so convinced that god would keep his word and that isaac was a manifestation of that word he was going up there to obey god he was not going to disobey god he was going to obey god and when isaac asked him the question where's the lamb he said god will provide for himself a lamb i don't know and he even believed when we read hebrews he even believed in himself that if he slayed him god would raise him up from the dead but one thing abraham did not believe is he did not believe that isaac would die and stay dead because he believed the word of god and that was the word for that hour and god injected himself in the situation provide oh praise god down here we got a bride that bride is the manifestation of the promised word for this hour she is part of the book of life she is a record of that seed she is the restored tree of life as the bride tree she is all of those things listen do you believe that do you believe you're part of that then nothing can defeat that in your life it's not because god feels sorry for you it's not because you have a sweet disposition and god feels sorry for you so he's going to heal you and he's going to deliver you and he's going to provide for you god is watching after his word in you amen how many times in your life has god supernaturally injected himself in your situation to stop you from something to heal you to deliver you to change the circumstances supernaturally what was that it wasn't god feeling sorry for you it was god watching over the dispensation of his word for this hour you have to be here you have to do whatever the stars say you're going to do you have to do it here do you believe one of those stars represent you amen do you believe that you're in the lamb's book of life do you believe that you were in the thoughts of god and he already forced all you would do then you're going to do it in no plan of the devil nothing you can decide or anybody else can decide will ever stop that plan from moving forward god will supernaturally inject himself into the situation he'll change kingdoms he'll move circumstances he will move mountains literally to keep that word progressing forward oh like i said before there's so much of my heart i'm just going to wrap up with this thought we take this thought and we look at the apostle paul as the apostle paul was coming down through he was the manifestation of the word for that day he was an old testament prophecy of you shall be enlightened to the gentiles and he had to go to the gentiles and he had to take the message of grace he was the vessel nobody else was how many times did god inject himself in the situation to rescue paul because paul had to keep manifesting what was already written in god's mind what was in the land's book of life what was in the story you get the point you can't rearrange the stones in the pyramid you can't move the stars around so what does god have to do he comes down and injects himself in the situation amen to keep his plan moving forward but listen god also did not encase paul in a bubble and nothing ever happened to paul paul was beaten paul was stoned and left for dead but it was god who raised him back up paul was put in prison but it was god who opened the doors paul was besieged in the city but it was god who helped him get over the wall and escape amen it was demon forces that tried to sink a ship in a storm amen but it was god who preserved his life through the sunken ship amen it was a devil that caused the snake to bite him in the hand but it was god who kept him from having any effect of the venom and shook it off paul was bitten beaten paul was bitten paul was hungry amen paul was rejected paul was he was beaten with whips he was beaten with rods god didn't encase him in a bubble and say nothing's ever going to happen to you neither did he brother branham but when brother branham was shot god saved his life when he had an amoeba that would take his life god healed him why there was a plan there was he was expressing of god's word of god's thought and that had to come to fruition god had to inject himself on the scene amen and this isn't a perfect life like i'm the word of god i'm an expressed word of god nothing will touch me you'll get sick you'll get tired you'll be in a car wreck you'll lose money is that right did that happen to brother branham was he in a tax case was he shot was he sick did he get rejected did he get the asian flu did he have people steal his property why didn't god stop all of that amen it's all part of god's plan god's molding his character he's manifesting i don't know what all he's doing god is doing something but any time that prophet gets into a life-threatening situation that'll end the manifestation of god god turns it around heals him restores him delivers him moves him forward nothing will stop the plan of god from moving forward nothing can conve defeat god's word but that same prophet who was delivered and delivered and delivered died in a car crash that same prophet apostle paul who was saved out of shipwreck saved from the snake bite saved from the beatings saved from the mobs he was beheaded in rome because until your purpose is fulfilled in this earth you can't leave this earth and anything that will hinder your purpose in manifesting your portion of the word god has got to move it out of the way so that you can continue to manifest the word i mean we get the wrong concept of being a child of god on the wrong concept of being in the word we get this concept and now i don't know why i'm suffering with the sickness if i can just get over there maybe i'm not even a believer cast that devil off of you amen and read your bible god doesn't insulate his word god doesn't insulate the vessels carrying his word from any trouble amen even jesus got tired in his earthly ministry brother branham said he groaned with a headache so god is not here to we're the word and he insulates us and packs you know downy feathers all around and nothing this is the life of the word nothing bad ever happens to them no we're all subject to this life and there's a learning process that comes through being subject to this life and coming into a cursed fallen condition so that we can learn redemption we can learn healing we can learn salvation we can learn deliverance so that we can know god like we could never know god any other way and god is not going to take all that from us because that also serves a purpose but the troubles don't define us the troubles only mold us and push us into expression but anything that would stop the progress of god's word god will defeat it every time and so the reason i'm saying all of this is so that we can relax do you believe that you were in the mind of god before the foundation of the world and you're part of this bride in this last day and i'm going to tell you to relax god's got it all under control have faith and believe god if something's going to take your life say it's not going to take my life unless god's purpose will be done on this earth that devil's got to go i don't believe god's done with me i believe i got more life that thing has got to go but remember when the apostle paul got to the end of his life he wasn't dreading death apostle paul said i've run my race i finished my course now there's a crown of life waiting for me he was he was happy to move on and i tell you if a seed or attribute of god has come to the end of his manifestation on this earth why does he want to stay here any longer let's move on let's not be afraid of anything let's not be worried about anything let's commit it to god and keep moving forward because we're here to express the life we're here to be the manifestation of the word don't let anything trip you up stumble you stop you amen climb over it and keep moving on god will inject himself supernaturally to stop anything from hindering the word just keep moving forward friends the promises of abraham are upon you because we're abraham's faith seed the promises the blessings of abraham are all here amen that line of life is still moving here god is still doing something there's still something to be expressed and nothing is going to stop that expression amen so now we need to start praying with faith saying god i believe your word that by your stripes i'm healed and this thing is hindering me and being what you called me to be i say pray with faith pray with understanding pray knowing amen that that we are what god has called us to be we're here for a purpose amen and nothing can enter that anything that's hindering it he's got to take care of it don't be afraid don't be fearful don't let your mind wander when troubles come just read the bible troubles always come look at joseph he had lots of troubles hated of his brothers thrown into a pit sold into slavery goes into potiphar's house lied about cast back in the prison forgotten there for years is that right but was any of that not according to the program of god and could any of that stop the vision that god had showed him in the dream from coming to pass where he would be lifted up on high and the sun and moon would bow to him and the eleven sheeps would bow to him nothing could stop that because that was already written in the stars so when he goes down he's still not defeated when he comes up he's not defeated he goes back down he's still not defeated because there's already been a dream given of the mind of god and nothing can stop it from coming to pass when he's in the prison he's still the word to be expressed he still has got to be exalted at some point god has got a plan for you and i there is a plan for this bride in the end time and nothing is going to stop it nothing will stop the manifestation of jesus christ and bride forming this day if there's anything in our lives that are holding us back or hindering it i would curse that thing in the name of jesus christ and commit it to god and i would tell god this thing is a this thing is shackles on my ankles lord holding me back from what i believe you called me to be and what you've called me to express and i'm asking in the name of jesus christ by the blood that was shed at calvary that purchased for me healing and redemption and deliverance i pray that you would remove it for me so that i can run free to manifest this word see too many times we're praying our own will our own desire i don't want to feel sick anymore i don't want to feel bad anymore i want to have more blessings i want to have more money i want to do this amen but that's not the right image the right image is god i'm here for a purpose i'm here to manifest your life and this thing is hindering me would you remove it so i can run the race amen amen brother said if you say you want to be healed what do you want to be healed for what are you going to do once you're healed are you going to waste it on on selfish living or you want to be healed for the kingdom work amen once we dial in our understanding to realize i am here for a purpose god foresaw me here before the foundation of the world there's a portion of the manifestation of christ for me to portion out and live in this day amen if there's anything that's stopping that i am going to condemn it i'm going to curse it i'm going to stand against it in the name of jesus christ because it's stopping me from staying in my posted duty god's called you to be a mother and there's something hindering you i say cast it down in the name of jesus christ say god you called me to nurture these children and raise them and this thing is afflicting me attacking me i curse it lord so that i continue to do what you called me to do if you're a daddy who god has called to provide for a child amen and sickness is striking you i would curse that thing in the name of jesus christ and say god you've called me to be a father of these children you've placed them under my care and i need healing i need help to go and work i need a job i i need this situation amen what are we doing amen we're here amen to be an expression of that book of life and nothing can stop that expression nothing can hinder that until our time is done and when our time is done who wants to stay anyhow if god has done and you're you've done all that he foresaw in his mind for you to do and all that was written in your star and the position it was in and it's done all that it was to do who wants to stay anyhow i just want to do what he's called me to do in this age and i want to understand that just as god was watching over abraham watching over you just as much as he saw when abraham went down to pharaoh's house and something was going to stop that word just as much as he watched pharaoh he's watching you i'm watching abraham he watching you just as much as he protected that woman sarah he's protecting you just as much as he watched abraham amen when abraham went down to gerrard he had his eyes on that situation i mean he let it go so far and when it got to the point where it was about to go wrong he injected himself and he took care of it he'll do the same thing for you how many of you can say you've seen god do that in your life supernaturally inject himself to turn you into a direction to stop something to bring deliverance to bring a healing why did he do it because you had pretty blue eyes and because you had the nicest smile he did it because of he's watching over his word he's keeping us because of his word he's watching over his word that's why i say it's good to be his word it's good to be part of that lamb's book of life god bless you let's all stand so many more things that's on my heart to share but we'll just pray that god will help us come sunday with that oh the more that i read the more i read the bible the more it comes alive amen the more we read the message the more we go back to the bible we're seeing it here and here and here it's it's everywhere this whole bible has been unlocked friends and what a blessing that is if you can find yourself by faith seed of abraham then we should be so so settled that god is watching over us let's bow our heads in thinking lord jesus i thank you lord for the privilege you've given us of being here at this day god for the eyes that you've given us to see in the ears that you've given us to hear god

began to reveal your plan and begin to show us your plan lord and god we're so grateful lord that we can find ourselves by faith part of that plan god you've watched over us all of our lives you've brought us to this hour and we have absolute confidence you'll finish the work that you started now you're writing your words still you're manifesting the written word you're manifesting what was already in your mind you're displaying it lord in this world and you're going to watch over that and nothing will stop it god help us to be surrendered in a greater way give ourselves completely over to you we love your father we ask that you would take us as we go from here and go walking in this world lord would you just watch over us god anything that's hindering your children i pray you'd move it out of the way god anything that's holding them back from being that expression of the word you've ordained for this hour may you quicken their faith lord may they realize that this thing is hindering me in my expression of christ i cast it down in jesus name god i pray that you set them free lord you could have that expression you desired to have in this day we love you father and we ask that you would bless us keep us lord let us serve your purpose on this earth in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you friends i'm resting on the finished work jesus christ today circumstances
