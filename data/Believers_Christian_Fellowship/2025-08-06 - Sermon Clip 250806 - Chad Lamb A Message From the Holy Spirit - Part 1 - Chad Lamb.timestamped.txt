[0:00] Why did he give himself for the church?
[0:03] That's verse 25. That he might sanctify
[0:06] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[0:08] by the word. That he might present it to
[0:10] himself a glorious church, not having
[0:13] spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but
[0:15] that it should be holy and without
[0:16] blame. So he gave himself so that he
[0:19] could sanctify and cleanse his church by
[0:22] his word by the washing of the water by
[0:25] the word so that he could present to
[0:27] himself a glorious church without spot
[0:30] or wrinkle or blemish or any such thing.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; He did it. He did it himself and he did
[0:35] it for himself. He will have a virgin
[0:38] bride. He will have a virgin bride. He
[0:41] will have a virgin bride
[0:44] &gt;&gt; when in the end time. Where do we live?
[0:46] in the end time. How what's the
[0:48] mechanism he's going to do it? He's
[0:50] going to give himself and shed his own
[0:52] blood, pay the price of redemption and
[0:54] have a sanctifying power by the shedding
[0:56] of blood so that he can sanctify a
[0:57] people. So that he can come and live
[0:59] inside of them. So that he can wash all
[1:01] their wrong all their errors and
[1:04] prostitution and all of this
[1:06] hybridization so he can wash it away
[1:08] with the washing of water by the word.
[1:10] So that he can finally after the washing
[1:13] of the word present to himself. Yes,
[1:16] &gt;&gt; a glorious
[1:19] &gt;&gt; glorious
[1:21] church
[1:22] &gt;&gt; not having spot or wrinkle
[1:25] &gt;&gt; or any such thing but be holy and
[1:28] without blemish.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31] If I tell you that you better be
[1:35] spotless and without wrinkle
[1:39] or any such thing and that you should be
[1:42] holy without blemish, it'd be like
[1:44] popping your bubble. Friends, just let
[1:46] the air out. I can't do that. But he
[1:48] didn't say anything about the bride
[1:50] doing this.
[1:52] This is all him doing it. What do I have
[1:55] to do to stay in this place where I am
[1:58] made spotless and without wrinkle or any
[2:00] such thing and without blemish and holy
[2:02] and presented to him a glorious church?
[2:04] What do I have to do? All I have to do
[2:05] is stay under the pouring out of the
[2:08] water because it's the washing of the
[2:10] water of the word that's doing the work.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14] &gt;&gt; We are the most blessed people that have
[2:16] ever walked the face of this earth.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not my trying. It's not my
[2:22] effort. It's not my this, it's not my
[2:25] that. It's 100% if I can just stay in
[2:28] this message that he has. It's a pure
[2:30] clean water to wash away all the
[2:32] prostitute spirits, all the filth of the
[2:34] denominational agent, all the wrong of
[2:36] our hybridization and wrong thinking and
[2:37] the things that we're born with. It's
[2:39] the word that is washing it all away,
[2:41] planting inside us the very mind and
[2:43] life of Jesus Christ to watch so he can
[2:45] present to himself cuz he wants a bride.
[2:47] He wants a virgin bride. He wants to
[2:49] reproduce himself on the earth. Amen. He
[2:52] wants to do it. And he's doing it. And
[2:54] he sent everything he needs to
[2:56] accomplish it with. He brought back the
[2:58] fullness of the word, a pure, clean word
[3:01] with no error in it whatsoever. And he
[3:03] brought back with the word the fullness
[3:05] of his spirit the power to manifest this
[3:07] word. And he has through this message
[3:09] supplied everything that we have need
[3:11] of. All we've got to do is stay under
[3:13] it, friends.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; Don't tamper with it. Don't try to
[3:17] figure it out. Just stay under it. And
[3:19] anything he wants you to know, he'll
[3:21] reveal it to you.
