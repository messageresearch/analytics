[0:00] listen it can't last much
[0:04] longer it's not going to last
[0:06] forever whatever you're going through it
[0:09] can't last much
[0:11] longer just think about it life is only
[0:14] 80 90
[0:16] years it won't last forever whatever
[0:19] you're going through it'll
[0:21] end the trial you in and I don't know
[0:24] anybody who's been through an 80 90e
[0:27] trial they start and they end
[0:30] they start mysteriously sometimes they
[0:32] end
[0:33] mysteriously but no matter where you are
[0:35] in the journey it's going to end it's
[0:37] this is not going to last forever and
[0:39] we're at the end time when for all of us
[0:41] it's going to end there's an end there's
[0:44] a there there's a goal there's a mark
[0:46] there's a prize there's something to win
[0:48] there's a prize at the end of this board
[0:50] we just need to ride down it and don't
[0:52] worry about who all fell off before but
[0:54] they were better Christians than me and
[0:56] they fell they were better riters than
[0:57] me they were fell they were more skilled
[0:59] and they couldn't make it it doesn't
[1:01] matter none of that matters there's a
[1:03] goal and I'm predestinated to make the
[1:08] goal so what am I going to do every day
[1:10] I'm just going to keep pressing towards
[1:11] the mark of the high calling in Christ
[1:15] Jesus you know what Joshua and Caleb
[1:17] didn't know they didn't know how they
[1:20] were going to knock the walls down yeah
[1:22] they didn't know how to kill Giants and
[1:24] they didn't know where they were going
[1:25] to get armor and weapons yeah they
[1:28] didn't know how they were going to fight
[1:30] when they were outnumbered they didn't
[1:32] know how they were going to supply the
[1:33] army they didn't know there was a
[1:35] million things they didn't know but the
[1:37] things they didn't know didn't matter
[1:39] the thing they did know is the only
[1:41] thing they needed to
[1:42] know and I don't know how we're going to
[1:45] cross obstacles that we have yet to
[1:46] cross as a bride I don't know how I'm
[1:48] going to cross obstacles I have to cross
[1:50] as an individual or my family will have
[1:52] to cross or this church will have to
[1:53] cross I don't know how we're going to
[1:55] cross it I don't know how we're going to
[1:56] overcome it I don't know how we move
[1:59] Beyond it I don't know but one thing I
[2:02] know is the only thing I need to know
[2:04] that there is an author and a finisher
[2:05] of my faith and he predestinated me to
[2:07] cross that
[2:09] line and if I didn't believe that I
[2:11] should just quit now because there's no
[2:13] way I'm going to make
[2:16] it I just have to believe
[2:18] it I have to believe that I was in his
[2:21] mind before the foundation of the world
[2:23] and he wants me to make it to the goal
[2:27] because he wants me he's on the other
[2:29] end pulling me
[2:31] cuz an invisible string tied around my
[2:34] handlebars and he's over there
[2:38] and just keep focused to the one who
[2:42] altered our faith and is finishing our
[2:45] faith brother BM says there's a thousand
[2:47] ways to die there's only one to live and
[2:51] that's
[2:53] Christ there's a million things that
[2:55] take your time and attention there's one
[2:56] worth focusing on that's Christ there's
[3:00] all kinds of ways to fall off of this
[3:02] road but there's only one way to stay on
[3:04] it and that's keep focused on Christ
