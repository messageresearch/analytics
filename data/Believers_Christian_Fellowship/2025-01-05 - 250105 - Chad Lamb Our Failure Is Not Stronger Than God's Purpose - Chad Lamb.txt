thank you for this opportunity to be here and Lord may we give you the preeminence you desire that you so deserve we ask these things in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you all amen while we're standing if you want to take your Bibles we'll turn to the Book of Romans and while we're turning there I've got another picture of the newest baby to show you we announced the birth of the of the little uh Sanders baby and uh so we got the details we didn't have all the details then but she was born Tuesday night at 8:45 and uh we want to welcome little Lydia Alise Sanders man it was exciting I told you those who were here Tuesday night when we announced it at the watch night it was super exciting for me because social media has ruined all my surprises can't announce engagements I can't announce birth without everybody knowing it but this was a fun one amen that she was born then so we appreciate the picture and wanted all of you to get a chance to see her man I appreciated watch night I had a good time I appreciated everybody who contributed it was quite a blessing to be here together and I enjoyed it very much also wanted to let you know before we read the scripture that the uh uh Church age book Bible study will continue on this uh Thursday in Lord willing it'll be our final last session we'll be going through resume the ages the last chapter so I'm looking forward to that so that'll be this Thursday uh this Thursday in the fellowship uh also one more announcement um this was a bit of a surprise for me but we'll have a guest Minister this Wednesday brother Stan price from Florida will be ministering for us here on Wednesday brother Stan's a brother I just had a chance to meet just uh this last year had some fellowship with him and really really enjoyed it and so he's in the area visiting some of his family and I caught wind and uh so I asked him if he could come and Minister for us and he delayed his departure by a couple days so could come so he'll be here Wednesday night so we're looking forward to that and I'm I'm excited for you to get a chance to meet him and hear the word from him amen praise God while we're standing let's look at Romans chapter 8 together Romans chapter 8 in verse 35 says who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen may God bless you as you take your seats may God bless us as we look into his word and may He bless us with the spirit of Revelation amen that's what we desire that God will open our understanding and open our eyes to see what he has for us this hour we read this scripture because it's it's such a good reminder that the love of God for us is fixed it was fixed before the foundation of the world and there's not anything that'll separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus I mean he he he goes through quite an extensive list of many different things uh uh and it's interesting death nor life will separate us angels nor principalities so powers that are Beyond this world or powers that are in this world will neither one separate us death or life will neither one separate us there's nothing that can separate us uh from the love nor height nor depth nor cre so there's no distance there's no physical distance there's no spiritual power there's no earthly power there's nothing that can separate us from the love of God what a consolation friends and so uh then it starts off in verse 35 he said what shall separate us from the love of God shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword nothing good things bad things things in between nothing will separate us from the love of God Amen this is good to remember when we get into some situations that aren't so pleasant that God's love is fixed amen amen now there's a specific subject I just want to uh labor on this morning and just want to share with you and and these are things that we've been talking about and discussing it feels like for quite some time so so you'll find that there's nothing new in what we'll be talking about today but for some reason my heart keeps getting pulled back to the same thing over and over again so I'm not trying to just repeat sermons and and talk about the same subject but I believe there's a purpose in it if God is directing us that way we still have need of an understanding there's something that needs to become reality to us to give us the courage to be all that he's called us to be in this hour and so for a subject if you just want to write a title to help us Focus it'll be our failure is not stronger than God's purpose our failure is not stronger than God's purpose and and failure is something we should just come to terms with we might as well just come to terms with it now that we're all going to fail right and we're all going to fail in the areas that we don't want to fail and we're all going to fail the people we don't want to fail and we will all fail God in one way or another and and we must come to terms with that if we read through the Bible I mean it's very apparent if we walk look through all what we call the Heroes of Faith and everybody that God has used in a great way in the Bible amen they were riddled with failure they all would have times of great success and the great achievement and great accomplishment but they would also have times of great failure and mistakes and and and and and backslidings and all of these things and you can just start picking characters out of the Bible and going down through and you find that this pattern is true amen and that's that's encouragement because we find the same thing in US amen amen so I I I just like to start off and just look at Moses for a minute if you could turn to Exodus chapter 2 I just want to read through Moses that lay it as a foundation and then move from there Exodus chapter 2 we know Moses was born a proper child he was born under a sign his mother and father hid him away and the circumstances of his Deliverance as as a baby were very Supernatural found himself raised in in the pharaoh's home and educated in the Egyptian system and and with every advancement but he had as a wet nurse his own mother and she began to tell him his purpose in life and and his that he was born under a sign and the the the promise to Abraham and deliverance and and he began to hear all of these things and know him and grow up in this and so he he he had in his mind a desire unto his Brethren and he had in his mind a desire to fulfill his purpose and his calling and the will of God to deliver them and it says in Exodus 2:1 says and it came to pass in those days when Moses was grown that he went out unto his Brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew one of his Brethren and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand and he went out the second day behold two of the men of of the Hebrews strove together and he said unto him that did the wrong wherefore Smit us thou thy fellow and he said who made thee a prince and a judge over us intend us thou to kill me as thou as thou killest the Egyptian and Moses feared and said surely this thing is known now when Pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay Moses but Moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian and he sat down by a well so we know out in the land of Midian he runs away when it looks like uh it looks like Moses is going to begin to fulfill God's purpose of his life to be a deliverer and his first attempt to fulfill God's purpose he fails he kills an Egyptian he he has a a rejection from the Hebrews he runs away and he runs to uh he runs to the land of Midian amen there we know the story finds a wife he settles down he begins tending his father-in-law's sheep and he starts a life amen separated from what he was told all of his life was his calling and his purpose now he's in a completely different direction in a completely different land doing something different now he's just tending the flocks and the herds of Jethro his father-in-law amen and and and who knows what was in his mind or what he put out of his mind or what he thought about what his mom had told him amen we're human beings he was a human being so you can only imagine what his thought process was like what was that Mom was always telling me I I thought it was true but it obviously it's not true I tried and I failed and here I am and I've been here for so long for so many years and and this is just the way that it is oh praise God I'm so glad that God gave us a true account of the lies of his children yeah amen so let's turn to chapter three now we know in due season in due time at God's appointed time he comes back to Moses and and he begins to deal with him cuz Now's the Time of Deliverance and in Exodus 3: 10 he says come now therefore and I will send thee into Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go into pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee that when thou H has brought forth the people out of Egypt Thou shalt serve God Upon This Mountain so Moses god comes now to Moses and we know that he comes as a fire in a bush the pillar of fire in the burning bush and Moses Drew aside to see this phenomenon and as he got close the voice spoke out of the fire and told him to put off his shoes and he has this Supernatural encounter with God and the supernatural encounter with God puts him right back into the same understanding that he had from his mother when she was his nurse he thought it was gone he thought it was finished he thought he tried and failed and there was some misunderstanding somewhere and some mistake and the and the pillar of fire encounter brings him right back to his purpose and you know what he says I can't do it it's not me who am I who who God who am I to go to pharaoh who am I to do these things and we know that that God now is is is going to fulfill his purpose and Moses is in that purpose and God needs Moses to fulfill the purpose that he has for Moses but Moses has failed Moses has run away he's changed his mind yeah but just because Moses changed his mind doesn't mean God changed his mind amen I'm so oh I'm so thankful and then they begin this this banter back and forth amen and and uh let's go to chapter 4 verse one and Moses answered and said but behold thou will not uh they will not believe me nor heren unto my voice for they will say the Lord hath not appeared unto thee and so he says go well they they won't even listen to me who am I to go okay you want me but they weren't going to listen to me then he tells them that he gives them signs and all of these things and then we go to verse 10 and Moses said unto the Lord oh my Lord I am not eloquent neither heret for nor since thou has spoken unto thy servant but I'm slow of speech and of a slow tongue and the Lord said unto him who hath made Man's Tongue or who maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not ey the Lord now therefore go and I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what Thou shalt say here Moses has all kinds of reasonings in his mind why this won't work but none of the reasonings will determine God's purpose in his life he's got a lot of of to him sound reasoning I already tried that it didn't work who am I to go to Pharaoh the children of Israel won't listen listen to me I'm slow of speech I I can't talk right and God says I I mean basically who do you think you're talking to Moses right like I'm telling you to go and you're telling me you can't and you're giving me the list of reasons why you can't but I'm the god the creator of Heaven and Earth I created the tongue I created speech amen I gave you the ability to speak what are you doing telling me that what you have is not good enough and won't work God help us I hope we quit looking at Moses and start looking in the mirror and say we can come up with all kinds of reasons why God can't use me I can come up with a myriad of reasons where I have failed in the past and I've made mistakes and I've done all kinds of things wrong and I can come up with a pretty good list of why I shouldn't be the one to go and I can't be the one to talk and and I've messed this thing up before but that never changed God's purpose amen God had a purpose and God was going to see it through to the end regardless of what Moses thought about it or all of his excuses now there's a quote here in the message Jehovah Gyra from 1957 that I'd like to read to you he said a man is a failure he's totally lost at his birth there's no good in man if there's anything good about man it's the part of God that's in him for a man in himself is totally no good and there's any good us about him at all it's God that's did it for him so we cannot say that we did this to deserve this we prayed all night to get this it isn't whether you do this or that it's God it's not him that willth or him that runneth it's God that showeth Mercy it lays in the hands of God so what are we as human beings from the beginning failures so why does being a failure hinder you from serving God's purpose because you're a failure to begin with and what is more failure going to hinder us from serving God's purpose amen and so as we look at this I I want to read this next quote and then we'll we'll keep moving with this thought but he says and perfect strength by Perfect weakness now we are very grateful that we still have a kind heavenly father who looks over our mist stakes and doesn't reckon them to us as I was reading over the book of Romans the 4th chapter where Paul wrote The Divine commentary the life of Abraham now we know that Abraham many times got kind of flustered flustrated like we do his commentary was wrote there wasn't any of his fluster mentioned never mention them at all said Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God see and that's the way I hope mine will be wrote down in there it's not my mistakes and everything but just what I try to do the intention of my heart to do for God's people amen when when Paul start when Paul makes that statement and when we look over at Hebrews amen the record of Abraham it's Abraham was he was the father of Faith Abraham staggered not at the promise of God Abraham believed amen and it doesn't go through all the details of Abraham not believing and Abraham making mistakes and Abraham lening to his wife and Abraham going to Gar and Abraham going to Egypt and all the things that Abraham did amen the grace covered for that amen and I if I could uh maybe just separate something out now amen I I don't know exactly I don't know how to say things sometimes and make them actually accurate so I'm not going to try to make an accurate statement I'm just going to make a statement when Abraham went to Gar when he backslid when he doubted when he when he uh took Hagar to fulfill the promise when he did all of those things that he did let's just say that this Abraham did that amen but when Abraham staggered not at the promises of God let's just say it was this Abraham that did that right maybe that will help us separate some things because what was in the Divine record was what God had intended Abraham to be all along the internal thought of God concerning Abraham amen this outside is in a certain condition because of the Fall because of hybridization because of the Fallen condition of the world and it's going it's got a sticky cckar nature it's always going to cause problems it's going to fail it's going to fall but there's a seed of predestination on the inside and brother benam said that seed was meant to be you from the beginning and you didn't come the right way we came this way amen there's a purpose in coming this way absolutely but if we had come the intended way then it would have just sprung life we' had a body that could accurately Express amen that seed that was on the inside but now we came with a body that was born in hybridization and Corruption and we have trouble now expressing that seed amen so we find this all through the Bible there's a whole pile of mistakes that everybody has made I want to look at Luke chap 22 together Luke chapter 22 in verse 31 Luke 22 and 31 he says Luke 22:31 and the Lord said Simon Simon behold satanath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren and he said unto the Lord I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death and he said I tell thee Peter the shall not Crow this day before that thou shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest me let's go down to verse 60 this is after Peter denies the Lord and it says in verse 60 and Peter said man I know not what thou sayest and immediately while he yet spake the crew and the Lord turned and looked upon on Peter and Peter remembered the word of the Lord how he had said unto him before the Crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice and Peter went out and wept bitterly this is a remarkable story for many reasons and many things are going on here but one thing that I find to be amazing is God knew that Peter was going to fail Before Peter failed he prophesied that Peter would fail he he knew that the devil had desired to sift him his wheat and he did not deny Satan the opportunity but he prayed that his faith fail not but he prophesied ahead of time that the shall not grow till thou has denied me and and it happened exactly and and then you know Peter denied it you know there's no way I there's no way because I'm I'm ready to give my life I'm ready to give go to prison and even death with you and that's what Peter really believed but that was Peter in his own strength that was Peter and Peter's human strength with Peter's human thinking thinking that he had what it t takes to endure that he was going to go all the way and really you know Peter needed to realize how weak he really was but God knew ahead of time that Peter was going to fail amen even though Peter didn't believe it it happened exactly the way it was and and the question is if God knew why didn't God change the circumstances if God knew why didn't God stop it if God knew Peter was going to fail ahead of time and he prayed that his faith failed not amen and even could prophesy and then Peter fail amen then then God must have a purpose in the failure because nothing that we do will stop God's purpose and God purposed that he would give Peter the keys to the kingdom is that right he said I give to you the Keys of the Kingdom amen and and and and and he promised Peter along with the disciples that I have ordained you that you should go forth into the world that you'll take this gospel amen as many as believe and are baptized shall be saved amen you're going to go and you're going to bring forth fruit and your fruit shall remain all of that was the purpose of God for Peter's life amen but Peter was going to come now and deny the Lord weep curse and swear as he does it amen deny the Lord go out and weep wh weep uh bitterly but is not going to change God's purpose he's still going to give the Keys of the Kingdom to Peter and he's still going to go forth and bring fruit and he's still ordained to carry the gospel and and so shockingly God knows Peter's going to fail but God won't allow anything that'll stop God's purpose so this failure must work together for God's purpose Amen brother bam said in the message standing in the Gap but we see even the great St Paul got between Straits one time and many times that God has did things or let his vs do it that was mistakes in in order to prove these things now we know that human beings can make mistakes but God can make no mistake so God's not making a mistake with our life there is no mistake like we make a mistake absolutely it's a mistake but that mistake can't can't be in such a way that it mistakes the purpose and plan of God in our life there's a trump card in our lives there's something that overrides everything else and that is the purpose of God that is God's predestinated Divine Purpose for our lives and it absolutely supersedes everything else and we're going to look at that and we're going to see that amen uh uh let's just look at it now brother Franco I hit that D dcam button is that going to bring it up bring up the white board or whatever I try to be Technical and I just don't get it friends I'm sorry I want to be smart heart and understand these things but I need lots of help so brother Fran if you can bring that up for me I probably just fried the whole system by pushing the button but anyways I want to look at some things in in brother brenham's life I keep going back to brother brenham's life because I believe there's a reason it was given to us in this generation on 1200 tapes and testimonies and records and and and all the things that we have recordings and and video and all of the things that God has given us I believe he's given it to us for a reason amen because if we don't understand how God deals with the Son of God who's got a gift and a purpose in his life we're going to be we can easily become confused about how God's working in our lives amen and and I just want to write a little list for you um I'm just going to make this first list if it wasn't for God's intervention this is the first list if it wasn't for God's intervention brother brandham would have killed the boys who beat him up he had been beaten but he had a life of rejection on top of the beating and after the beating he went and grabbed his 22 rifle and he ran out and cut the boys off on the path that they were in and he jumped out in front of them and said who wants to die first he had full intention of shooting those boys and he started trying to pull the trigger and try and and trying to load another another one in the chamber and none of those bullets would go off I'm I'm going to say this and we're going to go through a whole list because I want you to think I like I've been thinking I thought we had a law of free moral agency is that right is there a law free moral agency we can choose to do what we want to choose to do and God will not violate free moral agency brother brenham's Choice was to kill these boys did God supersede his free moral agency did he override the law of free moral agency sometimes it just amazes me that one thing that I'm realizing is there's no way to simplify God and say God did this for this reason this equals that because the the moment we try to simplify God we make it so complicated we'll never understand it because we try to wedge him into a hole and if he fits in this hole then he can't also fit in this hole at the same time or this hole but God can fit in every one of our holes simultaneously allow free moral agency but not stop his perfect plan in our lives override for free moral agency but never be unjust and allowing for I don't know how he does it all but he's God and we've so so the human brain so tries to understand things and compartmentalize things because we have trouble anything that we cannot explain starts to trouble us like we've went through this years ago when we start talking about you you you you you have a dark night and in a dark night you hear a strange sound and you can't see the unknown begins to paralyze us with fear because to cause all kinds of trouble right if it was Daylight and you saw amen the breeze come in the window knock the whatever off the counter and fall on the floor zero fear whatsoever but you do it under the cloak of night when you have no idea what that noise just was and all of a sudden we're we we're trying to compartmentalize and then our mind goes to try to rationalize we're trying to rationalize what we just heard because as soon as we can identify it we can relax right and we try to do the same thing with the things of God we try to and we come up with all kinds of explanations this circumstance in my life happened because of this and God was accomplishing that in the reality he was probably doing so many things that your brain will never be able to calculate all that God was doing with this circumstance in our life and so we can't come up with simplistic understanding simplistic answers that is just a one-off this happened because of that God did this because of this God does everything he does for his Divine Purpose and how everything fits into his Divine Purpose I cannot always explain I have no idea but it doesn't matter cuz he does so if it wasn't for God's intervention he would have killed those boys he would have drank he would have smoked why is this a big deal because when he was a little boy the angel of the Lord told him don't you ever drink or smoke or defile your body in any way for there's a work for you to do when you get older so the angel of the Lord had forbidden him to smoke or to drink or defile his body and he says that's run around with women and so now he gets in a situation you know the story as well as I do but he gets into a situation where he's got a man who's a friend of his fathers and he's trying to impress this man because he wants to be able to use his boat and they're out in a boat and they're they're they're uh he's with his dad he's with his dad's buddy and he's there and I think his brother's there and they're moving down the river collecting bottles for their for their whiskey cuz they got a moonshine operation and and then the friend who brother bram's trying to impress brother Bam's a boy he's a boy and his dad is there and his dad's friend is there and he wants to impress his dad's friend to use his boat can you place yourself in that situation sir and the man pulls out a flask of whiskey pops the top off amen takes a swig gives it to his Dad gives it to whoever and he offers it to brother brother brandham and brother Bram said no sir I don't drink and he says you're a brandom and you don't drink and brother B's father says I've got so many boys I can't remember the number now and one of them is a brother REM says give me that right determined he's not going to be a what was where was this free moral agency what was it that he wanted to do wanted to fit in he wanted to drink the whiskey and all of a sudden he heard that same sound he heard of the rushing wind the the little Whirlwind in the tree and it come in his ears and he put the bottle down and he tried a second time and it got louder and louder and he handed the bottle back and he jumped out and he ran away crying amen he didn't know what was happening what was it it was God over writing his free moral agency because God had a purpose in his life that was the whole point don't drink or smoke or defile yourself in any way for there's a purpose I've got a work for you to do when you get older God what was God preserving God was preserving his own purpose amen amen we know the story with his little girlfriend they went out he went on a double date he and his buddy and these two girls and and you know she had eyes like a dove and this and that and he thought she was great and he go we went in and he was a you know he wanted to be a big man I think he was 15 years old went and bought uh some bottles of pop and some sandwiches he was going to be a star and he comes out and she's smoking he said there was my little Dove smoking a cigarette she offered it to him he wouldn't take it and he offered again said no I don't smoke and she says what are you I sayy I thought you were a man or something like that he says give me that cigarette I don't know about you but I am so thankful that God's purpose will not be defeated peer pressure desires oh you just name what it is God's purpose will not be defeated if it wasn't for the intervention of God he would have died on Hurricane Mountain along with Ma and Billy got up there and left him in a lean to went out storms coming got lost we know the story really well mean he learned a valuable lesson but if it wasn't for the intervention of God he would have died if it wasn't for the intervention of God he would have committed suicide twice you know the first time as this both were after his loss of his wife and the loss of his baby and he couldn't take the grief anymore the first he tried to electrocute himself by grabbing a be wire as a lineman so he doesn't know what happened all he remembers is reaching out for the while and he woke up and he was sitting on the ground crying he doesn't know what happened I know what happened God had a purpose in his life the second time he had a revolver and he got so down and so desperate and so brokenhearted he wanted to take his own life and he put that gun to his head and he as hard as he squeezed the trigger he couldn't get it to go off squeezed with all of his might I want to ask you where's free moral agency here's a man squeezing the trigger as hard as he can and finally in grief he throws the gun down and it shoots a hole in the wall you know what he says God why won't you let me die he knew who was preserving him from Death he knew who was holding him back from doing what he wanted to do but God had a purpose purpose if it wasn't for the intervention of God he would have let his lawyer believe a lie right he lied he had his wife tell the I'm stepped out of the room of the house and he tell and he was going to let it go but when he went down to pray for the baby God come on the scene and says how can you pray for that baby when you're alive and he had to go make it right he was going to just sweep it under the rug and move on who stopped him God didn't if it wasn't for God he would have left the field and went to British Colombia and in doing so he would have tricked his wife into going yeah and in doing so he would have had disruption in his family we know the whole story but that's what he was mulling over that's what he had been he said I just made up in my mind that that's what I was going to do and if it wasn't for if it wasn't for God interjecting himself in the situation that's what the prophet had made up his mind to do trick his wife into the going going up for a vacation and saying well it's so nice up here why don't we just stay and stay and help Bud out and and be a guide and then if God gives him a message he storm out like a prophet and say and what's the whole purpose behind that he was trying to get away from the pain of rejection because they didn't receive his ministry and he had determined and then God starts dealing with him in the on the road and dealing with him in the diner and or first dealing with him with dreams before about him being a bum with his brother-in-law dealing with him in the diner dealing with him on the road and finally he stops him on the side of the road and when he stops him on the side of the road he said look at that mountain and there's a mountain range there with Seven Peaks and he says your name is written in that that's your life and in there has his three pools and his whole life is spelled out in this mountain range and God injects himself at the right time in the right place why because of his purpose am brother baham comes back and repents and we know all of these things but if it wasn't for God's intervention all of these things would have happened okay I want to make another list mistakes that God allowed you know there's a lot of things he prevented the prophet from doing but there's a whole list of things he didn't stop him from he didn't stop him from listening to his mother-in-law he didn't go to the field I'm going to ask you what were the consequences of that were they harsh they were hurtful terrible hard consequences but God didn't stop him from making that choice he stopped him from committing suicide he stopped him from drinking he stopped him from smoking he stopped him from murdering but he didn't stop him when he listened to his mother-in-law and refused to go at the first call later you know what brother Bram says about this he says I didn't go when he first called me and he said I think of the of the multitudes that could have been healed and saved how and and that bothered brother he thought of if the Healing Ministry had started sooner how many more people would have been healed how many more people would have been delivered if he would have just went earlier so there was consequences for this action there was pain there was suffering that he lost his wife he lost his baby he he he he goes through all of this moral people missed out on healing missed out on the The Gospel message being preached because God allowed free moral agency now I'm going to ask you you tell me I need you to come up with a computer that can run an algorithm that can tell me when God will allow for moral agency and when he'll stop it amen amen he allowed him to make a mess of the first and second pool which created carnal impersonations is that right sir think about the cost of carnal impersonations and what did it cost the Christian world what confusion went out I want to read out of the seventh seal where brother bam talks about this he says and in the seventh seal he's going back to the vision that he had at the end of 1955 that begins explaining in 56 and we sometimes call it the tent Vision but the tent vision is starts off aici fing vision and he's explaining his three pools and he says I don't know I I've understood fishing now the first thing you do here's the way it's done you see all the fish around you got to jerk The Lure well that's exactly the tactic of fishing so I said jerk The Lure now you see when I jerk The Lure the first time now the fish takes out after it but they were little ones that's just like they were catching then you'll see and I jerked it out on the bank and I had a fish but it looked like skin Over The Lure it was so little and then I was standing standing there and something said I told you not to do that and I started crying that voice who was taking him through uh uh the first second and third pool that that was that bringing him through the vision that V voice says I told you not to do that brother bam was warned not to do it and he did it anyways and in doing it now he's standing in the vision he's got this line Tangled on he's in a mess and and he starts crying and and brother B says all the line was Tangled around me like this I was standing there crying with my head down like that I said God oh forgive me I'm a stupid person Lord forgive me and I had this line like line in that what I had in my hand was a little baby shoe about that long and the string was about as big around as my finger about half an inch like and and the eyelid in the shoe was just about the size of little than 1/16 probably of an inch of an eyet and I was trying to lace this little shoe up with this great big inch cord and a voice came you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things said let them alone and just then he picked me up and he took me up and set me way up high to where a meeting was going on looked like a tent or a Cathedral of some sort and I looked and there was a little box like little place over the side and I seen that light was talking to somebody above me that light that you see there on the picture it Whirled away from me like that and went over into the tent and he said I'll meet you there and said this will be the third pool and you won't tell it to nobody and in saino Canyon said this is the third pool Sabino Canyon was where he received the sword in the hand the reason I wanted to go through this because there was something striking to me in this brother brandom messed up in the first pool is that true we agreed he messed up in the second pool he tried to explain too much he was trying to explain Supernatural things to Pentecostal babies and he was like trying to get this big cord through this little island and and God said leave him alone stop trying but what he did is created carnal impersonations and things went all over and confusion about Divine Healing and about miracles and about signs of and the the confusion was rampant across christiandom because of his failure but what what I love about this this this quote this story in seven in the seventh seal about the vision is while brother brandham had his head hanging down saying he was a stupid person forgive me God the next thing that happen happened is God picked him up and showed him the third pool and said I'll meet you in there this will be your third pull what is he saying I'm going to use you anyways this hasn't stopped my purpose in your life you made a mistake you made a blunder you did wrong you should not have done that didn't I tell you not to do that and brother benam is feeling the pain oh God forgive me I'm a stupid person amen and feeling it all but it doesn't change God's purpose he's still going to bring the third pool through the same person who messed up the first and second pool because that was God's Divine Purpose in his life amen why did God let him do it I don't know all the reasons why God let him do it the fact is he could have stopped him if he wanted to stop him he proved it through this prophet's life if he wanted to stop him from doing something he had a way of stopping him but if he didn't stop him then maybe it also served his Divine Purpose because God's not going to allow anything thing that'll stop his Divine Purpose praise God he was allowed to have Miracle lines after he was told not to brother B tells us about this in the message experiences from 1947 and he goes on it's quite lengthy so I'm not going to read all of it but he goes to explain how he was warned by the angel of the Lord not to have the miracle lines and what they were doing is the campaign managers and brother benam they they were so enthused by this gift that was operating and the accuracy of it and this is back when it was a sign in the hand and he and he said that they would say bring your worst cases we're going to have a miracle line tonight bring the worst and they would push the worst and they wanted visible things they didn't want the hidden back they wanted they wanted the halt the lame the blind the they wanted those moved to the front and and God was honoring the gift in the prophet's life and the the prophet would be praying and they would seeing Miracles every every night but God told him not to do it so brother bham you know he tried not to do it but his campaign managers they were still wanting to do it and they were putting pressure on him they told him how effective it was and brother brandham said he allowed me to go on for six months he continued on after he was told not to he continued on doing the miracle lines the very thing God told him not to do and the reason that the angel told him not to do it is he says because they won't have faith unless they see a miracle you're actually destroying Faith that's what he told him that was the lesson and so brother B but it was so effective apparently effective that the campaign managers wanted it the host pastors wanted it and brother Benham kept giving in because he also was going down the path of reasoning saying it's working and for six months he continued on until he came to a service in Phoenix listen to what happened said you know what happened the very first person was brought a little girl I hope she's here today from California I believe it was and she was hard of hearing and I talked to the child beforehand and I put my hands upon her and the vibrations was hitting my hand from probably some kind of bursted eardrum that had caused an infection that little something to grow over it little growth caused it to have a life somewhere and the vibration stopped and I said and I said to you as always now the child is healed and I tried to talk to her and I couldn't even yell at her or beat my hands to together and she couldn't hear I turned her took a hold of her hand the vibrations back I cast it forth again and it came back so I left the child alone what happened is a child came who was hard of hearing and she left that line completely deaf says the next come was another man heart of hearing I said you believe sir he nodded his head I called out to him he nodded his head said and bowed his head and when I did I took hold of his hand no vibration that was purely spiritual by anointing of the spirit it's dead nerves probably and when I prayed for that man he couldn't even hear me beat my hand together behind him and I seen that I was condemned and there I stood in this Pulpit for the first time and I knew what it meant for a man to be left alone with God I was helpless I'm ashamed of myself before you friend today I'm ashamed of it he goes on a little further he says sometime I just now I was afraid it was gone afraid his gift was gone I couldn't feel God at all nowhere I hope and trust that'll that I'll never in all the days of my life have to go through another three days like that that was hell on Earth friends I was now God was gone the angel was gone the Holy Spirit I had nothing this is this is so interesting so um sobering that God would warn his Prophet not to do something but the prophet would continue doing it and for six months listen that's why if God if God ever warns you and tells you amen through the preaching through the prophet through the word of God whatever tells you amen and corrects you amen and you don't take the correction and continue on just because you continue on as before doesn't mean that it's okay this such a good lesson for us friends cuz many times something will come over the pull pit or we hear Brother B say something on the tape and it smites our heart and we know we're corrected and we'll just continue on and because lightning doesn't strike immediately or Nothing changed we continue on moving on and then we just think it's okay well it wasn't okay with God but God is forbearing God is longsuffering God is always giving us a chance to come to our own repentance am yesen and here brother R now not only does the gift not work the people who came to him to be delivered are worse than they were when they came they were both hard of hearing now they're deaf then he leaves and he gets on a plane and he flies away and it's gone he doesn't feel God he doesn't feel the spirit he doesn't feel anything he's left totally alone he said it was hell on Earth he had nothing and he was repenting and asking God for help and he rep repented and when he repented uh we go he goes to the next meeting goes up to Oregon I believe it was when he goes up to Oregon after repented he calls for the he calls for the prayer line he tells everybody what's happened he doesn't know if it's going to work anymore amen and calls for the first person to come through the prayer line and all of the sudden the gift works it operates they're delivered and he says they brought five I think it was five children over from the deaf school that were hard of hearing are no totally deaf and every one of them was healed amen praise God the question I have is if God will stop him from smoking and God will stop him from drinking why won't God stop him from doing this that'll actually leave two people Stone death I don't know but I know God's perfect in all of his ways and the reality is I don't know I don't know some may know in the message and have studied it out and know I don't know if those two people ever got their hearing back I don't know why would God prevent the prophet from making a mistake on one hand and allow him to walk right into it after warning him on another hand why would he do that the only thing that I know is God will not defeat his own purpose I know that God will not defeat his own purpose and if something will hinder stop uh God's purpose God will stop it but if something will work into God's purpose he will allow it and there were many things that the prophet of God needed to learn I don't know what all God was doing I'm not trying listen I'm I I pray that God will get me Beyond The Way Beyond and the fallacy of saying I know why he did these things I don't know all the reasons why he did these things there's probably more reasons than we could calculate for why he did everything he did because you know everything that happened in life with that Prophet you and I hear and when we hear it it does something different for all of us and it has an effect in us how can you calculate what God allowed or didn't allow and the effect that it has on another generation as they listen to the text you can't calculate or measure what God is doing with every circumstance in our lives in our church in the prophet's life in the world there's no it's it's it's not I don't believe it's measurable and I don't believe it's comprehendable by a human mind but how this is what I'm thinking how how could he say you know he's going to smoke a cigarette and there's only three other people present and he stops him but he's going to he's going his failure is going to cause two people heart of hearing to be completely death and God doesn't stop him he just warns him well he already warned him about the smoking too the angel of Lord said don't smoke don't drink or defile so he was already warned yeah so why has It Happened One Way way one time and something completely different the other time all I can say is God has a purpose and everything works towards his purpose what about the time he overworked himself and had to leave the field he was having a Ministry that was healing multitudes of people but he said I mishandled the gift he made another mistake and in that mistake his body got run down when his body got run down he had a nervous breakdown and he had to leave the field and he was months or a period of time I don't remember the period of time that he couldn't take campaigns and he couldn't go on and even his campaign managers and some of his friends thought he was washed up and the ministry was over and they tried to move on with his tent and move on with his magazine without him and and in that period of Time how many people weren't healed how many people didn't hear the gospel how many people didn't witness a living God the effect the effect of of of not going out was tremendous and you say what why would God stop him on one hand but allow him to overwork himself and get into a situation where he can't go on and he's left the field and doesn't know if he'll ever preach again and multitudes suffering why because it must serve his purpose it's the only thing that's the I mean I I I don't know how to explain there's no explanation for it the only thing I can the only thing I can understand from my little bit of finite understanding is that God's purpose will never be defeated if it would defeat his purpose he wouldn't allow it if he allows it it must go along with his purpose why didn't he stop the Fall In the Garden of Eden he could stop anything he stopped all kinds of people from making mistakes he has put the brakes on he's changed circumstances he stopped why didn't he stop the Fall In the Garden of Eden Hey listen I don't know about you but I'm suffering because of that decision the whole world is suffering every human that's ever been on this Earth is suffering because of what happened in the Garden of Eden we're under a curse we're burned under a curse we live all of our lives in a cursed body amen all because of something that happened why didn't he stop it the only reason I know according to what the prophet said is that fall worked together for his purpose so God allowed it amen why did Abraham fail his wife in such a way that he would go down to guar and lie and sell out his wife and listen brother Abraham is the chosen vessel of God Amen he is the going to be the father of Faith the father of Nations from his loin are is going to come the seed line amen all of this stuff is going on in Abraham after meeting God after a body change after all of these things he goes down to guar and he fails his wife he fails God CU he shouldn't have been down there anyways should have stayed in the land amen that what the prophet tells us and and all of these things transpire and then God listen God comes on the scene God comes on the scene to aimc and says don't you know you're about to take a a man's wife he said Lord you know the Integrity of my heart I didn't why didn't God stop Abraham from going to Gar if he could show up and talk to a heathen King couldn't he have talked to Abraham how many times did he talked to Abraham if he told Abraham don't go to Gar I don't believe Abraham would have went so why did it happen this way why didn't he stop him from making a mistake why didn't he stop him from hurting Sarah's feelings why didn't he stop from bringing trouble to the whole nation of gar the whole nation was under a curse because of this thing because God had already stopped the wounds of animal and servant and everybody the whole nation was troubled because of Abraham's decision Sarah was troubled because of Abraham decisions the whole promise of God looked like it was in Jeopardy because of the decision of Abraham aon's life was in Jeopardy because of the decision of Abraham why didn't God stop Abraham from making the decision but he come to a heathen King and he said listen this whole thing's bad don't do it right all I can say friends is it must have served God's purpose and you realize we stand here and I don't know all that God was accomplishing and all that was happening amen it may take us the entire eternity to understand it but one thing I know for sure is that's the only scripture brother Brenham has to show that they had a body change cuz brother Brenham comes to that scripture and says see that King could have any Fair young virgin he wants but he wants Grandma Sarah coming down because God had just changed their bodies in that meeting in Genesis 18 and now they come down to Guerrera that is reading between the lines that's what God place so that a prophet could pick it up 4,000 or some years later and say see there was a body change Abraham probably never knew why God allowed that mistake in his life but we're looking back saying I'm so glad he went to Gar I'm so thankful that he went down there and all that transpired so I can see what God has in store for me was it a mistake yes was it costly yes did people suffer yes did it work for God's purpose listen I don't know I look at these things and I say I just don't know so we look at Abraham and we look at Moses and we look at brother brandham but and and and yeah that's wonderful we see absolutely that was God but what about me and you you know there's time s in our life that God has interjected himself in our life and stopped us turned us he's closed doors he's opened doors has he done it for you has there been times that God absolutely worked a situation out for you that you would have got in trouble or something bad would happen if it wasn't for God injecting himself in the situation but how many of us have made terrible mistakes that have cost us terrible consequences and not just hurt us but the ones that hurt us the most are the ones that hurt other people where our actions have hurt others and caused pain and caused suffering and then the question is God why did you stop me then and you didn't stop me then why did you come down why I mean there's times friends that God so supernaturally does something it takes our breath away he speaks to us he'll have somebody say something to us that nobody else in the world knows he'll have something come over the pull pit that only you and God knows you'll have something that is so Supernatural there's no mistaking this is God stopping me turning me moving me then you'll have other times where you keep trucking down the wrong path and God doesn't say anything he just let you go and you keep going down and you keep moving and you get settled in the fact that this must be okay with God and and you know he's fine with it he's fine with it you're going down we've been warned before in the word we've been warn in the message but we're moving on then all of a sudden everything falls apart and we I don't believe I'm the only human being amongst us but then we always say God why didn't you stop me why didn't you stop me well maybe it's going to serve God's purpose prise God prise God maybe somehow it'll serve God's purpose that doesn't mean we don't suffer that doesn't mean that the suffering doesn't continue some of those mistakes brother brenon made for himself and that affected himself and others the consequences continued on sometimes the mistakes that we've made the consequences continue on and are continuing on today some of us are still feeling the pain of mistakes that we've made amen but that doesn't change God's purpose in our life brother B said in present stage of my Ministry says didn't Jesus say I I do nothing till the father shows me first haven't I told you years ago with my own mother was laying dying and would say Bill What's My outcome I couldn't say nothing till God said so first and that's just what happened man can't man is a failure to begin with he's only an agent to which God works through and God works his own will but when you see these super duper people that always having this and that and the other you'd better stay away from it Jesus himself didn't do that said I only work as the father Works he shows me what to do and then I go and do it it anything otherwise I can't do anything otherwise than that man's a failure sometimes we don't well you think about um Elijah Elijah on Mount Carmel I mean I would love to see a video of Elijah on Mount Caramel it was one of the highlights of the Bible standing there with bold confidence in the face of all kinds of resist existance 400 prophets of ba all the nation of Israel gathered together and he was standing there absolutely confident in God and knowing where God placed him and calling out for you here's what we're going to do we're going to have a showdown now we're going to find out who God really is if baal's God or if the Lord is God and you guys do your thing and we'll I'll do my thing and he rebuilds the he rebuilds the broken down altar he's restoring it back and they're doing their thing and their worship and and and it's obvious friends that they have a degree of Faith because it what they're going through to call on their God and he's mocking them and he I mean he's absolutely confident he is he is the epitome of what we all want to be the Bold Christian who knows what's going to happen as faith in God Is unwavered by anything that's happening this is what we want to be this is what image we want to have of oursel we want to live every day like this fold of your hands and say that's not going to get anywhere I know God you don't he's on my side not yours mocking them maybe you're God maybe he's on a journey so maybe you should yell louder he might be far away listen friends yeah I mean it's great goes through all the motions and they fail and it comes to the time of the evening sacrifice the appointed time time and he says you know I'm not just going to see if God will send fire down but let's pour water barrels of water over this sacrifice he lays out the wood and he lays out the sacrifice and dumps Barrel after barrel of water upon it it's soaking wet no fire came down on Earth but now he's calling for fire but he he's made it impossible with the soaking of the wood and soaking of the stones and the water gathered around the trench yeah then he says God I have done all of this at thy command yeah why was he so bold because he had super duper faith and he was a super duper Christian he was bold because God already showed him what was going to happen yeah Amen brother Bram said if God told me that he was going to raise up George Washington I'd invite everybody to come to the cemetery to watch cuz it can't fail here's Elijah no wonder he's mocking no wonder he's bold no wonder he's standing in front of all Al no wonder he's so confident God had already showed him exactly what was going to happen he was going through the motions and as he did fire came down from heaven licked up the sacrifice the wood and the stones yeah killed the 400 prophets of Baal restored Israel back to Faith in Jehovah it was a wonderful Victory what happened the next day the next day Jezebel the wife of Ahab finds out what he did and says I'm going to do to to to Elijah all that he did to the prophets of Baal so help me do you know what that bold super duper Christian did he ran away scared run away sitting under a juniper tree and he's saying God I'm no better than my fathers take my life said before I'll say again being a human being is the most pathetic thing in the face of this planet we are the most pathetic creatures CU if we would just operate by Instinct like an animal does we'd be fine we'd always do the same thing but we've got this intellectual reasoning thing in this emotional realm and we are absolutely pathetic here he runs under the juniper tree crying out God take my life I'm no better and God comes down with an Angelic visitation and feeds him and and and takes care of him and and he he goes on the strength all the way to the cave and he's in the cave and God comes by and says Elijah what doest thou here what are you doing here and Elijah goes through the WRA sheet you know because of this and this and for these reasons and I'm the only one left that's why I'm here so then God shows up in the fire and in the earthquake and in the wind shakes the whole mountain and then the still small voice and in the still Small Voice the prophet of God comes to the front of the cave with the mantle wrapped around his face and God says again Elijah what are you doing here and Elijah goes through the whole thing again because of this and the enemies and they seek my life and and God doesn't address his complaint or his fear God only addresses his purpose he doesn't say it's okay I'm with you they're not going to kill you I understand I feel sorry for no he's just saying Elijah I need you to go anoint this man to be king over Syria I need you to anoint this one to be king over and I need you to anoint Elijah to be prophet in your stad get back to your purpose hallu amen oh praise be to God Amen aot elah did what he did because God had showed him but when God hadn't showed him he was Elijah again he was a man he was prone to make mistakes he ran away from his calling he ran away from his commission he ran away to hide amen because of all the things that had transpired and all the fears and all the things that were against him but God just looked at him and says listen I need you to do this this and this why did God come to him in the cave and didn't leave him alone because God had him to do this this and this why are you still on this planet because God has a purpose in your life and mean if he could only come to us in the cave and say now listen straighten up quit sing I know you've been rejected I know you've been offended I know you've made mistakes and I know you're upset about all the things you've done but listen you got to go do this this and this still before you die right oh you know how much that would help us some of those things he doesn't necessarily tell us he may he can he can do anything he wants but if he doesn't tell us amen we just need to March forward following him day by day trusting that he's working a purpose in our life and everything in our life is working towards his purpose I'm not here without purpose I'm not here as some random thing that happened I'm a Child of God what makes me believe I'm a Child of God cuz he came to me and revealed himself to me and called me to himself I believe by faith I'm his child and if I'm his child I'm here amen for a purpose that he had before the foundation of the world and I'm not leaving here till I fulfill that purpose and there's nothing that he'll let me do that'll destroy his purpose but there may be some things he lets me do that destroys me for his purpose brother benam says and blind bmas he's praying he said our heavenly father we come approaching the Throne of Mercy we would not come approaching Justice because we could not stand it we will not approach your law because there has no Redemption but we approach Jesus who is thy mercy and we come asking for divine mercy upon us all forgive us of our shortcomings and our mistakes and the things that we have did or said or even thought that was wrong and we do not believe that we are holy Lord we believe it's not a Hool Holy Mountain but it's a holy God on the mountain not a holy church but the holy ghost in the church not a holy people but the Holy Spirit why because this part of me is a failure it's only the god part of me that can do anything right and only by the anointing of his Spirit let's let's read a couple scriptures let's go to Deuteronomy together if you can turn with me to Deuteronomy chapter Seven's some other a few just other statements that are heavy on my heart that I want to share but I want to look at a couple scriptures here first Deuteronomy chapter 7 and verse six he said for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God ha chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all the people that are upon the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondman from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt when he when he brought Israel he didn't say I didn't bring you out because of you I brought you out because of me because I loved you so I when I say that because you I don't mean it wasn't because he wasn't the object of their love that that they were not the object of his love but it wasn't because of their goodness or their deeds or how right they were or their ability to believe more than other people could believe why did he call them out because he loved them and he made a promise to their fathers and he would keep his promise if that's the case then it wasn't their Good Deeds that brought them Redemption it wasn't their likability it wasn't because they were a better class of people or could fulfill the word better than another group of people could that had nothing to do with God's decision he said I chose you he chose them because he loved them and because he made a promise to their fathers and because he chose them he did what was his purpose in choosing with them not because they were great they were all failures they were a group of slaves and God has chosen us not because he knew that we would be the most likable people on the planet or the smartest or the the the most capable with the most gifts no he chose us before the foundation world because he loved us we are just as much failure to begin with as every other human being on this Earth amen amen we are in just as bad a shape as anybody else we have just as much complexes we have just as many vices we have just as many bad habits we have just as much everything as every other human being he didn't choose us because we were better he chose us because he loved us amen let's go to Ephesians chapter 1 we know this well but we just want to we we just want to keep it locked into our M Ephesians chapter 1 and we're going to look at verse three Ephesians 1 and3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved what made us accepted in the Beloved he made us am oh because I love God with all my heart and I no no no friends he made us accepted in the Beloved we our works did not make us accepted in the Beloved he made us accepted in the Beloved oh praise God and verse 7 in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace where and Heath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will I was predestinated according to his purpose his purpose not my purpose his purpose and that means his predestination in me in his predestination has a purpose and I will fulfill that purpose brother Chad that's a bold statement No it's a real simple statement because God purposed it it's not my willpower that's going to get it done sometimes he'll do it against my willpower he'll do it when my willpower is weak he'll do it when my Will's going the wrong way but he will serve his purpose his purpose will be accomplished in my life if he has to break me he will break me if he has to inject himself supernaturally he'll inject himself supernaturally if he has to move mountains he'll move mountains because nothing will defeat his purpose it's not me it's him it's not what I do it's what he's determined to do it's not we're not here accomplishing something so that we can have a checklist of things that we accomplish we accomplish nothing he accomplished what he already determined to accomplish in our lives we are trying our best not to hinder his work and stay out of the way that's our struggle we are absolutely laboring every day to keep this flesh and this mind subject to his will and just lay ourselves dead and let him do what he wants to do because everything we try to do backfires everything we think is right ends up wrong every decision we make for what we think is going to be a good thing ends up blowing up in our face many times over because God wants us to come to the understanding this isn't about us our strength our desire it's about him and sometimes I think it's good when everything blows up in our face I think it's a good thing when God allows all of our best efforts to serve him to amount to nothing that's a blessing when God allows us to make a decision to do the right thing only to find out it was the wrong thing I believe that's a good thing when God allows us to be sifted as wheat and we make a wrong decision and we go the wrong way and we go something contrary to what his command was and he lets it go on for a period of time and we start to believe that it's okay and then our whole world comes crashing down I say that's a good thing cuz he wouldn't have permitted it if it wouldn't work to his purpose I'd say this many of us find ourselves with limitations in our lives because of our decisions we made wrong decisions that are irreversible right some of you find yourselves in because of marriage situations you have to remain single the rest of your life because of vows because of mistakes because of other people's mistakes and your mistake but I also say that's a good thing because if it didn't serve God's purpose it wouldn't be there some people have made choices that they're still suffering from but if it didn't God serve God's purpose God would have stopped it yes amen right so let it serve God's purpose it can bring condemnation to lock us up and I can't believe I made a mistake and I can't believe I did those things and I'll never be this and I'll never be that because of the decision I made you know what friends you're going to be exactly what he purposed for you to be yeah amen there's situations in life we know brother brandham says that that for a man to minister he must marry a virgin and there's things that happen in life and and a woman could defile herself and get in a situation and now find and this man finds or she finds that then now my husband can never be a minister I say that's a good thing you say why is that a good thing because if God wanted you to minister his word God would have watched over you and your wife right so that means God spared you from making a decision that would have hurt you and hurt others we get so hurt over the things we've done wrong and the decisions we've made and we put we've got limitations in our life and barriers now because of wrong decisions and we've got Financial barriers because we made wrong decisions we didn't do things when we should have when we're young and now we're stuck in a situation that we're stuck in for financial reasons or or we took on too much debt and we shouldn't have done it it was foolish and now I'm buried under a load of dead or now I've got this situation or that situation and I say at the end of the day is God's purpose in your life going to be disrupted maybe the mistake works together for his purpose maybe the limitation that's in our life stops us from going outside his purpose for our life but it keeps us in line with his purpose do it hurt yes it hurts will it always hurt probably but let it work together for good friends the one thing we can't do is say because of this I can't be a child of God show me that in the Bible and because of this God can't use me show me that in the Bible amen right because I failed this God can never use me I'm such a failure God's in the habit of using failures God I don't know if you've read the Bible recently but God is in the habit of using people who make big mistakes not little mistakes big mistakes you look at the life of David King David I mean there's mistake after mistake after mistake and when he would go to make a mistake God would absolutely stop him remember he went to the Philistine King amen because he got tired of Saul chasing him and throwing Spears at him and trying to kill him so he goes to the Philistine King and now he's so angry and so upset he's lost his whole purpose and now he's the Philistine King's going to go fight against Saul and the armies of is is and David says I'll just go with you they've rejected me I'll kill them too you know what that's his free moral agency right he's decided they've rejected me they don't want me they've cast me out you've welcomed me I'll go with you to fight the Israelites then all of a sudden God has all the all the princes of the Philistines turn against David and go to the king and says you can't do this what he'll do is he'll over there he'll start fighting with Israel and turn against us and we'll be wiped out and so they send him back the king turned him back and said you go back David was going he made his decision his decision was going to go fight Israel but God couldn't have him kill an Israelite amen because he was going to be the king of the Israelites he was called to Shepherd them and under that anointing God couldn't allow that because of God's purpose so God worked the circumstances to send him back thank God God had people on the scene God turned the situation God worked it all out and God delivered David from doing something that would have hurt David Hurt Israel and hurt God's purpose but years later there come a time that Kings went out to battle and David stayed home and he saw a woman bathing herself on her Housetop and lust began to burn within him and he took her and lay with her and then she became pregnant then had her husband killed and all of this stuff happened God could turn the hearts of the Philistines to save David from doing something outside God's will why didn't God do something to stop David I mean God had already done what he should do he gave him the Commandment Thou shalt not I mean thou sht not take thy the neighbor's wife like it was already there it was on the tablets of stone that he gave Moses it was embedded in the law God had already warned him and told him but why didn't God stop him why didn't God just go arrest him and make him not do something that was going to be so harmful to him to this lineage after him for the whole nation I don't know how to figure that one out if you figure it out come and tell me God could stop David from taking Saul's life with the Integrity of his heart he had so much Integrity that he wouldn't kill what the man who was trying to kill him he had so much respect and honor for God and God's anointing that he wouldn't kill him but how could he not have respect and honor for the laws of God when he took a neighbor's wife yeah did he suffer yes did other people suffer yes was it tragic yes was it hurtful yes did it create a whole pile of problems yes did it work together for God's purpose yes I can't explain it friends I don't even want to try to explain it if I try to explain it I'll ruin it all we can do is look at it and say God I don't understand but I believe with all my heart you're working your purpose in my life done things I regret brother venam comes to the end of his life I mean not the end of his life but in his life he done things that he regretted he regretted not going out out when God first called him to go out he lost so much friends that he suffered with go listen to his life story and see the man weeping hear him Weeping at the end of the tape because he didn't obey God and he listened to his mother-in-law all that he lost and all that have happened but you know what he didn't stop serving God he didn't quit fulfilling his purpose he messed up the first pool in the second pool he got burned out in the first pool because of uh the healing Ministries and and had a nervous condition had nervous breakdown had to leave the field for a while but when God healed him he went right back he failed in South Africa to obey God and he listened to the ministers and he wound up with an amoeba and all kinds of bad things but he didn't quit serving God he messed up over and over and over again and he had mistakes he had apologize for he comes in standing in the Gap and he got hurt feelings and he and he W was had lost the feeling for the people and he left the sick people lay and he was going to go fulfill his plans and he had to come back and apologize for it but he didn't stop serving God and I don't care what has transpired in our lives the purpose of God will still be fulfilled doesn't matter what there's nothing that we could do that will override God's purpose that's humanistic thinking that's reasoning to start thinking I've done this and now God will never use me I thought I was going to have a gift I thought I was going to have a position and now I'm not going to have that because I did this God will never you how could the plan of God Be thed by a measly human being nothing in the Bible has ever stopped at God's plan from coming forth I say nothing will let's turn to Romans chapter 9 together Romans 9 and6 not as though the word of God ha taken none effect for they are not all of Israel which are of Israel neither because they all Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau all have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy it's God's plan God's calling God's purpose God's desire and all I want to say is God let me fulfill your desire we've had a lot of rough roads behind us a lot of bad decisions and a lot of consequences for those but if the devil starts to beat us up and think you can never do this you can never be this or will never be this because of what you've done just remind them say God has supernaturally worked in my life and he could have stopped any of that so I'm going to let God work all of that to his purpose amen and if there's limitations in my life because of decisions I made then praise God God wanted a barrier in my life so I wouldn't go that way but I would go this way amen praise be to God God works all things according to the counsel of his own will here's what brother M said in the message Oneness we know we make mistakes but you mustn't look at that it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have them but you see it's following his rules following what he said to do stumble and falling doesn't have one thing to do with it a real true servant if he stumble he'll get up again if he wobbles God pulls him right back in the path as long as he's in the path of Duty but if he's off the path of Duty God's not obligated to him but as long as he's in the path of Duty God's obligated to him knowing that he's just a man or a woman he's obligated to that person as long as they're in the path of Duty what's the path of Duty God I'm here to serve you I'm here to fulfill your purpose sometimes I don't know if this step's the right step and this step maybe is the wrong step but I believe If I Stumble and fall I'll get right back because you're obligated to help me cuz what I want to do is your will I've done many things that weren't as will but I I I was trying I wanted to serve God I was doing my best many failures and mistakes but praise God God has been faithful to pull us out of the allall friends we're still here today we're still serving God we've had some horrific things that we've been through and some things that we've done to ourselves and others have done to us but praise God we're here serving his purpose how did that hen how can you compute all of that with everything that we've been through if we go through the room and run everybody's scenario and all the bad things and the circumstances and the decisions and the hurtful things and we're all here serving God's purpose how did that happen because he determined it before the foundation of the world and everything is working for his purpose brother I'm going to finish with this last two these last couple thoughts here brother bam we know the interview of sister Bruce really well we've been through it before but sister Bruce says I make so many mistakes and I fail so many times here's what brother Ram said here's a woman who's a Christian woman brother R said I believe you to be a real Christian I've watched your life and she's struggling with her mistakes and brother R says she said I make so many mistakes I fail so many times he said that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes it wouldn't be lotted to you he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve him sister Bruce says yes all right that's what he died for so you could serve him now your mistakes are not looked not lotted to you he's your propitiation he is your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins and become you because your desire is to serve him question is is your desire to serve him made mistakes can you say like sister Bruce I've made so many mistakes absolutely made so many mistakes but that's why Christ died for my mistakes so I could still serve him because in this life there had to be mistakes Peter had to make a mistake others had to make mistakes things had to happen brother B had to do certain things he had to do you're like why why did he have to do it I can explain to you why but if it defeated God's purpose he wouldn't have done it he says in Hebrews the Hebrew series says you'll make mistakes you'll fall you'll willfully do wrong you'll go out sometimes and do things that don't mean you're lost that means you're going to get corrected I love how simple that you say but I did wrong and I did it premeditated I knew it was wrong and I did it anyways well well praise God you're going to get corrected and that correction will also work together for God's purpose he goes and the testimony upon the sea he says that's the reason our sins today would be everyone condemned but God can't take us because if he does he hurts Christ we're part of him we're the bride don't you see so there it is so Grace holds us in our mistakes until we can see better I love that statement we're making mistakes we're doing wrong sometime we've repeated the same mistakes over but his grace is holding us up in our mistakes till we can see better we're going to learn something we're going to see something better and until we learn the lesson or see what we're supposed to see grace is holding us up even in our mistakes aren't you glad for God's grace I can be making mistake after mistake after mistake but he's holding me up because why I've got to see something and when I see something then that's going to all be worth it now this this blessed me 1962 questions and answers this is a question brother Benham got said I lived many years in sin until I found the Lord please brother Benham I have sinned again I'm not worthy to come before you in this holy place please tell me if I can be restored holy again please help me brother brandom I have a devil in me help me will you lay your hands upon me and restore me again so now there is a question I never noticed it when I read it a while ago there's a question now if that person is present let me just read it to you I have lived many years in sin until I found the Lord please brother benam I have sinned again and I'm not worthy to come before you in this holy Place te tell me if I can be restored whole again so somebody who lived a life of sin until they were saved and come to the Lord and it looks like it sounds like they've repeated the same thing again they've sinned again they don't think they're worthy to even come before brother brandham and the church and they want to know if they can be restored and if brother BR lay hands on them and here's his answer yes yes period I love that before the explanation is the answer before any explan this person who wrote this you can pick up the turmoil in the way they wrote it I'm not even worthy to come like they're completely distraught they're flat on I mean they're flat on their belly on the ground if we would say that emotionally they have absolutely done what they never thought they would do again or what the lifestyle they had completely left and they've done it again they're not worthy to even come before brother brandom in this holy place of the church they want to know if they can be restored and brother B will lay hands on them and then the second question is what he reads is please tell me if I can be restored whole again he says yes he says you have not sined my friend so far in God but what you could be restored listen if you had sinned so far that you could not be restored you would never want to be restored right see but as long as there's something dealing with your heart you're still in line of restoration guilty of the least is guilty of the whole I have sinned many times every day every one of us do things that we don't want to do can you be restored yes how do you know because you want to be restored how many of us have the same testimony of whoever wrote this out I'd lived in sin many years so I come to the Lord but I sinned again and sometimes I sinned again with the same the very same thing that was the trap for me before can I be restored I'm not worthy of he says there's no way you've gone so far in God that you can't be restored because if you went that far that you couldn't be restored you would no longer have a desire to be restored right the very desire to be restored is the evidence you can be restored amen right listen there's no matter what's happened in your life and what decision you made and what wrong thing you've done you may have repeated a sin you thought you would never repeat in your life but listen he loved you before you sin the first time and his love is never going to change no matter how time many times you repeat the same thing because his his love was fixed before and his purpose was fixed before will you suffer yes will there be consequences yes will correction come absolutely but but you'll never be Beyond Redemption as long as you still want Redemption that's the devil that's lying telling you you've gone so far that God won't hear your prayer you can't be restored or God can't use you anymore then why are you still here and why do you have a desire to serve him why do you still love you but why do you still want to be whole why do you still want to display Christ to the world if you're not going to be restored if God doesn't have a purpose in your life remember God's not doing anything in vain everything is for his purpose this I want you to think of this quote as I read this in the message and knoweth it not 65 1965 now this outside man is the flesh that's what we look at what we see and has five inlets to the body and any grammar school child as myself would know there's five senses controlling the body see taste feel smell and here without that you can't touch the body that's the only way you have to the body now that this is what I want you to understand now that is the evil one on the outside what where is the evil one he's lurking in uh drug houses and he's moving in houses of prostitution and no where's the evil one I'm living inside the evil one born wrong born in sin come into the world speaking lies the one that has a sticky ccer nature that's going to trouble me the rest of my life we are set up for failure why did God not stop the fall because it worked for his purpose brother B said you can never understand God and all the attributes of God against the backdrop of white but white doesn't stand out against white so if everything was perfect we wouldn't understand a perfect God we wouldn't understand a God who can heal and a God who can deliver and a God who can save but he said White shows up against the contrast of black so God will allow man to fall to create the contrast and in the contrast we will understand God and all his Holiness his righteousness his salvation his Deliverance his healing why did God let us make mistakes maybe we needed a contrast of black in our own lives so that we would know the difference between me and God so that we would know God and all his Holiness and his righteousness his Deliverance his forgiveness his love his faithfulness and in his purpose why did he and with this why did he stop brother Brenham so many times from doing something that would harm him or hurt and why did he allow him so many times to do something that would hurt or be wrong it's a million-dollar question we look at brother Ram's life and we say it was all perfect that what you say it was perfect it all worked out perfect in the end it was all perfect everything God did worked out perfect look at the ministry look at look at how he moved from the first to second third pole look at how the ministry got greater and how he learned so many things about God and he didn't fall into the same traps and you look this happened and this happened and that happened and now look at him at the end of the ministry and the opening of the word and it was is perfect but the only reason we say that is because we didn't live through it amen we didn't have those flashback moments in our mind when we remembered what we did we didn't have the times of weeping when we look through a photo album for us we look from the vantage point of watching a whole man's life and knowing who he was in the scriptures and how God dealt with him all the way and we look from this vantage point back and say it's perfect it worked to God purpose God had he had to learn those things he had to have training we do the same thing with the Apostle Paul we do the same thing with Peter we do the same thing with Moses and we look back and say they blew it but look it's perfect they had to learn something they had to be broken they had to have humility they had to have a greater understanding of what this was and we say it's perfect and then we come to our life and say it's nothing but a big mess and God can never use me maybe our lives are just like the rest of them maybe it's just the same for us maybe there's things that God has stopped us from and and not permitted and changed our ideas and and absolutely arrested the situation and changed it because it would have defeated his purpose but maybe there's times that we failed and we failed big because it also will work together for his purpose and do something that will benefit his purpose and benefit us long term so at the end of all of this I want to say our failures will never be stronger than his purpose when he chose Jacob over Esau it wasn't because of their Merit their conduct their personality he chose them before they manifest any of those things and when they began to manifest their characteristics you and I would have picked the one over the other to be the child of God the one to carry forth the promise we wouldn't have picked Jacob we would have picked Esau and it wasn't based on Merit and conduct and doing right or doing wrong because Joseph did wrong and did wrong and did wrong and did wrong and did wrong but it was God's choice and every wrong somehow worked together for right according to God's purpose sir what about my life and your life I say if we're children of God it's the same thing and so what I want more than anything for me and for you is I want the devil to lose the the Mind battle I want Satan to lose the Mind Battle of why didn't God stopped me or why didn't I just make another choice or why or every time I fail I'll never amount I can never be I I may not be I must not be I probably I want the devil to lose the Mind battle today friends and I want God's promised word to Prevail I want us to take the sword of the word and drive back every lie of the enemy amen everything that's tried to hinder us or hold us back or keep us from moving forward brother bam had a whole slew of mistakes amen he messed up the first and second pool but that never stopped God from using him for the third pool yeah amen amen you and I messed up this message but that never stopped us from from using us to Manifest this message we've mishandled things we've said things wrong we may have taught it the wrong way we may have displayed it the wrong way we may have messed it all up with our own humanity and our own mind and we say I've messed this up so bad God will never use me again tell me where that is in the scripture who else is going to manifest the word amen God has a purpose friends and I'm thankful that I believe he has a purpose for me and I believe he has a purpose for you and nothing in our lives will stop God's purpose so what do we do with the bad things we're just going to have to do what everybody else did with the bad things we're going to have to do what Abraham did we're going have to do what Moses did we're going to have to do what Peter did we're going to have to do what Paul did we're going to have to do what all of them did deal with our regrets be sorry for what we did and move forward in the program of God what am I going to do with all my I got to do the same thing brother bam did with all his regrets and all of his hurt and all the consequence I got to do the same thing they all did yeah I got to move forward in the program of God and let God use me for his great purpose I want to look at one scripture as the musicians come let's turn together to Psalms 37 and we can stand to read this let's stand and read Psalms 37 musicians will come and brother Blake if you'll come Psalms 37 Psalms 3723 in Psalms 27:33 it says the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall wait a second stop stop didn't it just say the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord if God ordered his steps and what's he doing falling why did he fall if God ordered his steps steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not utterly be cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand amen has anybody fallen in here before do you know where you fell you fell into the hand of God you're a child of God seing of God with a purpose of God in this life God uphold you with his hand your your steps are directed and though you fall you're not utterly cast down means you never fell completely out of the program of God where did you fall you fell back into the hand of God how do you know that brother Chad because you're still here with excuses to be anywhere else with heartaches and broken heart and mistakes and mind battles and all kinds of opportunities have walked away and left but when you fell where did you fall you fell back in the hand of God not utterly cast down I am so thankful that he held me in his hand I know he has there was times I felt like I was on the floor and under the floor and under the ground but I looked back and realized if it wasn't for him upholding me I would have been gone lost destroyed there must have been a hand holding me in my fall there must have been only so low that I can go there must have been only so far that I could fall until he stopped amen hdden his hand and I could get back up and keep serving God's purpose amen I so thank God he's been there all my life he supernaturally delivered me friends I've had God speak to me in my heart to warn me and what he said was absolutely the truth and stop me from going a wrong direction or accepting something false Supernatural unbelievable but I've had more times when he said nothing and until some of those times when he said nothing I've had many of them I made the wrong choice yes and I did things that hurt me and hurt others you know what I'm still in his hand you might be here this morning and you've just Fallen Fallen recently fallen and made a mistake but I'm telling you if you're God's child you just fell into his hand I encourage you just get up and let the fall work his purpose in your life do we get discouraged yes do we get hurt yes but just move forward friends just go on with the program of God go from the first pool to the second pool to the third pool whatever God has in your life just go on and serve God for everything's working for his purpose amen let's bow our heads together and pray Lord Jesus we thank you for the privilege of being here God I pray that you would take the words that were preached and make them real and alive in our hearts give us strength and courage Lord to keep pressing forward Lord by your grace for Lord we see I look back and I see where you held me up by Grace until I could see and God no doubt there's still areas in my life where you're holding me up by Grace until I can see I just say God I I want to serve you Lord I want to serve your purpose in my life I want to be yielded to that and I pray forgive me Lord of my mistakes forgive me of my failures Lord my sins forgive this people Lord your children we all we want to serve you Lord we we want to be children that you can use for your Kingdom Purpose we want to be used by you for deliverance and for manifestation for all the things you want to do through your bride but oh God so so many times we've been so discouraged by the failures and by The Faults and by the constant cycle of difficulty I pray God that you would give us a new vision this morning that we wouldn't be beat down by the past but Lord that may everything that we do Propel us further into your purpose may we see everything Lord with a clearer vision with prophetic eyes to recognize with Eagle Vision to recognize that there's nothing that you're allowing amen that's going to defeat your purpose but it must all work together for good God we want to keep moving forward give us strength give us courage help those Lord that the devil has Bound in their mind free them I pray in Jesus Christ's name Satan you are a liar you lie against the word word you're contrary to God's Will and plan and contrary to the word and I curse you in the name of Jesus Christ leave these people alone God May the sweet Dove of your Holy Spirit come and bring the reality of your word into greater manifestation in our lives and in our minds May the lives of the be enemy be abated Lord may we have confidence in you that you do all things well and that even in our lives you understand where we're at and when we don't understand you understand and when we can't see you can see and when we don't know you know help us to have confidence in you Lord pray that you bless your people as we leave here may we gain a greater confidence as we move forward in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you so we move forward in life man listen we preach this message is
