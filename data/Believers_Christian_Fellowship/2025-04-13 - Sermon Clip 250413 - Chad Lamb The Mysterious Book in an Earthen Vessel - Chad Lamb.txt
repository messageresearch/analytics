========================================

This mystery is God made flesh. So Jesus Christ is God made flesh. That's why the book is in him. Not something inside of him. But he is the manifestation of the contents of the book. The word made flesh. So then no man can touch this book. No man can look upon the book because it's sealed. No man, only the worthy one. And Christ steps forward because he paid the price of redemption for this book. Now he's going to lay claim to the book. And now he takes and he opens the seals of the book. And he comes down as the mighty angel in Revelation chapter 10. Now he's got an open book in his hand. Not a sealed book anymore. Now the mysteryy's been unveiled. Now it's open. Now a voice now comes to John, which John's a type of the bride. And a voice comes to John and says, "Go to the angel and take the book. Take it. Take it and eat it up. Amen. This is the book nobody could touch. Nobody could look at. Nobody could read. This was the book that Adam lost. No man could have it. This is the one that's been hiding in the flesh of Jesus Christ for safekeeping. And now at the opening of the seals under a seventh church age messenger, when the mystery of God's finished, now the seals have come off the book. Now the book has come back to earth. Where does the mighty angel put his feet? Brother Brandham said the seventh angels on earth at the time of this coming. He came and brought what did he bring back? He didn't bring back a piece of paper, friends. Amen. But he come back and he's told to take the book and eat it up. Amen. Do you see how complicated the book of Revelation is? If we're looking for some physical thing in a physical location, because we're looking for a physical thing, if we're looking for a list of names that are wrote down and and then on the day of judgment, Brother Benham said at the white throne judgment, that book will be opened and the names will read off. How's he going to open the book and read the names? John ate it. Where's the book? The Bible says John to took the book and he ate it up and in his in his mouth it was sweet as honey, but in his belly it was bitter. Amen. How is God going to take that same book and open it at the white throne judgment and start reading all the names of it? Check Bob. Check Susie. Check Harry. Check. Where's the book? The book was inside. Amen. God made flesh in Jesus Christ. Now, at the opening of the seals, he comes to John and represents the church and says, "Now I'm going to take the book back to earth and I'm going to put the book in another earthn vessel." And that other vessel is my many membered body, my bride. And now the book is secure in the bride. What is that book? It's the mystery of God that was in the back part of his mind. what God wanted to achieve in all the Bible that he wanted to become a family on the earth and fellowship together in harmony and in love and in fellowship. And now that book with all the names and all the contents and everything else is in a many member body.
