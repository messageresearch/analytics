I said how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the prince of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither hath entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the Deep things of God for what men know what the things of man say the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in the world in in Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for their foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we thank you Father for the privilege Lord to live in this hour Lord to be called out by a prophetic Ministry of voice in this day that's called us Lord out of laodicea the Lord called us out a denominationalism out of Darkness into light Lord and we just thank you for the privilege Lord of being here at this time when you're doing this work God we want to see more clearly than we've ever seen before we pray you call to us higher to come up higher and higher and higher as you revealed to us your word it may as we fly higher Lord may we see more clearly all around us and understand what it is you're doing in this day and may Lord we trust in you and have faith in what you're doing all around us and through us and amongst us and may all that we do in response be pleasing unto you every word that we would say all of our actions may they be pleasing to you Lord God I pray to that preeminence speak your word to us tonight break the bread of life this morning I mean Lord break it to us and feed us your sheep Dawn in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you you can be seated amen so this morning I'd like to take for a text if we could just give a title of spiritual war starts with revelation I'm going to read a quote that'll explain this but spiritual war starts with revelation and and I'm hoping that God will just bring out of my lips what he's put into my heart amen and that he'll do the he'll connect all the dots in your heart the pieces that maybe I leave off or not able to explain my God just been dealing with me in this way and and the context for the context I want to take out of this quote in the first seal brother man says now notice it's to be revealed when the lamb leaves his intercessory place from the father now that's Revelations 5. excuse me now he takes the book of seals the book of seals or a book of sealed with seals break them and shows them at the End of the Age now after the intercessory is over the church ages is done finished up he comes in the first stage he come in the first stage Ephesians age revealed sent the messenger now what happened as we go along so he's going to start explaining what's been happening to the church ages from the first stage on up I don't want to tell you too I'm still struggling with golfing but I don't care so I hope that it doesn't bother you I'll cough I'll clear my throat and God will loosen everything up in a few minutes and we'll be Off to the Races amen but you know I'm not gonna let the devil hinder the word of God with a tickle in the throat or an irritation in the lungs because we don't care one thing I've learned uh one thing I've learned is the devil wants attention and I don't care men I don't care that I'm coughing it doesn't bother me what I care about is preaching the word of God Amen hearing the word living the word and I just don't care it'll take care of itself God will take care of it we have promises no word all I have to do is focus on what he's given me to do so you focus all focus and don't let the devil distract either one of us going on in this quote in the first seal he says here's the plan of it the first thing happens there's an announcement in the heavens first what happened a seal is open what is that a mystery is unfolded and when a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sounds it declares a war or a plague Falls and a church age opened see what is the war part the angel of the church catches the mystery of God not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery of God and then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him Goes Forth to the people what does he do out there he begins to Proclaim that message and what does it start a war a spiritual war so he's going to the churches from the first age on Amen when that church-aged messenger would catch a mystery not yet fully revealed but he would catch a mystery in the opening of it as it's beginning to unfold and he would go forth proclaiming that he was sounding a trumpet amen and when he would Proclaim that he sounded trumpet and a trumpet always is a gathering to war remember him teaches that when he sound a trumpet it's a gathering it's a trumpets are for Gathering and this trumpet sound is gathering for war and he starts out with the truth and I'll read this just again so we catch what brother REM says he catches this mystery of God then he goes forth to the people goes forth to the people what does he do out there he begins to proclaim the message and what does this start a war a spiritual war and that's why I said spiritual war starts with revelation and it's important to note that and I want to I want to hold on to that that spiritual war starts with Revelation as as we move through this thought here and then God takes his messenger with the elect of that age and lays them away asleep and then he drops a plague upon them who rejected him a temporary judgment and then after that it's over then he goes on and they and they denominate and bring in denominations and start off with that man's work like of Wesley and all the rest of them and then it gets all on a scrapple again and then another mystery comes forth then what happens another messenger arrives on the earth for a church age see then when he arrives the trumpet sounds he declares war see and then what happens finally then he's caught away and then when he's laid away then the plague Falls destroys them spiritual death hits the church and she's gone that group then he goes on to another one oh it's a great plan until it comes to this last angel now he has no certain mystery but he gathers up all that's been lost in them other ages all the truth that wasn't truly revealed yet as the Revelation come then he reveals those things in his day if you want to read it there it is revelation 10 1 about 4 you'll get it all right takes the book of seals and breaks them and shows the seventh angel for this alone the mystery of God the mysteries of God is the ministry of the seventh angel now we just come through the church ages with even history proved that it's the Angel's message of the seventh Church all right Reveals All the Mysteries that's been in the past and all the things in the past Revelations 10 1-7 that's to be now remember in the days of the seventh angel he'll sounding forth blasting forth the gospel trumpet he is to finish all the mysteries of God so he shows us the pattern the pattern is that there'll be uh there'll be a mystery that's to be revealed he says a seal opens a Mysteries give out hey thank you brother praise God I can go for a long time now uh seal is open a Mysteries give out all right and the angel of the age catches that mystery and he goes to Proclaim it and as he goes to Proclaim it he's blasting out a gospel trumpet and in blasting out that gospel trumpet what is he doing he breaks down spiritual war he's declaring war he's Gathering the elect and what's the gospel Trump are doing Gathering the elect and once he's Gathering the elect for for spiritual warfare and that means the warfare that's taking on all around is always battling around the revealed Truth for the day that's where the battle is always taking place that's where the sounding of the trumpet is until it comes to this last Angel and in this last Angel he doesn't have any one certain truth he's Gathering up all the truths all that's been left off all the fragments and pieces and he's putting them together for one great revelation of the mysteries of God Amen and he reveals Christ as the mystery of God revealed amen and what does he do he blasts forth the trumpet want trumpet it would be the final gospel trumpet or the seventh gospel trumpet and in the seventh days that last gospel trumpet amen if and I just think about this if down Through the Ages Every new uh a revelation that's released everything that's come through the prophet the the messenger's message in each age would declare a spiritual war what kind of War would you expect when they're all gathered up into one and one last trumpet is blast I would say it would be the final war the final battle the final showdown for the Gentile bride if if each one of those pieces amen coming down broke out in spiritual war what will happen when he brings all the pieces together and delivers them in one great Revelation and one great mystery what kind of battle do you think will ensue them and what do we think the battle is about praise God that's what we want to talk about today in the in the church age book Brothers says now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word so we've mentioned this before but it's worth noting and keeping in your mind amen the the uh that exposes Satan revealing his works so what's his works what the devil is trying to do his works is the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word so if you want to know what the devil's doing this is what he's doing he's attempting the destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word because if we get if we can just uh let the prophet tell us what we need to know and kick out all human reasoning we'll find ourselves not fighting battles that have nothing to do with what the real Warfare is over will not be chasing things like denominational Believers or chasing things I mean they want to they want to fight uh about civil liberties they want to fight about abortion and all of that and there's nothing wrong with the causes there's nothing wrong with the truth that they're declaring abortions of sin it's evil it's wickedness it should be withstood and preached against I'm not I'm not I'm not diminishing the need for that but what I'm saying is if you put all your effort in that and you're fighting bars and you're fighting homosexual marriage and you're fighting all this you're you're not even where the Battleground is amen you're off in the weed somewhere totally distracted by a diversion tactic of the devil and not even really fighting the real issue the real issue is he's trying to destroy God's people and discredit God's word and what word is he trying to discredit the one that came with the trumpet blast the word that opened in this day amen that's bringing a revelation to the people amen and that's where the attack comes that's where the devil's working Amen brother man said he's not working in the bar room or the house of prostitution he said that's already on his grounds that's not where he's fighting that's not his works that's not where he's working where's he's working wherever the truth is proclaimed is where he's working and so if we don't if we don't pay attention to what the prophet's telling us we can so easily get caught up in the diversion tactics and we're not fighting the good fight of Faith because we're beating the air because these things are all symptoms of a greater problem amen and you can start chasing symptoms all you want but you got to get down to the root of the problem and the root of the problem is the people have left Christ and Christ is the word and he's the word made manifest in your day and by the rejection of Christ now all of these things are outcroppings of the main disease and the main disease is unbelief unbelief in what unbelief in the word in what word in the word for your day [Applause] I drank that so brother Jeremy's efforts would be worth something it wasn't wasted my brother you know that we've been so blessed to have a prophet in our day so that we don't get caught up in our own thinking and go chasing our towns and and distracted by things that that will never get us anywhere and we'll never accomplish anything uh if you don't fix the root problem it doesn't matter how much legislation you push for how many signs you put in your yard or how many rallies you attend amen even if you're able to diminish in a certain State a certain uh a certain level of abortion let's just say are a certain preservation of marriage it won't be any time that'll pop up worse than it was so you may win a temporary Victory and maybe a minor suppression here A minor suppression there and that's not a bad thing I'm not condemning that because I'm I'm against it all but you realize after a while all of your effort you're just getting tired you're just spinning your wheels because it's no real Victory it's no real reversal amen because the problem is the rejection of Christ the problem that brother Ben said is in the pulpits because they quit preaching Christ they quit preaching the word and they started preaching a historical Jesus and quit preaching Jesus of today and I just want to say it this way I I you know I love you guys you love me and I love you you know me I know you but but I say things and sometimes they come across sharp I don't mean them real sharp I just this is what's in my heart amen a historical Jesus amen if you believe if you're holding fast to only the historical part of the Gospel the historical part of the Gospel oh I want to say this right the historical part of the Gospel was the part that overcame in that day and it's the truth it's an absolute truth and never should be rejected it should be believed today and stood upon today but the the victory today comes through the revealed word of today because God has portioned his word out amen for each day to make sure that when the enemy comes like a flood he has a standard to raise against it and that standard is the revelation of the word and so that's why with with only faith in a historical gospel or historical Jesus and not receiving the present day Jesus you'll never have strength to overcome the present day spiritual war because this present-day spiritual war is all about the revelation of the word it's not about amen what happened two thousand years ago that's included in the word today that's included in all of the word is included today but it's the rejection of the word today it's the rejection of Jesus Christ's present tense that's causing all the other problems and so by the grace of God he's given us a prophet so that we can recognize we could recognize where the battle is and what the battle's over and what we should be doing all right so the I'm gonna keep going in the church age book here the devil to reveal his Works to Satan's works his attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he has cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates revelation but we love it Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them this these germs how amen is the armies of hell is the Fortress of hell it shall not Prevail over us but we shall Prevail over them how will I Prevail in this day how will I overcome how will I keep from the Gates of Hell overcoming me but I shall overcome them by true Revelation is the only way Victory only comes by true Revelation in this day true revelation of the true church and what she is true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian Church these these Revelations are what give us power over the gates of hell so I say the the most important thing in our life is true revelation let's turn together to Genesis I want to look at a couple things as we explore this thought Genesis chapter 3. in Genesis 3 verse 1. now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yeah God said You shall eat of every tree of guard of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the servant said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doesn't know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as God's knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons now the reason I go to this uh scriptures I just want to point out a principle that we see here that still applies today and that principle is this that information without revelation will lead to deception I'll say that a couple times so you catch and I'll explain my meaning information without revelation will lead to deception because Eve had the information she was told what not to do she was given instructions she had the word but it's obvious she had no Revelation on that word because if she had Revelation on that word she would have never compromised on the word amen because we know this is true that she had no Revelation because she was beguiled by the devil and when you have a revelation you're not beguiled because you understand so she didn't have understanding what she had was information and information without revelation will lead to deception amen and this is true today think about it friends we've got we've got more Bibles more Bible translations more Bible commentaries more Bible schools more Bible knowledge is available than there's ever been where you can read the Greek you can read the Hebrew you can read I mean you can read in all kinds of forms and Fashions but information without revelation will lead to deception because that's what that's what's happening in all the denominational world they're going into deception because they have information with no revelation and because there's no Revelation the devil can manipulate the information amen I tell you friends you can talk to somebody if you've got somebody who really knows their Bible and really has studied their Bible and you know they're really they're not just a they're not just a Sunday only Christian but somebody who really knows their Bible and you begin to sit down and talk to them you'll realize that for for you bring a scripture they'll bring a scripture scripture in scripture scripture in scripture you can do it for trinitarianism you can do it you know uh whatever you bring scripture and you can have a discussion for 30 minutes 40 minutes an hour and in that discussion you can never go to an agreement come to an agreement but you can be speaking the scriptures the entire time they can be going from verse to verse and you're going from verse to verse amen but information without revelation will lead to deception because the devil has always taken the information that is given to the children of God Amen and he's come in and he's perverted that and twisted it with reasonings and human thinking and humanism amen and he's perverted the information and he's brought deception age after age after age after age and so Eve doesn't have a revelation she's beguiled she's deceived she thought she was doing right she didn't have the revelation but but let's go on to chapter four chapter four verse 3. and Adam knew Eve his wife and also conceived in Bear cane and said I have gotten the man from the Lord and and she Bears brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground and in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel also he brought up the first things of his flock and the fact thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel into his offering but unto Cain into his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Roth in his countenance fell here we have a a situation where we start to see Revelation come on the scene brother man tells us and we read in Hebrews 11 Hebrews 11 4 I'll just recite this by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yes speaketh Able by faith Brethren said faith is a revelation amen faith is a revelation and by Revelation Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice and you know I made this I made this statement that uh information without revelation will lead to deception but now think about this revelation right revelation will bring revelation will bring the truth with missing information right God didn't come down until Abel don't offer this and offer that we have no record of God saying the only thing that will be acceptable to me is a lamb don't offer fruits don't offer this but somehow without all the information Abel was able to catch Revelation and in that Revelation he was able to act in a way that was pleasing to God and by Faith by Revelation he caught the mystery he caught the understanding that wasn't always given out in the detailed information like I've heard people before say you know along these lines it's not exact quote but along the lines I wish brother Branham would have explained it more clearly I wish it wasn't fragmented or broke I wish I wish that we didn't have to battle over was it this or that or the seeming discrepancies or the unclarity or or the the way in which he presented it I wish that it was like on PowerPoint and I wish that he had stayed in his line of thinking and never jumped around like they've never said all those words but they said as much as that I wish it was clear and and I'll tell you friends it doesn't matter how clear he would have made it and how clearly he would have sat on table and explain it to you without Revelation it would have still brought deception because information without revelation will bring deception but brother Brandon would preach in such a way he would say I hope you're catching my meaning without me coming right out and saying it wait what's it going to take what is it going to take to overcome in this day to win this spiritual war I mean what's it going to take is whatever Abel had whatever Abel had from God where he was without detailed information able to catch the right thought of God and offer the right sacrifice that would be pleasing to God that God would then turn around and say that testifies that he is righteous his righteousness was on display because of his Revelation and without the detailed information he caught the mystery he understood what was needed he offered the he gave the right action he offered the right sacrifice and God testified that he is righteous Cain didn't catch anything I mean I shouldn't say he didn't catch anything Kane caught a lot Kane caught the fact that God was a true God and one God he was worthy of worship and Cain wanted to worship God because he knew there was one true God and that God was worthy to be worshiped Cain knew a lot can't had information amen Cain brother Venom says those two boys were raised in the same home with the same spiritual instruction they saw the same things they had heard the same explanations they had heard the same stories they had watched the same performance and actions of of Adam and Eve but one caught the mystery and the other one amen went about doing what he thought was best based off all the information that he had amen and for us you know if we if take away all our Bible Understanding and just go back to Cain and Abel and just watch these two boys work watch these two men offer their sacrifice and and you know go to them and interview them and say uh you know what sacrifice did God tell you to bring and he said well God never told us what to bring well well what makes you want to worship well I know he's God and I I know he deserves worship and and I know this and I know that and but I but what does he want I don't know but but but Cain says well I think what I'm going to do is I'm just going to do the very best that I can do because I don't know what else I'm going to do the very best that I can do and in the very best that I can do I'm going to you know plant my vegetables I'm going to build an altar I'm gonna do I'm gonna do whatever I can do because he hasn't told me and Abel you interview Abel and yes Abel Abel what are you going to do Abel says I'm not really sure yet I don't know are you going are you working at it already not not really what have you started doing I haven't really started doing anything and you're like but but you know there's one true God and you know he's worthy to be worshiped and you know you must bring us yes yes I know all of that's true what are you going to bring I don't know what are you going to do about it I don't know when are you going to get started I don't know so if you just as a human being start looking at this thing without spiritual understanding I mean none of us in our Earthly existence in our human mind none of us would fault game none of us would look at Cain and say Cain you know because nobody told him but there was something told there was something on display there was something there there was a mystery that laid out and maybe it was between the lines that he had to read maybe he wasn't said right out but there was something laying there that Abel had the capacity to catch and when he caught it amen when he caught it and he did what God wanted what God desired it proved that he was righteous then I wish I just had all the information I wish it was just laid out I I said I don't care if I have all the information and all the information I just want revelation amen I want a heart that can receive Revelation from God and I want the spirit of God that can Quicken something inside of me because if I've got missing Revelation missing books missing pieces amen the revelation will peace what's there together the right way and the sacrifice that I offer will be pleasing to my father because I worship in spirit and in truth by what by revelation let's look at a little further now verse six and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wrath and why is thy countenance Fallen if thou do as well shall thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well send life at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him now we know this story super well so there's nothing new that I'm telling you here but you realize that Cain with no capacity to receive revelation even when he got the correct information God said now listen why is your count has fallen why are you Roth this is God talking to him now why are you upset why are you angry listen to what I'm telling you just do what Abel did just just repeat just copy paste just do what Abel did and want to be well with you and you see a fundamental uh principle right out of the Book of Genesis that even even with the correct information without Revelation it'll lead to deception and now Cain is now guilty of self-deception because now he has the Revelation and under the Revelation he cannot he has nothing in him he has no capacity to receive it even though Jesus said repeat step one step two step three God has told him just do this one two three everything will be fine but he has no capacity in himself to to receive it but what he does instead of just doing what God said he goes and has a conversation with Abel and we know that Abel has the correct revelation we know that Abel knows why he offered a lamb he knows why it had to be blood the prophet explains all this to us and he knows why it's got to be blood why it had to be a lamb and and now they have a conversation and this conversation so infuriates Cain that Cain now kills Abel and he said why what could he have done the only thing I know that he could done is but tell him the reason for his revelation but but you realize that even after Cain or the discussion in Abel explaining whatever he explained to Cain instead of Cain being humble repentant instead of Cain going back and just doing what God Said Cain so wanted his own lie to be true that he had to stop any voice that opposed his lie see all the way back in Genesis God tells us what we're going to be dealing with today same Spirits it's the same things that are happening today let's go to John chapter 8. John chapter 8 verse 39. they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus saith unto them if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that had told you the truth where did we see this before you seek to kill me a man that has told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham ye do the Deeds of your father then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even God they knew what he was talking about we be not born a fornication we're not of Cain and he says in your actions prove where you came from because you seek to kill me when what have I done I told you the truth Abraham would have never done that but you claim to be children of Abraham you haven't taken the nature of Abraham and you know Jesus is not disputing whether or not they're of the genealogy of Abraham but they're not children of Abraham because the children of Abraham are the children of Promise by faith and he said you are not children of Abraham and they could have showed their pedigree maybe done if it was current day they could have done a DNA test and proved that they had come from Abraham but they were not Abraham's children because Abraham's children were the children of promise by the word so their word children Faith children amen and we are Abraham's children and he said you you you you claim to be Abraham's children but you seek to kill me a man that told you the truth and Jesus ties it right back to the first murder all the way back in the beginning because he's dealing with the same exact Spirit Jesus is there he is the word made flesh he is God in flesh and he is there giving them the correct interpretation of the word and he's giving the people who should receive the word he's giving them the word the people who claim to love the word he's giving them the word the people there's people there that their entire Earthly existence Pharisees Sadducees the high priests their entire Earthly existence is based on the word [Music] they're ministers full-time ministers getting full support their whole life is this word and he comes and he brings him the word but the word that he brings doesn't match the word that they want to be true oh praise God let's look at Matthew 15. I want to read a couple passages right here in the Gospels Matthew 15 and 1. then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread but he answered and said unto them why do you also transgress the Commandment of God by your tradition for God commanded saying honor thy father and mother and he that curses father and mother let him die to death but you say whoever whoever whosoever shall say to his father or his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me and on and on his father or his mother he shall be free thus have you made the Commandment of God of none effect by your tradition ye Hypocrites well did isaiahs prophesy of you saying this people drawth nine to me with their with their mouth and honors me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men Jesus is there laying it straight his disciples are walking through a field on a Sabbath day and they're plucking corn they're taking that corn and they're eating it just taking in hand and eating it and they say why do your disciples do not according to the tradition and Jesus answering them he says why do your Traditions go against the Commandments of God who who cares about the disciples going against the traditions of the fathers the bigger deal is your Traditions going against the Commandment of God and he brings an example to show them but then you think they would receive it they won't even receive it amen that he gives them the Commandment of God that they're violating they don't repent they don't change they go back to wanting to defend the tradition of the fathers nothing changes everything stays the same Jesus told them in John he says do not think that I will accuse you to the father there is one that accuses you even Moses in whom you trust for how do you believe Moses you would have believed me for he wrote of me but if you believe not his writings how shall you believe my words now he's hitting them right where it hurts because he's saying he's saying you claim to believe the message of the hour and you and I'm telling you what Moses wrote but if you won't believe what Moses wrote how will you believe me and there these are the guys that are studying Moses's writings every day they're the ones who have charged with the Scrolls that are writing them scribes who are transcribing them that their whole system is built around the law of Moses and he's telling them there you don't believe Moses if you believe Moses you believe me and they won't move off their tradition let's go to Mark Mark three let's go here together Mark 3 and 1. and he entered in again into the synagogue and there was a man there which had a withered hand and they watched him whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day that they might accuse him and he saith unto the man which had the withered hand stand forth and he saith unto them is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath days or to do evil to save life or to kill and they held their peace well of course they held their peace what are they going to say he says is it better to do good or do evil well I mean what are they going to say is it better to to heal or to kill they have nothing they can say because they know if they say to heal then they cannot condemn him if he heals the man if he says to save life he cannot heal him for saving the man amen but now they know they're in a conundrum because they can't say it's good to do evil or good to kill and Jesus is trying to show him the fallacy of their human thinking he said but they held their peace verse 5 and when he had looked around about on them with anger Jesus got angry he looked at them with anger being Greed for the hardness of their hearts he said unto the man stretch forth thine hand and he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole as the other and the Pharisees went forth and straightway took counsel with the herodians against him how they might destroy him why because he's proclaiming the truth he's sounding the gospel Trump and and sounding the trumpet he's declaring spiritual war and now he's giving a truth and that truth just like in the face of Cain the truth that he's giving amen is contrary to the truth that they've held amen and because he's giving a truth that's contrary to the truth they held they want they want to shut him up because he's a challenging their belief I don't know if you've ever come in contact with a religious spirit I'm sure you are but you get a good church member somebody that goes to church and you start to talk to them and the minute you step on their toe in the scripture I mean all of a sudden it's like you stroke the cat backwards I mean the claws come out the eyes turn red they get super angry and you see that the response is not I mean the response is shocking like you can tell that they themselves are shocked or even some of their family members are shocked because you realize what you're dealing with right there is not a human being what you're dealing with right there is a spirit a religious spirit that does not want you to challenge the status quo does not want you to challenge the false form of worship and expose The Hiding Place of the devil Jesus was walking around daily exposing the devil's hiding place he's hiding in religion he's hiding in the church he's hiding in the priesthood he's hiding in the traditions of the fathers that's where the devil was hiding trying to bring a deception but guess what they had all the information and all the information couldn't stop the deception I think it's remarkable that when Jesus was walking through the Earth and he when he was when he had his ministry on the earth that you see that he got tax collectors and he gone fishermen and he gone uh you know who was attracted to him harlots and and those were sicknesses and and mostly he was widespread rejected by the elites by the by the intellectuals by the by the church officials but he's accepted by those who are ignorant and unlearned because those who who were the church officials and had uh their their reputation based off what they believe in their whole lifestyle they could not afford for what he was saying to be true and it wasn't the men it was the spirit of the devil trying to keep his stronghold in the church that's why God sent us a prophet in this day and that Prophet absolutely blasted the walls out of denominationalism out of church systems out of traditional beliefs Creeds and dogmas and intellectualism of men he actually blasted it away and he sold Master Jesus ministry when Jesus came out Healing The Sick and doing Miracles and wonders amen they all flocked to him and they all thought it was wonderful amen but when he began to start breaking down the word and challenging the system of the day and challenging amen the beliefs of the day amen they turned on him and they wanted to destroy him and here he is he's got a man with a withered hand and here he's going to show I mean he's going to show the sign that God is here the god that created the hand is the god that's going to restore the hand and they don't want a God that can restore a hand they want a God that vindicates their traditional belief I tell you what the same thing can be true today amen they don't want a God that can deliver they don't want a God that can heal they don't want a God who can answer the questions they want a God who will confirm what they already hold to be true and we're gone on this day so thoroughly confirmed his word through a prophetic Ministry amen now they begin to call it Blasphemous names they begin to call it works of the devil and and a man who went off in the end they begin to call it all kinds of names and then although he did the same sign that Jesus did there when the man stretched forth his withered hand they sought how they might destroy him how do we destroy this ministry just speak evil against it tell the people don't go out there don't listen don't believe so we've seen a repeat in the same day all the way down to this day right here brother Ben says in the in the Ephesians Church age from the church age book so no matter how just an upright of Christian is before the public and how gracious he is to his fellow man doing not but good let him confess Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the holy spirit in tongues prophecy healing Miracles and he will be condemned the spirit of this world hates the spirit of God and because it can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in which the spirit of Truth dwells hmm persecution and trials are a natural normal part of Christian Life I'm going to read that again I should encourage us all persecution and trials are a natural normal part of the Christian Life there is only one thing you can do about them commit them all to God judge not and leave their outworking and final judgment to him so the one phrase that I want to labor on is it because because it can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in which the spirit of Truth dwells we saw this in the life of Jesus we saw in the disciples when we saw it even even brother Branham brother Branham uh believed he was convinced that one day he would be shot for what he taught he so knew that that spirit and how that Spirit worked and that Spirit hated him he knew it was after him and the same thing's true today but there's only a resemblance of Christianity that's holding it by but the same the same spirit's still here and wants to destroy you so uh further down in the in the laodicean church age out of the church age book he says these things saith thee amen I like that it means that whatever he said is final it means that whatever he said to the first age and to the second to all ages about his own true church and about the false Vine is exactly right and it won't change it means that what he started out with in Genesis he will finish in Revelation he has to for he is the amen so let it be now we can see again why the devil hates the Book of Genesis in Revelation he hates the truth he knows the truth will prevail he knows what his end will be and how he fights that but we are on the winning side we I mean the Believers of his word only are on the amen side so now what does the devil hate what does the devil fight truth what was he fighting in Jesus day truth what was he finding and Abel's day truth what were they fighting in brother Brandon say truth what are they fighting today what is that Spirit what is the devil fighting truth and I want to look at that statement again out of the Ephesians Church age when he says because he knows he can't defeat the spirit of God knows he can't knows that he that the word will prevail amen he because he can't stop it he tries to destroy the vessel in which the spirit of Truth dwells and we look at that in the past and we see you know persecutions and executions and all that but but I say it comes let's bring it down closer to home today because you have the revelation of the word and you know the truth that can expose the devil's hiding place the devil will try to destroy your vessel and we think well you know I'm not in danger of being shot I mean it's not the the Jesuit Vigilantes are after me but no he'll bring anything he can to destroy your physical vessel to try to stop the truth from coming forth he'll bring sickness and mental oppression and all kinds of discouragement and disappointment and all kinds of things why are you so much under attack in this day amen it's not as though we we you know we get the wrong idea sometimes that when we get the truth we'll be an invisible Army an invincible Army is an Untouchable Army in an invincible Army is not an Untouchable Army it's an army that can't be defeated and so now the devil is launching attacks and he's launching attacks in our life he's launching attacks in our mind he's launching attacks in our body it means bringing Affliction and sickness and fear and trouble and all kinds of stuff coming our way and you want to know why every day of your life is trouble and you go from one trouble to the next trouble with hardly reprieve in between it's because he hates the truth that is inside of you and he's trying whatever he can to stop the truth from displaying out because he can't fight that truth he can't fight that Spirit of Revelation he can't stop it from winning so he's trying to destroy the vessel so that the vessel won't proclaim the truth he's tried imprisonment he's tried sickness he's tried everything but he's not going to win because God is predestinated a bride in this day that'll stand on the word and the word only and she will Proclaim that word she will live that word she'll Proclaim it with her words she'll Proclaim it with her life she'll Proclaim it with her actions amen it'll be the word on display and he will not win but I think it behooves us to understand what's going on because spiritual war starts with revelation it begins with revelation amen that's why the higher you go in Revelation the more the more your life falls into trouble is the opposite of what a human being would think the higher I go in Revelation the more ordered my life should be and everything should come along amen no because you've got an enemy a real enemy and when the trumpet blasts amen there's spiritual warfare declared Amen in that spiritual warfare is all about the revelation of the hour and as you catch the Revelation in the hour and it gets clearer and clearer and you have the audacity to Proclaim it you better watch out because all the forces of hell are coming against that truth amen it's not you as a person the devil doesn't hate your air hair color your shape your size your birth he doesn't care about where you come from where you live that's not what the devil's after the devil's after the truth that is held in your heart yeah and he will stop at nothing I promise you he'll stop at nothing to stop that truth where has the battle always been every age every Prophet every child of God every move of the Holy Spirit everyone the enemy has been trying to stop those vessels they would cut Isaiah's head off they would throw Jeremiah into a dungeon they would hang Jesus on the cross they would kill every one of the disciples except for John what was the devil trying to do it wasn't that they had anything against Peter when Peter was a fisherman he had no problems I mean he may have had a problem they didn't get his daily catch it might have once in a while had a financial problem and had a bad day and broken that and got a boat leak you're saying he lived a normal human life but when Peter caught the revelation of the hour and started proclaiming the revelation of the hour there went his normal life with his normal troubles his troubles went up times 10 times 20 times 50 because now the Warfare was all around him he was in the middle of a battle a spiritual war between two opposing forces see I I don't want us to get discouraged because of what's Happening it should be happening it ought to be happening it ought to be getting worse if the Revelation is getting clearer the attempted destruction of Your Vessel should get stronger do you agree with that would that be normal from what we've seen in the Bible amen the Apostle Paul amen let's just turn to Galatians I want to read something out of the life of the Apostle Paul Galatians chapter one look at Galatians 1. I'm gonna start with verse 10. for doing not persuade men or God or do I seek to please men for I yet please men I should not be the servant of Christ but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ for you have heard of my conversion in times past in the Jews religion stop right there I'm going to read that again if you've heard of my conversion in times past in the Jews religion he was converted from the Jews religion he wasn't in the truth he thought he was in the truth but what he found out is he was in the Jews religion many of us who have come out of denominationalism we thought we were in the truth but for me personally I thought I was in the truth but I found out I was in the Pentecostals religion because they had taken the truth and the devil had gotten in after the Revival went forth it declared blew a trumpet spiritual warfare broke out the church went into spiritual death the devil got in and corrupted the truth and perverted the truth and kept them from moving forward when the prophet of God came and so I thought that I was raised in truth like Paul thought he was raised in truth I thought I knew the truth like Paul thought he not knew the truth I defended it and fought for and stood up for it because I thought it was true just like Paul thought it was truth but Paul when he received the revelation of Jesus Christ he knew he had to be converted from the Jews religion because he wasn't in the truth he was in the Jews religion and I tell you there's there's Jews religion everywhere there's man-made religion all over the place that's not the truth but the truth is found in the revelation of Jesus Christ and when Paul came to the revelation of Jesus Christ he was convert him if you've heard of my conversation and time passed in the Jew's religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it and profited listen to this and profited in the Jews religion and profited in the Jewish religion being in the Jews religion was good for Paul oh praise God good Lord God give us eyes to see being in the Jews religion was profitable for Paul verse 14 again and propheted in the Jewish religion above many my equals in my own Nation being more exceedingly zealous of the truth of the traditions of the fathers but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son and me that I might preach him among the Heathen immediately I confer not with flesh and blood neither when I up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me but I went to Arabia and returned again unto Damascus Paul he knew that he had to get away from the Jews religion when he receives the revelation of Jesus Christ he ran into the Wilderness he receives it not a man but he received it from Christ himself God gave him a revelation of the truth and he was able to see he was able then to clearly see that he was zealous for the wrong thing that he was profiting in the Jews religion and I tell you the Apostle Paul's life was fine when he was in the Jews religion the Apostle Paul was profiting in that religion he was successful in that religion he was receiving accolades from his peers he was it was things were going fine and it doesn't mean that he didn't have a normal sickness from time to time and the normal things that happened in the normal life but I tell you when he left the Jews religion and he was converted away from one of the traditions of the fathers and he came to the present day truth I'll tell you right now all hell broke loose on Paul every gun every gun and devil in hell was now aiming for Paul now Paul was chased from City to City he had distresses without distresses within turmoil on the sea and beatings and floggings and stonings and chasing from City to City his life totally switched amen when he came from error to truth he went from a good life to a very uncomfortable life it happened to Peter James John it happened to Simon having to to all of them amen they had their normal life they were in the Jews religion they thought they had the truth everything was seemingly fine normal of course normal problems normally everything but all of a sudden amen when they began to proclaim the truth there was a gospel trumpet that sounded in their day and when they rallied to that gospel trumpet they realized all hell broke loose all of a sudden they they were hated Peter wasn't hated when he was a fisherman he was hated when he proclaimed the truth Paul wasn't hated in false religion he was hated when he came to the truth and now and I I wanna uh Focus here for just a minute don't look for persecution from church groups and think that the only way that I'll feel this kind of pressure is from church groups that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about every devil in hell wants to shut you down and it may not be involve another church group it may not be a religious persecution it may not be religious persecution it may be an Affliction in your flesh it may be a loss of income from a loss of a job it may be trouble upon trouble upon trouble it could be your house fire car breakdown I mean I know any number of things the attempt of the devil is to get that truth suppressed suppress the truth because he doesn't want to hear the truth he doesn't want the truth to get out when Jesus started speaking the truth amen he was fine Jesus lived 30 years upon the Earth and we have no record of him having trouble with any other human being no record of any religious re any priest anybody in his town any levite any priest that wanted to do anything to Jesus Christ we have no record of anybody being against him attacking him saying negative things about him until he stepped forth and began to Proclaim his message and as soon as he began to Proclaim his message even his own family began to question him and doubt him and accuse him Jesus comes into his hometown amen it begins to speak in the synagogue with authority and they're amazed at how he speaks well wisdom where did he get this wisdom and he does all of these Miracles and then he healed the sick and then they it says isn't this the carpenter isn't this the carpenter isn't his brothers with us and his mother and and it says and they were offended at him it we have no record that they were offended before when he was a boy in the street when he was growing up and they said isn't this the carpenter so apparently he had some occupation among them rubbed shoulders with the community maybe I don't know you could only imagine what it was like for 30 years then all of a sudden everything changed because a prophet declared him the Holy Ghost anointed him he went into his ministry when he went into his ministry every devil in hell come after him why do I have so many troubles if I'm a Child of God if I believe the truth why isn't it working for me I'd say it's working just right everything's right on time everything's going according to the Bible nothing's out of kilter amen you Jesus says be of good cheer this is be of good cheer in this life you shall have tribulation oh okay and be of good cheer be of good cheer in this life you've got tribulation but I have overcome I have overcome the world I've ever and when he overcame I overcame when he says be of good cheer in this life you've got tribulation that's a given amen a man that is born a woman is a few days in full of troubles he looks at his disciples hey they're the Disciples of the Lord the chosen of the Lord the anointed to carry forth his word he's promised that he will come in them and he will continue on his ministry inside of them amen they've got all kinds of promises they've got all kinds of power coming to them and he promised them you shall have tribulation they'll be of good cheer oh friends I'll tell you right now you will have tribulation but be of good cheer he's overcome the world the victory is sure so what's the goal what's the end goal what does the devil want to do he wants to suppress the truth where is the truth it's in the bride where's the truth it's in the bride if you can say the truth is in me then I'll tell you right now there's two hundred thousand thousand demons Special Forces demons that have been released in the end time and if you want to know what those demons are like go and read about the Holocaust because those demons went into the armies of Hitler Mussolini and Stalin and they brought a bitter persecution against the Jews those are those demons and brother remember those demons come out amen those demons come out under the a sixth trumpet and under the Sixth trumpet they go out and they bring a persecution and God allows it because he's driving the Jews back to their Homeland but you see what nature that these Spirits have right and then he tells us later that they couldn't get over into the ecclesiastical Realm because they couldn't cross Euphrates because the Catholic church and all the other Protestants they had to keep a semblance of Christianity so he couldn't cross over but then and then brother Branham comes along and he says now amen they've crossed over Euphrates which goes right to the sixth vile he's tying these these things together in the end time and he's showing now they've moved over into ecclesiastical realm and what are they doing now these two hundred thousand thousand demons amen are not bringing a bitter persecution against the Jews anymore now they're coming he said what are they coming for for the denomination no they're coming for the bride so those same hateful spirits that hated Jews Without a Cause that changed laws that brought persecution amen then trapped and killed and all of those horrible things they did those same Spirits now moved over into the ecclesiastical realm now they're Church Spirits they're working in churches what are they trying to do they're trying to go after the bride why because she's the only one on this planet that has the revelation of the truth that will expose the devil's lie because the devil has got a lie running and the LIE running is all you have to do is receive a historical Jesus and be part of some church group somewhere and you're going to be fine and there's a bride on the earth that can expose that lie amen and they've got to shut that down because the devil wants total control and the truth is the light that breaks the chains and sets the people free and he doesn't want the people to go free he hates the truth he knows the truth will prevail he can't he can't take the truth out of your heart he can't change your revelation but what he can do is bring so much affliction so much trouble trying to bring doubts into your mind about who you are so much trouble so much Affliction because if he can get you to doubt Who You Are if you can if you if you could just if he can get you to to forget your position and forget your calling and election if he can get you so troubled and so tormented and so bothered amen that you cannot see clearly who you are anymore and you begin to have the Eagle Eye filmed over and you begin to withdraw amen and you begin to pull back amen that's the only way that he can control and maintain power in this end time is if he can stop the bride from progressing in the revelation yes sir I say thank God for a prophet [Music] no matter what happens to my flesh no matter what happens all around me God give me Grace to Proclaim your truth to live it to have it on display no matter what it cost me Lord if I lose everything and all my reputation and all my friends and my finances if I lose everything Lord let me hold fast to that truth because the truth is what will have Victory it's the truth that will win the day it's the revelation of the hour that will deliver me from this hybrid condition and take me to the place I've always wanted to go the only thing I have for victory is the revelation of the hour the only thing I have is what he's given me by his spirit and by his grace amen he put a seed in me quickened it by his Spirit he brought the Revelation out and that's the only thing I have to defeat the Devils the revelation of the word when Jesus was faced with the devil all he had as it is written it is written it is written listen Jesus was hungry he had a physical condition he hadn't eaten for 40 days and the devil tried to get him to use the word to change his physical condition make this bread and Jesus didn't take the bait he wasn't there to play the devil's game with the word he wasn't there to prove who he was if you're this then if you say if you're the Son of God then throw yourself down his angels shall bear the young what's the devil using the devil is using the word and he's using the word tried to try to bring doubt on who Jesus Christ is and he's trying to entice the is it the devil is trying to entice Jesus into to proving to taking the word to try to vindicate himself and all Jesus did was take the word and rebuke the devil but then change his condition he tried he tried to get him to change his condition to become a ruler a powerful ruler over the Earth he didn't he did not take debate he didn't change his condition he stayed in his condition and stayed with the word whatever God allows God allows whatever God permits I'll take the word and I'll stand on the word if I'm sick I'm Healed in the name of Jesus Christ I was healed before the foundation world it was paid for at Calvary I believe it with all of my heart but but I'm going to commit it to God I'm going to believe the word and I'm going to keep pressing forward in the revelation of the hour I'm not going to let that Affliction and that thing stop my forward progress I'm not going to let the troubles that come up in our lives in our families and work and all around us I'm not going to let that stop me amen from laboring in the word from loving the Revelation from moving forward from proclaiming it from living it amen does it get us down yes does it get us depressed yes is it a mental depression and affliction absolutely but you got to recognize the devil at his tactics he's trying to get you to pull back and hold up and run into a cave and stay away because every interaction you have is a threat to his kingdom every book that you carry your Satchel amen every tape that you've got every exchange you have with another human being amen is a threat to his kingdom the light that shines from you and your countenance and your appearance the way you dress the way you act the way your family is ordered when you move through places everything about you is a threat to his kingdom at any moment he could lose another one why the light will shine penetrate the darkness bring a seed to life if he can keep the last seed from coming forth then Satan's Eden is secure if he can if he can get one subject to let down on the word his kingdom is secure if you can just get one subject to let down on the word his kingdom is secure if he can get keep the last seed from coming forth his kingdom is secure why do you think he fights you so bad why do you think why do you think men two thousand years ago men that lived their whole life to be perfect before the people Pharisees and Priests men who read the Bible and studied it from the time they were children men who committed their lives to the word that they were reading to to live righteously to live right and keep the laws and not break the laws and not break the Commandments they lived everything what would move those men to lie to bribe to murder to cover it up what would move those men to do those things because they hated the truth and they had to stop that truth men who you wouldn't think would do it men who you wouldn't think would be capable of it but there was another spirit in them that hated the spirit of truth that was in those disciples hated the spirit of truth that was in Jesus Christ and those same Spirits are here that hates the spirit of truth that's in you that's why you find the disciples praise God you find them the disciples life they were never striking back at what was striking them you understand they they didn't war with flesh and blood they didn't war with mankind amen they had a job to do and the job to do a Paul's job was to dust off his britches and go to the next town and see if there was any believers there it wasn't he didn't go and file a formal complaint and rally a bunch of people and have a big protest against the government here his job he knew what his job was and his job was to Shine the Light his job was to proclaim the gospel amen and whatever happened happened God was in control of it all he trusted the Lord amen and he moved and he kept moving forward and his purpose on this planet and I say for you and I and friends we're Afflicted we have troubles we have difficulties we have all kinds of forces of the devil that is trying to gonna they're gonna try to work in your mind to bring a shadow over your mind to bring mental depression and affliction and doubts and questions and complicated scenarios what are you going to do I'm going to keep proclaiming the gospel [Music] I'm going to keep proclaiming the gospel because I know what this is amen this is not I've lost my sonship this is not the that that God has rejected me and I'm not a child of God this is the enemy trying to stop me from doing what I was put on this planet to do and I'm on this planet to shine the lie in my life and my conduct my actions my word where I go to church how I speak to my co-workers the things that I share and the things that I talk about and I'm not going to stop that how many of you have had a a day where you're just so bogged down by trouble mental depression is so weak in your mind or in your body and there's so many things going on at once amen you walk you walk into a golden opportunity to witness an open door and you and yourself don't have the strength to walk through that door I've been there I confess I've been there I've backed away because I I know it's going to be a long conversation I know how this goes I just don't have the energy today and I've went home and wept and told God I was sorry because I let the Affliction of the devil stop me from doing what I'm on this planet to do I let mental troubles and I let troubles all around me and the piling up of difficult situation I let it steal my joy and Rob my testimony and take my confession I thank God there's a holy ghost there that'll bring conviction and say nobody you can't go that way and I'll repent and say God forgive me and give me another chance I'm sorry but do you see the tactic of the devil it's not you that's not you that's the devil what's he trying to do he's trying because he can't stop the spirit of God and he's trying to destroy the vessel that the spirit of Truth is working through say though the vessel is harmed the spirit of truth will come forth so the vessel may be battered The Vessel may be bruised but maybe may I take it like Paul took it Lauren my taketh the way the disciples took it and my Christ took it and brother banham took it may I just take it and keep proclaiming the truth keep climbing higher keep walking with you Lord and keep testifying brother bear says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed so that's it Christ the word he was the word he is the word and the church becomes the word by making her a part of him and that's the word again personally identified by him his property alone his property alone she is Redeemed by him through him for him and for him alone that's right then once the devil is howling about that it's being revealed what's the devil howling about what's all the howling about is that this truth is being revealed what's he howling about in your home and in your life and in your mind he's howling about this truth being revealed when the final trumpet blew it declared spiritual war but this may be just me but what kind of spiritual war what kind of trumpet blast was that it was different than the previous six the previous six was this truth here this this truth of Christ here and the battle over that truth but when this gospel trumpet blew this last trumpet blue it was a gathering up of all the truths that were lost through all the ages in the full revelation of God in Jesus Christ now coming forth what kind of war broke out on that day what kind of War are we in friends what kind of battle is this oh if God one time would just be able to shift our eyesight and we could look into the supernatural realm and see what's going on brother Branham was given that opportunity in JCPenney one time is that true brother Brandon was in JCPenney and he was sitting there in JCPenney and in JCPenney he saw materialized before his eyes something that he had seen when he went to the regions of the lost when he went to hell when he was a boy when he went to hell he saw the women with painted up eyes and that mournful moaning and those water head haircuts and he's sitting in JCPenney waiting for his wife to shop amen and off comes the escalator two women speaking in Spanish the same scene he saw it it troubled him so bad his wife could tell when she came to him so what's wrong with you he said something just happened and brother Branham was able to catch what was going on and tie it back to where he was and he was able to determine that hell has now broke out upon the Earth hell is here hell we know that we know that the abyss has been opened the pit has been opened we know that the border of Euphrates has dried up we know that the the the the that the Angels Bound in the river have been released we know that we've been told that we know the forces of Hell have been released whatever's been bound up whatever's been held back whatever has been caged down until the end times has now been released and now in full force Amen in his upon the Earth gunning for where the truth is that could be awfully discouraging if it wasn't for the fact that I believe Heaven is here too if hell is broke forth upon the Earth then where's heaven where's the forces of heaven where's the armies of heaven where is the battle at the battles here the fight is here the Warfare is taking on here the trumpet blew here the fight broke out here and once this fight this fight is a spiritual war that's broke out between these two forces and it's taking place here if hell is here is heaven here too he said if you're an ambassador from Heaven amen he said if you're an ambassador from Heaven All Of Heaven is backing you up in heaven is consisted of the word he said in Christ The Mystery of God revealed again identified all the devil is howling about this the manifested truth of the promise of the word in her alone what's the devil hate he hates the revelation of the Bride coming of Christ that the word is in her alone who is the word who is the person of the word Jesus Christ and the word is in her alone they don't have the answer when Jesus come why didn't the Pharisees he said if I cast out Devils by the Finger of God who do you cast them out by see he stood alone in his church stands alone she is not hooked with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last day and she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil is howling these great organizations to set up something to close her up they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up she is now risen by the power of the Vindicated word promised to her hey guess what friends she is now risen what's that mean that means I'm in Heavenly places in Christ he's now risen by by the Vindicated word promised to me I'm now part of that Heavenly Force fighting this battle here I've been lifted up brother Benham tells this little story of the little boy who goes to the city for the first time goes to his aunt's house and he goes up there and there's a mirror at the top of the steps and he runs up sees another little boy and that little boy raises his hand or he raises his hand the little boy in the mirror raises his hand and you can't figure out what it is he thinks it's another boy there and he begins to make gestures and move until he catches the revelation that that is a reflection of me that whatever is there is the same thing I am he turns to his mom he said Mama it's me we need to look into the mirror of God's word and we need to realize that's me what Paul went through that's me what Jesus went through with that's me what's what's in that word that's me and we need to get to the place where we say mama that's me this is me this is reflecting my life whatever whatever wrote this word whatever this was coming down through each age that revealed truth that that that manifestation of Christ in every age he was the rock that followed them through the Wilderness amen it was Christ in every age it was Christ he was there whatever that was that same thing that they wrote the Bible behind they wrote the Bible that same thing is in me it's a reflection of me what is it it's the manifested Christ today and I'm a part of it it's me I'm finding my identity in the mirror and I'm not saying well you know I might be I hope to be and someday maybe if I live a good life if I'm a good boy I hope to be accepted in someday but we got to read the word until we can identify the word until you see your reflection in the word and say whatever that is I am whatever it was amen that God nowhere in the boat is the same thing that's got me in the message today whatever it was amen that God and Caleb and Joshua to accept the prophet's word and believe Against All Odds that they could take the land that same thing that was in them is in me the same life The Same Spirit the same form come from the same Source whatever this is I am whatever it was in Paul is in me whatever it wasn't Peter is in me whatever it was in that day is in me now they lived their portion but now I'm living my portion and we look into the word so you can say it's me whatever that is it's me and when you can say that from the bottom of your heart with a full revelation all hell is against that revelation well maybe a couple demons maybe one or two no all hell is against this revelation he goes on in crisis mystery God revealed to say look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing Mama it's me Christ in you listen I'm going to say what the prophet said Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing what God is trying to do what's God trying to do restore back a wife to his son to bring him back to an eating condition what's God been trying to do in the whole Bible he's been trying to restore back he had to restore Adam and after He restored Adam the last Adam he had to restore his wife Amen to do what to unite them back together and to put them back in an eating condition to bring him to the Millennium what's God been trying to do he's been trying to unite the bridegroom and the bride to bring him back to fulfill the purpose that they didn't finish in the beginning so where is that Revelation at now it's right here it's me it's me Mama it's me whatever is written there it's me what was written back in Genesis is me what's written over in Revelation it's me it's me it's me we've come to the time it was a Noah then amen but I was there is that what the prophet tells us I was there when Noah when they are I was there when they crossed through the Red Sea I was there why because the same life that's in me was the same life that was working there it's me Mama this Bible is me the reflection is me and all hell is against this revelation you can you can have other Revelations you can major on serpency and break down surfacing and you can find other Christians that will agree with you you can go on the Oneness of God versus Trinity and you can get others you can go anywhere else amen but the Revelation that all hell is against and everything he's fighting right now is this revelation of the Bride amen Christ coming in the formation of the Bride to do what to finish Amen to finish the restoration of what was lost in Eden to bring it back together in perfect Unity to overcome everything that the devil started back then why does he hate this Revelation it's the period it's the Finish Line it's the end of everything he started back there why is he fighting why does he fight you because your your manifestation is declaring the end of everything he's tried to do you coming forth you proclaiming the gospel you shining the light another seed coming forth and coming to life and manifesting the word is bringing the end to his kingdom in his reign that's why you get sick and you lose your job and you have family troubles and your car breaks down and everything in your life Falls to Pieces why because all hell is against this revelation and when all Hell Comes against you amen and everything comes in a cycle like a tidal wave that you never expected amen you stand fast and say I expected this nice dry devil it comes from the right from the left and straight up in a sneak attack from behind you can't defend against it you can't expect it you don't know that it's coming why because two hundred thousand thousand demons are aiming for the bride all right two hundred thousand thousand demons how many bride do you think on our Earth right now so how many and please don't answer that just keep it in your mind whatever that number is how many demons per believer two million I think is the number something like that how many per believer and you think life's going to be easy you think everything's gonna run smooth you think there'll be no attacks no hiccups no difficulties but he promised us the stabilizers are put on the ship she'll Crest every wave the stabilizers are put on the ship the demons will come the waves will toss they had they had Jesus asleep in the boat and the disciples out on the water and they said we'll get him now so those demons said we'll get him now but the stabilizers were on the ship Christ was in the boat they weren't going to get them now the disciples had even got separated from Christ he was on a mountain they were out in the sea and the same thing I'll get them now amen but he can never get him no matter how much trouble they brought he brought to them no matter how much they thought they were going to die any minute he could not do it until the purpose of God was finished and there's a purpose of God in our lives friends and the purpose of God in our lives it's not all these things we can entangle with but the purpose of God in our lives is to declare the mystery that was in the mind of God from the foundation of the world and that mystery is he will have a bride of his own choosing that'll be in his own likeness what is his own likeness the word she will be a word bride obeying the word following the word standing with the word preaching the word speaking the word proclaiming the word living the word she will be there in the Splendor of him praise God read this last sentence I just read in this quote from Christ the disregard revealed and go to the scripture here Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing I I don't know I can't say that enough Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do what is the new birth then you said well brother Venom what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you I would say it this way the present tense revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen now you join the church you shook a hand you've done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by Coda rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon now let's go to first John and we're going to find out what all the fight is about um first John first John chapter 4. verse 1. beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know you the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God this is what the whole spiritual war today is over that that spirit that cannot confess that Jesus Christ is present tense come in the flesh is not of God and that blows up the whole Kingdom of the devil all his false Notions all his false religions all his false worship it's all blasted apart right there because you know Christ in you is the revelation of the whole thing let's read it again hereby know you the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God in every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world year of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world this scripture this day this scripture is made manifest before your eyes and this is the scripture that Satan does not want out this is the Revelation that he's fighting this is the trumpet that has declared spiritual war in this day and this is the Battleground it exposes the Antichrist spirit says remember we're not on a picnic we're in a Battlefield don't forget that friends I think we get the wrong idea sometimes of being a soldier for Christ because we think sometimes a soldier for Christ means no fatigue no shell shock no wounds no shortages all right I'm a soldier for Christ what that means in our imagination a soldier for Christ means I got I got I got everything perfect and all I do is just stick my gun over the book of pow Devil Falls pow pow everything perfect you know I never get scared never get hurt never have a bad day my sleeping quarters are good my rations are great but Paul tells Timothy to endure hardness as a soldier because this is a battle with all the things that happen in the battlefield shell shock and weariness exhaustion fatigue fear right these things all come the greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world there's nothing going to overcome that Seed Life on the inside that Life of Christ that's the thing that has Victory upon Victory upon victory okay brother Branham said in the true Easter seal the Christian doesn't ask for easy things there's so much promises today made amongst Christian people so many ministers promise that people a false thing if you'll just come to Christ all your troubles is settled I tell you when you come to Christ then they begin that's when you put on a uniform and take a gun and enter the battlefield the Christian road is not a flower bed of ease it's a battle from the very hour you start until your spirit set free by Death you are not at a picnic you're on a Battlegrounds and so we are promised these things amen I think we should start encouraging each other differently than we encourage each other now so now sometimes when somebody says oh brother I'm feeling terrible i've got this or that in my body and we say oh I'm so sorry for you and I think we should start saying hey you're not on a picnic [Laughter] oh brother there's this guy at work and he's just on he's eating them a nurse he's digging at me all the time and creating chaos for me all the time and man we say oh brother I'm so sorry I mean maybe you can get a new job let's change our language and say Hey brother you're not on a picnic this is a Battlefield and you say oh you know my brother all sister sons are having so many things are going wrong the kids just won't listen everything seems to be breaking at the same time my husband doesn't understand he's not giving me the support I need I I I'm falling to pieces sister you look at another one if you're brave enough we'll see how many sisters try this and say Sister We're Not on a picnic but if we could remember that friends the problem is we get the wrong idea of what a Christian Life is we get a wrong idea well with a wrong expectation and a wrong expectation always brings disappointment that's why so many times we can have pep rally Christianity but pep rally Christianity is not the reality and now I'm not against I'm not against an encouraging message and encouragement and pre-reaching the promises because sometimes we need to be reminded that I don't have to take this I can claim the word and the word will overcome if we just if we just stay in that pep rally moment we don't realize that this is a battlefield we're not asking for easy stuff it's supposed to be hard it's supposed to be a battle and if I'm fighting a battle and it comes hard well I just recognize it's supposed to be hard if things get difficult I just recognize it's supposed to be difficult it's not supposed to be easy it's not supposed to be a flowery bed of ease it's not supposed to be comfortable it's not supposed to be nice this is supposed to be spiritual warfare where all of hell has broke out on the earth and what is that going to look like in my life [Applause] with the right expectation amen then all of a sudden we can take disappointment the poison that comes with disappointment and doubt and questionings and say devil this doesn't mean I'm not a child of God this is the perfect example the perfect testimony of the fact that I'm a Child of God the devil will afflict you hard and then make you doubt whether God loves you or not or not that whether you're the economy of God and you should just look at him and say devil if I'm not part of God why do you bother me so bad leave me alone but there's a reason there's a reason he's trying to destroy the thing that's a threat to his kingdom brother Madam says in the greatest battle ever fought this great first battle that was ever fought begin in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on Earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on human beings then the battle from Angels became human battles and Satan came to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for herself he had Satan come to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on Earth and begin in US and has been raging ever since where's the battle at in US why does the battle feel so intense at times because you're the Battleground you're you're the place he's fighting he they facing off two forces are facing off in the mind of man in everything everything is at stake everything all of creation the devil's Kingdom and the kingdom of God it's all here at this end time in this final facing off but God has promised he's promised that there'll be a bride who will not fall she will make that last glorious stand because she'll stand on the word and the word only not on feelings not on circumstances but on the revelation of the word when everything looks wrong she'll still believe everything's all right when everything looks like it's failing she'll still declare that God is winning promise for this hour one last scripture will close Romans 16. Romans 16 verse 20. super familiar I've read it a lot here but I'll probably read it a lot more and the God of Peace shall Bruce Satan under your feet shortly that word bruise we talk about this all the time but it means to shiver a splinter into pieces it's not a small bruise it's a destruction and the God of Peace shall Brew Satan under your feet shortly and you wonder why the devil's after you you wonder why the devil's hounding you and he's coming after you and trying to destroy you it's because in the scripture it's promised that through you he will be destroyed and that's why he's trying so hard to destroy you let's all stand I think when we realize what's going on all around us we should just say this is what a battle looks like this is what spiritual warfare looks like an unexpecting a flowery bed of ease I'm not expecting comfort I'm expecting a battle but this battle has an expected outcome and all I've got to do is stay with the Revelation that God gave me don't turn to the right or to the left don't let the devil take out of your heart what you know to be true keep repeating it keep speaking it keep confessing it keep the word always on your lips keep the truth say I believe this message I am part of this message maybe every once I'll say it's me mama it's me I can't you know I I can't feel good in the flesh right now I can't I can't understand all the pieces but it's me Mama whatever's in that mirror it's me it's me you've chosen me this is the vessel that you want to finish you're working in this day and God I want you to finish in I want you to I I'm depending on you I can't do it in myself but you needed a vessel and this is your vessel you chose me I know you chose me I'm part of your kingdom I'm part of the end time bride God I'm pressing forward this Army's not in retreat doesn't matter how shell-shocked and it doesn't matter how fearful and how overwhelming the forces see this Army is not in Retreat she's a mighty marching Army she's an invincible Army not that she cannot be damaged not that she cannot suffer harm and that's not what makes her Invincible it's not because she's Untouchable she's Invincible because no matter what she will not be defeated in this day nothing shall stop the purpose of God from coming forth in our lives and the purpose of God in this day is to brew Satan under your feet shortly and God is going to do it and he's going to use these vessels to do it and I'm going to stand fast while he does it say God help us help us God I pray that God gives us revelation of this an understanding so that we know what's going on all around us don't don't let the devil lie we know what's happening we know this is spiritual warfare we know this is the result of Hell being Unleashed on the earth and two hundred thousand thousand demons coming after the bride that's what this is not anything else it's not what the devil tells me it is that's what this is the result of hell trying to stop the progress of the Bride so that Satan can hold on to his kingdom a little longer and I want to serve the devil notice we're not quitting will never be defeated will never be stopped not because of Flesh or mind but because of a promise in the word and we know that that word is in her and her alone and there's no other options God has got to take these feet to destroy that devil soon I'm part of it it's me mama it's me do you believe that can you say it's me Mama it's me not my strength not by might but by thy Spirit but it's still me I get discouraged I get knocked down I I get disoriented sometimes I I sometimes run and try to hide in in a foxhole when I'm supposed to be fighting devil and I pray that God will forgive me but it's still me it's still me it's still I'm still the one he's chose I'm still part of the Bride it's still Christ in me that's the revelation of the whole thing it's still me Mama it's still me I'm part of this bride in this end time the manifestation of the word in this final day it's me God help us help us to think right help us to act right help the Revelation the supersede every thought in our mind darkness comes in let the Revelation pierce the darkness and drive it out darkness of Doubt darkness of confusion they're gonna have trouble but let the Revelation Pierce that darkness and say it's me mama I am the manifestation of the word in this day and it's Christ in me that's going to have the victory I will not be defeated I will stand on this word and I will be here until the end because he promised me it's me mama it's me when I look at this it's me when I listen to the message it's me no matter what's happening it's still me and no matter how many mistakes I made it's still me no matter how confusing it gets it's still me no matter how dark it gets it's still me and it's me he's promised to use and it's me he's promised to have Victory through and so I'm going to stand fast and let him do what he's promised he's going to do in me let's pray Lord Jesus God we thank you for the truth Lord your prayer your Prophet didn't preach a fairy tale religion he didn't preach a pink painted room with things that are easy and simple that's not that's not what he brought to us that's not the picture but he showed us that we're in the final showdown the final battle the last trumpet sounded that's been the last Gathering now of the elect there's a war that's going on and that war came from heaven and it came down to earth and now that war is Raging in US We Know The Enemy Lord trying to discourage to disorient to confuse [Music] but God we're claiming your word that we know that that promised word is in the bride and the bride only we believe we're part of that God I pray that you give a fresh Revelation to each of your children this morning I pray you strike something in the heart of your children where the seed is fake that says it's me mama it's me it's not another person it's not another age it's not another dispensation it's not for somebody else to do but it's me it's me you've called lord it's me you've called it's me the prophet was talking about it's me the prophecies were written for it's me God I prayed to let that Revelation strike deep into our hearts Lord and give us the strength to stand and every Firestorm of the enemy and all when the bombs are bursting all around destruction seems to be on every hand give
