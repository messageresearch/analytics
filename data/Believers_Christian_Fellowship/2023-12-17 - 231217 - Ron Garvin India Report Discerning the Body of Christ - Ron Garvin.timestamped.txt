[9:44] that was the last one I watched and I I
[9:46] was in my seat cuz it's funny cuz I've
[9:48] got headphones on I'm sitting there
[9:50] they're next to this guy next to me and
[9:51] every once in a while he amen oh and I'm
[9:53] poting I'm pointing at my phone so I
[9:56] don't know what he thought but I was I
[9:58] was having a a good time so I just love
[10:01] those three Witnesses faith hope and
[10:02] charity amen that that was such a good
[10:05] thought and I enjoyed it so much and I
[10:07] just as I sat there and I watched three
[10:09] services in a row I said I thank God for
[10:11] faithful brothers who can carry the word
[10:14] and feed the sheep and I thank God that
[10:16] everybody can be themselves they can be
[10:19] what God made them to be and nobody's
[10:21] copying one another everybody can be
[10:23] free to be who they are the way they are
[10:26] and I just thank God for that that was
[10:28] wonderful so the Lord's certainly been
[10:30] good to us when it comes to the brothers
[10:32] who are faithful and can carry the word
[10:34] God has been good to
[10:35] us I want to give a very special thanks
[10:39] to brother Ron Garvin amen he was a good
[10:41] friend to have Along on this trip and he
[10:43] was a good traveling companion and we
[10:45] had a great time together and uh I
[10:47] really want to thank sister Becky and
[10:49] the kids for sparing him for a while I
[10:51] know it wasn't easy for them but I thank
[10:53] God that he was able to go and it really
[10:55] it was a great opportunity cuz um I knew
[10:58] brother Ron has a real heart for
[10:59] Missions I know he loves meeting the
[11:01] Brethren he has a heart for the overseas
[11:03] Brethren but to see it in action was
[11:05] really a blessing I saw a brother who
[11:07] really loves to meet brothers and
[11:09] sisters loves to meet them loves to know
[11:11] about them hear their stories their
[11:13] testimonies how they get called to the
[11:15] ministry and as I watched him I really
[11:18] found that brother Ron has a passion and
[11:20] a love for Missions work and it did my
[11:22] heart good to have him there with me and
[11:24] he was really good at carrying on
[11:25] conversations with the brothers getting
[11:27] information background stories and it
[11:30] just it helped me quite a bit and so
[11:33] he's an experienced traveler he did a
[11:35] great job traveling and he did good with
[11:37] the brothers and also he has a gift of
[11:39] exhortation he's really good if somebody
[11:40] ask him to get up and just share a
[11:42] thought the brother can take something
[11:44] in five minutes or 15 minutes and just
[11:46] drop a thought and it makes you think
[11:48] for months and months and months and so
[11:50] he did that a couple of times there they
[11:52] would ask him to get up and greet the
[11:54] people and he would take maybe 10
[11:55] minutes or 15 minutes and share some
[11:57] inspiration from the Lord and and I saw
[11:59] that gift of exhortation really work and
[12:01] really helped me and it was a blessing
[12:03] to the people and then I had him pinch
[12:06] it for me one time because when it come
[12:08] to the Sunday service at brother Ran's I
[12:09] was just wiped out I need a little bit
[12:11] of a break because we were getting into
[12:13] uh a stream of services and he took that
[12:16] Sunday morning service at brother Ran's
[12:18] and it was good I enjoyed it and later
[12:20] brother ran gave him a testimony and
[12:22] told him how perfect it was and how it
[12:25] met a need in their assembly and that
[12:27] that was I know it was a blessing for
[12:28] brother R it blessed me but I know it
[12:30] blessed brother Ron just to know that
[12:32] God can take you and drop you in
[12:33] somewhere and use you and it and it
[12:35] helps you know so he was a great
[12:37] traveling companion and I appreciated
[12:40] having him along and it was good to see
[12:41] him in the missions field that desire
[12:44] and love that he has to see it in action
[12:46] I could really see that God's giv him a
[12:48] burden and a desire and he's specially
[12:50] equipped for that so I I really enjoyed
[12:53] that as well then one last thank you
[12:56] that I really want to thank my family
[12:58] they're very supportive and they they
[13:00] stick it out you know I travel a lot I'm
[13:03] busy and do a lot of things but they're
[13:04] really supportive and really good and I
[13:06] really want to S My Three Sons because
[13:09] while I was gone they U they built a
[13:11] back deck for me you know and um it was
[13:15] a huge blessing for me
[13:21] amen
[13:23] amen sometimes I fail in my duties at
[13:26] home and I can't get to the things I
[13:27] need to get to and that's Project's been
[13:29] left undone for quite some time and it
[13:32] needed to be done and I delayed it and I
[13:34] tried and I got to do it before winter
[13:36] and I finally bought all the material
[13:37] and and they just did it for me and I
[13:40] say thank you I appreciate that amen
[13:43] there's no way that we could do the
[13:45] things God calls us to do without a
[13:48] church family like this there's just no
[13:50] there's no way possible it takes a lot
[13:52] of support people see Ministry and they
[13:55] see travel and they see services and
[13:56] special meetings and Sunday and
[13:58] Wednesday but they don't realize the
[14:00] support that goes into a Ministry the
[14:02] support that goes into missions the
[14:03] support that goes into anything and I
[14:05] thank God for all of you it's not
[14:07] possible without people praying people
[14:09] holding the fort down making things
[14:10] happen and it's impossible without a
[14:13] family who's part of the ministry and so
[14:15] I just say thank you to my family and
[14:17] may God bless them and God bless all of
[14:20] you amen praise God I've asked brother
[14:23] Ron if he would do the trip report this
[14:25] morning and um he's been a huge helper
[14:28] to me Tak pressure off and this is
[14:29] another another one of the pressures
[14:31] that he took off of me and so I went
[14:33] home and went to bed and slept great but
[14:35] the pressure was on him so he's got
[14:37] several pictures in a PowerPoint that
[14:39] brother Franco helped with and that's
[14:41] another thing brother Franco did such a
[14:43] fantastic job we would send the pictures
[14:44] over he assembled the PowerPoint put
[14:46] everything on it so all we had to do not
[14:48] we I say we Loosely brother Ron all that
[14:52] we had to do was rearrange the pictures
[14:54] and delete some and it it saved us hours
[14:57] and hours of time so God bless you
[14:59] brother Franco for that and then I've
[15:01] asked brother Ron if he would just take
[15:02] a take the rest of the time that he has
[15:04] and just share an inspiration share a
[15:06] thought that the Lord's laid on his
[15:07] heart and Minister the word so he's
[15:09] going to do that this morning after the
[15:11] meetings at brother Ran's we were
[15:13] driving up to Emar to catch a flight to
[15:16] go to other meetings in hbad and it's a

[30:44] words or you don't know the music or the
[30:46] melody and then I lost my voice and I
[30:49] still can't sing so if I just kind of
[30:51] growl it out than uh just to say brother

[31:09] before we uh turn to the trip report
[31:12] Heavenly Father we we thank you Lord for
[31:13] this opportunity Lord what you've done
[31:16] what we've seen what we've experienced
[31:18] father we pray that you get all the
[31:20] glory from it and I pray it'll be a a
[31:23] blessing to the people Lord you know my
[31:24] heart that uh we want to uh
[31:27] speak something to be a blessing to him
[31:29] Lord not just a slideshow not just a

[31:35] Lord but uh may it be an encouragement
[31:37] to to see brothers and sisters Lord that

[31:43] your grace Lord and um uh may it be a
[31:46] blessing to the people here we ask these
[31:49] things in Jesus name amen before we are
[31:52] seated brother Chad asked me to
[31:55] uh asked me to share a few thoughts and
[31:59] uh of course I think he intended that I
[32:01] share some pictures then share some
[32:03] thoughts but uh True To Nature we aren't
[32:06] following the
[32:07] rules we are going to share some
[32:09] thoughts as we go and we're just going
[32:11] to trust the Lord to lead as we go so
[32:13] let's read a a text as it were it's
[32:16] going to be hard to thank each one but
[32:19] thank each one of you for praying you
[32:21] know some of us I hate to start naming
[32:24] names and and saying thank you brother
[32:26] thank you sister but each one of you
[32:28] some of you sent texts and uh All of You

[32:38] bless you Brothers um we've said Thank
[32:42] you to your face uh I'll I'm going to
[32:45] try not to single people out but it's
[32:48] going to be hard to do uh because we got
[32:50] to talk about individual people and the
[32:51] work that's going on there and and I
[32:53] don't want to honor one above the other
[32:55] but uh just just uh give me a little
[32:58] Grace okay let's uh turn to 1
[32:59] Corinthians chap
[33:01] 11 and uh if I'd put a title on this
[33:04] beside a trip report let's also call it
[33:06] Discerning the body of
[33:08] Christ wherefore whosoever shall eat
[33:10] this bread verse 27 ver Corinthians 11
[33:14] and drink this cup of the Lord
[33:15] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[33:17] and the blood of the Lord but let a man
[33:19] examine himself and so let him eat of
[33:21] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[33:23] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[33:24] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[33:27] not Discerning the Lord's body and in
[33:29] Matthew
[33:31] 25:40 and the King shall answer and say
[33:33] unto them verily I say unto you in as
[33:35] much as you've done it unto the least to
[33:37] one of the least of these my brethren
[33:40] youve done it unto me God bless you you
[33:42] can be
[33:45] seated we want to discern the Lord's
[33:49] body today and share with you uh many
[33:53] personal stories could be told we could
[33:55] share funny stories story sad stories uh
[33:59] we could just bless you in the spirit
[34:01] and and just have a really enjoyable
[34:03] time your emotions be stirred
[34:05] but that's not kind of story I want to
[34:08] tell today tell I want to tell you a
[34:09] story that'll touch your heart touch
[34:12] your soul leave you with an
[34:14] eternal permanent uh
[34:18] change so that's that's my attempt I
[34:21] can't do that you know I can speak to
[34:23] your ears God's going to have to do it
[34:24] he's going to have to come on the scene
[34:26] he always does he's faithful So speaking
[34:29] about the India missions trip December
[34:32] 4th that was on a Monday to the 16th
[34:34] which was
[34:35] yesterday um brother Franco whoops I
[34:38] said there I went done mention the name
[34:41] happy birthday uh he put this together
[34:46] uh you know I can throw a picture up
[34:47] there it's laborious for me that just
[34:49] not my comfort zone but I sent him the
[34:52] pictures he put it together and then I
[34:54] just had to go weed through 242 slides
[34:57] and brother Chad said yeah 40 or 50 I've
[35:00] got 96
[35:02] brother so but I was encouraged I was
[35:04] listen to brother gab's sermon this
[35:06] morning as I was getting breakfast and
[35:07] getting around and I listened to about
[35:09] half your service brother Gabe and and
[35:11] you said I got 96 slides and I think you
[35:13] got the three I'm not I got 96 we can do
[35:15] this but I think the people want to see
[35:17] more than three slides so I'm kind of
[35:19] stuck with this one brother Gabe but uh
[35:22] I was just amazed at uh what brother
[35:25] Gabe was trying to express in heart
[35:27] there in the portion that I heard and uh
[35:30] brother Emanuel I know you're the same
[35:31] way that uh trying to express what I'm
[35:34] trying to express here
[35:36] today uh so I just pray that you'll each
[35:39] one be blessed by this India and I
[35:41] didn't know this brother frankco put
[35:43] this together that must be their slogan
[35:45] truth alone triumphs I don't find much
[35:48] truth over there except in the Believers
[35:50] uh but it will Triumph so that's for
[35:53] sure capitals New Delhi that's where we
[35:55] flew into population one 1.4 billion
[35:58] people uh second most populated country
[36:00] in the world 80% Hindus 14% Islam 2%
[36:05] Christianity 2%
[36:07] siks uh the USA is three times larger
[36:10] than India in land area land mass but
[36:13] India has more than four times the
[36:15] amount of
[36:17] people and if I've done my math
[36:19] correctly the
[36:21] density uh how's I got this here us
[36:26] didn't uh population density is 93
[36:28] people per square mile and India is 1,67
[36:32] per square mile so you know that's just
[36:34] like a little country
[36:36] town from coast to coast can you imagine
[36:40] that now go with us you'll imagine it so
[36:45] our first we flew into to New Delhi and
[36:49] uh then we flew onto uh brother Ran's uh
[36:52] Village and I can't pronounce these
[36:54] names any better than you so we're just
[36:56] just going to say brother Ran's Village
[36:58] and I think it was an hour flight there
[37:01] with layovers and everything it was 36
[37:03] hours time we left Lima by the time we
[37:06] arrived brother Ran's so uh quite the
[37:10] travel we get to his home got a
[37:12] wonderful house this is the second story
[37:15] um and uh you can see that door there
[37:17] there's two two doors right there
[37:18] brother Chad had one room there there
[37:20] was two or three rooms behind me I had
[37:24] one of those rooms set up real nice for
[37:26] Minister got their home private bathroom
[37:28] and everything and is wonderful this is
[37:30] the original Church brother ran worked
[37:32] out of uh being a poor guesstimate of U
[37:36] crowds and such I would say there was
[37:38] probably you could fit 75 Americans in
[37:41] there maybe I think they were worshiping
[37:44] there with 150 but it was they couldn't
[37:46] squeeze them all in there they was
[37:47] spilled out in the courtyards and all
[37:49] through his house so they needed to do
[37:52] something and I think this was the main
[37:54] purpose we went over there uh was to uh
[37:57] dedication of the of the church brother
[37:59] uh Joe and brother uh Chad went over
[38:01] last October for the groundbreaking U
[38:04] portion or the early construction phase
[38:06] we went over there for the dedication of
[38:08] the
[38:09] church this sign is on it's on the main
[38:11] road going into the town where brother
[38:12] ran lives this sign is right outside
[38:15] their the
[38:16] gate welcomes you the municipal Council
[38:19] of Shem chusai or whatever welcomes you
[38:22] to the land of saints thought that's
[38:24] wonderful praise the Lord this is a
[38:27] computerized rendering of uh of the
[38:29] final product what they want it to look
[38:31] like it's two stories uh and so it's got
[38:35] the pavers uh paver bricks in the
[38:37] courtyard there in the front so that's
[38:39] that's the vision they've got this is
[38:42] what they've got so far they've got the
[38:43] first story up uh they don't have the
[38:45] papers down uh they've still got to put
[38:48] the paint on the inside they've got to
[38:49] put the electric on the inside uh but
[38:53] they're they're worshiping in there and
[38:55] they're um really coming along it's
[38:57] really looking nice now you can see this
[38:59] structure uh those poles and that that
[39:02] platform that was part of the the the PO
[39:05] supported a big tent now this this area
[39:08] in front of the building I'm guessing
[39:11] could probably Park a dozen city buses
[39:14] in there and even right these poles are
[39:17] high enough they probably could pull
[39:18] right underneath of it so it's a it's a
[39:20] rather large area well they put all
[39:23] these poles up and they put a big tent
[39:25] across it and then they put like an
[39:27] AstroTurf down on the ground and then
[39:28] everybody just sits on the ground and
[39:31] then they had the platform there for the
[39:32] for the minister so that's the way they
[39:34] do it over there he's got enough land
[39:36] that he can have big meetings this is
[39:38] the back of the church and the same way
[39:41] in the back all this space you could
[39:42] probably put I don't know maybe a dozen
[39:44] city buses in there as well and uh this
[39:47] is the they had that was all covered
[39:49] with a tent and that's where they fed
[39:51] the people and so their their vision is
[39:55] to have a special meetings have youth
[39:59] meetings and it'll be a hub for India
[40:04] that people can can gather there it's
[40:06] you know not everybody has got the
[40:08] facilities like this it's out in the
[40:09] country uh a far enough away that they
[40:12] can they've got this kind of a land so
[40:14] um so it's really a a great thing and
[40:17] I'm glad that we've been able to be a
[40:18] part of it we this is not our church
[40:20] we've not sponsored all this we've been
[40:22] a part of it so other churches involved
[40:24] as well and uh the brothers and sisters
[40:27] the church over there the local church
[40:29] just um makes me tired thinking of all
[40:31] the work they're
[40:33] doing now I'm standing on these pavers
[40:36] right here looking at the back of the
[40:37] church then I turn around and take a
[40:39] picture that same area they've got uh
[40:42] restrooms they've got office they've got
[40:44] a kitchen on the far right is a uh roof
[40:48] over an eating area and this is where
[40:49] they've been having church until they
[40:51] got the main building
[40:54] done uh the brothers took advantage of
[40:56] that during the during the daytime and
[40:58] sat out there and fellowship uh just a
[41:01] really relaxing atmosphere away from the
[41:03] hubhub of the city and off to the left
[41:05] of that um area that building there they
[41:09] realize if we're going to have uh big
[41:11] meetings and conventions and stuff the
[41:14] two bathrooms we've got which are
[41:15] multi-use you know multiple people can
[41:17] use it at the same time but it's not
[41:19] going to be a sufficient when you've got
[41:21] hundreds of people there so they built
[41:23] over to the uh to the left of that
[41:25] building they've got uh restrooms plus I
[41:29] think they've got a couple shower stalls
[41:31] in there so so they're set up to be able
[41:35] to
[41:37] uh to handle the uh the
[41:43] crowds there's a kitchen in there this
[41:46] this is the local churches sisters are
[41:48] in there cooking this was for the Sunday
[41:50] Meal which the dedication was on a
[41:52] Thursday and so uh we'll get some
[41:55] pictures of that later but on the Sunday
[41:56] there was a small crowd so the sisters
[41:59] are in there cooking um and well all of
[42:02] them kids and brothers are all pitching
[42:04] in there helping out and uh and working
[42:07] that sister in the front there in the
[42:09] Middle with the purple shawl on that's
[42:11] brother Ran's mother I believe so um
[42:14] Point her out so just you know how it is
[42:18] a lot of you been involved with the
[42:20] family camp in the past and different
[42:22] special meetings you know how much work
[42:23] it can be they've got a bit baptismal
[42:25] there
[42:26] uh that's is this is the baptismal area
[42:29] um off to the back right corner of
[42:31] course it's cluttered with everything
[42:33] because of the meetings that they had so
[42:36] it was just a very very busy time and
[42:38] they was just constantly working it was
[42:41] a just real blessing to see them all
[42:43] pitching in and doing together it was a
[42:45] real real blessing this is standing out
[42:48] on the road uh which is a dangerous
[42:51] place to stand in India so maybe I
[42:52] surely was standing off the road but
[42:54] they honk before they hit you so you
[42:56] don't have to worry about it but they've
[42:57] got a wall there and you can see the
[43:00] church behind there but they've got this
[43:02] wall because the cattle just roam freely
[43:05] and U you just can't have cattle all up
[43:08] on your front doors of your church so
[43:10] they've got that this little building to
[43:11] the left is kind of a Outreach office
[43:13] and they're planning to have somebody
[43:15] they stay there all the time to offer
[43:17] free literature I don't know they
[43:19] probably offer coffee or whatever they
[43:21] can for travelers going by counseling
[43:23] prayer whatever just um the just
[43:26] Outreach minded and so that's their uh
[43:30] vision for for that little building and
[43:32] beside that building is a gate they'll
[43:33] get a a proper gate installed at some
[43:36] point that's more of the work still
[43:37] going on um on the opposite end of that
[43:41] wall is another entrance and then that
[43:44] wall there with a uh cutout of the Cross
[43:47] and it's got an inlay of LED lights so
[43:49] that lights up at night time it's just
[43:52] uh just a beautiful work they've got
[43:53] going on there now behind the wall on
[43:55] this one one we're still at the same
[43:57] vantage point but it was a this was on
[43:59] Thursday I think when the big meetings
[44:01] were going on you can see the orange and
[44:02] the white banners behind that that is
[44:05] the
[44:06] tent my voice is still rough so forgive
[44:09] me if I have
[44:12] to cough and be a problem be thankful
[44:14] you weren't one of the guys sitting
[44:16] beside me on the plane they were a
[44:18] little a scans but there was nowhere for
[44:20] him to go so I prayed for him
[44:23] so but uh they had two the portable
[44:26] generators to to run all the equipment
[44:29] there at the church but I wanted to show
[44:31] you that and then also they've got some
[44:32] flowers and and Landscaping there that
[44:35] they're doing uh they brother ran I well
[44:38] brother AIT as well another brother
[44:40] there they just got a real love for
[44:42] gardening and and doing all this and so
[44:45] it's going to be beautiful when it's all
[44:46] done so if the Lord carries so there's
[44:49] little lights you can see those flowers
[44:51] sitting in the wall there's little
[44:52] lights shine down in those at night time
[44:54] it's it's just uh well thought out well
[44:56] planned uh project um I kind of like
[45:00] woodworking so I threw a few of these in
[45:02] here and I don't know other Woodworkers
[45:04] we've got these are te Teakwood Doors
[45:07] Big Brass handles heavy doors they got
[45:09] five hinges on those they're not
[45:11] finished yet you can see the size of
[45:12] them I suppose they're about 8ot tall
[45:14] this is Brother AET here just to kind of
[45:17] give you a size comparison the brass
[45:19] hardware the details of the wood and I
[45:22] liked it so I threw it in there I guess
[45:23] I could have cut those out brother Chad
[45:25] I'm sorry about that
[45:26] they'll be fired so
[45:29] interior they they do have like a
[45:31] chandelier up uh of course they'll the
[45:34] balloons probably won't be there for
[45:35] every service this is just a special
[45:37] occasion but I wanted to try to capture
[45:40] the ceiling how they've got I think they
[45:41] call Tray ceilings that's recessed up in
[45:43] there and just uh it's just well thought
[45:47] out they don't have the paint in here
[45:48] yet so um but it's a work in progress
[45:52] and and they're doing a good job I think
[45:54] that door on the left is the cry room
[45:55] the one in the far back by the window is
[45:57] the uh Sunday school if I'm not mistaken
[46:00] in the Sunday School room they've got
[46:03] you know this fancy U ceiling they've
[46:05] got you can see the wires hanging down
[46:07] there in the Middle where there'll be a
[46:09] light they've got you know collared
[46:11] tiles on the floor and they've got paint
[46:13] in that room so they're starting on the
[46:15] work and uh it's it's kept them busy and
[46:19] we're looking forward to them getting
[46:21] this project done because one of the
[46:23] brothers that is just one of the main
[46:24] driving forces
[46:26] is also an evangelist that we want to
[46:28] support to go he's just got in his heart
[46:30] to go and I'd rather have him go spread
[46:33] the gospel then build a church but yet
[46:35] we need a church too so we're just
[46:36] caught here I think this was Wednesday
[46:39] night when we came up uh we stopped
[46:41] there we we arrived Wednesday night and
[46:43] so it was late when we got the brother
[46:45] Ran's and we swung by the the church to
[46:47] see it it's all lit up with lights and
[46:49] and the brothers are working and it's
[46:51] late at night uh to me this is a
[46:53] trustees nightmare you know this is
[46:55] Wednesday special meetings are Thursday
[46:58] and they're leveling dirt in the front
[46:59] of the front door you can see a roll of
[47:01] AstroTurf there uh but they're doing it
[47:04] with a smile it was just it was just a
[47:06] real blessing to see him doing this this
[47:08] is the architect he is a converted Hindu
[47:12] I think they call him brother
[47:14] Jonathan and uh it was really
[47:17] interesting talking to him just seeing
[47:19] the vision that he had and how he's uh
[47:21] surrendered his life I don't all these
[47:23] brothers have a testimony and I'd love
[47:25] to hear each and every one of them he
[47:27] come from Hinduism and he left a job in
[47:30] the city moved out to this more rural
[47:33] City to focus on this project to build
[47:36] that's how grateful he is to see the
[47:39] light to come out of the Hinduism and
[47:41] God's blessed him so uh praise the Lord
[47:44] and he so he's one of them that's just
[47:45] laboring on this uh but uh God bless him
[47:49] and he has already and I know he will
[47:51] continue to do
[47:54] that
[47:56] I did not put any video in here I've got
[47:58] video but I didn't get that part put in
[48:00] but you can see the front doors of the
[48:01] church building you can see the ribbon
[48:03] there and the brothers gathered there to
[48:06] go up brother Chad went up cut the
[48:09] ribbon and then all the brothers entered
[48:10] in uh probably all the visiting
[48:12] ministers entered in and they said a few
[48:14] words from the pulpit had some prayer
[48:16] and uh and then they went back outside
[48:20] under the tent and had the service out
[48:23] there for the dedication Service uh
[48:26] their theme for the service was the
[48:28] sound of rejoicing so they were
[48:30] rejoicing it was a very special time you
[48:33] can see the big screens on on the left
[48:35] side and on the
[48:36] right brother Chad and brother ran you
[48:38] can see them in there they're
[48:40] down on waiting to be invited up after
[48:43] the singing so they've got a drone
[48:46] flying videoing this plus they got video
[48:49] cameras set up and this is on YouTube
[48:52] you should be able to to catch it I
[48:53] don't know where you'd go but Frank was
[48:55] probably got the link for you but you
[48:57] know so they've got these two big
[48:58] screens there and uh there may have been
[49:01] screens around back in case there were
[49:03] people around behind the church as
[49:06] well but you can see the masses the
[49:08] sisters sit on the one side Brothers sit
[49:10] on the other and that's the culture the
[49:12] way they do it over there Sunday school
[49:13] came up sang a special I think they sang
[49:15] it in English uh so it was just a a
[49:19] special time you know we can stop and
[49:20] talk about every single one of these
[49:22] pictures for uh my brother Chad's going
[49:24] to Lim me about two seconds a piece so
[49:26] we can get out of here on time today but
[49:29] uh I got my glasses on brother Chad I
[49:31] can't quite see you out there these are
[49:33] reading glasses that that helps
[49:35] me this man in the red turban is a
[49:38] seek and the seeks are a branch off of
[49:42] the
[49:42] Hindus um we won't go into detail on
[49:46] their religion um but a devout seek one
[49:49] of the things he carries is a knife I
[49:51] forget what they call it in their he in
[49:53] their native tongue it's called the
[49:54] gentleman
[49:56] is uh what it is uh the translation of
[49:58] it is and if you talk bad about his
[50:00] religion he's obligated to kill you good
[50:02] people to be friends with so but they
[50:06] are they're A Min minority but yet they
[50:08] stick up for the minorities and they're
[50:11] predominant in the Punjab region and so
[50:13] the government doesn't mess with them
[50:14] and so the I my impression is the
[50:17] Christians have a little more freedom
[50:19] there um
[50:21] so brother rashan invited everybody had
[50:24] Billboards he had all kinds of
[50:26] advertisement everywhere his friends
[50:27] come and it uh and they sat right in the
[50:31] meetings and participated in the
[50:33] meetings so it was uh just a pleasure to
[50:36] see um we should have that kind of
[50:38] testimony you know I feel like what
[50:40] brother Emanuel has spoken in the past
[50:43] and brother Gabe was speaking about you
[50:45] know
[50:47] um that's the impression I get maybe
[50:49] that's not what you was speaking about
[50:50] but you know where's our heart are we
[50:53] Discerning the Lord's body that could be
[50:54] a member of the the body of Christ right
[50:56] there that's right we don't know we're
[50:58] going
[50:59] to throw him out with the dogs until he
[51:03] comes to the Lord uh so they they're
[51:06] making a testimony there so here again
[51:08] the the theme of the service there and
[51:11] brother ran up there translating from
[51:13] Brother Chad uh it was a real blessing
[51:16] uh the people were blessed it was just
[51:17] wonderful meetings we could go on and
[51:18] talk about it and well you just need to
[51:20] go hear it so afterwards they served all
[51:24] the people food they went behind the
[51:25] church that's also under a tent you can
[51:27] see them sitting on the AstroTurf uh
[51:30] type material and they just go down
[51:32] through there with a bucket and they
[51:33] just scoop it out and feed it right
[51:35] there another guy comes with a big
[51:36] Kettle probably a two gallon kettle of
[51:38] tea and he's just pouring tea as he goes
[51:40] along and and and feeding them and
[51:42] taking care of them and uh it was just
[51:44] quite an operation for the smaller
[51:46] meetings and stuff the the church always
[51:49] pitches in does their own
[51:50] cooking but since this was such a large
[51:54] uh meeting we asked brother ran you know
[51:57] how many people are you expecting he
[51:58] said well we're making preparations to
[52:00] feed 3,000 people I don't know if there
[52:03] were that many there but I think they
[52:05] hired these people to do the cooking
[52:08] just these huge kettles I don't know 50
[52:10] gallons or something like that some of
[52:13] them over Woodfire some over LP tank
[52:15] burner cooking that Curry and and
[52:18] brother Chad loved it so so where's
[52:22] brother Joe brother Joe here he's in the
[52:25] back where you at brother J got take my
[52:27] you're supposed to be in the front
[52:28] brother you didn't want to get too close
[52:30] to me did
[52:32] you so yeah I uh I like riding my food
[52:36] so Chad kind of stayed the one you know
[52:39] he kind of stuck with the Indian Cuisine
[52:41] I I had fried potatoes bow
[52:44] potatoes mashed potatoes I had french
[52:47] fries I I tried it all
[52:50] so but I wish I had a a video of this
[52:53] for you but but I don't and we can't go
[52:56] too long but uh these ladies making
[52:59] chipot chapattis which is like a big
[53:01] tortilla and you see the size of that
[53:03] thing it's probably this biger round
[53:05] then they throw it on this big uh big
[53:07] disc over a wood fire and and cook it
[53:10] and they just that was just a production
[53:12] line for that many people that just kept
[53:13] on
[53:15] going are we Discerning the Lord's body
[53:18] I I love the little children love to get
[53:19] the pictures of them uh got a heart for
[53:23] them so got to throw a few pictures
[53:25] those in there this man I didn't get to
[53:28] meet him I'd love to hear his story
[53:29] we've all got a testimony he was a a
[53:31] seek and he's a he's a gospel Minister
[53:34] now he's a message Minister now his
[53:36] little boy there I don't know if he's
[53:38] converted so but he looks like he might
[53:41] still need some conversion there
[53:45] so uh on on this picture you see uh
[53:48] Jonathan the uh the architect on the
[53:50] left uh Brother P is the Evangelist he's
[53:53] he's a really a driving force on on the
[53:55] project and uh a good brother really
[53:58] really enjoyed the fellowship with him
[54:00] the work he's doing up in rajastan uh
[54:02] love to include that in this uh report
[54:05] but not today we won't have time for
[54:07] that so we'll catch it later um he
[54:09] reminds me so much of Brother Don Don in
[54:11] the Philippines that we know we're
[54:12] familiar with always got a smile on his
[54:14] face soft spoken and
[54:17] just driven to spread the gospel and uh
[54:21] I appreciate that about Brother P that's
[54:24] the kind of man I want to
[54:26] I don't want there to be any excuse for
[54:29] him to say well I couldn't go I just
[54:30] didn't I just couldn't I couldn't go I
[54:32] could didn't have the funds to go I
[54:34] didn't have the ability I didn't
[54:35] have let let let's send somebody that
[54:39] can go so I would love to go with him I
[54:43] probably would not survive so but uh so
[54:46] I'll I'll be appreciative of the
[54:48] pictures we get so that's brother ggen
[54:50] there beside him he's a song leader he's
[54:52] also an evangelist um I threw this
[54:54] picture picture in here I don't know
[54:55] this brother's name but I'm sure he's
[54:57] got a story he was a crippled brother
[54:59] the brothers carried him in set him in
[55:00] the chair and they were having
[55:01] fellowship and then I noticed is as the
[55:03] brothers begin to Fellowship they they
[55:05] got up and began to begin to wander
[55:07] around greeting each other there he was
[55:09] setting facing the way they' placed him
[55:12] looking at a blank wall everybody's
[55:14] fellowshipping behind him I want to
[55:16] include them you know I don't know what
[55:18] kind of troubles that brother's going
[55:19] through appreciate the uh special sister
[55:22] Priscilla I've sang that song too
[55:25] uh I think most of us if we're a singer
[55:28] could sing that song or at least humm it
[55:32] we've all been through some trials who
[55:33] what just want to enter into their
[55:38] suffering this is uh Titus on the left
[55:41] it's brother Ran's youngest son I think
[55:43] he's 18 years old and brother AIT
[55:47] they're a special team love to see them
[55:49] guys working together brother must be
[55:52] around 60 years old and he calls Titus
[55:54] his supervisor
[55:55] and they get the work done so and just
[55:59] it's hard not to include all these
[56:01] special people in there so there's more
[56:03] advertisement on the back of this little
[56:05] taxi cabin uh it's got the advertisement
[56:08] there a sound of rejoicing for the
[56:10] special
[56:12] meetings
[56:14] um that was all the the dedication
[56:17] service was on Thursday we arrived on
[56:19] Wednesday dedication was on Thursday
[56:21] noonish I guess and then Friday we had
[56:24] men's breakfast and just relaxed for the
[56:27] day and U and that was very nice on
[56:32] Saturday we went to this brother in the
[56:34] center that's brother Aaron George
[56:36] brother Joe and brother uh um Chad went
[56:39] there last year so we was able to go
[56:41] back again this year I shared a little
[56:43] bit of a short exhortation 10 minutes
[56:46] maybe something like that and then
[56:48] brother uh brother Chad
[56:50] preached nice nice Church nice
[56:53] congregation and the people people
[56:55] appreciating it responding to it uh I
[56:58] just got that that sister there with her
[57:00] hand up in the air she was just she was
[57:02] just right there with brother Chad the
[57:03] whole whole time just really really
[57:05] entering into as I snap the picture uh
[57:07] there's just no way you can share
[57:09] everything but I tried brother Chad now
[57:12] it reverse roles on Sunday brother Chad
[57:15] needed a break so he gave an exhortation
[57:17] or a greeting or something I was back
[57:19] studying preparing and then uh after he
[57:22] he gave a short introduction there I
[57:24] came to the pulpit and shared a thought
[57:26] with the brothers there it was just the
[57:28] local church um and so that was on
[57:32] Sunday on Monday we left brother
[57:36] rashan's up in the Punjab which is close
[57:37] to Pakistan and we traveled
[57:41] south to brother uh Samuel kotes in
[57:45] Hyderabad this is the brother that
[57:46] brother Chad met in
[57:49] Canada so we traveled down there on
[57:53] Wednesday uh I think I've got the
[57:55] details there we left brother Ran's at
[57:57] 5:30 in the morning got to our hotel at
[57:59] 6:00 p.m.
[58:02] so 12 and 1 half hours travel time got
[58:05] picked up at 7:00 to go to the service
[58:08] so just once we got to this point I kind
[58:12] of lost contact with the world also lost
[58:14] my voice so I'm kind of like a what they
[58:17] call it a one hit wonder you know preach
[58:19] one time lose my voice and leave the
[58:21] rest to brother brother
[58:22] Chad but uh
[58:25] hydrabad uh metropolitan area of 250 250
[58:29] square miles Allen County Ohio is about
[58:32] 400 and some square miles 47 square
[58:35] miles uh so it's about you know a little
[58:38] over half the size of Allen County with
[58:44] 11 Ohio has a population of 11.78
[58:48] million hydrabad half the size of Allen
[58:51] County has 10.58 million people so we're
[58:55] not in the rural areas
[58:57] anymore uh got a nice Church established
[59:00] would love to tell their testimony how
[59:01] their father labored in the in the word
[59:03] and established churches brother uh
[59:05] brother Samuel's father for years and
[59:07] and they started this uh built this big
[59:10] church and it was a I think it was a
[59:12] orphanage wasn't it brother Chad and so
[59:14] they were doing a work amongst the poor
[59:16] amongst the orphans and um and they've
[59:19] got an established work there so um it
[59:22] was a pleasure to fellowship with them I
[59:24] was losing my voice but I was able to uh
[59:27] stand up I couldn't sing so I just
[59:30] recited or just read the lyrics to a
[59:32] song it was a blessing to me kind of
[59:34] shared that as a testimony and then uh
[59:36] brother Chad preached there this is
[59:38] Brother Samuel on the left his brother
[59:40] Boaz who was also a pastor in another
[59:43] location um so um this is Brother
[59:47] Samuel's
[59:49] church not real large but a nice size
[59:53] there uh enjoyed I wish wish had the
[59:55] video of the translator he was just
[59:57] right there with brother Chad and it was
[59:58] just fun to watch this young man just
[1:00:00] right there entering in
[1:00:03] uh with the ministry of the word so just
[1:00:06] a view of the congregation after the
[1:00:09] service we had had our supper there in
[1:00:11] the in the church and then we got back
[1:00:13] to the hotel I probably after midnight
[1:00:16] that's just kind of the way things Ran
[1:00:18] So that was uh Wednesday yeah Thursday
[1:00:21] was dedication Friday was breakfast
[1:00:22] Saturday was but Aaron
[1:00:26] GES Sunday was the uh church service
[1:00:29] brother Ran's Monday was here Tuesday we
[1:00:32] went to this church brother uh Samuel
[1:00:35] bacas which brother Chad said he met
[1:00:37] last year as well this was Tuesday
[1:00:40] night so that's Pastor Samuel buaka he
[1:00:44] also did the Translating for brother
[1:00:45] Chad and uh another little least of my
[1:00:49] little ones there
[1:00:52] so the couple on on the right hand side
[1:00:55] visited us here in this church they've
[1:00:58] got a daughter over here somewhere so
[1:00:59] some of you may have met them they're
[1:01:02] from across the continent I didn't get
[1:01:04] things together forgive me for that I we
[1:01:07] got in late and I fell asleep on the
[1:01:09] floor and got up in the middle of the
[1:01:10] night worked on a little bit fell asleep
[1:01:12] again and got up again and so but I'd
[1:01:14] love to have a picture of uh India and
[1:01:17] shown you where everybody came from uh
[1:01:20] they traveled to special meetings with
[1:01:22] brother Marlo py and and these people
[1:01:24] people traveled a distance as well lots
[1:01:26] and lots of flowers everywhere we went
[1:01:28] lots and lots of
[1:01:31] flowers from Brother uh Samuels in
[1:01:34] Hyderabad we uh traveled
[1:01:37] to I can't pronounce the r the name they
[1:01:39] shortened the natives shorten it to
[1:01:42] weag uh so we'll call it
[1:01:45] weag because you don't know how to
[1:01:47] pronounce that either so brother Marlo
[1:01:49] PES we we flew an 1 hour flight and then
[1:01:52] he took us on a two and a half three
[1:01:55] hour drive to the location where the uh
[1:01:57] meetings were going to be it probably
[1:01:59] would have been a quicker drive but it's
[1:02:00] a four-lane highway divided by a
[1:02:03] concrete median and then they've got um
[1:02:06] big dirt burms so you can usually fit
[1:02:08] you like four lanes of traffic in that
[1:02:11] so uh well they decided to have a
[1:02:13] political rally and they closed down one
[1:02:16] side thank the Lord it was the other
[1:02:19] side but it just stopped everything I
[1:02:22] don't know if that guy really got a lot
[1:02:23] of votes or not
[1:02:25] I don't think I'd be voting for him cuz
[1:02:27] the side that was closed was the one
[1:02:28] that went towards the airport so I
[1:02:31] wonder how many people missed a missed a
[1:02:34] uh a uh plane ride on that day but so
[1:02:38] was some distance from Brother uh uh
[1:02:40] jber ratum marble putties and they
[1:02:42] rented a convention hall beautiful place
[1:02:45] one that they often use and
[1:02:48] uh here they've got the seats set up so
[1:02:52] because it's it's all set up for this
[1:02:55] and you can get an idea of the size of
[1:02:57] it just a really really nice place
[1:03:00] brother maruti's Sons that's
[1:03:03] uh
[1:03:05] Emerald Livingston Emerald Livingston
[1:03:08] and on the guitar there is uh Moses
[1:03:10] Livingston and then on the drums is uh
[1:03:12] David Livingston and then their cousin
[1:03:15] is on the other guitar he's got five
[1:03:17] Sons or middle names all of them is
[1:03:19] Livingston and uh wonderful brothers
[1:03:22] really a big help to uh brother Mar py
[1:03:25] really a pleasure to have them and I'd
[1:03:27] love for you to hear they're playing it
[1:03:29] wasn't the standard um music of uh India
[1:03:35] and it was just real worshipful and just
[1:03:37] really enjoyed
[1:03:39] it so hope I'm not running out of time
[1:03:41] here so brother Chad preaching brother
[1:03:44] Mara py was right into it he preached
[1:03:46] himself right out of his jacket and I
[1:03:47] he's always so prim and proper but he
[1:03:49] just took his jacket off threw it on the
[1:03:50] floor and kept on going so it was really
[1:03:53] uh really fun to to watch the people
[1:03:56] brother Mary and the people entering
[1:03:58] into the word after the service that was
[1:04:02] uh Wednesday night we just seen this is
[1:04:04] Thursday morning we had another service
[1:04:06] after the Thursday morning meeting they
[1:04:08] never called an alar call but the people
[1:04:10] just came forward and uh and the
[1:04:12] ministers were up there praying with
[1:04:13] them and uh the people were responding
[1:04:15] to the word and so we just uh rejoice in
[1:04:17] that we can't you know lift up and oh
[1:04:19] brother Chad preached A good sermon the
[1:04:21] people responded to the word and it was
[1:04:24] just
[1:04:25] uh very very special time and I like
[1:04:28] this picture here it looks like I'm a
[1:04:30] dynamic preacher so I'm going to save
[1:04:32] that one so on Thursday evening uh I
[1:04:36] gave a maybe 15minute exhortation and
[1:04:39] then brother Chad closed the service
[1:04:41] there and that was our last service that
[1:04:42] was on the Thursday
[1:04:45] night so
[1:04:47] on Wednesday night we got home we got
[1:04:50] back to the hotel at like 2:00 a.m.
[1:04:52] Thursday night we got back to the the

[1:06:52] said we don't have time to shake
[1:06:53] everybody's hand just line up and wave
[1:06:56] so they did and we felt like celebrities
[1:06:59] as we left you know had to roll the
[1:07:00] window down say goodbye to everybody and
[1:07:02] they're about this far away so I just
[1:07:04] reached my hand out and we just kind of
[1:07:06] given a hand slap as we went by but by
[1:07:08] the time we got to the end it was a mad
[1:07:09] rush and had to get your hand back in

[1:08:02] home how much time I got brother Chad I
[1:08:04] got 15
[1:08:05] minutes that's a joke between us so I
[1:08:08] got five minutes which means half
[1:08:18] hour I want
[1:08:21] to just ask the Lord to the share
[1:08:24] thought let's stand again give you just
[1:08:27] a little bit of a
[1:08:30] break read our opening scriptures
[1:08:34] again 1 Corinthians 11 just a portion of
[1:08:38] verse 29 not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:08:41] in Matthew 25 in as much as you've done
[1:08:43] un one of the least of these my brethren
[1:08:45] you've done it unto
[1:08:47] me brother Bram says in one of the I
[1:08:50] think I've got the quote coming up the
[1:08:52] greatest thrill I have is living for
[1:08:53] Brothers amen may God bless the thought
[1:08:57] this afternoon you can be
[1:09:01] seated just got some quotes that uh
[1:09:03] struck me and uh just wanted to share
[1:09:06] them with you and this is where I felt
[1:09:08] like it was just right in line with what
[1:09:11] brother emanuel's spoken many times and
[1:09:13] his heart and brother Gabe's heart so uh
[1:09:17] if I cover back I haven't heard your
[1:09:19] service brother a Gabe so if I cover
[1:09:21] some of these same thoughts that you
[1:09:22] were on and uh I put this together last
[1:09:25] night and I listen to your started
[1:09:26] listening to your sermon this morning
[1:09:28] brother Brad says in Revelations chapter
[1:09:30] 4 part three says if something operating
[1:09:33] has to be called out or said something
[1:09:35] about it called down or something on
[1:09:37] that order and the person that's got
[1:09:38] that gift rejects it just remember
[1:09:40] refuses it remember the gift wasn't
[1:09:42] right it wasn't God in the first place
[1:09:45] the spirit of God always is ready for
[1:09:47] correction sweet humble willing see if
[1:09:50] it if it stands up and says I'll do it
[1:09:52] anyhow you know how sometimes just
[1:09:54] remember arrogant Spirits are not of God
[1:09:58] and man when you go overseas can you
[1:10:00] ever tell when you're in the presence of
[1:10:02] an American all that travel and all that
[1:10:05] hustle and bustle and the honking of the
[1:10:07] horns and I didn't see anybody get upset
[1:10:11] but then on the ride back to America I
[1:10:13] sat between two
[1:10:15] Americans and you know they're offended
[1:10:18] for you to get up and use the restroom
[1:10:19] or if you cough and it's like the one
[1:10:21] guy said I hope I don't catch that
[1:10:24] said well I'll pray for you he said well
[1:10:27] it's not not not a bad thing to have the
[1:10:28] intervention of the almighty or
[1:10:30] something like that so well I guess
[1:10:32] we're back in America so told Brother
[1:10:35] Chad it' be good to get back into
[1:10:38] uh familiar chaos over in India it's
[1:10:41] chaos but it's unfamiliar chaos well
[1:10:43] we're back into it's just all chaos so I
[1:10:45] don't know whether it's a good thing or
[1:10:46] not but and arrogant Spirits are not of
[1:10:49] God and that's the American Spirit but
[1:10:51] we are not of this we are not the have
[1:10:53] that American Spirit so what a
[1:10:56] difference you see when you go overseas
[1:10:58] and when you just even here when you
[1:11:00] fellowship with the brothers and sisters
[1:11:02] uh arrogant Spirits are not a God if
[1:11:04] you've got an arrogant spirit it's not a
[1:11:06] God just put it plain and simple you
[1:11:09] know they've got the Amplified Bible I
[1:11:10] guess if I wrote One it' be the
[1:11:11] condensed Bible let's just get it out
[1:11:13] quick and be done with it so I take
[1:11:16] subst a substitute when everything the
[1:11:17] whole Earth is filled with the glory of
[1:11:19] God you see real power of God why will
[1:11:22] we take a substitute we're too late in
[1:11:23] the day
[1:11:25] now and I think most of these quotes
[1:11:27] continue on that same sermon says you
[1:11:30] have to have spiritual understanding
[1:11:31] remember God never did and never will on
[1:11:33] this Earth dwell in glamour he's against
[1:11:35] it he'll never the great messages will
[1:11:37] never be make great big so and so and so
[1:11:40] and so it don't do that way his servants
[1:11:42] don't work in that manner his Glamour
[1:11:44] and glory is above and
[1:11:47] uh it's uh you see a man trying to make
[1:11:50] something of himself uh that goes
[1:11:54] against the spirit that's in me
[1:11:57] um I don't want to get long-winded but
[1:12:00] uh but it's a burden on my heart elas
[1:12:03] are the model
[1:12:04] servant I don't and I I need to
[1:12:07] familiarize myself with the story there
[1:12:08] but I don't think it
[1:12:10] records what went on by the time he left
[1:12:14] with Rebecca and arrived to Isaac it
[1:12:17] doesn't record what happened there but
[1:12:19] something happened
[1:12:21] there Rebecca was in love with Isaac
[1:12:23] when she seen
[1:12:25] him can that be say said the same of you
[1:12:27] and I when we get to the end of our
[1:12:30] journey those people that we're
[1:12:32] witnessing to who are they in love with
[1:12:34] you or or their Isaac Jesus Christ um
[1:12:40] and I think it's a
[1:12:41] shame uh when the people are drawn to
[1:12:43] the servant as not a model
[1:12:45] servant
[1:12:48] but you have to have spiritual
[1:12:50] understanding remember God never did and
[1:12:51] never will on this Earth dwell in
[1:12:52] glamour
[1:12:54] this make some great big so and so God
[1:12:56] doesn't work in that humility we don't
[1:13:00] go around brag about those things you
[1:13:01] know there's there's a lot of wonderful
[1:13:02] things went on in the the services over
[1:13:05] there and uh you know we could lift up a
[1:13:08] man wow brother Chad did some wonderful
[1:13:10] preaching he did appreciate it uh are we
[1:13:13] trying to build up a man or we let's
[1:13:15] just give God the glory brother Chad
[1:13:17] can't preach nobody can preach and be of
[1:13:20] any effect on an eternal level unless
[1:13:23] it's God doing the work so you know
[1:13:26] there's men great preachers doing a
[1:13:28] great job um but drawing disciples after
[1:13:31] themselves so we don't go around brag
[1:13:33] about those things and we don't want to
[1:13:35] do that here you know post it up on the
[1:13:37] internet oh this all this happened this
[1:13:38] happened um it was a blessing to be
[1:13:42] there let's just put it at that so just
[1:13:44] don't let the right hand or the left
[1:13:45] hand know what the right hand's doing we
[1:13:47] talk about it among ourselves but we
[1:13:49] don't blast that out somewhere because
[1:13:50] that's self- Pride like like God could
[1:13:53] only do that for one person you know
[1:13:57] come back saying I prayed for so and so
[1:13:59] they were healed um why don't you just
[1:14:02] say it like it really is that person had
[1:14:04] enough Faith to touch God Amen you just
[1:14:06] hav to be standing there
[1:14:10] amen as if God could only do it for one
[1:14:12] person what what an arrogant attitude to
[1:14:14] think man I the people really blessed by
[1:14:16] my Ministry Lord help me Lord help me
[1:14:20] he'd do it for anybody that will believe
[1:14:22] him amen it's belief Faith whatever
[1:14:25] whatever you want to do whatever your
[1:14:26] thoughts are take it to God he provides
[1:14:28] everything isn't that
[1:14:30] right he says now everybody can't be a
[1:14:33] preacher but you got a voice and if you
[1:14:35] can't preach the people a sermon if
[1:14:36] you're a preacher you're called to the
[1:14:38] pulpit to preach if you're not you're
[1:14:40] still a preacher but live the people of
[1:14:42] sermon let your sermon be lived it's the
[1:14:44] voice of God that will bring reproach to
[1:14:45] them who reject it they say no one can
[1:14:47] put a finger on his or her life they're
[1:14:49] sweet living they if they never was a
[1:14:52] man of God if there ever was a man of
[1:14:54] God it's that man or that woman see live
[1:14:56] your sermons don't try to preach them if
[1:14:58] you're not called to be a preacher you
[1:15:00] get all mixed up anyhow and messed up
[1:15:02] and you'll get the people tangled up and
[1:15:04] you won't know well you'll you'll ruin
[1:15:06] them and yourself too just live your
[1:15:07] sermon the preacher is called to preach
[1:15:10] his and live it too if you can't live it
[1:15:13] then stop preaching
[1:15:15] it but you're supposed to live your
[1:15:17] sermons all right here is voices Oh how
[1:15:20] we need in Jeffersonville thousands of
[1:15:22] lived voices the Thunder of God th
[1:15:24] thundering out in sweetness Holiness
[1:15:26] Purity undefiled lives you know we could
[1:15:29] we could cut that quote in half there
[1:15:32] and talk about the thunder of the god
[1:15:33] and and man we could get an evangelist
[1:15:35] up here and and really drive that home
[1:15:37] the Thunder of God thundering out
[1:15:38] against this sinful nation and let's not
[1:15:41] forget the rest of that thundering out

[1:15:56] care how loud you can holler the devil
[1:15:58] don't care how much you can jump or how
[1:15:59] much you can do this or shout but What
[1:16:01] Hurts The Devil is to see that
[1:16:02] Sanctified holy life consecrated to God
[1:16:05] say anything to him call him anything
[1:16:07] just as sweet as it can be and move
[1:16:08] right on oh my that throws him away
[1:16:11] that's the Thunder that shakes the devil
[1:16:13] you want to shake the devil you want to
[1:16:14] Stomp The Devil you want to give him a
[1:16:16] black eye all right there you
[1:16:18] go do it sweetly do it humbly just like
[1:16:23] well you say if I could preach like
[1:16:24] Billy Graham or or Roberts or somebody a
[1:16:26] great intellectual speaker he' oh no
[1:16:28] sometimes the devil just laughs at that
[1:16:30] he don't pay no more attention to that
[1:16:32] than nothing you get all the theology
[1:16:34] you wanted to and all the Seminary
[1:16:36] training and the devil just sit back and
[1:16:38] laugh at it but when he sees that life
[1:16:41] look at those disciples down there that
[1:16:42] Maniac child that day with epilepsy
[1:16:46] saying come out of him devil come out of
[1:16:47] him devil come out of him devil the
[1:16:49] devil sitting there said now aren't you

[1:16:54] you he commissioned you to go cast me
[1:16:56] out not one of you can do it didn't move
[1:16:59] that devil but brother when they seen
[1:17:01] him come one come walking quietly uhoh
[1:17:04] Oh my he didn't have to say nothing that

[1:17:11] come a
[1:17:12] life not only a sermon but a life said
[1:17:15] come out of him oh my that done it
[1:17:17] quietly he knowed what he was talking
[1:17:19] about he know what he was doing amen
[1:17:25] amen excuse
[1:17:28] me you
[1:17:30] know
[1:17:32] uh just like brother Gabe was saying you
[1:17:36] know I don't understand a lot of things
[1:17:38] I don't have deep Revelation I'm not
[1:17:40] even going to pretend to waste of my
[1:17:41] time waste of your time I'm not going to
[1:17:43] fool anybody I'll just be the fool but I
[1:17:45] won't fool anybody
[1:17:49] so this message in all of its Theology
[1:17:51] and Doctrine which is just good we need
[1:17:54] that I need that I need to be more
[1:17:56] dedicated to to understanding but if
[1:17:59] there's no life behind it you're wasting
[1:18:01] your
[1:18:10] time you ready to quit brother
[1:18:13] Chad that's the last quote I've got want
[1:18:17] you come on
[1:18:20] up I'll share just a little a little bit
[1:18:23] more experience with you my brother Chad
[1:18:25] standing up here suffering with
[1:18:29] me I let him down over
[1:18:32] there got a sore
[1:18:34] throat but God was good to
[1:18:37] us at that church
[1:18:39] dedication uh I was taking the
[1:18:41] pictures and uh as the brothers were
[1:18:44] going up to the to the front door to cut
[1:18:46] the ribbon you know I'm trying to get a
[1:18:48] picture with the camera and um I could
[1:18:51] have jumped to the front I could have
[1:18:52] pushed my way through the crowd and
[1:18:54] stood right up on top video camera would
[1:18:56] been on me the the Drone would have
[1:18:57] shown me and then I could started making
[1:19:00] myself known glad to have you all here
[1:19:02] and like to introduce you to the pastor
[1:19:03] here and just and take what a shame what
[1:19:06] a shame to think of somebody stepping
[1:19:08] out of their position like that and uh I
[1:19:12] just this was such a reverent moment
[1:19:15] between brother ran the congregation and
[1:19:18] this was a special moment they labored
[1:19:20] for and I just thought this is not my
[1:19:23] place it's not my
[1:19:26] position stand back get the pictures
[1:19:29] record it but don't get in the way you
[1:19:31] know if you ever been around a cing
[1:19:33] couple and maybe they step off into a
[1:19:35] room just to have a few private words
[1:19:37] and you step in there un knowing and all
[1:19:39] of a sudden you realize that I wasn't
[1:19:41] invited here and you just kind of
[1:19:44] quietly excuse yourself sorry just step
[1:19:47] out you know those are holy moments that
[1:19:51] uh that sometimes we experience and uh I
[1:19:55] kind of experienced that at that church
[1:19:57] dedication and then I kind of shared
[1:20:00] that as a little testimony with at
[1:20:02] brother Aaron George's on the uh
[1:20:04] Saturday night meeting and
[1:20:08] U and that's just the way I feel you
[1:20:10] know at that meeting I I said you know
[1:20:12] God wants to speak to you and uh I don't
[1:20:15] want to interrupt what God wants to
[1:20:18] speak to you just let me step
[1:20:21] aside
[1:20:23] let me do that
[1:20:30] daily God's God's got a relationship in
[1:20:35] mind he doesn't need me in the
[1:20:39] way um I was the best man at a at a good
[1:20:43] friend's wedding and uh so that's a
[1:20:45] place of honor stood in the
[1:20:47] front I could have stepped up and taken
[1:20:50] the microphone the the pastor introduce
[1:20:53] myself and begin to just it's out of
[1:20:55] place you're you're not called that it I
[1:20:57] was in place of honor it was uh as a
[1:20:59] really privilege to be
[1:21:02] there I was there to serve the the bride
[1:21:05] the bridegroom I knew him he was my good
[1:21:07] friend I didn't know his bride I'd never
[1:21:11] met her
[1:21:12] before and uh I can't serve the groom
[1:21:17] without serving the bride you know to
[1:21:20] say do you you know to the groom do you
[1:21:22] need something to drink you know would
[1:21:23] you like this like that you know what
[1:21:26] can I get for you and ignore the bride
[1:21:28] or if she said could I have a drink like
[1:21:30] you know you got your own attendance I'm
[1:21:32] here for the groom you know what an
[1:21:35] insult and but also at the reception
[1:21:38] dinner of course I get to sit in the
[1:21:40] front at the recept big table you know
[1:21:42] and but when when I see the bride or the
[1:21:45] groom uh run out of something you know
[1:21:47] their favorite little pastry or their
[1:21:49] drink or something I'd hop up and and
[1:21:51] get it to them because they were special
[1:21:53] to me if she's special enough for him to
[1:21:56] marry then she's special to me too but
[1:21:59] then I got to thinking about the the the
[1:22:02] guests they weren't the best man I was
[1:22:04] the best man they weren't the the bride
[1:22:08] but they were the guests and they were
[1:22:10] all invited so they were special to the
[1:22:11] bride and the groom so I felt like if
[1:22:16] they're special to them then they're
[1:22:18] special to me too and that's the way I
[1:22:20] want to approach uh things not to say
[1:22:23] that I always do but thinking of those
[1:22:25] siks and those Hindus over there uh the
[1:22:29] Sinners walking the street and on our
[1:22:31] own uh
[1:22:33] communities um they might be at that
[1:22:35] wedding
[1:22:36] supper maybe not as the bride but they
[1:22:39] might be there as a guest and how do we
[1:22:42] serve
[1:22:43] them if you've got an arrogant attitude
[1:22:46] that uh you know I had been the best man
[1:22:49] had the fancy suit on you know I could
[1:22:52] have an attit itude it's like look at me
[1:22:54] I got the suit you don't
[1:22:57] but if an arrogant attitude as we read
[1:23:00] at the beginning is not of
[1:23:02] God and I want to have a heart for the
[1:23:05] people because they're he died for them
[1:23:08] and uh yes it's his desire that they'd
[1:23:11] be there some of them will be according
[1:23:13] to how they treat the bride uh
[1:23:17] so I just put a challenge out there to
[1:23:19] you amen what kind of an attitude do we
[1:23:21] have
[1:23:23] how are we looking at people seen a
[1:23:25] little Hindu child I guess on one of the
[1:23:26] airplanes had a little dot center of his
[1:23:28] head it was I don't know um seven or
[1:23:32] eight months- old cutest little guy
[1:23:35] parent you know tossing it up in the air
[1:23:37] and it's giggling and laughing
[1:23:39] just that poor little child is going to
[1:23:42] be set on a
[1:23:43] path just like its parents were set on a
[1:23:45] path if it wasn't for God's grace
[1:23:47] brother Gabe we could be there amen
[1:23:52] right if we've got the love of God in
[1:23:53] our
[1:23:54] heart let's live like Christ how did he
[1:23:58] live amen God bless you it's good to be
[1:24:00] home good to see
[1:24:02] [Applause]
[1:24:17] you praise God Amen it was wonderful it
[1:24:22] was Wonder wonderful to be together it's
[1:24:23] wonderful to experience the things
[1:24:25] together that we experienced and uh I
[1:24:28] really like that thought and brother
[1:24:30] doesn't know it because we we already
[1:24:32] know he told us he didn't get the Kyle's
[1:24:33] message yet but he's right in line with
[1:24:35] what Kyle preached so right in the same
[1:24:37] vein of thought brother so that was
[1:24:39] really good the continuity was wonderful
[1:24:40] did you notice that everything just
[1:24:42] moves right in line amen I think God's
[1:24:45] speaking to us teaching us that the way
[1:24:48] we treat people matters our attitude our
[1:24:51] conduct and what we think
[1:24:53] amen matters because we don't know who's
[1:24:56] who but we know everybody's got the
[1:24:58] potential amen if God if God put their
[1:25:01] name in the Lamb's Book of Life they're
[1:25:03] going to be there as long as they don't
[1:25:04] do something to have their name removed
[1:25:06] they're going to be there amen praise
[1:25:08] God I just want to share just a couple
[1:25:10] more things with you and then we'll
[1:25:13] close but uh I just want to say we met
[1:25:17] some fantastic Brothers while we were
[1:25:19] there Brothers who've labored for years
[1:25:22] years pastored for a long time started
[1:25:25] multiple churches and we we've seen the
[1:25:27] sacrifices that they have made and I
[1:25:30] just want to just say it was a blessing
[1:25:32] for me just to sit down and talk to them
[1:25:35] veterans you know you always think when
[1:25:37] you get invited to go some place and
[1:25:39] they they invite you and they want you
[1:25:40] to come or maybe you travel from America
[1:25:43] and it's a misconception many times
[1:25:45] amongst individuals that somehow that
[1:25:48] they need
[1:25:49] you these are brothers who started 60
[1:25:51] churches Church they don't need you
[1:25:54] they're just there CU they appreciate
[1:25:55] you you're a friend to them they may
[1:25:57] appreciate the ministry that God's put
[1:25:58] in you but they don't need you my
[1:26:00] goodness they started brother Mara py
[1:26:02] started over 50 churches he's ordained
[1:26:04] more than 50
[1:26:05] ministers they they they didn't need us
[1:26:08] did they brother Ron but we sure enjoyed
[1:26:10] their Fellowship sure learned from
[1:26:12] them you know brother Samuel Kota and
[1:26:15] his dad brother peash and his brother
[1:26:17] Boaz they worked together and uh they
[1:26:19] started over 100 churches they together
[1:26:22] have built more than 100 churches amen
[1:26:26] they didn't need us but the fact is they
[1:26:29] wanted fellowship and they enjoy we
[1:26:30] enjoyed the fellowship with them we had
[1:26:31] a good time and so every time I travel
[1:26:33] anywhere where the bride of Christ is I
[1:26:35] learn something every time I go I mean
[1:26:38] of course we preach we go but it's the
[1:26:40] fellowship where I really grow when I
[1:26:43] sit down and and talk to Brothers been
[1:26:44] there and done that and meet the
[1:26:46] brothers and hear the testimonies just
[1:26:47] like brother Ron was saying everybody we
[1:26:49] talked to had a tremendous testimony
[1:26:51] coming out of SE ISM coming out of
[1:26:53] Hinduism coming out of denominationalism
[1:26:55] coming out of whatever am me just like
[1:26:57] here when we get together in Fellowship
[1:26:58] everybody's got a tremendous story and
[1:27:00] it's a blessing and I feel like it's
[1:27:02] just a privilege just to be able to meet
[1:27:04] our brothers and sisters on the other
[1:27:06] side of the planet and so it was it was
[1:27:08] wonderful just to see the work that
[1:27:10] they're doing and how God's blessed it
[1:27:13] and uh it makes me want to do more for
[1:27:16] the kingdom of God every time I travel
[1:27:19] every time I see the brothers every time
[1:27:20] I witness what they've done I always
[1:27:23] want to give more it's always made me
[1:27:25] want to give more always made me want to
[1:27:27] do more and I don't want to hold back
[1:27:29] and I don't want to live a selfish
[1:27:32] life let's all
[1:27:34] stand we're just going to close we're
[1:27:37] invite the musicians to
[1:27:40] come one more thing i' I'd like to say
[1:27:43] is I thought brother Ron looked pretty
[1:27:45] good in the suit
[1:27:46] today yeah and I like the suit I'm
[1:27:49] wearing both of these suits were a gift
[1:27:51] from from Brother Samuel go they took us
[1:27:54] to a tailor shop we weren't expecting it
[1:27:56] we ate lunch we were going to go to the
[1:27:58] meetings we stopped and they said
[1:27:59] brothers let's go in here so brother Ron
[1:28:02] I we don't know why we're going to shop
[1:28:03] we going into the shop and it's all nice
[1:28:05] you know suits and stuff and brother
[1:28:07] Samuel said we're going to buy you a
[1:28:09] suit and uh brother Ron kind of stood in
[1:28:12] the back and he was waiting for me to
[1:28:14] get fitted for my suit Taylor comes out
[1:28:15] and measures and the brother said oh no
[1:28:17] no you're getting a suit too and brings
[1:28:18] Ron back so I had fun watching brother
[1:28:20] Ron get fitted for a suit it was a
[1:28:22] special privilege amen and and so
[1:28:25] they're so kind so generous with such
[1:28:28] Hospitality they really know how to
[1:28:30] treat the bride of Christ and they go
[1:28:31] all out and I want to be the same way I
[1:28:34] really I want to treat everybody with
[1:28:36] respect and kindness and the Bible says
[1:28:39] you know as much as you have opportunity
[1:28:40] do good unto all men it says but
[1:28:42] especially those that are of the
[1:28:44] household of faith and we were showered
[1:28:46] upon with hospitality they treated us so
[1:28:48] good and they were so kind to us but you
[1:28:51] know what that's the way I want to be I
[1:28:53] want to treat the the children of God
[1:28:55] the same way and I said God help me to
[1:28:58] do a better job help me to have the
[1:29:00] right attitude help me as brother R is
[1:29:03] saying help me to live the life that's
[1:29:05] the Thunder against the devil am the
[1:29:07] Thunder that shakes the devil is this
[1:29:09] message lived in flesh this message
[1:29:13] becoming materialized fleshed out amen
[1:29:16] it's one thing to know it and say I know
[1:29:18] it you know it but do you know it know
[1:29:20] it because if you know it it becom comes
[1:29:22] translated into aive amen The Knowing is
[1:29:25] not the knowing but the knowing is the
[1:29:26] living where the message becomes flesh
[1:29:29] and your and my flesh amen that's the
[1:29:32] message alive amen it's not alive
[1:29:35] because it can be preached that's
[1:29:36] wonderful that's an anointed preaching
[1:29:37] we we love that it Thrills us it Thrills
[1:29:40] something down inside of us amen but
[1:29:42] what's happening is during the anointed
[1:29:43] preaching of the word it's waking up the
[1:29:45] word inside of you the word is
[1:29:47] connecting to the word to bring more
[1:29:49] word to life because that's the Thunder
[1:29:52] that shakes the devil is the word being
[1:29:55] made manifest remember the devil there
[1:29:58] was a prophecy and in Isaiah Isaiah
[1:30:01] chapter 7 said a virgin shall conceive
[1:30:03] that's the word amen and the devil was
[1:30:06] trying everything to stop that word from
[1:30:08] coming to pass right he knew all the way
[1:30:10] back in Genesis 3 amen that that that
[1:30:14] the seed of the woman shall bruise the
[1:30:15] head of the serpent so he knows there's
[1:30:17] a prophecy laying there now a virgin
[1:30:19] shall conceive and all the way back in
[1:30:22] the day when Moses was born there was a
[1:30:23] prophecy of a deliverer and he's always
[1:30:25] been trying to stop that Prophecy from
[1:30:27] coming to forth he doesn't want the word
[1:30:29] to move from prophecy to
[1:30:32] life so in Moses they killed all the all
[1:30:36] the baby boys why they're trying to stop
[1:30:39] the word from coming into manifested
[1:30:42] word it's bad enough that was that was
[1:30:45] prophesied word prophesied word is
[1:30:47] trouble enough for the devil but as long
[1:30:48] as he can hinder the prophetic word from
[1:30:51] becoming the manifested word then he
[1:30:53] still sits in his seat amen still has
[1:30:56] some semblance of control so what's the
[1:30:58] devil trying to do he's trying to stop
[1:31:01] word from becoming manifested word and
[1:31:05] so what's he trying to do in our lives
[1:31:06] with all the troubles and all the trials
[1:31:08] and all the issues and The Temptations
[1:31:10] and all that he's trying to stop the
[1:31:12] prophecy that's over your life from
[1:31:14] becoming manifested
[1:31:16] prophecy so that we can sit and listen
[1:31:18] to the word preach and say that was good
[1:31:20] preaching but then have no manifest
[1:31:22] station that's where he's trying to work
[1:31:24] you can sit and hear but hey I want to
[1:31:26] sit and hear the word so that the word
[1:31:28] can come to life inside of me that's the
[1:31:30] Thunder that shakes the
[1:31:32] devil say God use this Tabernacle of
[1:31:36] clay I yield it to you what does God
[1:31:38] need
[1:31:39] preeminence amen preeminence he needs
[1:31:42] first place and ultimate control say God
[1:31:46] I want to surrender myself to you so you
[1:31:48] can have preeminence so that you can
[1:31:50] come into this body of Flesh and be the
[1:31:52] thunder in me that shakes the devil CU
[1:31:55] we know it's not a life that we can live
[1:31:57] it's just something we surrender
[1:31:58] ourselves to that he comes in and he
[1:32:01] lives
[1:32:02] himself amen we saw the life lived yes
[1:32:06] would you testify of that we saw the
[1:32:09] life lived we saw the effect it has on
[1:32:11] others the effect it had on us I I just
[1:32:14] don't want to waste the life that he's
[1:32:16] given me on this Earth not having an
[1:32:20] opportunity every day to be thunder that
[1:32:22] shakes the
[1:32:23] devil every day I want to surrender
[1:32:26] myself to Christ so Christ can do
[1:32:28] something with this Tabernacle of Flesh
[1:32:32] that I cannot do
[1:32:33] myself amen I know you're the same way
[1:32:35] that's why you're
[1:32:37] here Amen Let say God bless you thank
[1:32:40] you for praying for us it was a
[1:32:42] wonderful time it was a wonderful
[1:32:44] privilege amen and God was certainly
[1:32:47] good to
[1:32:48] us let's just bow our heads and pray
[1:32:50] together

[1:32:56] your

[1:33:45] may may we be found faithful by your
[1:33:48] grace God help us Lord to to Freshly
[1:33:52] surrender ourselves to you
[1:33:54] today just to be committed Lord as we
[1:33:57] stand here to say God I want to be one
[1:34:01] of those vessels that you can
[1:34:03] use the prophet said you don't have to
[1:34:06] preach a sermon even without preaching
[1:34:08] you're preaching and God I want my life
[1:34:11] to preach a sermon but I know that my
[1:34:15] own life is not enough I must die to my
[1:34:17] life so that I can receive your life
[1:34:19] because your life In Me Is the life that
[1:34:22] shakes the devil and it does it through
