========================================
the revelation of Christ the understanding of the Lord Jesus Christ will bring us Escape help us to escape the pollutions of the world I want to escape the pollutions of the world I must know him he is the answer he is the solution I must know him I must know about him I must have the correct understanding I must know him and who he is in this day I must know him intimately today not where he was or where he will be but I must know him amen listen uh there's a lot of people that I have known in life but I don't know now right if you ask me about one of my childhood friends and say do you know such and such yeah I know him then they say well where's he live I don't know who's he married to I don't know is he married I don't know does he have children I don't know where does he work I don't know and you say I thought you said you know him the correct statement is I knew him and in that day I knew him when we were in fifth grade together you could ask me that day do you know sudden says and I would say yes I know him and you would say where does he go to school I know what's his favorite grade I know what does he like for lunch I know where does he live I know I know where's who's his mother and father I know because I know him Right But as time move on that friend of mine has now changed there's a greater revelation of him there was a certain Revelation I understood as a fifth grader but now as a grown man in his in his 40s amen with a family or a career or wherever he's at in the world and whatever he's doing I don't know him anymore I knew him and that's the same thing with trying to take a denominational understanding of Jesus Christ amen what he was in Luther's day was him that was him Amen to catch the Revelation that God was bringing in that day amen was to receive Christ was to come in contact with the knowledge of the Lord but now I can you can come this far and say do you know him well I knew him but what's he doing today amen how's he revealing himself today how's he manifesting himself today amen then you don't know him so I want to know him not to have known him or will know him but I want to know him now amen I want to know what he's doing I want to know what his desire is I want to know what he's thinking I want to know what his plan is I want to know what he's trying to accomplish in this day do you know how privileged we are as a people to know him amen by the Revelation not to say I have known him I knew where he was but I know him now amen
