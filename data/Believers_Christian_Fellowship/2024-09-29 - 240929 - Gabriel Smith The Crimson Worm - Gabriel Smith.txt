everyone coming out and uh just uh it's okay maybe we'll just get right into the word this morning I uh it's got some on my heart I I uh it's been a blessing for me to uh look at and uh read visit I um it been years and years ago I I had um uh I I love I love the uh I love the book itself but uh I also like to um I like to have um a uh a computer program because it's easy just to click on a word and uh and I I um I'm so glad I clicked on that word and uh and when I clicked on the word it the Roman Candle started going off and it it started going off probably I don't know 12 14 years ago when I saw it and it's still going off so uh and so I hope uh the Roman Candle goes off for you this morning and uh uh so we're going to look at um um we're going to look at uh the book of Isaiah [Music] 41 in verse 8 and but thou Israel art my servant Jacob whom I have chosen I I love I love how God flipped it because when before Jacob uh became Israel he has already chosen if you see that there Jacob whom I have chosen the Seed of Abraham my friend now be mindful he just he just referred to Jacob as a friend thou whom I have taken from the ends of the Earth and called thee from the chief men thereof and said unto thee Thou Art my servant I have chosen thee and not cast thee away fear thou not for I'm with thee I want you to notice how encouraging God is speaking of Jacob and and the multiple times that he tells him don't be afraid uh he says fear not from I'm with thee be not dismayed um and that dismayed speaks of anxiety and if we ever lived in The Age of Anxiety it's now amen uh and so I believe it's very fitting to read the scripture this morning says for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yay I will help thee yay I will uphold thee with the right hand the power the authority of my righteousness behold all they that were in sensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded they shall be as nothing and they that strive with thee Shall Perish Thou shalt seek them and shalt not find them even them that contendeth with thee they that war against thee shall be as nothing and as a thing of not for I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not I will help thee now I want you to look at p uh at verse 14 fear not thou worm now God had just called Jacob a friend in verse 8 and and now God's calling him a worm but I trust hopefully it won't take uh but a few minutes in this service that you be want to be called a worm too it says fear not thou worm Jacob and ye men now that men doesn't necessarily speak speak of masculine male and female but that actually speaks of few so if I could read it ye few a faithful few ye few of Israel I will help Thee sayith the Lord and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel and I'd like to speak to you uh this morning by the help of the Lord on the Crimson worm let's bow our heads Heavenly Father truly we love you today and grateful to be called by your name and Lord we just want to ask that your forgiveness be upon our lives today Lord each one that's here this morning might it be a repented heart mind and included Lord that we could stand before you uh pure and white clean arrayed in fine linen and Lord we're just wanting to gather around your Eternal Word and ask that you'd have full sway in this service Lord for our pastor Brother Kyle Brothers there's as their way Minister and we're asking that your blessings would flow Lord to them strengthen and encourage them and each one that they would receive something from thee and Lord we welcome you here in this service Lord asking that you would have the preeminence uh I want Lord uh it to be a service where only your word is brought forth and that my thoughts would be set aside and that your Eternal Word would shine forth today that we could see you a little bit clear and walk a little bit straighter and talk with more clarity in our in our testimony God we love you we praise you and we commit all we are into your hands and we ask these things to be so in the mighty unfailing name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you be seated if like the Crimson worm and uh uh it it I'm going to have to maybe build a little bit but uh you you bear with me um and so thinking of a little itty bitty Worm but I I want to go back to uh before there ever was a world and as God uh spoke uh not only this world into existence but the universe and how inexhaustable and unattainable and how Mighty and unfathomable this universe that we live in is right it goes from eternity to Eternity and as great big as this universe is and unfathomable for our minds to comprehend that it goes from Glory into Glory but I I I want you as we all know as Believers that even though this universe is so unmeasurable and and unv comprehendable with our own uh Minds yet God is so mindful even to uh seemingly the insignificance of a worm and uh this little Crimson worm that we're going to speak of this morning is is quite a beautiful uh little worm and uh uh it's more of uh maybe a a grub um uh the the the males uh have wings but the the mothers do not and this worm as you I want you to you'll see the characteristics and it's going to paint a beautiful picture of redemption um this particular worm uh we're going to speak of the mother this morning but when she um uh is going to uh give birth she finds a particular oak tree and it's a Evergreen Oak tree that she she doesn't just take pick any particular tree but there's a deep calling out to the Deep amen and and this little itty bitty worm finds in the Mediterranean and in northern Europe and it it finds this uh Evergreen Oak Tree and when this little mother begins to uh uh be with child she attaches herself to a a a root or excuse me to a a branch or or a a the trunk of a tree and she fixes herself in such a way as it's no she goes uh to the point of no return that uh once she's there she's there and she's going to finish it through because when she attaches herself to this tree she will never leave it again and and and these uh particular uh uh uh worms are actually used uh uh way back when in the um there there's a uh a cup full of them these these are very very small little worms they are actually so beautiful how God designed them they are between five and 7 mm in length yes uh that's Grace and Perfection uh and come on brother Frank go brother Franco got a little preview there in the back so I so uh when you see these they are little itty bitty things uh there's a a a picture of one um and and in in uh the the fingers uh of of someone and uh it is actually used uh in the making of dyes uh way back in the in the ancient days it was actually used uh this particular worm was used into making the Tabernacle uh when when uh Moses uh got the blueprint from God and as you see there was four layers to that uh four outside layers to that Tabernacle his Badger skin Ram skin died red and so that Ram skin dyed red was made with those little itty bitty worms uh and and not only that but when it was on the inside of the Tabernacle that was also anything that was a Scarlet of crimson was used as such was used of this little worm even to the priest's garments uh when they used this when they dyed uh the priest garments it was made with this Scarlet worm uh so beautiful even so much uh with the red heer in the sacrifice when it would have the cedar wood the hiss up and the Scarlet that Scarlet was actually that Crimson worm uh whenever it was uh whenever they would have the scapegoat and and they would uh you won't find this in scripture but according to Jewish tradition they would take a Scarlet thread and they would wrap U the uh one that was going to be uh sent out of the camp they would wrap it around the the the horns and and then the other one that was going to be offered for a sacrifice they would wrap a Scarlet thread around its neck and obviously speaking of redemption uh and even so beautiful that uh uh uh when when um Rahab would let down despised it was by a Scarlet thread and so that Scarlet thread was speaking of redemption and and so as we begin to look at this uh I I I it's just going to paint a beautiful picture if I can uh by the help of the Lord bring it in a way that you'll be able to see it because uh as our Prophet taught us in the Bible plainly SP tells us that there's a Scarlet thread that rolls through the Scriptures it starts in Genesis and it goes all the way to the Book of Revelations and I'm so grateful to be tied to that Scarlet thread this morning amen and so the first time that the Scarlet thread is spoken of is in Genesis 38: 28 uh when it speaks of Tamar and Judah and Tamar uh uh is found in the lineage of of Christ as we all know as Bible readers uh but uh her her husband had uh passed away before she was able to conceive uh and uh then she had married the next son and he had passed away and then Judah had begin to uh uh promis her another son but then he he he he uh faded away from that and and so she took it upon herself uh to bring forth that that firstborn child and I believe it was a deep calling out to a deep because through Tamar comes the lineage of Jesus Christ naturally speaking and so uh a beautiful thing that um uh and as you see in the scripture there Tamar had brought forth twins but uh Zarah was actually the one that had the Scarlet thread as the as the picture shows you but phz was was considered the first born but but Zara was the one that stuck out his hand first and so uh if and if you want to look at that in the Book of Matthew it tells us Matthew chap 1 uh in verse three and Judas beet FES and Zarah of Tamar and FES beet ezam and ezam be got amram and on on on down to David everybody with me so far but the beautiful thing is even though FZ was that natural seed line Zara was a reflection of Christ The Royal seed amen yes so so when we when we look at this now now this ain't just my thought thankfully this morning uh we're not dependent upon my uh idea of it but we've had a prophet of God in our day give us uh the Divine interpretation of it with Divine Vindication and and so brother branam has asked this question in 1957 and he explains it in questions and an the Hebrews uh three the first baby that was to be born the old Jewish custom the firstborn had the birthright the first child to break forth and remember was her first child none of the rest of the boys had any uh children by her they're so beautiful by the way brother John pre singing the Crimson stream believe was very fitting this morning uh she so watch she said uh none of the rest of boys had had had any children by her she never had a child to this time and when her first child broke forth it was just a hand and the Midwife put a a Scarlet streak around because a Scarlet streak spake of redemption that the first son of the Virgin Mary would have the Scarlet streak of redemption PowerPoint courtesy of brother Franco and when he drew his hand back the other one came first and when he did said why did you do this the other one has the birthright so that was Genesis 38 means you see that the first child still remained until the coming of the Lord Jesus that the first was under the Redemptive law so so when we think about this uh um looking at at um Genesis phz was the one that had the natural birth right but but zarra was the one that broke forth the hand from The Matrix and the and the the the Midwife wrapped that Scarlet thread around her which spoke of Christ see because we in our natural selves there look I don't know about you but I cannot brag on my natural uh family tree amen but but that's why phz didn't have the Scarlet thread Zarah did Hallelujah see because uh this morning we are not looking we are not looking to a natural seed line cuz the Bible tells us that we're that we've been purchased by the blood of God we we are not saved this morning by Jewish blood nor no you know people want to argue what you know what what color was Jesus and I look Jesus was God Amen right that that that hemoglobin sperm of of the mighty one Jehovah himself we are saved by the blood of God right and so when we look at FES FZ may have been the first natural of firstborn naturally speaking but but Christ was actually in Zarah showing a prefigure that he was before David in David and after David he is both root and offspring of David and so we are not coming into this world by happenstance or chance but every one of our footsteps is divinely orchestrated by the almighty amen hallelujah amen yes yes so so so grateful this morning to be able to stand here and and remember brother bam talked about a Scarlet he said Scarlet speaks of royalty so when we look at Isaiah 41 and he says he calls him a friend but then he says Jacob the worm Jacob he's referring to Jacob as this Crimson worm now as you follow this worm through the scriptures God Is So Perfect in his word amen so much so that in job 25 it speaks of not only one Worm but two yes how then can man be justified with God or or how can he be clean that is born of a woman behold even to the moon and it shineth not y the stars are not pureing his sight how much man that is a worm and the son of man which is a worm amen and so in this scripture here there's actually twins praise God because the son of man worm is cus elisius the Crimson Worm but the manorm is actually a maggot yes and it and it actually speaks of of being exalted or lifted up so so in the scriptures you actually see twins so much so that there was a can and there was an Abel there was an Esau and there was a Jacob there was a Jesus and a Judas and there was wheat and tears and there was two worms but one was covered by the blood and the other one was not praise God amen amen and as we know this quote so perfectly H it heard it many times but don't let it become common to you the Book of Revelation shows that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan Reveals His Works attempting destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time that he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits working within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless amen before her and so I I I I'm just I'm so grateful this morning that God would have you know we all know that God's word's perfect but I love to see it um Express itself in perfection even down to when he speaks of worms that there would be two and that it would be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible but remember one was under the anointing of a man and the other one was under the anointing of the son of man amen amen God and and and so because we are under that the under the opes of the son of man Ministry that is the reflection of the Crimson worm everybody with me this morning y'all don't think I'm crazy do you I am a little bit but but so so we have to be Anointed with that son of man Ministry and by being Anointed with that son of man Ministry shows that we are reflecting this little Crimson worm amen amen and again you think of how vast the universe is but God is mindful of every little little detail and when God created and this is what I I I hope you catch when God created this little itty bitty worm there would be billions upon billions of people look at this worm and not see what you see this morning amen but it just goes to show the Perfection of God that he is mindful down to the least ity detail you think of all the billions of these worms that's that's lived and given birth and every time that one gave birth it was expressing the book of redemption amen every time that it was being crushed to bring forth that Scarlet dye it was reflecting the almighty God Is So Perfect yes Amen in every aspect of his being and so when you when you would see in the scriptures watch E even even to um Psalms 22 And1 when David would be anointed and he would cry out my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me thou art the th so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring David would be under the anointing and he would be prophesying what our what our great uh our great Redeemer would Express that day on calvary's tree but I want you to notice what he says in verse 6 he says but I am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised of the people so David was actually expressing what Christ was going to be portraying that day on Calvary because Christ almighty would be saying as as he's walking down those cobbled streets carrying a Rugged Cross he would be expressing this little Crimson worm so when he says I am a worm he's saying I am this little itty bitty caucus elisis I am not a man I I am portraying this Scarlet thread of redemption so when the Lord Jesus would be stripped in Matthew 27 and those Roman soldiers would wrap a Scarlet robe around him if you have a bible program and you tap on the word scarlet it'll take you to that Scarlet worm so when he says I am a worm and no man and those and those Roman soldiers are wrapped in in a Scarlet thread they are portraying Psalms 22 because they are they are wrapping him in this Scarlet robe and because see it is is so beautiful everybody see this he says and so so what they are doing when they're mocking him because remember when we would not have a birth this morning if it wasn't for Christ saying I am a worm and no man because he was laying down his life for us his sheep right and and so and so it this is so beautiful that when you look at this study out this this this particular worm it says the dye was made from the dried body of the female worm cus elisius worm maggot grub grub the worm cus elisius when the female of the Scarlet worm species was ready to give F birth to her young she would attach her body to the trunk of a tree fixing herself so firmly and perly that she would never leave again the eggs deposited beneath her body were thus protected until the larvey were hatched and able to enter into their own life cycle as the mother died the Crimson fluid stained her body and the surrounding wood so when this little itty bitty worm is giving birth to her young she is portraying that day on calvary's tree prise God because he told us to eat his flesh and drink his blood he also says that the that them baby as they are as they are coming to the mature time to be birthed they begin to feed upon their mother he is the bread of life and what are we feeding on this morning the unfailing body word of the son of man not a man not a not a maggot that's death right when maggots are there that's when something dies and it's the decompose right but but this right here is to have life and life more abundantly right and and so this this worm it it it is so precious that as and it's not a very good picture but you can see that as these mothers had given birth the the the tree is stained by the the life of that mother yes this same as that Rugged Cross was stained some 2,000 years ago so that we could have life and life more abundantly so when he would say in Psalms 22 my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me and then verse 22: 6 but I am a worm what was he doing he was expressing what he had created however many thousands however many hundreds of years ago when when he had that worm in his mind and he created it it was a prefigure of what he would do that day on calvary's Street amen so that we could be stained amen look I want to show I want you to see how perfect God's word is so much so that the name cus elisius cus means grain or seed elisius means it is finished so so so when God even named that little one hidden in that name was Redemption hidden in that name oh my where is our hiding place it's in the name it's in the name of Jesus Christ right and and so I'm trying to be good and just and just uh deliver cuz I got so much and and when I studied this out um couple weeks ago um I came across this um this um article and it was published this year July 19th uh of this year and when uh they were actually Excavating in um in um the Judean desert in the it's called the cave of skulls they actually found two little itty bitty pieces of material that they had carbonated back um because and they had they had found out that this this material was actually dyed with that uh Crimson worm and that little itty bitty piece of material that you see in there is 3800 years old they say but it's still red and see uh when you when you look at how permanent this is um it is it it's something that lets us know that um when God does something it's permanent it's not anything that Fades away sometimes we we we wonder and question but God is Not guessing right now he knows the end from the beginning and when the Lord Jesus spilled his blood that blood may have been spilled some 2,000 years ago but it's permanent it's unchanged changing it's unfailing it's unmovable amen and the Bible tells her greater love hath no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends and that mother when she gives birth she is so designed and engineered that she gives her life willingly amen you don't have to tell her nothing amen she willingly gives her life for babies the same as you sisters in a world of perversion you stand as beacons of light you you didn't you didn't you didn't you didn't become a a career woman and but but you gave your life for your babies that's what a real mother is and that's what not only these little itty bitty worms was portrayed praying but remember he's he's El Shai the breasted one and you know it it is so beautiful as this as this mother dies and gives birth to her babies that three days later after she dies three days after she dies right amen Easter morning praise God it it's the Plan of Redemption and so it would have to be 3 days later that what was left of her would be transformed why as wool see because the Bible tells us in Isaiah 1:18 come now let let us reason together saith and I want you to know this is not brother Gabe that's Sayang this this morning but it's the almighty amen and when he tells you to come it actually means to walk together a manner of life God is telling you I want to walk with you and when it says now he's pleading with you so he's I want you to understand in just a few of these verses come means to walk with you now means he's pleading with you and when it says let us reason together that actually means to argue so the god of the universe actually wants to walk with you and be polite in saying please but he actually wants to argue with you saith the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet now no doubt some of us got some things that we done 5 10 20 30 50 years ago just like 3,800 years old that's right but God tells you I want to argue with you about this yes amen amen now it's he don't want to argue with you about how sinful you are and the mistake you made he don't want to rebuke you and chide you and you know really rub it in and because you done this I'm going to make you pay for it and but actually he's saying I'm going to argue with you look I want you to look at this word reason it means to reprove judge rebuke God wants to rebuke you he wants to correct you he wants to reason to reason to get to Chase and to CH convince convict to argue when God is saying I am going I come let us reason together though your sins look you fill in the blank amen amen whatever and and no doubt all of us have a kink in the armor and all of us have that time that remember brother bam says Satan's got a punch and so all of us have that time that we had our guard down and we got knocked out by Satan sometimes multiple times right and it's that thing that keeps coming up every something to happen or something to trigger it whatever it may be and it comes back up and it's just as fresh as the day had happened this is when you need to go to this scripture right here amen because God is telling you I want to argue with you that means I ain't leaving that means God's not going to take no for an answer that though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow am and though they be red like Crimson they shall be made white like w see brother brandham told us many times he talked about red through red equals white right and and we all have got to remember back in the day we'd had them little things the little filters we'd look through and remember we remember these remember and we get to had the picture or whatever and you had you couldn't see it until you put a filter over it and when you put the filter over it then you could actually see what was hidden and the Bible tells us that the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork and when in this last day man has designed things in such a a way called the Hubble telescope that it can go billions and millions of miles and look and see images can you imagine that's actually a picture from the h Hubble Telescope I don't know about you but I think God's eyes are blue and I don't know about you but that looks like the hand of God so when this so when this telescope would look out into the he Heavens you would see an eye a hand but you would also see this only in our day because that Hubble Telescope has prophetic vision and so when we could look at now now science looks at that and they just see uh they call it a ribbon but when we as Believers look at that we see the Scarlet thread of redemption and when I when I looked at this it's so beautiful that uh this is actually the remnants from a star that had died a supernova happened a son died and when a son died the remnants of it was a Scarlet streak of redemption amen and you know what last night I was reading this studying on it and I came across it and the way and it said that that you could only you could only see that by a filter and I thought oh man so you can't see with the natural eye and I was all tore up about it and I took it out of my PowerPoint and I thought oh man I was just so disappointed cuz it looks so good and Oh I thought man then this morning I got up about 1:30 this morning and was studying and praying and and then I looked at it again and it says you can only see it with a filter [Laughter] hallu so so that image you can't see with the naked eye just like people look at you and go what do they believe amen and you go but you just have to have the filter praise God and when you have the the filter then you can see the Scarlet streak of redemption because what's invisible to some is made visible to some too and when we have the filter of thinking man's filter right what is invisible to some Is Not Invisible to all see blessed are your eyes for they see and blessed are your ears for they hear so it could only be in this day this supern NOA happened in ad16 it happened over a thousand years a thousand years ago that Supernova happened and they said when it happened it was recorded uh by the the astrologers back then that's why they know it it was actually May 1st a 1006 cuz it was the brightest star in the sky at that time but even though that even though that star had faded the Scarlet streak Still Remains The Scarlet streak of redemption Still Remains amen but we got to have a filter to be able to see you know when Rebecca came to her Isaac the Bible tells us that Isaac was actually at a whale called leor a leor but if you look at that word that actually means The Well of the living one seeing me and in verse 63 and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening tide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming and remember as as pastor had preached on the a couple Services ago that what Rebecca had watered represented the power the Holy Ghost the word that brought her to her Isaac right but I want you to notice Isaac was watering at The Well of the living one seeing me yes right but when Isaac looked out to see something he didn't see Rebecca saw the camel he wasn't looking at me when he took me in wasn't looking at my heart amen that was Black by sin he was looking at the blood flowing rich and freeall that precious blood that pardon me see when Rebecca was on her way to her Isaac Isaac never saw her all he saw was the camels amen yes we look at ourselves all the time and we look at a natural mirror and that's why we live such a defeated life I didn't say you I said we but when he you know what that word lifted means that lifted means to Bear up endure take away forgive to be swept away so when he lifted up his eyes it would he had eyes of forgiveness and what did he see he saw the power that was packing his bride to him so how are we going to get to our Isaac the only way is by the camel amen we will never make heaven in our own power in our own ability amen it it'll never happen and and you know the thing of it is is is is we get so bogged down and we see our mistakes and we see our failures but you you you know I I uh I uh I I bought a hundred of these I was going to use them for a youth meeting but this morning things changed so I got a hundred of them in my in my bag if anybody needs a reminder sorry about the other 200 of you I have to share cut it in half because we need these reminders be you know you know brother brandom tells us this he says ohen them little fellows it's that innocence I've often thought how innocent a child is and yet if we could only be as innocent as one of these little children but come to find out yes praise God amen amen we're more innocent when the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed us amen from all of our sins amen but you have to believe that that quote does no good standing in a PowerPoint it does no good s being projected amen it you you when Satan tries to tear you down you have to have confidence not in yourself you know sometimes we we struggle so much in seeing ourselves in Eagles but how about this can you just see yourself as a worm yeah some of us would struggle with self-confidence right are we all like I'm an e Eagle belt buckle how about a worm belt buckle you know maybe I get a worm Bel Buckle Crimson worm Bel Buckle y'all really pray for me then will you but we struggle with our confidence but God is so mindful that look if you can't see yourself as an eagle how about a worm he's got something for you this morning you're insecure you know you know we we have so many shortcomings in our lives I I I I was I was coming across something uh actually it was at work uh our our supervisor that he gives a trivia every at the morning at our daily safety meeting and uh he said that there's uh uh two things that every one of us as human beings uh two fears that every one of us are born with yes there's no way around it you're you're born from birth every one of us no matter how good mama is no matter how good daddy is every one of us in this world we're born with two fears and that's falling and loud noises all your other fears and phobias are learned by uh happen stance and things that happen and scars and problems and all those different things but but innately we are born with a fear of falling and I and I Daron to say that that fear of falling continues to build and grow and morphs into all kind of different ways where we're afraid to fall and because we're afraid to fall we sit on the sidelines and we don't do what God told us to do amen because we let complexes and shortcomings and this happened and that happened and I did this and I did that and and you know what we go over and over and over and over and over again our Pastors in this town or in this state Oregon right now and this right here those are called the Oregon Oregon uh Trail ruts and that they were they were actually made by the Pioneers from 1843 to 1869 so so those Wagon Wheels went across mile after mile year after year and because they traveled that same road those ruts were made and now it's a monument but I wonder how many ruts do we have on the inside of us right and we travel over and over and over and over why do you do it why do I do it but I would have I wish I and you do we do discredit to the blood of God how are you supposed to move forward in life when you keep going over these same Pathways of life and it becomes so ingrained in our subconscious I'm no good I'm a failure I make so I make so many mistakes I do you know that is that is such brother Benham tells us this he says your right mental attitude towards God's Divine promise will bring any promise to pass now maybe you don't believe believe that you say well my faith is weak I wouldn't confess it amen don't let the devil know that always say I've got good [Applause] faith I believe God with all my heart see don't testify nothing of the devil and when when you accept him as your hither don't never act like you're sip or anymore prise God Amen believe that you're healed take him at his word then it's all over on God then and not on you brother Mike hello testimony right there hey now I I asked brother Mike test send him test brother Mike you need anything he said no I got my comb brother Mike looking good head boom right always he he turned in there that uh that hospital gwn for a suit right but it's because he had a confession and because he had a confession that body had to come subject to that confession but if we say oh make just stop being so negative the holy spirit is positive and you have to be positive you say brother Gabe I'm struggling with my faith all right I got one for you brother B says I see people get all worked up get nervous saying oh I wish I could you know why you go you you go Plum over the top of it you leave it behind you you you you're going out there excited trying to reach something that is right here before you just simple say thank you Father you promised it to me now I receive it that's all Watch What Happens now mean it in your heart just keep saying it over and over I I'm so thankful he said this if you don't believe it all together keep saying it until you do believe it just keep saying it over I thank you Lord for my healing cause what Christ is a high priest of our confession then he can only act when we confess it amen you said brother Gabe I I'm a worm praise the Lord yes just be the right one you know I don't see myself as an eagle okay well God God God has something special just for you can you see yourself as a worm look we don't need no artificial humility being humble and proud of it but some of us have insecurities some of us have complexes where we can't see ourselves as Eagles and listen hey that's okay because God made it so foolproof that he said if you can't see yourself as an eagle how about a worm amen amen start there yeah you said brother Gabe I just feel like so okay so you feel 5 to 7 millimet big perfect that's right perfect perfect it's great well I make so many mistakes and I I I I I know you can't get over it and it's just red as red can be perfect cuz red through red equals white yes you I I I got so many mistakes brother Gabe and I got so many problems and you know what you know there there is there is there is you know it's just as easy as simple as letting go if you're struggling with something this morning do you know that brother brandham taught us brother B taught us that uh uh you know uh I love I'm a city boy but I I I do know how I do have a few hunting tips for you this morning brother Ben where's your iPad at your notebook you you going to need this one brother this straight from the prophet brother Banner brother brandham uh brother brandham taught us that uh if if you're trying to catch a catch a raccoon he said uh he said he take a tree take a take a log that fell down where a raccoon had been running that tree that log and he said you you bore a hole in it and then you take nails and you drive them in this way and that way right and then he said he'd take a a tobacco tin and he would put a the shiny aluminum piece of the tobacco tin down in there and he said when it' be the Moonlight brother Ben you heard this one before huh y'all man I knew it I was hoping I was hoping I was hoping I get him man brother sh you heard this one before brother a man them North West virgan boys anyways stole my thunder brother but they they uh brother BR say you you you you take that log and then he said in the Moonlight that raccoon been running that and when that raccoon sees something shiny it's going to stop and it's going to put its hand in there there and grab that 10 and guess what happens when he grabs that 10 his hand is bigger than those Nails that's been driven in and now he can't get it out now all that raccoon would have to do is let go and if he could let go he could just pull his hand out but that that raccoon is not smart enough to do that but I dare s to say that you are this morning because sometimes Satan traps us with shiny things sometimes things get a hold of us or we get a hold of it and we panic and we think oh but listen it is just that easy don't let Satan put one over on you all you got to do is let go of it amen you said brother don't don't no no no don't give Satan more credit than what he is do that's right we are speaking of the blood of Jesus Christ this morning amen and Jesus he said he cast out Devils with the Finger of God yes so that's not even the hand of God just the finger that's how my he ain't worried about a devil and we ought not to be either all we have to do is let go you know it's so beautiful you know brother bam said that that uh whenever you whenever you repent you know he said he said all you have to do is um when you are forgiven in your heart I got it somewhere when he says when you when you're forgiven in your heart and you say Lord forgive me brother Brenham says your already forgiven the moment you're sorry brother Bron says the moment you're sorry in your heart you're already forgiven look I may have done something wrong and brother Manuel's over uh in in Congo and I can't get a hold of him he ain't got no sale reception and I'm texting away and and here I am panicking thinking he's got to get the text be you understand what I'm saying but there may not be any Sal service but you don't have to worry about whether they're Sal service or not because the prophet said the moment you're sorry in your heart you're already forgiven before God that's how God works that that the moment we can be not even vocalize it we realize we did something wrong and we're like oh our our heart is smoked within us the moment that happens and we say oh God why did I don't forget the moment that happens you young boys you young sisters the moment that happens you're already forgiven before God now brother Braham says you got to go make that right to be thoroughly repented but it's not like God's hanging over your head this carrot of forgiveness if you make it to this P but that's how is that how y'all perceive it sometimes am I the only one oh we got three people oh man praise the Lord y'all wow y'all are victorious okay well me and the other three people we struggle with that sometimes and the other 2 97 of you you pray for us you got plenty of time but but but that's why we have this message because it gives us courage when when when we can when we can look into God's Eternal Word we have to have confidence in what the word says about us but you but you know what no matter what no matter how much God forgives you look you have to accept it the the Bible tells us in Deuteronomy 176 that at the at the mouth of two witnesses or three witness shall he that is worthy of death be put to death but at the mouth of one witness yes he shall not be put to death so when you have done something that's worthy of death and Satan comes to cuz you know he's an accuser of the Brethren and Satan brings the accusation it does no good with only his witness but you know whose witness he needs he needs yours he needs another witness because the prophet told us God voted for you yes and Satan voted against you and now it depends upon where you put your vote if you say I'm unworthy and I'm all this and I'm listen stop stop stop you need to take inventory yes and you need to be honest with yourself and go wait a minute do I really believe God word or not because because just knowing about the Seven Seals and you know the seventh seal and what the fifth seal is and listen that's not going to help you if you got all these insecurities about what who you are you say brother Gabe but I've had I had a hard okay yeah you had a hard life I had too okay but what does that matter when it comes to God's word are you a believer of God's word or not and if you are a believer of God's word then you can go free am no matter what no matter what I don't care how bad it is I don't care look you want to you want to talk about somebody that had it bad you want to talk about somebody that had it bad it was Jaa God anybody know about Jaa Jaa ja that was in judges he was born the son of a harlot illegitimate he was under the Old Testament law excommunicated but then when they needed him they called him and he came back in and he won the victory he even messed up and said uh had said the Lord uh uh if you give me the victory whatever comes out of my house when I return I'll offer it for sacrifice and his daughter came out you want talk about messing up and and she was she was she was willing to be offered she said let me bewell my virginity for two months and for two months no doubt he waited no doubt wanting that Ram in the thicket but it never came but he was faithful to The Vow that he made to God and the amazing thing is is when it comes to the Hebrews of The Heroes of Faith in Hebrews 11 Paul would pin an illegitimate and remember they without us amen shall not be made perfect amen amen they it didn't say they except Jaa you know you know uh when I first when I first when I first got saved and I came to this message brother there's one quote where brother Bram talks about there's question asked about brother brandom does uh uh uh will a will IL illegitimate baby uh go in a Rapture and uh this brother the way he had presented it to me presented to me that if they was illegitimate there's no way they can be saved or they can be saved but there's no way they can be bride and uh and when that was presented to me I was a Youngster uh it it it terrified me and uh I I I'll be honest with you I uh cuz I don't I don't have to go very far to to to find that in my family tree and you know whenever he whenever he shared that quote with me I thought man maybe that's the reason why I got all the problems that I got maybe I'm illegitimate maybe that's the problem you know what I was so tormented by by that quote and the way that that Minister presented it to me that I called Mom and I was trying to ask her in a roundabout way and without you know then I called grandma grandma and she verified yes your mom and dad was married when you were born when yeah okay but you know what after I found that out guess what still had the same problems nothing magically faded away because I could prove cuz I could justify Myself by that quote right and and may maybe and you know uh maybe uh maybe you that quote still sticks to you but if you studied out I got about 66 or 6 62 pages of quotes and scriptures to go with it uh Moab and Ammon and amonites they they Moab and Amon they weren't even able to go into the Temple of the congregation forever illegitimate had to wait 14 Generations Moab and who is Ruth amen Ruth is a moabit yeah but but anyways not trying to go not trying to go that way but my point is jafa had some hard things against him but even though everything was counted against him when it's all said and done he's in Hebrews 11 with the Heroes of Faith amen amen and the Bible says they they they they without us shall not be that's including Jaa jaa's there and how if Jaa could have that kind of Faith under the blood of bus and goats what ought we to have if you do have some type of illegitimacy in your background because we are not saved by Blood and Bulls and ghats we're saved by the blood of God the almighty one that's right amen yes so by the way Jaa even his name Jaa means whom God sets [Applause] free amen I I just to to me friends all I'm trying to say is this no matter what you're struggling with today there is no excuse that you can't come Victorious today there's no reason for any one of us to leave this Sanctuary beat down tore down distracted whatever it may be there is no reason because even if you do only see yourself as something as little and insignificant as a worm God's mindful enough to have a type in Shadow just for you amen just to help you with your insecurities just to help you with your shortcomings and how little you feeling I can't see myself as a lamb I can't see myself as a lion I can't see myself as an eagle okay that's fine let's start with a worm and when you get the worm down you're going to get a little bit of Courage about you you're going to have a little bit you're going to go oh I'm a bloody worm I'm a crimson worm I can do that I can give my life I can do that too and then as you walk in this thing called life you'll mature and then you'll start seeing yourself as a lamb yes and guess what we'll all be waiting here for you till you change and transform and you get your wings and then you realize I am an eagle because listen we ain't going to leave until you get it right right and that's fine because the Saints of old had waited so many years for me I'm willing to wait for you and if I'm the one that's holding you back I hope you're willing to wait for me too because we have all got to get to the place where we stop living this beat down defeated life look the Bible tells us and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our own sins in his blood that washed means to be loosed and that's what the blood of the AL might he does it looses us amen it sets us free amen and we can be free indeed this morning do y'all believe that oh my but but the thing of it is we have to get past all you know and I'm I'm I know I'm at an hour 15 so I'm I'm I'm wind it up watch this you know you think about you think about speaking the word and I'm going don't look up stop reading stop reading but when we think about speaking the word I that's okay I I just to me I found this the other day came across it listening to the message and it was so beautiful to me that when brother brenham's talking about Moses speaking the word why you cry don't cry speak the word and go forward amen and and I want you to think about what type of a condition do you need to be in to speaking the word brother we got to be in Rapture condition to speak the word and go forward right that's a in our mind in our message mentality that's what we think we got to we got to be in condition brother speak the word we're heals well let's listen to the message and see what brother bam says about it because brother brandham tells us he said then the Lord said why you crying to me can commission I commission you to do it speak to the children that they may are go in the line of duty amen there you are don't cry out to me you're commissioned to take these people over there just speak to them that they go forward and stay straight in the path of Duty amen what a courage that ought to be for the sick person amen what what well hold on you in the back s you can't be speaking no there's a 90-day waiting [Music] period you got to wait three to five business days before you're holy enough after you repent that's weep that's how we think right we do something wrong and then we got that three to five waiting and it's business day so weekends don't count so if you can't say Amen say ouch I me don't tell me I'm the only one that got the three to five business days and you're like oh it's a holiday ah I can't speak the word sorry ah man boy there was a situation I could have nah it's not been long long enough yet no that's what we do up here and that is totally wrong that's right cuz we are message Believers right and and it's not your message that we you need to be believing it it's it's the message of Malachi 4 and so he tells us what a courage that ought to be for the backslider amen remember in prayer lines remember brother B said you need to repent now he said once you repent he said if if you stand up here and confess sin I'm going to call it out the Lord will call it out right but the moment they would confess there was no three to five business days there he says turn yourself around and start back stay in the line of duty it's God's business to open up the Red Seas it's God's business you just speak and move forward that's all you have to do am is just speak the word and go forward I am forgiven amen you can say it I am justified I never done it in the first place amen that's all on Satan he is My Sacrifice amen and you you may look at your path of life and and here's another one I came across it just blessed me so much brother brandom he's talking about he saved me when there were millions of others in sin he saved me for some reason they were educated there were smart men there were theologians there were Bishops and doctors and so forth in the field when he saved me but he saved me for some purpose and I see the word is the absolute and I'm tied to it determined to know nothing else but Jesus Christ and him crucified he had a reason for it and I'm determined to hold to that reason no matter what anybody else says I don't just fellowship with him discredit them but I know what I'm tied to he wanted me like this he had me like this I was made like that for a purpose I had to be made up of all these qualities and so forth all these no accounts so he could dig it out of me amen amen amen what see we look at our life and go why did this happen to me and why that and why why why it had to be that way amen you had to have all of those qualities within you so that God could dig it out of you and then put something in you which is his word amen praise God Amen so so the point of it is is I hope as it changes your focus to stop looking at your light your life as a negative and look at it and see that God is making it a positive all these no accounts and so forth so he could dig it out of me but we have to get past our thoughts and we can stand together and as we stand and close on this scripture musicians have become very familiar portion of scripture in Jeremiah 29:11 God says for I know the thoughts that I think towards you sath the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end and that expected end is actually speaking of a and it's that same Hebrew word that refers to the line of the Scarlet thread that when Rahab threw that expected end out the window it brought freedom and liberty it brought them Deliverance it brought them safety amen and this morning friends look we we are not just in this life hoping that uh you know Donald J Trump becomes the president so we can make it another four years we play something softly brother but we ought to realize that there's a Scarlet thread of redemption yes amen amen it was before your your life in your life and it's going to be after your life if God carries God knows the the thoughts that he thought of [Music] you you was tied with his thoughts of peace with his thoughts of redemption you say brother Gabe I I know I know but I struggle well so do I but I'm so thankful that one day when I was staring at a computer I clicked on a little [Music] worm and that little worm transformed my life you don't know the torment that I went through [Music] but I knew that this message was the only thing that was life and when brothers would present quotes to me and I didn't man I didn't know nothing I mean I was fresh off the streets I was a you think I'm a you think I got some ghetto in me now you should have seen me about 20 years ago [Music] but when I would read that quote and it was the way the man would present it to me and I thought man there's no hope for [Music] me sometimes we go you know the amazing thing is is God will allow those things to happen for years but it's just a Tri of your faith because then he'll show you something it'll lock everything and then you you'll look back and you go wait a minute how did I hold on and then you realize Ro it was it wasn't it wasn't you that was holding on it was God that was holding on to you brother all them years all those wasted hours and minutes why is it it's because this message is the only thing that's life and I couldn't understand it but I knew it was right and I look at my life and I see by God's grace I I see that Crimson thread and I see those thoughts that he thought to of me me they were thoughts of peace and not of [Music] evil and everything that we go through in life if you would really look at it it's molding you and shaping you for a purpose and I'll be honest with you when you catch that Revelation brother Mike it makes your life have such a a a solidity about it that you realize wait a minute I am in the hand of the Redeemer I do have that Scarlet thread wrapped around me and it and it gives you that quiet confidence that that though you may have a life of of Rahab the Harlot there was a line of a Scarlet thread that was let out and you was able to climb out of that old life [Music] amen ain't you thankful this morning when we didn't understand and we had confusion God God was faithful through it all when we when we went through life and all kind of problems and we had all kind of misunderstandings how many times did we misquote the prophet misinterpret the prophet and God was faithful through it all why because he was before you in you and after you because we are seed of David because we are not that worm of Decay and rot and death but we all come from that little Crimson [Music] worm that's why when he would call us a worm we would say yay Lord Oh Lord just let me be a worm You Know the Way Up Is Down am and if you can throw out your chest and see yourself as an eagle you needed this message this morning cuz when you look in the mirror you need to stop seeing the eagle you need to see yourself as a worm you got way too much pride about you and you brother sister that look at yourself and see yourself less as a worm you need to buckle up and get a little bit of Courage about you and shake off them complexes and go no yeah I'm a worm I'm GNA start there and then build up but don't live a defeated life we are called to live a Victorious life no matter how little and insignificant we may be there is no reason for us to live a defeated life if the Hubble if man can make a telescope that can look out millions of miles of of light years and and see all all these beautiful things and And when they see them and they put in they don't see the eye of God but we do they don't see a hand of God but we do they see a Red Ribbon in the Sky but we see a crimson streak why because we have prophetic Vision because we've had a prophet we are we are living in the in the days when these eyes have shined forth in the light of his word and if we can be simple enough and humble enough God will make this word live in ways that we never thought was possible if thou can't believe but you me we have to get past our thoughts we have to realize the thoughts that he thought of us was thoughts of Peace not of evil what we've been through in this life it was all molding and shaping us for a purpose but you got to rise above your past you got to lay hold of your future shake off the dust you know there my wife told me a story one time said there old farmer a farmer had uh had a horse and it fell in a hole the farmer had no way of getting that horse out and so the hor so the farmer looks at that horse and he grabs a shovel and just starts throwing dirt on it just going to bury the [Music] horse I think about Brother D right now this PA forck remember that the P forck anybody know what the pa forck is that's a bag you put over your shoulder and it's got a hole in it that whatever you got in there you throw it in that pffa sock brother Dan it tell me you throw that pffa sock remember that pffa sock he said he said when you going through something in life you got a pffa sock and you throw you throw whatever's in that bag and you throw that pffa sock over your shoulder cuz it falls out it falls out behind you and that's what that little horse did cuz that farmer gave up on the horse they said I'm just going to bury it do you know what that horse said uh-uh and so every time that farmer threw door on that horse you know what he did he shook it off and stomped on it listen Satan's trying to throw dirt on you today [Music] May th I know he threw dirt on some of us this [Music] week but how about we make a decision shake that dirt off and stomp on it and wait for the next shovel full to come our way and when it lands on us just don't let it lay there Shake It Off and stomp on it am little by little friends whatever hole you're in you're coming out and it's okay we'll wait on you cuz we ain't going to leave a hoof [Music] behind if there ever was an hour you old saints of God ought to be crying out for us little [Music] ones that we learn to shake off that dirt we learn to stomp on it cuz the faster we learn that lesson the faster we'll get out of here you believe that this morning let's bow our [Music] heads precious Lord just a simple little thought about a seemingly insignificant [Music] Worm but how beautiful your creation is and how mindful you are that that little a worm can go from Sand to stars as Seed of [Music] Abraham how magnificent your word truly [Music] is that man in all their science and when they're searching we're seeing [Music] Lord I'm I'm so thankful for the filter that's been given to us I pray that each [Music] one would be mindful to be looking through the filter Lord that we could see that Heavenly Scarlet thread of [Music] redemption or you know the needs of your people this morning I don't but I pray in the unfailing name of our Savior and Lord Jesus [Music] Christ that your great Holy Spirit would so sweetly walk the AIS and reason with us [Music] Lord that Scarlet stain of sin that's in our lives may seem so rooted 3800 years [Music] old but Lord let us this morning look at just one drop of that Eternal blood it divorces sin it annihilates it I pray Lord that this little thought would bring encouragement relieve the fear would fade and Faith would become preeminent Lord that we'd be able to rise and try again that we would shake off the dirt of this world and stomp on [Music] it I pray Lord that you'd be their portion this morning help us Lord to rise to deeper depths and higher Heights we commit all that we are into your hands and we ask these things to be so in the unfailing name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you appreciate [Music] you anybody need prayer be happy to pray with you brother John he has forgiv me my sins are all washed from his M by the blood of the Lamb of [Music] calary oh he he has forgiv me oh he has forg me my sins are all washed from his meory by the blood of the
