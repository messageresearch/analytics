[0:00] i know that if this body that's
[0:02] tabernacle gets laid down
[0:03] i know it will raise again in a
[0:05] glorified condition i know that but
[0:07] that's not what this quote is talking
[0:09] about
[0:09] amen they couldn't keep him in the grave
[0:11] amen what was it the romans the roman
[0:13] seal that was put upon that stone
[0:15] that could not keep him in the grave and
[0:18] that old roman seal of denominationalism
[0:20] that's come from the catholic church all
[0:22] the way down
[0:23] to every denomination every the
[0:26] and all the harlots the great mother
[0:28] and all her daughters
[0:30] protestant daughters have all got the
[0:32] same thing it's a roman seal but in this
[0:34] last day he broke the roman seal amen
[0:37] and the word came back in full
[0:40] manifestation
[0:42] and they couldn't keep him in the grave
[0:43] and neither can they keep us in the
[0:45] grave of dark denominationalism
[0:48] why because the sun is up
[0:51] [Music]
[0:53] amen it's shining in full brightness
[0:56] it's pooling the seed to full life to
[0:58] bring all the full fruit out amen
[1:01] praise be to god i'm telling you if this
[1:04] doesn't get you excited
[1:06] i would go to my knees and say god
[1:07] you've got to wake something up inside
[1:09] of me
[1:10] because this is the message this is the
[1:12] heart this is the revelation of god's
[1:14] one goal
[1:14] god's one purpose one thought one
[1:17] achievement he wanted to achieve
[1:18] and all the acts in the bible and the
[1:20] character was all coming to paint one
[1:22] picture
[1:23] and this is the picture friends this is
[1:25] the second part of that picture
[1:27] it's god's great heart purpose from
[1:29] before the foundation of the world to
[1:30] have a bride after his own choosing
[1:32] and if this preaching does not move
[1:34] something in you get on your knees and
[1:36] cry out to god and say god
[1:37] awaken something in me
[1:42] this is why once you've seen the message
[1:44] once you've seen christ
[1:46] in all his resurrected glory and he's
[1:48] awakened you by the baptism of the holy
[1:49] ghost
[1:50] you can never go sit in a church again
[1:52] and listen to an easter message that
[1:54] talks about
[1:54] 2000 years ago and that's all that no
[1:57] it's today friends
[1:58] his plan is still unfolding today christ
[2:01] is alive today
[2:02] the resurrection is today
[2:04] [Applause]
[2:06] that's why although the the the preacher
[2:09] may say
[2:09] nothing incorrect he may say nothing
[2:11] wrong the resurrection message is a true
[2:14] message
[2:14] and all that was purchased and all that
[2:16] was accomplished at calvary and all that
[2:18] was accomplished on the third day is all
[2:19] true
[2:20] and he can speak all the truth but it
[2:22] doesn't move you
[2:23] like this revelation moves you because
[2:26] all that truth has
[2:27] moved to today all that was there
[2:30] is alive today moving in its people
[2:34] stirring them amen filling them with the
[2:37] spirit to be witnesses of this
[2:39] resurrection this day that's
[2:42] who he ordained that's who he called in
[2:44] this day
[2:45] that's who he showed himself to
