[0:00] Brother Bram, now all the way back in
[0:02] 59, he's turning us back to the
[0:04] congregation and he's saying Jesus says,
[0:06] "As it was in the days of Sodom, so
[0:09] shall it be." Amen. In the revealing of
[0:11] the Son of Man. And now, Brother Brham's
[0:13] going to turn us back and show the same
[0:14] sign that was shown. Amen. Uh on the
[0:17] plains that day, he's going to show the
[0:19] same sign. And he says, "Now you discern
[0:21] what spirit this is."
[0:24] &gt;&gt; MANY WALKED AWAY and said, "That man's
[0:26] fanatical. I mean, that that that's
[0:28] mental telepathy. That's what whatever
[0:30] they went away and whatever it was that
[0:32] they believed. Amen. But there was a few
[0:34] there that said that's God.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; That's the SCRIPTURE BEING FULFILLED.
[0:38] THAT'S not just A MIRACLE. THAT'S NOT
[0:40] JUST A SIGN. THIS IS WHY BROTHER
[0:42] BRANDHAM SAID, "I WOULDN'T FOLLOW OIL IN
[0:44] THE HANDS or blood in the hand or oil on
[0:46] YOUR FOREHEAD." THERE WAS ALL KINDS OF
[0:48] PEOPLE that raised up brother after
[0:49] brother Brandham and they had all kinds
[0:51] of signs. Amen. They the AA Allen had
[0:54] them and there was other men that had
[0:55] signs and they would they would get into
[0:57] the spirit or they would call a woman up
[0:59] ONE TIME AND SHE WOULD HAVE OIL IN her
[1:01] hands of and then that oil would be
[1:02] anointing oil that would heal people and
[1:04] they would pray for him. Brother
[1:06] Brandham said I wouldn't believe that
[1:07] sign.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; SO WHY WERE THEY WHY WHY IS THE BRIDE OF
[1:12] CHRIST SUPPOSED TO BE ACCEPTED? Brother
[1:13] Brandham turning his back to a crowd and
[1:15] discerning people and say you over here
[1:17] in the red dress you've got cancer. You
[1:19] over here you've got a BACK PROBLEM. WHY
[1:21] NOT believe the oil in the hand? Why not
[1:23] believe the blood in the hand? Why not
[1:24] believe the oil on the forehead? AMEN.
[1:26] THEY'RE ALL SUPERNATURAL SIGNS AND THEY
[1:28] WERE VINDICATED. THEY WERE VERIFIED.
[1:30] THERE'S PEOPLE TESTIFIED IT WAS TRUE AND
[1:31] were healed by it.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY BROTHER BAM SAID HE
[1:35] WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT? HE SAID BECAUSE
[1:36] IT'S NOT IN THE WORD. THE SCRIPTURE
[1:38] NEVER TELLS US TO LOOK FOR THAT. BUT
[1:40] JESUS SAID, "AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF
[1:42] LOT IN THE DAYS OF SODOM, SO SHALL IT BE
[1:44] IN THE revealing of the SON OF MAN."
[1:46] WHAT WAS DONE TO ABRAHAM AND HIS SEED IN
[1:48] THAT day is the same sign that's coming
[1:50] back to Abraham and his seed this day.
[1:52] AND THE ELECT OF GOD SAY THAT AIN'T
[1:54] NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; THAT WORD IS TODAY. WHAT WE SAW IS WHAT
[2:00] JESUS SAID AND OUR HEARTS PUT THE TWO
[2:02] TOGETHER AND SAY AMEN. THAT'S WHAT HAD
[2:05] WRIGHT WAS ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THEOLOGY,
[2:08] WITHOUT INTELLECTUALISM, without a
[2:10] degree.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; HOW ARE WE ABLE TO do it? HOW DO YOU
[2:14] KNOW WHAT PROOF? WHAT EVIDENCE? IT'S
[2:16] MORE THAN JUST SEEING A MAN MAKE
[2:18] DISCERNMENT. AMEN. YOU CAN SEE ALL KINDS
[2:20] OF SIGNS AND WONDERS. YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE
[2:21] DO ALL KINDS OF STUFF. BUT WHAT IS IT?
[2:24] THERE'S SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART THAT
[2:25] SAYS THAT'S NOT JUST A MAN DOING A
[2:27] MIRACLE. THAT'S A THAT'S THE FULFILLMENT
[2:29] OF SCRIPTURE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT GOD
[2:31] PROMISED FOR THIS HOUR. THAT IS THE WORD
[2:34] FOR OUR DAY BEING MADE MANIFEST.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; And it ain't nothing but the truth.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; OH, DO YOU THINK THAT PLEASES GOD? IF IT
[2:44] PLEASED GOD WHEN HAD HE COULD DECLARE,
[2:45] "WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOUR HEART LEAPS UP AND
[2:47] SAYS,"I KNOW IT'S TRUE. I KNOW THAT'S
[2:49] THE SIGN OF THE MESSIAH. I KNOW THAT'S
[2:51] MY LORD JESUS CHRIST DOING." THAT'S NOT
[2:53] THAT, MAN. THAT'S GOD FULFILLING HIS OWN
[2:56] WORD AND SHOWING TO THE SEED OF ABRAHAM,
[2:58] "HE'S HERE."
[3:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:01] &gt;&gt; I love it. I love to have the privilege
[3:04] to say, "That's nothing but the truth."
[3:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
