[0:00] but you're this and you're that that's
[0:02] not what's laying under the seals for me
[0:04] mr devil
[0:07] but you're this and you were born of
[0:08] that and you've always done that but
[0:10] that's not what was revealed under the
[0:13] mystery to me amen when the seals opened
[0:16] to me i saw my name in the book i heard
[0:19] my name called i recognized i was part
[0:21] of this mystery from before the
[0:22] foundation of the world and you say i'm
[0:25] a washout you say i'm a hypocrite you
[0:28] say i'm no good you say i'm defeated but
[0:30] i say i'm part of this mystery
[0:33] my revelation i can no more be lost and
[0:36] god can be lost because i was with him
[0:38] before the foundation of the world i've
[0:40] come from god i'm going to god by a
[0:42] revelation that was laying under the
[0:44] seals for me
[0:46] [Applause]
[0:47] i tell you that's the testimony that
[0:49] will bring him down friends that and
[0:51] that alone is the revelation in the
[0:53] testimony of the bride that will cast
[0:55] him down not saying i was sick and now
[0:57] i'm healed the pentecostals can do that
[1:00] there's got to be something more amen
[1:02] something when brother branham came to
[1:03] the seals in 1963 he says what we got
[1:06] now he had a restoration of the gifts
[1:08] had a tying together of loose sins had
[1:10] an explanation of the church ages but
[1:12] there's got to be a deeper mystery
[1:15] to bring you rapturing faith so that you
[1:17] can fly above all these denominations
[1:19] and fly above all of this to where you
[1:21] can get into the real revelation above
[1:24] amnesia above all of this stuff so you
[1:26] can fly so high you can say i remember
[1:29] where i came from
[1:30] [Music]
[1:34] but you're that no no no no no that was
[1:36] on my birth certificate that's just
[1:37] flesh that's not who i am
[1:41] do you remember when you did this and
[1:43] you remember when you did that remember
[1:45] when you said that oh you say but that's
[1:47] now i've been washed by the water of the
[1:49] word all the filth and everything's been
[1:51] washed away from me i've been redeemed
[1:53] amen the redeemer has come he's not
[1:56] still back there redeeming now he's here
[1:58] claiming and i'm part of what he claimed
[2:01] [Music]
[2:02] he was there redeeming redeeming through
[2:05] seven churches redeeming but when he's
[2:07] done redeeming in the last church ages
[2:09] now he steps forth to take the book and
[2:11] claim what he's redeemed now it's the
[2:13] claiming ministry
[2:17] and guess who he claimed mr devil
[2:20] he claimed me
[2:22] not by what i've done
[2:24] or not done
[2:26] but by a revelation
[2:28] that came at the opening of those seals
