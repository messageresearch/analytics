========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm so glad you're able to come gather around the family of sister nancy with the children and grandchildren remember the life of my dear brother john tomorrow it's a privilege to have known our brother to be able to say a few words on his behalf to remember a life that god and also to give our love and support for the families who appreciate it all meaningless i'd like to begin by reading the scripture of the psalms 1 16 15 it says precious in the sight of the lord is the death of the saints that word precious means of great value and uh i was reflecting on that scripture so commonly read at a memorial services funeral but i thought about on january 22nd early in the morning on that day there were two people who were not disappointed our lord and our brothers so we're thankful that we know that our brother had a great reward awaiting him after this time i'd like to read the obituary at this time this is john w morrow said tim born september 10 1930 died january 27 2002. john rivera 1891 of lyman passed away at 5 45 am saturday january 22nd 2022 at saint pete's medical center he was born september 10 freeport illinois to the late raymond

about my brother john and then we're going to ask zach and brittany levy if they want to come on up and they can start you guys can go ahead and make your way up now they're going gonna share some thoughts and some memories and then we'll have a few others from family and some friends that's different i'm so sorry i've lost my voice and i'm not really sure why this week has been pretty rough so i think it's just satan attacking us but we are very grateful to have you all here and to be with me ma and it's [Music] i don't know if many of you know but we call john pipa and that's just kind of how he's always been to us to say people on so many words would be he wasn't the most affectionate person but he did have his way of showing love and one of the last things that he ever gave me i was in the hospital with him and i was holding his hand and he told me he loved me for the first time in my life he showed ways of loving you but he wasn't mushy gushy and it was kind of one of those things that he gave me personally and i really appreciate that and i will hold that for forever but i was looking across and realizing he gave us something so much more than any earthly possession he could have given us he brought us to this message if it wasn't for him he gave us eternity he gave us the lord and without that we'd be lost so yes we didn't get all the lovey-dovey hugs and you know doting grandpa but he gave me something that'll last eternity and i look out and i see our family and he gave that to me more i never thought i would see our family together in church my husband's standing next to me he gave us one last gift and that's something i'll hold forever we love him and we we will miss him but the one thing he held on so strong for was mima he wanted to know that she was loved and taken care of and look at all the people she's surrounded by and i think he knew that she was okay so it was okay for him to let go we take this life for granted and you don't realize in a twinkling of an eye what god gives you and what you're missing when it's taken away so i just really appreciate everything that he's done even though i would have loved more memories with him he's given me something so much more and far greater and that's my soul that's jesus and i can't wait to see him on the other side brother chad had said something that the little glimpse that we saw when he would let you in is how he'll be over there in fullness in the day that i see his heart completely open with no pain no suffering no hurt holding him back what a joy that will be so i'm eternally grateful for everything that he's given us he will be missed but meemaw's very loved and we appreciate everything that you guys have done for us so thank you go ahead it was kind of weird for me i never thought i'd be standing up here so um they didn't even really ask me they just kind of told me i was coming up here so this'll be interesting i was at work the other day and i was trying to think about what i was going to say and i saw this uh facebook one of those facebook quizzes it was like uh you know what car would you be if you were a car or something like that and said what candy would you be my first thought for john was a sour patch kid because first you're sour and then you're sweet and that kind of summed up john when i knew him because when we first got married we moved into the apartment up above john and nancy and they have a decent sized yard and i had a push mower and it broke down and asked john if i could use one of his many mowers and he said no you'll probably break it all right so i think i went to my parents and i borrowed theirs and i brought it over and i was out there pushing mowing the yard and it was hot and i wasn't too happy and i see john come out and he hops on his riding lawn mower and he comes puttering out towards me and i'm like oh cool you know like this is our connection we're gonna he's gonna let me borrow his mower he pulls right up shuts it off and says make sure you get over there and don't hit my uh my sign over there and blah blah blah okay and then he hop back on his mower and he drove back and parked it next to all of his other mowers so that was kind of my situation with him at that time we went down to have dinner one time and i think nancy tried to sneak some moldy bread into the trash can that had gone bad and john found it and he said well there's nothing wrong with this blah blah blah blah and he started just cutting off the moldy bread i told britney so i'm not eating that bread she said no we're we're not going to eat that but that was the john i knew and then we ended up moving away and then when we moved back he was a lot different he was still not very outgoing and cheerful but he was like in small ways like he'd come up he'd ask how i was doing and he'd talk to me britney said i think he likes you i said what makes you think that she said well he normally wouldn't do that so i said all right i guess that's we finally made it but uh he really connected more with the kids that was kind of the weirdest thing was one of the last times we were there i think it was christmas uh he came sat down and ellie walked right up to him she says hey and he looks at her and she says i got some new barbies you want to see them and he goes oh okay and she sat there for probably 10 minutes just telling him all about her barbies i don't think he understand a word she said but he just smiled nodded the whole time so starting out we didn't exactly have the most wonderful relationship but then after moving on it was kind of nice to see he changed and was a lot sweeter to everyone and stuff so but i know he's gonna be missed everybody's here but um like they say he's in a better place now and everyone should just be happy for him so that's all i got praise the lord i'll never think the same thoughts when i eat a sour patch kid again i will think of her brother john because it was a fairly accurate description amen at this time we're going to ask jonathan moore if you want to come on up another one of the grandchildren he'd like to share some thoughts as well good morning everyone it has been a long time since i've been up here you guys are all like family to me i remember 15 years ago i standing right there singing in the choir i'm gonna try to keep myself together up here it's not going to be a few tears it's going to be a blizzard so but i'll uh i'll dry him away and i'll move on because that's what he did that's where he's at john and nancy are my grandparents and when i was a child probably a toddler the meemon people actually stemmed from me i decided to call them meemaw just one random day and it stuck and then people came about and it it's been like that ever since as we got older we're like you know it's a little childish now it was it was a childhood thing we can call them grandma and grandpa but it's time to bring that back again people actually saved my life when i was a toddler as well so for me to be here standing here talking to him is a great great thing i will cherish and there's no telling what what else i have to offer and what god has to offer me but he saved my life i happened to be in a crib and me mom people were babysitting me one day and they called me a little stinker because i kept growing so fast that every time they turned around i was doing something they weren't aware of so i couldn't walk yet and i guess before they realized that i was standing up in the crib and i happened to reach for some very heavy clothing uh that had some plastic around it maybe dry cleaners or something and i had pulled it down on top of me and i was almost smothered but people came and he pulled it off of me and meanwhile told me that story that he saved my life so like i said for today to be standing here is a joy in remembrance of him people also taught me how to play skit bow when i was a kid he loved that game and he taught just about every single one of us and he was a stubborn old man but he was a good stubborn old man think about the frustration he got when trying to teach us how to play skit bow as kids seven years old and slamming down the card that's not how you do it and we're just kids but we ended up getting it and i've when i was here about 15 years ago we played a game played a few actually i lived with him again and i'll never forget it i never will if you don't mind i like to read a passage from the bible i just felt like i needed to for our family and for myself second corinthians chapter 3 and 4 blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort who comfort us who comforteth us in our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted by god i'm going to love him for the rest of my life and we will be here with nemo and the rest of the family to take care of her and i hope that he watches over her just as we will and god will if i may i'm going to pray dear heavenly father i stand here today before you by your hand and possibly people's hand lord you followed him to save my life and to be standing here today in your honor and his honor i love you so much father and i love people so much i ask that you guide me guide our family and guide me ma comfort her and warm her heart and take care of everybody as we move forward in our lives and hopefully get closer to you lord one step at a time i thank you so much for everything father he's standing there with you today right now happy and i thank you for that in jesus precious name amen thank you at this time we're going to ask for the keith and sister lee if you guys would make your way up they have some comments and some memories they'd like to share and brother keith and sister lee have been very very close and very special friends sister nancy and brother john and been a great help to them and have been a great help to sister nancy this last week so we really appreciate them god bless you good morning everyone um try to keep it somewhat short but we've got some notes here we want to share some memories and things with john and with nancy um i i i praise the lord for the people he brings into our lives and the journey he takes us on and john and nancy are two of those people that we count very special it's been a blessing in our lives through the years um there's too too many memories to share too many little stories and things but we did i've jotted down a couple and i know lee's got a few things she'd like to say but i was thinking back to you know last saturday after john had passed and i was thinking myself i said he was 91 and it kind of reminded me back to when we first moved here that's my first memory of john you know we had a couple moving trucks of all our stuff and we had driven from omaha when i had retired out of the air force and we show up here and there's a multitude of men who showed up to help us unload our vehicle and john was one of those and it's the first time i met him and boy he was just right there just up moving grabbing and like i said last saturday when i was thinking about it looking back at that when he was doing that he was he was 74 years old and i think about that now and it's like yeah i would have never guessed he was john was one of the strongest men i've ever known in my life he was just a tower i mean just string and even a week ago right before he passed when we were in the hospital there he could feel it in his hands sitting there holding his hands he was such a strong man but um and then you know he helped us unload the truck and then i don't know how long much longer when we finally bought our house he was right there to help move everything into the house and set everything up that was john's i'll say one of his unspoken strengths he loved to help he loved to serve people behind the scenes you know it's been mentioned he was not real personable and things but he was always there he could always be counted on to do and again with his strength he could do a lot um but his willingness to serve was it just is always evident through the years and over the years you know um we had the great privilege of becoming very close with john and nancy bonding through many different things and again being here doing family camps and camping trips and things we just we really began to bond and become very close to john and nancy and all during those times along the way john would always share his faith and his belief and trust in the lord and it was always so evident you could always find him reading his bible talking with the lord talking about the lord and this was a wonderful blessing like you know jonathan was sharon and the grandchildren brittany that's a lot of his legacy right there witnessing and bringing the word to his family and to others and i'm i'm thankful um he also expressed his thankfulness to the lord uh for that gift of revelation that he that the lord gave him which he's given all of us to be able to see the lord and this end time message that we all you know do not take for granted it's a true blessing over the years there's been a lot of different things that he's helped me with and you know being his camp director and stuff john could always be counted on to help he was always there to do things but one of the one memory i wanted to bring out is he helped us out with a we were doing a dinner and things that the bible believers christian school and it was a play and a dinner and everything and and there was a lot going on and i can remember john and i in the kitchen after the dinner daring to dinner and everything else washing dishes and it was he and i standing over this sink just washing and rinsing and drying these dishes and when we got through is a long day but we got he was right there the whole time and again i'm just thinking about you know he was not a young man and but he's right there we figured it up and got done we washed hand washed over 3000 dishes just the two of us and that's one of the memories i have of him and you know john had a sense of humor that some people didn't you know a lot of times you didn't see it but i don't know lee's gonna expand on but i'll never forget one morning we get a text so earlier saturday morning we get a text comes on the phone it says fire in elida and it's just like you know at first we get panicked thinking oh my gosh john is john nancy's house is on fire and we weren't sure what to do we're still in our pajamas and we text uh john and said well you know call 9-1-1 do no no no get to the house right now uniform of the day your pjs okay so we get to the house and uh waiting for us is a campfire in their backyard with coffee and breakfast and uh one of many saturdays it became a tradition but that was him he was so different when it came to his sense of humor and we had to learn that and but he was so sweet he didn't show it the way um i guess we're taught to show sweetness and diplomacy and it came out in in ways that he just complimented me some things he did he would call us at work and we'd worked all day and we'd work hard and he'd say how about bean soup and cornbread for supper that man made the best bean soup i've ever had and it was very much appreciated we loved it but john and i had a relationship that we were able to spend hours on the road talking john went to the va hospital in dayton almost once a month and during that time he often would discuss how it was a miracle that a hurricane blew them up here to be at bcf how blessed he was to have a teacher and brother lonnie and he always wanted to talk about the last teaching that brother lonnie would would have and so our trip there was spent with john talking about that and then after the appointment we'd always go to cracker barrel and piqua and i wasn't going to bring this up but i'm going to bring this up he could not stand to waste anything and he would order his meal and i'd order mine and he always bought my meal and i always ate half my meal he ate all his meal and he'd stare at my meal that's sitting there and one day he just reached over with his fork and took part of my meal and i thought well he bought it i guess okay he can and i just looked at him and he goes what and i said nothing that was my meal he said well you're just letting it sit there and i said well i was going to have it for tomorrow's lunch and he goes oh i'm sorry it was just funny how he would you know do little things but uh after um our lunch we would always go to this jewish cemetery that's behind cracker barrel and piqua and there is when he we would walk around before our trip home and we'd walk around there and that would springboard him into a conversation of how the lord is continually moving and how we need to stay with that movement and that's a part of john that not many people got to see he was a private and serious person he didn't share a whole lot i feel it was an honor i'm grateful to known john but what i'm most grateful for is his gratefulness to recognize what the lord did in his life he saved his life he would often tell me he would say he'd be dead or in prison if it weren't for the lord he was afraid of the old john he knew the old john would surface from time to time and he battled with that old spirit daily and every day we're told to die of ourselves and john knew that old self would surface up so we fervently prepared for battle every morning i didn't really know that until we would stay with them in those evenings john's bedtime was 5 00 p.m um so in the middle of my night when i'm going to the restroom that was the beginning of his day and that could be 3 30 a.m but he had trouble sleeping and he had some hearing loss so when i would get up in the middle of the night there he would be preparing for the battle he would be putting on the full armor of god he'd sit in his chair he had his bible open he would be weeping he never knew that i got to see him in those moments because he didn't he couldn't hear me and i would watch him it wasn't a casual devotion it wasn't perfunctory he was preparing because he knew that old spirit that devil wanted him to lose his testimony and he knew he had to prepare he tried that enemy tried to overshadow his mind and that wicked spirit did win some battles but in the end [Music] the war has been won by christ that christ that lived in john and i know we all face that in our own way but john is a symbol of the victory we all want and to all of you john's family thank you for sharing him with us we love you all i just want to um relate one last little story it's got a little bit of humor and um not too long ago you know john liked to collect a lot of things and he had a lot of trouble getting rid of some of those things and nancy had talked with him and talked with me and i don't know what it was but my relationship with john i've been told i was the only one who could have done this and i was here and i spent i don't know how many days it was but cleaning up his barn sorting out things getting rid of a lot of stuff and during that time and it was very hard for john it really was but the lord showed himself very powerful during that time that john was able to get through it and as we're doing these things just a couple days prior to starting this john had a skin cancer removed on the shoulder so he had i don't know how many stitches are in his shoulder but he still had a big bandage and things but again john being the way he was he wanted to try to help and be out there and things but i'm like you can't because i don't want to see you hurt yourself and we were having an issue with the trailer hitch and stuff and i'm busy in the barn also and i happened to look over and here's john was 90 years old laying on the ground underneath his van with the thing trying to cut the trailer hitch lock loose and and i'll never forget like i said john was a force to be reckoned with and i kind of walked over there and i got kind of stern with him i said stop stop that right now and he looked up at me and i said you're not doing this get up and he's just kind of looking at me you know and so i held my hands down there and i of course i had to help him up and that was quite the chore because he's so much bigger than i was but i got him up and i said you're not doing this you're going to tear up your shoulder and i'll take care of all this stuff and he's just kind of looking at me and not very fun i said i was wearing my retired air force hat i had my stripes on there and i said you see this says master sergeant you know sergeants are in charge so i'm telling you right now your job for the day is to get in that house and take it easy and he just kind of looked at me and so i'm helping him and we're walking towards the house and you know he reached over and he i'm kind of supporting him and he's got his arm around me and like brittany said it's not something you hear very often but he looked at me as i'm walking him to the house just got done scolding he goes i love you and it's something you didn't hear him say and i'll cherish that because i know he meant it and his strength is faith faith especially his faith in his unspoken love is something that i'll cherish i uh i lost my father at a very young age and there's not been too many men in my life that i've had looked up and have respect and love for as a father and john was one of those he was just always there for you and you needed a hand he was would be there to the end and i counted a deep privilege and pleasure to have known him um [Music] we'll mourn him for the loss of his company but i celebrate his life and as you know we will see him again and the next time i see him i'm not going to recognize him because he's going to be such a young man but i just know count on that and again as lee said we counted a great privilege that we've known john and nancy we love them dearly and nancy we will always be here for you anything you need and the rest of the family and we it's been a true privilege to been part of his life we love you amen i appreciated hearing from the family and from friends and hearing about brother john's life i really loved brother john we had some good discussions and as he got older and he wasn't attending church anymore i always missed his amen because the last few years of his life his hearing wasn't good so he had a headset on and they would franklin amy would broadcast the service into his headset so he could hear it better so he got the signal just a little bit later than everybody else so his amen was really pronounced because it was always just a step behind everybody else's and boy that was an encouragement to me it was like amen amen praise god and so when he wasn't able to come to service anymore i really missed that delayed amen from our brother john but god's been good to him and god has been good to us i just want to look at a couple scriptures as reflect on our brother's life the first one i'd like to read is out of john john chapter 14 verse 19 it says yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live you shall live also. we know that our life is in christ and if he lives we live also and god in christ lived the word lived before we had life on this earth so it means we had life before we had life on this earth we had true life while on this earth not just life that we get from breathing oxygen out of the air in and out of lungs we have more life than that because he lives and when we go beyond this natural life when we no longer breathe and take in oxygen and expel oxygen we still have life because because he lives we live also that is the root of our life the the book of colossians says in chapter 2 and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses so there was a time in this natural journey in life when we were dead in sins and and dead is unique term in the bible because it says you were dead in your sins but yet you were very much alive in this earth with an earthly life you were alive but you were dead because you were dead in your sins but he has quickened you together with christ having forgiven you all trespasses and the prophet of god teaches us a principle in the fourth seal he says now death means eternal separation from god remember now saints don't die so brother grantham is giving us a better definition of death because we as human beings we look at death as the end of human life we look at life at the beginning of human life and death at the end of human life but to god life is more than that this life that we live here is actually a shadow of life and the eternal the real death the real ultimate death is eternal separation from god so while we were in this life and we were animated we were living we were breathing we were doing things we were dead in our sins we were separated from god but there come a time that god come knocking on our door and through our faith in christ he reconciled us back to god bringing us from death unto life we were living the whole time we would say as the common definition of life is but god is teaching us that no we were alive but we were dead when we come in contact with the living word we move from death unto life to our real life and that is the life that can never fail fall away or be extinguished the book of john in the gospel of john chapter 11 there's a story about jesus and his friend lazarus and lazarus is sick and he and jesus gets a message from lazarus sister saying your friend lazarus is sick and jesus delays his departure to go to him and beginning in verse 11 it says these things said he and after that he said sayeth unto them our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep then said jesus unto them plainly lazarus is dead so jesus made the correct statement lazarus sleepeth but because they're thinking carnal thoughts in a human life they don't understand they think oh he's doing good he's asleep he's resting now he'll recover and so jesus had to use language that they would understand no lazarus is dead what you understand to be dead he's dead but jesus already told us he was asleep because saints can't die they only rest the prophet of god said in the message blind bartimaeus many of us now many of us uh now is up past that youthful age and we must pass on someday into a better life and a better world it is it is not hard to think that i'm so glad that i know that to be the truth that's what my heart yearns to get to tell people the bible truth that i know that after this life is over we have a life that's far beyond this this is only the shadow or the negative that after the death develops the picture when we pass from this mortal to immortality we change this old worn out body for a body that'll never get old you know there was a time in all of our lives but a time especially for our brother john that he was dead in his sins but god knew that down inside of him was the seed of eternal life that could never die so what god had to do is he had to come wake up john to who john really is john was dead to who he was he was his knowledge was darkened to who he really was and where he came from and and why he was on earth and what his life was all about he was dead to that realization his his whole understanding was darkened to that truth so there was a time that god had to come and interrupt his life with a voice and that voice was the voice of the resurrection amen to call a sleeping john out of his sleep to wake him up and quicken him to the life that was inside of him and john though he was walking as dead as we were walking as dead there was a voice of a resurrection he heard in that day and that voice called him out of his deep sleep and brought him into life and and we know that because of that there's a promise that john has representation in heaven because this life is a reflection this is the negative that is the positive so if there was a john here as a son of god then he's got a life a body that goes beyond this one he is a body eternal in the heavens as ii corinthians 5 tells us for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life and the message things that are to be brother benham says now remember these are only temporal gifts in type now we know that moses in building the tabernacle in the wilderness are preparing it he said he made all things after the order of what he saw in heaven see so the earthly things only express what the eternal things are and if this earth that we live in today being so great as we love it we love to live and to breathe the air and see the flowers and things if if this here is the expression one that's dying is only expressing one that's eternal when you see a tree struggling pulling trying to live that means there's a tree somewhere that doesn't have to do that when you see a man here struggling to live somebody in a hospital or on a sick veteran accident struggling and the death rattle is in the throat and pulling and crying and screaming for life what does that mean there's a place somewhere there's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that it just doesn't do it now they are temporal gifts to us these things only express that there is one where it's the eternal one that's what jesus has gone away to prepare the eternal one for us now they only express there's a greater of the same kind because these are a same kind i think i think britney maybe it was the one who was expressing in others as well how you know there was there was uh you could maybe say uh maybe a definition or a way of describing john would be there was a crust or a shell on the outside of john but there was a real tender heart on the inside and and you see a man as uh sister lee was describing a man who so much was struggling to live the life of christ and not live the old life but live under the inspiration of the spirit in that struggle you realize our brother's struggle is over now he no longer needs an early morning devotion to prepare himself for the battle that lays ahead he is free amen he is free from the curse of hybridization he's free from the bondage of of old pain and old old things that happen to them he is completely free now to be what he always wanted to be and he's free to live the life he's always wanted to live you see so many times we see uh we see things that we don't understand you know if somebody's in a terrible accident and they're disfigured and mangled and and they they have twisted limbs or missing limbs and you see that person and you have sympathy for them because you understand that they're limping in life or struggling but sometimes those same accidents take place in the emotional realm and they leave scars and they leave wounds and they leave things amen that we carry with us for life amen but that's not who we really are that's the effect of things that have happened to us but who john really was was that sweetness that popped out that began to come out and that desire he had to do for others and and all of those things that was the the real john and i'm so glad that our brother is free from all the pain and all the heartache and discomfort and pains and and old age and all of the things he's so free from his greatest enemy his greatest enemy was the body that he lived in and now our brother is free from that and he lives amen i i want to read just a couple more scriptures but there's one in matthew where jesus is correcting a wrong understanding of of the sadducees they don't believe in a resurrection and they're they're asking him a hypothetical question if a man has a wife and he's married and has no children and he dies and she has a brother and he takes her to wife no children seven times in the resurrection whose wife will she be and jesus just doesn't even answer the question because he tells him you don't understand the scriptures he says you do air not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god for in the resurrection they neither married or are given in marriage but are the angels but are as the angels of god in heaven but as touching the resurrection of the dead have you not read that which was spoken unto you by god saying i am the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob god is not the god of the dead but of the living and when the multitude heard this they were astonished at this doctrine jesus refers to something they all understood in the old testament that he's the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and they repeated that many many times in their life but they didn't catch the deeper meaning of that and jesus brought it to them he says you're worried about the dead and the resurrection of the dead hey but god is not the god of the dead he's the god of the living if you're dead he's not your god if you're alive he's your god he's the god of the living he was currently the god of abraham he didn't say he was the god of abraham he is the god of abraham and i don't think we can leave here this morning and say i want to serve the same god that john served but i want to serve the same god that john is still serving because he's not dead he's not god of the dead but he's god of the living i i don't want to serve i don't want to come in contact with the same god that john came in contact with i want to serve the same god that john is still in contact with because he's still alive our brother is not dead the prophet of god goes on to say further in things that are to be if we had to just stay in this kind of body aren't you glad there's such a thing as death the prophet of god is going to say something totally different than i've heard anybody else say but when he said it it so resonated with me is true so isn't that strange you might now say for instance a few years ago i was a little boy and now i'm a middle-aged man and i got a friend sitting here mr dow and he's 93 years old a few days ago look at him now 40 or 45 years more that would be me now put another 40 years on him where would you go i'm glad that there's something to get us out of this pest house there's an open door and it's called death jesus stands in that door amen he'll guide me over the river he'll take me through the door there's a great door standing yonder called death and every time your heart beats you're one beat closer to it and someday i must come to that door you must come there but when i come there i don't want to be a coward i don't want to scream and back off i want to come to that door wrap myself in the robes of his righteousness not mine his our brother john was able to go through that door with joy not with strugglings and cryings and resistance but peacefully and i watched as sister nancy was able to let him go through that door and she wasn't clawing and struggling to hold on to a little bit more life and she wasn't trying to get just another day or another week she wasn't trying to have the medical staff do everything they could just to keep the body alive but she had such a faith that was expressed in that hour she knew where he was going and she knew that she would see him again and she knew that his release his victory was in his death and going to the sixth dimension and i watched it i went into the the room there and to see brother john on thursday before he passed away and we went in there in the morning and the the medical staff somebody a representative of the medical staff was trying to explain to him you know the possibilities in the future and asking him about you know whether they wanted resuscitation or they wanted you know any kind of artificial breathing and he wasn't understanding the question and he was asking and he was confused about what they were trying to ask and and so we just asked if we could have a minute to speak with him and when the lady left the room we just started talking about the word we started talking about the promise and about god and god appoints the day of our birth and god appoints the day of our death and all things that are in his hand and our life is in his hand and brother john started saying amen amen he didn't understand the medical terms but he understood those terms and they brought comfort and peace to him there was no fear in the man there was only faith when we began to talk about those things and we began to say things like if god wants to take us home we don't want to remain anyways and he said amen he was not afraid of what he was facing the word was bringing such a consolation to him he i mean he perked up he shook my hand he brightened we were talking about the word and the the real john come to life and he was so uh he was so alive actually we were talking about the word and we prayed together and i told him that i loved him and he said i love you too and i didn't realize until nancy sister nancy told me that what a rare thing that was but it flowed off of his tongue as natural as anything in that atmosphere under the word john was alive we didn't know that this was the last hours of his life you would never know it because the real john was alive and the real john is still alive the one who amen the word is still very much alive the one who shook my hand and held onto my hand and said he loved me is still very much alive that john cannot die and i thank god there's a promise for us back to the story of lazarus and jesus jesus comes then to bethany and as he's coming mary comes out to speak to him and she says mary said unto jesus lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but i know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of god god will give it thee jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die and then he looks at martha and he said believeth thou this that's the question brother john came to this question and he believed it he believed that whosoever believeth whoever liveth and believeth in christ shall never die and when when god when jesus asked martha believeth thou this there was a day that john faced this question and john said i believe it and he's alive because of that she said yea lord i believe thou art christ the son of god which should come into the world i'd like to say that our brother john's resurrection is secure it's secure because he's alive it's secure because jesus came and he was the voice of the resurrection in john's life and that voice came through this message and this message was the voice of god calling john out of the deadness of sin and quickening that eternal life that laid inside of him and springing it into action i say john our brother john's resurrection is secure because the voice of the resurrection already resurrected him out of dead denominationalism and brought him into newness of life he is already resurrected so he is a candidate for resurrection and if we want to secure our resurrection we must let that voice bring to us a resurrection a resurrection out of the deadness of sin and transgression a resurrection out of deadness of traditions and deadness of religion but bring us into the living word amen where the living christ becomes a living reality to us and the voice of the resurrection calls us out of our graves and that that resurrection secures our future resurrection and rapture ephesians 2 says for by grace are you saved through faith jesus said he goes i am the resurrection and the life whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this and martha had to express her faith and it's the grace of god that has given us a gift of faith to believe that he is currently present tense the resurrection and the life and for by grace are you saved but it wasn't it wasn't brother john's good works and his good deeds and his and his uh accomplishing some religious feats amen but it was the grace of god that come to him and brought a voice that brought him to life and it was by faith that he could express that he believed this that he believed this christ this resurrected one the one that is the life and the resurrection and it brought him a resurrection and it gave him peace when he was departing from this life and moving in to the better life he said for by grace are you saved through faith and not not of yourselves it is a gift of god not of works lest any man should boast and i would like to conclude with this scripture from first thessalonians chapter four it says but i would not have you be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep they're not dead i we use terminology because it's common to us and it's not incorrect even jesus had to use the common language of the day to the disciples and say lazarus is dead so that they would understand but for me our brother john is not dead he's only resting he's gone to that place the prophet showed us when he went beyond the curtain of time to the sixth dimension where there was green grass and the men were running up and greeting him saying our precious brother and the sisters greeting him and the prophet of god had no language that he could use to describe he said the utopia is beyond that he said perfect peace it's beyond that perfect love he said love is the only way that i can describe it it was beyond perfect perfect beyond perfect even so much that when it was time for him to come back he didn't want to return to his body so i say our brother john morrow didn't die because he can't die because he believed the one who is the resurrection and the life and received him and he's not dead but he's asleep so this scripture is very pertinent to us he said i would not have you be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep and for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words that is our comfort i feel like brother keith i may i don't know what a glorified body will be like when my soul in my theophany and my glorified body unite together maybe we have perfect recollection perfect understanding perfect knowledge but with the understanding i have now i feel like brother keith i think i may need to be introduced to brother john i've only known him past 70. i don't know him what he looks like at 19 or 20 years old i may have to be introduced or maybe i'll just know i don't know in that form what it'll be but either way i will see my brother again i will enjoy his company again his fellowship and and in that life he'll have no more struggles expressing himself and neither will i have any more struggle expressing myself but what we were always intended to be is what will be expressed in that day and i say let's comfort one another with this comfort amen let's bow our heads and pray the musicians would like to make their way back up dear lord jesus we thank you for the privilege of being able to gather and lord we're not here to look at a death but we're here to remember a life and not just in a far gone memory or a past life but we're looking back and seeing our brother and where he lived and what he did and how he interacted with others but that same brother is still alive and god we're going to comfort one another with these words that our brother is in a place lord that he longed to be and he's at a place we long to be and we thank you for that consolation and god i ask if there's any one of us who have not yet heard the voice of the resurrection the voice that has come in this end time to call an end time bride to her position i pray that that voice of christ would ring through the word this morning and strike a seed that's laying in a heart and it may be as though it's dead asleep dead and sin and trespasses but god your voice can wake it up lord that you can plant faith deep in the heart to believe that you are a present tense god and that you are the resurrection and the life today and if we can believe and receive your life lord then we can be resurrected quickened brought to life awakened lord and i pray lord that we'd all be awake and live as though we're awake lord and testify that you have called us out of the darkness into the light god in that light and that life that's within us it'll never fade away it'll never be snuffed out it'll never quit and for that we're so thankful lord we ask that you would bless our sister nancy lord that you would be a great comfort to her lord that she now is uh thinking of life in the future without her brother john without his companionship without him there i pray that you would be a friend to sticketh closer than a brother as you promised in your word that you would comfort her and shelter her and may your presence be tangible around her may she actually be able to sense your very presence with her and be comforted by that i prayed you blessed the family lord that they would gather together and love one another greater in a greater way than they ever have before and take care of one another and minister to one another and comfort one another and i pray as a body of believers that you would help us as friends and family and believers to gather around and comfort them as well and lend our support and our love god i pray that you would be glorified in it all i thank you for allowing all of us to share in some way in some part with the life of our brother john and it's a privilege that we carry in this life that only a few have got to have and we're thankful for that and i'm thankful lord to know that he is alive father we pray that you would bless us as we move from here that you would comfort us and guide us and help each one of us to fulfill our purpose in this life and help us to remain faithful and trust in you in every step and lord if we come to the end of our life lord may it be said of us that we also live or not died
