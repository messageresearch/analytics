[0:00] why do you believe you were
[0:01] predestinated to believe
[0:03] the ingredient was placed inside of you
[0:05] why do you have eyes to see and ears to
[0:07] hear
[0:08] because you've got another set of eyes
[0:10] that can see the father's face
[0:12] you've got another set of ears that can
[0:13] hear the father's voice it's
[0:15] more than what you've got in your
[0:16] physical makeup there's more to you than
[0:19] meets the eye
[0:23] why is it when you see that cloud amen
[0:25] you see the bridegroom when you see the
[0:27] cloud you see your invisible union
[0:29] others see the physicals others hear
[0:31] what the prophet said others can pass
[0:32] the test but to you it's more than a
[0:34] cloud
[0:35] it's your lover it's your bridegroom
[0:36] it's your mate it's the invisible union
[0:38] it's him here receiving you it's the
[0:40] fullness of the word it's the headship
[0:42] uniting with you the body
[0:45] why because there's an angel who's
[0:47] beholding the father's face
[0:48] that can hear what's going on in the
[0:50] throne room
[0:52] and it's connected to you through the
[0:54] soul somehow i don't know how
[0:56] but it's there
[1:00] that's why there's things that you just
[1:02] know to be the truth
[1:04] prove it i can't prove it but it's the
[1:06] truth
[1:08] why is it the truth why was that little
[1:11] samaritan woman
[1:12] who was on her sixth husband coming to
[1:15] the well
[1:15] living a bad life a dirty life amen
[1:18] why was it she was hungering and
[1:20] thirsting for god
[1:22] why was it she wanted to know the proper
[1:24] place of worship why was it when she met
[1:26] a man that could tell her about her
[1:28] husband's she didn't say can you show me
[1:29] where to get a good job and can you tell
[1:31] me where i lost my money
[1:32] nope she says
[1:35] sir i perceive that you're a prophet the
[1:38] elders say worship here
[1:40] and you say worship there where can i
[1:41] worship god
[1:43] where did that come from that wasn't
[1:45] anything in the natural part of that
[1:46] woman
[1:47] that was something from the sea down on
[1:48] the inside and brother banham said she
[1:50] could receive his word
[1:52] because she had representation in heaven
[1:55] because their their angels always behold
[1:58] the father's face
[2:03] why is it you can believe why is it you
[2:05] can see
[2:07] because you got more eyes than the ones
[2:09] that are in your head
[2:10] and you have more ears than the ones
[2:12] that are attached to the side of your
[2:13] head
[2:14] you've got eyes and ears that can access
[2:16] the throne room of god
[2:20] how does it work i can't tell you how
[2:22] all i can tell you is it works
[2:25] because the sixth sense in me knows it's
[2:27] the truth knows it
[2:29] works knows it's real i i've experienced
[2:32] it i've seen it i've stood on the word i
[2:33] was given something that i didn't have
[2:35] in myself
[2:36] an understanding i couldn't understand a
[2:38] willpower i didn't have
[2:39] an overcoming deliverance that wasn't
[2:41] coming from the flesh there was
[2:42] something coming from the sixth sense
[2:44] something more than what was happening
[2:46] in this flesh
[2:48] and it's a living reality to me
[2:52] how do you know it i know it
[2:56] prove it just wait
[3:01] just wait and he will prove it by
[3:04] changing my atoms
