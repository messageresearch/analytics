[0:00] Brother Brandham was the the the
[0:01] fulfillment and was the the
[0:04] manifestation of the promise of Malachi
[0:06] 45 and 6.
[0:09] &gt;&gt; But the point of that was to minister
[0:12] about the promise and point us so we
[0:15] could say here's the signs, here's the
[0:18] scriptures. Now because of that and
[0:20] because you believe that already when
[0:23] you hear the message, you look and say,
[0:25] "Where is Jesus? Where is the Messiah?"
[0:29] He said he'd come today. Where is he?
[0:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; But if there's something missing, the
[0:36] way of God has not been yet more
[0:37] perfectly expounded unto you, you will
[0:40] stop with John's ministry. You will stop
[0:43] with the ministry of brother Brandham.
[0:44] And that's all you will receive.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; And you won't seek the manifestation of
[0:50] the promise.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; Because now in our age, what is supposed
[0:54] to happen? You and I, I say this way,
[0:58] the bride of Jesus Christ should be
[1:01] manifesting the promise.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; Where's the signs, Brother Chris?
[1:09] &gt;&gt; Show me evidence.
[1:13] &gt;&gt; I don't see anything.
[1:16] I'm sorry, but that's it.
[1:18] But now a son of God says,
[1:22] "I never been here before. I'm new to
[1:24] this church.
[1:25] Can you can you show me what it means?
[1:29] &gt;&gt; And they go, I knew it.
[1:34] &gt;&gt; You see, saints, it comes down to the
[1:35] end of it. It all depends on the
[1:37] sovereign grace of Jesus Christ. It all
[1:39] depends on Christ himself revealing
[1:42] himself to you. And if you are new,
[1:45] which Christ is inside of you, you're
[1:46] not yet aware of that. When you meet
[1:48] Christ and your brother,
[1:50] &gt;&gt; something testifies back and forth.
[1:53] There's a twinkle in the eye. There's a
[1:55] a recognition, a glimmer of recognition.
[1:58] And now,
[2:01] now you see it. And now you're saying,
[2:03] "God, I want to be the manifestation of
[2:05] the promise."
[2:07] &gt;&gt; That is what God is looking for. He
[2:09] says, "I must decrease." Where says, "I
[2:11] must decrease. He must increase." Elijah
[2:14] throws the mantle. Elisha must complete
[2:17] the ministry.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; So, we're looking to what?
[2:22] the manifestation of what the word says
[2:24] about the bride of Jesus Christ.
