[11:44] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[11:47] all good evening it's good to be here
[11:49] together while we're standing let's grab
[11:51] our Bibles and let's read a scripture
[11:53] before we're
[11:54] seated we want to read out of Proverbs
[11:57] chapter 18 while you're turning there I
[11:59] just want to remind you that brother
[12:00] Vitali and his family will be coming in
[12:02] this weekend they actually arrive uh in
[12:04] Columbus tomorrow evening so we'll be
[12:06] picking them up there and uh they'll be
[12:09] taking the Sunday morning service here
[12:11] and then the afternoon service for the
[12:13] Youth so we're looking forward to having
[12:15] him here for that also I want to remind
[12:17] you that Brother Kyle wer will be
[12:19] leaving Friday he'll be flying out to
[12:21] Oregon for services there brother richc
[12:23] and he'll be coming back I think Monday
[12:25] or Tuesday so just be praying for him
[12:27] and brother Wesley will be with him
[12:29] and also don't forget brother Emanuel
[12:30] he's still gone still be gone for
[12:32] another two weeks I believe so remember
[12:34] keep him in prayer he sent me a text let
[12:36] me know that he had one day he wasn't
[12:38] feeling too well but the Lord took care
[12:40] of him and he's feeling much better so
[12:41] just pray for our brother to have
[12:43] strength amen doing a lot of ministering
[12:45] a lot of interpreting a lot of traveling
[12:47] and it has a way of wearing you down so
[12:50] just pray that he'll stay strong
[12:52] amen let's look together here at
[12:54] Proverbs
[12:57] 18:24 proverbs 18:
[13:02] 24 a man that hath friends must show
[13:05] himself friendly and there is a friend
[13:07] that sticketh closer than a brother and
[13:10] God bless you as you have your seats
[13:12] amen it's a little bit of an odd
[13:14] scripture to take but God dropped this
[13:16] thought in my heart and I haven't been
[13:17] able to get away from it and the only
[13:19] way to get away from it is to preach it
[13:20] amen and there's a scripture that I read
[13:23] that's going to be the main thrust that
[13:24] I want to launch off of out of 2 Samuel
[13:27] we can go ahead and turn to 2 Samuel
[13:29] chap 10 but I I just want to share with
[13:32] you that um oh it's probably been a
[13:34] couple months ago I read through this
[13:36] and it just struck me every once in a
[13:38] while you read something out of the
[13:39] scripture that strikes you and and for
[13:41] me I know that there's a sermon there I
[13:43] know there's something there that's
[13:45] drawing my attention but I don't know
[13:47] yet how it'll materialize so that was a
[13:49] few months ago and then just over the
[13:51] last several weeks it began to
[13:53] materialize in my heart and so now I
[13:56] just want to share it with you but I
[13:57] want to take for a title Don't Make
[13:59] Friends into enemies Don't Make Friends
[14:03] into
[14:03] enemies and for a subtitle I want to put
[14:07] uh preserving
[14:08] relationships so don't make friends into
[14:11] enemies and preserving relationships
[14:13] amen and that's why I was just dwelling
[14:16] on this because this is not not my usual
[14:20] mode of operation but God dropped it in
[14:22] my heart so solid I knew what to
[14:23] minister amen so we're going to go down
[14:25] this line once we read 2 Samuel begin to
[14:28] see what we're referring to 2 Samuel
[14:35] 10:1 and it came to pass after this that
[14:38] the king of the children of Aman died
[14:41] and hanun his son reigned in his stead
[14:44] then said David I will show kindness
[14:46] unto hanun the son of nahash as his
[14:48] father showed kindness unto me and David
[14:51] sent Comfort sent to comfort him by the
[14:53] hand of his servants for his father and
[14:56] David's servants came into the land of
[14:57] the children of Aman
[14:59] and the princes of the children of Aman
[15:01] said unto hanun their lord thinkest thou
[15:03] that David doth honor thy father that he
[15:06] ha sent comforters unto thee hath not
[15:08] David rather sent his servants unto thee
[15:10] to search the city and to spy it out and
[15:13] to overthrow it wherefore hanon took
[15:16] David's servants and shaved off the one
[15:18] half of their beards and cut off their
[15:20] garments in the middle even to their
[15:22] buttocks and sent them away when they
[15:24] told it unto David he sent to them he he
[15:28] sent to meet them because the men were
[15:30] greatly ashamed and the King said Terry
[15:33] at Jericho unto your beards be grown and
[15:35] then return amen so like I said I was
[15:38] just reading this through my daily my
[15:40] daily reading my daily Bible reading and
[15:42] it struck me and I knew there was
[15:44] something here so I I started thinking
[15:46] about it meditating on it and it just
[15:48] came back and you begin to realize that
[15:51] that there's a great lesson here it's a
[15:54] simple lesson but it's a great lesson
[15:56] here David wants to show kindness David
[15:59] is going to show himself a friend to
[16:01] this neighboring country to the country
[16:03] of Aman and because this man's father
[16:05] showed kindness to David David's going
[16:07] to show kindness to him and sends an
[16:09] ambassage sends some ambassadors that
[16:11] way to comfort him for his father and
[16:13] his extension of friendship amen but
[16:16] they were suspicious of David They
[16:19] didn't accept him as a friend they were
[16:21] suspicious and and the princes of that
[16:23] country began to speak to the king and
[16:25] made him misunderstand David's act of
[16:28] kindness
[16:29] made him misunderstand it uh made him
[16:31] suspicious amen and all of a sudden uh
[16:34] the fear began to creep in that David
[16:37] wasn't genuine this is not a genuine
[16:39] show of friendship and now because fear
[16:42] Creeps in this old self Rises up and now
[16:45] there's an act of self-preservation
[16:46] that's going to take place based off
[16:48] suspicion based off all of these things
[16:50] and all of it is a mirage all of it's
[16:52] false all of it's fake David is being
[16:55] genuine so what he does is he he shames
[16:58] the ambassadors and he sends them away
[17:00] ashamed and they're greatly ashamed and
[17:02] what he did was a terrible defense to
[17:04] the men and David uh uh David then tells
[17:07] them the way that Jericho and then The
[17:09] Story Goes On we won't read all of it
[17:11] but the story goes on and when they
[17:12] realize that they had offended David
[17:15] then they call up the syrians because
[17:16] they know David's going to fight so now
[17:18] they call for enemies and they're
[17:19] starting a battle before a battle
[17:22] started David come as a friend and they
[17:25] didn't accept him as a friend but saw
[17:26] him as an enemy but he was coming as a a
[17:28] friend that's why I said Don't Make
[17:30] Friends into enemies David would have
[17:33] been the best friend they ever
[17:35] had David was a man after God's Own
[17:38] Heart he was a mighty king and a mighty
[17:40] warrior if they would have received his
[17:41] friendship if they would have
[17:42] acknowledged his friend and they would
[17:44] have been friendly unto him he would
[17:46] have been the best friend they ever had
[17:48] but because they were suspicious amen
[17:51] because they had Pride because they had
[17:53] fear fear and pride brought out
[17:56] self-preservation and brought out
[17:57] suspicion and brought out all of this
[18:00] out of their out of their hearts amen
[18:02] and they did the very wrong thing and
[18:03] then after they realized they had
[18:05] greatly offended David now instead of
[18:07] repenting and making it right they go
[18:09] and get syrians to come and become an
[18:11] army to stand with them and when David
[18:13] finds out they've called on the syrians
[18:15] Denny sends joab in the battle there's a
[18:17] great battle and it eventually ends with
[18:19] Aman being destroyed the king losing his
[18:22] kingdom them taking the crown and
[18:23] putting it on David's
[18:25] head and none of it needed to happen
[18:28] right all because they didn't receive a
[18:32] friend as a friend but they allowed the
[18:34] devil to interpret his friendship as an
[18:38] enemy oh man what a lesson friends like
[18:42] I said this is simple amen don't wait me
[18:44] to for me to get to the punchline you've
[18:45] already got it it's so simple you can
[18:48] read it and understand how many times
[18:50] have we done the same thing amen all the
[18:53] time we take a notion from a friend or
[18:55] or we take a compliment and we can take
[18:57] a compliment through the devil
[19:00] interpretation and we can turn a
[19:01] compliment
[19:03] into a suspicious
[19:06] statement what do they mean by that
[19:08] statement why did they say it that way
[19:10] why did he say it why did they say it
[19:12] with that tone and all of a sudden we
[19:14] begin to become suspicious of our
[19:18] friends I say God help us help us
[19:22] everyone amen we find that in the Bible
[19:25] friendship is a very important theme
[19:27] very
[19:29] important Jesus was the greatest friend
[19:31] the disciples ever had he called them
[19:34] his friend friendship shows up from the
[19:36] beginning to the end we find David and
[19:39] Jonathan were friends bosom friends so
[19:41] much friends that the love for one
[19:43] another was greater than a love for a
[19:45] man for a
[19:46] woman amen and they stuck with one
[19:48] another they defended one another they
[19:50] protected and trusted one another
[19:52] friendship is a tremendous theme in the
[19:54] Bible and here we find a case of
[19:56] friendship turned they made they made an
[19:58] enemy out of David when it didn't need
[20:00] to be that
[20:01] way and I think that most of the time
[20:05] the things that happen to us don't need
[20:06] to happen the way they
[20:09] do we we many times turns brothers and
[20:12] sisters into
[20:14] enemies has that ever happened to you by
[20:17] being
[20:18] suspicious why did they do that why
[20:20] didn't they include me in this why did
[20:22] they make that statement why did they go
[20:24] there why last time they called me this
[20:26] time they didn't call me yeah I was
[20:29] invited there last time but I'm not
[20:31] invited there this time
[20:34] brother I said it's simple I mean we're
[20:37] we're so Fallen as human beings it's
[20:41] embarrassing it's shameful sometimes I
[20:43] just look to God and I said God I'm
[20:45] ashamed of being in this hybrid flesh
[20:47] I'm ashamed of where my mind goes I'm
[20:50] ashamed of where my emotions go I
[20:52] sometimes ashamed of myself I tell you
[20:54] what's so tragic Sometimes the best
[20:56] friend you have in the whole world your
[20:58] spouse the devil will make you
[21:00] suspicious of your spouse you'll be
[21:03] suspicious of their motives why did they
[21:04] say that and why why when I said this
[21:07] they said that and why when I asked them
[21:08] to do this they didn't do
[21:11] that what's the devil trying to do is
[21:14] trying to come down and make enemies
[21:16] about out of the best friend you have in
[21:18] the whole
[21:19] world which is your spouse and and we
[21:21] all know what that's like amen the enemy
[21:23] is constantly trying to find a way in to
[21:26] break friendship to break relationship
[21:28] ship that's why the that's why the
[21:29] subtitle is preserving relationships and
[21:31] we're going to get into that but the
[21:33] devil will make us make us suspicious
[21:36] and that suspicion always comes from
[21:38] fear and pride fear and pride and we're
[21:41] going to find out that the best way to
[21:43] stay a friend and the best way to
[21:45] preserve a relationship is we've got to
[21:48] die out to ourselves and stop this
[21:50] notion of self-preservation stop this
[21:53] notion of protecting ourselves and
[21:55] having to prevent harm from coming to us
[21:58] amen the only way to be a true friend
[22:00] amen the only way to preserve a
[22:02] relationship is to become absolutely
[22:04] vulnerable and open to total Destruction
[22:07] amen from the ones you love
[22:09] amen say is that right brother Chad
[22:12] that's what Jesus did yes sir that's
[22:15] what Jesus did let's look at this in
[22:18] John chapter
[22:23] 6 I'm finding more and more as God
[22:27] begins to deal deeper and deeper in my
[22:29] own heart I feel I find more and more
[22:34] that uh all of my
[22:37] problems come from
[22:42] myself that it's not always what happens
[22:45] around me it's how I interpret what's
[22:47] happening around me and many times I
[22:50] have a false interpretation of what's
[22:52] happening and the false interpretation
[22:54] is coming out of self-love amen coming
[22:57] out of Pride amen and and and and a fear
[23:01] that I'm going to lose something I'm
[23:03] going to lose a friend I'm going to lose
[23:05] status I'm going to lose reputation and
[23:07] then all of a sudden I go into counter
[23:09] measures to try to counteract the loss
[23:12] of a reputation or the loss of
[23:13] friendship or a loss of status amen and
[23:16] when I do that I moved into
[23:18] self-preservation but now in order to
[23:20] preserve myself it causes me to go on a
[23:23] counter
[23:24] offensive amen and all the a sudden you
[23:28] can have War break out amen and
[23:31] sometimes it's not open conflict
[23:32] sometimes it's cold
[23:34] war it's a silent War it's an
[23:36] estrangement from friends and you become
[23:38] distant and become cold amen and the the
[23:40] Cold War enters in all because amen of
[23:44] old rotten dirty stinking
[23:46] self and that Old Pride that was
[23:49] injected at the fall amen that we all
[23:51] have to deal with amen that's Lucifer's
[23:53] Pride this comes straight from this
[23:55] comes straight from Lucifer got injected
[23:57] into Humanity through the fall and we're
[23:59] all struggling with it but what we need
[24:01] is a good healthy dose of dying to
[24:05] self and like one brother told me he
[24:07] says sometimes you don't even know what
[24:09] you're supposed to die from yes I mean
[24:12] you want to die to yourself so I died to
[24:14] myself when I come to the message and I
[24:16] threw my shorts
[24:18] away and I cut the cable to the TV and
[24:21] and I died to myself cuz I love TV and I
[24:24] mean I was raised the latchy kid I
[24:26] watched four to 6 hours of TV every day
[24:28] of my life I mean I loved it I I watched
[24:31] it I watched it when I didn't want to
[24:33] watch it I watched it when I was tired
[24:34] of watching it but I watched it
[24:36] anyways so when I cut it out I was dying
[24:39] to self when I cut some old places and I
[24:42] surrendered amen but you realize that
[24:44] this dying out to self amen it's not
[24:46] going to be that simple it goes a whole
[24:49] lot deeper than that and so we we begin
[24:52] to find that brother B said the greatest
[24:54] enemy I got is William brandham well I'm
[24:56] telling you the greatest enemy I got is
[24:58] Chad Lamb this old hybrid flesh with
[25:00] this carnal spirit amen and this this
[25:03] notion of I have to protect myself and I
[25:05] I've got to drop that notion if I'm ever
[25:07] going to get anywhere in the kingdom of
[25:09] God if I'm going to be like Christ I
[25:12] have to drop
[25:14] self-preservation I got to get rid of it
[25:16] I got to stop all this
[25:20] suspicious you know what I'm talking
[25:22] about cuz you're a human
[25:25] being the very ones you love the most
[25:28] sometimes family members become
[25:29] suspicious of one another why did they
[25:31] do that and why did they say that and
[25:34] you know they they got in the fridge and
[25:36] they ate the last piece of cake and they
[25:38] knew that I wanted it they just did that
[25:39] to spite
[25:43] me and then all of a
[25:45] sudden it builds up a wall yes and then
[25:49] we go into Cold War and it sounds funny
[25:52] but that's the harmless end of it but
[25:54] you take that a couple other notches
[25:55] into a brother and sister or to family
[25:58] members or to spouses you you extend it
[26:00] from one Church to another and all of a
[26:02] sudden you got open Cold War for no
[26:04] reason whatsoever other than the war
[26:06] that's going on in our mind trying to
[26:08] preserve ourselves and our reputation
[26:10] and not to allow ourselves to get
[26:14] hurt but is not the example Jesus Christ
[26:18] gave us and it's not the example the
[26:19] prophet in this age gave
[26:21] us if we go to John chapter 6 and look
[26:25] at verse
[26:26] 70
[26:31] we're going to look at the relationship
[26:32] between Jesus and Judas for a moment and
[26:35] Jesus answered them have not I chosen
[26:39] you 12 and one of you is a
[26:41] devil he spoke of Judas a scariot the
[26:44] son of Simon for he it was that should
[26:46] betray him being one of the 12 I want
[26:49] you to look where we're at in the Book
[26:50] of John we're in John chapter six all
[26:52] the way in the beginning we're in the
[26:53] earlier parts of Jesus's Ministry we
[26:55] haven't even come to the end yet and he
[26:58] already knows that one of the ones that
[27:00] he's chosen is a devil and he knows it's
[27:02] judas's scariot Amen John John discloses
[27:06] that here in the Bible amen but you
[27:08] never find anywhere where Jesus
[27:11] discredits Judas as a friend he calls
[27:13] him
[27:14] friend in fact Jesus knows what's in the
[27:17] heart of Judas and he knows that he's a
[27:20] thief he knows he has the heart of the
[27:22] thief so what does Jesus do to Judas he
[27:25] gives him the bag of money because he
[27:27] know knows in his heart is a thief and
[27:29] he knows he's the one to betray betray
[27:32] him but you know if it was me and I knew
[27:35] if I knew one of you would betray me
[27:37] amen I'm going to tell you it's going to
[27:38] take a whole lot of Grace for me to be
[27:40] as good to you as Jesus was to
[27:43] Judas I'm just being honest I just I
[27:46] need to grow I need more of the spirit
[27:48] of God to take over and I need less of
[27:50] me because if I know if I know from the
[27:53] beginning in our relationship that a few
[27:55] years down the road amen one of you are
[27:57] going to betray me and it's going to
[27:59] cause separation from the disciples I
[28:01] love it's going to cause a painful death
[28:02] it's going to cause all of that it's
[28:04] going to be very difficult for me to
[28:06] maintain the kind of friendship for you
[28:09] that Jesus maintained for
[28:12] Judas but the question is are we going
[28:15] to be like Jesus or
[28:19] not
[28:21] amen Jesus never came to the Earth to
[28:23] preserve his life
[28:26] right
[28:28] you know when we really get a revelation
[28:31] of who we are like genuinely catch a
[28:35] revelation of who we are in the reality
[28:37] you know not the emotional workup not
[28:40] the enthusiasm or excitement of being
[28:41] accepted and being one of them but
[28:43] really quickened in the soul that you
[28:46] know that you came from God and you go
[28:48] to God that you know you're part of God
[28:50] you know you're here to express a
[28:52] portion of the word then really it comes
[28:54] down to the point that what does my life
[28:56] matter anyway
[28:59] what is my reputation worth anyways I'm
[29:01] only here for 70 80 90 years or however
[29:04] space of time he gives me and then I
[29:06] will go on to my eternal reward amen
[29:09] I've come to the place now amen in in my
[29:12] life that the sixth Dimension or the
[29:14] marry supper whichever one I get to
[29:16] First amen Is So Glorious to me that I
[29:18] have no problem dropping this life to
[29:20] move to the next one and I couldn't have
[29:23] always said that because I had such a
[29:25] desire for things in this life
[29:27] experiences I wanted to have I wanted to
[29:29] get married I wanted to have children I
[29:31] wanted to experience these things but
[29:33] the more that I live in this hybrid
[29:35] flesh and the more I realize how wrong
[29:37] it
[29:39] is the thought of leaving this flesh is
[29:42] not a terrorizing thought it's a
[29:44] glorious thought it's a happy thought
[29:46] amen when we know where we're going so
[29:48] if we know we've been dropped into this
[29:49] Earth on assignment yes by purpose and
[29:53] will of God on assignment to accomplish
[29:56] something for his purpose then if I get
[29:58] spit on so what if I get rejected so
[30:01] what if if if everybody turns from me so
[30:04] what I'm here to accomplish his purpose
[30:07] to manifest his will and then to go on
[30:09] back to where I came from brother
[30:11] brandham said this time is just a little
[30:13] hickey on the circle of Eternity amen
[30:15] and it'll be sucked right back into
[30:17] eternity one day when God accomplishes
[30:19] what he wants to accomplish I came from
[30:21] eternity I'm going back to Eternity my
[30:24] whole existence is for eternity I'm only
[30:26] here playing a
[30:29] part and I want to play that part
[30:32] faithfully and I never came here to
[30:34] preserve my life like Jesus never came
[30:36] here to preserve his
[30:37] life I came here to surrender my life
[30:41] amen but been I've been given free
[30:43] choice in this dimension in this area of
[30:46] time in this vessel of clay I've been
[30:48] given free choice so that I could choose
[30:51] to lay down my life and let him have
[30:53] full
[30:55] control and so we must must lose the
[30:57] notion of
[30:59] self-preservation we must keep dying
[31:02] continually to
[31:04] Pride we must not let fear be our
[31:09] motivation I cannot count to you how
[31:12] many horrible decisions I've made
[31:14] because I was
[31:16] afraid I was afraid of what people would
[31:18] think I was afraid of what would happen
[31:20] if I don't move quickly I was
[31:25] afraid I I can't tell you how many
[31:28] decisions I made based off fear and many
[31:32] times It Was Fear I would look bad I
[31:35] would lose out I would
[31:40] fail if you see all those things keep
[31:42] pointing back to one
[31:44] thing
[31:46] me that's true make a horrible financial
[31:49] decision because if I don't jump on this
[31:50] now I'll lose the
[31:52] opportunity why so I could gain
[31:54] something financially right my fear was
[31:58] I would lose yes my fear was my
[32:02] reputation would suffer my fear was an
[32:05] opportunity to pass me by my fear was
[32:07] people would think bad of
[32:12] me and many of those decisions were
[32:15] disastrous some in major ways some in
[32:17] minor
[32:19] ways but that's not the choice love
[32:24] makes love makes a different choice yeah
[32:27] and we saw that in the life of Jesus
[32:33] Christ let's look at John
[32:39] 13 John 13
[32:48] and10 this is John 13 we read every time
[32:51] we have feet washing once a
[32:53] month and after Jesus washed their feet
[32:56] verse 10 he says he uh Jesus saith in
[33:00] him he that is washed needeth not saved
[33:02] to wash his feet this is he hasn't
[33:03] washed him yet this is before he washes
[33:05] him he that is washed is not saved to
[33:07] wash his feet but is clean every wit and
[33:09] ye are clean but not
[33:12] all
[33:15] so he knew about verse 11 for he knew
[33:19] who should betray him therefore said he
[33:21] you're not all clean here we know that
[33:23] Jesus knew they weren't all clean Jesus
[33:26] knew that one of them was a devil Jesus
[33:28] Jesus knew that Judas would betray him
[33:31] Jesus knew he had the heart of a thief
[33:33] Jesus knew when they were when when they
[33:35] were in h in the house uh uh where Mary
[33:38] came and broke the alabaster box and
[33:41] Judas says this should have been sold
[33:43] and given to the poor Jesus knew why he
[33:45] said that CU he had the heart of a thief
[33:47] right and Jesus didn't call him out
[33:49] Jesus didn't rebuke him didn't make him
[33:51] ashamed of himself Jesus just simply
[33:54] said the poor you always
[33:55] have me you won't always have she's
[33:58] anointed me for my
[33:59] burial but he didn't he he knew but he
[34:02] didn't call him out I wonder how many of
[34:05] us could pass that
[34:07] test knowing exactly why a Brother's
[34:10] saying
[34:11] something but instead of shaming him and
[34:13] exposing him you just cover it
[34:18] over telling you I struggle with these
[34:21] things sometimes you know somebody's up
[34:23] to no good and all you want to do is
[34:26] expose
[34:27] it but we're going to find out that's
[34:29] not really what we're supposed to
[34:32] do so Jesus had Jesus is about to wash
[34:36] judas's feet and I don't believe Jesus
[34:39] washed him any differently than he
[34:40] washed Peter's or
[34:42] John's I don't believe he treated Judas
[34:44] any differently than he treated anybody
[34:46] else I believe he treated him all the
[34:48] same so much so they said one of you
[34:51] amen one of you shall betray me and they
[34:52] all said is it I is it I is it I it
[34:55] wasn't that he had been given the cold
[34:57] shoulder to Judas all week long it
[34:58] wasn't that I mean he barely washed his
[35:00] feet and moved on they had no clue who
[35:02] it
[35:04] was even when Jesus sent him away they
[35:07] assumed he went away on an errand to do
[35:09] something for Jesus they never assumed
[35:11] that it was
[35:12] he this is how Jesus treated his
[35:16] enemy he treated his enemy as a
[35:20] friend you know Billy Paul said in his
[35:24] testimony he said one amazing thing
[35:26] about brother bham he says you couldn't
[35:28] tell his enemies from his
[35:32] friends I said God help me I've got to
[35:36] grow I have to grow but but the purpose
[35:39] of preaching is so we know what we're
[35:41] what we're seeking after what we need
[35:42] what we're praying for saying God I need
[35:45] victory in this help me with this I need
[35:47] to die to myself I need to love everyone
[35:50] as a
[35:53] friend let's go over to Matthew 26
[36:03] Matthew
[36:08] 26 and I'd like to read verse
[36:11] 47 this is in the Garden of Gethsemane
[36:14] in their coming Judas is leading a band
[36:16] to arrest Jesus in verse 47 he says and
[36:19] while he yet spake Lo Judas one of the
[36:21] 12 came and with him a great multitude
[36:24] with swords and staves from Chief
[36:25] priests and Elders of the people now he
[36:27] that betrayed him gave them a sign
[36:29] saying whomsoever I shall kiss that same
[36:32] as he hold him fast and forth with he
[36:34] came to Jesus and said hail master and
[36:36] kissed him and Jesus said unto him
[36:39] friend wherefore art thou
[36:43] come Jesus at the point of betrayal
[36:48] calls Judas his friend
[36:51] right never called him an enemy called
[36:54] him a friend he said friend friend
[36:56] wherefore art thou come then came they
[36:59] and laid hands on Jesus and took
[37:03] him I just marvel at this this is our
[37:08] example no matter how hard it seems or
[37:11] how impossible but you know what I don't
[37:13] believe it's
[37:14] impossible I absolutely do not stand
[37:17] here today and believe that this is
[37:20] impossible I believe this is the age
[37:22] where it's become possible I believe
[37:25] this is the generation amen that will
[37:27] have the manifestation of the life of
[37:28] Jesus Christ I believe that's why God
[37:31] sent a prophet and He restored the word
[37:32] because when the word came back the life
[37:34] of that word came back and if the full
[37:36] measure of the word is back amen then
[37:38] the full life of that word is back here
[37:41] in the bride to bring about the full
[37:43] manifestation of the life of Jesus
[37:45] Christ I I look at this and I find
[37:47] myself short I'm short in many areas I'm
[37:50] fallen short of these things in many
[37:52] ways but I'm not discouraged I'm
[37:54] encouraged because the word is here that
[37:55] will bring me all the way to the full
[37:58] manifestation that God wants out of my
[38:00] life Luther had partial word he had
[38:03] partial life Wesley had partial word had
[38:05] partial life but we're not in the day of
[38:07] partial word and I'm not I'm not
[38:09] settling for partial life but I'm
[38:11] pressing towards the mark of the high
[38:12] calling in Christ Jesus because I
[38:14] believe this is the hour and God sent a
[38:17] word and sent his Spirit to bring that
[38:19] word to to
[38:21] life and that's what I'm depending on
[38:24] I'm not depending on doing better amen
[38:26] I've tried all my life and I failed but
[38:28] there's things that are changing in me
[38:30] that is not an effort it's a
[38:34] life amen the more I recognize and the
[38:38] more I Surrender the more that's exposed
[38:40] and the more I lay down the more
[38:42] something keeps changing in me and I'm
[38:44] not what I used to
[38:46] be I hope you're not what you were 2
[38:49] three years ago I hope you're different
[38:50] than
[38:55] that see where we where we make our huge
[38:58] mistakes is where when we believe that
[39:00] we've come to maturity before we've come
[39:02] to
[39:03] maturity and we believe that we're just
[39:05] sitting in the church with the
[39:06] revelation of maturity and we're waiting
[39:08] for everybody else to catch up so we can
[39:10] all go
[39:12] home that's where we make a huge mistake
[39:16] sometimes and sometimes the one who
[39:18] feels are the most mature is the one
[39:19] who's actually the one who's suffering
[39:21] the most from pride and fear and
[39:25] self-preservation
[39:28] sometimes we're
[39:29] blind we see everything else well I
[39:32] don't say sometimes in reality we see
[39:35] everything else but the thing we miss is
[39:38] ourselves that's where the greatest
[39:40] blindness is the greatest blindness in
[39:44] our eyes is when we can't see
[39:51] ourselves it's amazing sometimes the
[39:53] most perfect people I ever meet are
[39:55] surrounded by flawed people and they
[39:58] know the flaws of everybody else but
[40:00] they don't
[40:02] realize that everybody else can see
[40:06] theirs so praise God when God begins to
[40:11] reveal them to us one by one we can say
[40:14] God I want to die to that I want to lay
[40:17] that down Lord I'm tired of defending
[40:21] myself I'm wore out with saving a
[40:25] reputation I have no reputation I don't
[40:27] want no reputation I don't I don't want
[40:30] a reputation because if I have a
[40:31] reputation then I have to defend a
[40:33] reputation I'm too tired to defend the
[40:37] reputation I just want to surrender and
[40:39] let God do whatever he wants to
[40:41] do and whatever anybody else thinks and
[40:44] whatever conclusion they want to come up
[40:45] with about me and about my life amen I
[40:49] want to get to the point I don't say I'm
[40:50] there yet but I want to get to the point
[40:52] where that doesn't matter as long as I
[40:54] know he's pleased with me then I'm okay
[40:58] if he's pleased with me even if
[41:00] everybody else misunderstands and
[41:02] doesn't agree and doesn't lie as long as
[41:03] I know he's pleased with me then I want
[41:05] that to be my
[41:09] satisfaction so we find that Jesus was a
[41:12] model
[41:13] friend he was a friend to his enemy so
[41:17] now when Billy Paul says you couldn't
[41:18] tell my my father's enemies from his
[41:21] friends I say praise God because that he
[41:23] was emulating Jesus Christ it didn't
[41:25] stop and William brandom we saw in Jesus
[41:28] Christ not even his disciples could tell
[41:30] his enemy that was among them from his
[41:32] friends and he knew who it was all
[41:36] along so it's not that the prophet it's
[41:39] not like we look at the prophet and say
[41:40] oh my goodness I want to have his life
[41:42] no he was reflecting the life of Jesus
[41:44] Christ he was bringing it in our day and
[41:46] showing in Fallen flesh that you can
[41:49] have the life that Jesus lived can be on
[41:51] display here did that make him perfect
[41:54] absolutely not we saw his mistakes too
[41:56] but that's part of the
[41:58] Perfection you say how are the mistakes
[42:00] part of the Perfection because
[42:01] Perfection is full maturity completeness
[42:04] Perfection is not sinlessness or
[42:05] flawlessness Perfection is completeness
[42:08] or maturity and we saw in the flaws he
[42:11] was corrected by the spirit of God and
[42:13] would come back and make it right that
[42:15] to me is
[42:19] perfection yes amen if he demonstrated
[42:23] flawlessness knowing he was sborn if he
[42:25] demonstrated of flawlessness then we
[42:27] would recognize There's Something
[42:30] Fishy but when we so openly saw his
[42:33] mistakes but we saw the correction we
[42:35] saw him make it right we saw the honesty
[42:37] we saw amen we saw him rebuked we saw
[42:40] him repented we saw all of that to me
[42:42] that was a display of perfection that's
[42:44] a Son of God who' come to adoption
[42:48] material and if it it wasn't just for
[42:50] him that was for me God showed that so I
[42:53] would know this is what I'm coming to
[42:57] yeah exactly right well I make mistakes
[42:59] a pile of them but God help me repent
[43:02] correct me by your spirit let me have
[43:04] that humility and that surrender that
[43:07] under rebuke I'll say Lord I'm
[43:11] sorry if we look at Luke let's go to
[43:16] Luke chapter
[43:25] 22
[43:32] I just want to say that I pray that I'm
[43:36] never the kind of believer that can pass
[43:40] the doctrinal
[43:41] exam and fail in the
[43:45] life I don't ever want to be that kind
[43:47] of
[43:48] believer that I can tell you what was
[43:51] preached in what sermon in what order
[43:53] and what year he preached what but I but
[43:56] the people around me don't even enjoy
[43:57] being around
[44:04] me don't want that to be my kind of
[44:08] life I'd rather people say you know I'm
[44:11] not sure sure brother Chad understands
[44:13] it all but you know what he sure is a
[44:15] nice brother yes he's a good friend he's
[44:20] loving he seems
[44:22] genuine that that would do me that would
[44:25] do my heart
[44:28] good Luke
[44:31] 22 verse
[44:36] 33 and he said unto him Lord I am ready
[44:38] to go with thee both into prison and to
[44:41] death who is this
[44:44] Peter
[44:46] Peter Peter who was confident Peter Who
[44:50] Loved God when Jesus said that that you
[44:53] all are going to forsake me Peter is so
[44:55] sure sure that he loves the Lord so much
[44:57] he's not going to forsake Him Peter
[44:59] makes this statement he said I'm ready
[45:01] to go with thee both into prison and to
[45:04] death and Jesus said I tell thee Peter
[45:06] the shall not Crow this day before
[45:08] Thou shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest
[45:11] me Peter thought that he loved the Lord
[45:15] and he did love the Lord I'm not want to
[45:17] take that away from Peter Peter loved
[45:18] the Lord Peter had a fervent desire and
[45:21] a love for the Lord amen and he loved
[45:23] him but we're going to find out that
[45:26] Peter actually still loved himself more
[45:28] than he loved Jesus right that's right
[45:31] not that he didn't love him but there
[45:33] was still too much self mixed
[45:35] in if we go to Matthew
[45:38] 26 back to where we were Matthew
[45:46] 26 and 73 we'll go down a little
[45:53] further and after a while came unto him
[45:55] they that that stood by and said Peter
[45:57] surely said to Peter surely thou also
[46:00] art one of them for thy speech berth
[46:01] thee then began he to curse and to swear
[46:04] saying I know not the man and
[46:06] immediately the crew and Peter
[46:08] remembered the word of Jesus which said
[46:10] unto him before the cck crow Thou shalt
[46:12] deny me Thrice and he went out and wept
[46:15] bitterly I I think it's amazing now that
[46:18] Peter all of a sudden his world comes
[46:20] crashing down he he he you know
[46:24] everything goes wrong contrary to what
[46:26] his thinking was and he thought that he
[46:28] would stand by the Lord he thought that
[46:29] he loved the Lord more than he loved
[46:31] everything else in the world Amen but
[46:33] when it really came down to the Press he
[46:35] found out that he was willing to forsake
[46:37] the Lord to save his own neck right to
[46:40] preserve his own life to preserve his
[46:41] own person he was willing to deny the
[46:44] Lord and when they didn't believe him he
[46:45] was willing to add cursings in on top of
[46:48] it and then when the grew he
[46:51] realized what he had done and he goes
[46:53] out and he repents and it's wonderful
[46:55] that Peter is broken now and we find
[46:57] after this the Lord comes to Peter and
[47:00] he restores him and when we come to see
[47:02] the Lord restoring Peter amen he comes
[47:04] to him by the Sea of tiberious and we
[47:06] have this whole thing where he says
[47:08] Peter does thou lovest me more than
[47:09] these and he repeats it three times amen
[47:12] because he denied the Lord
[47:13] Thrice and Jesus never shames
[47:18] Peter Peter was already
[47:21] ashamed he doesn't mock him he doesn't
[47:23] shame him he doesn't cast away from his
[47:26] presence he doesn't say he's not worthy
[47:28] to be a friend Jesus is the model
[47:31] friend when Jesus was forsaken when he
[47:35] was betrayed when he was forsaken when
[47:37] they all left him amen he never waited
[47:39] for them to come back to him to make it
[47:41] right he went to them right and he loved
[47:45] them amen and he never said anything
[47:48] about do you know what you did to me and
[47:50] you know how bad that hurt me and you
[47:53] know Jesus didn't do that
[47:56] you don't find him treating his
[47:57] disciples that way he comes to them he
[47:59] reveals himself to them he instructs
[48:01] them and he restores Peter back into
[48:04] fellowship with him when Peter wasn't
[48:05] able to do it Jesus did
[48:08] it he was the model
[48:11] friend and if Peter let say this way if
[48:14] Peter had done to me what he did to
[48:16] Jesus if he had done to
[48:19] you what would we
[48:21] do would we say nothing about it and
[48:24] just say Peter you're still my
[48:27] friend Peter do you love me that's what
[48:29] I thought do you love
[48:35] me this is where I want to be
[48:41] friends brother Bram says he he's he's
[48:44] going to give us some good instruction
[48:45] we're going to look now into some quotes
[48:47] and some scriptures where brother Bram
[48:49] gives us some outstanding
[48:51] instruction so we must love divinely
[48:54] love one another then you don't see your
[48:56] brother's mistake if he does make a
[48:59] mistake you never you look over the top
[49:01] of it and you love him anyhow see that's
[49:03] it love those that love you then does
[49:05] not the sinner the same thing but love
[49:07] those who doesn't love you that's what
[49:09] shows the spirit of God is in you
[49:11] because he loved you when you were his
[49:12] enemy and he loved you and that spirit's
[49:14] in you it'll make you love your enemy as
[49:16] you do your
[49:18] friend this is where it pretty
[49:23] tough and Jesus I would say he had every
[49:26] right to be offended at Judas Judah and
[49:28] he Judas and he had every right to be
[49:30] offended at Peter but he let he
[49:31] surrendered his life he made himself of
[49:34] no reputation he took on the form of a
[49:35] servant he lowered himself for
[49:37] Redemption amen and and he never he
[49:39] never held a grudge he never shamed
[49:41] anybody he never scold him he never
[49:43] mocked them he was a
[49:45] friend it's amazing Jesus never
[49:48] unfriended
[49:50] Judas where do you see in the Bible
[49:53] Jesus ever unfriended Judas right
[49:56] it was Judas who unfriended Jesus not
[49:58] Jesus who unfriended
[50:00] Judas he didn't unfriend Peter when
[50:03] Peter failed him he didn't underf
[50:05] unfriend the disciples when the
[50:06] disciples ran away amen it was never him
[50:09] that stopped being a friend it was
[50:11] always somebody else that stopped being
[50:13] his friend
[50:14] yes I said God help me that's the
[50:17] attitude I want to have every day of my
[50:19] life I don't want to go around cutting
[50:21] off relationships and not talking to you
[50:22] no more and not being a friend and
[50:24] giving you the cold shoulder and staying
[50:25] away from you amen my goodness God help
[50:28] me never to do a thing like that amen
[50:30] but help me to stand and remain a friend
[50:33] regardless of what anybody does to me
[50:35] let me give up my
[50:38] life to be like
[50:41] this
[50:43] amen let's go to John chapter
[50:46] 12 I'm not going to hit every one of
[50:49] these scriptures but I'm going to hit a
[50:50] few of them
[50:51] here John chapter 12 or 13 sorry John
[50:55] chapter
[50:58] 13 verse
[51:03] 34 a new commandment I give unto you
[51:06] John CH
[51:08] 13:34 a new commandment I give unto you
[51:11] that ye love one another as I have loved
[51:13] you that you also love one another but
[51:16] this shall all men know that you are my
[51:17] my disciples if you have love one for
[51:21] another here's what brother bam says in
[51:23] the beginning of Christ is the mystery
[51:24] of God revealed we all know it I've read
[51:26] it before but I want to take some time
[51:28] in it in this context and brother
[51:30] brandham when he's coming to the
[51:31] beginning he gives instruction to the
[51:33] church and and here he is he's he's this
[51:37] is after the seals after the Revelation
[51:39] he's now going into Christ as the
[51:41] mystery of God revealed which to me is
[51:43] the one of the greatest Revelations of
[51:45] all time and in the beginning he starts
[51:48] instructing the church and this
[51:49] instruction is so pivotable PIV pivotal
[51:52] even at this
[51:54] time he says says love one another above
[51:57] everything love one another no matter
[52:00] what the devil tries to say now you're
[52:02] all one great big sweet group now but
[52:04] remember my warning see Satan won't let
[52:07] that stay that way no sir he'll shoot
[52:10] everything if he has to bring somebody
[52:12] in to make his Target he'll bring some
[52:14] critic or unbeliever in and sit him down
[52:17] and cause him to fellowship with you
[52:19] under the quietness in things and then
[52:21] he'll shoot that guy with some kind of
[52:23] poison stuff and he'll start through the
[52:25] the church with it don't you take sides
[52:28] with it don't you have nothing to do
[52:31] with anything else you stay right loving
[52:33] and sweet and kind to one another pray
[52:36] for that man that he'll be saved too or
[52:38] that woman orever who it is just pray
[52:40] for them and stick one with another and
[52:43] stay with your pastor see he's the
[52:45] shepherd and you give him respects he'll
[52:46] lead you through because he's ordained
[52:48] of God to do so now do you remember that
[52:51] the enemy will
[52:53] come and when he does just cling that
[52:56] much closer together will the enemy come
[52:59] brother B said he would you know we
[53:02] think sometimes we're watching waiting
[53:04] for the enemy to come and not realizing
[53:07] he's coming all the
[53:09] time he's probing every Avenue he's he's
[53:12] jiggling every door to see if there's a
[53:14] window cracked and not he's probing
[53:16] every one of our lives trying to find an
[53:19] inlet so it's not like we'll sit here
[53:21] and wait for him to he's coming he's
[53:23] constantly coming he's constantly
[53:24] waiting for an advantage Amen to move in
[53:27] and work something amen but brother B's
[53:29] telling us what to do amen don't take
[53:32] sides don't begin to talk don't
[53:34] discredit you just stay sweet loving and
[53:37] kind that's the secret he's giving us
[53:40] the secret but the secret is death to
[53:42] self and you know what happens the first
[53:44] time we start seeing something like this
[53:46] take place all of a sudden we want to
[53:48] outsmart the
[53:51] devil we want to find out and we want to
[53:54] counteract act this counteracting this
[53:56] now they're bringing this in and they're
[53:58] starting a clannish thing here and
[54:00] they're Whispering a secret over here
[54:01] now I've got to counteract that and I've
[54:03] got to move into this and I and brother
[54:05] bam told us the only thing to do is lay
[54:07] down your life and forget about it don't
[54:09] try to preserve yourself don't try to
[54:11] save yourself just be sweet loving and
[54:15] kind I tell you I've failed so many
[54:18] times to protecting myself I've given up
[54:20] the
[54:21] job it's better just to
[54:23] surrender and say God I'm trusting
[54:26] you I'm trusting you you save me you
[54:30] defend me you protect me you preserve us
[54:32] I can't protect
[54:36] myself so when the enemy will come and
[54:39] when he does just cling that much closer
[54:41] together and the one that the devil is
[54:43] using for an En enemy will either get
[54:45] out or come in and be one of you that's
[54:47] all don't never Clan among one or talk
[54:50] and make yourself clannish we are
[54:53] one I couldn't say left left hand I'm
[54:55] mad at you see this happens so many
[54:58] times in families it happens in churches
[55:00] it happens in
[55:01] workplaces something just gets stirred
[55:03] up and all of a sudden a little group
[55:05] starts to talk to one another and
[55:07] they've got the problems of everybody
[55:08] else in the workplace figured
[55:11] out that's what brother B's talking
[55:13] about don't do that amen we're all
[55:16] one we're not going to Clan up we're not
[55:19] going to draw aside we're not going to
[55:20] treat anybody indifferent we're not
[55:22] going to try brother B said the one who
[55:24] the devil shoots with poison and goes
[55:26] through the church you're not to try to
[55:27] push him out you're to draw him
[55:30] in that's what he
[55:34] said don't ever Clan among or talk and
[55:36] make yourself clannish we are one I
[55:38] couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you
[55:40] I'm going to take you away cuz you're
[55:41] not my not a right hand he's my left
[55:44] hand I want him to stay there even the
[55:46] little tip of my finger I want to stay
[55:48] right there every little part of my body
[55:50] stay right there and God wants us as a
[55:52] body of Believers to stay right exactly
[55:54] with one another another right at with
[55:56] one another you find out sometimes there
[55:59] there'll be something to rise up between
[56:01] one family and another
[56:02] family little misunderstanding a little
[56:05] misinterpretation of something that
[56:07] happened and all of the sudden well I'll
[56:09] say cold war because we're Christians we
[56:10] don't break out in the full-blown open
[56:14] war is that right we don't yell and
[56:17] scream and call each other names but
[56:18] Cold War sets in cuz one family gotten
[56:22] offended at something another family did
[56:24] or Miss interpreted or misjudged a
[56:26] situation and all of a sudden
[56:29] they you know what we're supposed to do
[56:31] in that situation get that much closer
[56:34] together come together and don't let the
[56:37] devil and most of the time you're going
[56:39] to find out that it's an absolute 100%
[56:43] misunderstanding and if it's not and a
[56:46] brother Did You Wrong brother B said
[56:48] forget about it never mention it just
[56:49] love them
[56:52] anyways so either you can take this not
[56:55] notion either they didn't know what they
[56:57] were doing and I misunderstand the
[56:58] situation or they knew exactly what they
[57:00] were doing but my action has to be the
[57:02] same either way so then it comes down to
[57:05] the fact that it doesn't matter it
[57:06] doesn't matter if they did it
[57:07] intentionally or it doesn't matter if
[57:09] they did it inadvertently my reaction
[57:11] must be the same
[57:13] reaction see if we can do this in our
[57:16] families and we can do this in the
[57:17] church and we can do this in our
[57:19] marriages and with our friendships amen
[57:20] you're going to find that we're going to
[57:22] close the doors to the devil where he
[57:25] doesn't have easy access to slip in and
[57:27] cause
[57:30] disruption now he goes on he says now
[57:32] you got tapes on that you got tapes on
[57:35] what we believe you got tapes on
[57:37] discipline in the church how we behave
[57:39] ourselves in the Church of God how we
[57:41] got to come here together and sit
[57:42] together in Heavenly places don't stay
[57:44] home if God's in your heart you can't
[57:46] hardly wait for them doors to open out
[57:48] yonder to get in here to fellowship with
[57:50] your brothers if you don't don't feel
[57:52] that way then I tell you it's time you
[57:54] got to pray
[57:56] cuz we're in the last days where the
[57:57] Bible exhorted us to much more as we see
[58:00] that day approaching to love one another
[58:02] with Christian love and divine love to
[58:04] assemble ourselves together in Heavenly
[58:06] places in Christ Jesus and love one
[58:08] another this will all men know you are
[58:10] my disciples when you have love one for
[58:12] another that's right stay right together
[58:15] if the brother you think he's a little
[58:17] wrong or the sister say Lord don't let
[58:20] me never have the root of bitterness
[58:22] spring up because it'll affect him and
[58:24] it'll take Christ right out of my
[58:27] life I'm going to repeat that cuz that
[58:30] is so
[58:32] profound the brother if you think he's a
[58:35] little wrong now listen you're going to
[58:38] think a brother's a little wrong or a
[58:39] sister sure if it hasn't happened today
[58:42] it may happen tomorrow or next week
[58:43] because we're human beings and we're all
[58:45] still making mistakes and we're all
[58:47] misinterpreting one another and you're
[58:48] going to think your brother is wrong so
[58:50] what do I do
[58:53] yes this he said say you pray say Lord
[58:56] don't let me never have the root of
[58:58] bitterness spring up because it'll
[59:00] affect him my brother or sister and
[59:02] it'll take Christ right out of my
[59:05] life why because Christ is not going to
[59:09] inhabit the heart that's full of
[59:11] bitterness is not a welcome place for
[59:18] him he said that poison acids of malice
[59:21] and jealousy and hatred that will just
[59:23] take the Holy Spirit right away from you
[59:26] it will run him from the Tabernacle here
[59:28] it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it
[59:30] away from here hurt your pastor it'll do
[59:32] everything see don't you do that you
[59:35] just wax that much closer together draw
[59:37] up take the Buckle as the brother
[59:39] testified a minister here the other
[59:40] night about having a buckle seeing it in
[59:42] a vision that buckles on the whole armor
[59:44] of God just pull her on tighten up move
[59:47] right up close to one another love one
[59:49] another anyhow talk nice about one
[59:52] another say nice things about one one
[59:54] another and then God will bless you I
[59:58] want God to bless me I want the
[1:00:00] blessings of God to be heaped upon me
[1:00:02] and you say h you oh my
[1:00:05] goodness they asked brother Brenham one
[1:00:07] time we'll get to that quote in a minute
[1:00:08] he says how can you let people say such
[1:00:10] evil things about you he says you don't
[1:00:12] live for yourself right that's how you
[1:00:14] do it you don't live for yourself that's
[1:00:17] right praise
[1:00:19] God I want to read two scriptures out of
[1:00:21] Proverbs Pro let's go back to Proverbs
[1:00:23] and start in Proverbs 16
[1:00:38] Proverbs
[1:00:42] 16:28 says a forward man SE is strife
[1:00:47] and a Whisperer separateth cheap
[1:00:50] friends what brother Brenham telling us
[1:00:52] is just not his opinion he's speaking
[1:00:53] straight script scripture right to begin
[1:00:56] to talk and to say did you know what
[1:00:58] that one did and did you hear and I
[1:01:00] mentioned this before but but I'll tell
[1:01:02] you I mean it I just like to expose the
[1:01:05] enemy when somebody comes and says did
[1:01:08] you hear what's going on such and such
[1:01:09] family I'm only telling you so you can
[1:01:12] pray I'm telling you I don't believe
[1:01:14] that statement one drop I don't believe
[1:01:17] it they're using that a religious mask
[1:01:20] to gosp gossip I'm only telling you so
[1:01:23] you can pray why do you have to tell me
[1:01:25] to pray you pray do you not believe God
[1:01:27] hears you when you
[1:01:29] pray and why do you have to tell me all
[1:01:31] the details if you want me to pray why
[1:01:32] can't you see just pray for this family
[1:01:34] I think they're having a hard time why
[1:01:35] do you have to give me all the juicy
[1:01:37] details of what might be going wrong see
[1:01:39] it's a mask for
[1:01:41] gossip and that's the problem because
[1:01:43] just as soon as you go and repeat it and
[1:01:45] you don't have the details right and one
[1:01:47] tells another one so that they can pray
[1:01:49] and one tells another one so they can
[1:01:50] pray pretty real you find out that
[1:01:52] nobody's praying but everybody's
[1:01:53] relaying what we we need to pray about
[1:01:56] and the prayer request gets more lip
[1:01:58] service than the actual prayer for the
[1:02:04] need help us
[1:02:06] God help us and we're going to read some
[1:02:10] more let's go to Proverbs 179 I I I mean
[1:02:13] I got ahead of my scripture but praise
[1:02:15] God anyhow Proverbs
[1:02:18] 179 he that cover a transgression
[1:02:21] seeketh love yes but he that
[1:02:23] repeatthedose separateth very friends
[1:02:27] yes praise be to God let's go over to
[1:02:38] Ephesians we are not here to expose each
[1:02:40] other's flaws we are here to cover for
[1:02:43] one another and love each
[1:02:46] other that's why I think the symbology
[1:02:48] of feet washing is so
[1:02:50] important because as we wash one
[1:02:53] another's feet you realize that in in in
[1:02:56] that day when they would go to the bath
[1:02:58] there was communal bath houses and they
[1:02:59] would go to the bath house and they
[1:03:01] would be cleaned and this is what Jesus
[1:03:03] is saying amen because he told him
[1:03:05] they're clean by the word that I've
[1:03:06] spoken unto you and he says then when he
[1:03:08] comes to the Last Supper he say you are
[1:03:09] clean but not all amen just saving your
[1:03:12] feet and what he's referring to is the
[1:03:14] communal bath house where they would go
[1:03:15] and they would get clean and then they
[1:03:17] would come back to their apartment or to
[1:03:19] the house or wherever they're staying
[1:03:20] and on the way back they would pick up
[1:03:22] some dust or dirt on the feet they've
[1:03:24] been cleansed but in their Journey
[1:03:26] Through the world they picked up a
[1:03:28] little bit of dirt and now Jesus was
[1:03:29] going to kneel down and wash that little
[1:03:32] bit of dirt for by transgressing the
[1:03:34] World by not
[1:03:36] transgressing what am I trying to say
[1:03:38] traveling through the
[1:03:40] world so he washes that bit off him and
[1:03:43] and he says you're clean he already told
[1:03:44] him you're clean by the word I spoken
[1:03:46] unto you amen he already says sanctify
[1:03:48] them by thy truth Thy word is true they
[1:03:50] are already clean but there's a journey
[1:03:52] in life where we pick up dirt along the
[1:03:54] way and Jesus come to wash that off his
[1:03:57] disciples then he says you wash each
[1:04:00] other I'm not here to criticize your
[1:04:02] dirty feet my job is to get down and
[1:04:05] take your dirt with my own hands and
[1:04:07] wash it off of you Amen to help you as
[1:04:09] my brother and you come and wash my feet
[1:04:12] so when we have feet washing it's not
[1:04:14] just a tradition it's not we come once a
[1:04:16] month we then we don't come begrudgingly
[1:04:18] amen it's symbolic of what we're
[1:04:20] supposed to be living on a daily basis
[1:04:23] I'm not here to take pictures of your
[1:04:25] feet amen and post them on the internet
[1:04:27] and see my brother he spped in something
[1:04:31] there come on now it's better if I just
[1:04:34] say hey brother I think you might have
[1:04:36] stepped in something come here let me
[1:04:37] wash your
[1:04:40] feet he said like I said these things
[1:04:43] aren't profound but they're
[1:04:44] profound they're simple but they're The
[1:04:46] Stumbling Stones they're the easy things
[1:04:49] but it's the place we're failing in yes
[1:04:53] sir
[1:04:55] but I don't think we're meant to fail
[1:04:59] forever praise God Ephesians chapter
[1:05:05] 4:31 Ephesians chapter
[1:05:10] 4:31 he says let all bitterness and
[1:05:12] wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[1:05:14] speaking be put away from you with all
[1:05:16] malice and be ye kind one to another
[1:05:18] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[1:05:21] as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven
[1:05:23] you
[1:05:25] I love when he says forgive one another
[1:05:27] even as God for Christ sake have
[1:05:28] forgiven you and the question is how did
[1:05:30] God forgive me yes did he give did he
[1:05:33] forgive me before I asked him to or
[1:05:37] after did he forgive me when I was clean
[1:05:39] or when I was
[1:05:41] dirty did he forgive me when I come back
[1:05:43] and said forgive me or did he forgive me
[1:05:45] before I ever asked and we're supposed
[1:05:47] to forgive one another the same way God
[1:05:49] has forgiven us for Christ's sake so can
[1:05:52] I for Christ's sake forgive you sure if
[1:05:55] God for Christ's sake can forgive me
[1:05:57] then I for Christ's sake can forgive you
[1:05:59] the same way he forgave me and did and
[1:06:02] did God ever ask you to pay for your
[1:06:04] wrongs no Jesus paid for your wrongs so
[1:06:07] why would I ask you to pay for your
[1:06:08] wrong against me I should forgive you
[1:06:11] the same way I've been
[1:06:12] forgiven if I've been freely forgiven I
[1:06:15] should freely forgive and I shouldn't
[1:06:17] demand that you meet my requirements for
[1:06:19] forgiveness and you pay back and you
[1:06:21] make it right right say who would ever
[1:06:24] say that it's exactly what you say when
[1:06:27] you say well I'll forgive you but I'll
[1:06:28] never forget it and I can't know that I
[1:06:30] can be a friend like that again and blah
[1:06:32] blah blah blah blah what you're doing is
[1:06:34] still holding somebody in contempt and
[1:06:36] God never forgave you that
[1:06:41] way praise
[1:06:45] God so when Paul says I press toward the
[1:06:48] mark of the high calling it's a high
[1:06:52] calling but it's the call calling for
[1:06:54] the elect in this
[1:06:57] age remember Peter asked Jesus said how
[1:07:00] many times should I forgive my brother
[1:07:02] when he's offended me we learned this as
[1:07:04] a child seven times no seven what did he
[1:07:07] say until 70 times
[1:07:10] s my goodness I can't count that high
[1:07:15] without a recording
[1:07:17] device I would forget if you made 490
[1:07:20] times or not and that's the
[1:07:22] point yes point is I'm not supposed to
[1:07:26] hold an offense against anyone supposed
[1:07:29] to
[1:07:30] forgive not supposed to hold a grudge
[1:07:33] not supposed to hold bitterness I'm not
[1:07:34] supposed to Remember The Faults I'm not
[1:07:37] supposed to hold on to those things I'm
[1:07:40] not supposed to repeat it or speak about
[1:07:42] it but if I seek love I'm to cover a
[1:07:45] transgression yes not to expose
[1:07:48] it brother B said in 1958 in the baptism
[1:07:52] of the Holy Spirit he said and there's
[1:07:54] nothing wrong there was nothing wrong
[1:07:55] with any of the members brother B said
[1:07:57] he was going around fixing up little
[1:07:59] fusses that had been in the church he
[1:08:01] mentions it at a couple places in the
[1:08:02] same area in 1958 towards the end of
[1:08:05] 1958 and he said there's nothing wrong
[1:08:07] there was nothing wrong with any of the
[1:08:09] members so that's amazing statement that
[1:08:11] he comes and makes because there was
[1:08:13] little fusses he had to go straighten up
[1:08:14] but he said there was nothing wrong with
[1:08:16] any of the members there everyone fine
[1:08:18] men and women if they could just realize
[1:08:20] that that's the devil gets between the
[1:08:22] people that's exactly right it's not the
[1:08:25] people if you can let a brother see that
[1:08:28] then he won't hold enmity against the
[1:08:30] other fellow he'll feel bad he'll feel
[1:08:33] like well that's I feel sorry for my
[1:08:35] brother see if he did do wrong why it
[1:08:38] wasn't the brother it was the devil that
[1:08:39] did that amen you say well this guy did
[1:08:42] a certain certain thing your brother
[1:08:44] didn't do that your sister didn't do
[1:08:46] that that was the devil got into them
[1:08:48] that did it so don't blame the brother
[1:08:50] the sister blame the devil that's the
[1:08:52] one who caused it yeah
[1:08:55] amen and brother B said if you can get
[1:08:57] somebody to realize this they won't have
[1:08:59] enmity but they'll feel
[1:09:01] sorry if you can get to the place where
[1:09:04] somebody actually says something against
[1:09:06] you I mean they said something wrong and
[1:09:08] they said something hurtful and they
[1:09:09] shouldn't have said it they
[1:09:10] misunderstood a situation they repeated
[1:09:12] something wrong if you can get to the
[1:09:14] place to recognize this is a tactic of
[1:09:16] the devil and I'm not going to fall so
[1:09:19] easily to the devil's WS but I realized
[1:09:22] that my brother was just a tool in the
[1:09:24] devil's hands it wasn't him that brother
[1:09:26] loves
[1:09:27] me how do you know that brother loves
[1:09:30] you because if he loves Christ he loves
[1:09:32] me he can't help
[1:09:34] it sometimes we've got to fly a little
[1:09:37] higher On Eagle's Wings and have Eagle
[1:09:38] Vengeance and get out of the Cardinal
[1:09:40] and stop with all the offense and the
[1:09:42] hurt and he said and she said and fly a
[1:09:44] little higher and find out who's moving
[1:09:46] the chest
[1:09:48] pieces and you realize now I feel sorry
[1:09:51] for my brother and you know why I feel
[1:09:52] sorry for my brother because I'm going
[1:09:54] to forgive him I'm going to let it go
[1:09:56] and I'm never going to mention it but
[1:09:57] someday I know that brother's going to
[1:09:59] feel sorry for what he
[1:10:04] did and now I feel for him with
[1:10:06] compassion I'm not angry I'm not upset I
[1:10:08] don't want him to get in trouble I don't
[1:10:10] want God to spank him I don't want
[1:10:12] lightning to fall on him I don't want to
[1:10:13] get in a car accident on the way to work
[1:10:15] I really want to forgive him and let him
[1:10:17] go and ask God to forgive him and let
[1:10:18] him go and realize my brother didn't
[1:10:20] mean to and I know someday he'll be
[1:10:22] sorry for that and when that day comes I
[1:10:25] know what it's like cuz I've been sorry
[1:10:26] for things I did wrong and I know how
[1:10:29] horrible it is and how bad you feel and
[1:10:31] how sh shamed you are and how you how
[1:10:33] how you feel like you failed God and
[1:10:34] your brother and I know that my
[1:10:36] brother's going to go down that same
[1:10:37] road and I'm feeling sorry for him now
[1:10:40] see you realize I'm getting the I'm I'm
[1:10:42] getting the the the the the pity off of
[1:10:47] myself and I'm turning it outward and
[1:10:49] saying God help my brother he didn't
[1:10:52] mean to do that my sister
[1:10:54] you
[1:10:55] know what let's say that you assume that
[1:10:59] they didn't mean to but really they
[1:11:01] did how will it hurt you to assume that
[1:11:04] they did they
[1:11:06] didn't I would rather be found in error
[1:11:08] assuming my brother and sister didn't
[1:11:10] mean to then always in error assuming
[1:11:12] they
[1:11:15] did well I just don't want to be a fool
[1:11:17] I don't be taken for a fool I'd rather
[1:11:19] be taken for a fool than actually act
[1:11:21] like a
[1:11:22] fool amen prise God I'd rather be taken
[1:11:26] for a foolish childish doesn't
[1:11:29] understand what's going on around him
[1:11:30] brother Chad just doesn't get
[1:11:32] it I'd rather be in that position than
[1:11:35] be the one who's wise and understand I
[1:11:37] see what you're doing you're
[1:11:38] manipulating you're and I'm calling it
[1:11:39] out and I'm wrong half the
[1:11:43] time then you Heap shame and foolishness
[1:11:45] upon yourself say God help
[1:11:49] us we got to recognize that these are
[1:11:51] the tactics of the enemy not tactics of
[1:11:53] my brother brother and
[1:11:56] sister Proverbs 10:12 I'll just read it
[1:11:59] to you Proverbs 1012 says hatred
[1:12:00] stirreth up stries but love
[1:12:06] coverthe
[1:12:07] God while we're in Ephesians let's jump
[1:12:10] over to First
[1:12:13] Peter 1 Peter
[1:12:22] 1:22
[1:12:25] the things that we're talking about this
[1:12:27] is the church I want to be a part of
[1:12:29] Amen the church that can apply the
[1:12:30] principles that brother bham gave us the
[1:12:32] scripture gave us the example of Jesus
[1:12:34] Christ that and that's the kind of
[1:12:35] person I want to be that's the kind of
[1:12:37] friend I want to be to you and that's
[1:12:40] the kind of friend I want to have that's
[1:12:41] the kind of church I want to go to
[1:12:42] that's the kind of family I want that's
[1:12:44] the kind of marriage I
[1:12:46] want this is what we want yes in 1 Peter
[1:12:50] 1:22 it says seeing you have purified
[1:12:53] your soul souls and obeying the truth
[1:12:55] through the spirit unto unfeigned that
[1:12:58] means not pretentious or not fake
[1:13:00] genuine unfeigned love of the Brethren
[1:13:03] see that you love one another with a
[1:13:05] pure heart
[1:13:07] fervently that means
[1:13:09] intensely how are we supposed to love
[1:13:11] each other without pretense not faking
[1:13:14] we're not supposed to fake it and if you
[1:13:15] got to that place where you're having to
[1:13:16] fake it it's time to get on your knees
[1:13:18] and say God get me to the place where
[1:13:19] I'm not faking it with this brother or
[1:13:21] sister because you got be real and God
[1:13:24] knows when you're real and most of the
[1:13:25] time the other people know when you're
[1:13:27] real too this isn't about being
[1:13:28] pretentious this is not about mockery
[1:13:30] this is not about playing a role and
[1:13:32] acting out a part that you don't
[1:13:34] genuinely
[1:13:35] believe but it's about realizing I have
[1:13:38] ought against this brother I have ought
[1:13:39] against this sister and I need God to
[1:13:42] take this out of my heart because it'll
[1:13:43] it'll hurt them and it'll take the
[1:13:45] Christ right out of my
[1:13:48] life it's more serious sometimes than we
[1:13:52] we really right think about we we think
[1:13:54] about sometimes the the things we got to
[1:13:56] watch out for the big the big blazing S
[1:14:00] no it's the little foxes that spoil the
[1:14:07] vine but this is the fellowship I want
[1:14:10] to be in this is the fellowship I want
[1:14:13] to give this is the kind of brother I
[1:14:16] want to
[1:14:17] be and I I know I failed you all
[1:14:20] probably a thousand times in this but
[1:14:21] I'm telling you this is the brother I
[1:14:23] want to be and these are the Brethren I
[1:14:25] want you to be I want to dwell in
[1:14:28] Brothers in a fellowship of brothers and
[1:14:30] sisters who have this is their greatest
[1:14:34] desire
[1:14:36] amen let's go to John
[1:14:38] 15 now I just want to I started here and
[1:14:42] I want to get down to the real heart of
[1:14:44] this
[1:14:48] again John chapter
[1:14:52] 15
[1:14:54] verse
[1:14:58] 12 Jesus says this is my commandment
[1:15:01] that you love one another as I have
[1:15:03] loved you greater love hath no man than
[1:15:06] this that a man lay down his life for
[1:15:09] his
[1:15:12] friends
[1:15:14] now Jesus is telling us this is my
[1:15:18] commandment to
[1:15:21] you we know when we read no greater love
[1:15:24] has no man than this that a man lay down
[1:15:26] his life for his friends we know that he
[1:15:28] is going to demonstrate that he is going
[1:15:30] to act it out and we're going to watch
[1:15:31] that happen in Jesus Christ but he
[1:15:34] didn't just say I'm going to do this he
[1:15:37] was telling us to do this this wasn't a
[1:15:41] commandment for him although he would
[1:15:42] flesh it out and demonstrate it this was
[1:15:45] a commandment for you and I let's read
[1:15:48] it again this is my commandment that you
[1:15:50] love one another as I have loved you
[1:15:53] that means the same way yes amen love
[1:15:56] one another the same way I Loved You
[1:15:58] Then he goes on to say greater love hath
[1:16:00] no man than this that a man laid down
[1:16:03] his life for his
[1:16:05] friends if we're going to love one
[1:16:07] another the same way he loved us then we
[1:16:11] are going to have to lay down our lives
[1:16:14] for our
[1:16:16] friends we are going you say am I going
[1:16:20] to
[1:16:21] go get shot
[1:16:23] be
[1:16:24] executed maybe probably
[1:16:28] not but Jesus gave up his life in so
[1:16:31] many other ways brother B said he had a
[1:16:34] right to a home he had a right to a wife
[1:16:37] he wanted to live with his disciples he
[1:16:40] didn't want to leave but he gave up all
[1:16:41] of his rights because the love he had
[1:16:43] for the brethren in obedience to the
[1:16:46] father he lost his reputation his glory
[1:16:50] everything he gave it all up yes because
[1:16:53] he loved
[1:16:55] me he allowed vile men on to spit in his
[1:17:01] face he didn't do anything about it he
[1:17:04] allowed a mock Kangaroo Court an
[1:17:07] absolute
[1:17:09] foolishness try him with with no good
[1:17:12] case no clear-cut case no agreeing
[1:17:15] Witnesses it was a mockery and he didn't
[1:17:17] do anything to defend
[1:17:19] himself he didn't he didn't ched anybody
[1:17:24] he didn't defend himself he didn't
[1:17:26] protect himself he didn't protect his
[1:17:28] reputation he didn't do anything and why
[1:17:30] did he do that he did that for me and he
[1:17:33] asked me to love you the same way he
[1:17:34] loved
[1:17:37] me you know sometimes we separate
[1:17:41] friendship we we saw here David's Act of
[1:17:44] friendship was rejected because of
[1:17:47] Suspicion they misinterpreted what he
[1:17:50] wanted and they rejected and they
[1:17:51] created a big mess
[1:17:55] sometimes there's fear that caus us to
[1:17:57] break relationship we fear somebody's
[1:17:59] not being genuine or fear that we're
[1:18:01] going to lose our reputation sometimes
[1:18:03] our friends shame us because of their
[1:18:06] failure and we distance ourselves from
[1:18:09] them that's wrong amen we do that to
[1:18:13] family members sometimes they shame us
[1:18:16] so we distance ourselves from
[1:18:19] them that is not how Jesus loved me
[1:18:24] have I shamed him yes have I brought a
[1:18:27] reproach against his name
[1:18:31] yes sometimes we'll be ashamed of one
[1:18:34] another sometimes you'll be ashamed
[1:18:37] maybe of your spouse maybe you'll be
[1:18:38] ashamed of one of your children maybe a
[1:18:41] child will be ashamed of their
[1:18:43] parent that's no time to break
[1:18:46] friendship and save your reputation and
[1:18:48] pull away yes amen that's not how Jesus
[1:18:52] loved me
[1:18:56] what is that all about
[1:18:58] anyways it's about Pride yes it comes
[1:19:03] down to rank nasty Pride yes that's
[1:19:08] right that I don't want to fellowship
[1:19:10] with a brother anymore because that
[1:19:11] brother made a big mistake and I don't
[1:19:12] want to look like I'm associated with
[1:19:13] that I don't want people to on Lord
[1:19:17] Jesus help
[1:19:19] us and we've done it and put religious
[1:19:21] labels on top of it come on now
[1:19:25] yes yes I don't want to be that kind of
[1:19:28] friend I don't want to be the kind of
[1:19:30] friend that never calls when something
[1:19:32] bad happens but only calls when it's
[1:19:37] good that's not how Jesus loved his
[1:19:42] disciples and that's not how I want to
[1:19:44] love you and that's not how I want you
[1:19:46] to love me because none of us are going
[1:19:49] to make it perfect and we're not all
[1:19:52] going to make it look good
[1:19:54] right but I'm not I don't want to pull
[1:19:56] away from you because you make a mistake
[1:19:59] and I don't want you to pull away from
[1:20:00] me cuz I make a
[1:20:02] mistake but I want us to love one
[1:20:04] another and no greater love has any man
[1:20:07] than this that he lays down his life for
[1:20:09] a friend can we give up our reputation
[1:20:12] for each other can we give up our
[1:20:15] reputation for our spouses can we give
[1:20:16] up our reputation for our
[1:20:18] children say God help
[1:20:21] me sometimes we separate friendship for
[1:20:25] Envy cuz a brother has a position or
[1:20:28] he's gotten more attention or something
[1:20:30] and and we don't realize it but we begin
[1:20:32] to pull away and because it's envy that
[1:20:34] comes right back to the same old nasty
[1:20:37] Pride but greater love has no man than
[1:20:39] this that he laid down his life for his
[1:20:41] brother if my brother gets something he
[1:20:44] gets rewarded somehow by God or he
[1:20:46] receives a gift or he gets a position I
[1:20:48] want to be happy for him I want him to
[1:20:50] go higher than me I want him to have
[1:20:52] more than I have I want that kind of
[1:20:58] love there's so many things that this
[1:21:00] pride and fear does
[1:21:03] yes causes us to try to preserve
[1:21:06] ourselves save our
[1:21:09] reputation become envious become jealous
[1:21:12] we become
[1:21:14] suspicious that's not pure love that's
[1:21:16] all self right
[1:21:19] and that's what we're trying to do is
[1:21:22] die
[1:21:24] I've been given life I've been given
[1:21:26] breath in and out of my lungs I've been
[1:21:28] given a life in this Dimension so that I
[1:21:30] can by my own choice die that's right
[1:21:34] I've been given an existence in this
[1:21:36] life so that I by my own choosing can
[1:21:38] choose to die yes I can die a thousand
[1:21:42] different ways I can die thousands of
[1:21:44] different times I can die when somebody
[1:21:47] mocks me I can die when somebody
[1:21:49] criticizes I can die when somebody it
[1:21:53] questions me I can die when somebody
[1:21:55] misunderstands me I can die when
[1:21:57] somebody falsely accuses me I can
[1:22:01] die we get thousands of opportunities to
[1:22:04] die this isn't a one-time death this is
[1:22:06] a dying out to self and God is going to
[1:22:09] make sure that as a iron sharpeneth iron
[1:22:12] so does a friend sharpeneth the
[1:22:13] countenance of his friend that sometimes
[1:22:15] there's going to be some rubbing so that
[1:22:17] you and I can die there's going to be
[1:22:19] some mistakes so that you and I can die
[1:22:21] there's going to be things that don't
[1:22:23] always go right but things that can go
[1:22:24] wrong so that you and I can die yes
[1:22:27] exactly right I say God help me
[1:22:30] die to all this self that I'm so sick
[1:22:34] of that's why friends when you get to
[1:22:36] looking at this subject when you really
[1:22:38] get to looking at all of these subjects
[1:22:39] and the depth of it and the reality of
[1:22:42] what we've been called to to actually
[1:22:43] live the life of Jesus Christ in this
[1:22:45] flesh when you look at it then you
[1:22:47] realize without him I'm finished if it's
[1:22:50] not his Spirit living in me if I don't
[1:22:52] surren surrender and give up myself and
[1:22:54] keep giving myself to him keep receiving
[1:22:56] his word and letting it strip me I'm
[1:22:59] finished and that's why I tell you that
[1:23:02] I'm not I I'm not dreading the day that
[1:23:05] I pass out of this life either through a
[1:23:07] translation or through death I'm looking
[1:23:09] forward to it
[1:23:14] yes praise
[1:23:16] God I want to read this one more quote
[1:23:18] as we close it's that message it's the
[1:23:21] message that day on Calvary I've been
[1:23:23] listening to that message I absolutely
[1:23:24] have been loving this
[1:23:26] message says now what must we do now the
[1:23:28] first thing that I want to say is Jesus
[1:23:30] never lived for himself his life was
[1:23:33] spent for others that's perfectly
[1:23:34] eternal life when you say you go to
[1:23:37] church and you do good things that's
[1:23:38] fine but when you live your life to
[1:23:40] yourself you Haven an eternal life
[1:23:42] eternal life is living for others it
[1:23:44] proved it when he came in the Lamb of
[1:23:46] God he lived and had eternal life
[1:23:47] because he did not live for himself he
[1:23:50] lived for others and you receive eternal
[1:23:52] Life by receiving that day and you don't
[1:23:54] live for yourself no more you live for
[1:23:56] others someone said how can you stand
[1:23:58] and let anybody call you such bad names
[1:24:01] you don't live for yourself you live for
[1:24:02] others that you might redeem that man
[1:24:05] you become sons and the trouble of it is
[1:24:07] the church has forgot they were Sons you
[1:24:10] are Sons you're taking Christ's place
[1:24:13] you are Sons so don't live for yourself
[1:24:16] live for others so well brother random I
[1:24:19] can live for this brother because he
[1:24:20] sure is a nice man that's not it live
[1:24:22] for that man who hates you live for that
[1:24:24] person who'd kill you if they could
[1:24:26] that's what they' done to him they
[1:24:28] killed him and he died that he might
[1:24:29] save them that's eternal life when you
[1:24:32] get that's in your bosom you're facing
[1:24:34] heaven then but you sacrifice your own
[1:24:37] things give them up like the sheep gives
[1:24:39] its wool you look on towards
[1:24:42] Calvary if we ever if we ever find
[1:24:45] ourselves in a spot where we're
[1:24:50] offended have you ever been offended
[1:24:53] I've been offended recently I won't tell
[1:24:55] you how recently but very
[1:24:57] recently and you realize the only way
[1:24:59] you can feel offense is if you still
[1:25:01] have self yes sir that's the only way
[1:25:04] you can feel an offense so the minute
[1:25:06] you feel that offense you got to start
[1:25:07] judging that and say why am I offended
[1:25:10] right somebody spped on my toes they
[1:25:12] said something they shouldn't have I
[1:25:14] well you know what God bless them
[1:25:19] anyhow God bless them anyhow I want I
[1:25:23] want to look to Calvary and take that
[1:25:27] example when we start struggling with
[1:25:29] these things what we need to do is look
[1:25:31] to
[1:25:32] Calvary and look at what Jesus went
[1:25:34] through leading up to Calvary his
[1:25:35] Earthly Journey leading to Calvary and
[1:25:37] the death itself s and that's how he
[1:25:40] wants me to love
[1:25:44] others Proverbs 13:10 says only by Pride
[1:25:48] cometh contention
[1:25:51] yes yeah have you ever been contentious
[1:25:55] that means argumentative and felt
[1:25:58] Justified like somebody had to tell
[1:26:03] him the Bible says only by Pride cometh
[1:26:08] contention where there's no Pride
[1:26:11] there's no contention
[1:26:15] right and I want to ask you
[1:26:17] too how many people have you told
[1:26:20] off that they changed their mind and it
[1:26:23] changed their
[1:26:27] life all you did was make yourself feel
[1:26:30] better because you got a little
[1:26:34] domination you got to give him a piece
[1:26:35] of your
[1:26:37] mind I'd rather give him a piece of the
[1:26:39] mind of Christ than a piece of my mind
[1:26:42] I'd rather give him a demonstration of
[1:26:44] self-sacrifice and true love then
[1:26:47] selflove and pride because only by Pride
[1:26:50] cometh
[1:26:51] contention
[1:26:54] praise
[1:26:57] God he said in Christ is the mystery of
[1:27:00] God revealed he said I love you don't
[1:27:01] forget the Commandments of God to you
[1:27:03] little children love one another love
[1:27:05] everybody right or wrong sinner or
[1:27:09] Saint now we just took it outside the
[1:27:14] church I'm going to read that again
[1:27:17] don't forget the Commandments of God to
[1:27:18] you little children love one another
[1:27:19] love everybody right or wrong wrong
[1:27:22] sinner or Sint love them anyhow if you
[1:27:26] don't then pray God to help you cuz God
[1:27:29] loved the Sinner and the nature of God
[1:27:31] is in you if the man is wrong love him
[1:27:33] anyhow don't partake of his sin seed
[1:27:36] don't partake of his sins but in
[1:27:38] sweetness not in sourness and rebuke in
[1:27:40] sweetness tell him of the hope of life
[1:27:42] that rests within you through Jesus
[1:27:44] Christ being revealed to you by the holy
[1:27:50] ghost man tells us he said live
[1:27:54] humble this is in 1965 trying to do God
[1:27:57] a service live humble live loving love
[1:28:00] one another don't never get nothing
[1:28:02] among you if you see something coming up
[1:28:04] in your heart against somebody get it
[1:28:06] out of there right
[1:28:08] then don't let it Fester don't act upon
[1:28:12] it but get on your knees and say God I
[1:28:15] need your help because you know what
[1:28:17] you're never going to be able to just to
[1:28:18] wish it
[1:28:19] away if it's not if there's something
[1:28:21] that comes up in your heart if there's
[1:28:22] an offense or you feel like something
[1:28:24] was unjust or something happened and it
[1:28:26] needs to be made right and you feel that
[1:28:29] coming up in your heart that ought
[1:28:30] against somebody amen that's when we
[1:28:32] have to go to prayer and say God I'm in
[1:28:34] desperate need because this is going to
[1:28:36] cause bitterness and bitterness will
[1:28:37] destroy me and everyone around me God
[1:28:40] would you please root this out of my
[1:28:41] life and give me your love for that
[1:28:43] brother or
[1:28:45] sister I need the kind of love that can
[1:28:48] be nailed to a cross spit on mocked made
[1:28:50] fun of and everybody reject rejected in
[1:28:52] the world and I can say father forgive
[1:28:54] them they don't know what they're doing
[1:28:55] that's the kind of love I
[1:28:58] need and we feel that offense coming or
[1:29:00] that a we need to get on our knees and
[1:29:02] ask God to give us that love
[1:29:05] yes I want to read one more scripture
[1:29:07] together and we'll close let's go to
[1:29:08] Ecclesiastes
[1:29:11] together it's another simple one but
[1:29:14] I I want to read this
[1:29:17] one
[1:29:20] Ecclesiastes right after
[1:29:23] Proverbs Ecclesiastes chapter
[1:29:29] 4 I want to start at verse
[1:29:34] 8 Ecclesiastes 4 and8 there is one alone
[1:29:38] and there is not a second y he hath
[1:29:39] neither child nor brother yet is there
[1:29:42] no end of all his labor neither is his
[1:29:44] eye satisfied with riches neither saith
[1:29:47] he for whom do I labor and beve my soul
[1:29:49] of good this is all vanity yeah it is a
[1:29:52] sore travail this is a man who's all by
[1:29:55] himself this is what his life is like
[1:29:58] then read verse n two are better than
[1:30:01] one because they have a good reward for
[1:30:03] their labor for if they fall the one
[1:30:05] will lift up his fellow but woe to him
[1:30:07] that is alone when he falleth for Heath
[1:30:09] not another to help him up again if two
[1:30:12] lie together then they have heat but how
[1:30:14] can one be warmed alone and if one
[1:30:16] Prevail against two one Prevail against
[1:30:18] him two shall withstand him and a
[1:30:20] three-fold cord is not quickly
[1:30:24] broken God never intended for us to be
[1:30:27] alone he wanted us to have
[1:30:30] friends God never intended us to have
[1:30:33] Fellowship all by oursel CU we can't get

[1:30:37] to tapes and have only us and only our
[1:30:39] family CU everybody else is wrong God
[1:30:42] never wanted that that's a miserable
[1:30:44] life according to
[1:30:46] ecclesias but God wanted us to be in
[1:30:49] Fellowship sheep of a f wanted us to
[1:30:51] have some somebody to lean on in time of
[1:30:53] trouble somebody that will cover for me
[1:30:54] when I need covered for so that I can
[1:30:56] cover for somebody
[1:30:57] else God never wanted us to be
[1:31:00] alone but he wanted us to be in
[1:31:03] Fellowship God never wanted us to be
[1:31:05] friendless but he wanted to be our
[1:31:07] friend and he wanted us to love one
