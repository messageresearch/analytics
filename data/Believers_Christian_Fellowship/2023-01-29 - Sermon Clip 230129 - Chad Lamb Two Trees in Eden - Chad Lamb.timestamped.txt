[0:00] I only want to sow Christ seed
[0:03] the true word the revelation of the true
[0:05] word I don't want to mix my own thoughts
[0:09] I don't want to add my own and listen
[0:13] there's no way that we're going to get
[0:14] away from Human preaching
[0:17] and in human and that's called the
[0:18] foolishness of preaching because it is
[0:20] absolutely foolish if there's any way to
[0:23] make something bad
[0:25] ineffective broken and prone to failure
[0:28] is put it in humanity
[0:34] I mean tell me which Corporation runs
[0:38] perfect which government entity runs
[0:40] perfect which home runs perfect which
[0:43] one of you are perfect
[0:46] the the most likely the way to make
[0:48] something prone to failure is put it in
[0:50] Fallen Humanity
[0:51] put in their hand but yet God has put
[0:53] preaching of the word he's put himself
[0:55] on partnership with man and he's made
[0:57] preaching of the word his method and we
[0:59] can't get away from that
[1:01] but yet it's prone to failure
[1:05] and then Paul you know Paul instructs
[1:07] ministers to take what he's taught them
[1:09] and pass it out to others he's
[1:10] instructing Timothy to instruct what
[1:12] you've learned and share it with others
[1:14] that they may also be faithful teachers
[1:15] and so Paul is administering uh uh
[1:18] admonishing ministers that go out and
[1:20] Minister the word knowing that they're
[1:22] prone to failure
[1:26] and you know what they're supposed to
[1:28] preach what Paul preached
[1:30] is that what brother Brandon preached he
[1:32] preached what Paul preached
[1:34] but he didn't stand up and just read the
[1:37] book of Romans Romans chapter 1 chapter
[1:39] 2 that's the morning service come back
[1:40] we'll read chapter 4 chapter 5.
[1:43] he preached what Paul preached but he
[1:45] preached amen by inspiration through a
[1:47] human vessel the spirit of God working
[1:49] and it was prone to failure amen but he
[1:52] was preaching what Paul preached and now
[1:53] to preach the message is not just to
[1:55] stand up and read a list of quotes say
[1:57] amen and we all sit down because I'm so
[1:59] afraid of failing that all I can do is
[2:02] say verbatim What the prophet said and
[2:04] nothing else that's not preaching
[2:08] but God uses human vessels prone to
[2:11] failure amen and then he starts doing
[2:13] Supernatural things as he brings his
[2:15] word and he begins to do it in such a
[2:17] way that you can say that is not my
[2:19] brother up there because he doesn't know
[2:21] what happened yesterday what's going to
[2:23] happen tomorrow the decision I have to
[2:24] make this after he doesn't know these
[2:27] things now I'm watching God in a failed
[2:29] vessel through a weak method come in a
[2:32] perfect way and Minister the word to me
[2:37] and it's dangerous and prone to failure
[2:39] and has failed millions of times
[2:43] but it's still his method
