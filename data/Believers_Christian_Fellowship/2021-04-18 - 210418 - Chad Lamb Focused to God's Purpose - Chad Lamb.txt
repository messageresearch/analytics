our bibles let's turn to john chapter 15. i'd just like to take the moment and welcome my mom sister debbie to service this morning we're happy to have her she's up to visit the family and visit you all and we're happy to have her and serve us along with our other visitors amen so let's look at john chapter 15 and also i want to us to continue to remember the phase in family and it's a tough thing to lose somebody like that and god had blessed brother joe with a long life and he had been a blessing to many many people and i just thank god about three weeks ago maybe three or four weeks ago i had the opportunity angie and i to go and sit with brother joe for a while and visit with him we had a wonderful visit he was feeling good he was sharing his testimony with us but he told us then he was ready to go and i believe our brother was ready to go and we just we will mourn his loss and especially for the family we'll grieve for them as well but i wouldn't ask him to come back if he had to come back in that body but when he brother comes back it'll be in a different body and that's the reunion that we long to have that's the hope that we have that's the consolation we have and we know in this hour that we live it's not far away amen let's just read our bibles here in john chapter 15 and verse 16. gospel of john chapter 15 verse 16 ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he may give it to you just bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing lord jesus we thank you father for the privilege of standing here god we know lord that this is a wonderful privilege and opportunity you've given us in these last days that we can gather together like this lord to hear your word to gather with the licks of fire lord your attributes and sing your praises and god how we so worship you and love you and thank you for what you're doing in this day we thank you god for your word that you've opened to us in continually unveiling yourself before us we ask god that you would do the same today lord that you would take these lips of clay but that you would take control of this vessel and use them to speak your eternal words may you have preeminence among us lord and may you speak what you have ordained to say in this day that we might be equipped to live the life you've called us to in all things may you have preeminence among us in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can have your seeds today i'd like to talk about focused to god's purpose focused to god's purpose and i got quite a few scriptures i want to read so keep your bibles handy quite a lot on my heart that i'd like to share but very very simple message there's nothing complicated about what's on my heart today but it is so very good and so pertinent to where we live and it's these things that we constantly need to be reminded of and we have to constantly be focusing ourselves to god's purpose because we live in an age it's so easy to be distracted amen distractions are everywhere the world moves at a rapid pace everything goes so fast amen it's overwhelming at times but there's one purpose that god has amen one purpose that he's had since the beginning amen and we want to stay aligned to that purpose and we stay aligned to that purpose then we will fulfill his purpose in our lives he says in the message the identified masterpiece of god he has a purpose in your life each individual that no one else on the face of the earth can take your place god has got something for you you're made like that you was did that way for a purpose god is sovereign in his work he even things different he we're different one from another and so i know so many times as human beings we always uh not always but many of us have a struggle with identity or a struggle with what am i actually doing for the lord i'm not really doing anything and that's because we get our eyes on the wrong thing we have a misconception of what it means to do the work of the lord we have an idea that to go in the mission field or to preach the gospel that's the only way you can do the work of god and i say that those things are the work of god absolutely all of those things to write a song to saying amen to lead a sunday school or a class or anything like that or the works of god but we limit those things to the we limit the works of god to those things that are visible and tangible and that we would traditionally labels the works of god and but we miss what god is doing in our everyday life god wants to work his work through each of us and he said and brother ben told us he has a purpose in your life so we can't pass this off anywhere else and i'd like to say this too so many times when when we were younger amen i would remember thinking yeah god has a purpose for me and some day some day someday there was always some day like i was going to get to this purpose that i was going to be used for something and that someday god would do something with me and in thinking like that i was missing what god was doing and what god was wanting to do and so it's god in us every day and god through us every day and we don't want to lose sight of that or else we can get caught up in things we ought not to be caught up in and we can find ourselves distracted with things we ought not to be distracted with brother brahms says in the message things that are to be this is just in december of 1965 one of the last few messages he preaches so now the only way that you can be a son a daughter of god because you have to be have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's god's life only one form of eternal life that was god and there to be a son of god you have to be in him always and the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there was even a molecule and you were nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as a son of god now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age now that's an individual now you as the individual where you're at today you are expressed after the word has come into you to light up this age and you are expressing god's life in you because you are a son or daughter of god therefore you get what i mean see you are you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express god to this nation and this people in this neighborhood where you associate wherever you are god knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you've got eternal life then it was always eternal life and god before there was a foundation the world knew that you would be here and so when we take this you know when when the prophet of god comes at the opening of the seals and he begins to reveal god's plan of redemption and and this great mystery of god in christ is the mystery of god revealed and then it begins to explain so many things about our life and when the mystery of god was revealed amen really for for us it's revealing the mystery of our life so the understanding of the mystery of god being revealed is breaking the seals off our life so that we can understand who we are and what god's purpose is for us and what his intention is with us so that we don't walk in in some old understanding or some wrong understanding amen and you know there's so many ideas that the denominations brought in that god was trying to take away from us we had ideas of you know i'm here and i'm just trying to make it and if i can just live a good life amen and if i could just uh do good and and be found acceptable to god then someday i can attain unto a good resurrection i can attain and to a good judgment and i can i can get in and that was a denominational way of thinking i remember i was raised in this kind of thinking that if i died and i had done wrong and backslid and i had died that i'd be lost and go to hell that's the raising that i was raised in very armenian that i was constantly you're constantly in jeopardy of dying and being lost but the message came and told you you've never been in jeopardy of being lost because your name was written in the last book of life before the foundation of the world you can no more be lost and god can be lost because you're an attribute a part of god down in your soul is something god has portioned for you to express in this day in this age and god has a purpose for you and he is not going to lose that purpose and if you're a son of god you were always the son of god and i said before you may have been a disobedient son you may have been a rebellious son you may have been a naughty son but you were still a son you may have been you know an unprofitable son but you were still a son so the message came to take away all these wrong ideas that i'm trying to attain and i'm hoping that someday i'll be found good enough and and he took that away so that we could have liberty in christ but not liberty to go and and just you know sit on a creek bank and drink lemonade and and know that everything all is well but liberty freed from the bondage of trying to make it in liberty to be what god had always called us to be liberty to be with just what he made me to be and liberty to express just what he called me to express and so now you're a attribute a gene of your father and you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as a son of god now i don't think god is wasting any of his attributes if we can just catch this revelation that if if if we are a son or daughter of god there is an attribute a seed gene of god that was in us before the foundation of the world that was ordained and placed within us and that has come down now into expression and now to say well you know everybody else has a work to do but i have nothing to do i'm just here i'm nothing special and someday see we missed the whole point of what the prophet's trying to tell us that you yourself as an individual are expressing this great mystery of god let's turn to luke chapter 9. luke chapter 9 and verse 23 and he said unto them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me i like that word daily this wasn't a one-time thing but he said if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whatsoever whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it this is a key principle and when i'm talking today on focus to god's purpose we have to constantly be taking up our cross and and the cross is used for sacrifice that's what the cross was used for amen to kill somebody and when you take up your cross that means it's your cross that means that's the cross that you die on and so daily we take up our cross and follow after him amen and the prophet of god says here in the message god's provided way and you're bound to be backsliding constantly so it takes a constant prayer to god paul said i die daily and if paul had to die daily how much more am i going i'm going to have to stay there dead all the time if paul had to die daily to stay right with god and so we'll all have to do that just die out to ourselves and that's getting god's way now there's only two ways of anything that's the right way and the wrong way and then ways are your ways and god's way and you can't be in your way in god's way at the same time you've got to forget your own way to get in god's way and you've got to get out of your own way to get in god's way for as long as you're in your own way you're out of his way so forsake your way forsake your thoughts forsake everything and just rely on just rely just rely one thing on thus saith the lord that's all then you know you're right so brother is trying to explain to us just forget about yourself amen just just die out to everything because you can't have it your way and god's way at the same time and you can't go according to your own thinking and god's thinking at the same time but we have to surrender our thinking in our way to god's thinking now i want to pick up a story here in john chapter 21 a story of peter after the resurrection the death and resurrection of jesus christ and he's going to come and show himself to his disciples again and he's going to begin to speak to peter and give peter a commission i want to follow this closely john 21 and verse 15 so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonas loveth thou me more than these and he saith him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith in him feed my lambs he saith to him again the second time simon son of jonas loveth thou me he saith in him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my sheep. he saith in him the third time simon son of jonas loveth thou me peter was greed because he said unto him the third time loveth thou me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things now knowest that i love thee jesus saith in him feed my sheep amen in verse 18 verily verily i say unto thee when thou was young thou gerdest thyself and walkest wither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hand and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not this spake signifying by what death he should glorify god and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me so now the peter gets a commission and the way he gets the commission is so unique because we know that he denied the lord three times but three times the lord asked him do you love me and peter had a chance to express three times lord you know i love you but he also gave him a commission he said feed my lambs feed my sheep feed my sheep because we know that peter was given the keys to the kingdom and he was to open the gospel to the three peoples of the world to the jews to the samaritans and to the gentiles and now he is receiving his commission and he's saying do you love me you denied me three times now he's expressing to god that he loves him three times but he's also given him his commission feeding my sheep three times feeding my sheep amen to the jew to the samaritan to the gentile peter was going to unlock the gospel then he tells him amen that that he is going to be surrendered and he's going to die he even gives him a prophecy of his death when i was young thou gerdest thyself and walk us whether thou wouldest but when thou shall be old thou shall stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whether thou wouldest not this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify god so god already had it mapped out he already had a commission for peter he already told peter to go feed the sheep he was given the keys to the kingdom and then he was even told what the end of his life would be and he and then when god spoke this he said follow me but i want to look at what peter says next verse 20. then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast as supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee this is the apostle john he looks back and he sees john following in verse 20 says he's peter seeth him saith peter see him say it to jesus lord what shall this man do jesus said unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thou me and then i'll just say this as a of a perfect example peter just got a commission from the lord and then he just was given an opportunity to be reconciled to the lord jesus he denied him three times he was reconciled to him he was given a commission he was even told of his end and he said follow me and peter immediately wants to know what about john and jesus tells him right quick don't you worry about john amen if i will that he abides till i come and you know next it says and then a rumor went out that he would stay till the lord's coming and brother branham cleared that up he said john was going to see him all the way over in revelation and be caught up and see him in his second coming in the millennial reign and all the way to new heavens and new earth and so he said it was true amen but not like they thought but he's telling peter he said what what is it to thee if he abides till i come follow thou me and it's a great lesson for us because god has given us a commission as his bride in this day and it doesn't matter what another family is doing what another person is doing what another church or another ministry or anything else is doing we're not to get our eyes on anybody else but follow him he is the open word in our day he is the word that's been restored he is the headship that has been brought back to unite with the bride and we are to follow him and the commission that he has for us peter's commission was not the same as john's commission was not the same as paul's commission but they each one had their own work to do for the lord and they could never do that if they were constantly worried about what somebody else was doing and god has so clearly given us a commission in this day amen and i'm talking to his bride the bride if you're a bride you have a commission in this day and under that commission there's all kinds of different things god can use you for but we're under one commission and that commission is to display jesus christ in bride form that is our commission that is what god has called us to that is why we're on this earth and that is our purpose and in doing that he's called some as mothers and some as fathers and some as teachers and some as apostles and some is evangelists and pastors and and some is helps and some is this and some is that amen all of that is got to be lined up with the one commission amen and that commission is the second fold of his threefold purpose to have preeminence and a bride and when we have that commission it's to each one of us as an individual god has given us the commission amen and under that commission we know that that we are to give him preeminence and all thing and it is to be his life living through us and now it doesn't matter what he does with my neighbor and he doesn't matter what he does with my brother and he doesn't matter what he does with the other church i hope we can understand that because that's all distractions in the peripheral and the devil is always trying to use these distractions and the peripheral to get us off of our main objective peter was never told to worry about john he was told he was commissioned to take those keys and feed the sheep to open the gospel to the three people forget about john john has nothing to do with what i just told you and you know we we get surrounded by individuals and we can become discouraged by things that we see we can be done become discouraged by things that a brother or sister will do or somebody else in the message that we know and love we can become discouraged by those things but i tell you that's just the tactic of the devil amen to have something in the peripheral of your vision to catch your attention and get you off the main thing and if you've heard your calling amen in this day and you've received your commission i tell you friends that commission is an all-consuming commission in order to fulfill that commission you will have to die daily you will have to you will have to wrestle this body into subjection day by day hour by hour moment by moment and so we have a good lesson here peter's commission and the difference in john's commission and and peter makes the mistake that we all make so much why do i have to do this and why does it seem like they can get away with that you ever thought that why is it god won't let me god won't let me but it seems like everybody else can still believe the message and god will still bless them i say what is that to thee follow him how can how can they allow this in their home and how can they allow this in their church and how can they do this and how can they do that i'm telling you friends if you start taking that bait and chasing that you're going to be missing the commission that god has called us with and called us too it's a distraction in the peripheral and i say let's focus to god's purpose amen god's purpose for me he did not call peter amen to make sure john was doing what john was supposed to do god was dealing with john you understand he didn't call peter to make sure paul was fulfilling his commission god was dealing with paul and god will deal with every one of his attributes amen it's not your job to make sure every one of them are doing what god's called him to do it's your job to make sure you're following him and he is the word that has been revealed in this day he is our headship he is our bridegroom he is the revealed word and so i say don't let the devil play games with us and don't get caught up in what somebody else is doing amen god you know god is god and he's so amazing and he does so many things he could take somebody who's very close to you amen and you believe the same and and they could do something different than you something you believe is wrong amen and not right according to the message and not what they ought to be doing and you may even express that to them but they have a different opinion they say i i believe it's okay because of this and this and they continue on and god pours blessings down upon them and you can become agitated or nervous or even maybe bitter or upset about that and i'm saying why what does it matter let god take care of them god could have done that just to see what you'll do about it i could have blessed them and healed them and given them testimonies amen coming out of their ears i mean like like they are almost the messiah on earth and you're so troubled about this thing that they're doing and he said forget about it you've got enough you've got enough to worry about to make sure you follow him and god may be doing those things and allowing that and you have no idea how many times have you done something that you thought was right and you were bold about doing it but later god revealed to you as wrong and you repented of it and changed your behavior i'd say that's every one of us and god might have been using you at that time to test your brother like he's using your brother to test you right now hey amen oh i love when the message where the rubber meets the road amen and it gets down inside and starts rooting out all of this stuff amen that trips us up that's just absolute nonsense we've got to get to the place amen where when brother branham creates christ is the mystery of god revealed amen in that message he says this is this revelation is to the individual how many times in that message does he say the individual one person one man not a denomination not a group one person one man to the individual i think he's trying to get us to the understanding that this this third pool ministry is to the individual it's not to the group it's not a public show amen under the third pool they were going into the little room one by one amen and in that little room they were being changed and they were coming out and they weren't even clearly able to explain what was happening in there amen but it was an individual one by one it was no longer a public show and god wants this individual affair with you amen he's not coming down to have this a church group church affair this group and that group he's coming for the individual amen and he's expressing himself through the individual and sometimes amen in that individual walk if we're not careful we we we start to take god's leadership for us and we have we start to apply it to everybody else and like peter was doing well you've told me this is what i'm doing and you told me that you know i'm going to be led against my will my arms will be outspread speaking what manner of death he'll die and he says well what about john it doesn't matter about john what if he remains till i come what if he never and you know that john never had to die a martyr's death all the other disciples died of martyr's death but john didn't die of martyr's death amen they tried to boil them with oil but it didn't work because god wasn't done with him yet all the rest of them died of martyr's death but john and now now after peter finds out he's going to be a martyr now he's looking at john and he knows the lord loves him he's got a special relationship with the lord through the book of john he's referred to as the one whom the lord loveth and so peter don't think peter wasn't human peter says well what about him he said what is it to thee if he remained till i come what if he doesn't have any suffering and he doesn't die a martyr's death and i preserve him just for blessings what is that to thee follow thou me let's go to second corinthians chapter 10. second corinthians 10 verse 12 for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves comparing themselves among themselves are not wise peter couldn't compare himself with john john compared with peter they all had something different to accomplish for the lord and god was not actually he wasn't even going to tell peter what was john's portion he told peter what was peter's portion and we're not here to compare ourselves among ourselves or measure ourselves by ourselves we've been given the leadership in this day and that leadership is is christ is the word and that is what we measure ourselves by and that is what we compare ourselves by not with each other because this is not group this is individual the group is over the this is the age of the individual amen the individual with the revelation the individual with the purpose the individual with the calling is to the individual and now we don't want to measure ourselves among ourselves or compare ourselves with one another but we want to always be following him measuring ourselves with the word because to measure ourselves amongst ourselves is not wise and the message influenced brother boom says now and we mustn't try to impersonate anyone just be what you are see and that's the way god made you you never fashioned yourself and remember as much as we ministers would like to take billy graham's place we cannot do it neither can billy graham take our place see each one has something to do the common little fella here that may be a janitor the little woman that may be a housewife the greatest minister on the face of the earth today could not take your place god had a purpose in making you what you are and you just serve god in that way that he made you and i think if we would just do that the wheels would roll a lot easier in the unveiling of god he says don't try to be a moses don't try to be an errand don't just be who you are but be a christian in the super sign he says now you all can't be that one but you can be part of that with your faith he's talking about the elijah ministry all can't be that one but you can be part of that with your faith all of them couldn't be a jesus when they was on earth but they could believe him and accept the message there was one moses one elijah one noah on down always been that but the rest of them could accept it and they would have had no ministry unless there had been somebody believe it jesus would have had no ministry unless somebody believed that paul would have had no ministry unless somebody believed him so brother says you can't all be that one there was one messenger in our age there was one seventh angel event there was one but you can be a part of that with your faith i cannot be that one but i'm part of it by my faith amen i'm part of that ministry i'm part of that calling i'm part of that prophecy i'm part of that work in this age because of my faith brother branham is is here uh he's got a he's preaching a funeral in 1963 at the end of 1963 in november this message is titled i'm the resurrection and the life and he's preaching the funeral of a young man named garnet peak and garnet peak died at 18 and you've been sickly for several years and and they had prayed for him quite a bit and uh he passed away at the age of 18. and i want you just to hear the way brother brenham describes him and describes his life so now this little cold frame laying here none of us can say but what he's part of this great economy of god's creation he is part of god's creation he's a man a human being that god created he lays sleeping now now the thing of it is if he served god's purpose in this life then there's got to be a resurrection for garnet this is a principle that brother brenham teaches that whatever served god's purpose in this life has a resurrection there's no way of getting around it this is not the end of garnet well we've all got to take this route through life we come in from the darkness and enter the same way and every one of us some way or other are going through the shadow of the valley of the shadow of death but the thing we're put here for there is like the world jesus said you cannot serve god and mammon mammon is the world can't serve god in the world at the same time we have our choice we can we can be dramatized by god by his holy spirit and we have eternal life if we don't when we die that's it we're ready for the judgment then why we didn't do it then the punishment it follows that for rejecting it but i am so happy as far as i know within the reach of my understanding by the word of god and by the witness of the holy spirit this boy met that condition he was born of the spirit of god a changed man the spirit of god was upon the little fellow he was a staunch christian he served god's purpose maybe it was for a short time now think about the passing of an 18 year old boy and what they would be like for his family and even himself and and and his parents but brother branham said he served god's purpose everything that has the life of god serves god's purpose and everything that serves god's purpose has resurrection life he served god's purpose maybe it was for a short time but god sometimes trains men for years to get a few days of service out of him john the baptist was 30 years by himself in the wilderness for six months of service jesus christ was 30 years old for three years of service for the crucifixion god trains men brings them up it's his purpose time is with man eternity is with god i believe that god brought this little boy here on earth for a purpose and if you notice right in the time of his sickness and things this struck him for a purpose even his sickness struck him for a purpose god could have made the boy sound and well you know not i imagine they even prayed for him to be sounding well do you believe that they prayed probably prayed probably fasted and prayed probably prayed sincere prayers heartfelt tear-filled prayers for the boy's healing even the boy was delivered many times of things but you find out that brother branham now is saying that this sickness was for god's purpose the sickness and things just struck him for a purpose god could have made the boy sound well but what did he do instead of taking his life he let him get up just where he wasn't going to die and neither did polio kill him he didn't die by polio no other disease killed him that we prayed over he and i and the rest of the christians here around campbellsville that prayed for him it never that never did it see it was garnet's time to go he must he had served his purpose now garnet never preached he never was a trustee or a deacon he never i taught sunday school he never sang as far as i know never sang a special he never went to the mission field but garnet at the age of 18 had already served god's purpose so god had already taken him i hope this changes our idea of what it means to serve god's purpose to do the work of god amen he had served his purpose he came to christ been dramatized what if he would have died before this time polio drove him to god he was to be a tobacco auctioneer what he had in his mind that wasn't his purpose at all we knew that his purpose was to be a christian now a tobacco auctioneer somebody say maybe 75 years from day if the world should stand that long garnet he was a great auctioneer maybe that's all the minister could have said at his funeral he was a great auctioneer but what can we say today he's a christian as an auctioneer without the germ of life just a memory of that generation he'd be gone among a few men now he's among the immortals he's got to come forth in the resurrection there's no way to keep him from it he has to come for he served his purpose he was germatized with the holy spirit of god of eternal life that laid within the boy and so much that if he said if i knowed the last time i spoke to him he said if i knew that i that i could be well strong like these other boys running up and down the roads here with my hot rod and running up and down the roads and drinking it would not know this that i know he said i wouldn't swap this for 10 000 lives like that a young 18 year old boy fine handsome looking young man would probably been a regular target for the devil but god had to throw him in that stage to get out of him to serve the purpose look at his patience his testimonies among you neighbors look what he was what how his little life was spoke to many of you that day that at the day of judgment without that his life will testify right back against you he was an example of what god wanted with him he served god's purpose in his condition weak and sickly and bedfast much of the time and homebound what was he doing he was serving god's purpose and you know even so much as an 18 year old boy said uh you know to have his conversion and have faith in god he said i wouldn't trade that if i would live and be healthy and live like those other boys not for christ i wouldn't trade what i have now for ten thousand lives like that and what was he doing he was displaying a character he was displaying a life amen in the midst of sickness amen a young life a man looked like it being held back or snuffed out or lost opportunities amen brother bam talked about he had ambition he had a dream he wanted to be a tobacco auctioneer and another place in the message he said he was a good auctioneer he must have already been starting amen and maybe he had abilities but he he was losing out on all his opportunities you know i've seen so many people lose out on an opportunity and become bitter over it lose out amen and all of a sudden whether it be a sickness or a lost opportunity or or missed something or and they become bitter and they feel like they missed something or or they didn't get something somebody else had or life somehow was unfair or mistreated them amen and don't think that we as believers are not subject to that same kind of thinking the devil will come in and somehow why do you have to suffer when others don't suffer like you and why can't you be like everybody else and why does god bless this but he withholds the blessing from you that's the situation garnet peak was in but yet brother man said look at his patience look at his testimonies among you neighbors look what he was how his little life was spoke to many of you he was an example of god what god wanted with him he served god's purpose i mean and sometimes to serve god's purpose it means that god will add affliction amen he will allow disappointment he will hold us back from our ambitions and hold us back from our dreams because he has a purpose for our lives and if we're going to fulfill that purpose then we're going to have to die daily because it's not you know you think well god would have got so much glory in garnett peak's deliverance and his healing amen i i would say it this way even through the ministry of brother branham god got tremendous amount of praise and glory through healings is that true god was glorified and god was displayed and his attribute of healer was displayed thousands times thousands of times through the ministry of brother branham but here's a here's a little boy that god was not going to allow to come to a complete wholeness amen he was going to take him what we would say before his time but it was never before god's time it was never too early it was never unjust it was never unfair it was perfect and he wasn't bitter or angry he didn't feel like there was an unjustice he didn't feel like it's not right that i should have to go through this and nobody else has to go through what i go it's not right that god would put this burden on me and not on somebody else he didn't have that attitude and without that attitude he could serve god's purpose remember brother branham was in shreveport louisiana one time and he was preaching there in shreveport he was talking about a little sister sitting there in the wheelchair he said every time we come in she's so pleasant and nice and smiling and many times we've wondered why god doesn't heal her i'm just paraphrasing many times we've wondered why god doesn't heal her we've seen him do more than that is that true we've prayed for brother ben and prayed for and wondered himself why god doesn't heal her because he's more than able in this ministry god's done way more than that but he looked down under he said maybe god let her stay that way so she could bless me prophet of god was encouraged when he would see that little lady stuck in that wheelchair but she always had a smile she was always happy amen she was always in spite of her condition she was cheerful she was smiling and brother ben said maybe he let her stay that way because she could bless me now if that little sister could know amen that that her condition was not without a purpose amen but that god had allowed her to stay that way just to bless his prophet in the end time i'd say if we had the right scope of the grand scope of god's program and what that prophet was to do and and what his troubles were and his difficulties and how he could take cheer and a sister in a wheelchair who god seemingly won't answer their prayer and won't raise her up even though he easily could and she could equate her suffering in that wheelchair with a blessing to god's profit and encouragement to his heart she would probably say i'm fine here in the wheelchair if we only knew amen if we could only i wouldn't say no because we know but if we could only believe if we could only keep it in our mind that everything we go through that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered to the lord amen that god has ordained things for our lives and what he wants out of us is he wants to accomplish his purpose he wants us how can i prove my love to him by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he sees fit to allow to come my way man i don't think it's pleasing to the lord and we were preaching on wednesday i don't think it's pleasing to the lord to begin to complain i don't think it's pleasing to the lord to begin to blame him for being unjust see that's the problem job got in job would not bring a railing accusation against the lord job would not fail amen and fail against the lord but where job was corrected by god is when job would start to say i've not done anything wrong and this isn't fair and when job got to say i'm innocent i haven't done anything wrong i don't know why god's doing this he was beginning to allude to the fact that god was somehow being unjust amen and god come down and corrected him and says who are you amen you're but dust and you deserve to die i'm the one who gives you life i'm the one who sustained says i'm the one who does all of these things who do you think you are and by the time job was done with that conversation job says i've spoke once and i'll never speak again i spoke twice and i'll put my hand over my mouth because god is perfect in all his ways if he allows something to come your way it's for a purpose and then you're for his purpose you're here for his purpose if you are a seed of god a son or daughter of god then your life has purpose and everything you're doing serves that purpose amen and we need to get comfortable saying god is in charge and i'm happy with the road that he has laid out for me does it have difficulty yes amen is it sometimes hard absolutely does it cause you to weep absolutely is her heartache there without a doubt amen but we've got to get to the place where we can say the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord god who blesses never stops watching over me we need to come and keep in our mind the realization that i have a father who watches over me i'm not ever one day in my life been abandoned brother bram said of of abraham abraham was god's elect seed on the earth in that day and abraham amen god would come to abraham and tell abraham you're to go here and you're to go there and he began to move about in the land and brother brother ma'am says god was always watchful over abraham because abraham was his lexi he knew every turn he made he knew every place he was he knew when abimelech was going to take his wife he knew when he got in trouble down in egypt he knew every turn that abraham made and his eye was always on abraham because abraham was his son and you are the seed of abraham you're the faith seed of abraham you're children of abraham you're the royal seed amen how could he not have his eye on you amen and the problem is we for a fraction of a moment when stress comes and anxiety and all the difficulties come for we have a flashback of spiritual amnesia and we forget we have a father and we begin to act like we have no heavenly father and that we're here to take care of ourselves and there is no purpose and we would never say those things but our actions in the heat of the moment begin to dictate that that we've lost sight of who we are spiritual amnesia's creep back in but god has peeled away the mysteries so there would be no question about who we are and no question about his watchfulness over us and no question about that he is watching over you and i and god if his even brother branham said it this way if god purposed for me to be a deceiver this is what brother bam says i would love him anyways because that was his purpose and he's worthy of my love and he said if at the end of my life he kicked me to hell i would kiss the foot that was kicking me that was his love for god because god is sovereign and god has a purpose and we want god's purpose just amazing that a prophet god would say that and why little bethlehem the man says even nature everywhere speaks of him and nature is a great testimony in another way that is that we cannot have this resurrection life unless it serves god's purpose brotherhood says this like i said over and over again what he's been teaching is what he's saying is everything that serves god's purpose has a resurrection but if it does not serve god's purpose it has no resurrection and he's speaking i know the first resurrection not the general resurrection unto the judgment but he's talking the first resurrection amen and he says if it does not serve god's purpose it does not have a resurrection but if it serves god's purpose it has a resurrection it has resurrection life already in it and i say god i want to serve your purpose amen because it's not this life it's the next life amen it's not this one that i'm gaining i'm going for it's the next one that i'm looking to amen despising the shame we've looked ahead to the glory that lay ahead we've got to be living for the next life amen and allowing god to fulfill his purpose in this life and if we fulfill his purpose then we have a resurrection now if a seed is planted and that seed is germatized it brings forth a new flower but if it isn't germatized it will not bring forth a new flower if it doesn't serve god's purpose yet not just because it's a flower arises because it serves god's purpose that's the reason the sun rises is because it serves god's purpose and we rise when we serve god's purpose i don't know about you but i want to serve god's purpose iran says in the message i know satan could not take them he could not drown noah in the flood until the purpose of god had been finished he could not burn up the hebrew children until the purpose of god had been finished he could not kill job with boils and troubles until the purpose of god had been finished neither could the lions eat daniel until god's purpose had been finished neither could death an old age take abraham until the purpose of god had been finished and neither can it take you or can it take me until the purpose of god of our life is finished so we gather from there consolation oh don't let the devil frighten you don't let the devil scare you with a bad prognosis or a doctor's report that's evil amen you're not leaving this earth until god's purpose is finished with you they couldn't burn up the three hebrew children amen they burn up they intensified the heat so intense that it burnt the guards who threw them in but it could not burn them because god's purpose for them was not finished and say all i want to do now is align myself with god's purpose because in his purpose i have perfect protection i have perfect leadership amen everything will work according to god's purpose and i cannot be destroyed and now my life cannot be ended as long as i'm serving his purpose and when i'm done serving his purpose why would we want to stay when brother branham was lifted beyond the curtain of time and he went there and explained to us what was there and the feeling it had and he didn't even have words enough language enough to explain it amen and he himself did not want to go back and you think about how wonderful a place this was that when his young wife hope at 21 22 years old amen laying there dying he called for her to come back and she says why did you call me back 22 years old with two babies it was such a wonderful place she had already served her purpose god would not have let the prophet's wife go hope would not have gone if she had not already served her purpose and after she served her purpose she had gone on to a place so wonderful amen she wasn't trying to get back amen when the prophet called her back said why did you call me back he said it's wonderful it's everything you've preached and the prophet of god years and years later he would go to that same place and even see her she would come and greet him and say my precious brother amen and he would not want to go back amen and he could see his body laying in a bed and next to him would be his wife that he dearly loved amen and he began to feel funny and when he looked back the body was stirring on the bed and he said do i have to go back see when god's purpose is done for us why do we want to stay and if god's purpose is not done for us we can't go so you can't lose this is all i have to say you can't lose let fear be gone friends let anxiety be gone amen let it all dissipate right now because if god still has a purpose in your life you can't die you can't go amen nothing can happen to you until god's purpose is done and when god's purpose is done you go down with resurrection power in your life and you've got a promise of a resurrection because you served his purpose and while you wait for that resurrection to be united you're united with those who have already went on and you're not missing anything amen i tell you god is good there's no reason to be afraid i mean we get afraid that happens to us we're still struggling in this this body paul says oh who can deliver me from this body of death but he said i thank god through christ jesus but there's no reason to be afraid fear has torment but perfect love what is perfect love it's the capstone it's grace it's the message that comes to us in this hour to tell us that everything is right on time nothing's out of kilter with god the clock's ticking right on time nothing can happen in the life of a believer unless it first crosses god's desk and he signs off on it gives his approval there's nothing going to harm us there's nothing going to defeat his purpose in his life we can't lose amen but the devil so tries to control us by fear tries to get us to turn here or turn there or speak things that are evil or speak things that are contrary to the word troubles us in our mind and troubles us in our families amen but we got to come back to this revealed word that's been opened for us in this day and realize everything is absolutely as it should be garnett peak was 18 years old amen laying dying and god would deliver him from polio he didn't die of polio he didn't lie to the other disease but his lungs finally came and gave out and he couldn't breathe anymore and god used the polio to drive him to christ amen and there is christ he became a witness he became a testimony he became an example to his neighbors he became a light all around him that will stand at the day of judgment brother branham said he served god's purpose and he was sweet and humble genuine and loving while he served his purpose he was not irritated angry bitter he wasn't saying well i guess god wants me to suffer to display that's not it see it's not what we say i've watched people say well this is god wants me to bear this burden and i've watched the attitude and i've watched there's a bitterness that goes with it but when we really catch the revelation of god there's a sweet humility that comes with it when we bear our burden if there's some dark place that god wants us to shine a light in amen whether it be in a hospital bed or a bad family situation or or whatever it is if there's a dark place he wants us to shine the light you can't shine that light shrouded in bitterness and anger and fear and anxiety over your situation you can only shine that light when you allow the life of christ to come through and says everything is fine jesus was not bitter because they were going to hang him on a cross paul did not become bitter because they stoned him and they beat him we can say with our words that we're bearing a burden for the lord we say with their words one thing but our actions are totally different but it's got to be that life of christ on display that total surrender to the will of god and that desire amen to display him at all costs this blame and the best day display him on our worst day but always display him and realize nothing can happen to me unless god knows about it nothing can take me off this earth unless i've already served god's purpose let's go to first kings 19. i want to keep using these as examples as we progress through here first kings chapter 19. let's start at verse 1. we're going to talk about elijah after the mount carmel showdown after the great victory that god had showed him what to do he'd come in obedience to god he had done exactly what god said and god came down pillar of fire he licked up the sacrifice the stones the water and all and then they slew the 400 prophets of baal a great victory then we come to chapter 19 verse 1 and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belonged to judah and left his servant there and he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he and he requested for himself that he might die oh listen whose plan was he interested in now he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now oh lord take away my life for i am not better than my fathers and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat brother branham tells us this story of elijah under the juniper tree and how he sends the angel with the softest hands because he knows the condition that elijah's in and he strokes him and awakes him and he feeds him and and then lays him to sleep and feeds him again and and would just read the story now and he as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake bacon on the coals and a cruce of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again the angel lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because thy journey is too great for thee and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights in dehoreb the mount of god and he came hither into a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou hear elijah and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of host and for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with a sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away what was he doing he was complaining because god comes to him and he says what are you doing here he wants elijah to identify where he's at and i don't know that he's just trying to identify his physical location but i think he's trying to get him to identify where he's at because when he come to adam he come to adam after the fall and said adam adam where art thou it wasn't that god didn't know where he was and when god came to elijah amen he knew where elijah was and he knew where adam was but he says where are you and adam said i hid myself because i was afraid what was he doing he was trying to get adam to identify where adam was and now he gets elijah identify where he is and i say sometimes by the way we speak in the midst of a trial we're identifying where we are amen that we are stuck in spiritual amnesia that we have unbelief creeping in because of fear and anxiety amen when we hear ourselves begin to speak like elijah amen we need to say oh god forgive me this is not what you want for me it begins to identify where he's at verse 11 and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind on earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake of fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering into the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and it said what doest thou hear elijah he asked him the question again and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts because the children of israel are forsaken thy covenant thrown down that altar slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away and the lord said unto him go return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus and when thou comest anoint hasael to be king over syria and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel and elisha the son of shafat of abel mahola shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of hazel shall jehu slay him that escapeth from the sword of jehu shall elisha slay so now we want to back up here in the story and we find out that he's gone [Music] run away because jezebel threatened his life and after a great victory now he's running in a time of trial amen and we know that the anointing had left him and and he had crashed back down to earth as a man and he's running he's weary for his life and he says he asked god to let him die he never asked god to show me your will what do you want me to do next elijah start expressing his own will i want to die and i say friends we have no right to express our own will but let our will be his will and he said gave him food and drink and sustained him for the journey you know god had to feed him elijah was despairing of his life he was willing to lay there and die but god had to feed him because god's purpose for elijah wasn't done yet god came to elijah yes he loved him yes he was his prophet yes he was tender with him but he had to sustain his life in that wilderness you realize god wasn't going to get another one it was elijah that was called it was elijah that was commissioned so god had to take care of elijah that's why he had to take care of moses when moses was on the run that's why he didn't take care of all of them because they were still serving his purpose that's why he had to take care of paul when paul was beaten stoned and shipwrecked he still took care of him amen a night in the day he spent in the deep god was watching over paul amen he was not going to be eaten he was in the mediterranean sea there's great white sharks in the mediterranean sea none of them was going to eat paul because god's purpose wasn't finished in paul so now he says elijah what are you doing here and elijah begins to rant and complain this is brad and this is wrong nobody else and i'm the last one and they seek my life and god doesn't sympathize with him god doesn't answer him god doesn't speak back to any of his conditions he goes go stand in the upon the mountain and he goes we have this earthquake and a fire and a wind and all these things in a still small voice and he asked again he asked again elijah what are you doing here and elijah goes through the same rant the same complaining the same negative testimony and god never answers him one word he says all right go back you're not done yet god doesn't comfort him god doesn't console him god doesn't tell him it's all right god doesn't say i understand i know it's hard god just said what are you doing here he told him again what are you doing here and he says go by the way at damascus and anoint this one and anoint that one and anoint this one i'm not done with you then he comes down to verse 18 it says yet have i left me seven thousand in israel all the knees which have not bowed unto baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him elijah was saying i'm the only one that remains brother bam said see he opened the seal there and let him see that he wasn't the only one there was others all his complaining was in vain and all his feeling was wrong so god opened up a seal to show him you're not the only one i have a plan i have people my redemption cycle's still going on you're not it you're not lost you're not going to be destroyed everything's still okay and god opens seals for us so that we can know everything's okay brother man says in the message of the seven church ages he said john his destiny was met like this he was caught and boiled in a vat of grease for 24 hours of hot boiling grease without any harm coming to him and they put him on the aisle and commonly believed as a witch he bewitched the grease so it wouldn't burn him they said course it was the power of god you can't boil the holy spirit out of a man why so they tried to boil it out of him but god wouldn't permit it and he had a work for him to do and until god was finished with this man there's nothing in the world can bother him that's all see they would go to boil the apostle john and they couldn't destroy him and then they tried multiple times to destroy his life and brother man was just talking about the boiling now they tried to boil him in a vat of grease of oil and they could not boil him amen why because god was not done with him because he said what if if he shall tarry till i return he had to see the return of the lord he had to see the second coming and the rapture and the kingdom set up in the millennium and the new heavens and new earth and until he had saw it until he had scribed it until he had finished god's purpose to describe the book of revelation amen they could not boil him they could not kill him they could not destroy him but when god was done with him he could die of natural causes peter when god when god was working through peter amen when he was taking the keys and opening the kingdom amen nothing could harm him they could imprison him and he would open the gates and he would walk right out amen the same one that an angel would open doors the inner chamber he was surrounded by guards open it up he could walk out from the inner chamber to the outer chamber all the way out into the gate on the street he had a great escape and after all that they could take the same man and they can nail him upside down to a cross because at one time god's purpose wasn't done for him but at the other time his purpose was finished and this was god's purpose too because god had already spoke it we get so confused sometimes because sometimes miraculous things will happen for us absolutely supernatural we get into a bind and the most supernatural thing will happen and we get into another bind and it seems like god won't do anything we get so confused by that let's turn to acts chapter 9. i'd say like paul said make your calling an election sure and i'd make your calling on election sure before the next trial before the next deliverance before the next healing before the next amen trial make your calling an election sure now so that when the next bit of trouble comes along you're not tossed about amen by every wave amen but you've got an anchor that holds within the veil and you know i am secure in christ and there's nothing wrong with me that god has called me from before the foundation of the world and all this is is something that will serve his purpose and glorify his name acts chapter 9 verse 15. this is god speaking to ananias who's going to go speak to saul he said but the lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel for i will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake so paul was a chosen vessel and he was chosen for a purpose to bear the lord's name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel and until god was done serving that purpose they couldn't kill paul they tried but they couldn't kill paul let's go to acts chapter 14. here we pick up the apostle paul is in the in the city of lystra uh lystra leicester i don't know how to say it exactly but the the he prays every man and a man who's been crippled from his mother's womb is healed and then they try to worship him and barnabas as gods and he stops them from that and the very next verse in verse 19 it says and there came hither certain jews from antioch and iconium who persuaded the people and having stoned paul drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead the verse before the apostle paul had just stopped them from worshiping him as a god because he had laid hands on a man who was crippled from his mother's womb and he prayed for him and he instantly leaped up and began leaping amen and walking and they they saw that it was a great miracle and they looked at him and barnabas and say the gods have come down and they're going to slay and make sacrifice to them and immediately he just in verse 18 convinces them not to worship him and then in 19 some false jews can come from another city who are mad at him because of his doctrine and they can convince them to stone paul to death god who could raise a lame man would not stop them from stoning paul verse 19 again and there came hither certain jews from antioch and iconium who's persuaded the people and having stoned paul drew him out of the city supposing he'd been dead how be it as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and came into the city and listen and the next day he departed with barnabas to derby and when they had preached the gospel to that city you mean paul didn't stop preaching the gospel you mean paul didn't doubt his commission you mean when god didn't protect him from a stoning he didn't second guess whether he was really called to be an apostle or not you know paul was shipwrecked i think he said three times do you know that we never have a record of any of those times paul wondering why now why did god let the ship wreck now i know he called me maybe i'm out of his will maybe i'm not the apostle maybe i thought i was a light to the gentiles maybe i'm not a light to the gentiles because if it was the light to the gentiles and god was sending me here surely god would protect the ship and not let any harm come to the ship and now i've been shipwrecked and spent a night in the day in the deep and do you understand what i'm saying we got to make our calling and election sure that no matter what happens are calling an election sure that we know who we are and we know what we're here for and we know what we're on this planet to do and we're here to manifest jesus christ in every situation good bad all the in-between i'm here to manifest christ and just because he doesn't stop them from stoning me or he doesn't stop the car from crashing he doesn't stop the the whatever from breaking he doesn't stop amen the disease from afflicting because he doesn't stop it i'm not doubting whether or not i'm bride and i'm commissioned to live his life he called me amen he called me by his grace he established me in his word he quickened me by his spirit amen and nothing that's happening on the outside is changing his mind about who i am and neither is it changing my commission in this earth i'm here to display jesus christ amen through a stoning or a car wreck or a sickness or whatever it is i'm here to display jesus christ [Music] paul amen they they stoned him and they drew him out of the city and left him for dead supposing that he was dead listen that wasn't a mild stoning that was severe he was stoned to death or so they thought they had killed him that was an effective stoning and god didn't stop it maybe god was going to be glorified through the stoning why would he stop what he purposed apostle paul when all the saints are standing around he rises up and i love the scriptures he didn't rise up there wasn't a pity party not in the scriptures i don't know what actually happened but the scripture doesn't give us a pity party or a bunch of remorse or regrets or paul saying ah i said that wrong i shouldn't have said it that way i think i offended them do you understand what i'm saying what did paul do paul got up because he was still under a commission from god he was still the apostle to the gentiles and he got up and he went to the next city and started preaching he didn't go back to check his commission to make sure he really was a light to the gentiles god had already established that he was moving on in his commission it says i'm going to keep reading here yeah verse 20 again how be it as the disciples stood around about him he arose up and came into the city and the next day he departed with barnabas to derby where did he go he kept moving on in his mission work now listen he's in lystra now so he moved to derby and when they had preached the gospel to that city and it taught many they returned again to lystra and to iconium into antioch where did the men came that stoned him that convinced them to stone him they came from iconium and they came from antioch and they came to lystra and had him stoned and paul raises up and he goes the next day to derby when he's done preaching them and teaching them he goes back to leicester where he was stoned he goes back to iconium where the brothers came from that stone him and to antioch where the brothers came that stoned him nothing changed his commission the circumstances didn't change his calling the circumstances didn't change his commission he was resolved to do the will of god amen he wasn't trying to protect himself he wasn't trying to avoid danger he would go right back why because god called him god commissioned him it was his calling his purpose in this life and he was going because they couldn't kill him anyways until his purpose was done sometimes god would tell paul now don't fear to go into the city and speak with boldness for have much people there and they will not harm you but he didn't do it in the next city see you can't you can't figure out god you can't say well that time that he said don't fear them i have much people in the city speak with boldness they not harm you you were in the will of god then but when you spoke in lystra and they came and stoned you you weren't in the will of god then because look at the results i hope the devil gets a black eye we can't be tossed about by all these winds of course the devil's going to come against us and there's times that god will allow affliction he will allow sickness he will allow rebuke he will allow uh uh he'll allow rejection he will allow all of these things amen and what is paul doing when paul gets up and goes to derby and preaches what's he doing he's glorifying god he's sticking with his purpose amen he's not putting himself first he's staying in the calling where with god called him then he goes back to leicester back to iconium back to antioch because god didn't tell him to do any different i think it's a shame how quickly we doubt our calling when troubles come i'm not talking about you i'm talking about me i think it's a shame how we doubt where god has placed us when it becomes difficult in victory day the prophet of god says so so had israel forgotten they'd become satisfied down in egypt and then become slaves and now there was a moses that went down within his own intellectual affair to intellectual achievement to try and under a military force to bring out israel and failed to do it but just a word from god on the backside of the desert boiled the whole thing up again what happened to moses he got his glasses focused god's only purpose wasn't to marry his beautiful ethiopian color girl back there and settle down and have children and raise his father-in-law sheep but his mission was to deliver the children of god out from under that bondage that was his commission that's what he was born for and each one of us is born for something we just wasn't put here for nothing i want you to take this personally today don't apply we can apply it to the bride yes the bride's here for a purpose i wanted to be i want this to mean something to the individual amen we can use terms like bride and we can lose ourselves in the term by looking again at a group but this message has come in this day to call out the individual and each one of us is born for something we just wasn't put here for nothing that mountain never happened out there just to be that tree was put there for a purpose everything is for a purpose it's got to serve and we are here for a purpose maybe it's to testify to one person and get them saved and out of that out of that might come a preacher will send a million souls to christ look at dwight moody's conversion many of those you see the one little old woman a little awash woman with a message on her heart to do something for god she rented an old livery stable and got a minister to come down and preach and nobody but a little old boy with the hair hanging down his neck and his daddy suspenders on went down there and knelt down at the altar that night dwight moody that sent a half million souls to jesus christ see that woman had something to do it was for a purpose she was made a wash woman for a purpose don't despise where god has got you but serve your purpose he says don't despise where god has got you don't be trying to get somewhere else to serve your purpose don't think in your mind if i get this or if i do that or if i begin this or if i have this position or if i move to this i'll serve god's purpose don't despise your position don't despise where god has got you right now but serve your purpose there's coming a great victory day one of these days where the battle is over and notice moses he went down after he got his glasses focused and seen that it was god's program that he was to do he went down let's go to revelation 10 7. i want to end here with a thought what i'd like to do is moses went to the backside of his desert and he got his glasses focused so i'd like to look at revelation 10 7 and get our glasses focused so we can focus down on god's purpose and god's purpose in our day revelations 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets we live in the day that under the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god shall be finished the seven thunders had uttered their voices but john was told to write not but there was going to come a time when christ would come and he would come and work through a prophet and when he come through that prophet amen he would begin to give the interpretation of the thunders which was what and the mysteries that were contained in the seals and it was god that was doing that and what was he doing it was the mystery of god revealing the mysteries of god and he was in in doing that he was he was going to he was going to finish the mystery the singular mystery of god and so brother branham would come in july he finished the seals in march and he would come in july of the same year and he would preach christ is the mystery of god revealed and you if you catch revelations 10 7 when brother branham comes now to christ the mystery of god revealed he's preaching revelations 10 7. he's explaining to you what that mystery of god is the mystery of god is christ is the mystery of god revealed it's christ it's god revealed through christ what's christ doing revealing god so the mystery of god will be finished as the revelation coming through christ is being completed it is finishing the mystery of god because there's been a mystery about god and god's been portraying this mystery when we come to the end time he's going to he's going to begin to reveal the mystery what's been a mystery will become a secret what's been a mystery to everybody will become a secret to his bride and the reason we're going to this is i want to focus our glasses now on what is our purpose as individuals and the message christ is the mystery of god revealed prophet of god says now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery what are we going to talk about now god's purpose we get so distracted by all the things in the world so distracted by all the things we go through daily that we need to get our glasses focused again we have difficulties and we have strife and we have hardship and we've got all kinds of up and downs and this is just part of living in this life you know that god as we lived in this life he never took away all of the effects of the curse when he put us in this life he called us he quickened us to life but he never he didn't take away aging he didn't take away amen the fact that sickness will still come difficulties upon this earth we still suffer with many things like the rest of the world suffers but they suffer with no purpose we suffer with a purpose there's no direction for them the only purpose they have is a self-purpose amen but we have a different purpose and all of these things we may have the same things happen to us that happen to the world amen but our reaction should be different than the world's reaction because our glasses are focused to god's purpose and god's purpose is to live his life in individuals amen and so don't don't don't let me as i talk don't let me use terms that cause you to think bride i want to use terms that cause you to think me amen i want you to raise your hand and say he's talking about me amen let's focus our glasses down so you can see god's purpose is you amen god's purpose is realized in you god's purpose is displayed in you and the mystery of god is being revealed in you as an individual this is finishing the mystery of god now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living see then you will understand clearly then you see on i believe what is being done god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven through space of half an hour and seven thunders under their voices and john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't no now listen to the next statement he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and the acts of the believers in the bible has been type in type and expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and god's help well you'll see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it what is he talking about the seventh seal the mystery of god christ being the mystery of god revealed in your part in christ it says god had one purpose now if we could just focus to god's one purpose and focus on what god's one purpose is and then we could find ourselves in that purpose then we can begin to realize the purpose of everything we go through we can find our purpose we can find our purpose in trial we can find our purpose and difficulty we can find our purpose and blessings we can find our purpose in every way if we keep focused on what god's purpose is what is one goal what the one thing he wanted to achieve and what the entire bible has been typing out all through the bible has come down right to this today and it's come right down to you and i today and if we can keep focused on that purpose then everything that comes along we need to take god's purpose to the situation amen and understand how to react because if god now god's great purpose he's played it in a three-fold manner we talk about this all the time but i want to keep the keep expressing it until it becomes so second nature to us we don't even have to think about it it's just who we are it's a revelation so deep in our hearts so part of our experience that we just react out of this revelation that he had a threefold purpose and the first fold of this that he had he had one plan one goal one purpose but he unfolded it in a threefold manner first was to get preeminence in a man and he did that in christ jesus and second is to get preeminence in a body he's doing that now where is he doing it he's trying to do it and you and i that's part of this great mystery that's the second fold of this great mystery that god had that is laying under the seventh seal that is the secret that's the secret of his coming and you're part of it and what's he trying to do get preeminence in you and i so the next time the doctor says you've got xyz come back to this and say what's god's purpose he wants to display himself through this body and he wants me to respond in faith to the doctor saying you have xyz not in bitterness not in complaint not like elijah but i want to be like i want to be whatever god would be whatever christ would be in this body of flesh i want to respond that way in this situation because that's the mystery revealed what's the mystery revealed in our day the mystery revealed in our day is jesus christ and the formation of the bride so everything we go through we need to take this perspective this focus back to god's purpose and say how am i supposed to deal with this situation i'm supposed to let christ deal with it through me i'm not supposed to use my own mind i'm not supposed to try to fix it i'm not supposed to protect myself what i'm supposed to do is just surrender to god to take his word to believe it in the face of this situation and watch god overcome through this body of flesh watch him display himself over and over and over again that's what he was doing in the apostle paul that's what he wants to do in us again in christ is the mystery of god revealed he said he proves his resurrection life then as he vindicates himself she the bride is independent from all others she's an independent woman a great speckled bird that's different from all others remember the bible on that that great speckled bird but she had his name she had his life how did they speckle the bird they were both white and then they pulled the head off of one bird and drained the blood up upon the other bird and the other bird was speckled with the red blood and it flopped its wings like this and the blood cried holy holy holy as it bathed the ground so christ the dead mate put his blood his blood from his life amen it is carrying his blood crying holy holy holy unto the lord it's an odd looking bird sure it is but she's the bride is identified by him and she is independent from all others keep thee only under her as long as you both live keep the only unto him the word no adultery not one sign of denomination not one side of creed no adultery at all the word and him alone on christ a solid rock i stand all other ground as sinking sin that's it christ the word he was the word he is the word and the church becomes the word by him making her a part of him and that's the word again personally identified by him his property alone his property alone she is redeemed by him through him for him and for him alone that's right then what is the devil howling about that it's being revealed he's upset that it's being revealed that you are connected to the mystery of god that you are revealing the finishing of the mystery of god as god in the as the life of christ comes down and comes into you and begins to flow through you that you are now portraying this mystery that's laying in the seventh seal that it's you as an individual not you as a group not you as this church not you as the message as a whole but you as an individual are part of this mystery and you are displaying the mystery as you let the word flow through you that's what the devil's howling about that's why the devil will come and try to shut down that mystery by an obstacle he may he'll try to shut it down by a stoning or by a rejection or whatever he tries to shut it down but paul wasn't taking the bait he understood amen that he was part of that mystery and he was revealing amen the light and to the gentiles part of the word and he would get back up and continue in his commission and never stop until god said you're done and when he was done he couldn't stop the guillotine from chopping off his head because he had fulfilled god's purpose i want to keep my glasses focused the seventh seal is not doctrine oh i just want that to soak in the seventh seal is not doctrine it's god manifest through his attributes it is his great mystery of himself becoming tangible that's the seventh seal the seventh seal isn't doctrine you can't get somebody to it by doctrine it's a life it's his life it's his life having preeminence in you the seventh seal is not a doctrine it's god it's the mystery of god revealed it's god in these final days having a people so under his control that they only do his will and his will only that they face every obstacle believing in him trusting in him confident that his word will not fail confident that he will not fail them being a submissive bride being a wife that will reflect back to the husband perfect trust perfect confidence that's the mystery that's being refilled in this hour it's not doctrine friends it's a life it's not just a life it's his life the mysteries have been revealed to take us away from all denominational ideas that would that would bring anything else and mix anything else with this understanding it was opened up amen not for the purpose of doctrine but the doctrine was to bring us to this revelation amen so it wouldn't be us trying to achieve something it wouldn't be us trying to gain something it wouldn't be us trying to just understand something and by understanding it we would have an achievement that's not the purpose of the seals that's not why the mysteries have been revealed the mysteries have been revealed so that we wouldn't fall back into the same denominational trap that the church has falled into for 2000 years so that we would break away from all of man's ideas and all of man's injections that he injected into the word and come back to faith in the original word amen and come back to be the bride that he has always longed to have and the seventh seal is revealing this now amen that's why you are part of this mystery of the seventh seal you not not don't don't don't throw this off on anybody else but say right here he's revealing part of his threefold plan right here in me amen one purpose that he had from before the foundation of the world and every character in the bible has been typing it everything he wrote everything he said all the law and all the prophets and everything has been trying it's been trying to reveal this great mystery that god's had and he's been unfolding it all down through time amen and he unfolded the first fold when jesus christ was standing here who was a representative of god and a perfect reflection of the life of god and that was the first fold but the second fold was to take out of him a bride and build it through seven church ages and unite the two back together so that you would have standing on earth a bride that would act like a proper bride that would be what he has never had in the history of the world he would have a bride that would keep only to him and be subjected to him and reverence him and believe him and trust him and that's why you the seventh seal is not a doctrine it's not a fairy something far off that if i could only get to the seventh seal if it only was revealed i would have some mystery power no the power's already been given he's coming the fullness of his word to inject his full life into you into the bride so that you could have the very life of christ so that he could act out live out his his life his will his purpose his word in your flesh what does he need from us surrender what does he need what does every man need from his wife submission god is looking for us to submit when he says no we submit when he says yes we submit when he says go we submit when he says stop we submit what's he looking for somebody who trusts him enough enough that she doesn't have to inject herself or her own idea she can take it the way god sent it and trust him what is that that's the seventh seal on display let me read this a couple things to you so you'll see what i'm saying and the message desperations which he preached in the evening after he preached the token so now we have sometimes allowed it the lutherans allowed it to accepting the word accepting christ's personal savior the methodist said when you get happy enough to shout that's it the pentecostal says speak in tongues then you got it and we find out that all of it was wrong see and the token is the token it's you and christ as persons together it's the holy spirit his life in you working his own life through you it's for rich the poor for whosoever will receive it galatians 4 19 the apostle paul says in little children of whom i travail and birth again until christ be formed in you what was paul laboring to produce christ in the church that's what paul was laboring he was in another birth pains he was travailing again in birth what was he trying to do to the galatians he was trying amen he was he was trying he was travailing at birth so christ be formed in you that was the purpose of his gospel that's why brother branham would take us back to the gospel that paul preached because paul was trying to birth christ in a church the message things that are to be says now if you are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god and the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living martin luther could not express the attributes that we express because that was in the beginning the resurrection like the corn of the wheat that went into the earth martin luther was the beginning of the resurrection what was god doing resurrecting his bride tree through martin luther through wesley through pentecost but now he's come to the restoration of the bride tree to have the fruit on the tree what is the fruit the same life that jesus christ lived is now to live in his bride what is that that's the mystery of god revealed that's the second full mystery coming into full revelation and coming into full manifestation god needs a yielded vessel the seventh seal isn't to be taught it's to be manifested seventh seal isn't to be taught in some way i mean we teach about the sentence of course we'll always teach the word and that's the revelation of our hour i don't mean that we're not going to teach but the seven seals and to be taught it's to be lived it's to be displayed it's to be manifested you're at home as a mother with little babies what kind of mother are you to be you're to be a seven seal mother you as a daddy uh overseeing a family and shepherding a flock what are you to be you're to be a seven seal daddy you're to be a christ daddy and a christ mommy what is that that's the display of this hour that's the manifestation in this hour that's bride wherever he's placed you as bride amen you may be mom you may be dad you may be a worker somewhere you maybe have an office in the church it doesn't matter where you're at don't despise where he placed you but be bride and be the manifestation of the seventh seal wherever you're planted if it's grandma grandpa this one now it doesn't matter what titles and what positions whether it's male or female forget all of that and say the seventh seal needs to be displayed right here in this flesh right now and for him to have the display that he needs the preeminence i've got to submit to my headshot and everything he says in all of his directions i just want to yield and say god be it unto you according to your word colossians 1. we read it all the time but i'm going to read it again colossians 1 26. even the mystery which has been hid from ages from generations but now has made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory the seventh seal in the first fold was god in christ and in the second fold is christ in his bride that's why the word was restored this day so we knew what to submit to we knew who to submit to we knew what it was like what word it was to live and to reflect in this day that's why god sent us profit in this day and the message i'm going to read a couple quotes and we'll finish the meanest man i know he says we we can't never compare with the world we're doing wrong by trying to act like the world we're never can compare with them and we've got no business out on their grounds bring them over on our grounds we got something they haven't got we go to act like them then we know we're saying something we haven't got let the world come to us not us go out after the world you know hollywood shines but the gospel glows there's a lot of difference between shining and glowing glow not shine with the outward appearance glow on the inside by the holy ghost with sweetness meekness gentleness patience and love glow don't shine shine is after the world the church is a whole lot like it was in the days of esther esther didn't take the perfuming of the women she adorned herself with modest apparel the hidden man of the heart and the king said put the crown on her head esther was the type of the church today those who are ready to come out and adorn themselves with the sweetness of the holy spirit not the perfuming and the dressing of the world try to compare with them but the hidden man of the heart that's the one the other man said the church is a whole lot like esther today esther we know was taken and she was taken with all the virgins and she was taken into the care of haggai who had to care of the virgins and and haggy i put her in a place and gave her maids and he gave her everything she needed for for her anointing and for her preparation amen to be united with the king and she listened to haggai who is the prophet of the day for us our haggai he gave us everything we needed he gave us all the instructions we needed he gave us everything we needed to be ready to be prepared to meet the king and the scripture says if esther when it was her turn to go into the king she required nothing but what haggaid the chamberlain had given her had required of her that means she didn't take her own idea she didn't take her own wishes she didn't take her own once amen whatever that prophet said amen was good enough for her amen if the prophet said this is what god likes and this is what god wants if that if that haggy i said the king likes it this way and the king likes it that way i think you should wear this outfit i think you should put this with it i think this goes together she had no mind of her own but she knew that that haggai had been to where that king was and knew the mind of the king and the church today is not supposed to be taking perfumes of the world and her own ideas and denominational ideas but what that prophet brought to us was what we needed to unite with the king and when the king saw that esther come there was something different about esther than all the other virgins because all the other virgins could take anything they want but esther the scriptures as esther required nothing but what heggie i had provided that means she had an opportunity she could pick out the dress she wants she could pick out the attire she could go in this perfume and that and in this and everyone who come before the king that was not acceptable not acceptable not acceptable not acceptable but when the one came that came only the way haggai had prepared her when he looked at her he saw a character that he could trust in and it was a character that was different than vashti's because vashti's character was self-willed and then when the king called for her she stayed back but when he looked at esther and esther only had what haggai had provided all the way he had said and how he addressed her what he had told her to take when he saw one that would be obedient to haggai he said that's the one that i'll put the crown on and that's the one that i'll let be my wife and the bride's got to be of the same mind today amen we're not here to protect ourselves defend ourselves make ourselves better do something special we're just here to submit to the leadership that god has given us in this day and to receive his word and to submit to that word and in submitting to that word he's going to find a bride that reflects his own character because what was the character of jesus christ the character of jesus christ was i only do that which the father shows me jesus christ was a man who is under complete perfect submission to the father he can't have any other kind of wife it's the only wife that he can have because he can only have a wife that reflects his character brother braham says in choosing of a bride the kind of wife a man chooses shows what kind of character he is and god cannot choose a bride that doesn't have his character and the bride of his character will be the one that's submissive to the father in all things christ is the mystery god revealed again he says there is only one thing can happen there has to be a message at the end time when there is nothing else can follow it and now the ecumenical world has set up such a regime that there can be no denomination and no nothing else follow him you're either in it or you're not the fruit is in the top of the tree and the light is shining on that predestinated fruit and she is ripening into christ like bringing forth the same mellowness and sweetness the same spirit that he had in him i hope you see it we saw it brother says i hope you see it did you see it i saw it in that man he was submissive to his heavenly father he was submissive and obedient to the word in all things when he was wrong he was corrected by the holy spirit he came back and he made it right see if we say that we have the revelation of the seventh seal but we have an arrogant condemning critical judgmental nature i don't think we have the revelation of the seventh seal because it's to bring forth christ like fruit to be like him brother bev says in the message how can i overcome he said sanctify us lord fill us anew with thy holy spirit may the holy ghost just reign in our hearts supremely that we'll walk forgetting the things that are in the past the muck the mire that we once lived in we're pressed towards the mark of the high calling where our lights can so shine and sweetness and humility till every passerby can say there's a christian lives there on that hill that person that woman that man is a real consecrated created flower of god they're so sweet and so kind always loving and sweet and understanding granite father let us be salty that the earth might thirst granite father and overcome the things of this world and the cares of this life in the name of jesus christ i don't want to verbalize my faith in my revelation of the seventh seal i want to demonstrate the seven seal i don't believe that all that god has done is on our generation and all the manifestations and the magnificent things we've seen and the tying together the loose sins and the opening of the seals i don't believe that all that was done so that we had doctrine that we could talk about but continue acting the way we acted before that we could not no longer have denominational ideas but we can have denominational behavior then we no longer have worldly ideas but we have worldly mechanisms for protecting ourselves or worldly mechanisms for figuring things out i don't think that's why god did all that he did in this day but i believe he did it in this day so that we can rise above out of ourselves and then leave ourselves behind and let christ enter in and submit like no bride has ever submitted before i don't want to just verbalize the seventh seal if all i've ever done in my life is verbalize the seventh seal i still missed the purpose of god remember christ is mystery god revealed how many purposes does god have god's great goal through the whole bible how many goals did he have and christ is the mystery of god review he says he has one goal one purpose one achievement that he's been trying to achieve all along and he reveals it in a three-fold manner the second part of that is his preeminence in me i don't want to talk about that and never live it but i say let the seventh seal be alive in you and i how do i do it brother chad just surrender just say lord i trust you see i think it's such a matter of trust in our day do we trust him oh we trust him when everything's going right but whenever everything goes wrong do we have the same confidence that we always had in him do you have the same confidence in his word and do we have the same confidence in who we are in christ i want to display that same nature he had a submission of sweetness of gentleness of kindness and just let him flow through me i want to read this last scripture to you as we close colossians 3 17 and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him let everything you do all your life and all your reactions and all your actions may you do it all in the name of jesus christ because the bride bears the husband's name and let's focus our glasses and focus back to god's purpose and forget every other purpose and focus down to this purpose and remember who we are and what he's done through us let's all stand musicians if you'll come and brother ben i hope more than ever that we're realizing more and more that the seals aren't about doctrine it's about an understanding that understanding wasn't just to bring us uh wiser smarter and more noble than the than the pentecostals or the lutherans or the westlands or it wasn't any of that it was god peeling back the mystery of redemption peeling back who we are and where we came from and why we're here and where we're going so that he could manifest the seventh seal in this world in this day and i say let's give it more than lip service let's give it life service let's let it be tangible alive so when jesus when they looked at jesus and they said to jesus show us the father and it will suffice jesus says have i been so long with you and you don't know me when you've seen me you've seen the father and if somebody will say show me jesus christ you told me he came in 63 show me jesus christ i want to live in such a way i say have you been with me so long and you don't see him for it's him living in me this is not my life anymore i had a different kind of life but he took over and it's a different life and now i'm trusting in him and i'm living for him i'm submitted to him it was god through christ and now christ through his bride and let everything we do with word and deed do all in the name of the lord jesus christ let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word god how we

that god will put what was in my heart into your heart words are not adequate we take so much time to try to explain and never can come to the point but i know that whatever jesus christ was to god i am to be the christ and one of the attributes that he's played that was so marvelous was his absolute trust in his father he had absolute trust and confidence in god and i want more than anything else for all my actions and all my words i want everything to display an absolute trust in christ that i completely trust him that i don't doubt his care for me i don't doubt his love for me i don't doubt his watchfulness for me that the way i speak and the way i react and everything that i do will show that i trust him and i can submit to him more if it just give me the power by his spirit to yield more my desire is to yield more to show him that i trust him because if i show him that i trust him it's proof that i love him and i know who he is and i know who i am so i say i love you all you know with these things that we talk about they seem so difficult to live the very life of jesus christ have perfect trust and perfect faith and how could you even preach it it wasn't for the fact that god sent a prophet and said it's possible that this is the age for christ to be displayed in his bride and if it's possible if the potentials are here if the life is here then i want to say god let that life live through me it's here it's available it's not far away it's here in the revealing of the word his life has come back to abide in his bride it's possible in this hour if it's possible and i'm yours and you just need a vessel i want to say a fresh lord i'm your vessel you can have your way with me i want to trust him every part of my life god bless you as you go we love you let's just sing
