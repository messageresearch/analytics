surely the presence [Music] amen god bless you this morning man it's so good to be here together i really enjoyed that special brother tom thank you so much amen it's always good to hear you sing brother i mean while we're standing i'd like for us to pray together i found out last evening that sister rachel pitzenberger and sister sarah mcdivert's sister rhoda passed away last evening we've been praying for her for quite a while she struggled with poor health and the latest was in need of a valve replacement she'd been waiting for and and uh god chose to take her home last evening so i'd like for us to stand together and just pray for those families this is a big loss this is a very dear sister to both of them and a twin sister to sister rachel and so they've been very close all three of them been very close and so we take it as a as a loss and a loss for the assembly because rhoda was a friend of many of ours we knew her we were very well acquainted with her and she's always so happy and cheerful and full of life and she's full of faith and god had delivered her so many times we were looking forward to a testimony coming from this but no matter what we pray and how often we ask we always resign ourselves to god's sovereign will and god is perfect in all of his ways and when it goes a different way than what we anticipate we still put all of our trust in him for god does what is best in every situation but let's bow our heads together and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father we thank you lord that you understand our grief for you lord partook and flesh you stood at the grave of lazarus and you wept and you understand our weeping lord and god you've promised that you would be a comforter to us and i know lord sister rachel and sister sarah and their families and the family who wrote them they all need your comfort right now i prayed you'd go to them and undergird them by your hand lord strengthen them by your spirit comfort them with your very presence lord god we thank you for all that you did for rhoda how many times you healed her how many times you delivered her and lord we know that you do all things well so we're trusting in you and your decision to take her but god we're asking that you would help the grieving hearts that you would mend the broken hearts that you would help the families bless them as the next few days as they make arrangements and move towards a funeral lord i pray you would help them through it all and be very present help in a time of trouble be the strong power that they can run into and be safe lord envelope them with your love and let your presence be known among them help us as an assembly to encourage them to bless them and help them any way we can we love you father we thank you for your tender mercies and your grace how dearly you care for your children it means so much to us at times like this we ask your blessing over the service this morning as we look into your word would you open the word for us and open our hearts to receive it and take this word lord is the washing of the water the word and changes wash us cleanse us change us to match this word that you've given to us let us in all things be pleasing to you and may you have preeminence among us we pray in jesus christ's name we pray amen and god bless you while you're standing let's take our bibles if you would and turn to first timothy chapter one i want to say it was so exciting to see brother dave wood at his post of duty he was passing out the balance collecting them in his seat back there watching the door which is where he was last sunday and then between last sunday and this sunday the things that god has done for our brother is amazing amen so god is so good and so faithful and god knew that brother dave has a work to do he's got to get back to the door he couldn't let him be down too long so god got to undertook for him and we're thankful for them amen let's look here in 1st timothy and we're going to read uh verse 5 which is the verse we ended with last sunday it says now the end of the commandment is charity or love out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned or without pretense or without hypocrisy so the end of the commandment if you want to know at the end of the commandment what god desires the end of it all the the purpose and all of it the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and a faith unfeigned amen god bless you as you're seated and i want to continue on uh with a little bit of the thought from last sunday and i'd like to speak on lord willing the motive of the heart the motive of the heart you'll remember we talked about how last week the prophet of god called the thyatiran age the believers in the thyroid age the cream of the crop and we wanted to know why they were the cream of the crop and they were the cream of the crop because their works amen they did out of love their works in their service was done in love in a time when they were not receiving benefits i mean they weren't living a blessed life in the way of natural things they were under extreme persecution imprisonment loss of property they had it was during the dark ages and when the power of the catholic church had come to its peak and they were they were trying to snuff out amen the true religion and the believers that did not go along amen with their with their faith and and god speaks to them and says i know thy works and my love and my service and my patience and my faith and again he says in the end thy works and the last to be greater than the first meaning that even at the end of the age the works they were doing was even increasing as the tribulation with mountains as time would go on and in every other church age the works were diminishing amongst the believers it was going into weakness but these under the most intense of persecution in the dark of the days for the true word of god their works were continuing because they were born out of love amen not for reward not for benefit but it was just simply born out of love they served god because they loved god what a motive amen to serve god so i'd like to continue on with that thought and minister lord willing on the motive of the heart let's turn to psalm 24 together and keep your bible handy i'd like to flip to quite a few scriptures here early on psalm 24 and verse 3 psalm 24 and verse 3. who shall ascend unto the hill of the lord or who shall stand in his holy place he that hath clean hands and a pure heart who has not lifted up his soul into vanity nor sworn deceitfully amen he shall receive the blessings from the lord and righteous in righteousness from the god of his salvation so who will attain to the hill of the lord who will stand in the holy place he that hath clean hands and a pure heart and hasn't puffed up his soul in vanity nor sworn deceitfully he was honest and true sincere and clean in his life this is the one that will make it and brother braham says in the message god keeps his word he says our god we come to thee in the name of the beloved son who has bid us to come saying ask the father anything in my name and i'll do it. so we come in jesus name to first repent of our own sin and our shortcomings and to ask thee to cleanse us and from cleanse us from all of our iniquity and to purge our thinking and that we will think upon the things that are right and pertaining to the kingdom of god now listen this is amazing this is the prophet of the age he's praying amen at this service and he's asking god to forgive him of his sins and his shortcomings and his failures amen needs he's honest to me this is a pure heart not somebody who will never admit to having sin or shortcoming or mistakes or failures but somebody who will so readily say i i am nothing without god i can't do it on my own amen that's a pure heart amen it goes on to say and may our thoughts be tonight on something that would better the kingdom of god and would better the people that are in the kingdom and may our hearts be purged from all foul things we desire to walk upright before thee with clean hands and a pure heart and oh god alone can do this amen we desire to walk with an upright heart with a pure heart and clean hands but only god can do that we can't do that ourselves and that's why he's praying this prayer oh god alone can do this and we pray father to cleanse our hands and purify our hearts wash us in the waters of separation from the things of the world by the word amen so we need the word of god in this day to purge us to wash us it's the waters of separation it's the washing of the water of the word amen and the word that has been restored in this day is a pure word and a clean word and it's here to purify us amen but it didn't just come to to purify the outside of us because you know you can you can take religion and fight man's religion you can bring a pure exterior amen but that's not the purpose the purpose in the end time is to have a pure heart amen a pure heart with pure motives a pure mind a clean mind a clean thought realm a mind that's focused and centered on christ a heart that desires him and him alone amen and in order to have that in such corrupt human flesh because remember the prophet of god told us every age from the fall man has grown weaker and wiser all the time there's a deterioration of humanity humankind because of hybridization because of the fall and the fallen condition and the perversion that is in our flesh and the perversion that is in the word and the world the corruption amen the these bodies in our minds amen are growing weaker all the time and so in an age that's so defiled amen come to the peak of defilement in humanity amen it's going to take a powerful word that can wash these hearts clean amen that can cleanse our minds when we live in a world where there's messages portrayed everywhere you turn your eyes and amen there's ungodliness there's there's lustful things there's there's wrong desires everything that is contrary to god is so visible and so visibly on display amen it's going to take a powerful word amen that can be the washing of the water of the word that can wash and purify our minds that can purify our hearts that can give us clean hands and oh god alone can do this let's turn to isaiah isaiah 29 isaiah 29 and verse 13. isaiah 29 and 13. wherefore the lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips do honor me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of man what he's saying is that their respect and reverence their fear of me is taught by the precept of man meaning the religious order and the traditions and the precepts the teachings of man are what are what keeping the people and respect to god but it is not the pureness of their heart it is the it is the precepts of man the teaching of man that are keeping them in the fear of god amen and that's not what god wanted he wanted a people that served him because they loved him amen if god just wanted subjects he could create subjects amen and he could put them under amen a tyrannical rule and where there's no liberty there's no free choice amen there's none of these things that god has given to humanity amen but he can just set up his laws set up his structures he can give absolutely no wiggle room and he can have subjects that would worship him and they would worship him in a pure clean way because there would be no uncleanness he could have people i mean he could have subjects that would be dressed right that would look right that would act right that would talk right and that would worship him the way he wants to be worshipped amen but that wasn't the desire of his heart amen he wanted people who could choose anything they wanted and in anything they wanted they would choose him that's what god wants that's what he's after in this day amen and and we know that the heart purpose of god was to have a bride of his own choosing and so he would choose a bride but he wanted to choose a bride that would choose him back amen he wasn't looking for a slave he wasn't looking for a subject he's looking for a companion he's looking for the the the counterpart of himself somebody that he can love that would love him back and so he says they're they they draw near me with their mouth and their lips to honor me but they remove their heart far from me so on the outside everything looked good but god looked deeper than the outside it looked fine it was fine and in the appearance it was fine in words it was fine in deeds but it wasn't fine in the heart let's go to ezekiel 33. ezekiel 33 and 31. ezekiel 33 and 31 and they cut they come unto thee as the people cometh and they sit before thee as my people he's talking about they come to ezekiel to hear the words of the prophet they come unto thee as the people cometh and they sit before thee as my people and they hear thy words but they will not do them for with their mouth they show much love but their heart goeth after their covetousness they sit they come they sit they listen they come and they act like the people of god they come and listen as though they're people of the god and with their mouth they show much love but they don't do what the prophet said do amen in their heart they hold covetousness and all appearances they're the people of god and all appearances in all words amen they show much love amen but when the prophet gives instructions from god they won't do what the prophet said do and god could pierce through all the actions all the conduct addressed the words and he could go down into the heart and say they show much love with the mouth but their heart is far from you let's go to matthew chapter 15. we're going to stay in matthew for a little while now matthew chapter 15 i'd like to read verse 8 jesus picks up what isaiah had said he said this people draw an eye unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me so you can see that jesus was not interested in religion that god was not just interested in religious act or religious service but god was interested in the motive of the heart let's go to matthew 23. matthew chapter 23 verse 1 then speak jesus to the multitude and to his disciples saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses's seat and all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do not for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers he's showing here a lack of care in the ministry he's showing that that they're teaching the fear of god by the pretense of man or the doctrines of man and they're creating heavy burdens for the people to bear by adding traditions and adding to the law of moses and they're creating a system that looks holy and looks righteous and looks clean and what they've done is they've added to amen the word and they've got the whole form and ritual and it looks so clean and they bind grievous burdens upon people but they do nothing themselves to lift the burden and what's amazing is when god gave requirements to his children god came down and he provided a means to meet the requirement and when they found that humanity could no longer meet it he provided himself as a lamb to meet the requirement because they couldn't do it so he eased everybody's burden himself that's a that's true ministry he's pointing to the difference between himself between god god wants holy living god wants people to live clean amen but then god will now come and through the death and shed blood of jesus christ and the sanctifying power of that blood he will now provide the spirit that will help you live the word he doesn't just give burden amen and does nothing not lift one finger to ease the burden but he'll tell you this is how you need to live this reflects my life and character and i will come down and i will be the power that lives it through you if you'll yield to me amen so so the the pharisees they built something that looked nice and they added doctrines and they and rituals and rules and bound them to the people but they themselves did nothing to lift a finger showing that they didn't care about the people they cared about the system and they cared about the appearance but they didn't care about the souls amen verse 5 says but all their works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments the phylacteries were they were they were little parchments that they wrote out the law of moses they would roll them up put them in a little box and attach them to leather straps and wrap them around their forehead and around their arm amen and so the the pharisees wouldn't just wear the phylacteries because they're supposed to have the word on their mind and the word in their hand and near their heart so that they wouldn't just have phylacteries like everybody else but they would broaden their phylactery so everybody could see how much they honored the word how much how righteous they were so they they it wasn't good enough just to wear the word like they were instructed to wear it they broadened the factories and brought them the border of their garment so everybody could see how religious they were and how much they loved god and god pierced right through that and said they show that they love but they don't love everything they do is to be seen of men all right everything they do is to be seen of men let's keep reading verse six and they love the uppermost rooms of feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the markets and to be called of men rabbi rabbi but be not ye called rabbi for one is your master even christ and all ye are brethren and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven neither be called masters for one is your master even christ but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted jesus was the perfect example of this this word that he's giving he humbled himself under the hand of god he humbled himself to bear the reproach of sin he humbled himself amen and subjected himself he subjected himself to earthly rulers he subjected himself even to religious rulers he he humbled himself on this earth amen and and he became the example for us but the the false ministry amen all they wanted to do was to be seen and recognized by men they didn't want to be recognized as a rabbi as a master they wanted the chief seats they wanted to be recognized they wanted to be greeted they wanted to be seen they wanted to be heard they wanted to be religious and so they gave the pretense or they gave the image to everybody else that they are a very religious person but god knew in their heart that they were deceitful they were wicked amen and in their heart was corruption let's go let's get down to verse 25. in verse 25 he says woe unto you scribes pharisees hypocrites for you may clean the outside of the cup of the platter but within they're full of extortion and excess thou blind pharisees cleanse first that which is within the cup and the platter that the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you scribes pharisees hypocrites for you are likened to whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness even so you also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity jesus knew that they were pretending and he knew that they were actually defiant in areas against the word of god amen but they were putting on like they were so religious this is the problem of living in a religious society the the israel in that day when you lived in jerusalem it was a very religious society amen and there was a hierarchy that was based not only in government but also in the religious realm and to live in a religious society amen it creates this kind of desire in people amen to be more religious to for the acceptance and for the admiration of other human beings amen and this is an absolute false religion but the reality is i don't i want to get to the place where i don't really care what anybody else thinks of me think good or think bad i would prefer you think good but if you think bad then you think bad but what matters most to me in all my life is what god thinks of me that how he views me is how i want i want to live for his pleasure for his view for his acknowledgement for his for for him to say you're doing good son that's what we live for amen and if we live for that we'll always come out right amen it doesn't matter how many mistakes we might make and stumblings we might make or what people may agree with us or disagree with us or think we're godly or think we're antichrist amen at the end of the day none of that matters and you can't control those things anyways no matter how hard you try to live clean before everybody somebody will misjudge your motives they'll misunderstand your actions they'll mislabel you and misrepresent you so we we need not to be trying to please men and get men to think well of us but we need to please god amen so we know that god thinks well of us because we love him more than anything else amen every one of god's chosen vessels every one of god's servants was loved and hated every one of them and so there's no point in trying to please man amen the pharisees they wanted they wanted the acknowledgement of man not the acknowledgement of god amen but that's not what we want to be like and it's going to take god to help us from going down that road because we live and still what tends to be very much a religious society especially in this part of america we're still part of what a remnants of the bible belt and there's still people you work with very religious there's churches everywhere it's a religious society and even growing up amen in the message and growing up in the realms of christianity it can create this this uh this desire to please everybody with this is a normal social pressure so wherever you grow up wherever atmosphere you grow up you want to fit in that's just the way it is and you want to be accepted by the people you're around and you want to be acknowledged as a good person by and it doesn't matter what environment you grow up amen if if you grew up in a muslim society you would have the same desire to be a good muslim to be respected by the other people to be accepted in society and be promoted in that society but the new birth changes all of that and it says now it doesn't matter where i grow up in what environment i grew up good or bad environment religious or non-religious i all i want to do is please the one who died for me man all i want to do is to gain favor with the one who showed me favor when i was unlovable he loved me anyways amen so so there's human tendencies that we must fight against there's human nature that we must always be at war against and the moment that we start to believe that we've rose above all social pressure and all human tendencies and all human nature you've we're setting ourselves up for a stumble but you got to realize that i live inside my enemy the greatest enemy i got is this flesh i was born into and i'm so close to it amen and so we we never need to we need to never lose sight of how close the enemy is and how how the devil's always trying to find avenue to find gain access through that old nature through that that carnality that remains in the flesh and in a fallen mind and we need to guard ourselves against these things guard ourselves against pride guard ourselves against desiring the acceptance of mankind and guard our heart against these things and constantly be coming back to what does god want what does god care about what matters most to god brother branham in the message the voice of the sign he's speaking of the uh when he goes by samaria he says i have needs to go by samaria and when he goes he sends away his disciples because there's a little woman there that he wants to talk to and she's a woman that's steeped in defilement she's living a defiled life she's she had several husbands the one she's with now is not her own and she's on the sixth and she's in this terrible terrible condition but here's what the prophet says says like the little woman with a pure heart and a defiled body and the pharisee with a pure body and a defiled heart it condemned one and saves the other here comes this woman with an absolute defiled body the pharisee you remember when the rich young ruler come to jesus christ and he says what must i do to gain eternal life to inherit eternal life and he says you know the commandments you know don't steal honor father and mother and he starts to go through some of the commandments that moses gave and he says i've done all of these from my youth this is a picture of a pharisee he he had lived clean he had lived pure he had done him from his youth amen and so he he felt pretty good about his condition and he was able to answer and the affirmative to jesus when he gave him some requirements to me he said i've met all of these requirements for my youth so he did not have a defiled body amen and he was obedient to the law of moses and and he was walking in the statutes and the judgments of the lord amen and right there in the midst of the the religion of the day amen but jesus said to him if thou will be perfect if that will be perfect sell all thou has and given to the poor and come follow me and and the man went away sorrowfully for he had much goods and jesus wept after him because jesus loved him amen jesus statement was not a statement of condemnation because he didn't love him it was an opportunity for this man to go past the religion and come to the reality pass the form past the ritual past the respect of people amen what would have happened to this man if he sold all of his goods where would he have been in society what would the religious leaders of the day thought of him well he would have been a fool he would have been mocked he would have been an outcast then he would have been nobody all the friends that he had would have no longer been friends if he had sold all of his wealth given to the poor and come follow jesus he would be just as much outcast as everybody else that followed jesus was and this man wasn't willing he wanted eternal life but he did not want to have a perfect heart jesus wasn't looking for those who just wanted a reward he was looking for those who wanted him he comes to a couple illiterate fishermen and all that they have is the boat in the net maybe a home maybe a change of clothes poor illiterate fishermen and they're washing their nets and he says come follow me and they dropped everything they had and they went and they followed the lord that's what he was looking for he stood by the treasury one day and he watched rich men blow trumpets and walk up with great pomp and great flair and ceremony and drop gold coins and silver and they probably dropped enough in to make it really rattle when it hit i mean they had blown the trumpet everybody now they had everybody's attention so you can't just you know it can't be ping what's the point of blowing the trumpet you know you got to pour in a bag and hand your stew for another bag and smile and look around at who's looking at you while you pour them back who's seeing me do this but there was a little widow with only two mites and she slipped up because she didn't have anything to be proud about she didn't have anything to boast about she didn't want anybody's attention because she didn't want anybody to see how little she could give to the lord but she took her two minds and she dropped them into the treasury no fanfare no pomp no ceremony no accolades no respect of mankind amen she wasn't pleasing anybody else and nobody else was pleased with what she did except one man standing there that day and that man was god in flesh and he looked at disciples and he said to see this woman she has put in just two mites that these have put in of their great abundance of their wealth but she put in all that she had [Music] and that was the offering that got the attention of god that was what was dropped in the treasury that day that god was pleased with and got the attention of god it's just amazing i was talking to somebody the other day and i thought we think of the judgment of rewards and and how uh the scripture says he that is faithfulness shall be made ruler over cities he is faithful and the least shall be made ruler over cities and so we know there's a judgment of rewards and those rewards will be dished out and we will we will be uh we will have responsibilities and works and things to do in the millennium and we will also be part of the government and those of us will be given rain over certain areas maybe governors magistrates of a city a village a uh i don't know a country i don't know but to whom much those who are faithful and little shall be made ruler over cities and i was thinking wouldn't it be ironic if the great preacher of the day makes it through the judgment of rewards and when we get to the millennium he's in charge of a village but the widow sister who nobody really knew about when we go through the judgment of rewards and get to the millennium she's governor and regent over a huge area and you say what because she gave all she had and she was faithful in everything god had for her to do whereas somebody who's tremendously gifted and equipped and has everything handed to them has support has help has finances has gifts amen and they do half-heartedly what god has given them to do they will not receive the same reward as those who maybe have less gifts no support no finances no helps around them but with what god gave them to do they were perfectly faithful and did it with all of their hearts [Music] it's amazing god has a certain equity and he knows how to keep everything in equity who much is given much is required and those who are faithful in the least shall be made ruler over much and so god judges the heart and he knows he knows what's in our heart there's no hiding it from him i mean we sometimes we even try to deceive ourselves and i would say the very worst deception of all self-deception that's what lucifer suffered from suffers from is self-deception and that is the worst deception of all is self-deception and it's amazing how sometimes uh you find such a need in humanity to rehearse our accolades to recycle the testimonies to talk about you know you know god did this and and i prayed and this person was healed and i went to that person and they come to the lord and i did this and i had this experience and i had that experience these testimonies are wonderful and encouraging to share but sometimes you see that that for certain individuals they become uh they become a a type of justification they become a type of measuring by which they measure their spirituality i say that's a terrible way to measure our spirituality man we must measure ourselves against the word and the desire in our heart to keep that word for love of god amen to love god first amen we can have all kinds of accomplishments in the spiritual realm we can have a i mean if you have a gift of faith and a gift of healing you can pray for tons of people and they'll get better but it doesn't mean that you have a pure heart before god it means that you have a gift same thing with preaching you can preach and preach in a way that blesses multitudes of people but it doesn't automatically equate to a pure heart and we think because people were blessed by the preaching that i'm accepted by god no people can be blessed because there's a gift and god will even allow the operation of the gift and the pool of the people are 50 of the gifts and they're going to be a wonderful tremendous service people can be blessed in that service amen but but at the end of the day that service how well the word was divided and how much the people were blessed is not the measure of how accepted you are by god or how pleasing you are to the lord amen what the the only measure is did you serve god from a pure heart amen was it was it a pure heart or did you like amen that people said that was a good service do we do it for the people how do we do it for god same thing with writing a song or singing a song or playing an instrument or or serving in any capacity or doing anything that god has gifted you to do it falls the same way who is it done for because if it's done because you like the attention if it's done because you like the praise now listen don't don't get me wrong amen if you know that god used you and it blessed somebody that feels like a million bucks and it ought to there should be such a satisfaction and knowing that god can take you a lump of clay use you for some purpose and it would bless one of his children that would that feels good it should always feel good but that feeling good can never equate to way that god views you just be happy that somebody was blessed and you felt good brother branham one time said there was a man that a man come up to him and said oh i just hate it when i preach and people said it was a good sermon or we appreciate that and brother bam said well i'm just more honest than you i like it i can say i like it too but when when people are done shaking your hand and patting you on the back and telling you they appreciate your song or your sermon they appreciate your family appreciate your life when you go back home and kneel down are you serving god with a pure heart amen was it done for him these are important questions to ask let's turn to first samuel first samuel chapter 16. in first samuel 16 verse 6 saul has been sent to anoint a new king over israel in verse 6 and suddenly came to pass when they were come that he looked at eliab which is the oldest brother of david the oldest of jesse's sons and said surely the lord's anointed is before him but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of a stature because i have refused him for the lord seeth not as a man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart when god wanted the king he wanted a king after his own hearts the first king that he chose for israel was was a king after their choosing based off what they wanted and that choosing got a man who was powerful and he was head and shoulders taller and above all the other men in the kingdom so he gave them a warrior a powerful man a man of great stature to be their king that was their desire and when that desire failed amen now god was going to seek a king after his desire amen a man after his own heart god wasn't interested whether he's tall or short whether he was strong or weak god was looking at his heart because god can provide everything else that's needed god's not depending on our power our mind our strength he's not depending on our gifts god is god is not dependent on what we can bring to the table amen when we come to the lord it's not all of a sudden like god was seeking after you because you had a good ball of gifts inside of you and you got some mental prows and some strength and you got some support and god's like i need this one he'll do me a good job that's not what god wants amen god wants a willing heart a surrendered heart a perfect heart he can provide everything else and so jesus remember he says in in the gospel he says you heard it had been said a time of old that a man should not commit adultery but i say unto you he that looketh after a woman to lust after has committed adultery with her already in his heart you can see how when jesus shows up he is so unraveling the system of the day because i mean they knew not to commit adultery they had clean bodies but they had defiled hearts amen and in the clean body they may be able to say well i never committed adultery i never this and i never that they could even say i never stole but what they did is they changed the law of god and added a few more commandments so that they could strip a little wealth from their parents and put it back in their pocket so they stole but they stole in a religious way and then they because they didn't commit adultery but jesus comes down a couple layers deeper and say you know in your flesh you may never take in your flesh and committed the act but if you looked after a woman to lust after her you have committed adultery already with her in your heart because it's the heart that matters amen it's not that the flesh doesn't matter amen but the flesh you can get right and have the heart wrong and everything's still wrong amen you can have the flesh completely wrong but get the heart right and a right heart will work its way out to the flesh and bring the flesh subject to the life on the inside that's why he said you you whited walls you you whited sepulchers amen outside your clean you wash the outside of the pot oh he said you're fools amen wash the inside so that the out can be clean outside can be cleaned too you're like sepulchers outside they're white and they're pretty amen but inside they're full of dead men's bones amen god is concerned with what goes on in our heart until our heart is right we're not right coming to church every service paying tithes every service amen giving offerings giving to the poor helping one another those are good things and they ought to be done and they never should be diminished but all of them will not make us right the only thing that will make us right is within our heart we worship god from a pure heart and surrender to him with all of our hearts that's what makes us right so we got to fight the deception you know when when when we live in a place where we can encourage one another and we have friendship and camaraderie with one another and we we create such a atmosphere the believers create such an atmosphere you can be held a little bit by atmosphere you can be kept somewhat by atmosphere because you know these are friends these are family these are people that you love and you don't want to disappoint them and you don't want to look bad in their eyes and you don't want to hurt anybody else so we resist certain kinds of sin because of the atmosphere right because what will the people at church think what will my family think i don't want to disappoint i don't want them to hurt i don't want them to think bad and that atmosphere it's not a wrong atmosphere it's not a bad evil wicked atmosphere but that atmosphere which should be there ought to be there it can hold us a little bit amen and there can come a deception from that and saying i haven't committed adultery i haven't stole i haven't did this i haven't done that amen and i don't even get a speeding ticket because i know what the quote says but god wants to go deeper than being held by an atmosphere or being part of a church no matter how correct it is or how on the word it is that's not what god's interested in god's interested in your heart the church should be right the atmosphere should be right the conduct should be right there ought to be holiness there needs to be holiness it's a requirement in this day amen but what needs to be clean is your heart needs to be cleaned first and then the outside will be clean let's go to matthew chapter 6. remember the pharisee that goes into the temple and there was a publican i believe it was there and the publican would not so much as raise his head and he beat upon his chest and he said god forgive me and save me a sinner the pharisee comes in and says oh god i thank you that you have not made me like the dogs and you've not made me like this publican i thank you that you've made me perfect wonderful i'm so thankful i'm not like this and i'm not like that and i'm not like this but it was the publican who knew he was nothing it was the pharisee who was deceit he deceived himself into thinking he was something when he was nothing he was standing there in self-deception and all of his pride and all of his criticism and all of his arrogancy he's standing there talking to god and saying god i thank you that i'm not like other men and i thank you that i'm not like this public and i thank you that i i'm not defiled like all these creatures defiled around me i thank you thank you thank you amen and it was all pride it was all arrogancy it was all puffed up vanity amen but the publican was getting down to business and being real with god and not even looking up but beating upon his chest and said god i'm a sinner save me i need your help he said that man went up to his house justified but not the pharisee i don't to me this is just me all the doctrine all the truth that has been restored is to bring us to the right life it is to so open the mind of god that we know god we know his nature his character it was displayed through us down through the characters in the bible it was displayed in jesus christ it was displayed again in the prophet of the end time it was it was it was written it was displayed the seals were open so that we could see what was god's great desire all along what is god like what does he desire what does he want what's been his objective amen and that word should not bring a pharisee attitude amen where all of a sudden i thank you god that i know the truth well i'm super thankful that i know the truth but if i know the truth and don't live the truth then i'm worse off than if i didn't know the truth i thank you that i understand the seals but you know you realize that if you say that statement that you know the message and you know the seals you've placed yourself in a place of responsibility where now there's no excuse there's no cloak for sin there's no covering there is no excuse amen because the you're saying i've seen the open word i've seen christ on full display i've seen the unveiling of god i know his nature i know his plan i know his desire and you have taken away any excuse you could possibly have to live a pharisee life jesus says because you say you see your sins remain and so there's there's no pride in that there's a there's a humility there's an embassing that comes and saying oh god how can i live what you want me to live this day without your help how could i ever be what you're calling for if it's not for your spirit if you don't wash me i can't do it if you don't help me i'll never make it this is such a difference in attitude in matthew chapter 6 verse 1 it says take heed that you do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men verily i say unto you they have their reward this to me is one of the this is one of the saddest statements that i read they they were going to make an offering supposedly to god but they sounded the trumpet the hypocrites did and they wanted glory of man they wanted the recognition so they sounded the trumpet they put their offering in and they received the praise of men the praise of god they pleased man they did not please god and jesus says and they have their reward meaning they already got what they wanted they're not getting anything else no eternal life no salvation no deliverance no change they have their reward he goes on verse 3 but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth that thine alms may be in secret and the father which seeth in secret shall reward the open name and when thou prayest thou shall not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogue and in the corners of the streets and they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into the closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to the father which is in secret and thy father which see it in secret shall reward thee openly the question is are we eligible for open rewards because of secret prayer let's go to verse 16. it says moreover when you fast be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou fast when thou fastest anoint thine head and wash thy face that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret and the father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly this is such a telling passage of scripture jesus is just exposing the heart of the pharisees that what they really want is they want acknowledgement they want praise they want to be seen and they want to be praised of men and so god is allowing them to have exactly what they want they're receiving their reward because it is the desire of their heart the desire of their heart is to be praised the desire their heart is to be seen the desire of their heart is to be my admired called rabbi given the chief seat so they have the reward god's not even taking it away from them they're receiving their reward but it's going to be a shock at the white throne judgment when they realize that in this life you already received your reward because you already were given the desire of your heart and you had it in this life there's no other reward for you because there was nothing else you desired you know and that's when you think about if we come if we come to the word with the wrong attitude and the wrong approach and we're raised up in a certain belief or we've come to it and and we've been becoming immersed in a certain culture in a certain social setting in a certain way amen and what we want is the acceptance if we want the social acceptance we want the admiration of those that we fellowship with then you may be getting your reward right now god god's not going to break it up and not not going to to because you've got the wrong desire he's not going to cast you away amen he didn't with the pharisees he tried to bring correction they rejected it he left him alone and let him get the reward but if the only desire of the heart is to be accepted among a group of people and have love and have society and have fellowship amen if that's the only desire of the heart then you can attain to that in this life you can have it i can have it but i say god i want something so much deeper than that i mean i want fellowship don't get me wrong i want camaraderie i want fellowship and i want love and i want that atmosphere those things are fine to want and desire and to enjoy amen but they have to be outcroppings amen they have to be additional blessings that's not the only reward that i want i want him amen that's my reward and the only reward that will satisfy is him amen not just not even just eternal life amen i want him what would eternal life be without christ i i want my reward is him amen my portion is him my desire is him and everything he gives outside of that is bonus blessings additional blessings and i love everyone and i will enjoy every blessing that he ever gives to me and be satisfied in it but i'll never be satisfied in it alone i can't just have the gifts i must have the giver amen i can't just have the blessings i have must have the one who gives out the blessings that's the desire of my heart i said god make that the desire of my only god can do this the only thing i can do is come to him and be honest amen i can't change myself i can't make myself what i'm not but what i can do is come to god and say god honestly honestly i realize i've been wanting acceptance from my brothers and sisters more than i wanted acceptance from you god forgive me forgive me and wash me and give me a pure heart it's not that you can change your selfie i mean you can go try all you want to change yourself it's not going to work it's not through effort it's not through discipline it's not it's not the only thing that the only thing that we can do under the preaching of the word when it peels back a layer and exposes something in us is just admit it to god amen bow our heads before him and say god i realize lord that i need a more fervent desire for you and i need a purer heart i can get away from the carnal things and into those things that really matter i don't want to only receive my reward in this life i don't want if the desire of my heart is only so deep my reward will only be so much and i don't want it to be only now but i want to be with christ for eternity i want to look at the life of saul for a minute and then go to the life of david and i want to show a corrupt heart versus a pure heart let's go to first samuel chapter 15. let me just look at these two characters just for a few moments so actually let's back up to 13. i'm going to start and read a passage out of 13. chapter 13 is just after saul becomes king of israel he's anointed he's declared king of israel jonathan then destroys the garrison of the philistines and all the philistine army comes up to destroy israel israel says there's there wasn't a man in israel that had a sword in his hand besides saul and jonathan they didn't have weapons the philistines had taken away all their smiths they had no weapons all they had was farm implements and tools they had no weapons they had no standing army they had nothing and the philistines were coming against them with thirty thousand chariots six thousand horsemen and and foot troops as the sand of the sea innumerable and saul is there with 600 men and only two swords you can see he's vastly outnumbered he's afraid and he's waiting and he's waiting for samuel to come to offer a sacrifice to the lord and while he's waiting the people are seeing the troops coming they're hearing the numbers and the people that were gathering this all start running away and hiding even a great number of them go across jordan to hide out so here's saul in this situation where he's a new king he's got 600 men with him two swords waiting for samuel the prophet to come now samuel's delaying is coming he's not coming at the appointed time amen the armies are coming the people are leaving and he's in us he's in a fix and and let's look at verse 8 first samuel 13 8 and he tarried seven days according to the set time that samuel had appointed but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him and saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings and he offered the burnt offerings he was supposed to wait for samuel but he didn't he made the offering himself and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offerings behold samuel came he was just a little bit too early you think god didn't time that just right and saul went out to meet him and he that he might salute him and samuel said what hast thou done and saul said because i saw that the people were scattered scattered from me and that thou comest not within the days appointed and that the philistines gathered themselves together and mitch mash therefore said i the philistines will come down now upon me to gilgal and i have not made supplication unto the lord i forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering and samuel said to saul thou has done foolishly thou has not kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee for now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel forever but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord has sought him a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the lord commanded thee so there's already a prophecy going out that god is going to take the kingdom from saul and give it to another man and that man is going to be a man we know after god's own heart but you can see saul i want to start seeing saul's attitude we've talked about this before but it's so interesting that when he sees the enemy coming he sees the people scattering they're starting to leave because the people still had confidence in samuel they wanted samuel to come if samuel stood by him amen the people would have confidence in saul amen and they had faith in the offering so now because samuel's delaying he rushes and he makes the offering himself and what's he trying to do he's trying to get god's favor he's trying to keep the people together he's trying to save himself he's trying to save himself and he's going against the commandment of god to do so see i think whenever we begin to move into this realm of self-preservation that we begin to manifest what's really deep in the heart because if we completely trusted in god we would completely trust in god if saul had confidence in god in the word that came through samuel he would have just stayed put and waited because he had confidence in god amen but his his his moving forward against the commandment of god he was trying to preserve his troops he was trying to preserve face he was trying to maybe build morale i don't know although he's trying to do but he was trying to save himself he was trying to preserve the situation and in doing so he ended up losing the kingdom because god doesn't need you to save yourself he needs you to love him and trust him he needs you to love him more than anything else he needs you to love him more than you love your flesh to say god i'm standing behind your word if it kills me it kills me but this is your word so now we begin to see the attitude in the approach of song let's look at first samuel 15 now chapter 15 that is verse 20. in verse 15 samuel brings the word of the lord to send saul to destroy the amalekites we've talked about this story before he's just utterly destroyed utterly every suckling every child every man every woman every beast everything was to be destroyed but he didn't destroy it all he saved back the choices of the livestock and he saved agag king and samuel now comes to him and he says here in verse 20 and saul said unto samuel yeah i have obeyed the voice of the lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and i brought ag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the lord thy god in gilgal i think it's amazing to me the human nature i love the bible the way the bible is written because it's too perfect because it's human nature because if we can give a religious justification from doing what we do we always feel safe behind the religious justification is that right think about standing in the gap and the prophet of god wanted to go up to near alaska up to bc wanted to be a trapper stomp out he started using the bible as justification you know like prophets of old they didn't mingle with the people they stayed out in the wilderness to themselves god gave him a message they would stomp out and deliver it and stomp him back he's using religious justification and eventually he admits i was just wanting to do that for myself so that i could hunt and fish aren't you glad we had an honest prophet in this day and so here saul before when he offers without waiting on samuel he says i forced myself i really didn't want to do it but i forced myself because i was they were going to come upon me and i didn't have the favor of god how can you have the favor of god by disobeying god how can you force yourself to disobey god to obtain the favor of god it shows that saul had a different motive altogether and now when he saves back the choices he says no the people did that the people did that so that they could make a sacrifice to the lord isn't that a good thing no a good thing is to do what god says that's a good thing amen to deviate from that is wicked his evil is his antichrist amen the good thing is to do exactly what god said in his word to do that's why he wants listen this this has been the dilemma with god amen for thousands of years what has god wanted he has always wanted somebody that will just do what he says no more no less just obey his word and love him with all of their heart that's what god has wanted all this time so now he goes on let's keep reading but the people took verse 21 now verse 22 and samuel said hath the lord as great delight and burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the lord he hath also rejected thee from being king and saul said unto samuel i have sinned now he's willing to repent amazing before it wasn't his fault it was the people actually before that he says i did everything god told me to do so he wasn't he wasn't repentant he wasn't you know he didn't see himself as a sinner he i did everything god said to do he says then what is this what is this lowing of cattle and bleeding of sheep what is this that i hear and he begins to say well the people did this and the people wanted to save this for this worship and he says you have rejected the word you're rejected from being king and after that now he's willing to admit that he sinned why didn't he do it the first time why didn't he repent immediately he was only repenting and you can see in his repentance it's a false repentance all he wants is to remain in his position as king and to save face in front of the people it has nothing to do with a genuine love for god you say can repentance be false yes repentance can be absolutely false if it's done with the wrong motive repentance is false he says verse 24 and saul said in samuel i have sinned for i have transgressed the commandment of the lord and thy words because i feared the people and obeyed their voice it's still the people's fault ultimately verse 25 now therefore i pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me and i may worship the lord and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee for thou has rejected the word of the lord and the lord hath rejected thee from being king over israel and as samuel turned about to go away he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle and rent and it rent and samuel said unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbor of thine that is better than thou and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent for he is not a man that he should repent then he said i have sinned this is saul now i have sinned yet honor me now listen yet honor me now i pray thee before the elders of my people and before israel and turn again with me that i may worship the lord thy god so samuel turned again after saul and saul worshiped the lord this is completely disgenuine 100 he said honor me now before the elders of my people saul is trying to save his reputation and he's trying to save his position amen he says come with me now so that i might worship the lord if he wanted to worship the lord he would have done what the lord said because that's the purest form of worship the purest form of worship is not money and offering play or attendance and a service amen are speaking a certain thing the purest form of worship is to do what he says do to obey his commandments jesus said if you love me keep my commandments worship means to bow down to surrender so i said the purest form of worship is to obey to surrender but saul you can see had a reputation to maintain he had an image to uphold and he had a position to guard and therefore his repentance was not genuine because of what he was trying to save the prophet says that's the prayer of sincerity certainly he could put them together it's not how we pray in our lips it's the motive of our heart is what god hears i love that it's not how we pray in our lips it's the motive of our heart is what god hears it can sound so good it can sound so repentant it can sound so religious but god is hearing what the motive of our heart is saying we have good words in our lips but a wrong desire in the heart god hears what the heart is saying you know i want to look at david now let's go to ii samuel i want to look just one instance in the life of david there'd be many we could look at but let's just go to second samuel chapter 12. we know this instant so well this is when he sinned with bathsheba and committing adultery and then had uriah killed her husband was killed and in chapter 12 verse 5 nathan comes to him in chapter 12 and begins to tell him a story about a rich man and a poor man the rich man had a multiple sheep on the hill poor man only had one that he loved and raised as a child and when a visitor came to the rich man he didn't want to give up any of his sheep so he took from the poor man his one little sheep and he slew it and fed it to the visitor and nathan the prophet shares this story with david and after david hears the story this is his answer in verse 5. and david's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to nathan as the lord liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely die and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity and nathan said to david thou art the man thus saith the lord god of israel i anointed thee king over israel and i and i delivered thee out of the hand of saul and i gave thee thy master's house and thy master's wives unto thy bosom and gave thee the house of israel and of judah and if that would have been too little i would moreover have given thee such and such things wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the lord to do evil in this sight thou has killed uriah the hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of ammon now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou has despised me and has taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife thus saith the lord behold i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and i will take thy wise before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of the sun for thou didst it secretly but i will do this thing before all israel and before the son and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord. he didn't say anything about the people he didn't blame bathsheba he didn't talk about preserving his kingdom saving faces not to elders he simply said i have sinned against the lord he didn't say i'm wrong nathan forgive me but purge my sin nathan couldn't purge sin he didn't say but the people but do you know how much pressure i'm under do you know the situation god doesn't know what just let's just keep this quiet still show me honor in front of the people none of that david simply said i have sinned against the lord who was it david cared most about and all things it was the lord who did he ultimately sin against he sinned against bathsheba he sinned against uriah he sinned against his own people but when it came down to it the one that mattered most was david said i have sinned against the lord. and nathan said unto david thy lord has also put away thy sin thou shalt not die you know when nathan came to him he began to tell him all the trouble that was going to come in his household and the things that were going to happen to him and david never repented and asked for those things to go away all he did was repent and when he repented nathan said god has forgiven you you'll not die but he didn't say anything about all the other consequences for his sin that was coming into his family david was willing to accept the hand of god because god's hand is perfect he wasn't complaining he wasn't begging he wasn't whining he accepted what god said but he repented and god spared his life in first john 1 9 says if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness but we must confess our sins and we must confess him with a pure heart not god i did that but you know what pressure i was under god i did that but you know this and you know this i did that but you know what they did to me how about just simply saying god i was wrong and i sinned against you would you please forgive me the repentance shows who we love most the way we repent shows who is our desire and who we want to please praise god i want you to look at david now i want to keep going in verse 14 excuse me verse 14. i want to read this because it has so it has had so much impact on me verse 14 how be it because by this deed thou has given great occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die and nathan reported unto his house departed unto his house and the lord struck the child that uriah's wife bear unto david and it was very sick david therefore besought god for the child and david fasted and went in and lay all night upon the earth and the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the earth but he would not he would not neither did he eat bread with them and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then vex himself if we tell him that the child is dead but when david saw that his servants whispered david perceived that the child was dead therefore david said unto his servants is the child dead and they said he is dead then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the lord and worshiped then he came to his own house and when he required they set bread before him and he did eat then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou has done thou didst fast and weak for the child while he was alive but when the child was dead thou did rise and eat bread and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept for i said who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that the child may live but now he is dead wherefore shall i fast can i bring him back again i shall go to him but he shall not return to me david he repented unto the lord but he had such a relationship with the lord that when the child was stritten sick david didn't blame god david didn't get angry towards god or didn't get bitter towards god what david did is began to fast and pray and rely on the goodness and graciousness of god and ask god if there was any chance he would spare the child and he laid himself out humbly and he laid upon the floor and he humbled himself and he fasted and he prayed he says while the child was alive who knew but that god might show grace but now that he's dead there's nothing more than i can do i can't he can't come to me but i shall go to him david is in no way bitter towards god blaming god upset at god david knows this is his fault god is righteous in everything he does and doesn't hold god accountable you'd be surprised we wouldn't be surprised because we're all human beings the surprise is the number of times amen that we fail god amen and disaster strikes in our life and then we become bitter towards god because distraction disaster hit our life all of a sudden things become difficult there's family tensions there's all kinds of disasters going on all around us and it's because we chose to go a different way than the word and going a different way in the word has brought these results and now we become bitter towards god to the results and start demanding that god change them instead of saying god is good god is gracious god is loving and everything he does is right and i'm going to implore his graciousness and ask him but i'm not going to be bitter towards him i'm not going to blame him it's not god's fault david was a man who loved god and respected god he was a man after god's own heart he was not a man after failure this is a tremendous failure this is adultery and murder this is a huge failure but even in this huge failure he still was a man after god's own heart and the way that he respected and reverenced god and honored god above everything else and david wasn't saving his reputation david wasn't saving his kingdom david wasn't trying to save his household david was loving god respecting god and asking god to be gracious and when god took the child there was no bitterness there was no anger there was no resentment there was just a resolve that god is god and god is good and we love god let's turn to psalms 51. this is the psalm that david wrote and it says here at the beginning of the psalm in my bible psalm 51 it said to the chief musician a psalm of david when nathan the prophet came unto him after he had gone into bathsheba so this is the psalm he wrote after this happened he said have mercy upon me o god according to thy lovingkindness according unto the multitude of the tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin david knows he can't cleanse himself but he's coming back to the one he loves to the very one he offended he's coming back to the one he loves and he's asking that one to forgive him and to cleanse him for i acknowledge my transgressions my sin is ever before me against thee and the only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest behold i was shapen in iniquity and in my incendian my mother conceive me behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to no wisdom purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities create in me a clean heart oh god and renew a right spirit within me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and hold me with thy free spirit when will i teach then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee deliver me from blood guiltiness o god thou god of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness o lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise for thou desirous not sacrifice else would i give it thou the lightest knot and burn offering the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart oh god thou thou will not despise i love that psalm i love david was a man after god's own heart i loved his attitude in the way he repented and the the desire of his heart was god amen the desire that he wanted restored was fellowship with god he wanted god to restore him and restore the joy of his salvation he knew he didn't lose his salvation but he lost the joy of his salvation by his own transgressions he wasn't blaming god but he was asking god to restore what he himself had lost he was asking god to cleanse what he himself had defiled he was coming back to the one he loved and the one that he had sinned against admitting his transgressions and asking that individual to wash him and clean him make him pure and he said if you desire to sacrifice i would give a sacrifice but there's nothing that i can give to pay for my sins there's nothing that would suffice you amen but the one thing you want is a broken and contrite heart and a broken spirit and that's what david had because david's motive of his heart was to serve god and it became evident in the way that he wrote this psalm remember cain cain served himself cain wanted to serve god but he served god his way abel served god the way god wanted to be served and we know how all of this transpired and eventually god rebukes cain and cain doesn't take the rebuke of god amen cain gets upset he speaks to his brother he raises and he slays abel when god comes to cain he comes to cain and says where is thy brother and he says am i my brother's keeper and he says what hast thou done the blood of thy brother crieth out to me from the ground and and cain is defiant in the face of god and god brings a judgment upon cain amen and cast him out of his presence and cain doesn't humble himself he doesn't repent he said i sinned against you lord i'm sorry there's no repentance all there is is a desire for self-preservation because he says if you send me out whoever shall find me will slay me and god said i'll put a seal upon you that whoever slays cain it happened to him sevenfold cain was content leaving the presence of the lord as long as he could keep his life he he didn't want favor with god he didn't want to please or serve god he wanted to keep his life and he wanted to continue to live upon the earth amen and it's completely backwards amen because what is life without god amen who wants to live without the presence of the lord but cain was totally content going out from the presence of god as long as god would put a mark of protection on he could keep his life i say my life is less value to me than than my relationship with the lord god make that so in me make it so that my life my pleasures my health my everything is not as valuable to me as my relationship with you so that when i displease you from a pure heart that i am brokenhearted and contrite in spirit because i sinned against you not because somebody found out not because it's causing problems not because people are judging me that's all completely the wrong reason for repentance but when it comes back to god i have sinned it's you and thee alone that i have sinned against i have sinned against you lord and i am sorry for transgressing against you that is a true heart of repentance amen and then david can say in psalms 119 71 he can say it is good for me that i have been afflicted that i might learn thy statutes never bitter never angry never blaming god but with a pure heart towards god the prophet of god says now while you're trying to impersonate that if you are you're still a crow he's talking about this being a dove and a crow the nature of a crow the nature of a dove the dove is pure and clean can only eat clean food and can only go clean places the crow can eat wherever he says you've got to get your nature changed to make your desires change then when you truly love god and believe him with all your heart that's it when you do anything wrong you feel the tears of repentance rolling down your cheeks you can't stand it you have to go back you lay on your face before the father said god you know i didn't mean to do that and you stay right there until it settled with god forever that's right he said when you've got that nature changed then when you've done something against god you feel the tears of repentance running down your cheeks and you stay in the presence of god until you know that things settled you don't wait till somebody finds out and brings it to your attention and exposes it and then you repent but when your nature's changed the minute you know you've defied god's word the minute you know you've displeased god you feel that displeasure that separation and it throws you into repentance this is serving god with a pure heart with a pure motive it says but an old crow it don't bother him he can just eat anything he wants to he can digest it but the dove cannot digest these things then notice and go back to the lamb now he's so meek and he's so gentle in the day that when that lamb comes into the earth he's born meek and gentle he's a lamb to begin with and when a christian is born into the kingdom he takes the nature of the lamb he goes on in the message here you him he says i don't know i just feel like i was just all scoured out that's something that the word does it just scours through us and finds those little old weak spots we confess them the church moves on the church must move on live gallant be faithful at your post of duty love the lord with all your heart and god will give you the desire of your heart let's turn to matthew 22. we'll wrap up with this thought matthew 22. matthew 22 34. matthew 22 but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence they were gathered together when one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him saying master which is the great commandment in the law jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets so there's anything we want to get right i want to get this right and i need god's help in the message hidden life the prophet is talking about the baptism of the holy ghost he's talking about the inner veil in the hidden life he says sure they eat manna out there but they didn't know about this they'd never been in there have you my dear brother don't despise my ignorance but i want to ask you something have you ever come to the place in life where christ meant more to you than all the arguing you could do about your church has christ meant more to you than all the world i don't mean from an emotional or a mental workup i mean from the depths of your heart that something's settled in there that something's taken place that you don't know how it come but you're hid away and your whole motive is to serve jesus christ have you entered that place my dear brother have you come into that place where you don't care what anyone says not to go out and act smart but till the love of god is so anchored into you that you can't see nothing else your whole motive is to do the will of god love for everybody flowing free from everywhere what a place to live that's the hidden place that's the place where we can get to come to my brethren that's the place where god reveals his secret things that's the place where god does the placing and the calling what does it mean to come behind the inner veil what does it mean to come into the holy of holies amen to come into that place where he said your whole motive is to do the will of god and love everybody to where there's a change that takes place when it's no longer defending myself providing for myself trying to look good all of that needs to fade to the to the to the outside but we need to come down to this genuine love for god that says i love god period i love god first i love god most i love god with all of my heart with all my soul with all my strength with all my mind that's the greatest of commandments and that's the life he's called his bride to live in christ is the mystery god revealed he says now there is only one thing can happen there has to be a message at the end time when there's nothing else can follow it and now the ecumenical world has set up such a regime that there can be no denomination and no not nothing else follow it you're either in it or you're not in it the fruit is in the top of the tree and the light is shining on that predestinated fruit and she's ripening into christ-like fruit bringing forth the same mellowness and sweetness the same spirit that he had in him what is his word doing what is this bright light that's shining at the end of the time it's shining on the top of the tree the bride tree the restoration of the bride tree to bring forth the same fruit that was in him the same melaness the same sweetness the same surrender the same obedience the same life that jesus christ had that's what this word is to do jeremiah 31 i'm just going to quote it to you i'll read it through jeremiah 31 verse 33 says but this shall be my covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people we've come to that time where not that you take your law and not that you take your word and write it in my mind this this message didn't come just to enlighten the mind although that's part of what takes place but this message came so that he could write his word in your inward parts amen this message has come to be written in my inward parts amen to be written on my heart amen it's come to bring an absolute complete change to me not that i can it's not for the outside show there'll be an outside so that's where the fruits are manifested but he came to correct what was wrong inside of me he came to fix what hybridization had done to me he came to put in me amen he came to give me his word to write it in my inward parts to write it on my heart to live his life in me to come and dwell in me to bear the fruit out of me he came with sanctifying power he came with the power of the blood he came with the washing of the water of the word that'll clean my heart clean my hands clean my mind but i've got to stay under the fountain till it purges me and i can die to myself and ask god god purge me by your word cleanse me by this word put your word into my heart write it in my inward parts put it in the depths of my soul amen so that i would not sin against you that you'll clean my heart o god purge me clean me wash me by this great word that you've sent pour your spirit out upon me and change my heart oh god so that all i want is you that's why this message came this is what this message can do that's the purpose that it's here for amen not for intellectualism not for greater doctrine not to create another religious society not to create another religious culture not to create another system of operation that'll clean up the outside but we walk around with just as polluted and dirty in our hearts as any other denomination that's not why the message came the message came so that he could purify sanctify cleanse thoroughly and dwell in completely [Music] say god write this message in my inward parts if the message gets written in my inward parts and the message gets written in my heart everything else will come out right but lord cleanse me he says in christ is revealed in his own word the thing that's mattered with the message today is those who has obtained it in their hearts must lay in the presence of the what's the problem too much immaturity too much greenness but those who received in their hearts must lay in the presence of this revelation of this word of this restored word lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened you can pick up the message and then let that sun bake all the greenness out of you see making matured christians see what i mean god is coming soon to receive his church and we must have that type of christians for him to receive amen write your word in my heart then when we receive the message into the heart we must lay under this revelation under the presence of the son of god and let it bake all the greenness out and bring us to full harvest maturity because it must display the very life of jesus christ it must be right from the inside out amen and if we have a message that makes the outside right and the inside wrong it's not the right message but it must be the one from god that is written in the inward part written in the heart and it has the power to bring a change and what we need to do is when when we're laying in the presence of the sun to bring ripeness to bake out greenness which is immaturity amen when we lay in the presence of the sun when we come across these things we need to say god i'm sorry for this take it out of my life lord i'm sorry for this attitude for this approach i've been bitter towards you i've been blaming you i've been i've been hiding my sin i've been whatever but as we come to these things we need to deal with them amen not stuff them and move on amen not act like they're not there but if we want really to come to maturity we've got to come and expose our sin not hide our sin we've got to expose our weaknesses we've got to expose those little places in us where we're still trying to save ourselves when we're still trying to figure things out where we're still trying to look good in the eyes of people we've got to die out to all of that and say god wash me from those things and make me pure in my heart i want to be right all the way through i want to be right do i want to do right things absolutely do i want to bear right fruit absolutely but more than anything if he could purge my heart and purify me by his word and by his life i know that everything is going to come out right i desire so much like david said purge me and i will be clean cleanse my heart oh god and make me clean because without god we're never going to make it but oh what a powerful scrubbing agent of the pure word he has given us in this day a pure word where the mind of god has been open and revealed so that all these little things can't stay hidden they have to be exposed the light of the word has to shine on them and bring out of us and pull out of us all of those things that are hindering us to be like him until we get to the place where it's our love for him alone that if we stand like saul and nobody shows up to save us i'm not going to go against the word i'll stand here and die till we can get to the place where it's his word and our confidence in his word and we obey it out of love that i'm not going to change it i'm not going to manipulate it i'm not going to ignore it but i'm going to stand here and whatever happens i trust god with the outcome but i'm not going to disobey his word because i'm tired of disappointing my lord i'm tired of failing my god that's a pure motive failing other people will do it a million times but god keep me from failing you keep me from sinning against you i may hurt people's feelings i i they may misunderstand my actions i i those things are going to happen and where we're sorry for all of those but oh god above all help me not to sin against you let me have such a love affair with god such a sensitivity that i i'll know when i displease him and i'll feel those tears of repentance coming and saying oh god wash me once again forgive me restore unto me the joy of my salvation and my lips will sing your praises that's the way we want to live he's not coming for a church he's coming for a bride [Music] he's not coming for a religious order he's coming for a mate he's come here to unite not with a system of beliefs not with a doctrinal order but he's come here to unite with people he's come here to unite with his bride and he wants that loving relationship and i say that's what i want and i know it's what you want and it's got to be as planned for us in this day that we live let's all stand now musicians if you'll come and brother ben as well sorry i went a little longer than i intended to but god knows my heart how disappointing it would be to come to the white throne judgment as there will be many he said lord lord in thy name have we not cast out demons and in thy name healed the second and thy name done many mighty works and they'll say depart from me ye that work iniquity i never knew you lord god never let me be one of them i don't believe i am because the desire have in my heart but oh god purged me cleanse me make me clean man let's bow our heads and pray oh lord jesus we thank you lord god without you we're nothing lord without your help lord we're not able to help ourselves but oh in your mercy lord you gave us of yourself you gave us your word you gave us yourself your strength your life and god we just ask that you would purge us lord now move away lord all of those false desires move away all of those desires to please man and to be seen of man all the things the pharisees suffered with move them away from us lord and god purge us and wash us by your water give us of your spirit god heal us cleanse us write your word in our inward parts write your word and scribe it deep upon our heart that we become one with you and that your word you your life your person becomes everything to us god i love you sweep over us now and wash away lord all that's not like you all of that wrong nature and wrong desire lord we just ask that you would just purge it and wash it away as we surrender to your word help us god to love you most to surrender to you above all things god we love you we thank you father we ask that you would do the work in us that we can't do ourselves but we're trusting that this is the hour that this is the time that you want to unite yourself with the people and you've called us to be that people help us god to surrender our whole heart and to love you lord with all of our hearts with all of our souls with all of our might our strength our bodies our minds with everything we give it to you and we love you in jesus christ's name we pray amen and god bless you i love you all brother ben [Music] created me [Music] and within me me [Music] within me [Music] oh and take not thy holy spirit from me [Music] the joy [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] within me oh
