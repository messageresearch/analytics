[0:00] the key to redemption
[0:03] the key to the expression of god laid in
[0:06] the woman
[0:08] the woman was the key that unlocked the
[0:11] mystery of redemption
[0:12] she was the key that unlocked the
[0:15] attributes of god being on display
[0:17] because without the fall you don't know
[0:20] a savior you don't know a healer you
[0:22] don't know a deliverer
[0:23] there's so much of god that cannot be
[0:25] expressed so the key to the full
[0:27] expression of god
[0:28] was the woman she was fashioned
[0:32] because the because the the the the
[0:34] redemption
[0:35] the sealing and unsealing of the book
[0:37] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[0:39] the world
[0:40] god as a savior god is a healer god is a
[0:42] deliverer it was
[0:44] all locked up and bound up
[0:48] is that true it was all locked up
[0:51] and bound up in order for that to be
[0:54] expressed there had to be a fall
[0:56] but god cannot make anything fallen
[1:01] he can't make it corrupted
[1:04] he can't make it fallen he can only make
[1:07] it
[1:07] with the ability to be corrupted but he
[1:10] can't
[1:11] make it corrupted
[1:15] so he made a byproduct
[1:18] not because he hated woman but she was
[1:21] going to become the tool in his hand
[1:24] and that weaker vessel would become the
[1:26] tool in god's hand
[1:28] that would unlock the mystery of
[1:30] redemption
[1:33] that's why god is going to take the very
[1:37] same tool to finish the mystery of
[1:40] redemption
[1:41] amen he had to have the weaker vessel
[1:44] the weaker vessel is attached to
[1:46] redemption amen
[1:47] so the serpent came to her the devil
[1:50] through the serpent
[1:50] and and to deceive amen so that she
[1:53] could
[1:54] unlock amen all the attributes that were
[1:57] in god
[1:58] and now god could step on the scene he
[2:00] could be a heavenly father
[2:01] he could be a redeemer he could be a
[2:03] healer he could be a deliverer he could
[2:05] be a comforter he could be
[2:07] all that he ever intended to be because
[2:10] of the weaker vessel
[2:14] but because god fashioned her so and god
[2:16] foreordained for
[2:18] new and for knowledge knew it would be
[2:19] this way he also chose the very
[2:22] same vessel to continue the work of
[2:24] redemption
[2:25] all the way down to the finished mark
[2:27] it's the weaker vessel that he's going
[2:29] to use
[2:30] the weaker vessel is attached to
[2:32] redemption
[2:35] hallelujah now husbands dwell with wives
[2:37] according to knowledge
[2:38] giving honor unto the weaker vessel
[2:42] because this is the vessel god is using
[2:44] for redemption
