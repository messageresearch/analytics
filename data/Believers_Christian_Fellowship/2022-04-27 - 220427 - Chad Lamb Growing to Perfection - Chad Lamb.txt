let's take our bibles and turn to second peter chapter one we're going to read through a very familiar portion of scripture here in the book of second peter chapter one we'll just read the first four verses of chapter one and then let you have your seats so begin in verse one simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us the exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust amen god bless you as you take your seats may god bless us as we look at his word amen i want to take a look at the subject of growing into perfection and i really want to look at the statue of a perfect man and just go through a few things in that this evening before that i'd like to make an announcement um i've been working on trying to get brother abraham moses myra over for a visit and it looks like he'll be able to make it we don't have a confirmation for sure he went to the embassy this week and they signaled to him that he would get a visa so that he could come but he won't know for sure i think until may 6 when he goes to pick up his visa for his passport so we're just going to go ahead and move forward with faith that the brother will be coming so i've scheduled special meetings for may 20th 21st and 22nd that's a friday saturday and sunday so our services with brother abraham friday night saturday night and then sunday morning so i'm very much looking forward to that so if you could just be in prayer that everything will go through with this visa and we can we have to start making travel arrangements already so we'll start making those travel arrangements and ask god to take care of all of it amen so i'm very much looking forward to having our brother back again and very much looking forward to services with brother abraham also i've scheduled a kids service we haven't had a kids service since the break out of the pandemic so march 15th this march 15th here in about three weeks i think it is we'll have a kids service here in the sanctuary in the afternoon sunday afternoon at 4 pm so praise god we're looking forward to that and so all the sunday school-aged kids 12 and older the sanctuary is yours this service is for you amen you get the first four rows on either side and your parents are welcome to come too but they got to sit a little further back other family members can come too but they can still further back so we'll have a kids service on uh i'm sorry i said march may 15th sorry you guys have to love me because god said you had to and you have to forgive me even 49 times whatever times or how many times bunch of times anyways may 15th so may 15th here in about three weeks we'll have a kids service so i'm looking forward to that we haven't done that in a while and we've got a lot of young children that have never been in the kids service so praise god we're looking forward to that also i wanted to just share a testimony real quick i came sunday and i preached this service on uh our guide and we were just talking about the message a guide and god had laid that on my heart really heavy and i just knew traveling home like i said i knew what to preach and i preached it and it was wonderful we had a good time on sunday and then monday i decided to listen to brother ben's service so i listened to brother ben's service monday and then tuesday i listened to brother kyle's service and i thought well praise god amen god is good and so i was talking to kyle yesterday and i i told him i called him after i listened to a service i said hey i just finished your service he said you just watched it i said yeah he says i was sure you watched it before and i said no and so it was just astounding it was astounding to me that the theme that god had these brothers in that he had brother been in and he had brother caroline i haven't yet watched brother knowles service yet but after those two services i was it was just jaw-dropping and i just wanted to mention it because these things happen all the time and i don't want to miss what god is doing when he works so supernatural like that when there's no communication i didn't know what they preached i didn't hear the services and when you see god drop into the same channel the same exact direction the same channel then i think our our ears should be tuned in like never before we should finally tune them in and concentrate and say god is speaking to us in a supernatural way and i want to hear what he has to say so i was very blessed by that and i and when i got done watching the services i said thank god i didn't watch those before it ruined sunday amen so it was a tremendous testimony we know that god does that we've seen him do it many times but i just wanted to point that out because i want to appreciate god for what he does i want to say thank you and when he does it in such a way like that we all know that it has nothing to do with a human being no human being can do that this is not about the men this is not about the gifts uh in the in the human being this is about god who knows what he wants to say and how to say it he can give inspiration and give direction and and i just i'm thrilled i'm so thankful to god for that and we want that every service amen so let's come with expectation and look to god to feed his sheep amen now if we look into this subject god laid this on my heart it's not unfamiliar this is something that we've been through many times it's very familiar to all of us who know the message but god laid it on my heart to go through again and we always have people coming up and new ones coming in and we just want to understand what god has for us and really we want to understand our life amen and the journey we're on and what god is doing with each one of us and so let's go back here to second peter chapter one again second peter chapter one verse four let's begin in verse four it says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge into knowledge temperance and to temperance patience into patience godliness and degalling this brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things as blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ so we know that these uh we we typically call these the seven virtues that we're going through here in second peter and he says add to your faith uh virtue and to virtue knowledge under knowledge temperance unto temperance patience and the patience godliness god in his brother the kindness and the brother the kindness charity or love charity is the word agape it's love and we know that this is the divine nature so god's allowed us to be partakers of the divine nature which is the very nature of god which was the nature that was in christ and these are the seven virtues of that and so brother branham is going to go through this here in the messy stature of a perfect man and i'm going to be quoting quite a bit from statue of a perfect man and blasphemous names and he says now in building the virtue building this monument building this stature see it starts off with the foundation stone faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness now what does it do then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for god is love so what is the headstone of all of this it's god what is charity god it's love and god is love so the capping off of this uh of of this stature of a perfect man is god amen so it's important to know we'll come back to them and he controls and he is the strength of every one of these things all the virtues that's right yes sir right in here right in here you see i got in between all these works in here and there these little waves come what is that the holy ghost coming down through christ the holy spirit the holy spirit is above all this welding this together building a what a perfect church for the capstone to cap it off what is it what is been done again it's manifested through seven church ages and seven church messengers started back here where was the church first founded there was the pentecostal church first founded by saint paul at ephesus the star of the ephesian church age ephesus the second church was smyrna virtue irenaeus the great man who held up the gospel of paul the next church age was pergamus who was martin martin was the great man who stayed paul irenaeus martin then in thyatira came columba you remember here it is drawn out right here columba after columba the dark ages come in there then comes sardis which means dead luther hallelujah what then what come next after sardis luther then come philadelphia godliness wesley holiness the just shall live by faith said luther sanctification through wesley then came in brotherly kindness through the laodicea and we believe the great message of the second appearing of elijah and the last day shall sweep the land here you are seven church ages seven steps god building his church is like one person into an individual into himself so now this is showing how god through seven church ages has been building his church and he's been building them through the through the seven church ages using the the seven church age messengers to bring the light of each age and he's been building them up and he types them with the virtues faith virtue knowledge temperance all of these things but he says he's building them like one person so the way he builds his church is the way he builds his individual so when we see what god has done through seven church ages we recognize that's the way he's building the individual as well and he's building the church amen god is building his church like one individual because the church altogether is his bride so it's like he's building an individual unit into himself so what is he building this church into and to himself she is going to be a reflection of him amen she's going to be in his very image when he's done with this great picture and then he goes on to say the glory the power of god coming down through this welding it together therefore the pentecostal people that let out the lutheran let out the wesleyans and things doesn't know what they're talking about what he means by let out is saying they're not included in this because they didn't believe all of this and he says they don't even know what they're talking about amen he says you see they lived in this part of the temple that's the way some people can come up that high and drop off but there's a genuine part of that that keeps making that building come on i will restore saith the lord you remember the bride tree you remember the sermon on the bride tree they eat it down but he pruned him they got denominational branches he pruned them off they raised up another church denominational branches he pruned it off but the heart of that tree kept growing and in the evening time it shall be light that's when come christ the holy spirit jesus comes down and sets himself at the head of the church then and he will resurrect this church being his own body in there is the body and the way god is expecting us is individual to grow the way he has brought his church in to grow every church age it becomes one big church amen so brother frank if we can bring up the overhead i'm going to draw this out on the whiteboard and and i want to spend a little time looking at this and i'll work on that let's go to romans chapter 8. romans chapter 8 and we'll read verse 14. for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of god now keep this scripture in your mind we're going to come back to this but first i'm going to draw this little picture here so when brother branham be a couple weeks before he comes to this sermon he he says that he he's going to preach well after he preaches this sermon he looks back at this sermon when he comes to the end of 1962 and into 1963 and calls this his pyramid message so brother ram titles this is pyramid message and when he he's he's a week out before this service and before this service he says next sunday he goes i want to preach on the capping of the pyramid so when he preaches the stature of a perfect man he's preaching on the capping of the pyramid that's what he says beforehand so it's very interesting when you get to look at this he's preaching on the capping of the period which we know the capstone is christ the capstone is god the capstone is love amen and and so then he's going to talk about when he looks back he calls us his pyramid message amen and when what's amazing about that is he's preaching all of this before he knows about junior jackson's dream of the pyramid amen he preaches all of this this is going to be uh the the capping of the pyramid message he preaches that before he has the vision of the constellation of angels in a pyramid form because that comes later so it's amazing to me that god is so directing brother branham to bring this message at this time so we could understand how he's been building a bride because he's coming to the capping time to cap it off with himself amen with love and so that the church would understand what's been happening through the church ages and what's been going on so we know that he builds this through seven church ages i think that's seven one two three four five six seven good so we have seven ages and we have seven virtues and then the capping is the eighth which is love just called charity same word which is god or christ himself and that will complete this this picture of a perfect church so there well i'm going to read this quote and then there's something else i want to get into okay blasphemous names 1962 is now when when jesus had been obedient jesus to god god placed him positionally this is him now when the member is born by the holy ghost and to the family of god and has proven that these virtues are in him that god can see virtue knowledge temperance patience brotherly kindness and godliness in him then god seals him or places him and there that's when you see the sons and daughters of god so brother branham when he's preaching on statue of a perfect man and blasphemous names he uses some language that's confusing and it's calls quite a bit of confusion and there's and there's different teachings on the statue of a perfect man and i just want to go into that and just share with you what i see and the way i see it in the message amen and knowing that god is still perfecting our understanding so the way we see it can be tweaked amen we can understand it better by and by but because brother bannon begins to talk about this building of the statue of a perfect man and as you add to faith to virtue and build your way up amen and then finally god caps it with the holy ghost and seals it with the holy ghost and you're sealed into the kingdom and because brother branham's using this terminology amen from and he uses it mainly in 1962 for the most part when he's preaching these messages because he uses this terminology amen people start separating being born again and baptized with the holy ghost and so they they begin to teach because brother ben says comments like this in this message he says you know you're born again and then you grow up and then you're sealed by the holy ghost after all these virtues are in you and so because he says that amen there's some that that see that and teach that you're born again at the bottom then you grow all the way up and then you're sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost amen but that's not the way i see it i don't believe it that way but i see why people say that because of the things brother ben i'm saying so i hope as we go on today that we can clear this up and paint the picture in a way in the way that i see it and i'll read this quote again because this quote says god can see virtue knowledge temperance patience brotherly kindness and godliness in him then god seals him or places him and really brother branham you know back in 1960 he preaches on adoption and when he comes the statue of a perfect man in blasphemies names he's actually preaching adoption again he's showing this is bringing us into adoption this is adoption which is a placing of a son and so he says now god seals him or places him so you can see the terminologies god brother is using by sealing he's also typing it with placing but the first sentence i read in this he says now when jesus had been obedient jesus to god god placed him positionally this is him well jesus was already a son amen jesus was a son and god saw that he would have been obedient and god was positionally placing him so when brother brahm's talking about this capping off her ceiling it's it's it's in reference to adoption and reference to a placing or positioning a son amen that's what brother branham did to the age that's why he started preaching on the statue of a perfect man he's showing there's been seven church ages but at the end of the seven church ages there's a capping off and the capping off is when christ himself comes to unite with the body and what's he doing is he's positionally placing the bride he's saying you're not down here and you're not down here you're not down here but you're come all the way up to adoption and now amen he's showing that the bride is moving into adoption amen where she amen is so like the father she's so like him that christ and and her unite together and now she can speak for him amen so let's look at this scripture again in romans chapter 8. and let's look at verse 15 for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have to receive the spirit of adoption whereby you cry abba father so you received the spirit and it was the spirit of adoption amen adoption brother brahm teaches us that biblical adoption is not like what we use the term adoption for now you have somebody who needs a home they're not your child you adopt them into your family and make them your child that's not this adoption that brother banh is talking about the adoption he's talking about is when a son is born to his father amen his father amen will watch his son build character in the sun before he places him in the family business or over the family farm and the placing of the sun in a position of of authority is adoption so adoption is placing of a mature sun so when a son comes to maturity where he can be trusted with responsibility in the father's kingdom then he is placed or he is adopted so this is what brother branham's talking about so so what spirit do we receive we receive the spirit of adoption so what does the spirit of adoption do the spirit of adoption brings you into the fullness of adoption so it's the holy ghost all the way through from the beginning to the end it's the spirit of adoption that brings you into the adoption now i want to make i want to make this really clear so that you understand what i'm saying and then i want to go back and and and diagram this maybe in the church age book brother branham gets to the smyrna church age and he said now comes our triumphal capstone on the baptism of the holy ghost so he's going to describe his teaching on the baptism of the holy ghost he says there it is jesus christ came forth died upon the cross and accomplished redemption restoring to original owner by means of purchase or paying the price and thereby placed us as sons he did not make us sons for we were already his sons but he placed us as sons for as long as we're in the world in the flesh we could not be recognized as his sons we were held captive by the devil but we were sons nonetheless and hear this and because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts whereby you cry father father upon whom did the spirit fall at pentecost sons at corinth upon sons while they heard the word what is the baptism with the holy ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of christ it is the new birth so what is the baptism of the holy ghost it is the new birth so you can't separate these two things out they are one and the same it is the spirit of god coming in you and feeling you after you have repented having heard his word and been baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience towards god further down in the same passage in the church age book he says to begin with you will notice that in my meetings when i have finished preaching in an evangelistic service or some teaching message i cast a net and invite a response from the people i ask them to come forward and receive the holy spirit my pentecostal friends upon hearing me say this believe that i'm inviting people to come forward to be baptized with the holy ghost because they are already born again so when i invite those who are spirit-filled to come and deal with those who have answered the invitation to receive the spirit these dear ones search forward and deal with the people in such a manner as to encourage them to yield to god and believe to speak in tongues this has caused a great deal of confusion and i want you to i i want to tell you exactly what i mean do you want to know what brother means exactly he's going to tell us exactly what he means i mean for the sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of christ by the holy ghost which is exactly what took place at pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the holy ghost it is one and the same so when brother brown comes through the church age book brother branham now he's editing the church age book into 1963 and into 1964 after the seals and when brother branham's editing the church age book he's got time to read back over cross out make changes and get his doctrine exactly the way he believes it amen so he clarifies doctrine in the church age book and when brother brahm clarifies his doctrine he does not separate the new birth and then you go through these virtues and you come to the baptism of the holy ghost but he says the baptism of the holy ghost and the new birth are the same thing it is one and the same so so we we must uh remember that that brother man made it so clear amen that there's there's no confusion on what he taught but when you go back and read in 1962 statue of a perfect man in blasphemous names there's things that he says amen where he's separating the two out and and i don't believe brother branham is changing his doctrine sometimes it you know we get confused it looks like brother branham is changing his doctrine you know but he's not sometimes he changes his terminology but he doesn't change his doctrine brother graham said i've taught the same thing all the way through and i'll give you an example of this amen and in case you're waiting for me to preach i'm preaching now we're doing a teaching tonight so hang with me and respond because i want to take my time so that we understand these things amen we know that teaching will establish the believer and we need to be established to have understanding so brother bam he we know if you know and study the message you know through the 50s and early 60s brother branham taught that you were three three uh you're a three-part being and your outer man was your body the inner realm the emotional realm next to that was your spirit and the inside of the inside was the soul but when he comes into 1961 and 1962 he changes some of those terms and he says the outside man is the body the inside emotional realm is the soul amen in the inside of the inside he says is the spirit so it caused a great deal of confusion and there's been a great deal of argument and people have struggled with what is soul and what is spirit and all of these other things and for me when i began to look at it i said well there's an easy way to solve this equation let's do away with all terminology let's just say the outside part is a the the emotional realm amen is b and the soul the inside of the inside is c a b c all right if you just take it a b c and you let it be a b c all the way through the message brother branham's teaching never changes what he says the outer realm does never changes what he says the next realm does never changes and what he says is the true you down on the inside where the c gene is amen never changes the inside of the inside is the true you and the outer two realms are fallen part of a hybrid nature and he never changes his teaching whatsoever the only thing he changed was terminology so so it's it becomes simple when you push the terminology to the side and says what is he teaching the teaching never changed only the terminology changed okay so now when we get into this subject let's do the same thing that brother man's not changing his doctrine amen the the the new birth is the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism holy ghost is the new birth all right but brother branham showing that there's something that takes place at the new birth amen that begins a process a process of growth amen and that growth now brings us to another work of the holy ghost which is a positional placing of a mature believer amen and that teaching never changes throughout his ministry no matter what terminology he puts to that so don't worry about the terminology look at the teaching what's the substance that's being teached and the substance never changes only the terminology so don't get confused brother branham's a man he said i have a seventh grade education he said i don't have language enough to explain these things but let's go below the terminology to the doctrine to the t and you'll find that his teaching doesn't change only the terminology so brother brahm says in blasphemous names you cannot join the church of the living god you're born into it by the baptism of the holy ghost so right here in blasphemius names he says it correctly he says it though i don't mean correctly like he says it correctly or incorrectly that i didn't mean it that way but he says it the same way he says it everywhere else in the message he says you're born into it by the baptism of the holy ghost and when you're baptized with the holy ghost these virtues are sealed in you by the holy ghost and therefore he that's born of god does not commit sin he cannot there you are so brother branham he uses the terminology the same way he was everywhere else even though in the same message it looks like he separates it so now the question is is he is he fluctuating on his doctrine in the same sermon no we want to understand what he's teaching and we understand what he's teaching all of a sudden everything he says makes sense [Music] praise god let's look at ephesians chapter 1. i want to really look at this in the scripture too because it brings a great deal of clarity to the subject so that we know in romans 8 you received the spirit of adoption so what does the spirit of adoption come for to bring you into adoption so when you receive the spirit you receive the spirit of adoption amen there's not two holy spirits there's one holy spirit when you receive the holy spirit it's the spirit of adoption and the spirit of adoption will bring you into adoption which is the working of the holy ghost amen so now let's look at ephesians chapter 1 verse 3. blessed be the father or blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved i want to look at verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption you mean the adoption is not by chance the adoption is not i hope i make it the adoption is not efforts amen because it sounds like it brother branham says he says and the scripture says you know add to your faith virtue and add to your virtue knowledge and add this and add this and it's as if you're climbing this ladder to get to christ but but it's the spirit of adoption that's in you that's moving you up the ladder it's the spirit of adoption that you've received that is bringing you into the fullness of adoption or maturing you into a mature believer so that god can place you into a work in his kingdom amen that's what the spirit of adoption is doing it's not you climbing anything it's not you doing anything it's the spirit picking you up and moving you into adoption which you were predestinated to you're not it's not if i'm a good boy and if i work really hard and if i if i do everything right then i can finally come to this goal of adoption you were predestinated unto adoption you'll never come to adoption unless you were predestinated unto adoption and if you're predestinated into adoption you'll receive the spirit of adoption which will bring you into adoption and what is adoption placing of a son when is the son placed when he comes to maturity when he's full-grown we'll talk about all these terms i so want to go through this because i find that there's so much confusion even about our own lives amen and the devil brings confusion and other teachings bring confusion amen but praise god amen we were predestinated unto adoption and we've received the spirit of adoption praise be to god without that there's no way now for me personally if you come down here and you make this the new birth and you make this the baptism of the holy ghost and you have to work your way to the holy ghost and you have to have faith and then after you have faith and brother branham said you can't get above the rung he said so many people try to jump to the top and they fall off and bust their heads he said you've got to go to faith and then add to faith virtue and add to virtue knowledge and add to that temperance and add to add to ada until you get all the way up to the capstone which is christ and then you can be sealed until the day of redemption you know if i have to make this climb without the baptism of the holy ghost i'm never going to make it to the top i'm not going to get my first foot on the first rung of the ladder it's an impossibility amen that teaching is the most discouraging teaching i've ever heard in my life that in order for you to come to the ceiling to guarantee the baptism of the holy ghost which guarantees you to the day of redemption you've got to come amen after a confession you've got to begin to work through faith and then through virtue and then through knowledge and you don't have the holy ghost all ready to do it i say oh god there's no way you'll never make it you keep failing and falling down but i'm so glad that brother branham come along and he says these two are the same thing amen right here i received the baptism of the holy ghost the spirit of adoption and now when i need to go to faith amen the holy ghost quickens faith to me and when i need to move the virtue the holy ghost gives holy ghost virtue to me and when i move into knowledge the holy ghost gives scriptural knowledge unto me it's not me doing amen it's me yielding amen to the tudor who's bringing me into adoption [Music] praise be to god so let's keep going in the message and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy from 1962 it says now there are a lot of times where many of us pentecostals has made a mistake i think well the holy ghost is poured out on me glory to god that's all i have to have no sir you're just then getting started so the holy ghost isn't the finish line the holy ghost is the starting line so you can't separate these out and make the holy ghost the finish line the holy ghost is the starting line you're just then getting started it you it's not then it's your test and your trial just like we find in the old testament testing's trying and then placing a sun adoption placing the sun after he's already a son been born into the family he's a son then he would be tested and tried and raised up by tutors and see how he comes out and then he's placed positionally equal almost to his father so brother ben is now showing that he down here already knows that he's a son right here he knows he's a son but that son cannot be put into position to work for the father or work in the kingdom until he's gone through a maturing process where he can handle the responsibility amen but he's never going to be cast out as a son he's never going to be disqualified as a son he will always be a son because he come from his father's genes amen and so now when he's born he's born a son amen and he grows up into adoption but he knows all along that he's the son so if he fails in his trials and his testings amen he comes to the he's working his way up and let's just use this uh imagery he's working his way learning his lessons and he's learning from the tutor but he fails he fails a lesson and he falls the furthest he can fall is back to being a son of god the furthest he can drop in his failure is to be a son of god brother benham said god he didn't come to make you a son you've always been sons but by the baptism of the holy ghost you woke up to the fact that you're a sign you come to yourself you realize that you're part of the genes of god amen you recognize who your father is and you recognize where you came from amen and so you've woke up to the fact that you're a son of god and no matter how many trials you fail and how far you fall off of this ladder and how big the bump is at the bottom the furthest you can go is to being a son of god praise be to god and i believe without that revelation you'll have no heart to even begin this journey to maturity because this journey to maturity is full of testings full of trials full of successes and full of failures because that's how we learn amen the the when when brother branham types this adoption he teaches it as a as a man who has a household and has a farm and has an estate and he's got all these things going on in his estate and he's got a son born from his loins it's his son and he wants this son to come to a place where he can take part in the business and maybe take over it someday so he finds the very best tutor that he can get the son and brother branham tells us that tutor is the holy ghost and he turns the son over to the tutor and the tutor begins to give him lessons you know have you ever been in school and had lessons they weren't all easy and you didn't pass them all but that was the point to learn the point listen the point in the trials and the testings that god sends our way is not for us to never fail that's never been the point the point has always been to learn and to mature so now with these testings and these trials and these difficulties if you stumble if you fall if you fail amen there's a revelation that i'm always a son i've always been a son he'll never cast me away as a son i am a son of god he is my father amen and with i say without that revelation who has heart enough to try to mature into christ only if you believe you've been predestinated unto adoption now it goes on to say hearing blasphemous names he says do you remember over in the book of matthew the 17th chapter the first and the fifth verse jesus on mount transfiguration you you've heard hear you've heard hear ye him that's the message brother branham preached the sermon i just hear about a year ago preached become so popular hear ye him the placing of a son in ephesians 1 5 god has predestinated us unto adoption of sons see a family when a son is born into it it's a sun then you got that it's a sun at your new birth you're a sun then because you've always been a son you just recognize you're a son but that son had tutors to raise it and that that son never did come to be the right kind of son he never became heir but if he was the right son and the son that obeyed his father then that son was adopted or placed positionally he'd become heir of what the father had and that's what god was doing on mount transfiguration when he took his own son after he had been proved to be the right son and had stood all temptations he took him up on mount transfiguration and overshadowed him so brother brother bam showing us that jesus becomes our example in this adoption work so jesus is the example when he's been proven to be the right son did did jesus face trials did he face testings that the pharisees testing the describes testing amen he was tested on every account he was tested and he was tried he had testings of all kinds and when he was proved to be the right kind of son he stood all temptations he took him up on mount transfiguration and overshadowed him what was he doing he was bringing jesus to adoption you know in the old testament they took a son dressed him in a nice pretty garment and set him out before the public and they had a ceremony of placing or we call it adopting in galatians there i kind of think paul refers to it as adopting sons now but placing us on ministers who understand spiritual bible readers of placing the sun in other words the son was a son when he was born there is where our pentecostal people made their mistake being born into the family by the holy ghost that's right but then we must be the right kind of children tutored by the right tutor see now if a man back in the old age thought of his son he wanted him to be a right kind of a son he got the best tutor he could find the best teacher because he wanted his son to come up to be like his daddy so why have we been given the tutor of the holy ghost to become like our daddy so when when we have the spirit of adoption that's bringing us into our predestinated place of adoption the the adoption is to bring us into a place where we'll be like our daddy so he got the right tutor now if a man on earth would think of the best tutor how about god our father now he never got bishops and cardinals and priests he got the holy ghost to be our tutor and the holy spirit is our teacher so i want to look at jesus because he becomes our example here let's turn in our bibles to matthew chapter 3. matthew chapter 3. and verse 16. and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased so here when jesus is brought to jordan to be baptized of john amen brother branham shows us typing our baptism with the holy ghost and he comes now to jordan at the appointed time and now the holy ghost descends upon him like a dove and lights upon him and a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased but brother branham does not make this his adoption brother branham points to mount transfiguration as his adoption because from this point he's led of the spirit the tudor into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil because he's got to be tested and tried to prove that he's the right kind of son before he can take the authority that comes with maturity so we're not calling jesus immature at this stage we're just showing the type that brother branham used amen he doesn't make this his adoption amen he makes this his receiving the holy ghost and he makes mount transfiguration his adoption so the question is where did the holy ghost come right here amen the holy ghost came right here at this point at the beginning of his ministry and birthed him into the ministry and when he was birthed then into the ministry he went through testings and trials but then he comes to mount transfiguration and brother branham calls that adoption so he says this is this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased let's go to matthew 17. we'll go to mount transfiguration now mount transfiguration matthew 17 verse 1 and after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as light and behold there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with him then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for thee one for moses and one for elias while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which saith this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him so he repeats the same phrase amen from jordan he repeats this is this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased then he adds the phrase hear ye him now he's speaking for me now he's taking adoption now he's taking the father's place with the same authority hear ye him so brother branham uses this to type amen our journey so when we look at this we see jesus jesus at jordan and that mount transfiguration all right at jordan there was a pillar of fire all right i meant transfiguration there was a cloud which one was the holy ghost both when you have the bride you have pentecost and you have mount sunset at pentecost you had the pillar of fire at mount sunset you had the cloud [Music] which one was the holy ghost the holy ghost come on the day of pentecost and birth the church amen but brother branham says he's been building that church over seven church ages to bring the church into adoption but when it come adoption time amen came in the capstone came down in the form of a cloud there was a pillar fire and there was a cloud and brother branham said the holy ghost amen the holy ghost has been bound by these denominational rivers for nearly two thousand years but is loose in the evening time by the losing time message the holy ghost back in the church again but what do you mean back in the church again brother branham showed us that at the beginning at pentecost amen the pillar of fire the holy ghost came into the people and birthed the bride amen but then grew through seven church ages through trials and testings and successes and failures grew to an understanding to a knowledge to a level of maturity amen where the holy ghost would cap now this great pyramid through these seven church ages and say speak because she will be the final voice to the final age amen she in revelations 10 8-11 she eats the book amen john eats the book and prophesies again and so now at the capping off he's saying hear ye him now hear you him in her amen so even brother branham even brother branham he has ohio river and mount sunset here he has a pillar of fire and here he has a cloud which one was the holy ghost which one was christ which one wasn't is it you see god is just establishing and confirming establishing and confirming amen you can't say over here he had one thing and over here he got something different no it's the same thing amen god is building a ministry and capping it off god is building a bride and capping it off god is displaying his son and capping it off and bringing it to adoption amen you can't say down here this wasn't the holy ghost it was the holy ghost you can't say over here it's not the holy ghost it is the holy ghost and everything in between is the holy ghost brother branham said it's been the holy ghost all the way through seven church ages it was the holy ghost that brought amen the messengers the revelations of the messenger it was the holy ghost that brought the people the revelation of the word and built them up it was the holy ghost in the beginning it was the holy ghost as a tudor all the way through and it's the holy ghost capping it at the end amen brother brahma goes it says in the message you must be born again from 1961 he said born christians grow into the stature of christ as they live they're born again their lives begin to shape like a baby it takes form and begins to grow first thing you know there here they are in full stature further down he says but be borne of the spirit and grow into the stature of christ you see it brother dao growing into the statue of christ through your life proves like if you were born to prophet you'll remain that if you were born a christian you'll remain that if you abide in me and my words abide in you this grows you up into the stature of christ so now you're born of the spirit receive the spirit of adoption but you're predestinated to grow into adoption so now that holy ghost is your tutor is bringing you as the individual the same path he brought the church ages bringing you into adoption so that he can do what the same thing he did at the end of the church ages cap you off amen and cap you off with charity with love with the holy ghost to seal you as a unit amen and give you a position in the kingdom where now you can speak the word and now you can be part of christ displaying christ let's look at galatians chapter four i probably should have read this scripture earlier but we'll get to it now galatians chapter 4 verse 1. galatians chapter 4 and verse 1. says now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differs nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but is under tutors and governors unto the time appointed to the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son than an heir of god through christ so because you are a son he sent you the spirit of his son which is the spirit of adoption to bring you into adoption to place you as a son to make you a joint heir of all things and part of the kingdom work now if you're a son you are ordained to make it you are ordained to adopt and in this age you are ordained to full adoption you're not ordained to stop where luther stopped and luther's day he could only go so far amen in wesley's day he could only go so far but that's not this day this day we're to grow into the full stature of the stature of jesus christ amen but when we look at this okay when we begin to grow we're born again here we begin to grow into maturity not be good to grow into a christian not begin to grow into a sun but growing into maturity and that process amen is bringing us into adoption adoption is placing and he doesn't place until we come to maturity so how fast we come to maturity sometimes is dependent on us you're ordained unto adoption you're predestinated unto adoption you receive the spirit of adoption but as long as we keep fooling around and not learning our lessons and playing around and skipping out on class and you understand the analogy as long as we we're just fooling around with the world and playing around you're ordained to get there but you're you're just killing a lot of time and you're kicking around a bunch and the tutor and the father are going to have to make sure that there's some other kind of trials they meant to get your attention focused back on what you are predestinated to because you're predestinated to adoption and i say if we've been born again by the spirit of god and receive the spirit of adoption let's recognize that we've been ordained into adoption to come into the stature of christ and let's quit fooling around with the world and wasting time but let's get serious and say god i want to be everything you've called me to be in this life i want every virtue working in me i want faith i want virtue i want i want knowledge and temperance and all of that working in me because i want to be a display of you in this world if we know what our purpose is if we know what's happened to us in our new birth brother man said the pentecostals got it wrong they thought i received the baptism of the holy ghost that's all i need that's not why he gave you the baptism of the holy ghost he gave you the spirit of adoption to bring you into adoption not to give you the spirit of adoption so you can go out and play with your buddies and go fishing down on the bank of the river brother branham said i could go fish every day of my life and be just as saved as i am now would you have lost his sonship no he can't lose his sonship he can't lose amen to see gene of god but what he's doing is wasting time not fulfilling his purpose he can never lose his position as a son but god had ordained him into adoption and so the tutor was bringing him into his position so it helps to know what we're here for it helps to know what god's doing in our lives why the trial without this kind of understanding that the prophet gave us then our life is just a bunch of difficult circumstances string together amen we can't wait to get out of here i just want to die and go to the sixth dimension because we don't understand what god is doing the father wants to bring us into a position amen he wants to place us in the inheritance in the kingdom and he wants us to speak like he would speak on this earth he wants us to lay hands on the sick and pray for them he wants us to speak he wants us to share the word he wants us to give the revelation he wants us to prophesy again he wants us to speak but if you don't know what's going on you say well i believe the message i receive the baptism the holy ghost praise god and then the rest of our life is a is is aimless the rest of our life is confusion the rest of our life we have good days and then we have bad days and we don't understand the bad days but we thank god for the good days and we always pray for another good day and then something bad happens and we're like why is all this bad stuff happening to me because we don't realize that you've been ordained predestinated unto adoption you've been predestined to have every virtue of christ flowing in your life and flowing out from you and he's got to put it to the test so that you learn the lesson so that he can draw out the virtue and without this teaching our life becomes just life just routine broke up by a few highlights and some difficult things we cry sometimes and we laugh sometimes and not in the understanding that god wants a people on this earth that'll speak like he speaks act like he lacks be whatever he is she will be him amen this is the age of adoption and he has brought the church unto adoption under this ministry now as individuals he wants us to come to the same place but we have to know what's going on what did he save me for why did i receive the holy ghost what was my experience with him even about it's because he wants another messiah on this earth he wants a god what does he want you to be the tudor is trying to get you to be like your father your father's god the tudor's trying to get you to act like a god he's trying to get you to be a messiah he's trying to get you to represent christ upon the earth amen and without that understanding we're just confused but with that understanding you say i get it i understand here's a trial he's testing me so that he can give me more responsibility so i'm going to pass this test what does the word say how do i overcome how do i conquer this in my life how do i get over this complex how do i get healed how do i overcome this not just you know grit my teeth and bear it till it's over with and hope it's over with soon but no i god is testing me amen when brother branham begins to talk about in the in the mess the adoption messages he says when the holy ghost gives a report back to the father he said oh father he's just like you he handles the sheep just the way you handle them amen when this circumstance happened he did it just like you would do it well how would god handle any situation god would handle every situation by his word every situation he's ever had he handled by the word he's solved by the word he conquered by the word and what is he looking for his son to do he's looking for a son to start acting like him so what does he want us to do he wants us to recognize that this trial is not for my destruction this this testing is not for my annoyance amen this is a test oh what was that equation we went over that before on sunday when the preacher was preaching he talked about this what was that scripture he used that's it i got it i'm applying it and i'm overcoming and i pass the test praise god he says in the message hear ye him from 1960 god also here was doing what he we call on in the bible the placing of a son now in the old testament when a child was born a son and a home then that son was a son as soon as he was born of course he was the son of the father but yet before he felt heir to the kingdom of his father or the possession the the first that son had to be raised and tried he had to find out whether his son was a true son or was he just simply a roused about and this son would never be heir if he wasn't qualified to take his father's place but he was qualified and took the father's place then all that the father had was given to his son there's where i think that many of us pentecostal people has made a mistake we think as soon as we become sons and daughters of god that settles it we just come into the place of trying the method is said as soon as they shouted that settled it the lutherans believed by faith on justification though it settled it no matter what kind of position god puts you in you're still growing going on towards perfection and we will never reach it until jesus comes see when we take the analogy of the of the of the man over his estate trying to raise up a son who could he could turn a responsibility over to when that son comes a full age he becomes an adult 18 20 23 24 whatever it is and the tutor declares that he's learned his lessons he can handle responsibility and his father puts him over some portion of the estate amen the father did not expect that this son will never learn anything else and grow in virtue one drop from here on out so we should never expect the same thing we shouldn't be waiting till we come to some kind of form of our own idea of perfection before we get busy about the father's business god is looking for maturity not perfection the way we understand perfection he's looking for us to come to a level of maturity where we can handle something that he puts in our hands to do and then we'll go do it but that's not the end of our growing in virtue amen this young man who starts to work in the father's estate as he works he's going to labor and work and he's going to have more trials and more testings and he's going to learn more virtue he's going to gain an experience and gain an understanding just because the father brought him to adoption didn't mean he was done growing it just means he came to a level of maturity he can use him god is not we're not waiting till i'm done growing my goodness before i can do something before god can really use me i i got a lot more rough edges more we all got rough edges to knock off we all got lessons to learn but can we come to a level of maturity by the word to where we can say you know what i may be only 18 and i haven't learned everything yet but i know enough i can do something for the kingdom of god i know enough i've got the message i mean i've grown up in it god has taught me lesson after lesson after lesson i'm not going to keep waiting and waiting and waiting if god gives me something to do i'm going to do it with all of my heart amen not waiting for there's no more learning not waiting till i come to perfection and every virtue my goodness you're going to be waiting for a glorified body and you're going to be you're going to be in your theophany body before you ever do anything for the kingdom of god but i say god help me lord help us come to that place of maturity where you can use us and the stature of a perfect man he says then the word come from here manifest itself through each one of these beings and makes this complete being a tabernacle of the living god a walking living example of christianity where christ was these people are because his life is in there they are they are in christ and their life is dead and hid in christ through god and sealed in there by the holy ghost first corinthians 12 that's right you reckon yourself dead then you're born of faith then virtue and these other things is added to you till you're a perfect living image of god let's look at this in ephesians chapter 4. ephesians chapter 4 verse 11. and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ edifying means building up so through seven church ages he's used a five full ministry to build up this body and for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man so what is this ministry doing bringing us to a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up unto him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth according to the factual working and the measure of every part making increase of the body into the edifying of itself in love so this fightful ministry is to bring the perfecting of the saints the work of the ministry the edifying the building up of the body of christ till we all come into the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ to a perfect man and we come into the headship because christ is the head and we're growing into this capstone of love but this definition of perfect man i want to go through the definition so we don't have any wrong understanding of what this word is this greek word it can be interpreted perfect it means man or a full age the definition means brought to its end finished wanting nothing necessary to completeness perfect that was just perfect consummate human integrity and virtue of men full grown adult of full age mature when you come when something comes to maturity it has not come to perfection the way we use the term perfection but it has come to completeness when you come to full maturity at 17 18 19 years of old it means you're not getting any taller you're done growing you've come to your full maturity you begin to fill out thicken up amen you you now look like a man amen you've come to a level of maturity we're not expecting you to grow anymore like you did between 6 and 10 between 10 and 14. you understand you've come to maturity that doesn't mean perfect it means complete it means mature and when this this teaching is to bring us into a perfect man and to the stature of christ it doesn't mean that we have to come to perfectness with no failure anymore no learning or no growing it means we've come to a level of maturity that we can be established as christians to be his representatives on earth to be ambassadors for the kingdom of god if we don't understand this then we never have the courage to do anything we're always waiting he said and we went through it this morning you can't expect a baby to be born a man that's why when somebody comes to christ we better be patient they've got to mature somebody gives their heart to the lord and you see god begin to deal with somebody and you can tell that they have an experience you better be patient because they've got to grow in virtue they've got to grow in patience they have to grow in temperance but you who are mature should already have enough temperance to cover for their lack of temperance you should have a brotherly kindness to cover for when they don't have enough temperaments to control themselves when they don't have enough patience to wait for the word to work you should have enough brotherly kindness amen to cover for the one who hasn't because you can tell that they're growing you don't expect a baby to be born a man it's got to grow to it and we grow in christ to the full stature not somebody get converted tonight tomorrow go to preach the gospel we grow up into manhood into the stature of christ brother brenham never stood for somebody playing honky tonk in a bar room one night and they got saved and gloriously converted and the next night they're playing gospel hymns no he says you've got to grow up amen you've got to mature and then when you mature you can be positionally placed and begin to work in the kingdom of god brother branham never stood for that because he understood that you received the spirit of adoption to bring you to adoption to place you as a son and god can use you in his kingdom amen but that process doesn't have to take 10 years it doesn't have to take 15 years i don't even know if it has to take a year i don't think you put a timeline on it and then it's probably different when when you receive the new birth if you if you have a lot of life experience and you receive the new birth at 40 years old i doubt it takes as long for you to mature as when you receive it when you're 10 or 11. but it just depends on what god's doing in you and how you're growing i don't know that every son that went through the adoption process got there at the same time i don't think each one of us get there at the same time i think some of us are looking at others of us and saying are you going to ever quit drinking the bottle because we want to realize what is god doing in my life what am i supposed to be achieving what is happening what what is all of this about and brother benham showed us what it's all about he goes to say in the message the way back now before i read this i want to draw one thing we know that we begin down here in the new birth and we grow into this into maturity i want to write maturity so that we don't we're not mistaken and that maturity brings us to adoption which is placing where god can begin to use you he began to use you to minister to other people in the bride he can begin to use you to witness the message he can begin to use you in song he can begin to use you in works in the church he can begin to use you in different ways in in preaching and bible study and sunday school teachers and there's a myriad of ways god can use you so don't ever just think well when i come to adoption i'll probably have an office in the church don't wait for that but there's all kinds of works that need to be done in the kingdom of god but when you come to maturity you come to adoption or placing and a new birth and i would just like to just do this this so maybe we understand more clearly some of the things brother bannon was saying this position confirms this experience i think this is what brother ben was talking about that when we see when we come to adoption and replace and god's using us in his kingdom it's a confirmation we were born sons of god because if we never ever come to that place then why were you on the earth why were you here what was your existence for if god brought a seed of god on the earth and brought you here and gave you life amen and brought you to the new birth and gave you the word enough to be born but he has no purpose for you after that that you weren't predestinated unto adoption you were only predestinated unto birth but you were never predestined to come to maturity and do something that he wants you to do serve a purpose for him and this earth no god has a purpose for every one of his attributes there's something he wants to do in us and through us in this world there's some light we need to shine somewhere there's some life we need to touch in some way there's some work we need to do for him in some way he didn't just put us here on the earth fill us with the holy ghost and say oh good i've saved that one but he he brought us to a new birth to bring us to adoption to do what he always purposed for us to do in this age that we're here so the the the positional placing confirms the new birth you can't say i was born again but never mature never come into the kingdom of god never grow one drop the question now is about your new birth and i think that's what brother this is just brother chad i could change my opinion tomorrow so don't put a ton of stock but when i see what he's saying and the way he's teaching it i think that's part of what he's showing that you can't just say well i'm born again no you go on into adoption you're sealed in there the holy ghost vulcanizes seals all these attributes together and now you're in a very image of jesus christ that was the purpose he birthed you for that was the purpose you're on this earth to speak for him to live for him to manifest him so if you say i've been born again but never take a step towards maturity the question is were you it's like you know brother branham was talking about uh justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost consists of new birth and and you know brother man made the statement you can have justification without sanctification sanctification and he's showing that through the church ages luther came up to justification and he didn't go any farther came up to sanctification amen but what proved it was the bride all along is because the baptism the holy ghost came and the person himself came to unite with this body that had built up vindicating that it was all him the justification was him the sanctification was him the baptism was him he vindicated it all because the brother branham come and told us this is where this fit and this is where this fit is god building his body and then we saw amen the capping off of the church the holy ghost returned to the church vindicating what that prophet taught us but how can you say i've come to justification but no further but i'm a child of god no if you're a child of god you'll come all the way into the new birth and the new birth vindicate your justification because justification is just as if you've never done it in the first place that's justification and that's why we don't go to judgment because you've never done anything to be judged for you can't say i'm justified but i can never get the sanctification i can that may be true but what's going to be the evidence your justification was true the new verse the new birth is the evidence your justification was true your sanctification was true amen because millions have dropped off somewhere and when millions have thought they've come to the new birth and never come to adoption they've dropped off somewhere that's why i say the placing vindicates the new birth because millions can drop off through the church ages millions dropped off they refused to go on they were pruned off but the real heart of the tree kept on moving from one stage to the next from the next stage to the next and god was building his bride like he builds a person and that's how he builds us and if we're children of god we are predestinated unto the adoption of children by jesus christ you'll move from one step to the next to the next why because you've received the spirit of adoption brother branham says in the message the way back now we find that we see that one time that the inoculation was not too good there was a conscience always of sin he's speaking of the old testament and he had to come year by year and make his offering but now in hebrews it tells us that if the worshiper is once purged he is no more conscious of sin or otherwise no more desire to sin the whole thing's gone from him there's no more you don't have to sin every day you don't have to do these things you do it because you willfully want to and the reason you really willfully want to is because you have never died to yourself well brother i know that's scorching but it's good when you die to yourself then you become a new creature then those things are gone and if you try to act like you've got them before you have it's like i said the other day like a black bird trying to put in peacock feathers in his wings so you see i'm a peacock he isn't that's something he's stuck in himself it has to grow from the inside out and that's the way the holy spirit is it's not something you smear on or something like that it's a new birth you've got to be born again and these virtues of the holy ghost has got to come from the inside out and if you're predestinated to adoption they will let's look at the last scripture for tonight philippians chapter one musicians you can make your way up brother john or no i'm sorry brother ben you can come on up look at philippians chapter 1 and verse 6. being confident of this very thing that he which had begun a good work in you will perform it unto the day of jesus christ if god has truly brought you to the new birth he will bring you to the adoption that's why he brought you to the new birth he brought you to the new birth to bring you to the adoption don't let the devil lie but i would encourage you to do this yield to the tutor and say father teach me recognize every obstacle in life as training recognize everything that we go through every opportunity every obstacle every junction in the road recognize this as god training me and teaching me because i need it for this life but i need it for the next one too because i'm taking with me all these lessons and the character that i gained it's going with me let's all stand i hope i hope i hope that didn't confuse anybody anymore i hope that brought clarity to you because that was the goal now when you go back and read through statue of a perfect man and blasphemous names don't get confused just let the big picture make everything else make sense man let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word and god i thank you for this message god what will we do if you hadn't sent a prophet lord god you were so good to us that you gave us all these tapes recorded sermons books because you wanted us to understand the bible
