[0:00] are we a part of one body
[0:02] do we make mistakes
[0:05] do we have a backside
[0:09] we have a backside we all have Parts in
[0:12] our lives that we're ashamed of do we
[0:14] have weakness
[0:16] three people in here testify that they
[0:18] have weaknesses
[0:20] I was gonna say I'm not feeling very
[0:22] comfortable someone else needs to come
[0:24] up here quick we have weakness
[0:27] we are insufficient we all have a
[0:30] backside we're ashamed of
[0:33] don't tell me you don't you know you do
[0:37] don't sit look at me I'm self-righteous
[0:39] you ain't got no righteousness remember
[0:40] this is an imputed righteousness by
[0:42] faith not of your good works you've got
[0:44] nothing to boast in you've got nothing
[0:47] that you can say look at me I'm doing a
[0:49] great job no you gotta backside you do
[0:51] your best to hide it from everybody
[0:53] everybody does I don't blame you please
[0:55] thank you I appreciate it
[0:58] you see what I'm saying
[1:00] we all got a backside we all got things
[1:03] in our lives we just don't like that
[1:04] much
[1:05] what if I told you the weakness that you
[1:07] have is a blessing from God
[1:10] what if I what if I told you you don't
[1:12] actually thank God for the right things
[1:14] at times
[1:16] brother Branham said that
[1:18] Point Blank said it you're praying about
[1:20] the wrong things we pray for comfort and
[1:23] peace
[1:24] he gives us trials and tribulations
[1:27] we pray that we have no problems we pray
[1:29] that we have no weakness you're praying
[1:31] wrong
[1:33] you should be thanking God
[1:36] that you're weak broken miserable
[1:40] and in need of God
[1:44] because if you are so strong
[1:47] that you had no weakness in you you
[1:49] would never look for him you would never
[1:51] seek his face daily you're too strong
[1:54] you got it all put together you make no
[1:57] mistakes why do you need God
[1:59] you see the foolishness of that thought
[2:01] you see why you have to consider your
[2:03] brother and sister differently this is
[2:05] not a Works based system salvation has
[2:08] nothing to do with anything you can do
[2:11] it's a gift from God period brother
[2:13] banham said you can't add anything to it
[2:16] that's his gift to you
[2:19] thank you
[2:20] and so in considering the fact that we
[2:23] all have a backside and we all have
[2:26] weaknesses and we all make mistakes on a
[2:29] regular basis
[2:31] um what amount of Grace are we to give
[2:33] one another
[2:34] what all we to do with our brother and
[2:36] sister who by God's grace might have
[2:40] made him weak in that particular area
[2:43] that you're strong
[2:45] but you want to identify his weakness
[2:48] to exalt yourself
[2:50] and at the same time hydroxide
[2:55] you understand what I'm saying
[2:57] that don't make sense nobody this don't
[2:59] make sense
[3:01] this church better than this church
[3:03] because they don't see what we see
[3:06] but I bet they see some things about you
[3:08] that you don't see
[3:12] you know like I don't I can't see my
[3:14] backside anybody try to turn around see
[3:16] your back so you can't see it you can't
[3:18] see your weaknesses you can't see where
[3:20] you're falling short sometimes you can't
[3:22] see that backside of yours sometimes but
[3:25] your brother can
