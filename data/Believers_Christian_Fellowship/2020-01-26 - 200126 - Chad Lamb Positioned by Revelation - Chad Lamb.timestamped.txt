[4:06] song because it's a positive confession
[4:09] i'll tell you i i'm tired of singing
[4:11] songs
[4:13] about feeling sorry for myself for
[4:16] suffering in this horrible world
[4:21] amen we're not suffering we're
[4:23] overcoming

[4:59] rescued from a horrible condition
[5:01] i'm longing to come into my position so
[5:03] that we can have the final victory
[5:05] [Applause]
[5:07] we're free we're not hoping to be free
[5:09] we're free the word of god has called us
[5:11] free we're free
[5:13] we need to start believing it and
[5:14] believing will cause an action
[5:16] and an action will bring results
[5:19] praise be to god well god bless you
[5:24] amen sorry you keep standing i keep
[5:27] preaching but it's a good day to be
[5:29] alive
[5:31] amen let's turn to the book of exodus
[5:35] chapter 19 thank you musicians and while
[5:38] you're flipping there i got an exciting
[5:40] announcement to make
[5:41] there's been the yet the birth of
[5:43] another baby
[5:45] we have another little baby girl ilya
[5:47] and natasha losing off
[5:49] had their little baby maybe it was two
[5:52] and a half weeks early pretty much and
[5:54] she came by a surprise i was quite
[5:56] surprised but
[5:58] she's perfect she's perfectly healthy

[6:10] she's a beautiful little girl
[6:12] god has certainly been good to us milana
[6:14] elia luzenov
[6:16] so we just want to thank god for the
[6:18] birth of this baby
[6:20] amen while we're standing let's look at
[6:23] exodus 19.
[6:28] exodus 19.
[6:39] and verse 3.
[6:43] and moses went up unto god and the lord
[6:46] called unto him out of the mountain
[6:48] saying thus shalt thou say to the house
[6:50] of jacob and tell the children of israel
[6:52] you have seen what i did unto the
[6:54] egyptians and how i bear you on eagle's
[6:56] wings and brought you unto myself
[6:58] now therefore if you will obey my voice
[7:00] indeed and keep my covenant
[7:02] then you shall be a peculiar
[7:07] a peculiar treasure unto me above all
[7:09] people
[7:10] for all the earth is mine and you shall
[7:12] be unto me a kingdom of priests
[7:15] and a holy nation and they these are the
[7:17] words which thou shalt speak
[7:19] unto the children of israel let's just
[7:22] bow our heads and ask the lord
[7:23] to bless the reading of his word the
[7:25] heavenly father we thank you lord jesus
[7:28] that we can be here
[7:29] that you've given us ears to hear and
[7:31] eyes to see and a desire in our heart to
[7:33] gather together lord
[7:35] to hear your word and lord we trust in
[7:37] your ways and we know that you'll speak
[7:38] to us because you said you would
[7:40] and god we come with faith in our hearts
[7:42] lord looking to your
[7:44] promised word and for you to fulfill and
[7:46] keep your word and speak to our hearts
[7:48] the things that we have need of in this
[7:49] hour
[7:50] i pray that you would lay the man to the
[7:51] side lord but you would come yourself
[7:53] by the power of your spirit and speak
[7:55] through these lips of clay
[7:56] through a gift lord that you've placed
[7:58] in this vessel you would speak
[8:00] words of eternal life the things that we
[8:02] have need of most in this hour
[8:04] and that we might be equipped for the
[8:05] battle lord that we might be given the
[8:07] strength to overcome
[8:08] by your word we ask you to take
[8:10] preeminence among us in jesus christ's
[8:12] name we pray
[8:14] amen god bless you as you're seated
[8:18] amen i saw brother greg bird's parents
[8:21] back there god bless you it's good to
[8:22] have you both here with us
[8:24] amen i i i usually lose
[8:27] all senses when i come out here and
[8:29] start preaching and i know there's
[8:31] visitors sometimes and i forget to even
[8:33] greet them
[8:34] last week uh natalie's parents were here
[8:36] for the baby dedication and her
[8:38] grandparents and i saw him sitting right
[8:39] there and
[8:40] right out of my mind you have to forgive
[8:43] me friends
[8:44] i i i'm there's weaknesses we're human
[8:48] but but praise god the word is good
[8:51] amen i'm so i've got such a single track
[8:55] mind sometimes
[8:56] but god is good amen sometimes
[9:00] my wife would even ask me over a church
[9:01] didn't you see so and so was there i
[9:02] said i saw him
[9:03] she was why didn't you greet him i said
[9:06] because i couldn't think of what their
[9:07] name was
[9:10] i know them i can say their name a
[9:11] hundred times in a row but when i'm
[9:13] standing here
[9:14] preaching the word that everything else
[9:16] is gone sometimes friends
[9:18] just bear with me god bless you all now
[9:21] you know my secret
[9:24] sometimes i couldn't name my children
[9:26] when i'm up here
[9:28] amen but here we see that we're in the
[9:31] exodus journey
[9:32] when we look at this scripture in exodus
[9:34] 19 and the
[9:36] the the children of israel according to
[9:38] a promise that was given to abraham
[9:40] now they are abraham's seed and the
[9:42] promise is the abraham
[9:43] seed and they're the natural which is
[9:45] typing the spiritual
[9:46] and they're being brought out of bondage
[9:49] amen in an exodus journey to be taken in
[9:51] to the land to the promised land and we
[9:54] know for us
[9:55] we're part of this third exodus being
[9:57] taken out of bondage of
[9:58] denominationalism and brought
[10:00] back into the land of the word amen
[10:02] brought back to the original word
[10:05] in the original intent with the original
[10:07] understanding and revelation
[10:09] and so now we're very much in this same
[10:11] spot and he's going to bring this people
[10:13] back
[10:14] amen and before he established the
[10:16] priesthood and before there was ever a
[10:17] king
[10:18] he wanted to bring them back a peculiar
[10:20] people a treasure unto himself a
[10:22] peculiar treasure
[10:24] a holy nation amen a kingdom of priests
[10:27] so it wasn't god's original order amen
[10:30] just
[10:30] to set up the priesthood and and have
[10:32] all these levels of intercession and
[10:34] things going on
[10:35] he wanted the people to be priests he
[10:37] wanted the people to be holy
[10:39] amen he didn't he didn't want them under
[10:41] the rulership of a king
[10:42] and we know that's part of the plan it
[10:44] comes later to display the attributes of
[10:46] christ i understand all that
[10:48] but just to see the type what he's
[10:50] wanting is he wants them
[10:51] all to come in with dominion and
[10:53] authority
[10:54] and power amen he wants to give them all
[10:57] their portion of their own land
[10:58] for them to take amen not to have a king
[11:01] to take it for them
[11:02] but for them to take the portion that's
[11:04] been given to them
[11:05] and when god brings us in this third
[11:07] exodus in this journey brings us across
[11:10] jordan amen through the through the
[11:11] third pool through the third phase
[11:13] crossing jordan now he wants each one of
[11:16] us not to depend
[11:17] amen on somebody else not to depend on
[11:20] another system
[11:21] but each one of ourselves amen to
[11:23] understand that we are in the position
[11:25] amen of a priest a royal priesthood a
[11:27] holy nation
[11:28] that the people amen have a connection
[11:31] with god that the people
[11:32] are a priesthood
[11:35] so this this morning by the grace of god
[11:38] i'd like to speak on position by
[11:40] revelation
[11:42] because if you don't know your position
[11:45] i mean that's that's detrimental when
[11:47] you don't know your position you don't
[11:48] know what to do
[11:50] but when you know your position now you
[11:51] begin to understand
[11:53] you know that's what's so detrimental
[11:55] about denominationalism and even
[11:56] denominational ideas
[11:58] even in ourselves amen so when i talk
[12:00] denominationalism please
[12:02] from now on don't you ever think
[12:04] baptists are methodists
[12:06] because we're so far beyond preaching
[12:08] about the woes of baptists and
[12:09] methodists and
[12:10] pentecostals and all that we're talking
[12:12] about the denominationalism right here
[12:15] we're talking about the greatest enemy i
[12:17] got is the one that looks me in the
[12:19] mirror every day
[12:20] the old carnal nature with the old
[12:22] carnal thinking and what's detrimental
[12:24] about denominationalism
[12:25] is it robs the people of their god-given
[12:27] position as sons and daughters of god
[12:30] and it puts them into a system where
[12:32] they need somebody
[12:33] else to do something for them to be able
[12:35] to apprehend the promises of god
[12:37] but that's not god's way amen in this
[12:40] exodus he wanted them to be a peculiar
[12:42] treasure and to himself
[12:43] a holy nation a kingdom of priests
[12:47] amen and when we say that you know me
[12:49] well enough to know we're not doing away
[12:51] with the five full ministry that's god's
[12:53] plan
[12:53] but the ministry is just your brother
[12:57] he's just your brother no different than
[12:59] the song leader or the songwriter or the
[13:01] musician
[13:02] or the deacon or the trustee or anybody
[13:04] else with the spiritual gifts of tongues
[13:06] or interpretation of tongues
[13:08] it doesn't matter amen they're just a
[13:10] brother
[13:11] but inside that brother lays a gift and
[13:14] that gift isn't for the brother
[13:16] the gift is for the assembly so
[13:20] there was all kinds of positions amen in
[13:22] this peculiar nation
[13:23] and they were all there to help one
[13:25] another so we don't ever
[13:27] take a gift and use a gift and a man to
[13:29] promote the man
[13:30] the man is always a brother always
[13:32] always brother benham said if you
[13:34] love me call me brother
[13:38] he never wanted to get and he was the
[13:40] prophet of the age
[13:42] but the prophet of the age is in office
[13:44] and the office is respected and honored
[13:47] but the man is not over over
[13:50] evaluated he's a brother
[13:55] so now we are all
[13:59] in this priesthood
[14:02] and in this peculiar nation you have
[14:05] some that have different jobs
[14:10] five full ministry song leader singer
[14:13] songwriter you know gifts of
[14:15] administration gifts of helps
[14:17] word of knowledge gifts with everybody
[14:19] has different jobs
[14:22] but it doesn't change the fact that it's
[14:23] a holy nation
[14:26] so the problem with denominationalism
[14:29] not out there
[14:31] in here is it robs us of our god-given
[14:35] position
[14:36] and it limits our potential
[14:40] it limits our potential because we start
[14:44] to rely on somebody else to do something
[14:47] for me and that's what god does not want
[14:52] he wants each one of us to take our
[14:54] position because there's a power that
[14:55] comes with taking our position
[14:58] brother branham in the message does god
[15:00] ever change his mind about his word from
[15:02] 1965
[15:03] he said let us bow our heads he's
[15:05] praying
[15:07] dear lord jesus we are assembled again
[15:09] in your name with great
[15:10] expectation for the outpouring of the
[15:12] quickening power of god
[15:15] is that what we want so
[15:18] i read this and i stopped there for a
[15:20] reason because
[15:21] what does brother branham want to happen
[15:24] with the outpouring
[15:26] of the quickening power of god what is
[15:28] he looking for what's the objective what
[15:30] does he want
[15:31] amen does he want ecstatic praise and
[15:33] worship does he want pandemonium to
[15:35] break out in the building
[15:36] what's he looking for with an outpouring
[15:38] of the quickening power of god
[15:40] because when we understand what brother
[15:42] branham when he's expecting and asking
[15:44] for the quickening power of god to come
[15:46] what does he want amen how will he know
[15:48] it comes what's he looking for the
[15:50] quickening power of god to do
[15:52] amen and you'll begin to see it's not
[15:54] what the pentecostals were asking for
[15:56] when they were asking for the quickening
[15:57] power of god they wanted to see people
[16:00] slain in the spirit and dance all around
[16:02] and and break out in ecstatic worship
[16:04] but that's not what brother branham was
[16:06] looking for with the quickening power of
[16:08] god to come
[16:10] he says with great expectation for the
[16:13] outpouring of the quickening power of
[16:14] god
[16:15] to bring us into recognition of our
[16:17] position and place
[16:20] and our responsibilities
[16:22] [Music]
[16:23] are the quickening power amen of god
[16:26] what is the quickening power of god
[16:28] being poured out here today going to do
[16:30] it's going to show us our position and
[16:32] place in our responsibilities
[16:34] the quickening power of god is here to
[16:36] put us
[16:37] in position in recognition of our
[16:40] position
[16:41] because there's power in position amen
[16:43] you can you can get excited in the
[16:45] spirit and dance in the spirit and
[16:46] that's a wonderful thing
[16:48] amen but you can do that and not get in
[16:50] position and have no power
[16:52] and you can feel the power of god fall
[16:55] in a sensational way
[16:56] and we want those things and i like
[16:58] those things and i want more of those
[17:00] myself
[17:01] but just because you felt the power fall
[17:03] doesn't mean it put you in position for
[17:05] power
[17:07] because when the power fell and the
[17:09] power left if it didn't put you in
[17:11] recognition of your position
[17:13] then you now have no power operating in
[17:15] your life yourself then you're hoping
[17:18] for another
[17:20] amen great meeting or another something
[17:22] to happen for another power to pour out
[17:24] because you like the feeling of power
[17:26] pouring out but what god's trying to do
[17:28] is get you to recognize your position
[17:30] in place so that the power can flow
[17:32] through you
[17:33] not just fall on you and lift off of you
[17:35] and fall on you and lift off of you
[17:37] but fall on you to open your eyes to see
[17:40] your position and your place in this
[17:42] hour so that you move into position so
[17:44] that that same power
[17:46] now comes flowing out of you out of your
[17:49] belly shuffle
[17:50] rivers of living water so that the power
[17:53] is not just upon you but the power is
[17:55] flowing through you
[17:56] because you've gotten position and
[17:58] you're connected to the circuit
[18:02] praise be the god let's read this again
[18:09] we are assembled again in your name with
[18:11] great expectation for the outpouring of
[18:12] quickness power of god
[18:14] to bring us into recognition of our
[18:16] position and place
[18:17] and our responsibilities as being a
[18:19] called people separated from the world
[18:22] dedicated to god grant lord tonight that
[18:24] the blessing of god will guide us and
[18:26] direct us in the things we do or say
[18:29] that it might bring honor and glory to
[18:31] your name
[18:32] praise be to god
[18:35] let's turn to revelation chapter one
[18:40] together
[18:54] so
[18:58] revelation chapter 1 we'll start reading
[19:01] from verse 4.
[19:06] john to the seven churches which are in
[19:07] asia grace be unto you in peace from him
[19:10] which is which was
[19:12] and which is to come and from the seven
[19:13] spirits which are before his throne
[19:15] from jesus christ who is the faithful
[19:17] witness and the for
[19:19] and the first begotten of the dead and
[19:20] the prince of the kings of the earth
[19:22] unto him that loved us and washed us
[19:24] from our sins in his own blood
[19:25] and hath made us kings and priests and
[19:27] the god
[19:28] and his father to him be glory and
[19:31] dominion for
[19:32] ever and ever he hath i like that word
[19:37] half you might know what half means
[19:40] already
[19:41] in the past finished already done
[19:45] half made us kings and priests into god
[19:48] let's turn over to revelations chapter
[19:50] 5.
[19:55] i pray that the quickening power of god
[19:56] comes down to
[19:58] so we can recognize our position and
[20:00] place and responsibility tonight
[20:08] let's look at verse 5. revelations
[20:11] revelation 5
[20:12] 5. and one of the elders saith unto me
[20:15] weep not behold the lion of the tribe of
[20:17] judah the root of david
[20:18] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[20:20] loose the seven seals thereof
[20:22] and i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[20:24] throne under the four beasts
[20:25] and in the midst of the elder stood a
[20:27] lamb as it had been slain
[20:28] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[20:30] are the seven spirits of god
[20:32] sent forth unto all the earth and he
[20:35] came and took the book out of the right
[20:36] hand of him that sat upon the throne
[20:39] and when he had taken the book the four
[20:41] beasts and four and twenty elders fell
[20:42] down before the lamb
[20:43] having every one of them harps and
[20:45] golden vials full of odors
[20:47] which are the prayers of the saints and
[20:50] they sung a new song
[20:51] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[20:53] and to open the seals thereof
[20:55] for thou was slain and has redeemed us
[20:56] to god by thy blood
[20:58] out of every kindred and tongue and
[21:00] people and nation
[21:02] and has made us unto our god kings and
[21:04] priests
[21:05] and we shall reign on the earth
[21:08] there's that same hast just like
[21:12] hath hast made us
[21:15] kings and priests and we shall reign up
[21:18] on the earth brother bem said in the
[21:20] church age book
[21:22] out of the revelation of jesus christ
[21:25] and
[21:25] he starts going through these same
[21:27] scriptures we went through revelation 1
[21:28] 6 and he hath made us kings and priests
[21:30] unto god and his father
[21:31] to him be glory and dominion forever and
[21:33] ever amen and he says he hath made us
[21:36] oh there are certain truths we need to
[21:38] emphasize
[21:40] there are certain truths we need to
[21:41] emphasize
[21:43] this is one of them he this is all
[21:45] capital letters in the church
[21:47] he hath made us all capital with
[21:50] estimation points
[21:51] there are certain truths that need to be
[21:52] emphasized he hath made us
[21:55] you didn't make yourself anything
[21:59] you didn't earn it you didn't work to it
[22:00] you didn't go through certain levels of
[22:02] accomplishment and finally that you
[22:03] arrived
[22:04] he hath made us
[22:08] salvation is his doing salvation is of
[22:11] the lord
[22:11] all of grace he redeemed us for a
[22:13] purpose he bought us for a purpose
[22:16] we are kings spiritual kings
[22:19] oh we're going to be kings upon the
[22:21] earth with him when he sits on his
[22:22] throne
[22:23] but now we are spiritual kings and we
[22:26] reign over a spiritual
[22:27] kingdom that is not future tense
[22:31] that's this morning that's you sitting
[22:33] in your seat right now
[22:35] or a spiritual king reigning over a
[22:37] spiritual kingdom
[22:41] but denominationalism will take you from
[22:43] that position
[22:45] and have you waiting for something to
[22:47] happen oh in the millennium won't that
[22:49] be great when we rule and reign with
[22:51] them
[22:51] absolutely there's a physical
[22:53] manifestation coming in the millennial
[22:55] reign when we rule and reign in him and
[22:57] bodies of flesh upon this fleshly earth
[22:59] upon this earth
[23:01] but don't hey don't point me to that
[23:03] amen
[23:05] and neglect to inform me that i'm
[23:07] already
[23:08] a king and a priest and i already
[23:11] am a spiritual king over a spiritual
[23:13] kingdom
[23:14] i'm not waiting for something great to
[23:16] happen something great is happening
[23:19] something great has happened amen and
[23:22] the quickening power of god
[23:23] has brought me into recognition of my
[23:25] place my position
[23:27] and my responsibility
[23:30] i'm not hoping someday to arrive hey
[23:33] friends by by his grace when he arrived
[23:35] i arrived because i was with him amen
[23:39] when he overcame i overcame when he took
[23:42] the keys of death helen the grave
[23:44] i took the keys of death helen the grave
[23:46] because when he was here amen when he
[23:48] was here
[23:49] i was here that's what the prophet of
[23:53] god tells us
[23:54] you were in him when he was conquering
[23:56] you were in him
[23:57] when he was overcoming you were in him
[23:59] when he paid the penalty for sin
[24:01] you were in him amen when he arose and
[24:05] sat on the right hand of the father
[24:06] and you arose with him you were
[24:08] quickened with him
[24:10] and are seated now
[24:14] in heavenly places in christ
[24:18] so we point to the future there's a
[24:20] future there's a manifestation
[24:22] but that manifestation is only an
[24:25] earthly manifestation of what
[24:26] now is in the spiritual realm
[24:30] you have to realize so many times i've
[24:34] said this so much but i don't think i
[24:35] can overemphasize it for myself
[24:37] because i'm trying to break myself out
[24:39] of old habits but we look at the earth
[24:41] amen and we look at what we see and what
[24:43] we hear
[24:44] and we base everything off what we see
[24:47] and what we hear in this dimension
[24:50] our confession sometimes is off what we
[24:52] see in here in this dimension
[24:54] and feel our testimony is based on what
[24:57] we see and what we feel and what we hear
[24:59] in this dimension
[25:01] but this dimension is only a reflection
[25:04] a negative of another one that's a
[25:05] positive
[25:06] and the reality is there amen this is
[25:09] the sub-reality let's say it that way
[25:11] this is the sub-reality the negative or
[25:14] the reflection
[25:15] but we base everything our conduct our
[25:18] speech
[25:18] our reactions is all based on the
[25:20] negative
[25:21] not on the positive but by the grace of
[25:24] god i want to be lifted out of the
[25:26] negative
[25:26] out of the carnal so that my testimony
[25:29] my conduct
[25:30] my conversation everything is based off
[25:33] that pure
[25:34] real revelation from the eternal realm
[25:37] that is the reality not the reflection
[25:40] down here
[25:41] i am not basing my testimony i'm not
[25:44] basing my confidence
[25:46] my confession off the negative but i
[25:48] want to start basing it
[25:50] off the positive
[25:53] why because i'm already healed i'm not
[25:55] hoping to be healed i'm already healed
[25:58] i'm already saved i'm already delivered
[26:00] i'm already raptured
[26:03] hallelujah will there be a manifestation
[26:06] in the negative
[26:06] absolutely will we enjoy it absolutely
[26:09] but how do i know i will enjoy it
[26:11] because i'm enjoying it
[26:12] now
[26:17] it's too much future focus
[26:21] how are you going to get to the future
[26:22] by recognizing your position in that
[26:24] present too much earthly focus
[26:29] how are we gonna how we're gonna change
[26:31] things on earth you won't change them on
[26:33] earth
[26:37] oh how we've wasted so much precious
[26:39] time and energy
[26:41] trying to manipulate the circumstances
[26:44] around us with fleshly efforts
[26:47] how frustrated we become by trying to
[26:50] fix
[26:50] our problems by working harder by trying
[26:54] again by
[26:55] doing better how many times we have
[26:58] wasted our
[26:59] energy and been distracted from our real
[27:01] calling and purpose
[27:02] because we tried to fix things in the
[27:04] flesh and you're never going to fix
[27:06] things in the flesh
[27:07] if you want to fix something in the
[27:08] flesh you fix it in the spirit
[27:11] and when you fix it in the spirit it'll
[27:12] reflect fixed in the flesh
[27:15] [Applause]
[27:17] we've been too earthbound for too long
[27:20] amen
[27:21] there's a difference between chickens
[27:23] and eagles
[27:26] there's a difference the eagle was
[27:28] always an eagle even when it was acting
[27:30] like a chicken
[27:32] when it ate like a chicken walked like a
[27:35] chicken
[27:35] with a chicken perspective and a chicken
[27:37] coop amen it was still an eagle
[27:42] but there come a time that there had to
[27:43] be a quickening power of god
[27:45] to help that eagle recognize its
[27:48] position
[27:49] in place and then it flew above the
[27:52] chicken yard
[27:53] above the earth to gain a whole
[27:55] different perspective
[27:56] and that's when life really began for
[27:58] the eagle that's when everything changed
[28:01] that's when power for overcoming that's
[28:03] when deliverance that's when
[28:04] everything changed for the eagle is when
[28:06] the eagle left the earth and moved into
[28:08] the heavens
[28:11] but the chicken can't make that move
[28:14] they can flap a little bit they can even
[28:16] fly a little bit
[28:18] you know that a chicken can fly a little
[28:20] bit it's pretty pathetic
[28:24] they can fly a little bit and get off
[28:26] the ground just a little bit
[28:27] for just a short distance and fall back
[28:29] to the ground amen sometimes they can
[28:31] flap a little bit and get up on a roost
[28:33] a few feet off the ground and
[28:35] amen but they may feel like they're
[28:37] flying but that's not flying
[28:38] because you still haven't changed your
[28:39] perspective
[28:42] if you go from here to here you say wow
[28:44] i can see so much further
[28:48] the real perspective is going from here
[28:50] to there
[28:53] and that's what the eagles have been
[28:54] called to
[28:56] not a chicken perspective but an ego
[28:59] perspective
[29:00] which changes everything
[29:03] we've been so limited in our
[29:05] understanding
[29:06] so limited in what is real to us
[29:11] that's why sometimes we struggle so much
[29:13] with carnal things
[29:15] we struggle so much with carnal things
[29:17] with worldliness
[29:19] and and we don't know why we struggle so
[29:21] much and the problem is we're struggling
[29:24] because we're still
[29:25] earthbound and we're trying to fix the
[29:28] problem
[29:29] earthbound and we're not going to fix
[29:31] the problem
[29:32] earthbound we're going to have to fix it
[29:34] in the spirit realm
[29:35] first
[29:39] that's why
[29:42] you can you can beat your head against
[29:44] the wall
[29:46] trying to change bad habits trying to
[29:50] overcome sinful things and lustful
[29:52] things and
[29:52] wrong desires i mean you can try and try
[29:55] and try and you can work and work and
[29:57] work
[29:58] and you're going to end up being
[29:59] frustrated at the end of the day some
[30:01] people with a strong will may have some
[30:02] degree of success and overcoming
[30:04] but the real fix is in the spirit realm
[30:07] and when we lift above in the spirit
[30:09] realm and get above these things and the
[30:11] quickening power puts us in our position
[30:14] the earthly things just start taking
[30:16] care of themselves
[30:18] and unless you've been there you don't
[30:20] understand it amen we don't understand
[30:22] how i can no longer ever have a desire
[30:25] for this thing that's plagued me all of
[30:26] my life
[30:27] how is it that the thing that has its
[30:29] hooks in me the hook
[30:30] can just fall off and fall to the ground
[30:32] how can that happen
[30:33] i'm here to tell you it can happen it
[30:35] happened it's happening
[30:37] remember when the eagle begins to fly
[30:39] and gets above the influences of the
[30:41] earth
[30:41] the hold of the earth it starts to lose
[30:44] its hold
[30:45] and things just begin to fall away amen
[30:47] that's why
[30:48] trying to come amen to to your own
[30:51] righteousness before giving in to the
[30:52] spirit of god
[30:53] will never get you in contact with the
[30:56] spirit of god
[30:58] you finally have to come to the point
[30:59] said god would you just come and rescue
[31:02] this creature
[31:02] lift me out of the kernel i can't fix my
[31:05] life
[31:06] i can't fix my problems i can't do
[31:08] better
[31:10] amen what i need is to be lifted into
[31:12] the spirit realm and i need to recognize
[31:15] that you've already made me a king and a
[31:17] priest that i've already got a position
[31:19] that i'm already seated in heavenly
[31:21] places in christ jesus
[31:22] and that revelation and the reality of
[31:25] that in my life
[31:26] will begin to change everything else
[31:30] let me get everything backwards friends
[31:32] he's called us higher
[31:39] amen
[31:43] back to this quote on the church age
[31:45] book
[31:47] but now we are spiritual kings and we
[31:49] reign over a spiritual kingdom
[31:52] romans 5 17 for by one man's offense
[31:55] death reigned by one much more they
[31:57] which receive abundance of grace
[31:59] and if the gift of righteousness shall
[32:00] reign in life by one
[32:02] jesus christ and in colossians 1 13
[32:07] who hath delivered us from the power of
[32:08] darkness and hath translated us

[32:56] christ let me go back and read romans 5
[32:59] 17 again
[33:00] he said much more they which receive
[33:02] abundance of grace and of the gift of
[33:04] righteousness
[33:04] shall reign in life by one jesus christ
[33:10] not a future reigning reigning now

[33:27] spiritual realms spiritual dimensions
[33:29] spiritual things which will have effect
[33:31] on what takes place in the mayor's

[34:38] flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of

[35:42] oh it's a mountain oh there's giants
[35:44] there
[35:45] oh there's walled cities he knew all of
[35:47] that for he asked for his possession
[35:49] amen but it was his possession and it
[35:51] was his authority
[35:53] it was his dominion he was the king of
[35:55] that land
[35:56] he was the priest in that area and it
[35:58] was his job to drive out the inhabitants
[36:03] do you realize he wasn't going and he
[36:05] wasn't asking for help
[36:06] he didn't ask joshua for help
[36:11] amen because we went into the promised
[36:12] land amen it was portioned out to each
[36:14] one
[36:15] amen to rule to have dominion to have
[36:18] lordship

[36:25] you're a holy nation there's no king
[36:28] over you
[36:28] under the joshua commission you're under
[36:30] the headship of the holy ghost
[36:32] and everybody has a right to their land
[36:35] everybody has a right to take their land

[36:43] amen and now quit
[36:44] whining take your land quit complaining
[36:48] recognize your position and move in
[36:51] position
[36:51] because god already made a promise as
[36:54] you move forward
[36:55] i'll put fear before you my fear and
[36:57] then before you
[36:58] i'll drive out the unhappiness i'll send
[37:00] the hornet god will do something
[37:02] but he'll do nothing if they sat there
[37:05] in gilgal and waited for the inhabitants
[37:07] to leave
[37:09] see that that's just the type of what
[37:12] we're supposed to be doing now
[37:14] that's the natural this is the spiritual
[37:16] and we sit around
[37:17] waiting for god to deliver us from
[37:19] things we sit around waiting for my
[37:21] desire
[37:22] to change waiting for habits to change
[37:24] waiting
[37:25] for sinful lustful things to fall off we
[37:27] don't realize he's given you dominion
[37:29] over that
[37:29] you take that land back you run that
[37:32] devil out you
[37:33] conquer that land and you conquer that
[37:34] enemy and you possess your own vessel
[37:37] [Applause]
[37:41] i pray that the quickening power of god
[37:43] comes down right now
[37:44] to help us recognize our position in our
[37:47] place
[37:48] because we're waiting for magical things
[37:50] to happen and it's not
[37:51] magical things that'll happen it's a
[37:53] realization of the real world
[37:55] and our real position in the real world
[37:57] that'll have an effect on this
[37:59] negative reflection
[38:04] i'm tired of my own spiritual laziness
[38:08] i'm tired of my own handicap where i've
[38:10] handicapped myself
[38:12] by wrong thinking
[38:17] how are you going to overcome by
[38:20] overcoming
[38:22] recognizing our position and moving
[38:24] forward he promised to do it for you
[38:26] amen he promised to go before you he
[38:29] promised to be with you
[38:30] he promised that wherever your feet
[38:32] shall tread that i've given to you
[38:34] he's promised it's yours it's already
[38:36] promised it was promised before they
[38:37] left egypt
[38:40] it was promised to us that this is our
[38:42] land that this is our inheritance the
[38:44] full privilege of the full promise of
[38:46] the full word
[38:47] is ours i can have everything that the
[38:50] word promises for me in this day
[38:52] it's already mine amen but i i can't sit
[38:55] around on my heels
[38:56] not doing anything just waiting for
[38:58] something to happen
[38:59] waiting for christ to come down conquer
[39:02] all the land
[39:03] give me the deed and say there i took
[39:05] care of it for you go in and get it
[39:08] he already took care of it
[39:11] it's already deeded in your name
[39:14] and he tells you to go get it
[39:18] because everything is an act of faith
[39:21] everything in the kingdom of god must be
[39:24] done by faith and everything that's
[39:26] apprehended from the kingdom of god
[39:27] must be apprehended by faith
[39:31] and too many times we'll believe after
[39:33] we see something happen
[39:36] when we begin to see things change i'll
[39:39] believe
[39:41] when i begin to see the desires of my
[39:43] flesh change then i'll confess that i'm
[39:45] a son of god
[39:48] then i'll believe that i'm redeemed and
[39:50] redeemable when i see some things
[39:52] changing
[39:53] no i believe it because his word said it
[39:55] there's a witness in my heart that it's
[39:56] the truth amen and i'll confess it no
[39:59] matter
[39:59] what's happening in my life i confess it
[40:02] because it's true
[40:05] and that that is my position my position
[40:09] by the word
[40:10] i am a redeemed son of god
[40:13] that's my position by the word amen when
[40:15] david was put into his position as
[40:18] king of israel he was king of israel
[40:22] it didn't matter what his brothers
[40:23] thought about it god put him in that
[40:25] position
[40:26] and he knew it it didn't matter how many
[40:30] mistakes he made
[40:32] he was still king of israel because god
[40:34] put him in that position
[40:35] it didn't remain it didn't matter how
[40:37] many times his political foes
[40:39] thought he shouldn't be in that position
[40:41] because of the sin and mistakes that he
[40:43] made
[40:43] that made no difference at all god had
[40:45] put him in that position and he was
[40:47] still in that position
[40:48] that was his position and there was
[40:50] power when he was in position
[40:53] and the rest of the nation prospered
[40:55] when david was in his right position
[40:58] peter amen was promised the keys to the
[41:00] kingdom but
[41:01] peter amen was a was a problem
[41:05] peter didn't yet have the new birth and
[41:07] and peter he began to
[41:08] chase chastise the lord and rebuke the
[41:11] lord for saying that he was going to die
[41:13] and and and be taken to jerusalem and
[41:16] killed
[41:16] amen he says far be it from you to let
[41:18] that happen and he was rebuked
[41:20] and and jesus said get thee behind me
[41:22] satan
[41:23] without curse of the things of man and
[41:25] not the things of god
[41:26] guess what he didn't change his mind
[41:29] about peter's position
[41:31] [Music]
[41:32] he didn't change his mind he didn't say
[41:34] oh peter i thought you would have been
[41:36] the guy
[41:37] but now i've got second thoughts because
[41:38] of what just came out of your mouth
[41:40] no peter was still the guy because
[41:42] before the foundation of the world
[41:44] peter was called chosen elected
[41:47] according to
[41:48] his will according to his purpose amen
[41:50] in the works were finished from before
[41:52] the foundation of the world
[41:53] they are already finished he's not
[41:56] changing them
[41:57] peter's going to get the keys peter's
[41:59] going to unlock the gospel to the three
[42:01] people types of the world
[42:02] nobody else is gonna do it peter's the
[42:04] one because peter was the one
[42:06] in the mind of god before the foundation
[42:08] of the world that was called to that
[42:10] position
[42:10] and nothing peter can do can get him out
[42:13] of that position
[42:18] talk about a revelation amen talk about
[42:20] an understanding of our position
[42:21] i pray that the quickening power of god
[42:24] falls in this place today
[42:25] to help us recognize our position and
[42:27] our place and our responsibility
[42:29] because peter he could fail peter could
[42:32] go and repent
[42:33] peter could weep bitterly but peter
[42:35] couldn't lose his position in christ
[42:38] he couldn't lose the keys to the kingdom
[42:41] david couldn't lose
[42:42] amen his throne
[42:47] even when peter was caught up amen when
[42:50] when disciples came from
[42:51] james he went to antioch and he had been
[42:53] eaten with the gentiles but now
[42:55] he plays the part of the hypocrite he
[42:56] gets caught up in the political move of
[42:58] the church and he's rebuked by paul
[43:00] guess what the keys didn't go from peter
[43:02] to paul because paul was writing peter
[43:04] was wrong
[43:06] peter still had him because that was his
[43:08] position
[43:09] paul had his position peter had his
[43:11] position john has his position
[43:15] and by the grace of god you and i have
[43:17] our position
[43:19] nothing's going to move us off of that
[43:21] position friends
[43:24] we can we we can live below our
[43:27] privileges
[43:29] we can allow spiritual amnesia to keep
[43:31] us away from where we're supposed to be
[43:33] but it's not going to change god's
[43:38] position praise be to god
[43:42] i think i'm going to try to finish this
[43:43] quote of the church age book
[43:47] it says right now we reign with christ
[43:49] having dominion over sin the world the
[43:51] flesh and the devil
[43:53] my goodness friends you don't know
[43:56] sometimes we just don't know that right
[43:59] now
[44:01] right now amen right now
[44:05] we reign with christ right now
[44:08] we reign with christ having dominion
[44:13] over sin the world the flesh
[44:17] and the devil
[44:22] that means the devil does not have
[44:24] dominion over you
[44:28] the devil does not have dominion over me
[44:31] but i have dominion over the devil
[44:35] so now we live in satan's eden amen
[44:37] where the devil has absolute control
[44:39] of the whole world absolute control of
[44:42] all of the politics all of the powers
[44:44] everything is tied up in him and he is
[44:46] the head and running the whole show
[44:48] amen so he is the god of this evil age
[44:53] we agree prophet of god said he's the
[44:55] god of this evil age
[44:56] he is the greatest power of the evil age
[44:59] he is the greatest power
[45:00] of all the worldliness and i have
[45:04] dominion over him
[45:05] [Applause]
[45:08] and i have dominion over him what's that
[45:10] tell you about satan's eden amen you're
[45:13] not subject to satan's eden you're not
[45:15] subject to this carnal world and all the
[45:17] powers
[45:18] amen you're only subject to god and his
[45:20] will in your life
[45:21] in this evil age the things he wants to
[45:23] accomplish in your life
[45:24] but you're not under the dominion of the
[45:27] god of this evil age the god of this
[45:29] evil age is
[45:29] under your dominion
[45:33] there's no fear in what the devil's
[45:36] going to do to me
[45:37] there shouldn't be any fear because the
[45:39] devil can only do to me what god allows
[45:42] the devil to do to me
[45:44] and if god allows the devil to make a
[45:46] move against me
[45:47] then god has a predetermined purpose and
[45:51] outcome so that he can get glory so that
[45:53] his word can be made manifest
[45:55] amen but that devil is under our
[45:58] dominion
[46:00] why because we're seated in heavenly
[46:02] places
[46:03] with christ jesus as joint heirs
[46:11] if your seed didn't have any places in
[46:13] christ jesus is a joiner with christ
[46:16] and you're under the minion of the devil
[46:17] christ is under the dominion of the
[46:18] devil
[46:24] are you subject to this world in the
[46:25] flesh you're subject to the will of god
[46:30] in this earthly journey for his
[46:32] glorification
[46:34] and for a testimony of his word
[46:38] but you have dominion over it all
[46:43] dominion over sin the world the flesh
[46:45] and devil i can't get past that sentence
[46:47] that's just such a good one
[46:50] showing forth his brain praise and glory
[46:53] showing forth
[46:55] himself what are you showing forth
[47:00] himself that word himself is all capital
[47:03] letters in the church age book
[47:05] showing forth himself
[47:11] you have dominion you reign with christ
[47:15] right now we reign with christ having
[47:16] dominion over send the world the flesh
[47:18] and the devil
[47:19] showing forth his praise and glory
[47:21] showing forth
[47:23] himself
[47:26] if i got so much dominion why do so many
[47:29] bad things happen to me
[47:31] praise be to god so that he can show
[47:33] that he has dominion through you
[47:36] why does cancer come so cancer can be
[47:38] defeated
[47:40] why do troubles come so troubles can be
[47:42] overcome why do circumstances happen so
[47:45] circumstances can be overcome
[47:47] and then we realize these things happen
[47:49] they're predestinated to happen
[47:52] they're supposed to happen trial and
[47:53] tribulations are here they're supposed
[47:55] to happen
[47:56] they're prophesied to come they're in
[47:58] the scripture that they'll come amen we
[48:00] should expect them to come
[48:02] but when they come we're never under
[48:04] dominion of the devil
[48:05] ever ever ever we're never under
[48:07] dominion of sin
[48:08] we're never under dominion of the world
[48:10] or of the flesh or of the devil
[48:12] we are always reigning with christ and
[48:15] dominion over those things but even when
[48:17] christ was here so that he can glorify
[48:19] his father
[48:20] he subjected himself to the things that
[48:22] his father allowed so that he could
[48:24] overcome
[48:24] each one of them to prove that dominion
[48:27] was inside of him
[48:29] it didn't stop troubles from coming it
[48:32] didn't stop his beard from being ripped
[48:34] out or spit upon his face or hit with
[48:36] the stick amen that's not what this
[48:38] dominion looks like
[48:39] the dominion doesn't look like never a
[48:41] problem never a trial i coast over
[48:43] everything
[48:44] no you may get spit on they may hit you
[48:46] in the head with a stick but you're
[48:48] never under that dominion
[48:49] you're always in control because the
[48:51] control tower is on the inside
[48:53] that situation is not controlling you
[48:55] but he who controls the situation is
[48:57] alive inside of you
[48:58] directing your footsteps so that at some
[49:00] point he can prove
[49:02] who really is the god of this world who
[49:04] really is in control
[49:07] the doctors all line up and tell you one
[49:09] thing amen so that god can prove he
[49:11] knows more than doctors
[49:14] science will tell you there's no way out
[49:16] so that he can come along
[49:17] amen and prove that there's dominion
[49:20] inside of you
[49:21] over science dominion inside of you over
[49:24] virus
[49:25] dominion over cancer dominion over world
[49:28] dominion over sin dominion over the
[49:30] flesh dominion over the devil
[49:32] what's he trying to prove he's trying to
[49:34] show himself
[49:36] in you and how is he going to do it when
[49:40] you're just coasting along cruise
[49:41] control
[49:42] four lane highway no speed limit life is
[49:44] good
[49:47] that's not dominion dominion is proved
[49:50] in the face of obstacle
[49:52] dominion and power is proved in the face
[49:54] of circumstances
[49:58] why do you think it's going to get worse
[49:59] before it gets better for the bride
[50:01] you know all that brother branham said
[50:03] you know everything that's been
[50:04] prophesied
[50:05] should be a hunted persecuted little
[50:07] group they're trying to stop preaching
[50:08] like this they're going to try to shut
[50:10] these churches down
[50:11] and on and on and on the prophet goes we
[50:13] could list quote after quote after quote
[50:15] of what he's talking about and he speaks
[50:18] of in some of the most prominent
[50:19] messages he ever preached like
[50:20] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[50:24] why because the greatest display
[50:27] of christ and the bride will come in the
[50:29] face of the greatest opposition
[50:32] why will the great opposition come to
[50:34] prove who's in her
[50:35] to prove she is him
[50:39] what's he declaring what's he showing
[50:41] forth himself
[50:44] amen why do troubles come so that he can
[50:47] show himself
[50:48] in you there's dominion inside of you
[50:52] there's a there's a king on the throne
[50:55] in you
[50:57] and you're a joint heir sitting on the
[50:58] throne with that king
[51:03] praise be god we're not subject to the
[51:06] devil we're not subject to the world
[51:07] we're not subject to the flesh we're
[51:09] subject to our father
[51:11] and we're subject to his plan before the
[51:14] foundation of the world
[51:15] we have got to let the word of god
[51:18] change our thinking
[51:20] we have got to let what the prophet told
[51:21] us change our thinking
[51:23] amen if anything happens amen it crossed
[51:26] his sacred desk
[51:27] first for his signature of approval amen
[51:29] so if anything comes
[51:31] this is for his purpose and for his
[51:32] glory and it's not to destroy
[51:34] it's too it's not to be destroyed but
[51:37] it's so that he can destroy
[51:42] amen praise be to god
[51:45] so we're never under dominion we're
[51:47] never in defeat we're always in victory
[51:52] we're always in dominion we're always a
[51:54] joint heir
[51:55] we're always ruling and reigning with
[51:57] him
[52:01] praise god showing forth his praise and
[52:05] glory showing forth himself for it is
[52:06] christ in us willing and doing of his
[52:08] good pleasure
[52:09] yes indeed even now we are seated in
[52:11] heavenly places in christ jesus
[52:14] and made us priests yes priests unto him
[52:17] offering the spiritual praise of
[52:19] sanctified lips
[52:21] spending our lives is a sweet offering
[52:23] unto him worshiping him in spirit and
[52:25] in truth interceding and petitioning
[52:30] you realize this is a priesthood
[52:33] there's king we're kings and priests we
[52:36] have dominion
[52:37] over a spiritual kingdom but we are also
[52:40] priests
[52:42] interceding and petitioning
[52:45] priest and kings and to our god no
[52:47] wonder the world does not appeal to us
[52:49] and we are peculiar people
[52:50] zealous unto good works we have been
[52:53] recreated in him to be children like
[52:55] unto our father
[52:56] amen
[52:59] let's go to first peter
[53:02] chapter two
[53:12] first peter chapter 2
[53:19] and verse 9
[53:22] but ye are a chosen generation a royal
[53:26] priesthood
[53:27] a holy nation a peculiar people
[53:30] this sounds like exodus 19 to me
[53:33] you see the similarities what has god
[53:37] always wanted
[53:39] he's always wanted a people a kingdom of
[53:42] kings and priests
[53:43] that's what i always wanted that's what
[53:45] he's getting now
[53:48] you're a chosen generation a royal
[53:50] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[53:52] people
[53:53] that you should show forth the praises
[53:54] of him who hath called you
[53:56] out of darkness into the marvelous
[53:59] light and his marvelous light
[54:04] you are not just a priesthood
[54:09] a royal priesthood
[54:12] not just a priesthood a royal priesthood
[54:16] because we're not after the priesthood
[54:18] that was established on earth through
[54:19] aaron
[54:21] that was an earthly priesthood and if
[54:23] you read the book of hebrews
[54:24] he said jesus didn't come as that kind
[54:26] of priest because that was already
[54:28] established
[54:29] over carnal worldly ordinances in an
[54:31] earthly way
[54:32] had an earthly priesthood he would have
[54:34] never come that way because that was
[54:36] already established
[54:37] but he came after the order of
[54:39] melchizedek
[54:41] and melchizedek is the king of
[54:43] righteousness the king of salem
[54:47] and priest of the most high god so
[54:49] melchizedek
[54:50] is the high priest but what kind of
[54:52] priest a
[54:53] royal priest because he's a king
[54:57] and a priest and we've been called into
[55:00] a
[55:01] royal priesthood so
[55:05] not a priesthood after the order of
[55:07] aaron or
[55:08] earthly amen when jesus was here jesus
[55:11] was not slaying lambs
[55:12] and burning them on the altar he was a
[55:15] high priest he come as a high priest
[55:17] he went back as a high priest amen he
[55:19] was here to make a sacrifice
[55:21] and to take the blood of the sacrifice
[55:23] and not for the earthly things but to
[55:24] purge and cleanse the heavenly amen to
[55:26] set an
[55:27] order away for us
[55:31] but it was after a high priest after the
[55:32] order of melchizedek not
[55:34] earthly but heavenly and royal it was
[55:37] he was a royal high priest and now we
[55:40] are a priest in the order of the royal
[55:42] high priest
[55:43] after the order of melchizedek
[55:46] we have come out of that priesthood
[55:48] that's our priesthood
[55:50] it's eternal and it's heavenly
[55:54] we're kings and priests amen kings and
[55:57] priests
[55:57] kings of a spiritual kingdom and priests
[56:01] over the heavenly realm because the high
[56:03] priest is there
[56:04] and we're after that same order of that
[56:06] high priest
[56:07] we're here as a spiritual priest
[56:12] brother mum said interceding and
[56:14] petitioning
[56:16] let's turn to matthew 9.
[56:28] matthew 9
[56:34] and verse 36
[56:41] but when he saw the multitudes he was
[56:43] moved with compassion on them
[56:45] because they fainted and were scattered
[56:46] abroad as a sheep having no shepherd
[56:49] then saith he unto his disciples the
[56:51] harvest truly
[56:52] harvest truly is plenteous but the
[56:54] laborers are few
[56:56] pray you therefore the lord of the
[56:57] harvest that he will send forth laborers
[57:00] into the harvest here's what brother
[57:03] branham says about the scripture
[57:05] and identified christ of all ages 1964
[57:08] one time standing looking upon the
[57:09] harvest jesus said
[57:11] the harvest is ripe the laborers are few
[57:14] pray the lord of the harvest to send
[57:16] laborers into the harvest and he was the
[57:18] lord of the harvest
[57:20] you have not because you ask not you ask
[57:22] not because you believe not
[57:23] ask abundance that your joys might be
[57:25] full see he's depending on you
[57:27] asking and believing that you receive
[57:31] what you asked for
[57:34] okay he's depending on you asking
[57:38] why because we're a priesthood to make
[57:41] intercession
[57:42] and petitions so we're part of the royal
[57:45] priesthood
[57:46] we're here on earth but we're a part of
[57:48] a heavenly priesthood
[57:50] a spiritual supernatural priesthood here
[57:52] upon the earth
[57:53] amen and we're here for intercession and
[57:56] petitioning
[57:56] and jesus when he looked at his
[57:58] disciples he was the lord of the harvest
[58:00] he saw the condition of the harvest but
[58:02] he wasn't going to move
[58:04] in the harvest until he got the
[58:06] disciples to be
[58:08] joint heirs and partners with him in
[58:10] redemption
[58:12] and he said you pray to the lord of the
[58:15] harvest
[58:15] he was the lord of the harvest see he's
[58:18] setting up something here that's going
[58:20] to make something mean something to us
[58:22] amen he was the lord of the harvest he
[58:24] saw the condition
[58:25] he knew he didn't have to be told what
[58:27] the condition was
[58:28] he didn't have to be told that the
[58:30] harvest is ready and there's not
[58:31] laborers he already knew that
[58:33] but he told them to pray to the lord of
[58:35] the harvest that he'll send laborers
[58:37] into the harvest
[58:38] why because god has so orchestrated his
[58:41] system that he won't do anything without
[58:43] man
[58:45] he put man on partnership with him
[58:48] there's got to be somebody on this earth
[58:50] with a heavenly priesthood
[58:52] a royal priesthood that can intercede
[58:55] amen that can petition
[58:56] god who else on this planet can
[58:59] intercede and petition god
[59:01] who else can cry out and have the ear of
[59:03] god amen and have god move he's looking
[59:06] for a priesthood
[59:07] a royal priesthood amen that's already
[59:10] in their office not coming to an office
[59:14] but in office and we're here to petition
[59:16] we're here to
[59:17] intercede we're here to ask god amen
[59:20] does he not know he already knows
[59:25] daniel began to pray
[59:28] because daniel wanted the revelation and
[59:32] understanding of the 70 weeks 70 years
[59:35] of captivity
[59:36] that jeremiah wrote about and when he
[59:39] begins to pray
[59:41] jeremiah comes at the right time
[59:45] he happens to come to the end of the 70
[59:47] years
[59:49] he's in the right season he's the right
[59:52] person he's a prophet
[59:56] god knows he's there and god knows what
[59:59] date it is
[1:00:04] but when daniel begins to pray heaven
[1:00:07] goes into action
[1:00:09] gabriel says from the first day they
[1:00:12] prayed
[1:00:13] i was sent to thee what happened
[1:00:16] what moved the whole plan of god into
[1:00:19] action
[1:00:19] this was god's plan this is what god
[1:00:21] wanted this was the right time
[1:00:23] it's the right season he's the right
[1:00:25] person and remember what happened
[1:00:26] the right person in the right season
[1:00:28] amen begin to ask the right prayer
[1:00:30] and the right prayer and the right
[1:00:32] season by the right person
[1:00:34] amen put god into action and he sent
[1:00:36] gabriel down
[1:00:38] and what more it started a battle in the
[1:00:40] spiritual realm
[1:00:42] because gabriel there's a whole
[1:00:44] spiritual realm that operates by god's
[1:00:47] laws
[1:00:49] don't ask me to tell you what they are
[1:00:50] because i don't understand but there's a
[1:00:52] law
[1:00:52] there's an order there's a structure
[1:00:54] there's dominion there's
[1:00:56] powers there's principalities
[1:00:59] right because we war not against flesh
[1:01:01] and blood but of powers and
[1:01:02] principalities
[1:01:02] and wickedness in heavenly places we're
[1:01:06] fighting a spiritual battle all the time
[1:01:08] not an earthly battle
[1:01:09] this is not something that's going to be
[1:01:10] won with the gun
[1:01:12] this is not an earthly battle this we're
[1:01:14] fighting
[1:01:15] principalities and powers in heaven in
[1:01:18] the heavens
[1:01:20] and in the heavenly realm there was a a
[1:01:23] a
[1:01:24] a a battle that took place amen when
[1:01:27] gabriel was dispatched and he went
[1:01:28] and the in the prince of persia
[1:01:30] withstood him and won't let him enter
[1:01:32] into his dominion
[1:01:34] you think gabriel an angel from god he
[1:01:37] can't go wherever he wants
[1:01:38] god's got laws god's got lost
[1:01:42] i don't know i can't explain them all to
[1:01:44] you but you can read the scripture and
[1:01:45] see god's got laws
[1:01:48] somehow the the prince of persia
[1:01:52] that demon spirit over persia had a
[1:01:55] right
[1:01:56] to withstand gabriel and gabriel
[1:01:58] couldn't just enter into his territory
[1:02:00] and daniel was under his territory
[1:02:05] but when daniel prayed and he was
[1:02:08] persistent
[1:02:12] took 21 days
[1:02:15] but gabriel had to go back and get
[1:02:17] michael to help him
[1:02:19] and when michael would help him michael
[1:02:21] amen michael was able to overcome
[1:02:23] the the prince of persia and then
[1:02:25] gabriel was able to enter into his
[1:02:27] jurisdiction
[1:02:28] come down into daniel and deliver the
[1:02:30] message of daniel and tell daniel the
[1:02:32] first day you prayed i was
[1:02:34] sent but all this battle broke out
[1:02:37] oh friends do you realize amen it was
[1:02:40] daniel's prayer
[1:02:41] that put heaven in action it was
[1:02:42] daniel's prayer and now heaven's
[1:02:44] moving they're moving into action
[1:02:46] because god said
[1:02:47] now's the time i had somebody on the
[1:02:49] earth to intercede
[1:02:50] i had somebody to petition now i can get
[1:02:52] into action
[1:02:53] because the lord of the harvest needed
[1:02:55] somebody to pray to the lord of the
[1:02:57] harvest that will send laborers into the
[1:02:59] fields
[1:03:00] and when they did now he can get into
[1:03:02] action you realize you have not because
[1:03:04] we ask
[1:03:05] not
[1:03:08] amen and then sometimes things don't
[1:03:11] happen immediately
[1:03:15] because we have no idea what kind of
[1:03:17] spiritual battle is breaking out all
[1:03:19] around us
[1:03:20] we have no idea what power is trying to
[1:03:22] hold dominion and what power is trying
[1:03:24] to break them in
[1:03:25] we have no power in the spirit realm
[1:03:27] what's going on all around us amen but
[1:03:29] we have to
[1:03:30] pray with faith believing knowing our
[1:03:32] position
[1:03:33] knowing we're kings and priests knowing
[1:03:35] that god will move knowing that we have
[1:03:37] access to the throne of god by grace
[1:03:39] knowing that he hears our prayer and
[1:03:41] knowing that he will answer according to
[1:03:42] his word
[1:03:44] and we have to hold on by faith and not
[1:03:47] give up
[1:03:47] amen not what would have happened if
[1:03:49] daniel would have gave him so
[1:03:50] now is probably not the time that's not
[1:03:54] for me to know
[1:03:55] i don't know what would have happened i
[1:03:57] don't know how the story would have went
[1:03:59] you'll never know how the story would
[1:04:00] have went you only know how the story
[1:04:03] was
[1:04:04] but it makes you wonder
[1:04:07] we have to we have to ask
[1:04:11] in faith believing we receive whatever
[1:04:15] we ask for
[1:04:17] that's what the prophet says
[1:04:21] he said he is depending on you asking
[1:04:25] why because you're part of the royal
[1:04:27] priesthood
[1:04:28] to intercede and petition
[1:04:32] he's depending on you asking and
[1:04:33] believing that you receive what you ask
[1:04:35] for
[1:04:36] he's depending on two things you asking
[1:04:39] and you believing
[1:04:41] if you don't ask believing stop asking
[1:04:48] i think sometimes we ask out of habit
[1:04:53] things we shouldn't be asking for
[1:04:57] because we actually don't believe it
[1:04:59] we're just asking out a habit
[1:05:03] like there's been times i've been guilty
[1:05:06] of this
[1:05:07] there's been times somebody is ill
[1:05:10] very ill terminally ill and somebody
[1:05:13] asked to pray for their healing
[1:05:15] and in my heart i feel not to
[1:05:18] that sounds horrible somebody's
[1:05:20] terminally ill don't pray for their
[1:05:21] healing
[1:05:23] but i don't i don't if i don't feel to
[1:05:26] how can you pray the prayer of faith
[1:05:28] pure faith that they'll be healed
[1:05:32] so all you can do is ask for the family
[1:05:34] ask for grace ask for mercy
[1:05:36] ask god to have his way and do it
[1:05:40] because there's so many times that in
[1:05:42] your heart
[1:05:44] you you don't in your heart you don't
[1:05:46] see them raised up and walking around
[1:05:49] and if you don't already see that don't
[1:05:50] ask for it
[1:05:53] i think we pray too many prayers out of
[1:05:55] habit
[1:05:58] first time something happens we just oh
[1:06:00] god take care of this
[1:06:02] i want this and this and this to happen
[1:06:04] but not waiting until
[1:06:05] faith rises up waiting until we have
[1:06:10] that inspiration
[1:06:12] waiting till there's faith and all of a
[1:06:14] sudden we see the word and we see the
[1:06:16] promise and
[1:06:16] something in me says it's now it's mine
[1:06:19] i can have it now
[1:06:20] because the prayer of faith it's the
[1:06:22] prayer of faith
[1:06:23] not just prayer
[1:06:26] and so many times we begin to hinder our
[1:06:29] own faith
[1:06:30] by praying prayers out of tradition and
[1:06:32] habits
[1:06:35] we pray prayers out of tradition and
[1:06:37] habit
[1:06:38] hoping something will change but not
[1:06:40] believing they will
[1:06:42] and if we're really honest with
[1:06:44] ourselves we have all prayed
[1:06:46] prayers of hope not prayers of faith
[1:06:50] and we've prayed prayers out of
[1:06:51] tradition or
[1:06:53] prayers out of sympathy and tradition
[1:06:55] but not really from
[1:06:57] faith in our hearts because if it's
[1:07:00] god's faith he dropped in your heart
[1:07:01] there's no way that won't happen
[1:07:04] if it's god's faith not you but if it's
[1:07:06] god's faith he's dropped into your heart
[1:07:08] a revelation
[1:07:09] of what his plan is in this situation
[1:07:11] amen and you know
[1:07:12] that god dropped that in my heart i've
[1:07:14] been inspired i mean there's no way
[1:07:16] that won't happen i think we shouldn't
[1:07:19] be so quick to pray
[1:07:20] i think sometimes we should be quicker
[1:07:22] to meditate
[1:07:24] and then pray meditate on the word
[1:07:28] meditate on the situation and say god
[1:07:30] would you
[1:07:31] reveal to me what you want done in this
[1:07:33] situation because if you can catch an
[1:07:36] inspiration from the lord
[1:07:37] and you can pray a prayer of faith then
[1:07:39] you can rest your soul
[1:07:40] that god is going to perform what he
[1:07:42] said he's going to perform
[1:07:45] i think we have to realize this is a
[1:07:46] royal priesthood we're not playing
[1:07:48] around
[1:07:48] this isn't a game god has not given us
[1:07:50] his word to toy with and play with
[1:07:52] and human emotion type thing this isn't
[1:07:54] for human emotion this isn't for human
[1:07:57] sympathy
[1:07:57] this is a royal priesthood after the
[1:07:59] order of melchizedek this
[1:08:00] is serious this is real this is powerful
[1:08:04] and i feel like sometimes i have limited
[1:08:07] the power
[1:08:08] because i just go back to praying out of
[1:08:09] a traditional mindset
[1:08:11] oh something bad let's all go to prayer
[1:08:13] instead of saying
[1:08:14] do i feel like they're going to be
[1:08:16] healed do i feel like they'll be
[1:08:18] delivered
[1:08:18] do i feel like god wants this situation
[1:08:20] to end right now
[1:08:25] and we pray so many times with our
[1:08:26] fingers crossed
[1:08:29] i mean you may not actually cross your
[1:08:31] fingers
[1:08:33] but subconsciously we're praying
[1:08:36] hoping it's going to work out hoping and
[1:08:38] that's why you start to hear desperate
[1:08:40] prayers
[1:08:42] oh god please please please oh god
[1:08:45] is that a prayer of faith
[1:08:48] is that a prayer of faith oh god please
[1:08:52] please that's not a prayer of faith
[1:08:56] but a prayer of his god i see in your
[1:08:57] word
[1:08:59] and i know who i am and i believe in my
[1:09:02] heart
[1:09:03] that you're going to fulfill this word
[1:09:05] and this is going to come to pass
[1:09:07] and i'm asking you lord as a son of god
[1:09:09] to move in this situation and do
[1:09:11] according to your word
[1:09:13] that's a different kind of prayer
[1:09:14] friends that's the prayer that gets
[1:09:16] results
[1:09:17] it's the prayer of faith he's depending
[1:09:19] on you to ask and to believe
[1:09:23] i think sometimes we'd be better off not
[1:09:25] praying so quickly
[1:09:27] and spend some time meditating find the
[1:09:31] mind of god
[1:09:33] and then pray
[1:09:36] that's a different way of thinking isn't
[1:09:37] it friends
[1:09:39] but we're kings and priests we're not
[1:09:42] just
[1:09:43] denominational people
[1:09:46] we're not just people hoping things are
[1:09:48] going to work out that's not who we are
[1:09:50] we're the children of god we are sons
[1:09:53] and daughters of a living god
[1:09:55] with a real spiritual heritage and a
[1:09:57] reality
[1:09:59] amen we need not to handle it like it's
[1:10:02] a vapor it's a myth
[1:10:03] sometimes it works and sometimes it
[1:10:05] doesn't
[1:10:09] i don't want that kind of experience in
[1:10:11] my life sometimes it works sometimes it
[1:10:12] doesn't
[1:10:14] i want to meditate in the lord and be
[1:10:16] moved by inspiration of the holy ghost
[1:10:18] and be moved by revelation that when i
[1:10:20] pray i pray with earnest faith i know
[1:10:22] god's going to move because i feel
[1:10:23] inspired to pray for this i feel
[1:10:25] moved by the holy ghost i feel like this
[1:10:27] is the time this is the season this is
[1:10:29] the word
[1:10:30] and i'm moving out of an abundance of
[1:10:31] faith in my heart not
[1:10:33] hoping something will work out
[1:10:36] praise be to god that's good preaching
[1:10:41] even if it makes us all feel a little
[1:10:42] rough on the inside you know brother man
[1:10:44] we come to the end of preaching he goes
[1:10:46] oh i feel all scoured out inside i tell
[1:10:48] you this kind of preaching will make you
[1:10:49] say oh
[1:10:50] that i've done bad a lot oh
[1:10:54] god forgive me but praise be to god he's
[1:10:56] bringing the reality of his word
[1:10:58] so that we can operate in real realms of
[1:11:00] faith not pretend realms of faith
[1:11:02] not denominational hope so but real
[1:11:04] legitimate faith on the word of god so
[1:11:07] that our faith has a resting place on
[1:11:09] the revelation of his word
[1:11:10] knowing that there's a foundation to
[1:11:12] what we're asking for and god will build
[1:11:14] on that foundation
[1:11:16] amen then you can be like abraham
[1:11:18] calling those things that are not
[1:11:20] and those things that are as though
[1:11:21] they're not then you can start to see
[1:11:24] for the unseen and know that god's
[1:11:25] moving
[1:11:26] angels are moving something's in action
[1:11:28] war is breaking out in heaven
[1:11:29] something's moving because i prayed the
[1:11:31] prayer of faith not the prayer of hope
[1:11:33] so
[1:11:35] then the devil's not going to come and
[1:11:37] get you to doubt your confession
[1:11:39] get you to doubt what you just said
[1:11:40] because you waited for an inspiration of
[1:11:42] the holy ghost
[1:11:43] and you moved by the spirit of god into
[1:11:45] asking god
[1:11:47] this is a royal priesthood friends amen
[1:11:51] praise god
[1:11:53] that's the kind of life i want to live a
[1:11:55] life led by god a
[1:11:56] life based on revelation
[1:12:00] amen brother graham said in the message
[1:12:04] perseverance
[1:12:05] our heavenly father thou knowest the
[1:12:07] needs before we even ask
[1:12:09] is that true then why ask
[1:12:13] because he said to you because he needs
[1:12:15] a priesthood
[1:12:16] for intercession and petitioning
[1:12:21] you know he needs a royal priesthood and
[1:12:25] there's a royal priesthood
[1:12:27] it's a spiritual world priesthood here
[1:12:29] on earth
[1:12:30] for intercession and petitioning so
[1:12:33] where is intercession found
[1:12:37] in the royal priesthood it's the high
[1:12:40] priest
[1:12:41] inside the priests that is interceding
[1:12:45] that's where intercession is found
[1:12:48] because when the bride goes up the
[1:12:49] spirit goes up and now there's no more
[1:12:51] intercession
[1:12:55] so this isn't a trivial thing friends
[1:12:57] this is power this is real power of god
[1:13:00] in action
[1:13:00] in a mini-membered bride this is the
[1:13:02] reality because when this many many
[1:13:04] bride
[1:13:05] member bride is called off of this earth
[1:13:07] there is no more intercession
[1:13:09] there is no more change there is no more
[1:13:11] blood
[1:13:16] so what's it attached to
[1:13:20] the priesthood the priesthood after the
[1:13:22] order of melchizedek is what it's
[1:13:24] attached to
[1:13:28] he said our heavenly father thou knowest
[1:13:29] the needs before we ask jesus taught us
[1:13:32] that your father knows what you have
[1:13:33] need of before you ask
[1:13:35] but yet we're we are told we are to ask
[1:13:39] when he looked upon the harvest he was
[1:13:40] the lord of the harvest and he said the
[1:13:42] harvest is ripe the laborers are few
[1:13:44] pray you the lord of the harvest that he
[1:13:45] will may send laborers into the harvest
[1:13:47] making himself with man so bound
[1:13:49] together that he works only through the
[1:13:51] agency of man
[1:13:54] he chose man to work for him he could
[1:13:56] have chose the son to preach the gospel
[1:13:58] he could have chose the winds or the
[1:13:59] trees or the stars
[1:14:00] but he chose man veils himself inside
[1:14:04] hides himself from the unbeliever
[1:14:06] reveals himself to who he will
[1:14:09] who is it it's the high priest inside
[1:14:12] the priest
[1:14:14] it's the priesthood of melchizedek it's
[1:14:16] the melchizedek that has come
[1:14:18] down in that cloud that's why brother
[1:14:20] brennan said who is this melchizedek
[1:14:22] not who was who is it's the melchizedek
[1:14:25] priesthood that's come down
[1:14:26] the high priest has come down and where
[1:14:29] is the high priest
[1:14:30] inside the priesthood it's the same
[1:14:32] priesthood now in a mini-membered body
[1:14:35] now it's him in us amen not our mind
[1:14:38] but the quickening power that has
[1:14:39] quickened that seed to life which is
[1:14:41] part of him
[1:14:43] all to manifest him not to play around
[1:14:46] with things but to have the real thing
[1:14:50] that's what we want friends is the real
[1:14:51] thing
[1:14:53] i it doesn't matter to me if i go years
[1:14:56] between prayer requests
[1:14:57] as long as i can pray by faith and when
[1:14:59] i pray by faith he does exactly what his
[1:15:02] word says
[1:15:02] amen that's enough for me amen i know
[1:15:05] i'm tired of just
[1:15:06] salting out and sprinkling out a bunch
[1:15:08] of prayers and hoping that the abundance
[1:15:10] of prayers will bring back a few answers
[1:15:12] [Applause]
[1:15:13] but it's got to be the prayer of faith
[1:15:15] it's got to be the reality
[1:15:16] it's got to be the high priest and the
[1:15:18] priest making intercession and
[1:15:20] petitioning
[1:15:21] no more denominational ideas no more
[1:15:23] traditional approaches
[1:15:24] no more human mind involved but the mind
[1:15:27] of christ and waiting and meditating to
[1:15:29] be put in action
[1:15:30] amen until he says pray
[1:15:34] till he says you ask
[1:15:38] praise be to god amen
[1:15:42] who was it that come down that day amen
[1:15:44] and stood to his feet and said
[1:15:46] howdy right you whatever you say you ask
[1:15:49] amen now she could ask by faith amen
[1:15:52] that wasn't the prophet that was god and
[1:15:54] the prophet
[1:15:56] and when he come to her and said now
[1:15:58] it's time for you to ask
[1:15:59] and whatever you ask it'll be
[1:16:04] praise be to god we need that same thing
[1:16:06] to take place in our hearts right now
[1:16:08] not for brother brethren to come back
[1:16:10] and tell us but the one who was actually
[1:16:11] speaking that day
[1:16:12] to speak into our hearts and say now
[1:16:14] it's time to ask that is your promise
[1:16:17] you don't have to put up with that that
[1:16:18] you've got dominion over that
[1:16:20] now's the time to conquer
[1:16:24] what is preeminence it's the bride under
[1:16:26] control
[1:16:27] total complete control
[1:16:33] i'm ashamed at my whiny prayers
[1:16:38] i have become ashamed at the way i talk
[1:16:42] to god
[1:16:44] i have become ashamed at that my wife my
[1:16:47] whining
[1:16:48] am i complaining but by the grace of god
[1:16:51] he's lifting us out of the carnal into
[1:16:53] the spiritual
[1:16:54] to see our position our place
[1:16:57] our position and our responsibility so
[1:17:00] that we're not whining
[1:17:01] we're not complaining we're not
[1:17:03] grumbling we're seeking the mind of god
[1:17:05] god i'm here i'm here for a fresh
[1:17:07] download from you
[1:17:08] i'm here this is the situation what do
[1:17:11] you want done in this situation
[1:17:14] god i'm looking to you your word says
[1:17:16] this inspiration comes
[1:17:17] god i believe by faith amen according to
[1:17:20] the promise in your word you're going to
[1:17:21] do this
[1:17:23] brother ben said if you don't come
[1:17:24] believing don't even come in the prayer
[1:17:26] line
[1:17:28] now you know the word you know bias
[1:17:30] stripes you're healed you can say it
[1:17:31] over and over and over again and it's
[1:17:33] every bit the truth every time you say
[1:17:35] it
[1:17:35] but if it's not faith in your heart he
[1:17:37] said don't even come through the prayer
[1:17:38] line
[1:17:40] because it's not the words that are
[1:17:41] spoken but it's the faith in the heart
[1:17:46] [Music]
[1:17:48] praise be to god god let us operate in
[1:17:51] the realms of
[1:17:52] reality the true reality
[1:17:59] he says in the end time sign seed 1962
[1:18:03] then you say well jesus healed the sick
[1:18:05] he is the word he is the word
[1:18:07] when you receive the word you receive
[1:18:10] jesus
[1:18:10] for he is the word amen how do you
[1:18:14] receive jesus
[1:18:16] receive the word
[1:18:22] he says the word was made flesh and one
[1:18:24] among us we believe that don't we
[1:18:26] every bit we believe that christ is
[1:18:28] god's word made manifest
[1:18:30] and we believe that his bride must be
[1:18:31] the same thing
[1:18:33] so what's his bride god's word made
[1:18:38] manifest
[1:18:40] we believe that she must believe every
[1:18:42] bit of the word and have that word
[1:18:44] in her because she is part of the body
[1:18:48] she is the body where he is the head
[1:18:52] and when he died and rose from the dead
[1:18:54] and resurrected and set on high
[1:18:56] by the majesty of god on his throne
[1:18:58] right hand of majesty
[1:18:59] then we are his delegates and we reckon
[1:19:02] ourselves dead and buried by baptism
[1:19:04] raised with him and now seated together
[1:19:05] with him in heavenly places
[1:19:07] in christ jesus that get us off shouting
[1:19:10] wouldn't it
[1:19:10] think of that we are not will be
[1:19:15] we are now
[1:19:18] now we are the sons of god now we are
[1:19:21] daughters of god
[1:19:22] not we will be seated now we are
[1:19:25] seated that's the revelation we have to
[1:19:28] keep
[1:19:28] we have to keep in our mind we are now
[1:19:31] kings and priests we are now sons and
[1:19:33] daughters of god
[1:19:34] we are now seated in heavenly places i
[1:19:36] don't have to hope anything's going to
[1:19:37] work out i don't have to try anything
[1:19:39] out i just have to patiently wait
[1:19:41] on the move of god to move in my life
[1:19:42] because it will absolutely work because
[1:19:44] i am now
[1:19:45] in that position i'm not hoping to move
[1:19:47] in that position and i'm not hoping
[1:19:49] through good conduct
[1:19:50] i'm not hoping that somehow through a
[1:19:52] righteous life or
[1:19:53] or through more uh more dedication and
[1:19:56] more this i move into more of that i am
[1:19:58] already now i'm not working my way into
[1:20:02] it to where someday i can say
[1:20:03] now i'm arrived now i'm operating as a
[1:20:05] son of god i am a son of god
[1:20:07] now i am seated in heavenly places now
[1:20:10] amen i
[1:20:11] am now kings and priests
[1:20:16] praise be to god
[1:20:20] but listen to this quote possessing all
[1:20:24] things 1962
[1:20:28] yet abraham had a right to the promise
[1:20:31] and the promise was his
[1:20:33] yeti he had to fight to possess it amen
[1:20:36] oh praise be to god friends
[1:20:42] the promise was his the land was
[1:20:46] theirs but they had to fight to possess
[1:20:49] it
[1:20:50] the promise is ours how we going to get
[1:20:53] it
[1:20:54] any differently than any other child of
[1:20:55] god ever got it anywhere else in the
[1:20:57] bible
[1:20:58] we have the whole bible as our example
[1:21:00] and this whole bible is to be fleshed
[1:21:02] out in our day
[1:21:02] amen and every time the promise came to
[1:21:04] pass tell me how it came to pass
[1:21:06] was it easy amen was it through no
[1:21:08] difficulty no trial
[1:21:09] no tribulation no difficult
[1:21:11] circumstances but the promise was always
[1:21:13] acquired
[1:21:14] every child of god had to fight for it
[1:21:16] they had to hold their position they had
[1:21:18] to stand in faith they had to be patient
[1:21:20] they had to endure to the end
[1:21:21] they had to apply all the
[1:21:23] characteristics of the nature of god
[1:21:25] amen in order to apprehend that prize
[1:21:28] amen it didn't come easy it didn't come
[1:21:31] free it didn't come
[1:21:32] cheap amen but it always came because it
[1:21:34] was a promise of god
[1:21:36] and the ones that had faith were willing
[1:21:37] to endure to the end the ones that had
[1:21:39] faith were willing to be mocked
[1:21:40] ridiculed chastised
[1:21:42] they were willing to be rejected they
[1:21:44] were willing to be persecuted
[1:21:45] because they knew that was their promise
[1:21:47] and they knew that it would come to pass
[1:21:50] abraham wasn't hoping
[1:21:56] the three children in the fire furnace
[1:21:58] weren't hoping
[1:22:01] they said he's able but if he doesn't
[1:22:04] don't matter to me
[1:22:06] i know who i am they weren't hoping they
[1:22:09] were right they knew they were right
[1:22:13] praise be to god
[1:22:16] we can't be walking around this earth
[1:22:18] hoping we're children of god
[1:22:20] hoping i'm part of the bride hoping that
[1:22:22] someday i'll make it
[1:22:24] that's all got to vanish away that's
[1:22:26] never going to apprehend the promise
[1:22:28] there's going to be no translation of
[1:22:29] the body hoping we're bride
[1:22:32] hoping we're a child of god that's not
[1:22:34] going to get it done
[1:22:35] friends it's got to be something real
[1:22:38] something that's solid
[1:22:39] something that's true
[1:22:44] he said there you are the believer today
[1:22:47] yet we're heir to all things
[1:22:50] yet we're heir to every spiritual
[1:22:53] blessing
[1:22:54] every physical blessing every blessing
[1:22:56] the bible promises
[1:22:58] yet you have to fight every inch of it
[1:23:04] that's the way god has set it up amen
[1:23:07] oh we're not going to change it that's
[1:23:09] the way god set it up
[1:23:11] it's always been that way you have to
[1:23:13] fight to possess what you know
[1:23:15] is your own see you can't
[1:23:19] hope it's your own you'll never stick
[1:23:21] through the fight
[1:23:22] you'll never endure to the end remember
[1:23:25] the scripture says he that endure to the
[1:23:26] end
[1:23:27] shall be saved so in order to endure to
[1:23:29] the end you must
[1:23:30] already know you're saved not hoping you
[1:23:32] can endure to the end to find out
[1:23:34] whether you're saved or not
[1:23:35] you'll never endure to the end hope
[1:23:38] won't endure to the end
[1:23:40] faith will so it's it's not he that says
[1:23:44] anything or
[1:23:44] he that runs a little piece or acts a
[1:23:47] little way but he that endureth to the
[1:23:49] end
[1:23:51] what will get you to the end a
[1:23:53] revelation of who you are
[1:23:55] now and what god has for you now and
[1:23:58] walking in that
[1:23:59] reality down regardless of the
[1:24:01] circumstances
[1:24:02] will give you endurance to the end
[1:24:08] it's always been that way you have to
[1:24:10] fight to possess what you know as your
[1:24:12] own
[1:24:12] you have to fight to possess it and
[1:24:14] that's what we have to
[1:24:16] do now first we have to
[1:24:19] catch a revelation that it's ours
[1:24:22] first don't launch our hope you won't
[1:24:25] endure
[1:24:25] and you'll give up the fight you have to
[1:24:29] know it's yours
[1:24:31] and you have to know that you can win
[1:24:36] oh the secret to winning the fight is
[1:24:39] knowing you can win the fight
[1:24:41] because it doesn't mean that you don't
[1:24:43] get knocked down you don't get tossed
[1:24:44] around you don't lose a few battles but
[1:24:46] you have to already believe you won
[1:24:50] you say brother branham i need healing
[1:24:52] the promise is yours
[1:24:54] does anybody need healing in here today
[1:24:58] take this to heart the promise is
[1:25:01] yours can you believe that by faith as a
[1:25:04] child of god
[1:25:05] do you believe that that's yours that's
[1:25:06] your promise i am a royal seed of
[1:25:09] abraham
[1:25:10] i am heir to every promise it's mine
[1:25:15] that's a good starting point the promise
[1:25:18] is yours
[1:25:19] but if you ever get it you ain't going
[1:25:21] to get it easy
[1:25:24] i'm going to tell you that you're going
[1:25:25] to have to take it away
[1:25:27] from satan amen
[1:25:30] you need healing i mean that's why these
[1:25:33] these little frivolous prayers oh god
[1:25:37] and then it doesn't work out oh yeah i
[1:25:39] guess it didn't work out
[1:25:42] he said you're going to fight for it you
[1:25:45] believe it's yours
[1:25:46] you're already healed you've got to
[1:25:48] fight for it you've got to
[1:25:50] take it from satan
[1:25:54] you know what that means he's not going
[1:25:55] to walk up to you and put that little
[1:25:57] that little sickness in a nice little
[1:25:59] package put a bow in and say here it's

[1:27:08] lay it down amen
[1:27:10] [Applause]
[1:27:12] to guess that let's go through that
[1:27:13] recipe again because that's a nice
[1:27:14] recipe for success
[1:27:17] satan cannot hold it if you go to him
[1:27:20] in the scriptural authoritative word
[1:27:23] with faith to say it's mine and lay it
[1:27:26] down
[1:27:27] amen you got to have
[1:27:30] the right word and you got to have the
[1:27:33] right faith
[1:27:40] remember i said in the message to
[1:27:41] patriarch abraham
[1:27:44] after 2 000 years has passed 2000 years
[1:27:48] and still
[1:27:49] here he is in our midst the mighty
[1:27:50] conqueror that rent the veil in two
[1:27:52] that took every sickness every disease
[1:27:54] everything upon himself and bore our
[1:27:56] infirmities to the cross
[1:27:57] and our sickness and our diseases and
[1:27:59] triumphed over them
[1:28:00] and raised up for our justification and
[1:28:03] stands alive after 2 000 years
[1:28:05] to manifest himself as a living jesus
[1:28:08] christ
[1:28:09] amongst the royal seed of abraham who
[1:28:11] are heirs of all things
[1:28:13] you keep catching that statement heirs
[1:28:15] of all things
[1:28:18] he fell heir to everything and you're a
[1:28:20] joint heir
[1:28:22] you're the royal seed of abraham heirs
[1:28:25] of all things oh my
[1:28:26] those who after goes through the test
[1:28:30] promise of the word if you can believe
[1:28:32] the word then you are
[1:28:33] also the seed of abraham how do you know
[1:28:36] your seed of abraham
[1:28:37] if you can believe the word boy he made
[1:28:40] that simple didn't he
[1:28:42] if you can believe the word then you're
[1:28:44] also the seed of abraham
[1:28:45] that's how you come to it if you can't
[1:28:48] take the word test
[1:28:50] then if you doubt it little suspicious
[1:28:52] of it you can't hardly believe it
[1:28:53] there is something other you can't
[1:28:55] believe it then don't you come in the
[1:28:57] prayer line
[1:29:04] see what happens let's just take this
[1:29:06] for example
[1:29:07] if you come in the prayer line with that
[1:29:08] little suspicion that little doubt that
[1:29:10] little uncertainty
[1:29:12] you're hoping that the faith of those in
[1:29:15] the prayer line that lay hands on me is
[1:29:17] greater than my faith
[1:29:20] you're hoping and depending in another
[1:29:23] person's faith
[1:29:28] and we put ourselves right back in
[1:29:30] bondage of denominationalism again
[1:29:33] instead of going through the prayer line
[1:29:35] with my own faith
[1:29:36] has nothing to do with them god spoke to
[1:29:38] my heart if i walk through this i'll be
[1:29:40] healed
[1:29:41] you tell me if i walk up here and if i
[1:29:42] walk up here and have the pastor lay
[1:29:44] hands on me if i have the elders and
[1:29:46] nobody
[1:29:46] i'll be healed then you're not depending
[1:29:48] on the preacher's hands
[1:29:50] [Applause]
[1:29:51] you're not depending on anybody else
[1:29:53] you've got a promise in the word
[1:29:54] and it's quick and alive in your heart
[1:29:56] and you're moving by the faith that god
[1:29:58] has given you
[1:29:59] in that word and it'll bring it to pass
[1:30:03] not bring ourselves under bondage hoping
[1:30:05] somebody else can believe for me
[1:30:11] sometimes i really think sometimes
[1:30:14] that's the reason
[1:30:16] that we panic and go into
[1:30:19] calling a bunch of people and asking a
[1:30:20] bunch of people to pray for us
[1:30:23] now there's an agreement in prayer
[1:30:25] there's nothing wrong with that if you
[1:30:26] move in your heart say
[1:30:27] i'd like a few brothers to agree with me
[1:30:28] in prayer on a specific thing
[1:30:30] that is wonderful if god moves on your
[1:30:32] heart you can agree in prayer on
[1:30:33] something
[1:30:34] but you see some people they start
[1:30:36] calling a bunch of people to pray and
[1:30:37] ask everybody you know to pray
[1:30:38] it's based solely on fear
[1:30:42] they're afraid and if i can get enough
[1:30:44] people praying
[1:30:46] god surely will hear but that's not
[1:30:49] action wasn't taken by faith it was
[1:30:51] taken by fear and anxiety and worry
[1:30:54] so it's different when you say i really
[1:30:56] feel like god's going to move in this
[1:30:58] situation
[1:30:59] and i feel like calling my brothers
[1:31:00] together to pray with me for that they
[1:31:02] if that's where your faith is god will
[1:31:04] move that's right but it's done by
[1:31:07] faith not by fear
[1:31:11] we are sons of god amen you are sons and
[1:31:15] daughters of god
[1:31:16] you are kings and priests now
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:24] it goes on to say
[1:31:28] if you can't believe it then don't come
[1:31:29] in the prayer line i wouldn't even fool
[1:31:31] around the altar until you can get
[1:31:32] enough grace to know that god's word is
[1:31:34] true
[1:31:37] that's why people come to the altar get
[1:31:40] saved next year come to the altar
[1:31:42] get saved next year come to the altar
[1:31:44] get saved
[1:31:47] go do something they didn't think was
[1:31:48] right come and get saved
[1:31:50] you don't have to get saved multiple
[1:31:51] times
[1:31:54] having to get saved again means that you
[1:31:57] never had faith and salvation to begin
[1:31:59] with
[1:31:59] you never even knew what salvation was
[1:32:04] you don't get saved two or three times
[1:32:07] you can backslide and repent
[1:32:11] but you don't have to get saved multiple
[1:32:12] times
[1:32:15] i wouldn't even fool around the altar
[1:32:17] until you can get enough grace to know
[1:32:18] that god's word is true
[1:32:20] and when you once break through that
[1:32:22] veil of unbelief then you got the keys
[1:32:24] in your hands
[1:32:27] what keys the keys in your hands of
[1:32:29] death hell
[1:32:30] and the grave because you've got to
[1:32:32] conquer who conquered for you
[1:32:35] then you've got hebrews 13
[1:32:38] 8 that tells us jesus christ the same
[1:32:40] yesterday today and forever
[1:32:41] how can we do it the people to say oh
[1:32:43] well it'll tell you it's a certain way
[1:32:45] he is
[1:32:46] he is the same the bible said oh well he
[1:32:48] doesn't do today like he did
[1:32:50] we find it right now when we see his
[1:32:52] word vindicated
[1:32:53] what does it do it throws it right back
[1:32:55] into their lap again amen
[1:32:57] the real seed of abraham believes it
[1:32:59] they know it and he stands tonight
[1:33:02] as he met abraham up there on the days
[1:33:04] of lot and performed those miracles
[1:33:06] as he did by telling sarah what she said
[1:33:08] behind him jesus promised the royal seat
[1:33:10] of abraham
[1:33:11] that the church would see that same
[1:33:12] thing just before his coming
[1:33:14] what is it it's got to happen god
[1:33:16] promised it jesus christ confirmed it
[1:33:18] and said it would be so
[1:33:19] and here we are today after 2 000 years
[1:33:23] see him in our midst still the mighty
[1:33:25] conqueror he conquered death
[1:33:27] hell grave all superstition took the
[1:33:29] word
[1:33:30] yes he said if if ye abide in me in my
[1:33:33] words and you
[1:33:34] ask what you will and it shall be given
[1:33:36] to you what was it
[1:33:38] the word christ that's in your heart
[1:33:41] if you abide in me my word abide in you
[1:33:43] then you've conquered
[1:33:45] everything look at this
[1:33:49] if you abide in me and my word abide in
[1:33:52] you
[1:33:53] then you've conquered everything
[1:33:56] you're not hoping to conquer you've
[1:33:58] already conquered
[1:34:00] then you've conquered everything because
[1:34:02] i conquered it for you
[1:34:04] if you abide in me listen to this
[1:34:08] if you abide in me if you can understand
[1:34:12] me
[1:34:16] what does it mean to abide in him you
[1:34:18] have to have a revelation of who he is
[1:34:21] you have to understand him and
[1:34:23] understand his ways
[1:34:25] abiding in him is not believing one day
[1:34:27] and not believing the next day
[1:34:29] abiding in the in him is understanding
[1:34:31] who he is
[1:34:34] if you abide to me if you can understand
[1:34:36] me if you can abide in me
[1:34:38] he that believeth me that receiveth me
[1:34:41] not just make believe but can receive
[1:34:43] he that heareth my words understandeth
[1:34:46] my words
[1:34:47] you realize this is based off revelation
[1:34:50] not just hearing a word and being able
[1:34:51] to repeat it but actually understand
[1:34:54] what the word means what the words say
[1:34:57] actually
[1:34:57] see the picture of the bible
[1:35:01] he that hears my words understandeth my
[1:35:04] words and believes on him that sent me
[1:35:06] has everlasting life and shall not come
[1:35:08] into temptation or condemnation
[1:35:10] but is passed from death into life here
[1:35:12] he is the mighty conqueror
[1:35:16] praise god we'll look at one more quote
[1:35:19] before we wrap
[1:35:20] up in return in jubilee 1962 right at
[1:35:24] the end of 1962
[1:35:25] he preaches message returning jubilee he
[1:35:27] said now if someone or other the
[1:35:29] individual lost their inheritance
[1:35:31] he's talking about the law of jubilee
[1:35:34] and we know that after seven years in
[1:35:36] israel every seven years
[1:35:38] if if somebody had sold them as
[1:35:39] israelites sold themselves into slavery
[1:35:42] every seven years there's a release of
[1:35:43] the slave to go free
[1:35:46] but after seven years or seven cycles of
[1:35:49] seven years
[1:35:50] or 49 years are complete the next year
[1:35:53] brings you to the 50th year
[1:35:54] or the year of jubilee jubilee means 50.
[1:35:58] and in the year of jubilee not just the
[1:36:00] prisoner can go free
[1:36:02] but everything that belongs to him is
[1:36:05] restored back to him
[1:36:07] so jubilee is not just going free
[1:36:09] jubilee is not just understanding i'm
[1:36:11] saved
[1:36:12] amen jubilee is different than just
[1:36:14] knowing you're saved and not in bondage
[1:36:15] anymore
[1:36:16] jubilee is understanding you're back in
[1:36:18] position with everything that belongs to
[1:36:20] you has come back to you
[1:36:22] jubilee is redemption
[1:36:24] [Applause]
[1:36:25] it's more than just released through the
[1:36:27] church ages there was a release
[1:36:29] through seven church ages released
[1:36:30] release release release of those that
[1:36:32] were in bondage
[1:36:33] but at the end of the church ages amen
[1:36:35] we come to a jubilee time and when we
[1:36:37] come to jubilee amen it's time
[1:36:39] not just for the prisoner to go free but
[1:36:42] everything that belongs to him is going
[1:36:45] to be restored back to him
[1:36:46] amen his his revelation his
[1:36:50] understanding his life amen his eternal
[1:36:52] life everything is coming back
[1:36:56] everything that adam lost is going to be
[1:36:58] restored to man amen
[1:37:01] it's not just a release it's a restoring
[1:37:04] back
[1:37:05] it's redemption now someone or the other
[1:37:09] individual lost their inheritance that
[1:37:10] was given to them by god
[1:37:12] there came a year called the jubilee
[1:37:13] year
[1:37:15] that was every seven years they had a
[1:37:17] rest a sabbath every seven days they had
[1:37:19] a sabbath every seven years they had a
[1:37:21] sabbath
[1:37:22] and seven sabbath was 49 years and the
[1:37:24] 50th year was a jubilee
[1:37:26] and in this jubilee every man that had
[1:37:28] lost his inheritance by some means
[1:37:31] if he was a freeborn and a true blooded
[1:37:33] israelite
[1:37:35] amen are you a true blooded child of god
[1:37:39] not a hybridized something or another
[1:37:41] but you came from god
[1:37:43] you come from the loins of god you're a
[1:37:45] true born
[1:37:46] son you realize when
[1:37:49] when i talk about kings and priests if
[1:37:52] you just go back and look at israel
[1:37:54] because that's always the type the
[1:37:55] natural type to be a priest
[1:38:00] you had to be in the loins of abraham of
[1:38:03] um aaron
[1:38:06] because it was by succession
[1:38:09] it was by family from aaron came his son
[1:38:13] and son
[1:38:14] and to be the priest so in order to be
[1:38:16] part of the priesthood
[1:38:17] you had to be in the lin the right
[1:38:19] lineage to be a priest
[1:38:23] and to be a king you had to be in the
[1:38:25] right lineage to be a king
[1:38:28] that means before you were expressed as
[1:38:30] a king you were in the loins of the king
[1:38:34] before you were expressed as a priest
[1:38:35] you were in the loins of the priest
[1:38:38] so before you can be expressed amen
[1:38:41] and the priesthood of melchizedek where
[1:38:43] were you
[1:38:47] before you can be expressed amen as a
[1:38:50] king
[1:38:50] amen where were you you were in the king
[1:38:53] you were in the loins of spiritual loins
[1:38:55] the spiritual gene of his life is in you
[1:38:58] now
[1:38:58] was in him there you had to come from
[1:39:01] the right lineage
[1:39:02] you can't just make yourself a king you
[1:39:04] can't just make yourself a priest
[1:39:06] this isn't somebody this isn't this
[1:39:08] isn't a crow putting peacock feathers in
[1:39:10] this isn't a crow putting dove feathers
[1:39:12] in
[1:39:13] it has to be born for that purpose it
[1:39:16] has to be in the right lineage
[1:39:17] if you're a king and a priest then you
[1:39:19] were in the loins of god before the
[1:39:21] foundation of the world
[1:39:22] because he's the king and the priest
[1:39:25] he's the and jesus christ came
[1:39:27] king of kings and you were in him when
[1:39:29] he was here
[1:39:32] he's king of kings you're a king he's
[1:39:34] the king of kings
[1:39:36] you come from that lineage so that means
[1:39:39] you
[1:39:39] have rights to be a king you have rights
[1:39:42] to be a priest
[1:39:43] because you come from the right lineage
[1:39:46] if you're a king and a priest then
[1:39:47] there's a revelation of origin
[1:39:49] attached to the priesthood and the
[1:39:52] kingship
[1:39:54] so who's going to move you from it you
[1:39:56] were born to be a king
[1:39:58] you were born to be a priest before you
[1:40:01] ever were born on this life
[1:40:02] you were a c gene in the thoughts of god
[1:40:05] you were predestinated to be in this
[1:40:07] position
[1:40:08] no one will move you from that position
[1:40:12] and that position holds power and
[1:40:14] authority
[1:40:15] and dominion and through spiritual
[1:40:19] amnesia
[1:40:20] we don't realize what our position is
[1:40:21] and we're wondering through life
[1:40:23] hoping someday we'll be a king and
[1:40:24] priest we're we're not in position
[1:40:27] and we have no power to overcome but by
[1:40:30] the quickening power of god
[1:40:31] when he gives us the realization by
[1:40:33] revelation of what
[1:40:34] our position is because of the lineage
[1:40:37] we came from
[1:40:38] that we are now kings and priests kings
[1:40:41] over a spiritual dominion or a
[1:40:43] spiritual kingdom priest amen after the
[1:40:45] order of melchizedek when we realize
[1:40:47] where that
[1:40:47] position gives us power for overcoming
[1:40:50] because we know who we are
[1:40:52] we know what we're supposed to do we
[1:40:53] know the word that applies to us
[1:40:57] we're not wondering about we're not
[1:40:59] tossed about we're secure
[1:41:00] we're planted we know who we are we're
[1:41:03] moving forward as kings and priests
[1:41:05] watching all the circumstances around us
[1:41:07] move
[1:41:08] out of the way because we're in position
[1:41:11] amen amen
[1:41:15] there's power that comes from our
[1:41:16] god-given position
[1:41:18] but through the church ages we lost our
[1:41:21] position
[1:41:23] we were in bondage and our inheritance
[1:41:27] got all tied up and wrapped up in all
[1:41:29] kinds of nonsense
[1:41:30] and we lost our inheritance we were
[1:41:33] separated from the promises
[1:41:35] living without our privileges living
[1:41:38] without our land
[1:41:41] but there come a jubilee
[1:41:47] amen
[1:41:51] and in this jubilee every man that had
[1:41:53] lost his inheritance by some means
[1:41:55] if he was a freeborn and true blood of
[1:41:57] israel no matter who held the possession
[1:42:00] it had to go back to him free free
[1:42:05] you don't have to pay for it it was
[1:42:06] already paid for
[1:42:10] he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't

[1:42:19] your jubilee we're talking about you

[1:42:30] have to pay a thing
[1:42:33] this isn't about getting it right this
[1:42:35] is not about paying
[1:42:36] this is about believing amen what's
[1:42:38] already been done
[1:42:39] by a spiritual revelation of the word of
[1:42:42] god
[1:42:43] moving into our position that's already
[1:42:45] ours
[1:42:47] we didn't have to pay a thing didn't
[1:42:49] have to do a thing but just stop what he
[1:42:51] was doing
[1:42:53] and go back to his inheritance
[1:42:57] we just had to stop living a chicken
[1:42:59] life stop living a denomination of life
[1:43:01] you didn't have to do anything
[1:43:02] that ego didn't have to do anything it
[1:43:04] already had everything it needed to do
[1:43:06] all i had to do was take those god-given
[1:43:08] wings flap them a few times
[1:43:10] and set the wings and move up in the air
[1:43:12] they don't have to do anything
[1:43:14] don't have to pay anything all you have
[1:43:15] to do is stop
[1:43:17] doing what you're doing and go back to
[1:43:19] your inheritance
[1:43:22] this message came amen to break our
[1:43:24] spiritual amnesia
[1:43:25] and this message came as a jubilee it
[1:43:28] was a jubilee trumpet
[1:43:30] it was a great trumpet amen to bring us
[1:43:32] back to what the faith of our
[1:43:33] pentecostal fathers
[1:43:35] what's pentecost 50.
[1:43:38] the term pentecost means 50 it's jubilee
[1:43:42] and he brought us back what to the
[1:43:43] original faith of the pentecostal
[1:43:45] fathers
[1:43:46] that opening in the seals is our jubilee
[1:43:48] trumpet to call us back and you don't
[1:43:50] have to pay anything

[1:44:05] written you don't have to do anything
[1:44:06] you don't have to change the words you
[1:44:07] don't have to manipulate anything
[1:44:09] all you got to do is move back into it
[1:44:11] [Applause]
[1:44:15] oh my he had a right to it
[1:44:20] that means you have a right to this
[1:44:22] revealed word
[1:44:24] it's your right it's not you're not
[1:44:27] hoping for a revelation you're not
[1:44:28] hoping the word works
[1:44:29] you have a right to this promised word
[1:44:33] it was a god-given right because he by
[1:44:36] grace had inherited it
[1:44:38] and it would be given to his fathers and
[1:44:40] handed down year after year
[1:44:41] no matter what had taken place if he
[1:44:43] lost it it must go
[1:44:45] free it meant grace is his way provided
[1:44:48] for each individual to return to their
[1:44:50] rightful inheritance
[1:44:53] what a picture it gives us tonight of
[1:44:55] the church in this last days
[1:44:57] are you getting the picture
[1:45:02] you see what man can do and when you see
[1:45:05] what god does
[1:45:06] what man does is failing and will fail
[1:45:09] has failed and always will fail
[1:45:11] but what god does is eternal and must
[1:45:13] forever remain
[1:45:15] nothing can ever take it away god give
[1:45:17] it it's his free gift
[1:45:19] and by sovereign foresight saw it and
[1:45:21] placed it and there's nothing can ever
[1:45:23] move it
[1:45:25] it's there eternally and that jubilee
[1:45:27] was god's manner of expressing grace to
[1:45:29] his people with restoring
[1:45:31] or being bought back brought back to
[1:45:34] their rightful
[1:45:35] position what did our jubilee call do at
[1:45:39] the opening of the seals
[1:45:41] what did it do it brought us back to our
[1:45:44] rightful position
[1:45:45] as sons and daughters of god it took the
[1:45:48] book of redemption and put it back in
[1:45:50] the hands of man
[1:45:51] now all that adam lost belongs to the
[1:45:54] bride
[1:45:54] belongs to the children of god it's been
[1:45:57] given back we just have to walk by faith
[1:45:59] stop doing what we're doing and start
[1:46:02] moving into an inheritance
[1:46:04] and this revealed this revealed is our
[1:46:06] inheritance
[1:46:08] not the printed pages but the word amen
[1:46:10] made flesh the word
[1:46:12] revealed is our inheritance and we've
[1:46:14] got to stop
[1:46:15] doing what we're doing start stop
[1:46:17] serving the task master stop living like
[1:46:19] a slave
[1:46:21] [Applause]
[1:46:22] stop with the slave mentality stop
[1:46:24] laboring for somebody else's ideas
[1:46:28] stop working in somebody else's field
[1:46:30] but now i can go back to my portion
[1:46:32] my inheritance because i've been called
[1:46:34] to be the bride in this last day
[1:46:36] there's an inheritance there's a portion
[1:46:38] for me and that's the full
[1:46:40] measure of the new testament is my
[1:46:42] portion
[1:46:44] and i can live it and every promise in
[1:46:46] the book is mine and all i got to do is
[1:46:48] stop doing what i'm doing

[1:47:19] just gradually let loose as it did
[1:47:21] through the prophets and so forth until
[1:47:23] it was perfectly made known the godhead
[1:47:25] bodily in christ so all down through the
[1:47:27] old testament the mystery was gradually
[1:47:29] let loose
[1:47:30] through the prophets through the
[1:47:32] patriarchs through it all all the way
[1:47:34] down until
[1:47:34] finally it was made manifest perfectly
[1:47:38] made known that god had bodily in christ
[1:47:41] and now the christ in the church is just
[1:47:44] being made known
[1:47:47] the whole thing is the revelation of god
[1:47:50] to take eve back to her right position
[1:47:53] again
[1:47:54] with her husband
[1:47:57] what's all of this doing what was the
[1:47:58] message sent for

[1:48:07] jubilee trumpet
[1:48:09] to what bring the spiritual eve
[1:48:12] back to her position

[1:48:18] doing
[1:48:20] stop what you're doing stop thinking the
[1:48:22] way you've been thinking stop
[1:48:23] serving what you've been serving come

[1:48:26] priests with god
[1:48:27] come back to the realization that you're
[1:48:29] a joint heir of all things
[1:48:30] come back to seated in heavenly places
[1:48:33] in christ jesus
[1:48:34] as a son of god with dominion with
[1:48:37] dominion you're not hoeing in anybody
[1:48:40] else's field
[1:48:41] you have dominion over sin
[1:48:44] the flesh the world and the devil
[1:48:48] the whole thing the whole thing
[1:48:52] is the revelation of god to take eve
[1:48:55] back to her right position again with
[1:48:57] her husband
[1:48:58] notice and god is the husband of the
[1:49:00] church and the church is his bride
[1:49:04] what was the purpose of the message to
[1:49:06] get the bride
[1:49:08] to hear the jubilee trumping
[1:49:11] to get here to realize you've lost your
[1:49:13] inheritance you've been in bondage

[1:49:22] of the full inheritance
[1:49:23] amen the message came as a jubilee
[1:49:26] trumpet the seals were open to sound of
[1:49:28] trump and it's a revelation of god
[1:49:30] to get eve back in her position again
[1:49:33] why is it here
[1:49:34] it's not here to show that there's been
[1:49:36] a mighty prophet on the land
[1:49:39] the message didn't come to show a mighty
[1:49:41] prophet amen god did that to get our
[1:49:43] attention so we would listen to that
[1:49:45] prophet so that he could give his
[1:49:46] message
[1:49:47] and his message was to bring eve back to
[1:49:49] her position with her husband again

[1:50:07] visible union
[1:50:08] you've already conquered all things
[1:50:13] and now what's taken place in the
[1:50:15] invisible realm
[1:50:16] is going to be made manifest the
[1:50:19] positive
[1:50:20] has already come together and now in the
[1:50:22] negative
[1:50:23] god is going to start showing what's
[1:50:24] already happened
[1:50:26] trial by trial circumstance by
[1:50:29] circumstance
[1:50:30] overcoming by overcoming victory by
[1:50:32] victory
[1:50:33] he's showing in this realm what has
[1:50:35] already taken place
[1:50:37] you've already conquered all things all
[1:50:39] things are already yours you're already
[1:50:41] in position
[1:50:42] you are a king and a priest what's it
[1:50:45] going to take
[1:50:47] believing that acting upon it
[1:50:51] speaking it by inspiration and watching
[1:50:54] everything move out of our way
[1:51:01] i don't want to do it again but i'm
[1:51:02] going to repent twice
[1:51:12] there's not one thing the christian has
[1:51:14] in his armor that's scientific
[1:51:18] did you know that love joy peace long
[1:51:20] sovereign goodness meekness gentleness
[1:51:22] patience faith
[1:51:23] holy ghost everything is unseen by
[1:51:26] science
[1:51:28] and that's the only thing that's real
[1:51:30] and lasting
[1:51:35] where's your inheritance it's unseen
[1:51:40] where's your position it's unseen
[1:51:43] science can't see it i'm a joiner of
[1:51:46] christ i'm seated with christ
[1:51:48] really you're like standing here you're
[1:51:50] sitting right there
[1:51:52] it's unseen to science but the things
[1:51:55] that are unseen are the things that are
[1:51:57] real and true and the things that are
[1:52:00] seen
[1:52:00] are the false
[1:52:03] i'm already see with crisis i'm a king
[1:52:06] and a preacher you don't look like much
[1:52:07] of a king
[1:52:09] that's because you're looking by science
[1:52:12] you're looking with carnal understanding
[1:52:14] you're not seeing the reality
[1:52:16] because the things that are unseen are
[1:52:18] the real and lasting things
[1:52:23] it takes a revelation from god to see
[1:52:27] the unseen things
[1:52:29] you don't see with these eyes you don't
[1:52:30] hear them with these ears but there's a
[1:52:32] set of eyes and a set of ears that can
[1:52:34] hear and see
[1:52:35] and they can hear and see the unseen
[1:52:37] realities of god but it's going to be by
[1:52:39] revelation to a
[1:52:40] to a specific group of people
[1:52:45] it's not okay to live a carnal life
[1:52:47] anymore
[1:52:49] it's not okay to keep doing what we were
[1:52:51] doing
[1:52:52] under the 49 years under the seven
[1:52:54] cycles of seven
[1:52:56] of the church ages it's not okay anymore
[1:52:59] serving somebody else's idea hoping
[1:53:02] somebody else will feed me
[1:53:04] being in bondage to somebody else's
[1:53:06] system or my own
[1:53:09] that's not gonna work anymore jubilee
[1:53:12] astounded
[1:53:14] jubilee sounded i'm gonna stop doing
[1:53:16] what i'm doing
[1:53:18] i'm coming back to my inheritance with
[1:53:20] faith that i'm a joint heir
[1:53:22] i'm a child of god i'm a son of the king
[1:53:25] i come from the right lineage and i am
[1:53:28] now
[1:53:29] a spiritual king and i am now
[1:53:32] a royal priesthood you want to manifest
[1:53:35] something else
[1:53:36] absolutely and i'll be that then too
[1:53:40] but that doesn't mean i'm not that now
[1:53:46] i encourage us all stop
[1:53:49] stop fighting the flesh we were not with
[1:53:53] flesh
[1:53:53] let's stop warring with flesh let's stop
[1:53:57] with all the carnal
[1:53:59] attempts to fix things
[1:54:03] let's stop with all the carnal trying to
[1:54:06] manipulate situations to make things
[1:54:08] work out
[1:54:10] let's move into our position as
[1:54:12] spiritual kings and priests
[1:54:14] and let's meditate on the word of god
[1:54:16] and pray for god to give us the answer
[1:54:19] the word in this situation i want to
[1:54:21] take that word and i want to plug it in
[1:54:23] here because if i can take that word and
[1:54:24] plug it in here by faith it's mine
[1:54:27] i don't care if i wait 25 years 50 years
[1:54:29] or 5 months or 5 minutes
[1:54:30] if that doesn't matter to me if i can by
[1:54:33] faith
[1:54:33] receive a revelation word and take that
[1:54:35] word and plug it in here by faith
[1:54:37] i will have whatsoever i have asked for
[1:54:41] let's start acting like kings and
[1:54:43] priests not like
[1:54:46] whatever i like children in this world
[1:54:49] but like children of the king
[1:54:52] let's all stand musicians if you come
[1:54:55] with a tommy
[1:54:56] you don't mind to come remember the
[1:55:00] story brother bam told of the slave
[1:55:01] market
[1:55:02] slave trader went down to the slave
[1:55:04] market he told that story numerous times
[1:55:06] we all know it
[1:55:07] he said there's one slave that didn't
[1:55:08] act like the rest oh
[1:55:11] i want to be that one in this earth that
[1:55:13] doesn't act like the rest
[1:55:15] i want to stand out to the rest of the
[1:55:16] world i want it to be noticeable
[1:55:18] that one there is not like any of the
[1:55:20] rest of them
[1:55:21] any because that's the question do you
[1:55:23] feed him better is he a boss over no
[1:55:25] he's in the same situation all of them
[1:55:27] in
[1:55:28] he's got to work amen he's got to go to
[1:55:30] the grocery store
[1:55:31] he's got to lay down and sleep amen he's
[1:55:33] got to live a natural life
[1:55:35] his hair is turning gray or falling out
[1:55:39] he says he's in the same he's in the
[1:55:41] same spot as the rest of them
[1:55:46] but yet he doesn't act like any of them
[1:55:50] that one slave stood up to the the slave
[1:55:53] trader he said i'd like to buy that when
[1:55:54] he said he's not for sale
[1:55:57] so what makes him so different so you
[1:55:59] know i used to wonder that myself until
[1:56:01] i found out
[1:56:03] but though he's a slave and far from
[1:56:05] home
[1:56:09] he knows back in the home country his
[1:56:11] father is the king of the tribe
[1:56:13] and though he's away from home he
[1:56:16] conducts himself
[1:56:17] as a son of a king
[1:56:22] we're not even in that exact same
[1:56:23] situation
[1:56:25] because we're a free people in the
[1:56:28] homeland in the spiritual realm we're
[1:56:30] free
[1:56:31] we're not in bondage anymore we've been
[1:56:34] liberated
[1:56:36] we're only here to express him
[1:56:40] we're only here for his purpose for his
[1:56:43] glorification and for his expression
[1:56:45] we're not here to be punished we're not
[1:56:47] here to suffer uh
[1:56:48] for no reason we're not here we're only
[1:56:51] here
[1:56:51] to bring glory to his name and so that
[1:56:53] he can manifest himself
[1:56:55] through the bride and if we can come
[1:56:58] back to our right position and know that
[1:57:01] i'm a king
[1:57:02] and i'm a priest and when god
[1:57:05] in his in his perfect thinking allows a
[1:57:08] child to come my way
[1:57:10] i'm not going to fall to the ground and
[1:57:12] kick and scream like a three-year-old
[1:57:13] and say god why
[1:57:14] this happening to me that's
[1:57:17] not remembering you're a king and a
[1:57:19] priest
[1:57:21] that's going back to spiritual amnesia
[1:57:27] oh god the most horrible thing has
[1:57:29] happened
[1:57:32] do you understand your flesh will
[1:57:35] respond in certain ways
[1:57:37] to anxiety and fear you can't stop that
[1:57:39] the flesh may
[1:57:40] feel fear may feel anxiety may feel sad
[1:57:43] but there's something on the inside that
[1:57:46] is going to take control of those
[1:57:48] emotions and say you know what
[1:57:49] i am a son of god i am a daughter of god
[1:57:52] i am not in bondage to this situation
[1:57:55] i'm not a slave to my emotions
[1:57:56] i am not in bondage to these
[1:57:58] circumstances or this world i am a king
[1:58:01] and a priest and i am going to conduct
[1:58:03] myself though far from home though in
[1:58:05] the middle of a bad situation
[1:58:07] i'm going to conduct myself like a king
[1:58:09] and a priest
[1:58:13] in that revelation the bride can face
[1:58:16] down anything no more spiritual amnesia
[1:58:22] no more being in bondage to the carnal
[1:58:24] elements of the world
[1:58:25] no more allowing fear to dictate every
[1:58:28] decision
[1:58:28] no more allowing amen carnal lust and
[1:58:32] flesh and worldliness to control us and
[1:58:34] control our responses
[1:58:35] no more of that we're not in bodies of
[1:58:37] that that's all under our dominion and
[1:58:40] now we're going to rise above it and
[1:58:41] we're going to act upon the word
[1:58:43] and the word only we're going to have
[1:58:46] faith in that word and watch that word
[1:58:49] bring to pass
[1:58:49] everything he said it would bring the
[1:58:51] past because we're not standing on a
[1:58:53] motion
[1:58:53] we're not standing on carnal thinking
[1:58:55] we're not standing on past tradition
[1:58:57] we're standing on the word
[1:58:58] and the word only because we are kings
[1:59:01] and priests
[1:59:02] and we know to operate in this realm we
[1:59:04] have to operate according to his
[1:59:06] word and if we operate according to his
[1:59:08] word in the unseen
[1:59:09] it'll manifest itself in the scene
[1:59:13] got to come with the right thinking with
[1:59:15] the right understanding
[1:59:16] with the right approach and everything
[1:59:19] we come to
[1:59:20] will move under our feet under our feet
[1:59:24] and under our feet we've got to keep
[1:59:27] moving friends

[1:59:31] have to know the jubilee call
