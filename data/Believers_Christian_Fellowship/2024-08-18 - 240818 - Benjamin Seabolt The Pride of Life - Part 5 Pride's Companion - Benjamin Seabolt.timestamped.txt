[13:36] we just love you this
[13:39] morning Lord we just worship you this
[13:42] evening or this morning
[13:45] Lord for you're certainly worship
[13:49] certainly worthy of our worship and of
[13:51] Our Praise
[13:53] Lord you've been so
[13:57] gracious father not just
[14:00] to send us truth in this age but to
[14:05] bring us truth yourself in this age
[14:09] father and not only that
[14:12] but you've been gracious and
[14:19] you've passed over billions of people
[14:22] father
[14:30] billions of people father to come by our
[14:33] way by your grace to open our
[14:42] eyes father for what good would truth be
[14:46] if we didn't have eyes to
[14:52] see Lord but you've been so merciful to
[14:55] us you've been so gracious to us father
[14:58] and I would would just pray
[15:02] that you would come this morning Father
[15:05] that you would
[15:07] just let us be still Lord that we can
[15:11] hear your
[15:13] voice Lord for we're not here
[15:16] to see each other as wonderful as that
[15:19] is we're
[15:21] not certainly not here to hear what a
[15:24] man has to say
[15:27] Lord way would just ask that you would
[15:30] come and do what no man can do but that
[15:33] you would just pick up this book and
[15:36] that you would loose the seals father
[15:37] and that you would feed your
[15:41] children we just want to commit
[15:43] ourselves to you that you would have
[15:44] your perfect will and that you would
[15:47] accomplish what you've ordained to
[15:49] accomplish this morning Lord that we
[15:52] could just as the song says just settle
[15:55] ourselves and that we would be quiet and
[15:58] that we would receive what you have to
[16:01] say we ask this in the precious name of
[16:04] the Lord Jesus Christ and the bride
[16:07] says amen God bless you this
[16:11] morning going to invite you into the
[16:13] scriptures to the book of
[16:18] Philippians appreciate the atmosphere
[16:21] this
[16:22] morning I believe the atmosphere
[16:26] is conducive for God to move for God to
[16:29] say what God wants to
[16:33] say brother brandom says without an
[16:35] atmosphere you can do
[16:40] nothing so we
[16:42] certainly want to welcome
[16:48] that Philippians
[16:50] [Music]
[16:54] 2 beginning verse three
[17:01] let
[17:02] nothing be done through Strife or vain
[17:05] Glory but in lowliest of Mind Let each
[17:10] esteem others better than
[17:13] themselves look not every man on his own
[17:16] things but every man also on the things
[17:18] of
[17:19] others let this mind be in you which was
[17:22] also in Christ
[17:23] Jesus who being in the form of God
[17:26] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[17:30] God but made himself of no
[17:33] reputation and took upon him the form of
[17:35] a servant and was made in the likeness
[17:38] of men and being found in fashion as a
[17:41] man he humbled
[17:43] himself and became obedient un death
[17:46] even the death of the Cross God bless
[17:48] you as you would have your seats I would
[17:51] just like
[17:52] to continue with this thought on the
[17:55] pride of life and I'm not certain but I
[17:58] think this might be the wrapping up
[18:00] portion of that but I would just like
[18:04] to speak on the pride of life with a
[18:08] subtitle of Pride's
[18:12] companion Pride's
[18:16] companion 1 John 2:15 says love not the
[18:19] world neither the things that are in the
[18:21] world for If any man love the world the
[18:23] love of the father is not in him for all
[18:26] that is in the world the lust of the
[18:28] Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the
[18:30] pride of life is not of the
[18:34] father but is of the
[18:37] world I'm going to read this quote
[18:39] probably getting very very familiar with
[18:42] this but as I've told you time and again
[18:44] this is kind of where this thought and
[18:47] inspiration spurred from so I just want
[18:49] to read this quote and then we're going
[18:52] to go into fresh
[18:54] material 1953 and go tell my disciples
[18:58] brother says speaking of Mary
[19:02] Magdalene so she had Seven Devils cast
[19:05] out of her pride and envy and she
[19:10] thought that she was so pretty and that
[19:13] there was no one like
[19:16] her so again brother Brandon brings the
[19:18] definition of pride to us and he
[19:21] readjusts our standard to what we may
[19:24] have thought Pride was but a prophet
[19:26] comes on the scene and reveals the true
[19:29] definition of that that she thought she
[19:32] was so pretty and that there was nobody
[19:36] like
[19:37] her but when Jesus spoke and said be
[19:41] thou
[19:42] clean all that left
[19:44] her she became a new person she wasn't
[19:49] so pretty anymore in her own sight but
[19:52] she wrapped herself in the robe of
[19:54] meekness and gentleness and followed the
[19:57] master
[20:00] so a prophet no
[20:03] doubt theologians
[20:06] have studied this scripture for decades
[20:09] and centuries wondering what these Seven
[20:13] Devils
[20:20] were but then we have a Prophet come on
[20:23] the
[20:26] scene and starts revealing
[20:29] what these Seven Devils
[20:32] were and he says pride and envy so we
[20:37] immediately get two of them and I don't
[20:40] know if you remember or not but when I
[20:43] very first preached on Pride I had
[20:47] mentioned that if anybody found out what
[20:49] the other ones were to please tell
[20:52] me and a brother
[20:55] did the day after I preached on Pride
[21:00] and then he still tried to tell me and
[21:03] convince me that he loved me like I'm
[21:06] not ready for the other ones quite yet
[21:08] you know
[21:09] just maybe in a couple weeks you can let
[21:12] me know what the rest of them
[21:14] are but I want to read you this quote
[21:16] out of 1962 speaking of the same
[21:18] individual and the same situation and
[21:20] brother brandom says Mary recognized his
[21:23] position that day when she came out and
[21:27] said if you would have been here my
[21:29] brother would have not
[21:31] died and he said thy brother shall rise
[21:33] again said yes Lord in the resurrection
[21:36] he was a good
[21:38] boy Jesus said but I am the resurrection
[21:42] believest thou this and she said yay
[21:44] Lord I believe that you are the Son of
[21:47] God that was to come into the
[21:51] world he says Where Have You buried
[21:56] him the conf
[22:00] confession yay Lord I believe that you
[22:04] are the Son of God that has come into
[22:06] the world is immediately followed by the
[22:08] question where have you buried him
[22:11] you've been calling me you have been
[22:12] seeking me you've been wanting me to
[22:15] come I've asked you a
[22:17] question you
[22:20] have as we would maybe
[22:22] say you have said the right
[22:27] thing because there is no more delay
[22:30] after this
[22:31] confession Jesus immediately goes into
[22:34] action where have you buried
[22:37] him oh he says there you are she
[22:40] recognized it that little woman wasn't
[22:42] saying that she had Seven Devils cast
[22:45] out of her she knowed the power of God
[22:48] that could take pride and stress and
[22:53] everything away from her that could take
[22:56] that little self selfish high school
[23:03] spirit out of her and make her a new
[23:11] creature a
[23:13] little
[23:15] selfish high school
[23:20] spirit what we would view
[23:24] as
[23:26] maybe annoying
[23:30] or
[23:33] immature the prophet says is a
[23:38] demon a
[23:41] demon a
[23:43] little
[23:45] selfish high school
[23:49] spirit I have no
[23:52] authority to
[23:54] say what a little selfish high school
[23:57] spirit is I have have my
[23:59] ideas I'm sure that you have yours but I
[24:02] would venture to say that we could
[24:03] probably all recognize it when we see
[24:08] it but I've studied this for months now
[24:11] prayerfully wondering what does a
[24:14] prophet of God mean he can use any vocab
[24:18] any vocabulary that he wants any
[24:20] verbiage that he wants to describe this
[24:22] demon that was cast out of Mary but he
[24:25] would classify it as a little self
[24:28] selfish high school
[24:32] spirit and again I'm No Authority but
[24:34] just what spoke to my
[24:36] heart is when you look at an
[24:40] individual that's coming out of high
[24:43] school this is an
[24:46] individual who's not a
[24:48] toddler they're not a necessarily a
[24:51] juvenile but this is an
[24:54] individual who has just accomplished
[24:57] something that the required to do this
[24:59] is an individual that's accomplished
[25:02] something and done something before they
[25:04] can move on in
[25:06] life and this is an individual at this
[25:10] stage and I can
[25:12] remember you know when I was in school
[25:14] you know they would have guidance
[25:16] counselors and life planners and all
[25:19] that but this High School stage of life
[25:25] is when I would venture to say you're
[25:27] now qual qualified to do something and
[25:30] you having to make the decision of what
[25:33] you're going to do with your life prior
[25:35] to this you really don't necessarily
[25:37] have freedom to do with your life what
[25:40] you want because you got to go to
[25:43] school but now here at the end of this
[25:48] there's this Liberty that you know is
[25:50] coming that you can start making
[25:53] decisions and you can start plotting
[25:57] your course in life
[25:59] yeah and a prophet Taps into this and
[26:02] says that this demon that was cast out
[26:04] of Mary was a little selfish high school
[26:07] spirit this spirit that would get on a
[26:11] person in a juncture of life to where
[26:14] they have to start making decisions for
[26:17] themselves that they have to start
[26:19] making life choices
[26:33] the culture and the educational
[26:39] system is
[26:42] geared to force you into these
[26:45] decisions if you could just do the
[26:47] lights a little bit more brother that
[26:48] would be helpful thank you it
[26:51] is focused and geared the whole
[26:55] educational system is to force you into
[26:59] making a decision to force you into a
[27:01] life's course to force you into a path
[27:05] of a of an
[27:07] occupation your whole education is for
[27:09] an occupation you've you've now got to
[27:12] take what you've got and now you've got
[27:13] to do something with
[27:16] it and you're wired this way and you
[27:19] score this way on a test and you have
[27:21] these certain responses and this is the
[27:23] best direction for you to go
[27:30] but a prophet would say that it's at
[27:32] this juncture of time this High School
[27:35] juncture of
[27:37] time that there's a selfish Spirit a
[27:42] demon at
[27:47] work and I don't know about
[27:51] you because I quit Public School in
[27:54] seventh grade and homeschooled the rest
[27:56] of the time graduate way to top of my
[27:58] class thank you very
[28:01] much also bottom of my class thank you
[28:03] very
[28:05] much but when I was in public school I
[28:09] never had one guidance counselor or one
[28:13] life
[28:14] planner ask me have you prayed about
[28:17] what you think you should do with your
[28:21] life not a one the single most important
[28:26] thing to do at at that juncture of time
[28:30] to approach God prayerfully with what he
[28:34] wants me to do with my life is not
[28:37] mentioned a single time in that
[28:45] program and it gives way and makes
[28:50] way for this demon to start
[28:54] working because it's a pressure and it's
[28:56] a push and it's a force that you've come
[29:00] to this point and now you've got to do
[29:02] something like you just can't sit around
[29:05] and figure this out you've got to move
[29:07] forward you've got to get into school
[29:09] there's scholarships to be applied for
[29:11] there's vocational schools to go into
[29:14] there's there is never any emphasis on
[29:17] how about we just settle down for a
[29:19] second and let's get quiet for a moment
[29:22] and if at this juncture of time in life
[29:25] we better make sure that we get this
[29:27] right
[29:30] because if we start out on the wrong
[29:32] Fork here we may find ourselves 10 12
[29:35] years down the road realizing that we've
[29:37] got a little selfish high school spirit
[29:39] on us and that because we didn't
[29:42] approach God
[29:43] prayerfully and because we didn't get
[29:45] quiet and we didn't get settled before
[29:47] him and we had selfishness laying in our
[29:49] heart about what we wanted to do and we
[29:52] saw that we had career skills to match
[29:54] that and we had education to match that
[29:56] and we had the willpower and the work
[29:58] ethic to facilitate that that now we're
[30:01] 10 12 years down the road and we're on
[30:03] the verge of a new promotion and we're
[30:05] on the verge of a pay raise and we find
[30:07] ourselves now questioning is this where
[30:10] he even wants me to be or
[30:12] not that's
[30:15] right all be all because we you all just
[30:19] ignore my emotions this morning okay I'm
[30:21] not trying to get you emotional it just
[30:23] is what it is but I don't
[30:28] I don't want to do away with emotions
[30:29] either because brother Brandon says when
[30:31] you get feeling the way that you're
[30:32] feeling right now it's because you're
[30:33] bumping at
[30:35] Angels there's a lot of angels up here
[30:37] on this platform this morning
[30:40] evidently but this is real and this is
[30:43] serious this is a demon at work this is
[30:46] not just a bad decision that we've made
[30:48] and this is not just a rush decision
[30:50] that we've made this has been
[30:51] orchestrated and pushed by demon forces
[30:55] by demon Spirits yes
[30:58] by selfish demon spirits that we so
[31:02] easily sweep under the
[31:04] rug and make excuses for yes
[31:08] sir but we bypass the one thing that can
[31:13] help us and the one thing that can make
[31:15] sure that we start out
[31:18] right to approach it prayerfully and to
[31:21] say not my will Lord but thine be
[31:26] done and we find ourselves decades later
[31:30] down the road having to go back and
[31:33] correct
[31:35] things having to start over
[31:39] again this is not just true in our
[31:42] occupational
[31:44] but how many
[31:46] marriages because they didn't do this
[31:50] first but was approached with a little
[31:54] selfish maybe hangover high school
[31:57] spirit or a demon that didn't want to go
[31:59] anywhere after high
[32:01] school and because you thought you could
[32:04] you had the World by the tail and that
[32:07] you were free now and could make
[32:10] whatever decisions you wanted to and
[32:12] maybe you even had a driver's license
[32:13] you could drive anywhere you wanted to
[32:15] and now this demon is still lurking this
[32:17] demon is still laying there and now we
[32:20] enter into a relationship with this and
[32:22] we're not entering into a relationship
[32:24] prayerfully and by Revelation but we're
[32:26] entering into a Rel relationship
[32:36] selfishly and then we find ourselves
[32:39] years into a marriage wondering what's
[32:42] going on what's
[32:47] wrong what happened I thought I loved
[32:50] her I thought I loved him I thought they
[32:52] loved me
[32:54] but we look back when when I say we I'm
[32:58] not saying I'm in this position I'm just
[32:59] preaching spir principles okay so like
[33:02] me and my wife's
[33:04] fine aren't we
[33:05] [Laughter]
[33:12] honey I'm just preaching spir principles
[33:15] I'm not necessarily speaking to IND
[33:17] individual circumstances
[33:22] yet but we would enter a relationship
[33:27] selfishly
[33:30] maybe entering that
[33:32] relationship of without prayer not by
[33:36] Revelation and even carnally not what I
[33:40] can do for that individual how can I
[33:42] fulfill that individual's needs and
[33:46] heart's desire but what can they do for
[33:49] me what are they fulfilling for
[33:54] me and then we wonder why it's wrecked
[33:57] up 56
[33:58] down the road is because it was built on
[34:00] a demon of selfishness of what they can
[34:04] do for me how she can be pleasing to me
[34:08] how she's the prettiest so I have to
[34:11] have
[34:12] her how he makes more money than this
[34:15] guy so I I need that he has a more
[34:20] stable
[34:22] Foundation right then this guy that the
[34:25] Lord is kind of tugging in my heart
[34:27] toward
[34:28] so I'm going I'm going to go this way
[34:30] instead for selfish for stability and
[34:33] I'm not against stability I think we
[34:34] need more of it but for selfish reasons
[34:40] we would enter into that relationship
[34:41] and we would make a choice based on what
[34:44] we need and what we want and what is
[34:47] comfortable to
[34:50] us and now we've failed to deal with
[34:55] that demon as we left out of high school
[34:58] and we find that demon now in our in our
[35:00] marriage in our
[35:05] relationship and then kids come
[35:11] along and this demon is still
[35:15] lurking and now we think we're going to
[35:17] be the proper parent to these kids when
[35:19] we still got a selfish demon laying
[35:20] inside of us and we can't even view the
[35:24] situation appropriately of how can I
[35:26] minister to my children it's just how
[35:28] can these children do something for
[35:34] me and we so easily dismiss it as he's
[35:40] just hung up on
[35:41] himself he just thinks a little too much
[35:44] of
[35:46] himself he's just a little
[35:49] self-centered no I think it's time that
[35:52] we start using the terminology that the
[35:54] prophet used and I think we start
[35:56] identifying it for for what it is this
[35:59] is just not a bad characteristics
[36:03] characteristic to have attached to your
[36:06] uh
[36:09] name this is a
[36:12] demon that needs cast
[36:15] out and this demon is Pride's
[36:20] companion because everywhere that Pride
[36:22] goes selfishness
[36:26] goes brother br indoors IND doors he
[36:28] says that the doors are actually side by
[36:31] side when you walk out a Pride's
[36:34] door selfishness door is right there he
[36:38] said they're side by
[36:40] side when God's trying to do something
[36:43] in your life and cast Pride out of your
[36:45] life selfishness is there trying to pull
[36:48] it right back
[36:53] in they're attached
[36:56] together and that got to be dealt
[37:00] with because if we
[37:02] don't we're going to find ourselves on a
[37:05] career path we're not supposed to be on
[37:08] in a relationship that we're not
[37:09] supposed to be in raising children the
[37:13] way they're not supposed to be
[37:14] raised and then they're going to do to
[37:19] their children what they saw you
[37:26] do just ask just ask
[37:31] Isaac why do you think Isaac was willing
[37:35] to sell off his wife to save his own
[37:40] hide CU that's what he saw daddy
[37:44] doing why did daddy do
[37:48] that the man was willing to give up his
[37:51] wife to save his own hide it don't take
[37:54] much spiritual discernment to realize
[37:56] what spirit and what demons work
[38:00] there Abraham the founder of the
[38:07] faith had a
[38:09] little selfish high school spirit laying
[38:12] there that needed to be dealt with and
[38:14] because he didn't he now has to watch
[38:18] his his son end up in the same
[38:24] circumstance that he was in with his
[38:26] wife
[38:30] selling off his wife to save his own
[38:39] hide he says but she knowed the power of
[38:45] God that could take
[38:48] pride and
[38:50] stress there's the other there's the
[38:53] fourth demon but we're not going to get
[38:54] into that this morning
[38:58] pride and stress I'm going to touch on
[39:00] it just real quickly but where do you
[39:03] think stress comes
[39:08] from
[39:09] stress brother Brandon says the birds
[39:11] don't have any
[39:14] stress cuz they know they have a
[39:16] heavenly father that takes care of
[39:18] them so if the birds don't have any
[39:21] stress the flutter birds not the birds
[39:23] sitting back there
[39:27] the flutter
[39:30] Birds they don't have any stress because
[39:33] they know they have a heavenly father
[39:35] that will take care of them why do you
[39:38] think that you have
[39:41] stress and we will so
[39:46] easily dismiss it say that's just the
[39:49] culture we live in that's just the age
[39:51] we live in it's just that I'm busy it's
[39:53] just no it is a demon right amen that is
[39:58] working on you failing to get the
[40:01] Revelation that you are a son or
[40:03] daughter of God and he'll take care of
[40:05] what I have need
[40:09] of stress brother brandham says is the
[40:13] worst thing a human being can
[40:19] carry stress will kill
[40:22] you literally kill
[40:25] you stress will reverse all the natural
[40:30] functions of your
[40:32] body and will literally shut your body
[40:37] down all because we won't take the time
[40:40] to get quiet and settle
[40:43] ourselves and come to the proper
[40:46] Revelation I'm a son or daughter of God
[40:49] and I don't know what's the answer to
[40:51] this and I don't know what's going on
[40:52] and I don't even know
[40:54] why but I have a Heavenly Father
[40:57] that will take care of
[41:01] me we'll maybe deal with that some other
[41:05] day she had Seven Devils cast out of her
[41:08] she knowed the power of God that could
[41:10] take pride and stress and everything
[41:12] away from her that could take that
[41:14] little selfish high school spirit out of
[41:17] her and can make her a new
[41:23] creature 1954 the word becoming flesh
[41:26] brother random says and I recognized the
[41:28] other
[41:29] day a selfish Spirit coming up in
[41:36] me this has got to be bad
[41:39] right I mean this is the seventh
[41:42] messenger seventh Church age messenger
[41:45] seventh a vile Angel Malachi
[41:51] 4 I mean this has got to be pretty bad I
[41:55] recognized the other day a selfish
[41:57] Spirit coming up in me and saying this
[42:00] man is wrong I ought to tell him about
[42:08] it yeah that was pretty much my reaction
[42:10] as
[42:14] well talk about a standard being
[42:18] readjusted I recognized a selfish Spirit
[42:22] coming up in me and saying this man is
[42:24] wrong I ought to tell him about it
[42:28] that's
[42:29] wrong God is the one to tell him about
[42:31] it that's none of my
[42:36] business altars
[42:51] open if God revealed to me the man was
[42:54] wrong with righteous indignation i' be
[42:57] sure to make sure that I told him where
[42:58] he was wrong
[43:00] at he's wrong obviously it's God's will
[43:03] for me to tell him that he's wrong God
[43:05] don't want his children in error no
[43:07] brother brandom says that was a selfish
[43:10] Spirit a demon trying to get him to
[43:14] stick his nose in where it didn't
[43:23] belong if God tells you to go tell your
[43:26] brother that he's wrong
[43:27] go tell him if God don't tell you keep
[43:30] your nose out of his business and pray
[43:32] for
[43:33] him don't give way to a demon spirit
[43:37] that you
[43:38] need that's right you
[43:43] need to go tell him where he's wrong
[43:45] right let me ask you why do you need
[43:48] that's
[43:49] right really why do you need to be the
[43:52] one to go tell him that he's wrong why
[43:54] don't you just pray earnestly
[43:57] that God will speak to him through the
[43:59] preaching of the
[44:01] word why do you need to be the one to go
[44:04] tell them where they're
[44:09] wrong I have heard but now I see the
[44:11] Holy Spirit showed me a great crack in
[44:13] the earth and that it was full of oil
[44:15] and these outflows in Kentucky was just
[44:17] little beds of that that they were
[44:19] pumping from but this one came from the
[44:20] main stream and I said brother Deus it's
[44:23] there so they went down searching for it
[44:26] and they said go down and tell us where
[44:28] the oil well is and I said oh no no no
[44:31] no see we don't use the gift of God for
[44:42] commercial he sees a vision big gusher
[44:45] of oil tells the brothers who's in the
[44:47] oil industry there's one there go you'll
[44:50] go find it it's
[44:51] there go tell us where it's at brother
[44:54] random go tell us where it's at no no no
[44:56] no no
[44:59] we don't use a gift of God for
[45:02] commercial gain for commercial
[45:05] purposes he didn't say that he
[45:10] couldn't he says we
[45:14] don't I think we could draw from
[45:17] that if we draw for that draw from that
[45:20] it gets real easy to discern if
[45:23] somebody's got a spiritual gift that
[45:25] they're using properly or not
[45:27] yes because if there's any aspect of
[45:30] using it for commercial gain or I'll say
[45:32] for commercial for commercial loss to
[45:35] prevent commercial
[45:37] loss it tells me that it's not being
[45:39] used
[45:42] properly or if it's being used to
[45:44] predict the political
[45:48] world or other carnal things that we can
[45:52] benefit from
[45:54] carnally brother brandom says we do not
[45:57] use a gift of God for
[45:59] that it does not say that we can't use a
[46:02] gift of God from that for
[46:04] that he just simply says to properly use
[46:07] it we don't do
[46:11] that he says he could tell me where it
[46:14] was
[46:17] at but I don't have any need of
[46:24] it I wouldn't even have faith enough to
[46:26] to ask
[46:32] him I know I'm going slow but if I just
[46:35] blow through this and preach it we're
[46:36] going to miss it because we've heard
[46:39] these things before we know these
[46:40] principles but we've got to take time to
[46:42] be quiet and settle down and really get
[46:50] it if it if I had need of it I believe
[46:55] if I'd ask him he'd tell me
[46:58] But first you see your motives and
[47:00] objectives have to be right you have to
[47:02] have reasons for this God don't give you
[47:04] those things because you ask and you
[47:06] cannot ask in faith unless there's a
[47:09] real objective to it to be in the will
[47:11] of God see you want to be healed what's
[47:14] the reason you want to be
[47:21] healed this is the rubber meet and the
[47:23] road Saints we're talking about a
[47:25] promise of God the children bread and
[47:27] brother brandom says you properly can't
[47:30] have faith unless you first know why you
[47:33] want your healing what are you going to
[47:35] do if you get if he does heal you why
[47:39] are you asking for this
[47:45] healing is it so that you
[47:49] can oh boy I ain't going there
[47:58] I'm also going slow because I don't want
[47:59] to get in trouble this
[48:02] morning as brother brandom says it can
[48:04] get real
[48:06] Pinchy and I don't want to make sure
[48:08] it's not me talking I want to make sure
[48:09] it's him
[48:11] talking cuz it's real easy to get
[48:13] carried away with these things once you
[48:15] see the
[48:16] principle and just to blast
[48:20] it and if that needs done we'll do it
[48:23] but I don't want to be the one to do it
[48:26] if he wants to come and blast something
[48:27] this morning let him come and blast
[48:30] it but I want to make sure that
[48:33] I go a little bit slower this morning
[48:35] that I don't get caught up and do
[48:37] something that's not
[48:41] appropriate why do we want to be
[48:47] healed
[48:48] why what are we going to do if he heals
[48:55] us if it's just so that we
[48:58] can be healthy to continue a carnal
[49:02] hobby I don't know that that's the right
[49:04] motive and
[49:08] objective maybe we shouldn't be able to
[49:11] participate in that softball league like
[49:13] we want
[49:14] to
[49:16] maybe I'm stopping
[49:20] there you all get the point you all can
[49:22] deal with it
[49:30] maybe it's just so that I won't lose my
[49:32] balance when I'm climbing up in my tree
[49:36] stand now you can't say that I'm just
[49:38] preaching at
[49:40] you why do we want to be
[49:46] healthy why do I
[49:48] need this muscle in my shoulder that's
[49:51] tore
[49:54] healed so that it doesn't hurt when I
[49:56] pull my B
[49:59] back what is my
[50:02] motive what is my
[50:04] objective I believe he'll do it if I ask
[50:07] him but what is my motive what is my
[50:11] objective you know if you decrease your
[50:14] bow poundage it's easier to draw but if
[50:16] you decrease your bow poundage your
[50:18] arrow slows down and if your arrow slows
[50:20] down yardage estimation in the white
[50:23] tail Woods becomes critical and now if
[50:26] you hold an inch low you may completely
[50:29] miss that deer at 300 ft per second you
[50:31] won't but if you reduce your bow weight
[50:33] because you have a tore muscle in your
[50:37] shoulder see the the shoe starts fitting
[50:40] a little bit better than what we
[50:43] like what is our motive we are
[50:47] approaching the Throne of God to invoke
[50:50] the name of Jesus Christ on a promise
[50:54] that he died for
[50:59] amen and my motive is so that my arrow
[51:02] speed won't have to
[51:05] drop so that I don't have to worry as
[51:07] much about yardage estimation when I'm
[51:10] hunting I think I need to maybe dig a
[51:13] little bit deeper than that I think I
[51:15] maybe need to find a little bit more
[51:18] justification for that
[51:28] I'm going to stop there before what
[51:30] happens with pride happens with
[51:31] selfishness and I have a self-counseling
[51:34] session for the next two
[51:40] hours but we so easily skip over these
[51:44] things
[51:46] because we know he's a faithful father
[51:48] and if we ask him he'll do
[51:51] it but we don't think about what we're
[51:54] doing we don't realize the serious iess
[51:57] and the magnitude of what we're
[51:59] doing and that this is something that he
[52:02] that cost him his life for him to have
[52:06] the ability to supernaturally heal my
[52:08] shoulder or any other part of my body
[52:10] cost him stripes on his back cost him a
[52:14] spear in his
[52:17] side and we just approach it Friv usly
[52:21] if we ask him he'll do it don't matter
[52:23] the
[52:25] reason I think we need to get that
[52:27] selfish Spirit off of
[52:30] us and I think we need
[52:32] to take it as serious as it ought to be
[52:37] taken he
[52:45] says when the brothers got down there
[52:48] one fellow went over and bought a bunch
[52:49] of stuff and sold leases and cheated the
[52:51] other one he's still speaking about
[52:52] these men in the oil field and cheated
[52:54] the other one this way he said you see
[52:58] it won't
[53:00] work now just to make the prophecy sure
[53:03] within a hundred yards of where these
[53:05] men were digging their well some man
[53:08] struck the big gusher but because of the
[53:12] selfishness that got among it the
[53:14] objectives was wrong signing up a bunch
[53:17] of stuff saying that it would be this
[53:19] way when they promised they would do it
[53:21] for the kingdom of
[53:23] God
[53:24] but looks like like it's for themselves
[53:29] right now my understanding of that as
[53:32] these brothers approach brother brandom
[53:33] they're in the oil industry brother
[53:34] brandom has this Vision there's a big
[53:36] gusher of oil in Kentucky they said
[53:38] praise God we'll go down we'll do it and
[53:41] the whatever comes out of this we're
[53:42] going to use it for the kingdom of God
[53:45] and he says when they actually got down
[53:46] there they started making contracts and
[53:48] selling leases and doing everything but
[53:51] for the kingdom of God he
[53:54] says and it and it won't won't work no
[53:58] selfish thing will work your motives and
[54:02] objectives has to be exactly perfectly
[54:05] right then you have faith to ask and he
[54:08] starts quoting scripture if our hearts
[54:11] condemn us not then we have
[54:17] confidence 58 Queen of Sheba the medical
[54:21] doctor will say well don't you pay
[54:23] attention to that surgeon the surgeon
[54:25] will say you need an operation not a
[54:27] sugar pill and both of them would say
[54:30] the chiropractor don't have nothing to
[54:32] do with him and the chiropractors have
[54:36] nothing to do with the osteopathic
[54:38] person and they'll all say have nothing
[54:41] to do with the
[54:42] preacher you know what I think I think
[54:45] it's selfish
[54:47] motives because we all know that
[54:50] medicine does good surgery does good
[54:53] Chiropractic and osteopathic does good
[54:56] and so does the preacher look if they
[55:00] had the right
[55:02] motive we would all go arm in arm to do
[55:05] everything we could in our powers and
[55:06] our ability to make the Journey of our
[55:09] Pilgrim friends a little more happier as
[55:11] we go through life anything different
[55:14] from
[55:15] that is
[55:19] selfishness and any motive by money or
[55:24] something else behind it that's right
[55:29] brother Rand says if these individuals
[55:32] in the medical field would get this
[55:35] demon of selfishness out of them and
[55:37] quit worrying about their pocketbook and
[55:39] would really be concerned about the
[55:41] patient and the well-being of the
[55:43] patient they could all join together and
[55:46] in this case you know what we think a
[55:49] chiropractic would be best let's hold
[55:51] off on a surgery for now and in the next
[55:54] case we'll look at this and say look we
[55:56] we've done all we can for you in
[55:57] chiropractic care we really think this
[56:00] operation could help you if they would
[56:03] all work together for the well-being of
[56:06] the patient it would work because the
[56:09] motive and objective is
[56:12] right you know what's shocking about
[56:14] this and extremely
[56:17] sad is brother brandom says this is the
[56:19] way ministers
[56:24] are says the evangelist will say about
[56:27] the teacher H he's just dull and boring
[56:30] he needs a little bit more
[56:33] emotion the teacher will say about the
[56:35] Evangelist he needs to simmer down a
[56:38] little bit a little too loud a little
[56:40] too emotional very shallow very
[56:46] shallow the prophet will look over and
[56:48] say you all can't see anything like I
[56:50] see
[56:52] it the Apostle will say what are you all
[56:55] doing you need to get busy why are you
[56:57] sitting around don't I mean you you all
[57:00] haven't left your home Church in like 3
[57:10] days he says but if the ministry will
[57:13] ever get over themselves that's my words
[57:17] not his but the principle is the same if
[57:19] they will ever get over themselves and
[57:22] deal with this demon of Pride and this
[57:24] demon of selfishness
[57:26] of I need my Ministry to be the most
[57:31] important and focus on the
[57:34] patient then we'll see the Apostle going
[57:37] out and establishing people and
[57:40] establishing works and turning them over
[57:42] to a pastor and saying I've done all I
[57:44] can do for you here's somebody who can
[57:46] help
[57:47] you and the pastor won't have to have
[57:50] every re Revelation that comes along
[57:52] he'll say you know what that brother
[57:53] there he's got a gift of teaching in his
[57:55] life and I think he can help my sheep
[57:57] right
[57:59] here and the pastor will
[58:03] say there's this situation in my church
[58:06] and I just don't know how to deal with
[58:07] it and he'll go to prayer and an
[58:09] evangelist will come on his mind and the
[58:11] Evangelist will come in and deal with
[58:13] that problem and 14
[58:16] others sir harshly harshly harshly no
[58:20] way near the way that a Shepherd would
[58:22] handle his sheep but it's needful but if
[58:26] the pastor will sit there with a
[58:29] critical
[58:31] spirit and every comment the Evangelist
[58:34] makes be like well he never even
[58:37] finished the
[58:40] thought I can really preach on this
[58:43] subject because I'm wired as a
[58:46] teacher so when you come up and you make
[58:48] a point and you don't finish the thought
[58:50] out I'm like
[58:57] Lord help
[58:58] me now Look I said I was wired toward
[59:01] towards your teacher don't think that
[59:02] I'm making something of myself remember
[59:05] there
[59:06] are professors that are teachers and
[59:09] there are kindergartener
[59:11] teachers so I'm not putting myself on
[59:15] where I'm at on that scale I'm I'm just
[59:16] saying I'm wired that way to take things
[59:19] and analyze them and um you all probably
[59:23] realize that on Wednesday
[59:25] nights when we're here at
[59:28] 10:00 but he says if they can ever have
[59:32] the right motive and right objective and
[59:36] be comfortable in what God has called
[59:38] them to be then they don't need to be
[59:41] the most important then they don't
[59:44] need to be recognized as something they
[59:47] don't need the people to be mainly
[59:52] attracted to them and they can focus on
[59:54] the need of the person
[59:57] they can focus on the need of the
[59:59] congregation and they can do their part
[1:00:02] and then they can say you know what I've
[1:00:03] done all I can do in this situation we
[1:00:06] need a pastor to settle this
[1:00:09] out when I preached it I was probably a
[1:00:11] little too hard on it we need a pastor
[1:00:14] to come in and settle that out you know
[1:00:17] what when I got into that topic when the
[1:00:19] other day when I was preaching I left a
[1:00:21] lot of loose ends we need a teacher to
[1:00:23] come in and tie up some of those loose
[1:00:24] ends settle the people out settle them
[1:00:27] down give them a proper
[1:00:31] understanding oh Lord help
[1:00:34] me why do we need to have all the
[1:00:38] Revelation and be the one that says
[1:00:42] it why do we need that it's
[1:00:45] selfishness it's
[1:00:48] selfishness why do I need to get a
[1:00:51] complex when I tell the pastor before he
[1:00:53] goes on vacation that I'm going to
[1:00:54] preach on selfishness and then brother
[1:00:56] Emanuel decides he's going to come
[1:00:58] preach on selfishness and brother Gabe
[1:00:59] decides he's going to come preach on
[1:01:01] selfishness and Brother Kyle decides
[1:01:02] he's going to come and preach on
[1:01:05] self-love why should that bother me what
[1:01:08] do I have to say
[1:01:11] anyhow why do I need to say it first
[1:01:16] right why do I need to have something
[1:01:19] new if Jesus Christ can stand there and
[1:01:23] say verely verely why can't I come and
[1:01:26] say what brother Emanuel said and what
[1:01:28] brother Gabe said and what Brother Kyle
[1:01:31] said why do I need something
[1:01:39] different I'm to the point that I will
[1:01:42] read and I will pray and I will never
[1:01:45] prepare for a service until everybody's
[1:01:47] done
[1:01:48] preaching because it's come to the point
[1:01:51] it's
[1:01:53] useless they will literally come and
[1:01:56] preach Verbatim what I have written down
[1:01:59] and that does not make me spiritual that
[1:02:02] just means that God has been so gracious
[1:02:04] to us that he has opened a channel so
[1:02:08] wide that even a fool would not air
[1:02:15] therein I've went this far I might as
[1:02:17] well go
[1:02:20] farther why does a minister
[1:02:26] have to
[1:02:27] beg and plead with
[1:02:30] God to give him clear Direction and
[1:02:34] inspiration before he gets to the pull
[1:02:42] pit is it so that we can properly
[1:02:46] minister to the
[1:02:48] people or is it just because we don't
[1:02:51] want to look like a fool when we get
[1:02:53] there
[1:02:57] what if I get up there and I've got
[1:02:58] nothing to
[1:03:00] say what if he don't show
[1:03:03] up and I just have the sat there and
[1:03:06] stuttering yes be like I don't have a
[1:03:09] clue what I'm
[1:03:10] doing and I got nothing until he shows
[1:03:15] up I think we ought to beg and plead and
[1:03:20] seek the face of God before we come to
[1:03:21] this pull pit but what is our motive for
[1:03:26] it don't you all worry I'll get off of
[1:03:28] preachers here in a little bit and
[1:03:29] preach about
[1:03:32] you I mean this is really the rubber
[1:03:35] meeting the road why am I tore up for
[1:03:39] four and five days
[1:03:41] beforehand pleading with God for
[1:03:43] direction pleading with God for a whiff
[1:03:45] of inspiration pleading with God what
[1:03:48] scriptures what quotes what
[1:03:53] direction is it some that I can be in
[1:03:56] the proper Channel and that I can be in
[1:03:59] tune with his spirit and that I can
[1:04:01] Minister properly to the needs or is it
[1:04:04] just so that Benjamin seabolt don't look
[1:04:06] like a dumb hillbilly when he gets up
[1:04:09] there who has no spiritual life and
[1:04:12] obviously hasn't been in prayer and
[1:04:14] reading the word cuz he ain't got
[1:04:15] nothing to say and he certainly ain't
[1:04:17] got nothing new to say brother Emanuel
[1:04:19] already said that and Gabe said that
[1:04:21] Kyle said that the Pastor said that
[1:04:22] before he went on vacation
[1:04:26] see we it's not the mechanics that are
[1:04:29] wrong right it's just we need to really
[1:04:33] deal with why why am I invoking the name
[1:04:37] of Jesus Christ God
[1:04:39] almighty to take time to come and
[1:04:42] inspire me to speak to a people if it's
[1:04:45] just because I don't want to look like a
[1:04:47] dumb hillbilly when I get up here he has
[1:04:49] no obligation for me not to look like a
[1:04:52] dumb hillbilly when I get up here none
[1:04:56] that's what I am I'm a dumb hillbilly
[1:04:58] why does he have any obligation to make
[1:05:00] you think
[1:05:02] differently so if I approach him
[1:05:05] selfishly with a demon of selfishness
[1:05:08] laying in my spirit realm just because I
[1:05:11] don't want to look like a fool when I
[1:05:13] get up here I'm even violating scripture
[1:05:15] because the scripture says it's by the
[1:05:16] foolishness of preaching that Souls will
[1:05:19] be saved why am I seeking God so that I
[1:05:21] don't look like a fool
[1:05:31] praise the lord it's the truth
[1:05:34] anyhow it's the truth
[1:05:38] anyhow but don't leave it up here take
[1:05:41] it to work with
[1:05:46] you are you in
[1:05:50] prayer and in the Bible and in the
[1:05:54] message
[1:05:56] just so you can go tip fort with the
[1:06:03] coworker and not take a chance of them
[1:06:06] tying you up to where you can't have an
[1:06:09] answer for something you
[1:06:14] believe or is it
[1:06:17] because you're in love with
[1:06:19] him and you want more of him in you so
[1:06:23] that you can give an answer for the hope
[1:06:24] that lays within you
[1:06:26] that by per chance a coworker would need
[1:06:28] help you could minister to
[1:06:31] them and if that backslid Baptist who
[1:06:36] don't know nothing about the prophet
[1:06:38] throws a scripture at you and you have
[1:06:41] to sit there and stutter and be like uh
[1:06:43] I don't know how that correlates I don't
[1:06:45] know I
[1:06:47] I why can't you tell them you don't
[1:06:52] know why do you have to have all the
[1:06:55] answers
[1:06:58] what is our
[1:06:59] motive what is our
[1:07:02] objective we should be ready to give an
[1:07:05] answer for the hope that lays within us
[1:07:08] but God is not obligated to answer in
[1:07:12] your prayer life for more Revelation
[1:07:14] because you're wanting more Revelation
[1:07:16] to be able to win the argument at
[1:07:21] work no obligation there but I challenge
[1:07:25] you and I dare you to come and tell me
[1:07:29] that he's failed you one time to
[1:07:31] progress you in Revelation when you
[1:07:33] invoked the name of Jesus Christ before
[1:07:35] his throne seeking Revelation for your
[1:07:37] spiritual growth because you were in
[1:07:39] love with him and because there was
[1:07:41] Souls that needed to be saved and that
[1:07:43] there were people that needed to be
[1:07:45] ministered to and I need answers to give
[1:07:47] to a world that has no
[1:07:50] answers tell me one time that he's
[1:07:54] failed that
[1:07:57] he never has and he never
[1:08:01] will this is scriptural Matthew 7:22
[1:08:05] many will come to me in that day and say
[1:08:08] Lord Lord have not we prophesied in thy
[1:08:11] name and have in thy name have cast out
[1:08:13] devils and in thy name done many
[1:08:15] wonderful works and then will I profess
[1:08:18] unto them I never knew
[1:08:20] you depart from you depart from me ye
[1:08:24] that work iniquity
[1:08:27] he did not correct them and say no you
[1:08:29] did not you did all those things you
[1:08:33] prophesied you cast out devils and you
[1:08:36] did Mighty wonderful Works none of
[1:08:39] that's the problem the problem
[1:08:42] is their confession did not
[1:08:46] we
[1:08:48] yeah
[1:08:50] yes did not
[1:08:53] we did not we we do
[1:08:59] something depart from me I never knew
[1:09:03] you if they would have been doing it by
[1:09:07] his working and not laying the claim and
[1:09:11] the glory to them he would have known
[1:09:13] who they were
[1:09:22] yes I wonder how many things we have
[1:09:24] done
[1:09:27] for
[1:09:29] God in the name of
[1:09:32] God how many things have we
[1:09:38] done and there's no disputing that we
[1:09:40] done
[1:09:41] it my question is did we do it or did
[1:09:44] God do
[1:09:45] it and I don't have the answer for that
[1:09:48] and probably none of of we have the
[1:09:49] answer for that until we get to this
[1:09:52] time period but at this time period when
[1:09:54] he said to apart from me I never knew
[1:09:56] you ye that work iniquity they knew who
[1:09:58] was doing it all that good
[1:10:02] stuff they knew then what the motives
[1:10:05] and objectives
[1:10:08] were they knew
[1:10:12] then that they had yielded to a little
[1:10:16] selfish prideful high school
[1:10:20] spirit Luke 14 then he said unto them a
[1:10:24] certain man made a great supper and bade
[1:10:25] many and sent his servant at supper time
[1:10:28] to say unto them that were bidden come
[1:10:29] for all things are now ready and they
[1:10:32] all with one consent began to make
[1:10:33] excuse and the first said unto him I
[1:10:35] have bought a piece of ground and I must
[1:10:37] needs go and see it I pray thee have me
[1:10:39] excused and another said I have bought
[1:10:41] five yolk of ox and I go to prove them I
[1:10:43] pray have me excused and another said I
[1:10:47] have married a wife and therefore I
[1:10:48] cannot come so the servant came and
[1:10:50] showed his Lord these things then the
[1:10:53] master of the house being angry
[1:10:55] said to his servant go out quickly into
[1:10:58] the streets and Lanes of the city and
[1:11:00] bring in hither the poor and the maimed
[1:11:03] and the Halt and the
[1:11:10] blind there was an invitation
[1:11:12] given and there were excuses
[1:11:16] made what is profound to me is that when
[1:11:20] the Master of the
[1:11:21] House instructed his servant who to go
[1:11:24] get
[1:11:26] the ones that he instructed him to go
[1:11:29] get could not have the excuses of the
[1:11:33] other the first excuse was I've bought a
[1:11:36] piece of land and I must needs go and
[1:11:38] see it the first person that Jesus told
[1:11:40] the servant to go out and get was the
[1:11:43] poor if you're poor you ain't got no
[1:11:45] money to buy land to take up your time
[1:11:49] to distract you from the wedding supper
[1:11:51] that's right so you tell me which is
[1:11:53] better to be rich and have land and miss
[1:11:55] the wedding supper or to be for or to be
[1:11:59] poor and have the servant compelling you
[1:12:02] to
[1:12:05] come the next one said I have bought
[1:12:09] five Yol of ox and I go to prove
[1:12:13] them the second one that was compelled
[1:12:15] to come was the maimed if you're maed
[1:12:20] five yolk of ox is going to do you no
[1:12:22] good you can't run them anyhow
[1:12:27] right so you tell me would it be better
[1:12:30] to be
[1:12:32] maimed or be able to work the fields of
[1:12:35] your land with five Yol of ox and miss
[1:12:38] the wedding
[1:12:40] supper the next one says I've married a
[1:12:42] wife and therefore I cannot come the
[1:12:44] third and fourth characteristics that uh
[1:12:47] the master seeks is the Halt and the
[1:12:51] blind if you're halt which means you
[1:12:54] can't move and you're blind sorry to
[1:12:57] tell you your chances of getting a
[1:12:58] wife's pretty
[1:13:01] slim and if by
[1:13:04] chance if by chance you find
[1:13:09] one you're not going to miss the wedding
[1:13:11] supper on her behalf because you can't
[1:13:13] move and you're blind so you ain't going
[1:13:15] to do her no good to stay home
[1:13:19] anyhow the excuses that were made were
[1:13:23] directly rebutted by people who we would
[1:13:29] view as poor them Lord help them they
[1:13:34] got so many problems you know what they
[1:13:38] didn't have near as many problem as the
[1:13:40] people who missed the wedding
[1:13:43] supper I would rather
[1:13:50] be
[1:13:51] poor maimed Halt and blind
[1:13:57] and have the servant compelling me to
[1:13:58] get into the
[1:14:00] door then I would have all the money in
[1:14:02] the
[1:14:05] world healthy as can
[1:14:08] be working like a
[1:14:12] horse a beautiful
[1:14:16] wife and end up missing the wedding
[1:14:22] supper It's a Wonderful Parable isn't it
[1:14:28] Saints there's been an invitation
[1:14:31] given there has been an invitation
[1:14:34] given am there's even been a servant
[1:14:38] here compelling us to do
[1:14:42] anything but don't miss
[1:14:47] that what's our excuses we can leave it
[1:14:50] in a parable but what's our
[1:14:54] excuses I oh Lord help
[1:15:02] me I'm not a prophet so I'm not going to
[1:15:05] prophesy but I'm just going to make a
[1:15:06] statement and you hold it in your
[1:15:10] mind I don't think the
[1:15:14] squeeze is going to be us losing the
[1:15:18] ability to aircondition our homes
[1:15:26] I don't think the squeeze and the
[1:15:30] tribulation
[1:15:32] period is going to be us losing finances
[1:15:35] and not having the
[1:15:37] ability for a soft Easy
[1:15:44] Living I'm just not buying
[1:15:48] it I wonder based on this Parable I
[1:15:51] wonder sometimes if we've got it too
[1:15:54] good
[1:16:01] I'm not even going to talk to you
[1:16:02] anymore I'm going to talk to me I wonder
[1:16:04] sometimes if I've got it too
[1:16:09] good I wonder if I don't have too many
[1:16:14] excuses because we've got a little money
[1:16:17] in our pocket and we can buy something
[1:16:19] and when we buy something then it
[1:16:20] distracts us and it takes up our
[1:16:23] time I wonder if I would have been
[1:16:25] better off not to have the money to buy
[1:16:26] it and I'm not talking sinful
[1:16:32] things I just about started going down a
[1:16:34] list but I'm not going
[1:16:36] to I'm not talking about sinful
[1:16:40] things I'm just
[1:16:42] talking what this Parable is saying I
[1:16:46] wonder I wonder if that man who bought
[1:16:50] that piece of land in the
[1:16:52] parable wouldn't have looked looking
[1:16:55] back on it wouldn't
[1:16:57] have sold it or just let it
[1:17:02] go for one more chance to go to the
[1:17:04] wedding
[1:17:06] supper I wonder if that man who not
[1:17:08] bought one but had money to buy five
[1:17:11] yoke of
[1:17:16] ox I'm not a prophet so I can't
[1:17:18] interpret it but I'll throw you what I
[1:17:20] think this man had work
[1:17:22] ethic this was a hustler
[1:17:25] this was a man who was getting it done
[1:17:27] he not only had one he had five yok of
[1:17:30] oxs to
[1:17:33] work there is no doubt this man was
[1:17:35] plowing some
[1:17:38] Fields I wonder at the end of that
[1:17:40] Harvest when he had plowed all his
[1:17:43] fields and he had seed all his seed and
[1:17:44] he had reaped all his Harvest and his
[1:17:46] barns were full and he had money in his
[1:17:49] pocket and he went home to his beautiful
[1:17:51] wife I wonder
[1:17:57] I
[1:18:01] wonder when the death rattles was in his
[1:18:04] throat if he wouldn't have gave it all
[1:18:06] up for one more chance to go to that
[1:18:09] wedding
[1:18:11] supper I wonder what my excuses are
[1:18:14] Saints because there's been an
[1:18:16] invitation
[1:18:19] given 1 1200 and some
[1:18:22] times not counting the ones in the
[1:18:24] scripture
[1:18:26] there's been an invitation
[1:18:29] given the spirit and the bride say
[1:18:36] come but I wonder if we don't have a
[1:18:38] little demon lane somewhere of
[1:18:41] selfishness that because we have a
[1:18:43] little bit of money or because we have a
[1:18:45] little bit of
[1:18:48] health or because we're in a
[1:18:52] relationship or seeking a relationship
[1:18:57] carnally that we bypass the time and the
[1:19:01] opportunity to enter into a communion
[1:19:04] and fellowship and a wedding supper with
[1:19:06] our
[1:19:09] Lord there's not a single person in here
[1:19:12] that wants to Mi miss that wedding
[1:19:14] supper sir you don't even have to raise
[1:19:16] your hand I know there is not a single
[1:19:19] person in here who wants to meet Miss
[1:19:22] that meeting in the air and that wedding
[1:19:24] supper
[1:19:26] but you remember brother brandom says
[1:19:28] Dimensions doesn't change your
[1:19:31] character if we're so
[1:19:34] willing to miss supper with our Lord on
[1:19:37] a daily basis communion with him on a
[1:19:40] daily basis are we really
[1:19:43] ready for that wedding
[1:19:46] supper when we can't even sacrifice
[1:19:50] to make the
[1:19:53] physical wedding Supper once a month at
[1:19:57] the local assembly yes we're saying we
[1:20:00] want to get to the wedding supper we
[1:20:02] want to get to the wedding Feast I can't
[1:20:03] wait to be and we can't even sacrifice
[1:20:06] one Sunday evening a month to make it
[1:20:10] here remember brother Brandon says
[1:20:12] Dimensions does not change your
[1:20:14] character the way the tree leans the way
[1:20:16] the tree
[1:20:23] falls why
[1:20:26] why would we miss that it's selfishness
[1:20:31] there's something else that you've
[1:20:33] deemed more important to you than to be
[1:20:36] here at Showdown time and look I'm not
[1:20:39] talking Vacations or you you miss like
[1:20:42] once a year we're taking you out from
[1:20:44] underneath the blood
[1:20:47] like you all understand what I'm saying
[1:20:50] I
[1:20:52] hope that's The Showdown time that's the
[1:20:55] rubber meat in the road that's when
[1:20:57] you're taking the symbol of the body of
[1:21:00] Jesus Christ and looking your wife in
[1:21:02] the eye and looking your family in the
[1:21:04] eye and saying all is well the blood's
[1:21:06] on the door come what may this month the
[1:21:09] death angel come if he want the bloods
[1:21:11] on the door we're
[1:21:16] okay in this is all that we have need of
[1:21:19] the stripes have been paid the the price
[1:21:21] has been paid the stripes were on his
[1:21:23] back the blood has been shed I've
[1:21:26] accepted it I'm declaring that publicly
[1:21:29] before the church and now when we go to
[1:21:32] prayer time in our families now when
[1:21:35] Calamity arises and we invoke the name
[1:21:37] of Jesus Christ I'm not going to have
[1:21:39] that in the back of my mind you know
[1:21:44] what last communion entertainment was
[1:21:46] more important to me than Showdown
[1:21:50] time making an extra couple bucks was
[1:21:54] more important to me than Showdown
[1:21:59] time I had a man ask me one time about
[1:22:02] the speed
[1:22:04] limit you all pray for me because I'm
[1:22:06] getting way off my notes but he was
[1:22:09] asking me about the speed
[1:22:12] limit and he was you know saying well
[1:22:14] you know I don't and this is a good
[1:22:16] brother so if he ever hears this you're
[1:22:18] a good
[1:22:19] brother I love you he's a fine Brother
[1:22:25] but we was just talking in
[1:22:27] conversation and he was like you're
[1:22:29] really you know legalistic about the
[1:22:31] speed limit like if it says 55 you're
[1:22:34] not at 60 like the five Grace you know
[1:22:38] and I said look I'm not fanatical about
[1:22:40] it if you're driving down the road and
[1:22:43] it's 55 and you look down and you're
[1:22:44] going 60 like I don't think you're going
[1:22:46] to die and go to hell like just slow
[1:22:48] down like I'm
[1:22:50] not you don't have to drive 54 for fear
[1:22:53] of going over
[1:22:55] 55 like I'm not that way about it but we
[1:22:58] know the principle that lays there and
[1:23:00] we know what the prophet taught about
[1:23:01] that and I said yeah I am he's like that
[1:23:04] is interesting like I just I said listen
[1:23:07] brother you do what you want to do I
[1:23:10] said here's why I do
[1:23:13] it is I've been in situations
[1:23:17] before that I needed to touch the Throne
[1:23:19] of God and I'm not talking about
[1:23:22] tomorrow and I'm not talking about an
[1:23:24] hour from
[1:23:26] now I got to touch the throne right
[1:23:31] now and I don't want in the back of my
[1:23:36] mind popping
[1:23:38] up of some stupid little law I don't
[1:23:43] want to say that forgive me I shouldn't
[1:23:45] have said that some simple some simple
[1:23:49] little law that I could have so easily
[1:23:51] kept but in my stupidity
[1:23:55] thought that me being in a hurry was
[1:23:58] justification to violate that and it's
[1:24:02] not violation of the law that I'm
[1:24:03] fearful for it's now I know I'm in
[1:24:06] violation of his word and now I'm
[1:24:08] approaching the
[1:24:09] throne and now I know the scripture says
[1:24:12] if my heart condemn me not I have faith
[1:24:15] before God I said that's why I do it
[1:24:17] brother has nothing to do with me
[1:24:20] worried about getting a speeding ticket
[1:24:22] I don't want a speeding ticket
[1:24:25] but I'm not really concerned about
[1:24:26] getting a speeding
[1:24:29] ticket I'm worried about my heart not
[1:24:32] condemning me that's right when my wife
[1:24:35] calls me and says
[1:24:37] hey we've had an
[1:24:41] accident William needs
[1:24:44] prayer I don't want to have to go back
[1:24:47] through a whole list of things to repent
[1:24:50] of silly things little foxes that
[1:24:53] spoiled the fine before I can go to the
[1:24:56] throne I want to say honey it's
[1:24:59] okay it's okay William would be just
[1:25:07] fine what if it's urgent what if I don't
[1:25:11] have time to go back and make it
[1:25:14] right and now one of my children is
[1:25:17] suffering cuz Daddy couldn't keep his
[1:25:20] foot off the gas pedal and knew better
[1:25:23] it's not a about legalistic
[1:25:27] Saints it's about is my selfish desire
[1:25:31] to get somewhere quicker or not to look
[1:25:34] bad for showing up late more important
[1:25:36] than keeping the word of
[1:25:41] God and if it is where's that
[1:25:43] selfishness coming
[1:25:45] from is that just a bad characteristic
[1:25:48] that I need to change or is that a demon
[1:25:51] at work
[1:25:58] I have no idea how I got there but
[1:25:59] praise the
[1:26:03] Lord and it's not you know that's an
[1:26:06] easy one that we talk about because it's
[1:26:08] so simple we do it every
[1:26:12] day but you all have your own
[1:26:16] examples what about that $100 the guy
[1:26:18] paid you in in cash and you didn't
[1:26:20] report on your taxes
[1:26:26] I'm sorry but don't approach the throne
[1:26:28] of God knowing you cheated on your taxes
[1:26:30] and think he's obligated to answer
[1:26:33] you
[1:26:35] yes could you get by with it sure you
[1:26:37] can get by with it at what
[1:26:40] cost okay you got an extra okay I don't
[1:26:43] know what the percentages are because
[1:26:44] I'm not an accountant but whatever taxes
[1:26:46] are let's just say it's
[1:26:49] $25 you had to pay $25 in taxes on that
[1:26:52] $100 so you saved in your pocket
[1:26:56] $25 and sold your right to approach the
[1:26:59] throne of
[1:27:00] God that doesn't even make good
[1:27:03] sense no pun
[1:27:09] intended that doesn't even make good
[1:27:12] sense but we'll so easily bypass those
[1:27:17] things some of you are sitting here
[1:27:19] saying brother I wish you'd get over
[1:27:20] onto the seals or the trumpets or the
[1:27:22] vials
[1:27:24] I
[1:27:26] am I am it's called a white horse
[1:27:31] rider called a slight deviation away
[1:27:33] from the word that has to be combed by
[1:27:35] the pure word of God roaring back at it
[1:27:38] we are preaching the seals this
[1:27:40] morning don't blame me if you can't hear
[1:27:43] the
[1:27:47] thunder I
[1:27:49] was so thrilled when Brother Kyle was
[1:27:52] preaching Wednesday and he was talking
[1:27:54] about his neighbor coming over to
[1:27:57] him he T give her the example about the
[1:28:00] bonfire and then I know what you were
[1:28:03] meaning brother so don't take this the
[1:28:05] wrong way but then he made the comment
[1:28:06] he says we don't have to break the seals
[1:28:08] to everybody I I was sitting there I was
[1:28:10] like brother you broke the seals to
[1:28:12] her I know what he was meaning like we
[1:28:15] don't have to take time go through all
[1:28:16] the s but she was in spiritual
[1:28:19] famine and he told her the answer if
[1:28:22] you're in spiritual famine you need some
[1:28:23] oil and WI
[1:28:24] M you did break the seals to her
[1:28:29] brother true you may not have said
[1:28:32] anything about a black horse rider but
[1:28:34] there was Thunder of God going forth the
[1:28:38] seals were being
[1:28:40] broken because your barire runs out of
[1:28:42] wood and in order for it to keep going
[1:28:45] you need to put some more wood on
[1:28:47] it that's literally exactly how brother
[1:28:49] Brandon broke the
[1:28:52] seals literally in those what we would
[1:28:55] say silly little Parables that he would
[1:28:57] tell
[1:28:58] beforehand that's how he broke the seals
[1:29:01] and the people were sitting there the
[1:29:03] whole time oh what's the symbol mean
[1:29:04] what's the symbol mean what's the symbol
[1:29:06] me and it's already thundered the seal
[1:29:09] has already been broke you know I was
[1:29:10] out shooting my gun the other day and it
[1:29:12] was slightly off the
[1:29:15] target the seal was being
[1:29:20] broke but they didn't catch it
[1:29:26] but when we preach simple things like
[1:29:28] this Saints it's not because there's not
[1:29:30] a deep
[1:29:32] meaning and I'd venture to say you can
[1:29:34] have all the Deep Theology and
[1:29:36] understanding that you want and if you
[1:29:37] still can't do the simple things of
[1:29:40] obeying the laws of the land and paying
[1:29:42] your taxes and giving to Caesars what
[1:29:43] Caesars what good is that going to do
[1:29:45] you when you show up there
[1:29:46] anyhow you're going to be the Rich Young
[1:29:48] Ruler that says Lord Lord I've done all
[1:29:50] that since my youth well actually you
[1:29:52] won't be the Rich Young Ruler because
[1:29:53] you haven't done it since since your
[1:29:54] youth but you're he's going he's going
[1:29:56] to say okay but that's not the point the
[1:30:00] point
[1:30:02] is have you done what you really needed
[1:30:05] to do have you really sold out yourself
[1:30:09] to me have you done the simple thing
[1:30:12] that you could have done of getting rid
[1:30:14] of all your Earthly possessions and
[1:30:16] following
[1:30:18] me so as the scripture says it's the
[1:30:20] it's the small foxes that spoil the vine
[1:30:23] it's these simp things that we need to
[1:30:25] deal with that we need to root
[1:30:29] out and that we need to bring to the
[1:30:38] surface I want to make a
[1:30:41] statement you take it for what it's
[1:30:48] worth the price you may have to pay
[1:30:54] for truly giving your all to
[1:30:58] Christ there is a price to pay that
[1:31:01] comes with that I will not deny
[1:31:03] that but I assure
[1:31:07] you it will always be
[1:31:12] less than the price that you will pay if
[1:31:15] you don't give your
[1:31:20] all if you hold on to a little bit bit
[1:31:24] of
[1:31:27] selfishness and not pay that cost not
[1:31:32] pay that
[1:31:35] price whatever price that
[1:31:41] is one
[1:31:43] day you will have W you will wish that
[1:31:47] that's all you had to
[1:31:50] pay one day you'll want
[1:31:55] to just pay that price again even maybe
[1:31:57] even double
[1:31:58] that to not have to pay the price
[1:32:02] because you didn't give
[1:32:08] all I may be guilty of a lot of
[1:32:16] things I may be guilty of a lot of
[1:32:18] things but the one thing that I never
[1:32:27] the one thing that I
[1:32:31] never want to stand before my
[1:32:34] children and have to
[1:32:38] admit is that we're in this
[1:32:41] condition and we've got this
[1:32:44] problem because daddy didn't want to pay
[1:32:47] the
[1:32:48] price of doing what was
[1:32:51] right daddy didn't want to pay the price
[1:32:55] of giving up
[1:32:57] something I may be guilty of making
[1:32:59] mistakes no doubt I am no doubt I will
[1:33:03] be but I don't want one of them Youngs
[1:33:05] to come look me in the
[1:33:07] eye and say Daddy if you would have just
[1:33:10] done this we wouldn't be in this
[1:33:12] condition right
[1:33:17] now and furthermore I don't want to
[1:33:22] wait until that time to pay that
[1:33:26] price because no doubt there's going to
[1:33:28] be interest on
[1:33:31] that I want to take time to settle
[1:33:35] myself and to be
[1:33:38] quiet and examine my
[1:33:42] soul for any little selfish high school
[1:33:45] spirit that may be laying there in any
[1:33:48] aspect of my life and I want to deal
[1:33:51] with it
[1:33:52] now before I've got to pay that price
[1:33:55] plus
[1:33:57] interest Luke 9 says let these sayings
[1:34:00] sink down in your ears for the son of
[1:34:01] man shall be delivered into the hands of
[1:34:03] men but they understood not this saying
[1:34:05] and it was hid from them that they
[1:34:07] perceived it not and they feared to ask
[1:34:08] him of that saying then there arose a
[1:34:10] reasoning among them which of them
[1:34:12] should be the
[1:34:13] greatest and Jesus perceiving the
[1:34:15] thought of their heart took a child and
[1:34:17] set him by him and said unto them
[1:34:19] whosoever shall receive this child in my
[1:34:21] name receiveth me and whosoever shall
[1:34:23] receiveth shall receive me receiveth him
[1:34:25] that sent me for he that is least among
[1:34:27] you all the same shall be great and John
[1:34:30] answered and said Master we saw one let
[1:34:32] me stop there I'll get to that in a
[1:34:33] second you'll notice this started out
[1:34:36] they're walking around his disciples
[1:34:38] which wondering which one's the greatest
[1:34:40] of them and I know we've discussed this
[1:34:42] before but you tell me what motivated
[1:34:44] that you tell me how many little selfish
[1:34:47] High School Spirits was motivating that
[1:34:50] these are the Disciples of Christ
[1:34:52] following God around God in flesh and
[1:34:55] he's telling them the son of man shall
[1:34:57] be delivered into the hands of men and
[1:34:59] the scripture says they understood not
[1:35:01] this saying why do you think they didn't
[1:35:03] understand what he was
[1:35:07] saying cuz they're too busy trying to
[1:35:09] figure out who's got the best
[1:35:13] Ministry who's the
[1:35:15] greatest no wonder they can't figure out
[1:35:18] what he's
[1:35:20] saying 49 John answered and said
[1:35:24] Master we saw one casting out devils in
[1:35:27] thy name and we forbid him because he
[1:35:29] followed not with us and Jesus said unto
[1:35:32] him forbid him not for he that is not
[1:35:35] against us is for us this is
[1:35:39] John John type of the Bride is so stuck
[1:35:44] on himself that he wants to shut down
[1:35:46] healing campaigns because they're not
[1:35:48] associated with him that's
[1:35:52] right
[1:35:55] true I'm venturing to say I'm venturing
[1:35:58] to say that John didn't take time to
[1:35:59] settle himself and quiet himself and
[1:36:02] check his motive and objectives before
[1:36:03] he written and rebuked the brother and
[1:36:05] shut down his healing
[1:36:08] campaign you know what's terrifying
[1:36:11] about this is this selfish little
[1:36:14] selfish High School demon doesn't just
[1:36:17] stay in the natural and the
[1:36:21] carnal he's religious
[1:36:26] you can't do what you're doing for the
[1:36:28] kingdom of God because I haven't okayed
[1:36:33] it they're not at a ball game Saints
[1:36:36] they're not in a barroom they're not in
[1:36:38] a dance
[1:36:41] floor they are conducting the ministry
[1:36:45] of Christ and they come across the
[1:36:48] healing
[1:36:52] campaign and show shut it down because
[1:36:55] of a little selfish high school spirit
[1:36:58] that they haven't okayed it so it must
[1:36:59] not be okay surely if that was of God we
[1:37:03] would have known about it surely if this
[1:37:04] was of God we would have something to do
[1:37:06] with it surely if this was of
[1:37:12] God don't be helping the people
[1:37:18] brother I'm Excuse me I'm not getting
[1:37:22] any credit for what you're doing so
[1:37:23] please
[1:37:27] stop this is astounding to me like how
[1:37:32] do how do you get to that
[1:37:36] point how do you get to that
[1:37:39] point don't answer that yet because I
[1:37:41] got a couple more questions for
[1:37:44] you the blind
[1:37:47] man that is
[1:37:49] healed this is a blind man from his
[1:37:52] birth he's healed and the only thing the
[1:37:55] scribes and the Pharisees can say is
[1:37:58] that's clearly not of God because he did
[1:37:59] it on the Sabbath and who is that guy
[1:38:05] anyhow were they really concerned about
[1:38:08] who he was and what he was doing or were
[1:38:10] they concerned about their position
[1:38:12] being
[1:38:14] threatened why were they asking the
[1:38:16] question who made you whole who healed
[1:38:19] your eyes how did he do it was it
[1:38:21] because they really wanted to know so
[1:38:23] they could duplicate that or was it
[1:38:25] because they were concerned that you
[1:38:27] know what this guy's kind of got
[1:38:30] something we don't have and there is a
[1:38:33] lot of people interested in it right and
[1:38:36] we really need to put that new addition
[1:38:37] on the
[1:38:40] temple and we came up 20% short on the
[1:38:43] offerings this month because they were
[1:38:45] out with this
[1:38:50] guy what was their motivation what were
[1:38:54] they concerned about by asking their
[1:38:57] questions
[1:39:00] this the lame man that was healed same
[1:39:04] thing they couldn't even be happy for
[1:39:07] the poor guy right true this is a man
[1:39:11] who hasn't walked in years and now he
[1:39:13] can walk and he can rejoice and they
[1:39:15] can't even say praise the Lord we're
[1:39:16] happy for you who did this when did he
[1:39:19] do it he did it on the Sabbath he's
[1:39:21] clearly not of God he's a devil
[1:39:28] why would why did he have to be of the
[1:39:32] devil they hadn't even talked to him
[1:39:35] they hadn't even figured this out they
[1:39:36] haven't even say why did you do this why
[1:39:38] did you do it on there is no
[1:39:41] investigation but there's a verdict why
[1:39:44] because they needed that to be
[1:39:49] true you have Mary come with the
[1:39:51] alabaster box
[1:39:54] break it Judah says that's a
[1:39:57] waste we just lost all that money that
[1:39:59] we could have given to the
[1:40:02] poor we don't even have to wonder about
[1:40:04] the interpretation of this because it's
[1:40:06] written right in the scripture he said
[1:40:07] it because he was a thief at heart not
[1:40:09] that he cared anything about the
[1:40:15] poor there's two men possessed of
[1:40:18] devils Jesus casts them out and they go
[1:40:20] into a herd of swine run off a cliff
[1:40:24] there is no focus on the neighbor in the
[1:40:27] neighborhood about these two men who've
[1:40:29] been possessed of devils for year are
[1:40:31] now free clothed sitting in the right
[1:40:33] mind listening to a man talking about
[1:40:35] the gospel praise God let's have a party
[1:40:39] no the only concern is we ain't going to
[1:40:42] have no more
[1:40:44] bacon our pigs are gone our livelyhood
[1:40:47] is threatened right
[1:40:54] pigs versus two sons of
[1:40:57] God right
[1:41:03] pigs
[1:41:07] livelihood livelihood is what those pigs
[1:41:11] were rubber meat in the
[1:41:14] road you may not be a pig
[1:41:20] seller but how many times
[1:41:24] have we taken and chose our livelihood
[1:41:27] not being threatened over something that
[1:41:29] God's doing or something that God wants
[1:41:32] to
[1:41:33] do or a move that God wants us to
[1:41:36] make can't do that it'll threaten my
[1:41:46] livelihood Jesus tells a man follow
[1:41:49] me follow me God in flesh comes by your
[1:41:54] way and invites you to follow
[1:41:56] him and the man's response is can I stay
[1:42:00] and wait for my father to die and then
[1:42:01] bury him and then come with
[1:42:08] you he's more concerned about his
[1:42:12] relationship with his Earthly father
[1:42:15] than he is with
[1:42:20] God
[1:42:22] why
[1:42:24] selfishness it wasn't just a bad
[1:42:27] decision it was a demon at work it was a
[1:42:31] demon Jesus responds if he would have if
[1:42:34] we would say this nowadays we would be
[1:42:37] stoned Let the dead bury the dead follow
[1:42:40] thou
[1:42:44] me what if your pastor said
[1:42:48] that there's something that God needs
[1:42:51] doing but my parent is
[1:42:57] sick this is time sensitive it's for the
[1:42:59] kingdom of God let the dead bury the
[1:43:03] dead that would never fly nowadays would
[1:43:07] never fly
[1:43:09] nowadays Jesus didn't pull any punches
[1:43:11] with him you know why because he knew
[1:43:12] where his problem was at he knew where
[1:43:16] his problem late is this man is attached
[1:43:20] to his Earthly relationships rather than
[1:43:22] his heaven heavly his spiritual
[1:43:24] relationships and unless I deal with
[1:43:26] that first and unless he can overcome
[1:43:28] that
[1:43:29] first there's no need in him following
[1:43:32] me
[1:43:33] right but I find this so
[1:43:38] astounding that John would come across
[1:43:41] the healing campaign and and be so
[1:43:45] blinded by his own
[1:43:47] selfishness that he would shut down a
[1:43:49] healing campaign because of what he
[1:43:52] wanted
[1:43:54] that a blind man from birth can be given
[1:43:57] his sight and the only thing somebody's
[1:44:00] concerned about is when a man did it and
[1:44:03] how he did it and that he did it on the
[1:44:06] Sabbath like how can we not just be
[1:44:09] rejoicing that this man can now see how
[1:44:12] do we miss that part of the picture how
[1:44:15] can this lame man be made whole and
[1:44:18] we're not happy for him we're instantly
[1:44:20] looking for a way to condemn the man who
[1:44:22] did it and shut down that
[1:44:24] Ministry even evil people like you would
[1:44:29] think that
[1:44:30] just carnally you would grasp this of
[1:44:35] like look God forbid me if something's
[1:44:38] been done wrong but this man's been made
[1:44:41] whole God for forgive me if something
[1:44:45] wrong happened on the Sabbath I don't
[1:44:47] understand maybe everything the
[1:44:48] mechanics of it but praise God this man
[1:44:51] can see now
[1:44:53] Lord help me understand how it's
[1:44:55] permissible to do like I'll ask some
[1:44:57] questions okay I'll ask for
[1:44:58] understanding but you would just think
[1:45:00] conly your initial reaction would be to
[1:45:03] be happy for the
[1:45:06] person but when a demon comes in a
[1:45:11] demon now you say and you do things you
[1:45:15] would just not normally do that don't
[1:45:17] even make good human sense that's right
[1:45:21] because it's not just about bad
[1:45:23] characteristics it's a demon these
[1:45:26] individuals did not start out this
[1:45:29] callous there were selfish decisions
[1:45:32] made before they got to this point we
[1:45:36] don't want to get to the point that
[1:45:38] we're so callous that we cannot view
[1:45:40] things that just don't even make good
[1:45:42] common sense and take a wrong reaction
[1:45:45] to them we want to catch the white horse
[1:45:49] rider not the Pale Horse when he's
[1:45:52] coming or the black we want to catch
[1:45:54] this on the
[1:45:55] Forefront and lay before God and examine
[1:45:58] our hearts and root out any demon of
[1:46:01] selfishness that will be
[1:46:03] there we look at this and we would say
[1:46:06] these people are not even in their right
[1:46:09] mental faculties and I would say yay and
[1:46:12] amen to
[1:46:16] that but just because we're the bride
[1:46:20] doesn't mean that we can walk down the
[1:46:22] same path that that they walk down and
[1:46:23] make selfish decision after selfish
[1:46:25] decision after selfish decision and
[1:46:27] think we're not going to end up like
[1:46:30] that now by his grace we'll never end up
[1:46:33] on the Pale Horse I believe that that's
[1:46:35] by his grace but you can sure ride the
[1:46:38] black the the legs off of that black
[1:46:39] horse by making those kind of decisions
[1:46:42] and you can sure miss God's purpose in
[1:46:44] your life and being a help to your
[1:46:45] brothers and sisters and to this lost
[1:46:47] and Dying World by making those
[1:46:49] decisions like that and you can end up
[1:46:51] outside of your right mental faculties
[1:46:54] by selfish
[1:46:59] decisions they did not start out at that
[1:47:02] point Saints they ended up at that
[1:47:05] point through selfish
[1:47:08] decisions through protecting their
[1:47:10] livelihood through protecting their
[1:47:12] Prestige through protecting their
[1:47:19] position we can take
[1:47:24] this attitude and I know the quote's
[1:47:26] been mentioned here a few times of
[1:47:28] because we think we're bride that we're
[1:47:30] exempt from those things that we're
[1:47:33] exempt from sowing Bad Seed and reaping
[1:47:36] Bad Seed let me tell you I don't care
[1:47:39] whether you're bride or
[1:47:41] not your flesh has not changed
[1:47:46] yet
[1:47:47] right keep drinking two Mountain Dews a
[1:47:50] day and see what happens to your body
[1:47:54] right keep eating a court of ice cream
[1:47:57] every day and see what happens to your
[1:48:06] body I prayed over my Mountain Dew
[1:48:08] before I drink
[1:48:12] it what you're trying to do is bypass
[1:48:17] the man anointing remember brother Bram
[1:48:20] says the man anointing was just good
[1:48:22] common sense god-given
[1:48:24] knowledge they brought the the communion
[1:48:28] out and and said this is the literal
[1:48:30] body and blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:48:31] Luther said uh no it's
[1:48:35] not it's
[1:48:37] symbols what we do when we take that
[1:48:40] approach is we try to bypass the man
[1:48:42] anointing and go straight to the eagle
[1:48:44] anointing and just fly over a
[1:48:51] problems you can not bypass god-given
[1:48:55] sense to get to an eag anointing you
[1:48:58] can't bypass what you know is wrong or
[1:49:03] what you know to do that's right and
[1:49:05] just think he's going to anoint you with
[1:49:07] wings of eagles to fly over top of
[1:49:09] everything and that your body is not
[1:49:10] going to be subject to that that's right
[1:49:13] mistreat your body and see where you end
[1:49:16] up is there a promise of healing yes try
[1:49:21] approaching the Throne of God for the
[1:49:22] promise of healing after you've done
[1:49:25] something you know you shouldn't have
[1:49:26] done that's going to hurt your
[1:49:28] body where is your faith you first have
[1:49:31] got to come to Godly sorrowfulness and
[1:49:34] repent of that before you can ever
[1:49:35] approach the throne for
[1:49:37] healing and it's not that he won't heal
[1:49:39] you because he knows that we're Fallen
[1:49:42] human beings and he knows we're going to
[1:49:43] do things wrong and we're going to make
[1:49:45] mistakes and brother Randon says we're
[1:49:46] even going to willfully do things wrong
[1:49:49] not in our soul but caught up in our
[1:49:51] flesh and our spirit Realm
[1:49:53] and even then in his Mercy he'll still
[1:49:55] come and fulfill his
[1:49:58] promises but that is not the age that we
[1:50:01] live in Saints we are to be living in a
[1:50:03] bright age in a harvest age in a
[1:50:05] maturing age as our brother Kyle was
[1:50:07] talking
[1:50:08] about and why are we so mature that we
[1:50:11] can bypass good common sense of how to
[1:50:15] take care of our bodies which by the way
[1:50:17] the scripture says know ye not that is
[1:50:19] the Temple of the Holy Ghost and think
[1:50:23] because we're bride we're exempt and
[1:50:25] we're not going to reap bad bad seed or
[1:50:28] bad a bad Harvest when we've sewed Bad
[1:50:38] Seed there's been
[1:50:42] Decades of medical reports about what
[1:50:45] soft drinks does to your body and I'm
[1:50:47] not here to preach about soft drinks
[1:50:49] quite frankly I have no idea why I'm
[1:50:51] talking about soft drinks
[1:50:56] and I'm not saying if you have one every
[1:50:58] now and again that your body is going to
[1:51:00] fall apart and that you're
[1:51:03] lost I'm just saying don't think because
[1:51:06] you're the bride yeah that you can
[1:51:09] bypass common
[1:51:11] sense and then expect things to go
[1:51:15] okay you're going to find yourself broke
[1:51:18] up somewhere that's
[1:51:21] right yeah we have common sense to know
[1:51:25] that it's probably not appropriate to
[1:51:27] eat the whole pack of
[1:51:48] Oreos he has given us common sense to
[1:51:51] know how to possess our beings to
[1:51:54] possess our
[1:51:57] bodies God help
[1:52:01] me we will seek God for healing for back
[1:52:06] pain for
[1:52:07] years and the doctor has told us for
[1:52:10] years you need to lose
[1:52:14] weight but because we're
[1:52:17] selfish we won't want to change our
[1:52:19] eating habits and we won't do do what
[1:52:22] the doctor is that we went to the doctor
[1:52:24] for good advice and he gave us good
[1:52:26] advice and we won't do it and we because
[1:52:29] we're bride we're
[1:52:32] expect no possess your being possess
[1:52:36] your
[1:52:38] Tabernacle you say well that's easy for
[1:52:40] you to say you're a skinny little string
[1:52:42] bean Hey listen Lord have mercy I have
[1:52:46] no idea why
[1:52:48] we I'm sorry Pastor you got a lot of
[1:52:51] cleanup to do tonight
[1:52:55] and I'm preaching about weight on a
[1:52:57] potluck
[1:53:01] Sunday I am
[1:53:05] done I'm done I don't there's no coming
[1:53:09] back from
[1:53:15] this what I was going to say is you say
[1:53:17] it's easy for me to say that because I'm
[1:53:18] skinning
[1:53:20] whatever listen 2 years ago
[1:53:23] my back was hurting more than
[1:53:25] usual my church clothes were getting
[1:53:27] tight I've shared this with a c couple
[1:53:30] of you so don't start laughing
[1:53:33] yet I went and got on the scales and I
[1:53:35] was 168 lbs I have never been over a
[1:53:38] buck 50 never since like seventh grade
[1:53:45] never you say well Buck 50
[1:53:49] 168 not so much a big deal I'll say yeah
[1:53:52] maybe a point having to go shopping for
[1:53:55] a new church clothes is a big
[1:53:59] deal not
[1:54:01] happening not happening shoot me now I
[1:54:04] am not going church clothes
[1:54:10] shopping I was
[1:54:13] 168 and it snuck up on me and it was
[1:54:15] because I was setting more in what I was
[1:54:17] doing for work I was not as active and I
[1:54:20] was away from home a lot so I was eating
[1:54:22] out more and I'm a West Virginia Hill
[1:54:24] belly so when I pay for food I eat the
[1:54:28] food it doesn't matter if it was three
[1:54:30] times more than what I should have ate I
[1:54:32] am a member of God's bride it did not
[1:54:35] change for me and it will not change for
[1:54:37] you after two years of doing that I've
[1:54:40] got 18 pounds on me that shouldn't be on
[1:54:42] me 18 pounds percentage wise compared to
[1:54:45] one 150 of what I should have been is a
[1:54:48] huge percentage like I said I'm a dumb
[1:54:50] Hill belly so I can't tell you what that
[1:54:52] percentage is some of you already know
[1:54:53] what it is all I know is it's way too
[1:54:57] much but it snuck up on me I didn't
[1:54:59] realize that's what was happening and I
[1:55:02] was still exercising and you know
[1:55:03] running and you know doing my thing so I
[1:55:06] thought I was fine but I wasn't
[1:55:08] compensating for overeating Time After
[1:55:10] Time After Time After Time After
[1:55:13] Time I get a belly on me what happens
[1:55:17] when you start leaning forward more than
[1:55:18] you should your back's going to start
[1:55:19] hurting more than it should I get on the
[1:55:22] scale I'm 168 I said that is not
[1:55:24] happening I can deal with this I am not
[1:55:26] buying new church
[1:55:28] clothes I quit eating bread and I
[1:55:32] stopped
[1:55:33] overeating I did not drink some magical
[1:55:36] Miracle Juice I did not even have to use
[1:55:38] essential
[1:55:42] oils I stopped Ting and I quit eating
[1:55:47] bread I lost 15 PBS over like eight
[1:55:51] months I felt great said this is you
[1:55:55] know feeling really
[1:55:57] good I went on a three- week
[1:56:00] fast you say impossible no it's not I
[1:56:04] had to work my way into it slowly cut
[1:56:05] back what day I have no idea why I'm
[1:56:07] preaching this but praise
[1:56:09] God I slowly started cutting back on
[1:56:11] what I was eating four or five days your
[1:56:14] metabolism starts slowing down your
[1:56:16] stomach starts slowing down I'm not a
[1:56:17] medical doctor so I can't explain the
[1:56:19] process all I know in order for me to
[1:56:20] fast I have to work my way into it
[1:56:22] through three or 4 days by slowly
[1:56:23] cutting back what I'm eating day four or
[1:56:25] five I can shut down completely drink
[1:56:27] water maybe eat an apple every once in a
[1:56:29] while 3 weeks I was down to 138 felt
[1:56:36] amazing you know the one thing that I
[1:56:40] only did one
[1:56:43] time I never got asked God to heal my
[1:56:46] back pain and I never asked God to take
[1:56:49] this weight off of me supernaturally
[1:56:51] miraculously I knew God had laws and I
[1:56:54] knew God what God had revealed to me and
[1:56:56] I knew if I used common sense in the man
[1:56:58] anointing that he would anoint me with
[1:57:00] the wings of Eagle to fly over this
[1:57:01] problem and he
[1:57:03] did within a year I've lost 30
[1:57:08] PBS I've gained a little bit of that
[1:57:10] back because I've went back to eating
[1:57:13] probably stuff that I shouldn't and
[1:57:14] probably overeating a little bit but I'm
[1:57:16] at 149 and I don't plan to ever get
[1:57:19] above that because again we're not going
[1:57:22] church clothes
[1:57:23] shopping it's not happening sorry if you
[1:57:26] don't like this suit and my two other
[1:57:28] ones but that's all you're going to
[1:57:29] see you may see a new shirt every once
[1:57:32] in a while but that's
[1:57:36] it but I say that because I'm not
[1:57:38] preaching against
[1:57:40] sizes you God brother Brandon says God
[1:57:43] makes us all different shapes and sizes
[1:57:45] and Heights and whatever i'me I'm
[1:57:48] preaching principle of don't try to get
[1:57:51] to an anointing when you're bypassing a
[1:57:53] man anointing in good common sense and
[1:57:55] try to invoke that I bride God has to do
[1:57:58] something special for me when I'm
[1:58:00] violating all of these laws that he's
[1:58:02] laid before me the root of that is
[1:58:07] selfishness selfishness furthermore
[1:58:10] don't come pleading your case to the
[1:58:12] Saints Time After Time After Time After
[1:58:15] Time I need healing I need healing pray
[1:58:17] for me pray for me pray for me when you
[1:58:19] haven't even done what you know good and
[1:58:21] well you should do to take care of your
[1:58:23] body and when you haven't even touched
[1:58:27] the throne yourself for your own healing
[1:58:29] that's
[1:58:30] selfishness selfishness you pray for me
[1:58:32] you pray for me you pray for me why
[1:58:34] don't you pray for yourself you know why
[1:58:37] because you don't have confidence to do
[1:58:38] it cuz your heart's condemning you
[1:58:41] because you know good and well you're
[1:58:42] violating the principles of God and you
[1:58:44] have no rights to that promise don't
[1:58:47] don't come trying to plead the
[1:58:50] blood you're just wasting Lord I got to
[1:58:54] stop I know that's harsh Saints I'm
[1:58:56] sorry I don't mean it to be harsh I am
[1:58:58] truly
[1:59:00] sorry but the principle is
[1:59:05] true you stick your face in social media
[1:59:09] for eight hours a day you stick your
[1:59:12] face in entertainment Time After Time
[1:59:14] After Time After Time and then come
[1:59:16] invoking the prayer of the Saints
[1:59:18] because you're in spiritual famine and
[1:59:20] you need God to deliver you from this
[1:59:21] and that this and all these demons in
[1:59:23] your
[1:59:25] head don't do it it's
[1:59:28] selfishness get your face out of social
[1:59:32] media get your face out of the
[1:59:34] television get your face out of
[1:59:36] Hollywood and then if those demons are
[1:59:39] still lurking around we'll deal with
[1:59:40] them and we'll deal with them with
[1:59:43] faith but not because you're violating
[1:59:45] all the principles of God and what the
[1:59:47] prophet has taught you to keep your nose
[1:59:49] out of that
[1:59:50] stuff don't think because you're bride

[1:59:54] not cuz I'm not to judge if you say
[1:59:57] you're bride I believe you're bride but
[1:59:59] don't try to say that because you're
[2:00:01] bride you can do all of that things and
[2:00:02] it won't make you lose your mind it
[2:00:05] will
[2:00:08] amen you are not exempt from that I am

[2:00:16] that those demons are
[2:00:18] real and they will take your sanity and
[2:00:21] your wellbeing away from
[2:00:25] you and it's not just the social media
[2:00:30] Saints oh
[2:00:33] Lord I've preached about weight on a
[2:00:36] potluck I guess I can preach about
[2:00:37] anything but you sisters on Snapchat and
[2:00:43] WhatsApp do you know every time that
[2:00:46] that phone goes ding it releases a
[2:00:47] hormone in your brain and it releases uh
[2:00:52] cortis not cortisone whatever it is you
[2:00:54] all can figure out what it is it
[2:00:56] releases a hormone and what that hormone
[2:00:59] does is it brings excitement and it
[2:01:01] stimulates you and you oh I got a
[2:01:03] message somebody cares about me somebody
[2:01:04] wants to talk to me and now you have
[2:01:06] that 250 times a day and wonder why you
[2:01:09] can't settle down and sleep at night is
[2:01:12] because you've overloaded yourself with
[2:01:14] WhatsApp messages talking about what
[2:01:16] clothes you've got to
[2:01:17] sell and what's going on in the
[2:01:19] neighborhood
[2:01:25] and want to say well I'm
[2:01:27] bride I should have peaceful sleep at
[2:01:30] night follow the principles of God and
[2:01:32] you
[2:01:36] will it's not just social media Saints I
[2:01:39] am becoming more and more and more and
[2:01:41] more convinced that these things right
[2:01:42] here are of the
[2:01:49] devil I get case after case after case
[2:01:52] after case of
[2:01:54] people having people following them and
[2:01:56] stalking them and harassing them and
[2:01:58] putting chips in their brain and
[2:01:59] listening to conversations they've had
[2:02:01] and when I go to their house and I talk
[2:02:03] to them and they want me to check their
[2:02:04] house for listening devices and cameras
[2:02:06] and blah blah blah blah blah they can't
[2:02:09] even put this thing down while I'm
[2:02:13] there constantly feeding that through
[2:02:17] that and then they wonder why they're
[2:02:18] hearing
[2:02:20] voices and why they think people's
[2:02:22] stalking
[2:02:24] them well it's probably because you did
[2:02:27] 25 searches about the toaster oven on
[2:02:29] Google and now it's wanting to sell you
[2:02:30] a toaster oven yeah not somebody
[2:02:33] listening in your
[2:02:39] bedroom we cannot do what the world does
[2:02:43] and expect a different result than the
[2:02:46] world am our flesh is still hybrid it
[2:02:50] still has to change
[2:02:52] and we still are obligated to under the
[2:02:55] laws of
[2:02:58] God at the bottom of it is
[2:03:02] selfishness we want to feed that demon
[2:03:05] of entertainment so we'll do it and then
[2:03:08] we'll pray for the side effects not to
[2:03:13] come if you have faith in that
[2:03:17] prayer I have no idea how and you
[2:03:19] certainly don't after today
[2:03:25] amen under that six seal the things that
[2:03:28] are coming on this Earth brother
[2:03:30] brandham says are not real they are in
[2:03:34] the person's imaginary
[2:03:40] mind you treat your imaginary mind your
[2:03:44] spirit realm your eyeballs watch the
[2:03:47] same eyeballs that everybody in the
[2:03:48] world does everything that the world
[2:03:51] does and think that you're not going to
[2:03:53] be one of the ones seeing bats with long
[2:03:55] hair flying around chasing
[2:03:57] you you've swed the same seed you're
[2:04:00] going to get the same
[2:04:05] result if you're sitting here today with
[2:04:08] mental oppression and depression and
[2:04:10] anxiety I would tell you the first thing
[2:04:12] you need to do is get rid of
[2:04:16] this and I'm not saying
[2:04:19] fanatical I run a business so I'm tied
[2:04:21] to mine I can't give it up but I'll tell
[2:04:23] you what I will that I will guard
[2:04:26] against is when I pick this up it's for
[2:04:29] business purposes it's not so that I can
[2:04:32] spend eight hours
[2:04:34] seeing whatever is on
[2:04:39] whatever like you can't even pick it up
[2:04:42] and there's something coming into it
[2:04:44] they're trying to sell me women's
[2:04:48] clothing I've never shopped for women's
[2:04:51] clothing CL and why do I need to see ads
[2:04:54] for women
[2:04:57] clothing you know why is because if
[2:05:00] they'll show me an ad for a woman's
[2:05:02] clothes maybe there'll be something
[2:05:04] there that'll catch the lust of the
[2:05:10] eye it's not cause Satan thinks he's
[2:05:13] going to get me to buy women's clothing
[2:05:16] it's because he wants me to see
[2:05:17] something that will catch the lust of
[2:05:19] the eye and now we go down at don't oh
[2:05:22] you're bride you're exempt from that
[2:05:23] right no you're
[2:05:26] not the prophet carried a cross in his
[2:05:28] car and looked at it so that he wouldn't
[2:05:30] have wrong thoughts right never said the
[2:05:33] wrong thoughts didn't come it's so that
[2:05:34] he would look at that cross and remember
[2:05:36] and Corral them and bring them under
[2:05:38] subjection to the
[2:05:39] word don't think Facebook ads and social
[2:05:42] media ads and Google ads
[2:05:45] and that you're exempt from that it'll
[2:05:48] take you down a trail you don't want to
[2:05:49] go down that's true and Satan will do it
[2:05:54] because he knows it works he wouldn't be
[2:05:56] trying to do it if he didn't know that
[2:05:57] it wouldn't
[2:06:02] work I got to move on the point is don't
[2:06:05] sew Bad Seed and expect good crop even
[2:06:08] if you're
[2:06:10] bride be honest with God be real with
[2:06:16] God come through all the anointings
[2:06:18] apply the pure word of God

[2:06:25] will to the pure word of God apply the
[2:06:28] man anointing Lord what can I do what is
[2:06:32] my remember brother Rand says you have a
[2:06:34] part to play that's right there's
[2:06:35] something you can do yes sir Lord what
[2:06:38] can I do to fulfill your word in this
[2:06:41] situation and Lord now that I've done
[2:06:43] everything that I know to do you've got
[2:06:45] to come and pick me up above this
[2:06:47] situation you have got to supernaturally
[2:06:49] come on the scene and help me
[2:06:52] amen if you will come through those
[2:06:54] first three anointings you'll have no
[2:06:56] problem getting help from the fourth
[2:06:58] one cuz he's a heavenly father that
[2:07:00] loves us that will do
[2:07:06] that I've been lengthy but if you'll
[2:07:08] bear with me just let's stand up for a
[2:07:11] second let's stand up I'm too far into
[2:07:15] this to stop and do another service so
[2:07:18] if you'll just change your position get
[2:07:20] your blood circulating
[2:07:24] I'll I'll wrap this up shortly I promise
[2:07:26] but I don't just want to leave this
[2:07:29] right
[2:07:31] here in the Sixth Seal brother random
[2:07:35] says now the fifth seal Matthew
[2:07:38] 24913 so this is when he's going back
[2:07:40] and forth and comparing the seals that
[2:07:42] were in Matthew when Jesus was speaking
[2:07:44] about them to where they are in
[2:07:45] Revelation he's comparing the the
[2:07:47] scriptures back and forth and he's he's
[2:07:49] reading from Matthew he says and then
[2:07:51] shall the deliver you up to be afflicted
[2:07:53] and shall kill you and he says there you
[2:07:57] are he's talking about the fifth seal
[2:08:01] and then they shall deliver you up to be
[2:08:03] afflicted and shall kill you there you
[2:08:06] are and ye shall be hated of all Nations
[2:08:09] for my name's sake and then many shall
[2:08:11] be offended and shall betray one another
[2:08:13] and shall hate one another and many
[2:08:15] false prophet shall rise and deceive
[2:08:17] many and because iniquity shall abound
[2:08:19] the love of many shall wax cold but he
[2:08:21] that endures to the end the same shall
[2:08:23] be saved now we're on the fifth seal now
[2:08:26] and that was last night see so you see
[2:08:28] what he's tying it to this scripture in
[2:08:32] Matthew of their of them killing
[2:08:36] you he
[2:08:38] says they will deliver you up betray one
[2:08:41] to another now let's get that one
[2:08:43] Revelation 6:9 now he's moving into the
[2:08:45] Book of Revelation on the fifth seal and
[2:08:47] when he had opened the fifth seal I saw
[2:08:49] under the altar Souls of them that were
[2:08:51] slain for the word of God and for the
[2:08:53] testimony which they held and they cried
[2:08:55] with a loud voice saying how long Lord
[2:08:57] holy true dust thou judge and avenge our
[2:09:00] judge and avenge our blood on them that
[2:09:02] dwell on the earth now and white robes
[2:09:04] were given to every one of them and it
[2:09:05] was said unto them that they should rest
[2:09:07] for a little season until their fellow
[2:09:08] servants also and their Brethren should
[2:09:10] be killed as they were should be
[2:09:11] fulfilled now you see under the fifth
[2:09:15] seal we find here
[2:09:20] martyrdom and under Matthew 29 249 to13
[2:09:24] we find also that it was
[2:09:27] martyr they shall deliver you up and
[2:09:29] kill you and so forth see the same seal
[2:09:33] being open so he comes to the Sixth Seal
[2:09:36] he's reviewing the fifth seal and he's
[2:09:38] saying there you are see it's killing
[2:09:41] it's
[2:09:47] martyrdom in the church age book brother
[2:09:50] random says but the
[2:09:52] crown spoken of here in Revelation given
[2:09:55] to the Martyr is the crown of royalty
[2:09:58] Jesus calls it the Crown of Life The One
[2:10:02] Crown is for those who have
[2:10:06] striven the other is for those who have
[2:10:13] given both crowns are Incorruptible they
[2:10:16] will not perish the winners of the
[2:10:18] worldly race of life will soon lose the
[2:10:20] joys of the plot and of the world their
[2:10:22] Glory will fail but those who give their
[2:10:25] lives for God either
[2:10:27] by either by daily
[2:10:31] striving remember this is the fifth seal
[2:10:33] we're talking
[2:10:35] about either by daily striving or
[2:10:39] shedding their blood as the crowning
[2:10:40] sacrifice of their lives will be given
[2:10:43] the Crown of Life all too little time is
[2:10:46] spent on laboring for the Eternal
[2:10:49] rewards of God the recompense of God is
[2:10:51] too lightly esteemed if we believe in
[2:10:54] the reality of the resurrection of the
[2:10:56] body and an eternal Kingdom of substance
[2:10:59] then we ought to lay up in heaven those
[2:11:01] good Treasures that are available to the
[2:11:03] faithful Saints as you would have your
[2:11:05] seats so he's talking about the fifth
[2:11:08] seal and he's
[2:11:11] saying that it's directly tied to
[2:11:16] marome you said I just thought that was
[2:11:18] the Jews under the altar the martyrdom
[2:11:19] it was but brother and brings in another
[2:11:22] Crown of Life and he says the same crown
[2:11:25] that those are given is the same Crown
[2:11:28] you will be given if you catch the
[2:11:31] Revelation under this fifth seal and
[2:11:34] daily give your life you receive the
[2:11:37] same reward right you see well I thought
[2:11:40] the fifth seal was the souls Under The
[2:11:41] Altar and Heavenly
[2:11:43] representation
[2:11:45] and it
[2:11:49] is an election and God's grace g r a c e
[2:11:54] 5 Grace but listen to this paragraph
[2:11:57] 3:19 the fifth seal
[2:12:01] five if you know your numerous of the
[2:12:03] Bible five is the number of laboring
[2:12:09] Grace we knew it was the number of
[2:12:12] Grace laboring Grace and that's what he
[2:12:16] has done now watch you want to know
[2:12:18] where it is was Jesus a labor of Grace j
[2:12:23] s u s 5 l a b o r is that right labor
[2:12:29] for love for you and if you get to him
[2:12:33] how do you come by what F AI t h n l a b
[2:12:40] o r faith in labor is the Revelation one
[2:12:46] of the revelations under this fifth seal
[2:12:48] that will bring you to a Crown of Life
[2:12:50] the same crown that the martys received
[2:12:52] faith in
[2:12:56] labor
[2:12:58] labor labor in what
[2:13:02] daily
[2:13:04] striving not my will but thine be done
[2:13:09] that's the labor that Christ
[2:13:11] did not my will but thine be done also
[2:13:16] known as giving up all
[2:13:19] selfishness amen selfishness under the
[2:13:22] fifth seal I thought it was deeper than
[2:13:25] that it is right but it's also as simple
[2:13:29] as that
[2:13:30] amen faith in
[2:13:34] labor the Thunder underneath the
[2:13:37] seals
[2:13:42] 1959 all the days of our life brother
[2:13:44] Brenham says I trust that the church
[2:13:46] will understand
[2:13:48] this that we have no right
[2:13:51] to use our own thinking about
[2:13:55] things when we become Christians we
[2:13:58] totally surrender every bit of our
[2:14:00] mental powers to God and follow after
[2:14:02] his leading and as long as we try to go
[2:14:05] after our own feelings then we are using
[2:14:07] the Fallen state of the
[2:14:11] being I trust that the church will
[2:14:14] understand this that we have no
[2:14:18] right to use our own thinking about
[2:14:20] things
[2:14:21] 1963 the token he says and you are not
[2:14:24] yourself no more you are Christ remember
[2:14:26] we're talking about selfishness a demon
[2:14:29] of selfishness and how do we combat that
[2:14:32] remember you are not yourself no more
[2:14:34] you are Christ you don't think your
[2:14:36] thoughts you don't think your thoughts
[2:14:38] you say I think you have no thought
[2:14:48] coming that's pretty much exactly
[2:14:51] opposite of everything our culture
[2:14:53] teaches
[2:14:56] us it's all about what you think and how
[2:15:00] you feel that's right and what you want
[2:15:04] to be
[2:15:08] today a prophet says a Christian doesn't
[2:15:12] have a thought coming you say you think
[2:15:16] you have no thought coming the life that
[2:15:18] was in Christ is in you the mind that
[2:15:21] was in Christ is in you the works that
[2:15:22] was in Christ is in you and Christ
[2:15:24] himself is in you you are dead your life
[2:15:28] is hidden God through Christ sealed him
[2:15:30] there by the Holy Ghost you are not your
[2:15:33] own I think we need to grasp a really
[2:15:35] firm revelation of
[2:15:37] that we were bought with a price and
[2:15:40] I'll remind you that that price was the
[2:15:42] literal blood of God and we want to
[2:15:46] think that we have a thought coming and
[2:15:49] that we have a decision to make
[2:15:53] you are not your own you were purchased
[2:15:56] with a
[2:15:58] price your decision is
[2:16:02] only to lay down your
[2:16:06] decision and seek what his decision is
[2:16:09] amen that's the only rights that we
[2:16:14] have I want you to listen to this quote
[2:16:18] it's out of Christ The Mystery of God
[2:16:19] revealed it's very very familiar to us
[2:16:22] and we're going to skip over a couple of
[2:16:24] the paragraphs just for time sake but I
[2:16:27] want you but we so often reference this
[2:16:30] we so often reference this but I want
[2:16:31] you to hear it with your ears here this
[2:16:34] morning um go ahead brother
[2:16:38] Franco now for a
[2:16:41] text I want to take out of there this
[2:16:45] for a text basing it upon the entire
[2:16:49] Bible but I wanted
[2:16:52] title
[2:16:54] this Christ is the mystery of God
[2:16:58] revealed Christ being the mystery of God
[2:17:01] revealed now uh took it in order as a
[2:17:04] Sunday school lesson so we could all
[2:17:06] read together and and uh have this
[2:17:10] Fellowship
[2:17:12] together
[2:17:14] now God's secret
[2:17:17] mystery he had before the world began
[2:17:21] now back in the back part of God's
[2:17:25] mind there was something that he was
[2:17:28] trying and was going to
[2:17:31] achieve and he had a
[2:17:34] motive and doing it in order to let
[2:17:37] himself be
[2:17:39] expressed so in his great mind he wanted
[2:17:44] these
[2:17:45] attributes to be
[2:17:47] expressed now God had a purpose and a
[2:17:53] hidden Mystery and that's what I want to
[2:17:56] speak on to the church this morning the
[2:17:58] hidden Mystery of God that he had in his
[2:18:01] mind before the world ever began and how
[2:18:04] that it's unfolded itself right down to
[2:18:07] this present hour that we're
[2:18:09] living so we're all familiar with
[2:18:13] this I want to highlight a couple things
[2:18:16] for a text I want to take out of there
[2:18:18] this morning basing it upon the entire
[2:18:21] Bible you ever heard a theologian talk
[2:18:24] like that this morning I'm going to base
[2:18:28] what I'm going to say on the entire
[2:18:32] Bible he says now God's secret mystery
[2:18:35] he had before the world began now back
[2:18:38] in the back part of God's
[2:18:42] mind not just in his
[2:18:45] mind but back in the back part of God's
[2:18:50] mind
[2:18:51] there was something he was trying and
[2:18:52] going to
[2:18:55] achieve now God had a purpose and a
[2:18:57] hidden Mystery and that's what I want to
[2:18:58] speak to the church on this morning the
[2:19:01] hidden Mystery of God that he had in his
[2:19:03] mind before the world ever began now I'm
[2:19:05] not going to ask you to raise your hands
[2:19:08] but in your heart I want you to really
[2:19:10] really honest before God as you know how
[2:19:14] ask
[2:19:16] yourself do you believe what this man's
[2:19:19] saying
[2:19:22] do you
[2:19:24] believe this
[2:19:27] minister is standing before a group of
[2:19:30] people in
[2:19:32] 1963 and has the
[2:19:35] ability to speak about the entire Bible
[2:19:39] in one
[2:19:40] service and reveal to the
[2:19:43] people what almighty God had in the back
[2:19:48] part of his mind before there was
[2:19:52] anything I'm not asking you to say Amen
[2:19:55] I'm not asking you to raise your hand
[2:19:57] I'm asking you in the deepest part of
[2:20:01] your soul that you can get
[2:20:05] into do you really believe
[2:20:10] that I mean really really truly believe
[2:20:16] that this is a bold statement there is
[2:20:20] no no man ever made a statement like
[2:20:23] this do we
[2:20:26] really believe
[2:20:35] that I find it
[2:20:40] astounding that people will tell me they
[2:20:42] believe
[2:20:46] that and then conduct their personal
[2:20:49] lives in a way that is
[2:20:53] opposite of other things that that
[2:20:55] Minister
[2:20:58] taught
[2:21:00] and say well I think that might have
[2:21:02] just been his
[2:21:07] opinion it would have been better for
[2:21:09] you never to have confessed that you
[2:21:11] believe he can tap into the back part of
[2:21:12] God's
[2:21:13] mind the moment you confess that you
[2:21:16] believe he has the ability to tap into
[2:21:18] the back part of God's mind you ain't
[2:21:21] got no thought
[2:21:23] coming I have no thought coming now if I
[2:21:27] don't believe that you still got a
[2:21:28] thought coming think whatever you want
[2:21:30] but the moment that you admit that God
[2:21:33] in his grace and in his Mercy not only
[2:21:36] sent us a gift but he sent us a prophet
[2:21:38] and came himself and was so gracious and
[2:21:42] merciful that he would let a minister
[2:21:45] stand and speak in our own language and
[2:21:47] say that I'm going to reveal to you this
[2:21:50] morning what God Almighty had in the
[2:21:52] back part of my of his mind and
[2:21:55] something Rings true in our heart and we
[2:21:56] say yay and amen I'm going to listen I
[2:21:58] think that he can do
[2:22:01] that all selfishness is done there is no
[2:22:05] more covering for
[2:22:07] it because let me ask you this what if
[2:22:10] it was just his
[2:22:13] opinion do you have a better
[2:22:17] one honestly you don't even have to
[2:22:20] respond responders during this time of
[2:22:21] the service I'm not even going to ask
[2:22:23] for it I want you to answer that
[2:22:28] question what if it was just his
[2:22:31] opinion do you have a do you think
[2:22:36] somehow that you have the capability to
[2:22:40] have a better different opinion than a
[2:22:43] minister that tapped into the back part
[2:22:48] of God's mind
[2:22:52] do you think for one second
[2:22:56] somehow you have a better idea of what's
[2:23:01] permissible in marriage and divorce
[2:23:04] right I had a brother ask me this
[2:23:08] and it just blew me away he says what do
[2:23:12] I do what do I do when I come to these
[2:23:15] parts of the message and I just don't
[2:23:16] necessarily agree with what brother
[2:23:17] brandham is teaching
[2:23:25] I can't help that
[2:23:29] person I can't help them because I can't
[2:23:33] sympathize with them I have no ability
[2:23:36] to understand what they're saying right
[2:23:39] and I do not say that to lift myself up
[2:23:42] I can just only say that by the absolute
[2:23:46] mercy and grace of
[2:23:49] God but I can stand here before you with
[2:23:52] an honest heart and tell you there has
[2:23:54] never been a day in my life that every
[2:23:56] word that came out of that man's mouth I
[2:23:58] didn't say yay and amen to and I'm not
[2:24:00] saying I had a proper understanding of
[2:24:02] it and that I understood the depths of
[2:24:04] it but I'm just telling you even as a
[2:24:06] grade school kid I went to school
[2:24:08] quoting the
[2:24:09] prophet and whatever he said was truth
[2:24:13] even when I didn't understand it so when
[2:24:15] somebody comes and they say I have a
[2:24:17] different opinion about what's something
[2:24:19] the brother brandom taught
[2:24:20] I can't go there I have no ability to go
[2:24:24] there and I'm not saying that there's
[2:24:27] like I'm not saying this brother is a
[2:24:29] bad brother I'm sure he's a good brother
[2:24:31] and I'm not saying that you're bad if
[2:24:33] you've ever had that I'm just saying the
[2:24:35] upbringing that I had I was raised
[2:24:38] listening to this voice as a kid I was
[2:24:41] born and raised in the message I heard
[2:24:43] the tapes I heard the voice and it just
[2:24:45] always rang
[2:24:46] true and even when I didn't live it it
[2:24:49] was still true it's not because that I
[2:24:51] had a better
[2:24:54] idea I did stuff wrong I made wrong
[2:24:58] decisions I needed a new birth I needed
[2:25:00] to be converted I need the demon of
[2:25:02] selfishness out of me I needed the demon
[2:25:04] of Pride out of me but it did not change
[2:25:06] the fact that I would always confess
[2:25:08] whatever he said was fact and true yay
[2:25:10] and amen even if it was his opinion I
[2:25:13] don't have a better opinion because when
[2:25:15] that man walks to the pull pit and says
[2:25:16] I've tapped into the back part of God's
[2:25:18] mind and my soul says yay and amen I
[2:25:20] don't have an
[2:25:21] opinion I may be a dumb hellbelly but
[2:25:24] I'm smarter than that if he's tapped
[2:25:27] into the back part of God's mind how in
[2:25:29] the world do I think I've got a better
[2:25:32] idea of what God might like what might
[2:25:36] be more pleasing or acceptable to
[2:25:40] God and this brother told me that and I
[2:25:42] said brother like what are you talking
[2:25:45] about he's like well like for
[2:25:46] interracial marriage and things like I
[2:25:47] just don't see that I don't agree with
[2:25:49] that and I said said
[2:25:51] well I don't like you'll have to pray
[2:25:54] about it you'll have to deal with it
[2:25:55] like if brother brandom tells me that
[2:25:57] the sky is green and the grass is blue
[2:26:01] then I say praise God the sky is green
[2:26:05] and the grass is blue and he says well
[2:26:08] God would never expect us to believe
[2:26:09] anything like
[2:26:13] that God would never expect you to
[2:26:15] believe something that your eyes told
[2:26:17] you was different
[2:26:21] right I said brother I'm sorry but I
[2:26:24] just can't relate to that I said if
[2:26:26] brother brandom says that the sky is
[2:26:28] green and the grass is blue it's super
[2:26:30] simple for me I've been collar blind my
[2:26:32] whole
[2:26:35] life there's not a problem here God's
[2:26:38] not asking me to believe anything that
[2:26:41] is
[2:26:42] wrong it's my eyes were have been wrong
[2:26:45] my entire life and now I've had my eyes
[2:26:49] properly interpreted to me I have no
[2:26:52] ability to interpret it to myself if
[2:26:56] he has interpreted something I have no
[2:27:01] opinion on
[2:27:02] it and even if he says I think in all
[2:27:05] reality that the sky is green and the
[2:27:07] grass is
[2:27:09] blue guess what my opinion
[2:27:11] is my eyes are not functioning properly
[2:27:15] because I'm still seeing greenish grass
[2:27:17] and bluish Skies God help me to have my
[2:27:22] vision adjusted to match your vision cuz
[2:27:24] this now look Saints I'm not talking if
[2:27:26] he says I like this belt buckle and I
[2:27:28] got to have it okay I don't even like
[2:27:31] belt buckles I don't feel that I have he
[2:27:33] liked this certain kind of pocket knife
[2:27:35] and now I he he liked this certain kind
[2:27:37] of gun I'm not talking
[2:27:39] fanaticism I'm talking a spiritual
[2:27:44] principles when a prophet comes on the
[2:27:46] scene who's tapped into the back part of
[2:27:48] God mind and he's laying spiritual
[2:27:51] principles to
[2:27:54] us and we confess that we believe he's
[2:27:57] tapped into the back part of his mind
[2:27:59] but we'll get hung up on something that
[2:28:01] he mentions his opinion
[2:28:05] on when we'll use one quote as an excuse
[2:28:09] to wear
[2:28:12] makeup what did he tell you go was
[2:28:15] pleasing to
[2:28:16] God was for you to be natural I would
[2:28:19] rather walk walk into church every
[2:28:21] Sunday and walk in public every day with
[2:28:23] pock marks all over my face looking like
[2:28:26] I'd run sandpaper all over me knowing
[2:28:28] that I was in the perfect will of God
[2:28:30] then I would have makeup on me knowing
[2:28:32] that I was presenting a false face and
[2:28:34] outside of the will of God the reason
[2:28:36] you got to wear makeup is only one
[2:28:37] reason it's
[2:28:40] Pride reason you wear tight
[2:28:44] clothes
[2:28:46] Pride selfishness you need to look a
[2:28:48] little bit better than somebody else
[2:28:50] these simple things that he's taught
[2:28:53] us these simple things that he's taught
[2:28:56] us it goes back to the same things pride
[2:28:59] and
[2:29:03] selfishness now look I know that's maybe
[2:29:05] some harsh
[2:29:07] statements but I want to follow that up
[2:29:10] with this I UND I'm not here preaching
[2:29:13] marriage and divorce and trying to clear
[2:29:15] all that up I know and I understand that
[2:29:19] there is people to ignorance of proper
[2:29:21] teaching beforehand and they're in
[2:29:23] situations that they maybe would not be
[2:29:25] in right now if they had been taught
[2:29:26] properly I am not doing away with grace
[2:29:29] for that if you didn't know better you
[2:29:31] didn't know
[2:29:33] better I'm I'm not saying that we need
[2:29:35] to go as brother R said and fix all this
[2:29:37] stuff we ain't got time to fix all this
[2:29:39] stuff if you did it
[2:29:42] knowingly you're going to have to fix it
[2:29:45] if it was done in ignorance there was
[2:29:47] Grace given for that and I'm not about
[2:29:48] to take that Grace away
[2:29:51] and I don't want to go too much farther
[2:29:53] on that because that's not my position I
[2:29:55] not the pastor
[2:29:56] here I'm just simply relaying a
[2:29:58] principle that there were things that
[2:30:01] brother brandham expressed his opinion
[2:30:04] about but there was Authority that came
[2:30:07] with that that we accept and I find it
[2:30:12] odd that we will accept that he tapped
[2:30:16] into the back part of God's mind and
[2:30:19] that he can express his opinions about
[2:30:21] everything else and we'll agree with it
[2:30:23] unless it's something that we don't
[2:30:25] really want or we don't really like or
[2:30:28] it's something we want to hold on
[2:30:31] to Let's Not Be double-faced
[2:30:34] he either tapped into the back part of
[2:30:37] God's mind and knew what was pleasing to
[2:30:40] God and expressed that to us or he
[2:30:47] didn't Psalms 4610
[2:30:50] there's a reason this was over top of
[2:30:52] the pulpit at the brandham
[2:30:54] Tabernacle Psalms 46:10 says be
[2:30:58] still and know that I am
[2:31:00] God you will never truly have the full
[2:31:03] revelation of him being God if you can't
[2:31:07] first get rid of your own selfishness
[2:31:10] and your own pride and be still our
[2:31:14] culture today tells us talk talk talk
[2:31:16] talk talk everybody's got an opinion
[2:31:18] everybody's got something to say
[2:31:21] the scripture says opposite the
[2:31:23] scripture says Be
[2:31:25] Still quiet yourself know that I am God
[2:31:30] Matthew 1236 says but I say unto you
[2:31:33] that Every Idle Word that a man speak
[2:31:36] they shall give an account thereof in
[2:31:37] the day of judgment for by thy words
[2:31:40] shall thou be justified and by thy words
[2:31:43] shall they be
[2:31:45] condemned remember this whole pride and
[2:31:50] selfishness this testing to brother
[2:31:52] Brandon preluded the third pole coming
[2:31:54] into existence preluded the spoken word
[2:31:57] being released to
[2:31:59] him do you think that that would have
[2:32:02] ever moved
[2:32:03] forward if he hadn't first learned how
[2:32:06] to be
[2:32:07] still and know that he was God to know
[2:32:11] that God was God he has first got to
[2:32:14] come to that recognition that I as a
[2:32:18] minister I've got to be still there is
[2:32:21] gifts in my life there's things that I
[2:32:23] can do but I have got to be
[2:32:26] still first and know that he is
[2:32:30] God I'm going to skip to the end of this
[2:32:32] and then we're going to
[2:32:41] close I'm sorry to have kept you so long
[2:32:44] we'll be done in 10
[2:32:46] minutes brother brandom is relaying the
[2:32:48] story of Hope
[2:32:51] dying he says friends if I live a
[2:32:53] hundred years I'll never forget what
[2:32:55] happened those two bring big brown eyes
[2:32:57] looked up at me she was so weak she
[2:32:59] couldn't say nothing she was smiling she
[2:33:02] took her finger and she motions and I
[2:33:03] got down and she said why did you call
[2:33:06] me honey and I said well I I don't know
[2:33:09] she said I was in another land and it
[2:33:11] was so peaceful I wasn't suffering she
[2:33:13] said great big birds like a great Orion
[2:33:15] she said there was a man dressed in
[2:33:17] white one on each side taking me home
[2:33:19] old friend there's a land somewhere I
[2:33:22] believe she was as she was dying her
[2:33:24] eyes just opened up to see Paradise
[2:33:26] Beyond she rallied for a little bit the
[2:33:28] nurse came in and she said nurse come
[2:33:30] over now remember we're talking about
[2:33:32] the demon a demon of selfishness but now
[2:33:35] we're talking about a dying woman on her
[2:33:38] deathbed who's already slipped into the
[2:33:41] sixth Dimension and been pulled back out
[2:33:43] and she's on her way back into the sixth
[2:33:45] Dimension Now watch how she conducts
[2:33:48] herself
[2:33:50] she said nurse come over she Saidi hope
[2:33:53] when you get married you'll have a
[2:33:55] husband like
[2:33:56] mine I said oh honey I haven't done
[2:33:59] nothing she said oh bless your heart she
[2:34:01] patted me on the back nurse turned
[2:34:02] around walked out crying she said bill I
[2:34:04] want I want to tell you a few things
[2:34:07] said I'm going said don't
[2:34:10] cry I said all
[2:34:13] right this is a dying woman this is a
[2:34:17] dying wife this is a dying mother
[2:34:20] she is not playing
[2:34:22] games she is not putting on she is not
[2:34:26] mincing her
[2:34:28] words don't let my babies be pulled from
[2:34:31] Pillar To
[2:34:35] Post that don't sound selfish to
[2:34:39] me this is a dying woman she's concerned
[2:34:43] about the well-being of her
[2:34:45] babies don't let my babies be pulled
[2:34:48] from Pillar To Post
[2:34:51] she said I've got some things to confess
[2:34:53] to
[2:34:55] you I saidwhat is it she said do you
[2:34:59] remember one time you were going fishing
[2:35:00] and I called you and that night you were
[2:35:01] going to Fort Wayne for a meeting I said
[2:35:03] yes said you went to get me some
[2:35:05] stockings I said yes I remember them she
[2:35:07] said them was the wrong kinds of
[2:35:09] stockings honey them wasn't
[2:35:12] right Billy I I gave them to your
[2:35:16] mother they was for an older woman than
[2:35:19] me
[2:35:27] this is a lady that went into the sixth
[2:35:29] Dimension and has been pulled back out
[2:35:32] and when she comes back out she realizes
[2:35:34] she's got some things to confess to her
[2:35:39] husband and it's about her Pride that
[2:35:42] she couldn't wear a pair of socks
[2:35:45] because she thought they were for an
[2:35:46] older woman than her
[2:35:52] you talk about a standard being
[2:35:55] readjusted Saints I think it's time that
[2:35:58] we do away with our standard the world's
[2:36:01] standard even the message standard and
[2:36:05] we take the standard that's going to be
[2:36:08] held when we get into that
[2:36:10] Dimension cuz you remember in the Garden
[2:36:12] of Eden Adam and Eve were clothed and
[2:36:15] when they when God
[2:36:17] came Adam confessed I'm
[2:36:20] naked and he was clothed with fig
[2:36:23] leaves hope goes beyond the curtain of
[2:36:26] time thinking she's all right when she
[2:36:28] slips back out she
[2:36:30] realizes I've got something I've got to
[2:36:33] confess I still had a little pride
[2:36:35] laying in my heart that I was too young
[2:36:38] to wear them
[2:36:43] stockings you either get it or you don't
[2:36:45] get it Saints I don't I don't
[2:36:47] know but if we can wrap our mind around
[2:36:50] that I think it'll change our
[2:36:52] lives this is the appropriate standard
[2:36:55] and definition of selfishness and it
[2:36:58] didn't work in the sixth Dimension she
[2:37:02] had to come back out and make it right
[2:37:06] before she went back
[2:37:09] in she thought that she was too young to
[2:37:12] wear some older stockings for an older
[2:37:14] woman he said well God bless you honey I
[2:37:16] didn't know that that was all right she
[2:37:18] said you remember that time you wanted
[2:37:20] to go hunting so bad and we was at
[2:37:21] Louisville you seen that little 22 rifle
[2:37:23] as the musicians would come please and
[2:37:25] you wanted and it cost $300 something
[2:37:27] for you to pay down on it and it didn't
[2:37:29] and you didn't have the money to pay it
[2:37:31] it's it's been about 2 years ago I said
[2:37:33] yeah yeah I remember she says Bill I've
[2:37:36] always wanted to buy you that rifle she
[2:37:38] said I won't be with you for a few
[2:37:40] minutes longer now but when you go home
[2:37:42] look up on top of the old folding bed
[2:37:43] under that piece of paper and I've been
[2:37:45] saving nickels for you to buy to buy
[2:37:47] that rifle she said will you promise me
[2:37:50] you'll buy
[2:37:53] it a dying
[2:37:57] woman concerned about her
[2:37:59] babies concerned about confessing that
[2:38:02] she did something wrong out of
[2:38:05] Pride wanting her husband to take the
[2:38:08] money she earned washing and go buy a
[2:38:11] gun with
[2:38:16] it she says promise me promise me that
[2:38:19] you won't stay
[2:38:24] single sa she's giving up
[2:38:27] everything she was a wife and she was a
[2:38:32] mother now she's telling him go get
[2:38:36] another wife don't let my babies be
[2:38:38] dragged around Pillar To
[2:38:41] Post promise me that you won't stay
[2:38:44] single my children will have a home to
[2:38:46] go to and not be drug around everywhere
[2:38:49] she has slipped back out of this six
[2:38:51] sixth Dimension and she is dealing with
[2:38:54] any little
[2:38:58] small selfish High School demon that may
[2:39:00] be laying
[2:39:01] around giving up as being a wife giving
[2:39:05] up as being the mother to these
[2:39:08] children let somebody else mother them
[2:39:10] yeah I can't but let somebody else I
[2:39:12] can't be your wife anymore get some let
[2:39:14] somebody else help you
[2:39:19] and in closing she said and another
[2:39:22] thing she says you realize why I'm going

[2:39:27] you oh that's what
[2:39:31] hurt you realize why I'm going don't
[2:39:35] you she said if I wouldn't have listened
[2:39:39] to Mama it wouldn't have been it would
[2:39:42] have been different wouldn't
[2:39:44] it promise me you'll go right out into
[2:39:46] the fields where we were supposed to go
[2:39:50] I would venture to say the biggest
[2:39:52] heartache in brother bram's Life As We
[2:39:55] would stand together the biggest complex
[2:39:58] that he had the thing that hurt him the
[2:40:01] most when a dying woman on her
[2:40:04] deathbed came to
[2:40:07] it she said if I wouldn't have listened
[2:40:11] to
[2:40:14] mama she
[2:40:17] tried as a dine woman woman knowing that
[2:40:21] that was going to haunt him for the rest
[2:40:22] of his life she tried to take that
[2:40:25] burden off of him it was because I
[2:40:28] listened to mama not
[2:40:30] you it was me that listened to Mama and
[2:40:33] done wrong not
[2:40:40] you Saints we've been given an
[2:40:43] invitation if you'll play something
[2:40:45] please we've been given an invitation to
[2:40:48] come to communion to come to a wedding
[2:40:52] supper to come and examine our self by
[2:40:57] the word of
[2:40:58] God and by the appropriate
[2:41:04] standard I don't want to come to a point
[2:41:06] in my
[2:41:07] life that I start slipping
[2:41:12] [Music]
[2:41:13] dimensions and have to hit the brakes
[2:41:15] and say Lord will you let me go back
[2:41:17] just for a second I got to make
[2:41:19] something
[2:41:21] right forgive my emotion I'm not trying
[2:41:23] to work on your emotions this morning
[2:41:25] Saints the word has went forth the word
[2:41:26] is
[2:41:29] enough it either Pricks your heart or it
[2:41:32] don't but I tell you it pricked my
[2:41:35] heart it's pricked my heart for
[2:41:38] [Music]
[2:41:40] months and I don't
[2:41:43] want to come to that point to where I
[2:41:46] start slipping out
[2:41:49] and I start going into the
[2:41:51] presence of the true
[2:41:55] standard and realize I ain't Towing in
[2:41:57] the line that I'm not measuring up that
[2:41:59] I still got a
[2:42:01] little bit of Pride or a little demon of
[2:42:05] self andish laying
[2:42:07] around we have been given a full word
[2:42:10] with full
[2:42:11] Vindication and the reason that we've
[2:42:13] been given that is to do a full proper
[2:42:16] assessment of ourselves not so that we
[2:42:19] can be smarter than the religious
[2:42:22] world I say that we accept the
[2:42:24] invitation to the feast as we close our
[2:42:26] eyes and bow our heads I say we accept
[2:42:28] and our pastor would come I say we
[2:42:31] accept the invitation that's been given
[2:42:34] I'm so sorry that I've been lengthy it's
[2:42:37] just the way that it kind of played
[2:42:40] out I thank you for being attentive
[2:42:43] you've been very respectful
[2:42:49] and I'm just going to close on that
[2:42:50] because I don't really have anything
[2:42:52] else to say or to mention like I said
[2:42:54] the word has went forth it either hits
[2:42:56] your heart or it doesn't but I pray that
[2:42:59] it'll strike your heart the way that it
[2:43:01] struck
[2:43:02] mine and that we'll do away with all our
[2:43:04] pride and all of our envy and all of our
[2:43:06] stress and all of our selfishness and
[2:43:08] recognize them for the demons that they
[2:43:10] are and deal with them not with soft
[2:43:14] gloves but deal with them as demons
[2:43:16] ought to be dealt with
[2:43:20] I've said some hard things I've said
[2:43:22] some harsh things I pray your
[2:43:25] forgiveness I'm I'm not just saying this
[2:43:27] but I honestly pray your forgiveness if
[2:43:29] I've offended you if I've said anything
[2:43:32] too
[2:43:33] hard or or wrong God knows my heart I I
[2:43:37] did not mean to offend
[2:43:39] anybody and I I purposely tried to hold
[2:43:42] back from preaching to go slow so that I
[2:43:46] wouldn't get caught up and say anything
[2:43:47] too harsh ler in the wrong
[2:43:53] Spirit but I can't apologize for what
[2:43:55] I've said because I believe it to be the
[2:43:57] word of God and I believe the principle
[2:43:58] is to be
[2:44:00] true and they apply to me just as they
[2:44:03] apply to
[2:44:05] you but I want to ask sister an if she
[2:44:07] would just come and sing that song again
[2:44:09] as we would close sorry to put you on
[2:44:10] the spot like that sis but I just feel
[2:44:12] that it's
[2:44:14] appropriate and I would just
[2:44:18] [Music]
[2:44:21] Saints there a reason there's a reason
[2:44:23] that brother emanuel's preached this
[2:44:25] brother gab's preached this brother kyus
[2:44:27] preached this and our pastors alluded to
[2:44:29] it it's not so that we can miss
[2:44:32] something so that we can catch
[2:44:36] something and I'm it's all I know to do
[2:44:39] as a gospel minister
[2:44:41] is to tell you today that you've been
[2:44:43] given a wedding supper
[2:44:47] invitation to be still and to quiet
[2:44:52] yourself and let him speak to you and
[2:44:54] work on you I just would ask you to do
[2:44:57] that as our sister and song later would
[2:45:00] sing this here this morning God bless
[2:45:08] you working daily for your
[2:45:13] cause there's so little time to
[2:45:17] pause and and
[2:45:20] seek you

[2:51:20] [Music]
[2:51:23] I
[2:51:26] amen amen I don't know about you but my
[2:51:30] seat got a little hot a few times and
[2:51:33] I'm
[2:51:35] thankful I'm grateful for
[2:51:37] it I'm so thankful that our brother will
[2:51:40] pour out his heart and say things that
[2:51:42] no human being wants to say in front of
[2:51:44] congregation of
[2:51:46] people but sometimes s we're blind to
[2:51:50] these little blind spots in our life
[2:51:51] that are hindering our spiritual growth
[2:51:53] and stopping us from moving forward we
[2:51:56] can't see them we don't know they're
[2:51:57] there but God will use the foolishness
[2:51:59] of preaching to open our eyes and say
[2:52:01] there's a hindrance in your life there's
[2:52:04] something that's stopping your progress
[2:52:05] through something that's not pleasing to
[2:52:07] the Lord I thank God for
[2:52:10] it I realize sitting in my seat that we
[2:52:13] too easily excuse what we call little
[2:52:16] things it's a little thing and the truth
[2:52:19] is on the surface it is a little thing
[2:52:22] somewhat
[2:52:23] insignificant doesn't make a big deal
[2:52:25] but it's not the surface that's the
[2:52:27] problem it's the root of that little
[2:52:29] thing is selfishness that's the big deal
[2:52:33] the big deal is not the little
[2:52:35] infraction or the little the big deal is
[2:52:38] the
[2:52:39] selfishness I sat in my seat and I
[2:52:42] marveled how my hindrance is
[2:52:46] me you realize brother bandam when he
[2:52:48] come to the seventh seal he he he began
[2:52:50] to tell us that God one plan one goal
[2:52:53] one thing he wanted to achieve and he
[2:52:56] unfolded it in three parts first to get
[2:52:58] preeminence in a man he did that in
[2:53:00] Christ Jesus he didn't have it fully in
[2:53:03] Moses he didn't have it fully in David
[2:53:04] he didn't have it fully in Jeremiah he
[2:53:06] never had it till he come to Jesus
[2:53:08] Christ and the second was to get
[2:53:10] preeminence in a body of Believers of
[2:53:13] people his bride and that's what he's
[2:53:15] doing
[2:53:16] now he didn't have it through all the
[2:53:18] church Church ages he didn't have it in
[2:53:19] his reading but he's going to have it
[2:53:22] now do you know what's hindering the
[2:53:24] program of
[2:53:27] God
[2:53:29] self selfishness
[2:53:33] Pride what is God need more than
[2:53:35] anything he needs me to get out of the
[2:53:37] way to stop defending protecting
[2:53:41] promoting to stop making excuses he just
[2:53:45] needs me to say Lord I'm sorry
[2:53:49] I'm not making excuses for little things
[2:53:52] anymore I don't want to be selfish
[2:53:55] anymore I don't want my self-love to
[2:53:58] hinder the work of
[2:54:00] God that's the nature of Lucifer that's
[2:54:03] injected to Mankind and we all fight
[2:54:06] it but I thank God that he's brought it
[2:54:08] to our
[2:54:09] attention and I say if God's picked your
[2:54:12] heart and he's opened your eyes in some
[2:54:14] way and said you know what that's
[2:54:16] me I've made excus exuses because of
[2:54:19] selfishness I've overlooked some things
[2:54:21] I shouldn't have overlooked because of
[2:54:23] what I wanted the way it made me
[2:54:26] feel that you I just encourage you just
[2:54:29] to
[2:54:30] repent it's that easy it's not far away
[2:54:33] just say God that was me when brother
[2:54:36] Ben was saying that and maybe he didn't
[2:54:38] even mention this application but you
[2:54:40] told me I know it applied here in my
[2:54:43] life and Lord forgive
[2:54:46] me remember brother bandam one time was
[2:54:49] talking to a woman she had a dream she
[2:54:51] was walking on White Sands she wanted
[2:54:54] brother brandham to interpret the dream
[2:54:56] and in the interpretation he says you
[2:54:58] drifted from God but you want to come
[2:55:01] back she said that's true he said you're
[2:55:04] back
[2:55:06] now not months from now not weeks from
[2:55:08] now not when you do pentant but when you
[2:55:10] want to come back when you want to line
[2:55:13] back up when you surrender and say
[2:55:15] that's me God I'm sorry if you realize
[2:55:18] my selfishness has been hindering you
[2:55:21] and you want to come back in line I want
[2:55:23] to tell you you can come back right now
[2:55:26] say God forgive me for my selfishness
[2:55:29] for my my my self focus my self- love
[2:55:33] which is all rooted in Pride forgive me
[2:55:36] so I just like to take a minute and pray
[2:55:38] together and if you want to pray at your
[2:55:39] seat or pray at the altar the altar is
[2:55:41] open if something praked your heart and
[2:55:43] you just want to say Lord I want to
[2:55:45] surrender that to you too dyam myself
[2:55:49] I'd encourage you to do so
[2:55:51] now let's just bow our heads together
[2:55:54] and
[2:55:56] pray their Heavenly
[2:55:59] Father God all I can say is I'm sorry
[2:56:04] Lord I'm so thankful father
[2:56:07] that you can still
[2:56:10] speak that you can take a vessel of
[2:56:14] clay that's human all you can take that
[2:56:20] vessel and you can push him to his
[2:56:22] limits beyond what he's comfortable with
[2:56:26] so that you can use that mouthpiece to
[2:56:28] speak something that I needed to
[2:56:31] hear Lord I'm not
[2:56:34] offended not
[2:56:36] angry Lord I'm
[2:56:39] thankful I'm thankful that you love me
[2:56:41] enough that I'm not going to continue on
[2:56:44] blindly plunging
[2:56:46] through walking
[2:56:48] over
[2:56:51] principles but God my desire is to
[2:56:54] surrender all to you to be pleasing to
[2:56:58] you Lord Jesus in this quiet time that
[2:57:01] we have right now would you search each
[2:57:04] of our hearts Lord would your spirit
[2:57:07] work in US Lord and begin to expose
[2:57:09] those things that are hindering us and
[2:57:10] tripping us those areas of self-love and
[2:57:14] self- focus and pride and selfishness
[2:57:17] that are stunting our our growth and
[2:57:18] keeping us Lord from the plan you have
[2:57:20] for
[2:57:21] us and God would you give us the courage
[2:57:24] to be honest about it to confess it Lord
[2:57:28] not to bristle or to complain but just
[2:57:30] to Simply
[2:57:32] melt under the exposing light of your
[2:57:35] word and may it melt away Lord
[2:57:38] everything that's not like you and may
[2:57:40] we just flatten ourselves and
[2:57:42] realize I'm not yet what I ought to
[2:57:45] be Lord we've you've brought us so far
[2:57:49] Lord You've corrected us and you've
[2:57:51] taught us you've encouraged us you've
[2:57:53] instructed us you've tore us down and
[2:57:55] you've built us
[2:57:57] up but Lord there's more things that
[2:57:59] need tore down and built back
[2:58:02] up Lord I'm
[2:58:04] thankful Lord I pray that you move in
[2:58:06] the hearts and lives of all of your
[2:58:08] children may we all Lord be honest right
[2:58:11] now with
[2:58:13] ourselves God and realizing that
[2:58:16] we've sometimes kept self
[2:58:19] at the center of our
[2:58:21] world we've
[2:58:23] overlooked things the prophet told us
[2:58:26] we've neglected things that we know we
[2:58:28] should do we've allowed things we know
[2:58:31] we shouldn't
[2:58:32] do and we know what the root of it Lord
[2:58:35] is
[2:58:37] selfishness God My Eyes Are Open it's
[2:58:40] not a little
[2:58:42] thing the outward may be
[2:58:44] minor but the trouble is deep inside my
[2:58:47] heart
[2:58:49] the selfishness that lays there that
[2:58:51] would be willing to ignore willing to
[2:58:53] quiet that voice willing to trample over
[2:58:56] the alarm bells in my heart just to
[2:58:58] please
[2:59:00] myself God that's the deeper issue
[2:59:04] that's the real problem that's what's
[2:59:07] hindering God I pray that you give us
[2:59:09] the courage to deal with that right now
[2:59:11] and surrender ourselves aresh to you
[2:59:15] forgive us Lord forgive us
[2:59:19] for our selflove and selfishness and
[2:59:21] pride Purge it from us Lord you didn't
[2:59:25] preach this message in vain you preached
[2:59:27] it because you want to take us to a
[2:59:28] higher place you preached it because you
[2:59:31] wanted to open our eyes to what was

[2:59:37] preach it to hinder you didn't preach it

[2:59:48] way may you take us to higher ples than
[2:59:51] we've ever been maybe we be we be
