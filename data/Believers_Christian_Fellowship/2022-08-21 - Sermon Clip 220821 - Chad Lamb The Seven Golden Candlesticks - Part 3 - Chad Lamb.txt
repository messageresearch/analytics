TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that's why when we see this message and we see pictures of a cloud we know it's the seven angels we know it's the seven thunders we know it's the tying together the loose ends the mystery of god being revealed we can get bogged down and this types this and seven of this and seven of that or we can realize everything christ has for his bride is here now everything that was impartial before is not impartial anymore that's the whole point friends amen we're not here with one eye trying to see the picture we're here with all seven eyes on the lab trying to see who's seeing in fullness the picture that god's painting you can say i'm confused about seven seals and seven vials and seven trumpets and seven thunders and seven horns and seven eyes don't get confused we'll make it simple amen what god had measured out through the church ages he has come back in fullness and he wants to live through you [Music] that's the whole picture of the lampstand the whole imagery is christ in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks in the lord's day amen not not in another day not in the previous day not in church ages in the lord's day which is today [Music] he wants his light to shine through you he wants the full measure of this word to shine and you and i he wants us to be a burning shining light in this dark world and i'll tell you friends it's the only light in this world because when this light is removed it's total darkness and god in his mercy will send two more but not until this one's gone and then two more will come on the scene and shine that light of the full word to the jews so that they can come into the full revelation what a wonderful day we live in what a merciful time to look down through the bible and see every every bible type and shadow was pointing to this day
