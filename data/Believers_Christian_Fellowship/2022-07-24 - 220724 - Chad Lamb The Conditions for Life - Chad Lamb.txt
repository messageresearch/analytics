things in the name of our lord jesus christ amen and god bless you while you're standing if you want to turn to the book of genesis we'll turn there together and begin in genesis i'll just give you a quick update on brother juan he is doing better and improving day by day they thought that he would get to go home by yesterday but the doctor kept him and i asked brother juan he wasn't sure why but he's improving greatly he's feeling better getting stronger and and so we appreciate your prayers and just be praying for him i assume he'll get to go home after the weekend and it won't be long until we'll see him here because that brother loves to be in church so it'll be soon so just keep him in prayer and that he can get released soon also i forgot to mention on wednesday at the end of service but brother emmanuel and sister mimi sabasu are in oregon right now with brother rich cobb in the assembly there and he's sharing some testimony about the work he's doing in congo and ministering there so he'll be doing that yes last evening and today so just remember him in prayer and give that god give them traveling mercies on their way home amen let's look at genesis chapter 1 verse 1. in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters man god bless you as you're seated and may the lord bless us as we look into his word and may he give us the spirit of revelation amen amen i want to look at the the this uh phrase the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and look at some things that brother branham said this word moved means one of the definitions is to hover amen so the holy the holy ghost the spirit of god was hovering over the waters and we know that uh by the message that we find the earth was in a state of judgment from something that happened before so something previously happened causing the earth to be found now in the state of judgment where it's just death all over it's shrouded in darkness amen and there's no form and it's void and there's just nothing there amen but the holy ghost is hovering the spirit of god hovering over over the over the waters amen and brother bam says in the message conference and see when god made man he began to brood over the earth up come like easter flowers upcome grass upcoming species rising higher and higher the great holy spirit brooding amen so the bible says the spirit of god hovered but brother bannon begins to attach it to brooding amen the spirit of god is moving over the waters amen because he does not intend for it to stay in a form of judgment he does not intend for it to stay shrouded in darkness and void amen but god has a purpose for this creation and whatever happened before amen caused it to fall into this state amen but god is not finished with the earth and he's not finished with his creation amen so the spirit of god begins to hover over it amen and begins to brood over it because he's going to bring it into a form of usefulness bring it back into what is in god's mind amen so the spirit of god moved or hovered upon the face of the waters back to the quote where brother brahma says the great holy spirit brooding brooding means to be mothering cooing coo the flowers come up the father said that's wonderful just keep it up and he brooded and after a while outcome birds and the next thing outcome animals he kept getting greater and greater and greater amen let's turn to deuteronomy chapter 32 real quick i want to catch one more verse while we're on this word brooding verse 32 sorry deuteronomy verse 32. and for a title this morning i'd like to talk about the conditions for life the conditions for life and this is not going to be anything that we haven't heard before it's very simple but very profound amen it's the conditions for life deuteronomy 32 and verse 9. and the lord's portion is his people jacob is the lot of his inheritance and he found him in the desert land and in the waste howling wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye as an eagle stirth up her nest fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them bareth them on her wings so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him and god is speaking about choosing jacob amen and out of jacob would come the nation of israel and he he begins to describe how he nurtured jacob and how he brought him out of a barren wilderness into a fruitful land and verse 11 says as an eagle stir the burnest fluttereth over her young this word fluttereth is the same word as move when the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters it hovers over so this is how god cared for jacob he fluttered over him as an eagle flood earth over her young amen and was cooing over them and and encouraging them to grow and to fly so this is how god amen brought up jacob so as the eagle stir that bernath fluttered over her young that means hover over or as the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters so god amen was over the face of the waters amen to flutter over it or to hover over it to bring it back to life amen and he was fluttering over or hovering over jacob to bring him from a desolate land into that which was in god's mind from before the foundation of the world to bring him into life to bring him into his position amen so it's the hovering or the moving of the holy spirit amen that's drawing life brother man explains this in in a couple of places here in the identified masterpiece of god from 1964 he says now and when he made adam the first man how perfect it was he looked like god god the great holy spirit brooding over the earth the birds come out maybe in the animals and different things and kept coming more in the form of the one that was brooding until finally there came a specie just exactly like the one that was doing the brooding god who was doing the brooding god what was he doing amen he was hovering over his young he was bringing them into a position amen and god by the spoken word amen was setting the earth in order so god would speak to the word and the spirit would move over and draw out the flowers and draw out the plants and draw out all of these things amen and what was the purpose amen he was trying to bring a specie out of the earth that would be exactly the mirror image that reflect the one that was doing the brooding amen and when adam come forth he was in the reflection of god amen i'll read that again until finally there came a species just exactly like the one that was doing the brooding god god was man was made in the image of god then when he placed him in this great garden like michelangelo has placed his great life's work and all great sculptures god placed his handiwork in the garden of eden and made him a help me what a complete satisfaction it was to god till even he rested it was just at rest his work had been finished the holy ghost was was hovering over or or brooding over this great creation bringing the word of god to pass amen bringing the word into a manifestation until it built one thing upon another amen and it was bringing things into the right atmosphere to the right setting amen to the right position amen until the the very image of the one that was brooding could now stand upon the earth and god was so satisfied amen that he completed his work that he can now take his rest praise god he was brooding and working and bringing it up until he got to this accomplishment and after he met this accomplishment now god could rest because he had brought up what he had desired to bring up upon the earth praise be to god amen i want to read a quote out of this seed shall not be heir with the shock he was god the logos the word that went out of god when he began to brood upon the earth and brought forth marine life when the spirit of god the logos the word which god said let there be and there went the logos which is the word and god because all this was in the logos the whole word of god the whole bible for every age and as the logos began to breathe upon the earth there came marine life and building up the bird life and on up to animal life and finally there comes something in the representation or looked like the thing that was brewing it brooding over it god a man in the very image of gone that man fell like the seed has to fall and then god began to brood over that after the fall he brought up enoch he brought up elijah he brought up moses he brought up prophet after prophet trying to restore that image again and finally upon the earth came the genuine image of god himself again which was god the logos made flesh and dwelt among us amen so god was brooding until he got this image just right amen and he took his rest but then after the fall amen the spirit of god goes right back to brooding again because now this fallen image is just like the fallen earth in genesis 1 1 and the brooding of god is going to bring it back to what it was in his mind before the foundation of the world and now as man fell god goes back to brooding again so he can bring back another manifestation of himself so he brooded over the patriarchs over the old testament until he got finally again upon the earth another man in his image and that was christ jesus now he doesn't stop there he says now that same logos has a part he has got a bride oh my that same logos has a part he has a bride amen the work wasn't complete because god he kept brooding and working until he brought up the man but he didn't take his rest till the man had a help meet amen because out of the man came his help me when they united back together god then entrusted the care of his creation to them and took his rest but what brought him out of his rest is when they fell and he says i will restore and he begins to restore the masterpiece again and he's brooding and brooding and brooding until he brings back the man amen but there's a logos has another part there's a part of that logos that's his bride so he's got to keep brooding till he brings her out amen so we see uh in the creation story let's go back to genesis chapter one we see that there's conditions for life and i want to that's what i want to talk about now we we looked at the big picture what god is doing in creation than what god's been doing through the the the old testament and the new testament how that holy ghost has been brooding to bring that life up but now i want to break it down individually to the individual so we have the what god does i've said this many times what god does in the macrocosm he does in the microcosm what god does on the grand scale he does in our lives what god does in his life he does in the grand picture amen it's all the same thing the same prophecies the same word rolling on and on what works for the whole bride works for us individually amen so in the in the smyrna church age out of the church age book it says now there here we come to a conclusion as the eternal logos god was manifest in the sun and in jesus do what all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gain the title of son even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn become the many members spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth this is important we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non-seed there is nothing to quicken this is an important principle amen this is a this is a principle that gives us so much uh satisfaction so much confidence amen that if i ever if i ever am a child of god i've always been a child of god amen and this is going to tie right into genesis 1 as we keep going on he says uh further down and are in the same message actually no just uh uh two pages before in the smyrna church age it says now it says that he has chosen us in him jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of god before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect don't ever forget that an eternal quality what's that quality that thought that is expressed in you that thought amen that is the seed gene of god that's in you amen that thought it gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that now here's where i want to spend a little bit of time in the fourth seal the prophet of god says they didn't have anything to do with it in genesis 1 1 it said in the beginning god created heavens and earth period see that's all now the world without form and void and said i believe every seed was laying right there from some other civilization or something and as soon as the water lifted off and the light struck it upon up come the trees and everything the same thing with the human being it's a type when all the mist is moved away and the revealed truth to that real seed laying there still germatized and the light of the gospel can strike it by a true vindication of the word it'll live it's got life in it outside of that it can't live it has got no life in it amen so so brother branham is showing us amen that in the creation story the earth is void and without form but brother branham said down below those waters were seeds from some other civilization or something amen somehow there was already seeds and those seeds that were laying under the water are already germatized they already had life inside amen but the condition that they were under was not conducive to life amen they could not come forth in that condition amen so the holy ghost began to brood upon the earth and change the condition and the reason he's changing to condition is because he knows the seeds laying there so he's changing the condition to bring out the life of the seed because he already knows the seeds there he already has a plan for that seed and the destruction the the judgment that that seed is under now does not change the fact that god knows it's there and still has a purpose for it and wants to bring it forth to manifest what was in his mind amen so we see we see our life laying in genesis chapter one we see ourselves from the very beginning of the bible we see the mystery of the seventh seal and we see ourselves amen right in the word of god because when we were born in this earth we came shrouded in darkness amen we came covered over amen there was a seed buried in this earth amen but our minds were dark into that we had absolutely no uh we were in spiritual amnesia we had no remembrance of anything we recovered over with an earthly spirit but god was going as god if he's going to bring that seed to life he has got to change the conditions around that amen to bring out what's already there in the message one in a million said did you ever notice a seed as reverend pitts was speaking a few moments ago and how a seed goes into the ground many seeds are there in the ground when god moved upon the water with the light and the light brought forth the first presence of god spoke spoken light came by god's word and god's word is the only thing that still brings light and when the waters went back the seed was already in the earth and the light only brought forth the seeds that remained with german them coming forth god making his creation and now on easter morning there was another light struck the earth when the holy spirit was given and it's given to bring life to those seeds that god by his foreknowledge knew that would be here on the earth as he knew the first natural seed he knows where the spiritual seed is so let's look at genesis 1 again we've we read genesis verse 1 verse 1 and 2 and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the earth hovered over and brother venom said brooded over mothered over bringing up amen the word of god and look let's look at verse 3 now and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day in the darkness he called night in the evening in the morning or the first day amen so this is uh what i want to begin talking about here brother franco if you could bring up the whiteboard for me i'm going to draw something out he says first thing that we have is we have a seed buried in earth under a state of judgment that's what we begin with there is not going to be any manifestation whatsoever on the face of the earth unless there's a germatic seed under the waters so the moving of the holy spirit the hovering the cooing of the dove of the holy ghost amen is there to bring about the word of god and move the conditions into such a way that what's already down there with life in it will come forth and manifest what's on the inside amen the holy ghost is not able to change what that seed is it's there to bring out the life that's in the seed amen this is important to know because this is how god brings us to life amen amen praise god so the first thing i want to write is the first thing you start with you must have a seed if there is no seed down under the waters all the movement of the word will not bring anything into manifestation because everything the holy ghost is moving and brooding in the spirit of god is taking the word of god and making a condition and moving things around so that it can cou to or draw the seed that's already there which germatized amen from some previous civilization and i want to tell you that if you're a child of god you've got a germination from a previous civilization amen from the faith civilization amen you've come from the mind of god amen and so now the most important thing to start with is a seed there must be a germatic seed and brother branham said under the flood there was probably other seeds amen that didn't have life in them they weren't germatized and they were just burned out by the floods but the the holy ghost is moving over the waters and moving uh upon this earth to bring the life that's in the seed into manifestation this is so important you must have a seed how did it get there it had to get there before genesis 1 2. amen how when you come into this story the seed had already needed to be sown before you get to genesis 1 2. by the time you get to genesis 1 2 amen the seed is already there and already buried in the earth under judgment it was already there it wasn't put there in genesis 1 2 it was already there brother mum says in the message there's a man here that can turn on the light he said it takes the light of god to strike the word to make it live here's what he spoke brother brandon pat's his bible oh i'm sorry brother random patch's bible now let this now let the light shine amen let the light shine and the light will bring every word to its right position in its season amen you see when it comes time this is really important the word in its right position in its season amen you see when it comes when it comes time sometimes that grain lays in the earth dormant all through the winter like seed winter wheat sowed in the ground but when the sun gets just right oh it's got to live and it can't live without the sun and god has made promises for every age and every day and when the light gets right and the shines upon that it'll produce just exactly what the word said because he is the light and the life so the first thing you need you must have a seed then once you have a seed then you must have light and we're going to follow the the the creation story here in genesis 1. the first thing that god does the first thing he speaks is let there be light amen because the first thing you need to make a seed live is light so god brings the word first amen that's why amen this this bible was written before the foundation of the world the word has been around amen the word is part of god the word is god amen the the the the seals were sealed before the foundation of the world god had light and then he began to let the light shine amen but you have to have light first now in the message god's only provided place of worship he said now think these men why was they called and was put in a condition these pharisees by jesus said in vain you worship me worship him genuine worship true worship from their hearts in vain you worship me why teaching for doctrine the tradition of man therefore you make the commandments of god of no effect to the people if i taught you a methodist message it would take no effect on you this is bride time [Music] so you must have light but you must have the right light for the right season there's a light that shines all year long but throughout the year there's certain seasons for growth of certain seeds brother baby explains this and makes it so simple that you don't sow your seed amen in the wrong when the sun is in the wrong position because as it travels amen from the north to the south it's not the right time amen for that for the sun is not in the right position the light is not right to bring forth that seed amen but when the sun moves back to the north again it's time to plant the seed it'll bring forth but there's some seeds you plant in the fall there's some seeds you plant in the spring there's some seeds you plant early there's some seeds you plant late but there's got to be the right light for the right seed and when the light right hits the right seed in the right season it brings it to life because that seed is meant for that light and for that condition and under that condition it springs forth to life and that's why brother venom is telling us here that sometimes the grain lays door and the earth dormant all through the winter like seed winter wheat sowed in the ground but when the sun gets just right it's got to live it can't live without that sun so every age has to produce the right light we know that we're in the bright age amen so brother braham was explaining this and god's only provided place of worship this is bride time if moses taught the message of noah it would take no effect because it was the light for a different season amen so now there has to be a different light with a different strength with a different manifestation for a different seed if jesus thought moses message would take no effect because the predestinated seeds are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that's given for that seed it won't grow any other condition it must be the condition that grows it so now we see that that in order for the seed to come to life first there has to be light but there's got to be a specific light for a specific seed and a specific season that's why you weren't alive 2 000 years ago that's why you weren't alive 200 years ago but god ordained that the seed in you would come forth in a certain season and god would make sure there's a certain light shining in this season because there's a seed laying down inside of you from a previous civilization or something that's waiting to come in contact with a certain line and when that light hits that seed it'll spring forth the life and manifest what is locked inside that seed and that seed that is locked in you and i in this time is not a seed predestinated for luther's age amen it's beyond that it's not predestinated for wesley's age it's beyond that this is bride time amen there's a bride seed that has been planted deep down in the earth of you amen waiting to come in contact with a certain light and that light will bring it to life amen i'm preaching this for many of us amen this is an encouragement because we've gone through this process the holy ghost is brooded over us brought us into a condition to bring that seed to life and now that seed is living in us and manifesting amen but there's people among us who still need the brooding of the holy ghost to bring that seed to life amen and there's going to be no life in this place if we don't get the right light amen this is what this is what i want to talk about in the conditions for life amen we've got young people that are coming up we've got people who are new people are coming in whatever condition it is maybe people been here for a while amen and the condition has never gotten right for that seed to strike amen but in order for that to come to life first there must be a seed there and the seed can lay dormant for a long time it can lay dormant for a long time amen but the only way that that bride seed and this bright time will come manifest bride life is if we have the bride message amen in the bright age if we don't have the right light and we don't preach the right light we will never bring life to the seeds that are predestinated to manifest in this day that's why we cannot preach denominational life we cannot preach previous age life everything we preach amen must be filtered through the message that god has given us in this day with the full revelation of the word amen it doesn't mean that we don't preach justification because luther preached justification justification is part of the word amen but when you filter that through the message amen brother branham brought us perfect justification pure justification true justification to where you're not justified now by the choice you made amen you're justified by what christ did for you amen and now you're just not forgiven brother brother brother branham and the message he shined the light on the gospel to show us true justification not that you've now been forgiven amen it's just as if you never did it in the first place because that seed is your ought to be conditioned it's the true you and in that seed never disbelieve the word of god one day so true justification under the light of this day brings us to the realization that the real genuine me down on the inside this flesh has done all kinds of horrible things and suffered many consequences for it but thank god he's going to change this flesh but that soul that's been born again amen that seed that sprung to life that's the real me and justificat we preach justification but we don't preach luther's justification we preach what luther taught under the bright light of this age sanctification the same way sanctification by the spirit we must live a sanctified life but it's going to take the power of the holy ghost to live through us to bring us to true sanctification because if not we just take our own idea about sanctification and create another church order and another coat of rules and to cover conduct and consider that true sanctification true sanctification is when the holy ghost comes and burns out any desire for the world are the things of the world and begins to bring a natural life that's flowing out from you that no longer wants the things of the world not abstinence because it's wrong but abstinence because i don't want it anymore so in order to bring a seed for this age of life we must preach the full power of the light word for this day that's why we cannot compromise on the word we cannot uh water down the word we cannot uh uh change what the prophet said or or somehow uh if it's too hard or too harsh make it a little softer we must preach it in the power that it was given to us because that is the light to bring the word to life in this day to bring these seeds to life that's why for me i said god help me never to back down on anything the prophet of god ever taught never no matter how harsh it sounds or how extreme it sounds amen that is the light that will bring the seed to life help me never amen try to to to deaden the effect by softening it because it's not palatable hey there's a people on the earth that can eat that word amen there's a people on the earth that wants it amen we must preach it in the full power it's given and preached the word with the full revelation that's been given to us amen now in the message god hiding himself in simplicity he says now in the old testament there might not be one person present this morning that was there the day of dedication when major ulrich played the music and i stood behind the three crosses here to dedicate the place amen i want to read one more scripture let's go over here to genesis 1 again let's read verse 6. i want to read this before i finish this quote genesis 1 6 and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so and god called the firmament heaven and the evening and the morning were the second day so we're talking about the spring forth of seed this seed is going to come forth in the third day but he started with light the the spirit of god began to move upon the face of the waters and as it began to move then god spoke let there be light and there was light amen in the holy ghost all the time was brooding over the over the earth and then he he created the atmosphere and that's what i want to talk about next is atmosphere and then he separated the firmament and he created an atmosphere so the first thing he needed was light the second thing was atmosphere all right atmosphere and now brother branham is he's here and got him hiding himself in simplicity and he's talking about the old days in the tabernacle because they've just remodeled it and he's talking about uh the renovation and he goes back to the old times and he says i would not permit anybody the usher stood at the door to see that nobody talked when you're done you're talking outside you come in if you desire to silently you come to the altar and prayed silently you walk back to your seat open up the bible what your neighbor done that was up to him you had nothing to say if you want to talk to him say i'll see him outside i'm in here to worship the lord you read his word or sit quietly and then the music sister gertie i don't know whether she's here this morning or not sister gibbs the old piano i believe set back in this corner the best of my remembrance and she would play softly down at the cross where my savior died some real sweet soft music and then until it come time for the service and the song leader got up and led a couple of congregational songs and then if they had some outstanding solo they sang it but never just a bunch of carrying on and then the music continued played and then when i heard that i know it was my time to come out when a minister walks into a congregation of people praying in the anointing of the spirit you're bound to hear from heaven that's just all there's no way to keep from it but if you walk into confusion then you're so confused the spirits grieved but it was talking about how he set the church in order years ago and the reason he said it in order was to create an atmosphere amen and there's a reason that we have a church order that that's been taught to us from the by the prophet there's a reason that he told us to come to church early amen and he'd come to tell us to come to church early in one place he said 30 minutes early you can come to the altar and pray pray at your seat amen open your bible read amen pray meditate amen because we're here to create an atmosphere amen because before these seeds in genesis 1 begin to spring up and manifest first there was light then there was an atmosphere and so we want to create an atmosphere and that's what brother bannon's referring to and we want to constantly be conscious of this as believers that we create the right kind of atmosphere in here and it's not just an atmosphere of quiet that's important because we don't want confusion we don't want distraction but you can be dead silent amen and not prayerful and not with expectation and not focusing your mind on the service just sitting there silent amen and that's not creating the right atmosphere it's not the silence it's the meditation it's not the silence it's the focused attention it's not the silence but it's coming here preparing ourselves amen to create an atmosphere where the the spirit of god can take that word and plant it to somebody's heart create a a springing forth of life a quickening of the seed brother let's go to acts chapter 2. book of acts chapter 2. and i'm going to read it verse 4. i'm sorry verse 1 acts chapter 2 verse 1. and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance this word for the the translation for with one accord they were all amen with one accord and in one place and that this word means with one mind with one accord with one passion a unique greek word used ten of its twelve new testament occurrences in the book of acts helps us understand the uniqueness of the christian community this is out of the strongest concordance it says this word is a compound of two words meaning to rush along and in unison the image is almost musical a number of notes are sounded which while different harmonize and pitch and tone as the instruments of the great concert under the direction of the concert master so the holy ghost blends together the lives of the members of christ's church i love this when they were there when the holy ghost fell they were there in one accord and in one place amen one of the things that's most grieving to the holy ghost is discord among brethren when there's little ought and feelings and disagreements that's one of the most grieving things to the holy ghost amen the grieving to the spirit of god is discord among brothers it's actually an abomination in the eyes of god as he who was so discord among brethren and on the day of pentecost there's no accident that they were with one accord amen they were in one accord and in one place amen when the spirit of god fell they had gotten into a harmony with one another they were with one passion with one desire amen and i'll say it this way this is just me i doubt they were all of one opinion on all things i'm sure that and it was expressed later in different ideas about different things in the new testament church i doubt they were all of the same opinion but the thing that mattered most they were all unified around that they were they had one desire and that one desire was to seek god for the promise to follow amen to stay and wait for the promise that he gave the promise to the fathers to come to them amen and they were in one mind one heart one accord in one place with one passion with one desire and that's when the spirit of god fell upon them and god brought the promise to pass and i said when we come here amen let's come with one focus with one desire amen we can have different opinions about things and that's fine but when we come into this place let's set our heart on the word of god and say i want all that god has for me i'm here to hear this word for my day that will change my life and bring me into the very reflection of jesus christ on this earth let that be our focus amen each of us as an individual may we individually come with this mind and collectively as a church may we get in one accord so when we come to the service we are not here amen for we're not here to see one another although we love to see one another we're not here so we can get together and meet up and go do something after church that's not why we're here that gets everybody's mind in the wrong place we are here to worship god together to serve him as his bride and to feed from his hand the portion of manna that we need so that we might manifest his life on this earth we need to we need to come with one accord into one place amen will we always agree on everything absolutely not maybe someday we will i don't know that'll be a great day but when we come to the service let's come to the service to worship god and to hear from him every other agenda every thought let's put it aside but let's come in one accord and create the right kind of atmosphere where the holy ghost can move among us and drop into hearts and their lives brother ben has a lot to say about this i want to read several quotes on the subject he says in the message identified christ of all ages he said the holy spirit is timid very very timid where you have just one unbeliever or skeptic sitting around the holy spirit just can't work hardly listen to that i'm telling you just one unbeliever or skeptic sitting around now now you can say well i'm not a skeptic i'm not i'm not an unbeliever of the message i'm not a skeptic but if you're an unbeliever of the one ministering or a skeptic of the one who's ministering it's still going to create that atmosphere if you're skeptical of your brother here and you're skeptical of your brother there it's still going to create that atmosphere we've got to come into this place and say you know what these are my brothers and i'm going to worship god together any difference i have we'll talk about it we'll settle it but don't bring a critical skeptical spirit into here we have children that need to be born again we have young people that need an experience with god that will change them where the seed that's in their soul will quicken the life we need we need to all get on board with the same focus and the same goal in the same mind god is moving this bride forward and we want god to move freely among us this doesn't mean that if there's issues we ignore them there's issues deal with them but deal with them the scriptural way but don't let that critical skeptical nature float around in your mind and don't bring it into the fellowship of believers it'll create the wrong atmosphere and if and if somebody's got sucked into that spirit of criticism they've spread that through three or four or five and they've talked about it and all of a sudden they come in here with that same attitude listen it's like ice water and a service it grieves the spirit of god when there's issues to take care of take care of them but don't let them affect our atmosphere let's come together and say god i am here to worship you i'm here to put my shoulder to the wheel i'm here to be involved i am here brother venom said put your shoulder to the wheel wherever you go i am here to throw my lick of fire in with theirs i am i'm here to do my part i'm here to create an atmosphere and god help me to create that atmosphere one thing we learned is that the church is not a spectator sport this is not somebody play somebody sings somebody preaches everybody else watches and we go home no every individual is part of this amen this is a genuine worship of the children of god to god and god communicating back to his children each one of us have a role to play there is nobody here just watching and if there is somebody here just watching maybe they're a visitor and maybe we need to create an atmosphere for the visitor so that they can observe and that god can move in their heart but we're not here to observe we're here to participate amen let's look at mark chapter 5 together mark chapter 5. verse 38 mark chapter 5 verse 38 and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and see at the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly and when he was come in he saith unto them why make you this ado and weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn but when he had put them all out he had to change the atmosphere when he put them all out he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel in them that were with him and then entered in there with the where the damsel was laying and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talithakumi which is being interpreted damsel i say to the arise and straightway the dams would arose and walked for she was of the age of 12 years and they were astonished with great astonishment amen jesus now he does this several times and brother brahma explains this to us he comes into this place and the atmosphere was not right there was no faith they didn't believe his words so he put them all out and he brought with him peter james and john himself the father and the mother and the damsel and it's amazing that that they walked in there there was there was six that that were in the room that were alive there was one that was laying there asleep so the one that laying there asleep was the seventh amen and jesus come and woke her up so the in the room there was as far as everybody else saw there was six but jesus knew there was seven the one just needed waking up and to wake her up he had to create the right atmosphere he had to get the unbelief out of the room amen he had to get the those who that were lamenting and wailing and disbelieving what he said he had to push them out of the room and he had to come in here and now with faith amen he had to wake up this one who was asleep and when they saw him come out there were seven alive that came out praise be to god amen somebody needs woke up this morning there's a there's a child of god laying asleep the seed is laying dormant somebody needs woke up amen let's create the right atmosphere let's push all the unbelief out and all the doubts and all the worries and all the anxiety about our problems let's push them out and let's all work to create an atmosphere of faith because god's going to wake somebody up amen somebody's going to wake up and there's going to be a damsel there's going to be a lad there's going to be somebody that is going to wake up when christ comes and touches them and says arise how's he going to do that he's going to call with his voice which is his word and he's going to wake them up jesus led one man outside the city brother branham said because of the unbelief the spiritual atmosphere of the city led him outside of the city to heal him amen there was one woman a woman of samaria he had to meet her alone because of the condition of her life and because you know even when his disciples showed up they had a little bit of an attitude even when his disciples finally showed up to the scene they wondered why he was talking to her right and here she is an outcast in society coming to the well at the wrong time of day amen and she probably grieves that she always has to go to the well alone for years it was probably everybody else visits at the well and they talk but because of my status i've got to come to the well alone amen but god needed her alone amen so jesus sent his disciples away on an errand because he didn't want any wrong attitudes about this woman amen she couldn't be in the city they had the wrong attitude about her he even sent his disciples away because they would have the wrong attitude about her but he created an atmosphere of faith so that he can wake up the seed that's laying inside of me amen sometimes we find ourselves alone and lonely amen don't worry about it amen maybe god wants you to be in a certain atmosphere so he can do a work in your life and if you find yourself alone for a season just look up and say god what is it you want to do in my life don't get in that atmosphere of gloom don't get in that atmosphere of depression don't give that atmosphere where you begin to feel sorry for yourself because of your condition you're gonna miss what god's doing keep the right atmosphere always believe in the face of every circumstance is always belief in 1956 brother brand preached the message to supernatural and in it he said but if we could ever get a group of people together where was genuine holy spirit atmosphere a sacredness and a sincerity in worship and men and women sitting in there are god-conscious and know that the great omnipotence of god is present ready to do all things without one shadow of a doubt it'll even have an effect upon the unbelievers that's sitting in this evening you can never come into that atmosphere without something happening praise be to god i like this quote because i read the one before that one skeptic one unbeliever amen can change the atmosphere but now brother branham's saying if everybody would get in the right atmosphere then it could affect the unbeliever and i hope i hope i hope i hope that in this building tonight is more believers than unbelievers i hope we can tilt the atmosphere i hope we have amen enough believers to to create the atmosphere that will affect the unbeliever not the unbeliever affect the believers but it's not going to happen amen without a conscious effort without deliberate effort amen we can't we we we we have to take the things the prophet gave us and the understanding that he taught us and we have to actually apply it amen we still fall back into traps and ourselves of thinking well you know god will take care of everything god will take care of everything but he gave us instructions for a reason he told us what to do and how to create an atmosphere and how to structure the church and what to do and what not to do he told us that for a reason we we think this is one thing that uh an understanding that i think is flawed and i want to i want to i'm going to put in a disclaimer i'm going to enter disclaimer right here i'm not preaching this because we have any problem i'm not dealing with a problem god laid it on my heart to deal with it so if i'm hitting a problem i'm doing it ignorantly praise be to god so pay attention as far as i know everything's fine but we cannot uh forsake the instructions that we have when god has told us what to do how to enter the church how to be sacred how to be prayerful how to come early we forsake that and don't do what he told us to do and think that somehow god will overlook our lack of obedience and he'll make everything work out anyhow this is what christians have done for generations when god comes and shows us how to overcome he teaches us how to create an atmosphere he shows us how to structure our church service and shows us how to come into the sanctuary and how to make it sacred and holy and how to be prayerful and he recommend coming 30 minutes early and all of these things that he did if we want to still stand in the foyer and talk to everybody until we hear the first song played and run in and we expect god to cover for that [Music] see we've got to take the right approach to what he gave us and if we go the right approach to what he gave us amen god is going to do what he promised to do amen but we have we have to do our part we have to believe what he gave us and apply it by faith and watch what god will do we can't take things trivial and lightly and expect the great power of god to overcome all my failings that's the wrong approach and the wrong attitude we think well you know what what will happen god forbid the day everybody forgets to pray for me and pray for the preaching and you just think well brother chad he's done it a couple hundred times it'll be fine god forbid i would ever have to stand here without a couple hundred people asking god to speak today please don't ever do that to me and please that's why i pray for the song leader i pray for the musicians i know what it's like i'm supporting them i'm praying that god will move through them amen oh god and put a right atmosphere in them that all the troubles of the day will vanish away and god will come on the scene and take i'm praying for them because i know what it's like we all need to be praying for them we need to pray for every part of the service everybody that's coming we need to pray for the young that's not born again we need to pray for those that need encourage we need to pray for the sick that will be healed we need to pray for the musicians and the song leader the sunday school teachers we need to pray for the minister behind the pulpit we need to pray for the deacons and trustees that god will get this thing right and god will move amongst us and god the the atmosphere will be right where seeds can spring to life we can't just constantly say well they got a gift it'll be fine now we're in this thing together let's create an atmosphere amen so brother branham said one unbeliever skeptic can change the atmosphere but he said if everybody will get into a holy ghost atmosphere it'll have an effect on the unbeliever that's the story that i'm looking for that's the goal i've got not that we are so weak in our atmosphere that one unbeliever coming in amen we'll ruin it for all of us but that we are so heavenly minded and we come here with such a definite purpose amen and we we come in the atmosphere of the holy ghost that that unbeliever will be affected by the atmosphere and affected by the atmosphere before the song ever starts amen brother bram said you can't put genuine corn in something that won't unless it's earth and it won't grow you can lay it in the sun and keep it warm you can do what you want but it takes a certain kind of earth it must be there it must be buried it must be under the right atmosphere to make it bring forth you can have a good seed but it's got to be in the right atmosphere in the right place amen we can have good word but we have to have the right atmosphere let's look at ephesians chapter four together ephesians chapter 4 verse 29 ephesians chapter 4 verse 29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace into the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed into the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be you kind one to another tender heart of forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you i say praise god let's not grieve the holy spirit of god let's not take any wrong attitudes or wrong speech or do things the wrong way and treat others the wrong way and create the wrong kind of atmosphere but let's not grieve the holy spirit but let's create an atmosphere that's welcoming and inviting to the holy spirit brother branham he begins to talk about us as individuals i've been talking about the atmosphere in the church but in the sanctuary but the the atmosphere amongst us as an individual he says i believe in heartfelt religion i believe that you feel it that god gives you something inside of you that changes you it makes the atmosphere around you different i've tried that i know it's the truth that man create in himself the atmosphere that he lives in and around him is anointed with a spirit i've seen people you just couldn't get away from them you just love them there's something drawing about them it's because they live in that atmosphere they live under the power of the holy spirit and another message he said did you ever get around anybody you've seen nice people that you couldn't hardly stand to be around them brother graham's just being honest they're nice people but you just couldn't hardly stand to be around them now you know that's right isn't it and i've seen people that maybe that you just love to be in their presence haven't you seen people like that do you realize that you're sons of god the atmosphere and the air that you live in you create a situation around you that either draws or pushes away you see we create an atmosphere and if we're conscious of the atmosphere we're creating we can be yielded to the word of god into the life of god and create the right kind of atmosphere around us or we can yield to the negative that is around us and begin to speak negative and talk negative and we will create a negative atmosphere i've been with people they they believe the message people who believe the message believe god sent a prophet believe they're part of the bride but they are constantly in a realm of negative amen and negative things are always happening to them and you think it's almost like it's almost like every day something bad happens because they were just waiting for something bad to happen they expected something bad to happen so something bad happened they created the atmosphere for negativity they created the atmosphere that drew negativity to them and they become victims of their own atmosphere thinking it's everybody else around them all the co-workers at work they all have an attitude everybody i work with has a bad attitude and i haven't met one nice person today did you see one when you brushed your teeth because that's where it all started see we we get confused by things that are around us but brother brenham told us being sons of god we have the power to create atmospheres and we can create an atmosphere around us we need to be speaking the word of god confessing by faith amen what god has done for us we need to be happy and positive and joyful in the midst of trials and we will create an overcoming atmosphere around us amen an inviting atmosphere that people want to come in contact with not a negative pessimistic the world is black everything's wrong listen if that's the kind of religion you propagate nobody wants it but if you can have joy when everybody else is is is is in remorse when you can be positive when everybody else is negative when you see what god is doing and it's a blessing in your life when everybody else feels cursed amen they're creating an atmosphere that will draw amen brother i'm in the message when divine love is projected sovereign grace takes its place he says this then when you become a son or daughter of god your disposition changes your attitude changes your your your look towards life and towards others changes it doesn't mean that you just have joined church it means that you have been regenerated you have become a new creation in christ jesus the old things have passed away and god has spoken to you and you have become a new creature i want this to go way down even into the church members then as you would love to be in the presence of christ and you become part of christ then people love to become in your presence because you become a part of god son and daughter of god did you ever see people that you just love to be in their presence there's just something about them that just radiates that you just love to talk to them and other people who are nice people yet we don't say this unkindly but you just can't hardly stay around them it is because of the atmosphere that you create for you as a son of god or a miniature creator because you are a part of god remember brother burleigh wednesday was talking about the world that we could create but we also create an atmosphere around us we are a miniature creator and if we and brother ben said each one of us are a little dynamo we put off a little atmosphere around us and if we could be conscious of that we could use that power that god's placed in us to create for good and not for evil we can do it to change the atmosphere amen not make it worse amen remember when brother branham amen had a lot of visitors to his house one day and his wife got upset and the kids were fussing on the floor and everything was a little bit out of kilter in his home amen and his wife was upset because she hadn't even fed the kids the house has been full of visitors the atmosphere wasn't right amen brother branham walked in there and he says now he goes i put on my apron and i began to help washing dishes and he said i'd walk past my wife and i just touched her on the back and i was silently praying this is important because he wasn't casting the demon of frustration off of his wife verbally that would not have changed the atmosphere he silently said lord help her lord help her then he began to change the atmosphere and he started talking about a dress that he saw on the window and like to buy it for so after a few minutes she was smiling everything was fine and here's my favorite part she said i'll finish these dishes you go on see if you do it right there's rewards but see he had the power to change that whole environment in his home but he could have come in and hushed up and snapped at the kids and told his wife don't you know i'm serving god's people what's this bad attitude he would have created the atmosphere would have gotten worse more frustrated more depressed it would take a long time to come out of that and we can create we are let's just say this way we are creating an atmosphere around us all the time because we are miniature creators not that we can create we are creating the question that we have to ask ourselves is what atmosphere am i creating now and we could ask ourselves that question amen it would give us the the right understanding i need to change what's coming out of my mouth i need to change my my i need to think on the things that are righteous and pure and holy and just i need to think on these things because the things that i'm thinking on are changing my attitude i need to go back to thinking on the things that are lovely the things that are just the things that be of good character of value that's what i need to think on because you realize i'm projecting the wrong atmosphere but i've got the power to direct project the right atmosphere because atmosphere is so necessary for the seed coming to life because in creation first he brought the light which is the word then he brought the atmosphere and after he brought the atmosphere then he exposed the seed to the light and it germinated and it brought life amen i want to read that let's go back to genesis chapter 1. genesis chapter 1 verse 9. and god said let the waters under heaven be gathered together into one place and let the dry land appear and it was so and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of waters called he sees and god saw that it was good and god said let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed in the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after its kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after its kind and god saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were the third day see god in order to bring the seeds that he knew were there he knew they were there so the spirit of god began to move to brood and god began to speak the word and the when the holy ghost began to brood amen and bring the conditions right to bring the seed out of the ground and first he brought the light which was the right light for the season and then he created the right atmosphere and then finally he parted the water and exposed the seed to the light and when the seed was finally exposed to the light because the light was already there and the atmosphere was right when he parted the waters amen it sprung to life and began to bear fruit and sometimes we're shrouded we come into this earth shrouded we're under the i would say it this way we're under the flood of our spirit realm of our own mind of our own humanity but somehow god will part the water amen to let the seed get exposed to the light but the light must already be there and the atmosphere must be right for when god depart the water for the light to strike the seed and bring it to life amen i believe our children and men and our young people have seeds laying there that have to come to life we must never forget that that that we are growing in christ amen and that our children coming up amen they need they need to have a light god's provided the light we must preach the light they need the right atmosphere we must create the atmosphere in here but we must create the atmosphere in our homes as well because you can erase what we're doing here in your home with the wrong attitude in your home and then that seed is walking around constantly in the wrong atmosphere amen and and god's going to have to do some great work amen to bring the right atmosphere to bring the right life to that seed amen but in our homes amen if god has given us children we need to create the right atmosphere in our home and keep that atmosphere godly and keep it god centered and keep it focused on the word of god amen so that god when he wants he can part the water of that spirit realm and let the light strike that seed and bring forth amen what he has always intended to bring forth god knows the seed's there amen we gotta we gotta keep preaching the word that is the light for our day we have to keep it constantly amen constantly in the open constantly shining brighter and brighter and brighter and then we need to create the right atmosphere amen by the brooding of the holy ghost by the holy spirit working in our lives creating the right atmosphere that god can part the waters and let the light strike the seed amen we can't i tell you it'd be a shame an absolute shame to have a home that's contrary to the word and expect our kids to be born again in the church service or at a camp when we have a we have kept them in the wrong atmosphere for how many years kept them in the wrong atmosphere entertained by the wrong things with the wrong kinds of discussion going on in the wrong attitudes and we expect that they can get a two-hour exposure to the right atmosphere that will wash out the weeks of bad atmosphere that we have in our home see we deceive ourselves by not getting in god's program we think god's just always going to cover it it's always no god has told us what to do and god is on partnership with man and he's given us instructions if we'll just do what he told us to do he'll do the part that we can't do what a shame it is the thing that we can send our kids to a youth meeting and that there the seed will come to life but at home we have arguing we're fussing we have criticism about amen others in the church amen we don't fully apply the token in our home we don't take what the prophet taught us but we mingle we mix we allow things he told us to throw out of our house we bring in things that he told us not to have we discuss things that are not godly and that's the atmosphere that that little seed has to sit in all the time and we wonder why sometimes they struggle and they struggle and they struggle i said god help us to create the right atmosphere at least help us to do our part if i've got the holy ghost in me i should be able to create a holy ghost environment in my house we should be able to create the right environment in our fellowships we should be able to create the right environment in our church services we should be able to create the right environment in our homes and if we can then we trust god to do the part that we can't do i i believe we need to be conscious of these things so much we just keep putting stuff over on god god you do this and you do this and you do that and god says but i sent a prophet in this day to teach you how to do that i taught you how to talk to your children i taught you how to have family devotions that family alter i taught you how to come into the church and create an atmosphere i taught you why do we keep shoveling off on god when god so graciously brought a prophet in our day to give it to us i say god teach me teach me god forgive me lord and teach me teach me how to let that spirit flow through me teach me how to change the atmosphere in my home teaching me how to speak positive instead of negative how to speak the word and display the word instead of allowing the world and the corruption of the world to constantly take over in my home help us god tell your friends god has given us so much but to whom much is given much is required there's never been an age that has as much light as we have or has been given such clear instruction from god on how to conduct almost every facet of our life how to conduct ourselves at work how to conduct ourselves between husband and wife how to conduct ourselves between parents and children how to act in the church how to treat believers we have been given so much instruction and demonstration in this age but too much is given much is required i think we can all say god help us help us do better lord help us to surrender help us to yield to your spirit amen i want to see genuine new births taking place i want to see those seeds that are buried under the earth i want to see him come to life and i want to see him grow and i want to see him bearing fruit amen because that's what god had in his mind before the foundational world that's why they're sowed in this generation they're here to bring forth bride fruit amen fruit like unto jesus christ that's why they're here i want to see it in all of our young people all of our children all of our visitors everyone that comes in i want to see that seed come to life and i want to see it bear fruit amen we must keep it in the right atmosphere i remember it says something based off revelation chapter one let's turn there he says something in the church age book that i really enjoy and i've been meditating on it a lot and he takes it from revelation chapter 1. so turn there together revelation chapter 1 verse 9. i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation in in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the aisle that has called patmos for the word of the lord and for the testimony of jesus christ and i was in the spirit on the lord's day and i heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet and brother branham's going to refer to verse 10 here and he says i was in the spirit isn't that just beautiful my i love that you could just call those words the whole of the christian life i was in the spirit that's the phrase he's pointing out but john was in the spirit on the lord's day but he says he just takes the phrase i was in the spirit and he said that could just we you could just call those words the whole of the christian life so what is the whole of the christian life supposed to be to be in the spirit if we are going to live as christians we have to be in his spirit john was not talking about being in his own spirit that would not have brought these visions it had to be the spirit of god it has to be the spirit of god with us too or all of our efforts are in vain paul said i will pray in the spirit i will sing in the spirit i will live in the spirit if there is anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results it bears as surely as john needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous revelations fresh from jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that god has given to us to live by in his word for it is the same spirit we have to get in the spirit we have to live in the spirit but there's there's so many things have a spirit to it brother branham was talking here just past this in the church age book he says you see people go to a ball game or they go to a dance he says they can never enjoy it unless they get in the spirit of it you get in the spirit of the ball game you get in the spirit of the dance you get spirit of the race or you get in the spirit of whatever and when they get into the spirit of it amen they get caught up in it and they begin to enjoy it they become part of it amen and it brings them great joy and great pleasure because they got in the spirit of it but is it just like that we have to get into the spirit of this word amen we must get in the spirit which means how many how do you get into the spirit of the ball game amen you know what if somebody has zero interest in baseball they don't know who the players are they don't know who the teams are they don't know how to keep score they don't know what's happening they mean they show up at a ball game and they're gonna be like everybody's cheering what are you cheering for that was a home run is that a good thing i mean he just struck out the whole side on the inning is that that's good right that's good you don't you're not in the spirit of it you don't know what's going on you don't know what everybody's rejoicing about i mean you've got to get in the spirit of it and if we want to get in the spirit this day we've got to get into the message of the hour we've got to know what everybody's cheering about we got to be in prayer we got to ask god to change us change our mind change our thoughts change our desires get us lined up with this bride word for this day amen or else everybody else is talking about the message and talking about the bride amen and you're trying to cheer when others are cheering but you don't always know what others are cheering about you've got to get in the spirit we got to get in the spirit of this word we got to spend time we have to know who the players are we have to know uh how long has this rivalry been going on amen we have to know who the players are we have to know amen what's happened before and what's going on and and how god has brought the word through seven church ages but now in this day he has unlocked the mystery that's been in the back of his mind and what does that even mean amen he's brought to us the fullness of redemption what does that even mean amen we're what are we excited about amen what is happening what's going on all around us amen we've got to get into the spirit of this thing we've got to say god show me your word reveal it to me we got to read the message we got to listen to the prophet's voice we got to fellowship about these things and when we get into the spirit of it amen it begins to manifest in our life and we have tremendous joy about the word of god we're no longer the outsider trying to fit in amen but we're right in we've got into the spirit of it amen when they go to the dance amen they let the music start to move them they get out on the dance floor they they get into the rhythm of it and they begin to enjoy it amen there's a symphony going on now and there's a rhythm to the music that god is playing because god is he has promised to restore all that those uh those four creatures ate to restore the bride back it fell almost in ruin amen all the way back in the dark ages amen what god brought forth at pentecost was supposed to grow into the perfect church but it began to decline amen and almost was wiped out in the dark ages but there was a prophecy i will restore saith the lord what's he restoring he's bringing back the bride tree is that something to get excited about brother chad it just depends on if you're in the spirit or not right what does that mean for me get in the spirit and you'll find out we've got to give ourselves to this word give ourselves to this message and quit giving ourselves to everything else that's coming down the pike we give ourselves to every other fad and and every other thing that's going around we need to give ourselves to this message to the word of god for our day and say lord let your spirit let me get into the spirit of this word to where i can be that bride that you're looking for the holy ghost has been brooding over the last the last church ages he's been brooding what's he been brooding for what's the holy ghost brooding what's it cooing what's it hovering over the church for it's trying to bring back the second part of the masterpiece it was brooding over the old testaments to bring back another son of god in the image of god and it brought jesus christ the perfect reflection of god the last adam the son of god restored but there was another part to that logos there was a bride and now he's been brooding brooding watt creating bringing the word creating the atmosphere amen parting the waters bringing up life what's he bringing he's bringing back the other part of the he's bringing back the bride tree he's bringing back the other part of the tree of life because they're male and female and he's brooding and bringing back what's he doing the same thing he did in genesis he brewed it and brooded and brewed it till he brought something up that reflected his very image and now the holy ghost is brooding over the bride over the church to bring a bride that'll be in his very image a perfect reflection of jesus christ and the formation of a bride and we have to get in that spirit and the spirit of that revelation and create that atmosphere around us and watch it change our lives and not just ours watch it change other people's lives i want to get in the spirit of this word means that i must surrender myself to it i must spend time seeking the lord i can't just live life running from pillar to post i've got to stop and spend time with god i got to get into the spirit of things this is a busy world and we all feel the time constraints and crunch of a busy world but if i'm going to get into the spirit of this i've got to have time to get into the spirit i've got to have time to pray and seek god's face i have to have time to spend seeking after the lord and letting him change me we have to have time to pray friends it seems like such an odd thing to have to say to christian people but the world we live in is trying to steal every spare moment we have and trying to strip us from the very things that gives us the most strength to chase after things that never yield strength chasing after another accomplishment or finishing another task or getting something else done or another project and we always think after this i mean how many times have i told myself after this i'll slow down after this i'll get in a better routine after this after this guess what what comes after this another thing until we've got to get to the place and says i am not giving myself to this i'm yielding myself to the spirit of god i'm going to stop and say god i'm taking this time and i'm seeking your face because i need a strength and i need to create an atmosphere that i can't do running all over the place and i need time listen friends we need time to read this bible it seems odd that we're the bride of jesus christ we have to tell ourselves this but this is the life that we live in we have to dedicate time to read this bible we have to read the message we have to hear the voice of the prophet and we can't always do it when we're on the run sometimes we need to sit down and spend time with the word get into the spirit of it because i promise you it's the only thing that's going to keep us in this day we all get too busy we all i mean maybe some of you are blessed in a position of life where you can have a little more time if you do use it for the kingdom of god use it be in prayer for your brothers and sisters intercede for them spend time praying for the services amen reaching out to others those that life is full have children have work and have all that you must diligently carve out some time and say i'm not giving this time away anymore i must seek his face i must get into the spirits amen and be diligent about it this is an evil wicked world we live in and we must be constantly surrendered to the word we must get in the spirit and let the spirit of god brood over us in drawing us to a higher life to a higher life to a higher life until we can bring to us into the very reflection of jesus christ himself that's the day and age we live in we must create an atmosphere we must surrender all i say go on help me help me god we're not a people who want to have the wrong atmosphere we're not a people who want to be chasing the world this is the devil's satan's eden but we're a people who say god come and take this vessel under your control how many just want to say god i need help i need help let's all stand together musicians have come i don't want to preach anymore i want to take the things that god has given us and instructed us in this message and i don't want to be dilatory but i want to be diligent i want to be found faithful brother branham he comes to the book of revelations and he talks about the one riding on the white horse and he says behind him follow those the army of god who are uh called faithful and chosen he said they're called he said they're chosen by god you didn't do that yourself but he said they're faithful by their own choosing i said god that's who i want to be i want to be faithful by my own choosing the day is wicked and i believe the day is short and i want to create such an atmosphere around me and an atmosphere in this place that'll have an effect on unbelievers amen god has been so good to us he has been so faithful especially in this assembly he's been so good to us he's rescued for us from where we were and brought us into a different place than where we were and we've we've we've we've went through a revival back to the word back reviving the life within us amen but there's always a cycle of revival and death that has to be broken in the end time and there's got to be a revival unto life not unto another denominational revival but one that will go from life into life and the life and the life from word and to word unto word from manifestation unto manifestation until the final manifestation and there's a change of the body this is not time to slip back into a relaxed state and it's not time amen to to stop laboring in the word and creating an atmosphere getting in the spirit being diligent and faithful amen i want to i want to see our young people born again i want to see our children born again i don't want them to float along in an atmosphere with a church that's been stabilized and the word is now here and in obedience and i don't want our young people to float along in a good church amen i want to be an atmosphere that will bring something deep into the heart and awaken something that might be laying dormant there and call it out and call it to life i don't want a form i don't want a ritual i don't want a program i don't want a sequence of services of routine i don't want any of that when i want is a life a powerful life on display i want the power of god and the brooding of the holy ghost to move in this place and grab the hearts of those who aren't converted yet i don't want it to be a comfortable place for people just to come to church i want it to be a place where the power of god hits somebody right in the heart and they say oh god save me forgive me fill me with your holy ghost i want it to be the kind of place where it has such impact on somebody they'll say god i don't know what it is i need but i want whatever they got and i want in me whatever this is around me amen let's work together to do what we've been told to do consciously and awarely to create the right atmosphere the atmosphere for what the atmosphere for life the atmosphere for the seed to come to life let's labor together let's spend time in the word let's let's let's labor to stay in the atmosphere and stay in the spirit and let's come here in the spirit and let's come early and let's be diligent and let's pray let's spend time seeking the lord say god speak today god drive out every wrong spirit from this place and let your holy ghost move with free reign in this place strike lives change hearts bring deliverance amen don't let one service be routine this is a as an assembly if i have a desire this would be my desire if i could pass my desire to you and we could all share this together let's not let one service be routine let's make each one a special encounter with the spirit of god as the word of god moves forth that it will do a special work in our lives and let's stay focused on these things because they matter the most amen let's just bow our heads and pray together lord jesus i thank you father god you know my heart and the desire of my heart lord the things that you stirred inside of me god i pray that you would help the message to be conveyed in the right way not just human words striking human minds god it'll all fall apart it'll be misunderstood but god if it's spiritually inspired words coming by your spirit into the heart of your children may it take root and produce life help us lord to be faithful of our own choosing to faithfully follow after your commandments to be diligent and purposeful in our lives to be diligent and purposeful in the way we come to church may we be constantly looking for you to do the supernatural to change lives to stir up people's lives to quicken seeds to life lord that are laying there dormant i pray god that you would do all of those things and more than we ever thought of i pray that you would heal the sick under the preaching of the word i pray that you would heal homes lord that you would heal marriages that you would heal broken hearts amen in the atmosphere under the preaching of the word may the full light of the gospel shine forth and may your holy ghost go to brooding and change lives lord forever i pray you'd give our children new birth experiences where the seeds within them will be quickened to life lord god i pray that you would work sovereignly lord as we are found faithful serving you may you work through us lord and work in us help us to keep the right atmosphere help us to preach the right light god then we ask that you would do what no man can do that you would part the waters and let the light strike the seed may it come to life we love you
