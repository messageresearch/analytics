========================================

it'd be a shame an absolute shame to have a home that's contrary to the word and expect our kids to be born again in the church service or at a camp when we have a we have kept them in the wrong atmosphere for how many years kept them in the wrong atmosphere entertained by the wrong things with the wrong kinds of discussion going on in the wrong attitudes and we expect that they can get a two-hour exposure to the right atmosphere that will wash out the weeks of bad atmosphere that we have in our home see we deceive ourselves by not getting in god's program we think god's just always going to cover it it's always no god has told us what to do and god is on partnership with man and he's given us instructions if we'll just do what he told us to do he'll do the part that we can't do what a shame it is the thing that we can send our kids to a youth meeting and that there the seed will come to life but at home we have arguing we're fussing we have criticism about amen others in the church amen we don't fully apply the token in our home we don't take what the prophet taught us but we mingle we mix we allow things he told us to throw out of our house we bring in things that he told us not to have we discuss things that are not godly and that's the atmosphere that that little seed has to sit in all the time and we wonder why sometimes they struggle and they struggle and they struggle i say god help us to create the right atmosphere at least help us to do our part if i've got the holy ghost in me i should be able to create a holy ghost environment in my house we should be able to create the right environment in our fellowships we should be able to create the right environment in our church services we should be able to create the right environment in our homes and if we can then we trust god to do the part that we can't do but i believe we need to be conscious of these things so much we just keep putting stuff over on god god you do this and you do this and you do that and god says but i sent a prophet in this day to teach you how to do that i taught you how to talk to your children i taught you how to have family devotions that family alter i taught you how to come into the church and create an atmosphere i taught you why do we keep shoveling off on god when god so graciously brought a prophet in our day to give it to us i say god teach me teach me god forgive me lord and teach me teach me how to let that spirit flow through me teach me how to change the atmosphere in my home teaching me how to speak positive instead of negative how to speak the word and display the word instead of allowing the world and the corruption of the world to constantly take over in my home help us god tell your friends god has given us so much but to whom much is given much is required
