[0:00] it's good to be together this evening
[0:02] good to see you all
[0:04] let's take our bibles and turn to the
[0:06] book of revelation
[0:11] chapter 19.
[0:14] we're going to continue on with where we
[0:16] were
[0:17] on sunday we didn't get a chance to
[0:19] finish and
[0:21] so we're back today and we're going to
[0:23] keep going down the same path we've been
[0:25] going lord's been really good to us
[0:27] so we thank him for that
[0:30] and let's read revelation 19
[0:35] verse 11. and i saw heaven open and
[0:39] behold a white horse and
[0:41] he that sat upon him was called faithful
[0:44] and true
[0:45] and in righteousness he that judge and
[0:46] make war his eyes were as a flame of
[0:49] fire and on his head were many crowns
[0:52] and he had a name written that no man
[0:54] knew but he himself
[0:55] and he was clothed with a vesture dipped
[0:57] in blood and his name was called the
[0:59] word of god
[1:00] and the armies were trent which were in
[1:02] heaven
[1:03] followed him upon white horses clothed
[1:05] in fine linen
[1:06] white and clean and out of his mouth go
[1:09] with a sharp sword that
[1:10] with it he should smite the nations and
[1:13] he shall rule them with a rod of iron
[1:14] and he treadeth the winepress of the
[1:16] fierceness
[1:17] and wrath of almighty god he had on his
[1:20] vesture and on his
[1:21] thigh a name written king of kings and
[1:24] lord of lords
[1:25] let's turn over to chapter 17 and read
[1:28] verse 14
[1:29] before we pray revelation 17 and 14
[1:34] these shall make war with the lamb and
[1:35] the lamb shall overcome them for he is
[1:37] lord of lords and king of kings and they
[1:40] that are with him are called
[1:42] and chosen and faithful
[1:45] let's bow our heads dear heavenly father
[1:47] we thank you lord for this wonderful
[1:49] wonderful time
[1:50] lord as we come together to worship your
[1:53] name to sing your praises lord we just
[1:56] we just receive you now lord we welcome
[1:58] you in our midst because you promised to
[2:00] be here lord
[2:02] god as we look into your word we're
[2:03] asking that you would feed your sheep
[2:05] this evening we've come hungry lord
[2:07] we've come to you because we know you're
[2:09] faithful to keep your word
[2:10] and that you will distribute it lord in
[2:12] our portion that we need today
[2:15] i pray that you move the man to the side
[2:17] and that you would take full control
[2:18] that your holy spirit would have liberty
[2:20] that you would bind every spirit
[2:22] contrary to your spirit
[2:24] anything that would try to work contrary
[2:25] to what you're doing
[2:27] you would bind it now and lord that your
[2:29] holy ghost would have free reign
[2:31] we give you ourselves in jesus christ's
[2:33] name we pray
[2:34] amen you can all be seated
[2:40] before we get into that i just wanted to
[2:42] say thank you for sunday
[2:44] there was a dinner afterwards and there
[2:47] was a pastor of appreciation
[2:49] and angie and i would just like to say
[2:51] thank you we appreciate you all so much
[2:53] and
[2:53] we were surprised and overwhelmed and
[2:56] a little uncomfortable and it's always a
[2:59] little
[3:00] challenging but one thing i appreciate
[3:02] is your respect for god's gifts
[3:04] and i pray that god will always honor
[3:05] you for that amen i think it's a good
[3:08] thing
[3:09] and i was a little uncomfortable and
[3:11] wishing that we hadn't done that and
[3:13] all of those things until i opened the
[3:15] gift and then when i saw that page out
[3:18] of the original
[3:19] edition of the 1611 king james bible
[3:22] i wasn't embarrassed anymore and i
[3:24] wasn't wishing we hadn't done it
[3:25] i was totally excited that was
[3:28] we really appreciate that everybody who
[3:30] contributed that means a lot
[3:32] that that one page out of that bible and
[3:34] it was joshua chapter one
[3:37] that is a dear treasure to me and i
[3:39] always treasure it as long as i'm on
[3:40] this earth so
[3:41] thank you so much we appreciate that i
[3:44] also want to remind you that brother
[3:45] craig is going down

[3:54] would encourage all of you who live down
[3:55] south and can get there easy for the
[3:57] saturday night service
[3:58] i know it'd be an encouragement to the
[4:00] assembly there they would appreciate
[4:01] that and
[4:02] i'm sure brother craig would appreciate
[4:03] that i think it'd be nice if we could
[4:05] show our support for that so

[4:56] assembly so
[4:57] hope that you all can make it there
[4:59] that'll be very very exciting
[5:01] can we bring up that powerpoint now
[5:04] i want to continue on and i want to look
[5:06] at two armies
[5:08] as we as we look at the book of
[5:10] revelation and we see that
[5:12] that in revelation 19
[5:16] we see christ coming riding on a white
[5:18] horse
[5:19] and the armies of heaven are following
[5:21] after him riding on white horses
[5:23] so we just want to take a look at that
[5:25] that army that's following after him
[5:27] today briefly
[5:29] we know that we're looking from we're
[5:32] looking from perspective of an open book
[5:34] not a closed book but an open book and
[5:36] that changes everything
[5:38] i remember as being a little boy
[5:41] i was always attracted to the book of
[5:43] revelation and now i find it comical
[5:46] because i
[5:46] had no explanation for why a little boy
[5:50] 11
[5:51] 10 11 12 13 years old would read the
[5:53] book of revelation
[5:54] by the time i was 15 or 16 i think i had
[5:57] read the entire book of revelation
[5:59] through three or four times
[6:01] now why would a little boy do that you
[6:03] know but
[6:04] now i know why you know god always
[6:07] he if you just hang on god will show you
[6:09] many many times
[6:11] the mysteries of your life but to me it
[6:14] was always a closed book
[6:15] all i saw was dragons and multiple head
[6:18] beasts and horses of different colors
[6:20] and
[6:20] and all of these things and and i'm sure
[6:23] as a boy it was fascinating swords
[6:25] coming out of mouths and wings on
[6:26] creatures
[6:27] and it really didn't mean anything to me
[6:29] but but as
[6:30] gone you know brought a prophet on the
[6:32] scene to unveil these things
[6:34] and the seals became open now we're
[6:36] reading out of an open book
[6:38] and now it's not a fantasy it's not a
[6:40] fairy tale it's not a
[6:42] coloring page book this is reality to us
[6:45] and we're seeing it with open eyes
[6:46] looking at an open book
[6:48] and we thank god for them so much of the
[6:51] bible for so many people
[6:53] is a fairy tale amen it's just
[6:56] stories a collection of stories and
[6:58] they're cute and they're whimsical and
[7:00] and they just talk about a god who loves
[7:02] everybody and they don't even
[7:04] they don't even understand that there's
[7:05] more to the story
[7:07] but we thank god that he's been merciful
[7:10] to us
[7:11] amen you know i was witnessing to a man
[7:14] the other day
[7:15] last week and i had just a few minutes
[7:18] to talk to him
[7:19] and he made a joke and it wasn't at all
[7:21] an off-color joke but in the joke he
[7:23] he mentioned eating the apple and the we
[7:26] all have fallen in sin and come short of
[7:27] the glory of god
[7:29] and so that was my open door and so i
[7:32] went and for 15 minutes i just laid out
[7:34] serpent seed
[7:36] and i asked him i said man i've always
[7:38] wondered
[7:39] what kind of fruit could somebody eat
[7:42] and their eyes would be open and they
[7:43] would realize they're naked
[7:45] and then they'd make an apron and not
[7:47] put it over their mouth where they just
[7:48] sinned with but they would make aprons
[7:50] for their bodies
[7:51] and so i went through all of these
[7:53] questions why virgin birth and the man's
[7:54] like yeah why yeah
[7:56] why so i just went to the punch line i
[7:58] said you know adultery is the only thing
[8:00] that works that answers all these
[8:01] questions
[8:02] and the guy looked at me goes where do
[8:03] you go to church
[8:07] but i gave him a card and told him
[8:08] invited him to watch and i said really
[8:11] our joy is seeing the bible come alive
[8:14] and realizing
[8:15] that this isn't a picture book that we
[8:17] give to kids
[8:18] this isn't just little little stories
[8:20] about a noah and a boat and
[8:22] abraham and sarah but this is a reality
[8:24] to us
[8:25] and there's something god's trying to
[8:27] tell us and we desperately want to know
[8:29] it
[8:30] and so to me it was just exciting just
[8:32] to be able to have that interaction
[8:34] because god has opened our eyes so
[8:37] that's what we're reading from
[8:38] an open book went through this quote on
[8:41] sunday but i want to
[8:42] rehearse it again because it's a
[8:44] principle that we must understand
[8:46] or many of the things brother benham
[8:48] teaches are not going to make any sense
[8:49] to us
[8:50] if we don't see this principle in the
[8:51] scriptures
[8:53] in this message brother branham said
[8:55] during this time of joel's prophecy
[8:57] here the church was in a terrible
[8:59] condition
[9:01] so he's talking about something that's
[9:02] happening in the days that joel is alive
[9:06] and he said it's a terrible condition
[9:08] backslid just prior to the coming of the
[9:09] lord the first time
[9:11] see and how that the spirit come upon
[9:14] this prophet
[9:16] and he foresaw things and he saw the
[9:18] condition of the jews
[9:19] and he saw the condition of the church
[9:21] in this day so at the same time
[9:24] when joel is looking at these things he
[9:28] is seeing
[9:29] something that's happening in his day in
[9:32] a reality in his day
[9:33] he's also seeing the condition of the
[9:35] jews at the time jesus would come
[9:38] and he's seeing the condition of the
[9:39] church today
[9:42] and and joel doesn't tell you that when
[9:44] he writes out the bible
[9:46] amen because because god was laying it
[9:50] in there
[9:50] so that a prophet could come down and
[9:52] pull it out and show us
[9:54] and and we know that joel the prophecy
[9:56] that joel gave
[9:57] came to pass in the day that joel was
[9:59] alive and shortly after there was a
[10:02] the syrians came down and they ravished
[10:04] the land and they
[10:05] they ate it all down and then there was
[10:06] a restoration back
[10:08] but then we know that the same thing
[10:10] happened in the in the days
[10:11] of jesus the jewish church had gotten
[10:14] whittled down and destroyed
[10:16] and then it came back because peter said
[10:18] this is the prophecy
[10:19] this is what's happening what what the
[10:21] prophet joel has said
[10:23] but then brother branham could pick it
[10:24] up and say it's for our day
[10:26] so now we have to realize when we read
[10:28] prophecy we cannot pigeonhole it just
[10:30] here
[10:31] and say it will not fit anywhere else
[10:33] because if you do that
[10:34] you'll miss many things that the prophet
[10:36] is telling us
[10:38] this is why the message is broken into
[10:40] so many camps
[10:42] right this is why we're already in the
[10:45] wedding supper or the wedding supper's
[10:46] uh coming right or we've already married
[10:50] no we don't get married to the meeting
[10:51] in the air
[10:52] and the answer to the question is that
[10:53] they're both true
[10:55] brother venom said we don't we don't go
[10:57] to the wedding we're married here
[10:59] right and he said that in 1964 and
[11:01] proving his word but after that he says
[11:03] we go to the wedding the meeting in the
[11:05] air
[11:06] because there's a spiritual union an
[11:08] invisible union
[11:09] and there's a visible union right
[11:11] there's one that takes place
[11:13] now in your soul where you're united
[11:15] with christ so the baptism of the holy
[11:17] ghost
[11:18] but there's one that'll come when your
[11:20] physical body meets his physical body in
[11:22] the air
[11:23] and so we have to realize that these
[11:25] same prophecies
[11:27] and these statements that the prophet's
[11:28] making many times they're spiritual and
[11:31] natural if not we'll divide in two
[11:33] different camps and throw bombs at each
[11:34] other and hate one another
[11:36] when we're both got a portion of truth
[11:40] right so we've got to be very very
[11:42] careful how we handle the word
[11:44] and just listen to what the prophet said
[11:46] and just believe what he said
[11:49] it may twist you all up in knots for a
[11:51] while but eventually god will settle it
[11:53] all out
[11:53] and show you how it all fits just don't
[11:55] change what he said just take what he
[11:57] said
[11:58] and wait for god to make it fit into
[12:00] place don't take
[12:01] hammers and drive it drive those puzzle
[12:03] pieces down from the work don't take
[12:05] your scissors out
[12:06] and trim a little bit you just leave it
[12:08] alone until it fits
[12:09] because when it fits it's beautiful
[12:15] so now we see that there's been two
[12:17] vines and these two vines started in
[12:19] heaven when there was rebellion in
[12:20] heaven
[12:21] when lucifer rebelled and him and
[12:23] michael had a great war
[12:25] and we followed those vines all the way
[12:26] through
[12:28] and this quote we read before but i just
[12:31] want to rehearse a couple of these
[12:32] things
[12:33] said that great first battle that was
[12:35] ever fought began in heaven when michael
[12:36] and his angels fought against lucifer
[12:38] and his angels
[12:39] it first started the first battle was in
[12:41] heaven so sin did not originate on earth
[12:44] it originated in heaven and then it was
[12:47] thrown down from heaven cast out of
[12:49] heaven to the earth and fell on human
[12:50] beings
[12:51] then the battle from angels became human
[12:54] battles
[12:54] so now they're not angelic battles
[12:57] anymore
[12:58] so this battle that started in heaven we
[13:00] must understand this
[13:01] is not an angelic battle anymore it's a
[13:04] human battle
[13:07] and satan come to destroy god's creation
[13:09] what god had created
[13:10] to be for himself satan came to destroy
[13:12] this
[13:13] that's what this purpose was was to
[13:15] destroy it then the battle began
[13:17] here on earth and begin in
[13:21] us and has been raging ever since
[13:25] so this battle that started in heaven
[13:27] where is that battle taking place right
[13:29] now
[13:30] it's taking place right here so the
[13:32] battle between lucifer
[13:34] and michael the battle for lucifer to
[13:36] overcome god's word by deception
[13:38] that battle is raging right here
[13:42] every day right here do you know where
[13:43] the battle is the battle's here
[13:45] when you look in the mirror now you're
[13:47] looking at the battlefield the battle
[13:49] place the place of battle
[13:50] and brother bam talked about this and
[13:52] greatest battle ever fought he said
[13:53] these two great armies
[13:54] had to find a place with a common ground
[13:56] where they would come and battle it out
[13:58] and they chose the mind of man it was
[14:00] the battlefield
[14:01] so we see that it's true the battle is
[14:03] going on in
[14:04] us see you see how if you don't realize
[14:08] this
[14:08] how we're going to be walking in the
[14:10] traps all the time and falling down and
[14:12] stumbling because we have no idea where
[14:13] the battle is
[14:14] the battle's over here it's over there
[14:16] it's in this group and it's just church
[14:17] or in that family
[14:18] and we don't realize the battle that
[14:20] took place in heaven
[14:21] now is taking place in me then i'm going
[14:24] to be
[14:25] totally deceived to what the devil's
[14:26] doing and i'm going to be just following
[14:28] the pied piper all the way
[14:30] into all kinds of trouble but we have to
[14:32] realize the problem
[14:34] the battle is right here that's why we
[14:36] have to feed on the word
[14:37] we have to stay in prayer there are no
[14:40] options we can't take
[14:41] days off from being a christian we can't
[14:44] go on vacation from feeding on the word
[14:46] and laying before the presence of the
[14:48] lord and asking for the spirit to direct
[14:50] our lives because the battle never stops
[14:53] so we can't say i'm tired i'm going to
[14:55] take a day off i'm not praying today i'm
[14:57] not reading my bible today
[14:58] i'm not listening to the word today just
[15:00] as soon as you do that the battle has
[15:02] never stopped
[15:03] you just stop gaining ground
[15:06] so there's no days off the devil doesn't
[15:08] take a day off we don't take a day off
[15:12] if you ever notice when you go on
[15:13] vacation you get out of your routine and
[15:15] you stop your prayer life
[15:17] and you stop your devotional time that
[15:19] by the time you get back you're starting
[15:21] to dry up
[15:23] and you've had a good time and you saw
[15:25] some beautiful sights and you had some
[15:26] time from family
[15:27] but spiritually you're drying up when
[15:29] you get back
[15:31] now i don't think vacation has to be
[15:33] that way i think you can go on vacation
[15:35] and see some beautiful sights spend some
[15:37] time from family
[15:38] and refresh your soul with the word of
[15:40] god daily
[15:42] man we've got to be careful there's no
[15:44] days off no vacation from being a son of
[15:46] god
[15:48] amen the seventh series says there's an
[15:52] old battle that started way
[15:53] back beyond time and satan and his
[15:56] angels was kicked out and when they come
[15:58] to earth and the battle set in again
[16:00] because eve broke down the barrier from
[16:02] where she was isolated
[16:03] behind the word of god and from that
[16:05] very hour satan won the battle over
[16:07] god's word
[16:09] because one of his subjects the weaker
[16:12] let down the bar it doesn't take
[16:15] ten it doesn't take fifty it doesn't
[16:18] take a hundred it takes
[16:19] one and if one subject lets down the bar
[16:23] on the word
[16:24] then satan has victory over the word
[16:26] that's why god has restored his word
[16:29] amen excuse me and that's exactly how
[16:33] he's won the battle every time
[16:34] has become been because one of his
[16:36] subjects let down the bar from the word
[16:40] now now if you notice in these quotes
[16:42] i'm going to be bouncing
[16:43] quite a bit today between the fourth
[16:45] seal and the feast of trumpets
[16:47] and they run very much parallel the
[16:49] fourth seal and the feast of trumpets
[16:51] and we'll have a few other quotes
[16:52] mingled in there but but it's very
[16:54] important that we realize that
[16:56] now look what this is all coming to
[16:58] we're in the fourth seal
[16:59] we've come all the way through the
[17:00] church ages we're to the fourth seal
[17:02] and brother bam saying what is all this
[17:04] coming to it's
[17:05] going right back the way it did it
[17:07] started in heaven it's coming to the end
[17:09] time battle
[17:11] the first thing in heaven was a battle
[17:13] lucifer was kicked out and come to earth
[17:14] and he polluted eden
[17:16] then he's been polluting ever since but
[17:18] now from the battle in heaven it's come
[17:20] to the battle on earth and it's to be
[17:21] finished on earth at the time
[17:23] in a battle called armageddon now anyone
[17:26] knows that the battle started in heaven
[17:28] and so they kicked them out michael and
[17:30] his angels overthrew them just run out
[17:33] and when they did dropped right down
[17:34] into eden and here started the battle
[17:36] down here
[17:37] so we've seen the battle plan we've seen
[17:39] what lucifer has done to deceive the
[17:41] church through the church ages
[17:42] and we've modeled that and what happens
[17:44] in our lives we can look and see what
[17:46] happened in the church ages and now we
[17:48] understand every one of our backslidings
[17:50] in every one of our falls
[17:51] because it always follows the same
[17:52] pattern but god has given a way of
[17:55] escape
[17:56] but now we're looking just at this last
[17:58] portion here
[17:59] the eagle battling out death the pale
[18:02] horse
[18:05] in the fourth seal he says here we see
[18:06] life and death
[18:08] coming to the final struggle the white
[18:11] horse of true life
[18:12] the pale horse of mixed creed you see
[18:16] the thing coming
[18:17] to a real showdown this battle is going
[18:20] to be finished up under the fourth seal
[18:22] amen and it's coming to a real showdown
[18:26] and the feast of trumpets says they
[18:28] wasn't natural horses
[18:29] now i want to back up i don't want to
[18:31] jump there yet let's let's take our
[18:32] bibles and i want to read in
[18:34] the book of revelation for just a little
[18:35] bit
[18:37] now uh let's go to uh 16 revelation
[18:40] chapter 16
[18:42] and i want you to hang tight with me as
[18:45] we take a little look in our bibles
[18:48] at a few things now one thing i want to
[18:51] remind you of as we were talking on
[18:53] sunday
[18:54] that brother branham showed us a pattern
[18:56] in the seals
[18:57] when he said that every church age
[18:58] messenger came when they came a seal was
[19:01] broken they got a revelation from god
[19:03] and they sounded the trumpet and the
[19:05] trumpet declared spiritual war
[19:07] and a spiritual war broke out and after
[19:09] that the elect were sealed away in that
[19:12] age and then a plague fell out
[19:14] right so he's showing seals trumpets
[19:16] plagues and he shows it in every church
[19:18] age
[19:18] and it comes all the way down through
[19:20] and and there was a there was a seal a
[19:22] trumpet and a plague in every one of the
[19:24] church ages but when we get to the
[19:26] seventh church age
[19:27] now when there's a there's a seal broken
[19:29] at the end
[19:30] the seven seals are broken at the end of
[19:33] the laodicean church age
[19:34] and now all the gospel trumpet sounds in
[19:38] the full measure
[19:40] of the word the full opening of the
[19:42] seals the full revelation of jesus
[19:44] christ
[19:45] declaring not just to a little church
[19:48] age battle
[19:49] but now the full word brings back the
[19:51] full battle
[19:53] we got that so we're coming back to the
[19:55] end time battle
[19:56] but we can't because through the church
[19:58] age we're only battling out on a seal a
[20:00] revelation a portion of the word
[20:02] battling out on a portion of the word
[20:04] but now we're here we've come
[20:06] to face off with the full word with a
[20:08] full gospel trump at the full gospel of
[20:11] jesus christ
[20:12] bringing to the full full spiritual
[20:14] battle
[20:16] but we've been a quick equipped to
[20:17] overcome
[20:19] so i want to look i want i want to show
[20:21] a pattern and this pattern is really
[20:23] important
[20:23] we discussed it briefly sunday but if
[20:26] you look at chapter 16
[20:29] chapter 16 is going to go through the
[20:31] vials and out of the vials the plagues
[20:33] are poured out
[20:34] and in chapter 16 you have the first
[20:37] vial of chapter
[20:38] verse two the first vial chapter three
[20:40] the second four through sevens the third
[20:42] all the way down till you get to verse
[20:44] 12 and chapter 16
[20:46] and that's the sixth vial so we'll read
[20:49] that together
[20:50] and the sixth angel poured out his vial
[20:52] upon the great river
[20:53] euphrates and the water thereof was
[20:55] dried up that the way of the kings of
[20:57] the east might be prepared
[21:00] now there is a gap between the sixth
[21:03] vial
[21:04] and the seventh vial and what i'm going
[21:07] to show you
[21:08] is there's a gap between the sixth seal
[21:10] and the seventh seal
[21:11] there's a gap between the sixth trumpet
[21:13] and the seventh trumpet
[21:15] and there's a gap between the sixth vial
[21:17] and the seventh vial
[21:19] and we're living in the gap
[21:23] now we can place ourselves right in the
[21:25] book of revelation because we're living
[21:26] in the gap
[21:27] now remember this is spiritual and
[21:29] natural it happens spiritually
[21:31] and there's it's going to happen
[21:33] naturally
[21:35] verse 13 and i saw three unclean spirits
[21:38] like frogs come out of the mouth of the
[21:40] dragon
[21:41] and out of the mouth of the beast and
[21:43] out of the mouth of the false prophet
[21:45] for thee they are the spirits of devils
[21:47] working miracles which go forth unto the
[21:49] kings of the earth and of the whole
[21:50] world
[21:51] to gather them to the battle of the
[21:53] great day of god almighty
[21:54] behold i come as a thief blessed is he
[21:57] that watcheth
[21:58] and that keepeth his garment lest he
[22:00] walketh naked and they see his shame
[22:02] and he gathered them together into a
[22:04] place called in the hebrew tongue
[22:06] armageddon verse 17 and the seventh
[22:09] angel poured out his violent into the
[22:11] air and there came a great voice out of
[22:13] the temple of heaven
[22:14] from the throne saying it is done the
[22:16] seventh is always finishing up whether
[22:18] it's the seventh seal or the seventh
[22:20] trumpet or the seventh vial
[22:21] that's always the finishing that's why
[22:24] it says here it is done
[22:26] so we're going to see that but we see
[22:27] between the sixth vial and the seventh
[22:30] file
[22:30] we have injected here in this gap and in
[22:33] this gap
[22:34] is a revelation or or a declaration
[22:38] of the three unclean spirits coming out
[22:40] of the frogs
[22:41] and brother branham starts to reveal to
[22:44] us and exposes the trinity doctrine for
[22:46] what it is
[22:47] and he begins to show these three
[22:48] unclean spirits coming out of this and
[22:50] he begins to show us the trinity
[22:52] of the dragon and the beast and the
[22:55] false prophet
[22:56] so in this gap who is it that reveals
[22:59] what this means what this
[23:01] is it's the it's the seventh church age
[23:03] messenger it's the prophet to the
[23:04] gentiles
[23:05] so in the gap he reveals spiritually
[23:08] what this
[23:08] is all right
[23:11] so in the gap you have a seventh church
[23:14] age messenger
[23:16] the prophet of malachi 4 the prophet of
[23:18] revelations 10 7
[23:20] and he's explaining to you what those
[23:22] three unclean spirits are
[23:24] and he's explaining to you the trinity
[23:26] of the of the dragon
[23:28] the beast and the false prophet so see
[23:31] how important the gap is
[23:34] let's go back to revelation
[23:38] uh 9.
[23:44] revelation chapter 9.
[23:50] so i'm doing this backwards for a reason
[23:54] revelation 8 starts the trumpets they go
[23:57] up to the fourth trumpet
[23:58] revelation chapter 9 starts the fifth
[24:00] trumpet so now we're in the trumpets
[24:02] and verse 13 and chapter 9 starts the
[24:06] sixth trumpet
[24:07] so we'll read that together
[24:10] and the sixth angel sounded and i heard
[24:12] a voice from the four horns of the
[24:14] golden art
[24:15] altar which is before god saying to the
[24:17] sixth angel which had the trumpet
[24:19] loose the four angels which are bound in
[24:21] the great river euphrates
[24:23] and the four angels were loose which
[24:25] were prepared for an hour and a day and
[24:26] a month and a year for to slay the third
[24:28] part of men
[24:30] and the number of the army of the
[24:31] horsemen were two hundred thousand
[24:33] thousand and i heard the number of them
[24:35] and thus i saw the horses in the vision
[24:37] and then that sat on them had
[24:38] breastplates of fire and adjacent and
[24:40] brimstone
[24:41] and the heads of the horses were as the
[24:43] heads of lions and out of their mouth
[24:45] issued fire
[24:46] smoke and brimstone now you notice every
[24:48] time you're dealing with a demon spirit
[24:50] there's always three things coming out
[24:52] of his mouth and those three things are
[24:54] always destroying people
[24:55] because they're always promoting a
[24:56] trinity doctrine
[24:58] so there's always always three coming
[25:00] out of the mouth or there's three frogs
[25:02] with something coming out of their mouth
[25:03] it's always this trinity doctrine
[25:05] because he destroys the elect gentile
[25:08] with words deception
[25:12] he destroys the jews physically
[25:15] we got that but he can't destroy he
[25:17] can't he can't root out all the seed of
[25:20] god by removing one family
[25:22] like he can the jews he the way he gets
[25:24] to the gentiles
[25:26] is through spiritual deception he brings
[25:28] spiritual death
[25:29] because he cannot find the seed they're
[25:31] dispersed through the entire gentile all
[25:33] the nations
[25:34] when he wants to take out the the line
[25:36] in israel
[25:37] he can destroy just israel all right
[25:41] physically but spiritually he has to
[25:43] destroy
[25:44] the the gentiles spiritually so you
[25:46] always see this coming out of the mouth
[25:48] three things
[25:49] fire and smoke and brimstone verse 18 by
[25:51] these three was the third part of men
[25:53] killed by the fire and by the smoke and
[25:55] by the brimstone which
[25:56] issued out of their mouths for their
[25:58] power is in their mouth and in their
[25:59] tails for their tails were like in the
[26:01] serpents in the heads
[26:02] and with them they do hurt and the rest
[26:04] of the men which were not killed by
[26:05] these plagues
[26:06] yet repented not of their works in their
[26:08] hands that they should not
[26:10] worship the devils and idols of gold and
[26:12] silver and brass and stone
[26:13] and of wood which neither can see nor
[26:16] hear nor
[26:16] walk neither repented they of their
[26:19] murders nor their sorceries nor of their
[26:20] fornication
[26:21] nor of their thefts so now we have an
[26:24] order
[26:25] we have one two three four five six
[26:27] trumpets
[26:28] but now we're coming to a gap you don't
[26:30] go to the seventh trumpet you come to
[26:32] revelations chapter 10
[26:33] which is the mighty angel coming down
[26:36] and the seventh church age messenger
[26:38] then after that you go to revelation
[26:40] chapter 11 which are my two witnesses
[26:43] that are called
[26:43] the two witnesses come and preach so in
[26:46] the gap
[26:46] you have three prophets that show up you
[26:49] have a prophet to the gentiles
[26:51] and two prophets to the jews show up in
[26:53] the gap between the sixth and seventh
[26:56] then they preach then they call down
[26:59] plagues
[26:59] then they are killed and then after
[27:02] they're killed
[27:03] verse 15 of chapter 11
[27:06] says in the seventh angel sounded and
[27:09] there were great voices in heaven saying
[27:11] the kingdom of this world are become the
[27:12] kingdom of our lord and of his christ
[27:15] and he shall reign forever and ever do
[27:17] you see the gap
[27:19] you go to chapter 6 chapter 6
[27:22] or revelation chapter 9
[27:26] the sixth trumpet then you come before
[27:28] you get to the seventh
[27:30] you come to the prophet to the gentiles
[27:32] you come to the two witnesses to the
[27:33] jews
[27:34] and then you come back to the seventh
[27:36] and what is the seventh
[27:37] seventh is the finishing again now all
[27:39] the kingdoms have become the kingdoms of
[27:41] our god and is christ
[27:43] so the seventh is always bringing out
[27:45] the finishing
[27:46] right but there's a gap let's go back a
[27:50] little further
[27:51] revelation chapter 6.
[27:58] revelation chapter 6 verse 1 starts with
[28:01] the first seal
[28:02] goes all the way down to the sixth seal
[28:04] and it starts at verse 12.
[28:09] and we'll read that and i beheld when he
[28:10] had opened the sixth seal and lo
[28:12] there was a great earthquake and the sun
[28:14] became black a sackcloth of hair and the
[28:15] moon became his blood
[28:17] and the stars of heaven fell onto the
[28:18] earth even as fig tree casteth her
[28:20] untimely figs when she is shaken of a
[28:22] mighty wind
[28:23] and the heaven departed as a scroll when
[28:25] it is rolled together and every mountain
[28:26] and island were moved out of their
[28:28] places
[28:29] and the kings of the earth and the great
[28:30] men and the rich men and the chief
[28:31] captains and the mighty men
[28:33] and every bondman and every free men hid
[28:35] themselves in the dens and the rocks of
[28:37] the mountains and said to the mountains
[28:38] and rocks
[28:39] fall on us and hide us from the face of
[28:41] him that sitteth on the throne
[28:42] from the wrath of the lamb for the great
[28:45] day of his wrath has come and who shall
[28:46] be able to stand it
[28:48] so that finishes the sixth seal so you
[28:51] expect the next verse to go to the
[28:52] seventh
[28:53] but it doesn't there's a gap and in the
[28:55] gap is revelation chapter seven
[28:58] and in revelation chapter seven there's
[29:00] the calling out of the hundred and forty
[29:02] four thousand
[29:04] who calls out the hundred forty four
[29:05] thousand the two prophets is moses and
[29:08] elijah the two witnesses
[29:09] so here we have in the gap prophets show
[29:12] up again
[29:13] always in the gap prophets show up you
[29:15] have prophets in the gap prophet to the
[29:17] gentiles
[29:18] two prophets to the jews and they always
[29:20] come in the gap
[29:21] that's why the sixth seal had to crack
[29:23] open in world war ii
[29:25] and brother branham said the sixth
[29:26] trumpet and the sixth seal
[29:28] sound at the same time and the sixth
[29:30] trumpet is the second woe which is world
[29:32] war
[29:32] ii so at world war ii the sixth trumpet
[29:36] and the sixth seal
[29:37] sound at the same time because it had to
[29:40] or else our prophet was born out of
[29:42] season
[29:44] because he's got to come in the gap
[29:45] between the sixth and seventh seal
[29:49] praise god who makes this stuff up
[29:52] how can you make a life match the
[29:55] scriptures how can you make a man's life
[29:57] actually
[29:57] match the construction of the bible
[30:00] verse by verse chapter by chapter
[30:02] this isn't pretend made up god took his
[30:04] hand and he made everything work out
[30:06] just right so that would all come to
[30:08] pass
[30:10] the first world war one takes place when
[30:12] brother branham's a little boy
[30:14] then he moves and and he sees world war
[30:16] ii and now he says
[30:17] the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal
[30:19] sound at the same time world war ii
[30:22] but then something has to happen because
[30:25] we know
[30:25] much of what happens in the sixth trump
[30:27] and sixth seal is yet to come
[30:31] so now we look at seven chapter seven
[30:33] verse one
[30:34] and after these things i saw four angels
[30:36] standing on the four corners of the
[30:37] earth holding the four winds of the
[30:39] earth
[30:39] that the wind should not blow on the
[30:41] earth nor on the sea nor in any tree
[30:43] and i saw another angel ascend from the
[30:45] east having the seal of the living god
[30:47] and he cried
[30:48] with a loud voice to the four angels to
[30:50] whom it was given to hurt the earth and
[30:52] the sea
[30:53] saying hurt not the earth neither the
[30:55] sea nor the trees
[30:56] till we have sealed the servants of our
[30:58] god and their foreheads
[31:00] so now these four angels which we saw in
[31:03] the six
[31:04] trumpets four angels bound in euphrates
[31:08] now these four angels now that now uh
[31:10] the sixth seal cracks open
[31:12] world war two starts tribulation
[31:14] persecution of the jews begins
[31:16] and now all of a sudden there's a a
[31:17] ceiling angel that comes
[31:19] and says don't hurt the earth stop hold
[31:22] it back
[31:23] until there's a period of time until the
[31:26] 144
[31:27] 000 are sealed so in the gap we have
[31:31] sealing who does the ceiling
[31:35] the prophets preach the word they
[31:36] receive the atonement the true atonement
[31:38] the word
[31:38] and they're sealed into the kingdom of
[31:40] god so now you see what has happened in
[31:43] our history
[31:44] how the the sixth trumpet and the sixth
[31:46] seal have sounded
[31:48] but they're held back until the hundred
[31:51] and forty four thousand are sealed
[31:53] after they're sealed that's why those
[31:55] two prophets can call for plagues
[31:56] anytime they want
[31:58] stop the rain call for fire to come down
[32:00] call for earthquakes
[32:01] everything that you find in the sixth
[32:02] seal they're able to do it
[32:05] why because the ceiling's done and now
[32:08] the the four angels are not holding the
[32:10] winds anymore
[32:11] now they're unleashed all this happened
[32:15] in the prophet's lifetime
[32:18] to me that is astounding
[32:22] and it's right there for anybody who
[32:24] wants to look at it
[32:26] praise god
[32:29] i showed you that because i wanted you
[32:31] to see the spiritual
[32:33] and the natural because brother branham
[32:36] says
[32:36] he tells us that the the sixth seal will
[32:39] open up and that those two prophets will
[32:40] open the sixth seal which is absolutely
[32:42] the truth
[32:44] but he told us the sixth seal sounds at
[32:45] the same time as the sixth trumpet and
[32:47] the sixth trumpet
[32:48] is the second world war ii how can both
[32:51] of these things be true
[32:54] unless it opened up and was told to hold
[32:56] back until they're sealed and then the
[32:58] two prophets call for
[32:59] and open up the sixth seal amen
[33:03] praise the lord it's so good it's
[33:06] exciting
[33:09] now let's keep going
[33:12] feast of trumpets he said they wasn't
[33:13] natural horses they breathed
[33:15] fire he's reading right out of the sixth
[33:17] trumpet they had breastplates of jasper
[33:19] and they had tails and the end of the
[33:21] tail looked like serpents
[33:22] and snakes had on the end of it stinging
[33:24] it was spiritual horses spiritual devils
[33:26] chargers
[33:27] that had been bound on euphrates all
[33:29] these years supernatural devils
[33:31] what was it the old roman empire being
[33:34] revived
[33:35] the persecution of the jews they had
[33:37] been bound for nearly two thousand years
[33:39] at the river euphrates can't cross to
[33:41] the promise
[33:41] a religious sect that was trying to get
[33:43] to the other side euphrates you know
[33:45] come through eden
[33:46] but they were bound there two hundred
[33:48] thousand devils of persecution
[33:51] and notice what happens under the sixth
[33:53] trumpet they were turned loose on the
[33:54] jews
[33:55] the persecution of the jews supernatural
[33:58] devils nearly 2 000 years
[34:00] then loosed by stalin and hitler upon
[34:02] the jews
[34:03] you see well that is you say well that
[34:05] isn't roman
[34:06] it's the same spirit they've done the
[34:09] same things that they did to christians
[34:10] in the old pagan roman days
[34:12] now watch the natural israel and the
[34:14] spiritual church now
[34:16] as we separate it here so brother rim's
[34:18] going to make a separation between the
[34:20] natural persecution of the jews and
[34:21] something that's happening to the church
[34:25] feast of trumpets he said there is a
[34:26] roman empire bound there
[34:28] by what the ecclesiastical powers
[34:32] amen he's speaking of euphrates the
[34:35] ecclesiastical powers now he's
[34:37] explaining something spiritual
[34:39] out of the sixth trumpet
[34:43] which roman pagan rome became papal
[34:46] roman was bound there
[34:47] in its traditions of christian
[34:50] because it took the christian traditions
[34:53] it couldn't act like the old pagan rome
[34:55] anymore
[34:56] now it's got to pretend it's christian
[34:59] and so it's bound by the ecclesiastical
[35:02] boundaries
[35:02] because it has to act like it's
[35:04] christian and so it's bound
[35:07] under its traditions of christians it
[35:09] can't just go do like it did as the
[35:10] roman empire
[35:12] what part of christian and superstition
[35:14] it had a room putting together
[35:16] all these worship of women these other
[35:17] kind of stuff and christmas days and
[35:19] holidays and holy days and things
[35:21] it's been bound with that tradition that
[35:23] it cannot let loose
[35:24] because it's against christian
[35:26] principles so there has to come a time
[35:29] when it can let loose but it can only
[35:32] let loose when the ecclesiastical
[35:34] boundary is removed
[35:35] and the ecclesiastical boundary is when
[35:38] because of their tradition of
[35:39] christianity
[35:40] they can't act the way they want they
[35:42] have to reserve themselves
[35:44] until they can remove the ecclesiastical
[35:46] boundary
[35:47] by so watering down christianity that
[35:50] they can now
[35:51] act in an unchristian way and be
[35:53] christian
[35:55] and that's the day we live in you can
[35:58] live any way you want and be a christian
[36:00] you say i love jesus and jesus loves me
[36:02] and you can you can do drugs and you can
[36:04] run around your wife you can be married
[36:06] and you're going to be divorced and you
[36:07] can still be a christian
[36:09] and now everything is changing the
[36:11] ecclesiastical boundaries are moving
[36:13] away
[36:16] hallelujah still the same
[36:19] ungodly pagan spirit and that spirit
[36:22] caught into the nations of the world
[36:23] according to the prophecies of ezekiel
[36:25] and the rest of them and they were
[36:27] loosed upon the jew who know nothing of
[36:29] the spirit
[36:30] so now brother bran is going to start
[36:31] talking about what happened to the
[36:33] persecution of the jews
[36:34] under the sixth trumpet and he's going
[36:36] to show now
[36:37] what happened in the ecclesiastical
[36:39] realms so brother vanessa starts talking
[36:41] about
[36:42] he says now now this is loosed in the
[36:46] ecclesiastical world
[36:48] and we know in vatican 2 brother brahm
[36:50] talks about it
[36:51] it's the catholics ecumenical move when
[36:53] they decided to drop the boundaries
[36:55] invite all their protestant brothers and
[36:57] sisters to come back
[36:58] and be unified with them in brotherly
[37:00] love they had excommunicated
[37:03] the patriarch of the the of the of the
[37:05] greek church
[37:06] which caused the split between eastern
[37:09] and western catholicism
[37:10] and so now they bring the orthodox
[37:14] patriarch back and and pope paul vi
[37:16] gives him papers exonerating him from
[37:19] excommunication
[37:21] never taking care of the reason why he
[37:22] was excommunicated never addressing that
[37:25] what are they doing the ecclesiastical
[37:27] boundaries are dropping now everything
[37:28] goes
[37:30] even to the catholics here's what
[37:33] the prophet says he says notice the
[37:35] loosing of this ecclesiastical spirit
[37:38] now 20 years later after that war we see
[37:41] the loosing of the ecclesiastical spirit
[37:45] what happened 20 years later the war
[37:47] ended in 1945
[37:50] 1945 there was between 1939 and 1949
[37:55] or 1945 there was a persecution against
[37:58] a jews a holocaust
[37:59] in a world war and all kinds of
[38:01] atrocities and persecution six million
[38:03] jews
[38:04] were killed because they were jews it
[38:06] was a physical natural persecution
[38:09] amen but then after the war now the
[38:12] ecclesiastical spirit opens and brother
[38:14] branham said 20 years
[38:16] after the war the ecclesiastical realm
[38:19] opens
[38:19] and this and this uh vatican ii council
[38:23] ended december 1965.
[38:28] amen world war ii ended september
[38:32] 1945 two years later
[38:35] now we have vatican ii council and now
[38:38] the ecclesiastical spirit has opened up
[38:42] what's it doing bringing a persecution
[38:44] against the true church
[38:46] working out the ecclesiastical
[38:48] boundaries drying up euphrates
[38:52] so they can come across
[38:55] feast of trump as he said now notice we
[38:57] find now that the natural power under
[38:59] the natural to a natural nation
[39:01] israel was loosed there and what did it
[39:03] it went and made war and how it murdered
[39:05] and persecuted
[39:06] now in the ecclesiastical realm of it i
[39:09] hope that god opens your eyes to this
[39:11] now
[39:12] because i realize this is just not
[39:14] speaking to this church
[39:15] here this tape goes worldwide and i
[39:17] don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings
[39:19] but just tell the truth now the
[39:20] ecclesiastical realm has been
[39:22] opened from the natural revival the old
[39:25] pagan rome went forth on those jews
[39:27] which has always been their enemy the
[39:29] lion with the teeth and everything that
[39:30] stomped down and broke out people
[39:32] rome always had been god's enemy and it
[39:34] was turned loose in the same spirit
[39:36] by the dictators of the world because
[39:38] the religious system was still holding
[39:41] now it's been loosed
[39:44] so now when under the sixth trumpet
[39:46] these demons come
[39:47] out but because the ecclesiastical the
[39:50] religious system was still holding
[39:51] they went for a natural persecution of
[39:53] the jews
[39:56] but then that war stopped and 20 years
[39:59] later
[39:59] now the ecclesiastical realms has opened
[40:02] up
[40:03] see the natural and the spiritual those
[40:06] are two hundred thousand thousand demons
[40:09] to do what
[40:11] to stop you from manifesting the word
[40:16] amen but they're not going to stop you
[40:19] friends
[40:20] because they can't go beyond the
[40:21] boundary of the word we're safe
[40:23] in the stronghold of god's word amen
[40:27] praise god
[40:31] the first seal now on this mixed-colored
[40:33] worldly pale sick horse just think of it
[40:36] you know that's a bad thing now watch
[40:38] where he gathers them
[40:39] from the four corners of the earth they
[40:41] are gathering now
[40:43] for the showdown now i want you to catch
[40:46] this
[40:47] they're gathering now for the showdown
[40:49] the showdown will be at armageddon
[40:51] according to the word
[40:52] so the gathering is not a physical
[40:55] people moving to a physical location
[40:58] they're gathering in the ecumenical move
[41:00] spiritually coming together
[41:02] in mind and in heart and indeed and
[41:06] they're coming together for the showdown
[41:08] not coming together as an army to march
[41:10] up against jerusalem
[41:12] but coming together to march against
[41:14] spiritual jerusalem
[41:17] you got that there will be a gathering
[41:19] together to march against jerusalem
[41:21] absolutely
[41:22] but right now we're working in the
[41:23] ecclesiastical realms where these two
[41:25] hundred thousand thousand demons have
[41:27] gone to deceive
[41:28] in the churches and the protestant
[41:30] movements amen in the ecclesiastical
[41:32] realms
[41:33] and they're gathering now for the
[41:34] showdown they're gathering now
[41:36] for uh for armageddon and they're not
[41:39] gathering to a physical location to a
[41:41] physical jerusalem
[41:43] but it's a spiritual gathering to a
[41:45] spiritual jerusalem
[41:48] and who is the spiritual jerusalem the
[41:50] bride of jesus christ
[41:52] hallelujah they're gathering now for the
[41:56] showdown
[41:57] the showdown will be at armageddon
[41:58] according to the word on the pale horse
[42:00] riding it with a death
[42:02] tact with the name tact on him death
[42:04] listen antichrist's first denomination
[42:06] that can't be the spirit
[42:08] with his jezebel a prostitute to the
[42:11] word with her daughters with her
[42:13] protestants
[42:14] gathering themselves together now in
[42:16] eunuch
[42:17] amen so now what is this gathering for
[42:21] the showdown
[42:22] it's a gathering of the protestants and
[42:25] the catholics the jezebel
[42:26] and her daughters gathering together
[42:28] that's the gathering
[42:30] for the showdown that's the gathering
[42:32] for armageddon
[42:35] hallelujah but god's gathering
[42:40] the different kind of gathering now i
[42:42] want you to be patient with me i want to
[42:44] show a couple video clips
[42:45] in both of these clips we've shown
[42:47] before so be patient
[42:51] but i watched this one again and it just
[42:54] floored me all over again
[42:56] and this is when tony palmer goes and
[42:58] speaks to the evangelical charismatics
[43:00] at kenneth copeland's church
[43:02] and i want you to watch and i want you
[43:04] to listen carefully to the deception in
[43:06] the man's voice
[43:07] how he misquotes the scriptures how he
[43:10] misuses
[43:11] the word amen and how he is very
[43:14] charismatic and very likable
[43:16] and trying to do what intellectually
[43:18] seems like a good thing and brother
[43:19] branham said this this unification
[43:22] this ecumenical move he said it makes
[43:24] sense to the intellectual mind
[43:26] actually he said it's the right thing to
[43:28] do intellectually
[43:32] it's the right thing to do
[43:34] intellectually but he said it's wrong
[43:36] according to the word
[43:38] amen and so you can see how if you
[43:41] didn't know this word
[43:42] and you listened to this man you could
[43:44] get sucked right into this nonsense
[43:46] and think it's a good thing
[43:50] easily so we're going to go ahead and
[43:52] play that clip it's 11 minutes
[43:54] so brother franco if you go ahead and
[43:56] start that
[44:06] and i need you to at least understand a
[44:08] little bit of the the history behind
[44:10] this
[44:11] because we are living in an incredibly
[44:13] important generation
[44:16] i believe that god has brought me here
[44:18] to this year's ministers conference in
[44:20] the
[44:20] spirit of elijah
[44:24] let me explain if you look carefully
[44:27] the spirit of elijah was on john the
[44:29] baptist
[44:30] to turn the hearts of the sons
[44:34] to the fathers and to turn the hearts of
[44:38] the fathers
[44:39] to the sons to prepare the way
[44:42] for the lord and we know that prophecy
[44:45] always has a double fulfillment
[44:47] and we know that elijah will come before
[44:49] the second coming as well
[44:51] and i've understood that the spirit of
[44:53] elijah is the spirit
[44:55] of reconciliation to return heart
[44:58] to each other
[45:02] this is very important we know that
[45:05] the first thousand years there was one
[45:07] church it was called the catholic church
[45:08] and the word catholic means universal it
[45:10] doesn't mean roman
[45:12] catholic means if you're born again
[45:14] raise your hand if you're born again
[45:16] you're a catholic
[45:21] take back redeem what belongs to you
[45:25] we are catholics and then there was the
[45:28] split at the end of the first millennium
[45:29] we had the orthodox
[45:30] east and west two churches
[45:33] then 500 years later we have luther in
[45:36] his protest
[45:37] three churches in 1500 years
[45:41] three denominations not three churches
[45:43] and then
[45:44] from luther's protest onwards
[45:48] 33 000 new denominations
[45:57] i've come to understand that diversity
[45:59] is divine
[46:00] it's division that's diabolic
[46:07] it's true what you were saying about the
[46:09] glory i agree with you of course it's
[46:10] true
[46:11] the glory that the father had he gave to
[46:14] jesus
[46:15] the glory was the presence of god what
[46:18] is the charismatic renewal
[46:19] it's when we experience the presence of
[46:22] god and he said and i give them the
[46:24] glory
[46:25] pragmatic reason so that they
[46:28] may be one it's the glory that glues us
[46:32] together
[46:32] not the doctrines it's the glory
[46:36] if you accept that christ is living in
[46:38] me and the presence of god is in me
[46:40] and the presence of god is in you that's
[46:42] all we need
[46:43] because god will sort out all our
[46:45] doctrines when we get upstairs
[46:48] therefore christian unity is the basis
[46:51] of our credibility
[46:52] because jesus said until day one they
[46:54] will not believe
[46:56] the world will not believe as they
[46:57] should until we are one
[47:00] division destroys our credibility it is
[47:03] fear that keeps us separated
[47:05] because fear is false evidence appearing
[47:07] real it's an acronym
[47:09] f-e-a-r false evidence appearing real
[47:12] because most of your fear is based on
[47:15] propaganda
[47:19] now why is it historic because in 1999
[47:24] the roman catholic church and the
[47:26] protestant lutheran church
[47:28] signed an agreement that brought an end
[47:31] to the protest luther believed that we
[47:35] were saved
[47:36] by grace through faith alone
[47:40] amen but that's not it
[47:44] the catholic church believed that we
[47:45] were saved by works
[47:48] and that was the protest in 1999
[47:53] they wrote this together because in the
[47:56] protestant church we had a lot of cheap
[47:58] salvations people were getting born
[48:00] again but no fruit whatsoever
[48:02] and because we didn't even look for
[48:03] fruit it wasn't the issue
[48:05] because it wasn't necessary for
[48:06] salvation and no it's not
[48:08] but it's a good judge if you are saved
[48:12] so what these two churches did they put
[48:14] the two definitions together
[48:16] listen to it i'm reading verbatim from
[48:18] the catholic vatican
[48:19] website justification means
[48:23] that christ himself is our righteousness
[48:27] in which we share through the holy
[48:29] spirit in accord with the will
[48:31] of the father to together we
[48:35] catholics and protestants lutherans
[48:38] believe and confess that by grace
[48:42] alone in faith
[48:45] in christ's saving works and not
[48:48] because of any merit on our part we
[48:51] are accepted by god and receive the holy
[48:55] spirit
[48:55] who renews our hearts while equipping
[48:58] and calling us to good works
[49:09] this brought an end to the protest of
[49:12] luther
[49:15] brothers and sisters luther's protest is
[49:17] over
[49:19] is yours
[49:23] in 1999 this was signed by the lutheran
[49:27] church the federation worldwide
[49:30] later about five years later the
[49:31] worldwide methodists signed the same
[49:33] agreement
[49:34] but as of today we still have had no
[49:36] protestant evangelical
[49:37] that will stand up and sign this
[49:39] agreement to agree
[49:40] with our brothers and sisters that we
[49:42] are saved by grace
[49:44] through faith to good works
[49:47] and i believe that's something that
[49:49] needs to be fixed
[49:52] there's a challenge for you
[49:55] so the protest has been over for 15
[49:59] years and i get a bit cheeky here
[50:01] because i
[50:02] challenge my protestant pastor friends
[50:04] if there is no more protest
[50:06] how can there be a protestant church
[50:13] maybe now we're all catholics again
[50:18] but we are reformed we are catholic in
[50:20] the universal sense
[50:22] we are not protesting the doctrine of
[50:25] salvation by the catholic church anymore
[50:27] we now preach the same gospel we now
[50:29] preach you are saved by grace through
[50:31] faith
[50:32] alone the word alone was the argument
[50:35] for 500 years
[50:36] the word alone is there you can read it
[50:39] yourself
[50:40] the protest is over
[50:43] the protest is over so let me pray
[50:48] and then we'll start the video i believe
[50:51] we will begin to see
[50:52] more and more people called out to go
[50:55] into the world
[50:56] and work among the churches in the
[50:58] spirit of elijah to turn the hearts of
[51:00] the fathers to the children
[51:02] and the hearts of the children to the
[51:04] fathers to make ready a people prepared
[51:06] for the lord
[51:08] ministries of reconciliation we need to
[51:11] throw as much resources
[51:12] and energy into the ministry of
[51:14] reconciliation as we do to the ministry
[51:16] of
[51:16] evangelization or are we building walls
[51:19] without foundations
[51:23] i challenge you to find a bridge builder
[51:25] and back him
[51:27] or her and i'd like to pray this prayer
[51:31] and if you agree you can say amen
[51:37] this was a dying man's prayer and when
[51:40] you know you're about to die
[51:42] you certainly prayed the most important
[51:44] prayers
[51:46] he said i do not pray for these alone
[51:50] but also for those who will believe in
[51:52] me through their word
[51:55] that they all may be one as you father
[51:58] are in me and i in you
[52:02] that they may also be one in us
[52:06] so that the world may believe that you
[52:09] sent me
[52:12] and the glory which you have given me
[52:16] i have given them
[52:20] that they may be one as we are one
[52:25] glory to the father amen
[52:37] i want you to video a message back
[52:41] come up here and let's do it this way

[56:26] i mean when we went into the ministry 47
[56:29] years ago this was impossible
[56:32] people people people would read that
[56:34] scripture and say
[56:36] yeah right until we all come together
[56:38] and unite our faith and we ain't no way
[56:40] that's ever going to happen
[56:44] that's hard to watch you see the
[56:48] deception so easily
[56:50] because we have an open book but if we
[56:53] didn't have an open book you see how
[56:54] nice and logical and intellectual that
[56:57] sounds
[56:57] it sounds like the right thing to do but
[57:00] they took the scripture and they
[57:01] twisted all of the scriptures to mean
[57:04] something different than what was wrote
[57:06] and i could go line by line we don't
[57:08] have time for that because the thing
[57:09] infuriates me
[57:10] when i watch that i yell back at the i
[57:13] yell back at the monitor the whole time
[57:15] and say that's a lie
[57:16] that's not true and that's not what the
[57:18] word says
[57:19] but it's because we have an open book
[57:21] friends and i showed that to show
[57:23] that the ecclesiastical boundaries are
[57:26] removed
[57:28] because now he comes to the evangelicals
[57:30] which are supposed to be bible-believing
[57:32] fundamental believing people
[57:34] and he comes to them and and now kenneth
[57:36] copeland says
[57:37] 47 years ago this wasn't possible
[57:40] absolutely because for 47 years they've
[57:42] been working down the ecclesiastical
[57:45] boundaries
[57:46] so that now there's no difference
[57:47] between the catholic faith and the
[57:49] evangelical faith
[57:51] that's basically what they said
[57:54] you don't have to worry about the
[57:55] doctrine as long as you believe jesus is
[57:57] in you and jesus and me
[57:58] god will sort out the doctrines when we
[58:00] get upstairs then what is the bible
[58:02] written for
[58:05] amen but you see how what brother benham
[58:08] told us
[58:09] at the vatican ii council he said 20
[58:11] years after that war
[58:13] he said now it's loose in the
[58:15] ecclesiastical realm
[58:16] and here we're watching this 50 years
[58:18] after brother brenham said that
[58:20] 50 years later and you look at just how
[58:23] much it's loosed in the ecclesiastical
[58:24] realms
[58:26] it's stunning it's shocking but friends
[58:28] were here
[58:31] we're here what are they gathering for
[58:34] what is the 1999 uh
[58:37] uh uh accord agreement with the
[58:39] lutherans worldwide
[58:40] what is the 2004 agreement worldwide
[58:43] with the methodist
[58:44] what is this unification with the with
[58:46] the evangelicals through ken
[58:47] clopin back to the catholic church what
[58:49] is it gathering for the showdown
[58:52] because the showdown is always over the
[58:54] word of god
[58:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[59:01] don't tell me he'll sort out the
[59:02] doctrines when we get upstairs he
[59:04] already sent a prophet to sort out the
[59:05] doctrines down here
[59:07] hallelujah hallelujah
[59:10] because the doctrines are the teachings
[59:12] the teachings of what the teachings of
[59:14] jesus christ
[59:15] because he is the word of god
[59:20] thank god let's just go just a little
[59:23] bit further
[59:25] now the battle started in heaven it'll
[59:27] be finished on the earth in the form of
[59:28] armageddon
[59:30] now let's watch and see it unfold maybe
[59:32] we can unfold it if the lord help us
[59:34] right now to do this watch it unfold
[59:36] the mystery writer watch what he does
[59:38] now opposes refuse to repent and go back
[59:41] to the original blood word
[59:43] the word became blood and flesh so he
[59:45] refuses to go back to the original word
[59:48] he keeps polluting the word well we just
[59:52] watched
[59:53] he refused to go back to it the true
[59:55] word bride he opposed
[59:58] the true word bride now he takes his
[1:00:01] own bride that's what this gathering
[1:00:05] is he opposes this true bride
[1:00:08] and he takes his own bride and brings
[1:00:11] her to him in a form of religion called
[1:00:13] creeds and dogmas
[1:00:16] and now seeing the holy bride he is
[1:00:18] against her
[1:00:19] now think about this what brother
[1:00:21] branham's saying he said and now
[1:00:24] seeing the holy bride because he's got
[1:00:28] to be against the word
[1:00:29] become fl blood and flesh
[1:00:32] he's against the word become blood and
[1:00:35] flesh
[1:00:36] that's what he's against he's not
[1:00:38] against your book sitting on your shelf
[1:00:40] he's not against your mp3 player he's
[1:00:42] not against the sd card on your phone
[1:00:44] he's against the word made blood and
[1:00:47] flesh
[1:00:48] and now seeing the holy bride he's
[1:00:51] against her
[1:00:53] hallelujah i'm determined that he's
[1:00:55] going to see more of her
[1:00:57] fully determined that he's going to see
[1:00:59] her the manifestation of the word for
[1:01:01] this
[1:01:02] hour that's what the bride is and seeing
[1:01:04] her
[1:01:05] seeing the holy bride he is against her
[1:01:07] but he forms his
[1:01:08] own bride called antichrist by
[1:01:10] antichrist teaching which is contrary to
[1:01:12] christ
[1:01:13] see how shrewd he is
[1:01:17] feast of trump is now you see what the
[1:01:19] beast is is don't you
[1:01:20] it's a power a power an ecclesiastical
[1:01:25] power that's a church power friends and
[1:01:28] that church power is influencing
[1:01:29] politics
[1:01:30] and will be completely unified with
[1:01:32] politics one day
[1:01:33] but it's an ecclesiastical power jesus
[1:01:36] said it'd be so close
[1:01:37] like the real thing it'd deceive the
[1:01:39] very elect if it was possible
[1:01:40] but he promised to have something here
[1:01:42] for us in that day that we wouldn't be
[1:01:44] deceived
[1:01:45] and that's the word and christ to make
[1:01:48] it manifest to us
[1:01:50] they're supernaturals devils unseen to
[1:01:53] the
[1:01:53] eye but you can see what they're doing
[1:01:58] you can't see the devil when when tony
[1:02:01] palmer's sitting here
[1:02:02] you can't see the devil that is
[1:02:04] anointing him you
[1:02:06] can't see that demonic spirit that's on
[1:02:08] him but you can hear what he's saying
[1:02:10] and see what he's doing and know that
[1:02:12] the man is completely under the
[1:02:14] influence of devils
[1:02:16] and then the entire crowd and that would
[1:02:19] say we
[1:02:20] bless you with all of our heart with all
[1:02:22] of our soul
[1:02:23] with all of our might hey that's a
[1:02:26] scripture that's supposed to be
[1:02:27] referring to your devotion to god
[1:02:29] not to the pope
[1:02:33] that is an example of beast worship if
[1:02:35] i've ever seen it displayed in the flesh
[1:02:38] that was beast worship worshiping the
[1:02:41] false prophet
[1:02:43] then all the people moving their hands
[1:02:46] we bless you
[1:02:48] be blessed be blessed
[1:02:51] friends people absolutely deceived
[1:02:54] have no idea that they're worshiping the
[1:02:56] devil
[1:03:00] good people with families love their
[1:03:03] bibles
[1:03:04] love the churches serving and working in
[1:03:06] the churches but because a prophet's
[1:03:08] ministry was rejected
[1:03:09] now they've gone through the white horse
[1:03:11] and the red horse
[1:03:12] and the black horse into total deception
[1:03:15] and dark ages and spiritual famine
[1:03:17] until now they'll suck down anything
[1:03:21] we thank god we should thank god every
[1:03:23] day for a prophet
[1:03:26] so now you supernatural devils unseen to
[1:03:29] the eye
[1:03:30] but you can see what they're doing so we
[1:03:32] want to watch one more clip to see what
[1:03:34] they're doing
[1:03:36] let's play this brother franco
[1:04:06] [Music]
[1:04:25] [Music]
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:40] [Music]
[1:05:00] [Music]
[1:05:06] confidential
[1:05:13] you see how they love the number four
[1:05:17] four religions four hands with idols and
[1:05:19] signs of idolatry
[1:05:21] they love the name number four
[1:05:24] but you see he says in there i don't
[1:05:26] know if you can catch all the words but
[1:05:28] he says
[1:05:28] that there's so many people in the world
[1:05:30] all call themselves believers
[1:05:32] amen and says and there's one thing and
[1:05:35] this
[1:05:36] this crowd of religions one thing that
[1:05:38] is certain
[1:05:39] everyone says they're seeking god their
[1:05:41] own way
[1:05:42] in their own way one thing that we know
[1:05:44] for certain is that we are all children
[1:05:46] of god
[1:05:49] i watched this today and i told franco i
[1:05:51] said go tell noah they're all children
[1:05:52] of god
[1:05:54] go tell moses go tell them they're not
[1:05:56] all children of god friends
[1:05:58] but you can't see the supernatural
[1:06:00] devils that broke out in the
[1:06:01] ecclesiastical world but you can see
[1:06:03] what they're doing
[1:06:06] now it's not just tying together the
[1:06:09] protestants and the catholics
[1:06:10] now we're tying together the buddhists
[1:06:12] and the muslims
[1:06:14] and we're tying it all together to where
[1:06:16] they're going to be a king over
[1:06:18] all religions and it's going to be the
[1:06:19] pope
[1:06:21] you can't see the spirits but you can
[1:06:23] see what they're doing
[1:06:25] and it's utter complete deception
[1:06:29] it doesn't match the scriptures it's a
[1:06:32] complete lie
[1:06:33] an utter fabrication but people by the
[1:06:36] millions
[1:06:36] billions are believing this
[1:06:42] brother bram says notice while the group
[1:06:44] is riding making themselves ready to
[1:06:46] stomp out everything that won't agree
[1:06:48] with them
[1:06:48] there is another group being made ready
[1:06:50] after a while revelations 19.
[1:06:53] the next time the church is heard she
[1:06:54] comes also not upon exactly
[1:06:57] horses i want you to catch that
[1:07:00] i love when the prophet says stuff and
[1:07:03] just
[1:07:04] totally messes up everything you've ever
[1:07:06] understood
[1:07:07] because when you see in revelation 19
[1:07:10] the return of christ
[1:07:11] and he who rides on the white horse is
[1:07:13] faithful and true
[1:07:15] and behind him the armies of heaven
[1:07:16] follow riding on horses white horses
[1:07:19] brother branham said not upon exactly
[1:07:22] horses
[1:07:23] what are they llamas or camels
[1:07:27] what's he talking about he said he's
[1:07:30] talking about a spiritual happening
[1:07:32] not exactly upon white horses they're
[1:07:34] riding upon something
[1:07:36] and then the scriptures a horse is
[1:07:37] always a power hallelujah
[1:07:44] brother branham says in the 70th week of
[1:07:46] daniel here he comes riding on a white
[1:07:48] horse
[1:07:48] those who follow him on white horses
[1:07:50] horse
[1:07:51] powers they're riding on powers not
[1:07:54] exactly
[1:07:56] horses in the fourth seal he says
[1:07:59] may the holy spirit come down now the
[1:08:02] white horse rider
[1:08:04] the white horse rider is the holy spirit
[1:08:07] the one in revelations 19 that's the
[1:08:10] holy spirit
[1:08:12] in conferences in 1963 he says i'm
[1:08:15] riding on it
[1:08:16] not upon my affiliation upon my
[1:08:18] denomination upon my self-righteousness
[1:08:21] but i'm riding upon the word of god
[1:08:26] hallelujah the white horse is a power
[1:08:30] and they're writing on powers writing
[1:08:31] upon the word of god
[1:08:33] and the fourth seal the prophet says
[1:08:36] those
[1:08:37] that mix turn pale and go to death it's
[1:08:39] a perverting
[1:08:40] perversion to mix colors with white you
[1:08:42] pervert the original color
[1:08:44] now we're talking about original word is
[1:08:47] white
[1:08:48] to pervert it is to mix the colors
[1:08:51] he said the original color only color is
[1:08:54] white
[1:08:54] and you mix something with it you
[1:08:56] pervert its real cause
[1:08:58] amen is that right and if he is the
[1:09:00] white horse
[1:09:01] and he is the word so the white horse
[1:09:04] is the word then to mix anything with
[1:09:08] that
[1:09:08] any kind of creed add one word to it
[1:09:11] take one a word away from it
[1:09:12] it's perverted the whole thing so now
[1:09:15] brother branham says
[1:09:16] not writing exactly
[1:09:20] on horses but she's riding upon the word
[1:09:26] and jesus is the white horse and he is
[1:09:28] the word and the white horse rider is
[1:09:30] the holy spirit
[1:09:32] and a horse is a power what power is
[1:09:34] these armies of heaven riding on that
[1:09:36] will give them victory
[1:09:37] the only power is the word
[1:09:41] she comes also not upon exactly horses
[1:09:44] but the bible said he was on a white
[1:09:46] horse and the host of heaven was
[1:09:47] following him
[1:09:48] upon white horses now remember i want
[1:09:50] you to hold this in your mind
[1:09:51] jesus is also riding a white horse
[1:09:56] well this group down here has got 2 000
[1:09:58] bound at the river euphrates and has
[1:10:00] been bound for 2000 years
[1:10:01] also that church has bound the holy
[1:10:03] ghost for nearly two thousand years
[1:10:05] under martyrdom back there and under the
[1:10:07] church ages it's been bound
[1:10:09] not at the river euphrates but at the
[1:10:11] door of creeds and dogmas
[1:10:12] that the holy spirit can't work in the
[1:10:15] church because of man-made systems
[1:10:17] but she is going to be liberated
[1:10:21] she is coming back that's what the bible
[1:10:24] said
[1:10:24] and those two meet one another on the
[1:10:27] battlegrounds lucifer and michael again
[1:10:30] like in the beginning what has that got
[1:10:33] to do with her coming back
[1:10:35] what has that got to do with the
[1:10:36] releasing of the holy ghost has been
[1:10:38] bound for 2000 years
[1:10:39] but brother branham takes those two
[1:10:41] things and puts them right together
[1:10:43] he's been bound by what by man-made
[1:10:46] systems but she is going to be liberated
[1:10:48] she's coming back
[1:10:49] that's what the bible said and those two
[1:10:52] will meet together again on the
[1:10:54] battlegrounds lucifer and michael again
[1:10:56] like in the beginning
[1:10:58] why because the gospel trumpet is blown
[1:11:00] the seventh church age messenger has
[1:11:01] blown the entire revelation of jesus
[1:11:03] christ
[1:11:04] calling to war spiritual war
[1:11:09] hallelujah in this spiritual war you
[1:11:12] won't need a white horse in your
[1:11:13] backyard to keep feeding it
[1:11:15] until the time you just keep feeding
[1:11:17] that word into your soul
[1:11:19] and that's the power you're writing in
[1:11:20] this battle friends
[1:11:24] and the fourth seal he says notice life
[1:11:26] followed the writer on white horse
[1:11:28] who was the word life vindicated by his
[1:11:31] resurrected saints
[1:11:32] that he had with him now how's the
[1:11:34] battle going to go
[1:11:35] oh this is the part i've wanted to get
[1:11:37] to all night
[1:11:40] now when brother branham says he comes
[1:11:42] with resurrected saints be very careful
[1:11:44] you don't put that way off in the future
[1:11:45] somewhere
[1:11:48] amen how's the battle going to go
[1:11:52] jesus said he that believeth in me
[1:11:53] though he were dead yet shall he live
[1:11:59] what we're talking about armageddon
[1:12:03] and he says he coming with resurrected
[1:12:06] saints
[1:12:07] how's the battle going to go well first
[1:12:09] he'll split his armies
[1:12:10] and then they're going to all get a
[1:12:11] sword no he says how's the battle going
[1:12:13] to go
[1:12:14] jesus said he that believeth in me
[1:12:15] though he were dead yet shall he live
[1:12:19] amen he said if you believe in me though
[1:12:22] you were dead yet shall you live
[1:12:23] and whosoever liveth and believeth me
[1:12:25] shall never die again he said he that
[1:12:26] believes in me
[1:12:27] he will give him eternal life raise him
[1:12:29] up with the last days that's his
[1:12:30] promised
[1:12:31] scripture that's how the battle is going
[1:12:36] here comes satan with all four corners
[1:12:38] of the earth with his protestants and
[1:12:40] with his catholics
[1:12:41] see friends you get this it's not it's
[1:12:43] not like all of a sudden we're going to
[1:12:45] come out of church one day
[1:12:46] and all the catholics and protestants
[1:12:48] are gathered down here and they're ready
[1:12:49] to march against us and we've got to get
[1:12:51] a sword a physical sword and get a
[1:12:53] physical horse
[1:12:54] he's gathering them spiritually to
[1:12:57] attack spiritual jerusalem
[1:12:59] amen but we are riding on the power
[1:13:02] of the word and we have a sword of the
[1:13:04] spirit which is the word of god
[1:13:06] and we're being called and gathered for
[1:13:09] this great final standoff
[1:13:12] spiritually
[1:13:15] he comes satan with the four corners of
[1:13:17] the earth with his protestants
[1:13:18] and with his catholics and all together
[1:13:21] marching right up to the battle of
[1:13:22] armageddon all right
[1:13:24] and here comes jesus coming down from
[1:13:26] heaven with resurrected saints
[1:13:28] vindicated word what a resurrected

[1:14:52] mercy for this great love wherewith he
[1:14:54] loved us
[1:14:55] even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:14:56] quickened us together with christ
[1:14:59] hath already quickened us
[1:15:02] this is the apostle paul not william
[1:15:04] branham apostle paul
[1:15:05] he hath quickened us together with
[1:15:07] christ by grace are you saved
[1:15:09] and hath past tense raised us
[1:15:13] up together you are resurrected saints
[1:15:18] and have raised us up together and made
[1:15:21] us to sit together in heavenly places in
[1:15:23] christ jesus
[1:15:24] that means you're not only resurrected
[1:15:26] but you're already raptured
[1:15:30] because you're sitting with him in
[1:15:31] heavenly places friends
[1:15:33] you're just waiting for your physical
[1:15:35] body to change and catch up to where
[1:15:37] your soul
[1:15:38] has already been liberated to
[1:15:42] hallelujah so he's come
[1:15:45] not coming come amen
[1:15:48] riding on a white horse and his name is
[1:15:51] true and faithful and behind him
[1:15:53] are the armies of heaven on white horses
[1:15:58] and they are called amen
[1:16:01] and chosen and faithful
[1:16:05] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:16:07] world and faithful by their own choosing
[1:16:14] hallelujah i like that
[1:16:18] let's keep going now listen just watch
[1:16:21] the way
[1:16:22] the prophet says this don't think like
[1:16:25] we've always thought before
[1:16:26] and pigeonhole this somewhere else
[1:16:31] he's coming i'm going to read the top
[1:16:33] paragraph again and all together
[1:16:34] marching right up to the battle of
[1:16:35] armageddon
[1:16:36] all right and here comes jesus coming
[1:16:38] down from heaven with resurrected saints
[1:16:40] vindicated word as i said if god speaks
[1:16:43] and sends you
[1:16:44] he backs up what you say see and notice
[1:16:46] if you're an ambassador
[1:16:48] from heaven
[1:16:51] all heaven's behind you in heaven is
[1:16:53] consistent of the word
[1:16:55] so here he's talking about he's coming
[1:16:57] with resurrected saints
[1:16:58] and then he says if you're an ambassador
[1:17:01] from heaven
[1:17:02] have we been called ambassadors from
[1:17:04] heaven in the scriptures
[1:17:07] brother branham is tying this to
[1:17:08] resurrected saints
[1:17:11] ambassadors from heaven he's not putting
[1:17:13] it off in the future
[1:17:14] he's bringing it right here friends
[1:17:19] hallelujah if you're an ambassador from
[1:17:22] heaven all heaven's behind you
[1:17:25] now notice he's come with resurrected
[1:17:28] saints vindicated
[1:17:29] that vindicating that his word is true
[1:17:33] why because you received the quickening
[1:17:35] power and the quickening power has
[1:17:36] changed your life
[1:17:37] and brought your life to match this word
[1:17:39] and your life matching this revealed
[1:17:41] word
[1:17:42] is vindicating that he is true
[1:17:45] because if there was nobody on earth
[1:17:46] that could live this revelation
[1:17:48] then it would not prove that he's alive
[1:17:50] that he's been resurrected from the dead
[1:17:52] that he has quickening power
[1:17:53] but if there's a people on this earth
[1:17:55] that can live the full measure of the
[1:17:56] word
[1:17:57] it vindicates that jesus christ is
[1:17:59] resurrected from the dead
[1:18:00] and he has quickening power to quicken
[1:18:02] you to life
[1:18:04] not in the future now today he has
[1:18:06] quickening power to quicken you to life
[1:18:09] where you don't have to live like you
[1:18:10] used to live you don't have to live
[1:18:12] contrary to the word but you can live
[1:18:14] exactly in line every jot and every
[1:18:17] tittle to the word
[1:18:18] so much so that if you get out of step
[1:18:20] that holy ghost will bring you right
[1:18:22] back into repentance
[1:18:23] and you can live according to this word
[1:18:26] not by your power but by the quickening
[1:18:28] power of the resurrected jesus christ
[1:18:30] the one on the white horse
[1:18:32] [Applause]
[1:18:38] hallelujah notice he comes with
[1:18:41] resurrected saints vindicating that his
[1:18:43] word is true
[1:18:44] so satan knows that when the bottom
[1:18:46] satan knows then that the bottomless pit
[1:18:48] is ready
[1:18:48] for him why do you think he's going to
[1:18:51] resist you so hard
[1:18:52] because your vindicated life amen proves
[1:18:56] that the bottomless pit is waiting for
[1:18:57] him
[1:18:59] well that's why he wants you to fail
[1:19:01] every day
[1:19:02] he wants to keep getting victory over
[1:19:04] the word because when you stop letting
[1:19:06] down the bar on the word
[1:19:07] and you've got quickening power that
[1:19:09] proves that jesus christ is resurrected
[1:19:10] and alive
[1:19:11] in your flesh when the word becomes
[1:19:13] blood and flesh
[1:19:14] then he realizes that the bottomless pit
[1:19:16] is waiting for him
[1:19:17] amen friends god calls for a perfect
[1:19:21] holy life
[1:19:22] not a compromising life a perfect holy
[1:19:25] life you cannot read this scripture and
[1:19:27] find
[1:19:27] anywhere else where compromise is
[1:19:30] tolerated
[1:19:32] it is not allowed it is not permitted
[1:19:34] and every time it's found there's a call
[1:19:36] to repentance
[1:19:39] every time because the quickening power
[1:19:42] must quicken you to this manifested word
[1:19:44] to vindicate that he's alive
[1:19:49] every time that we we let down the bar
[1:19:53] and we show that the quickening power
[1:19:54] won't hold us and the quickening power
[1:19:56] won't give us victory in our lives we
[1:19:58] are putting casting doubt on whether or
[1:20:00] not jesus christ is resurrected or not
[1:20:02] because the resurrected zanes are his
[1:20:04] vindication
[1:20:08] this is the battle friends so satan
[1:20:12] knows when the bottomless pit is ready
[1:20:13] for him oh
[1:20:14] while death rode the pale horse mixed
[1:20:16] creed and denominations followed him
[1:20:18] eternal separation from god that's where
[1:20:21] he rode them to
[1:20:22] eternal separation christ rode
[1:20:25] his white horse
[1:20:29] yes his white horse that's called church
[1:20:33] christ rode his church right into glory
[1:20:36] in the resurrection
[1:20:42] that means you are the vindication that
[1:20:45] jesus christ is resurrected from the
[1:20:46] dead
[1:20:47] and his quickening powers quickened you
[1:20:49] to the word to prove that he is alive
[1:20:52] and he is riding that church all the way
[1:20:54] to glory in the resurrection
[1:20:57] that's the power that jesus christ is
[1:20:59] riding on
[1:21:00] is a resurrection in mortal bodies
[1:21:03] resurrected back to the life of the word
[1:21:12] hallelujah
[1:21:14] i like that there's going to be a people
[1:21:18] on this earth that live every jotten
[1:21:20] title
[1:21:22] and every slight infraction will bring
[1:21:24] them to repentance
[1:21:26] staying right in line by what by
[1:21:28] quickening power
[1:21:30] quickening power of the resurrected life
[1:21:32] of jesus christ
[1:21:34] and that is the power that he he
[1:21:37] is riding into glory
[1:21:43] hallelujah
[1:21:50] i just want to read a couple things is
[1:21:51] it all right if i go 10 more minutes
[1:21:53] amen i love you guys you're my favorite
[1:21:57] people
[1:21:59] hallelujah
[1:22:05] when jesus come to the earth no doubt
[1:22:09] as a boy he had manifestations
[1:22:12] we don't see any recorded except when
[1:22:14] he's disputing with the
[1:22:16] with the teachers and theologians in the
[1:22:17] temple and they were astonished at his
[1:22:18] doctrine
[1:22:19] we know that we know there must have
[1:22:21] been something because mary knew that he
[1:22:23] could turn water to wine
[1:22:25] before he had done a public miracle
[1:22:27] that's recorded at the wedding in cana
[1:22:29] mary knew that he could do it
[1:22:32] so no doubt there was some manifestation
[1:22:35] in his life
[1:22:36] that that that mary would have seen his
[1:22:38] life and would have known that he's
[1:22:40] capable she didn't have any doubts
[1:22:42] she wasn't worried she was she was
[1:22:44] excited she said just
[1:22:46] just just go get water pots and do
[1:22:47] whatever he says
[1:22:50] and so now at the marriage at the
[1:22:52] wedding in cana
[1:22:54] his ministry is shifting from a private
[1:22:56] manifestation to a public manifestation
[1:23:00] now it's not going to be what happens at
[1:23:02] home and just the family knows about it
[1:23:04] but now he's going to move into a public
[1:23:06] demonstration
[1:23:07] that's going to vindicate that he is the
[1:23:09] vessel that god is indwelling
[1:23:12] but before between the private at home
[1:23:17] manifestations in the public
[1:23:19] manifestation
[1:23:20] jesus has to go to jordan get baptized
[1:23:24] and after he's baptized he has to go to
[1:23:26] the wilderness to be tested
[1:23:30] he has to come to a showdown with the
[1:23:31] devil and in this showdown
[1:23:34] he would use absolutely zero
[1:23:36] manifestation of his
[1:23:37] supernatural power but the only thing he
[1:23:41] would do when he was facing the devil
[1:23:42] face to face
[1:23:44] in between the private life and the
[1:23:46] public life
[1:23:47] he's got to pass through this trial in
[1:23:49] the wilderness and he's got to come face
[1:23:51] to face with the devil
[1:23:52] here you have lucifer and michael on the
[1:23:55] battleground again
[1:23:58] amen and they're facing one another
[1:24:01] again
[1:24:02] and the battle is over the word
[1:24:06] the battle is not over his power his
[1:24:09] manifestation
[1:24:10] healing works and the ability to speak
[1:24:13] in tongues or interpret tongues or to
[1:24:15] see visions
[1:24:16] that was never the battle that was never
[1:24:18] what the fight was over
[1:24:19] but it was always on whether or not he
[1:24:21] would keep the word
[1:24:23] so he come down and satan is tempting
[1:24:26] him with the word
[1:24:27] just like he did eve and just like he
[1:24:29] did the angels in heaven
[1:24:31] and just like he did every saint down
[1:24:33] through history he's tempting them with
[1:24:34] the word
[1:24:35] but jesus he is the word and you're not
[1:24:38] going to deceive the word by the word
[1:24:41] so satan comes and he brings word but he
[1:24:44] brings
[1:24:44] word tainted
[1:24:47] he's bringing a mixed creed he's
[1:24:50] bringing a mixed word
[1:24:51] he's not bringing pure word although
[1:24:53] he's quoting the bible
[1:24:54] he's not bringing it in purity and even
[1:24:57] though he can quote the bible verbatim
[1:24:59] he's not bringing in the purity of the
[1:25:01] spirit
[1:25:03] talk about deception when the word is
[1:25:06] exactly spot on word for word for what's
[1:25:09] written in the bible
[1:25:10] but it's not coming in the spirit of the
[1:25:12] word
[1:25:14] because it wants a man to exalt himself
[1:25:16] even though the word is true
[1:25:17] it's not true amen in the spirit of the
[1:25:20] word
[1:25:22] [Music]
[1:25:23] that can only be discerned by the holy
[1:25:25] ghost
[1:25:26] so now jesus comes and and now the the
[1:25:29] devil comes and they're facing off again
[1:25:31] and he tempts him with
[1:25:32] the lust of the flesh and the lust of
[1:25:34] the eyes of the pride of life
[1:25:35] the same thing that he fell by and jesus
[1:25:38] deflects it every time with it is
[1:25:40] written
[1:25:41] it is written it is written and he has
[1:25:44] victory
[1:25:45] over the devil hallelujah
[1:25:52] wow brother branham says in sirs we
[1:25:56] would see jesus at the end of 1963.
[1:26:00] he said now let's take and see what he
[1:26:01] was we find as soon as he was baptized
[1:26:04] god come
[1:26:04] upon him in the form of a dove and he
[1:26:06] went into the wilderness for 40 days
[1:26:08] of temptation and there he defeated
[1:26:10] satan
[1:26:11] on the word first he defeated satan on
[1:26:14] the word
[1:26:15] then his earthly ministry began
[1:26:19] you see the pattern friends amen the
[1:26:22] bride has had at-home manifestations
[1:26:24] we've had healings we've had god moving
[1:26:26] miraculous ways for us but the bride has
[1:26:29] to be on display
[1:26:30] she's got to have a public ministry but
[1:26:32] she's got to defeat
[1:26:34] the devil on the word only not with
[1:26:37] powers not with manifestations not with
[1:26:39] healings
[1:26:40] not with dynamic services but she's got
[1:26:42] to stand face to face
[1:26:44] michael and lucifer on the battleground
[1:26:48] again
[1:26:50] and face to face and the only way she'll
[1:26:53] overcome is not beating the air and
[1:26:54] running around and getting a bunch of
[1:26:56] friends
[1:26:56] but she will overcome with it is written
[1:27:00] there's going to come a bride brother
[1:27:02] branham said this
[1:27:03] evil age is to prove to satan that this
[1:27:06] woman is not like
[1:27:07] eve that's what god is trying to do with
[1:27:10] this evil age
[1:27:12] all the wickedness that's out there he's
[1:27:13] trying to put you to the test
[1:27:16] to vindicate himself that he is
[1:27:19] he is risen from the dead and has
[1:27:21] quickening power and is quick in the
[1:27:23] body to life that he can dwell in
[1:27:26] and it's being put to the test in this
[1:27:28] evil age
[1:27:29] because he wants to show satan amen
[1:27:34] just like god wanted to show satan that
[1:27:36] this man is not like noah
[1:27:39] this man is not like moses this man is
[1:27:42] not like any of the other prophets
[1:27:44] but this is a perfect vessel that will
[1:27:46] not be defeated on the word
[1:27:47] and will not let down the bars on the
[1:27:49] word
[1:27:52] and the pride the bride has to come to
[1:27:54] the same battlegrounds
[1:27:57] not a big bunch of hoopla not a big
[1:28:00] something you can see
[1:28:02] but standing there facing the devil and
[1:28:04] saying it
[1:28:05] is written the bible says
[1:28:09] the prophet taught us the word of god
[1:28:11] says
[1:28:12] we're not going to let down on the word
[1:28:18] and when jesus come to that test tested
[1:28:21] by the lust of the eyes
[1:28:22] the lust of the flesh and the pride of
[1:28:24] life and when he overcame by the word
[1:28:27] then his ministry started
[1:28:31] because now god had a trusted vessel
[1:28:34] that he knew he could give all power to
[1:28:37] and he would only do what the word says
[1:28:40] do
[1:28:44] brother brent said every christian in
[1:28:46] here can defeat satan
[1:28:47] any place anywhere anytime
[1:28:51] on the word of the living god i like
[1:28:54] them
[1:28:56] he said jesus said get thee behind me
[1:28:59] satan it is written the works that i do
[1:29:00] shall you do also
[1:29:02] that's what jesus defeats satan he never
[1:29:04] used his power
[1:29:05] he was god manifested in the flesh but
[1:29:07] he didn't use his power
[1:29:08] all the gifts that there was in heaven
[1:29:10] he had them in him
[1:29:11] but he didn't use that he just took the
[1:29:13] father's word he said it is written thou
[1:29:15] shalt worship the lord thy god it is
[1:29:17] written
[1:29:17] it is written it is written it is
[1:29:19] written and he defeated satan
[1:29:21] and the word of god will defeat satan
[1:29:23] anywhere on any grounds
[1:29:25] under any condition god's holy word
[1:29:29] do you believe that
[1:29:37] brother branham said
[1:29:40] in the church age book in revelation of
[1:29:41] jesus christ
[1:29:44] we all know this this is so famous we
[1:29:46] could probably all quote it
[1:29:48] but listen he says satan
[1:29:52] hates that revelation
[1:29:56] satan hates that he fights it right down
[1:29:59] to the time he's cast into the lake of
[1:30:01] fire he fights that he cannot stand it
[1:30:03] he knows that if the people get the true
[1:30:04] revelation of the true church and what
[1:30:06] she
[1:30:06] is what she stands for and that she can
[1:30:08] do the greater works
[1:30:10] she will be an invincible army remember
[1:30:13] we're talking about the battle
[1:30:15] spiritual war if they get a true
[1:30:18] revelation of the two spirits within the
[1:30:20] framework of the christian church
[1:30:24] and by god's spirit discern and
[1:30:25] withstand the antichrist spirit
[1:30:28] satan will be powerless before her
[1:30:31] satan will not be powerless before her
[1:30:34] when she gets mighty manifestations
[1:30:36] or when there's prophecy going over the
[1:30:38] pulpit or when we have tongues and
[1:30:40] interpretations in a back room
[1:30:41] that's not when she will have victory
[1:30:44] she will have victory amen
[1:30:46] he will be powerless when she discerns
[1:30:48] the two spirits
[1:30:50] at war in her and she withstands
[1:30:53] the antichrist spirit then he will be
[1:30:55] powerless
[1:30:56] over the church
[1:31:01] don't wait for something we've got it we
[1:31:03] have the word we don't have to wait for
[1:31:05] anything to come to full victory
[1:31:08] satan will be powerless before he will
[1:31:10] be as definitely thwarted today
[1:31:12] as when christ withstood his every
[1:31:14] effort to gain power over him
[1:31:16] in the desert
[1:31:19] so what's it going to take to have the
[1:31:20] same victory that jesus christ had in
[1:31:23] the desert
[1:31:23] you have to discern the two spirits
[1:31:25] within the framework of the church
[1:31:27] and resist the antichrist spirit and
[1:31:29] then he will be powerless before you
[1:31:31] just as much so as he was powerless
[1:31:33] before jesus christ
[1:31:38] hallelujah
[1:31:42] in the message the greatest battle ever
[1:31:43] fought brother branham said god is
[1:31:46] calling
[1:31:46] every seed of abraham this morning to
[1:31:49] that same kind of life
[1:31:51] great battle is on now worldwide
[1:31:55] how many believe that a great battle is
[1:31:58] on now worldwide
[1:32:01] god wants his children separating
[1:32:03] themselves from what
[1:32:05] oh you're gonna like this
[1:32:09] the great battle is on worldwide and god
[1:32:11] wants his children separating themselves
[1:32:14] from what what does god want you to
[1:32:16] separate yourself from
[1:32:17] well movies and entertainments and
[1:32:20] worldly influences and bad friends and
[1:32:22] that's not what he's going to say what
[1:32:25] does he want them to separate from
[1:32:27] see taste feel smell here
[1:32:30] imagination conscience memories
[1:32:33] reasoning affection
[1:32:34] everything
[1:32:38] so that you don't trust the way you feel
[1:32:40] about something
[1:32:41] so that you don't trust the memory of
[1:32:42] what happened last time i tried to do
[1:32:44] this so you don't trust what you see
[1:32:45] or you can touch but you trust the word
[1:32:47] of god above all
[1:32:49] senses above all memories above your

[1:39:00] them and they've been called by the holy
[1:39:02] ghost and the holy ghost has sent them
[1:39:03] and we're going to recognize that as a

[1:40:51] you just can't wait
[1:40:52] what was that song you're playing let's
[1:40:54] sing that power
[1:40:56] that how many believes there's power in
[1:40:57] the name of jesus
[1:41:00] how many believes i'm gonna challenge
[1:41:01] you with this
[1:41:03] how many believes that by the quickening
[1:41:05] power
[1:41:06] there is power for a perfect life
[1:41:10] not your life a life that he comes in
[1:41:13] and lives through you
[1:41:14] how many believes there's power for that
[1:41:18] then quit trying with your own power
[1:41:22] receive the quickening power and let him
[1:41:25] do it through you
[1:41:28] believe it there's power to break every
[1:41:31] yoke of bondage to break all the powers
[1:41:32] of the enemy
[1:41:33] all habits and all family traits and all
[1:41:36] all spirits of compromise and all doubts
[1:41:39] and all fears and all anxieties
[1:41:41] amen in all complexes it can all be
[1:41:44] broken
[1:41:44] and there's going to be a bride who's
[1:41:46] free in the name of jesus christ
[1:41:48] she's going to be an invincible army in
[1:41:50] the name of jesus christ
[1:41:52] because what we've received is not a dip
[1:41:54] in the spirit in this age we've not
[1:41:55] received a portion of the spirit
[1:41:57] but we've received the full power of the
[1:42:00] full spirit
[1:42:01] of jesus christ that's what the word
[1:42:04] coming back has brought us friends
[1:42:06] and we should expect to have full power
[1:42:09] for a full overcoming life
[1:42:10] that every obstacle we face we will
[1:42:12] conquer in the name of jesus christ by
[1:42:14] the word of god
[1:42:17] we're not going to accept complexes
[1:42:18] that's carried over from family by
[1:42:20] generation we're not going to accept
[1:42:21] that
[1:42:22] family habits and traits we're not going
[1:42:24] to accept that anymore because we're
[1:42:25] coming
[1:42:26] to a perfect body of jesus christ upon
[1:42:29] this earth
[1:42:30] under the headship of christ it's not
[1:42:32] going to be like it was friends it's
[1:42:34] going to be different than it's ever
[1:42:35] been
[1:42:37] but you have to expect it and believe
[1:42:39] for it you can't say oh god help me and
[1:42:41] expect it to continue
[1:42:42] you can't expect it to stay the same
[1:42:44] anymore
[1:42:46] we've got to recognize that what came
[1:42:48] down what was symbolized and that cloud
[1:42:50] coming down was the headship coming to
[1:42:52] the body
[1:42:53] amen and the body is completely
[1:42:55] controlled by the head
[1:42:57] the body's not controlled by the body
[1:42:59] but the body is controlled by the head
[1:43:02] and the headship has come down when the
[1:43:04] word came to the body
[1:43:05] and now the body is in subjection to the
[1:43:08] head
[1:43:10] tell me the headship of jesus christ in
[1:43:12] your life can't bring you to a perfect
[1:43:14] perfect identification with this word
[1:43:16] you try to tell me that that's a lie
[1:43:20] but the headship in your life will bring
[1:43:23] you to match this word
[1:43:25] [Music]
[1:43:27] if you're struggling with that you can
[1:43:29] go free
[1:43:32] if the devil is limiting you in that you
[1:43:34] can go free friends
[1:43:36] but you've got to denounce that thing
[1:43:38] and you've got to rebuke it you've got
[1:43:39] to hate it
[1:43:40] amen if you can't get over yourself you
[1:43:42] call for the church to pray with you
[1:43:44] if you've got a if you've got to have
[1:43:45] hands later you have hands lately but
[1:43:47] don't live with it anymore
[1:43:50] because we're coming to the time of an
[1:43:52] invincible army
[1:43:53] amen it's not time to be limping and
[1:43:56] staggering and barely making it
[1:43:58] that's not the age we're called to
[1:43:59] friends we're called to the full power
[1:44:01] of jesus christ
[1:44:03] don't live with it a day longer
[1:44:07] you go to task with the devil and you
[1:44:09] kick him out and tomorrow you kick him
[1:44:11] out and the next day you kick him out
[1:44:12] and you stay there toe to toe until you
[1:44:14] are completely free
[1:44:16] in the name of jesus christ don't you
[1:44:19] give up after a month don't you give up
[1:44:20] after two months
[1:44:21] you fight until you are free from every
[1:44:24] complex and every habit
[1:44:26] and every fear and all anxiety until
[1:44:28] you're free
[1:44:30] that's what the full word came from
[1:44:33] that's what quickening power
[1:44:34] is for friends i think sometimes we've
[1:44:38] lived with
[1:44:38] with complexes and fears and anxiety so
[1:44:41] long we don't realize that we don't have
[1:44:43] to live with it
[1:44:43] [Music]
[1:44:45] but i don't see it in the word where i
[1:44:47] have to live with it
[1:44:49] [Music]
[1:44:50] i can go free when jesus christ was here
[1:44:54] in a body
[1:44:56] that body was free
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:45:01] and as jesus christ here in a body
[1:45:03] [Music]
[1:45:05] then that body should be free
[1:45:08] and that body can be free and that body
[1:45:12] will be free hallelujah let's sing this
[1:45:16] song
[1:45:16] you can be dismissed as you need to be
