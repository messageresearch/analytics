[0:00] Now by his Spirit he is creating many
[0:02] sons unto himself God the Creator
[0:05] creating himself a part of his creation
[0:09] God is creating himself in you
[0:16] where you literally become a full
[0:18] manifestation and expression of God
[0:20] himself
[0:21] I mean that's that's
[0:24] hard and hard to grasp and understand
[0:26] but how is this possible
[0:29] because he plays within you a seed
[0:32] that seed can only produce the life that
[0:35] is in it the life of the seed that was
[0:37] in you was God what can it produce it
[0:40] can only produce God now that seed has
[0:42] to come to full manifestation has to
[0:44] come to full maturity and so what is it
[0:46] trying to do now that seed that was
[0:48] placed in you is trying to come into
[0:49] full manifestation expression where you
[0:52] yourself will be the full expression of
[0:54] God himself just like God came in Jesus
[0:56] Christ now God is coming in you
[0:58] because God wants to express himself
[1:00] through you
[1:02] but you have to yield to him
[1:05] it isn't what's it isn't you trying to
[1:07] do something for God it's you dying out
[1:09] to yourself so God can live his life
[1:11] through you so all of a sudden now God
[1:13] has a vessel so that so that he he can
[1:16] do what he's wanting to do through you
[1:18] I mean you you look at what I'm part of
[1:21] the fire department a volunteer
[1:24] um
[1:24] we go to the biggest problem we have is
[1:27] is the drug overdoses
[1:30] and when you go into a house and you see
[1:32] these guys which have been which have
[1:34] that Spirit on them
[1:36] that Spirit controls that body
[1:40] I mean he has no she has no control of
[1:42] himself that Spirit literally controls
[1:44] that body
[1:45] and so we give him Narcan try and bring
[1:47] him around and and sometimes we're
[1:49] successful sometimes we're not
[1:52] but it's interesting to look and to look
[1:54] at the household and look at the the way
[1:56] they're living and all the others that
[1:58] that demon is so has so possessed them
[2:00] where really they have no control over
[2:02] any aspect of their life
[2:06] well flip that over to the other side
[2:08] if we will take and allow God to have
[2:10] total possession of us
[2:13] then then then he can do through us the
[2:15] same thing he did through brother
[2:16] Branham or Jesus Christ or Paul or Peter
[2:19] any of the rest of them it's it's us
[2:21] yielding to him it's us allowing him to
[2:23] have total preeminence and control in
[2:25] our lives
[2:27] and that's where we have to come
[2:30] because we're the Bride of this age we
[2:32] this is this is what we're predestinated
[2:34] to we are predestinated to be conformed
[2:36] to the image of his son we will be exact
[2:38] image exact replica of him
