message people still want to show that today it's about how messy one gets at the altar how emotional how spiritual it gets to the altar you got to had that experience brother see how quiet he got because you're so used to hearing that so watch The Experience some of you parents in the message don't know this I was never in Egypt I was in this message from from the beginning my parents grew me up not doing anything wrong I dressed right from the very beginning I spoke right I never spoke slang never swore never drank never never smoked never had any girlfriends never straight I grew up perfect according to messy standards so I reached the point where they wanted me to have an experience with God yes and I had a Frank talk with my father and said tell me what to repent of cuz you want me to have that experience and my father and I had a had a relationship where we could talk this way and it was the first time he looked at me with a realization that there was no way I was going to have that experience being in the message all my life and being brought up not doing anything wrong so I was so specific with him I said so must I must I Repent of that one time I lied to Mom is that going to be it or when I fought with my brother does that make me a sinner I'm a Believer I believe the word how you came from the denominations the some of the deacons the brothers they drank smoke they saw a change they could cry about wrong things they did and how unworthy they were the message save them I can't do that you brought me up but now when I see all the people come to the front and they're just crying and and they're remembering what happened in their life before and so on they having this experience I don't have that and I can't fake it what do I do it's the first time he looked at me and he said Son there's only one thing the word has to be revealed to you personally when that happens you're going to know what to repent of and it happened and you'll never believe well you will now you'll never believe what it was I realized I had to repent of everything in my message life was self-righteousness I had to repent of self-righteousness which my parents never needed to repent of and repent means to change your thinking I realized when I came to the word and saw my place in the logos and it was revealed to me and I and I thought Lord I've been faking all this time I've been an Esau I need to repent of that thinking I know who I am now from that day changed I I don't stop crying glory to God
