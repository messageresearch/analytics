[0:00] this is such a simple statement be it
[0:02] unto me according to your word
[0:04] but it's not simple friends
[0:07] by saying that she's acknowledging that
[0:09] i believe you
[0:11] that i was in the back part of god's
[0:14] mind when he was having isaiah give a
[0:16] prophecy he was thinking of me
[0:19] that being unto me was loaded with
[0:22] meaning friends she was receiving the
[0:24] revelation of her hour and she was
[0:26] receiving the revelation of herself in
[0:29] that hour she was receiving the
[0:31] revelation of her position in god in
[0:34] that hour and when she said being unto
[0:36] me she was saying i believe what you
[0:39] tell me that i believe that i'm the
[0:41] virgin that isaiah spoke of that god
[0:43] thought of before the foundation of the
[0:45] world when there was a lamb slain before
[0:46] the foundation of the world that you
[0:48] were going to bring it through a virgin
[0:49] because you knew there was going to be a
[0:50] fall
[0:52] you see this beat unto me is loaded with
[0:55] meaning
[0:57] had to accept it she had to receive it
[1:00] and then she let
[1:02] she let that word flow through her
[1:05] she could not produce it
[1:08] she could not manufacture it she could
[1:10] not copy it
[1:12] what could she do there was nothing she
[1:14] could do
[1:16] well what have we heard in this hour
[1:18] there's been a messenger
[1:21] there's been a seventh angel messenger
[1:24] that come and give us a revelation of
[1:27] the word to be performed in this hour
[1:29] but that messenger was unlocking the
[1:31] mystery in us and placing us in that
[1:34] mystery placing us as the vessels the
[1:36] word would come through amen and and you
[1:39] can we can look at this and you can see
[1:41] the wave sheath
[1:44] and say there's no way i can do that
[1:48] i can tell you god's not asking you to
[1:50] do that
[1:51] god's not asking you to do anything amen
[1:54] that's what sometimes becomes so
[1:55] discouraging people they they look at
[1:57] brother branham's life and they look at
[1:58] the maturity he came to and the
[2:00] character he had and the manifestation
[2:02] say i could never do that i i would
[2:04] venture to say he never did that
[2:08] that's what he told us he said i'm not
[2:10] the one who does this i'm not the one
[2:12] who did this i was only standing by when
[2:15] he did those things
[2:17] he wasn't looking for somebody who could
[2:19] perform to the task mary never could
[2:21] perform to the task he's looking for
[2:23] somebody who will say i believe that's
[2:26] the truth and i yield myself to that
[2:29] truth and be it unto me according to
[2:31] your words
[2:33] now can we listen to the prophet and can
[2:36] calling out a bride and listen we can
[2:39] look at the prophet calling out a bride
[2:41] as a story
[2:43] we can look at it as a mark in time that
[2:46] he's calling on a bride but we need to
[2:48] take the message personally he's calling
[2:50] me bride
