[0:00] brother branham says in questions and
[0:02] answers on the seals
[0:03] he said all that's in the book holds
[0:05] that mystery
[0:07] the book holds that mystery and the book
[0:09] is only unfolding it now not each one's
[0:11] name but what the mystery of the book is
[0:14] while it's calling those names
[0:17] you understand that now see the book
[0:18] doesn't say now leave fails to be saved
[0:20] in this church age ormond never or
[0:21] whoever know it don't say that it just
[0:23] shows the mystery
[0:26] unfolds the mystery of what the thing is
[0:30] now remember saying it's revealing the
[0:31] mystery while it's calling the names so
[0:34] as it's revealing the mystery it's
[0:35] calling you
[0:37] and revealing the mystery is calling you
[0:39] it's calling your name not not chad and
[0:43] not larry not bob not susie not any of
[0:46] these names it's calling the real you
[0:48] down on the inside it's giving the
[0:50] revelation of the mystery peeling back
[0:53] the mystery of god peeling back the
[0:55] mystery of christ and something in you
[0:57] says i reckon that's it that's me he's
[1:00] calling me i'm coming to him
[1:04] and she said master
[1:06] it's you
[1:08] oh and this day
[1:10] i want to ask you a question
[1:13] who are you looking for
[1:16] who are you looking for
[1:18] who are you looking for and what do you
[1:21] expect to see
[1:24] i'll tell you be looking for the one
[1:26] that can break the mystery and call your
[1:29] name
[1:30] look for the one that can open something
[1:33] up that that draws you and says that's
[1:35] the truth that's me that's my identity
[1:37] that's who i am that's the lord amen
[1:39] it's the lord that's calling me
[1:43] somebody will come to church and hear a
[1:44] preacher somebody will come and hear the
[1:46] lord
[1:48] somebody will hear a man speak a couple
[1:50] thousand words amen and get a little bit
[1:53] hoarse amen and then they'll go home and
[1:54] say those were good words and that that
[1:56] was neat how that come together but
[1:58] somebody else will go beyond the horse
[2:00] voice somebody else will go beyond the
[2:02] vessel standing in the pulpit and
[2:03] they'll say god was talking to me god
[2:05] was asking me questions god was
[2:07] identifying where i was at and god was
[2:09] calling my name
