[0:25] In pilgrim land, there is a friend who
[0:29] walks with me.
[0:32] And he leads me safely through the
[0:35] sinking sand is the Christ of Calary.
[0:42] And this would be my prayer, dear Lord.
[0:46] Take
[0:48] the best I can.
[0:52] For I need your light to guide me day
[0:56] and night. Present Jesus hold my hand.
[1:02] Oh Jesus
[1:05] hold my hand.
[1:07] I need thee every hour.
[1:13] All through
[1:14] this silver land
[1:17] protect me by thy power
[1:22] and here
[1:24] my people
[1:29] look down on me
[1:32] and when I kneel in prayer I know I'll
[1:36] meet you there Jesus for my hand
[1:42] and let me travel in the light divine
[1:47] that I may see that blessed way.
[1:52] Oh, keep me that I may be holy thine and
[1:57] sing redemption songs someday
[2:02] and I will be a soldier brave and true
[2:06] to ever burn. Make us
[2:12] as I onward go daily meet the full
[2:16] blessed Jesus hold my hand.
[2:21] Oh Jesus,
[2:24] hold my hand.
[2:26] For I need
[2:28] thee every hour
[2:32] through
[2:33] this pilgrim land.
[2:36] Oh, protect me by thy power
[2:41] and hear my people.
[2:46] Oh Lord,
[2:48] down on me.
[2:50] And when I kneel in prayer, I know I
[2:54] need you there. Blessed Jesus, for my
[2:58] hand.
[3:00] And when I wander through the valley,
[3:04] him for the set of the sun.
[3:10] Oh, lead me safely to the land of rested
[3:14] by a crown of life.
[3:20] And I have put my faith in thee, dear
[3:23] Lord, may reach that golden strand.
[3:29] And there's no other friend on whom I
[3:32] can't depend. Blessed Jesus, hold my
[3:37] hand.
[3:39] Oh Jesus,
[3:41] hold my hand.
[3:43] For I need
[3:46] every hour.
[3:48] Oh, through
[3:50] this land.
[3:53] Protect me by thy heart.
[3:58] Hear my people.
[4:03] Oh Lord,
[4:04] look down on me.
[4:07] And when I kneel in prayer, I know I'll
[4:11] meet you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my
[4:15] hand.
[4:16] And when I kneel in prayer, I know I'll
[4:20] meet you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my
[4:25] hand.
[4:27] Amen. It's wonderful to have a hand we
[4:28] can hold on to. More more proper, I
[4:32] guess we should say. It's holding on to
[4:33] us this morning. Amen. Good to be
[4:35] together this morning. Appreciate you
[4:37] all. Looking forward to the word this
[4:39] morning. Amen. Let's sing the song. He's
[4:41] everything. He's everything.
[4:45] He's everything to me. He's everything.
[4:50] He's everything to me. He's my father,
[4:54] my mother, my sister, and my brother.
[4:58] He's everything
[5:01] to me. Yes. He's everything.
[5:06] He's everything to me. He's everything.
[5:11] He's everything to me. My father, my
[5:15] mother, my sister, and my brother. He's
[5:19] everything
[5:21] to me.
[5:24] Let's go to the key of G. Deeper,
[5:26] deeper,
[5:28] deeper, deeper in the love of Jesus.
[5:35] Let me go
[5:38] and higher and higher in the school of
[5:42] wisdom.
[5:45] Praise the Lord.
[5:48] Go deeper
[5:50] yet I pray
[5:53] and higher
[5:55] every day
[5:58] and wis
[6:00] your blessed Lord
[6:02] in your blessed holy word.
[6:07] Go deeper, deeper. Blessed Holy Spirit,
[6:13] take me deeper still
[6:17] until my life is fully lost in Jesus and
[6:23] his perfect will.
[6:27] Oh, deeper
[6:29] yet I pray
[6:32] and higher
[6:34] every day.
[6:37] wise
[6:39] blessed Lord

[6:47] Deeper, deeper, though it crossed our
[6:50] trials deeper, let me go.

[7:01] me fruitful grow.

[7:17] blessed Lord
[7:20] in your precious holy word.
[7:26] Amazing grace
[7:28] shall always
[7:31] be my song of praise.
[7:37] For it was grace
[7:42] that bought my liberty.
[7:51] I do not know
[7:56] just why he came to love me so.
[8:05] And he looked beyond
[8:10] my fault in soul my need.
[8:19] And I shall forever
[8:26] my eyes to Calary
[8:33] to you the cross
[8:38] where Jesus
[8:41] died for me.
[8:47] Oh, how marvelous
[8:52] the grace that caught my falling
[8:58] soul.
[9:01] Oh, he looked beyond
[9:06] my fallen
[9:09] soul. My
[9:12] Oh, I shall forever lift my eyes. I
[9:16] shall forever
[9:20] forever live my eyes together.
[9:29] Oh to the cross
[9:34] where Jesus
[9:37] died for me.
[9:43] Oh, how marvelous
[9:48] the grace that brought my holy
[9:54] soul.
[9:57] He looked beyond.
[10:02] Oh my fall is so mighty.
[10:11] Amen. How wonderful that he looked past
[10:14] what we were and he knew what we needed.
[10:16] Amen. And he sent his word. You can be
[10:17] seated. Key of F.

[16:25] And when I fall down, you pick me up.
[16:29] When I am dry, you fill my cup. You are
[16:34] my all
[16:36] in all.
[16:40] Oh Jesus,
[16:45] you're the lamb of God.
[16:50] Worthy
[16:52] is your name.
[16:58] Oh Jesus,
[17:02] you're the lamb of God
[17:06] and worthy
[17:09] is your name.
[17:15] Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our heads
[17:17] this morning.
[17:19] Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thank you.
[17:21] Thankful Lord for all that you've given
[17:24] to us. And God, we're so thankful to be
[17:26] here together to worship you again in
[17:29] spirit and in truth. And God, as we
[17:32] worship in spirit and truth, we're
[17:34] depending on you to supply both the
[17:36] spirit and the truth, Lord. For God,
[17:39] everything comes from you. And
[17:41] everything we give is what we return
[17:43] back to you and what you've given to us.
[17:46] And God, may you find those that will
[17:48] worship you in the spirit that you've
[17:50] given and in the truth that you've
[17:52] provided in this day. And God, may you
[17:55] abide in the praises of your people. And
[17:57] may the sacrifices our lift, the praises
[17:59] that we bring forth and send forth be a
[18:02] sweet savor in your nostrils. And Lord,
[18:05] may you come, Lord, to us and break the
[18:08] bread of life and feed us your waiting
[18:10] sheep. For God, we're dependent upon
[18:12] your hand to feed us. And may you come
[18:15] now, Lord, and provide the food that we
[18:17] have need of for the hour in which we
[18:19] live. strengthen us, sustain us, guide
[18:21] us as the great shepherd and bishop of
[18:24] our souls. Lord Jesus, we ask for all
[18:27] things in your name. Amen. Amen. God
[18:31] bless you. While you're standing, if you
[18:33] want to grab your Bibles and turn to uh
[18:36] Genesis chapter 12, I just want to say I
[18:39] appreciate Brother Bob's testimony and I
[18:41] thank God for sparing our brother Bob.
[18:44] Amen. And the doctor said if this
[18:45] condition had went on for two or three
[18:48] more days, they said he wouldn't be
[18:50] here. But God had a different plan.
[18:52] Amen.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're thankful for that. Also
[18:56] want to remind you that we'll have
[18:57] communion and feet washing, Lord
[18:58] willing, this afternoon. Come back for
[19:01] that. And I just wanted to say that um
[19:04] our sister Joanne has to head back
[19:06] today. She was here visiting her
[19:08] daughter, Sister Rebecca, and brother
[19:10] Jeriah. Uh but her mother back in
[19:13] Edmonton had a fall and broke her hip.
[19:16] And when she was in getting uh treatment
[19:18] for that, they also diagnosed her with
[19:20] latestage dementia. So, Sister Joanne
[19:23] has to cut her trip here short and go
[19:24] back to take care of her mother. And
[19:26] she's got quite a trial to face when she
[19:28] gets back. So, let's just remember her
[19:30] in prayer. How many will be remembering
[19:31] Sister Joanne? God bless you, Sister
[19:33] Joanne, as you go back and our prayers
[19:35] go with you and may the Lord bless you
[19:37] and all that you need to do there. Also
[19:40] want to uh say we have visitors today.
[19:43] Brother Peter, sister Sharon Art have
[19:45] family visiting today. Sister Sharon's
[19:47] daughter Mary and her husband Jim are
[19:48] here. God bless you. Welcome. It's good
[19:50] to have you in the service. Amen. We
[19:52] heard a lot about you. So now we get to
[19:53] see you. God bless you very much. Amen.
[19:56] While we're standing, let's look at
[19:57] Genesis 12 together.
[20:00] Genesis 12. And I'm going to begin
[20:04] reading at verse one. Genesis 12:1.
[20:07] Now the Lord had said unto Abram, "Get
[20:10] thee out of thy country, and from thy
[20:12] kindred, and from thy father's house,
[20:14] unto a land that I will show thee, and I
[20:16] will make of thee a great nation, and I
[20:18] will bless thee, and make thy name
[20:20] great, and thou shalt be a blessing. And
[20:23] I will bless them that bless thee, and
[20:25] curse them that cursseeth thee, and
[20:27] indeed shall all the families of the
[20:29] earth be blessed." Amen. God bless you
[20:32] as you have your seats. Amen.
[20:35] So, if we could pull up the PowerPoint
[20:39] and uh I want to look at the blessings
[20:41] of Abraham, the blessings of Abraham uh
[20:45] this uh this morning. Now, we know that
[20:48] this is when God be to call Abraham. And
[20:52] Abraham was uh just a man living in his
[20:56] town just like anybody else living in in
[20:59] of the Chaldes. And God came to him. He
[21:02] didn't come to God. God came to him.
[21:05] And God came to him and began to tell
[21:06] him these things. And can you imagine
[21:09] being that man? You're just going about
[21:11] business, living life, doing the thing
[21:12] you've always done in the community
[21:14] you've always lived, and all of a
[21:15] sudden, you have an encounter with God,
[21:16] and God speaks this to you.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; It's pretty amazing. Amen. Like I said
[21:21] before, this message made the Bible
[21:23] alive. It made the Bible characters
[21:24] real. It made them men of like passions
[21:27] like you and I, so that we could relate
[21:29] to them in a in a way. Before growing
[21:32] up, I always read the Bible. And these
[21:33] were always Bible characters
[21:35] &gt;&gt; and these were always Bible stories.
[21:38] Amen. But when a prophet of God comes
[21:39] along and begins to give us the
[21:41] background and take us deeper into these
[21:43] things, he begins to show us that these
[21:45] aren't Bible characters. These are
[21:47] people.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; And these aren't Bible stories. This is
[21:49] their life.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; This is what happened to them. Amen. And
[21:53] the same things are happening to you and
[21:55] I. Amen. And so the Lord said unto
[21:58] him,"Abram, get thee out of thy country,
[22:00] and from thy kindred, and from thy
[22:02] father's house, and to a land that I
[22:04] will show thee." Amen. This is shocking
[22:06] news. He's saying, "Pick up and go."
[22:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; But I will make of thee a great nation,
[22:11] and I will bless thee, and make thy name
[22:13] great, and thou shalt be a blessing.
[22:16] If you could take note of one thing
[22:18] here, I want you to take note of this.
[22:21] And thou shalt be a blessing.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:26] No doubt Abraham when God begins to tell
[22:29] him these things. I will make of thee a
[22:31] great nation. I will bless thee and make
[22:32] thee thy name great. And no doubt when
[22:35] Abraham heard this, he probably had
[22:37] imagination like you and I have an
[22:38] imagination. And his imagination
[22:40] probably went all over the place with
[22:42] different possibilities and how this
[22:44] will happen and a great nation and my
[22:46] name great. He probably didn't expect to
[22:48] have all the troubles and all the ups
[22:50] and downs and all the bumps and bruises
[22:52] along the way that he had. He probably
[22:54] didn't realize he would be severely
[22:55] tested. He'd be severely tried. Amen.
[22:57] And all of this would come about. It
[22:59] would happen exactly as he said, but not
[23:02] anything like Abraham imagined. If God
[23:04] come to you and says, "Get up. I want
[23:06] you to move from here. Go to California.
[23:08] I'm going to make a great your great
[23:10] nation out of you and a great name."
[23:11] Amen. You just say, "Hey, praise the
[23:13] Lord. Greatness is coming my way."
[23:16] &gt;&gt; But it may not happen the way we
[23:18] imagine. Amen. But he but then he tells
[23:20] him, "And thou shalt be a blessing, and
[23:24] I will bless them that bless thee, and
[23:26] curse them that cursth thee, and in thee
[23:29] shall all the families of the earth be
[23:31] blessed." So we we know this involves so
[23:34] much. There's so much in this prophecy
[23:37] that God gives to Abraham, this promise
[23:39] that he gives to him. There's so much
[23:41] included in it, but I just want to talk
[23:43] about it. Amen. And I want us to realize
[23:46] when we read this that we are heirs of
[23:49] this promise.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; And we're going to show that in the
[23:52] scripture. We're going to go into that
[23:53] because we are heirs of the promise that
[23:55] was given to Abraham.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; If you be part of Christ,
[23:59] &gt;&gt; if you're part of Christ and you're a
[24:00] heir of this promise. And so when he
[24:03] tells them that I'm going to make of
[24:05] thee a great nation. I will bless thee
[24:07] and make thy name great. Amen. You're
[24:09] included in that.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; And thou shalt be a blessing. You're
[24:12] included in that. and I will bless them
[24:15] that bless thee and curse them that
[24:16] cursseeth thee and in thee shall all the
[24:18] families of the earth be blessed. You're
[24:20] included in that.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just look at this as we go
[24:24] along. This is the scripture we just
[24:26] read. But if we go to Ephesians 1:3
[24:30] said, "Blessed be the God and father of
[24:32] our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed
[24:34] us with all spiritual blessings in
[24:36] heavenly places in Christ, according as
[24:39] he hath chosen us in him before the
[24:42] foundation of the world, that we should
[24:44] be holy and without blame before him in
[24:47] love." Why were we chosen in him before
[24:49] the foundation of the world? So that we
[24:51] could be holy and without blame before
[24:53] him in love.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; Having predestinated us unto the
[24:58] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[25:01] himself according to the good pleasure
[25:03] of his will to the praise of the glory
[25:06] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[25:08] accepted in the beloved. Now we we read
[25:11] these scriptures so many times. We know
[25:13] them so well. Amen. But I want to just
[25:15] relate it to you and remind you when you
[25:17] go back and read this. What listen what
[25:21] does this have to do with you? Mhm.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; This is all what God's going to do. What
[25:27] in here says what you need to do or what
[25:29] you're going to do or what you ought to
[25:31] do or what your requirement is. It
[25:33] doesn't say anything. It's all about
[25:35] what God did and what God decided and
[25:37] what God's going to do. And he did it
[25:39] according to his good pleasure,
[25:40] according to his will.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. That does me a world of good,
[25:46] friends.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if I find myself included
[25:49] in this scripture, that means if I
[25:51] believe by faith, amen, that I was
[25:53] chosen in him before the foundation of
[25:55] the world, that I would be accepted holy
[25:58] and without blame before him in love.
[26:00] That's why God did this, so that he
[26:02] could receive me. Amen. And he he did so
[26:04] having predestinated me to the adoption
[26:08] of children by Jesus Christ to himself
[26:10] according to the good pleasure of his
[26:11] will. He wasn't waiting for me to
[26:14] decide. Yeah.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; He wasn't waiting to find out if I'd be
[26:17] a good boy or a bad boy. He was not
[26:19] waiting on me. He already predetermined
[26:22] it according to his will, according to
[26:24] his good pleasure. And I thank God for
[26:26] that because if this isn't true, we're
[26:28] hopeless.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Hopeless.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; But I thank God. I believe it to be the
[26:34] truth. Amen. But to believe it to be the
[26:37] truth, there needs to be an accepting of
[26:38] it as truth. Amen. And and I want to
[26:42] show you this scripture in 1 Corinthians
[26:43] 15:9. This the apostle Paul says, "For I
[26:46] am the least of the apostles that I'm
[26:49] not meat to be called an apostle." That
[26:51] means I shouldn't even be worthy to be
[26:53] called an apostle because I persecuted
[26:55] the church of God. But by the grace of
[26:58] God, I am what I am.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Paul didn't become something
[27:03] because he was a great man. He was what
[27:06] he was by the grace of God. And the
[27:08] grace of God is unmmerited favor. God's
[27:10] choice, God's favor, God's love from
[27:12] before the foundation of the world.
[27:14] Before Paul could be converted,
[27:18] before he was converted, before he
[27:20] repented, before he did anything, God
[27:22] had already said, "He's a chosen vessel
[27:24] unto me to bring my bear my name unto
[27:26] the Gentiles, and I must show him what
[27:28] great things he must suffer for my
[27:29] name's sake." He didn't ask him his
[27:32] opinion about that.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; He didn't wait to see if Paul would
[27:36] decide or say yes or say no. God already
[27:39] decided, "He is a chosen vessel unto me.
[27:42] He will bear my name among the Gentiles
[27:45] and I'm going to have to show him that
[27:46] through great things he's going to have
[27:47] to suffer for my name's sake.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; He wasn't waiting to find out how Paul
[27:52] would react to this. He had already
[27:54] decided the same thing to Abraham. He
[27:56] didn't wait to see how Abraham would
[27:57] react. God by his fornowledge knows who
[28:00] Abraham is. He knows who Paul is. He
[28:02] predetermined it according to his own
[28:04] will.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was speaking to one of the
[28:08] brethren there in Junction City uh last
[28:11] Sunday. We were having fellowship after
[28:12] the meeting and and he he was sitting
[28:14] there loving the word, loving what he
[28:17] was hearing, rejoicing in the revelation
[28:19] of the end time that God had a
[28:21] predestinated seed line, a a family, a
[28:24] race of people, a children. Amen. That
[28:26] he had predestinated and he was calling
[28:28] them back to himself through the message
[28:30] of the hour, back to the word of God,
[28:33] back to fellowship, back to himself,
[28:35] back to a union with Christ. Amen. And
[28:37] he loved all of that. But he says,
[28:39] "How?" He said, he looked at me and he
[28:41] says, "HOW DO YOU RECONCILE? HOW can you
[28:44] how can you get over the fact that that
[28:47] it's me?"
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Like, I'm not worthy. I'm no good. How
[28:53] can it be me? And there's other people
[28:56] that are seemingly better. They they do
[28:58] better. They they are better. And he was
[29:00] he was struggling with this question.
[29:02] And I remember the question because when
[29:03] we first came to the message, it was a
[29:05] huge question for my wife and I. She
[29:07] would ask me all the time, "But we're
[29:09] nobody special, but why would it be us?
[29:11] And why not them?" And she would name
[29:12] name other people, family members and
[29:14] people we knew. And I would just say, I
[29:16] I would just shrug my shoulders. I don't
[29:18] have an answer to that.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Because you can show me all the reasons
[29:22] that you wouldn't choose me. And I would
[29:24] agree.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; But yet he did.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Yet I believe. Yet I can't help but
[29:34] believe. Yet I'm identified by my faith.
[29:36] in the in the in the present tense work
[29:38] of God. Amen. And I I can't help that.
[29:41] That's something that God has planted
[29:42] deep inside of me and I can't help it.
[29:45] And so we were talking about this with
[29:47] this with this brother and he he was
[29:50] loving the word, believing it, receiving
[29:52] it, but struggling struggling with his
[29:55] own worthiness.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember something that Brother
[30:01] Eugene Bronn said to me. He was sharing
[30:02] a testimony.
[30:04] Sorry, I'm way getting off into
[30:06] different direction. So, just keep
[30:07] pulling, friend. This is when it gets
[30:09] fun.
[30:11] Brother Eugene Braun was sharing with me
[30:12] a story. He said he had a man who wanted
[30:14] to get right with God and he wanted to
[30:16] come to church and he I guess he knew a
[30:17] friend or somehow got acquainted with
[30:19] him and he started talking to this man
[30:21] and this man and his girlfriend or wife
[30:23] at the time, I don't know what what it
[30:24] was. They were, you know, hooked on
[30:26] drugs, smoking and all kinds of living a
[30:28] bad life, but they wanted they wanted to
[30:30] serve God.
[30:32] And so, Brother Eugene said, "All right,
[30:34] well, what a" He He dealt with him. He
[30:36] met with him a couple times and worked
[30:38] through some issues. And he said, 'I
[30:39] want you to come to church and give God
[30:41] a reason to bless you. Just come to
[30:43] church. And the man said, "I can't come
[30:45] to church." And the woman said, "You
[30:46] know this excuse." And he says, "But I'm
[30:48] still smoking and I'm still doing this."
[30:50] And brother Eugene said, "If you have to
[30:52] get up and leave service and go out and
[30:53] smoke, go smoke and come back." Amen.
[30:55] But give God a reason and let God deal
[30:57] with you.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; It was great. Amen.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; But he says, the man says, "I can't do
[31:03] that." He goes, "I can't I can't do
[31:05] that." He goes, "I can't come. I'm this
[31:06] and that and that." And this is what
[31:08] brother Eugene Bronn said. It amazed me
[31:10] the way he said it. He said, "See how
[31:12] self-righteous people are even before
[31:14] they're Christians."
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; We would look at that as humility or
[31:20] sincerity, but it's actually
[31:21] self-righteousness.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; He had to clean up himself before he
[31:25] came to church. I got to quit smoking. I
[31:28] got to stop drugs. I got to do all of
[31:30] this before I can serve God and before
[31:32] God will accept me. Says who?
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just let's just receive what
[31:38] he's given to us, what he's done for us,
[31:39] and let him do the cleaning up. Amen.
[31:42] Let it be his righteous and not our
[31:43] righteousness. Those are self-righteous
[31:45] statements to say, "I'm not worthy. I'm
[31:47] not good enough." Those are
[31:48] self-righteous statements.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Because you have to believe I have to be
[31:53] good enough to be this. So then if I am
[31:56] bride, then you bring that
[31:57] self-righteous attitude right into your
[31:59] bride. And all of a sudden, pride comes
[32:01] with election. And pride should not come
[32:03] with election because you should be over
[32:06] here realizing I'm not good. I'm not
[32:09] worthy. I I can't do it in myself. But
[32:14] &gt;&gt; by the grace of God, I am what I am. Not
[32:16] by my worthiness, my deeds, my conduct,
[32:19] my valor. Amen. God didn't choose me for
[32:21] any of that. He didn't choose Abraham
[32:23] because he was the best choice in the
[32:25] town. He chose Abraham because he was
[32:27] predestinated to that position.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Man, we might have looked around town
[32:33] and picked somebody else.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; This one's a civic servant. He's really
[32:38] able to sacrifice him, but look at the
[32:39] work that he's doing. I'd pick this guy.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; If I was going to start a new nation and
[32:44] I was going to have him bear my name and
[32:45] and show him the glory, I would pick
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm glad we don't pick.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; So when brother Eugene said that, all of
[32:56] a sudden my eyes open.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; Self-righteousness is hidden in so many
[33:01] ways.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Even in a false humility where we try to
[33:05] say, "I'm nothing. I'm no good." Listen,
[33:08] that's where we all are.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; But even in my no goodness, he chose me.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; And I have enough faith to say by the
[33:16] grace of God, I am what I am. I'm a
[33:19] child of God by his grace. Not my deeds,
[33:21] not my doing, but by his grace.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:26] So, this is where Paul had to come to.
[33:29] I'm least of the apostles. Not even
[33:31] worthy to be called an apostle because
[33:33] of my persecution of the church. Paul
[33:35] had regrets.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Paul had some things he was embarrassed
[33:39] about and ashamed of. And brother Bam
[33:41] said the stoning of Stephen always
[33:43] bothered him.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; It troubled him the things that he did.
[33:47] But he realized, hey, LISTEN, THAT ALL
[33:50] THAT TROUBLE CAUSED Paul to realize one
[33:52] thing. I am not an apostle because of my
[33:55] worthiness. And I'm not an apostle
[33:57] because of my good deeds. But by the
[33:58] grace of God, I am what I am.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; And I I'll tell you this. I am not seed
[34:03] of Abraham because I was the best choice
[34:05] in my town when God came my way.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I may have been the worst
[34:10] choice in the town, but he chose before
[34:13] I was born.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; That the purpose of election might stand
[34:18] not of works, but of election of
[34:20] predestination. That before the children
[34:22] were born, before Jacob or Esau were
[34:24] born, and either could do good or evil,
[34:27] he said, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau
[34:29] have I hated."
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; What could Jacob do?
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[34:37] So this is where we find ourselves.
[34:39] Amen. By the grace of God, I am what I
[34:42] am. Amen.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; And back to back to Genesis 22. This is
[34:49] after the offering of Isaac.
[34:53] He says he's going to reconfirm the
[34:56] original promise. And the angel of the
[34:58] Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven
[35:00] the second time, and said, "By myself
[35:02] have I sworn, sayeth the Lord, for
[35:04] because thou hast done this thing, and
[35:06] has not withheld thy son, thine only
[35:08] son, that in blessing I will bless thee,
[35:10] and in multiplying I will multiply, thy
[35:12] seed as the stars of the heaven, and as
[35:15] the sand which is upon the seashore, and
[35:17] thy seed shall possess the gate of his
[35:20] enemies. And in thy seed shall all the
[35:23] nations of the earth be blessed, because
[35:25] thou hast obeyed my voice." He
[35:27] reestablishes the promise to Abraham and
[35:30] to his seed that they will conquer, they
[35:32] will overcome, they'll possess the gate
[35:34] of their enemies and the seed shall all
[35:36] the nations of the earth be blessed.
[35:40] Amen.
[35:41] Brother Beam says in modern events here,
[35:43] he says, "Now we are supposed to be the
[35:46] royal seed of Abraham. Isaac was the
[35:48] natural seed, but the faith seed, the
[35:50] faith and the promised word, the
[35:53] promised word, don't miss it, was that
[35:54] royal seed. That was the seed, Abraham's
[35:57] faith. We being dead then in Christ were
[35:59] Abraham's seed, heirs with him according
[36:02] to the promise. Amen. Let's look at this
[36:04] in the book of Galatians here. Even as
[36:07] Abraham believed God, and it was
[36:10] accounted to him for righteousness. Know
[36:12] ye therefore that they which are of
[36:15] faith, the same are the children of
[36:17] Abraham. And the scripture foreseeing
[36:19] that God would justify the heathen
[36:21] through faith, preached before the
[36:23] gospel unto Abraham, saying, "In thee
[36:25] shall all nations be blessed. So then
[36:27] they which be of faith are blessed with
[36:30] faithful Abraham." So who are the
[36:33] children of Abraham?
[36:36] He says here,
[36:40] "They which are of faith."
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Who are the children of Abraham? They
[36:46] which believe. Amen.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; They which are of faith, the same are
[36:50] the children of Abraham. And if children
[36:52] of Abraham, then part of the original
[36:54] promise.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Are you part of the promise?
[36:58] &gt;&gt; By what merit?
[37:00] &gt;&gt; By God's merit?
[37:01] &gt;&gt; By what strength? By God's strength? By
[37:03] whose choice? By God's choice.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:09] And in this message, brother says, "And
[37:11] we are the children of Abraham."
[37:13] Hallelujah. Not as Isaac was, but his
[37:15] royal seed through Jesus Christ by the
[37:18] faith that he had, Abraham's seed,
[37:20] coming forth in the last days to shine
[37:22] like the stars, Abraham's children.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; And then further down in Galatians 3, he
[37:27] says, "Christ hath redeemed us from the
[37:29] curse of the law, being made a curse for
[37:31] us, for it is written, cursed is
[37:33] everyone that hangeth on a tree, that
[37:35] the blessing of Abraham might come on
[37:37] the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that
[37:40] we might receive the promise of the
[37:41] spirit through faith." So where does the
[37:43] promise? Where does the blessing of
[37:45] Abraham come? It comes through Jesus
[37:47] Christ onto the Gentiles. Amen. The
[37:49] Gentiles who believe. Are you a Gentile
[37:51] who believes?
[37:53] &gt;&gt; When where did the blessing of Abraham
[37:54] go? Where is the blessing of Abraham
[37:56] resting? The blessing of Abraham is
[37:58] resting right here. Because by the grace
[38:00] of God, I am what I am.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; I don't believe BECAUSE I'M SMART. I
[38:05] don't believe because I I have a better
[38:07] understanding because I study the Bible
[38:08] better. My mind is sharper. I believe
[38:11] because by by by faith by grace I'm
[38:13] saved through faith and that not of
[38:15] myself. It is a gift of God. God has
[38:17] given the gift to believe. He's given a
[38:19] seed gene of himself TO BELIEVE WITH.
[38:21] THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO BELIEVE.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; AND BY FAITH I'M CHILD OF ABRAHAM. I'M
[38:27] PART OF THE SEED AND THE BLESSING HAS
[38:30] COME UPON ME. I'm included in THIS
[38:32] BECAUSE OF WHAT HE did for me.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen and amen. I'm so thankful.
[38:40] Amen. That we leave we we listen to read
[38:44] read the Bible and we look at Abraham's
[38:46] life. Listen, don't throw that to the
[38:48] past and don't leave that to the Jews.
[38:50] Amen. Through Jesus Christ, it all
[38:51] transferred spiritually right over to
[38:53] the Gentiles. And we are part of that
[38:56] seed. We are part of that promise and
[38:58] it's for us.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why, you know, we don't
[39:03] take this modern idea of we only listen
[39:05] to the New Testament. Come on. It's all
[39:07] the word of God. Amen. in the Old
[39:09] Testament was shadowing the New
[39:10] Testament. Amen. And and what Israel was
[39:13] naturally, amen, this gentile church is
[39:15] spiritually. Amen.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. In this message, Brother Rim says,
[39:24] "Now, but in this day, actually, I want
[39:26] to back up. Turn with me to Galatians 3.
[39:30] I got I had something that wasn't
[39:31] included in my notes, but turn with me
[39:34] to Galatians 3. I want to read down just
[39:36] a little bit further.
[39:46] Let's go to Galatians 3
[39:50] verse 16.
[39:55] Now to Abraham and his seed were the
[39:57] promises made. He saith not and to seeds
[40:00] as of many, but as of one and to thy
[40:03] seed which is Christ. So this seed of
[40:07] Abraham is Christ,
[40:10] &gt;&gt; the anointed word,
[40:12] &gt;&gt; the anointed one,
[40:13] &gt;&gt; this is Christ. So that means if I'm
[40:16] part of Christ, I'm part of this
[40:17] promise. Let's go to verse 29.
[40:21] And if ye be Christ, then are you
[40:25] Abraham's seed and hes according to the
[40:29] promise.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Are you included?
[40:32] &gt;&gt; I'm included. By what merit? by none. I
[40:36] just want to say by the grace of God, I
[40:38] am what I am.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; You know, Abraham never woke up one day
[40:45] and said, "You know what? I'd like to be
[40:48] heir to a promise
[40:50] &gt;&gt; and I'd like to be a mighty nation
[40:52] &gt;&gt; and I'd like that and I like that. I'd
[40:53] like to." Amen. It wasn't his choosing.
[40:57] It was God's choosing.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Did Abraham have to make choices? Yes.
[41:01] Did he have to surrender to the will of
[41:02] God? Absolutely. God never forced him.
[41:04] He had to surrender. But it was God's
[41:06] choice. Abraham could be nothing if God
[41:08] hadn't predetermined it.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Paul the Apostle never woke up in the
[41:13] morning and said, "You know what? I'm
[41:14] going to be an apostle to the Gentiles."
[41:16] No. He was working his way up to be a
[41:18] great one in Israel.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; He was climbing the corporate ladder,
[41:22] you say, of religion. He was working his
[41:24] way into a position and a place. Amen.
[41:26] He esteemed something else. Amen. But he
[41:29] had to count all of that as dung so that
[41:31] he could win Christ. Yeah.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; So he never woke up and said, "You know
[41:36] what? I think I think God needs me
[41:40] &gt;&gt; to carry his truth." And he may have
[41:41] thought God needed him. I mean, that's
[41:43] why he was so zealous for calling them
[41:44] prison. But God had a whole different
[41:47] plan than what Paul had imagined,
[41:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Listen, Jesus looked at his disciples
[41:52] and says, "You have not chosen me, but
[41:54] I've chosen you
[41:55] &gt;&gt; and ordained you that you should go
[41:57] forth and that your fruit should
[41:58] remain."
[42:00] It was God's choice. It wasn't their
[42:02] choice. Amen. You could say it this way.
[42:06] They they were subject to the will of
[42:08] God which he had predetermined before
[42:10] asking their opinion.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; But without asking their permission.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're in the same boat, friends.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; And it's not that we're not grateful to
[42:23] be in the position we're in. We're
[42:24] extremely grateful.
[42:27] But I didn't ask for it.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; I didn't push for it.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; I didn't uh I didn't try to persuade God
[42:36] to make me his child.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Persuasion wouldn't have worked. I I
[42:41] never woke up one morning and said, "You
[42:42] know what? I want to be part of the end
[42:44] time bride."
[42:46] &gt;&gt; I had no idea there was an end time
[42:48] bride. I didn't know what God was doing
[42:49] in my generation. I didn't know what
[42:51] portion of the scripture was being
[42:52] fulfilled in my day. I had no clue what
[42:55] was going on. But God determined that
[42:57] before the foundation of the world and
[42:58] he made sure at the appointed time that
[43:01] the word of the hour and I came in
[43:03] contact to one another and there was a
[43:05] magnetism that was already embedded in
[43:07] my soul and it clicked.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; And that wasn't my choice. That wasn't
[43:12] my design. That wasn't my desire. That
[43:14] was God's. I'm extremely grateful for
[43:16] it. I thank God every day. Amen. That he
[43:19] chose me and that he died for me and
[43:20] that he made a way for me and that he
[43:22] sent the message my way. I THANK GOD
[43:24] every day because I don't know where I'd
[43:26] be without this message. Probably
[43:28] shipwrecked and derailed and messed up
[43:30] on the side of the ROAD SOMEWHERE. BUT
[43:32] GOD IN HIS great mercy and grace and
[43:34] love, amen, come down and found me where
[43:36] I was and grabbed me and pulled ME TO
[43:39] HIS SIDE BY HIS GRACE.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; And I can play humble all I want. I
[43:44] don't know how can I say I I don't want
[43:46] to say that I'm bride. That seems too
[43:48] PRIDE TO ME. THAT'S SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[43:50] I'm just surrendering to what he's
[43:52] already done. and saying by THE GRACE OF
[43:54] GOD I AM WHAT I AM AND I'M NOT PUTTING
[43:57] ON ANY SHOW FOR ANYBODY and playing
[43:59] humble and playing nice and saying it's
[44:01] pride to say I'm BRIAN I'M BR LISTEN I'M
[44:03] NOT WORTHY OF ONE THING I'M NOT WORTHY
[44:05] OF THE TITLE AMEN I'M A DISASTER AND I
[44:08] STILL FAIL ALL THE TIME BUT BY THE GRACE
[44:10] OF GOD I AM WHAT I AM AND I BELIEVE IT
[44:13] NOT HERE BECAUSE HERE I GET QUESTIONED
[44:15] ALL THE TIME BUT DOWN IN HERE THERE'S
[44:17] SOMETHING THAT GOD HAS SPOKEN TO ME BY
[44:20] THIS END TIME WORD HAS BROUGHT ME TO
[44:22] LIFE AND I'VE CONNECTED ACTED WITH THE
[44:23] REAL GENUINE ME.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND IT DOES NO GOOD TO KEEP
[44:29] PUSHING AWAY WHAT GOD'S DONE. WHAT IF
[44:31] PAUL WOULD HAVE NEVER ACCEPTED, AMEN,
[44:33] THE WORDS OF ANANAS AND WHAT THE SPIRIT
[44:35] SPOKE THROUGH THE pill through the
[44:37] pillar of fire saying, "But you don't
[44:38] know how bad I am. How can I SAY THAT
[44:40] I'M APOSTLE? HOW CAN I SAY THAT THAT GOD
[44:43] WILL JUDGE THE WORLD BY MY GOSPEL?"
[44:47] &gt;&gt; IS THAT PRIDE?
[44:48] &gt;&gt; NO.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Or is it the truth?
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. HALLELUJAH.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; IS THAT PAUL ELEVATING HIMSELF OR IS
[44:56] THAT PAUL JUST ACCEPTING WHAT GOD said
[44:57] about him?
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; I think it's pride to subject God to our
[45:06] ideas about oursel
[45:07] &gt;&gt; and not to accept what he said.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. There has to come a time where we
[45:14] have to say, you know what, I don't
[45:16] know. I throw in the towel.
[45:19] By the grace of God, I am what I am.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; God, I would have picked somebody else.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't if if I was in your spot, I
[45:30] would have not have picked me.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have wasted my time and
[45:34] effort and I wouldn't have picked
[45:36] somebody that would have failed you so
[45:37] many times. But God,
[45:39] you had the right to pick and you picked
[45:41] and I say, "Be it unto me."
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; According to your word.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now
[45:49] now we see that through Christ and by
[45:52] faith the blessing of Abraham rest upon
[45:56] us.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; And this in this quote brother says now
[46:02] but in this day there is to come a super
[46:04] royal seed of Abraham. That's exactly
[46:07] what it be would be a royal bride to the
[46:09] royal promised son. As I spoke last
[46:12] night it won't be a natural seed. It'll
[46:14] be a spiritual seed. Amen.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; There is to be a spiritual bride raised
[46:18] up which will be the royal seed of the
[46:21] royal faith of Abraham's royal son. Woo.
[46:25] That's pretty royal.
[46:28] Amen.
[46:29] She is to come on the scene in the last
[46:31] days. And the time and the place is a
[46:34] promise that's given to her. According
[46:35] to Malachi 4, a scripture, there is to
[46:37] rise a message that will shake the
[46:39] hearts of the people right back to the
[46:41] aposto apostolic fathers again. There is
[46:44] to rise one on the scene in the power of
[46:46] Elijah that'll rise on the scene. A
[46:48] wilderness man that'll come out. We'll
[46:50] have a message that'll run right
[46:51] straight back to the word again. That's
[46:53] the hour that we're living in.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The hour for what? The royal seed,
[46:59] the royal bride to manifest.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; And brother says, "And we are the royal
[47:05] seed of Abraham, the bride."
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[47:11] &gt;&gt; By what? By the grace of God,
[47:14] &gt;&gt; I am what I am. Amen. Let's go to Romans
[47:17] chapter 4 together.
[47:20] Romans chapter 4. I'm still kind of just
[47:24] laying a foundation for a thought that I
[47:25] want to share with you.
[47:27] We know these things, but I just love
[47:30] looking at them. again.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Romans 4:3
[47:38] says, "For what saith the scriptures,
[47:40] Abraham believed God, and it was counted
[47:43] unto him for righteousness?"
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love that scripture.
[47:50] What was counted unto him for
[47:51] righteousness? His faith.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; He believed what God told him and it was
[47:57] accounted unto him for righteousness.
[47:59] not his deeds, his faith.
[48:05] Now to him that workketh is the reward
[48:08] not reckoned of grace, but of debt. That
[48:10] means if Abraham had done something to
[48:13] earn his position, then God owed him.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; And therefore, it would not be grace. It
[48:18] would be debt.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:20] That's why that man that brother Eugene
[48:22] was talking about, if he quit smoking
[48:24] and he stopped drugs and he cleaned up
[48:26] his life and he started attending church
[48:28] and then God saved him, God owed him for
[48:30] all the work that he did to clean
[48:31] himself up and come to church and God
[48:33] owed him salvation.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; This is the way our mentality works.
[48:38] This is our old mind.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; But if he in his wreck and his disaster
[48:43] and his failure submits himself to God
[48:45] and God recognizes his faith, Amen. in
[48:48] and comes and cleans him up, sanctifies
[48:50] him, fills him with the Holy Ghost. That
[48:51] man has nothing to boast of. Only grace.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Only grace. Amen. Thank God for his
[48:58] grace.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's keep reading verse 5. But to
[49:03] him that workketh not, but believeth on
[49:05] him that justifith the ungodly, his
[49:07] faith is counted for righteousness. Even
[49:10] as David also described the blessedness
[49:12] of the man into whom God imputth
[49:14] righteousness without works, saying,
[49:15] "Blessed are they whose iniquities are
[49:17] forgiven, whose sins are covered.
[49:20] Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
[49:22] not impute sin." Amen. So I I put the
[49:25] scripture up here, the same one we just
[49:27] read, and I highlighted four words here.
[49:30] Abraham believed God, and it was counted
[49:32] unto him for righteousness. Amen. His
[49:34] faith is counted for righteousness. God
[49:37] imputeth righteousness uh without works
[49:40] and the Lord will not impute sin. All
[49:43] All of these words come from the same
[49:46] Greek word. It's one Greek word and
[49:48] they're all translated. Uh there's three
[49:50] different ways here that they're
[49:51] translated, but this is that Greek word.
[49:54] And these are the usages in the Bible.
[49:56] It's used think nine times, impute
[49:58] eight, reckon six. It's 41 times in the
[50:00] New Testament, but it means to reckon,
[50:02] to count, to compute, to calculate, to
[50:04] count over. To take into account, to
[50:07] make an account of, metaphorically to
[50:10] pass to one's account.
[50:12] So it means to put on somebody's
[50:15] account.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; So that means if somebody went to the
[50:21] bank and put a million dollars on my
[50:23] account,
[50:25] &gt;&gt; they reckoned unto me a million dollars.
[50:28] They imputed unto me a million dollars.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; They counted unto me a million dollars.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; The words used in the Bible counted,
[50:38] reckoned, reckonth, impute, imputeth,
[50:41] it's all the same word.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; So this is the meaning of it. So if one
[50:45] of you so generously goes down to the
[50:47] bank and and says, I want to impute unto
[50:50] my brother a million dollars, right?
[50:54] &gt;&gt; What did I do?
[50:56] Yeah.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; To earn that.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; It was imputed unto me.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; It was reckoned unto me. It was
[51:03] accounted unto me. It was counted
[51:05] therefore unto me.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; It was given to me as a loved gift.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; So now let's go back and look at it
[51:12] again. What says the scriptures? Abraham
[51:15] believed God and it was accounted unto
[51:17] him for righteousness. It wasn't that
[51:20] Abraham was righteous. No, brother.
[51:23] Abraham's righteousness was not
[51:25] accounted to him for righteousness. That
[51:27] makes no sense.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; He was already righteous.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; But when he was still a heathen idoltor,
[51:35] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[51:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Is that what brother said he was called
[51:38] from?
[51:39] &gt;&gt; God called him. And when Abraham
[51:42] believed God, it was put on his record
[51:45] and account, you're righteous.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Not because of his deeds. You
[51:50] understand? If he did righteous deeds
[51:52] and was accounted righteousness. If I
[51:54] went and earned a million dollars and I
[51:56] took the million dollars I earned and
[51:57] put it in the bank. It was not accounted
[51:59] to me. It was not imputed unto me. I
[52:02] earned it. If Abraham was righteous and
[52:04] then God called him righteous, he didn't
[52:07] account him righteous. He didn't impute
[52:09] unto him righteousness. He didn't.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Are we on the same page?
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; So, it wasn't Abraham's righteous deeds
[52:17] that made him righteous. It was his
[52:18] faith in the word of God. Amen.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; And what word did he believe? The word
[52:22] that came in his day and hour. What God
[52:24] spoke to him, he believed it. Present
[52:27] tense truth.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; That's what makes sons and daughters of
[52:31] God to this day and seed of Abraham.
[52:33] They the seed of Abraham has always
[52:35] believed present tense truth. From the
[52:37] beginning of the Bible to the end of the
[52:39] Bible, you can find the seed of God
[52:41] because they always receive present
[52:43] tense truth. Yeah.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Now, to him that workketh is the reward
[52:48] not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
[52:51] Amen. If I worked for a million dollars
[52:53] and put it in, or I worked for you for a
[52:56] million and I earned it and you put it
[52:58] in my account, you owed me.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; I don't know how I'd ever get you to owe
[53:02] me a million dollars, but maybe 10
[53:04] bucks.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Let's make it. I swept your driveway.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; And And you gave me 10 bucks. Then you
[53:11] gave me righteousness by debt. Yeah.
[53:14] Amen.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; NOT BY GRACE.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; But if you just loved me and for no
[53:20] reason decided, now we're not going 10
[53:22] bucks. For no reason, you gave me a
[53:24] million dollars
[53:25] &gt;&gt; cuz I can only earn $10 worth at a time.
[53:28] Amen. But it's going to take grace to
[53:29] get more than that.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; But you see the difference. This is what
[53:35] God did for Abraham. This is what God
[53:37] does for the seed of Abraham. We come
[53:39] the same exact way.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But him, but now to him that
[53:44] workketh not, that means you didn't earn
[53:45] it, but believeth on him that justifith
[53:48] the ungodly, his faith is counted for
[53:51] righteousness. Even as David also
[53:54] described the blessedness of the man
[53:55] unto whom God imputth righteousness
[53:58] without works,
[54:01] &gt;&gt; saying, "Blessed are they whose
[54:02] iniquities are forgiven and whose sins
[54:04] are covered. Blessed is the man to whom
[54:06] the Lord will not impute sin." I'm going
[54:10] to highlight this whole thing. Blessed
[54:13] is the man to whom the Lord will not
[54:15] impute sin.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; You mean there are people on this earth
[54:20] that God will not impute sin onto?
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is WHAT IS HE SAYING? HE'S
[54:28] SAYING, LISTEN, BROTHER CHAD, HE'S
[54:29] SAYING YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING.
[54:31] THERE ARE A PEOPLE on this earth that
[54:33] can get away with anything because
[54:35] Christ already paid the price for the
[54:38] seed. THEY HAVE TO COME TO REPENTANCE.
[54:40] ABSOLUTELY. AMEN. THEY HAVE TO
[54:41] SURRENDER. ABSOLUTELY. BUT GOD will not
[54:44] impute sin.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man to whom the LORD WILL
[54:50] NOT impute sin. WHO SAID THIS? DAVID.
[54:54] Did David ever do anything wrong?
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God. When when David was
[55:02] found out for what he did wrong, he did
[55:04] evil. He did wickedness. Amen. above
[55:06] what I believe any of us could have
[55:08] imagined and how it affected lives and
[55:10] how it affected the kingdom. Amen. But
[55:12] when Nathan or when the prophet came to
[55:14] him and said and exposed him and said,
[55:16] you know, you're the one, he said, I am
[55:18] guilty. I have sinned. And immediately
[55:20] the next sentence out of Nathan's mouth
[55:22] was and God has forgiven your sin.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; GOD WOULD NOT IMPUTE UNTO DAVID. OF
[55:28] COURSE, HE HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE, OF
[55:30] COURSE, he had TO SURRENDER. BUT GOD
[55:31] WOULDN'T SAY you're a sinner on your
[55:33] account as sinner. You're a sinner
[55:35] forever. NO, HE WOULD NOT IMPUTE that
[55:37] unto his son. Amen. But because David
[55:39] surrendered and believed, he kept
[55:41] imputing righteousness AND RIGHTEOUSNESS
[55:43] AND RIGHTEOUSNESS. NOT BECAUSE DAVID
[55:45] EARNED IT, but because God determined
[55:47] it.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; I'm glad the Bible's honest.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, blessed is the man whom the
[55:56] Lord will not impute sin. I want to be
[55:59] one of those men. I want to be one of
[56:01] those people that God will not impute
[56:03] sin to.
[56:05] Amen.
[56:07] Now, that's my foundation.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Actually, I want to go back and read
[56:12] another script. Stay in Romans. If you
[56:13] started turning, I'm sorry. Go back to
[56:16] Romans chapter 4. I want to read a
[56:19] little further down. Romans chapter 4
[56:23] and verse 8.
[56:27] I want to read this again. Blessed is
[56:28] the man to whom the Lord will not impute
[56:31] sin. I can't think of a greater
[56:33] blessing. Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
[56:37] not impute sin.
[56:39] Cometh this blessedness then upon the
[56:41] circumcision only. Is this only for the
[56:42] Jews or upon the uncircumcision?
[56:45] Gentiles also for we say that faith was
[56:48] reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
[56:51] Reckoned is the same word we've been
[56:53] talking about. Accounted. How was it
[56:55] then reckoned? Accounted when he was in
[56:57] circumcision or in uncircumcision. Not
[56:59] in circumcision but in uncircumcision.
[57:03] And he received the sign of
[57:04] circumcision, a seal of the
[57:05] righteousness of the faith which he had,
[57:08] yet being uncircumcised. And he might be
[57:10] the father of all them that believe,
[57:12] though they be not circumcised, that
[57:14] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[57:17] also. That's us, non-Jews, non-law
[57:20] followers. Amen. When it came to us, he
[57:23] he showed him an uncircumcision in his
[57:25] calling before he was circumcised. Amen.
[57:28] He called him. He believed it was
[57:30] imputed unto him for righteousness. And
[57:32] circumcision was given as a seal of his
[57:34] faith. Amen. So that it could come to
[57:36] us. The whole purpose of that so we
[57:38] could realize. Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; That he might be the father.
[57:44] Father.
[57:45] Who's my father? Abraham.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; What do I get if he's my father? That's
[57:50] a child. I'm his seed. If I'm his child,
[57:52] then I get the promise of Abraham. And
[57:54] the blessing of Abraham can come upon
[57:56] the Gentiles. and he might be the father
[58:00] of all them that believe, though they be
[58:03] not circumcised, that righteousness
[58:05] might imputed be imputed unto them also.
[58:08] It wasn't just given to Abraham, but
[58:10] Abraham as a father received what his
[58:12] children will receive. And he's the
[58:14] father of all them that believe.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[58:21] That rightees might be imputed unto them
[58:24] also. and the father of circumcision to
[58:27] them who are not of the circumcision
[58:29] only, but who also walk in the steps of
[58:31] that faith of our father Abraham, which
[58:34] he had, being yet uncircumcised. For the
[58:37] promise that he should be heir of the
[58:38] world, was not to Abraham or to his seed
[58:41] through the law, but through the
[58:43] righteousness of faith. So when God
[58:45] says, "You're going to be heir of it
[58:46] all." Amen. That's through the
[58:49] imputation of righteousness by faith.
[58:52] For if they which are of the law be
[58:54] heirs, faith is made void. and the
[58:55] promise made of none effect. Because the
[58:57] law workketh wrath, for where no law is,
[58:59] there is no transgression. Therefore, it
[59:02] is of faith that it might be by grace
[59:05] free gift. To the end the promise might
[59:09] be sure to all the seed, not to that
[59:12] only which is of the law, but to that
[59:14] also which is of the faith of Abraham,
[59:16] who is the father of us all.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Is Abraham your father?
[59:22] &gt;&gt; If you're of faith, he is. He is the
[59:24] father of us all. That means I'm a
[59:28] recipient of the blessing and the
[59:30] promise of Abraham.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, praise God.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; The children of Abraham believed the way
[59:40] Abraham believed.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; And God wasn't asking Abraham to believe
[59:45] what had transpired hundreds of years
[59:47] ago when Noah built an ark.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He of course he believed that or
[59:52] in Job's writings, but God was asking
[59:54] him to believe. When God came to him
[59:56] with truth, he asked him to believe it.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; And from the beginning of the Bible to
[1:00:02] the end of the Bible, salvation has
[1:00:04] always been based on the same thing. It
[1:00:06] has always been based on receiving the
[1:00:08] word for your day.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Always. It has never changed. It has
[1:00:13] always been. And the righteous have
[1:00:14] always been declared by those who could
[1:00:16] receive the truth in the day and hour
[1:00:18] they live.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; And those are the seed of Abraham.
[1:00:24] Praise God. By his grace, I am what I
[1:00:28] am.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to Genesis 20.
[1:00:42] We know this story super well.
[1:00:47] And many of you probably know what I'm
[1:00:49] going to say before I say it, but praise
[1:00:51] God. Let's say it.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Together.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Genesis 20
[1:00:57] verse one.
[1:00:59] And Abraham journeyed from then toward
[1:01:00] the south country and dwelt between
[1:01:03] Kadesish and Shir and sojurned in
[1:01:05] Guerrar. And Abraham said of Sarah, his
[1:01:08] wife, she is my sister. And Aimilec,
[1:01:10] king of Gar, sent and took Sarah. This
[1:01:12] is an interesting part of scripture
[1:01:13] because this is after the meeting on the
[1:01:14] plains of Mamry. Amen. In in Genesis 18
[1:01:17] where God came in flesh and spoke to him
[1:01:19] and revealed the thoughts in Sarah's
[1:01:21] heart in the tent behind him. Amen. And
[1:01:22] brother Bam told us when they woke up,
[1:01:24] their bodies were changed. They were
[1:01:25] turned back young again. And now they go
[1:01:27] to Guerrar. And in Gerrar, the king
[1:01:29] wants this young 80year-old maid
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; who's beautiful, more beautiful than
[1:01:35] anybody in his kingdom. and he wants the
[1:01:36] old lady to be his princess. But God's
[1:01:39] showing something transpired, amen,
[1:01:41] after the meeting with God and brought
[1:01:43] them back to their young condition again
[1:01:45] in preparation for receiving the seed.
[1:01:48] And so Abraham in order to save himself
[1:01:50] and made a deal with his wife. And when
[1:01:52] they went before, this is the second
[1:01:54] time Abraham does this. The first time
[1:01:56] is in Egypt. And when he goes to Egypt,
[1:01:58] he says, "Now you're a fair woman to
[1:01:59] look upon." This was many years before.
[1:02:01] You're a fair woman to look upon. and
[1:02:03] you know they'll say he's that's his
[1:02:05] wife and they'll kill me so they can
[1:02:07] have you.
[1:02:09] And he says do me this favor wherever we
[1:02:11] go. Amen. Just tell them that you're my
[1:02:13] sister. And so she did. And they went
[1:02:15] down to the the to Egypt and the princes
[1:02:17] of Pharaoh took her away and brought her
[1:02:19] to Pharaoh and they were going to they
[1:02:20] were going to I guess I guess make her
[1:02:21] one of Pharaoh's princesses. Amen. And
[1:02:24] all of a sudden it was uncovered and and
[1:02:26] found out. Amen. And Pharaoh sent them
[1:02:28] away. Amen. So now this is the second
[1:02:30] time that that uh Abraham is doing this
[1:02:33] and they go to Gerrar and they tell the
[1:02:36] king Aimilec that she is my sister. So
[1:02:40] the king took her.
[1:02:42] But look at verse three. But God came to
[1:02:45] Aimilec in a dream by night
[1:02:48] and said to him, "Behold, thou art but a
[1:02:51] dead man, for the woman which thou hast
[1:02:54] taken, for she is a man's wife." And
[1:02:58] Aimilec had not come near her. And he
[1:03:00] said,"Lord, wilt thou slay also a
[1:03:02] righteous nation?" Said he not unto me,
[1:03:05] "She is my sister." And she even she
[1:03:08] herself said, "He is my brother. In the
[1:03:10] integrity of my heart, and innocency of
[1:03:13] my hands have I done this."
[1:03:16] And God said unto him in a dream, "Yay,
[1:03:19] I know that thou did this in the
[1:03:21] integrity of thy heart, for I also
[1:03:24] withheld thee from sinning against me.
[1:03:26] Therefore suffered I thee not to touch
[1:03:29] her. Now therefore restore the man his
[1:03:32] wife for he is a prophet. And he shall
[1:03:34] pray for thee and thou shalt know that
[1:03:37] thou thou shalt know I'm sorry. And thou
[1:03:40] shalt know thou that thou shalt surely
[1:03:43] die thou and all that are in thine. Let
[1:03:46] me read that verse again. Verse 7. Now
[1:03:48] therefore restore the man his wife for
[1:03:49] he is a prophet and he shall pray for
[1:03:51] thee and thou shalt live. And if thou
[1:03:53] restore her not, know that thou that
[1:03:56] thou shalt surely die, thou and all that
[1:03:59] are thine. That's a lot of thous,
[1:04:03] all that are thine. Amen. Therefore,
[1:04:06] Aimilec rose early in the morning, and
[1:04:08] called all of his servants, and told all
[1:04:10] these things in their ears, and the men
[1:04:11] were sore afraid. Then Aimilec called
[1:04:14] Abraham, and said unto him, "What hast
[1:04:16] thou done unto us? And what have I
[1:04:18] offended thee that thou hast brought on
[1:04:20] me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou
[1:04:23] hast done deeds unto me that ought not
[1:04:25] to be done. And Aimilec said unto
[1:04:27] Abraham, "What sawest thou that thou
[1:04:30] hast done this thing?" And Abraham said,
[1:04:32] "Because I thought, surely the fear of
[1:04:34] God is not in this place, and they will
[1:04:37] slay me for my wife's sake." Amen. So we
[1:04:40] see the story as the story transpires
[1:04:43] and begins to unfold. Amen. Aimilec in
[1:04:47] this story does nothing wrong.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; How many agree
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Aimilec is innocent?
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Who's guilty?
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Is Abraham guilty?
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Is Sarah guilty?
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; She was listening to her husband, but
[1:05:04] she still lied.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; They both lie. Well, it was kind of a
[1:05:08] white lie cuz you know they have the
[1:05:10] same father, so they're half brother and
[1:05:12] sister.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; The lie wasn't that they're brother and
[1:05:14] sisters. The lie was they left out the
[1:05:16] truth. We're husband and wife.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; So now they they they they have this
[1:05:22] situation where Abraham is saving his
[1:05:24] own neck. Sarah agrees. They go along
[1:05:26] the king of Gerrar and God comes to him
[1:05:28] in a dream. Amen. God is so merciful,
[1:05:31] friends,
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; that he comes to this Aimilec and he
[1:05:35] begins to reveal to him in a dream that
[1:05:37] you look at the wording. Let's go back
[1:05:39] and look at it
[1:05:43] in verse four. But Aimilec had not come
[1:05:46] near her. And and he said, "Lord, wilt
[1:05:48] thou slay also a righteous nation?"
[1:05:49] Let's go back to verse three. But God
[1:05:51] came to Aimilec in a dream by night and
[1:05:53] said to him, "Behold, thou art but a
[1:05:54] dead man. For the woman which thou hast
[1:05:56] taken, for she is a man's wife." Look at
[1:05:59] what he says first off. Aimilec, you're
[1:06:01] a dead man.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; because you've got a man's wife. And
[1:06:04] he's like, "WHAT? WAIT A MINUTE. TIME
[1:06:07] OUT.
[1:06:08] I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. you know my
[1:06:11] innocency and the integrity of my heart
[1:06:13] THAT I THAT I HE SAID AND SHE SAID LORD
[1:06:17] YOU KNOW AND LORD SAYS I KNOW THAT'S WHY
[1:06:19] I KEPT YOU FROM sinning against me I
[1:06:21] prevented you not to go near her this is
[1:06:23] my mercy unto you
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; but in order to fix this problem you
[1:06:28] need to go to Abraham and have Abraham
[1:06:30] pray for you because if you don't you're
[1:06:32] finished
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; anybody else read this as a
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; head scratcher Yeah,
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; you would think that Abraham should be
[1:06:43] going to Aimilec for mercy and for
[1:06:46] forgiveness,
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; That Abraham owes a Beimilec an apology.
[1:06:53] That Abraham should go to Aimilec and
[1:06:55] say, "Please forgive me and pray for me
[1:06:57] that God will spare me for this thing
[1:06:58] that I've done to you."
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; And Aimilec says, "Why have you DONE TO
[1:07:03] THIS? WHY HAVE WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS?
[1:07:05] WHY WHY HAVE WE OFFENDED YOU? Why would
[1:07:07] you bring this on our kingdom?" And and
[1:07:09] Abraham says, "Because I thought surely
[1:07:10] the fear of the Lord is not in this
[1:07:12] place and they'll slay me for her." He
[1:07:14] misjudged Aimilec. It was Abraham's
[1:07:17] assumption and misjudging Abec. And
[1:07:20] Aimilec proved that he feared God
[1:07:21] because God came to him and he responded
[1:07:23] to God.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; But it was Abraham's false assumption.
[1:07:28] Amen. Abraham as a man, he assumed
[1:07:30] they're not fear God here. Amen. But but
[1:07:32] he had it wrong.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Abraham was doubly wrong. He was wrong
[1:07:37] in his assumption about Aimilec. HE WAS
[1:07:40] WRONG IN HIS LIE AND HIS ACTION. AND NOW
[1:07:42] AIMILEC is holding the consequences for
[1:07:45] Abraham's actions.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; And God in mercy comes to him and says,
[1:07:51] "Listen, you're dead. You're finished.
[1:07:55] It's over with you unless you restore
[1:07:57] that man his wife." Listen, there is
[1:08:01] something very different between the
[1:08:04] predestinated seed of God
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; and the rest of the world.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; No matter how harsh that sounds, no
[1:08:11] matter how hard it sounds, it's an
[1:08:13] absolute Bible truth.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Abraham is dead wrong.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Aimilec is 100% guiltless and innocent.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Who is God going to destroy, Abraham or
[1:08:27] Aimilec? Yeah.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; The Bible's not fair.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; But the Bible is righteous.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; if the Bible was fair, he could never
[1:08:45] receive me.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; I could never be saved. I could never be
[1:08:49] his if he played just fair. But I'm so
[1:08:53] glad he has a plan. And his plan is
[1:08:56] righteous and just and holy and merciful
[1:09:00] and good and kind.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; He is all things at once. And he has a
[1:09:04] way of navigating it all. I don't always
[1:09:07] understand how to navigate it. I can't
[1:09:09] always figure out what's right and
[1:09:10] what's wrong and what should be done in
[1:09:12] each circumstance. We as human beings,
[1:09:14] we read this story. Listen, if this had
[1:09:16] happened modern day, let's say this
[1:09:17] happens 2025 and you're asked to sit on
[1:09:20] the panel and judge. Who do you condemn?
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; WHO DO YOU CALL GUILTY? WHO DO YOU
[1:09:26] PUNISH?
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; That just shows we don't judge the way
[1:09:34] God judges.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Our humanistic ideas of what's fair. Our
[1:09:39] humanistic ideas is what's love. Our
[1:09:41] humanistic ideas are not what's in this
[1:09:44] scripture. That's
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; But God knows best and God knows what
[1:09:48] he's doing and God has it figured out.
[1:09:52] If we go down to to verse 17, it says,
[1:09:55] "So Abraham prayed unto God, and God
[1:09:58] healed Aimilec and his wife and his
[1:10:01] maidervants, and they bear children. For
[1:10:04] the Lord had fast closed up all the
[1:10:06] wombs of the house of Aimilec, because
[1:10:08] of Sarah, Abraham's wife." The judgment
[1:10:11] of God had already begun.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The only way that God was going to
[1:10:16] lift this judgment on Aimilec and his
[1:10:18] household and everything under his
[1:10:20] headship, the only way that God would
[1:10:22] lift that is if Abraham prayed for him.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Abraham the guilty party.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Abraham the liar.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Abraham the coward.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:42] I don't know, but to me, this is
[1:10:44] amazing.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; It defies all logic and reasoning.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; But yet, it's God.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Now, I just want to We've talked about a
[1:10:56] lot of these things before, but let's
[1:10:58] take this from another angle.
[1:11:00] Let's say you're Abraham.
[1:11:04] And all of a sudden, all of this
[1:11:06] transpires
[1:11:08] and it all comes out and Amalecch says,
[1:11:10] "This is God. Come to me in dream. This
[1:11:11] is what he told me." He said, "I'm dead.
[1:11:14] Our whole nation's lost. We're all in
[1:11:16] trouble if you don't pray for me.
[1:11:22] You're Abraham."
[1:11:25] And you're in this whole scene.
[1:11:28] And before then, I'm sure Abraham was
[1:11:30] praying because his wife had already
[1:11:32] been separated from him.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; She was already separated and moved off
[1:11:36] to the king's palace or tent or wherever
[1:11:38] she was. He was there. He was getting
[1:11:41] ready to take her for another bride.
[1:11:44] Abraham, no doubt, is like, "What is
[1:11:46] going on, Lord? What have I done?"
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; My wife, your promise, what you said,
[1:11:52] the seed line, now she's going to be I
[1:11:54] don't know what to do. What am I
[1:11:56] supposed to do? And now God
[1:11:58] supernaturally comes on the scene to
[1:12:00] protect his own word and to protect his
[1:12:01] own servant. And God does all the things
[1:12:03] that he needs to do. And now Amalecch
[1:12:05] comes to him and says, "Why, Abraham?
[1:12:07] Why?
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Did I mistreat you? Did I not receive
[1:12:11] you? Did I not give you a place for your
[1:12:13] flocks and your herds? And I not welcome
[1:12:14] you into the kingdom. What have I done
[1:12:16] to offend you? Why would you do this to
[1:12:18] me, Abraham?"
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; And Abraham says, "Because I thought you
[1:12:23] were a ranked sinner and didn't fear
[1:12:24] God."
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Make it worse.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; His explanation is, I had no confidence
[1:12:30] in you.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Listen, you're Abraham now.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; And Aim said, "God told me that you have
[1:12:41] to pray for me or we're all lost. Would
[1:12:43] you please pray for me now?" And then
[1:12:44] before he prays for him, he says, "And
[1:12:46] and here's a bunch of gold and here's a
[1:12:48] bunch of oxen and here's a bunch and
[1:12:49] here's all the gifts and here's all the
[1:12:51] rewards for your failure and for your
[1:12:53] misconduct and for your lying and for
[1:12:55] your cowardice. I'm going to give you
[1:12:56] all these prizes.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to enrich you more and give
[1:13:03] you so many pieces of silver for your
[1:13:06] wife to restore her, to redeem her. I
[1:13:08] give you all of this. Now, would you
[1:13:09] please pray for me?"
[1:13:11] If that was you and your face is flushed
[1:13:14] with shame because of your cowardice,
[1:13:16] because of your lie, and you realize the
[1:13:18] consequence of your action on another
[1:13:20] human being, and that they were doomed
[1:13:22] to die and fail on a whole nation
[1:13:24] because of you, because of your
[1:13:25] misconduct, because of your lie, because
[1:13:27] of your stories, what kind of prayer did
[1:13:30] he pray?
[1:13:33] Would you feel very confident in praying
[1:13:37] if you were Abraham?
[1:13:39] Would you feel like the super righteous
[1:13:43] son of God, heir of the world?
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; There would be absolutely no pride in
[1:13:49] that prayer.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; There would be absolutely no self-
[1:13:54] glorification.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; There would be absolutely no
[1:13:58] self-confidence,
[1:14:00] absolutely no self asssurance
[1:14:04] for me. Anyways,
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; you know what my prayer would be like? I
[1:14:09] don't know what Abraham said, so I'm not
[1:14:10] trying to add things to the Bible. I'm
[1:14:11] just telling you if I was in this
[1:14:13] situation, you know what my prayer would
[1:14:15] be like.
[1:14:18] Lord God, I'm sorry.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; You know, this is not Abbeimc's fault.
[1:14:23] This is my fault.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; God, would you please forgive him
[1:14:30] because this is my fault.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; How would you pray
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; after all that happened? And you'd be
[1:14:37] like, "See, Aimilec, I told you. Don't
[1:14:40] mess with me.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; There is no way."
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; You'd be utterly ashamed of yourself.
[1:14:46] You'd want to crawl in a hole somewhere
[1:14:48] and die because everything you were
[1:14:49] doing was exposed and God knew and now
[1:14:52] your actions were destroying a whole
[1:14:54] another life. Amen. I think it would
[1:14:56] cause you to to to almost crawl on your
[1:14:58] knees and say, "Oh, God, I am so sorry
[1:15:00] that I did this and my actions brought
[1:15:02] this upon other people. God, would you
[1:15:04] please forgive them for my sake and
[1:15:06] don't hold them accountable for any of
[1:15:08] this? For this is not their fault. It's
[1:15:09] my fault. Amen. And God heard Abraham's
[1:15:12] prayer, not a bec's prayer. Abraham was
[1:15:15] the only one that could release a
[1:15:17] beilec.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; THE FAILURE, THE COWARD, the liar.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was the one with the
[1:15:26] promise. He was the child of God. He was
[1:15:29] the one that God was with, not a beam
[1:15:31] with Abraham. because it was not
[1:15:33] attached to Abraham's Abraham's
[1:15:35] condition was not based on his conduct.
[1:15:38] His condition was based on his position
[1:15:40] with God.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And God chose that. ABRAHAM DIDN'T GOD
[1:15:48] CHOSE ABRAHAM. GOD SELECTED ABRAHAM. God
[1:15:50] told Abraham what he was. Amen. And
[1:15:52] Abraham believed God.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Abraham earned nothing. Didn't do
[1:15:58] anything to earn it. HE WASN'T
[1:15:59] RIGHTEOUS. HE just had a capacity to
[1:16:01] believe the voice of God when he heard
[1:16:03] the voice of God in this day. And by
[1:16:04] believing it, amen, he became heir of
[1:16:07] the promise. He became the one that God
[1:16:09] was dealing with in all the earth. He's
[1:16:10] dealing with Abraham. And Abraham's his
[1:16:12] prophet and God is watching over
[1:16:14] Abraham. And even though Abraham's an
[1:16:16] absolute utter failure, amen. God does
[1:16:19] not condemn Abraham, impute
[1:16:21] unrighteousness to Abraham, impute his
[1:16:23] sin unto him, but God continues to hold
[1:16:26] Abraham in righteousness. AND ABRAHAM
[1:16:28] NOW has the prayer THAT CAN RELEASE THE
[1:16:31] ONE WHO'S INNOCENT.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; THE GUILTY IS PRAYING FOR THE INNOCENT.
[1:16:36] AND GOD WILL ONLY HEAR the guilty. God,
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Listen, when your humanity can figure
[1:16:43] THAT OUT, COME BACK AND TALK TO ME.
[1:16:45] BECAUSE OUR HUMAN nature and our
[1:16:47] humanistic ideas and our humanism of
[1:16:50] fair, equality, and all of that, those
[1:16:52] are humanistic ideas. THOSE ARE NOT
[1:16:54] GOD'S THOUGHTS. THAT'S A MODERN CULTURE
[1:16:57] IDEA of equality and fairness and even
[1:17:01] for everything. God's never played that
[1:17:03] way.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad he hasn't.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; But now
[1:17:16] I think Abraham learned something.
[1:17:19] If it was me, I would have learned
[1:17:21] something.
[1:17:23] I'm so careful. I want to be careful
[1:17:24] that I don't inject things into the
[1:17:26] Bible that aren't in the Bible. But all
[1:17:27] I can do, amen, is see that Abraham's a
[1:17:30] man of like passions as we are. And if I
[1:17:32] was in this situation, I'd walk away
[1:17:33] there from going, "Oh God, I don't
[1:17:36] deserve this kind of grace.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm unworthy." And I
[1:17:41] would also walk there realizing
[1:17:43] how dangerous I am.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; To other people. Amen.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; How careful I would want to be from that
[1:17:56] moment on. The way I dealt with other
[1:17:58] human beings,
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; You say, "That's fine for Abraham, but
[1:18:03] what about for Abraham's seed?"
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Are we Abraham's seed?
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Are we part of the same promise? Amen.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; When God back in Genesis, whatever we
[1:18:19] read first, Genesis, I don't even
[1:18:21] remember now.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; 12. Thank you.
[1:18:26] Genesis 12, he said, "And I will make
[1:18:30] you a blessing."
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Abraham was intended to be the blessing.
[1:18:38] Amen. And here to Aimilec,
[1:18:41] he had become a curse. Yeah.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; But the only way Beimilec could be
[1:18:46] blessed was for Abraham to be the
[1:18:49] blessing.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; When I read a story like this and I go
[1:18:55] through it,
[1:18:57] there's nothing in this that makes me
[1:19:00] want to pump my chest and say, "I'm a
[1:19:02] child of Abraham." But when I read it, I
[1:19:04] say, "God, make me be careful."
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Careful. Cuz if this is the reality, if
[1:19:10] this is the way you deal with Abraham
[1:19:12] and his seed,
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; if those who bless you are blessed and
[1:19:14] those who curse you are cursed. If
[1:19:16] that's still true today,
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; then God help me
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; because I've been blessed to be a
[1:19:24] blessing, not a curse. And I don't want
[1:19:27] to be a curse in this earth. I want to
[1:19:28] be a blessing.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you would, let's let's look.
[1:19:35] We're not going to turn the Bibles, but
[1:19:36] I'm going to look at Job. I've got the
[1:19:37] scriptures all in the overhead. I want
[1:19:39] to look at Job for a minute. Job 1 6. It
[1:19:43] says, "Now there was a day when the sons
[1:19:46] of God came to present themselves before
[1:19:48] the Lord, and Satan came also among
[1:19:50] them. And the Lord said unto Satan,
[1:19:52] Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered
[1:19:54] the Lord, and said, go from going to and
[1:19:56] fro in the earth, and from walking up
[1:19:57] and down in it." And the Lord said unto
[1:19:59] Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant
[1:20:01] Job? that there is none like him in the
[1:20:03] earth, a perfect man and an upright man,
[1:20:05] one that fearth God and is skeweth evil.
[1:20:09] This is the way God sees Job. Job is
[1:20:11] another predestinated seed of God. Job
[1:20:13] is another one, amen, that God has
[1:20:15] ordained, that God has selected, that
[1:20:17] God has imputed righteousness unto. And
[1:20:19] he's telling he's telling Satan, there's
[1:20:21] nobody like Job. Have you considered
[1:20:23] him? I know you're trying everybody out
[1:20:24] there, but what about this one?
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; He's a perfect and upright man, one that
[1:20:28] fearth God and skeweth evil. He's
[1:20:30] another one of God's children. But Job
[1:20:33] now under affliction of the devil. First
[1:20:36] all his stuff is afflicted. All of his
[1:20:38] business and his assets and then his
[1:20:40] children and then himself and then
[1:20:42] children. And he's covered in boil
[1:20:43] sitting on an ash sheep. Lost all of his
[1:20:45] wealth. and he has three really nice
[1:20:47] friends who come along and decide to
[1:20:49] cheer him up by telling him he's a
[1:20:51] secret sinner and there's something
[1:20:52] wrong with him and he's under God's
[1:20:54] judgments and and and he begins to argue
[1:20:56] back with them and and and I'm just
[1:20:59] going to I'm just going to show you just
[1:21:00] a little bit of the dialogue from Job's
[1:21:02] side because Job is a little bit sharp,
[1:21:05] sarcastic, and cutting.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:08] when his dialogue with his friends. It
[1:21:11] appears to me that Job has lost his
[1:21:13] patience
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; with his friends.
[1:21:19] Job answers this way in Job 12. And Job
[1:21:21] answered and said, "No doubt, but you
[1:21:22] are the people and wisdom shall die with
[1:21:24] you."
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; I mean, is that a little sarcastic?
[1:21:30] Maybe.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; But I have understanding as well as you.
[1:21:33] I am not inferior to you. Yay. Who
[1:21:35] knoweth not such things as these?
[1:21:38] He's saying, "Duh."
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Like, who are you talking to? Like, you
[1:21:44] think I don't know that already. And
[1:21:46] obviously, no doubt you're the people
[1:21:48] and wisdom shall die with you. You're
[1:21:50] the only ones who know anything.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; But duh, everybody knows what you just
[1:21:53] told me. I'm sorry I brought it. That's
[1:21:56] the modern version of the Bible.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; 21st century Bible.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; But, I mean, that's pretty much what he
[1:22:03] told him. Right.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Right. And they're dialoguing back. And
[1:22:08] listen, I just want you to see that Job
[1:22:10] is not being careful. Job is not being
[1:22:12] pious. Job is not being overly
[1:22:14] religious. Job's at his wits end. He's
[1:22:16] frustrated. He's hurting. He He's done.
[1:22:18] And he's he's lashing back. Job 13:1.
[1:22:22] Lo, mine eyeath seen all this. Mine
[1:22:24] earard and understood it. What ye know,
[1:22:27] the same do I know also. I am not
[1:22:29] inferior to you. Surely I would speak to
[1:22:31] the Almighty and desire to reason with
[1:22:33] God. But you are forggers of lies. You
[1:22:35] are all physicians of no value. Oh that
[1:22:38] you would altogether hold your peace and
[1:22:39] it should be your wisdom.
[1:22:42] Job has some good zingers.
[1:22:45] You know if he sent that out on a group
[1:22:47] text, we'd been sending back fireballs
[1:22:49] and thumbs up and flames. You got them
[1:22:52] that time.
[1:22:57] I love reading the Bible. Amen. It's
[1:22:59] amaz Everything we live is in the Bible.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Everything, friends.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Here's the third one I want to read to
[1:23:06] you. Job 16 one. Then Job answered and
[1:23:09] said, I have heard many such things.
[1:23:11] Miserable comforters are ye all.
[1:23:18] Amen. You might want to put that in your
[1:23:20] back pocket. You could use that
[1:23:21] sometime. I have heard many such things.
[1:23:23] Miserable comforters are you all. Shall
[1:23:25] vain words have an end? or what
[1:23:27] emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? I
[1:23:30] also could speak as you do. If your soul
[1:23:32] were in my soulstead, I would heap up
[1:23:34] words against you and shake my head at
[1:23:36] you. I wouldn't I could I could heap up
[1:23:39] words against you and shake my head at
[1:23:41] you, but I would strengthen you with my
[1:23:43] mouth and the moving of my lips should
[1:23:44] assuage your grief. Said, I wouldn't do
[1:23:46] what you're doing. I would be helpful.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; You're miserable comforters. You're
[1:23:51] physicians of no value. You know what I
[1:23:53] know. You you you think you're the
[1:23:55] people and all wisdom will die when you
[1:23:57] die.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Man, I think Job is frustrated.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Angry, lashing back out at the things
[1:24:05] they say to him. And Job starts to
[1:24:08] defend himself to them. And in defending
[1:24:10] himself to them, Job starts to puff
[1:24:13] himself up to a place where he starts to
[1:24:16] accuse God of being unfair.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:19] and and and in lashing out against them,
[1:24:23] his miserable comforters and his
[1:24:25] physicians of no value. And lashing out
[1:24:27] against them, he starts to accuse God of
[1:24:31] not being fair because he's defending
[1:24:33] his own righteousness before those who
[1:24:34] are accusing him of being a secret
[1:24:36] sinner. So in order to defend himself,
[1:24:38] he's got to bring God down so that he
[1:24:40] can bring himself up. And this gets him
[1:24:43] in trouble with God.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. And then God comes to Job
[1:24:47] and he says, "Moreover, the Lord
[1:24:49] answered Job and said, Shall he that
[1:24:51] contendeth with the Almighty instruct
[1:24:53] him?" Are you my teacher, Job?
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; He that reproveth God, let him answer
[1:24:59] it. You who can correct me, give me an
[1:25:02] answer, Job.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Then Job answered the Lord and said,
[1:25:06] "Behold, I am vile.
[1:25:10] What shall I answer thee? I will lay my
[1:25:12] hand upon my mouth. Once have I spoken,
[1:25:14] but I will not answer. Yay. Twice, but I
[1:25:16] will proceed no further.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Job had wit, wisdom, he had a sharp
[1:25:25] mind, and he had a sharp tongue.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; But then God said,
[1:25:31] "Shall you that contend with the
[1:25:32] Almighty instruct him? Job, do you have
[1:25:35] something to teach me?" Mhm.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; And he that reproveth God, let him
[1:25:42] answer. You've been bringing correction.
[1:25:44] You've been talking about what's right
[1:25:45] and not right and what deeds I should
[1:25:47] and shouldn't be doing. I'm here now.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; How about using some of your sharp wit
[1:25:53] and sharp tongue and your zingers on me?
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Job said the best thing you could say.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; I am vile.
[1:26:06] What shall I answer thee? I will lay my
[1:26:08] hand upon my mouth. Once have I spoken,
[1:26:10] but I will not answer. Yay, twice, but I
[1:26:13] will proceed no further.
[1:26:17] Then answered the Lord unto Job out of
[1:26:20] the whirlwind and it said, G up thy
[1:26:21] loins now like a man. I will demand of
[1:26:24] thee and declare thou unto me. Wilt thou
[1:26:26] also disenol my judgment? Wil thou
[1:26:28] condemn me that thou mayest be
[1:26:30] righteous? Are you going to condemn me
[1:26:32] that you remain righteous? Then he went
[1:26:34] into a whole dialogue,
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; no monologue
[1:26:39] because Job wasn't answering.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Job knew enough now to keep his mouth
[1:26:43] shut. And God goes into a whole
[1:26:44] monologue of who he is and what he's
[1:26:46] done and what he set up. And he asked
[1:26:48] Job, "Can you figure this out? Can you
[1:26:50] answer this question? Do you know the
[1:26:51] answer to this? Do you know all things?
[1:26:53] You who are so smart and knows what's
[1:26:55] right and wrong." And and God put Job in
[1:26:57] his place.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Did God put Job in his place?
[1:27:01] Job was putting his friends in their
[1:27:03] place. But then God come along and put
[1:27:05] Job in his place.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Then Job says, "I've heard of thee by
[1:27:12] the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye
[1:27:14] seeth thee. Wherefore I abore myself and
[1:27:18] repent and dust and ashes."
[1:27:22] Did God correct Job?
[1:27:25] Did Job take the correction?
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Did Job get the point?
[1:27:30] I think I would have.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; But look what he says next.
[1:27:35] And it was so that after the Lord had
[1:27:37] spoken these words into Job, the Lord
[1:27:39] said to Elephaz, the Timite, "My wrath
[1:27:41] is kindled against thee and against thy
[1:27:43] two friends. For you have not spoken to
[1:27:45] me the thing that is right, as my
[1:27:47] servant Job hath."
[1:27:49] What
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; did he just correct Job?
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; But now he's defending Job.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:59] Therefore, take unto you now seven
[1:28:00] bulldocks and seven rams, and go to my
[1:28:02] servant Job, and offer up for yourselves
[1:28:04] a burnt offering, and my servant Job
[1:28:06] shall pray for you, for him will I
[1:28:10] accept,
[1:28:11] lest I deal with you after your folly,
[1:28:14] and that you have not spoken to me the
[1:28:16] thing which is right, like my servant
[1:28:18] Job." So, Elephaz the Timmonite, and
[1:28:21] Bildad the Shuhite, and Zofar the
[1:28:23] Neamothite went and did according as the
[1:28:26] Lord commanded them. The Lord also
[1:28:28] accepted Job. Did God accept them?
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; No. He accepted Job.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Because he accepted Job in his prayer,
[1:28:36] he accepted them because of Job.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; And the Lord also accepted Job. And the
[1:28:42] Lord turned the captivity of Job when he
[1:28:44] prayed for his friends. Also, the Lord
[1:28:46] gave Job twice as much as he had before.
[1:28:52] This is a strange turn of events.
[1:28:56] Job.
[1:28:58] These friends come along and they're
[1:29:01] accusing Job and they're speaking on
[1:29:04] behalf of God.
[1:29:06] They're saying, "Listen, God doesn't
[1:29:08] unrighteously judge. You've done
[1:29:10] something wrong. This is all happening
[1:29:12] because you need to judge your heart.
[1:29:13] You're a secret sinner and blah blah
[1:29:15] blah and all of these things." And God's
[1:29:17] listening all the time. And God doesn't
[1:29:19] like any of this.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; But then Job in defending himself, he
[1:29:23] starts putting God on trial. I've done
[1:29:25] nothing wrong. I don't know why God's
[1:29:27] doing this. If I could go knock on his
[1:29:28] door, I would plead my case with him. I
[1:29:30] would say, "Why have you done this to
[1:29:31] me?"
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; And then when it's all said and done,
[1:29:36] God's heard it all. But Job's position
[1:29:40] with God is different than these other
[1:29:41] three position with God.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; And God comes and corrects Job.
[1:29:49] Absolutely. God has every right to
[1:29:50] correct his children and will correct
[1:29:52] his children.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:54] But after God corrects Job and Job gets
[1:29:56] put in his place and he's humbled and
[1:29:58] he's back in the place that he should
[1:29:59] be, God comes to these other three and
[1:30:01] says, "Listen, you've not done right
[1:30:03] like you've not spoke right like my
[1:30:05] servant Job.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; So now what I need you to do is take
[1:30:13] seven bullocks and seven. I need you to
[1:30:15] make this offering." He never required
[1:30:16] Job did that.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now come to my servant Job
[1:30:21] and offer up yourselves a burnt
[1:30:22] offering." and my servant Job shall pray
[1:30:24] for you. For him will I accept. He was
[1:30:27] not accepting their seven bullocks and
[1:30:29] their seven rams and all their prayer.
[1:30:31] He was only accepting Job
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; and Job prayed
[1:30:39] and the Lord also accepted Job. And then
[1:30:43] because Job prayed and Job forgave them.
[1:30:46] Now listen, I wonder what Job's prayer
[1:30:48] was like.
[1:30:50] Can you imagine having just been put in
[1:30:52] your place by God? Hear
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; him come down in a whirlwind and show
[1:30:55] you his might and his power and shake
[1:30:57] everything around you and then bring
[1:30:59] correction to you to where you say
[1:31:00] you're a vile and you repent in dust and
[1:31:03] ashes and you're nothing. Amen. Then all
[1:31:05] of a sudden, as soon as you get to the
[1:31:07] lowest of the lowest and you realize
[1:31:09] you're an absolute failure and you spoke
[1:31:11] against God and you repent and you're
[1:31:14] vile and you repent in ashes and in dust
[1:31:16] and you're nothing,
[1:31:19] And then God says to your friends,
[1:31:20] "Okay, now Job I love. Job's my servant.
[1:31:23] And Job said good things about me. You
[1:31:25] come over here and let Job pray for
[1:31:27] you."
[1:31:28] What kind of prayer do you think Job
[1:31:30] prayed?
[1:31:32] See you worthless physicians. See you no
[1:31:34] good, miserable comforters. I told you.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; I do not think that's what Job said.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; I do not think that was Job's attitude.
[1:31:44] I think what Job was probably saying is,
[1:31:46] "Lord, would you please forgive them?
[1:31:50] Lord, I realize now they didn't mean to.
[1:31:54] They were only doing to me what I was
[1:31:56] doing to you."
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; And they were interceding. He was
[1:32:02] interceding for those three friends
[1:32:05] because he was the only one who could do
[1:32:06] it. And God would accept him, not them.
[1:32:09] And if Job didn't pray for them, I
[1:32:11] believe they would be in the same spot
[1:32:13] AMC would be in.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; So God had to accept Job. So they had to
[1:32:18] come to Job to be accepted by God
[1:32:21] because Job was the link between them
[1:32:22] and God. And Job needed to pray for them
[1:32:25] and forgive them and ask God to forgive
[1:32:26] them so that they could move on. And Job
[1:32:29] prayed and Job was accepted. And when
[1:32:31] Job humbled himself and now the ones
[1:32:33] that he was lashing out against with his
[1:32:35] tongue with the sharp words and the
[1:32:36] criticism and the zingers and the
[1:32:38] fireballs and the thumbs up and the
[1:32:40] clapping hands on the group chat
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; now he changes his tone completely.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Not calling them miserable comforters
[1:32:52] and physicians of no value. And he's not
[1:32:54] pumping his chest saying I know what you
[1:32:56] know. Apparently you think you're
[1:32:57] smarter. No. No. was, "Oh, God,
[1:33:01] would you please overlook their sin?
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; God, what they said about me wasn't
[1:33:06] right, but Lord, I'm wrong, too. Would
[1:33:07] you please?" And Lord,
[1:33:10] I may have pushed them to it by the
[1:33:12] things that I said to them.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; I may have inflamed them by my words.
[1:33:17] I may have pushed them by my conduct.
[1:33:22] Lord, would you please forgive them?
[1:33:26] And God accepted
[1:33:28] Job.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; And God accepted Job. It didn't mean
[1:33:36] Elephaz wasn't far sorry. It didn't mean
[1:33:39] Zofar wasn't sorry. It didn't mean they
[1:33:41] weren't repentant.
[1:33:43] But they needed Job
[1:33:46] because Job was in a special position
[1:33:48] with God that they weren't.
[1:33:51] And when I read a story like this and I
[1:33:53] read a story like a beam legs, it makes
[1:33:55] me say, "Oh, God, help me be careful."
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; I don't think we can get to the place
[1:34:02] where we can say, "I'm bride. I'm bride.
[1:34:04] I'm bride." Yeah, I believe that by
[1:34:06] faith and I'm eternally grateful that
[1:34:10] there's something in me that can say by
[1:34:12] the grace of God, I am what he said I
[1:34:14] am.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; And I do believe.
[1:34:17] But I think in all of that as we grow in
[1:34:21] our understanding and we mature and we
[1:34:23] come to a different place it should
[1:34:25] change our attitude completely.
[1:34:28] We say if that's who I am and if I'm
[1:34:30] seed of Abraham and heir to the promise
[1:34:33] and I'm in a position with Christ and
[1:34:35] it's a unique position in all the world
[1:34:37] that only a few are in by predestination
[1:34:40] then oh God help me be careful how I
[1:34:43] deal with other human beings and how I
[1:34:45] speak to them. and gone. If they can get
[1:34:47] in trouble for the way they speak to me,
[1:34:49] let me be careful for the way I speak to
[1:34:51] them.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; If somebody could condemn themselves for
[1:34:56] actions they take against me because I'm
[1:34:58] under Abraham's PROMISE AND ALL. IF I AM
[1:35:02] PART of Christ and I am part of a one of
[1:35:04] Abraham's children by faith and I'm
[1:35:06] under the promise of Abraham, then the
[1:35:08] same thing is true for my life as it was
[1:35:10] for Abraham's. All who bless me will be
[1:35:13] blessed and all who curse me will be
[1:35:15] cursed. Not because I decided that. I
[1:35:18] couldn't have decided that. I can't put
[1:35:20] myself in that position. Only God can.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; And he can by election and by
[1:35:25] predestination. And God determined that
[1:35:27] before. I never determined. You never
[1:35:30] determined. We never decided to be under
[1:35:32] Abraham's blessing.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; God chose that. And if God chose that
[1:35:38] and you accept it by faith, then let's
[1:35:40] wake up to it and realize that it
[1:35:42] matters the way we talk to people, the
[1:35:44] way we treat people, the way we conduct
[1:35:46] ourselves. Let's let's not do anyone
[1:35:48] wrong because we don't want anybody to
[1:35:49] do us wrong.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; I may be forgiven,
[1:35:54] but what about somebody else?
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Job may be accepted, but what about
[1:36:00] Job's friends?
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; God may not impute Abraham's sin unto
[1:36:05] him.
[1:36:06] But what about
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Aimilec?
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; God, be merciful.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Open our eyes. Give us a greater
[1:36:18] sensitivity. Give us a greater
[1:36:20] understanding than we've ever had
[1:36:22] before. That we know how to walk in this
[1:36:24] earth as Christ walked in this earth to
[1:36:26] be his representation, to be his bride,
[1:36:28] and to have it truly all about us on our
[1:36:31] mind. We say that things are true. If
[1:36:33] they're true, they're true.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if they're true, they're
[1:36:36] powerful and there's consequences for
[1:36:38] it.
[1:36:40] In Genesis 31,
[1:36:43] this is when Laban is chasing down
[1:36:45] Jacob. Jacob has run away from Laban.
[1:36:47] He's took his wives and his children and
[1:36:50] he and he took off and Laban's chasing
[1:36:52] him down because Laban he snuck away in
[1:36:54] the night. And listen, I'm going to
[1:36:56] black this out. I know what's happening.
[1:37:00] I can feel it.
[1:37:06] Laban and Jacob have spent 14 years
[1:37:09] pulling tricks on one another.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; We read the Bible.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; 14 years. He switched his wages 10
[1:37:18] times. He tricked him to get give Leah
[1:37:21] to him when he thought he was getting
[1:37:23] Rachel. And then he had to work another
[1:37:24] seven years for Rachel. And then in that
[1:37:27] period of time, he switched his wages 10
[1:37:29] times. But every time he switched his
[1:37:31] wages, Jacob had another trick up his
[1:37:33] sleeve and he could do popppler branches
[1:37:34] and the water troughs and this one and
[1:37:36] that one and and no matter if he
[1:37:38] switched it this way, then Jacob would
[1:37:40] switch it this way. And God even showed
[1:37:42] him in a dream which cattle to choose.
[1:37:44] Amen. They were just pulling tricks on
[1:37:46] each other.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Laban was a shyer.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; that's brother Ram said
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; suppler was what his word means. Suppler
[1:37:54] and overtaker, one who overtakes. I mean
[1:37:56] he and he did it through trickery over
[1:37:58] and over and over again. And he did it
[1:37:59] for his brother. Amen. He he did it he
[1:38:02] took advantage of Esau and his weakness
[1:38:04] to get the blessing and to get the the
[1:38:05] birthright. Then he in with with with a
[1:38:09] big trick uh uh come up with by his
[1:38:11] mother Rachel. Amen. He goes and
[1:38:12] deceives his father to get the blessing.
[1:38:14] Amen. Listen, he's a suppler.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; And not using good means.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Now, if God was fair,
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; yeah. Like us humans think that
[1:38:27] everything has to be fair and there has
[1:38:29] to be equity everywhere.
[1:38:33] When
[1:38:35] Isaac, Esau, and Jacob's father said,
[1:38:38] "Esau, I love you. I want to bless you
[1:38:42] before I die.
[1:38:44] Go out and hunt. Take your bow and get
[1:38:47] me h some venison and fix it the way I
[1:38:50] love it, and I'll bless you."
[1:38:52] And Rachel overhears the conversation
[1:38:54] and she comes and gets Jacob. Says,
[1:38:55] "Jacob, here's the deal." Amen. I go
[1:38:57] fetch two young kids. I'm going to dress
[1:38:59] them and get them just the way your
[1:39:00] father likes. Give. And she took Esau's
[1:39:02] garments that she had, put them on Esau.
[1:39:04] She took the skins off the goats because
[1:39:06] Esau was a hairy man. Put them on Jacob.
[1:39:08] She come with this plan. She said, "Go
[1:39:10] in and get the blessing."
[1:39:13] And he sneaks in there and his father
[1:39:15] said, "Who are you?" He says, "I'm Esau,
[1:39:17] your son." Mhm.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Boldface lie.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Absolute deception. 100% lie. As wrong
[1:39:27] as wrong can be.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Where will all liars go?
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; You think Jacob will be there? No.
[1:39:36] Because he was changed to Israel.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz he was a child of God. Bold-face.
[1:39:43] Absolute lie. Trickery and your own
[1:39:45] family. Deceiving your own father. Yeah.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Stealing from your own brother.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; I mean, does it get any worse?
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; I mean, there's hardly any family
[1:39:53] estates that get this bad after mom and
[1:39:56] dad die and the fight breaks out over
[1:39:57] the estate,
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:01] So, all of this mess and then he runs
[1:40:03] away and and there's a deception. His
[1:40:05] mom's in on it to talk to Esau and I
[1:40:07] can't stand these the these these
[1:40:09] daughters of Canaanites. They vex my
[1:40:11] soul. Send him back to get a wife and
[1:40:13] it's all a cover up. And then he runs
[1:40:15] away to escape from Esau. And he gets to
[1:40:17] Laban and God gives him gives him a good
[1:40:19] match.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; And the trickster meets the uncle who's
[1:40:23] a little better at it than he is. And
[1:40:26] they start pulling tricks on each other.
[1:40:30] And after so long, Jacob decides to run
[1:40:33] away. And he's going back to his
[1:40:34] father's house. And he runs away. And
[1:40:36] Laban is chasing after him. Amen.
[1:40:38] Because he stole away in the night. He
[1:40:40] didn't tell him what was happening. And
[1:40:42] Laban's frustrated. and he feels like
[1:40:44] he's been slighted and and he's going to
[1:40:46] go out there and he's going to make it
[1:40:47] right.
[1:40:49] But before he meets Jacob, it was told
[1:40:52] Laban on the third day that Jacob was
[1:40:54] fled. And he took his brethren with him
[1:40:56] and pursued after him seven days journey
[1:40:58] and they overtook him in the mountain
[1:41:00] Gilead. And God came to Laban the Syrian
[1:41:03] in a dream by night and said unto him,
[1:41:05] "Take heed that you speak not to Jacob,
[1:41:07] either good or bad." Listen,
[1:41:14] is Jacob bad?
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; I mean, Jacob is not the greatest fellow
[1:41:21] in the world.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have the most upstanding
[1:41:24] character. He's not the most honest.
[1:41:27] He's not the most straightforward. He's
[1:41:29] not somebody you probably would have
[1:41:31] liked to have been friends with at the
[1:41:32] time.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; You certainly wouldn't want his brother.
[1:41:39] That's right.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; But yet God's still sticking up for him.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; And he's also saving Laban.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Listen, I know there's been a lot going
[1:41:51] between the two of you, and I know he
[1:41:53] snuck away, and I know all that's been
[1:41:55] going on,
[1:41:57] but you be careful
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; when you go into Jacob's presence.
[1:42:02] Don't say nothing, either good or bad.
[1:42:06] Just keep your mouth shut because Jacob
[1:42:09] is already received the promise and the
[1:42:12] blessing and God has already confirmed
[1:42:14] the promise that he's a recipient of the
[1:42:17] blessing of Abraham and everyone who
[1:42:19] curses him will be cursed.
[1:42:22] So God warns Laban, be careful how you
[1:42:25] handle this one.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; The deceiver, the liar, the cheater, be
[1:42:32] careful what you say about him.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:35] My goodness,
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; if you were Laban, you probably felt
[1:42:40] like you had a lot of justifiable
[1:42:42] reasons to say a lot of things,
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; but God warned him not to.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; To me, listen, I'll tell you, I don't
[1:42:52] know who is elect and who's not elect.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; So, this makes me want to be careful.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; When somebody's rotten and doing rotten,
[1:43:00] I just don't want to say good or bad. I
[1:43:01] just want to keep my mouth shut
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; and let God sort it out
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; because I don't want to be f found
[1:43:07] fighting against God's elect and God's
[1:43:09] predestinated. I don't want to be found
[1:43:11] in that position where I'm speaking evil
[1:43:13] against that which God has chosen from
[1:43:15] before the foundation of the world
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; that Christ died and shed his blood for.
[1:43:20] Are they wrong? Sometimes yes. Sometimes
[1:43:22] they're completely wrong. Amen. But I
[1:43:24] don't want to put myself in wrong by
[1:43:27] condemning one that God is going to
[1:43:29] justify and that God has shed his blood
[1:43:31] for and that God has redeemed and is in
[1:43:33] the Lamb's book of life.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; So help us to be careful. And God was so
[1:43:38] good to Laban to come to him to protect
[1:43:40] Jacob. Jacob still needed a lot of
[1:43:42] growing. He needed a change in his life.
[1:43:45] He needed to wrestle with the angel. He
[1:43:46] needed to come amen to a different
[1:43:48] place. He needed to repent. He needed to
[1:43:50] make things right. He needed a change.
[1:43:52] And God was going to bring it to him.
[1:43:54] But it never changed who Jacob was.
[1:43:56] Because before Esau or Jacob were born,
[1:43:58] before they either did good or right,
[1:44:00] God said, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau
[1:44:03] have I hated." Yeah.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Now listen, after I tell you this story
[1:44:06] and all if I tell you all that Jacob's
[1:44:09] going to do to this point and all the
[1:44:11] things he's going to do and the lies and
[1:44:12] the deceit and the taking advantage of a
[1:44:14] weak brother and and taking advantage of
[1:44:17] his father-in-law and all that he's
[1:44:18] going to do and then you find out Esau
[1:44:21] was faithful to his dad and he was a
[1:44:23] good boy and and he took care of his old
[1:44:25] dad and he stayed.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Which one would you pick?
[1:44:32] Oh man, I'm so glad God picked before.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Before either were born, before either
[1:44:37] did good or evil, that election might
[1:44:40] stand. God said, "Jacob have I loved and
[1:44:42] Esau have I hated."
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; You may look at me somewhere in my
[1:44:47] journey and you may find an incomplete
[1:44:48] picture. Somebody that still needs
[1:44:50] cleaned up and fixed up and some
[1:44:52] repentance and some correction. And I
[1:44:54] may be like Job where I need to be
[1:44:55] smashed down to the ground by Almighty
[1:44:57] God a time or two more before I really
[1:44:59] vile myself. And
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; but it doesn't change who I am.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; I may need more. God may need to work on
[1:45:07] me more. I may need more correction. I
[1:45:10] may need more humility. I may need more
[1:45:12] of a lot of things. But by the grace of
[1:45:14] God, I am what I am. I'm seed of Abraham
[1:45:16] and part of this promise.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; And I know that whoever blesses me will
[1:45:21] be blessed. and whoever curses me will
[1:45:23] be cursed. So God help me to conduct
[1:45:26] myself in such a way that I don't bring
[1:45:28] condemnation to other people because of
[1:45:30] my error, my sin, my shortcomings, my
[1:45:33] tongue, my actions, my
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; God, help me
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; to live a sacrificial life, not just for
[1:45:40] myself, but for everyone else.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Say what you want, do what you want. GO
[1:45:46] OFF HALFCOCKED ALL THE TIME. GO DO WHAT
[1:45:48] YOU WANT. God will forgive me. I'm
[1:45:50] elect. I'm predestinated. But what are
[1:45:52] the trail of tears that are behind you?
[1:45:53] And what of everybody else?
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; If we are who we say we are, there's a
[1:46:00] responsibility that comes with the
[1:46:02] position.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; And the message influence, brother Rams,
[1:46:06] as you know, there are so many of us and
[1:46:08] most of all of us influence somebody by
[1:46:10] the things that we do and the way we
[1:46:12] live and the things we say. We influence
[1:46:15] somebody. Somebody is watching your
[1:46:17] life. And then when we profess to be
[1:46:19] Christians, what type of life should we
[1:46:20] live? If somebody is watching us and
[1:46:22] your life that you live will reflect an
[1:46:24] influence on somebody, it might be their
[1:46:27] eternal destination will rest upon the
[1:46:31] way that you live and the things that
[1:46:32] you do. For they watch you.
[1:46:37] Somebody else's eternal destination will
[1:46:40] rest upon the way that you live and the
[1:46:43] things that you do.
[1:46:45] This wouldn't be the predestinated seg
[1:46:47] of God because they already
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; have eternal life.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; This is somebody else.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Somebody who's not bride, somebody who's
[1:46:56] not part of the covenant with Abraham,
[1:46:58] somebody who's not part of that promise.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Their eternal destination will rest upon
[1:47:04] the way that you live, the things that
[1:47:06] you do. For they watch you.
[1:47:10] In Matthew five, Jesus says, "You are
[1:47:12] the salt of the earth. But of the salt
[1:47:15] have lost its savor, wherewith shall it
[1:47:16] be salt. It is therefore good for
[1:47:18] nothing, but to be cast out and be
[1:47:20] trodden underfoot of men. Ye are the
[1:47:22] light of the world. A city that is set
[1:47:24] on a hill cannot be hid, neither do men
[1:47:26] light a candle and put it under a
[1:47:28] bushel, but on a candlestick, and it
[1:47:30] giveth light unto all that are in the
[1:47:31] house. Let your light so shine before
[1:47:33] men, that they may see your good works,
[1:47:35] and glorify your father which is in
[1:47:38] heaven."
[1:47:39] Amen. We're supposed to be light.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be salt.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say all human beings are
[1:47:47] salt.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; And he didn't say all human beings are
[1:47:50] light.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Who was he talking to?
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; He was talking to his children.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; You are salt and you are light. That's
[1:47:59] not everybody.
[1:48:01] That's the predestinated.
[1:48:04] Then if we are salt and we are light
[1:48:07] then we should live salty and we should
[1:48:11] shine light.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; In the message identification the
[1:48:16] prophet says let your lives be so salty
[1:48:18] that others can watch the way you act
[1:48:21] and live that they'll want to live that
[1:48:23] way too. You know Jesus said you are the
[1:48:24] salt of the earth but if the salt has
[1:48:26] lost its testimony, its savor, its
[1:48:29] drawing power then it can no more heal
[1:48:31] or save. Salt says when it contacts, we
[1:48:34] must be God's contact. We are his point
[1:48:38] of contact.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; I think sometimes we live sometimes we
[1:48:44] live life so egoentrical.
[1:48:47] It's all about us.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; God saved me. God loves me. God's
[1:48:51] restoring me. God's rapturing me. And
[1:48:53] it's all about me. And we forget
[1:48:55] sometimes that it's really about God.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Why did he do it? for his good pleasure,
[1:49:00] according to his purpose, by his will,
[1:49:02] by his desire, by what he wanted.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; And then he made me a child of Abraham
[1:49:09] and the covenants with me. And and but
[1:49:12] that covenant upon Abraham was that
[1:49:15] Abraham would not receive a blessing,
[1:49:17] for he will, but that Abraham will be a
[1:49:20] blessing.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Part of the Abrahamic covenant is
[1:49:23] that Abraham will be a blessing and that
[1:49:26] all nations will be blessed in Abraham.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; So if that's part of the Abrahamic
[1:49:32] covenant, then that's on the children of
[1:49:34] Abraham as well. If you're part of the
[1:49:36] covenant, then God put you on earth to
[1:49:38] be a blessing.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; And I want to be a blessing.
[1:49:46] He said in Matthew 10, he that receiveth
[1:49:49] you receiveth me. He that receiveth me
[1:49:51] receiveth him that sent me. He that
[1:49:54] receiveth a prophet in the name of a
[1:49:55] prophet shall receive a prophet's
[1:49:56] reward. And he that receiveth a
[1:49:58] righteous man, in the name of a
[1:50:00] righteous man shall receive a righteous
[1:50:01] man's reward. And whosoever shall give
[1:50:04] to drink unto one of these little ones a
[1:50:06] cup of cold water, only in the name of a
[1:50:09] disciple, verily I say unto you, he
[1:50:11] shall in no wise lose his reward.
[1:50:14] Mark says it this way. For whosoever
[1:50:17] shall give you a cup of water to drink
[1:50:19] in my name because you belong to Christ,
[1:50:21] verily I say unto you, he shall not lose
[1:50:23] his reward.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; If because you belong to Christ,
[1:50:27] somebody wants to do you some little
[1:50:29] service, love you, do something for you,
[1:50:31] they'll not lose their reward.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 25 together. Turn
[1:50:36] with me to Matthew 25.
[1:50:49] Matthew 25 and31
[1:50:58] says in Matthew 25:31, "When the Son of
[1:51:01] Man shall come in his glory and all the
[1:51:03] holy angels with him, then shall he sit
[1:51:05] upon the throne of his glory, and before
[1:51:07] him shall be gathered all nations, and
[1:51:09] he shall separate them one from another
[1:51:11] as a shepherd as a shepherd divideth his
[1:51:13] sheep from his goats
[1:51:15] and he shall set the sheep on his right
[1:51:17] hand but the goats on the left. Now when
[1:51:20] brother comes to the scripture he
[1:51:22] explains to us that the Bible says that
[1:51:25] he shall separate them one from another
[1:51:28] as a shepherd divideth his sheep. He's
[1:51:32] not separating sheep and goats. This is
[1:51:34] just an analogy. He's separating two
[1:51:35] groups of people. The sheep have already
[1:51:38] been raptured. The sheep don't go to the
[1:51:39] white throne judgment. The sheep are not
[1:51:41] judged because there's no condemnation
[1:51:42] to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[1:51:45] They've passed from death unto life.
[1:51:47] There is no judgment for those that are
[1:51:48] already part of Christ.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; This is a different judgment. So he's
[1:51:53] separating them now. And he shall set
[1:51:55] the sheep on the right hand, but the
[1:51:57] goats on the left. Then shall the king
[1:51:59] say unto them on his right hand, come
[1:52:01] ye, blessed of my father, inherit the
[1:52:03] kingdom prepared for you from the f
[1:52:05] foundation of the world. For I was
[1:52:07] hungered and you gave me meat. I was
[1:52:10] thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a
[1:52:12] stranger and you took me in. Naked and
[1:52:15] you clothed me. I was sick and you
[1:52:16] visited me. I was in prison and you came
[1:52:19] unto me. Then shall the righteous answer
[1:52:21] him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee a
[1:52:23] hungered and fed thee, or thirsty, and
[1:52:25] gave thee drink? When saw we thee a
[1:52:27] stranger, and took thee in, or naked and
[1:52:29] clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick
[1:52:32] and in prison, and came unto thee? And
[1:52:34] the king shall answer and say unto them,
[1:52:36] verily I say unto you, in so much as you
[1:52:38] have done it unto one of the least of
[1:52:40] these my brethren, you have done it unto
[1:52:42] me.
[1:52:44] Where are the brethren? The least of
[1:52:46] these my brethren he's talking about.
[1:52:48] Remember we've been going over the
[1:52:50] scripture. Amen. He that sanctifieth and
[1:52:52] them that are sanctified are all of one.
[1:52:56] Have we been going through that
[1:52:57] scripture? And therefore he is not
[1:52:58] ashamed to call them brethren. Who are
[1:53:00] his brethren? The ones that are part of
[1:53:02] him. Right? Amen. Is that true?
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; So these are his brethren. So where are
[1:53:08] the brethren in this scene?
[1:53:10] We have Jesus on the throne. We have two
[1:53:14] groups separated out before him. One
[1:53:16] that did service unto him. He said,
[1:53:18] "When I was hungry, you fed me. When I
[1:53:20] was thirsty, you gave me drink. When I
[1:53:21] was in prison, you visited me." And
[1:53:23] there was another group here. He says,
[1:53:24] "When I was hungry, you did not give me
[1:53:26] any meat. When I was thirsty, you did
[1:53:28] not give me drink." And the first group
[1:53:30] says, Lord, when did we see you hungry
[1:53:32] and feed you?
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; He said, 'When you did this to these my
[1:53:36] brethren, where are these my brethren?
[1:53:38] They're those that are seated with him
[1:53:39] on his throne.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Cuz he said, you shall sit with me in my
[1:53:43] throne, and you shall judge the world.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; They're there with him on his throne.
[1:53:47] And he says, these are the brethren.
[1:53:49] When you did it unto them, you did it
[1:53:51] unto me because they are part of me. And
[1:53:53] they are part of Abraham's covenant. If
[1:53:54] you're part of Christ, then you are
[1:53:56] Abraham's seed. And whoever blesses you
[1:53:58] will be blessed. And whoever curses you
[1:54:00] will be cursed.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; And here at the white throne judgment,
[1:54:03] there are those given entrance into
[1:54:05] eternal life. Why? Because when you were
[1:54:07] on this earth and you were part of
[1:54:09] Christ, when they did it unto you, they
[1:54:11] did it unto him.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; So how should we live?
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; What kind of life should we live?
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:21] Let's look at this quote from the
[1:54:22] prophet. He said, "Now if we impute
[1:54:25] omniscience to God, we must also accept
[1:54:27] that he is perfect in wisdom and
[1:54:29] righteousness. This plan of election and
[1:54:32] reprobation is the wisdom of God
[1:54:33] revealed in all ages, even as it says in
[1:54:36] Ephesians 1 3-11." That's Ephesians 1,
[1:54:39] where he says that that we are saved by
[1:54:41] predestination and we are uh
[1:54:43] predestinated to the adoption of sons.
[1:54:46] He says this thus if God has so designed
[1:54:49] that there be those names those are
[1:54:52] there be those whose names are placed in
[1:54:54] a section of the lamb's book of life and
[1:54:56] cannot be erased for they are the names
[1:54:58] of his bride then we must accept that if
[1:55:01] it also states that there are those
[1:55:02] whose names we were placed in the record
[1:55:05] of the book of life but in the
[1:55:06] fornowledge of God there they were to
[1:55:08] fall and have their names removed we
[1:55:11] must accept that
[1:55:13] if there are those whose names were ever
[1:55:15] placed upon the record of life, we must
[1:55:17] accept that also. And if there are those
[1:55:19] who will enter into life eternal after
[1:55:21] the white throne judgment solely on the
[1:55:24] grounds of being good and kind and just
[1:55:25] to the elect of God, who are his
[1:55:27] brethren, then we cannot but accept
[1:55:29] that? For who knoweth the mind of the
[1:55:32] Lord that he should instruct him?
[1:55:34] Rather, let us be subject in faith to
[1:55:36] him who is our father and live.
[1:55:39] If there are those
[1:55:43] who will enter into life eternal
[1:55:47] after the white throne judgment solely
[1:55:49] on the grounds of being good and kind to
[1:55:51] the just to the elect of God who are his
[1:55:53] brethren then we cannot but accept that
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; why because they are part of Abraham's
[1:55:59] seed and they're part of the promise and
[1:56:01] the promise still stands true today
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; that God sent Abraham to be a blessing
[1:56:09] and go Abraham's seed is to be a
[1:56:11] blessing.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; I want to be a blessing.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Philippians 2 says that you may be
[1:56:19] blameless and harmless the sons of God
[1:56:21] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[1:56:24] and perverse nation among whom you shine
[1:56:27] as lights in the world. This is the way
[1:56:31] I want to live. I don't want to give
[1:56:33] anybody a reason to mock. I don't want
[1:56:35] to give anybody a reason to curse. I
[1:56:37] don't want to give anybody a reason to
[1:56:39] hate. Amen. I want to take the
[1:56:41] responsibility of the position God's
[1:56:42] given me. And I want to intercede. I
[1:56:44] want to pray for. I want to stand in the
[1:56:46] gap for I want to be life, light,
[1:56:50] healing, everything we're called to be.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; I want to be salt. Amen.
[1:56:57] Praise God. I want to read one more
[1:56:59] scripture
[1:57:01] in in 2 Thessalonians 2:7.
[1:57:04] The scripture says, "For the the mystery
[1:57:05] of iniquity doth already work. Only he
[1:57:08] who letth will let until he be taken out
[1:57:11] of the way." This word letth means to
[1:57:13] hold back or to detain, to restrain or
[1:57:16] to hinder. So the mystery of iniquity
[1:57:19] does already work. This is the
[1:57:20] antichrist spirit. Only he that now
[1:57:22] restrains or holds it back will hold it
[1:57:25] back until he be taken out of the way.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; So there's two he here. Yeah.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; There's there's a he right here and
[1:57:34] there's a he right here.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Now, he that leth or restrains or hold
[1:57:40] backs the antichrist spirit, he will
[1:57:42] restrain it until he be taken out of the
[1:57:45] way. So, the antichrist spirit is held
[1:57:48] back from unleashing on the earth. Amen.
[1:57:50] That this will when when when this that
[1:57:53] power that lets when he that leth with
[1:57:55] restrains and hold back is taken away.
[1:57:57] Amen. Then then what we'll see is a
[1:58:00] tribulation period break forth on the
[1:58:02] earth when the antichrist spirit bust
[1:58:03] out and the full power. But what's
[1:58:05] holding it back? He that restrains.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; There's a restraining force on the earth
[1:58:10] that's holding back the full power of
[1:58:12] the antichrist spirit. Amen. And holding
[1:58:14] open a door of redemption and holding
[1:58:16] open a door of mercy.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; But let's see what brother Benham said
[1:58:20] about this same scripture because he
[1:58:23] said, "For the mystery of iniquity doth
[1:58:25] already work." deceivers, you see,
[1:58:27] deceiving the people off into something.
[1:58:29] That's a spirit of iniquity. Only he,
[1:58:32] which is God, shall let or restrain
[1:58:36] until the church,
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; the bride,
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; be taken out of the way.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Who is the second? He early in his
[1:58:44] ministry, he says he, God, amen, shall
[1:58:47] restrain until he, the Holy Ghost, be
[1:58:49] taken out of the way. Absolutely. That's
[1:58:51] what it is. It's God. Amen. But where is
[1:58:54] the Holy Ghost?
[1:58:56] The Holy Ghost dwells in God's people.
[1:58:58] It dwells in the bride of Christ. AMEN.
[1:59:00] AND WHEN THE BRIDE IS RAPTURED, AMEN,
[1:59:02] THE THE Holy Ghost lifts. And the only
[1:59:04] place that there's light anymore, amen,
[1:59:06] is in Jerusalem, in Israel with the two
[1:59:09] witnesses that are bringing back the
[1:59:10] 144,000. Everywhere else goes IN
[1:59:12] ABSOLUTE DARKNESS. WHY? BECAUSE YE ARE
[1:59:14] THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. YOU ARE THE
[1:59:16] SALT. AND WHEN HE TAKES you away,
[1:59:18] THERE'S NO MORE LIGHT FOR THE GENTILES.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO MORE SALT. THERE'S NO MORE
[1:59:22] CONTACT. THERE'S NOTHING. AMEN. SO, WHAT
[1:59:24] ARE YOU HERE FOR? YOU'RE A BLESSING.
[1:59:27] AMEN. YOU'RE A LIGHT AND YOU'RE A SALT
[1:59:29] AND YOU YOUR PRESENCE, THE HOLY GHOST IN
[1:59:31] YOU IS HOLDING BACK THE FORCES OF
[1:59:33] DARKNESS AND KEEPING THE DOOR OPEN FOR
[1:59:35] MERCY JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; DON'T BEGRUDGE BEING HERE. DON'T HATE
[1:59:41] YOUR LIFE. DON'T WISH YOU COULD GET OUT
[1:59:42] OF HERE. LET'S JUST HOPE THE RAPTURE
[1:59:44] COULD HAPPEN TOMORROW. IF I COULD STAY
[1:59:46] ONE MORE DAY AND ONE MORE PERSON can
[1:59:48] receive a blessing AT WHITE THRONE
[1:59:49] JUDGMENT. LET MY LIFE BE A BLESSING
[1:59:51] ACCORDING TO THE PROMISE OF ABRAHAM. AS
[1:59:54] LONG AS THERE'S ABRAHAM'S SEED ON THIS
[1:59:55] EARTH, THERE'S A BLESSING ON THIS EARTH.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN ABRAHAM'S SPIRITUAL SEED, THE
[2:00:02] GENTILES, LIFT OFF, HE TURNS BACK TO THE
[2:00:04] NATURAL SEED TO THE 144,000. AND THAT
[2:00:07] will be the only place of light
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; and the only place of blessing
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; and it won't be anywhere else.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:17] God told Abraham, "You'll be a
[2:00:20] blessing."
[2:00:22] If you're part of Abraham's seed, you're
[2:00:25] here to be a blessing. Be a blessing to
[2:00:28] your family. Be a blessing to your
[2:00:30] co-workers. Be a blessing to your to
[2:00:32] your neighbors. Be a blessing to
[2:00:34] everybody you can be a blessing to.
[2:00:36] Because if they bless me, they're
[2:00:38] blessed. So if I bless them, maybe they
[2:00:40] want to bless me. And if they bless me,
[2:00:41] they'll be blessed.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:00:44] If I can be a good neighbor and a good
[2:00:46] employee and a good family, if I can be
[2:00:48] whatever that I can be to them, I'm not
[2:00:51] here for darkness. I'm here for light.
[2:00:53] I'm here for preservation. I'm here for
[2:00:55] life. I'm here for contact with God.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; At the white throne judgment
[2:01:05] when we saw the scene in Matthew 25 when
[2:01:08] he says, "You fed me and I was hungry."
[2:01:13] because of that enter you into the joys
[2:01:15] of the Lord because of that.
[2:01:18] And they said, 'Lord, when did we feed
[2:01:20] you? When did we visit you? When did we
[2:01:22] do this good deed to you? So, when you
[2:01:25] did it to my brethren,
[2:01:27] you did it to me.
[2:01:31] What will it feel like that day when you
[2:01:34] see life go to somebody and you know
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; it was because they did it to Christ in
[2:01:38] you?
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Because I was their neighbor. I was
[2:01:41] their coworker. I was their friend. I
[2:01:43] was their brother. I was their sister.
[2:01:47] It's not what they did to me. It's what
[2:01:48] they did to Christ who dwells in me.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Because you fed me." It's
[2:01:52] not my flesh, friend, but it's the
[2:01:54] promise I'm under.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; By by Christ, I've been included in this
[2:01:59] promise. In him, I'm part of Abraham's
[2:02:01] seed. Through him and by him, I'm part
[2:02:03] of that promise. And that promise is
[2:02:05] still in effect today. Yeah.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; If we will overcome the gates of the
[2:02:10] enemy, then we'll still be a blessing.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; If part of it applies, it all applies.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; And I said, God, make me a blessing.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; And he that now leth God, he God letth
[2:02:26] will let until he,
[2:02:28] the second he, the Holy Ghost that's in
[2:02:31] the bride, be taken out of the way.
[2:02:36] Let's be here.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Let's not hate being here.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; As our life get difficult, some days are
[2:02:43] harder than others.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Sometimes are difficult. But we live
[2:02:48] with a purpose on our life. And our
[2:02:49] purpose and our promise is I will make
[2:02:52] you a blessing.
[2:02:55] And I will bless you and I will make you
[2:02:58] a blessing. And I will bless your seed
[2:02:59] after you. And all that bless you will
[2:03:03] be blessed. and all that curse, you will
[2:03:04] be cursed and I will give you this
[2:03:07] inheritance.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm part of that.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm on this earth to be a
[2:03:12] blessing. And I say, God, help me to be
[2:03:15] a blessing.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Help me. Help me to learn what Abraham
[2:03:21] learned in his dealings with the
[2:03:22] Beimilec and learn what Lot learned in
[2:03:25] his dealings with his friends. Help me
[2:03:27] to come to humility and realize that oh
[2:03:30] God I have to be careful.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Help me Lord to be careful.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Peter says, "But ye are a chosen
[2:03:40] generation,
[2:03:42] a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a
[2:03:46] peculiar people."
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; See, listen. We never called ourselves
[2:03:50] any of this.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; This is what God called us. that you
[2:03:55] should show forth the praises of him who
[2:03:57] hath called you out of darkness into his
[2:04:00] marvelous light.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Then Ephesians 5:8 says, "For you were
[2:04:05] sometimes darkness, but now are you
[2:04:08] light in the Lord. Walk as children of
[2:04:11] the light." So God help us to walk as
[2:04:14] children of the light. Amen. God bless
[2:04:17] you. Let's all stand.
[2:04:20] Amen. Let's just ask God for his
[2:04:23] blessings. musicians, if you'll please
[2:04:25] come. Dear heavenly father, I'm so
[2:04:28] thankful, God, for your word.
[2:04:31] And God, how real it is to us, Lord.
[2:04:35] God, for years, we hear these
[2:04:38] scriptures, we read them, we talk about
[2:04:39] them, we've heard them preached and
[2:04:41] mentioned, we've gotten excited about
[2:04:43] them, Lord, and we've rejoiced in the
[2:04:45] blessings you bestowed upon us and the
[2:04:47] promise you've given us. But Lord, I
[2:04:50] myself haven't always seen the
[2:04:52] significance and the consequences for
[2:04:54] these things. Not just for myself, but
[2:04:57] also for others, Lord.
[2:04:59] And God, if we are a peculiar people, if
[2:05:03] we are a holy nation, you've called us
[2:05:05] to a position, Lord. And because of
[2:05:08] that, there's still, Lord, opportunities
[2:05:11] to be a blessing.
[2:05:13] God, help us to be a blessing wherever
[2:05:16] we go and whatever we do. Lord, may you
[2:05:19] shine your light through us. May we not
[2:05:21] bring darkness. May we bring light,
[2:05:24] Lord. May we be the salt of the earth as
[2:05:26] you promised, Lord. Not a salt that
[2:05:29] loses its testimony, becomes
[2:05:31] indifferent, becomes grumpy, withdrawn,
[2:05:35] but may we be that salt that has a salty
[2:05:37] testimony, that can have impact on
[2:05:40] others, that can make contact like your
[2:05:42] prophet said. And may you live through
[2:05:45] us and touch through us and work through
[2:05:47] us and reach out to others through us.
[2:05:49] For Lord, while this door is open, while
[2:05:52] you who letth will let before you take
[2:05:56] yourself out of the way when you lift
[2:05:57] your bride up, may you reach out to
[2:06:00] others and be a blessing. And may others
[2:06:02] be blessed because they bless. And God,
[2:06:05] prevent us, Lord, from doing anything
[2:06:08] like Abraham did or Job or anyone else
[2:06:11] or Jacob that would cause somebody to
[2:06:13] curse. For God, if we've done that, if
[2:06:16] we've done something that caused
[2:06:17] somebody else
[2:06:20] to be angry with us and blaspheme or
[2:06:23] curse or God, we're sorry.
[2:06:27] And God, I want to stand in the gap for
[2:06:29] those, Lord, that have reacted to me
[2:06:33] because of my actions.
[2:06:35] Lord, I want to say, please forgive
[2:06:37] them. Lord, it's not their fault.
[2:06:40] God, I pray that you who have accounted
[2:06:42] righteousness unto me, I'm so unworthy
[2:06:45] of it, Lord. It's not because of my good
[2:06:47] deeds, but it's because of all that
[2:06:49] you've done for me by grace.
[2:06:52] And God, I pray you would take their
[2:06:54] error and put it on my account.
[2:06:57] and forgive them for my sake, Lord.
[2:07:01] God know there's so many times, Lord, in
[2:07:03] the past that I've been rough. Even in
[2:07:06] witnessing, Lord, I've been so hard and
[2:07:08] so rough and caused people to say things
[2:07:11] they shouldn't have said.
[2:07:13] But God, they may not have ever said it
[2:07:15] if it wasn't for me.
[2:07:18] People have taken actions that they
[2:07:19] shouldn't have taken. But Lord, you
[2:07:22] know, you know all things. You are just
[2:07:25] and you are good and you you understand.
[2:07:29] And Lord, in the light of these truths
[2:07:31] and the things that we see, I pray God
[2:07:34] that you would accept us and you would
[2:07:37] forgive those who we forgive.
[2:07:40] That you would let them go free and give
[2:07:41] them another opportunity, Lord, to enter
[2:07:44] into life.
[2:07:46] For God, we desire to be the blessing
[2:07:48] you've promised Abraham would be. We
[2:07:51] don't want to be a curse. We don't want
[2:07:52] to be darkness. We don't want to be
[2:07:53] condemnation for anyone.
[2:07:56] But God, my desire is to be a blessing
[2:07:58] and be light and be life and be salt.
[2:08:02] God, help me guard my tongue, my
[2:08:04] actions. Let everything I do be a
[2:08:07] reflection of you, your goodness, your
[2:08:09] holiness, your truth, your life.
[2:08:13] And God, I pray that we would no longer
[2:08:15] step forward rough,
[2:08:18] abusive, and angry, and short-tempered,
[2:08:21] and sharp tonged.
[2:08:24] God, that we wouldn't do things that
[2:08:26] trigger an evil response.
[2:08:29] But God, may we begin to do things that
[2:08:31] res people respond to in love, that
[2:08:34] triggers a response of love and
[2:08:36] appreciation and admiration,
[2:08:39] for then your blessings can abide and
[2:08:41] remain.
[2:08:43] have your way with each one of us, Lord,
[2:08:44] as we humble ourselves before you and
[2:08:47] repent, Lord, of our pride and
[2:08:49] indifference, Lord. Please forgive us.
[2:08:52] But help us to move forward from this
[2:08:54] day forward with our eyes wide open,
[2:08:55] with a better understanding, with a
[2:08:58] greater purpose and vision and goal for
[2:09:00] our lives.
[2:09:02] And as long as you leave us in this
[2:09:03] world, may we be a blessing, a blessing
[2:09:07] unto all we come in contact with, a
[2:09:09] blessing to all nations. May we be the
[2:09:12] blessing, Lord. I love you. I ask for
[2:09:14] your forgiveness, Lord. And may you
[2:09:16] touch all of those who we touch and who
[2:09:19] we forgive. May you forgive them, Lord.
[2:09:22] We ask it in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:09:25] Amen.
[2:09:26] Amen. God bless you. I just want to
[2:09:28] remind you, we have the communion
[2:09:29] service, communion and feet washing at
[2:09:31] 4:00. Brother John,
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; just to be a blessing,
[2:09:41] I'd go on a journey.

[2:09:52] and cross the deep blue sea.
[2:09:58] Leave home and family.
[2:10:02] I'll go where the spirit leads me.

[2:10:38] blue sea.

[2:10:45] Go where the sea leaves me.
[2:10:50] I'm giving my life away
[2:10:56] just to be a blessing.
[2:11:00] Oh, once more. Just to be a blessing.

[2:11:12] Climb the highest mountain
[2:11:17] and cross the deep. will see
[2:11:23] people and family.
[2:11:27] Don't know where the spirit leads me.
[2:11:33] I'm giving my life away
[2:11:38] just to be a blessing.

[2:11:48] beautiful
[2:11:50] light.
