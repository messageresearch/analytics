we pray as we pray [Applause] into [Music] man let's take our bibles while we're standing and turn to first corinthians chapter 14. brother franco i just put a flash drive in there i have a powerpoint i didn't tell you about brother and it's the only one on the route there so i'll be able to pull it up and i forgot to put a title page on it too so we'll just come up to our first scripture while we're standing let's pull up first corinthians chapter 14. in verse 8. for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to battle for if the trumpet given uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to battle and i'd like to talk about the invisible final battle if we could this morning and let's just bow our heads and pray and ask the lord's blessing lord jesus we thank you for your word lord we ask god that you would take this word and you would anoint it lord that you would break it yourself lord and feed it to us from your own hand lord that you would move the man out of the way lord in any mental faculty that would be there that you would just take over lord by your holy spirit and you would operate through a gift if you placed in a vessel and god give us all ears to hear in our heart to perceive all that you would say to us today maybe gain strength more and may we be more fit for service we ask that you would have preeminence and take charge of everything that's said and done that you would drive out every spirit that would try to hinder we ask it in jesus christ's name amen you can all have your seats i want to read a couple other scriptures before we go to the powerpoint let's turn to revelation chapter 4. revelation chapter 4 and we'll begin at verse 1. we know in revelation chapter 4 john is the type of the church he's coming out of the church ages he just went through laodicea and now he's going to begin this statement in revelation chapter 4 with after this after he'd come through laodicea he says after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show these things things which must be hereafter amen so we know if a trumpet gives an uncertain sound who can prepare for war because the trumpet brother bam tells us a trumpet blast is a calling forth as an gathering and a calling to war amen we'll get to that in a minute and so if trump gives a certain sound how can one prepare for war if we don't know what the trumpet sound means amen and here we see a door open in heaven and the voice of a trumpet saying come up hither what's he doing he's gathering for war amen let's look at revelation 19. revelation 19. and verse 11 revelation 19 and 11. and i saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him now see there again heavens opened again so there's a reason heaven's open amen the the this this is significant that john when he comes out of the uh when he comes out of the church ages he sees a door open in heaven he sees an opening in heaven and a trumpet saying come up here and i'll show you these things that shall be hereafter amen and so john goes up and and john goes and he sees the revelation of one god on the throne the book in his hand the lamb taking the book the opening of the seals and all these things but now we come to revelation 19 and we see that heaven's opened amen and it's significant to know that heavens open and when heaven became open and i and i saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he does judge and make war so this is all about trumpets heaven opening and war these are all going together and judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with the vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed and find linen white and clean and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of wrath of almighty god and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords amen we know this passage of scripture quite well and i want to take a look at this amen and i'll just tell you what i'm looking at right now and just share with you what i'm seeing and i hope you'll just give me that liberty to share with you what i'm seeing because what we see is constantly growing it's evolving we're seeing it more clearly all the time as god gives us more revelation on the message and we see it i mean we've seen it before but now god keeps dialing it in and it's getting clear and clear and clear and clear and as god does it i just want to share with you what i'm seeing and what i'm seeing is that there's a spiritual aspect to the battle of armageddon and i'm not denying anything about the physical there's and there's no when i say that i'd no ways am i taking one or the other amen because we know that the principles in god are true that he does things both spiritually and naturally the word of god and prophecies and such have a spiritual fulfillment and a natural fulfillment amen so so when i say that i'm looking at a spiritual fulfillment of the battle of armageddon the final battle the invisible battle i'm not denying that there won't be a gathering in israel and there won't be a destruction of the armies there and the physical means i believe that with all my heart but i believe god works spiritually and naturally and i want to lay that foundation now right now through this powerpoint i if you'll just give me a minute and be patient i want to go through several scriptures and i just want to show what i'm looking at here in the fact that that god the invisible is more real than the visible and we're trained all our lives opposite of that like everything in us as human beings with with a a carnal spirit of the world with a with this body that we have growing up amen we start to we start to value the tangible and the scene and that becomes real to us like we'll say this desk is real this this suit is real and all this is real but i'd like to venture to say that this is not real this is a reflection of the real amen but there's another more real if i could say it that way or a really real amen but this life is the vapor this is the mist this is the negative that's the positive amen all these things that brother branham told us in the scripture says that we we have to realize that the unseen is more real than the scene amen then if we could bring up the powerpoint and if we look at hebrews 11 1-3 it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report though through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so god in the beginning brother venom tells us that god had faith in his own word and god would speak his word and he would make the things that we now see out of things that do not appear so we didn't take substance that we see and and create and frame the world he took something that we have not seen and he made the world with it so what's more real what's more real is it the world that we see or the unseen material that he made it out of what is the greater reality what has a stronger what is a stronger substance amen what is it and without faith we can never see this other dimension this other world this other reality because it says by faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen the only evidence you have the only substance you have of whatever it is that god made this world out of the only connection you have to that is faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen amen because you're not going to find any evidence here your evidence will be your faith through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear praise be to god ii corinthians 4 while we look not on the things which are seen but of the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal same principle so uh we'll just we're just going to keep going i don't want to do too much explaining brother ben says in supersense cast down the reasonings of these senses believe the supersense the sense of faith that jesus christ gives by that same sense god spoke when there was nothing what is that sense the supersense is god the faith of god in you amen this is the same faith god had the faith of god in you the part of god that comes into you gives you the super sense by that same super sense god framed the world together with things which was not and did not appear he spoke his word and believed his word and the world shook into existence so the faith of god friends the faith of god was to speak when there was nothing to be seen and to believe the spoken word that come from the mouth of god amen and that faith in that that's the faith of god to believe before the manifestation to believe amen to believe while we're waiting for the manifestation to believe before what's spoken moves into the manifestation he said let there be light and he said it may have been it may have been millions of years it may have been how many ever years before that the light appeared on the earth amen but god spoke it he didn't second guess it he believed it and he sat there and he let the word do the work but he was real to him it was tangible he knew that when he said it it would happen he didn't have to see something to believe it he believed it and that's the faith of god that comes into us the supersense to be able to believe in things that we do not see this is an important principle without this amen we're just going to fall flat and never get anywhere in the kingdom of god and we'll never understand the message if we need things that are tangible visible evidences scientific proofs uh uh things that you can you can you can write down and see and prove you'll never believe the message hebrews 11 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet mood with fear prepared an ark this is the faith of god god said it noah believed it and he put his whole life into working for it all of his reputation his resources everything went to preparing an ark why because he believed in things that had not yet appeared that he did not yet see but god told him amen romans 4 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were abraham had this same faith that noah had the same faith that god had to where he could call the things which are not as though they were and the bride has the same faith by the new birth amen the bride has the same faith by the quickening of the seats she has the faith of god to be able to declare things that are not seen but they are real calleth those things which be not as though they were i wanna just keep going through scripture i put this on the powerpoint so i could go fast so we don't have to do a lot of flipping because i'm just laying a foundation genesis 17 1 and when abram was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make my covenant between me and thee and i will multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name any born be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee and i will make the exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee unto thy seed after thee and i will give unto thee unto thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god and god said unto abram thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations this is my covenant which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you i read this and there's a there's a deliberate reason because now when god's giving the promise to abraham he's coming down and he's changing him from abram to abraham and he's he's confirming the covenant with him and he's given him this promise and the promise is i will be with thee and with thy seed after thee and i will i will make you exceedingly fruitful there'll be many that come from you and he says i will give you this land amen and as a seal as a token as an evidence of this circumcision i give you as a token of this a covenant i give you the seal of circumcision but we know that we are children of abraham and part of this seed is that true we are part of this seed so there's a there's a natural seed of abraham but there's a spiritual seed of abraham and there's there's applications in the promises for both because the the natural seed of abraham would take a natural piece of real estate and they would get a natural token a natural seal of the covenant which would be a natural circumcision things that they could touch and stand on they could stand on the promise they could possess the promise i mean they could physically see the evidence of the token which was circumcision but that promise wasn't just for the natural this promise to abraham was also spiritual to the faith seed of abraham who would also get a land would get an inheritance which is the word they would also get a token a ceiling of their covenant which would be the baptism of the holy ghost and when it come to the faith seed to the spiritual seed of abraham they wouldn't have anything tangible to stand on to hold on to possess or anything physical to look at to see the evidence of the token what they would have would be a spiritual reality of this natural type and this is the gentile way this is clearly the gentile way the gentile way is how to have the faith of god amen to be able to declare things that are not yet seen to be able to declare the spiritual reality though there's no physical evidence as a way of a token amen if you say i have the token the baptism the holy ghost i say show it to me amen an israelite could show you physically on his body amen that he was under circumcision amen but we come under circumcision which is the circumcision of the heart amen and it's deep on the inside and it's not something you could show to somebody it has a manifestation absolutely the manifestation is a changed life and obedience to the word but the physical mark the physical cutting away of the fleshly heart you can't show it it's a spiritual reality and like i said this is the face seat of abraham and this is the gentile way and don't forget we're gentiles seed of abraham royal seed of abraham galatians 3 28 there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you're all one in christ jesus and if you're a christ and you're abraham's seed in air according to the promise you're heir to everything that we just read in genesis that abraham would give but how am i heir to it go go over to canaan i mean go over to palestine now and take you a piece of land show me the seal of your of your of your of your token and your circumcision you see it's not we're heirs of the promise amen but the to us they're the spiritual realities that the natural things were typing they were showing in a natural way foreshadowing what was coming foreshadowing what was the spiritual reality for us we are abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise romans 2 for he is not jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh but he is a jew which is one inwardly in circumcision as that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not a men but of god he's telling his circumcision is not the natural circumcision the circumcision is the circumcision of the heart and paul now the apostle paul is coming here amen and he's the light and to the gentiles he's he's the he's the uh the prophet of the first church age the first church age messenger he's here to bring the gospel truth the new and living way to the gentiles and when he brings it to the gentiles he brings it as a spiritual reality in a spiritual fulfillment of the natural that was to the jews the natural to israel and so we want to we want to know these things i know we know these things but i just want to review these things so that we know them because in in paul's day these were humongous statements like now when we when we look at this amen and we're like yeah of course obviously but when paul was making this statement when he would go into the synagogue and then he would begin to say this amen they they i would they would they were blowing gaskets there was fuses circuits were melting down because how can you do away with circumcision circumcision is our our mark it's our token it's our seal the covenant and if i'm circumcised and i'm a seed of abraham i'm part of that promise and he's saying no no no that was only a shadow of what's coming now and what's coming now is a spiritual reality to be an heir of all things i mean that god to be your father amen to possess his word amen to receive the word as your possession amen and their token is the circumcision of the heart amen and they were having a meltdown because they had the natural the natural the natural and we're holding on to the natural and he was telling them that if you want to move further you have to let go of the natural and take take a hold of the spiritual and who was saying that the apostle paul who is spiritualizing the word the apostle paul who is he spiritualizing it for the gentiles praise god hebrews 12 apostle paul again if you're not coming to the mount that might be touched that burn with fire nor into blackness and darkness and tempest he's saying you're not coming to mount sinai we're not going back to the physical mountain that you can touch and the fire that you can see and the blackness and the burning and the shaking the earthquake you're not coming to that because you you are now uh royal seed face seed spiritual seed of abraham you're coming to something that's more real than mount sinai you're not coming to the blackness and darkness and tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they heard and treated and the words should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it should be stoned or thrust through with a dart so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake but you are coming to mount zion unto the city of the living god paul is saying we're not going back to the wilderness i'm not taking you back there but we're moving forward and you've come to mount zion where where where did we come to mount zion when did we walk up to it when do we scale the mountain wherever you were amen wherever the gentiles were whether it was in rome or asia minor or wherever he was amen they had come to mount zion because it was not a physical location on the earth amen it was a position in christ it was a spiritual reality they were coming to mount zion they were coming amen they were coming to mount zion unto the city of the living god amen they had come to the city of the living god and they were in corinth and they were in athens and they were i mean they were in laodicea and they were wherever they were they were coming to the city of god and then they were walking through a physical city in asia minor they were walking through a physical city in the south of europe they were walking through a physical place in syria and then as they were walking in antioch amenity says you've not come to antioch your physical being is an antioch but you have come into the city of god and there was believers in that day that believed paul and said i have come to mount zion and i am in the city of god and there is nothing that they could see touch no headquarters to go to no place that they could say now this is the city i'll go in there and this is the mountain i'll climb up there only faith will put you on that mountain and only faith will put you in that city to realize it's a reality the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem into an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly in the church of the firstborn which is written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator the new covenant to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel all of these things paul is presenting as spiritual realities that they have come to now not in the future but now you've come to this mountain you've come to this city you've come to the sprinkling of blood you've come to an innumerable company of angels you're surrounded by angels you've come to the general assembly in church of the firstborn amen you've come to the uh to the judge of all and the spirits of just men made perfect you've come to this you're in this place you're caught up in heavenly places in christ jesus and you don't even know it you don't even realize it but there was people there with faith that said i believe what he's saying that's the truth something in me resonates and said that's my position that's where i'm at that's where i belong and see paul was not paul was not pointing to a location and telling them how to get there he was not telling them to strive for this place he was telling them you've come to this place if you've come in christ amen christ is in you and you're a christ you're in this place this is the reality of where you've come this is your position and there's nothing they could see touch feel smell here it was all spiritual realities apostle paul again in ephesians 6 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and the power of his might put on the whole armor of god and we're going to we're going to labor on this for a minute before i get to this i want to back them and just show paul was the one who told us that the tabernacle in the wilderness was a shadow of a real one that's why amen that's why when they would be cast out of the temple or the temple would fall flat it wasn't a problem amen because that one was only showing the real one it was a shadow and if the shadow would collapse it's no problem because by faith it entered into the real one because christ had went behind the veil and they are seated in heavenly places in christ jesus behind the veil so if the one on earth would collapse to the christians amen it was okay amen because that that was only showing a reflection of that one there but by faith when christ entered in behind that veil if i'm a part of christ i entered behind that veil and i have access to the throne of god i no longer need to come to this access point here that accessed that point because by christ christ i went behind the veil direct access to the throne of god and what a spiritual reality no more a form of going and taking a a offering and a priest there who would slay it and a blood on a physical altar and carrying it in amen to the holy place and the lighting of candles all of that was showing amen what was the reality and this is the shadow until christ opened up the way into the reality the only way to touch the reality was through the shadow but when god opened up the way to the reality he could do away with the shadow amen and the temple was was was rendered flat and then decimated because god didn't need it for his children anymore to contact him they could contact directly through christ spiritual realities when the temple fell it was a mourning through israel it was devastation but for the christians there was something greater that had opened up a greater reality not that they could see it not that they could touch it not that they could take anybody to it and say here's the way here's the temple see it do you see this just walk this way it was all revealed it was all by faith now paul comes and he he tells us also the law was a shadow the temple was a shadow the law was a shadow the feast days and new moons and sabbath they were a shadow and when paul's paul was directing them away from the feast days away from amen keeping of the ordinances for a way to meet god but now he's saying that law was a shadow of things to come those feast days and new moons and holy days all they were was a shadow of things to come now we've moved into the reality of those things and that's why the jews wanted to stone paul and had to kill him because paul amen they saw paul as destroying the law of moses they saw paul as a perverter of the law of moses and they didn't realize by holding on to the tangible they were the perverter of the law of moses this is a principle amen this is a key to understanding amen by by holding on by holding on to that old way amen and preventing people from coming to the new and living way they were perverting the law of moses because the law of moses was to bring them to christ and now all of those things that the jews had that were tangible they could see and touch and feel now those were no longer necessary because now by the way of faith they can move to the real things not the shadows see that's so sometimes so awkward to say as a human being that that i we no longer need we don't no longer need sticks and stones and building materials we don't need this stuff anymore now we can move to the real stuff what real stuff show it to me i can't show it to me where is it it's here where is it at it's here where are you and seated in heavenly places in christ jesus but you're standing there no i'm seated in heavenly places in christ jesus well where is christ he's well he's in me but you said you were there seated with him and he's in me it's all the same thing friends it's the reality it's all around us amen christ has come to unite with his bride they have become one where he is she is amen where she is he is and it's not we don't measure it anymore by time and space and distance and all the things on this earth that we measure things by it's not first and next and last and then and before it's all eternity it's moved into the eternity it's not here and there it's not now here and then there amen christ in his bride is united but the uniting of the word is united christ and his bride together they're becoming one whatever she is he is whatever he is she is but you can't see it it's like the wind you can see the effect of it but you can't see it you can see the effect of that union in people's lives but you can't see it you can only see it by faith by faith is what makes it a reality this is god's plan for making sure that it only goes to the seed that not everybody picks it up because it it can't be intellectually acquired because it defies our intellect now paul is telling us how to be a soldier and we're going to talk about the the final invisible battle now let's talk about being this soldier a gentile soldier a warrior he said put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore taken to you the hormone of god so he's making it really clear that you're not fighting anything physical on this earth you're not fighting a government a law you're not fighting anything physical in this earth you are not you we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and high places that word means heavenly spiritual wickedness in heavenly places amen and so now we are not fighting an earthly battle the battle is on earth in us but it's not an earthly battle it's a heavenly battle with heavenly forces but the battle is taking place in the mind of man but it's still a heavenly battle we're not warring against flesh and blood i'll put it this way the only flesh and blood that you're fighting is yours don't fight in the other the only flesh and blood you that you wrestle with is the one that you look at in the mirror every morning after that there's no more wrestling with flesh and blood it's all spiritual now that spiritual may have manifestations amen you may see the effect of the spiritual all around you may come as a sickness it may come as somebody shouting angry curse words at you that's the manifestation but it's not that flesh and blood it's the spirit that's behind it that we're at war with you understand it may be governments that change laws amen that put restrictions and make things difficult amen but that's not the force we're fighting amen we're fighting the force that's beyond that because we have no power in the flesh to overcome those forces tell me what you're going to do against the government tell me what you're going to do when they knock on your door and they show up and man what if a tank pulls up your driveway what are you going to do what are you going to do roll up your sleeves if we fight flesh and blood we're going to lose and when we realize no no there's something in me that's eternal there's something in me that's been quickened by the spirit of god amen that's heavenly that's in a heavenly dimension that has access to the throne of god there's more to me than the flesh and blood so i'm going to drop the flesh and blood and not fight flesh and blood with flesh and blood amen but i'm going to take this to a higher level because when we go to a higher level i have a different authority altogether i have a different position and a different power because what's been given to me amen by my lord amen has been given to me authority over scorpions and serpents and all the power of the devil so if we keep it in flesh and blood we lose if we make it about our spouse and we make it about we make it about these symptoms and we make it about this employer or this this this government power whatever if you make it about that you will lose but if you go to the next level higher and you say this is not about the symptom it's about the devil that's creating the symptom this is not about the angry neighbors about the devil that's influencing him it's not about the government about the devil that's in control and i'm going to resist that devil and not resist that flesh this is how this is how the saints of god fight you have to know who your enemy is where your enemy is and stop beating the air fight the good fight of faith according to the word verse 13 says wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins girded about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching their there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints now we've got the armor but if you look the armor does nothing to protect your flesh this armor that we've been given is not a fleshly battle we don't war against flesh and blood it's not a fleshly battle there may be a manifestation in the flesh but the battle is in heavenly places with principalities and powers rulers of darkness and so when we when we drop down to the flesh and carnal understanding we dropped back to the revelation of the jews who wanted to make jesus as a king and throw out the romans and fight the flesh but jesus says my kingdom is not of this world in my kingdom of this world my subjects would fight but there's a different kingdom that he's interested in so now we look at the the weapons of our warfare we look at the armament that we're given the only offensive weapon we're given is the word amen and the defensive weapon are all defenses and spiritual realms it's not physical these things do not protect our physical body and man they protect you spiritually the helmet of salvation amen lauren's great about with truth breastplate of righteousness amen quenching all the fiery darts of the enemy this is not about flesh and blood it's not about protecting our flesh it doesn't mean that we're never going to have trials in the flesh or difficulties in the flesh amen but the armament wasn't given to you to protect your flesh the armament was given to you to win a spiritual war to fight principalities and powers in heavenly places so we want to understand these things modern events make clear by prophecy the prophet of god said there's not one thing that the christian has in his army that's scientific did you know that love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience faith holy ghost everything is unseen by science and that's the only thing that's real and lasting everything you look at come from the earth and goes back to the earth but the things that you can't see with your eye but see it declare itself that's the world of the eternal praise be to god that's the world of the eternal jesus says my kingdom is not of this world i just quoted this if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence so he's telling us even we're not fighting they weren't fighting to deliver jesus jesus wasn't delivered into the hands of man jesus was delivered into the hands of god jesus knew he jesus knew he could send legions of angels and deliver me he knew he could be delivered he knew amen he knew that that pilate had no authority over him other than what was given of his father so jesus was not caught up in the trial he was not caught up in defending himself and answering their questions or debating he knew what the will of god was the will of god was for him to surrender and go to the cross amen he you you think that jesus did not have the wisdom amen to take those lying witnesses whose testimonies could not uh could not even align do you think jesus didn't have the wisdom and ability to unravel that whole trial you think he couldn't have quoted the law like he did every other time and and leave them dumbfounded without an answer and they stopped asking him questions because he'd always go to the word go to the word go to the word and absolutely destroy their argument do you think he couldn't have unraveled amen that that mock trial he could have unraveled it amen but he wasn't fighting a flesh and blood war this had nothing to do with that this was all a manifestation of something that was going on in a higher realm and god had called him to submit to that amen and all those forces were working against him and he wasn't trying to free himself from calvary he wasn't trying to protect his flesh he was winning a battle he was winning a war he was defeating his enemy but it but it wasn't flesh he was surrendering the flesh so that he could win so we got to get caught up that we don't fight the wrong battles second corinthians 10 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds amen now that's my foundation are we on the foundation together and we're on the foundation we realize that the spiritual realities that are given by faith are the real substance the invisible warfare is the real warfare the the the promises that are given to us are not things that are visible or tangible they're things that are only tangible by faith faith is the substance faith is the evidence and so now i want to move forward in into this with that understanding in the first seal brother brahma he said here's the plan of it we spoke with this a couple sundays ago the first thing happens there is an announcement in the heavens first what happened a seal is opened what is that a mystery is unfolded and when a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sounds it declares a war or a plague falls and a church age opens what is the war part the angel of the church catches the mystery of god not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery of god and then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him goes forth to the people what does he do out there he begins to proclaim that message and what does it start a war a spiritual war so brother man was referring to the church ages in every church age amen there was a sounding of a trumpet what was the sounding of a trumpet it would come after the breaking of a seal a revelation from god would be given to a church age messenger that messenger receive it when he begins to bring it to the people he is blowing a trumpet the trumpet does two things it gathers the people to the trumpet and declares war so it's a gathering together of the soldiers that can hear the trumpet and the trumpet doesn't give an uncertain sound because if it gives an uncertain sound how can one prepare for the battle so this trumpet gives a certain sound it's a certain revelation a certain truth amen that's proclaiming and the spiritual war starts over that part of the word and the devil now comes along and he's trying to discredit that truth he's trying to discredit that part of the word he's trying to discredit that word and when he cannot discredit that word he begins to try to destroy the vessels that are carrying the word and if we watch this from church age to church age to church age amen and then when there was laws that would begin to protect the the the individuals carrying the truth from being persecuted and stoned and killed then they would begin to destroy their character or their reputation so that nobody would listen to them it's the same thing it happens over and over and over again through the church ages and now what he's doing he's taking that truth that spiritually revealed truth a seal is open in that age and he takes that truth and declare it is the sounding of a trumpet calling the soldiers to spiritual war amen and the sounding of the trumpet they gather together they begin to proclaim the truth and the enemy starts to fight that truth because that truth is a threat to his kingdom his kingdom is set upon the earth based on deception so truth is always a threat to his kingdom because the foundation of his kingdom is deception the only way that he got squatter rights to sit on the earth as god of this world of god of this evil age and god of this world is because of deception he deceived eve and she was trapped into it so the foundation of his kingdom is deception and truth truth makes him vulnerable the truth is a threat to satan's kingdom so that's why when the truth comes out it always starts spiritual war this has nothing to do with nationalities it has nothing to do with personality type it is all has to do with the spiritual revealed word praise god it goes forth to people it starts a war a spiritual war and then god takes his messenger with the elect of that age and lays them asleep and then he drops a plague upon them who rejects it a temporary judgment then after that is over then he goes on and they denominate and bring in the denominations and start off with that man's work like of wesley and all the rest of them and then it gets all scrappled again and then another mystery comes forth then what happens another messenger arrives on earth for a church hc then when he arrives the trumpet sounds he declares war and and then what happens finally then he's caught away and then he's laid away then plagues fall destroys them spiritual listen oh my goodness spiritual death hits the church and she's gone that group then he goes on to another one the plague follows a temporary judgment but then when it happens spiritual death hits that church that group and he moves to another one so what is following you have a revealing of truth a breaking of a seal a messenger will sound the trumpet it will gather the elect to that truth gather the army and i'll say it like this and just listen to me and just love me anyway when he blows that trumpet he gathers the armies of heaven that are on earth in that day the elect of god when he blows the trumpet he gathers the army of heaven and i hope i hope you can receive that amen in the way that i when the way that i mean it he gathers the army of heaven amen the the the spiritual elect the attributes of god they may come from god go to god only here to serve god's purpose and they're here to declare this truth and fight back the devil's lie and so he's gathering an army from heaven but they're manifested in flesh [Music] amen i don't think god's recruiting a new army god's had his army from before the foundation of the world and then there was an army here that fought and resisted the devil's lie in the beginning and brother bannon said that was you or some portion of you that was there that resisted the devil's lie in the beginning some angel spirit that spun off of god amen and you resisted it what form i don't know i can't mechanically understand it but there's something in me see that's the truth and that army has been coming down through age and age and eight and when that trumpet sounds it's gathering that army in that day back together for spiritual war against the deception of the devil praise be to god i pray that god makes this clear and clear and clear to us because there's realities here there's truths these prophets brought these things he said these things we don't fully comprehend them we can't fully understand them the human mind may never get it but something in my heart says there's a truth there it's ringing solid it's ringing true then spiritual death hits the church oh it's a great plan until he comes to the last angel now he has no certain mystery but he gathers up all that's been lost in them other ages oh man i'll tell you friends if a truth in that age started spiritual war and spiritual war that would rock the church amen would cause a reformation would he even cause political systems to get involved in the church to unite with politics and they would bring about soldiers and they would arrest people and torture them and put them in prison and execute them that's the result of this spiritual war that was that truth in that day that caused that kind of reaction from the enemy what happens when you gather all of those truths from all of those days and gather them into one what kind of war is that going to be i believe it's going to be the war of all wars for the gentile bride because as to all the truths that were lost it's going back to the original amen the original doctrine of the apostles the original thing that was lost the original word in its original form and as that's gathered together and that trumpet sounded amen that's calling together the armies of heaven that are here in this day to hear that trumpet and they're gathering for what purpose for spiritual war because all hell is going to break loose against this revelation amen no he has no certain mystery but he gathers of all has been lost in the mother ages and all the truths that wasn't truly revealed yet as the revelations come then he reveals those things in this day if you want to read it revelation 10 1-4 about four you'll get it all right takes the book the seals and breaks them and shows the seventh angel for this alone the mysteries of god is the ministry of the seventh angel now we just come through the church ages with even history and prove that see it's the oh where where am i oh it's the things that in the past revelation 10 1-7 that's to be now remember in the days of the seventh angel his sounding forth blasting forth the gospel trump and he has to finish all the mysteries of god so what did brother branham do amen he sounded forth to trumpet but what trumpet did he sound he sounded fourth to seventh trumpet the last trumpet and what was contained in that seventh trumpet all seven trumpets were contained in that seventh trumpet now i'm talking to the gentile bride i'm not talking about the jews the jews have sounding of trumpets the jews have a revelation of trumpets under a feast of trumpets and they have the sounding of the seventh trumpet they have that and the reality amen and those two witnesses will be the sounding of the seventh trumpet to reveal the six trumpets and what were the six trumpets the six trumpets were gathering in the jews for what for spiritual war for a revelation that's going to come forth of the true atonement in christ jesus amen and they're going to recognize the lamb that have been slain and they're going to mourn amen and they're going to gather together it's going to start another spiritual war only this spiritual war because as jews is going to take on a physical manifestation and a gathering of all nations but don't forget that there's been seven trumpets to the gentiles seven gospel trumpets a trumpet in each church age and brother branham sounds the seventh trumpet and in that seventh trumpet because it's a gathering of all the truths of the previous age it's the sounding of all seven trumpets in one trumpet i'd say it's a great gospel trumpet praise god what kind of battle will that start that's why i say i thought of this the invisible final battle i mean you may want to call spiritual armageddon and natural armageddon we can use whatever terms that make us understand it i don't know the best term to use i don't know the best way to describe it but i realize that there's a sounding of a seventh gospel trump and every trumpet before declared war and this one's sounding all seven at once and it's going to be a massive war and this is going to be the final battle for the gentile bride however you want to label that label it any way that makes you comfortable amen but i'm comfortable recognizing that this is a great gospel trumpet that's calling together the armies of heaven to war and that war is over the word amen where am i at i think i'm in a new quote the feast of trumpets he says notice now we find now that the natural power under the natural to a natural nation israel was loosed there and what did it do it went and made war and how it murdered and persecuted and brother brethren i was talking about under the fifth trumpet amen when when uh the the two hundred thousand thousand demons come out amen and and they they go when brother man said where did they go they went to the armies of hitler mussolini and stalin and they went those forces went there and they brought a physical persecution against the jews and that's what brother ben was referring to he said what did they do it went and made war and how it murdered and persecuted he's speaking of the holocaust now in the client in the ecclesiastical realm of it he's showing a transition it was in the natural realm because the naturals to the jews but now it's moved into ecclesiastical realm and it's going to take on a spiritual nature not not necessarily a holocaust of murdering and gathering physical people in a physical place we know there's a future for that in the tribulation period but now it's moved into the ecclesiastical realms and i hope that god opens your eyes to this now because i realize this is just not speaking to this church here this tape goes worldwide and i don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings but just to tell the truth now the ecclesia ecclesiastical realm has been opened from the natural revival of the old pagan rome went forth on those jews which has always been their enemy the lion with the teeth and everything has stomped down and broke out the people rome always been god's enemy and it was turned loose in the same spirit by dictators of the world because the religious system was still holding now it's been loosed mother of is telling you something's changed and when a prophet of god is on the earth amen a word prophet a prophet like moses a prophet like paul brother like brother branham amen there was three prophets like this one that brought the old testament one that brought the new testament and one to come back and revealed it all he's standing on this earth and he's telling you something changed it went out amen those demon forces went out they went into the armies and then they brought a physical persecution now they've moved to the classical realm because the religious system was holding but the religious system is not holding any anymore and he goes on to say he says that's happened just recently and he's speaking of the vatican council amen the vatican 2 council where the pope starts reaching out to what he calls his fallen brethren the protestant church is to bring them back together and unite them in an ecumenical move and brother man's looking at this pope make this move and he's a prophet on this day and he's saying see now there's been a barrier what was the barrier the old kings of the east could not get across the river euphrates there was a barrier that helped them but that barrier is gone now because the protestants now amen there's no more word to separate them they don't believe the word they believe dogmas and creeds and they'll take just anything anybody says and as long as you hold one or two principles the same we'll all be christians and we're all saved i still the same attitude that's out there as long as we hold a couple principles the same and you repeat a couple phrases the same way i repeat a couple of phrases then we're all the same you're my brother we're all christians we're all saved and the water the word that it separated that old babylonian system the kings of the east the assyrian babylonian religion that was now alive in the catholic church there was a barrier that was separating that but under the sixth trumpet the plague was poured on the river and the river dried up to make way for the kings of the east to come across and at that time after that three unclean spirits went out of the mouth of three individuals the false prophet the beast and the dragon amen and those three brother ben said was an antichrist spirit teaching false doctrine of the trinity he said not when it went out but when it began to be revealed when was that it was in brother brennan's ministry so he's telling you he's putting a time indicator amen euphrates spiritually speaking euphrates is dried up the barrier between the old kings of the east the babylonian religion it was alive in the catholic church amen has now crossed over amen into the church all the protestants and that's still happening they're still uniting they're still different ones signing accords and they're still the the water is still drying up and they're still coming across and brother bam said now that's happened recently speaking of vatican due counsel he said now now now it's moved into the ecclesiastical realm and it looks like nothing's happening no world war ii no bombs falling no concentration camps but i don't think the war is any less intense i don't think the battle is any less intense than it was there and i don't think the effort of the devil has diminished any to shut down the truth as he was trying to shut out the jews trying to exterminate the truth he's trying to exterminate the truth with just as much force as he did then only up till now he's prying he's been trying to do it through subtlety through deception but if he's got to crank it up the force he can crank it up to force praise god amen because the religious system was still holding now it's been loosed brother bram said the religious system is loosed the barrier is loosed what has it done in the cunningness as he said he come in like flatteries and what has he done he's bringing the protestant ecumenical council of the world churches the spirit of antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter just like they did the other and the hour to call the bride how loosed in the ecclesiastical church spirit loosed upon what not upon the denominations upon the bride but there you'll get it the bride will not go through that time the bride will not have a repeat of what happened to the jews the nominal church will amen the foolish virgin will amen the 144 000 will but but the bride will not go through that time like the jews did before it gets there maybe just before it gets her i don't know how much before he gets there he'll whisk her away she will not see that he'll keep her from it the church will but but not the bride so this has been loosed amen has been loosed upon who who's he gunning for he's gunning for the bride he was gunning for the jews who was it loose before before on the jews who's it loosed upon now the bride because he hates the spiritually revealed word and the one that he hates the most is a spiritually revealed word to the individual that's the thing that he hates make it a church system please make it a church system make it a group make it all of us let's just say everybody who walks in these doors this sunday we're all bride we're all okay we're all part of it we got our stamp on our card we came to church we came in this building this is the right place with the right doctrine and the right teaching we're all okay that's that is the teaching that he loves [Music] he loves that teaching because if we all settle down in that teaching all he's got to do is bring an anointing to one or two at the top of that ladder and he can sway the whole group into deception but the truth that he hates is that this revelation is to the individual to the end i know myself i mean i don't need a group i don't need another teacher i don't need a priest i don't need anybody to tell me because god himself has told me i met him in the backside of the desert and he told me who i am and all hell is against this revelation amen he wants to make it a group he'll try to do it in the message make it a group we hold this doctrine we hold this doctrine this group this group don't be part of any group amen it's an individual connected to christ and satan is fighting that revelation well we all believe like this group we've all been like this group i don't want to believe like any group i want to believe by revelation that he gives me personally that i see it in the word that i'm not a parent repeating a preacher but i've got my own revelation of who i am and what the word is for this day and where i fit into the picture all hell is against that revelation that's why amen if you preach that revelation teach that revelation and bring that revelation you better be ready for trouble because satan hates that trouble comes in all kinds of forms to bring discouragement to bring disappointment amen to bring exhaustion but what's he trying to do he's trying to stop that truth from being expressed and catching the individuals because he has no power over individuals with an individual connection to the throne of god because god can make a move amen and all the believers in the whole world will catch it because they don't have to wait they don't have to wait for a certain group or a certain teaching to come out or a certain man to say it amen they're catching their own revelation from god they have their own connection with god all hell is against that revelation that's what brother ben says christ is mystery guard reveal he says it over and over what's the devil howling about that is being revealed that the bride is catching it that she's knowing her position not in the group it's not like we we we're all uniting with christ brother branham said in every church there's believers make believers and unbelievers pastors don't like saying that i don't like saying that but it's the truth and if i don't say it you'll settle down and say i'm in the group don't be in the group because in the group as believers unbelievers and make believers you better make your calling and election sure you better know for yourself who you are who god told you himself a personal revelation of jesus christ to you personally so that the sort of the pastor says amen there's believers make believers and unbelievers in here you say well i know which one i am i'm the believer not by merit amen not my performance amen but i'm a believer by faith amen god has unlocked it in my heart and i know it's the truth and i know i'm part of it amen you know your flesh is an unbeliever your human spirit is a make-believer [Applause] the only believer is the genuine you down on the inside that's the only believer amen these other realms have to go away or be changed amen they just have to dissolve or they've got to be changed amen but the only real believers the believer down on the inside amen so if your flesh does something that an unbeliever would do amen let the real believer on the inside jerk the chain and bring it back in line but don't let the devil tell you you're not a believer if the spirit amen would begin to doubt or have a question or a concern or a misunderstanding on the word or not sure about this or not sure about that amen let that spirit be a make-believer amen amen you let the believer on the inside raise up and say hush quit your presuming quit your sin and quit quit your thinking amen i know who i am and i know in whom i have believed and i know he's able all hell is against this revelation this is what the battle is over friends battle is over you as one person being a bride of jesus christ you as one person being the word made flesh you as one individual being the manifestation of jesus christ in this age all hell is against that revelation praise be to god now i want to start looking at i'm going to i'm going to read some quotes now and i want to start looking at things that brother venom says he's talking about revelation 19 and armageddon things that he says that make you think brother branham is he god is using that vessel to speak in a certain way we need to pay attention to what he says in the feast of trumpets he says now notice while that group is writing making themselves ready to stomp out everything that won't agree with them there is another group being made ready after a while revelation 19. the next time the church is heard she comes also not upon exactly horses in revelation 19 she comes riding on white horses but brother brandon said not exactly upon horses is brother branham denying the word no he realizes the book of revelation is a book of symbols and he's trying to get you to move away from the symbol to what the symbol represents oh praise god not exactly horses but brother in freedom the bible says horses and brother branham even uses this to defend himself he uses this scripture when the man says how can you say when you were over beyond the curtain of time in the sixth dimension that your horse was there how are horses there brother said didn't you read the bible he comes riding a white horse and they come riding white horses brother brandon uses to defend himself then he turns around and says not exactly horses it's a different kind of transportation it's a different kind of power that moves them represented as a white horse but not exactly a horse i love it i love it because this is why god wants us to catch by revelation not intellectual teaching not the coloring book not the fill in the blanks he doesn't want us to come up and teach it amen and teach it in such a way that we lay it out so nice and tidy then laughter where we pass out the exam and multiple choices a b d c a god doesn't want that god wants to be in such a way you say if you don't show me i won't get it the bible says white horses brother bram says white horses it proves that there can be horses over there and i didn't even say i was in heaven but look at the bible anyways nice is not exactly upon horses was it horses or not horses but god wants god wants to teach he wants to be the revealer of the truth he wants us to understand he'll use preaching he'll use teaching but unless god unlocks it you'll walk away and next time somebody speaks to you'll be confused it'll all make sense in the service and it won't make no sense later unless it comes by spiritual revelation not upon exactly horses but the bible said he was on a white horse and the host of heaven was following him upon white horses he just he just declared listen i'm going to read this again because it's kind of funny revelation 19 the next time the church is heard she comes also not upon exactly horses but the bible said he was on white horses and the host of heaven was following him on white horses brother said not exactly horses but the bible said white horses well brother branham since you didn't say what the bible said i'm going to take what the bible said take what the bible says but understand what the bible means quote the bible verbatim but understand that's a symbol because revelation is a book of symbols is that right well this group down here has got 2 000 bound at the river euphrates and has been bound for two thousand years also that church has bound the holy ghost for nearly two thousand years under martyrdom back there and under the church ages it's been bound not at the river of euphrates but at the door of creeds and dongmas that the holy spirit can't work in the church because of man-made systems but she is going to be liberated she is coming back that's what the bible said and these two meet one another on the battleground lucifer and michael again like in the beginning they've been bound for two thousand years almost almost two thousand years just catch what he says he says now this one's been bound at the river euphrates for two thousand years but over here the holy ghost has been bound by man-made systems and creeds and dogmas but both are going to be loosed the the demon forces that have been bound at the river euphrates for two thousand years because of the religious system it'll be loosed because the religious system will be so off the word the euphrates will be dry and those spirits will move right into the protestant churches and they'll never know it so that's been loosed on that end amen now on this end the holy ghost has been bound for nearly two thousand years by manmade systems trees and dogmas but it'll be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy ghost back in the church again and what does that do it starts the war again lucifer and michael facing off again they've been bound but now they're loosed and what are they coming to a great final battle for the gentile bride for the revealed word that's through the gentile bride amen it's come back again it's been bound it's been limited there's been skirmishes but there's been a great binding but that great binding has been released on the ecumenical side amen has released the ecclesiastical side amen and by the opening of the word amen by the true revelation that dispels all man-made systems all dogmas all man's ideas it's loose the holiest ghost has been bound by man's dogmas man's creeds man's chains it's been loose to who it's been loosed back upon the bride and these two forces remember that's what brother ben said these two meet one another on the battlegrounds lucifer and michael like in the beginning it's a repeat of that battle praise be to god i hope you understand i hope god can bring it in revelation for him see what i'm saying friends this isn't like another church age this isn't like anything that's happened before and then there's been a truth rise up and a war over that truth and that and they fought the battle and and the devil did all of his tactics to shut it down and begin to destroy the vessels and then the messenger would leave and the truth would get obscure the church would go into spiritual death but god would raise up another one because he always had a lex seed that was coming through there and the lex seed was limited by all these creeds and all this dogma it was a limitation to the elect seed because of the misunderstanding of the word because of the false teaching right so the election was always limited but then a truth would come up and they'd rise up in that truth that truth would push back the forces of the devil and a big fight would break out then the plague would fall then spiritual death said and god did it again but this time is different because this time it's not another truth coming forth for another cycle he has broke the cycle by bringing all the truth and totally exposing the devil he's completely broke the cycle this last trumpet will not start another repeat cycle this last trumpet will break the cycle for the elect because she will have the word vindicated proven by god himself to be the truth and she will stand on that word in the word only and it will loose the holy ghost they meant to be in full measure back in the church again to fight back this forces that have been loosed and the band will cross over euphrates see the brother branham's not using cute analogies he's telling us spiritually what is happening you're afraid he says dried up well i can go look at your phrase i can pull up a google map image and i can see there's water there there's even christians who are watching euphrates because there's been droughts recently and it looked like it was going to dry up and then they had a dam there was a problem with a dam and it looks like there may be a fulfillment of that physically but by the time that comes it's too late for you it's too late for you because there's been a prophet in this day that's always said euphrates is already dried up i don't have to look at a google image i realize what he's talking about spiritually whether it be a physical manifestation probably there will be but that's too late for the gentiles it's too late then that's going to be at a time of redemption for the 144 000. not for the gentile bride don't be watching euphrates friends brother braham said euphrates is dry and the armies are marching across the kings are coming across don't watch euphrates it won't mean anything to you [Music] god's already told us praise god praise god i just pray god just keep revealing the truth to us to me and then so we can see i'm going to read i got a couple long quotes to read so hang tight with me at the fourth seal brother bram says now the battle started in heaven it'll be finished on earth in the form of armageddon now let's watch and see it unfold and maybe we can unfold it if the lord help us right now to do this now watch it unfold what's brother graham saying the battle started in heaven it'll end in armageddon let's unfold it this is interesting he's going to show us coming to the battle of armageddon and he wants to unfold it so let the prophet unfold it what he's not going to talk about is tanks and guns and warfare when he's unfolding this coming to the battle of armageddon he is not going to talk about anything physical he's going to talk about the ecclesiastical realm he is unfolding this coming to the battle of armageddon he says the mysterious writer watch what he does he's unfolding it now opposed refused to repent and go back to the original blood word the word became blood and flesh he refused to go back to it his antichrist the true word bride he opposes the true word bride takes his own bride he opposes this true bride also and he takes his own bride and brings her to him in a form of a religion called creeds and dogma see what's he doing he's unfolding the coming down to armageddon and now seeing the holy bride he is against her but he forms his own bride called antichrist by antichrist teaching which is contrary to christ see how shrewd he is and now instead of having a unity of love controlling worship under blood he's got a denomination instead of having the word he took creeds dogmas and so forth skipping down two paragraphs it says notice it's christ the christ the antichrist refuses the true bride doctrine what's he doing he's unfolding the coming to armageddon he said let's unfold it now he's still in the same thoughts the antichrist refuses the true bride doctrine and therefore he takes his own bride now and builds her up under a creed of his own takes his own bride and makes her a denomination she gives birth to other denominations as quoted in the holy scripture gives birth to daughters and she becomes just like her mother natural worldly denominational opposing the spiritual bride the word now the he opposes the spiritual bride the word what is the spiritual bride the word i hope that doesn't stumble you what is the spiritual pride the word what was john the baptist when he came the word what was paul when he came the word enlightened to the gentiles what was jesus when he came the word what was brother branham when he came the word what are you and your coming the word because there's a promise of a bride that'll be here in the end time and you're if you're part of that bride and you're part of the word and then you're a manifestation of the revelation of the word the prophecy of a bride in this day and that makes the spiritual bride the word on in the fourth seal he says now to gather them on their mixed colored horses he's gathering this thing together mixed with creed's denominations man made doctrines is that right sure a mixed color the mixed color of the dead pale horse of the world now that's right mixed colors of the dead worldly form of the pale horse oh my no blood of the word at all because it was the word that bled for you without the word you're not getting the blood they're just still preaching thinking they're getting people the blood but they refused a path to the blood which is the word because it was the word that bled for you the word died for you they don't have any no holy blood of the word because they've rejected the word you can't have the blood it's so simple but i don't know why it's so troublesome for people's minds but it's the truth that the prophet brought us is the truth from the scriptures you reject the word you reject christ you reject christ you reject your atonement the atonement is the manifested word praise god and watch from the four corners of the earth they gather them gathers them to armageddon the bible says i'm trying to think of the scriptures i got them wrote down here i ain't calling them but where they were written down see what they are gathers them together to the great day of the battle of the lord god watch now on his mixed color worldly pale sick horse just think of it you know that's a bad thing now watch where he gathers them from the four corners of the earth they are gathered now for the showdown the showdown will be at armageddon according to the word on the pale horse riding on it with a death tact with the name with the name tacked on him death because we go back to the seals and we see that the white horse rider had no wasn't named and he went out it was an antichrist spirit that went out to combat the truth amen and he come out looking pure but he wasn't pure and he came out to defile to deceive and to conquer and he switched horses but it was the same rider antichrist spirit and he moved to the red horse to the black horse then he moved to the pale horse but when he moved to the pale horse in the seals in revelation chapter 6 now he gets a name and his name is death and hell follows him so when he moves to the pale horse he gets a name death and hell follows him so brother branham's saying now he's named it's the pale horse we're in the time of the pale horse and the pair is riding on it with a death tact with the name tacked on him death the antichrist listen antichrist first denomination that can't be spirit he says it can't be the holy spirit that's what he's saying with his jezebel a prostitute to the word with her daughters protestants gathering themselves together now in unity now here they are joining themselves together coming to that showdown to armageddon and riding on a mixed-colored horse with one horse of white one horse of red one horse of black the three different political powers spiritual power controlled by demon power which is the antichrist mixing that all together you've got a pale sickly looking thing he's riding on that's right now notice look what he's riding on this pale looking grizzled colored horse mixed with black red and white coming into the battle gathering his subjects from every nation under heaven did not daniel interpret the dream and seen that streak of iron running to every kingdom of rome here they come gathering now set still for the close just a minute and listen close he's still unfolding the coming to armageddon they're gathering and now to do it bring his subjects from the four corners of the earth riding a pale sickly three colored mixed same man in revelation 19 not only is he getting ready but christ is getting ready to meet him the battle is going to be hot and heavy christ in revelation 19 christ is gathering his not from the four corners of the earth because there's going to be a little bitty remnant what's he going he's gathering them from the four corners of heaven we'll get them souls under the altar tomorrow night and you'll see whether it's right or not four corners of heaven on a snow white horse is it exactly a horse brother and say that i said that because when the saints were riding on white horses and not exactly a horse now he's coming on a pure white horse and i'm just asking the question exactly a horse or not exactly a horse let's just keep reading amen a snow white horse he also has a name not death but the word of god life amen god wrote right on his thigh here the word of god that's the only life because god is the only source of eternal life there is zoe is that right and he's god wrote life riding on a white horse and here's a man with three different powers mixed up called death gathering his earthbound delegates and christ is gathering as heaven-born subjects saints where have you been born from are you a heaven-born subject are you a saint then that's who he's gathering the white horse rider christ in revelation 19 is gathering his heaven-born subjects i say i'm gathering lord i'm coming i hear the trumpet and i'm running to my captain on the white horse he's got death throat on him christ got life rolled on him those with him are on white horses also are they exactly white horses they are on white horses also and they are called the chosen before the foundation of the world amen they are faithful to the word amen i like that i like that one called chosen before the foundation of the world and then faithful to the word by their choosing all stimulated with new wine and oil just riding right along coming down to meet him they know the thunders will issue the thing course pretty soon what was the thunders the thunders was the preaching of the seals and the thunders was issuing this thing forth what was it heaven open revelation 19 christ on a white horse and the armies of heaven following after him to do what to come down to face off with lucifer again where's the battle it's in your mind [Music] praise god i'm not denying that there'll be a manifestation in the future to israel in the flesh i'm not saying that but i'm telling you the thunders has issued this thing forth for us we've seen the heavens open amen we've seen christ coming what's he coming for he's gathering his armies under the sound of a trumpet for what for spiritual war for a showdown for a final battle and it's going to be over the word and it's going to be over what word it's going to be over the spiritual revelation to the individual that's the battleground your revelation who you are who he told you you were your place in the body your place in time your position in christ that's what the battle's over and you wonder why so much trouble comes and so much doubt and conflict and everything that you want to go right goes wrong and everything you try to do fails what's it all about he's trying to attack your revelation of who you are trying to discredit the word what's the word you're the word not this guy oh i wish we could get away from that because when i make statements like that it locks people up they start looking at flesh and the man in the mirror it has nothing to do with that guy he was the real you the one that was intended to be you from the beginning that gene of god down on the soul that's who the word is it's the manifestation of the word and it can only be reflected out of this flesh but this flesh is not it when we start to identify with this amen we start to lock ourselves away from the very promise in this hour and who we actually are we can no longer identify with this but we got to identify with the real genuine who we are on the inside that's why brother branham in his last message in communion would say you've never really seen me you've only seen the vessel that i dwell in but you've never seen me jesus in a simple scripture they ask him his disciples they're condemning him why do your disciples eat with unwashed hands and jesus says it's not that a man goes in the mouth of a man defiles a man for what you eat goes into the belly and comes out the drought now he's talking physical all physical what you eat goes into your belly it goes through the digestive system it comes out to drop brother bran or jesus is using pretty plain language and he's not denying the fact that what you eat won't harm your flesh you can take in disease you can eat spoiled food you can get food poisoning but he's saying that's not what harms a man but what defiles a man is what comes out of his heart so what is a man a man is what he is in his soul in his heart that's the man that he's talking about and you can't defile that man by what you eat you're a soul man a spirit man and a flesh man and jesus was referring to the soul man amen not the flesh man he said you're so worried about washing hands amen you're so worried about the filing of flesh the flesh is defiled anyways the fest is going to the grave anyways he's going to have to make it over but don't worry about that that's not what defiles a man what defiles a man is what comes out of his mouth for what comes out of his mouth is what comes from his heart and that's the thing that defiles a man because what jesus considered a man was what you really are in your soul that's right we've got to quit identifying with this he's going to change this quit identifying with the human mind reasoning that's going to vanish the way you're going to get the correct one one day we've got to identify with that seed gene of god who we really are in the kingdom of god who we really are in christ and that's who these promises for that's who the word is that's who the bride is oh it's tabernacled in flesh it's tabernacled in clay and then in the clays of failure to begin with the clay is full of faults and we'll we'll be full of faults until he changes it but that's not what we focus on friends we focus on the real you on the inside the word didn't come to unlock your flesh the word came to unlock your that c gene on the inside amen so that you could be a new creation in christ jesus so that you could be a meltdown in the soul so that the life that's laying there can to grow and take over and that's the real you and that's the life that'll take control of this life praise be to god where am i amen he's gathering together as heaven-born subjects now it says i'm just going to read this last paragraph i just read those with him are on white horses also they are called the chosen before the foundation of the world and they are faithful to the word oh i like that one called chosen before the foundation of the world and then faithful to the word by their choosing all stimulated with new wine and oil just riding right along coming down to meet him they know the thunders will issue this this thing course pretty soon watch how does he do so if he is the word and his name is the word then the word is life the antichrist anything anti is against so anti against the christ the word so it's got to be a creator or denomination which is against the word why i don't see how you're going to miss it do you understand how could you miss it i don't know how you're going to do it but that's true anti is against is that right take away from that's what he he was he's riding his mixed up horse we see it right here in the word of god we see it right here in the seven church ages here he brings it right back in the seals opening up and showing them things that went on in the church ages anti is against the word see why creeds why we're so against the creeds and denominations because they're against the word here we see life and death coming to the final struggle what's he doing he's still unfolding to coming down to armageddon we're still in the fourth seal we're still in the same portion he's talking about here we see life and death coming to the final struggle what's life and death coming to the final struggle the word and antichrist anything against the word it's coming down to the final because these forces had been loosed the white horse of true life the pale horse of mixed creed you see the thing coming to a real showdown you see when we look at the four horses road by the antichrist white red black pale we know that those are forces we don't we don't believe that he's really riding around on earth on a white horse so do we really believe that in the battle of armageddon jesus christ has to be on earth sitting on a white horse because the pale horse rider those are the two that are facing off and the payloads where you're not going to see a pale horse it's a force it's a power that's carrying the antichrist spirit just hang with me don't take a detour don't exit stay tight we're going to keep reading and see what brother branham says now i want to say something here you might not believe this but i looked it up sure there's only one original color that's white how many knows that there's only one original color anything else is mixed christ is on a solid white unadulterated word from the beginning what is the power that's carrying christ the anointing it's the word it's the original word from the beginning the unadulterated unmixed with any other color pure word back to the pure revelation back to the pure doctrine back to the pure intent of the word amen and what is christ writing christ is writing this pure unadulterated word it's carrying the anointing every color would be white if some chemistry hadn't broken glory every church would be standing on the apostolic doctrine of the word of god and god confirming it if he didn't have creeds and denominations mixed into it there you are oh brother evans i feel good right now yes sir yes sir only one original color that's white it never mixed with denominations or creeds no sir and remember his saints are clothed in white robes not mixed with denomination and creeds now we find out the denominations and creeds here where you get your mixed color but this original color he's writing the original color on his people and they've been dipped in the blood that cleansed that garment and sent it right back beyond her that's right so your garment your white garment is your white garment and you've been dipped in the blood of jesus christ and purified it's the righteousness of the saints i'm gonna i'm gonna inject another quote here then we're gonna come right back to the unfolding coming down to armageddon you see how he's unfolding he's not talking about military power and might and tanks and he's talking about two forces spiritual forces that are facing off in an ecclesiastical realm the uniting time and signs i just want to inject this here god is uniting his bride she is coming together from the east and the west and the north and the south why because heaven's open a trumpet has sounded and she's gathering there is a uniting time and that's on right now what is she uniting for the rapture amen god's getting her ready yes sir united what is she uniting with with the word for all heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away she's uniting herself with thus saith the lord regardless of what any denomination or anybody else says she's uniting herself she's getting ready why she is the bride i want to ask you something if she's uniting with thus saith the lord she's uniting with the word the pure word the unadulterated word what horse is she riding not exactly horses but a power that's carrying her why she's the bride that's right and she's uniting herself with her bridegroom see and the bridegroom is the word in the beginning it was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and the church and the bride and the word is becoming so one until the very word itself is working out the work of the bridegroom amen you see it a uniting not no more join the church not no more this but flee from everything and and be tied to jesus christ it's the uniting time god uniting his bride together bringing it back just exactly uniting the word of his promise now i just want you to catch that phrase uniting his bride bringing it back what's he bringing it back to he's bringing it back to his original intention before creeds and dogmas polluted it the bride the bride tree was eight down the bride tree fell through four stages of the inside but he's bringing her back bring her back bring her back to her original condition to fulfill her original purpose now i'm coming back to the fourth seal in the unfolding coming down to armageddon here comes satan with all four corners of the earth with his protestants with his catholics and all together marching right up to the battle of armageddon all right and here comes jesus come down from heaven with resurrected saints vindicated word where has he resurrected his saints from he's resurrected him out of dead denominationalism out of creeds and dominance of man and resurrected him and brought him out and quickened them back to life what has he done he's brought the church back listen listen brother bam told us when john got caught up he said see one man can represent all of the church one man could represent all the church and when brother branham was caught up into that constellation of angels he met the lord in the air amen he represented the whole church but now this bride in the capstone ministry this capstone bride she is representing the whole church for 2000 years and the church has come back and then he's brought it back he has resurrected his church he's revived his church he's brought her out of dead denominationalism and brought it back into life that's what brother branham's telling us the church is back the restoration of the bride tree she has come back and everyone that is sleeping amen is represented in this ministry just like we were represented in brother branham when he was caught up we were represented in john and the bible he's caught up where the whole bride is represented in this capstone bride who has been resurrected amen what's he coming with resurrected saints riding on white horses with white robes i don't know about you but i'm riding on the word and i'm wearing the robe of his righteousness and i have been resurrected i've been called out of the dead and resurrected back to newness of life i've been quickened by the spirit i'm a candidate for this and i said if god speaks and sends you he backs up what you say oh listen he's unfolding the coming down to armageddon we're coming down on the farm again let's unfold it for a little bit i want to read i want to read the previous line and then come down to this because they go together and here comes jesus coming down from heaven with resurrected saints vindicated word as i said if god speaks and sends you he backs up what you say you see notice if you're an ambassador from heaven all heaven's behind you and heaven is consisted of the word [Music] what's happened all the word has come down do you believe that has the word come down revelation 19 he comes riding on a white horse his name is faithful and true he's called faithful and true amen his name is called the word of god what is it it's the word of god coming and with him amen comes resurrected saints the word of god is coming amen and the word is here amen because the word amen was in noah i was in the ark with noah do you catch this because all of the word was hanging on the cross i was on the cross are you catching it amen because the word was in david when he went to face goliath i was with david when he faced goliath and now all the word has returned the holy ghost is now in full measure upon the bride upon the church and the full word has been restored so all of heaven is here if i was there they're here if i was there on calvary amen amen what was on calvary it was the word made flesh and now that word has returned and come into the bride amen if i was there they're here because they're the word as much as i'm the word and wherever the word was i was there amen i was there that day on calvary i was there when noah entered the ark i was there when abraham walked away from his land i was there when david slew goliath what did brother benham teach us that it's not a cute story it's a it's a spiritual reality because there's a link i'm the word that's the word wherever there's a manifestation of the word i was caught up in that manifestation and now the manifestation of the word is that heavens have opened christ has come the word is here and if the word is here amen the host of heaven is here they're represented in the capstone bride and all of heaven is here to back you up if you're an ambassador and heaven is consistent of the word so if all of heaven is here to back you up because all of the word is here who's fighting all of hell is against this revelation the floodgates of hell is open death is riding the pale horse and hell follows him hell is spilled out upon the earth brother branham saw in jcpenney not a vision it wasn't a vision it was a reality and when he saw it it took him back to an experience he had when he was almost dead laying all his blood leading out as a boy he had went to heaven to hell and when he saw in hell he was now seeing in jcpenney in tucson arizona and he declared that hell is upon the earth and if hell is upon the earth when when the enemy comes in like a flood god raises up a standard and all of hell is here all of heaven is here because all of the word is here and heaven is consistent of the word and these two forces are facing one another again and where are they facing each other in you because you're carrying the word and standing on the word and the whole battle is about your position in christ and your revelation of who you are don't wait for a future this in the future that if you make if you're waiting for the future we're not even understanding the battle that we're in if you're an ambassador from heaven all heaven's behind you and heaven is consisted of the word notice now he's come with resurrected saints vindicating that his word is true so satan knows then the bottomless pit is ready for him don't think he's not fighting you as every elect seed catches this revelation his kingdom is being destroyed and when the final one comes in brother berm said the rapture will go when that takes place he is finished why is he fighting you why is he fighting the revelation why is he fighting with mind battles why is he fighting with troubles in every side this isn't you say well this is normal normal stuff people go through you're not a normal person other people may go through similar things but this battle is over your revelation of who you are i want to read this quote we're still in the fourth seal we're still on the uh unfolding of the coming down to armageddon don't lose where we're at if you're an ambassador from heaven all heavens behind you in heaven is consistent of the word notice he's come with resurrected saints vindicating that his word is true satan knows then that the bottomless pit is ready for him see oh my while death rode the pale horse mixed creed and denominations and followed him oh my the eternal separation from god that's where he rode them to eternal separation christ rode his church is christ the white horse rider he's talking about the pearl horse rider the pale horse rode his mixed denomination and creed and political he rode them right into eternal separation but christ the anointed word rode his church right into glory in the resurrection so where is that white horse that white horse is the unadulterated word he's writing that word and where is that word manifest it's in a bride that has been brought back to the original word in her original condition for original purpose and he rides his church he rides his church amen rides his church what is the white horse friends what's the white horse you're on the word what's the white horse he's on the word what word the pure word that's been restored back which is now fine found in a bride on this earth and he writes his church right into glory in the resurrection don't put this in the future friends this is now this is happening right now the prophet gave us all the indicators all the clues all the pieces all the scriptures to show you spiritually this is a reality right now praise god i want to read the first seal just bear with me i got more to read don't go nowhere brother graham said the biggest problem the church always had is looking back the way he's done looking forward and missing what he's doing now if that's always been the biggest problem could it be the biggest problem today this revelation helps us understand our lives this message came to help us understand who we are and what's going on all around us the first seal paragraph 271 notice now the holy spirit and the revelation in christ the holy spirit is christ in another form that's right notice it is a lamb that opened the book and the lamb is christ and christ is not seen anymore from then but he is seen in the book of revelation 19th chapter coming on a white horse now remember the holy ghost in christ is the same the holy ghost is christ in another form so in revelation 19 you see him coming on a white horse if you'd like to read it let's turn to revelation 19 11 to 6. let's read it right quick now while we're here beginning at the 11th verse and read down through it says i saw heavens open behold a white horse not on earth in heaven and he that sat on him was called faithful true and righteous does he judge and make war his eyes were flames of fire and on his head was crowns look at the diadem and he had a name written with no man known but himself i wish i could stop on that just a minute and brother branham goes through and he starts to explain i won't read it all but he starts to explain every time there's been a victory there's been a battle and a victory a name changes he shows abram to abraham simon to peter saul to paul we went through this a couple weeks ago so we'll skip past that but i want you to understand that went from jacob to israel he said in jesus his name on earth was redeemer jesus which he was on earth he was the redeemer that's true but when he conquered death in hell and overcame them and ascended on high he received a new name that's the reason they holler the way they do and they don't get nothing it'll be revealed in the thunders see he was redeemer he was kinsmen redeemer amen but then now he's coming his bridegroom to claim what he's redeemed he's coming see he said that's why they don't get nothing they're looking at a past manifestation they're looking at a past work and missing his present work he was redeemer there on calvary he was mediator and kinsman redeemer he was a mediator through the church ages but they're not catching his current work now he's a bridegroom uniting with his bride and now he is found in the form of his bride he has come the head to the body now he is on earth as mrs jesus christ and they're hollering about redeemer all redeemer redeemer said they're not getting nothing that's why they're not getting anything it's because they don't know him present tense they can't get anything from him knowing him past tense they have to know him present tense and present tense he has come in the formation of his bride it is the word that is returned to the church the head connected to the body amen the full revelation of god the mystery of god revealed christ now united with his bride that's where he is that's his new name it didn't change jesus christ it's still jesus christ that's not that's not it it's he was redeemer he was mediator now he's husband to the bride he's now here as mrs jesus christ that's why he said it will be revealed in the thunders what was revealed who you are where he's at the coming of the lord and where he's at i want to read that again when he conquered death and helen overcame them and they sent him on high he received a new name that's the reason they'll holler the way they do and don't get nothing it'll be revealed in the thunders notice the mystery he's coming that's the mystery he's coming writing there's got to be something to change this church you know that there's got to be something noticed no man knowed but himself noticed no man known but himself he goes back to the scripture he was clothed with a vester dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god oh notice the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed and fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goes the sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he tread the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god and he had on his vesture and honest eye a name written king of kings and lord of lords there comes the messiah there he is not this fellow on this horse back here talking about the original white horse rider back in the church ages but watch the difference here he stands with the book in his hand here the redemptive work he wasn't took his place yet so it was not the christ that went forth the holy spirit not disagreeing with them great men no sir i don't do it i wouldn't want to do that but this is my to my what my revelation of it is if you got something different well that's all right but it ain't all right with me i believe it this way you know you know what you know what see and notice christ is not seen anymore from that time there but he's on a white horse so if this guy is riding a white horse he's only an impersonator of christ get that notice the writer on the white horse don't have any name he might use two or three titles but he wasn't got any name but christ has a name what is it the word of god that's what it is in the beginning was the word of god and the word was with god and the word was was god and the word was made flesh see the writer has no name but christ is called the word of god that's what he is he's called that now he's got a name that no man knows but he's called the word of god this guy isn't called nothing but he's on a white horse the writer has no arrows for his bow did you notice he had a bow but there's nothing said about him having any arrows so he must be a bluffer that's right maybe he's got a lot of thunder no lightning but you find out christ has both lightning and thunder for out of his mouth goes a sharp two-edged sword and he smites the nations and this guy can't smite nothing but he's playing the part of a hypocrite he's going forth riding on a white horse going out to conquer christ has a sharp sword and watch it it comes from his mouth the living word and that's the word of god revealed to his servants what's that sword it's a symbol do we believe that a physical battle of armageddon when jesus comes down i meant to save the jews when he comes down to destroy all the nations that have gathered do you think he's going to be on a white horse sitting there as a man with a giant sword sticking out of his mouth and chopping their heads off with that sword coming out of his mouth that's a cartoon that's a horror film this is symbolic what does he destroy them with he destroys him with his word he destroys them with his word amen like he said the sharp sword watch it comes from his mouth the living word that's the word of god revealed to his servants that's the word of god revealed to his servants what's the sharp sword that comes out of his mouth the white white horse rider was a sharp sword that comes out of his mouth it's the living word the word that's revealed to his servants that's why when brother branham was up in sabino cannon he had his hand up in the air and all of a sudden a sword hit his hand and what did he say it's the sword of the king not aching the king's sword and that's the same sword that's out of his mouth is now in the prophet's hand because it's the word of the lord it's the word that smites the antichrist it's the word that brings the destruction it's the word that destroys his kingdom amen and now it's the word of god revealed to his servants like he said to moses go stand there and hold that stick out yonder call for flies and there was sure whatever he said he'd done it and it come to pass his living word god and his word as the self-same person god is the word praise god brother bram says in the fourth seal he said he i had to go different parts of the scripture to prove these things so that that's the reason i went to revelation 19 to show the end of the antichrist will be the slaying of christ when he comes he will slay the antichrist when he comes he will slay the antichrist how will he slay the antichrist not riding on a physical horse with a sword sticking out of his mouth because the antichrist is a spirit you can't kill the spirit with a physical sword you can't chase a spirit with a physical horse but how does he come when he comes how does he come he comes as the word of god and he comes as the word and the word was placed in the prophet's hand and the prophet went out and he broke the seals he revealed the word the sharp sword was coming out of christ's mouth and what was he doing he was smiting the antichrist in the opening of the seals when christ comes he will slay the antichrist for his bride the antichrist has been slain the creeds and the dogmas and all the false things of the antichrist the word of god has come to slay that antichrist and he's still slaying it brother says in the second seal we're winding down stay with me do we want to do jumping jacks push-ups now now remember he's got a sword he's going forth a sword in his hand riding red horse he's talking about the red horse rider wading through the blood of everybody that disagrees with him now do you understand how many understands what the seal is now now what did jesus say it take he that they that take the sword will perish by the sword is that right all right all right this rider and all his kingdom subjects that are slain down through the ages that's drawn all his blood of the martyrs of the saints will be slain by the sword of jesus christ when he comes his word will do the slaying his word was put in the hand of the prophet his word is now in the bride in his word will do the slaying he is called the word of god he and the word is the same now notice not his name his name called word of god he's only knows one name no other name now watch what did jesus say he takes the sword all right red horse rider hear it here where she's coming he that takes the sword might have killed 68 million of them down through these ages since then maybe more but jesus said he that takes the sword will perish by the sword that red horse rider that took the sword to brought a bit of persecution he will die by the sword but it will not be another physical sword it will be it'll be the sword of the spirit which is the word of god which is part of our our armor meant for our spiritual warfare on down at the end of this court he says the same that same word will rise in power coming forth from the lips of jesus christ and it shall slay him and everything before him the victory is in the word the one on the white horse has a sword coming out of his mouth they that follow him are white horses but if you read ephesians they have a sword too which is the sword of the spirit the word of god and the antichrist the army of heaven all fights with the same weapon that spiritual army which we're a part of all fights with the same weapon and the weapon they fight with is the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and it destroys the antichrist brother branham in the fourth seal when he's praying he says something interesting i'm just laying these down because we'll pull these together in just a few minutes he's praying he says may the holy spirit come down now the white horse rider he's in the fourth seal he's trying to get us to see something that the holy ghost has been bound for nearly two thousand years by creeds and dogma remember be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy spirit back on the people again which is the white horse rider the holy spirit is christ in another form the holy ghost is returned the word is returned amen is where does it return it's back upon the people again the white horse writer the full measure of the holy ghost has come with the full word and he's writing his church in the glory one more quote here out of the unveiling of god when he comes he's going to be called the word of god riding upon a white horse and the followers of heaven will be behind him i want to ask you a question are you a follower from heaven follower of heaven are you a heaven-born subject are you have you been called by the god last gospel trump at the seventh trumpet are you called to be an invincible warrior are you called in the army of god have you been given armament it's nothing to do with flesh it's all about the word and it's all about the word and you and i brother brahm says in christ as the mystery of god revealed oh if i could get the world to see that why there you are there is the body of christ living standing redeemed redeemed oh my justified in his sight why are we justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in this last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory when we when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us that's right and we're already potentially arise because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominational creeds to an eternal word of the eternal god which is him his self working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever and when the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it so that same word moves from the head as the day comes close down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one they are husband and wife they are flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life spirit of a spirit amen how do you know it bears the same record same fruit same word see manifest christ the same life same god same spirit same word same book amen same signs things that i do show you do also oh hallelujah my notice the vindicated word in his body is his very victory and the reason of his death see the death not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh his spirit went to hell and preached to the souls in prison that's right his flesh only died when he raised it up again and quickened it quicken means made alive his flesh which was his body and that's the word it's been laying dead for years now we're coming to christ's body in the resurrection he shows that his physical body the one that walked by the sea of galilee it died and it went to the grave his body amen his spirit didn't die but his body died went to the grave but it was resurrected after three days but now he's going right to the body which is his church which is the bride and he's is the word he said that's the word it's been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in the reformation and now she is standing upon her feet what is that it's the body of jesus christ resurrected he brought the bride back in the restoration of the bride tree i'm telling you friends the capstone ministry is here she is standing on her feet she has gradually come back from the reformation but she is here she is here he is here he is here in her she is here he is here if she has the fullness of the word then he is here if he is here we're in him he's in her all the host of heaven is here because heaven consists of the word and the word is here [Music] where's the battle here what's the fight over that revelation christ in you amen christ in you the revelation of the whole thing he says she's standing upon her feet unless he said that's the word his body the word it's been laying dead for years why creeds and dogmas denominations but it gradually began to come in the reformation and now she's standing upon her feet oh how i wish i had time to go back into ezekiel look at where he goes he said oh how i wish i had time to go back into ezekiel and pull out them dry bones and show you can these bones live again he said prophesy how can prophecy come only through a prophet it's the word of the lord hear you dry bones the word of the lord and sin your skin came upon them and they stood up a mighty army and began to march toward zion glory to god that's him that's him the victory what's him what is him he's showing it it's an ezekiel dry bones he said the church went down through four messengers through for the the locust the palmer worm the cankerworm amen oh it ate down the bride tree because the bride drew came forth the glorious bride tree but she never fulfilled her purpose before she fell like eve never fulfilled a purpose before she fell and now through four stages it ate down and it went to utter death in the dark ages only a little life left in the root but through the reformation through luther through wesley through pentecost he's brought it up through three stages but the fourth stage is he himself and what's he saying he says that's him that's him that's the victory what is it it's his body coming in the resurrection just like the first time it was typed when jesus resurrected from the dead now his body the word the word bride is resurrecting like ezekiel's dry bones and what did they resurrect as friends what did they come back as those bones went down they were dry you couldn't recognize them you didn't know what they were remember when the prophecy came when the word came through a prophet bone came to bone sin you in flesh and they rose up and then the wind came the fourth stage was the very life itself [Music] justification sanctification baptism in the holy ghost to the person of the holy ghost himself and in the fourth stage what had been bound for nearly 2000 years is now loosed by the evening time message back in the bride again and what did they come back as they come back as an army they come back as an army why these four stages was bringing the army back to what to fight the battle to forgive the final blow to antichrist to defeat him for the gentile bride praise be to god god is good friends thank you for bearing with me i want to go through a couple slides and i'll pull us the highlights because i want us to capture what we talked about let's look at a few things here i'm just pulled little excerpts out of quotes may the holy spirit come down now the white horse rider there's only one original color anything else is mixed christ is on a solid white unadulterated word from the beginning i hope that we can get away from traditional thinking traditional denominational thinking and listen to what the prophet is saying how is he describing these things how is he timing it what scriptures is he using what terms is he using let's look at what he's saying and when i do this i'm not denying it all a physical manifestation of a battle of armageddon in palestine i'm not saying that but let's think about that do you really think in that physical manifestation that jesus will come from heaven riding on a white horse with a sword out of his mouth and he's cutting the heads off all the captains no in israel every time god says you don't fight i'll fight for you what did he do did they see anything they didn't see anything what he did is he calls them to run away afraid he calls them to turn their swords on each other and kill each other amen that's how he comes and fights when god fights amen that's how he fights they never saw god god said you stay behind the walls i'll destroy this enemy you'll not see them no longer and they caused a noise they heard a noise they got scared they turned their swords on each other and this may just meet brother chad but i don't believe amen even in a physical manifestation gathered in palestine that you're going to see a white horse and a giant jesus with a giant sword out of his mouth hitting everybody but his word has already prophesied their demise his word has already prophesied their doom when they gather together in a fulfillment of the word the word is going to slay them and they i believe they're going to turn their swords on each other and fire nuclear bombs at one another cause volcanoes they'll go up and destroy the earth with fire because god brother man said god doesn't god god doesn't destroy man man destroys himself and he said man will create his own hell a burning fiery hell upon this earth amen before the millennial reign that's just me that's just bonus sorry there's only one original color anything else is mixed christ is on a solid white unadulterated word from the beginning christ rode his church right into glory in the resurrection revelation 19 the next time the church is hurt she comes also not upon exactly horses christ has a sharp sword and watch it comes from his mouth the living word that's the word of god revealed to his servants and when christ comes with the sword for it is his word that proceeds out of his mouth he will slay every enemy there is before him and the same word will rise in power coming forth from his lips of jesus christ and it shall slay him and everything before him and christ is gathering his heaven-born subjects saints under what he's gathering them under the last trumpet the final trumpet the seventh trumpet from the seventh angel when he comes he's going to be called the word of god riding upon a white horse and the followers of heaven will be behind him if you're an ambassador from heaven all heaven's behind you in heaven is consisted of the word let all those things soak in say what brother i'm talking about he's talking about a battle that's going on now the trumpet sounded heaven was open christ the word has returned the holy spirit is here he's riding his church in the resurrection was he resurrected or he's resurrected or out of dead denominationalism he has resurrected saints i believe wholeheartedly in a physical resurrection with all my heart i believe the elements will come back together that were ordained to be those saints and they will rise and we will see them in a physical form but i'm telling you the church has resurrected the bride has come back the church has resurrected out of dead denomination we've come to the fourth stage the capstone the fourth stage of the journey when his life has come back in and she's rose a mighty marching army that has gathered under the last trumpet and she's now fighting the devil with the sword of the spirit the word of the lord don't miss the battle friends it's not about anything in the flesh this battle has come down to your personal revelation of jesus christ and your relationship with him who you are who he is in you you and him him and you not the tangible things but the invisible things have to become the reality today that's the gentile way and i'll read this last scripture and the god of peace shall bruce satan under your feet shortly bruise to break into shivers to tear apart to destroy he will do that how under your feet shortly the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amen let's all stand musicians if you could come good like what happened at the opening of the seals the trumpet blew it declared spiritual war but which war not another battle not another battle in the string of battles but the last battle the last face off the last fight the last war for the gentile bride and christ will be victorious because he's come down with a sword in his mouth which is the living word that he's given to his servants because that sword came into the hand of a prophet and that sword that comes out of his mouth is now in the bride and what are you supposed to do with it destroy the antichrist what's christ coming to do destroy the antichrist where is he going to do it where is he going to do it what horse is he riding where is he going to destroy what vessel is he going to use he's going to destroy it with this vessel right here he's going to use me he's going to use me to destroy the antichrist every time i face the antichrist the word will destroy the antichrist what is the antichrist the antichrist is not the banker the antichrist is not a government official the antichrist is not a hostile cohort the antichrist is not an unruly loved one the antichrist is anything that's against the word and we've been given a sword he's come with a sword out of his mouth a living word amen given to his servants amen and now that word is in the bride and christ is here the holy ghost is here the white horse rider to do what to slay the antichrist the slain with what with the word that's why brother brenham said she'll have the word and the word only no more reasoning no more church doctrine no more denominational understanding but the word and the word only will slay the antichrist when the last one comes in and everything is finished the antichrist spirit's been destroyed from off the away from the bride then those elements of the ground that were meant to be our brothers and sisters or form bodies again and they will come up out of the graves i'm looking to do my part now i've heard the trumpet i've heard the call and i said god use me lord i can do nothing in myself i'll tell you something that's interesting it's not you it's him but it's you but it's him but it's you but it's him do you understand what i'm saying we know we can't do it we know we're incapable we know we're a failure to begin with we know that we're going to mess it up but yet he said i'm going to do it through you nobody else it's you but it's him but he's going to use you but it's him it's not you it's him but he's doing using you that's why brother barron said i'm not the one who did those things i'm not the one i was only standing near when he did it the man said i can't discern the thoughts and because i can't tell you where you were yesterday i can't i can't know your name it has to be him doing it but yet he did it through the prophet it was the prophet but it was him but it was him but it was brother branham but it was brother but it was him and it's the same relationship today it's you it's in you it's through you it's with you god is riding you he's using you to accomplish this purpose in this day the word is in you the holy spirit is upon you christ himself is using his bride this day to defeat his enemy but it's not you but it's you but it's not you oh my what a paradox man he's got to have you he's ordained you it's going to happen through you amen but it's not going to be you doing it it's going to be him doing it through you that's why brother branham amen he wouldn't use his own mind any time he tried to use his own reasoning he got himself in trouble and he would come back and tell you what he did wrong he had to get to a place where he was surrendered where it wasn't him it was christ through him and it's not going to be us this man here this man here it's going to be christ working in the part of his word he's ordained for this day christ in you the hope of glory let him do it stay with the word recognize your position make your calling and election sure for the battle is over your revelation of who you are who christ is in this day and the battles over that revelation and let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus i pray god that you would just help us help us to catch what you're telling us in this hour lord what your prophet has shared with us the words that he used the phrases lord show it to us lord that we might understand our position in the army today who we are what you're trying to accomplish what you're trying to do show it to us now father for we need you lord we cannot do anything in ourselves we can do nothing lord it has to be you doing it through us but yet we know that you've ordained vessels in this hour you've ordained us to be here and we want to yield to you and ask that you would have greater preeminence lord lord you've given us your word help us to use that word forgive us lord for when we used our minds forgive us when we've had traditional thinking lord and we've fallen back on previous understanding forgive us for those things lord but help us to take your word in every situation help us to take your word for everything in our life and help us to overcome by the word lord may it be you overcoming through us bless every vessel that's here lord if there's any here who haven't made their calling in election sure lord i pray you prick their heart and speak to them now they can't give themselves a revelation all they can do is come in desperation but lord if they cry out to you i pray you would come lord in their hour of desperation and i pray you would reveal yourself personally to them and show them who they are where they belong where they came from and where they're going what it is we're supposed to be doing in this hour have your victory through us we are your victory lord this resurrected church that has come back in this last day come back to the original this is your victory lord continue to have victory through us let us be the word let us live the word use us for your glory as we go from here bless us and keep us in jesus christ's name we pray amen we sing god has got a bride oh well god has got a bride that's marching through the slant with praises in her mouth and healing in her hand everlasting joy and gladness in her heart i've well god has got a bride that's marching through this land with raises in her mouth [Music] [Applause] [Music] i've i got that's a reality friend not a song but a reality that i've got a part in this bride i'm part of the prophecy in ezekiel's dry bones it's talking about me today that he's resurrected a bride and i'm part of that he's come the sword is here amen the white horse rider is here amen the armies of heaven are here the battle is on amen and it's on in me give us victory lord let us see our position let us stay in our position don't let spiritual amnesia creep back in don't forget who you are and what's going on in this hour and don't look forward for something to shift something to change when i see euphrates dry up when i see a gathering friends it's already happened for the bride amen in the spiritual realm it's already happened the kings have crossed over they're in the ecclesiastical realm the battle is on lucifer and michael are facing off again and christ is riding his church in the glory in the resurrection he's resurrected me as he resurrected you we are his victory oh let's sing that again god bless you saints well god has got a bride that's marching through this land with praises in her mouth [Applause] [Music] joy and guess what she's an invincible army and what makes her an invincible army is because she has the word and the word cannot be defeated anywhere anytime under any indication under any circumstances can the word of god be defeated and the word has been restored to the bride if we'll just stand on that word and if we'll just take that word and apply that word to every situation and push back every antichrist spirit with the sword of the spirit this will be an invincible army an antichrist will be thoroughly completely defeated by the word of god [Music] she and the word are so much alike until they become one and you become the word by letting the word flow through you just let the word flow through you let what christ revealed to you let it be true don't let your mind resist it don't let your mistakes uh take you away from it but let what christ has said about you and what he's revealed in your heart let it be the truth that i am part of this bride god bless you we're going to come back for communion at four o'clock of communion and foot washing we'll also have [Music] an update from the mission board they haven't done that in a while so one of the brothers will give us an update and then we'll go right into the song service god bless you saints we'll see you back at four let's sing this as we go god has got a bride that's marching through this land with crazies in her mouth everlasting joy and gladness in her heart i've got a heart one more time that's [Music] one more time
