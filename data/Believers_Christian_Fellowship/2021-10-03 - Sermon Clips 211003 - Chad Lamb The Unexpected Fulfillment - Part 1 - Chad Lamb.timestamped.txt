[1:39] be fulfilled in her and now she was
[1:41] going to be carrying the word now the
[1:44] word was going to be in her
[1:47] and here she comes walking around
[1:49] pregnant amen and and she is the
[1:52] fulfillment of the prophecy but because
[1:54] they didn't expect the prophecy to be
[1:55] fulfilled that day their interpretation
[1:57] and the fulfillment didn't match so they
[1:59] reject the interpretation and start
[2:01] rumors and lies about how she was
[2:03] impregnated
[2:09] what are they claiming listen what are
[2:11] the lies telling you the lies are
[2:12] telling you that that's some man seeding
[2:14] her
[2:18] but that was no man's seed in her that
[2:20] was the the seed christ amen that was
[2:22] within her
[2:24] and brother benham comes with the
[2:26] seventh seal and he says ah you think
[2:28] something like that would be priest in
[2:29] the vatican but it comes like john the

[2:41] god help us not to keep missing it
[2:44] open our eyes lord and let us see what's
[2:46] happening all around us amen
[2:48] let us recognize our day and its message
[2:51] let us recognize what you're doing in
[2:52] this hour and let us god wash away
[2:55] denominational understanding out of our
[2:57] mind wash away intellectual reading out
[3:00] of our mind and give us your revelation
[3:02] on the word eyes to see and ears to hear
[3:05] because we must have it in this hour
