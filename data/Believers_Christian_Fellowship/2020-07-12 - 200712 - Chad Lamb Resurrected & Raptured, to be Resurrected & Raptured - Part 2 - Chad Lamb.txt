the lord it's our desire isn't above all let it be according to your word be it unto me amen we want to match that word remember we'll let you be seated for just a minute i want to remind everybody that the reception will be this afternoon for josiah and zoe uh josiah and zoe mcnulty sorry i almost said zoe greeley god bless you sorry about that the reception will be in the fellowship hall at three three to six this afternoon so i would remind everybody for that don't forget that and also i forgot to say last week but we started sunday school last week so god bless you all who get to go back to sunday school and god bless our sunday school teachers and when they waited a long time so i'm sure they're loaded up with material ready to teach amen so thank god for that then also i wanted to thank all those who came out yesterday for the work day i got a couple pictures i'd like to show we had quite a crew show up and the trustees had worked together to organize a workday to get a lot of things done and and there was a lot of people and they got a lot of things done and so we thank god for that here's a group ceiling cracks in the parking lot you see brother moses down there digging it out and painting doors painting doors you know cleaning gutters screwing screws on the roof dryer supervising something looking up in a hole picking up sticks pressure washing outside and so there was a lot of things i mean a lot of things got done in a very short amount of time so we appreciate everybody who came out we had a good group of brothers the trustees did a good job organizing it several of the trustees wives put together a lunch afterwards there's a good group of men there working and here's another group and i just want to say thank you and i think as a church we should thank them for what they've done for all of us and then it's nice to see i mean even though it's physical work it's carnal but still we come together because we've got a vested interest together amen to have a place where we can worship god a place where we can fellowship together around the things of god and i appreciate those who sacrifice for the rest of the body may god bless you and thank you for that man let's all stand now and let's go to the word thank you musicians ephesians chapter 2. let's start there i want to continue on with the the same subject we were talking about wednesday resurrected and raptured to be resurrected and raptured and then i didn't get into my subject like i thought that i would and that's fine by me i'm perfectly happy that way when god takes over and the anointing moves in a different direction i'm very very grateful for that that's what we pray for amen that's what we want but i feel comfortable coming back to this subject and going on and we'll just see how far we get this time amen but but god be praised we want him to take control ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the prince the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins and quick and dead and sins hath quickened us together with christ for by grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through christ jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them amen let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for yet another opportunity to come and hear your word preached god we know that this is a method by which you've chosen to save souls this is the method by which you've chosen to speak to your children lord one of the methods and god would just ask that you would take complete control that you would move the man to the side lord and that you would come and the power of your holy spirit and that you would minister through a gift you've placed into a clay vessel and god that you would break the bread for us afresh this morning and that we would have our eyes open to see you as you are gone take preeminence over everything that'll be said lord lord speak through our lips and hear through our ears lord that we might receive truth the truth that you want for us and may that truth change us from glory unto glory we love you and we ask for your blessings in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can have your seats i'm going to read the same quote i've read wednesday and then see how far we get i think i've read it wednesday and last sunday and we'll see if we can move further by the grace of god it is in the message it is the rising of the sun it said waving of the sheaf what was the sheaf the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheaf hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because i live ye live also speaking to his wife because i live ye live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power amen so so now when we there's coming forth brother bram said in his time he was speaking there in 1965 there's coming forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism so he's speaking of a resurrection amen a resurrection out of dead denominationalism because at this point denominationalism had died amen it had brought death and had run its full cycle of death and now brother branham is standing here at the end of the laodicean church age and saying and now he's saying now this is a resurrection out of dark denominationalism and and now when he when he come to this resurrection in the first resurrection when jesus christ raised from the dead amen he came back amen as a pillar of fire on the day of pentecost and he came back to confirm the word and confirm the promise amen and the disciples are able to pick it up and say this is joel this is that this is that and he comes forth to prove the word or to confirm the word or to manifest the word and so in that resurrection he come forth in the manifestation of the word and in this one he says for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people it says because i live ye live also and so now we see that like we talked about last time now the word amen has been brought back into full effect now the word has been brought back into the full revelation of the word now the word is living amen the whole book is made alive by the revelation of the word amen it was it was darkened amen by creeds and dogmas and ideas of man amen through through all kinds of churches and denominationalism had darkened the word and the word had went into obscurity amen and it laid dormant through the dark ages as if as if it was lost as if it was dead amen but through luther luther brother said you see just a little sprig start to come out of the ground amen and it grew through through wesley through the pentecostal age amen to come back to seed again come back to the full measure of the word amen and when when he says that when we come back to the full measure of the word now he says because i live ye live also amen when when jesus christ resurrected and lived amen he was telling his disciples you'll know i'll come to you i'll be the comforter and i'll come to you and because i live ye live also and in this day because that word lives i live also and so for me what i want to see amen more than anything what gives me courage what what places me is to see the word live when i see the word live amen i live also when the when the when it comes from obscurity and darkness and shadow and moves into the fullness of its light amen when it comes to light and comes to life i come to light and i come to life because whatever that word is i am too amen brother bam says in the message god's provided place of worship now notice when this great moving power of god comes into a son of god it quickens him the spirit of life enters into him then what does it do it seats them in heavenly places right now not they will be we are now now we've already resurrected we've already resurrected the question is have you resurrected because the title is uh resurrected and raptured to be resurrected and raptured and we'll just cut to the chase if we can't in this day come to a resurrection and a rapture amen there's no point sitting on our heels waiting for something to happen amen the something that will happen is already happening it's already testified of it in our soul amen something's changed something's quickened to life proving that there's going to come another change praise be to god so to me it's important to catch what's going on now not to constantly be looking for what's going to happen amen because what's going to happen is testified by what has happened and what has happened is testifying to what will happen amen so we can get our focus on what god did in the past or what will happen in the future and miss what he's doing right now and if we miss what he's doing right now we're missing the very mechanism that will get us to where he needs us to be and where we want to be so we can constantly be looking like i want to go there i can't wait till my items change i can't wait to make it to the millennium and i'm just sitting here waiting waiting waiting waiting and if we're sitting in that state we're missing the very method by which he's using to get us there always waiting we'll never arrive with that attitude that's why the devil will constantly project out and project out and project down and get get us blind to what's going on right in front of us what's all around us what's happening this very moment in time in the believers because if it can get us blind to this that's this thing that's happening now this word that's bringing a life to the people to quicken the life inside them that will bring them to all of those things but if the devil can get us to focus there our focus there and miss what's happening here he he knows that if we don't catch what's happening now and we don't move move with the spirit now and move where god's moving now we will never make it to the thing we're focusing on and it'll constantly be kicking the can down the road and kicking the can down the road it'll always be the carrot on the stick i'm always just the donkey's just walking to get to the carrot and look something's still there it's still there he's never arrived i say how do i know how do i know that my atoms are going to change because i've already resurrected because the rapture started with a shout and i heard the shout and it moved me into a different condition it raptured me out of dead denominationalism it raptured me out of laodicea it brought me into the bright age it quickened something inside of me to life that's how i know for sure that my atoms are going to change i'm not aimlessly following a stick with a string and a carrot and some promise before and just aimlessly moving around hoping someday to get it i will get it amen i've already eaten the carrot spiritually i've already tasted amen that the lord is good i already know and then i've already experienced it and i'm going to experience it see the prophet of god told us that that the biggest trouble he sees in the church sometimes is fear and and he says some of these things come to take the scare away because there's so much scare of i'm not really a child of god i'm not going to make it i'll be left behind and i'm not going to be good enough and all of these all of these silly things that have nothing to do with it amen when we really what brother branham has done for us what god has done for us through the ministry of brother banham what god has done for us is he's taken the mystery away from the new birth so we can actually understand what our new birth actually is let's just keep reading here in the easter seal 1965 are we if we are ordained on that ground if we are ordained to be on that ground like the eagle walking in the chicken's nest if you're ordained on that ground the holy spirit is here to find you who finds who the holy ghost is here to find you if you were ordained before the foundation of the world the holy ghost is here to find you amen you can't be lost you can no more be lost and god can be lost if you're carrying within your soul a portion of god an attribute of god a gene of god and part of the life of god part of the word of god and to me i don't care what terminology you attach to it it's all the same thing it is part of god it is the life of god it is it is the word of god it is the light of god it is god and if they're carrying that around in your soul how can you be lost but god is here the holy ghost is here seeking you out and we'll find you amen there's no there's no misses amen there's no almost with god it's a sure thing because it was short before the foundation the world he's seeking you out and we'll find you so the holy spirit is here to find you and when it finds you you recognize its call oh praise god it wasn't my efforts in finding something that brought the holy ghost to me but the holy ghost came to me and found me and when it found me i recognized its call [Music] you see it takes it it takes the the all the pressure and all the scare away because we're responding to his call we're responding all that the father has given me shall come to me all that the father will draw amen it's not that we were trying to draw the father the father was drawing us it wasn't that we were trying to make something happen god was making something happen and see the the gospel can get preached in such a way amen that we're constantly feeling like i haven't put forth enough effort yet i haven't tried hard enough yet i haven't yet found what i'm supposed to find and not realizing that the thing that you're supposed to find is the thing that's supposed to find you and when it finds you a minute quicken something inside so you recognize what it is that just found you amen and when it finds you you recognize this call you know the hour you're living you know that these things are supposed to happen quickly you're raptured up to meet it and now you're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus oh what a promise what a heavenly father who would give us these things so based on that quote based on what the prophet of god has said i i'm raptured there's a part of me that's already raptured seated in heavenly places in christ jesus you know when when that holy ghost finds you when it finds you you recognize his call you know the hour you're living you know these things are supposed to happen quickly you're raptured up to meet it praise be to god i think that gives us permission to stop kicking the can down the road and start living in the benefits that's been given to us in the message it is the rising of the sun from 1965 and now see now you are already resurrected when god raised up when god raised him up he raised you the son is just now on you and now you're growing into a blossom life like he was to be resurrected completely in the last day your potentials you have now why do you you're why do you know your soul changed didn't it your body come obedience to it didn't it in obedience to what what a church the word which is the life i'm going to repeat that again the word which is the life the word which is the life then you are now resurrected from the dead i'll take that as true for me you are now resurrected from the dead you heard the call you recognized and messed with your hour you quickly you were raptured up to meet it amen i have been resurrected and raptured amen amen you are now resurrected from the dead it is easter with jesus and i it's easter with you and jesus it's easter with you i and jesus jesus you and i we are all resurrected together amen now brother ben says in the uh works his faith expressed 1965 he said i'm two separate people i'm body soul and spirit three separate people but i'm only one makes me as a being and questions and answers in 1964 he says see you're a dual person three people in one soul body and spirit 1965 and things that are to be he says there's three people of you the outside is the body you got five senses you that you contact your earthly home with that the inside is a spirit there's five senses there love conscious and so forth you contact but the inside of that is the soul and the reason i i want to bring this up and mention this is brother ben very clearly says he says you're three people but you're one he says there are three people in one there's three people of you he says this and if you notice almost all the quotes all but one quote that i'm going to use today all comes from 1964 and 1965 because after the opening of the seals brother branham was honing down amen on this content he was honing down on this revelation and his understanding because he was taking the mystery away from who we are he was really peeling back the mystery of who we are amen because down through the denominational ages amen we thought that we were people who who were sympathetic to a line of preaching and had agreed with that line of preaching and therefore by agreeing with that line of preaching we were now saved and born again that was the denominational understanding that's why the denominations today amen will bang on doors and do rallies and do any kind of trick or mechanism to get people into a church to sit down amen and listen because the whole goal is to get the people there to mentally accept and acknowledge what's being preached and if they mentally accept and acknowledge a historical fact that there was a man named jesus which was god made in flesh who came and died for them if they can mentally accept that and agree with that and say with their mouth that i believe that's true for me then now they're saved and can be born again and are born again believers and that's the darkness of denominationalism because the darkness and denominationalism takes the whole plan of god amen and rested on your ability to mentally accept something or an understanding amen and now brother brahms coming at the end of the ministry and he's peeling back the mystery taking the cloak off of that amen because that's why that's why you find sometimes in denominationalism there's almost a desire to beg somebody just agree with what i'm telling you just just repeat after me just say and somehow there's an actual belief that if i can get you to repeat words out of your mouth that you're now saved and born again you're a new creature in christ jesus and how do words coming out of a mouth amen obligate god to fill you with the spirit i understand what i'm saying or preaching a historical fact that jesus came and died on calvary and if you accept that you can be saved and be born again hey that's part of the word that's part of that's absolutely the foundation for our redemption but just being able to recognize yes that that happened and i believe it's true and he died for the sins of the world absolutely that's the truth amen that that's not the mystery of redemption that's not the mystery of being born again becoming a new creature brother branham takes the mask off of that and he says it wasn't what you agreed with in a preacher it wasn't what you said at a campaign it wasn't an action you took or a pledge you made amen really the only way that you can ever be born again amen is there had to be a seed gene of god in your soul from before the foundation of the world it was part of god and god came seeking it out amen and the way that god was going to quicken that is there was a seed word predestinated for a certain age so god was going to have a revealed word preached in a certain age and when these two came together it was going to unlock the faith that was already laying in your heart and when that unlocked you were able to say that ain't nothing but the truth i believe that's the truth amen not by mental not by verbal amen but by a seed coming to life in the soul and that is the mystery of the new birth and what brother branham did what god did through brother adam is peeled away the mystery of denominationalism and that's why you can see that's why in the denominationalism they'll just they'll beg their children just come to church with me just come to church with me if i can just get them to hear and agree with it listen if there's a seed there the holy ghost will find it the holy ghost will find it what we need to do is not beg and not plead but just let the light shine to share the word just have faith and believe that not one will miss it that he won't lose one amen that ev that the holy ghost will find every predestinated seed amen we almost scare people into receiving christ but what did they receive by the scare what did they receive they received an idea they received a concept but how can you receive christ without receiving the word amen they are one and the same amen so too many times there's a temptation to separate the word and separate the spirit but in this quote we read as the rising of the sun he says your body came in obedience to it didn't it and obedience to what the church the word which is the life because jesus said the words i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life there's too much of a temptation to separate the word and the spirit or say you know if you if if it just this way we just got to get you in contact with the spirit that's all if you just get in contact with the spirit amen then the spirit will lead and guide you into all truth and then you'll find the word but that's not the way brother bannon preached it in 1965 at the end of his ministry that's not the way he preached it he said the word comes to you and unlocks the mystery you're born again amen not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god that you're washed by the water of the word amen that without the word amen the word and the spirit go together amen when you receive the word you receive the spirit when you reject the word you reject the spirit and so so there's a pentecostalism that says if i can just get you in contact with the spirit amen that spirit will lead you and guide you all the truth that's absolutely right the spirit will lead and guide you on all truth amen but it takes the truth coming to you to quicken that seed the life amen to connect with the spirit and the spirit will continue to lead and guide you into all truths amen we can't separate the spirit in the word brother man now he's telling us there's three people of you you're three people in one now when we start preaching like this and start talking about this really we're just using terms and those terms are so um incapable of accurately explaining the full truths we'll say it like this the revelation the the the revelation of the word is pure or i should say it like this the the the word is pure the word is god and the word is pure and the best way for me to understand a pure god is by divine revelation because divine revelation is pure but god wants his word preached and he wanted it written in book form and so now the purity has to be diminished i don't mean that sacrilegious in any way but whenever you take this perfect this pristine this crystal clear perfect word of god and you bring it down into any form of human language you have just lowered it from that pristine perfect state because human language isn't perfect [Applause] it's flawed and our understanding of it is flawed and so now it's come down amen into a mechanism god's going to use to promote his word by by the written word and the spoken word and preaching of the word amen but the only way to get back to the pure is when through the mechanism of human language god quickens something inside amen and brings a divine revelation from the father it connects you back to the higher form which is god himself does that make sense so when we start preaching we start using terms even brother bam starts using terms brother ben will flip-flop his terms he'll say it one way amen and if you lock in on it when he flips and says and uses other terminology or uses a or phrases it exactly the opposite it puts us in a situation where when we bind ourselves by human language we now must make a choice between a or b he said it this way and then he said it this way i must make a choice between a and b and it is not a choice between a and b he's just trying to use limited language a man with a seventh grade education born in kentucky amen fluent in hillbilly trying to express what he's seeing and what he's seeing is more than what he's capable of saying amen and so the terminology will flip and he'll use this term and he'll use that term he'll explain it this way one time and explain it this way another time amen the bible does the same thing when the bible refers to a seed amen sometimes amen the seed is you and sometimes the seed is the word that's being preached right same term but if you fixate on one and exclusive to the other amen you've missed the point the point is not the definition of the term the point is the revelation that's trying to be expressed [Applause] and so i feel like so many times we divide one another we divide against one another based off our quotes and our terminology instead of actively saying god revealed to me what this prophet is trying to explain i want to catch the revelation of what he's saying and why is he saying it this way amen not not this quote versus this quote and now we're at war one another because i believe he said it this way that's it i believe he said it this way that's it and they're probably both true if we could just fly higher above language amen and catch the divine revelation of what's being said i don't think brother branham's changing his mind especially from you know one week to the next and so when we begin to use terms like you're three people and one i mean what does that even mean you could we could go one person can go one way with this one person can go another way but just hang on let's try to catch the revelation of what's being said now there's three parts of you or three people of you or three whatever i don't care what you call it call it parts call it phases call it operations call it you can call anything you want but there's three parts body soul and spirit and brother branham is starting to talk about the the soul amen and what takes place in the soul and he says now in the message in the message the quote that we read out of the rising of the sun he said the sun is just now on you and now you're growing into a blossom life like he was to be resurrected completely in the last day your potentials you have now why do you know your soul changed didn't it and that's what i want to look at for a minute your soul changed didn't it and and there's a resurrection of the life in the soul there's a rapture in the soul there's three parts of you there's a soul amen and and men have souls but some men have souls that contain a portion of the life of god and some men have souls that don't and you can't change that amen and then brother talks about your spirit and we'll get that a minute that spirit is just a worldly spirit or a spirit of the earth an earthly spirit that's given to you in this life and when you die it breaks up and goes and then you have a body and this body is going to have to be changed the atoms in this body will have to be changed into a glorified condition right your spirit will break up and go because you have a spirit body a theophany eternal in the heavens and so you will be triune being you will be three persons you will be you i'll say this born again soul resurrected soul spirit body theophany and glorified body changed body flesh body all right amen so that being the case i'm gonna i'm just gonna i'm gonna use phrases and terms but don't fixate on when i say catch what i'm saying that your first body change is your born-again experience in the soul your first body change your first resurrection in rapture is the change that takes place when light amen the word for the hour the light the spirit of god whatever term you want to use i don't care what term you use but when that light strikes the seed that's in the soul it springs forth to life i mean that's the first body change your soul changed it was it changed amen now let's keep let's keep going i want to stay on this brother brahm says in the true easter seal from 1961 it says now we are resurrected today we are in 1961 we are resurrected today absolutely why can we have such a time over the things of god because we're resurrected those who he foreknew he called those who he called he justified those we justified he has glorified then we are now resurrected we are resurrected from the inside out not from the outside in this is so important because because we're we're we're waiting for a resurrection so we can see our dead loved ones so we can get enough faith for our bodies to change we're resurrected from the inside out not the outside in it's not an outside factor that's going to all of a sudden bring me faith what's going to bring me faith is going to be the thing that's been working in me all along we're resurrected from the inside out the first person out or the first body out if i could say it that way it's it's probably not a correct term so don't worry about it just catch what i'm saying amen so for me just the way i see it my first body change was that body of the soul the person of the soul whatever changed not what i was changed here we go then we are now resurrected we are resurrected from the inside out not from the outside in oh do you notice not sealed out this way but sealed in oh my if the church could just see it we're not sealed out we're sealed in them days when the sin was abomination before god there was no appropriation to take it away we were sealed away from him now when that ripped in two and that seal was broke by a sin offering being made from us now we're baptized inside and sealed inside we are resurrected praise god i'm resurrected i've been caught up in the heavenly places why amen because i was sealed inside and i'm resurrected from the inside out so the resurrection and the rapture has already happened for me in the soul now that amen that change will affect another change and that other change will be my body will be changed into a glorified condition but you see i can't fixate on one until i first come to the first some day someday someday i'm telling you if someday hasn't already happened for you you've got your eyes on the wrong place i mean we need to come back to the inside man and say god i need something for you that will quicken me to life i need something from you that will change me amen that will change me from the inside out so now we are baptizing inside and sealed inside we are resurrected we are now resurrected already resurrected how do you know the bible said so amen we are now resurrected we are now raised with him in spiritual resurrection what does the word quicken mean quicken means resurrection that's right we're already resurrected right now setting together in heavenly places in christ jesus enjoying the easter seal i'm glad i can believe that amen now this is the quote that i was referring to earlier in the message leadership 1965 your spirit breaks up when you die it takes its flight but your soul lives on so brother brahms referring to this why because we bypassed our theophany amen and when we came to this earth to be tempted we were given a spirit an earthly spirit a spirit of the world amen so that we could face temptation but we have that spirit body already waiting eternal in the heavens so there's three persons of you so and the message knoweth it not in 1965 it says now this outside man is the flesh that's what we look at what we see and it has five inlets to the body any grammar school child as myself would know there there is five senses controlling the body see taste feel smell and hear without that you can't touch the body that's the only way you have to the body see taste feel smell here you see it taste it feel it now this is the evil one on the outside now inside of that is a spirit which you become when you're born in the earth and the breath of life is breathed into him the spirit is of a worldly nature because it was not given from god but it was permitted by god now you've got that for every child that's born in the world is born in sin shaped in the nicu we come to the world speaking lies that right so that person inside there is a center to begin with now it's got five inlets and then five inlands i don't know whether i can call them right off first you know is conscience and love and no conscience love reason there's there's five inlets to the spirit you can't think with your body you have to think with your spirit you can't have conscience in your body it has no mental faculties at all your body doesn't so you have to think with your spirit you have to reason you can't reason with your physical being because reason doesn't see taste feel smell or hear reason is what you can make in your mind if you're asleep or you're out your body is laying there dead but your spirit can still reason there is five senses that control the inside man now to the last man which is the soul there is only one sense that controls that and that is free moral agency free will to choose or reject so once again brother telling us that that the outside man that's the flesh amen then the inside man that spirit he said that's a spirit of a worldly nature because it was not given from god it was permitted by god and that's the thing that breaks up and takes its flight when you die you don't need it no more you've got another one he says this last man i love the terminology this last man how many men are you how many persons are you he's he's just trying to explain something now in the message souls that are the souls that are in prison now in 1963 now the soul of the man is not the body of man it's the soul and the soul is something that the nature of the spirit and then when the nature of a man when when we are dead the scripture plainly tells us that we are dead and our lives are hidden god through christ sealed there by the holy spirit now it wasn't that your body died it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit died see the nature which is the soul the nature of your soul is god if you're born again if it's not it's of the world so brother branham is is is just using terms and explaining and we'll just keep moving colossians three we'll see if god can just open to us and share with us the thing that's on my heart colossians 3 and verse 1. colossians 3 and 1. if you then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affection on things above not on things on the earth fear you are dead and your life is hid with christ in god so you are dead and your life is hid in christ with god that's what the scripture brother branham referred to you're dead amen your soul died your soul changed something changed inside an old nature died the seed nature came to life in the in the message the invisible union of the bride of christ 1965 how did you come to this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent eve it's no fault of your own by your natural birth you come after eve who committed adultery that's the reason you was born unadulterous you're a sinner to begin with that's right you was deceived into it no no you it ain't your fault you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world god put your name in the lamb's book of life i mean there's that seed life down in your soul when you come into this earth amen there's a part of god down on the inside of the soul amen and that was to be you but you've come the wrong way amen we didn't come god's originally intended way if we were to come that way amen that's the life that would have dominated from the beginning but of no fault of our own we come amen the wrong way and so now there there's something in the soul that needs to be purged there's a pollution there's a corruption amen there's a pollution there's a corruption and he says it's because of your uh marriage to your adulterous parent eve it's no fault of your own by your natural birth you come after eve who committed adultery you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world and that's the part that god's focused on aren't you glad that that's the part that he's focused on because that's not the part the devil's focused on and that's not the part that we struggle with in our flesh we struggle with the outer man amen we struggle with the spirit realm amen and the devil works on those things but god is interested in what's on the inside of that soul that's a part of himself that he's gathering back to himself it's been sowed into the earth and now he's coming amen the holy ghost is here seeking out that which was lost looking for the lost sheep not trying to convert goats to sheep but he's looking for the lost sheep amen they were already sheep and now they're lost and now he's here seeking out what already belongs to him what is already part of him amen and that's the part that he's focused on and how is he going to awaken that seed how is he going to find it amen he's going to find it by shining the light of the word and when he shines the light of the word amen what what what is laying down in that seed what is the seed gene of god it is god and god is the word and i can use all kinds of terms here but who cares about the terms catch the reality it's godliner god is the word amen so when god comes to find the word that's laying there god brings the word amen and when the word finds the word amen it quickens the life so how does he find it he brings the word for that day the predestinated word for that day and the predestinated word for that day is light it is life it is spirit it is word it is christ it is god it is all of those things because why he's hunting out the counterpart and to find the counterpart he's got to bring something of the original to find the original that's laying there [Music] that's why he brings a messenger in each age that's why he brings a message in each phase that's why he brought a messenger in our age to bring the word for our day that will quicken the seed that's predestinated for this day because the light comes to the light amen the life comes to the life the word comes to the word amen oh praise be to god see we talk about a a new birth but to have a new birth amen uh uh would you just understand it just ignorantly this way if i'm going to have a birth amen and a cat i have to have a cat come to a cat i have to have a dog come to a dog so it's got to be god and god to have a son of god [Applause] amen praise be to god i just love it simple like that and childish like that now let's look at first peter together first peter chapter 1 verse 22. first peter chapter 1 verse 22 seeing ye have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever so brother brahma says or not brother peter says in 1 22 i love it when it all runs together and it all becomes the same thing jesus brother branham paul peter what's the difference it's the word seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptable by the word of god which liveth and bideth forever your first birth came by corruptable seed but your second birth comes of incorruptible seed because the incorruptible seed is already laying there in the soul and you're born again of incorruptible seed by the word of god the word of god is is the mechanism that god uses to bring the birth amen but in verse 22 says see you have purified your souls and obeying the truth because something something you didn't come the original way you didn't come the right way you've come now through through the adulterous parent eve has now started something in the earth and now the children of god are coming in a way that god did not originally intend for them to come and they're coming now when something in their soul needs to be purified now he says you have to purify your soul amen and so god has to come down amen and purify the soul and quicken the seed to life and bring it to life and i know i've heard it taught before about an exchange of the soul that the seed is the soul and and the first one dies it goes away and is annihilated and dissolved completely and a new soul grows out of the sea that's in the inside i don't believe that and the reason i don't believe that is you've purified your souls amen if that was the case that's the only inside that creates a new soul does it need to be purified why would you purify what's already pure so there's something wrong through the birth there's something wrong that come all the way back in the garden of eden now we've come in a way that something has to happen to purify our souls and and when it purifies our souls now by the word of god there's a new birth of incorruptible seed man that's just the way i see it amen that's just the way it comes to me or else why would there be salvation for the soul the soul is lost has to be saved why would the soul need to be redeemed amen there's something wrong with the soul it's got to be purified by the fire of god we'll read that in a minute it's got to be redeemed it's got to be saved salvation has to come to the soul amen not not a not another soul not an exchange of soul amen but that soul has the seed the gene of god woven into the fabric of the essence of who you are and god has to bring a purifying fire to burn away the old nature the corruption that is set in so the incorruptable seed can spring forth the life by the word of god that's the way i understand the message is where i understand the scriptures amen that's the saving of a soul the purifying of a soul brother bam says in in future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride he says remember the holy ghost descended on jesus which jesus was a part of the earth why the germ of god the life of god was designed in the womb of a woman that's right which was the earth all right and then the life of god come in so he was the beginning of the creation of god see and then that blood of god that was there by that germ when it was shed at calvary dropped back upon the earth what for to redeem the earth now it's been justified it's been sanctified called and claimed announced to be received its baptism of fire and cleansed for jesus and his bride so brother ma'am's talking about the future home that we're coming through there's he's already washed it amen in water and noah's flood he's already dropped blood on it when jesus christ came and dropped his blood for sanctification but there's going to be a holy fire from god that burns it off at the end of the millennium amen to cleanse this earth amen to purify the earth for jesus and his bride and brother is running this in parallel as a type of our new birth and brother says and you are these other parts that's drawn out of this earth the earth you're a part of the earth your body your soul is part of god an attribute of god displayed here on the earth in a body the body is to be redeemed now the soul is redeemed because it was in sin because it was in sin so god come down by a process of justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and redeemed your soul so the same thing that he does to the earth he does to you same thing he does to the earth he does to you justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost in the message things that are to be in 65 now the next thing you receive was the baptism of the holy ghost and fire now god when this millennium is over god is going to give the world a baptism of fire it's going to blow the whole thing up the heaven and earth will be on fire peter said so and the thing will have a baptism of fire renovation of the whole thing and then there'll be a new heavens and a new earth that's when they'll dwelleth righteousness that's where we are we have become from mortal beings from time beings to eternal beings when the word of god lit our souls when the word of god that fire of god the light of god it's all the same thing the light of god the fire of god amen it lit when that when the word of god lit our souls we become sons and daughters of god with the attributes the gene of god in us to be sons and daughters of the father god in heaven crying abba father my god my god in my father's house there's something laying there amen like the earth is an attribute of god and god is not going to destroy the earth and do away from it when god says he's going to destroy the earth what he's talking about is destroying the surface of the earth and reforming it to a place where he and his bride can live he's not annihilating the earth and the fact that he can even call it annihilation but he's annihilating the surface of the earth and burning off all impurity and all germs that's why the holy fire falls from god out of heaven and that's why the holy fire falls at the end of the millennium is to purge it to burn it to purify it so that it's a proper dwelling place for christ and his bride to live together and he does the same thing for our souls he comes down in justification and sanctification but when the word lit into our souls when he comes down with the holy fire of god he is burning out amen all the impurities he's purifying amen to make it a fit place for him and his bride to live together i in you and you and me you in christ christ and you praise me to god brother bam says in the god of this evil age in 1965 he said but let them get the real divine healing the healing of the soul the real divine healing is the healing of the soul amen which makes a new creature passes from death and alive then waiting in this old tabernacle for redemption of the body after the soul has been redeemed grant it lord amen now what how do i know that i'm going to come to a body change amen because i've already changed amen something came and burnt the impurities out of me something came and purified amen my soul something came the word lit into my soul and changed there was an effective change a new birth a new creature a new creation what did it come from amen when you go all the way back to genesis and you find the world covered in water amen it was brother ben said it was burnt over with water strange terminology burnt over with water but it was destroyed but the earth was still there all the elements were still in it but there was a judgment upon the earth from a previous civilization and something had to be washed off amen and so out of the earth could come the life that's already there not crumple up the ball of there throw it away and bring a new one out no take this one and purify it wash it and purify to take the life that's already there because it's an attribute of god and god is not going to do away with his attributes he will wash it he will purify he will redeem it he will purge it and make it a place lived but he will not do away with his attributes [Music] he will make it a fit place to live on and now when we come to the holy fire of god at the millennium he's not burning it down amen to where it's gone no more and then poofy creates a new one no he's burning this one down so that the life that's there can come back out again to make it a fit place a pure place a holy place a sanctified place for he and his bride to live and that's what he's doing in this resurrection and this rapture in our soul he's burning it down burning the old nature out amen burning out the impurities whatever came by coming the wrong way he's burning it out so he can take that life that's laying there and after the impurities are burned out it can spring to life amen and become the control tower down in the soul now we talk about the life down in the soul you know we use terms we're going to go back to this thing with terms we say it's in a dormant state or it's like it's dead you can't kill the life of god it can't ever be dead amen but it's like it's dead it's inactive it's dormant it's just laying there because why brother branham said it's zoe life zoe life is the life of god the life of god can't die but it's laying there waiting waiting waiting waiting for what for the word to light it off for the spark to come for the holy spirit to come for whatever it is to find itself for the scream of the eagle for the word to come to the word for the light to come to the light for the life to come to their life i don't care how you say it it's just waiting for its counterpart to come and come and burn off all of this so that this can spring to life and he says the god who is rich in mercy 1965 many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy or little girl you would walk around and there would be certain things that would just where it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was god somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then and then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from the nomination to the nomination but one day you being part of god you had to be part of the word and when you heard the word you know where you come from you know that was the truth you were always the seed was in you always the word seen the word that was in you [Applause] the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you came to it what happened what happened in your new birth amen the word saw the word the word from the word predestinated saw the word before the foundation of the world i don't know how else the word it amen the word saw the word the life saw the light two omnipotents met yes two parts of god come in contact with one another and triggered a new creation praise god let's go to john chapter 3. amen john chapter 3 and we'll start in verse 1. there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him jesus answered and sent in him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god that means after you're born again you can see it but your eyeballs didn't change because there's another kind of life it's not this life it's this life nicodemus sayeth unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not that i said unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth or where it wills and thou hearst the sound thereof but cast not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit praise god you're a mystery just like the wind they can see the rustle in your life they can hear the effect in your life but they cannot tell where you came from and where you're going amen but you yourself know where you came from and where you're going if you're born again you're just as much a mystery now brother brahma says in the easter seal but he that understands he that knoweth his place in this hour he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath present tense eternal life shall not come into the judgment but his path already passed from death into life then when this new when this new eternal life dwells in you it is the potential or the earnestness of you being being quickened from mortal to immortality let me say that again when this spirit has found you the individual and has come upon you it is the potential of your eternal inheritance that god thought of you and made for you before the foundation in the world that is your potential like if you ask me for an oak tree and give you an acorn the light the life for the oak tree is in the acorn now but you have to wait till it grows up further down the same quote he says now notice it's the earnest or the potential the quickening power of your resurrection when you receive the holy spirit is then dwelling in you the potential of it now you are now on your way growing to the full resurrection no tree just comes up overnight it's got to grow as we grow in grace and knowledge of god you are baptized into the holy spirit now as the pentecostal church baptized in the holy spirit it's begin growing limbs has died they prune them off but the tree is still growing it's still going on because it's got to come to the resurrection they'll they're led by the spirit to quicken the word to you who is believers the word keeps quickening as you come to first limb second limb third limb on up it just keeps quickening the spirit of god keeps quickening to you so brother is telling us when when that life comes into you and the holy spirit comes and you receive it and you're quickened to life he said that's your potential now now you're growing into the full resurrection if i can say this way you've already resurrected and seated with him in the heavenly place you've already raptured up and now you're growing into full resurrection full rapture which will be the change of this body when the atoms change amen and so now what's happening is now the potentials are there amen the seed has sprung to life and now it's got to grow into the full maturity or the full or full manifestation of what's already taken place when it grows to the place where we come to the full resurrection the full rapture those are terms forget the terms but you've already resurrected and you've already raptured but we're waiting for this body for the atoms to change in this body now how are these atoms going to change in this body brother bam said it'll be a revelation how are they going to change because i go sit on a bench and say i'm a child of god and someday god's going to do something magical and poof no we're growing into it now we're growing into the full resurrection now amen the the resurrection of your soul is bringing the resurrection of your body the rapture of your soul is producing the rapture of your body amen it's not that i'm waiting to be raptured you are being raptured right now and if your flesh is not being resurrected and raptured right now you need to go back and check the inside man and make sure there's been a resurrection in there because the resurrection in there brings this outer man subject to the spirit that's on the inside and it begins to grow and grow and feed on the word and grow and grow and as it grows it brings this outside more in line more in line more in line with the word that's why sometimes we make excuses amen in the flesh and say well this is my flesh and someday that will change absolutely someday it'll be completely changed but it should be changing today there should be effective changes taking place in the outside men because of the life on the inside brother bam says in the easter seal he says we are easter oh i'm waiting for easter you are easter what was easter the resurrection of jesus christ what is easter the resurrection of the bride you are easter we are now in our easter we've already raised hallelujah from the things of the world to the things of god's promise not we will we are it's the potentials in the rising of the sun he says now potentially you are resurrected you're resurrected when you receive the holy spirit in you you're resurrected right then your body is the is potentially resurrected oh i hope you catch what i'm saying who is this melchizedek and then when you become subject to that spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seaword made manifest quickened hallelujah made alive and when the bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it there is no question and what is it it's the earnest of the resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started it was once subject to sin and admire and corruption but now it's got the earnest it's turned heavenly now that's the earnest that you're going in the rapture it's the earnest why i'd read it again it's the earnest of the resurrection the body will be raised up again because it's already started that's the key friends it's already started i'm not what i used to be i'm not what i ought to be not what i want to be but i'm not what i used to be it's already started prophet of god said in the rising of the sun but brother when you hear that scream there's something in you your eagle to begin with why you are that seed that the resurrection of the son has dawned and the way the wave sheath upon the earth to make you recognize that you are an eagle and not a denominational chicken you see it if the spirit that raised him from the dead the word the dynamic of the word dwells in you it also quickens your mortal body there's the key it quickens your mortal body now how now how we flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone because quickly while we're yet mortal sinners mortal ready to die these bodies it quickens that body that's quickens brings to life the spirit that once liked to drink run around commit adultery and all these it's quickened why the thing died and you are resurrected it quickens your mortal body therefore your body is the temple of the dynamics because why from the beginning you are part of the mechanics oh there is your resurrection there is the church in the resurrection with him these bodies right now are quickened see you've heard you believe it changed you from a denomination to the word see the the the whole point that i'm trying to drive is that when that word of god for our age when that fire of god came down the spirit the word the life in the word when it come down and burnt off burnt that soul when it when it whatever purge purified it unlocked the mystery that was laying in the soul brother bam said you know when you were a young man and you can fill a fellowship with me on this when you were a young man or girl you just seemingly couldn't do things other kids could do there was something that you couldn't do it and you know maybe you went to a church and you bounced around from here to there but one day you heard the word and you knew it was true see what was that it was always there and god knows how to unlock the potentials that are there and he brings the word the matching part of what it is the word for this day with the word for this day and he brings them through and it sparks the life and when it does amen that quickens your mortal body because you who likes like to commit adultery and tell lies and smoke and drink you don't do that no more what did that a church system know what did that rules and regulations no what did that is there's a new control tower on the inside the life of god is living down out of the soul if i could just use terms uh let me use terms and just catch what i'm saying we talk so much about you know uh receiving the spirit we receive the spirit there's got to be a connection made a spark went off but where was zoe life all the time it was in the soul in the seeding of god zoe life life of god all the time what came to that to quicken it zoe life and you can call it the word you can call it the holy ghost you can call it whatever you want it's the same thing and when it came to quicken that it came to life and what comes to life and manifestation the life of god see now it's not just the life of god coming on but it's the life of god coming out amen the life of god the the mystery that was locked down in our soul unlocked by the word of god unlocked by the baptism the holy ghost now growing and now what's coming out of us spirit of god life of god holy ghost coming out of us friends that's why brother ben says you can receive the baptism the holy ghost every hour of your life and die and go to hell amen because it didn't do anything in the soul realm it was just coming upon coming upon coming upon but there's those that are out there that that spirit will come upon to quicken something that's already in and when it quickens what's already in what's inside will begin to come out and what will come out is the very life and nature of god himself the very portion that is manifested that is ordained to be manifest in this hour will come out so it's not so much that the holy ghost keeps adding and adding and adding the holy ghost unlocks and out comes more and more and more and more it's not so much if i could say it this way then i need the holy ghost to add something to me i need the holy ghost to draw something more out of me is that right mother benham said if you've got the seed of god in you amen all the potential that's in god lays in you only in a portion so i'm not i'm not really asking god add something to me add something to me i've got confidence in what he already put there what what by the preaching of the word by the lifting up of the word what he's doing is drawing that life out of the seed it's already there friends and he's drawing it up and drawing it up and drawing it up and that's why you know going to have an another fix another emotional fix amen another great time is not going to change anything if there's no seed on the inside amen we want to hear him lift it up the word preached in its power god preaching the revelation of the word to unlock more of the life that's already down inside [Applause] the life the potential it's all there it's been resurrected it's been raptured and now it's growing into its full potential and as it grows into its full potential it's taking this outside man and bringing it subject to the word and what do you think the last word will be that it comes subject to the body change the atoms change but it's not going to go from it's not going to go from toddler totting around to body change it's growing and as it grows and as it grows as the life on the inside grows the life on the outside conforms to the life on the inside because it's the control tower that's why if we say we're super revelated and can't overcome sin we need to go back to the basics we say we're super revelated but there's no spiritual growth where there's no change in us i would go back and check my my my baseline i got the revelation of the seventh seal the revelation of seven seals should produce the life of the seven seals the revelation of the word should produce the life of jesus christ the revelation of jesus christ should produce the life of jesus christ if the life of jesus christ is already in there so the life of jesus christ comes to the life of jesus christ to quicken the life of jesus christ and draw out of the seed all the potential that's already in there why do we keep reading the same message books we've already read and why do we keep reading the same bible we've already read and why do we keep coming to church every sunday and wednesday amen because we're wanting god to draw out of us more of what's already in there unlock more of the mystery unlock more of the potential by revelation by faith amen faith is a revelation by revelation unlock more and more and more of what's already on the inside and let that life bring this outer man into subjection and pull that in and pull this in and pull that in bringing it to match the word see when we when we have a wrong concept or a denominational concept of the new birth we we always hope that our confession was good enough and we always hoped that i said the right thing like i repented but you know i really repented but i forgot this thing that i did when i was five years old so do i go back and repent for that again we're looking for a formula that's a denominational approach i repented but i you know i i i don't know if i repented all the way and i'm not sure and i it's not the words that we said friends it's you may have got your words all wrong you may have been a blubbering mess amen when god come and contacted you and the soul you may have been crying so hard no words were coming out amen it's not about what's said it's not about you know what was the understanding i had right then it doesn't matter it's the understanding that he come for you amen you're part of him it's jesus christ amen revealed personally to you and you know you've made contact with him and you can be an utter wreck and a mess and forget to repent of what you did when you were 5 and 10 and all that but what you're doing is you're accepting what he's telling you that i'm yours i'm your child take me god forgive me for my wrong amen it's not about saying the right word the right phrase coming to a certain order folding our hands a certain way amen god can find you in the shower he can find you in your house in the yard in a car in church at an altar at a camp amen it doesn't matter where and it doesn't matter how your experience may be nothing like somebody else's experience but the truth is you have to have an experience and it has to be a personal experience to you where at some point you come in contact with deity and that contact with deity did something inside me that has never changed back it has changed me amen it may not be like yours and it may not match your definition or your idea of what it's like amen what should happen and all the things that should go with it but i don't know i don't know how else to explain it but i met him he came to me and changed me i've never been the same and if there's nothing there on the inside there's nothing to change you too just changing the ideas but changing the ideas will do nothing for the soul changing the soul will change the ideas brother ma'am says and the message and knoweth it not many think because they speak with tongues they got the holy ghost that don't mean that though the holy ghost does speak with tongues but until that real genuine holy spirit in there will cope with every word if the holy spirit in you that makes you speak with tongues looks back there and doesn't agree with the rest of the word then it's the wrong spirit it's got to come from the inside which is the word from the beginning you got that it's got to come from the inside which is the word from the beginning so what is the word from the beginning the message no what's inside is the word from the beginning so the revealed word comes from what was already predestinated word and brings it to life in the beginning of the creation of god when god began to create you bring you into existence you see you started back there as a seed and worked down to here where you are now you started back there as a seed in the beginning in the creation you started back there seed worked your way down to where you are now how did you work down i don't know what does all that mean i don't know one thing i know for sure is i was back there in the beginning i was in the seed and i've worked my way down to where i am now and god knew where this seed was and so he sent his spirit and he sent his word to light upon that seed to bring that seed to life so that there can be a life on the inside of this vessel that'll bring this vessel into obedience explain it any way you want to explain it with any terms you want to use but until we get to that reality it doesn't matter the reality of the seed coming to life and becoming the watchtower god on the inside go to first corinthians chapter 2. first corinthians chapter 2. and verse 11 for what knoweth what for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god that first spirit came from the world remember he's in a spirit to unlock a life on the inside of us because these things are freely given to us so that we could understand how can you accept the word when millions reject the word how can you accept the word when millions reject it and people you love dearly and people who are smarter than you and i and and lived a nicer life than you and i lived they've rejected how can you and i believe this word because there was something on the inside to believe with a thinking man's filter the word cannot deny itself then it is satisfied or it's the desire it's a desire of what what made you desire in the first place because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life always laying in there always was in there all that the father has given me will come to me there isn't any of them going to be lost a thinking man's taste when a thinking man hears the word of god my sheep hear my voice a stranger they'll not follow for down in there is life down and there is life and life connects with life down in there is life and life what life god's life spirit life word life and life spirit word christ comes to life springs forth into life that is the resurrection that is the change in the body and the soul brother said in leadership the choice of your conduct you can mix it now you're either for god or against god and the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside the cockapoo many of you think i got the baptism in the holy ghost i'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the bible says so uh-huh that's exactly right look here you're an outside person you have five senses that contacts this outside body god gave you five senses not to contact him your earthly home see taste feel smell in here then you have a spirit on the inside of that and that's five outlets conscious and love and so forth five outlets that you contact the spirit world with that but with your spirit your physical contacts the physical your spiritual context is spiritual but inside of that you've got a soul and that soul is that gene that come from god that's what the word come to quicken the word didn't come to tickle our ears the word didn't come in this day to start a new movement and do the nomination to promote a man that word came to quicken that seed we come in contact with that life and that word and that light and that whatever we come in contact with that and something in us changes and that change begins to grow and as we feed on the word and we're lifted up in revelation in the resurrection in the rapture as we lift it up it quickens our mortal bodies word by word revelation by revelation week by week month by month we should never be going backwards in our walk we should never be going backwards amen in our life amen we should be moving forward constantly climbing and going up with god revelation upon revelation word by word until finally this flesh can no longer resist the word of god amen can no longer resist the life on the inside and the life on the inside will pull this flesh into a glorified condition praise be to god amen want to read this other quote things that are to be now the only way that you can be a son or daughter of god is because you have have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's god's life when did you get it you've always had it that's the only way you can be a son or daughter of god the only one form of eternal life and that's god's life the only one form of eternal life that was god there to be a son of god you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as the son of god i tell you when i read that it makes you say i don't want to be nothing but that and if i'm being anything but that i need to come back and line up to this and be nothing but the manifestation of the seed gene of god the gene of the life that was in god as a son of god now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age you know i read that for a specific reason now you're expressed after his word is coming you it takes the word to meet the word it takes the life to meet the life i can say that a thousand times but a thousand times still may not do it justice because sometimes we're looking for a certain experience or a certain emotional thing or a certain way and when god's way is to bring the life to you bring the word to you amen bring the word for this age to you and that is to bring a change that is to change to bring this life up it says you are expressing god's life in you because you are a son or daughter of god therefore you get what i mean see there you are you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express god to this nation and this people in this neighborhood where you associate wherever you are god knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you've got eternal life then it always was eternal life and god before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here and when the word or the water the washing of the water the word fell upon you it was expressed in a being now you have faith you have fellowship with your father god just as you have with your earthly father you are citizens of the king not citizens but your children sons and daughters of the living god if it be that eternal life dwells in you see this revelation that brother branham started bringing at the end of his ministry is to take the scare away what are we scared about well i'm scared i won't make it you already made it i'm scared i won't be there you're already there you're three persons and one person of you is already on the other side amen you have a theophany body waiting eternal in the heaven you're already made it there's no question of whether you'll make it or not amen the struggle is not will i make it the struggle is not am i one of them amen it's already been confirmed to me because i met the person of the word and changed me it's the will i make it to the rapture if you've already resurrected the rapture can't go without you if you've already raptured the rapture's not going anywhere amen until your body changes so there's no missing it there's no there's no it going on without me there's none of those things and the true revelation of the word because the true revelation the word takes the scare away amen and the whole christian walk is based on rest rest amen the key to operating any gift is to relax to find our position we can't always be i don't even know if i'm this and i don't even know if i'm that i don't even know amen i was before yes what i was before i will be am i going to make it i've already made it am i a child of god i was before the foundation of the world how do you know because my soul changed my desires changed the core of who i am it quickened the life my thoughts are on him my affections are on him i love his word and then every time i hear the word something in me just jumps for joy and i respond to that word and that word is lifting me higher and changing me by degrees it's changing me we can live our full potential when we're no longer trying to answer old questions because of denominational ideas on the new birth god i've already resurrected i've already raptured you're not leaving me behind you're not you're not going to kick me away you're not going to cast me out you've already accepted me you've already united with me you've already raised me up you're not i'm not missing anything and now i can focus on what i'm here on this earth to do is to express the life of god see the devil's always bringing us back to try to answer questions that are already answered so that we no longer express what we're supposed to be expressing in this life we should be free people free from worry free from scare free from fear we should be a free people this revelation should take all the bondage off of us all the restrictions and all the fear and all the scare it should take it off of us so that we can really be who we were always meant to be not hoping that something will work out and hoping the next move will work out but believing that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered to the lord i'm a child of god and he saw the way that i will take he knows the way that i would take he knows the outcome and i'm a child of god walking by faith in the word of god and if i need to take a step to the right or left he will move me to the right or left because my heart is pure before him i've already the first part of me the the inside man has already resurrected and raptured the spirit body is already there i'm more there than here right can we believe it friends can we believe it i'm more there than here there's only one there's three people in me there's only one part of me only one people of me only one phase of me left to cross over amen in those two parts are pulling this part as fast and as hard as it can that's why the things of the world are dropping off of us that's why earthly desires are falling away that's why our passions are changing all the time because there's two parts already resurrected already on the other side drawing this last man over drawing this flesh man amen and bring him higher and higher and higher the resurrection is on the rapture is in place it's moving right now it's moving in me it's moving in my very flesh b how do you know it's already started has it started for you it started for me amen there's things that i have overcome in the last several years that i could never overcome before there's thought patterns that have changed amen there's desires in the flesh that have disappeared carnal desires worldly things have just begun to vanish away what did that it wasn't willpower it wasn't positive thinking amen it was the revelation in this word pooling me drawing me off of the earth and that same thing that quickens your mortal body that same spirit that same life that's in whatever you call it that same thing in you amen that is the control tower on the inside that is changing this mortal body and lining it to the word that same thing that could change amen a fallen body and that no longer will desire earthly carnal things and it will disappear and if we can see that happen what in the world are we worried about a body chain to adam's chase i'm already changing i couldn't change that but it's changed i couldn't change that desire but it's gone i couldn't stop being tempted from that but i'm no longer tempted by that we should have more confidence than anybody else on the earth that i'm going the full distance i'm going all the way whatever's drawn me this high is going to draw me the rest of the way this flesh is going to move to match what's already taken place on the inside i've already undergone one body change and i'm undergoing another this body is changing that's why we press towards the mark of the high calling that's why we feed on the word i said earlier why do we read the same book we've read 10 times why do we read the same bible we've read our whole christian lives why do we come to the same services why so that that word can be lifted up and if i live ye live also if that word and that revelation can be lifted up then it can begin to draw that life out of me see it's not a puddle it's not it's not a chicken putting peacock feathers in it's not a crow trying to be a dove it's the life on the inside the dove brother venom said is a peculiar bird because it's got oil on the inside and the oil represents the holy ghost from the inside cleans it from the inside out they don't have to take a bath it's clean from the inside out man what's happening the resurrection takes place from the inside out i'm walking in the resurrection i've been raptured and i'm being raptured oh what a revelation friends let it affect us let it change us let it draw us higher and let's all stand i want to read one quote while we stand and while the musicians come brother iran says in the message it is the rising of the son he said you believe that we shall rise in him we become part of him the easter the revealed secret of god like it was then of life after death we are now alive who were once dead in sin and trespasses the true easter seal has broke death from around me and i'm alive the easter seal at the beginning broke the seal of the roman seal the easter seal that he was sealed up and man when they died was gone but he broke that seal and revealed the secret and now god by his holy spirit has broke the seal from around our lives and christ is revealed as he lives in us for now we are quickened with him what happened in the messages in 1965 for me brother branham god through brother branham took the seal off the mystery of my new birth it wasn't a decision that i made i should change that statement it wasn't only a decision that i made it wasn't only a mental agreement with the word but when he took it off and he uncovered what it was it was god finding a portion of himself my new birth was god coming to god word coming to worm life coming to life well god had four ordained before the foundation of the world a seed that had been coming down from the beginning coming all the way down to where i am now the holy ghost came and found it and when the holy ghost found it amen the fire of god the word of god lit it and it sparked into life that was my new birth that's why amen when my mind begins to falter and when my flesh becomes weak i do not lose my new birth amen i do not lose my experience with god because it wasn't something that happened just in the mind or just in the flesh it happened in the soul it was god making contact with god it was life making contact with life and that will never change it'll never fade away where brother bam said you can completely lose your mind and go insane and it won't change the soul you can so lose your mind and go insane that you can die swearing like a sailor but that doesn't touch the soul what happened the mystery's been revealed it wasn't that i just liked the message it wasn't that i just thought it was a better idea it wasn't that somebody lined up the scriptures enough to convince me that had nothing to do with it amen all that was was putting me in contact with him so that he could come in contact with me and when the two omnipotents meats the predestinated part of god that was preordained to be in this vessel of clay to manifest his life came to life that was my new birth and i'm not giving that up for nothing i'm not going to let the devil talk me out of that because it's the very thing that's changing me changing me and changing me tell your friends the try harder doctrine stinks the denominational idea stinks the denominational idea has politicians claiming to be born again christians who live all kinds of terrible lives how can they claim to be a born-again christian because all the preachers tell them they're born again because they believe jesus died on the cross and they do they believe jesus died on a cross for the sins of the world and they really believe it but why doesn't have the power to change their lives and make them moral and godly and christ-like right see that's the darkness of the nomination listen that you can agree with something you can say something and you can repeat after a preacher and you can be born again that's nonsense the only way you can be born again if there's something there to be born if there's some life there to be quick in the life if there's nothing there you cannot be born again but if there's a sea gene of god laying there then god will hunt it out god will find it because the mama eagle knew it had laid another egg and went searching the country for it god found you you didn't find god because god was already in you he had to find you because he can't lose himself oh the seal's been tore away the roman stone's been rolled away no more denominational ideas i'm a child of god not because of my conduct not because of my decisions i'm a child of god because i was in him before the foundation of the world and nothing's going to take that away i'm not giving it up for no silly whisper of the devil our denominational idea now can we relax into another gear can we all who were preordained to be in this life and manifest him in this world can we just drop into that channel where he can begin to operate because all the scare and all the fear is gone i'm not worried about i'll miss the boat or no i when i pray and agonize i pray to be more pleasing to him not to be saved again i just wrestle with my flesh to be more pleasing to him not to get converted again now can we just relax into that place where his life can live in us can we get away from the scare and the turmoil of who we are and what am i am i this am i that am i right am i wrong can we just drop into a channel and relax into a gift and rest in the spirit and let god start to do what only god can do praise god let the scare fade away go back to our origins go past your beginning well at my beginning go past your beginning because your beginning denotes time can you go back before your beginning and go to your origin and where is your origin if your origin's in him then everything's all right rest little bride rest fear not little flock it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom don't worry don't stress don't fret everything's on time let the peace that passes understanding envelop our hearts and bring us into that place that he wants us to be god bless you saints let's pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for your word god we realize the limitation of language but oh god that's how you decided to bring forth your mystery and god we accept it and i pray god that you'd move your people past the words of a man past human language and move them into divine revelation god you know our hearts you know my heart you know what i was trying to express you know the the revelation lord that laid there and i pray god you'd bring your people to the same revelation of your word that they would connect with you in a higher way that would take the scare and the fear away god i pray that you would just help a rest to settle into the hearts of your believing children a confidence in what you have already done a realization in the positional placing of your bride that she's already made it and then that nor that confidence in that position and that confidence in that placing god would would move us forward in faith where we could take one step and then another and then another draw us lord send the revelation of your word to draw us higher draw us lord into that place you want us to be for the potentials laying here lord i know it everything's laying here just draw it out we pray anoint this lord as we go from here to do your bidding to do your will to be your lights to be your life lord in this earth god may we come in contact with others that need the truth of the lord may we be dispensers of truth may we be spreaders forth of light lord may you use us for your glory we pray oh we as that you take us keep us use us lord for your glory well we pray that you would just bless each one of us and the manifestation you've called us to that we could relax and let you take control and move us the way you want to move us we ask these things in the name of our lord jesus christ amen sing in the resurrection will i'm walking in the resurrection walking in the body change i'm walking with jesus christ i'm walking in the resurrection walking in the body change until i take the last step like enoch did [Music] i was dead like lazarus but i
