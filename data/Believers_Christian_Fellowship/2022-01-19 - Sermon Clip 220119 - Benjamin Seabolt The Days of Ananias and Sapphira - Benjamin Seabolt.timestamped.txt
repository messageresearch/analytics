[0:00] when i say the days of ananias and
[0:02] sapphira the point is not for dead
[0:04] people
[0:05] because if you recall we had these days
[0:07] in brother branham's ministry
[0:09] with brother way
[0:11] brother brandon says he was preaching he
[0:13] exposed that complex in his life and he
[0:15] said he resented me exposing that and he
[0:18] died of a
[0:20] heart attack
[0:23] repeat of scripture
[0:26] a shock hit him so bad he physically had
[0:29] a heart attack and died
[0:32] i'll just remind you that the prophet of
[0:34] god did not leave him laying there dead
[0:37] and i want to put it this way
[0:39] if the power of god would fall in this
[0:41] assembly and do what it did in the days
[0:43] of ananias and sapphira i don't want to
[0:45] be the one standing on the side saying i
[0:47] deserve them right
[0:49] i want to be the one laying there
[0:51] praying for them calling out for mercy
[0:54] calling for their life to come back if
[0:56] there's any way
[0:59] because i'm not above that i'm in hybrid
[1:01] flesh just like you are
[1:03] i'm human just like you are
[1:05] and that's the spirit and the objective
[1:07] that i want to operate with
[1:10] and it's the same way now we we
[1:13] recognize that in a mighty physical
[1:15] demonstration and a very specific
[1:17] demonstration
[1:19] but the same thing happens each and
[1:22] every service and each and every time we
[1:24] come in contact with the word when the
[1:26] word exposes something to us
[1:28] you may not fall physically dead
[1:30] but you can walk out of those church
[1:32] doors dead as a door now
[1:34] because you have rejected the word
[1:39] i don't want that to be the case either
[1:42] if the word of god is coming and i'm not
[1:44] getting it i want somebody to intercede
[1:46] for me and to cry out for me god help
[1:48] him to see it
[1:50] god help him to get it
[1:52] because we all know it's just a it's
[1:54] just a common understanding it is ten
[1:56] times easier for me to see something
[1:58] wrong in your life than it is to see it
[2:00] in my life
[2:01] and it's ten times easier for you to see
[2:03] something wrong in my life than it is in
[2:04] your own
[2:06] that's why iron sharpeneth iron
[2:09] and the purpose of sharpening iron is
[2:11] not to kill your brother or your sister
[2:13] the point is to be able to cut that
[2:15] thing away from your brother and sister
[2:16] without hurting them with the right
[2:18] motive with the right objective to allow
[2:21] the power and demonstration and purity
[2:24] and realness of the days of ananias and
[2:26] sapphira to return into the church with
[2:29] the right motive and with the right
[2:31] objective
[2:32] not for death
[2:35] not for death physical or spiritual
[2:38] not for suffering
[2:41] but so that that person can be free
[2:43] so that they can walk in a pureness of
[2:46] heart truly giving all things
