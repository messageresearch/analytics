TRANSCRIPT
========================================
some of us need our joy restored because of this rat race called life we live in a time of loss and gain gain and loss we live in an hour where it's not baby blue skies and white puffy clouds all the time it's not sunshines and rain rainbows right yes I don't y'all got sunshines and rainbows all the time no but but there's there's but but I was talking to brother brother Josiah months and months ago and he and he told me something he said he said the other day he said he was on his way to work and it was storming out and uh and he said he said he said you know he said he said when when you when it's baby blue skies and white puffy clouds you're just driving Lord Brea P right but let let let those let those Dark Skies uh uh appear out of nowhere and you see the rain come in and it gets real dark and black and the and the lightning flashes and The Thunder Rolls am and it gets real dark it ain't Lord prepare me anymore but it it's 10 and two and when it starts coming down like sheets of rain and it's wave after wave you ain't Lord prep me but you're what your laser focused and you're watching that yellow line and really that's when we're in the test that's right that's when you turn off the Lord prep cuz you want to focus and brother Josiah said something he says teachers don't say much during a test amen and when he said I thought oh that's so good and I saw I saw a PowerPoint slide in the making I should have gave him credit at the bottom of that right but listen sometimes everything falls apart cuz God trying to get you to focus that's right
