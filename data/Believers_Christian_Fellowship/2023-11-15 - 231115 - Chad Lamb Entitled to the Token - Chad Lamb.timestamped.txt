[12:53] Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[12:57] God bless you while we're standing if we
[12:58] we could open our Bibles and turn to
[13:00] Exodus together Exodus 12 I also uh
[13:05] wanted to mention I I I was going to
[13:07] mention it Sunday and I forgot I failed
[13:09] to but um I just wanted to mention the
[13:12] um I I give thanks to all those who come
[13:15] out for the Saturday evening prayer time
[13:18] I know there's several of you who are
[13:20] very very consistent in coming out
[13:22] there's others who come as they're able
[13:24] but uh it's always really nice to see
[13:28] Saints in here Saturday evening and if
[13:30] you didn't know that the churches open
[13:32] Saturday from 3:00 p.m. till 10 p.m. for
[13:34] prayer just an open prayer time you come
[13:37] pray anywhere and here you like uh stay
[13:39] as long as you like and come and go
[13:42] freely between 3: and 10 and uh it's
[13:45] always encouraging but this this
[13:47] Saturday especially this has happened
[13:49] many times but this Saturday I came in
[13:51] and I've been studying all day I've had
[13:53] the day set aside I've been in
[13:55] preparation and meditation and I come
[13:57] down and as I come come down that center
[13:59] aisle I usually come down and and pray
[14:01] right here in front uh right as I lock
[14:03] up I lock the doors and uh as soon as I
[14:06] was walking down the aisle the presence
[14:08] of the Lord just became more and more
[14:09] powerful and as I knelt down some things
[14:11] that I was locked up on I couldn't get
[14:13] the inspiration were all sudden opened
[14:15] up and the inspiration started to flow
[14:18] and I wanted to share that with you
[14:19] because we had a tremendous service on
[14:21] Sunday and I there's a lot of factors
[14:24] that go into that a lot of moving Parts
[14:27] a lot of particip ation in the body and
[14:29] I know there's a lot of you who are
[14:30] praying through the week and trusting in
[14:32] the Lord and asking special prayer for
[14:34] myself whoever will be ministering and
[14:37] and setting the atmosphere in here on
[14:38] Saturday it all works together for the
[14:41] glory of God and I want to say thank you
[14:43] and God bless you and if you haven't had
[14:45] the opportunity to Avail yourself of
[14:47] that opportunity I'd recommend it I know
[14:49] many people are busy and there's things
[14:51] happening and you may not always be able
[14:53] to come but if you find yourself with an
[14:55] opening on Saturday between 3:00 and 10:
[14:57] it would do your a world of good good
[14:59] and it would do us a world of good as
[15:01] well I love the atmosphere that prayer
[15:03] creates amen I know many of you pray at
[15:05] home and that's wonderful but there is
[15:07] something special about praying in the
[15:09] same place it does create an atmosphere
[15:12] amen so God bless you while we're
[15:14] standing let's read Exodus
[15:16] 12 verse 13
[15:21] together and the blood shall be to you
[15:24] for a token upon the houses where you
[15:26] are and when I see the blood I will pass
[15:28] pass over you and the plague shall not
[15:30] be upon you to destroy you when I smite
[15:33] the land of Egypt am mean Lord bless you
[15:36] as you have your
[15:37] seats we've been uh we've been talking
[15:40] about the new birth and the token and
[15:43] just many different things and and as it
[15:45] happens so often sometimes I feel like a
[15:48] broken record when I begin to talk cuz I
[15:49] say the same things cu the same things
[15:51] happen to me over and over again I I I
[15:54] have a plan I have an idea I think we're
[15:56] going to go one way and then the Lord
[15:57] interrupts that plan which I know is a
[15:59] good thing amen it's a wonderful thing
[16:01] but when you're the one who's constantly
[16:03] getting jerking back and forth it's not
[16:04] so easy amen that's the way we want it
[16:06] and we don't want it ever to change but
[16:08] you know when it came uh to the service
[16:10] on Sunday I I never even come close to
[16:13] completing my thought I barely touched
[16:15] where I what was on my heart and the
[16:16] things I prepared so I thought I'll just
[16:18] come tonight and finish it well when I
[16:20] come to preparation over the last two
[16:22] days something else injected itself and
[16:24] now I've got to do that before I get to
[16:26] the next part and we'll see if we ever
[16:27] get there amen amen we just trust the
[16:30] Lord and I love the way he leads amen so
[16:32] we're going to we're just going to go
[16:34] that way but tonight I'd like to do a
[16:36] little bit more teaching and I'd like to
[16:38] take for a a subject the title entitled
[16:41] to the Token entitled to the token and
[16:45] we just want to we want to share some
[16:47] things concerning that let's turn
[16:49] together to the Book of
[16:51] Joshua we know in Exodus 12 we were
[16:54] dealing with the Exodus and when Moses
[16:56] was given the instructions by God to
[16:59] instruct Israel and how to take a lamb
[17:01] how to put the lamb up how to slay the
[17:03] lamb and take the blood and how to apply
[17:05] the blood and he promised that if they
[17:08] would do as Moses commanded and apply
[17:10] the blood then then when he smokee the
[17:13] land of Egypt he would pass over the
[17:15] death angel would pass and the plague
[17:17] would not fall that's the scripture that
[17:19] we read and now we're going to come to
[17:21] Joshua chapter two we're going to pick
[17:24] up the story of the two spies in Rahab
[17:28] in Joshua
[17:32] 2:12 now therefore I pray you swear unto
[17:35] me by the Lord since I have showed you
[17:37] kindness that you will also show
[17:39] kindness unto my father's house and give
[17:41] me a true token so now Rahab is asking
[17:45] them hey I've I've I've I've hid you
[17:48] I've helped you I've aided you and these
[17:50] were the two Messengers that were sent
[17:52] in Amen to spy out the land they were
[17:54] sent from Joshua from the presence of
[17:56] Joshua to come in and and and she said
[17:59] give me a true token and let's drop down
[18:01] to verse
[18:02] 17 and the men said unto her we will be
[18:05] blameless of this thine oath which thou
[18:07] has made us swear behold when we come
[18:10] into the land Thou shalt bind this line
[18:12] of scarlet thread in the window which
[18:14] thou this let us down by and thou shalt
[18:16] bring thy father and thy mother and thy
[18:18] Brethren and all thy father's household
[18:20] home unto thee and it shall be that
[18:22] whosoever shall go out of the doors of
[18:24] this house into the street his blood
[18:26] shall be upon his head and we will be
[18:28] Guiltless and whosoever shall be with
[18:30] thee in the house his blood shall be on
[18:33] our head if any hand be upon him so now
[18:38] uh we know that brother REM tells us
[18:40] that in the Exodus Journey the blood was
[18:42] the token it was the token or the
[18:45] evidence or the representation that a
[18:47] substitutionary life had been given amen
[18:50] for the household amen and they were in
[18:52] the house feasting on the lamb amen that
[18:55] had slain and and but on the outside of
[18:58] the house house was a token evidence
[19:00] that a lamb had been slain in obedience
[19:02] to the word of God to fulfill God's
[19:04] requirement and when he saw the token
[19:07] amen he would pass by amen so that was a
[19:10] token now we find Rahab the Harlot she's
[19:13] in in Jericho and Jericho is destined to
[19:16] be destroyed and she asks for a true
[19:18] token amen not just any token but she
[19:21] wants a true token and The Messengers
[19:23] gave her a true token this Scarlet
[19:25] thread that you've let us down by amen
[19:27] hang this out your window amen and your
[19:30] house will not be destroyed and all that
[19:32] are under the Scarlet thread all that be
[19:34] are safely in the house that's behind
[19:36] the Scarlet thread they will be safe
[19:38] also so we find here this is uh some of
[19:41] the scriptures that brother Brenham uses
[19:42] when he preaches the message the token
[19:45] he starts showing us what our token is
[19:47] and he begins to break it down and show
[19:49] us that our token he says we had a lamb
[19:52] also that was slain for the household of
[19:55] God it was the Lamb of God it was Jesus
[19:58] Christ the son of God Amen the flesh
[20:01] body of God and and that that blood that
[20:03] flowed through his veins was the blood
[20:05] of God Amen and that blood was shed for
[20:09] us to pay the price of redemption so
[20:11] that we could go free amen but he
[20:13] teaches us in the the the token message
[20:15] that that blood went down into the
[20:17] Judean soil and and that that actual
[20:20] physical blood that was shed out that
[20:22] vein the veins was the blood of God but
[20:24] it it went back into the Earth and it
[20:27] went back into content and back into to
[20:30] things like that and we cannot get that
[20:32] physical literal blood now for an
[20:35] application but we can get an
[20:36] application by faith in that blood when
[20:39] we believe by faith that that blood was
[20:41] shed on my behalf that that sub
[20:43] substitutionary offering was a
[20:45] substitution for me we can say he was
[20:47] subst substituting for the sins of the
[20:49] world that's not enough Faith amen we
[20:52] got to have faith to appropriate that
[20:55] for us personally that's the faith
[20:57] that'll bring
[20:59] Redemption so now we we see then that
[21:03] the blood is shed and we can we can get
[21:05] an application of that blood by faith
[21:08] amen but then there has to be a token of
[21:11] the blood amen a token that a
[21:13] substitutionary life was given on our
[21:15] behalf and that token now is not the
[21:18] chemistry of the blood like it was in
[21:20] The Exodus Journey amen but that token
[21:23] now is the very life of Jesus Christ the
[21:26] very Holy Ghost life that comes back
[21:29] upon us as a Believer amen and that is
[21:31] the token amen that that that God has
[21:35] honored our faith our faith in what our
[21:37] faith in Calvary our faith in Salvation
[21:40] our faith in Redemption amen God has
[21:42] honored our faith and sent down his
[21:44] token as a seal and that token is the
[21:48] evidence that there's been a
[21:49] substitutionary life given for
[21:52] me without the token there's no evidence
[21:55] amen there's no evidence that your faith
[21:57] has been accepted accepted when
[21:58] Abraham's Faith was accepted he was
[22:00] given a token a seal of circumcision and
[22:03] that seal of circumcision was a token
[22:05] evidence that Abraham's Faith was
[22:07] accepted amen we have faith but our
[22:09] faith must be accepted the acceptance of
[22:12] our faith is the
[22:14] token the life of Jesus Christ and our
[22:18] life
[22:20] Amen brother B says in the token message
[22:23] but when I see the token I'll pass over
[22:24] you it's God's requirement of the hour
[22:29] amen yeah it's God's requirement of the
[22:33] hour brother said he could not preach
[22:36] the token message till after he preached
[22:38] the seals
[22:40] amen amen because now he's coming and
[22:43] he's preaching the full life of God is
[22:47] now come back into the church no longer
[22:50] a dip in the Holy Ghost like in the
[22:52] church age is no longer a partial amen
[22:55] because where there was partial word
[22:56] there was partial life
[22:59] amen but now that the fullness of the
[23:01] word has come and through opening of the
[23:03] seals the fullness of the word brings
[23:04] the fullness of the life amen and that
[23:07] life now comes into the Bride of Jesus
[23:09] Christ into the church and now it's
[23:12] token time amen it was a lamb before but
[23:15] now it's token time now it's time for
[23:17] the full life amen and that full life
[23:20] wasn't just to come into the house but
[23:23] the token life must be on display on the
[23:25] outside of the house the token must be
[23:28] on display we must receive the baptism
[23:31] of the Holy Ghost which is the the life
[23:33] of Jesus Christ coming into us to
[23:35] Quicken the seed that's in us and to
[23:37] seal us amen into the day of redemption
[23:40] it's a recognition of our faith amen but
[23:43] that we can have that experience and say
[23:45] I've had that experience but if we have
[23:47] that experience the token must be on
[23:49] display it must be on the outside of the
[23:51] house and this is our house and on the
[23:54] outside of the house it shows that the
[23:56] lamb is on the inside and they're
[23:58] feasting on the lamb which is the word
[24:02] amen and while they were feasting on the
[24:04] word they were told to eat the whole
[24:06] lamb not no not just the tasty Parts eat
[24:09] the pertinence thereof eat it all
[24:12] consume the entire thing and he said if
[24:14] you can't consume it then let it be
[24:16] burned don't let it hang over to another
[24:18] day amen and that was symbolic of the
[24:20] church ages brother B comes along and
[24:22] tells us that in the church age you
[24:24] couldn't have a carryover from one day
[24:25] to the next it all had to be consumed
[24:28] but hey praise God we're in the end time
[24:30] there is no carryover there is no other
[24:32] day there's no part of this lamb that's
[24:35] not to be consumed but we're here to
[24:37] consume the whole word all of Christ the
[24:40] fullness of the Lamb is being consumed
[24:42] in the house amen and outside of the
[24:45] house is the life of the Lamb we're
[24:47] consuming on the outside as token
[24:50] evidence the life's
[24:53] inside
[24:55] amen glory and it wasn't just the death
[24:59] angel that recognized the
[25:02] token brother R said everybody that
[25:04] walked
[25:05] by recognize the
[25:08] token and he applied the same thing to
[25:11] you and I the people we come in contact
[25:13] with the people that see us walk down
[25:15] the street the people we work with the
[25:17] people we go to school with the people
[25:18] we live with they should see there's a
[25:20] life on the outside they should see
[25:23] something is different about us than
[25:25] about when than the rest of the world
[25:27] that's right
[25:28] cuz the token must be on
[25:30] display so brother B I'll read this
[25:33] again so but when when I see the token
[25:35] I'll pass over you it's God's
[25:38] requirement for the hour the evening
[25:41] time message is to apply the
[25:45] token there's so many
[25:48] things in the message we talk about the
[25:53] message is so
[25:55] encompassing it's so deep it's so broad
[25:58] it's the full revelation of the word
[26:00] it's the it's Jesus Christ The Mystery
[26:02] of God revealed it's the full word
[26:04] unveiled it's so encompassing but
[26:07] sometimes brother Brenham makes these
[26:09] simple statements and tells us what the
[26:10] message is and in the end time at the
[26:12] last days the evening time message is to
[26:15] apply the token what's it all coming
[26:17] down to it all comes down to the life
[26:20] must be on display amen the token must
[26:23] be on the outside of our house for all
[26:25] the passer Byers to see the life of the
[26:28] Lamb must be on
[26:30] display amen that's the evening time
[26:34] message you can see why the token had to
[26:37] be preached at the end of the church
[26:41] ages because they could not live the
[26:44] full life of Jesus Christ because they
[26:47] did not have the full
[26:49] Revelation in Luther's day they
[26:51] understood justification but they had no
[26:53] understanding of
[26:54] sanctification and if justification
[26:57] without San sanctification it doesn't
[26:58] mean Luther was lost and it doesn't mean
[27:00] Luther didn't have the Holy Ghost
[27:03] amen amen but because he didn't
[27:07] understand amen he didn't understand
[27:09] sanctification the word had not opened
[27:11] up that far to the elect seed of God he
[27:14] would still be a man who would drink a
[27:16] man who would smoke a man who would
[27:18] swear amen he would still be a man
[27:20] although a child of God although has the
[27:23] Holy
[27:25] Ghost but it couldn't be token time yet
[27:28] because he couldn't have the full
[27:29] measure of Christ on display this is the
[27:32] only time it could be token time at the
[27:34] end of the church ages after the opening
[27:36] of the seals when the Life of Christ
[27:39] when the veil has been taken off when
[27:40] the denominational confusion has been
[27:43] eliminated and we see Christ for who he
[27:45] is and now we're here not to just see
[27:48] Christ but we're here to reflect Christ
[27:50] and brother V said you reflect what
[27:51] you're pointed at you're pointed towards
[27:53] a denomination you reflect a
[27:54] denomination but you're pointed to the
[27:56] full or of the full brightness of the
[27:59] Sun in our day you're going to reflect
[28:01] the full brightness of the full orb of
[28:03] the
[28:04] sun that's what the word in our day has
[28:06] done amen so the token must be on
[28:10] display amen let's go to Acts chapter
[28:26] 2
[28:32] Acts chapter
[28:35] 2 verse
[28:43] 37 and when they heard this they were
[28:45] pricked in their heart and said to Peter
[28:47] and to the rest of the Apostles men and
[28:49] Brethren what shall we do this is on the
[28:52] day of Pentecost after Peter begins to
[28:54] preach then Peter said unto them repent
[28:57] and and be baptized every one of you in
[28:58] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[29:00] remission of sins and you shall receive
[29:03] the gift of the Holy Ghost for this
[29:05] promises unto you and to your children
[29:07] to all that are far off even as many as
[29:10] the Lord Our God shall call and with
[29:12] many other words did he testify and
[29:14] exhort saying save yourselves from this
[29:17] unor generation untorn means crooked or
[29:20] perverted from this unto
[29:22] generation then they then they that
[29:25] gladly received his word were baptized
[29:28] and the same day they were added unto
[29:29] them about 3,000 Souls amen so they
[29:33] asked the question their their hearts
[29:35] were pricked by the preaching of the
[29:37] word they said what shall we do and he
[29:39] tells them to repent and as we've been
[29:41] studying repent means to change your
[29:43] mind to have a change of mind repent
[29:45] means your actual understanding will
[29:47] change amen and when that changes
[29:50] everything else
[29:51] changes and we know that that that
[29:54] repentance I mean we we talked about
[29:56] repentance is not asking forgiveness cuz
[29:58] asking forgiveness and repentance aren't
[30:00] the same thing asking forgiveness is
[30:02] asking for a pardon or a release for
[30:05] something you've done wrong amen all
[30:07] right but repentance is changing the way
[30:11] you think about the
[30:13] offense right because if there's no
[30:15] repentance you can ask forgiveness but
[30:17] guess what next week you'll ask
[30:19] forgiveness because you'll do the same
[30:20] thing and next week you ask forgiveness
[30:22] because your thinking your mind your
[30:24] understanding hasn't changed about the
[30:26] offense so you keep repeating the
[30:27] offense but repentance will bring a
[30:29] change of mind and you won't keep
[30:31] repeating the same offense because your
[30:33] whole understanding about it will
[30:35] change so they had to repent and be
[30:39] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[30:40] for the remission of sins and they would
[30:42] receive the gift of the Holy
[30:44] Ghost and he begins to tell him this
[30:46] promises to you to your children to all
[30:49] that are far off that includes us even
[30:52] as many as the Lord our shall God shall
[30:54] call so if God's calling it's still
[30:55] available I love love when the prophet
[30:57] says that over and over if God's still
[30:59] calling This Promise is still in
[31:02] effect so then he he admonishes him with
[31:05] many other words did he testify and
[31:07] exhort saying save yourself so so when
[31:10] he begins to talk to them he he's
[31:12] preaching to them the message of the
[31:14] hour they're asking what they need to be
[31:16] do and he's telling them but he's also
[31:18] saying save yourself from this unto
[31:21] generation I don't think this was a mild
[31:24] thing I think he was calling out to them
[31:25] Flee for the Wrath that is to come amen
[31:29] amen and they that heard him gladly they
[31:31] received his word and were baptized and
[31:33] then they were added to the church about
[31:35] 3,000 Souls brother Bram says in the
[31:37] message desperations which is the
[31:39] message he preached in the evening after
[31:40] he preached token he preached the token
[31:43] in the morning and in the evening
[31:45] message he preached
[31:46] desperations and in desperation says we
[31:49] know it's true that God will meet a
[31:50] desperate
[31:51] Soul now we all know that but it usually
[31:54] takes something to drive us into that to
[31:56] that despair to the desperation it takes
[31:59] something to do
[32:00] it and then he goes a little further and
[32:03] he says further down in the message he
[32:05] says when you pray for the baptism of
[32:06] the Holy Spirit the token don't say well
[32:09] now I'll go up and try Lord I'm a little
[32:11] tired oh mercy stay in your seat don't
[32:15] even make an
[32:17] attempt we can see on the day of
[32:20] Pentecost this wasn't a light thing and
[32:22] if the message that Peter preached was
[32:24] not a light message it was a heavy
[32:26] message and he was was talking about
[32:27] what they had just done in rejecting the
[32:30] Messiah and how he he he was slain he
[32:32] was taken by Wicked hands and and he was
[32:34] slain and then he raised again and how
[32:36] the Fulfillment of Prophecy was there
[32:39] and it was a heavy message and they were
[32:40] pricked in their heart they wanted to
[32:42] know what they needed to do to be saved
[32:44] and he gave them instructions and then
[32:45] he was admonishing them save yourself
[32:49] from this generation amen I think they
[32:51] went into desperation amen because they
[32:53] moved immediately amen they didn't say
[32:55] give us a day to think about it we'll
[32:57] come back and hear you next Sunday but
[32:59] immediately they heard him amen they
[33:02] received his words they were baptized in
[33:03] jesus' name and they were added to the
[33:05] church 3,000
[33:07] Souls amen when it comes to the uh
[33:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not
[33:11] something to say well if I get it I get
[33:13] it amen that's not the approach if
[33:15] that's the attitude you're not ready yet
[33:17] for it amen you're not ready there's got
[33:19] to be something you says that I have to
[33:21] have this because it's this or perish
[33:23] amen it's this or be lost it's this or
[33:25] not go in the Rapture it's this or
[33:27] nothing for me it's all or nothing amen
[33:29] I've got to have the baptism of Holy
[33:31] Ghost I've got to be sealed till the day
[33:33] of redemption I have to have that life
[33:35] in me amen there needs to be a
[33:37] desperation there needs to be an Earnest
[33:39] seeking
[33:41] amen
[33:44] amen
[33:47] and and there must be an Earnest seeking
[33:49] according to the
[33:51] word let's turn to Acts chapter 5
[33:55] now I want to I'm Moving in now to the
[33:59] the title entitled to the
[34:02] Token because brother B says something
[34:05] interesting and I I want to look at it
[34:07] and and I pray that the Lord will help
[34:08] us understand what he's
[34:10] saying in Acts
[34:19] 5:32 Peter says in verse 32 and we are
[34:24] his Witnesses of these things and so is
[34:27] also the Holy Ghost whom God ha given to
[34:30] them that obey
[34:32] him I want you to hold on to that
[34:35] language so the Holy Ghost is he says we
[34:38] Are Witnesses so also is the Holy Ghost
[34:41] whom God ha given to them that obey
[34:45] him amen man there's no doubt that those
[34:48] 3,000 that were baptized that day
[34:51] received the Holy Ghost because they
[34:52] obeyed the word of the Lord amen they
[34:55] repented and were baptized in the name
[34:57] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[34:58] remission of their sins they were told
[35:00] they shall receive but he says the Holy
[35:03] Ghost has given to them that obey
[35:06] him brother brandham he picks this up
[35:09] and he understands this language and in
[35:11] the token I've been reading in the token
[35:14] for a while now and as I read in it I
[35:17] become amazed sometimes at things I see
[35:20] and he says in the token paragraph 338
[35:23] the token is the sign that the purchase
[35:25] has been made and been
[35:27] accepted now you can't get the token
[35:30] from the railroad Fair until you pay the
[35:32] price and the only way you're going to
[35:34] pay the price is pay it that's right
[35:37] what believe it accept it full obedience
[35:42] to the whole word of God will entitle
[35:44] you to the
[35:46] Token amen oh I want to I want to focus
[35:49] on this for a minute amen we
[35:54] can we can uh
[35:57] we can have many misunderstandings it's
[36:00] easy to have misunderstandings we have
[36:01] our own ideas we have our own human
[36:03] intellect and we have religious
[36:06] backgrounds and it can bring so much
[36:09] misunderstanding but but Brothers
[36:11] Brenham is telling us when you get the
[36:14] token from the railroad fair and he's
[36:15] talking about the railroad you pay money
[36:17] and get a token and you don't give money
[36:19] on the railroad you give a token the
[36:20] token is the evidence that the price was
[36:22] paid your token is evidence that
[36:24] somebody paid the price it nothing
[36:25] necessarily mean you paid it somebody
[36:27] else could have paid it and gave you a
[36:28] token but the token is the evidence the
[36:30] price is paid amen and when you want to
[36:33] ride the railroad you must give them the
[36:35] token and the token is exchanged for the
[36:37] ride on the railroad amen now in order
[36:39] to to to to bypass tribulation in order
[36:43] to be sealed into the day of redemption
[36:45] in order to be born again we must have a
[36:47] token amen for the death angel to pass
[36:50] we must have a token amen and this token
[36:52] is the life of Jesus Christ but but he's
[36:54] he's using this explanation get the
[36:57] token from the railroad Fair until you
[36:58] pay the price you can't get it till you
[37:00] pay the only way you're going to pay the
[37:02] price is pay it that's right what
[37:04] believe it accept it full obedience to
[37:07] the whole word of God will entitle you
[37:10] to the Token
[37:12] amen now you see why uh you can see why
[37:18] you can oh I don't know how I don't know
[37:21] the best way to explain it but you can
[37:23] put so much pressure on people to do so
[37:25] many things to try to get the token or
[37:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost through so
[37:29] many different kinds of demonstrations
[37:31] or signs and this and that amen and and
[37:33] and you make the
[37:35] effort you make the we we can make the
[37:38] effort to get it the reason for
[37:40] receiving
[37:47] it but Peter says
[37:50] repent have a total change of mind amen
[37:55] amen and be baptized in the name of the
[37:57] Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive
[38:00] the gift of the Holy Ghost amen so
[38:03] sometimes we make the the effort to get
[38:06] the Holy Ghost the means by which we get
[38:07] it but the prophet of God is telling us
[38:10] that we just need to believe it and
[38:13] accept it amen and full obedience to the
[38:16] whole word of God will entitle you to
[38:19] the Token yeah amen so if I want the
[38:22] token what do I need to do I must
[38:24] surrender to the full word of God in
[38:26] full obedience to the full word of God
[38:28] cuz the Holy Ghost is a witness of God
[38:30] whom he giveth to them that obey him so
[38:32] there's a promise in the word that he
[38:34] gives the Holy Ghost to those that obey
[38:36] him and he says full obedience to the
[38:38] whole word of God what's the whole word
[38:40] of God well I'll tell you friends the
[38:42] whole word of God is the message of the
[38:44] hour right where else will you get it
[38:47] how else will you find it everything
[38:48] else has been tainted by denomination
[38:51] been misunderstood by Creeds and dogmas
[38:53] and teaching of man amen but the message
[38:55] of the hour has I took the veil off of
[38:58] the Bible and now the seals are taken
[39:00] off of the book of redemption and now we
[39:02] can see it as it was intended to be and
[39:05] this is the whole word of God Amen but
[39:08] without the message of the hour the word
[39:10] is still sealed so how will you believe
[39:12] it how will you accept it how will you
[39:14] obey it without the message amen coming
[39:17] and opening back up the word and now we
[39:20] can enter into the word amen and receive
[39:23] the token
[39:25] amen amen I believe it's simpler amen
[39:30] than we make it many
[39:32] times
[39:34] sir I mean it's simple but not
[39:36] simplistic it's simple but it's hard
[39:39] amen it's not
[39:42] complicated full surrender an absolute
[39:45] dying to self and accepting all of
[39:47] Christ
[39:49] amen and by faith believing all the word
[39:53] will entitle us to the token
[39:56] but oh friends it's hard to
[39:59] die it's easy to say it's hard to die
[40:02] it's an easy concept it's not a
[40:04] difficult thing but when it comes down
[40:06] to the action many many times we find
[40:08] that we we just we we have a hard time
[40:10] with the surrender part but I I want to
[40:13] read this to you again so that you can
[40:14] lock in on it amen because it's so
[40:16] important he said that that's right
[40:19] believe it accept it full obedience to
[40:23] the whole word of God will entitle you
[40:24] to the Token full obedience
[40:26] not the part of it as far as your
[40:28] denomination goes but all of it amen
[40:33] amen full obedience to the word which is
[40:36] Christ brings you into
[40:40] Christ now what if you was just all in
[40:42] but your feet hanging out what if you
[40:44] was all in with your hands hanging out
[40:46] most all of us in but the heart hanging
[40:48] out see your heart is in the world yet
[40:50] but we don't do that full complete
[40:53] obedience puts you in the word as one
[40:56] you you believe it every bit all of it's
[40:58] in you and you watch it work through you
[41:01] amen amen now you can see listen I I I I
[41:07] I I I want to make this a un an an
[41:10] understanding according to what the
[41:11] prophet brought and I don't want to
[41:13] complicate it or make it complex but
[41:15] really this message is Christ amen it is
[41:18] the word it is the revelation of God
[41:20] Amen it is the Mysteries revealed it is
[41:23] Christ amen and when we come into Christ
[41:25] with a full surrendered to Christ and
[41:27] all that was brought to us through that
[41:29] messenger amen if we can fully surrender
[41:31] to that and die to whatever previous
[41:34] idea whatever emotional hangup we have
[41:36] or whatever little thing that's still
[41:38] hanging on but if we can die to all of
[41:40] that and surrender to this message amen
[41:42] we can be entitled to the Token because
[41:44] the Holy Ghost is given to them that
[41:46] obey
[41:50] amen
[41:54] amen see
[41:57] he says again just a couple paragraphs
[41:59] later now watch fully now full obedience
[42:03] to the whole word of God entitles us to
[42:06] the
[42:08] Token I want to
[42:11] say if we come to the
[42:14] altar but we still have things that we
[42:16] want to
[42:18] keep we still have relationships we want
[42:20] to hold on to we still have habits we're
[42:22] not ready to turn loose of yet we still
[42:25] have pleasures of this world that we're
[42:26] not ready to surrender we can cry and
[42:29] weep and cry and weep but until we're
[42:32] ready to make a full surrender until
[42:34] there's a total repentance and our mind
[42:36] changes and we want nothing to do with
[42:38] anything else and all we want is this
[42:41] word until we come to that place amen
[42:45] we're going to be going through motions
[42:47] and we're going to get into an emotional
[42:48] workout but at the end of the day it's
[42:50] not going to accomplish anything because
[42:53] the Prelude to this amen is repentance
[42:56] yeah amen and repentance is a change of
[43:00] mind
[43:02] amen and so I wonder so many times we
[43:06] see we've seen so many people baptized
[43:09] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[43:10] so many have taken true baptism
[43:12] according to the word but not received
[43:15] the gift of the Holy Ghost but it's a
[43:18] promise but the promise is if you repent
[43:21] amen repent and are baptized in the name
[43:24] of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall that
[43:25] promise cannot fail that's right so if
[43:28] we're baptized correctly in the name of
[43:30] the Lord Jesus Christ amen we must look
[43:32] at our repentance amen did I completely
[43:35] repent have I died to my own thinking
[43:37] have I given up all relationships and
[43:39] all attachments and all of my rights
[43:44] amen and if I have and I've taken his
[43:47] name in baptism Then This Promise will
[43:50] take effect in my life amen it's not
[43:53] questionable friends it has to it's the
[43:55] word of of God
[43:58] amen
[44:00] amen in the message doors and doors the
[44:03] prophet said it's a little thing that we
[44:04] leave undone sometimes that breaks the
[44:06] whole
[44:07] chain you see and lets us go free let's
[44:11] denominational minded just
[44:13] denominational minded and forget about
[44:15] those little things that really are the
[44:16] essential things everything every word
[44:20] of God is essential none of it can be
[44:22] left out amen we've got to take every
[44:25] word of it just the way it was wrote I
[44:29] love
[44:30] that Amen in God's only provided place
[44:32] of worship he says every little jot
[44:36] everything you must be faithful in it
[44:37] always the little Vine the little fox
[44:40] that spoils the vine sometimes it's not
[44:42] the big things you do it's the little
[44:44] things you leave undone remember a chain
[44:46] is only strongest at its weakest length
[44:48] blessed are they that do all the
[44:50] Commandments of God that they might have
[44:52] right to enter in do all God said and it
[44:56] said for women to have long hair you say
[44:58] a man told me not long ago said I Don't
[45:00] Preach clothline religion I said then
[45:02] you're not preaching the gospel God laid
[45:05] it out there he said what to do and and
[45:08] you either that's your natural
[45:10] reasonable thing what little thing the
[45:12] little
[45:14] insignificant Jesus said blessed are
[45:16] they that would take all the little
[45:17] things do the little things and a woman
[45:20] to let her hair grow that why it's just
[45:22] a something she can do and she won't
[45:25] even do that she won't even do that oh
[45:28] teach us the great things how can you
[45:30] teach the great things when you don't do
[45:32] the simple common thing because you see
[45:34] your motive and your objective is
[45:37] wrong why because you still have self
[45:40] mixed
[45:41] in why wouldn't you do it that's always
[45:44] the question to me I mean if the prophet
[45:46] of God teaches it why wouldn't we do
[45:49] it that's right that's right why so
[45:52] often when the prophet of God teaches
[45:54] something we try to explain it away
[45:57] or make it a matter of opinion or or
[45:59] this and these were the circumstances
[46:00] and I don't think and why would we do
[46:03] that friends when we've got a Vindicated
[46:05] prophet of God on the scene that has
[46:07] brought us the mysteries from the back
[46:08] part of God's mind amen why would we
[46:11] disrespect the gift of God like that
[46:13] just to take our own opinion
[46:16] amen see our motive and our objective is
[46:21] wrong many times see it's your love to
[46:25] God Lord I don't care what you want me
[46:27] to do I'm willing to do it then you're
[46:30] getting somewhere but if you don't do it
[46:32] that way the way he said do it then he
[46:35] didn't finish the sentence see it's your
[46:38] love to
[46:39] God and I love the S Lord I don't care
[46:42] what you want me to
[46:43] do I'm willing to do
[46:45] it I want that to be my attitude to
[46:48] where I'm not the central theme of my
[46:50] whole life anymore and my opinion isn't
[46:52] the greatest thing that I value amen I
[46:54] don't want to value my opinion I want to
[46:56] Value this word amen and when my opinion
[46:59] comes in contrast with the message of
[47:01] the hour I'm going to dump my opinion
[47:03] and take the message because that's
[47:04] what's been Vindicated by God Amen my
[47:08] opinion doesn't have Vindication I don't
[47:10] have a pillar of fire over my opinion
[47:13] amen but this message has been backed up
[47:15] by
[47:16] God we can trust
[47:19] itall in John chapter 14 let's turn
[47:24] there
[47:34] in John Chapter
[47:36] 14 verse
[47:41] 15 Jesus says in John 14:15 if you love
[47:45] me keep my Commandments
[47:50] amen Paul said one time if anyone's a
[47:54] prophet or spiritual among you let them
[47:55] acknowledge that the words that I speak
[47:57] unto you they are the words of the Lord
[47:59] amen amen so in order to keep the word
[48:02] of the Lord they had to keep what Paul
[48:05] said that's right and Jesus said if you
[48:07] love me keep my Commandments right F he
[48:11] says in verse 16 and I will pray the
[48:13] father and he shall give you another
[48:15] comforter that he may abide with you
[48:18] forever I love the way I love the way
[48:21] the Bible is written because it's always
[48:23] a challenge in the word it's so
[48:25] challenging if you love me keep my
[48:27] Commandments and I will it almost seems
[48:29] like one is dependent on the other amen
[48:33] like if you love me and keep my
[48:35] Commandments and then I will pray to the
[48:36] father and he shall give you another
[48:38] comforter that he may abide with you
[48:40] forever and it's not exactly like that
[48:42] so don't don't get nervous on me but
[48:44] it's just a there's amazing challenges
[48:46] here in the scriptures and I want to
[48:47] read another one down in verse 22 Judas
[48:50] saith unto him not a scariot lord how is
[48:52] it that thou will manifest thyself unto
[48:55] us and not unto the world Jesus answered
[48:57] and said unto him if a man love me he
[49:00] will keep my words and my father will
[49:03] love him and we will come into him and
[49:05] make our Abode with him what's he
[49:08] talking about he's talking about the
[49:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so he
[49:12] says if a man love me he will keep my
[49:15] words and my father will love
[49:18] him it it it almost looks like that the
[49:23] Father's Love is deter DET mined on our
[49:27] love but we know other scriptures that
[49:29] say otherwise we love him because he
[49:31] first loved us so it's not that God's
[49:34] waiting to see if we'll love him or not
[49:35] we know that God already knows and we
[49:38] love him because he first loved us and
[49:39] chose us before the foundation of the
[49:41] world if we ever love him it's only a
[49:42] reciprocating love it didn't originate
[49:44] in us it's reciprocating back to him but
[49:47] he's laying out a pattern and I don't
[49:49] want to miss the pattern and I also
[49:51] don't want to misunderstand the pattern
[49:53] if a man love me he will keep my my
[49:55] words well I love him but how do I love
[49:57] him because he first loved me by
[49:59] predestination so that kind of man that
[50:02] loves me is the same kind that'll keep
[50:04] my words by
[50:08] predestination and my father will love
[50:10] him and we will come into him and make
[50:12] our Abode with him he that loveth me not
[50:16] keepeth not my sayings and the word
[50:19] which you hear is not mine but the
[50:21] Father which sent
[50:23] me see how see how brother benam can so
[50:27] easily grab a some statements out of the
[50:29] Bible and say full obedience to the full
[50:31] word of God will entitle you to the
[50:33] Token he taking it right from the
[50:36] scriptures amen right from what Jesus
[50:38] said there in the Book of John and right
[50:40] from what Peter said in acts in Acts
[50:43] chapter 5 amen and it becomes an
[50:45] absolute truth full obedience to the
[50:47] full word of God what brings you to full
[50:49] obedience to the full word of God true
[50:51] repentance a true repentance will bring
[50:53] you to full obedience to the full word
[50:55] word of God because your mind will
[50:57] change about everything else and you'll
[50:59] understand that this is the way to walk
[51:01] in
[51:03] amen and then we our love will be
[51:05] expressed our by our
[51:08] obedience and God promised that they
[51:10] will make our Abode he'll make his Abode
[51:13] with
[51:15] us he said in the message the token
[51:17] don't you rely upon no speaking in
[51:20] tongues no nothing else but let the
[51:22] token itself be there the person of
[51:24] Jesus Christ his own life in you
[51:27] circumcise not just this and that but
[51:29] circumcise your whole being till you and
[51:32] Christ are one Christ in you and his
[51:35] life lives out through
[51:37] you amen Christ is the word he is the
[51:43] manifested word yes amen so I want to
[51:45] die out till me and this word that's
[51:48] been delivered are
[51:51] one amen so I want to just take a look
[51:55] and this is where I want to take a
[51:56] little bit of time in just a few minutes
[51:58] and I want to look at something in
[51:59] Balance here because there's always two
[52:01] things that are presented in the Bible
[52:03] and I want to keep them straight it
[52:05] looks as though we can say if we take
[52:08] the statement full obedience to the full
[52:10] word of God entitles you to the Token if
[52:12] we take that with a legalistic mindset
[52:14] we can think all I have to do is XYZ a b
[52:17] c if I do all of this then I
[52:19] automatically have it amen if I don't do
[52:21] this I don't get it it can and it can
[52:24] appear that way but it's not by legalism
[52:26] it's by love amen and it's still a
[52:30] reality no matter how we feel about it
[52:33] it's still the truth amen am
[52:36] Amen brother Brenham said I've always
[52:39] tried to keep a balance of the road you
[52:42] get away off inform formalism just as
[52:44] formal and ritualistic as you can be
[52:46] people grab for that lot then if you
[52:48] don't watch you'll get Plum off on the
[52:50] other side and be just as fanatic as you
[52:52] can be but there's a middle of the road
[52:54] where the TRU sounds gospel is preached
[52:57] and God moves in there vindicating the
[52:59] truth straight is the gate Narrows the
[53:01] way but few there be that find it he
[53:04] says again in another message the one
[53:06] the Oneness run off on jesus' name the
[53:08] Trinity went off on Father Son and Holy
[53:10] Ghost just like they did at 19 Council
[53:12] same thing they both was wrong but now
[53:15] in the middle of the road in the
[53:16] scriptures lays the
[53:19] truth now he's going to bring it down to
[53:21] the subject at hand he says You must be
[53:24] born again
[53:26] so not trying to squeeze in calvinistic
[53:28] belief now I'm not I'm saying this now
[53:31] that I'm talking to a legalist people
[53:34] he's speaking to Pentecostal people
[53:35] which were more of the
[53:37] Armenian Doctrine the great battle
[53:40] between calvinistic and noridian
[53:41] Doctrine if I could sum it up in 30
[53:43] seconds it's way more complex than this
[53:45] but Calvin believed in absolute
[53:47] predestination amen and and and the
[53:50] extreme Calvinism not necessarily as
[53:52] Calvin taught but Extreme Calvinism got
[53:54] to the point where there's no need for
[53:56] evangelism there's no need for this or
[53:57] that you're going to be saved regardless
[53:59] of you you were predestinated and you
[54:01] don't do anything about it you don't
[54:02] even have to H H pray a prayer of
[54:06] repentance right you're just absolutely
[54:08] predestined saved the Armenian says no
[54:11] you've got to make a choice and God has
[54:13] given man free moral agency and you've
[54:14] got to choose and you've got a right to
[54:16] choose you can choose to be saved or you
[54:17] can choose to be
[54:20] lost and brother renom grabbed from both
[54:23] of these and brought us the truth amen
[54:28] amen now somebody who really knows
[54:30] calvinist doct in Armenian they're going
[54:31] to crucify me for that but that that's a
[54:35] super duper condensed
[54:37] version he
[54:39] said that's not it that's not it at all
[54:42] because I'm a legalist too that's what
[54:44] brother bam said but I believe this that
[54:46] Calvin had something and so did Armenian
[54:49] have something and they both had
[54:51] something but they run off on the Deep
[54:52] ends of it the calvinist said well I'm
[54:55] saved and that just settles it his life
[54:58] proves that he
[55:00] isn't then he isn't
[55:03] saved he thought he was saved because he
[55:05] was predestinated he agreed with the
[55:06] scriptures but he had no change in his
[55:09] life and his life continued on as it was
[55:11] and he says his life proved that he
[55:13] wasn't yeah and the legalist says I've
[55:16] got to do this and I must do this and I
[55:18] must do that then if you're not born
[55:20] again you're still not saved so there
[55:22] you are so you can do all the do and you
[55:25] can don't all the don'ts but if you if
[55:27] you're not born again you're still not
[55:29] saved he says it's in between in the
[55:32] middle of the road is where we've got to
[55:34] stay amen what are you what calv what
[55:38] Calvinism is what Grace is is what God
[55:40] did for you but what works is is what
[55:43] you do for God in appreciation of what
[55:46] he did for you through Grace that's the
[55:49] whole answer am then if I'm saved then I
[55:52] live like I'm saved but listen to way
[55:55] says but I could live like I was saved
[55:57] and not be
[56:01] saved praise be to God so it's the fact
[56:05] that brings it to this spot that we must
[56:07] be born
[56:09] again so the Born Again experience tells
[56:11] us what we are it doesn't mean I believe
[56:14] in shouting and all the manifestations
[56:16] and demonstrations of the spirit but yet
[56:17] that's not it yet it's something
[56:20] different from that it's a new creature
[56:22] something in the heart amen so brother
[56:24] R's able to pull from two doctrines and
[56:27] bring them together and he he's doing
[56:29] this all the time he's pulling from
[56:30] Oneness and trinitarianism pull from
[56:31] Calvinism and Armenian ISM and he's all
[56:33] the time pulling it together and showing
[56:35] us the balance in the scriptures amen
[56:38] yeah and so the the reality is the word
[56:43] is
[56:45] true if you love me you'll keep my
[56:49] Commandments and if you do my father
[56:53] will come unto you and we'll make her
[56:54] abod in you that's absolutely the truth
[56:57] amen but not because you were able to
[57:00] keep an ordinance but because you loved
[57:02] him you kept his Commandments and you
[57:05] loved him because he predestinated you
[57:07] and loved you first and if he didn't
[57:08] love you first you couldn't love him and
[57:10] if you didn't love him you couldn't keep
[57:11] his
[57:12] Commandments it's not keeping the
[57:14] Commandments without love and it's not
[57:16] love without keeping the Commandments
[57:18] but you put the two together and you got
[57:20] the right picture according to the
[57:22] scripture and that's why full OB
[57:24] obedience to the whole word of God will
[57:26] entitle you to the Token amen not a
[57:29] legalistic keeping of message standards
[57:31] but an absolute love and revelation of
[57:33] what this message is that causes you to
[57:36] want to die to yourself and want nothing
[57:38] else but this word amen and when you
[57:40] surrender that way because you love it
[57:43] because you love this message because
[57:44] you love everything about it because you
[57:46] love what Jesus Christ has done for you
[57:48] in this day and that what he's given to
[57:50] you and you value it more than the
[57:51] breath that you breathe amen and when
[57:53] you surrender to that full obedience to
[57:55] the full word of God with that kind of
[57:57] love will entitle you to the
[57:59] Token that's right because why that
[58:02] comes from a true
[58:05] repentance
[58:08] amen amen I want to show two more
[58:10] examples of the same thought just as we
[58:13] move
[58:14] on it's amazing how in every group of
[58:19] Believers every
[58:20] church we have some who lean one way and
[58:23] some who lean the other
[58:26] it's true I'm going to say it and you
[58:28] all know it and you'll get pictures in
[58:30] your mind but don't blurt out
[58:33] names you have some who are a little
[58:35] more
[58:36] strict and they a little more firm and
[58:39] they they know the guidelines and they
[58:40] see the guidelines and and they want to
[58:42] stay with the guidelines right and I'm
[58:45] not calling them wrong that's just the
[58:46] way they lean you have others who lean
[58:48] towards Grace and they're a little more
[58:50] flexible and they give a little more
[58:52] grace and say you know what God looks at
[58:53] the heart anyways he's is not looking at
[58:55] all these things you can do all those
[58:56] things and still be
[58:58] wrong right and then the other ones over
[59:01] here saying you know what you can say
[59:03] you love God all you want but if you
[59:04] won't surrender and sacrifice for him do
[59:06] you really love him if you won't do what
[59:08] he says is that love the other ones are
[59:10] saying you can do everything he says but
[59:12] that still doesn't mean you love
[59:16] him and in every in every group we got
[59:19] some that leave one way the other praise
[59:21] God because that keeps us together in
[59:23] balance
[59:25] we need that thing we you'll see brother
[59:27] brandom he'll come and preach this
[59:28] subject all the way over on this other
[59:30] side amen it's all predestination and
[59:32] you didn't have anything to do with it
[59:34] and it's going to happen regardless and
[59:35] blah blah blah then he comes over here
[59:37] and says you better accept him now you
[59:39] better get down to this
[59:42] altar amen so I thank God Amen that we
[59:46] have a diversity here that'll keep us
[59:48] Balan amen when you're when you're
[59:50] walking on the tight RPP amen you never
[59:52] see that Long Rod that they got amen
[59:54] we'll just call that the word of God
[59:56] Amen because I need something to keep me
[59:58] going because it's so easy for me myself
[1:00:01] to get me off we need we need that
[1:00:03] balance of the word of God because you
[1:00:05] can take the word of God and you can go
[1:00:07] either
[1:00:08] direction and the message broken
[1:00:11] sisters he
[1:00:13] says he's telling a story about a man
[1:00:16] that he led to the
[1:00:18] Lord he said he was talking to them out
[1:00:20] in the old barn stall One Day by a
[1:00:22] manger and he said but I'm no good I he
[1:00:24] said I know you're not said I'm not
[1:00:26] either but I said you're looking at what
[1:00:28] you are and quit looking at what you are
[1:00:30] and look at what he
[1:00:31] is he said if I could just get rid of
[1:00:33] these cigarettes brother brandham I'd be
[1:00:35] a
[1:00:36] Christian I said don't get rid of them
[1:00:38] you're trying to get good and then come
[1:00:40] to him he never came to save good men he
[1:00:43] came to save bad men that know they were
[1:00:45] bad amen he said well I said listen you
[1:00:49] don't want to go to hell do you he said
[1:00:50] no I said well why don't you do it uh
[1:00:53] you don't I said you you don't have to
[1:00:55] he died that you might not have to go he
[1:00:57] said what do I have to do I said I said
[1:01:00] nothing it's just that simple he said
[1:01:02] but if I could ever I said there you go
[1:01:04] back to the cigarettes again quit
[1:01:06] thinking about that cigarette just
[1:01:08] remember think about him what he did
[1:01:11] what he is not what you are you're no
[1:01:14] good and you never was and you never
[1:01:16] will be but what he is he's the one and
[1:01:19] I said now the only one thing you have
[1:01:22] to do if he took your place down there
[1:01:24] you just willingly accept what he did
[1:01:27] only thing you have to do is just accept
[1:01:29] it why he said that's simple I'll do
[1:01:32] that I said here's that the creek said I
[1:01:35] brought him up there and I baptized him
[1:01:37] in the name of Jesus Christ some of his
[1:01:40] people are sitting here I know they felt
[1:01:42] funny at me for doing that but I knowed
[1:01:44] what I was
[1:01:45] doing I seen in the man something that
[1:01:49] was
[1:01:50] genuine I could see it there and I took
[1:01:53] him and baptized him in in the name of
[1:01:54] the Lord Jesus and when we did that it
[1:01:57] wasn't long after that till I was went
[1:01:59] down to his son's house we seen a vision
[1:02:03] of a tree being broke at a certain place
[1:02:05] and the man fell almost broke his back
[1:02:07] took him to the hospital and that night
[1:02:09] the Lord revealed to me that that was
[1:02:11] the end of the
[1:02:13] cigarettes the next day he wanted some
[1:02:15] cigarettes I said I'll buy him a carton
[1:02:17] and take it to him you just watch and
[1:02:18] see his cigarette days are done he never
[1:02:21] smoked one since and never wanted one
[1:02:24] sense
[1:02:25] amen I love that what a beautiful
[1:02:29] picture amen now let's read the next
[1:02:32] quote marriage of the Lamb
[1:02:35] 1962 and that we know that there is
[1:02:37] going to be a bride and there's going to
[1:02:39] be a wedding supper served in the skies
[1:02:41] that's just as sure to be as God is
[1:02:43] because it's the word and we know that
[1:02:45] those that are going to make up that
[1:02:46] bride is going to be his church and
[1:02:48] they're going to appear before him
[1:02:49] without spot or wrinkle and they have
[1:02:51] the material on earth now to make
[1:02:53] themselves ready if you notice she has
[1:02:55] made herself ready so many says if the
[1:02:58] Lord will take this evil spirit from me
[1:03:00] from drinking or gambling or from lying
[1:03:01] or stealing I'll serve him but that's up
[1:03:04] to
[1:03:05] you see you got to do something too yes
[1:03:10] amen they that overcome Shalla herit all
[1:03:12] things they that overcome you have the
[1:03:15] power to do it but you must be willing
[1:03:16] to lay it down and she has made herself
[1:03:19] ready I like that word you see God could
[1:03:21] not push us through a little pipe pull
[1:03:23] us out the other end and then saying
[1:03:25] blessed is he that overcometh you have
[1:03:27] nothing to overcome he just pushed you
[1:03:29] through but you've got to make decisions
[1:03:31] for yourself I have to make decisions
[1:03:33] for myself in doing that we show our
[1:03:36] faith and respects to
[1:03:39] God so he told the man don't worry about
[1:03:41] the
[1:03:42] cigarettes don't worry about it the next
[1:03:45] one he says you've got to lay that down
[1:03:46] yourself you've got to make your own
[1:03:48] decision you're asking God to take it
[1:03:49] away so you serve him but you've got to
[1:03:51] make your
[1:03:53] decision good
[1:03:55] oh I love the message it won't let us
[1:03:58] amen go one way or go the other amen it
[1:04:01] has we have to be honest when we read
[1:04:03] the message because it has to keep
[1:04:04] bringing us back to the middle and the
[1:04:06] re the reality is if you can lay it down
[1:04:09] if you've got a hold of something and
[1:04:10] can turn it loose you've got to turn it
[1:04:12] Loos yeah amen but if something's got a
[1:04:16] hold of
[1:04:17] you and you can't turn it loose you need
[1:04:20] a supernatural deliverance from almighty
[1:04:22] God God the reality is they are both
[1:04:26] true amen amen sometimes we we want God
[1:04:29] to make it easy for us cuz we want no
[1:04:31] struggle God take away the desire take
[1:04:33] away the Temptation take away all of
[1:04:35] this and I'll serve your lord and I'll
[1:04:37] I'll do all this but no you've got to
[1:04:39] fight your way through it you've got to
[1:04:41] lay it down you've got to resist the
[1:04:42] flesh you've got to fight against the
[1:04:44] devil if you can lay it down and you can
[1:04:46] resist it then you lay it down and you
[1:04:48] resist it but when something's got a
[1:04:50] hold of you not you got a hold of
[1:04:51] something but something's got a hold of
[1:04:53] you and you hate it and you LOE it and
[1:04:55] you want to be free amen just trust God
[1:04:58] and move forward God will deliver you
[1:05:00] from that righten they're both true amen
[1:05:04] they can both be true at the exact same
[1:05:06] time amen I mean we have an obligation
[1:05:09] to live a clean life we have an
[1:05:11] obligation to live for God we have an
[1:05:13] obligation to make decisions to match
[1:05:15] his word we have an obligation to lay
[1:05:16] everything down that's contrary to his
[1:05:18] word and follow his word we're obligated
[1:05:20] to do that but When Something's Got a
[1:05:23] Hold On Us and we can't lay it down we
[1:05:25] can't give it up and we can't get free
[1:05:27] that doesn't stop us from serving the
[1:05:29] lord that doesn't stop us from moving
[1:05:30] forward but we've got to be honest with
[1:05:32] God and say God I got to have a
[1:05:34] Deliverance of this I can't serve you
[1:05:36] like this I can't go on like this and I
[1:05:38] can't get rid of it
[1:05:40] myself and then trust God for the part
[1:05:43] that we can't do
[1:05:45] amen you see how they're both true y one
[1:05:49] will take the lazy way if God wants me
[1:05:52] to be free he'll make me free when God
[1:05:54] takes us no
[1:05:56] friends you can see in this first story
[1:05:59] that man was genuine he didn't want to
[1:06:00] smoke he was trapped he wanted to give
[1:06:03] his heart to the Lord he wanted to serve
[1:06:05] God but he was going to wait till he get
[1:06:06] rid cigarettes and he had no way to get
[1:06:08] rid of him on his own amen so brother
[1:06:10] Brenham gave him good advice and told
[1:06:12] him just trust in Christ and look to him
[1:06:14] and not to yourself amen the next story
[1:06:16] he talking about somebody spiritually
[1:06:18] lazy who just wants God to do all the
[1:06:20] work and make life simple with no
[1:06:21] struggle and no strife
[1:06:24] he says no you've got to be an overcomer
[1:06:27] and you've got to have something to
[1:06:28] overcome yourself and God's not just
[1:06:30] going to pull you through a pipe and
[1:06:32] pull you out the other side and say you
[1:06:33] overcome you overcame nothing you've got
[1:06:35] to make your decision you've got to lay
[1:06:37] it down you've got to choose to serve
[1:06:41] God I love
[1:06:43] it is it this or is it that won't we
[1:06:46] just bring it together and get the right
[1:06:48] picture
[1:06:50] amen let's go to Acts
[1:06:52] 26 book of of Acts chapter 26 I'm going
[1:06:56] to grab another verse here as we wind
[1:07:09] down Acts chapter 26 verse
[1:07:17] 19 this is the Apostle Paul in Acts Acts
[1:07:21] 26: 19 whereon king of grippa I was not
[1:07:25] disobedient to the heavenly vision but
[1:07:28] showed first unto them of Damascus and
[1:07:30] at Jerusalem and throughout all the
[1:07:32] coast of Judea and then to the Gentiles
[1:07:34] that they should repent and turn to God
[1:07:37] and do the works meet for
[1:07:40] repentance I love this teaching of the
[1:07:42] Apostle Paul he said he was going
[1:07:44] everywhere
[1:07:45] teaching that they should repent and
[1:07:47] turn to God that's the first thing that
[1:07:49] he began to preach and that's what Peter
[1:07:51] began to preach and that's the gospel
[1:07:53] message repent and turn repent and be
[1:07:55] converted that word turn is the same
[1:07:57] that's translated converted elsewhere
[1:07:59] repent change your mind and be converted
[1:08:01] be turned
[1:08:03] back but then he
[1:08:07] says and do Works meet for
[1:08:11] repentance here the Apostle Paul doesn't
[1:08:14] leave it just repent and be converted
[1:08:17] but he says do Works meat for repentance
[1:08:20] this word
[1:08:22] meat the word the word works is just
[1:08:24] works or deeds we simply know that but
[1:08:26] the word meat it means to have the
[1:08:30] weight of another things of like value
[1:08:33] worth as much or corresponding to a
[1:08:37] thing so we should bring forth
[1:08:43] Works
[1:08:45] corresponding to
[1:08:47] repentance or with worth as much as our
[1:08:51] repentance or as weighty or of like
[1:08:54] value as our
[1:08:56] repentance and that's why so many times
[1:08:59] our works actually declare our level of
[1:09:04] repentance it's a it's a ratio and
[1:09:07] that's what he's saying bring forth
[1:09:09] Works meat are in same value or
[1:09:13] corresponding to repentance the change
[1:09:15] of mind and this explains so many things
[1:09:19] that we see all around us sometimes
[1:09:21] because you see sometimes people living
[1:09:23] in a in a in a compromised life and
[1:09:25] they're and they're in Disobedience and
[1:09:27] continual Disobedience and you wonder
[1:09:29] why and you realize their mind really
[1:09:31] hasn't been made up for the message amen
[1:09:33] they might be going along they might be
[1:09:35] sympathetic but there's not a real true
[1:09:37] absolute knowing that this is absolutely
[1:09:40] nothing but the truth am and you find
[1:09:43] works that are meat for that level of
[1:09:46] repentance yeah and sometimes you
[1:09:48] scratch your head and you wonder how can
[1:09:50] they continue to to choose this and how
[1:09:52] can they continue to go that and then
[1:09:54] you realize there's not been an absolute
[1:09:56] change in understanding they're not
[1:09:58] really understanding what the message is
[1:10:01] the message is not a better
[1:10:03] teaching the message is not a clearer
[1:10:06] understanding all of those are included
[1:10:08] in the message but amen this message is
[1:10:11] none other than Jesus Christ completely
[1:10:13] unveiled
[1:10:15] amen me if we take it if we take the
[1:10:18] prophet of God as as as another church
[1:10:21] age messenger who just brought a reform
[1:10:23] and he's another preacher who's a little
[1:10:24] bit better than the other preacher amen
[1:10:26] we got to realize this isn't just a good
[1:10:28] preacher these aren't just good sermons
[1:10:31] amen this this is the seventh angel amen
[1:10:33] this is the one in Revelation 10:7 this
[1:10:35] is the Elijah of Malachi 4 amen when
[1:10:38] when when when Jesus says of the Apostle
[1:10:41] uh uh of John or not not the Apostle
[1:10:43] when he says of John the Baptist he was
[1:10:45] more than a prophet you can take the
[1:10:47] same thing right to the prophet in our
[1:10:49] day he was more than a prophet amen he
[1:10:51] was a prophet to bring the Covenant amen
[1:10:53] he was a fulfillment of Revelation 10:7
[1:10:55] it was more than just a prophet it was
[1:10:58] more than just a church age
[1:11:00] messenger amen but you can see the level
[1:11:04] of works sometimes matches the level of
[1:11:07] repentance true when we see brother
[1:11:09] brandom as a good man and and and he's a
[1:11:12] messenger and and but but you
[1:11:16] know he thought this and he did this and
[1:11:19] you know the Bible says this and he said
[1:11:21] that oh my goodness we're playing in
[1:11:23] dangerous games right now because we're
[1:11:25] belittling the very voice that God used
[1:11:28] in this day amen the voice of God came
[1:11:30] through that man's vocal CS to give us
[1:11:32] the true interpretation of the word with
[1:11:35] Divine Vindication and when we start
[1:11:37] playing around with that it starts to
[1:11:39] show exactly where our repentance was
[1:11:41] we're not so sure we understand what
[1:11:43] this message is or who this messenger is
[1:11:48] right and the works are meat to the
[1:11:55] repentance praise God say God wash my
[1:12:00] understanding amen give me a true
[1:12:03] understanding of what you've done in
[1:12:05] this day amen make it a reality to me so
[1:12:08] I know beyond a shadow of a doubt what
[1:12:11] day I live in and what you've done in
[1:12:13] this day
[1:12:19] amen praise
[1:12:22] God
[1:12:25] amen let's go to Genesis
[1:12:41] 22 Genesis 22
[1:12:48] and10 in Genesis 22: 10 it says and
[1:12:52] Abraham stretched forth for his hand and
[1:12:54] took the knife to slay his son the angel
[1:12:56] of the Lord called unto him out of
[1:12:58] heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he
[1:13:01] said here am I and he said lay not thy
[1:13:04] hand upon the lad neither do anything
[1:13:06] unto him for now I know that thou
[1:13:08] fearest God saying thou has not withheld
[1:13:11] thy son thine only son from me amen
[1:13:17] question is did God not know that he
[1:13:19] feared him
[1:13:21] before the angel of the Lord called on
[1:13:23] says now I know that thou fearest God
[1:13:28] but surely he already knew what was in
[1:13:30] Abraham's
[1:13:31] heart but still Abraham needed to act
[1:13:35] out his faith and when Abraham acted
[1:13:38] upon his faith amen the angel stayed his
[1:13:41] hand and the angel of the Lord said now
[1:13:43] I know that thou fearest God I don't
[1:13:46] think that was a new revelation I think
[1:13:48] it was a declaration amen that you have
[1:13:50] proved your faith amen amen you have
[1:13:54] proved and Vindicated what you
[1:13:57] believe and works as Faith expressed the
[1:14:00] prophet says now the two men that were
[1:14:01] talking on faith Paul Justified Abraham
[1:14:04] by what God saw in Abraham but James
[1:14:06] Justified Abraham by what man saw in
[1:14:08] Abraham see now James said he justified
[1:14:11] by his Works Paul said he's justified by
[1:14:13] faith but see Abraham believed God
[1:14:15] that's what God saw in him he believed
[1:14:17] it but then when he went into action as
[1:14:20] though it was already done that's what
[1:14:22] man saw in him and that's the same thing
[1:14:25] as it is to us because our works Express
[1:14:28] what faith we
[1:14:30] have remember bring forth Works meet for
[1:14:33] repentance amen our works Express what
[1:14:36] faith we have but if we're afraid to act
[1:14:39] on what we believe then we do not
[1:14:41] believe it see you've got to believe
[1:14:44] it amen let's go to Romans let's just I
[1:14:48] want to read a couple scriptures here as
[1:14:50] we we finish up but I'm going to read
[1:14:51] Romans and we're going to read in James
[1:14:53] Romans chapter 4
[1:15:01] first Romans chapter
[1:15:04] 4 verse 1 what shall we say then that
[1:15:08] Abraham our father as pertaineth to the
[1:15:10] flesh hath found for If Abraham were
[1:15:12] justified by works Heath weof to Glory
[1:15:15] but not before God for what saith the
[1:15:18] scriptures Abraham believed God and it
[1:15:21] was counted on him for righteousness now
[1:15:23] to him that worketh is the reward not
[1:15:25] reckoned of Grace but of debt but to him
[1:15:28] that worketh not but believeth on him
[1:15:30] that justifieth the ungodly his faith is
[1:15:33] counted for righteousness so Paul's very
[1:15:36] clearly saying it's not by works but
[1:15:38] it's by faith and by faith it was count
[1:15:40] to him for righteousness now hold your
[1:15:42] hand here and turn with me to the Book
[1:15:44] of
[1:15:47] James remember the word cannot
[1:15:50] contradict itself amen amen
[1:15:57] James chapter
[1:15:59] 2 verse
[1:16:03] 14 what doth it profit my brethren
[1:16:06] though a man say ye hath faith and have
[1:16:08] not works can Faith save him if a
[1:16:11] brother or sister be naked and destitute
[1:16:13] of daily food and one of you say unto
[1:16:15] them depart in peace be you warmed and
[1:16:16] filled notwithstanding you give them not
[1:16:19] those things which are needful to the
[1:16:21] body what doth do it Propet even so
[1:16:25] faith if it hath not works is dead being
[1:16:29] alone now listen Paul just said it was
[1:16:32] faith without
[1:16:35] works now it looks like James is saying
[1:16:38] something
[1:16:39] different notice as it looks like the
[1:16:42] Bible cannot contradict
[1:16:44] itself
[1:16:47] amen so even so verse 17 again if if it
[1:16:51] hath not works or faith if hath not
[1:16:53] works is dead being alone yay a man may
[1:16:57] say thou Hast faith and I have Works
[1:16:59] show me thy faith without thy works and
[1:17:02] I will show thee my faith by my Works
[1:17:05] thou believest that there is one God
[1:17:06] thou doest well the Devils also believe
[1:17:08] in tremble but wilt thou now oh vain man
[1:17:11] that wil uh but wilt thou know oh vain
[1:17:15] man that faith without works is dead was
[1:17:19] not Abraham Our Father justified by
[1:17:21] works wait a second what did Paul say he
[1:17:24] was justified by
[1:17:26] faith was not Abraham Our Father
[1:17:29] justified by works when he had offered
[1:17:31] Isaac his son upon the altar seest thou
[1:17:33] how Faith wrought with his works and by
[1:17:35] works was Faith made perfect and the
[1:17:39] scripture was fulfilled which saith
[1:17:41] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[1:17:44] unto him for righteousness and he was
[1:17:45] called the friend of God you see then
[1:17:47] how that by works a man is Justified and
[1:17:50] not by faith only
[1:17:54] oh I love this this is what makes some
[1:17:57] people's heads spin amen but you realize
[1:18:00] when you put the two of these things
[1:18:02] together like brother Benham said
[1:18:03] brother Benham said works is the
[1:18:05] testimony before man man saw the works
[1:18:08] and they saw Abraham's faith God looked
[1:18:11] at Abraham's faith and he recognized it
[1:18:13] works is what man says but but also amen
[1:18:16] faith is our love to God and works
[1:18:18] proves our love to
[1:18:20] God and and James is not James is not
[1:18:23] contradicting Paul and Paul's not
[1:18:25] contradicting James but what Paul is
[1:18:28] saying is you can say that you believe
[1:18:30] all you want you say you believe in one
[1:18:32] God so do the devils and they tremble so
[1:18:35] what amen if it doesn't produce works in
[1:18:38] your life you don't really believe it
[1:18:42] that's what James is saying what you
[1:18:44] believe becomes your life amen what
[1:18:47] that's why you bring forth Works meat
[1:18:49] for repentance because what you believe
[1:18:51] comes into manifest estation and becomes
[1:18:53] part of your life and that's why he says
[1:18:56] amen uh uh Works wrought with uh
[1:18:58] Abraham's faith and Abraham's Faith by
[1:19:01] works was made perfect what does it mean
[1:19:04] perfect completed it was fully
[1:19:06] manifested what was in his heart came on
[1:19:08] display and the angel of the Lord said
[1:19:10] now I know that thou fear God because it
[1:19:13] was a complete perfect Faith because
[1:19:15] it'd come into
[1:19:17] manifestation now that doesn't mean now
[1:19:19] now I told you to hold your place so
[1:19:21] let's go back
[1:19:24] Romans chapter 4 so what is the Apostle
[1:19:27] Paul talking about because it looks like
[1:19:29] he's saying Works without works it
[1:19:31] doesn't require works if it was by works
[1:19:33] it would be by debt it's by faith alone
[1:19:35] that's what it looks like he's saying
[1:19:37] and and it is what he's saying but if
[1:19:39] you go to the previous chapter chapter
[1:19:42] 3 just before chapter 4 before he says
[1:19:46] all of this in chapter 3 look at verse
[1:19:48] 19 now we know that the things soever
[1:19:51] the law saith that say to them who are
[1:19:53] under the law that every mouth may be
[1:19:55] stopped and all the world may become
[1:19:56] guilty before God therefore by the Deeds
[1:19:59] of the law there shall no flesh be
[1:20:01] justified in his side for by the law is
[1:20:03] the knowledge of
[1:20:05] sin we could go all the way down but let
[1:20:08] me just let me just cut down here to
[1:20:11] uh verse
[1:20:14] 26 to declare I say at this time his
[1:20:16] righteousness that he might be just and
[1:20:18] the justifier of him which believeth in
[1:20:20] Jesus where is boasting then it is a
[1:20:22] excluded by what law of Works nay but by
[1:20:25] the law of Faith therefore we conclude
[1:20:28] that a man is justified by faith without
[1:20:31] the Deeds of the
[1:20:33] law when he's talking about works in the
[1:20:35] next chapter what's he talking about
[1:20:37] he's talking about the Old Testament law
[1:20:39] right he's not saying that you're not
[1:20:42] supposed to do the word of go keep the
[1:20:44] word of God and do the works that God
[1:20:45] has called us to that's not the point
[1:20:47] he's talking about the law you can never
[1:20:49] be saved by keeping the law all the
[1:20:51] works you want to do does not make God
[1:20:53] indebted to you he doesn't have to save
[1:20:56] you just because you kept the law the
[1:20:57] law was here to prove that you couldn't
[1:21:00] do it it was here to condemn you not to
[1:21:02] save
[1:21:04] you
[1:21:06] amen therefore we conclude that a man is
[1:21:09] justified by faith without the Deeds of
[1:21:11] the law is is he the god of the Jews
[1:21:13] only is he not also of the Gentiles yes
[1:21:16] of the Gentiles also so then he comes
[1:21:19] over to chapter 4 and he starts saying
[1:21:21] amen what shall we then say Abraham our
[1:21:23] fathers pertaineth to Faith hath found
[1:21:25] for If Abraham were justified by works
[1:21:27] he ha where of to Glory but not before
[1:21:29] God for what sayith the scriptures
[1:21:31] Abraham believed God and it was counted
[1:21:33] unto him for righteousness you know that
[1:21:36] that James quotes this exact same thing
[1:21:39] so they're believing the exact same
[1:21:41] thing they're just coming at it from two
[1:21:43] different angles amen Paul is showing
[1:21:46] the the the the Jews and they're showing
[1:21:47] that you don't have to carry this over
[1:21:49] into the New Testament into the Gentiles
[1:21:51] you can keep the law you want that
[1:21:53] doesn't obligate God or put God in debt
[1:21:57] to you God is recognizing your faith and
[1:22:00] by faith he's imputing to you
[1:22:01] righteousness James is coming and saying
[1:22:04] you can tell me you believe all you want
[1:22:06] but if there is no Works coming from
[1:22:07] your faith your faith is dead and it's
[1:22:10] in vain
[1:22:12] amen both are
[1:22:15] true
[1:22:18] amen
[1:22:21] amen
[1:22:23] let's go back to
[1:22:25] James go to James chapter
[1:22:33] 1 verse
[1:22:38] 22 says but be ye doers of the word and
[1:22:41] not hearers only deceiving your own
[1:22:45] selves for if any be a hearer of the
[1:22:47] word and not a doer he is like unto a
[1:22:49] man beholding his natural face in a
[1:22:51] glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth
[1:22:54] his way and straightway
[1:22:56] forgetthe was but who so lookth unto the
[1:22:59] perfect law of Liberty and continue
[1:23:01] therein he being not a forgetful hearer
[1:23:04] but a doer of the work this man shall be
[1:23:06] blessed in his
[1:23:09] deed I said I don't want to be a hearer
[1:23:14] only brother bam said in the message
[1:23:17] perseverance he said in the whole armor
[1:23:19] of God is Faith love joy peace
[1:23:21] longsuffering goodness meekness
[1:23:23] gentleness patience the whole armor of
[1:23:25] the believer is faith we believe God by
[1:23:27] faith because God said so then what is
[1:23:30] it Abraham was justified by Paul by
[1:23:33] faith but by James by works Abraham was
[1:23:37] talking what God saw James was talking
[1:23:39] what man saw show me your faith by your
[1:23:42] Works without your works and so forth
[1:23:44] then if you don't have works with your
[1:23:46] faith it shows you haven't got faith
[1:23:49] you're just talking from your mouth I
[1:23:53] love the
[1:23:54] prophet if you don't have works with
[1:23:56] your faith that shows you haven't got
[1:23:57] faith you're just talking from your
[1:23:58] mouth but if you really got faith you
[1:24:01] believe it and act like it that's right
[1:24:04] put it in action Noah did he put it in
[1:24:09] action I love how he goes to that he
[1:24:12] went right on ahead building the ark
[1:24:14] Noah received the message for his day is
[1:24:17] that right yes Noah preached the message
[1:24:20] for his day Noah believed the message
[1:24:22] for his
[1:24:24] day and you have to say was Noah saved
[1:24:27] by faith
[1:24:30] alone without
[1:24:34] works Noah's Works were a Vindication of
[1:24:37] his faith and as his as this Faith come
[1:24:40] into Vindication it actually built the
[1:24:42] ark that saved
[1:24:44] him did Noah believe yes did other
[1:24:48] people work on the ark yes there was
[1:24:50] other people who worked on the ark there
[1:24:51] was probably lots of people who worked
[1:24:53] on the ark were they in the ark when the
[1:24:55] rains came no because they did The Works
[1:24:57] without faith but Noah did the works
[1:25:00] with faith and he was in the ship when
[1:25:02] the rain started to fall The Works and
[1:25:04] Faith came together in the message in
[1:25:06] that day
[1:25:08] amen so simple friends it's so simple I
[1:25:13] can say I believe the message all I want
[1:25:15] I believe the messenger I believe the
[1:25:16] message but you know what my actions
[1:25:19] actually prove where my heart really is
[1:25:23] and I'm ashamed to say that many times I
[1:25:25] found myself loving myself more than
[1:25:26] loving the message or the messenger but
[1:25:28] I've had to repent and repent and repent
[1:25:30] so I keep washing by the water of the
[1:25:32] word washing my own understanding until
[1:25:34] I I quit valuing my own opinion and I
[1:25:37] start putting value where God put value
[1:25:40] in the word that he delivered to
[1:25:42] us amen and I believe we still need some
[1:25:47] washing brother Ram said in the token
[1:25:49] I'm going to come back now to the Token
[1:25:50] as we close said oh that's nonsense what
[1:25:54] they talk about up there is crazy why
[1:25:56] there's no such a thing why you women
[1:25:58] there oh why you don't what's your
[1:26:00] you're dressing it what it does and
[1:26:03] brother R's not finishing his sentence
[1:26:04] he's clipping them but he he's talking
[1:26:06] about uh those who are are are sarcastic
[1:26:09] and they're talking about the Believers
[1:26:11] said what's your dressing and he's
[1:26:12] talking about what's your dressing have
[1:26:13] to do with it you can tell by the
[1:26:15] context and brother M said it does the
[1:26:18] Bible said so what your hair have any
[1:26:20] and he clipped it again said the the
[1:26:22] Bible said so that's just a differ see
[1:26:25] touch not handle not taste not he is God
[1:26:29] see now it does mean
[1:26:32] something brother man's not saying it
[1:26:34] doesn't mean anything he says no it
[1:26:36] means something the way we dress the way
[1:26:39] we we cut our hair and not cut our hair
[1:26:41] the way we conduct ourselves the things
[1:26:43] we do and we don't do it does mean
[1:26:45] something it's not that it has no
[1:26:47] meaning the problem is if you make your
[1:26:50] salvation based on that with no genuine
[1:26:52] faith it will do you no good you'll be
[1:26:53] bankrupt at the end of the day but my
[1:26:55] goodness if you have faith but you won't
[1:26:57] have the audacity to do what the
[1:26:58] messenger taught it shows you don't
[1:27:00] really believe correctly about the
[1:27:02] messenger
[1:27:04] right the two have to come
[1:27:08] together he again further down in the
[1:27:10] token he says why you know that day when
[1:27:12] Rahab the Harlot put that string down
[1:27:14] that string I imagine some of them
[1:27:16] soldiers laughed and made fun said that
[1:27:18] crazy old woman up there she's off her
[1:27:20] head look her
[1:27:23] uh look her got it in there and they
[1:27:26] started laughing why did you ever hear
[1:27:27] of such Why Dr Jones sat down there
[1:27:30] there ain't nothing to that but there
[1:27:32] was because a messenger from God brought
[1:27:34] the message and told
[1:27:36] them could you imagine the Egyptians
[1:27:38] saying look say look at the crazy bunch
[1:27:40] of Holy Rollers putting blood haha won't
[1:27:43] that have a mess to wash off now oh my
[1:27:45] then big fine homes all covered with
[1:27:47] blood oh such a stink I bet you that'll
[1:27:50] be horrible in a few days and won't mean
[1:27:52] a thing you know why Holy Father so and
[1:27:55] so but there was it was it did mean
[1:27:59] something
[1:28:02] amen why did it mean something because
[1:28:05] God's Prophet told him to do
[1:28:09] it and because God's Prophet told him to
[1:28:12] do it it meant
[1:28:15] something when The Messengers from the
[1:28:17] presence of Joshua came into Jericho
[1:28:19] amen what did that Scarlet thread have
[1:28:21] to do with anything what did that piece
[1:28:23] of cord had to do with anything how was
[1:28:26] a piece of cord going to save somebody
[1:28:28] it wasn't that it was her obedience to
[1:28:30] what the messengers told
[1:28:33] her it signaled a
[1:28:40] covenant What was the blood of a lamb
[1:28:42] over a
[1:28:44] door it was what God instructed them
[1:28:47] through a
[1:28:50] prophet when they had resp respect for
[1:28:52] God's Prophet they were
[1:28:56] saved by
[1:28:58] what Rahab was saved I going to ask you
[1:29:01] what was Rahab saved
[1:29:04] by what effort what work what what what
[1:29:07] all did she have to do to be saved in
[1:29:10] that day she just had to do what the
[1:29:13] messengers told her to do right amen
[1:29:16] simple obedience to the
[1:29:19] instructions
[1:29:20] amen
[1:29:23] I don't want to make it super
[1:29:26] complicated I just want to believe the
[1:29:28] messag amen I want to believe it with my
[1:29:30] whole heart I want to believe it with no
[1:29:32] inhibitions I want anything that's
[1:29:34] holding me back I want it to be purged
[1:29:35] out of my life so that I can fully
[1:29:37] Embrace what God has brought us in this
[1:29:40] day because full obedience to the full
[1:29:43] word of God entitles us to the
[1:29:46] Token brother bam says I've read this
[1:29:48] the last two sermons we preached from
[1:29:50] the token he says don't just come this
[1:29:51] far are I believe the message you obey
[1:29:54] the
[1:29:55] messenger amen come into Christ you say
[1:29:58] well I believe every word said brother
[1:30:00] that's good but that's just being able
[1:30:02] to read take the message take it into
[1:30:05] your heart that you must have the token
[1:30:08] the very life that was in Christ be in
[1:30:09] you when I see that I will pass over you
[1:30:13] amen
[1:30:15] amen again in the token he says what
[1:30:18] does what does he do then when you have
[1:30:21] when you can present present the token
[1:30:22] with your prayer when you have the token
[1:30:25] and you can present the token with your
[1:30:26] prayer it shows that you have fully come
[1:30:29] to obedience to the whole word of God
[1:30:32] then you've got the token it shows that
[1:30:34] you have obeyed every word then you and
[1:30:37] the word are one you're only asking for
[1:30:40] the thing that you
[1:30:43] are you become the word by letting the
[1:30:45] word flow through you you become the
[1:30:47] word by receiving the word what is the
[1:30:49] message the word it's Christ it's the
[1:30:51] word it's the anointed word for our day
[1:30:53] and when we receive the word we become
[1:30:56] the word and when you present your token
[1:30:58] with your prayer you're only asking for
[1:31:00] what you are and when you present that
[1:31:02] token it's an evidence that you have
[1:31:04] obeyed every word that's what the
[1:31:06] prophet
[1:31:08] says so you can't tell me obeying is not
[1:31:11] important obeying is
[1:31:13] pivotal it's crucial am it's an
[1:31:16] expression of what we
[1:31:20] believe
[1:31:23] this is what brother bam says towards
[1:31:24] the end of the token and I want to
[1:31:26] finish with
[1:31:27] this says now this is this is good
[1:31:30] instruction right now now just sweetly
[1:31:33] and humbly with all that's in your heart
[1:31:36] weigh down deep just accept
[1:31:40] it not in our
[1:31:43] brains our brains are so
[1:31:45] fickle they'll agree one day and
[1:31:47] disagree the
[1:31:49] next it'll come easy one time will come
[1:31:52] hard the next time you'll understand it
[1:31:54] during one sermon the next sermon you
[1:31:55] won't even understand
[1:31:57] it that's our
[1:32:02] brains but sweetly and humbly with all
[1:32:05] that's in your heart weigh down deep
[1:32:09] just accept
[1:32:10] it don't fight it don't try to work
[1:32:15] around it don't try to find a way to
[1:32:19] still have what we want and have the
[1:32:21] message to
[1:32:22] just accept it for what it
[1:32:26] is it's Christ in our
[1:32:29] day it's the full word of God Amen the
[1:32:34] the full word of God Vindicated the
[1:32:37] perfect interpretation of the word with
[1:32:39] Divine Vindication just receive it and
[1:32:42] accept it that way amen that to quit
[1:32:45] making excuses for it or
[1:32:48] workarounds just accept it accept it the
[1:32:51] be absolutely
[1:32:53] true with all that's in your heart way
[1:32:56] down deep just accept it say Lord Jesus
[1:32:58] right now just take all that's in me
[1:33:00] that's unlike you and let me move all my
[1:33:03] pride all that's in me out all the trash
[1:33:06] all the unbelief that's in me I discard
[1:33:08] it now Lord I just kick it out and let
[1:33:11] the Sweet Holy Spirit of God like a dove
[1:33:14] move down in me I want to live eternally
[1:33:16] Lord I want you to help me at this time
[1:33:20] Grant it now
[1:33:23] man let's all stand musicians if you'll
[1:33:25] come and brother Blake if you'll please
[1:33:27] come I'm going to read that while we're
[1:33:29] standing and I want you to take it into
[1:33:31] your heart and realize it may be much
[1:33:34] simpler than we
[1:33:37] think it might just be a true
[1:33:41] repentance a genuine changing of our
[1:33:44] mind and recognizing that this message
[1:33:47] is
[1:33:48] perfect it doesn't need it manipulated
[1:33:51] doesn't need explained the way it
[1:33:52] doesn't need excuses made for it amen it
[1:33:55] needs to be
[1:34:00] accepted amen what we need is a greater
[1:34:06] surrender I remember when I first come
[1:34:09] to the
[1:34:10] message and I would listen and
[1:34:12] everything brother Brenham said I went
[1:34:14] into immediate action I mean there was
[1:34:16] always some wrestling matches times but
[1:34:18] I kicked out stuff and kicked out stuff
[1:34:20] and kicked out stuff because I had lived
[1:34:22] such a nominal life and there's so much
[1:34:24] part of my life I remember I remember
[1:34:26] the greatest victory in my life in that
[1:34:28] time was when I actually cut the cable
[1:34:30] to the cable TV I actually cut it and
[1:34:34] that was one of the greatest victories
[1:34:35] of my life to that time pretty pathetic
[1:34:38] right now
[1:34:39] but and I remember uh I remember times
[1:34:43] when people would say oh we went through
[1:34:46] our legalistic
[1:34:47] phase and I've reflected back on that
[1:34:51] and you know what I never went through a
[1:34:52] legalistic phase because I never
[1:34:55] believed those things were my salvation
[1:34:57] I believed what that man said to be true
[1:35:00] amen and of God and I wanted to line up
[1:35:03] to it amen you know what I went through
[1:35:06] I went through a simple obedience
[1:35:11] phase and it got labeled by some as a
[1:35:13] legalistic phase right but it wasn't a
[1:35:16] legalistic phase cuz I wasn't
[1:35:18] hypocritical in doing it I was honest
[1:35:20] and sincere I didn't believe it equated
[1:35:22] my salvation but I did believe it was
[1:35:24] the right thing to do because that
[1:35:26] Prophet was a prophet of God and I knew
[1:35:29] whatever he told me was true
[1:35:34] amen maybe we need to go back to a
[1:35:36] simple obedience face
[1:35:39] amen where we're so eager to get rid of
[1:35:43] stuff so eager to shed the world so
[1:35:46] eager to push it away not eager to find
[1:35:51] halfway way decent not too bad right you
[1:35:54] know what I
[1:35:56] mean oh God takeing me back to my first
[1:35:59] love amen take me back to innocency
[1:36:03] where I just saw it and I just believed
[1:36:05] it and I was willing to act on it that's
[1:36:08] where I want to stay friends amen have
[1:36:10] we gotten so wise have we become so
[1:36:13] well-versed in the message have we been
[1:36:14] so good at manipulating one one quote
[1:36:17] against another that we found ways to
[1:36:19] still have our own lustful desires still
[1:36:21] be in the
[1:36:24] message say God help us help me help me
[1:36:28] to be honest help me to be true help me
[1:36:30] to be genuine and help Lord God please
[1:36:34] give me a true repentance and wash my
[1:36:36] mind oh God give me a pure understanding
[1:36:39] and revelation of this word amen so that
[1:36:42] I can bring forth Works meat for
[1:36:45] repentance I want my Works to display my
[1:36:48] faith and I want my Works to display my
[1:36:51] love love for
[1:36:53] God not to prove anything to another
[1:36:56] human being and not to purchase for me
[1:36:58] salvation or even bonus programs from
[1:37:00] God I'm not here to get merit badges I'm
[1:37:02] not here to get stickers so I can get a
[1:37:05] bonus from God Amen that's not what it's
[1:37:07] about but with all my heart I want to
[1:37:09] show my love to him by my obedience to
[1:37:11] his word by my surrender to the voice
[1:37:14] that he chose in this age my my respect
[1:37:16] to the one that he's placed over the age
[1:37:18] I want to show my love to him that way
[1:37:20] right
[1:37:23] NO legalistic phase but maybe just a
[1:37:27] simple humble surrendered
[1:37:30] heart maybe we should stay right there
[1:37:34] maybe we should have never grown out of
[1:37:36] that to become wise in our own
[1:37:40] conceit say God help me sweetly and
[1:37:44] humbly with all that's in my heart weigh
[1:37:48] down help me just to accept it Lord
[1:37:51] and say Lord with all my heart I love
[1:37:55] you God and I'm going to read this
[1:37:58] again Jesus right now just take all
[1:38:00] that's in me that's unlike you let me
[1:38:04] move all my pride all that's in me out
[1:38:08] all the trash all the unbel belief
[1:38:10] that's in me I discard it now Lord I
[1:38:12] just kick it out and let the Sweet Holy
[1:38:15] Spirit of God like a dove moved down in
[1:38:17] me I want to live eternally Lord I want
[1:38:20] you to help me at this time Grant it man
[1:38:25] let's just bow our heads and pray this
[1:38:27] to the Lord Lord
[1:38:28] Jesus God we've read the quote but Lord
[1:38:31] to me I want it to be more than a quote
[1:38:33] Lord I want it to be the Cry of my
[1:38:36] heart God I want to surrender my own
[1:38:39] selfishness right now I ask that you
[1:38:42] take it
[1:38:43] away Lord I've made excuses where I
[1:38:45] shouldn't have made excuses and I'm
[1:38:48] sorry
[1:38:49] Lord but God you know the desire of my
[1:38:52] heart you know the faith that's in me
[1:38:55] for Lord it comes from the seed you've
[1:38:56] planted in
[1:38:58] there but God I with all my heart want
[1:39:01] to be purged of all my selfishness and
[1:39:04] pride all my self-preservation and
[1:39:07] self-d desires let it all Fade Away Lord
[1:39:11] and may I with a pure heart just accept
[1:39:13] your word and the Simplicity that it
[1:39:15] comes forth
[1:39:17] in help me God not to make it
[1:39:20] complicated
[1:39:21] but just simply Lord help me to have a
[1:39:23] heart that'll say yay in amen help me to
[1:39:28] have a desire in my heart just to
[1:39:30] surrender all and God if you should
[1:39:33] expose anything else in my life that's
[1:39:35] not like you Lord I Surrender it to you
[1:39:38] now and I ask that you wash me with the
[1:39:41] washing of the Water by Your Word cleans
[1:39:44] my mind Lord my understanding give me a
[1:39:47] greater repentance day by day that I
[1:39:49] might have a change
[1:39:51] a change of mind a change of my thinking
[1:39:54] to where I think like you
[1:39:56] think God I want to surrender I pray if
[1:39:59] there's any here Lord who's not yet
[1:40:02] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:04] and doesn't have that
[1:40:06] seal God I pray that they would do like
[1:40:08] Rahab did that they would simply
[1:40:12] obey that they would do like the
[1:40:14] children of Israel did in The Exodus at
[1:40:16] the Passover that they would
[1:40:19] obey because we know that you give the
[1:40:21] Holy Ghost to them that
[1:40:23] obey may they obey the message Lord may
[1:40:26] they obey the messenger may they
[1:40:28] surrender all absolutely all of self may
[1:40:32] they lay it down now in a complete
[1:40:36] repentance and Lord if they've not been
[1:40:38] baptized in your name may they come to
[1:40:40] be baptized in your name not titles but
[1:40:44] the Living God your name the Lord Jesus
[1:40:48] Christ if they have been bapt baptized
[1:40:51] Lord I pray that you'd bring and confirm
[1:40:53] the promise of the word for if you don't
[1:40:57] through a true repentance and a proper
[1:40:59] baptism if you don't bring the baptism
[1:41:01] of Holy Ghost then you said something
[1:41:03] wrong and we know that's impossible
[1:41:05] Lord so I pray God that you would give
[1:41:08] us a heart to repent bring us to the
[1:41:11] right baptism and help us to surrender
[1:41:14] all and then rest and trust that you
[1:41:17] will absolutely keep your word in our
[1:41:19] lives for it cannot
