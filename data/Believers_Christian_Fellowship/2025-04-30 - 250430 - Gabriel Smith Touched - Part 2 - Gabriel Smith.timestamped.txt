[8:54] Amen.
[8:56] God bless you all this
[8:59] evening. Greet you this evening in the
[9:02] name of the Lord. And
[9:05] uh I uh just uh wanted to uh send
[9:10] greetings uh from uh our pastor this
[9:13] evening. Um he called us when we was on
[9:16] the way to church and uh raspy voice and
[9:21] all and uh he uh he got three services
[9:27] left and preached six of them and uh he
[9:30] said he's praying for the assembly. Want
[9:32] to send his love and greetings to
[9:34] everyone and um I just want to lift him
[9:37] up in prayer. He said he was getting
[9:40] ready to try to get some rest, but he
[9:42] was going to be in prayer before he got
[9:45] some rest for us. So, certainly
[9:47] appreciate uh the heart of a pastor.
[9:51] Appreciate Brother Chad. And so we just
[9:53] want to remember him uh that God would
[9:56] bless uh bless his sleep, replenish his
[10:00] strength, he could uh finish the last
[10:04] stretch and come on back home, get back
[10:07] in the saddle and preach to us. So and
[10:11] so uh Sister Karen, well I tell you,
[10:15] Sister Karen, she she's a soldier.
[10:18] Hey, brother. you know, ain't a ain't
[10:21] going to keep her down. No, sir. Yeah.
[10:24] Look. And then, Brother Paul, you know
[10:25] I'm mad at you, brother. Oh, come on,
[10:28] brother. You done You done slipped in on
[10:30] me on a Wednesday, brother. You didn't
[10:32] send me no text or nothing, brother. Oh,
[10:36] brother. Praise the Lord. Hey, it's good
[10:39] to see you, brother. Good to see Good to
[10:41] see every one of you. And so, I uh I
[10:44] just got a little something on my heart.
[10:46] And uh I uh don't laugh at me now, but
[10:50] I'm going I'm going to set me a little
[10:53] timer
[10:54] here.
[10:56] And and uh so uh I I uh want to read
[11:05] um Hebrews
[11:08] again. Uh Hebrews chapter 4. Very
[11:11] familiar scripture. Thank you musicians.
[11:15] Uh Hebrews chapter 4 verse
[11:17] 15.
[11:20] Um for we have not a high priest which
[11:23] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[11:25] our
[11:26] infirmities, but was in all points
[11:28] tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
[11:33] Amen. Let us therefore come boldly unto
[11:35] the throne of grace, that we may obtain
[11:38] mercy and find grace to help in time of
[11:43] need. And I I'd like to read uh
[11:46] something brother Brandham says. Uh
[11:49] brother Brandham says in the unveiling
[11:50] of God 64. He says God in the beginning
[11:53] the eternal. He he wasn't even a god. He
[11:56] was the eternal. He he wasn't even God.
[11:59] God is an object of worship or
[12:01] something. See so he wasn't even that.
[12:03] He was Elohim the eternal. But in him
[12:06] was thoughts. He wanted to become
[12:10] material. And what did he do then? He
[12:13] spoke a word and the word was
[12:15] materialized. Now I I want you to
[12:17] capitalize on
[12:19] this. That's the whole picture. Amen.
[12:24] So So when when we uh if if we could be
[12:28] honest with ourselves when when uh when
[12:30] the preacher starts talking about three
[12:32] pools and seven seals and and we all get
[12:36] nervous. Come on, sis. Come on, brother.
[12:40] Right. And the preach and the preacher
[12:42] starts talking about seven seals and
[12:44] three pools and horizontal rainbow and
[12:47] you you all of a sudden start laying
[12:49] block and building walls, right? Cuz you
[12:52] right. Well, this is why I love the
[12:55] message cuz brother Brandham says the
[12:57] whole picture. Amen. The whole picture,
[13:01] right? From Genesis to Revelations is
[13:04] nothing wrong. It's Elohim materialized
[13:09] so he can be
[13:11] touched
[13:14] manifest what the the whole everything
[13:19] the whole as we say the whole kitten
[13:21] kaboodleoodle
[13:23] right the whole shebang
[13:26] lay it all out let's let it put it all
[13:28] on the table sir when we put it all
[13:31] everything we summarize it all seven
[13:33] seals three pools
[13:36] Daniel 7 is weeks and we got charts and
[13:39] diagrams and lay it all out.
[13:43] Seven church ages, right? Seven
[13:45] trumpets. Amen. Seven,
[13:48] right? Lay it all out.
[13:52] Elohim materialized
[13:55] so he can be touched
[13:58] field.
[14:00] And in the millennium there there is
[14:02] Elohim sitting on the throne. See,
[14:04] that's right. With all of his subjects
[14:07] round about him, that he predestinated
[14:10] before the foundation of the world.
[14:13] Hallelujah. I'd like to speak to you
[14:15] this evening by the helper of the Lord
[14:17] on touched tomb. Let's bow our heads.
[14:21] Heavenly Father, we love you this
[14:24] evening and so thankful to be called by
[14:28] your holy name. And Lord, as we approach
[14:35] Lord, this service, this portion, just
[14:37] asking that Lord, I I I can yield
[14:40] myself, Lord, that you would be able to
[14:43] speak to your children. Truly, Lord, I I
[14:46] I don't want to be seen nor heard. I
[14:49] just pray that you would have the
[14:52] preeminence, Lord, that you could have
[14:54] full sway and get all the glory and your
[14:58] children would be blessed. We just want
[15:01] to look to you tonight asking your
[15:03] blessings upon each one Lord. Asking for
[15:07] our pastor that you just give him rest,
[15:10] refreshment. Bring him home safely,
[15:13] Lord. And asking that each one would
[15:16] receive of you tonight and that we would
[15:18] all leave this building closer to you
[15:21] and farther away from the world. We
[15:23] commit all these things into your hands
[15:25] and we ask these things to be so in the
[15:28] precious name, the unfailing name, the
[15:31] only name, our Lord and Savior Jesus
[15:34] Christ. Amen. God bless you. You could
[15:37] be
[15:38] seated. Um, so I I I I love this quote.
[15:45] Um, you know, when I saw this, it just
[15:48] it is so beautiful to me. Um because a
[15:51] lot of times we as message believers
[15:55] uh we all know that there's depth to
[15:57] God's word and there's so many it's so
[16:00] dynamic in so many ways. But I but I
[16:04] love it uh when the prophet of God would
[16:06] make it uh so simple for us. That's what
[16:09] a that's what a prophet of God does.
[16:11] That's what ministry is supposed to do.
[16:13] And is that right? when when when Jesus
[16:16] broke the basket, broke the bread and
[16:18] and put it in the basket, the disciples,
[16:21] they they they the disciples are
[16:23] supposed to bring it down to the people
[16:24] so they can get them a piece, right? And
[16:27] so that's that's what we as ministry uh
[16:31] are supposed to do is and if it's if we
[16:33] got to make it complicated uh to to look
[16:36] revelated, then something's wrong,
[16:38] right? Because the ministry is supposed
[16:40] to make it plain. Uh, and so I to me
[16:44] it's it's things like that that just I
[16:48] hope everyone that deals with that fear
[16:51] because I'm sure I I'm not the only one
[16:53] that was afraid the first time somebody
[16:55] talk started talking about the seventh
[16:57] seal, right? in the three pools. And And
[17:01] so I I'm I'm uh honest enough to to be
[17:05] to tell you and and so um when I see
[17:09] things like that, it it it puts me at
[17:11] rest that that uh the whole plan, the
[17:15] whole picture from Genesis to
[17:18] Revelations, God
[17:20] Elohim, he just wanted to
[17:27] touch. He just wanted to feel you. You
[17:32] and and it's it's amazing when you start
[17:34] thinking about it, you know, that that
[17:37] you know, God is a spirit and and no man
[17:39] has seen God at any times. Uh only the
[17:42] the begotten uh uh son who's in the
[17:45] bosom of the father hath declared him.
[17:47] And so when when we think of God that
[17:50] that word that logos was made flesh and
[17:53] dwelt among us and and when we you would
[17:56] think that he when he created the three
[17:58] dimensions that we live in with time,
[18:00] space and matter that he would create
[18:02] the vast universe and and he would
[18:05] create it just so that he could be
[18:08] touched.
[18:10] You know because with God is a spirit
[18:13] but in you in him you was there. Amen.
[18:16] But even though you was in him, he was
[18:18] still alone. Right? That that's why when
[18:21] he when he would look at at Adam, Adam,
[18:24] he would have, you know, when he would
[18:26] look at Adam and he said, "It's not good
[18:28] that man be alone." God could look at
[18:31] Adam
[18:32] and this is maybe shocking, but God
[18:35] wasn't enough. That's right. Amen. Amen.
[18:40] Yes, sir. Amen. And and God didn't come
[18:44] down in the evening and and rake Adam
[18:47] over the coals and say, "Where ain't
[18:49] enough?"
[18:51] Right? He He didn't say that because
[18:55] when when God would look at Adam, he
[18:58] would see himself,
[19:00] right? And and so remember, he's a high
[19:03] priest that can be touched by the
[19:06] feeling of your infirmities. So he
[19:09] understands the lonely nights. He
[19:12] understands the lonely moments when when
[19:14] when nobody understands. Amen. Right.
[19:18] When when when sometimes when we're
[19:20] we're in a church full of people and we
[19:22] feel all alone.
[19:25] Anybody ever been there?
[19:28] God
[19:29] understands. God knows what it feels
[19:31] like to be alone. And and the thing of
[19:33] it is you is young and
[19:36] old in those times of loneliness, don't
[19:40] let
[19:40] desperation buckle you. Amen.
[19:45] And and when we go through those lonely
[19:47] times, you know, disappointments be
[19:50] disappointments come in life. But
[19:53] remember, if if you would think about
[19:55] it, when when when you have
[19:57] disappointments that come in life, a lot
[19:59] of times it's because you have
[20:01] unrealistic expectations.
[20:03] Amen.
[20:06] And when when the expectation is set in
[20:09] such a way, we have to give God the
[20:12] liberty and freedom to do what he wants
[20:13] to do in our lives. Amen. And when you
[20:16] have that expectation set a certain way
[20:18] and then it doesn't then God doesn't
[20:20] meet your expectation. Hello somebody.
[20:24] So so we have to be mindful and give God
[20:28] uh uh uh space to do what he wants to
[20:30] do. Amen. Amen. You know, the thing of
[20:32] it is is, you know,
[20:35] um you know, when I when I first came
[20:38] into this thing, you know, the Lord, you
[20:40] know, um
[20:43] I waited, you know, let me just let me
[20:47] just say, you know, you young people, I
[20:49] know sometimes you get and anticipation
[20:53] and expectation and you want that ring,
[20:56] right?
[21:01] Can I get a little estrogen?
[21:06] Amen. Brother Gab, right? But but but
[21:10] you know under that listen you know when
[21:14] when when the Lord called called me you
[21:17] know I I come up the streets and so I I
[21:21] waited because I I thought Lord I I
[21:24] don't I certainly don't want to get
[21:26] involved with somebody and then me
[21:28] backslide and not only ruin my life but
[21:30] ruin somebody else's. Yeah, you know and
[21:33] and I think every one of us ought to
[21:35] have that same type of courtesy one to
[21:38] another. Amen. Right. Brother Brandham
[21:41] says if you have the right kind of love
[21:43] and if you if you really love somebody
[21:47] and that person would be happier with
[21:49] somebody else, you would want that
[21:52] person to go with that person and be get
[21:54] married to them and be happier. If is
[21:57] that right? Brother Brham said that's
[21:59] the right kind of love we're supposed to
[22:01] have. And if we don't have that right
[22:03] kind of love, then we have selfish love
[22:05] and we have selfish motives. And and
[22:08] there's still a level of immaturity in
[22:10] our lives that needs to be dealt with.
[22:13] Yes, sir. Because we live in a selfish
[22:16] age. We we live in a self centered where
[22:19] where it's all about me, myself, and I.
[22:23] Right. And and and too many times we
[22:26] have to be on we don't uh we aren't
[22:29] honest with ourselves. And if we aren't
[22:32] honest with ourselves, not only could we
[22:34] cause damage in our lives, but we can
[22:36] cause damage in other people's lives.
[22:42] So, brother Brad, brother Bradam tells
[22:45] us this. He says, he says, see, God came
[22:48] down and the character of God was
[22:50] Christ. He was a reflection. He was God
[22:53] made visible. God made biddenable. In
[22:56] the beginning was God. He wasn't even
[22:58] God. God is an object of worship. One
[23:00] thing he was eternal and in him was
[23:02] attributes sir and those attributes were
[23:05] thoughts and those thoughts were
[23:07] expressed to words and word was made
[23:09] manifest. What is it? It's all God
[23:13] becoming tangible. Amen. And you are
[23:17] part of God. Yes sir. And Jesus come to
[23:21] redeem those that were put on the lamb's
[23:23] book of life before the foundation of
[23:26] the world. It was God in thoughts. And
[23:29] that's what he come to redeem. And then
[23:32] as soon as it strikes to them, they see
[23:35] it. Amen.
[23:41] Look, as soon as it strikes them, they
[23:44] see it because the life is in there.
[23:47] Praise God. But if the life isn't there,
[23:52] then what can they do? See, they don't
[23:54] see it. They'll never see it. Amen.
[23:57] That's right. How is it that we see what
[23:59] we see? And we we could we we could
[24:02] somebody could be standing right beside
[24:04] us and we say, "Don't Wasn't you in the
[24:06] same service?
[24:09] What do you mean? Don't you didn't you
[24:12] didn't you see that? Didn't you hear
[24:15] that?" And and and
[24:18] they have criticism
[24:21] and critique, but you're listening for a
[24:24] different sound.
[24:27] See, how is that? Be because you're
[24:31] looking for the right thing. Listen,
[24:33] there is much to criticize because
[24:36] remember, we're dealing with fallen
[24:38] humanity,
[24:40] frailty of this flesh, but you have to
[24:43] be listening for a certain sound. That's
[24:46] right. Right. He says, he says the whole
[24:49] thing, they'll never see it. And the
[24:51] whole thing as Jesus said at the day,
[24:53] you'll know that I'm in the father and
[24:55] the father and me. I and you and you and
[24:57] me. The whole thing is God becoming
[25:01] material.
[25:03] Like a husband and a wife becoming one
[25:06] together. God and his church becoming
[25:10] one. Yes sir. So
[25:14] that's the reason why this world does
[25:16] not satisfy.
[25:19] You know many people can be satisfied
[25:21] with this world but there was always
[25:24] something in you it never did quench
[25:28] but when we come to the fountain
[25:32] right it was something different
[25:35] when I when I listen to this message to
[25:39] me it's more than life. That's right.
[25:42] Amen. And I I
[25:45] I'm you know
[25:48] I I'm I'm so
[25:50] grateful that God gave us ears to hear
[25:56] and a heart to receive
[25:58] because we live in an hour where where
[26:02] it's
[26:03] selfish self
[26:06] centered and and brother Brandham tells
[26:08] us that we have to be careful
[26:13] because of the age that we live in. He
[26:16] says
[26:17] now before before I click on
[26:21] this when I when I and no doubt you
[26:24] message
[26:25] theologians because I said a few key
[26:28] words. No, some of you know exactly
[26:31] where I'm going.
[26:35] Right? But here here's here's here's
[26:38] what I want you to be mindful of.
[26:41] Don't let this quote become common to
[26:43] you.
[26:47] And that's what we need to guard against
[26:51] because we can say and we've all been
[26:54] there already know where he's going,
[26:56] right? And then we start out preaching
[26:58] the preacher.
[27:00] Amen. And and and and we're here instead
[27:04] of here, right? cuz it it's not about
[27:08] wowing you with finding a new quote that
[27:10] nobody's ever seen.
[27:14] Don't get me wrong, I love doing that.
[27:19] Uh I know I'm humble and proud of it. I
[27:22] know.
[27:27] But so brother Bram says, "I want to
[27:30] give a warning right here.
[27:33] So if Moses was to come this evening and
[27:38] tell you, I want to give you a warning.
[27:39] What would you do?
[27:46] But we had a we had a prophet in our age
[27:50] that was sent to us that gives us a
[27:52] warning. And so if he gives us a
[27:55] warning, no matter how many times we've
[27:57] heard that warning, it ought to never
[27:59] become common to us. That's right. Amen.
[28:02] Amen. Be because here's the thing.
[28:05] Remember when what we're saying, we're
[28:08] not talking we're not talking about
[28:11] alcohol
[28:12] and we're not talking about drugs. We're
[28:15] not talk This is somebody that can be
[28:18] sitting that you'll
[28:20] never realize that they're under the
[28:22] effects of this last day spirit. That's
[28:25] right. Amen. Right. And so this is a
[28:28] warning that all of us need to take heed
[28:31] to. He says it concerning the last days
[28:33] that because of abounding iniquity, the
[28:36] love of many will wax cold and the lady
[28:37] who see the last self
[28:41] love and the love material things will
[28:44] take the place of the true good love of
[28:46] God. We need to guard against the power
[28:48] of sin in the last days. What is sin?
[28:51] Unbelief. Yes. Preach, brother. Sin is
[28:57] unbelief
[28:59] in God's word. And so
[29:02] remember, if if if all Satan wants you
[29:06] to do is is say, "Yes, the the the
[29:10] message is right." Right. Like like
[29:12] brother Bram talked about that man that
[29:14] that that that pastor, that minister
[29:16] could take that wheelbarrow and he could
[29:18] drive across the the road or that little
[29:20] thing and and that man said, "Yeah,
[29:22] pastor, I know you can do it." And I
[29:24] said, "I can put a log in." "Yeah,
[29:25] pastor, I know you can do it." And he
[29:27] said, "I can put you in it." And he
[29:28] goes, "Well, hey, hold on now."
[29:31] Right? He was all for it till he had to
[29:34] play a part in it. And then all of a
[29:36] sudden it was like, and that's exactly
[29:38] what the enemy wants all of us. We He's
[29:41] okay with you putting it on everybody
[29:42] else. But the moment you say that, I
[29:45] don't know about that. That is sin.
[29:49] That is unbelief. We are supposed to
[29:52] believe the full counsel of God. Every
[29:55] word of God, all the blessings of God is
[29:58] for us. And it has to be yay and amen. I
[30:04] And listen, I don't care how long you
[30:06] struggled with something, 20, 30, 40, 50
[30:09] years. Don't ever give up. And don't
[30:13] ever lose your testimony of I am an
[30:17] overcomer.
[30:18] Amen. Don't do it. Don't give Satan the
[30:22] satisfaction. Yeah. Yeah. He says he
[30:25] says he says so many are getting so hard
[30:29] because they haven't realized the effect
[30:32] of the last day spirit. It it is the
[30:36] time to draw nigh to God and let them
[30:38] fill our lives with his love or we will
[30:41] feel the coldness of the last day church
[30:43] and reject the truth of God which alone
[30:46] is able to help us. Because of the
[30:50] coldness, people are becoming hardened.
[30:54] Amen. Right.
[30:57] Remember, we're talking about touch.
[31:02] Whose
[31:05] hands is he going to use?
[31:09] Amen. Thank you.
[31:11] Whose whose mouth is he going to use?
[31:16] Now, here's the thing. Watch. You can
[31:18] say, "Well, Brother Gabe, I'm not into
[31:20] all that touchy Philly stuff." Okay,
[31:22] listen. Well, I'm I'm not trying to push
[31:24] no weird doctrine, right? But what I am
[31:27] trying to say is if if you are one of
[31:30] those ones that that that you know want
[31:32] to do the quick half a second hug and
[31:35] all right, I did my Christianly duty.
[31:38] Right.
[31:41] Then
[31:43] listen, sometimes you got to look on the
[31:45] inside and go, God, why am I that way?
[31:49] You see what I'm saying? And that's
[31:51] that's what I'm trying to get you to see
[31:53] because it, you know, we can have all
[31:56] the seals laid out and all the church
[31:58] ages and be able to on a scroll and roll
[32:01] it down the aisle, right? But what what
[32:04] good does that do if if if you can't
[32:06] show me? Look, don't tell me you love
[32:09] me. Show me you love me. Like I want
[32:12] like when you hug me, I want to feel it.
[32:16] Hello. Right. When when when I when I
[32:19] sit across you and you sit across me, I
[32:21] want to feel that Holy Spirit. I I want
[32:25] I want I want to feel right. Hello
[32:28] somebody. But the problem of it is is we
[32:30] are afraid to open ourselves up, right?
[32:34] Because of why? Well, brother Gabe, some
[32:37] you know uh this preacher hurt me or
[32:39] this person did and these people.
[32:41] Listen, okay, we have all been hurt. We
[32:44] have all been crushed. We have all had
[32:47] problems. We've all been Hello now. But
[32:50] but you can you can let that and it can
[32:52] harden you and you be you can become
[32:55] bitter.
[32:57] Right. And listen, oh man, you you can
[33:00] tow the line and no television and no,
[33:03] you know, flee froing garment hair down
[33:06] to your ankles and you brother's long
[33:08] sleeve, you won't catch him in a short
[33:10] sleeve shirt and I
[33:13] mean, okay, but if you still got that
[33:16] bitterness on the inside, what good does
[33:20] them long sleeves do? You
[33:23] understand what I'm saying, right? You
[33:25] got to where what hands is God going to
[33:28] use?
[33:31] There's a dying world out there. Yes,
[33:34] sir. Amen. and he wants to use you
[33:42] but that means we have to open up
[33:44] ourselves
[33:46] and become vulnerable
[33:49] and and it's uh better game
[33:56] man
[33:58] stop please
[34:01] no you're not you're a scared little boy
[34:11] It's true
[34:13] cuz there's a little boy inside of you
[34:16] that got
[34:17] hurt and you're yet you you have that
[34:20] attitude as a cover up. But really, if
[34:23] you would do some heart surgery on
[34:25] yourself, you would see there's
[34:26] something deep down on the inside of you
[34:28] that's
[34:29] hurting. And that's your defense
[34:31] mechanism.
[34:33] cuz you got hurt once but you'll never
[34:34] get hurt again. And the moment we start
[34:37] doing that in life, we start dying. But
[34:40] we don't die the right kind of death.
[34:44] Do you see what I'm saying? Listen, I I
[34:47] have I have learned in life that when
[34:51] God crushes you, you can take it one of
[34:53] either two ways. You can let it destroy
[34:56] you or you can let it mold you. Because
[34:59] when God crushes you and allows that
[35:01] crushing to happen, it's for a purpose.
[35:04] When when when those things happen, you
[35:06] say, "Brother Gabe, I don't know about
[35:08] that." Well, let let me listen. I tell
[35:09] you what, why don't you argue with the
[35:11] prophet here? Hold on. Argue with the
[35:13] prophet right here. Watch
[35:15] this.
[35:17] Uh let me see.
[35:21] He
[35:23] says a few years later when the trials
[35:26] come and the church got all shook up as
[35:29] as is so easy for the congregation of
[35:32] people to do when something just don't
[35:34] seem that to happen the way that's
[35:36] supposed to be. God makes it that way.
[35:39] Yes, sir. God brings tensions into the
[35:43] church. Hallelujah. Woo. Oh well. Yeah.
[35:48] Amen. That's the truth. He didn't say
[35:50] the devil. He said, "Yeah,
[35:55] said
[35:56] God." He says, "For every son that
[35:59] cometh to God must be tried and proven
[36:03] and tested." Look, you mean to tell me
[36:07] that a brother will do something to to
[36:10] to rub me the wrong way? Yes, sir. Yes.
[36:13] You know why? Because God will use that
[36:16] to mold you and it'll use that to mold
[36:18] him. cuz he'll have to recognize there's
[36:22] a character flaw in him and he'll
[36:25] struggle it out and reason it out. And
[36:27] that preacher will preach Wednesday and
[36:30] then pastor come right back around.
[36:33] Amen. Or brother Emanuel come right back
[36:35] around Sunday and then brother Chad
[36:38] Rasmir that he was today will come out
[36:41] sound like brother Gabe off the
[36:44] rip, right? and he'll come right back
[36:48] around and he'll hit you with a one-two
[36:50] punch and you'll go, "Okay, Lord." Oh,
[36:53] man.
[36:56] Yeah. Hallelujah. See, cuz God uses us.
[37:00] Iron sharpens iron. And it's not to hurt
[37:03] you. It's to mold you.
[37:08] See, the crushing has to come because
[37:11] there's character flaws in every Yes.
[37:14] You, too. Yes. Every one of you,
[37:19] all of us are flawed in some sh because
[37:23] you have not yet went to the other side.
[37:26] That's right. Yes, sir. So, there is a
[37:30] portion of you that still needs to be
[37:32] molded
[37:34] unless you say you don't need to be on
[37:35] the potter's wheel anymore,
[37:38] but I need it.
[37:40] Right? Watch what he says. He says, he
[37:43] says,
[37:46] uh, God brings tension into the church.
[37:50] He says, he lets
[37:53] diseases come on you, to test you,
[37:57] and to prove you, to show the world that
[38:02] you're truly the
[38:06] Amen. Amen. Whoa. Amen. And you're over
[38:10] there with that disease thinking you
[38:12] ain't seed of Abraham.
[38:16] Amen.
[38:18] Thank you, brother. I'm going have to go
[38:19] down there and squeeze somebody. Brother
[38:20] Joe's like, "Don't squeeze me out
[38:25] of you thank Paul after service,
[38:28] brother."
[38:34] He says he permits it by his own will.
[38:39] He
[38:40] permits disasters. That's right. He
[38:44] permits the
[38:46] friends to turn against you. Yes, sir.
[38:50] He permits all these things and turns
[38:53] the devil loose to tempt you. And he'll
[38:56] do all that but take your life. He could
[38:59] throw you in a bed of affliction. He
[39:01] could turn your neighbors against you.
[39:03] He could
[39:07] what?
[39:10] He could
[39:12] turn the
[39:14] church against you.
[39:19] He can do most
[39:22] anything. And it's God's will for him to
[39:27] do it. Yes, sir.
[39:29] And only a prophet like if you imagine
[39:32] if brother Gabe preached this when you
[39:34] didn't read this you'd be like brother
[39:36] Chad
[39:42] hello
[39:44] but Malachi 4 Amen
[39:48] says we are
[39:51] taught so this ain't a flighty thing we
[39:55] are taught that it is more precious than
[39:58] gold.
[40:00] Amen. Yes, sir. To us. Praise God. See,
[40:04] cuz it's it's here. You know, you can
[40:08] either do one of two things. When the
[40:10] trials come, when the trials
[40:15] come, we we we know the scripture, ye
[40:17] are the salt of the earth, right?
[40:21] But what struck me
[40:23] is go up two verses.
[40:28] And Jesus says, "Blessed are ye when men
[40:32] shall revile you and persecute you and
[40:34] say all manner of evil against you
[40:36] falsely."
[40:40] But I'm standing with the word. Amen.
[40:43] And everything's coming against me. Yes,
[40:46] sir.
[40:49] And what do we want to do?
[40:54] We want to pull
[40:55] back and
[40:58] say, "You hurt me once, you won't hurt
[41:01] me again."
[41:03] And the moment we do
[41:05] that, we
[41:07] start dying the wrong way.
[41:11] Cuz we're not living life. Eternal life
[41:14] is living for others.
[41:19] And we want to live for we only we want
[41:20] to live for others. But yeah, but just
[41:22] the people you like in the
[41:25] church, just my favorite
[41:28] co-workers, the ones I hand selected for
[41:31] my
[41:33] group, the the ones that we we go to
[41:37] lunch together and we go to break
[41:38] together
[41:40] and and and we we insulate ourselves
[41:44] with our favorite
[41:46] people. Y
[41:49] but that's not eternal life cuz you're
[41:51] living for yourself.
[41:53] I'm living for myself if I just insulate
[41:56] myself with my favorite
[41:59] people, right?
[42:02] Then then how am I having eternal life?
[42:05] I'm try it's it's really it's all about
[42:08] me. It's all about me having a good
[42:11] time. And so I want to pick the funniest
[42:13] people and I want the the coolest. I
[42:16] want to be a cool
[42:17] kid. I want to be a cool kid in the
[42:20] message. Right. So we want all the cool
[42:23] people to
[42:25] Come on. Somebody look. Huh? Right. But
[42:29] but that is living a selfish life.
[42:34] Whose hands is he going to use?
[42:38] Whose heart is he going to use? Whose
[42:43] voice is he going to
[42:46] use? He He says, "Rejoice and be
[42:49] exceeding glad for great is your
[42:53] reward?" You mean I don't get nothing?
[42:55] Wait, what?
[43:02] Yeah, you got to wait for it.
[43:06] Yeah. See, because we want the instant
[43:09] gratification.
[43:11] I did something for you. You do
[43:12] something for me. Right. But you scratch
[43:16] my I'll scratch yours. But brother Bram
[43:18] said, "No, no, no. Grace is I'll scratch
[43:21] your back even if you don't scratch
[43:23] mine." Cuz yours needs scratching.
[43:27] Right. Hello, sisters. You can use that
[43:30] on the husbands tonight.
[43:37] He says, "For so persecuted they the
[43:40] prophets which were before you." This is
[43:44] this is not put in here for happen
[43:46] stance.
[43:48] Ye are the salt of the earth. Amen. And
[43:53] we ought to know salt does no good
[43:56] sitting in a jar. It has to make
[43:59] contact. Amen. And so God would put
[44:04] this, the Lord would say this in such a
[44:06] way that when everything's coming
[44:08] against you, that's the time you're
[44:11] supposed to be mindful to be salt. So
[44:15] when you want to pull back because this
[44:17] is the way we are as Smiths.
[44:20] Amen.
[44:22] Thank you, sir. That's right. Yeah.
[44:24] Sister Sis Virginia. Yeah. Right. Right.
[44:29] You listen. we we love. Well, that's
[44:31] just the way we smiss our right. We're
[44:35] you know, and the moment you do that,
[44:38] you you're you're putting the the
[44:40] the family tree,
[44:44] the family tree, you're putting your
[44:47] earthly nature above your heavenly
[44:49] knowing.
[44:51] Amen. The moment, you know, we've all
[44:54] heard people, well, that's just the way
[44:56] we are.
[44:59] And and when when when they do that,
[45:02] they are actually edifying that family
[45:05] natural lineage above the lineage of
[45:06] God.
[45:08] We are not to rejoice in our in our last
[45:11] name. We are to rejoice in the name of
[45:13] Jesus Christ. Be partakers of the divine
[45:17] nature.
[45:19] Not our earthly nature. That's what
[45:21] we're trying to kill. That's what we're
[45:24] trying to destroy.
[45:27] And if God is telling us that we are to
[45:30] be salt, that means we got a contact in
[45:35] the midst of persecution, in the midst
[45:38] of the trial, when we don't want to
[45:43] do it anyways,
[45:48] if we just come to church because we
[45:50] want to, none of us would be here,
[45:53] Right.
[45:55] Right. Let's be honest. We go through
[45:58] hard times. We go through struggles. But
[46:00] but we have but but in all of
[46:03] that, look, there there is a purpose.
[46:06] Too many times, you know, I love I love
[46:09] how Jesus does it in in Matthew chapter
[46:13] 19. when they brought uh children to
[46:17] Jesus and they they that he would put
[46:19] his hands on him, they just wanted Jesus
[46:23] to touch him. The disciples rebuked him.
[46:28] And if you go up a few verses, they were
[46:31] having a ministers meeting on marriage
[46:33] and divorce. Praise the Lord.
[46:39] Amen. That's right. They they had asked
[46:42] the question about divorce. You know, no
[46:45] doubt
[46:46] Peter, well, we're having, you know,
[46:48] this ain't for ley. This is ministers
[46:53] only. We're talking on the deep things
[46:55] of
[47:00] God. And the discip Ain't you ain't you
[47:03] glad they put this in there? Hey, I done
[47:06] been there before. It's revelated.
[47:10] I even got to stand like
[47:12] this. This my revelation stance.
[47:19] We are a mess, ain't we? Huh?
[47:24] I ain't trying to be funny, but I'm just
[47:26] saying. Maybe I am a little bit, but I
[47:28] this way I am. I just I try to like
[47:32] loosen you up. You tighten up on me.
[47:37] He says, "The disciples rebuked them."
[47:41] And
[47:42] Jesus, what's he
[47:47] do? He he he pulls this little one in
[47:51] his arms. Because remember,
[47:55] Elohim from Genesis to Revelation,
[47:59] the whole plan,
[48:01] Elohim,
[48:03] wanted to touch and to feel.
[48:08] And when these ministers are wanting to
[48:11] get into marriage and divorce and
[48:13] straighten the church out
[48:18] Jesus takes this little child
[48:21] and he puts him in his
[48:22] arms, right? No doubt puts him up beside
[48:26] him and he says, "Suffer little children
[48:29] and forbid them not to come unto me, for
[48:33] such is the kingdom of heaven."
[48:36] and he laid hands on
[48:38] them and departed thence. See the Lord
[48:43] Jesus, See, there's something about the
[48:46] Lord's touch.
[48:48] And if you've ever been touched by him,
[48:51] you'll never be the same. Amen. It's
[48:55] more than a song, friends. It's my life.
[48:58] Yeah. See, cuz when the Lord touches
[49:02] you, you know, sometimes he may squeeze
[49:05] your heart and that's when the tears
[49:08] start coming out.
[49:10] Don't Don't try to hold them back. You
[49:13] young brothers, listen, you got to learn
[49:15] to cry. You said, "Brother Gabe, listen.
[49:19] Don't be that tough guy. Don't be that.
[49:22] Stop. Stop. Listen. I'll tell you. Look,
[49:26] you sisters, look, you watch them boys.
[49:30] You listen. When you wa Listen, I'm
[49:31] telling you, need to watch them. Watch
[49:33] them in the house of God. I I Let me
[49:36] give you a little secret. Look, you want
[49:38] to watch them before they get interested
[49:41] in you. Cuz when they get interested in
[49:43] you, all of a sudden they going to turn
[49:45] spiritual on you.
[49:51] Yeah. Pay attention. Cuz if they're
[49:54] stiff and starchy, oh, don't expect them
[49:56] to love on you, sis.
[50:01] Come on, somebody. Listen, look, look.
[50:05] You know, I I know I know why you talk
[50:07] about five love languages and everybody
[50:08] thinks, "Oh, that's psychology." Listen,
[50:11] you got a brain.
[50:13] Stop being so spiritual. You got a
[50:16] brain. And and there's a way in which
[50:19] you're built. And there's a way in which
[50:21] your opposite is built. And you have to
[50:24] learn that person. Amen. And you have to
[50:28] learn to touch them in the way that they
[50:31] need to be touched. That's true.
[50:35] And and here's the thing. Look, brother,
[50:36] you say, "But brother Gabe, I'm not
[50:38] built that way." But if you believe in
[50:41] the divine ordination of God, God placed
[50:44] you with that sister. Yeah. Amen.
[50:47] because he knew that there was that
[50:49] frailty or that flaw in you and he put
[50:52] her right beside you so that you would
[50:55] have to surrender and work on that
[50:57] thing. Amen. Come on, brothers. Look,
[51:00] you say you you can go all the way
[51:02] around the mountain and you can provide
[51:04] and work and slave and 40 80 hours a
[51:07] week and blood, sweat, and tear and you
[51:09] got calluses to prove it.
[51:13] But that's not what she needs.
[51:20] She needs something different.
[51:23] And you have to know, you have to care
[51:26] enough about that person to sacrifice.
[51:30] You say, "Oh, I die for my family."
[51:32] Okay, we'll start dying now.
[51:35] We can we can pump our chest and Yeah.
[51:38] Okay. Die now. Die out to that and give
[51:42] her what she needs. Amen.
[51:44] See, we want to die. We want to, you
[51:46] know, stand before the the Pope and the
[51:48] the Catholic Church and give our life.
[51:52] That's not the martyr. Stop. Calm down,
[51:54] martyr. Message martyr.
[51:58] We're not going to the tribulation just
[52:00] yet.
[52:02] Don't stop. I know the pope passed away,
[52:05] but don't don't start getting your
[52:07] rations out.
[52:12] Come on, friends. We are not prepared
[52:14] for tribulation. Amen. Don't get don't
[52:17] let that fear come on you.
[52:20] True. Amen. What we need to die out to
[52:23] is right now so that we can touch our
[52:26] family. I'm not worried about that world
[52:29] out there. You know how you know who I'm
[52:31] worried about? I'm worried about the
[52:33] road number five right there. And then
[52:35] it spreads out to you all. That's my
[52:38] family and that's who I'm worried about.
[52:40] I'm worried about making sure every one
[52:41] of you your needs are supplied. Right?
[52:45] That's what we ought to do. That's all
[52:47] we ought to be. Can we say amen to that?
[52:49] Are we in agreement with that? But we
[52:51] got to get past this
[52:53] selfish, selfentered life.
[52:58] That we live in.
[53:03] Brother Brandham says this. He says,
[53:05] "What mother here doesn't know what
[53:07] laying on of hands means? When a little
[53:10] baby fret, crying everything, let that
[53:13] mother hand just touch that baby." That
[53:16] settles it. The the little fellow starts
[53:20] crying, huddle up to his mother. See it?
[53:23] It's lay in your hands. It's mother.
[53:26] It's a contact. Watch this. Here's what
[53:29] I want you to see. He says, "How many of
[53:31] you are here ever had a horse that was
[53:33] real nervous and upset? Just let a
[53:37] man, Brother Bram throws this in here.
[53:40] Just let a man who likes
[53:44] horses." There's the key to the whole
[53:46] quote right there. That's the key to the
[53:49] whole quote right there.
[53:53] Let a man who likes
[53:56] horses, just pat his leg, talk to him
[54:00] just a minute, pat him, lay his hand on
[54:02] him. First thing you know, the horse has
[54:06] quiet down. See? And so it is with
[54:09] laying hands on the sick. If we're
[54:12] anointed to do so from God, our hands
[54:15] represents God's hands. That's the only
[54:18] hands he has is ours.
[54:21] So what is he saying? If we are to love
[54:25] or to touch one, there has to be a
[54:28] feeling to it.
[54:31] Yes, sir. Like like if if you are doing
[54:33] it out of duty, you're missing the whole
[54:35] point.
[54:37] Amen.
[54:40] If it's just because I have to do
[54:43] this, you need to tear that down because
[54:47] that's artificial put on.
[54:49] It has to come from the heart.
[54:52] And when it comes from the heart,
[54:54] there's a feeling behind it. And that
[54:58] feeling cannot be faked.
[55:01] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[55:04] See, but in order to do that, we have to
[55:06] tear down all of our
[55:11] baggage and we have to become
[55:13] vulnerable.
[55:15] And that's the hardest thing to do.
[55:19] because we don't want to get
[55:21] hurt because we've been hurt too many
[55:24] times. But that's part of
[55:29] living. And the moment you accept that,
[55:32] the easier life
[55:34] becomes. You know, I I learned as a
[55:37] little boy, I got picked on something
[55:39] fierce, but I I learned to laugh at
[55:44] myself. And it was a coping mechanism
[55:47] that I that that's that's I think that's
[55:49] that's part of why I clown so much. It's
[55:51] just part of me. But when I get nervous
[55:54] and I sometimes I laugh even at the
[55:56] wrong times,
[56:00] right? But God understands our frailty.
[56:03] He knows why we are that we the way that
[56:06] we are. But the thing of it is if if if
[56:10] I didn't laugh, I could have become
[56:12] bitter and hateful and mean. But I chose
[56:15] a better way. And and everything in
[56:19] life, you have to make a decision on
[56:21] what you're going to do. Life is going
[56:24] to throw you curveballs that you never
[56:26] thought was going to come. But if you
[56:28] ain't careful, you be you can become
[56:30] hardened and bitter by it. Amen. Amen.
[56:34] Listen, what did Brother Brandham say?
[56:36] that one of the the worst thing that
[56:38] that you could ever see is is Satan
[56:40] crown a a a a crab old man grumpy and
[56:48] right because life was hard and instead
[56:50] of instead of instead of that that
[56:53] oldtimer that took it gracefully and
[56:56] rolled with the punches and stayed
[56:58] tender and pliable and moldable, they
[57:01] become bittered and harded and
[57:03] disgruntled
[57:05] and and there may not be and and and and
[57:08] then we could then then when brother
[57:09] Brandham talks about the you know the
[57:11] the the
[57:13] the you know doineering woman or
[57:16] whatever uh you know
[57:25] and and you're using the message the
[57:27] wrong way. Yeah. This message is love,
[57:30] friends. Amen. When that prophet when he
[57:33] showed us the the conspiracies of the
[57:35] world, it wasn't so we could stockpile
[57:37] goods
[57:41] it it was so that we could have an
[57:43] understanding
[57:45] that there is no conspiracy for us.
[57:47] Amen. Cuz we have the truth and God's
[57:50] going to take us out before everything
[57:52] falls apart.
[57:54] And and it ought to give us courage and
[57:56] confidence. But but if we ain't careful,
[57:59] we can let this world throw us
[58:01] curveballs and we become hate hateful
[58:03] and bitter and and and and watch watch
[58:06] what brother says. He says
[58:14] uh let me read the scripture in
[58:17] Galatians 6 1 and2. says, "Brethren, if
[58:20] a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which
[58:23] are spiritual, restore such a one in the
[58:26] spirit of meekness, considering thyself,
[58:30] lest thou also be tempted, bear ye one
[58:34] another's burdens, and so
[58:37] fulfill." Now, you know, this is this is
[58:40] New Testament, right? Amen.
[58:43] But God would give us a law.
[58:48] That means you have to do this.
[58:53] Amen. That means there's no wiggle room.
[59:00] Guilty of the least. Guilty of the
[59:02] whole. Well, it's a grace covenant,
[59:04] Brother Gabe. Well, there's a scripture
[59:06] right here. This is his law. Yeah. And
[59:09] he says, "This is my law that you are to
[59:13] bear one another's burdens." Amen.
[59:18] Amen.
[59:21] Eternal life is living for others. It's
[59:26] living not
[59:28] for your friends, but it's living for
[59:32] our
[59:33] enemies. The ones that would kill you if
[59:37] you if you have somebody like that.
[59:40] That's the one we're to live for. That's
[59:44] the one we're trying to
[59:47] win. Amen. But too many times we we find
[59:50] enemies in the
[59:52] congregation and it ought not to be.
[59:55] Amen.
[59:57] Brother Brandham tells us he says he
[1:00:00] says he says
[1:00:05] uh a person who lives their life for
[1:00:07] their self lives a selfish life. We must
[1:00:13] live for others. bear ye one another's
[1:00:16] burdens and so fulfill the law of
[1:00:17] Christ. And we got to have a feeling.
[1:00:21] See, here's
[1:00:23] here's, you know, to
[1:00:25] me, this is something that you cannot
[1:00:28] you cannot fake it. Amen.
[1:00:33] Amen.
[1:00:35] This is the unfailing of realities of
[1:00:37] God that I want.
[1:00:42] He says, "You got to have a feeling one
[1:00:46] for another. And therefore, when you do
[1:00:49] all you know how to do, then when you do
[1:00:53] lay down at night, well, you have the
[1:00:56] consolation
[1:00:58] knowing you
[1:01:00] tried your best." Amen.
[1:01:06] Now, I want to ask
[1:01:08] you, every one of us, if we would be
[1:01:11] honest with ourselves, how many times do
[1:01:14] we lay our head on that pillow and have
[1:01:17] a
[1:01:18] consolation, I'd done my best to have a
[1:01:21] feeling for lost humanity today.
[1:01:26] I dare say no. This is Lady Oia. And
[1:01:30] we're worried about our bills. We're
[1:01:33] worried about what we got to do on our
[1:01:34] to-do list tomorrow. We're worried about
[1:01:37] the job that needs to get done. And
[1:01:43] see, we we can say eternal life's living
[1:01:46] for others, but when we lay our head on
[1:01:49] the pillow Well, I you stop. Stop. I
[1:01:52] know. I know. I know you did your
[1:01:54] family. I I know. I know you did your
[1:01:56] family de I know. I know you listen to I
[1:01:59] have you to know, brother Gabe. I listen
[1:02:00] to a You know what? Listen, brother
[1:02:03] Rams, that one sister came to said, "I
[1:02:05] have you to know I burn a candle every
[1:02:06] night
[1:02:08] and message people." I have you to know
[1:02:10] I listen to a message every night and
[1:02:13] just as mean as all get out.
[1:02:16] Just as mean as all get out, right?
[1:02:19] Hello, somebody. And it's the truth
[1:02:21] anyhow. Yeah. See, what good is to just
[1:02:25] listen to the message? If we don't have
[1:02:27] a feeling for that message,
[1:02:30] if there ain't no feeling in there, if
[1:02:34] we lay our head on that pillow, we just
[1:02:36] did a to-do list.
[1:02:39] If it was just checking the box,
[1:02:43] so that we can appease our our
[1:02:45] conscience for some reason.
[1:02:48] What good is it? Right?
[1:02:51] If it's all about our bank account, if
[1:02:55] it's all about our business, if it's all
[1:02:58] about our job or our school or you name
[1:03:01] it,
[1:03:03] or the last bit of
[1:03:09] overtime, guilty,
[1:03:14] see how we do
[1:03:17] and we get caught in this rat
[1:03:19] face of life and we lose the
[1:03:25] feeling for the
[1:03:33] people. Sorry, brother
[1:03:36] John. He said last service was pretty
[1:03:39] rough.
[1:03:44] Thank you, Lord. Listen, but I love I
[1:03:47] love you enough to tell you the truth.
[1:03:50] And I can I can only tell you what's on
[1:03:52] my heart.
[1:03:54] Listen, this when I listen to that
[1:03:56] prophet, there is such sincerity in that
[1:03:59] man's voice that it's a certain sound
[1:04:02] and it rings true. And I want that
[1:04:06] sincerity. When when when that man when
[1:04:08] that man would stand before that that
[1:04:11] Mexican man, I believe he was blind. And
[1:04:13] but remember the Mexican man and he he
[1:04:15] put his foot up to his foot and his foot
[1:04:17] was too big and he put his shoulders up
[1:04:20] to that man's shoulders and his jacket.
[1:04:22] Nothing would fit him. Brother Brandham
[1:04:24] was entering into the sufferings of that
[1:04:27] blind man. He was willing to give he was
[1:04:30] willing to take off his suit.
[1:04:34] And give it to this blind man. The man
[1:04:37] never he said looked like he didn't have
[1:04:38] a never had a good meal in his life
[1:04:41] because he entered into the
[1:04:44] sufferings. See, we live in such a busy
[1:04:47] world and we don't stop to enter into
[1:04:50] one another's
[1:04:52] sufferings. We're so quick to judge one
[1:04:55] another because we see something on a
[1:04:58] superficial level and we don't
[1:04:59] understand the complexity, the the
[1:05:02] levels that's that's making them the way
[1:05:04] that they are. And if we would stop and
[1:05:07] take a minute and actually look at the
[1:05:10] situation with a feeling,
[1:05:13] not just a quick quote we'd grabbed out
[1:05:15] of our mind,
[1:05:18] but we had a heart of
[1:05:21] compassion like that prophet, like Jesus
[1:05:24] Christ. Amen. Amen. That's what I want,
[1:05:27] friends. I want that's the kind of life
[1:05:30] I want to live. I want to be able to tap
[1:05:33] into that.
[1:05:36] to me that's eternal life.
[1:05:43] Brother Bram
[1:05:45] says, he says, you know, you have to
[1:05:47] enter into the sufferings of a person to
[1:05:51] have feelings for them. If it ever gets
[1:05:54] to a place that you can't feel sorry for
[1:05:56] the sick, then it's time that I can't
[1:05:59] feel sorry for the sick, then it's time
[1:06:00] for me to leave the platform praying for
[1:06:02] them. It's when I get to a place that I
[1:06:05] can't feel a burden for the sin on the
[1:06:07] people. Hello. Hello. Amen.
[1:06:11] He's He's saying he's been there.
[1:06:18] He says, "Then it's time for me to get
[1:06:21] away from here cuz I could never do no
[1:06:23] good for God." It's the feeling you have
[1:06:26] for the people. You know, it's a love
[1:06:29] that you can project to the people that
[1:06:32] they know you love them and they love
[1:06:36] you
[1:06:39] and
[1:06:40] you can feel it
[1:06:44] and there's something that happens then
[1:06:48] see you
[1:06:53] know we have to become we have to get I
[1:06:56] believe there has to be a tearing down
[1:07:00] in order for there to be a building up.
[1:07:04] And we have to make ourselves
[1:07:06] vulnerable and just be real.
[1:07:12] Like sit across the table and be honest
[1:07:15] one with another.
[1:07:17] Like if you got a problem with
[1:07:19] somebody, talk to them. Amen.
[1:07:25] Well, brother Gabe, what if the Bible
[1:07:27] tells you to do that?
[1:07:30] But the moment that you stop and you go,
[1:07:31] "Well, I don't want to offend." And you
[1:07:33] the fence is already there. That's
[1:07:35] right.
[1:07:36] Sometimes we have to get our hands dirty
[1:07:40] and we don't want to do that. But the
[1:07:43] moment we don't get our hands dirty,
[1:07:45] then we get mad, we get angry, little
[1:07:47] root of bitterness. And then that root
[1:07:49] of bitterness just grows and fers and
[1:07:52] fers and fers and f and it's all
[1:07:54] undercover. Nobody knows, but it's
[1:07:57] there. Amen. And then somebody does
[1:08:00] something that just pops that thing.
[1:08:05] And it wasn't what happened there. It
[1:08:08] was all of this built up that we never
[1:08:12] dealt with the unresolved issues.
[1:08:19] Friends, this is not Hollywood. No, sir.
[1:08:23] This is the greatest message that has
[1:08:26] ever struck the face of the earth. And
[1:08:30] there will be a people that live it.
[1:08:33] Amen. Yeah. And when this world is is
[1:08:36] stuck on Hollywood and showmanship and
[1:08:39] worried about their uh uh looking good
[1:08:43] for the people
[1:08:45] and there there will be a faithful few
[1:08:48] that's going to stand with this gospel
[1:08:51] and preach it in its purity and live it
[1:08:54] in its purity.
[1:08:57] There has to be because God would not
[1:08:59] send us a perfect message without that
[1:09:01] being. When we talk about perfect love
[1:09:04] coming, Brother Brandham tells us the
[1:09:07] definition of brotherly kindness and he
[1:09:10] says when we get to that brotherly
[1:09:13] kindness and I he he puts it so
[1:09:16] beautiful. The definition of brotherly
[1:09:19] kindness according to the prophet is put
[1:09:22] yourself in his place on the matter.
[1:09:26] Amen.
[1:09:29] So it don't have nothing to do with
[1:09:32] artificial smile. That's right.
[1:09:36] Charisma and telling jokes and Amen.
[1:09:40] That's not brotherly kindness.
[1:09:43] Brotherly
[1:09:44] kindness is walking a mile in that man's
[1:09:47] shoes. Amen.
[1:09:51] If we want to get to perfect love, if
[1:09:54] that's what we're waiting for, we want
[1:09:56] that per we want that capstone of love
[1:09:58] to cap it all off, then that right there
[1:10:01] is what we need to be. Amen. We ought to
[1:10:04] have that in our everyday life that we
[1:10:07] put our we put ourselves in the place of
[1:10:10] that person's matter.
[1:10:12] That means we have to set our lives
[1:10:14] aside and enter into the sufferings of
[1:10:18] that
[1:10:19] person. In an hour of self-love and a
[1:10:24] love of material things that's taking
[1:10:26] the true place of the love of God, there
[1:10:28] is going to be a people that's going to
[1:10:30] have that type of ability to enter into
[1:10:33] the sufferings of lost humanity, the
[1:10:35] worst of the worst, and have a feeling
[1:10:38] for them.
[1:10:40] Amen.
[1:10:45] That's That's not just Brother Brandham.
[1:10:49] Listen, when when when when brother
[1:10:52] Brandham when when brother Brandham
[1:10:54] um uh when when
[1:11:02] when when brother
[1:11:04] Brandham went off went off when Oh man,
[1:11:07] I tell you
[1:11:08] what. Oh boy. There's uh it's it's it's
[1:11:12] just uh let me try to find a place to
[1:11:14] close here. I I I'll say this. Look look
[1:11:17] at Jesus. Look at Jesus in his fir at
[1:11:20] Jesus's first
[1:11:23] coming it at Jesus's first coming.
[1:11:27] Brother Brandham says that when when
[1:11:31] Gabriel come to
[1:11:33] Zachcharias when Gabriel come to
[1:11:35] Zachcharias
[1:11:37] Zachcharias did not believe the angel's
[1:11:40] message. Amen. And he said for he had
[1:11:42] found he says now Zachchariah would have
[1:11:45] had plenty of examples. So when Gabriel
[1:11:48] told him that Elizabeth was going to
[1:11:50] conceive, he doubted. Yeah. And brother
[1:11:53] Brandham called him a callous
[1:11:57] priest. So at the first coming of
[1:12:00] Christ, where was the calluses at on the
[1:12:04] body?
[1:12:15] was on the priesthood. That's right.
[1:12:18] Amen.
[1:12:21] And they were in the office, but they
[1:12:24] become
[1:12:26] callous. There was only a handful of
[1:12:28] believers
[1:12:30] there. And he lost his voice.
[1:12:35] Amen. Praise God.
[1:12:38] And and and to me it makes me fear and
[1:12:42] tremble
[1:12:44] that if we ain't careful we can become
[1:12:46] so polished
[1:12:50] that we become calloused.
[1:12:54] We live in a world where where where
[1:12:57] we're constantly what does a callous
[1:12:59] come from? It's it's from work and
[1:13:01] grinding it.
[1:13:04] Yeah. But how do we stay soft?
[1:13:09] How do we stay moldable?
[1:13:12] How do we stay pliable
[1:13:15] in a world that's so bitter?
[1:13:19] It'll only the there the only love
[1:13:24] that will be left will only be amongst
[1:13:26] God's elect. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:30] And if and if we are calloused and life
[1:13:35] has has hardened us, then listen, you
[1:13:39] have to be honest enough with yourself
[1:13:41] and say, "God, I should not be feeling
[1:13:44] this way."
[1:13:47] Like no matter what somebody does to you
[1:13:51] wrong, the moment you lose that love for
[1:13:54] them, something's wrong. Amen. That's
[1:13:58] right. Amen. And I'm I'm not I I know
[1:14:02] cuz I've been
[1:14:05] there. And it's not
[1:14:08] easy. You know, we as human beings, we
[1:14:11] can only take so much
[1:14:13] punishment, right?
[1:14:16] And and sometimes life is a grind.
[1:14:19] And and sometimes it gets real dark.
[1:14:23] And and sometimes it gets so black that
[1:14:27] you don't know which way to go. And I
[1:14:29] get it. I've been there. I know it. I
[1:14:32] know it
[1:14:34] well. But there is a place of relief.
[1:14:37] Yes, sir.
[1:14:40] And and you don't have to stay
[1:14:43] there, but you have to make a
[1:14:46] choice. Regardless of how you feel, you
[1:14:50] have to confess God's word is right.
[1:14:53] Amen. No matter what I'm feeling, that's
[1:14:56] what the Bible says and that's exactly
[1:14:58] what I believe. There's so many times in
[1:15:01] my life, friends, I I knew I I've since
[1:15:04] I was a little boy, I always knew this
[1:15:07] message was right. And I spent decades
[1:15:10] of my life going, "That's right and I'm
[1:15:13] wrong." Amen. And I don't know how to
[1:15:15] get there. But I just kept
[1:15:19] confessing. I just kept confessing that
[1:15:21] Bible is right. This message is right.
[1:15:24] And by that confession, my body came
[1:15:27] into subjection to that word.
[1:15:32] But the moment we stop doing that, it
[1:15:35] takes honesty. It takes sincerity.
[1:15:40] It takes admitting we're wrong.
[1:15:44] Amen. And by doing that, it brings this
[1:15:48] old house of flesh subject to God's
[1:15:52] word. Praise God. Amen. And and and is
[1:15:56] it easy? Absolutely not. If it was,
[1:16:00] everybody would do it. That's right. But
[1:16:03] God is calling us to a higher level that
[1:16:07] we will we will be that invincible army.
[1:16:10] And it won't be uh AR-15s and buoy
[1:16:14] knives. It'll be it'll be this faithful
[1:16:17] little book that we'll be holding,
[1:16:20] right? That's this right here is our
[1:16:23] protection. This right here is our
[1:16:25] artillery. This right here is our
[1:16:27] nuclear weapon.
[1:16:29] It's the unfailing realities of a living
[1:16:31] God. But if we ain't careful, we can
[1:16:34] become like brother Brandham said about
[1:16:36] that old salt when that young man came
[1:16:39] to that to that ocean and he was a poet
[1:16:41] and he had wrote about the the the the
[1:16:44] white caps and you know and all those
[1:16:47] different things and he was so excited
[1:16:49] to see the ocean and that old that old
[1:16:51] salt. He had been born on that 60 years
[1:16:54] and he had seen that sunrise so many
[1:16:57] times and he had seen the waves year
[1:16:59] after year and it had lost its luster.
[1:17:06] And he said, "I don't see nothing about
[1:17:08] that." You know, he had to have
[1:17:10] something deep.
[1:17:18] Slid that in on you there.
[1:17:27] Well, I mean, we can have all the deep
[1:17:29] things,
[1:17:31] but make sure you got a feeling with
[1:17:32] those deep things.
[1:17:35] See, cuz that prophet had the deep
[1:17:37] things, but he had a feeling to go with
[1:17:39] it. That's right. And he had he had
[1:17:42] something that he could touch the heart
[1:17:44] of God with.
[1:17:46] And not only could he touch the heart of
[1:17:48] God, he could touch the heart of the
[1:17:51] people.
[1:17:52] Amen. Because he had a reality in his
[1:17:56] life. Listen, people are watching
[1:18:01] you. Whether you know it or
[1:18:06] not, your co-workers, when they test
[1:18:09] you, they're watching you, waiting for
[1:18:11] your response.
[1:18:13] And you know what they're waiting on?
[1:18:15] They're waiting to say, "I told you so."
[1:18:25] Yeah. But if if you can be conscious
[1:18:29] enough in those
[1:18:31] moments to be
[1:18:33] salty, you can turn it on them.
[1:18:37] Not. And and I'm not talking about so
[1:18:40] that you can show off,
[1:18:43] but you can you can you can you can flip
[1:18:46] it on them in a way that makes them
[1:18:49] think and you'll go they'll go, "Oh,
[1:18:53] maybe there is something different about
[1:18:55] them."
[1:18:58] See, we we can all get behind the pull
[1:19:00] pit, be preacher man, and we can all be
[1:19:02] in the pews and be church person, but
[1:19:05] out there Amen. That's right. Out
[1:19:10] there when when we're 50 miles
[1:19:14] away, when when we're when we're when
[1:19:17] we're five states away,
[1:19:21] are we going to be preacher man then?
[1:19:24] Are we going to be church person
[1:19:28] then? Or are we just worried about how
[1:19:31] we look amongst ourselves?
[1:19:34] I I I'm not so much worried about
[1:19:37] you. I I want I It's when I'm out on the
[1:19:40] battlefield. Amen. I'm sure this is a
[1:19:42] battlefield here, but it really it's
[1:19:45] when we're out there.
[1:19:48] That's right. I I want to be a real
[1:19:50] Christian then.
[1:19:53] I want them to see Christ reflecting in
[1:19:55] my life. Then
[1:19:58] that's when I want to have a
[1:20:01] feeling. And is it is it going to be
[1:20:06] something that comes
[1:20:11] uh the only way this is going to happen
[1:20:14] is by re
[1:20:17] relationship because we can't do it in
[1:20:19] ourselves.
[1:20:21] That's the whole point. Lady Oia is too
[1:20:25] black and too dark and too
[1:20:28] complex. And we are no match for Lady
[1:20:31] Oia. No, no matter no matter how
[1:20:34] fortified we have our home and how
[1:20:36] insulated we have and you know listen,
[1:20:40] the trials are going to be there no
[1:20:42] matter what. Amen.
[1:20:46] And we could either we can
[1:20:48] either run to
[1:20:51] them or we can run away from them.
[1:20:55] Amen.
[1:20:58] And too many times we spend most of our
[1:21:00] life trying to run away from
[1:21:02] them. And that same trial comes right
[1:21:05] back
[1:21:09] around because God is trying to get you
[1:21:12] to learn the lesson.
[1:21:17] I I want to learn. Don't you?
[1:21:20] Can you stand with me?
[1:21:36] And as we
[1:21:51] stand, I just want to read this. I read
[1:21:54] it to you last time, but I just want you
[1:21:56] to look at it with me one more
[1:21:58] time. He said, "You could maybe sis, you
[1:22:02] just play something something
[1:22:04] soft." Um, he says, "You could tell me
[1:22:07] what a great God Brother Neville was,
[1:22:09] how fine a man he was. If I just heard,
[1:22:12] that's all right. I believe it. Oh,
[1:22:14] sure. I believe it. But I'll never know
[1:22:16] personally until I fellowship with him a
[1:22:18] while. till I sat down at the table
[1:22:21] together across the table and lay our
[1:22:24] hearts out before each other and our
[1:22:26] spirits blend begin to blend together.
[1:22:31] Then I about know what he's made up of
[1:22:34] until you might hear of Jesus by
[1:22:36] preaching. You might hear your mother
[1:22:38] say he's wonderful. You might hear a
[1:22:41] minister say he heals the sick. And you
[1:22:42] might have you and he might have sent
[1:22:45] his power forth and healed.
[1:22:48] But you'll never know what it is until
[1:22:50] you sat down once with him in fellowship
[1:22:53] and your spirit blends together, bearing
[1:22:56] record with each other that you're sons
[1:22:58] and daughters of God. Then the old
[1:23:01] things pass away and you don't have to
[1:23:02] worry about the world no more. For by
[1:23:05] one offering, he has perfected those who
[1:23:07] have fellowship with him through his
[1:23:08] blood. Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:15] True
[1:23:20] fellowship. If If How many wants to have
[1:23:23] that
[1:23:24] feeling? Wants a feeling. Yes, we should
[1:23:27] all I'm not talking about no touchy
[1:23:29] feeling. Weird. I'm not talking about
[1:23:31] that. I'm I'm talking about having a
[1:23:34] feeling for for not just our brothers
[1:23:37] and sisters. Listen, some of us has lost
[1:23:40] the feeling. That feeling so bad, we
[1:23:42] don't even have a feeling amongst us as
[1:23:44] here, let alone out on the
[1:23:47] world. And listen, if that's where
[1:23:49] you're at, be honest enough with God and
[1:23:53] say, "Lord, I need a
[1:23:56] renewing. Lord, I need a refilling of
[1:24:01] your Holy
[1:24:02] Spirit. This world is callous to me.
[1:24:11] Lord, I I I know I I I've lost the joy
[1:24:15] of my
[1:24:17] salvation. Life is not
[1:24:20] easy. And you youngsters, look, even
[1:24:23] maybe some of you young ones, sometimes
[1:24:25] life hits you in a certain way and and
[1:24:29] it takes twists and turns. And if you
[1:24:30] ain't careful, you can become bitter
[1:24:32] even at a young age because life ain't
[1:24:35] happening the way you thought it was
[1:24:37] going to
[1:24:38] be. But listen, why don't you be honest
[1:24:41] with
[1:24:42] God and say, "Lord, I I had preconceived
[1:24:46] ideas. I had the white picket fence and
[1:24:49] I had the dog named Fritz and I had this
[1:24:51] all
[1:24:52] and and life took an unexpected twist
[1:24:55] and
[1:24:58] listen. Sit across the table from the
[1:25:02] Almighty and open up your
[1:25:06] heart and say, "God, I I need help."
[1:25:12] cuz we're living at a time, friends. If
[1:25:13] you don't if we don't do that on a daily
[1:25:17] basis, listen, this is not just because
[1:25:20] of Wednesday night. This is something we
[1:25:23] have to be mindful of every day of our
[1:25:26] life because we rub elbows with the
[1:25:30] world and we've got fallen people and
[1:25:33] family members and problems and
[1:25:36] backstabbings and blah blah blah blah
[1:25:39] blah.
[1:25:40] And and tomorrow morning when you go to
[1:25:44] work, be
[1:25:46] ready cuz Satan's going to be there to
[1:25:49] try you.
[1:25:52] If you raise your hand and you say,
[1:25:53] "Lord, I I I want that feeling." Satan's
[1:25:57] marking you going, "Okay, we're going to
[1:26:01] see." And and we have to be honest
[1:26:04] enough and say, "God, I cannot do it on
[1:26:06] my
[1:26:07] own." But Lord, I want, you know, to me,
[1:26:11] when I hear that prophet, he had such
[1:26:14] sincerity. Amen. And when I when I when
[1:26:17] I hear
[1:26:19] that when he talks to
[1:26:22] me and and and for the angel to say you
[1:26:25] have to be more
[1:26:26] sincere and I oh that just cuts me to
[1:26:29] the heart and I say God where am I
[1:26:33] at? And and we can be cleaned up and all
[1:26:37] of those things, but where is our
[1:26:43] sincerity? Are we mindful that our hands
[1:26:46] is his
[1:26:47] hands? Are we mindful on every day that
[1:26:52] my heart, my heart, I want it to be his
[1:26:55] heart? When we see that coworker first
[1:26:58] thing in the morning, do we run the
[1:27:00] other way or do we run to
[1:27:02] him? Do we avoid or do we face the
[1:27:06] battle? And do we face the battle in
[1:27:09] love?
[1:27:12] Or do we just build walls and fences and
[1:27:15] protection and defense mechanisms?
[1:27:18] That's not
[1:27:23] living. That's not what we're called to
[1:27:26] be. We're called to be the beating
[1:27:30] heart. That's right. Of God Almighty.
[1:27:34] Amen. that bleeding
[1:27:38] heart that stands in the gap and says,
[1:27:42] "Lord, if there be
[1:27:48] 10, Lord, if there if there if Lord, if
[1:27:52] there be
[1:27:55] five or or do you are or do you love the
[1:27:58] quotes where Brother Brandham talks
[1:27:59] about cannon fodder?
[1:28:06] Come on,
[1:28:08] friends. Stop. If that if that's if
[1:28:11] that's the quotes that get you riled up,
[1:28:14] something's wrong.
[1:28:18] Nothing wrong with what what the prophet
[1:28:19] have said. But if that's what stirs you,
[1:28:23] brother, you ought to have a bleeding
[1:28:25] heart knowing that that could have been
[1:28:29] you
[1:28:30] if it wasn't for the grace of God.
[1:28:36] We are nothing
[1:28:37] special. It's the grace of God that we
[1:28:41] are what we are.
[1:28:43] It was unmmerited grace that extended
[1:28:47] his hands out of
[1:28:50] mercy. And because we are recipients of
[1:28:54] that, that ought to be the predominant
[1:28:56] force in our life that goes back
[1:29:01] out. And if it's
[1:29:03] not, something is wrong. we've drawn
[1:29:07] back when when when in in the Old
[1:29:10] Testament when when when that when that
[1:29:13] offer when that person would offer that
[1:29:16] sacrifice when they would when when they
[1:29:19] would offer that sacrifice, no offense
[1:29:21] to you, on the back row, they couldn't
[1:29:23] sit on the back
[1:29:25] row. They couldn't sit, you know, hidden
[1:29:28] and and away from everybody, but they
[1:29:32] had to come right down to the
[1:29:35] altar. It had to be personal. And they
[1:29:39] had to touch that sacrifice and they had
[1:29:43] to when they laid their hand on that
[1:29:44] lamb, whatever it was, the bullock, what
[1:29:47] they had to lay their hand on that and
[1:29:49] they had to feel the life leaving that
[1:29:52] animal's body knowing that it should
[1:29:55] have been theirs.
[1:29:59] But the problem of it was it become
[1:30:02] common to them. That's right.
[1:30:04] to where after a while they would lay
[1:30:06] their hand on that sacrifice and it
[1:30:09] didn't have a feeling anymore.
[1:30:12] It just became a
[1:30:14] duty. It became what that's what their
[1:30:18] family
[1:30:19] does. And listen, you young brothers,
[1:30:22] you young sisters, you may be coming
[1:30:24] here because mom and dad and this is
[1:30:27] Listen, don't let it be a family church.
[1:30:32] This has to be your church.
[1:30:35] This has to be a reality for you.
[1:30:39] That you come here because God called
[1:30:41] you to this
[1:30:43] message because you young person has
[1:30:46] personally laid your hand on that
[1:30:49] sacrifice. It wasn't mom and dad. You
[1:30:52] came down to the altar. You laid your
[1:30:54] hand on the sacrifice. You realize that
[1:30:57] it should have been your life, but he
[1:30:59] gave it to you. Amen.
[1:31:02] And you don't feel just the the the life
[1:31:04] leaving him. You feel the charge of the
[1:31:06] Holy Spirit come into your
[1:31:09] body. And it gives you life and life
[1:31:13] more
[1:31:15] abundantly. See, that's the only way we
[1:31:17] can have that
[1:31:19] feeling in this world.
[1:31:22] We can go one of a few
[1:31:24] ways, but I don't want to lose that
[1:31:27] feeling. Do
[1:31:29] you? How many wants a a fresh feeling of
[1:31:34] that feeling?
[1:31:35] Let's bow our
[1:31:39] heads. Heavenly
[1:31:42] Father, truly Lord, we love you this
[1:31:45] evening.
[1:31:46] And Lord, uh, simple thought,
[1:31:52] but Lord, when we're on the battlefield,
[1:31:54] it becomes so
[1:31:56] complex. Lord, we want to be
[1:31:59] real. We want that reality in our lives,
[1:32:02] Lord. our everyday lives. Not not just
[1:32:05] in church, but uh Thursday morning,
[1:32:09] Friday evening, Lord, all throughout the
[1:32:12] weekend, every day, Lord, when we rise
[1:32:16] and when we lay our head on that pillar
[1:32:19] tonight, Lord, tomorrow, we want the
[1:32:23] consolation that we've done our best.
[1:32:26] I pray Lord for each one of my brothers
[1:32:30] and
[1:32:30] sisters that we would each one check
[1:32:36] up that we would each
[1:32:38] one search our lives
[1:32:41] and if there's a place where we become
[1:32:44] callous I pray that the bomb of Gilead
[1:32:48] Lord would flow freely from your throne
[1:32:52] and soften us Lord this world is cold
[1:32:58] and indifferent. But I pray that your
[1:33:02] the fire of your Holy Spirit would
[1:33:05] rekindle aresh and make this scripture,
[1:33:08] this word new in our hearts. And God,
[1:33:11] that we would have a renewing of your
[1:33:14] Holy Spirit, a refreshing, a refilling,
[1:33:18] rejuvenating, Lord, that we would go to
[1:33:22] higher heights and deeper depths. And
[1:33:25] Lord, that we would be mindful and
[1:33:27] conscience
[1:33:29] aware that when we reach out a hand that
[1:33:34] it's your hand that's being
[1:33:36] extended. That when we put our arm
[1:33:40] around a
[1:33:41] brother, shake a sister's
[1:33:44] hand, maybe just give them an extra pat
[1:33:47] on the hand, look him in the eye and
[1:33:50] tell them we love them. Lord, I pray
[1:33:53] that that feeling would be there that
[1:33:56] they that that recipient would be able
[1:33:59] to feel it
[1:34:00] back. Lord, they may need that
[1:34:03] encouragement. I pray that we would be
[1:34:05] so sensitive. Lord, be more aware, more
[1:34:10] conscience that that selfishness of life
[1:34:13] would fade away and that eternal life
[1:34:16] would become so preeminent in our lives
[1:34:18] that it would no more be about our our
[1:34:21] to-do list and what we got to do and it
[1:34:24] wouldn't be about business and work and
[1:34:26] overtime and but it would it would be
[1:34:28] about living for
[1:34:30] others. Uh that's my prayer, Lord. I I
[1:34:35] certainly fall short of what I've been
[1:34:38] preaching this evening. And I pray in
[1:34:41] Jesus' name that you'd be my helper.
[1:34:44] God, I I truly I want to
[1:34:47] be I want to be one of those faithful
[1:34:51] ones that's standing here, Lord. And
[1:34:56] when you're looking for faith, you'll
[1:34:58] find it in me. when you return and
[1:35:02] you're looking for faith, you'll find it
[1:35:04] in each one of my brothers and sisters
[1:35:06] here that we won't be callous like
[1:35:09] Zacharias was, but we'd be soft and
[1:35:12] tender and moldable and pliable and meat
[1:35:15] for the master's use. God, we commit all
[1:35:18] we are into your hands. We love you. We
[1:35:21] praise you. We commit all these things,
[1:35:24] asking your blessings upon each one.
[1:35:26] You've seen the hands and I pray that
[1:35:28] you hear the hearts cry in Jesus name we
[1:35:31] ask these
[1:35:32] things.
[1:35:34] Amen. God bless you saints. What's that
[1:35:38] song brother we singing
[1:35:40] there? Sing it for me brother.
[1:35:43] Here is
[1:35:44] love vast as the
[1:35:48] ocean. Loving kindness.
[1:35:54] be happy to pray with you. When the
[1:35:56] prince of life, our
[1:36:00] ransom, shed for us, his precious
[1:36:05] blood, who his
[1:36:08] love will not
[1:36:11] remember, who can cease to sing his
[1:36:17] praise. He will
[1:36:20] never be forgotten.
[1:36:24] throughout
[1:36:26] hell eternal
[1:36:29] days. On the
[1:36:31] mount of
[1:36:34] crucifixion, fountains
[1:36:37] open deep and
[1:36:40] wide. Through the
[1:36:43] floodgates of God's
[1:36:46] mercy flow of
[1:36:48] vast and gracious
[1:36:51] high grace and
[1:36:54] love like mighty
[1:36:57] rivers flowing
[1:37:00] sassing from above.
[1:37:04] Heaven's peace and perfect
[1:37:09] justice. Kiss the
[1:37:11] guilty world in
[1:37:15] love. Let me all thy love accept
[1:37:20] thee. Love thee
[1:37:23] ever all my days.
[1:37:27] Let me
[1:37:28] see thy kingdom
[1:37:31] only and my life be to thy
[1:37:37] praise. Thou
[1:37:39] alone will be my
[1:37:43] glory. Nothing
[1:37:45] in this world I
[1:37:49] see. Thou has
[1:37:51] plans has sanctified me.
[1:37:55] Thou thy
[1:37:57] s has set me
[1:38:01] free. In thy
[1:38:03] truth, thou dost direct
[1:38:06] me. By thy
[1:38:09] spirit through thy
[1:38:12] word and thy grace my need is
[1:38:18] meeting as I
[1:38:20] trust in thee, my Lord.
[1:38:25] of thy
[1:38:26] fold is thou our
[1:38:30] glory. Thy great
[1:38:32] love and love on
[1:38:39] me for
[1:38:41] my calling
[1:38:44] out my heart to thee.
[1:38:50] Something keeps holding
[1:38:56] me. Every day I
[1:39:02] see he's helping me
[1:39:07] faithfully to
[1:39:10] overcome my trials.
[1:39:16] He's guiding me
[1:39:23] constantly, giving me
[1:39:30] victory. It's a reality.
[1:39:36] Something keeps
[1:39:43] holding. And the trials of this
[1:39:50] world, we're getting stronger.
[1:39:58] And the hole I
[1:40:01] fill was more than I could bear.
[1:40:11] And I was on the
[1:40:17] verge of giving
[1:40:23] over and the strength within
[1:40:30] myself just wasn't there.
[1:40:38] Something keeps holding
[1:40:41] me, holding
[1:40:43] me. Every day I
[1:40:49] see he's helping me
[1:40:55] faithfully to
[1:40:57] overcome my
[1:41:02] trial. He's guiding me
[1:41:10] constantly, giving me
[1:41:17] victory. It's a
[1:41:22] reality. Something keeps
[1:41:24] holding me.
[1:41:31] And Satan
[1:41:34] laid before
[1:41:37] me his
[1:41:44] temptation. Give his
[1:41:47] desire to steal away my faith.
[1:41:58] What I have found
[1:42:03] inside a
[1:42:08] revelation. It was the strength I need
[1:42:14] to keep me in this race.
[1:42:23] Something keeps holding
[1:42:26] me, holding
[1:42:29] me. Every day I
[1:42:34] see that he's helping me
[1:42:40] faithfully to
[1:42:42] overcome my trials.
[1:42:49] He's guiding me
[1:42:55] constantly, giving me
[1:43:02] victory. It's a
[1:43:06] reality that something keeps
[1:43:09] holding me.
