[12:49] part of this tape Lord maybe glean Lord

[13:25] and God bless you you can be seated for
[13:28] just a few minutes thank you musicians
[13:31] we are going to go into the third part
[13:34] of our tape service here on there is a
[13:38] man that can hear that can turn on the
[13:39] light we've been listening to this over
[13:42] the last previous two Wednesdays this is
[13:44] the third Wednesday and we should be
[13:46] able to finish the tape tonight that's
[13:48] the plan
[13:49] I want to go through
[13:51] our book here I hope everybody still has
[13:54] their book or their tablet or their
[13:56] phone or whatever they're going through
[13:57] we're going to get into this third part
[13:59] we'll go into the questions in just a
[14:01] minute
[14:02] I want to do a quick just a real quick
[14:05] review of some of the questions we've
[14:07] had the last two times then we'll go
[14:10] through the questions for tonight and
[14:12] then we'll read our opening scriptures
[14:13] and get right into the tape
[14:16] uh the first question that we asked two
[14:19] weeks ago was What is the subject that
[14:21] brother Brandon was going into
[14:23] and is going to speak on and he said his
[14:26] subject was light so his title is
[14:28] there's a man here that can turn on the
[14:29] light but his subject is light and then
[14:32] we asked also the question what how does
[14:34] light come and he said by the spoken
[14:37] word of God so how does light come by
[14:39] the spoken word of God and then another
[14:41] question was life comes by what
[14:44] by the word of God manifested or made
[14:47] flesh so we've we've got all of these
[14:50] things that he's been teaching us
[14:51] through this message then last Wednesday
[14:55] we had a couple more questions I'm not
[14:56] going through all of them I'm just
[14:57] pulling out a couple just to refresh us
[14:59] where we've been as we move on we ask
[15:02] the question what guides you to the
[15:03] light and the answer is the word the
[15:06] word is what guides us to the light and
[15:09] that's going to be important tonight and
[15:10] something brother Venom gets into and
[15:11] also something we'll review at the end
[15:13] is what guides you to the light is the
[15:15] word and we are so thankful that we live
[15:18] in a day where we all have a Bible
[15:21] we have it interpreted in our language
[15:22] we all have free access to it amen in in
[15:25] the word of God is our guide that guides
[15:28] us to the light amen and um and and
[15:32] we'll talk about that more a little bit
[15:33] later but it's it's we're so thankful
[15:36] too that the messages have come and
[15:38] taken the veil off of the word to give
[15:40] us the correct interpretation of the
[15:42] word and so now we're not dependent on
[15:44] this one says this and this one says
[15:46] that but God has brought back the
[15:48] correct interpretation of his word so
[15:51] we're not pulled to and fro but we come
[15:53] back to the message of the hour which is
[15:55] restored us back to our Bibles with the
[15:58] correct interpretation of the Bible and
[16:01] it guides us to the light
[16:03] that is so important that we we always
[16:06] keep that foundational truth intact
[16:09] another question was why did they reject
[16:11] the Messiah
[16:13] and the answer was they were living in
[16:14] the glare of another age because of
[16:16] their Traditions so why did they reject
[16:18] the Messiah because they were living in
[16:20] the glare of a previous age by their
[16:22] Traditions why did they reject the
[16:24] Messiah Christ in our day for the exact
[16:27] same reasons
[16:29] amen another question was we cannot live
[16:31] by what kind of light and the prophet
[16:34] said yesterday's light we cannot live by
[16:36] yesterday's life yesterday's light
[16:39] brought yesterday's life
[16:41] but we must live by today's light and he
[16:44] also went on to say you cannot live by
[16:46] yesterday's manna that got wiggle tails
[16:48] in it and it rotted you have to have the
[16:51] fresh Manna for the day you're living in
[16:53] to live by amen praise God
[16:57] so I'd like to go into the questions for
[17:00] tonight
[17:02] all right
[17:06] question number one
[17:07] how do we bring forth the reflection of
[17:10] Jesus Christ
[17:17] how do we bring forth the reflection of
[17:20] Jesus Christ
[17:32] this is when it would have been nice to
[17:34] learn shorthand
[17:40] question number two what caused the
[17:43] greatest robbery the Church of God had
[17:47] foreign
[17:49] what caused the greatest robbery the
[17:53] Church of God had
[18:15] question number three
[18:18] how does the church remit sin
[18:22] how does the church remit sins
[18:25] this is a good one
[18:41] in number four
[18:44] who is the chief mechanic
[18:49] probably know the answer but I want to
[18:50] see it in context
[18:52] who's the chief mechanic I'll give you a
[18:54] little clue he's also the man that can
[18:56] turn on the light
[18:58] and we're finally going to get to that
[18:59] part in part three but the brand hasn't
[19:02] touched on that yet but we'll get to
[19:03] that
[19:04] tonight who is the chief mechanic
[19:08] and number five
[19:10] how does he turn on the light
[19:13] so we know there's a man who can turn on
[19:15] the light but the question is how does
[19:16] he turn on the light
[19:18] and that's a good question
[19:26] all right
[19:27] if you're done writing the questions
[19:29] let's just stand and read our scriptures
[19:31] so we stay familiar with the scriptures
[19:32] brother Benham used in the beginning
[19:34] we're going to turn to Isaiah 42
[19:37] and in Isaiah 42 we're going to begin
[19:39] reading from verse 1.
[19:42] so Isaiah 42
[19:48] Isaiah 42 and 1.
[19:51] behold my servant whom I uphold mine
[19:53] elect in whom my soul delighteth I have
[19:56] put my spirit upon him he shall bring
[19:58] forth judgment to the Gentiles he shall
[20:00] not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice
[20:02] to be heard in the street
[20:04] a bruised Reed shall he not break in a
[20:07] smoking flax shall he not quench he
[20:09] shall bring forth judgment unto truth he
[20:11] shall not fail nor be discouraged till
[20:13] he have set judgment in the earth and
[20:15] the Isle shall wait for his long
[20:17] thus saith God the Lord he he that
[20:20] created the heavens and stressed him out
[20:22] he that spreadeth forth the Earth and
[20:24] that which cometh out of it he that
[20:26] giveth breath unto the people upon it
[20:29] and spirit to them that walk therein
[20:31] I the Lord have called thee in
[20:33] righteousness and will hold thine hand
[20:35] and will keep thee and give thee for a
[20:37] covenant of the people for a light of
[20:39] the Gentiles to open the blind eyes to
[20:42] bring out the prisoners from the prison
[20:44] and them that sit in darkness out of the
[20:46] prison house now I want
[20:49] to re we're reviewing back to Brothers
[20:52] opening scripture but now we're
[20:54] two-thirds of the way almost into this
[20:56] message and we realize he's talking
[20:58] about people coming out of
[21:00] denominational darkness and Delight
[21:03] now look at what Christ is to do he's
[21:06] for a lighter to the Gentiles to open
[21:08] the blind eyes to bring out the
[21:11] prisoners from the prison and them that
[21:12] sit in darkness out of the prison house
[21:15] so now we realize how bad the
[21:18] denominational system is in the light of
[21:20] the scripture
[21:22] it's a prison house that's barred people
[21:25] from Christ
[21:27] so it's I think it's always good to
[21:29] remember the scriptures brother Branham
[21:31] sets as the as this context because then
[21:34] as he goes into preaching you realize
[21:36] he's taking it from this and now we
[21:38] realize how much the Gentiles need light
[21:41] and that our eyes were blind and we were
[21:43] in prison
[21:45] let's go to Matthew chapter 4 which is
[21:47] the second scripture that brother
[21:48] Brenham read
[21:52] Matthew chapter 4.
[21:56] and verse 12.
[22:00] Matthew chapter 4 and begin reading at
[22:03] verse 12.
[22:06] now when Jesus had heard that John was
[22:08] cast into prison he departed into
[22:10] Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and
[22:12] dwelton Capernaum which is upon the
[22:14] Seacoast and the borders of Zebulon and
[22:16] naphthalam that it might be fulfilled
[22:19] which was spoken by Isaiah's the prophet
[22:21] saying the land of Zebulon in the land
[22:23] of nathalum by the way of the sea Beyond
[22:26] Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the
[22:28] people which sat in darkness saw a great
[22:30] light and to them which sat in the
[22:32] region and shadow of death light has
[22:34] sprung up from that time Jesus began to
[22:37] preach and say repent for the Kingdom of
[22:39] Heaven is at hand
[22:42] so after the ministry of John
[22:45] the Baptist which was an Elijah Ministry
[22:48] Jesus moved into the land of the
[22:51] Gentiles
[22:53] and it said a great light has sprung up
[22:56] to those that sit in darkness
[22:59] to those that's the people that sit in
[23:00] darkness
[23:02] saw great light and to them it sit in
[23:04] the region in the shadows of death light
[23:06] is sprung up and Jesus began to preach
[23:08] saying repent for the Kingdom of Heaven
[23:11] as at hand
[23:13] now do you see where we're at
[23:15] there was a man here who can turn on the
[23:18] light amen you can take your seats
[23:21] if you'd like to take your books or
[23:23] whatever you'll be reading along in
[23:25] we're going to begin at the top of page
[23:28] 33 in our books if you have the book and
[23:30] the top of page 33 which is the
[23:32] beginning of paragraph 179 so if you're
[23:34] using a tablet or a phone it would be
[23:36] the beginning of paragraph 179 and we're
[23:39] going to go all the way to the end and
[23:42] and you know don't forget you have the
[23:44] freedom to say Amen to the word amen
[23:46] this is the preaching of the word and
[23:48] also at the end we're going to be all
[23:50] the way through the closing out of the
[23:51] service where brother random spraying
[23:52] and singing and feel free to sing along
[23:55] amen I enjoy it when we all sing along
[23:58] with the table so God bless you brother
[24:00] Frank if we can begin
[24:06] yesterday it's oh my how we are to see
[24:09] that see that the rotten things of
[24:11] yesterday don't eat them today
[24:14] it's got worms in it you know these
[24:16] little wiggle Tails I call them I don't
[24:18] know I I don't know much about germi but
[24:20] I know we always call them wiggle tails
[24:23] it gets in anything but it gets a little
[24:25] rotten see I don't want it then
[24:28] if you're satisfied with it go ahead but
[24:31] not me but remember you say then why was
[24:34] it good yesterday if you only knew that
[24:36] the very little Hull that was on the
[24:38] wheat at the beginning if it abides in
[24:41] the green it makes the grain further
[24:44] that's the very thing that makes a wheat
[24:47] flour
[24:48] yeah
[24:49] is what was yesterday but if it
[24:51] separates itself from the green it don't
[24:53] mature then it goes away but if it goes
[24:57] through the process of life-giving
[24:58] process as it dies out it just Blends
[25:01] into something else and makes a grain
[25:02] amen if it isn't where does it come from
[25:06] amen amen
[25:08] amen like the Queen of England once
[25:12] she went to a great paper company and
[25:14] she said she would like to see through
[25:16] the paper of Mills so they showed her
[25:18] the paper mills many years ago and
[25:20] before they went to making it to both
[25:22] the stuff so they find they're making
[25:23] papers out of it so they
[25:25] Roger while she come into a room that
[25:27] was nothing but a big old pile of dirty
[25:29] rags
[25:30] and she said where did this come from
[25:34] what's this oh she said the the
[25:36] president of the plane said this is uh
[25:39] is what uh we'll make the paper out of
[25:42] these dirty Ray she said that make paper
[25:44] yes so she couldn't hardly believe it so
[25:47] actually she was gone the man took the
[25:49] same dirty pile of eggs and running
[25:51] through a certain process and brought
[25:53] him out with clean pure paper you know
[25:55] have been went through a process and
[25:57] made real and put her profile in it and
[25:59] santera reflected herself in this what
[26:01] she called dirty rags
[26:03] now that's what it is the dead things of
[26:06] yestery the message of Luther the
[26:09] message of Wesley the message of
[26:11] Pentecost if it can only go through the
[26:14] process of God's holy spirit in the word
[26:16] of the Vindication yes it'll bring forth
[26:19] the reflection of Jesus Christ
[26:24] but if you leave it lay it's dirty Rays
[26:27] it's got to be molded into something
[26:29] else
[26:30] Luther has got to be molded into West
[26:33] and Western's got to be molded into
[26:34] Pentecost and Pentecost it's got to be
[26:36] molded into Christ
[26:38] it goes through a process so has the
[26:41] gospel gone through a process is
[26:43] processing Luther's age of justification
[26:46] we believe that amenities of
[26:48] sanctification we believe that the
[26:50] Pentecostals of the restoration of the
[26:51] gifts of the Holy Ghost we believe that
[26:54] certainly but mold it all together what
[26:56] do you come out with Jesus
[26:59] the same yesterday today and forever
[27:06] Jesus when a man of founder is making a
[27:09] bell he's got a certain tone he has to
[27:11] putt in it when he's setting his mold
[27:13] and pouring his iron he puts in so much
[27:15] brass so much steel so much copper why
[27:18] he knows just exactly how much to put in
[27:20] but to make you at the right tone and
[27:23] that's what Jesus has done by his bride
[27:25] he had to put so much Luther so much
[27:28] Methodist and so much Presbyterian so
[27:30] much Pentecost in it oh what does it
[27:32] come out with his own reflection
[27:35] why is it it's like a pyramid message
[27:37] you see it's heaping out of this coming
[27:39] to the minority for The Headstone the
[27:41] ministry of Jesus Christ on Earth has to
[27:43] be the same as a Ministry yet or he
[27:45] can't come to it
[27:49] Pete's not the head but the head packs
[27:51] the feet they're in Mexico where to go
[27:54] you get it
[27:55] beautifully it's the light of the hour
[27:58] Wesley was a great light like he said to
[28:01] John the Baptist it was a great life for
[28:03] his hour yeah sure he was no yes sir
[28:07] they're clean Rags or the dirty rags of
[28:09] yesterday if you remain that way it's
[28:11] got the Elias become dirty rides all the
[28:13] time it served his purpose as clothing
[28:15] but nice to become paper
[28:18] justification service time and
[28:20] justification under Luther then it had
[28:21] to become sanctification to Wesley and
[28:23] save the cases served it's time to
[28:25] become the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[28:27] the baptism the Holy Ghost to serve his
[28:28] time until the Holy Spirit which is the
[28:31] only one God Blends into the Church of
[28:33] the church and the Christ that makes
[28:34] Jesus Christ reflected on the Earth
[28:37] but he promised you in the Bible
[28:39] why not believe it I can't make you do
[28:42] that I'm only responsible for the word
[28:43] amen that's right so you see it do you
[28:47] see that if you do it'll be like the the
[28:50] man one time went to do it went over to
[28:52] Wales during the time of the Welsh
[28:53] Revival a bunch of men with the United
[28:55] States so he goes down and they said
[28:57] they want to find out what building they
[28:59] was holding this Welsh regard but many
[29:00] of you remember the Welsh Revival great
[29:02] Revival broke out amongst the Welsh
[29:04] people
[29:05] and well so these men and these great
[29:07] big ministers and so forth went from the
[29:09] United States say doctors of divinity
[29:10] they want to go over to see what great
[29:12] thing they've done you know it's always
[29:13] walking down the street they said met a
[29:15] little old policeman standard O'Connor
[29:16] whoreless
[29:17] Club around you know and whistling uh
[29:19] him like that and said well he's just
[29:21] Switzerland to him we might go see him
[29:22] see what he's going to do well asked him
[29:24] a question so they went up to him and
[29:25] said sir Where is the
[29:29] Welsh Revival ad
[29:31] he tipped off his head he said sirs the
[29:33] Welsh Revival was held in here
[29:36] oh that's it he was a well
[29:40] oh God if we could only only son or say
[29:44] that we are the reflection of Jesus
[29:46] Christ
[29:51] where is the Welsh Revival held what
[29:54] building is it and he said sir it's in
[29:55] my heart
[29:58] that's right and today the church ought
[30:01] to be Jesus Christ yes and action upon
[30:04] the Earth because I live you live also
[30:06] and my life will be in you the works
[30:09] that I do you'll do also see the church
[30:11] has got to get to that pace to and he
[30:13] promised he would do it and it will just
[30:16] got to come that way so you see that's
[30:18] what takes place we we got to be that
[30:20] way he's alive so was Noah the light in
[30:24] his day he was alive
[30:27] nor was that line he was a light to what
[30:30] to make God's word I will destroy a man
[30:33] upon the Earth that I've created
[30:36] build an ark and all desires to come
[30:38] into it will be saved nor will tell
[30:41] there said he's one way and that's the
[30:43] art they said the old crazy fanatic he
[30:46] was the word made manifest
[30:49] Noah was a lot of the hour
[30:52] sure what his day his age he sprung
[30:56] forth to life Moses was a lot of his
[30:58] hour
[30:59] I'll surely visit you God said to
[31:02] Abraham now come down and I'll take out
[31:04] of but people with a strong hand I'll
[31:06] show my power in Egypt and when Moses up
[31:09] there met that Bernie Bush up there and
[31:11] found out the I am was in that Bush
[31:13] Moses went down there and he was the
[31:16] light
[31:18] amen no wonder he could take some dust
[31:20] and blow it up say Let There come fleas
[31:22] upon the Earth he had the word of God
[31:24] what happened the dust began to blow on
[31:26] the fleas began to come into existence
[31:30] he was a manifestation of the light of
[31:33] God's word
[31:36] he was a prophet what he said come to
[31:39] pass he was a light of that day he was
[31:42] God's life Pharaoh might have had
[31:44] everything he wanted to have the rest of
[31:46] and all the priests had what they wanted
[31:47] but Moses was the life why he was
[31:51] showing forth God's word manifesting God
[31:54] promised I'll bring him out under a
[31:56] strong hand and I'll get myself Glory
[31:59] that's what he was doing amen that's
[32:01] reason Moses proved that he could create
[32:03] not because he wanted to create because
[32:05] God told him amen God go to the
[32:07] congregation tomorrow the Lord God has
[32:09] just spoke to me take a handful of dust
[32:11] and throw it up in the sky I guess in
[32:13] the call for it there's none here but
[32:15] he'll be there
[32:17] amen all right oh I hope you're not
[32:20] asleep
[32:24] he said I'm sent God did say to our
[32:27] fathers surely he'd visit us down here
[32:29] take us out I've come to prove you that
[32:31] scars
[32:36] someone said well I believe Nathan said
[32:38] I don't think he's in any hurry we
[32:40] shouldn't be all excited about this and
[32:41] looked like it failed four or five times
[32:43] but just the same it moved off amen they
[32:45] thought that God said we stoned this
[32:47] Moses get him away from us we don't want
[32:48] him in our our group here what was this
[32:50] group not on anyhow because he was alive
[32:52] yeah he was alive while he had what was
[32:55] it God manifesting his promised word
[32:57] through Moses and Moses was the light
[33:01] Elijah was alive
[33:03] there sit on that Hill off command the
[33:05] Ravens to feed you amen yes sir you come
[33:08] back down with the saith the Lord
[33:11] not even dual fall from Heaven till I
[33:13] call foreign
[33:46] take care of him and everything they
[33:49] thought he was crazy but he's he was
[33:50] alive they say hey when I become that a
[33:53] Holy Roller Head around here you know
[33:54] what somebody was hunting it inside they
[33:56] see him setting up there way up on top
[33:58] of that mountain there I bet that old
[33:59] fella is about dried up at this time no
[34:01] no
[34:02] he was alive
[34:07] he was alive his day John when he came
[34:12] to the Earth
[34:13] went out in the wilderness to get his
[34:15] education from God not the Seminary
[34:17] he had to introduce the Messiah so when
[34:20] he come forth Jesus said he was a bright
[34:22] and shiny light yeah Hallelujah he was a
[34:26] word
[34:27] Manifesto
[34:30] Isaiah said so yeah that's it that's
[34:33] right
[34:34] it sent forth a voice in the wilderness
[34:36] crying saying prepare the way for the
[34:38] Lord and make straight his gate make
[34:40] straight away he'd cry one voice of one
[34:42] crying in the wilderness here he come
[34:43] forth what was he boys one crying in the
[34:45] wilderness what was he manifestation of
[34:47] the word light amen saying God the
[34:50] spoken Genesis and spoke this and here
[34:51] come the lie as he said let there be
[34:53] light for the sun the sun come in
[34:55] existence today so there will be a voice
[34:56] of one crying in the water should have
[34:57] come forth it was a light of the hour he
[35:00] also said in the last days
[35:15] [Applause]
[35:18] flee from the Wrath it is to come John
[35:20] said the same thing that actually laid
[35:22] to the root of the tree didn't even have
[35:24] an education didn't talk like even a
[35:25] preacher he talked about serpents and
[35:27] sticks and trees and axes and things
[35:29] what he's used to in the wilderness he
[35:31] wasn't raised up some of this great big
[35:32] fine stuff they have today in that day
[35:35] he'd come out with his own language he
[35:37] didn't stand say oh man and make all
[35:39] these fancy vows and come right out of
[35:41] the Wilderness
[35:43] don't you begin to think about that God
[35:47] disable these storms
[35:48] don't you think because your Methodist
[35:50] Baptist Presbyterians you have any hold
[35:52] on God God's able to take Bootleggers
[35:58] somebody's going to hear somebody's
[36:00] going to believe it he said almost is
[36:03] laid to the root of the tree every tree
[36:06] that don't believe it's You Down cast
[36:08] Into the Fire
[36:09] so that was his message he was alive
[36:10] today Jesus said he was a bright and
[36:13] Shining Light and you for a little while
[36:15] desired to walk into it and why did John
[36:17] say the prophet he's standing among you
[36:20] right now yeah I'm not worthy to lose
[36:22] his shoes and as soon as he comes on the
[36:24] scene I'm going off oh
[36:28] amen there's no two or three life so
[36:30] four or five different organizations it
[36:32] was one life that's not nothing is
[36:34] Baptist Lutheran Presbyterian Christ is
[36:38] and the word manifested is a light of
[36:41] the hour
[36:42] let there be light and there was life
[36:45] yes sir let there be light and there is
[36:48] light he spoke there would be light and
[36:49] this day and there is life
[36:53] he's coming I believe him amen look at
[36:56] the promises of this age oh man every
[37:00] light that's ever shine these Church
[37:02] ages we see how they it's been a pitfall
[37:05] sight you see rejected Revelation 3 I
[37:07] have wrote down here Revelation 3 and I
[37:09] know what I was referring to then look
[37:11] to the promise of this hour what we're
[37:13] living in a rejected light but they they
[37:16] rejected it back there what is living in
[37:19] a glare what are they doing today same
[37:20] thing yes well are you a Christian well
[37:23] I'm a loser I'm a Baptist I'm
[37:26] Presbyterian that don't mean one thing
[37:28] amen because I see you as the hog pig or
[37:30] anything else
[37:32] that's about how much it means no no
[37:34] disregards to you but if you're taking
[37:36] it to this fundamental part that's right
[37:38] yeah I asked the question a Christian
[37:41] that's Christ in you and if Christ is in
[37:45] you then the word is in you is that the
[37:48] word is in you when the light's shining
[37:49] and how are you going to walk out of it
[37:50] yeah
[37:53] that's the question that's what's in now
[37:56] the light the evening lights are shining
[37:59] the bride tree is blue oh remember they
[38:01] prune that old tree and what the canker
[38:03] worm left the Palm where I'm eating what
[38:05] the Palm worm left the caterpillar
[38:07] eating what the Methodist left the
[38:09] Baptist eating what the Badness left the
[38:11] Pentecostal eating he said this tree is
[38:13] a joy that was cut all down to his thumb
[38:15] but he won't know if it would live again
[38:16] oh yeah
[38:19] he reserved that tree yes sir apart was
[38:22] his bride and he said I will restore
[38:25] saith the Lord what is it I'll bring it
[38:29] forth all that the Lutheran eating the
[38:31] Westland eating and all them and I will
[38:33] restore it causes all still in the root
[38:34] of the tree see just laying down on the
[38:36] ground just like the sap that went out
[38:38] as he said about the sister it's laying
[38:40] there and the trumpet of God shall sound
[38:42] someday in them elected Lutheran
[38:43] Methodist Baptists that had nothing to
[38:45] do with any organization
[38:47] [Music]
[38:50] Moody never organized nothing it was
[38:52] that grouper Ricky's address
[38:56] John Smith organized nothing none of the
[38:59] rest of them organized it was the light
[39:01] of the hour Luther Wesley and other rest
[39:03] of them it was that group actors come by
[39:05] that made the organization yeah uh the
[39:07] Holy Ghost never organized nothing in
[39:09] Pentecost Pentecost is an experience not
[39:12] a denomination amen they never organized
[39:15] nothing oh no but the man who claimed to
[39:17] be Pentecost to organize it that's the
[39:19] husk and her dying instead of pressing
[39:21] into the paper to make the full image of
[39:23] Jesus Christ come forth no they pulled
[39:26] themselves out so there's nothing to do
[39:27] into it hey just let him alone but we
[39:30] find out this light this tree Christ
[39:32] rejected Again by the church why for the
[39:35] same cause that he did first this old
[39:37] false glares of Lights of other days and
[39:40] he's the same yesterday today and
[39:41] forever in Hebrews 13 8 says is and the
[39:45] same the day as he was in because he
[39:48] does the same thing that he did the same
[39:51] word that Christ listen is taking out
[39:54] let this be personal honorable I'm a
[39:56] little decide where turn it off now or
[39:58] not see for that tape I'll just let it
[40:00] stay there amen
[40:02] watch this hey man he is the same
[40:06] yesterday and forever watch his works
[40:08] that he did manifest itself now listen
[40:11] close when he stood there in John 14 12
[40:14] he said
[40:16] The Works that I do shall you do also
[40:20] greater than this shall you do for I go
[40:23] unto my father now he said it heavens
[40:27] and earth will pass away but that word
[40:29] will never fail now if we're at the last
[40:31] end of the age where is them Greater
[40:34] Works go together all right
[40:35] we're here we haven't got listen if the
[40:39] Roman Calendar is right we got six we
[40:42] got 36 years left
[40:44] every 2000 years the world meets your
[40:46] end first two thousand years were
[40:48] destroyed by water second two thousand
[40:50] years Christ come this is 19 and 64
[40:52] coming up 36 years now the Egyptian
[40:55] astronomy calendar says we're 17 years
[40:58] out it's 17 years Advanced from that
[41:00] that would leave 19 years later Jesus
[41:03] said the work will be cut short for the
[41:05] elected sake of being open to save
[41:07] where are we at the works that I do
[41:10] shall you also same kind but greater
[41:15] now watch listen folks get on here I
[41:19] pray that God will open your heart and
[41:20] your mind understanding so what you'll
[41:23] understand without saying it's too much
[41:24] here notice he said one day let's see
[41:27] some of the great work he done let's
[41:28] just stop for just a couple things let's
[41:30] think one time he said uh you feed him
[41:33] something to eat they said we have
[41:35] nothing so what have you got bring me
[41:37] what you've got
[41:38] and they said we have uh five barley
[41:41] Loaves and two fishes he said bring them
[41:43] to me and he took the original five
[41:47] barley laws and began to break the laws
[41:49] and from the original He Made bread it
[41:53] fed five thousand is that right that he
[41:56] said he got a fish hand me the fish it
[41:58] was a fish to begin with and he took off
[42:00] that fish and other fish and another
[42:02] fish and fed five dollars is that right
[42:05] but in the last days he had nothing
[42:26] it has to be fulfilled yeah I could tell
[42:30] you things that would shake you see it's
[42:32] there when he says it's there hey let
[42:34] him say it see just as I could see the
[42:37] East the Wester has come back and met
[42:39] the East it was Moses even picked up
[42:41] sand and said let there be fleas and so
[42:44] forth like that upon the Earth but in
[42:45] this last day he doesn't take anything
[42:48] see just the word
[42:53] on me yeah I want to testify of some of
[42:57] those things tonight amen but what's
[42:59] happened but you can see he's still God
[43:01] his words cannot these works that I do
[43:04] shall you also a greater than this shall
[43:06] you do I tuck a fish to make a fish you
[43:08] don't even have to have a fish
[43:10] he's still God is still the same son the
[43:13] same Son of God that took a fish off of
[43:15] a fish it's the same Son of God today
[43:17] these these works that I do shall you
[43:19] also even greater than this will you do
[43:21] it'll be magnified greater than this
[43:24] shall you do and people refuse to sit
[43:30] Greater Works a false lighter you know
[43:34] what I was just thinking of something I
[43:36] was referred a lot about England but I
[43:38] was thinking about a false light you're
[43:39] not long ago you all remember that
[43:41] greatest robbery that that England ever
[43:42] had yeah that was done it's a seven
[43:45] million dollar holder I don't think
[43:46] there's ever been anything in the world
[43:47] to compare with it a great hold up
[43:49] reasonably of seven million dollars even
[43:52] Scotland yards can't get it figured out
[43:54] you know higher than it by a false light
[43:57] they put a light on the railroad track
[43:58] caution on down so they come to a red
[44:01] light and stop them and they're the
[44:03] robbery taking place just at the right
[44:05] place a false light gave the greatest
[44:07] robbery that the Nations has ever known
[44:09] it robbed the nations of the greatest
[44:12] holdup greatest robbery it was done by a
[44:16] false light and the greatest robbery the
[44:18] Church of God has ever had is a false
[44:19] fight amen
[44:22] Rob them from the power of the Holy
[44:25] Ghost it's cut from the church the very
[44:26] Lifeline amen amen it's robbed them of
[44:29] the word when they accepted a Creed
[44:31] instead of the word it's Robin all they
[44:33] claim to have the word
[44:35] the word lives itself out for the age it
[44:37] makes itself known they claim they had
[44:39] the word too back there in the days of
[44:41] Jesus but he said they saw a great light
[44:43] and they rejected it yes they saw it but
[44:46] rejected it whole false light this has
[44:49] cost the church the greatest robbery had
[44:50] ever had cold and nominational Creeds
[44:53] brother won't write him a Vindicated
[44:55] word
[44:56] no green amen the Bible said Jesus said
[45:00] the word of God is a a seed that is sore
[45:03] so see and coal Creeds won't ripen that
[45:07] word
[45:08] no no cold blizzardy dates won't write
[45:12] in the week no one is it takes the
[45:14] warmth of the sunlight because it was
[45:17] God's spoken word to do such a thing
[45:19] with you know take the word spoken of
[45:21] God today to show the saints of God that
[45:23] Jesus Christ lives that's the same as he
[45:25] was yesterday he is today Creeds and
[45:28] denominations will never do it they're
[45:29] cold and indifference of green or rot
[45:31] right in the ground it can't come forth
[45:33] under that that's reasonable the day we
[45:36] have a what we do like our precious
[45:38] brother Billy Graham the great
[45:40] revivalist I think God is using the man
[45:42] but look what he does goes out there
[45:43] amongst them Baptists and prayers but
[45:44] during what I do get a bunch of church
[45:46] joiners see where the southern baptist
[45:48] is crawling down there because they had
[45:49] the most denominations uh where the
[45:51] nomination grow more than any other
[45:52] Protestants the Catholics took them all
[45:54] in early last year is it in favor he
[45:56] sure it is yeah don't worry it's going
[45:57] to take them all because it takes
[45:58] Badness and all right together and
[46:00] they're all the one and don't know amen
[46:03] the castle Council of churches put some
[46:05] all of this the same thing amen
[46:06] denomination but why why would you want
[46:08] to stay over here over here as long as
[46:10] you're rejected this what difference
[46:11] does it make unless you're using the
[46:13] same denominational tags just the same
[46:14] as you are one way one of the beasts and
[46:16] the other in the March so there you are
[46:17] this doesn't make any difference it's
[46:19] where he's been he stunk this seal of
[46:21] approval in there you take it yeah and
[46:23] there she all LED right straight to the
[46:24] White House into Washington DC and in
[46:27] the Council of churches and there you go
[46:28] encouragement taking the right all back
[46:30] exactly what the Bible said they do
[46:34] wish I that dude didn't go so fast
[46:37] just think now we're at look at the
[46:40] promises for the day reject it again how
[46:43] the churches have done in this last day
[46:45] the denomination
[46:47] Claire living in the false glare is the
[46:49] reason that it won't write that's the
[46:51] reason this word you don't see the
[46:52] Miracles a priest interviewed me not
[46:55] long ago and he said Mr Branham he said
[46:57] how'd you baptize a certain girl that
[47:00] come out of this church that backslid
[47:01] and married a Catholic boy and went into
[47:03] the Catholic church and he was going to
[47:05] take her into the church I said I'll
[47:06] baptize your Christian baptism
[47:09] he said uh the bishop wants to know I
[47:11] said all right there it is said you
[47:12] swear to this I don't swear at all and
[47:14] he said he said if he can't take my word
[47:16] part well that's all right because I
[47:18] don't swear the Bible said don't swear
[47:19] by Heavens as God's Throne Earth this is
[47:21] what's through let your yes be yes no no
[47:23] I said you have to take the word first
[47:24] well you you said Christian baptism what
[47:27] do you mean by by Mercy I said it's the
[47:28] only way Christian baptism is performed
[47:30] I said I baptize her in the Ohio River
[47:33] tuck her under the water in the name of
[47:35] Jesus Christ and brought her up I
[47:36] baptized her in the name of the Lord
[47:38] Jesus Christ which is the only Christian
[47:39] baptism there is amen So Yesterday put
[47:42] it down like that he said strange said
[47:44] you know the Catholic Church used to
[47:45] baptize that last of win
[47:47] and he said I'm going to hit the
[47:50] discussion went on for a while and he
[47:51] said well we are the original Catholic
[47:53] knowing they're laid right there the the
[47:55] books and all the history on it I said
[47:57] that's true but I said why don't you do
[47:58] it today amen amen amen he said we have
[48:02] power to remit sins
[48:04] said Jesus did he tell his disciples
[48:06] whosoever sins you were admitted to them
[48:07] they're remitted whosoever sends you
[48:09] retain to them to retain I said yes or
[48:11] he did he said then don't they give the
[48:12] church The Authority Peter was the head
[48:14] of the church I said if the church WIll
[48:16] remit sins the way Peter did it I said
[48:18] now when he asked what must we do to be
[48:20] saved he said repent every one of you
[48:22] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[48:24] Christ for the remissioner
[48:28] I said you're trying to plead a Bible
[48:29] that's the word he said God's in his
[48:31] church I said God's in his word amen
[48:33] every man of the man's words alive this
[48:36] is the truth so there's no agency but
[48:38] there they go right on in darkness and
[48:40] the Protestants by the thousands falling
[48:42] into it here they are right down to
[48:43] adopting their Creeds and things going
[48:45] right on within the word coming right up
[48:47] proven Jesus Christ manifest himself
[48:49] same yesterday if ever and that Creed
[48:51] glare they moved right on out into
[48:53] darkness amen just like they did in
[48:55] those time just like they did at all
[48:57] times they do it again today right out
[48:59] in darkness why they reject the light
[49:01] because the Creed has blinded them oh
[49:04] what a darkened hour that we are in now
[49:08] yeah they reject Christ through eternal
[49:11] life and that's what does it cold in
[49:13] nominations can never bring life to the
[49:15] word of God because it brings life to
[49:17] the denomination we've got more
[49:20] professed Christians right now look here
[49:21] if the Christian I asked this Priestess
[49:24] if I'll go with you that the Catholic
[49:27] church was at the beginning at Pentecost
[49:29] because not at now I see a room that's
[49:32] right the church never did begin it now
[49:34] I see a Rome amen it began at Pentecost
[49:36] you see at Jerusalem is where the church
[49:38] began but I said here I'll admit that
[49:40] these people them slaves and things that
[49:42] got the Holy Ghost they Master seen
[49:44] their powers and things what they were
[49:45] doing raising the dead speaking in
[49:47] tongues casting out Devils foretelling
[49:49] things and Prophets among them and so
[49:50] forth come out with sheepskins around
[49:52] them eat nerves come to that Nastia
[49:54] Council and so forth a great man and
[49:56] there they come out of there and come up
[49:58] there to let Nastia Castle was standing
[50:00] for that word yeah but that Bloody 15
[50:02] days they accepted father Son and Holy
[50:05] Ghost as a Creed instead of the Bible
[50:06] Doctrine in the name of Jesus Christ
[50:07] through that come all the Protestant
[50:09] church is born right into it the same
[50:10] thing all these other things a false
[50:12] conception of the Holy Ghost they took
[50:14] take the communion drink the wine that
[50:15] is the Holy Eucharist which means holy
[50:17] ghost the priest gives it to you now the
[50:19] Bible don't read on the day of Pentecost
[50:21] and fully come here come a priest up the
[50:23] road caller turned around said they got
[50:24] your tongue and take the Holy Eucharist

[50:42] to speak with other tongues as the
[50:43] spirit gave them utterance in there out
[50:45] into the street they went staggering
[50:47] like drunk man marrying all the rest of
[50:49] them are the impact of the Holy Ghost

[52:46] this tape's going on in there they're
[52:49] more darkest than we are I made the
[52:51] statement that why the churches in this
[52:54] glare is so deceiving
[52:57] it looks like it's the truth now didn't
[52:59] Jesus say uh that's me Matthew 24.
[53:04] Matthew 24 Jesus said that in the last
[53:07] days the two spirits will be so close
[53:11] till it were to see the very elected
[53:14] if it was possible
[53:16] there would be an elected group come out
[53:19] to make the church in the last days and
[53:21] these organizations with what they call
[53:23] their truth would be so close like the
[53:25] real thing
[53:26] that it would deceive the very elected
[53:28] even Pentecostals now you know you ain't
[53:32] gonna take a Pentecost and deceiving
[53:33] with some Methodist or Baptist Doctrine
[53:35] you ain't gonna tell him that he knows
[53:37] better you go to see some bad just for
[53:39] the Lutheran Doctrine either I think and
[53:42] neither you go to receive the message
[53:43] they see a message not in this word for
[53:45] some Pentecostal amen all father son
[53:48] Holy Ghost and all this stuff like that
[53:49] back there them Creeds that they have
[53:51] that organization set up and go into
[53:53] eating you'll never deceive them because
[53:55] the elected won't be deceived that's
[53:58] right
[53:59] what is it what is it deceiving these
[54:02] glares what are they doing they're
[54:03] leading the church to the council
[54:07] Slaughter by their glare that will be
[54:11] the final Slaughter once her in Rome

[1:05:07] stuff you get right into Christ right
[1:05:08] now the word yes sir vindicates the word
[1:05:12] and shows that it is the light of the
[1:05:14] hour that's how we know he is alive
[1:05:16] because he is the light manifest himself
[1:05:18] in flesh how do we know he was God's
[1:05:21] word made flesh see God's word was
[1:05:25] showing itself vindicating himself when
[1:05:27] the Messiah cometh what he'll do the
[1:05:29] woman said the Well when the Messiah
[1:05:30] cometh he'll do these things you must be
[1:05:32] the prophet which is the word
[1:05:33] foretelling to see things he said I am
[1:05:36] he yeah
[1:05:38] that's enough the light shine on the
[1:05:40] promised word there's a light right in
[1:05:42] the city she went and said come see a
[1:05:43] man who told me the things I've done
[1:05:44] isn't this a very Messiah yeah that was
[1:05:47] it no matter what the other said she
[1:05:50] knew that was Messiah remember in every
[1:05:53] age and time of Darkness God has always
[1:05:56] had his word to divide the light from
[1:06:00] the dark he had to the days of Luther
[1:06:02] when the Catholic church had everything
[1:06:04] he sent Luther as a Shining Light
[1:06:07] and Luther divided truth from darkness
[1:06:10] and when the lutherans got twisted up he
[1:06:13] made of John Wesley and he divided light
[1:06:17] from darkness in the days of Pentecost
[1:06:19] when the West End got all and the
[1:06:21] methodists got all gummed up in the
[1:06:23] Baptist and Presbyterian he sent the
[1:06:25] Pentecostal message to separate life
[1:06:26] from Darkness the Pentecost went right
[1:06:29] back out into the darkness again like
[1:06:30] that in their organization tucked their
[1:06:32] Creeds and things now The Hours come for
[1:06:34] this word to be Vindicated he sends a
[1:06:37] light the word made manifest like he did
[1:06:39] in the beginning sends the word and it
[1:06:42] proves itself there is light and he
[1:06:45] always separates the same is now as
[1:06:48] Eternal lights in the beginning looking
[1:06:50] children as I say I'm five minutes past
[1:06:52] time now let me say this one thing there

[1:07:30] traditional death and all them kinds of
[1:07:32] death and they have seen a great light

[1:07:37] same one who said in the beginning let
[1:07:38] there be like
[1:07:40] that same God yesterday the day and
[1:07:45] forever he's present today right here

[1:10:58] was born
[1:10:59] he was a word he was a messiah
[1:11:03] he was the Vindicated word so then the
[1:11:06] word God spoke to the the end from the
[1:11:10] beginning now there's a word for this
[1:11:12] day yeah and he's here amen vindicating
[1:11:16] that word in the midst of confusion

[1:16:16] Gospel people as we live it Lord day by
[1:16:19] day reflecting to them the life of Jesus

[1:16:47] be the testimony of the desire of every
[1:16:49] heart in your fathers we sing these
[1:16:51] hymns David sung the hymns they become
[1:16:54] prophecy they were prophecy and you
[1:16:58] recognize that prophecy As we sing it
[1:17:00] Lord let it be in our hearts too as we
[1:17:02] sing we'll walk in this life Let It Be
[1:17:04] Lord this is a beautiful life it's the
[1:17:07] word it's Christ living among us not
[1:17:09] what he was what he is and we know what
[1:17:12] he was only reflected what he is and we
[1:17:15] pray father that the people understand
[1:17:17] and walk in this beautiful light we
[1:17:20] asked in Jesus name while we remain
[1:17:22] standing just a moment I want us to all
[1:17:24] saying now in here there's Presbyterian
[1:17:27] Methodist Catholic this is a mixed up
[1:17:29] audience when it comes to denominational
[1:17:30] now remember let it be known that I'm
[1:17:34] speaking in us and against the people in
[1:17:36] these glares but I proved it to the
[1:17:38] Bible that they are glares amen if it
[1:17:40] wasn't Christ would be doing like he
[1:17:43] promised to do with them amen but they
[1:17:45] refuse that see and when you get there
[1:17:47] what do you find adjourn the church
[1:17:50] recite a Creed and what does it cannot
[1:17:52] come to the end of the road you find out
[1:17:55] is a false Mirage Christ is the word
[1:18:00] live now while you can live you live for
[1:18:03] something what are you living for so he
[1:18:04] can die
[1:18:05] every one of you what are you working
[1:18:07] for to eat what are you eating for to
[1:18:09] live what are you living for to die
[1:18:11] so why not live to live
[1:18:14] why not live to live then the only way
[1:18:17] you can live is accept the word because
[1:18:19] man should not live by bread alone what
[1:18:21] we make out here with a sweater of a
[1:18:23] brown but by every word that comes from
[1:18:26] the mouth of God now the word of the
[1:18:28] mouth of God is being Vindicated right
[1:18:29] here before by the Holy Spirit live by
[1:18:32] it won't you now I want while we sing
[1:18:34] this again that's just each one you

[1:18:41] walk in the light will you pray for each
[1:18:43] other as you put your hands together
[1:18:44] while we sing together with closing our
[1:18:47] eyes as far as possible
[1:18:49] [Applause]
[1:18:52] [Music]
[1:19:04] hello
[1:19:10] who is it Jesus
[1:19:14] now let's raise your hands
[1:19:17] [Applause]
[1:19:22] [Music]
[1:19:37] foreign
[1:19:38] [Music]
[1:19:44] [Music]
[1:20:03] [Music]
[1:20:09] [Music]
[1:20:11] along here
[1:20:17] [Music]
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:36] with our heads bound now remember when
[1:20:40] Israel was in their Journey Eating new
[1:20:42] Mana every day they walked in the light
[1:20:46] of a pillar of fox yes that Pillar of
[1:20:49] Fire was Jesus Christ the Bible says it
[1:20:52] was and today he is with us we have it
[1:20:55] we know he's with us the same Pillar of
[1:20:59] Fire doing the same things that he did
[1:21:01] when he was sure on Earth to fulfill his
[1:21:03] word as we go from here let's remember
[1:21:05] keep that song in our hearts if we go to
[1:21:08] our homes as the wheels hum a song
[1:21:10] before you eat your dinner bow your head
[1:21:13] and thank God for sending forth light to
[1:21:17] bring food upon the Earth or your
[1:21:19] physical body then thank God for sending
[1:21:22] spiritual light his word that he might
[1:21:25] give food to the soul or a man shall not
[1:21:27] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:21:30] that proceeds mouth of God keep saying
[1:21:33] in this hymn to yourselves in your home
[1:21:35] among your people and meet us back here
[1:21:37] about 6 30 tonight for the prayer cards
[1:21:40] and so forth we'll see you then until
[1:21:41] then bow your heads and go to ask
[1:21:43] brother Neville if you walk up here now
[1:21:45] the pastor and dismisses the Lord of
[1:21:47] Prayer
[1:21:50] amen
[1:21:52] oh I keep wanting to stop the tape and
[1:21:54] make comments you know every every few
[1:21:56] sentences there's golden nuggets there's
[1:21:59] so many things we could go into and talk
[1:22:01] about but praise God how many are glad
[1:22:04] that he's here
[1:22:06] and that we can walk in the light and
[1:22:09] that the light separates Darkness from
[1:22:11] light and it pushes the darkness away
[1:22:15] amen
[1:22:17] let's go to page 33.
[1:22:21] in our book where we started from
[1:22:26] the first question that we asked was how
[1:22:28] do we bring forth the reflection of
[1:22:31] Jesus Christ
[1:22:33] and brother Branham says in paragraph
[1:22:36] 181
[1:22:37] he starts talking about the Queen of
[1:22:39] England that visited the paper mill and
[1:22:41] she saw the dirty rags and couldn't
[1:22:43] believe that the paper was made out of
[1:22:45] the dirty rags and so they after she
[1:22:47] left he's just talking about this
[1:22:49] through there and I'll go down to
[1:22:51] paragraph 182 so after she was gone the
[1:22:54] man took the same dirty pile of rags and
[1:22:56] run them through a certain process and
[1:22:57] brought them out clean pure paper and
[1:23:00] you know had been went through a process
[1:23:02] and made Rio and put her profile in it
[1:23:04] and sent it to reflecting herself and
[1:23:07] what she called dirty rags now that's
[1:23:10] what it is the dead things of yesterday
[1:23:12] the message of Luther the message of
[1:23:13] Wesley the message of Pentecost if it
[1:23:16] can only go through the process of God's
[1:23:18] Holy Spirit and the word of a
[1:23:20] Vindication it'll bring forth the
[1:23:22] reflection of Jesus Christ the King amen
[1:23:25] but if you leave it lay it's dirty rags
[1:23:27] now where brother Benham started this
[1:23:30] thought is up here in paragraph 180 so I
[1:23:32] want to go up and catch it and then come
[1:23:33] back down just above paragraph 187 says
[1:23:38] you say then why was it good yesterday
[1:23:39] he's talking about previous ages talking
[1:23:42] about Luther's age and Wesley's age why
[1:23:44] was it good yesterday if you only knew
[1:23:46] that the very little Hall that was on
[1:23:48] the wheat at the beginning if it abides
[1:23:50] in the grain it makes the grain further
[1:23:52] that's the very thing that makes the
[1:23:54] wheat flour is what was yesterday but if
[1:23:56] it separates itself from the Grain and
[1:23:58] it don't mature then it goes away but if
[1:24:01] it goes through the process of
[1:24:03] life-giving process as it dies out and
[1:24:05] just Blends into something else and
[1:24:07] makes the grain if it isn't where does
[1:24:09] it come from amen so he's talking about
[1:24:11] what was what was uh Hall one day has to
[1:24:15] become grain it's got to keep moving as
[1:24:17] the life matures and as it moves it goes
[1:24:19] through the process
[1:24:21] but anywhere it stops and remains back
[1:24:23] here in the plant and doesn't move on
[1:24:25] with the life then it dies
[1:24:28] so then he comes down to the dirty rags
[1:24:30] amen and he says it with clothing and
[1:24:32] one day amen but when it didn't move on
[1:24:34] it became dirty rag but if it'll go
[1:24:36] through the process of the word amen and
[1:24:38] to be purified and then God will use it
[1:24:40] so let's go down to paragraph 184.
[1:24:44] it's got to be molded in something else
[1:24:45] Luther has got to be molded into Wesley
[1:24:48] and Wesley has got to be molded in the
[1:24:50] Pentecost and Pentecost has got to be
[1:24:52] molded into Christ
[1:24:54] it goes through a process so has the
[1:24:56] gospel gone through a process
[1:24:58] it's processing Luther's age of
[1:25:01] justification we believe that Wesley of
[1:25:03] sanctification we believe that the
[1:25:05] Pentecostals of the restoration the
[1:25:06] gifts for the Holy Ghost we believe that
[1:25:08] certainly but mold it all together what
[1:25:11] you come out with Jesus right the same
[1:25:13] yesterday today and forever it'll come
[1:25:15] out with Jesus when a man is in a
[1:25:18] Foundry it is making a bell he's got a
[1:25:21] certain tone he has to put in it then he
[1:25:23] is setting his mold and pouring his iron
[1:25:25] he puts in so much brass so much steel
[1:25:27] so much copper he knows just exactly how
[1:25:30] much to put in to make it give at that
[1:25:33] right tone and that's what Jesus has
[1:25:35] done by his bride he had put so much
[1:25:37] Luther so much Methodist so much
[1:25:39] Presbyterian so much Pentecost in it but
[1:25:42] what does he come out with his own
[1:25:44] reflection
[1:25:45] so all the truth that was there has to
[1:25:47] move to the next and mold into the next
[1:25:49] and then accumulates all the truth now
[1:25:52] of all seven Church ages amen and brings
[1:25:54] out of the glory of church and what does
[1:25:55] the church become the reflection of
[1:25:57] Jesus Christ as it goes to the process
[1:26:00] he goes on to say what is it just like
[1:26:02] the pyramid message you see it's heaping
[1:26:04] right up this coming to the minority
[1:26:07] with the headstone the ministry of Jesus
[1:26:09] Christ on Earth has to be the same as
[1:26:11] the ministry he had or he can't come to
[1:26:13] it
[1:26:14] praise God let's go down to paragraph uh
[1:26:18] 189 actually on the next page paragraph
[1:26:20] 189.
[1:26:21] I'm going to go to the second sentence
[1:26:23] oh God if we can only understand that we
[1:26:27] are the reflection of Jesus Christ his
[1:26:29] word may manifest you are the reflection
[1:26:31] of his word
[1:26:33] so what did all the church Ages come for
[1:26:35] and one growing into the next it came to
[1:26:38] make you the reflection of Jesus Christ
[1:26:42] a point
[1:26:43] let's look at uh
[1:26:45] let's back up I skipped one let's back
[1:26:47] up to paragraph 187 on the previous page
[1:26:50] now yes sir the clean rides are the
[1:26:53] dirty rags of yesterday if you remain
[1:26:55] that way it'll just become dirty rags
[1:26:57] all the time it served its purpose as
[1:26:59] clothing but now it's become paper
[1:27:01] justification served his time in
[1:27:03] justification under Luther then it had
[1:27:06] to become sanctification through
[1:27:07] Wesleyan sanctification served his time
[1:27:09] till it become the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:11] Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:13] served his time until the Holy Spirit
[1:27:15] which there's only one God Blends into
[1:27:17] the church and the church into Christ it
[1:27:20] makes Jesus Christ reflected on Earth
[1:27:22] what he promised here in the Bible
[1:27:24] what the whole process of the church
[1:27:26] Ages was for is to get the reflection of
[1:27:29] Jesus Christ in human flesh
[1:27:32] why human flesh
[1:27:34] ours
[1:27:37] praise God
[1:27:40] all right let's go to question number
[1:27:42] two what caused the greatest robbery the
[1:27:46] Church of God had
[1:27:47] paragraph 225
[1:27:51] over here in page
[1:27:53] 41.
[1:27:56] paragraph 225 in the middle page 41.
[1:28:02] and the greatest robbery the Church of
[1:28:03] God has ever had is a false light a
[1:28:06] glare their denomination it's robbed
[1:28:08] them from the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:10] it's took from the church the very
[1:28:11] Lifeline it's robbed them of the word
[1:28:13] when they accepted a Creed instead of
[1:28:15] the word it's robbed them oh they claim
[1:28:18] to have the word the word living lives
[1:28:20] itself out for the age it makes itself
[1:28:22] known they claim they have the word too
[1:28:24] back there in the days of Jesus but it
[1:28:26] said they saw a great light and they
[1:28:28] rejected it they saw it but they
[1:28:30] rejected him oh false light yes it cost
[1:28:34] the church the greatest robbery it ever
[1:28:36] had cold denominational Creed's brother
[1:28:38] won't ripen a Vindicated word a grain
[1:28:41] amen it takes the word for the day
[1:28:45] this I thought was interesting this next
[1:28:47] question question three how does the
[1:28:49] church remit sins
[1:28:51] let's go to the next page page 43
[1:28:54] paragraph 236.
[1:28:58] I'm going to go to the second sentence
[1:29:02] he said we have power to remit sins he's
[1:29:04] talking to the Catholic priest we have
[1:29:05] power to emit sins that Jesus didn't he
[1:29:08] didn't he tell his disciples whomsoever
[1:29:10] sins you remit to them they're remitted
[1:29:12] and whomsoever sins you retain to them
[1:29:14] they are retained I said yes sir he did
[1:29:16] he said then don't that give the church
[1:29:18] The Authority Peter was the head of the
[1:29:20] church I said if the church WIll remit
[1:29:22] sends the way Peter did it I said now
[1:29:24] when they asked what must we do to be
[1:29:26] saved he said repent every one of you
[1:29:28] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:29:29] Christ from Mission your sins and you do
[1:29:32] that and I'll go with you so they said
[1:29:34] doesn't the church have the power to
[1:29:35] remit sins and they're talking about
[1:29:36] Catholic priests resolving people's sins
[1:29:38] amen and he says if you'll do it the way
[1:29:40] Peter did and how did Peter did he gave
[1:29:43] them the revelation of the word for
[1:29:45] their hour and when they submitted to it
[1:29:46] their sins were remitted
[1:29:50] he said now the church has the power to
[1:29:52] remit sins but not because she says your
[1:29:55] sins are gone she has the power of His
[1:29:57] sins because she has the present truth
[1:29:59] which is Jesus Christ she has the blood
[1:30:01] which is the spirit
[1:30:03] amen and when that's accepted and
[1:30:05] received it'll remit sins
[1:30:08] it's the word it's the word the present
[1:30:10] day word but look here he goes on to say
[1:30:13] oh he said you're trying to plead a
[1:30:15] Bible I said that's the word he said God
[1:30:18] is in his church I said God is in his
[1:30:21] word
[1:30:22] every man other man's word is a lie his
[1:30:25] word is truth this is really important
[1:30:28] because it goes right back to the
[1:30:30] question I asked what guided them to the
[1:30:32] light it was the word
[1:30:34] and and this is a a interesting dialogue
[1:30:38] that brother Benham is having with a
[1:30:40] Catholic priest because the Catholic
[1:30:42] said oh God is in his church and we know
[1:30:44] that's also true
[1:30:46] is that true God is in his church amen
[1:30:49] and they're taking a promise to the
[1:30:51] bride upon themselves falsely so
[1:30:54] but that's a promise to the bride of
[1:30:56] Christ a true church that God is in his
[1:30:58] church amen but what they did with that
[1:31:01] Revelation is they made themselves the
[1:31:04] authority of the word and they gave
[1:31:06] themselves the right to adjust it or
[1:31:08] change it
[1:31:09] so they took a true Revelation and by a
[1:31:12] true Revelation misappropriated amen
[1:31:15] they lost the guide to the word and they
[1:31:18] became their own guide and could no
[1:31:20] longer find the word
[1:31:22] and why this is so important is because
[1:31:24] the truth and error are so close they
[1:31:27] travel on such close lines amen now if
[1:31:30] we do the same thing the Catholic Church
[1:31:31] says and say we are the bride we are the
[1:31:34] word and we start interpreting our own
[1:31:36] word
[1:31:37] we'll do the same exact thing the
[1:31:39] Catholic Church did but this word amen
[1:31:42] that's been revealed to us through a
[1:31:44] prophetic ministry will guide us to the
[1:31:46] light every time we can never become our
[1:31:49] own guide
[1:31:51] and to me that's that's where I believe
[1:31:54] the bride must stay on that Razor's Edge
[1:31:57] where she is the word for the day amen
[1:31:59] she she is the Tabernacle of deity
[1:32:02] absolutely she's the manifestation of
[1:32:04] the word for this day amen but she can
[1:32:07] never become her own interpreter of the
[1:32:10] word amen there's already been the
[1:32:13] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:32:14] Vindication through a prophetic Ministry
[1:32:16] to bring us back to the truth of the
[1:32:18] Bible amen and that's why it's so
[1:32:20] important we don't start coming up with
[1:32:23] our own Revelations
[1:32:25] amen it's a Catholic spirit
[1:32:29] and it's dangerous to keep saying we're
[1:32:31] the bride we're the bride we're the
[1:32:32] bride amen God gave us one thing to
[1:32:36] check everything with and that's his
[1:32:37] Bible
[1:32:39] amen and we don't take our own
[1:32:41] interpretation we take the
[1:32:42] interpretation that's been given to us
[1:32:44] in this day
[1:32:45] this ministry
[1:32:47] praise God but then if we get so
[1:32:49] self-confident that as if as if
[1:32:52] everybody in the bride agrees on
[1:32:54] something will be right that doesn't
[1:32:56] make it right because you don't know
[1:32:57] that everybody around you's bride
[1:33:01] praise God we have to stick with the
[1:33:03] word
[1:33:05] so I think this is so super important
[1:33:07] the day that we live in Deception comes
[1:33:09] in many ways but it always comes close
[1:33:11] to the truth
[1:33:14] we have to stick with the word that's
[1:33:15] been revealed
[1:33:17] in our day
[1:33:21] let's go to question number four
[1:33:22] question number four is who is the chief
[1:33:24] mechanic
[1:33:26] and I also want to add and the designer
[1:33:28] of the word
[1:33:30] and the man who can turn on the light
[1:33:33] let's go to paragraph 255
[1:33:38] 255
[1:33:40] on the top of page 47.
[1:33:45] in the paragraph 255 brother Brown
[1:33:47] starts talking about the man who
[1:33:49] Minister said trying to get his car
[1:33:51] fixed in Florida and the mechanic
[1:33:53] couldn't do it and then A well-dressed
[1:33:55] man walks up to him and he's we got this
[1:33:57] at the bottom of paragraph 255. finally
[1:33:59] a nice Dressed Man stepped up he said
[1:34:01] may I give you some advice the little
[1:34:03] mechanic had a sense enough to say yes
[1:34:05] sir
[1:34:06] he said you take this times this and
[1:34:08] this and he said put that together once
[1:34:10] and try it and he took this times that
[1:34:12] and put it together and there she went
[1:34:15] the little mechanic turned around and
[1:34:17] said say who are you he was the engineer
[1:34:19] General Motors chief engineer he made
[1:34:22] the thing he was the one who designed it
[1:34:24] and today when we're talking about
[1:34:26] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian the chief
[1:34:29] mechanic is here the designer of the
[1:34:31] word the man who created the heavens and
[1:34:34] earth and designed his church
[1:34:36] listen we don't need the nomination amen
[1:34:39] the chief engineer is here the designer
[1:34:42] of the word the designer of his church
[1:34:43] he's here and he says does he know more
[1:34:46] about what it takes for the Rapture or
[1:34:48] does the Methodist or Baptist which know
[1:34:50] more about what it takes he is the
[1:34:52] designer he knows what it takes he is
[1:34:55] well dressed in the power of his
[1:34:57] resurrection
[1:34:59] Hallelujah he is walking among us today
[1:35:02] in the power of his resurrection
[1:35:05] oh when brother bam he talks about the
[1:35:07] well-dressed man has stepped up there's
[1:35:09] another well-dressed man who stepped up
[1:35:11] he's not here in flesh he's robed in the
[1:35:14] power of his resurrection amen showing
[1:35:16] that he is alive today doing the same
[1:35:19] thing he did then that's the robe of his
[1:35:21] resurrection power it's the Messianic
[1:35:23] sign that was on display it's the one
[1:35:25] who can open the seals amen he's in the
[1:35:27] power he's dressed in the power of his
[1:35:29] resurrection
[1:35:30] so how are you going to see Jesus Christ
[1:35:32] he's well dressed and the power of his
[1:35:35] resurrection
[1:35:38] he's walking among us today and the
[1:35:41] power of his resurrection
[1:35:42] he knows what it takes to put a church
[1:35:44] in Rapture order he designed it and put
[1:35:47] the parts together here in the Bible and
[1:35:49] just let the current flow through it now
[1:35:51] watch it operate let faith in his
[1:35:53] promised word of today flow through
[1:35:54] you'll see how it operates why he
[1:35:57] designed the thing he designed his
[1:35:58] church by the word that's what he puts
[1:36:01] together not by Methodist or Baptist or
[1:36:03] Presbyterian or Pentecostal organization
[1:36:05] but by his word man shall live not by
[1:36:08] bread alone but by every word that
[1:36:10] proceeds out of the mouth of God oh
[1:36:13] praise God
[1:36:15] let's look at paragraph 265.
[1:36:21] the bottom of page 48.
[1:36:24] brother Brandon begins to talk about the
[1:36:26] caves in Carlsbad Caverns and a family
[1:36:28] went down and he's going to get into the
[1:36:29] little boy and little girl at the top of
[1:36:31] page 49 we'll pick it up there and there

[1:36:35] began screaming oh screaming she was

[1:36:48] darkness and that's about the way it is

[1:38:33] paragraph 278
[1:38:39] on page 51 paragraph 278 look children

[1:38:44] but let me say this one thing there is a
[1:38:47] man present don't get scared no matter
[1:38:49] what they say I've seen it come to the

[1:38:52] next but he's always present the never
[1:38:55] failing presence he's always there he
[1:38:57] can turn on the light

[1:39:04] switch anytime he wants to
[1:39:06] what a lesson amen our little brother
[1:39:09] the prophet of the age told us don't be
[1:39:12] scared because there's a man here which
[1:39:14] is Christ Jesus who can turn on the
[1:39:17] light
[1:39:18] he's just wanting to see what you're
[1:39:20] going to do
[1:39:23] he can flip the switch anytime he wants
[1:39:25] to yes sir there is a man here that can
[1:39:27] turn on the lights
[1:39:29] those who sat in the regions of the
[1:39:31] shadow of death some of them under
[1:39:33] cancer some of them under death a
[1:39:34] denomination some of them undercreased
[1:39:36] now he's back in Matthew chapter four
[1:39:38] his opening scripture some of them under
[1:39:40] Creed's death some of them under
[1:39:41] traditional death and all kinds of death
[1:39:44] and they have seen a great line the man
[1:39:46] that flashed the lights then is the same
[1:39:48] one who said in the beginning let there
[1:39:50] be light the same God yesterday today
[1:39:52] and forever he is present today right
[1:39:55] here now don't get scared he can turn on
[1:39:58] the lights
[1:40:01] did that chief engineer leave when the
[1:40:03] prophet left
[1:40:05] no but there's still a man here
[1:40:08] that can turn on the lights
[1:40:10] praise God there's nothing to be afraid
[1:40:12] of
[1:40:13] question number five
[1:40:16] how does he turn on the light let's go
[1:40:19] back to paragraph 267.
[1:40:25] paragraph 267.
[1:40:29] on page 49 I'm going to start in the
[1:40:31] middle of that paragraph don't fear
[1:40:34] little sister there is a man here who
[1:40:35] can turn on the light he can make this
[1:40:37] word live we don't know how he's coming
[1:40:39] we don't know how when he's coming I
[1:40:42] don't know nothing about that but he is
[1:40:44] here
[1:40:46] I love that he is here and he can turn
[1:40:50] on the lights how are we going to get
[1:40:52] out of it I don't know but he's here and
[1:40:54] he's the one that can turn on the lights
[1:40:56] yes sir he's the one he is the light he
[1:40:59] just makes himself known that's how he
[1:41:01] turns on the lights
[1:41:03] how does he do it he just reveals
[1:41:05] himself in the situation He makes
[1:41:07] himself known and that's how he turns on
[1:41:09] the lights
[1:41:12] it takes Christ to flash away his life
[1:41:15] then all the darkness scatters he
[1:41:16] separates he's pulling his little bride
[1:41:18] out I'll take a people out of the
[1:41:19] Gentiles for my namesake that'll have my
[1:41:21] name what is his name all right not
[1:41:24] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran
[1:41:26] it's Jesus Christ that's right
[1:41:29] let's look at paragraph 269 over on the
[1:41:32] top of page 50.
[1:41:35] paragraph 269
[1:41:36] there is a man here that can turn on the
[1:41:39] lights all right what does he do by
[1:41:41] vindicating his word for this day Jesus
[1:41:43] the son of God who promised the word for
[1:41:46] the this day is right here with us
[1:41:50] how do you turn on light by vindicating
[1:41:51] his word for the day
[1:41:53] he turned on the lights
[1:41:56] amen
[1:41:58] I want to look at uh paragraph 273
[1:42:03] down at the bottom of this page
[1:42:07] he vindicates the word and shows that it
[1:42:09] is the light of the hour that's how we
[1:42:12] know he is light because he is the light
[1:42:14] manifesting itself in flesh
[1:42:18] there's a man here can turn on the light
[1:42:19] and he's shining the light through human
[1:42:22] flesh
[1:42:24] I mean I want to look at paragraph 285
[1:42:26] if we turn the page
[1:42:30] before I read 285 I want to go over here
[1:42:33] to the left side on page 52 down at the
[1:42:36] bottom in between where he's singing
[1:42:37] we'll walk in the light he breaks in
[1:42:40] with his sins he said what is it the
[1:42:41] Vindicated word is Jesus today
[1:42:45] he is the word
[1:42:47] so many people are crying out for Jesus
[1:42:49] and looking for Jesus where is Jesus
[1:42:51] he's here he's well dressed in the power
[1:42:54] of his resurrection showing still today
[1:42:57] the sign of the Messiah amen the
[1:42:59] Vindicated word is Jesus today he is the
[1:43:02] word let's go to the next page page 53
[1:43:04] down at the bottom paragraph 285 I'm
[1:43:07] going to go down to the middle of the
[1:43:09] paragraph
[1:43:10] it's Jesus all the time
[1:43:12] it was Jesus in the days of the man it's
[1:43:15] Jesus today for he is the word and the
[1:43:18] word makes the light it's the light of
[1:43:20] the day
[1:43:21] he said it was Noah was the light of
[1:43:24] this day John was the light of the day
[1:43:26] Elijah was the light of his day Moses
[1:43:27] was the light of the day but he said it
[1:43:29] was Jesus all the time
[1:43:31] amen it's the same person and now the
[1:43:33] bride is the light of the day but it's
[1:43:35] Jesus it's the man here who can turn on
[1:43:37] the light
[1:43:38] and he can turn it on in your life by
[1:43:40] vindicating his word In You and I by
[1:43:43] living his life by manifesting and
[1:43:45] declaring himself in US
[1:43:50] praise God
[1:43:52] amen before we finish I want to take a
[1:43:55] look at one other thing there was a
[1:43:57] something that came up the last time
[1:43:58] that I skipped over I didn't want to go
[1:44:00] into it until we got to the end
[1:44:02] and let's go back to paragraph 138
[1:44:07] 138 on page
[1:44:12] that was
[1:44:14] 138 and page 25.
[1:44:17] brother Ben is going to talk about a
[1:44:19] dream Billy Paul had
[1:44:21] and I found this dream fascinating
[1:44:22] brother Brown doesn't give the
[1:44:24] interpretation of the dream so I don't
[1:44:25] know what the full interpretation or the
[1:44:27] accurate interpretation of the dream is
[1:44:29] but I just want to look at it in the
[1:44:30] light of so many things that the prophet
[1:44:32] of God has said to us
[1:44:35] and he says in paragraph 138 in the
[1:44:39] middle of page 25 my son Billy Paul he
[1:44:41] talks in his sleep but he doesn't have
[1:44:42] dreams very often he had one the other
[1:44:45] night that shook him up said he dreamed
[1:44:47] he was in church
[1:44:49] and I hadn't come in yet he said when I
[1:44:51] come in fire was flying out of my eyes I
[1:44:54] said the time is here it's over
[1:44:57] brother bam at the end of this dream
[1:44:58] says it was a dream given to him of the
[1:45:00] Lord
[1:45:01] that's what he says
[1:45:02] and you see the fire flying out of
[1:45:05] brother branham's eyes amen it reminds
[1:45:07] me of Revelation chapter one The the
[1:45:10] image of Jesus Christ amen he had eyes
[1:45:12] as flames of fire
[1:45:14] amen so it's it's Christ amen he's the
[1:45:18] son of man and now we know that brother
[1:45:19] Brennan was Ace on a man revealing the
[1:45:21] son of man and those eyes are eyes of
[1:45:24] judgment and there's flames shooting out
[1:45:25] of his eyes
[1:45:27] he said the time is here it's over and
[1:45:29] everybody begin to scream I can't my
[1:45:31] children and even my wife said I can't
[1:45:33] get Sarah to ask the blessing at the
[1:45:35] table and so forth and I said he said I
[1:45:37] got to get Lois and the baby I said Lois
[1:45:40] can't come now the baby's too young to
[1:45:42] know Billy the hour's here we must go
[1:45:45] I said it's midnight now with midnight
[1:45:49] is when the bridegroom call comes
[1:45:52] and was he giving them the bridegroom
[1:45:54] call absolutely he said it's midnight
[1:45:56] now before daylight Jesus will be here
[1:46:00] amen if it isn't then I'm a false
[1:46:03] witness of Christ and somebody spoke up
[1:46:05] said now no man knows the men under the
[1:46:06] hour I never said men in her hour I said
[1:46:09] sometime between now and daylight and I
[1:46:11] said but we're at the time let's go and
[1:46:15] he got in the car and started and we
[1:46:17] started up the mountain and when we did
[1:46:18] it was looked like the light was coming
[1:46:20] in the skies but dark upon the Earth so
[1:46:23] it is at the rising of the Sun
[1:46:27] he said I pulled off to the side of the
[1:46:30] road and I held my hands over like this
[1:46:31] and fire still flying from my eyes and
[1:46:34] and he said I said Lord I have did this
[1:46:37] at your command amen and that ties you
[1:46:39] right back to Elijah in The Showdown
[1:46:42] and he's got the ministry of Elijah and
[1:46:45] the Mount Carmel Showdown
[1:46:46] said Lord I've did this at your command
[1:46:48] I have did this just because that you
[1:46:50] told me to do it this way I did these
[1:46:52] things according to what you've told me
[1:46:54] and I motioned to a big Granite Mountain
[1:46:57] and a light without hands so brother
[1:47:00] Branham is not cutting the stone he just
[1:47:03] motioned to a Granite Mountain but a
[1:47:05] light and what did he tell us the light
[1:47:07] was the light was the word
[1:47:10] and a light without hands cut a stone
[1:47:13] which this stone is Christ
[1:47:15] a light without hands cut a stone out of
[1:47:17] the mountain weighing hundreds of tons
[1:47:19] and here it come I said turn your hands
[1:47:21] heads don't look it'll be over in just a
[1:47:23] few minutes I said then a great holy
[1:47:26] hush come everywhere
[1:47:28] as this Stone come towards a place
[1:47:31] almost like silence in heaven
[1:47:33] for the space of half an hour
[1:47:36] it may be later than we think
[1:47:40] there see the that's exactly scriptural
[1:47:43] you see the stone without hands cut out
[1:47:44] of the mountain and so one of these days
[1:47:46] it's going to be that way when you're
[1:47:48] going to scream for something I said to
[1:47:49] them you've already had that time God
[1:47:52] has constantly warned you time after
[1:47:53] time yeah I said even if it's my own kid
[1:47:56] or whoever it is the hour is here I can
[1:47:58] only say what he's told me to say and
[1:48:00] it'll be there and it was then all of a
[1:48:03] sudden Brother Bear claps his hands
[1:48:05] there he says here comes the stone cut
[1:48:07] out of the mountain without hands Daniel
[1:48:09] saw that you know back many years ago
[1:48:12] Billy knew nothing about that it was it
[1:48:14] was a dream sent to him from the Lord
[1:48:18] so brother remember said it was a dream
[1:48:19] sent in from the Lord I don't know what
[1:48:21] will be the full interpretation of that
[1:48:23] or how much will unfold out of that but
[1:48:25] this one thing I know is that brother
[1:48:27] Brandon was standing there a son of man
[1:48:29] revealing the son of man and he was here
[1:48:32] amen as a prophet as a judge amen and he
[1:48:35] and he gave us the word amen through him
[1:48:38] came the word The Light Came that cut
[1:48:41] the revelation of Jesus Christ the
[1:48:43] seventh seal out of the word to show us
[1:48:45] that Christ is the mystery of God
[1:48:47] revealed and we know that stone is
[1:48:50] Christ and it was cut out by the Light
[1:48:52] by the word
[1:48:54] without hands
[1:48:55] wasn't a man it was God's word amen that
[1:48:59] showed the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:49:01] was the mystery of the whole Bible
[1:49:04] because Christ is the mystery of God
[1:49:06] revealed
[1:49:08] now let's look at a few things he says
[1:49:09] further on let's go to paragraph 158.
[1:49:14] paragraph 158.
[1:49:17] brother Branham is is admonishing the
[1:49:20] the church ages
[1:49:23] uh let's go just above paragraph 158 in
[1:49:25] the middle of the previous paragraph it
[1:49:27] says living in a Lutheran glare living
[1:49:28] in a Wesley glare a Baptist a
[1:49:30] presbyterian or some Nazarene glare of
[1:49:32] another church age that went on and
[1:49:34] organized and done the same thing and
[1:49:35] refused to rejected the light when it is
[1:49:38] actually shining and you're living in a
[1:49:40] mirage I say that reverently see but
[1:49:42] you're not not to hurt you but to wake
[1:49:44] you up you're living in a mirage what if
[1:49:47] Jesus says while you're blind and you're
[1:49:48] leading the blind he tried to tell them
[1:49:51] and didn't do it said let them alone
[1:49:52] that the blind leaves the blind they'll
[1:49:54] all fall on the ditch that's the hour
[1:49:56] I've come to if they're going to stagger
[1:49:58] I can't help it don't all I can do I've
[1:50:01] done exactly I've done this at your
[1:50:03] command Lord You're my witness now he
[1:50:06] begins to repeat what he repeated in the
[1:50:08] dream
[1:50:09] I think he's showing us we're at that
[1:50:11] time
[1:50:12] the midnight hour has come the midnight
[1:50:15] call sometime between now amen and the
[1:50:18] rising of the new day in the Millennium
[1:50:19] amen that this is all taking place we've
[1:50:22] already come to the Midnight Hour
[1:50:26] the revelation of Christ the seventh
[1:50:28] seal has been cut out of the of the of
[1:50:31] the mountain amen and it's been moving
[1:50:33] into position that stone is a headstone
[1:50:36] for the bride amen it's a sown a stone
[1:50:38] of Destruction for everyone else
[1:50:40] and Jesus Christ when he comes Amen to
[1:50:43] destroy the Nations he destroys him with
[1:50:46] a sword coming out of his mouth
[1:50:48] what is that his word brother Branham
[1:50:49] says he smites them he destroys them
[1:50:51] with the word
[1:50:53] but what word does he destroy them with
[1:50:55] the same thing he destroys them with is
[1:50:57] the same thing he saves us with
[1:50:59] and the stone that destroys one caps
[1:51:02] another
[1:51:05] praise be to God
[1:51:07] let's go to paragraph 162.
[1:51:13] I'm going to pick it up in the in the
[1:51:15] middle of the paragraph Luther's Mana
[1:51:17] was the message of justification
[1:51:18] Wesley's message was the manifestation
[1:51:20] of sanctification Pentecostal was the
[1:51:22] restoration to guess but this is
[1:51:25] introducing the headstone
[1:51:27] we're Beyond Pentecost the restoration
[1:51:29] of gifts he said this is introducing the
[1:51:32] headstone
[1:51:33] the last day Bright Tree
[1:51:37] which is contrary to all of it and yet
[1:51:39] it's the same light for for the matured
[1:51:43] let's go to page 31 the next page over
[1:51:45] right in the middle paragraph 170. and
[1:51:48] watch as it went forward it grew
[1:51:50] stronger and stronger and so was the
[1:51:52] real little minority of the church
[1:51:53] growed from justification sanctification
[1:51:55] baptism the Holy Ghost and now to the
[1:51:58] coming Capstone shaping itself up no
[1:52:02] more organ organizations after this
[1:52:03] there won't be no more we're on the west
[1:52:07] let's go to paragraph 287.
[1:52:10] all the way back towards the end
[1:52:14] 287 on page 54.
[1:52:19] let's read this this is why I didn't
[1:52:21] want to get into that dream yet because
[1:52:22] I wanted to get to this part here at the
[1:52:24] end
[1:52:25] paragraph 287.
[1:52:28] May there come forth this great issue of
[1:52:30] this rock
[1:52:32] so now brother Brian within he's calling
[1:52:34] forth this coming forth of this great
[1:52:36] issue of this rock
[1:52:38] May there come forth this great issue of
[1:52:40] this rock that's cut out of the mountain
[1:52:41] without hands it'll Crush these Gentile
[1:52:43] kingdoms to the ground all these
[1:52:45] kingdoms spiritual kingdoms and natural
[1:52:47] kingdoms and The Rock will cover the
[1:52:50] whole earth it'll be a purified affair
[1:52:53] those who that rock crushes will be
[1:52:55] ground under powder those who fall upon
[1:52:58] that rock shall have a solid foundation
[1:53:02] o Christ let me as your servant die off
[1:53:06] on this rock this rock of Thy Word
[1:53:14] praise God
[1:53:16] I believe
[1:53:18] in the opening of the seven sea
[1:53:21] I believe in the seventh seal is the
[1:53:24] revelation of Christ and Christ is the
[1:53:26] mystery of God revealed he was the
[1:53:27] mystery contained in the entire Bible
[1:53:30] and what cut it out in the last days
[1:53:32] when the prophet was on the scene the
[1:53:35] light cut out that stone and showed us
[1:53:37] the seven seas
[1:53:39] and all who fall on that
[1:53:42] will be built together again we'll be
[1:53:44] will die off and be resurrected but all
[1:53:47] on whom that falls on will be destroyed
[1:53:50] the same Rock brings life and the same
[1:53:53] Rock brings destruction
[1:53:57] I don't know the full interpretation of
[1:53:59] the dream but from the things we've
[1:54:00] already been told
[1:54:02] we've seen that profit stand with eyes
[1:54:05] flaming a fire as a judge and the word
[1:54:08] that he gave either brings life or
[1:54:10] brings death because the word separates
[1:54:13] the light from the darkness
[1:54:15] you either stay in the darkness or you
[1:54:17] come to the light
[1:54:20] I thank God for the day we live in
[1:54:23] I thank God that that stone
[1:54:25] was revealed to us
[1:54:27] and that we can fall and throw ourselves
[1:54:30] on that stone
[1:54:32] and be broken from all our
[1:54:34] denominational ideas and all of our own
[1:54:37] self-desire and be shattered and put
[1:54:39] back together to reflect Jesus Christ
[1:54:43] and that same stone that did a wonderful
[1:54:46] work for us
[1:54:48] will bring a destruction and a
[1:54:50] purification and that same Rock will
[1:54:54] fill all the Earth
[1:54:56] what kind of rock is that
[1:54:59] it's the kingdom of Jesus Christ
[1:55:01] will fill the Earth will be filled with
[1:55:05] the word of God
[1:55:06] amen let's all stand
[1:55:09] do you believe there's a man here that
[1:55:11] can turn on the light
[1:55:11] [Music]
[1:55:13] who is he he's the chief engineer the
[1:55:15] one who designed it the one who designed
[1:55:17] you is here to turn you on
[1:55:21] I thank God for this message
[1:55:23] amen this message has meant a lot to me
[1:55:26] and I really thank God for him
[1:55:29] amen let's bow our heads and pray
[1:55:32] dear Lord Jesus we thank you for all
[1:55:36] that you have given to us and all that
[1:55:37] you've done for us
[1:55:39] father how can we thank you enough for
[1:55:42] this word that you've sent
[1:55:44] God when the earth is groping in
[1:55:46] darkness and the worst darkness of all
[1:55:48] is religious Darkness
[1:55:50] where they believe there's light but
[1:55:52] it's only a glare
[1:55:53] God how sad that level of deception is
[1:55:57] and Lord if not for your mercy and Grace
[1:56:00] we would all be in the same place
[1:56:03] but God you you are the chief engineer
[1:56:06] that's come and you've turned on the
[1:56:07] light so that we can see
[1:56:10] oh God I pray that you would turn us on
[1:56:14] that we would be your lights in this
[1:56:16] generation shining forth the glory of
[1:56:19] your Resurrection
[1:56:20] may your Resurrection be seen in us as
[1:56:23] you live in US
[1:56:25] God Noah was a light Moses was a light

[1:56:42] uncertainty before us

[1:56:47] it looks like it'll get worse it looks
[1:56:50] like it could get much worse
[1:56:52] but God you just want to see what we're
[1:56:54] going to do
[1:56:55] I pray God that you'll you'll find that
