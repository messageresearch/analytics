and uh but yesterday while [Music] uh and I got a message from Brother Kyle and asking me when am I going to to come and I was so happy but when uh he talked to me yesterday evening that I'm going to to preach it seems that I I changed my mind and I feel so nervous especially when brother Jada when he called me and uh just pray for me Hallelujah and while we will remain standing let us open our Bible in the book of First Kings chapter 6. verse 7. it says and the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready before it was brought lighter so that there was neither Hammer nor ax nor any tall of iron heard in the house while it was in building and uh another scripture in the book of Acts chapter 7 and beginning at verse 47 it says but Solomon built him and house albeit the most high dwilleth not in temples made with hands as said the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my footstool what house will you build me saith the Lord or what is the place of my rest may the Lord a blessing upon the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord and uh in behalf of my Church in kalbayog City the island of Samar Philippines I I bring greetings Hallelujah and uh tonight I would like to title my message what house will you build me what house will you build me Hallelujah it was uh David one time maybe he was relaxing in his house and uh enjoying Alleluia in his Palace in this beautiful palace made with Cedars and everything and one day maybe he looked down and uh he saw the Ark of God dwelling just in curtains and he decided to build a house for the Lord Alleluia in second Samuel chapter 7 beginning at verse 1 he says and it came to pass when the when the king sat in his house and the Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies that the king said unto Nathan the prophet see now I dwell in an House of Cedar but the Ark of God dwelleth in within curtains and Nathan said to the king go do all that is in thine heart for the Lord is with thee and it came to pass through that uh it came to pass that night that the word of the Lord came unto Nation saying go tell my servant David that says the Lord shalt thou build me and house for me to dwell in verse 8 now therefore so shall thou say unto my servant David that saith the Lord of hosts I took thee from the sheep goat from following the ship to be ruler Over My People Israel Over My over my people over Israel and I was with thee with us so ever the winters and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy side and have made thee a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in there Hallelujah it is his desire to help God to build a house for his God and it is a good thing to make plans and to have desire to do things for God and being a human or it's a human nature to make plans for the work of the Lord but brothers and sisters we need to consult God first we need to seek his perfect will and in this particular ah David one time he was he thought of helping God Hallelujah God is pitiful he is uh he is just billing in the curtains well I am Hallelujah dwelling in a house made with sedans but God said I don't need your help David you are the one who need my help Hallelujah maybe you are thinking how great you are being a man of Valor and uh Hallelujah and he became successful in everything Hallelujah but God said it is not you David it is me Hallelujah it is it is not the I am the one who fought for you Hallelujah and you are just my my instrument I am he says hallelujah and I was with thee with her so ever the winters and I Hallelujah have cut off all the enemies it was not your David Hallelujah and uh and he said what house are you going to build me you are planning you are thinking to to build a house in order for me to live it to live in Hallelujah in Isaiah chapter 66 verse 1 he says that says the Lord the heaven is my throne and there is my foot soul where is the house that he built unto me and where is the place of my rest okay David you are planning to build a house for me and imagine how big would be that house that you are going to build me Heaven is my throne and Earth is my footstool where I'm just sitting down it is already heaven and how about if I will stand so imagine how big would be that house that you are planning to build for me Hallelujah but you see brothers and sisters uh but God promised to David that uh he said the son of David he shall build he said he he shall build a house for my name Hallelujah and uh he did not allow David though to build the house for the Lord because uh his hand shed a lot of blood Allelujah and in second Samuel chapter 7 verses uh 12 and 13 He said and when they days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and I will establish his kingdom he shall build an house for my name and I will establish the Throne of his kingdom forever out of thy bowels there would be a seed coming Allelujah and he shall build a house for my name and I will establish the Throne of his kingdom forever and I believe brothers and sisters if God will promise something God will not fail Hallelujah to do God will not fail to fulfill his promise I will establish the Throne of his kingdom and I believe brothers and sisters that this verse does not speak to the Natural seed of David which was Solomon because if we read the Bible in First Kings chapter 11 Hallelujah that uh God he said that I will Rend thy kingdom Hallelujah he will not promise that he is going to establish and then he will uh take back his promise I will establish the Throne of his kingdom and then I will rent it Allelujah First Kings chapter 11 31 and 32 and he said to jeroboam take the ten pieces 10 pieces for that says the Lord the god of Israel behold I will reign the kingdom out of the head of Solomon and will give them tribes to thee but he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake for and for Jerusalem sake the city which I have chosen out of the tribes of Israel and if you read the first Kings chapter 12 that the kingdom was divided Allelujah and he reigned Judah and jeroboam reigned the rest of the tribes of Israel what house are you going to build unto me and where is the place of my rest Hallelujah the scripture that we read in Acts chapter 7 from verse 47 to 49 Allelujah but Solomon built him and house how be it the most high dwell it not in temples made with hands as says the prophet so Solomon built him and house but God does not dwell in a house made with hands Allelujah but the temple that Solomon built it only speaks or it it is only a type of the spiritual Temple that God is going to build for him Hallelujah because uh God will not do anything unless he he spoke it first Hallelujah by the law and by Psalms and by the prophets like for example we have Elijah in this last days Hallelujah but before he fulfilled Hallelujah that that uh that thing he already had spoken it long ago Hallelujah because God will not do anything unless he had spoken it first just like the flood during the time of Noah Hallelujah Before the Flood came Noah had been telling the people had been uh he had been uh preaching about the coming flood because God will not do anything the prophet said ah he will uh he will not do anything unless he had spoken it first just like uh the time in when the Messiah was coming Allelujah and the Bible said and all the prophets the law and the prophets Hallelujah had spoken about the coming Messiah even the lives of the of the of the prophet in the Old Testament like for example the life of Joseph Hallelujah everything that happened in in the life of Joseph was was speaking Hallelujah concerning the coming Messiah he was hated by his Brethren but he was loved by the father Allelujah he was thrown into a pit and declared he was dead Alleluia and Jesus Christ Allelujah he was uh put into into the tomb and declared dead but after three days Hallelujah he was alive and everything Hallelujah he got a gentle bride Jesus Christ he he got a gentle bride everything in the Old Testament Allelujah or God will not do anything unless he had spoken it first by the law by Psalms and by the prophets so God hallelujah he will have a Dwelling Place and Solomon built him a temple and that's only a type of the dwelling place that God is going to have but God doesn't dwell in a temple made with hands in Isaiah chapter 66 verses 1 and 2. it is God himself who had this Christian that says the Lord heaven is my throne and there is my footstool where is the house that you build unto me where is the house that he built into me and where is the place of my rest he got a house he will be he will have a house and he will have a place of rest but what it is where it is Hallelujah and he also answered this question in verse 2. for all those things that mine had made and all those things have been says the Lord but to this man will I look even to him that is poor and of a country spirit and dreamlet at my words where is the place of my rest where is what kind of house Allelujah that I am going to have it is not a building made with hands but a man with poor and our country spirit and have and dreamlife it means and tremblet at my word it means the one that that respect Hallelujah his word the one that uh have reverence Hallelujah at his word and that is the man that I looked that I'm looking Allelujah and uh Hebrews chapter 5 verse chapter 10 verse 5 he says therefore when he comes into the world he says sacrifice and offering the word is not but a body has thou prepared me it is not a building made with hands but he got a body he prepared a body Alleluia for him what knowing not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which he have of God and ye are not your own Hallelujah that is the temple that he is looking Allelujah but the problem brothers and sisters and birbraham said that our body is designed to be a Dwelling Place of God but the problem is when we came to this world Barbarian said we were born in sin shipped in iniquity come to this world speaking lies and this body is no longer fit to be his Dwelling Place in the church age book Ephesian Church AIDS he says now why did this have to be so why was it that the seed of the serpent must come this way Man was created for God man was to be that temple of God the place of God's rest was man Alleluia God's rest the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit was man the temple and then verbraham ah he used this uh scripture uh Acts chapter 7 for from 46 to 51 he says who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him and house albeit the must-hide will it not in temples made with hands as says the prophet Heaven is made throne and the Earth and Earth is my footstool what house will you build me says the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things then he says ye is stiff neck and uncircumcised in heart and ears you don't always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do ye Allelujah and uncircumcised in the heart and ears we know that by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah it was it is when the Holy Ghost is uh is up to dwell in a man and Paul said that our circumcision is not influence but Allelujah by the by the Holy Spirit by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he says he uncircumcised it means you are not baptized with the Holy Ghost you know always resist the Holy Ghost you know always Hallelujah resist it means you don't like that the Holy Ghost will Hallelujah make your body your heart as his Dwelling Place as your father did so uh as your father did so do ye then Satan has known this alone all along it means shaytan he knows that man is designed to be a Dwelling Place of God Satan has known this all along he also wants to indwell man even as Gods so does but God has reserved to himself that right it is not for Satan to dwell in a man Hallelujah that's right God he received to himself Satan cannot do that God Alone appeared in human flesh Satan could not and cannot do that he does not have the creative Powers the only way for Satan to accomplish what he wanted to do was to enter the serpent in Eden even as he entered by evil spirits into the swine at gadhara God does not enter animals but Satan can and will to accomplish his ends he could not have a child directly by Eve as did God by Mary so he entered into the serpent and then begalled him he said just her and by her did Satan have a child vicariously can board the full spiritual characteristics of Satan and the animalistic sensual fleshly characteristic of the serpent no wonder the holy spirit said that Cain was of that Wicked one he was Alleluia now he said God does not enter animal it's only Satan who enters animal he entered into the serpent in the Garden of Eden he enters into the swine at gadhara but God will not do it God does not enter animals Hallelujah but the problem brothers and sisters data after Satan or show the serpent he got his children halleluia and Bethlehem said ah they are animalistic sensual fleshly characteristic of the serpent was on that Lane age of gain and then although Abel was killed by Cayenne but God had a substitute it was said of God through Adam said but the problem when Genesis chapter 6 came Hallelujah that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were Fair and they began to choose Hallelujah Jesus 1 chapter 6 verse 1 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose now the sons of God and the daughters of men began to mingle themselves Allelujah and after that in verse 3 and the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that Hallelujah he also is flesh yet his day shall be 120 years my spirit shall not dwell in man anymore Allelujah for he is flesh and we we inherited that Allelujah Barbara have said animalistic sensual fleshly characteristic of the serpent and since we have that kind of nature we have that kind of character and Bible said God does not enter animal Hallelujah it's only Satan who enters animal and when we come to this world there is already spirit that worketh in the children of these obedience the prince of the air Alleluia and birram say that we are just like uh we were sold in a pawnshop of Satan already and he is Allelujah in our first birth we became Sinners and alienated with God Psalms 51 verse 5 behold I was shaping in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me I was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to this world speaking lies in Romans chapter 3 verses 10 to 12 as it is written there is none righteous no not one no no no three times in one verse that all said no no righteous no not one there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after God there is all they are all gone out of the way and they are all become all together become unprofitable there is none that do with God no not one Hallelujah it means they are all they are together become unprofitable say that God hallelujah created man to be a Dwelling Place of God a house of God a place of God's rest but then when we were born in sin when we came to this world born in sin and he said they are together become unprofitable it means everybody all became useless Hallelujah that's why brothers and sisters when God when Solomon built the first temple and it was so glorious Allelujah they dedicated the temple and the glory of the Lord came down and even the ministers could not even stand to minister because of the glory of God had filled the place Alleluia it's the same thing Brothers says Jesus when God created the first creation Allelujah and the Bible said and God so that it was very good in the sixth day after he created man and God said and the Bible said that and God saw that it was very good but brothers and sisters Hallelujah and uh Barbara said when God created his first family his first ah Soldier he gave them the best weapon that they ever have already which is the word if they will only are stay with that word there would be no death no no nothing no sin no no hungry no no there's no old age Hallelujah no sickness no death Hallelujah but when they stepped out from the word halleluia all sorrows and problems came in in the same thing brothers and sisters when Solomon built the first temple and even the Queen of Sheba when he heard the report Alleluia she can Chronicle chapter 9 verse 3 and when the Queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon when he came to Solomon Hallelujah and see had seen the wisdom of Solomon now the Bible was talk was talking about the wisdom of Solomon and the house that he had built the wisdom of Solomon and then they speak concerning the house that he had built and the myth of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel his cup bearers also and their apparel and his decent decent and his ascent by which uh he went up into the house of the Lord there was no more spirit in her when the Bible talk about the wisdom of Solomon it is not how you know how ah very intelligent Solomon was but when the Bible talk about the wisdom of Solomon it was how the ACT hallelujah how they go to to the house of the Lord the order hallelujah how they live the word of the Lord but Hallelujah but after all living Solomon himself himself he box lit and all of them Hallelujah backslid and God used the he allowed the King of the North to destroy that first temple Allelujah but God promised Hallelujah in the time of Nehemiah Israel and haggai Alleluia chapter 2 verse 9. the glory of this later house shall be greater than of the former says the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give peace says the Lord of hosts so there will be a rebuilding of the temple to restore or restoration of the temple Hallelujah and God promised that the second temple the glory of the second temple shall be greater the glory shall be greater than the former Hallelujah and although we were born in sin Allelujah we became useless but down inside of us there is a seed predestinated before the foundation of the world and we are predestinated to be a part of his plan as part of that body of his Dwelling Place Ephesians 1 4 7 1 47 according to say ah no before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us until the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace were in he had made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins we have Redemption when we talk about Redemption Redemption means is to bring back Allelujah to its original position to restore to bring us back Allelujah Hallelujah to fulfill his plan in US second Corinthians uh 5 21 for he had made himself he made him to be seen for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him he took my judgment he took your judgment Hallelujah upon him and when that body was judged at Calvary and when you are a part of that body you've been judged together with him at Calvary Allelujah and uh there is no so-called uh double dopa Jeopardy Hallelujah once a man is judged you cannot judge him anymore there are some in the in the Philippines before uh uh our former president uh Rodrigo duterte uh there are some there are some people who are in uh in the maximum Penitentiary or they've been judged the maximum penalty our we do not have a death penalty in the Philippines so our the maximum penalty is uh to be a life imprisonment and after they were judged and they continue in in jail cooking producing drugs because they will not be judged anymore because they were already judged Allelujah because there is no so-called double joke Joe party and when the body of Jesus Christ was judged Allelujah at the cross of calvary every part of that body is also judged together with him Hallelujah and by the process of that new birth we become we became a part of that body through justification sanctification and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we become a part of that body First Corinthians 12 13 for by one Spirit we are all baptized into that body we become a part of that body and if we are a part of that body then Allelujah when he took the Judgment there was no more there is no more judgment for every part of that body Allelujah just like I like what I remember uh an example that brother Looney had a when he used the Lazarus as an example he said that lazarusa he might have maybe he after he was after he died and was resurrected then he he got a wife and then got family got children Hallelujah but those children that he got before they were born they were seen Hallelujah in him that said were in him Allelujah and when Lazarus died all the seed that were in him died Hallelujah but when Lazarus was risen all the seed that were in him were raised into Hallelujah that's why Abraham said I was I died with him at Calvary Hallelujah but after three days and he was resurrected I was also resurrected with him Allelujah and for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body Hallelujah whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we'll be banned or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit and once we are a part of that body baptized into that one body and we are in Christ the Bible says that therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creation he is a new creature Hallelujah Although our old our first Birds we came into this world with the problem said it was a problem who said this animalistic sensual fleecily nature but when Hallelujah we become a part of that body there is there are therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creation all things are passed away behold all things are become new Allelujah and the Bible says in in Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 that Jesus Christ he is the beginning of the creation of God he is the beginning of that creation Hallelujah in the message marriage the marriage of the Lamb he says all that was all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church to continue the work of the Gospel then we become not by artificial name but by a reality of the Holy Spirit of Life connecting us into Christ then through the power of his resurrection we are raised from the dead things of the world and sitting in him in Heavenly places amen I like that tonight we are sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus see resurrected with him died to the things of the world and took on Christ and when we take on Christ then the world's the world is dead then we no more care for the world the world is dead to us and it's dead to us and we are dead to it you are a different person different personality because you are a new creation not the same creation polished up not a man that's turned a new Leaf but a man that's died and been born again and become a new creation in Christ Jesus the spirit of the Living God lives in the person halleluia and you become that Temple not a temple Allelujah made with hands but Alleluia a body that he prepared for him imagine brothers and sisters when God asks a question what house are you going to build me Hallelujah Heaven is my throne and Earth is my food soul he is just telling hallelujah how big he is but brothers and sisters praise the Lord and thank God that big God hallelujah can enter into our heart Hallelujah God's provided place of worship you are then not yourself you are a new creator for the Greek their their means a new creation you've been recreated again halleluia our first verse Alleluia is useless unprofitable but God Hallelujah you've been recreated again the power of God comes upon you and you become created a new creature with break which brings the whole physical being spiritual being and everything in subject to the word of God not no other way that's why if you are in Christ anyone Hallelujah be in Christ there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit after the spirit not only by that you claim that you are in Christ but there is a manifestation Hallelujah you can see the fruit that you are in Christ those that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit not like as a this uh in IV Bible is a when you read the NIV Bible there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus period Allelujah but brothers and sisters the cut that phrase who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit and then they found out the translation translator is again Hallelujah but no condemnation telling which are in Christ Jesus and you can see Hallelujah they're the fruit of their lives they are not walking Hallelujah by the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death Hallelujah Colossians 1 14-18 in whom we have Redemption through his blood Although our first burden was messed up but through his blood we have Redemption he had bring us back to our original position even the forgiveness of sin who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible with their division or Dominion or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of that body Hallelujah we are a part of that body and he is the head of body who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead and in that in all things he might have the preeminence so Jesus Christ Allelujah is the head of that building Jesus Christ is the head of that body the church and the fullness of the godhead dwelled in him bodily and if you are a part of that body we have it by measure Hallelujah we are all although all the fullness of the godhead will it in that head bodily Allelujah but if you are a part of that body we have the same God the same quality that was in that head is the same life Hallelujah that is in the body Hallelujah like the example of a like the ocean when you get this big machine and examine the chemicals that are in the ocean Allelujah and then you take a spoonful of water from the ocean and then examine the chemicals that is in that spoon there's no difference we have the same Hallelujah chemicals that are in the ocean and on that spoonful of salt water so it's the same thing brothers and sisters Hallelujah the spirit that is the godhead that is in in that in the head Allelujah is the same God that is Allelujah in every part of that body only we have it by Mission and we have the fullness of the godhead now Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said God is pressed in Christ Jesus who both Father Son and Holy Holy Ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily then he says now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the pre-minences all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church the Believers Hallelujah now we are a part of that body not a building made with hands in Matthew chapter 24 verses 1 and 2. when uh maybe the disciples want to impress our our Lord look at this Temple how beautiful it is just in verse one and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the building of the Temple look up the temple Allelujah and Jesus said unto them you see not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be shown down see that is a glorious Temple that is a beautiful Temple but I say unto you Hallelujah verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and Barbara Ham went on and says shows that God doesn't dwell in houses made with hands God dwells in human hearts for a body has thou prepared me the holy the Holy Ghost don't dwell in a house it dwells in the heart that's that Temple Allelujah you know not that you are the Temple of the Living God Amen Hallelujah but brothers and sisters the building or the natural Temple that Solomon had built was a very type how they build it and how they you know uh in everything in the temple is a very type of the spiritual Temple that God is going to have Allelujah the verse that we on our scripture reading First Kings chapter 6 verse 7 and the house when it was in building was built of stone made really before it was brought tighter so that there was neither Hammer nor ax nor any toll of iron heard in the team in the house while it was in building when they were building the Temple all the stones and the Timbers it came from it comes from different places of the world and when those materials were brought into the site there's no more shaping Hallelujah no more hammering Alleluia no more adding or no more cutting it was already shape before it was all brought into that into the uh Temple site how perfectly engineered hallelujah what what an architecture you know well I was uh troubling in the states I I saw some some buildings some people are they are building and the first thing you know uh that video is uh just plot in the the ground fill it with dirt and then use uh this uh heavy equipment and to make the the place flat because when it is flat it is easy to to build the the building Hallelujah but in Jerusalem you can imagine the place where they are going to build the temple and it is a Rocky Mountain you know it is not living Hallelujah but everything every part of the temple when it is brought into the place it is fit Hallelujah to its place and no more cutting you can imagine how how they did it Hallelujah a greater than Solomon is here now the days of Solomon asked any Theologian scriptural man knows that that was the Golden Age of the Hebrew they had no words the it it was almost like a millennium to them great day they built the temple All Nation Nations fear them they was afraid to do anything because they know that the people was with one heart and one Accord God gave that gave them a gift and they believe it they accepted it and with one heart and one Accord they work with it Allelujah when the building when they were working for the building there was Hallelujah the wisdom of Solomon and All Nations always differed Hallelujah they are afraid to make war with Israel because the people were in one heart in in one Accord but brothers and sisters this time we are not just building a building of a House made with hands but this is the building Hallelujah which is the body of Jesus Christ and if we have Solomon there but everyone said greater than Solomon is here Allelujah if we only believe the condition of that time should be also the condition of this time he says they were in one heart they were in one Accord and that should be brothers and sisters Hallelujah that should be happened in this in this time Hallelujah take away all the princess there should be no rivalry in the body of Jesus Christ every everything every part they have their own place Hallelujah Israel and the church listen when they build the Temple of Solomon they any of your missions here uh no could get the pretty uh this pretty good they brought the Cedars down from Lebanon they floated them in as far as jupa and how them by Oxford and so forth you know then they cut out all their Stones all around the world but when they come together they were such perfect Masonry and in 40 years in the building of the temple there were there wasn't a bus abaso or a sound of a hammer every stone went one was cut this away one was cut that way one was cut back this away but every one of them went together they started lying the thing putting the building up getting along fine and they found a funny looking Stone they didn't want that thing said that don't belong here and they kicked it out throwed it over in the wheat pile and come to find out the belt on and on and on and on and come to find out the very Stone they had rejected was the Chief Cornerstone brothers and sisters Maybe some brothers are funny to you or some sister they are funny to you they are old Hallelujah but every part of that body is very important [Music] Allelujah there is a purpose you might be just uh you know you are just sitting at the back and you don't Hallelujah maybe you said oh I like to be like the musician like the singer and like the the preacher Hallelujah they are good because uh they are blessed because they are always in front and I'm just sitting here brothers and sisters you are important to God you are important in the body imagine brothers and sisters if all of us will behave and nobody is sitting there so what kind of a church we have Alleluia all of us everybody is important you might be just sitting there and you might be just uh you know praying secretly but don't you know brothers and sisters that there is no preacher that can preach A good sermon here Hallelujah except there is someone praying for him you maybe say that this church is doing uh some missionary missionary Works in different places of the world but without somebody who is secretly giving doing their parts contributing their parts Hallelujah there will be no missionary work will be done for this church every part of the body is very important Hallelujah tell me any part of the body that got no purpose I am making this an example just like your eyebrow you may say what is he he doing there I tell you shame it and you will know Hallelujah what is the purpose of that eyebrow but it has a you know a more important role in our body the eyebrow because uh when you work and then you will sweat and win your sweat come into your eyes it will damage your eyes so God put an eyebrow and it did not just grow this way it grow this way Hallelujah so that when the sweat start dropping it will go this way and will not come to your to your eyes Hallelujah every part of the body is very important and we should do and babraham said as long as you serve your purpose you will come up in the resurrection as long as you serve your purpose remember Hallelujah God did not put you there without a purpose and you know just like our watch this watch maybe if you will be given a chance to choose which part of this watch you want to be maybe you will see I I would like to be the diamond because it it's always on display I would like to be the second hand or the minute hand because the owner is always looking at me Hallelujah but brothers and sisters don't you know that the most important part of this watch is not this things that are seen there are parts of this watch that even our eyes could not see it that's why the was repairer he uses lens just to see this very small part but when you misplace that small part this watch will no longer work and what you are going to do with your diameter and with with this display display in in your hands you have to take it off from your hands and you will you know if it is not working anymore so brothers and sisters Alleluia whatever our part in the body we have to support Allelujah we have to do our part and God will bless you Hallelujah Ephesians chapter 2 verse 21 in home all the building fitly framed together growth unto Unholy temple in the Lord groweth unto and holy Temple Temple means Dwelling Place Allelujah in the Lord Ephesians 4 16 from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make it increase of the body unto the defying of itself in love in love Hallelujah Jesus Christ is the same yesterday to them forever he says and it was so masterly built that when the temple went together it had all kinds of little funny looking stones in it but when they began to read the blueprint it was all in the blueprint and there wasn't not even a boss of a soul or sound of a hammer for 40 years in building the Temple I think that's the way God's got his people all cut out Allelujah God before it was brought into the place Allelujah it was already shaped my we are not con I am not contacting bar Chad what I'm going to preach tomorrow or on Sunday and Hallelujah or he also he don't contact anybody any person any any Minister what is going to preach he just pray we just pray Hallelujah and then you know by the grace of God I was uh privilege to travel and to see to meet Believers in different churches and every time I come to church Hallelujah I feel the same Spirit as we have been in my church you go to other churches they have the same spirit they have the same life why Allelujah because there is only one architect who designed the building Alleluia I think that's the way God's got his people all cut out once God and nature of one kind one another but they are all Christians fitted Stones joined together upon the cheap Corner Cornerstone Christ Jesus Hallelujah Maybe one stone is one sister is looks like funny to you Hallelujah maybe one stone is is black and some Stone were cut in Lebanon or in Africa and then some Stone are white and some Stone are black and some Stone are brown maybe from the Philippines Hallelujah and you cannot see that I will not sit beside you because you are brown and I am white and I cannot be sit beside you Hallelujah because I am Brown and you are black always you can do nothing there is someone who designed it and when the building is finished oh there's a lot of colors Hallelujah a beautiful building imagine brothers and sisters you have a big garden and because you only like a white flower and all your flowers in the big Garden are are all white that's not a beautiful garden but when we see the red pink White yellow you will get Hallelujah a beautiful garden and that's the same thing with God maybe uh you don't like the way he shape but Hallelujah there is somebody who did it I think that's the way God's got his people cut out once got a nature of one kind one another but they're all Christian fitted Stones joined together upon the Chief Cornerstone Christ Jesus oh there's the main thing so many reject the precious Cornerstone where we are all built together cemented together with God's love that's right God's love Hallelujah and when we have that there's nothing will separate us there's nothing can divide us as long as we love one another but I've been a minister for 71 years I've seen all kinds of gifts I've seen God do great things but the greatest thing I I ever seen in my life was love it's the most powerful force that stops anything there is is love love that moved almighty God God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son love is a great K note thing we lived out it's something that's eternal hallelujah it's something love hallelujah it's something that's eternal hope Faith charity Hallelujah but love it's something that's eternal so we have to be fitly joined together in love Hallelujah because uh you will not be ruptured without me and I will not be ruptured without you God bless you all and I now give back the time to our beloved pastor let's all stand musicians if you would come and brother Ben make your way up amen how many is happy to be part of that house that God is building amen not a house made with hands not even necessarily the part you see but the part you don't see is where he's dwelling in me amen what you see is just the manifestation on the outside God bless you brother Jonathan golf it's good to see you amen God bless you amen what a good reminder amen that we all must fit together and I need your little odd Quirk and you need my little odd Quirk it's there for a reason and we would learn to depend on one another instead of criticizing one another and be thankful that we're not all the same because if we're all the same we would all have the same blind spot we'd all be taken by that same blind spot but because each of us view things a little bit different it's there for God's protection and if we'll just love one another trust one another and respect one another God will use all those little differences to keep us going in the right direction and keep us guarded against evil man God bless you man thank you so much I'm so glad you came by amen he's been here many times but it's the first time he's preached here amen so I enjoyed it how many enjoyed it amen amen will you keep praying for him amen he'll be going home on the 20th pray for him that God will bless him and bless his ministry at home and his church and his family men when brother Ben comes back we'll sing turn around on my song that was gone and I'm not going to attempt to do it by myself God bless you brother Ben so glad I'm Yours [Music] Mercy has followed he's so glad you found me and said be free [Music] oh so glad on yours [Music] so glad you're a mercy has followed me so glad you found me it set me free so glad I'm Yours [Applause] [Music] amen I remember one time brother Branham said he said sometimes my wife doesn't understand me he said frankly sometimes I don't understand myself but I'm so glad he was made exactly the way he was and God knew where he fit and we may not even understand ourselves completely and why we have the temperament and the things we like and things we don't and the way we act and we may not always understand it but I'm so glad he knows where I fit amen and if I can just trust him the great architect to place me in the right spot if I can just yield to him he'll put me right where I belong and use me exactly the way he wants to use me for his glory I'm so glad when I don't know where I fit he knows where I fit amen if I can just trust him all will come out right amen let's bow our heads and pray together dear Lord Jesus I thank you Father for the word you've given us Lord for the reminder Lord that we need one another that you intended Lord for us to be fit together and God there's a place that you want to dwell and you want to dwell in your people Lord and we want you to dwell within us Lord we want to yield to you and Lord we want to be filled with your spirit and we want your life to live through us God I pray that we would be the right kind of Dwelling Place Lord that we would yield to you and you could fit us all together and you could display yourself through your bride in this end time help us God to surrender to your hands surrender to your placing so that by your place and we will come to the right spot and fulfill the purpose that you have for us and help us to trust you in all things Lord and Trust what you're doing with us Lord knowing that you from before the foundation of the world knew how it should look you knew how everything would work and we're trusting you to work it in our individual lives to make us Lord what you want us to be in places where you want us to be and use us in the way that you want to use us Lord I pray that you get glory in our lives Lord as we yield to you Lord we pray together that you would bless our brother landline as he travels home we thank you for bringing him our way Lord we thank you for using him tonight we pray Lord your blessings will go upon him and the rest of his journey and may get home and be a blessing to his family and to his church there may you prosper him
