[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] Oh Jesus, Jesus,
[0:05] Jesus. Sweetest name I
[0:10] know. Fills my every
[0:15] long keeps me singing as I go.
[0:21] The more that I
[0:25] surrender, the
[0:28] lighter my
[0:31] Lord. The more that I release my cares,
[0:38] the more he takes control.
[0:43] And the more that I can humble
[0:48] myself, the more he lifts me
[0:52] up. Every day I
[0:56] live. Lord, I love you more. The more
[1:02] that I
[1:04] surrender, well, the more that I
[1:10] surrender, the
[1:12] lighter my
[1:15] Lord, the more that I release my car,
[1:21] the more he takes
[1:25] control. And the more that I can humble
[1:31] myself, the more he lifts me
[1:36] up. Every day I
[1:40] live. Lord I love
[1:44] [Music]
[1:46] you. Well, I thank God for the
[1:51] lighthouse.
[1:54] I owe my life to
[2:00] him. For
[2:02] Jesus is the
[2:05] [Applause]
[2:06] lighthouse and run the rocks of sin.
[2:13] He has shown a light around
[2:19] me that I could clearly
[2:26] see. If it
[2:28] wasn't for the
[2:32] lighthouse, tell me where would this
[2:37] ship
[2:40] be? and
[2:42] let me walk with you,
[2:46] [Music]
[2:49] Jesus. Oh,
[2:53] never leave me alone.
[3:01] For
[3:02] without you
[3:05] I could
[3:10] never. Oh,
[3:13] never make
[3:15] heaven my home once
[3:22] more.
[3:23] Let me walk with you, Jesus.
[3:34] Never leave me
[3:37] [Music]
[3:42] alone.
[3:44] Without you,
[3:47] I could
[3:51] [Music]
[3:55] never make
[3:57] heaven my
[4:00] [Music]
[4:03] home. There is an
[4:08] unseen hand to me.
[4:12] [Music]
[4:13] that leads through
[4:17] ways I cannot
[4:22] see. While going
[4:27] through this world of
[4:32] hope, his hand still
[4:37] leads me as I go.

[5:06] day I'll reach that
[5:11] straight still guided
[5:16] by the
[5:21] unseen. His hand has
[5:25] led through shadows free.
[5:31] But while it
[5:35] leaves I have no

[5:45] lead me to that
[5:50] home where sin nor
[5:55] sorrows air can
[5:59] come. Well, I'm trusting

[15:37] straight. Lead
[15:40] him in the
[15:43] light of his
[15:46] glory and grace.
[15:52] Let us bow our heads together this
[15:53] evening.
[15:55] Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, Father,
[15:58] that you've gathered us to this
[16:00] place, God, in all the world and all the
[16:03] earth and this globe, Lord. There's so
[16:06] few that get to hear what we get to
[16:09] hear, God. And you've saw fit that by
[16:12] your power, you would draw us to commune
[16:15] with you once again. that you would
[16:17] bring us into a place of fellowship with
[16:19] brothers and sisters, a place where we
[16:22] could hear your truth, Lord,
[16:25] proclaimed. God, it's a rare privilege
[16:27] on this earth, but we're so thankful to
[16:29] be part of that, Lord. Part of the
[16:31] recipients of that privilege by your
[16:33] grace. And God, may we give you our
[16:35] attention and our focus. And may we draw
[16:37] from you, Lord, all that you have for us
[16:39] today. May we take advantage of the
[16:41] opportunity you've given us, Lord. May
[16:44] we draw from you, El Shadi, all the
[16:46] strength that we need. For your word is
[16:49] strength. Your life is light and it it
[16:51] pours into us and strengthens us for
[16:53] this day that we live in. And God, may
[16:56] you give us a fresh dose of it tonight.
[16:58] A fresh mana from heaven. Take this
[17:01] vessel of mine as I yield it to you and
[17:03] use it for your glory. And give us all
[17:05] ears to hear and a heart to perceive
[17:07] what you have for us. For God, we come
[17:10] trusting and depending upon you. In
[17:13] Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[17:16] Amen. Amen. God bless you this evening.
[17:19] While you're standing, if you'll take
[17:20] your Bible and turn with me to
[17:22] Revelation chapter 7. I intend to
[17:25] continue on from Sunday. There was
[17:27] several things that I didn't have time.
[17:29] I just felt to stop when I stopped and I
[17:32] got some things I'd like to share that
[17:33] are left over. also want to bring to
[17:35] your attention and remind you that this
[17:37] next Sunday will be Easter Sunday and
[17:39] we've got a couple of our brothers
[17:40] that'll be traveling away and uh brother
[17:43] Jim Swanson will be over at Bible
[17:44] believers preaching for them. So, we
[17:46] want to remember him in prayer. Brother
[17:48] Gabe Smith just got back. It's good to
[17:49] have him in the service. Got back from
[17:50] Oregon and he's going this weekend to
[17:53] Pittsburgh to preach for brother John
[17:54] Kadima's Easter meeting. So, it's nice
[17:56] to catch you once in a while as you pass
[17:58] through, brother. We've we've been
[17:59] enjoying it. Uh you've been certainly
[18:01] busy lately. So, we want to remember
[18:03] brother Gabe in prayer as well uh for
[18:06] the service on Sunday. Amen. Let's look
[18:09] at Revelation chapter 10. And I'm just
[18:10] going to read one verse while we're
[18:12] standing. Let's read verse 7 together.
[18:14] Revelation 10 and verse
[18:17] 7. But in the days of the voice of the
[18:20] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[18:22] sound, the mystery of God should be
[18:24] finished as he had declared to his
[18:27] servants, the prophets. May God bless
[18:29] you as you have your seats.
[18:32] Such a familiar scripture to us, but one
[18:34] with such deep meaning for us because
[18:37] the fulfillment of us is the day we live
[18:39] in. We live in the fulfillment of the
[18:41] scripture. We are in the midst of it
[18:44] now. It's happening all around us and we
[18:47] don't want to lose sight of that because
[18:49] it's so critical to everything that's
[18:51] happening in the world today. And I want
[18:54] to continue with the mysterious book in
[18:57] an earthn vessel. This would be part
[18:59] two. a mysterious book in an earthn
[19:00] vessel. And uh we might just uh uh uh
[19:04] have a little bit of overlap and share
[19:05] some things we shared before. And I want
[19:07] to thank brother Franco again. He did
[19:09] the same thing he did last time. He just
[19:11] grabbed my notes just an hour or two ago
[19:14] and threw them on some slides and he's
[19:16] doing it really fast. And uh I feel bad
[19:18] for him because I told him I'll get them
[19:20] to you today like 1 or 2:00. Well, I got
[19:23] them to him at
[19:24] 4:30. And so I put him on short notice.
[19:27] And this is why I don't do too many
[19:28] powerpoints. I wish I could do them like
[19:30] brother Gabe. He's the master of
[19:31] powerpoints and I love them. But for me,
[19:34] I mean, God works with all of us
[19:35] individually and and for me, I just
[19:38] never get that vein early. It always
[19:40] comes late for me. I put pieces together
[19:42] and I study and I read and then it seems
[19:45] like it's always always shifting and
[19:48] moving and it's something I can't get my
[19:50] hands around and I like the freedom. I
[19:52] don't like to be constrained. I like the
[19:53] freedom to flex as the spirit moves me
[19:55] in my study. And so that's why I have a
[19:58] hard time doing PowerPoints sometime,
[19:59] but Franco's been so gracious to put
[20:02] through some extra effort because I
[20:03] think it is nice to read the scriptures
[20:05] together and the quotes together. So I
[20:07] appreciate that. So there's a little bit
[20:09] of experimentation. So forgive me if I
[20:11] fumble around, but like I said, Sunday,
[20:13] if you relax, I'll relax. I won't be
[20:15] nervous, you won't be nervous. We'll all
[20:16] just keep feeding on the word. Amen. So
[20:19] we got a little bit of a learning curve,
[20:20] but we thank God for
[20:22] that. Amen. And we just read through
[20:24] this scripture, but I want to look at
[20:26] this quote. This is a one that we read
[20:28] Sunday. You love him with all your
[20:30] heart. You love him with all your heart.
[20:32] You understand now what the seven seal
[20:34] book was. What is it? We got it in a
[20:37] scroll now. And just remember just in
[20:39] these last days, it was kept in an
[20:42] earthly vessel. You understand that now?
[20:45] And who was the earthly vessel? Jesus
[20:47] Christ. No man had it. Nobody had it.
[20:50] It's only through him. It wasn't even
[20:52] written in the word. If it was written
[20:54] in the word, it was hid so that you
[20:56] couldn't even find it. Yeah, that's the
[20:58] truth. Amen. That's right. So, it's in
[21:01] him that it's revealed and in that
[21:03] earthly vessel so it wouldn't rot or
[21:05] rust. So you remember Sunday we were
[21:08] talking about this uh seven seal book,
[21:10] this book of redemption, this book of
[21:12] life, this myster I call it a mysterious
[21:14] book because brother Brenham calls it a
[21:16] mysterious book because it is a
[21:17] mysterious book because the properties
[21:19] of this book are so mysterious it's not
[21:21] like anything we ever understood as a
[21:23] book before because brother Brennham
[21:25] said Adam had this book. Amen. But
[21:28] remember we were talking and and uh I
[21:30] was laughing with brother Brian Sunday
[21:32] afternoon just the imagery of of Adam
[21:35] with a book in his hand trying to till
[21:37] the soil tried to and and and I said you
[21:40] know it's comical but I mean he didn't
[21:42] have any clothes so he didn't have a
[21:44] pocket to put the book you know he
[21:46] didn't have any place to rest it or set
[21:48] it. What's he doing with this book? So
[21:49] we realize it's not a physical book.
[21:52] It's not something he was carrying.
[21:54] Amen. It was the revelation in that
[21:56] book. Amen. Was given to Adam because
[21:58] Adam was intended to bring forth the
[22:00] names that were in that book as a seed
[22:02] of God, a seedline, a race of God upon
[22:04] the earth. But because of hybridization,
[22:06] he fell and he lost the book. Amen. He
[22:10] lost the right to rule the earth. He
[22:12] lost the inheritance. He lost it all.
[22:15] And then brother Brennham said, "And and
[22:17] you came wrong, but you came anyhow
[22:19] because the original, we shouldn't have
[22:21] come through sex desire, through this
[22:23] polluted way, and through corruption. We
[22:25] should have come perfect by the will of
[22:27] God in his appointed time and been
[22:28] manifest as a son or daughter of God
[22:30] upon the earth. Now, we've come anyways
[22:32] as a son or daughter of God, but we come
[22:34] through hybridization and through the
[22:35] will of man. So, we came but we came
[22:38] wrong, but we came anyhow. But because
[22:40] he because because his wife fell in
[22:43] deception and he chose to go with her to
[22:45] redeem her, to save her. Amen. He lost
[22:47] the right of the book. And so, the book
[22:49] went back to the to the hand of the
[22:51] original to God himself.
[22:55] We agree. Amen.
[22:57] But God is a spirit.
[23:01] Then that and and God's pure essence.
[23:03] He's a spirit. He's an invisible spirit
[23:05] which no man can approach to. And so is
[23:07] God the spirit sitting holding a
[23:09] physical book in his hand and sitting on
[23:12] a chair. God can take any form he takes.
[23:14] He takes the form of man. His theophony
[23:15] is in the form of man. We learned that
[23:17] who's Melzdc. But we realize this is a
[23:20] mysterious book because these properties
[23:22] about this book are strange. He's been
[23:24] holding this book, amen, for these
[23:26] thousands of years, waiting for a
[23:28] redeemer. And at the end time, the call
[23:30] comes forth, who's worthy to come and
[23:31] take the book and loose the seals? And
[23:33] no man on heaven and no man on earth and
[23:35] no man under the earth was worthy to
[23:37] take the book to loose the seals even to
[23:38] look upon the book. Amen. But the lamb
[23:42] stepped forward and he took the book.
[23:43] And so we see this imagery playing out.
[23:46] The lamb steps forward and he goes to
[23:47] the one on the throne and he takes the
[23:49] book out of his hand. But who's the
[23:51] lamb? And who's the one on the throne?
[23:53] It's two manifestations of the same
[23:55] being. So, we've got to stop locking
[23:58] ourselves down physical with physical
[24:00] things and start seeing spiritual truths
[24:03] that are here.
[24:05] Amen.
[24:07] Because brother Bam said he was holding
[24:09] the book in his right hand and it went
[24:11] to his right hand, which is his hand of
[24:12] power and authority. And where did Jesus
[24:14] go? After the resurrection, he went to
[24:16] the right hand of the father. So, he's
[24:18] the same place the book is, right? Amen.
[24:21] Yeah. And brother Brandon then says,
[24:24] "Now, in order," so he didn't, he he
[24:26] goes, he says, "Now, if you want to
[24:27] understand this, go to Jeremiah." That's
[24:28] what we labored on Sunday. Go to
[24:30] Jeremiah. The mysteries in Jeremiah, you
[24:32] have a sealed copy of the book and you
[24:34] have an open copy of the book. But
[24:36] Jeremiah had both books sealed into an
[24:38] earthn vessel so it wouldn't be lost. So
[24:40] after the redemption out of Babylon, the
[24:42] return back to the inheritance, which is
[24:44] our word, Amen. You can go back and you
[24:47] can pull out of the of the earthn
[24:49] vessel. Amen. this book. Yeah. Which was
[24:53] the record of the inheritance and the
[24:54] proof of purchase and the right to
[24:56] inherit. Amen. And you can compare the
[24:59] open and close. Amen. And they match.
[25:01] And it's a legal document and it's a
[25:03] right for the one who has the right to
[25:05] inheritance to lay claim to his
[25:06] inheritance.
[25:08] All right. So, Brother Benham said that
[25:10] God hid this book in an earthn vessel.
[25:14] And he calls it here an earthly vessel
[25:15] or an earthn vessel.
[25:18] But listen, I thought the Bible's very
[25:21] clear and I thought Brother Brandham was
[25:22] very clear. Adam had the book and Adam
[25:25] lost the book and it went to the right
[25:26] hand of him that sits on the throne
[25:28] waiting for somebody to redeem it. How
[25:30] did he put it in an earthly vessel? He's
[25:31] holding it in his hand. Yeah.
[25:36] Oh my goodness. I love it, friends. And
[25:39] you might be looking at me thinking,
[25:40] "You're just nuts, Brother Chad. I don't
[25:42] know what you're so excited about." What
[25:44] I'm so excited about is this reality
[25:46] that's busting our human bubble and our
[25:48] carnal understanding and trying to bring
[25:50] us into a spiritual revelation of
[25:52] reality. And we've got to move past
[25:54] symbols and carnality and movements and
[25:58] time and space and all of that. And we
[26:00] got to move to the truth of all of these
[26:01] things because the reality is the truth.
[26:05] And so now what does it mean? He hurt
[26:07] hid it in an earthly vessel. That means
[26:10] that listen. Oh, praise God.
[26:14] It was written in the word. He said now
[26:16] it's it it uh it's in him that it's
[26:20] revealed.
[26:22] So it's in him that it's revealed and in
[26:25] that earthly vessel saw it and
[26:27] rot. So he took the book and he hid it
[26:32] in an earthly
[26:34] vessel so it wouldn't be lost. So at the
[26:36] end uh uh of the return out of
[26:39] Babylonian captivity, Amen. Whoever had
[26:42] purchased the inheritance had a right to
[26:45] come and claim it. Amen. Amen. So it's
[26:47] hidden in earthly vessel. And brother
[26:49] Brandon, when he says here, so it's in
[26:51] him that it's revealed. So what does it
[26:54] mean to hide it in earthly vessel? It
[26:56] means the contents of the book, the
[26:58] revelation of the book, what the book is
[27:00] all about is actually revealed in the
[27:04] flesh of Jesus Christ. Because what is
[27:07] the contents of the book? It is the
[27:09] desire for God to be made flesh upon the
[27:12] earth. And so for 2,000 years, amen, the
[27:16] contents of this book has been hid in
[27:17] the earthly vessel that we know that
[27:20] Jesus was God made flesh.
[27:23] Amen. And so that revelation of that
[27:26] revelation, that part of the book wasn't
[27:28] lost because it was insecure in Jesus
[27:31] Christ.
[27:33] Amen.
[27:36] Oh, praise God. Okay, that's
[27:40] review. He says in the sixth seal, well,
[27:43] the whole thing, the whole plan of
[27:44] redemption lays under these seals, the
[27:47] whole
[27:48] book. Uh, and then in feast of trumpets,
[27:50] now the hidden mysteries of Christ was
[27:52] fully revealed in the seven seals. The
[27:54] reason I go to the first one is because
[27:57] sometimes I want to slow down and I want
[27:59] us to think because we hear phrases over
[28:02] and over and over again, but I want to
[28:04] stop and think about what they mean.
[28:07] He says, "The whole plan of redemption
[28:09] lays under these seals." The whole book.
[28:12] So the whole book, the whole plan,
[28:15] everything that God wanted to achieve
[28:17] lays under these seals. But you realize
[28:19] in the opening of the seals, the seals
[28:21] have to do with the church ages. Yes.
[28:25] Yes. Right. But the whole book, the
[28:28] mystery of the whole book lays under the
[28:29] seals.
[28:32] But the seals don't really have anything
[28:34] to do with the Old Testament.
[28:37] It's just the New Testament. So what is
[28:39] it that the New Testament has that's
[28:41] that lays the mystery of the whole book?
[28:43] Well, because brother Brandham, but
[28:45] Jesus Christ had already come and he
[28:48] manifest the purpose of the Old
[28:50] Testament. Because the purpose of the
[28:51] Old Testament was to find another Adam.
[28:54] Yeah. To find an Adam that could replace
[28:57] the Adam that had fallen, that had a
[28:59] right to the inheritance, the one that
[29:01] could pay the price of redemption and
[29:03] pay for the book and take back the book.
[29:05] So, the old inheritance, he tried it in
[29:08] Noah, failed, tried it in Moses, failed,
[29:10] tried it in David and failed. He was
[29:12] always trying to find, amen, that other
[29:14] son of God who could come and be the
[29:17] last Adam. And he found it in Jesus
[29:19] Christ. That closes that part of
[29:22] redemption. Now there's an Adam that has
[29:24] come and proved he was the right kind of
[29:26] son. And he was tested in every way so
[29:28] that he could be the lamb so that he
[29:30] could shed human blood and pay the price
[29:32] of redemption for humanity to buy back
[29:35] redemption. That's done. But that's not
[29:37] the end of the story because remember
[29:39] what was lost in Eden was not just Adam
[29:42] but Adam's wife was lost too. So now
[29:44] there has to be a manifestation of that
[29:46] wife. And that's what's laying under
[29:48] these seals. That revelation and that
[29:51] manifestation of the further part of
[29:54] Adam's expression, the further part of
[29:56] the last Adam has to come forth because
[29:59] redemption is not complete until we
[30:01] complete what was lost in Eden. Amen.
[30:05] So that's why there's another mystery.
[30:08] The mystery secure in him. God wants to
[30:10] come in flesh. God has a son of God upon
[30:12] the earth. The book is in him. Why is
[30:15] the book in him? He's the fullness of
[30:17] the word. What is the word? The
[30:19] attributes of God. What are the children
[30:21] of God? The attributes of God. What are
[30:23] you? An attribute of God. What are you
[30:26] part of the word? Where were you? You
[30:28] were in him and the book was secure in
[30:31] him. Amen.
[30:34] The book was redeemed in him. The book
[30:37] was paid for in him. The book was
[30:39] expressed in him. But there had to come
[30:41] another expression sir of the book. And
[30:46] until that expression was finished, it
[30:48] came forth out of Pentecost as a as a
[30:51] virgin bride fresh from the hands of
[30:53] God. But before he could come to her fur
[30:56] to to fulfill the full expression of
[30:58] that female, she was already a fallen
[31:00] woman. Yeah. And so what was that?
[31:03] That's that was the seals
[31:06] that laid that revelation hidden away
[31:11] under the seals because the church ages
[31:13] destroyed that revelation of who the
[31:15] church really is. Amen. Amen.
[31:20] God knew it would be like that. That's
[31:21] why as soon as the church ages started,
[31:23] we have the church ages started in
[31:25] Ephesus in 1953. And now we have the
[31:28] revelation that there's a book and that
[31:30] there's seals comes forth in 90 AD 96 in
[31:33] John when he writes the letter. So God
[31:35] at the very beginning of the church ages
[31:37] goes ahead and spells out there's going
[31:39] to be seven church ages. It's going to
[31:40] be sealed away. But don't you worry,
[31:42] there's a redemption coming for this
[31:44] part of the book as well. It's got to be
[31:47] expressed and redeemed.
[31:50] So the the redemption
[31:54] uh lays under the seal the whole plan of
[31:57] redemption. It doesn't mean that Jesus
[32:00] Christ wasn't the fullness of the word
[32:02] but there was a part of that word that
[32:04] had to come into further expression
[32:08] and that will reveal the remaining part
[32:12] of the mystery of God.
[32:15] So the hidden mysteries of Christ was
[32:18] fully revealed in the seven seals. But
[32:21] Christ was fully revealed in Jesus
[32:23] Christ. Yes. Amen. Right. But there was
[32:28] another revelation to come forth of
[32:30] Christ. Amen. And that was the female
[32:32] expression of Christ, his wife. And
[32:35] that's what was hidden under those
[32:39] seals. Amen. So I we read the quote. I
[32:42] don't have it here. We read the quote
[32:43] last time. Brother Benham said that book
[32:45] of redemption the New Testament.
[32:48] He said not the old the only declared
[32:51] foreshadowed for the new. It's like what
[32:53] do you mean the New Testament the book
[32:54] of I thought the book of redemption had
[32:56] everything. Amen. It does but now what
[33:00] needs to be expressed is the New
[33:01] Testament. Remember brother Brandon said
[33:02] the Old Testament was male. The New
[33:05] Testament is female. The Old Testament
[33:06] is bridegroom. The New Testament is
[33:08] bride. He came and fulfilled the Old
[33:12] Testament in the masterpiece. Brother
[33:13] Brandham said he was building back this
[33:15] image of a perfect man, the masterpiece
[33:17] that had fallen because Adam was the
[33:19] perfect man, the son of God. Amen. With
[33:21] the title D book of the inheritance, the
[33:23] book of life. Amen. But he lost it when
[33:26] he fell. So God immediately started
[33:28] rebuilding his masterpiece. And he
[33:30] brought it up through the patriarchs was
[33:31] the pedestal that he set it on. Amen.
[33:33] And from the patriarchs, he started
[33:34] building back the body. And he said that
[33:36] body was the word which was the prophets
[33:38] coming through Noah and Moses and
[33:40] Abraham and all these prophets. And he
[33:42] was, what was he doing? Is building
[33:43] back. What was he building back? He was
[33:45] building back the image that had fallen.
[33:47] And what was that? A son of God.
[33:50] And finally, he capped it off. He capped
[33:53] the whole thing off. The whole
[33:54] masterpiece when Jesus Christ came to be
[33:57] the fulfillment of it all. So what God
[33:59] was doing in the Old Testament, he
[34:01] finished and completed in Jesus Christ.
[34:06] But then he would strike a blow
[34:09] on the side of that masterpiece. So out
[34:11] of that could come blood and water so
[34:13] that he could finish the masterpiece
[34:15] family. He had the masterpiece son, but
[34:18] what he lost was a masterpiece family.
[34:20] So now he's got to finish the
[34:21] masterpiece family. That's the He said
[34:24] he he struck a little part and a part
[34:25] come off the New Testament. That's all.
[34:28] Yeah. What came off of him? The New
[34:30] Testament. Listen, don't think about
[34:33] Bible verses and don't think about books
[34:35] of the Bible. Amen. Look at the Bible.
[34:37] Amen. And the brother Ben Brandham said
[34:39] that these seals when these seals open
[34:41] it it unlocked the entire Bible because
[34:44] the Bible is a book of redemption. The
[34:46] Bible is a book of life. But what is the
[34:48] book Adam had? He had the Bible.
[34:51] Right? Listen, don't I don't want you to
[34:53] think individual verses and individual
[34:55] books. I want you to think this Bible is
[34:58] the record of God's children as they
[35:00] started coming down. What was in that
[35:02] secret mysterious book was being
[35:04] manifest on the earth. and and and Noah
[35:07] and Abraham and Moses. He said it was
[35:10] Christ and Moses, Christ and Noah,
[35:12] Christ and David. What was it? What is
[35:14] your Bible? Your Bible is the book of
[35:17] life. Brother Brim says so.
[35:25] Oh, praise God, friends.
[35:28] That's why when the seals come off, it
[35:30] unlocked the entire Bible, the whole
[35:32] plan of redemption. And he brought back
[35:34] the masterpiece man. Then he starts
[35:36] working and he says through seven church
[35:38] ages he's been building back a bride.
[35:41] But at the end of the church ages, he's
[35:44] going to cap it all off.
[35:47] And it's going to be the completion of
[35:49] the bride or the bride in full view.
[35:53] Oh, Brother Franco, can we go to the
[35:55] whiteboard? I hope that we can. I'm
[35:58] really I'm really testing Brother Franco
[36:02] today. Make a PowerPoint last minute.
[36:05] Switch over to
[36:07] whiteboard. Brother Brandham shows it
[36:09] like this. If we if we take a
[36:13] pyramid, an uncapped pyramid, an
[36:16] uncapped pyramid is not a pyramid. Amen.
[36:20] Because it's not the right shape. It's
[36:23] close to being a pyramid, but it's not a
[36:24] pyramid. So, when you take the
[36:27] capstone and you put the capstone on,
[36:30] now it's a pyramid. Amen. Right.
[36:33] But let's look at this right here. What
[36:36] is a capstone?
[36:38] A capstone is the full pyramid in
[36:41] miniature. Amen. It's a picture of the
[36:44] whole thing in one form. So a a capstone
[36:48] is the entire revelation of the whole
[36:51] pyramid. But the pyramid's not a pyramid
[36:54] without the capstone. But when the
[36:55] capstone completes the pyramid, it
[36:57] completes the whole thing. So what
[36:59] completes the pyramid? A little pyramid.
[37:01] a perfect picture of the whole image is
[37:03] what completes the whole image. So when
[37:06] Christ Jesus came down and capped it
[37:08] off, he capped off the whole Old
[37:10] Testament. We know what the whole thing
[37:11] was about. It was about restoring fallen
[37:14] man. Amen. That's the Old Testament. But
[37:17] in the New Testament, remember brother
[37:20] Bam draws a stature of a perfect man. In
[37:22] the stature of perfect man, he comes up
[37:23] to a pyramid again. So the New
[37:25] Testament, seven church ages been
[37:26] building back the pyramid. But the
[37:28] pyramid's not a pyramid without the
[37:30] capstone.
[37:32] But what's the capstone?
[37:35] Oh, praise God. What's the capstone? The
[37:40] capstone is the whole pyramid. Amen. A
[37:44] perfect pyramid, the perfect image of
[37:46] the pyramid, the perfect depiction of
[37:48] the pyramid. And the pyramid is not a
[37:50] pyramid without a capstone. But the
[37:51] capstone is the pyramid in small form.
[37:54] So what is the end time bride? She's the
[37:56] New Testament. That's all she is. She's
[37:59] the fullness of the New Testament.
[38:01] Everything the New Testament declared.
[38:03] Everything Christ bought back forth.
[38:05] Everything the church was supposed to be
[38:06] is supposed to be in the end time bride.
[38:09] She's the capping off of that pyramid.
[38:11] It's not her alone. It's him. The
[38:13] capstone coming in her. That's what we
[38:15] saw with the white wigged one before we
[38:17] knew it was the headship of Christ. We
[38:19] knew it was the capping stone. The
[38:21] pyramid coming down upon the church.
[38:23] What was that pyramid? That was he
[38:25] himself, the full revelation of the
[38:27] word, returning back to make a perfect
[38:29] bride to cap off the New Testament.
[38:33] That's what's laying under these seals.
[38:35] Amen. Praise the Lord. Glory. Amen.
[38:40] Yeah. Praise be to God. Can we go back
[38:42] to the PowerPoint?
[38:44] Oh, praise God. So, what is the end time
[38:49] bride? She's not Leodysian. Amen. That's
[38:53] right. Amen. Because that's not a
[38:55] finished picture. Amen. She's got to go
[38:58] beyond Leodysia and she's got to move
[39:01] into into that perfect image of Christ.
[39:04] Christ has to come down and become his
[39:06] own bride. Amen. His life in her
[39:09] manifesting his life in her. That's what
[39:12] we're called to, friends. That's the
[39:13] dispensation that we're in. That we are
[39:15] supposed to be the reflection of the
[39:17] entire New Testament
[39:20] living in a people at the end time.
[39:23] And that's the capping off of the
[39:26] church. And when it's complete and when
[39:27] it's finished, it'll bring the
[39:29] resurrection of the entire pyramid is
[39:30] what brother Ben says. Amen.
[39:37] Amen. The breach. This is a long one, so
[39:40] just hang with me. And if you go to
[39:42] sleep, I'll make you stand up and read
[39:44] it out
[39:45] loud. I'm going to be a mean teacher
[39:48] today. The breach. Now see the mystery
[39:52] of this seven sealed book will be
[39:53] revealed at the sounding of the seven
[39:55] church angels message. Have we heard the
[39:57] seventh church angel?
[39:59] So the mystery of the seven sealed book
[40:01] will be revealed
[40:03] then the seven angels the seventh angel
[40:06] begins to sound and there's the message
[40:08] wrote out there and we got it on tape in
[40:10] book form. Now at the beginning of the
[40:12] sounding of the message the mystery of
[40:14] God should be finished at that time. Now
[40:16] we will notice the book of mystery of
[40:18] God is not revealed until the seventh
[40:20] angel's message is sounded. Now these
[40:22] points will be important in the seals
[40:24] I'm sure because it must every bit tie
[40:26] together. Now it's wrote mysterious
[40:29] because no man nowhere knows it. God
[40:31] alone Jesus Christ. See now but it is a
[40:35] book a mysterious book. It's a book of
[40:37] redemption. We'll get to that in a
[40:39] little while. And now we know that this
[40:41] book of redemption will not be
[40:42] thoroughly understood. It's probed at
[40:44] through six church ages. But at the end
[40:46] when the seventh angel begins to sound
[40:48] his mystery, he winds up all of those
[40:50] loose ends that those fellows probed at.
[40:53] And the mysteries come down from God as
[40:55] the word of God and reveals the entire
[40:58] revelation of God. Amen. So what was the
[41:01] restoration of the word? To reveal the
[41:03] entire revelation of God.
[41:05] Well, isn't that what the seventh angel
[41:07] supposed to do? Finish the mystery of
[41:09] God. Amen.
[41:12] uh then the Godhead and everything else
[41:14] is settled. All the mysteries, serpent
[41:15] seed, and whatever more is to be
[41:18] revealed. Now, you see, I'm not just I'm
[41:20] just not making that up. That it's thus
[41:22] sayeth the Lord. I'll read it to you out
[41:24] of the book. The sounding of the seventh
[41:25] angel's message, the mystery of God
[41:27] should be finished. That's been declared
[41:29] by his holy prophets. That's the
[41:31] prophets who has wrote the word. At the
[41:33] sounding of the seventh church age, the
[41:35] last church age, all those loose ends
[41:37] that through these church ages have been
[41:38] probed at will be wound up together. And
[41:41] when the seals are broke and the mystery
[41:43] is revealed, down comes the angel, the
[41:46] messenger, Christ, setting his foot upon
[41:48] the land and upon the sea with a rainbow
[41:50] over his head. Now remember this seventh
[41:53] angel is on earth at the time of this
[41:55] coming. So has he come?
[41:58] Absolutely friends, he has come. And
[42:01] what form did he come in? He came in the
[42:03] fullness of the word, bringing the full
[42:04] restoration of the Holy Ghost life to do
[42:07] what? To come back and fill a people on
[42:09] the earth in the end time to finish the
[42:11] image of the bride.
[42:15] That was the mystery that was laying
[42:17] under those seals. Those seals each
[42:20] contained a mystery. And that mystery
[42:22] was the revelation of what the symbols
[42:24] were. What is a white horse rider? Who
[42:26] is the first beast, the lion beast?
[42:28] What's the anointing? What does it do
[42:30] for the church? Every one of those seals
[42:32] contains a mystery. And he came and
[42:34] revealed that mystery. That's what the
[42:35] seven thunders is all about. And
[42:37] revealing what the mystery was of the
[42:39] seven seals. That was the sounding of
[42:41] the seven thunders which brother Benham
[42:42] ties together with the seventh seal. So
[42:44] what's the seven seals? The coming of
[42:46] the Lord. Only the lamb can take the
[42:49] book and open the seals and reveal the
[42:51] contents. So the sounding of the seven
[42:53] thunders which weren't wrote when John
[42:55] heard it in Revelations 10. It was
[42:57] sealed up till the time of the end. Now
[43:00] we know when those seven thunders are
[43:02] revealed, which tells us what's a white
[43:04] horse, what's the lion anointing, what's
[43:07] a red horse. Amen. What are all these
[43:09] anointings? Ox anointing, man anointing,
[43:10] pale horse, black horse. And when he
[43:12] begins to tell us about the souls under
[43:13] the altar and the tribulation, what is
[43:15] all that? Then we know for sure we're in
[43:17] the end time and he has come and the
[43:19] lamb has taken the book and revealed,
[43:22] the mysteries of the seals. Amen.
[43:25] But he took the seals off the book.
[43:31] So we could see the mystery in the book.
[43:36] Because there's been a mystery in the
[43:38] book. There's been a mystery in this
[43:41] book from Genesis to Revelation.
[43:44] And the mystery of the book is the
[43:46] seventh seal.
[43:48] What's the seventh seal? The coming of
[43:51] the Lord. Amen. He's been coming from
[43:53] Genesis and all the way down through as
[43:55] a family of God upon the earth.
[43:58] Amen. So what was the mystery laying on
[44:01] his heels? Remember the
[44:03] the brother Brandham comes and through
[44:06] the prophetic gift, Amen. God uses him
[44:09] and speaks to him and Jesus Christ
[44:11] breaks the seals and brings the
[44:13] interpretation. Brother Brandham at the
[44:14] end of the seals he says now don't thank
[44:16] any man. No man had anything to do with
[44:18] this. He wants you to know this isn't
[44:20] inspiration. Amen. This wasn't I caught
[44:22] something. Amen. This was he himself
[44:25] came every day and told me word for word
[44:27] and show me in a vision what this is. He
[44:29] wants you to know at the end of the
[44:30] seals. Don't say thank you to brother
[44:32] Brandham. Don't say he opened the seals.
[44:34] No. Because nobody but the lamb can take
[44:36] the book and open the seals. So it's got
[44:38] to be evident it wasn't a man. He just
[44:40] saw. He wrote and he came out and he
[44:43] told you what he saw. Amen. This was all
[44:46] done by the lamb.
[44:48] But you realize when he comes to the
[44:49] seventh seal, he doesn't give you any
[44:52] information on the seventh seal.
[44:55] That's right. Amen.
[44:58] Because the seventh seal is the mystery
[45:01] laying under the seals. That's why he
[45:04] doesn't break the seventh seal the same
[45:05] way he breaks the six seals. The six
[45:07] seals, you see, I broke it. This horse
[45:09] went, this person said, this bow, this
[45:12] arrows, and he gives interpretations to
[45:14] all those symbols. But in Revelation
[45:16] chapter 8, when he opens the seventh
[45:18] seal, there's silence in heaven for the
[45:20] space of half an hour. Nothing's wrote,
[45:22] nothing spoke. And brother Bram ties it
[45:23] together to the seven thunders where
[45:25] nothing something spoke but nothing's
[45:27] wrote. You don't know what it is. And he
[45:28] ties the two together so that you know
[45:30] the opening of the seventh seal is
[45:32] attached to the sounding of the seven
[45:34] thunders. That's the first part of the
[45:36] opening of the seal. But what is the
[45:39] mystery of the seventh seal? The mystery
[45:41] of the seventh seal is the coming of the
[45:42] Lord. That's the mystery contained in
[45:45] the entire book.
[45:49] That's the seven seal. That's the great
[45:51] mystery laying under the seals.
[45:54] That's what it
[45:55] is. And it was sealed up with these
[46:00] seals of the church ages. And what those
[46:02] seals were was showing the Antichrist
[46:04] spirit that polluted the church, but how
[46:06] God was keeping her all the way through
[46:09] so that at the end he could take the
[46:10] veil off and show her who she really is.
[46:14] That she is part of
[46:17] Christ, not something
[46:19] else. She's part of Christ. She's part
[46:21] of the word. She's part of the family of
[46:23] God. She's part of the expression of
[46:25] God. And she had to catch the mystery of
[46:29] who she is because she has to know she's
[46:32] part of Christ because she has to catch
[46:33] the mystery of Christ.
[46:35] Amen. Amen. All right, let's keep
[46:38] moving.
[46:40] The feast of trumpets. This is the
[46:42] complete revelation of Jesus Christ.
[46:44] Brother Van Pata's Bible and the seven
[46:46] seals had the mystery hid of what it all
[46:48] was and is supposed to open it in the
[46:51] last day of the Leodysian age at the end
[46:52] time. Thanks be to God. That finishes
[46:55] the message to the church. That finishes
[46:57] it. When they look back and see what has
[46:59] been and see where it's all brought up
[47:01] to, that finishes it. The age of the
[47:04] church. So, at the opening of those six
[47:06] seals, when he goes back and he shows
[47:08] the church history and what happened in
[47:09] every category person and how they're
[47:10] taken care of, that finishes the age of
[47:13] the church. That's done. That moves you
[47:14] into the bride age. Now, it's time for
[47:16] the invisible union. And it's time for
[47:18] the headship to unite with the body.
[47:20] Because when the revelation comes off
[47:22] the book of what got messed up and where
[47:24] it went wrong and who did it and how the
[47:26] antichrist spirit did and how God took
[47:28] care of it and how everything's covered
[47:29] and when they look back and see what's
[47:32] been and he reveals it all that finishes
[47:34] the age of the church right there. It's
[47:36] done now. Now you move into the bride
[47:37] age. It's time for the marriage union.
[47:40] It's time for the headship to come. It's
[47:42] time for the manifestation of the bride.
[47:46] Not a church anymore.
[47:49] Amen. Why? Because she's part of the
[47:54] mystery
[47:55] of God. Amen. And it has to be
[48:00] expressed souls that are in prison now.
[48:03] And what about you church that what
[48:05] about six or eight months ago here
[48:06] standing here saying it's thus sayaith
[48:08] the Lord that I'm going to Tucson,
[48:10] Arizona. There'll be a blast and seven
[48:12] angels will appear. You remember not
[48:15] even God making it so real until the
[48:17] Look magazine look took the picture of
[48:19] it. Spiritual foresaw materialized just
[48:22] exactly the same. The seven angels which
[48:25] brought forth the winding up of all the
[48:26] scriptures cuz all the mysteries of the
[48:28] entire Bible lays in the seven seals. I
[48:32] want you to think about that. Okay,
[48:34] we've heard that a lot. But let's think
[48:36] about it. What was the information that
[48:39] came out in the opening of the seals? It
[48:41] had to do with what happened in the last
[48:43] 2,000 years in the church ages. But he
[48:47] said all the mysteries of the entire
[48:49] Bible lays in the seven seals. Amen.
[48:55] I know, friends. I know. I can't explain
[48:57] it either.
[49:00] Don't look at me and wait for me to
[49:01] absolutely interpret this to you. I
[49:03] can't interpret to you. What I'm telling
[49:04] you is that revelation is the restored
[49:07] masterpiece. what God was doing. He
[49:10] foreshadowed in Eden. When he come to
[49:11] Eden, he said, "It's very good." And he
[49:13] went and took his rest. That's the
[49:14] picture.
[49:16] That's the image. That's a picture from
[49:18] his mind on display. The artist
[49:20] displayed his masterpiece family. It
[49:22] fell into ruin. He left his rest and he
[49:24] started building it back. And for 4,000
[49:26] years, he built it back to the perfect
[49:28] man, the last Adam. And then from him,
[49:30] he took a piece and he started working
[49:31] on the female to bring back the image
[49:33] back together of a perfect family to
[49:35] bring him back into an Eden condition in
[49:37] the millennium so that he could take his
[49:39] thousand-year rest which was interrupted
[49:41] by the fall so that the cycle is
[49:43] complete. That's what redemption is all
[49:44] about. Amen. So that means every mystery
[49:48] of the Bible laid under those seven
[49:50] seals because every mystery has to do
[49:53] with this story. Amen. Every mystery,
[49:56] every doctrine, every truth, every
[49:59] character, everything that's in the
[50:00] Bible has to do with this revelation.
[50:03] God made a masterpiece, a perfect image.
[50:05] It fell. And he's been working for 6,000
[50:07] years to bring it back. And at the end
[50:09] time, he's going to bring a union back
[50:10] of the man and the woman, the restored
[50:12] wife and Adam together, so that he can
[50:14] bring them back to millennium so that he
[50:15] can take his rest and turn the rulership
[50:17] back over to his son and his son's bride
[50:19] for a thousand years. Yeah. And every
[50:22] doctrine, every truth, every character
[50:25] has to do with that revelation. That's
[50:27] why brother Brandham said, "Amen." Under
[50:29] those seals at the revealing of the
[50:30] seals, that opened up every truth in the
[50:32] Bible, serpent seed.
[50:35] He was preaching serpent seed decades
[50:37] before the opening of the seals. But
[50:39] that mystery lays under the seals
[50:41] because serpent seed has everything to
[50:42] do with this story. The oneness of the
[50:45] God had everything to do with this
[50:46] story. Who Jesus Christ is everything to
[50:49] do with this story. Who the brightest?
[50:51] Everything to do with this story.
[50:52] Marriage and divorce. Everything to do
[50:54] with this story. Amen. Marriage and
[50:56] divorce is describing what Christ did
[50:59] through the church ages.
[51:03] So every truth of the Bible was laying
[51:08] under these seals. Yeah. Because
[51:11] everything in the Bible has to do with
[51:13] this picture. Amen.
[51:17] Every doctrine,
[51:19] every truth.
[51:21] That's why water baptism is in the name
[51:23] of Jesus Christ. Amen. Because water
[51:26] baptism, brother Bam, types with
[51:28] marriage. That's right. That's right.
[51:30] Water baptism has to do water baptism
[51:33] has to do with taking an identification
[51:35] with the headship of Jesus Christ. And
[51:37] I'm going down and being washed away
[51:39] from my old life and I'm coming back.
[51:41] That's why you're baptized in the name
[51:43] of Jesus Christ. Meaning now I'm coming
[51:46] forth as a new creature, belonging,
[51:48] identifying under the headship of Jesus
[51:50] Christ. It's a marriage, friends. It has
[51:52] to do with it has to do with
[51:54] identification. I'm no longer identified
[51:56] with my old life. I'm identified with
[51:58] Jesus Christ. And water baptism has
[52:00] everything to do with this picture.
[52:02] Amen. Right. You can see you can see the
[52:07] fruitlessness of arguing about doctrine
[52:09] and what's right and what's wrong and
[52:10] what's this. Because if you don't have
[52:12] this picture, it doesn't matter how much
[52:14] you argue about marriage and divorce and
[52:16] how much you argue about serpency and
[52:18] how much you argue about water baptism.
[52:20] It's at the end of the day, it's
[52:21] absolutely fruitless. If you don't have
[52:23] this picture,
[52:25] if you don't know what it's all about,
[52:27] it's all about God manifesting himself
[52:30] on the earth as a son and his son's
[52:32] wife, as a family upon the earth in
[52:34] unity and harmony, expressing the very
[52:36] life of God.
[52:38] That's the whole picture, friends.
[52:40] Hallelujah. And if you don't have that,
[52:43] what's the point in getting your PhD in
[52:45] serpent seat?
[52:50] Amen.
[52:53] Praise be to
[52:55] God. So, you can line up so many things
[52:58] and miss the point.
[53:03] Amen. This is why we can line up so many
[53:06] things and just go to church on Sunday
[53:09] and just go to church on Wednesday and
[53:10] I'm a message believer because I believe
[53:12] certain fundamental doctrines, but I
[53:14] still have my own ambitions in life and
[53:15] I want a career and I want a house and I
[53:17] want to go here and I want to do these
[53:18] things and I want to play these things
[53:19] and have my fun here, but I'm a message
[53:21] believer. No, you missed the whole
[53:23] picture. The whole picture is not about
[53:25] coming to church on Sunday and
[53:26] Wednesday. The whole picture is not
[53:28] having a good life and going to the
[53:30] whole picture is about manifesting the
[53:32] bride of Jesus Christ in your life.
[53:34] Giving him dominion over you so that
[53:36] that word can be expressed to this
[53:38] generation. Amen. It's nothing to do
[53:41] with church attendance. It has nothing
[53:42] to do with a system or a program. Has
[53:44] nothing to do with correct doctrinal
[53:46] teaching. All of that goes together to
[53:48] express
[53:50] the life of Jesus Christ. God. So just
[53:53] coming to church and I believe brother
[53:55] Ram was a prophet and I believe servants
[53:56] sees the truth and I believe it but
[53:58] you've missed this revelation.
[54:00] Amen.
[54:02] Then we're going to always be tied up
[54:04] somewhere and tangled up in something.
[54:06] Right. Missing the whole point. And
[54:09] catching the point makes everything else
[54:11] make sense.
[54:13] Amen. Catching the point makes personal
[54:15] surrender to the word easy. Amen.
[54:20] When you understand that your life is
[54:21] bigger than you can ever imagine. When
[54:24] you when you realize that there's a
[54:26] portion of God waiting to be expressed
[54:27] in your soul and that God has entrusted
[54:29] that portion into you and he sent his
[54:31] spirit in the end time with the truth to
[54:33] awaken that to bring a manifestation.
[54:35] And now all of a sudden your life is not
[54:37] your own. And all the little things that
[54:38] frustrate and have money don't have
[54:40] money and have a good job don't have a
[54:41] good job. None of that matters anymore
[54:43] because that's not the point of my
[54:45] existence. That's not why I'm here.
[54:47] That's not my purpose on being on earth.
[54:52] Hallelujah. This revelation changes
[54:54] everything.
[54:56] Which was the revelation contained in
[54:58] the seven seals.
[55:02] Whether I have a promotion or don't get
[55:04] a promotion, how does it change who I
[55:07] am? Amen. Whether the housing market
[55:10] goes up or the housing market goes down,
[55:11] whether I lose my retirement game or how
[55:14] can that change the revelation of who I
[55:17] am?
[55:20] The message the seat is not there with
[55:22] the shook. This is another long one.
[55:24] Let's we want to read together.
[55:29] Notice there will be no more carrier
[55:31] mother churches denominations after the
[55:33] carrier shuck because after the shuck
[55:35] there is no more nothing left but then
[55:38] but just the grain. That's the same life
[55:41] that went into the ground. That's the
[55:42] life of
[55:43] Christ. Is that right? It's got to be
[55:46] the grain. It's got to be the same kind
[55:47] that went into the ground. Jesus Christ
[55:49] is saying yesterday, today, and forever
[55:51] a spirit come upon the bride to do the
[55:53] same things that he did. See, it's the
[55:56] reproducing again of the grain. Remember
[55:59] the Holy Ghost was bound by these
[56:01] denomination waters for nearly 2,000
[56:02] years. But at the evening time has been
[56:04] loosed by the evening time message. The
[56:05] Holy Ghost back in the people again to
[56:08] do what? To reproduce the grain, which
[56:11] is the life of Christ.
[56:13] It's the reproducing again of the grain.
[56:15] The word yet young. Now he's referring
[56:18] back to Jesus Christ. The word yet young
[56:20] spake for itself. I know not and know
[56:23] not that I must be about my father's
[56:25] business. He's referring back to when
[56:26] Jesus was 12 years old disputing with
[56:29] the scribes in the temple when his
[56:30] parents found him there and and they and
[56:33] Mary made the mistake of saying thy
[56:34] father and I has sought thee with ears
[56:36] and he says you know not that I must be
[56:38] about my father's business. So at 12
[56:41] years old he was declaring that he was
[56:43] about his father's business. Now listen
[56:45] what brother Bam says there is the
[56:47] secret of the message now.
[56:52] Did brother Bam just tell us the secret
[56:53] of the message now? What is the secret?
[56:56] And what Jesus declared when he was 12
[56:58] years old. Don't you know that I'm
[57:02] supposed to be about my father's? You
[57:03] don't you know that my only purpose for
[57:05] being on this planet is to be about my
[57:08] father's business. That's the secret of
[57:10] the message, friends. Amen.
[57:14] He says, now there's the secret of the
[57:16] message. Now, just exactly the father's
[57:18] business. What is the father's business?
[57:21] Could you think of what the father's
[57:22] business was in him? in him to fulfill
[57:26] what Isaiah said, "A virgin shall
[57:28] conceive." So what was the father's
[57:30] business? The revealing of the word, the
[57:32] manifestation of the word, where the
[57:34] word took on life. Yes. Amen. A virgin
[57:37] shall conceive, fulfilling what Isaiah
[57:39] said, the lame shall leap like a heart,
[57:40] and all these things would take place.
[57:42] Like Moses said, "The Lord your God
[57:44] should raise up a prophet among you like
[57:45] an unto me." I It was the father's
[57:48] business to fulfill the word. Well, if
[57:50] that come down through them stalks of
[57:52] them natural women, what about these
[57:55] stalks of these spiritual church women?
[57:57] Churches means women. Women means
[57:59] churches rather. Is that right? Then
[58:01] what is it now? We must be about the
[58:04] father's business. The wheat would cry
[58:06] back the grain. Yes, sir. What must it
[58:09] do? Vindicate Malachi 4. Vindicate Luke
[58:13] 17:30. Vindicate Hebrews 13:8. Vindicate
[58:16] St. John 14:12. Vindicate all his word.
[58:19] vindicate Hebrews I mean Revelation the
[58:21] 10th chapter of the opening of the seven
[58:22] seals and the mysteries of God even to
[58:25] the serpent seed and all would be
[58:26] manifested marriage and divorce and all
[58:28] these other mysteries that's been hid
[58:30] under the pillars for all these years
[58:32] from the theologians and so forth but is
[58:34] now it but it's now the hour that that's
[58:38] the father's business
[58:42] so what's the father's business for you
[58:44] and I to manifest Malachi 4 you say
[58:47] brother Brandon manifest it But I'm here
[58:49] to vindicate that that was the truth.
[58:51] Amen. How do I vindicate it? By being
[58:54] the bride of Jesus Christ. By giving him
[58:56] a vessel to manifest his life as bride
[58:59] in. Vindicates Malachi 4. Vindicates.
[59:02] Luke 17:30. The son of man. The
[59:03] revealing of the son of man vindicates.
[59:06] Amen. Hebrews 13:8. He's the same
[59:08] yesterday, today, and forever because
[59:09] it's the same life in me that was back
[59:11] there
[59:14] vindicates. Revelation 107.
[59:18] that the mystery of God is finished.
[59:22] Finished in the female form, united back
[59:25] to the male, going back to their Eden
[59:28] condition.
[59:31] That's the father's business. Anything
[59:34] that detracts from that is evil.
[59:38] Amen. Because it hinders what God has us
[59:42] here for.
[59:45] Let's go to Revelation 10:8. Now, you
[59:47] don't have to turn there. I've got it on
[59:48] the overhead. But, and the voice which I
[59:51] heard from heaven spake unto me again
[59:54] and said, "Go and take the little book
[59:57] which is open in the hand of the angel."
[59:59] See, after after the mystery of God is
[1:00:03] finished, after the sounding of the
[1:00:06] seven thunders, after the finishing of
[1:00:08] the mystery of God, now there's a
[1:00:10] commandment to John, which is a type of
[1:00:12] the
[1:00:12] bride. Now, you go and take the book.
[1:00:18] When the seals have come off, the
[1:00:20] thunders have been revealed. The mystery
[1:00:22] of God now is finished. Now you take the
[1:00:26] book and you eat it up and in your belly
[1:00:30] be bitter in your mouth, sweet as honey.
[1:00:32] And he took it and he ate it. It was
[1:00:33] sweet in his mouth, bitter in his
[1:00:36] belly. But now you take it and you eat
[1:00:39] it. And then it says in verse 11, "And
[1:00:41] he said unto me, thou must prophesy
[1:00:43] again before many peoples and nations
[1:00:46] and tongues and kings."
[1:00:50] See why this is a mysterious
[1:00:53] book? Brother Bam calls it the book of
[1:00:56] redemption.
[1:00:58] He calls it the book of life. He calls
[1:01:01] it the Bible. He calls it your marriage
[1:01:03] certificate.
[1:01:06] So the book of
[1:01:07] life is a record of life. It's a manif
[1:01:12] to to come into
[1:01:13] manifestation. And Adam had it but lost
[1:01:16] it and went back to God. God to keep it
[1:01:20] safe put it in the flesh of Jesus Christ
[1:01:23] to manifest the contents of the book.
[1:01:27] And now Jesus takes that out of the
[1:01:30] right hand of him that sat on the
[1:01:32] throne. And Jesus opens the seals and
[1:01:34] reveals the contents of the book. And
[1:01:36] then he comes down with a little book
[1:01:38] open. Amen. And now John's told to go
[1:01:41] eat the
[1:01:44] book. What a strange book.
[1:01:49] Amen. What is John supposed to do at the
[1:01:52] end time? He's supposed to take this
[1:01:56] revelation that's been unlocked in the
[1:01:58] end time and become one with it. Amen.
[1:02:02] That's right. To ingest it, to feed on
[1:02:04] it, to take it inside of himself.
[1:02:08] And what does he do once he takes it
[1:02:09] inside of himself and becomes one with
[1:02:11] it? It comes back out of him and he
[1:02:14] prophesies again. He's What is that?
[1:02:17] That's the father's business.
[1:02:21] That's what we're supposed to be doing.
[1:02:26] Now, it's a good question. Where's the
[1:02:28] book?
[1:02:32] Don't look to me to answer. I'm not
[1:02:33] going to answer that. Like I don't want
[1:02:35] to get in
[1:02:36] trouble. And saying the book's here,
[1:02:38] book's there. Listen, the book can be in
[1:02:41] multiple places at the same time.
[1:02:46] Because the book is the secret mystery
[1:02:48] in God's mind. Amen. That's been sealed
[1:02:52] away from man all this time. That
[1:02:53] everything in the Bible has been working
[1:02:55] towards this mystery. But in the end
[1:02:57] times, he takes it and he unveils it.
[1:03:00] And when he unveils it, we're commanded
[1:03:02] to eat it, to ingest it. It's it's
[1:03:06] Listen, it's the same thing as receiving
[1:03:09] seed. Amen. Receive the book into
[1:03:12] yourself, and then out of yourself will
[1:03:15] come the book. Amen. It's just like the
[1:03:17] woman in the marriage union receiving
[1:03:18] seed, then out of her comes the life of
[1:03:20] that seed. Amen. It's like a garden
[1:03:23] receiving a seed and bringing out the
[1:03:24] life of the seed. We're supposed to
[1:03:26] receive the book and bring forth the
[1:03:28] life of the book.
[1:03:30] And that's going to be a declaration to
[1:03:32] the world of what was in that book.
[1:03:35] Amen. How will they know the contents of
[1:03:37] the book when they see the bride? Yeah.
[1:03:39] Because she'll manifest what was in that
[1:03:41] book because she is the book. Because
[1:03:45] Christ is the book and she's part of
[1:03:47] Christ. And now Christ is where?
[1:03:51] In her. Amen. Where's the book? in her.
[1:03:56] All that God was, he poured into Christ.
[1:03:58] All that Christ was, he poured where?
[1:04:01] Into her. Where's the book?
[1:04:04] Amen. Where's the book? Right. Was it
[1:04:07] What's in the book? The book is the life
[1:04:09] of Christ. Christ is the mystery of God
[1:04:11] revealed. Where's the book? All that God
[1:04:14] was, he poured into Christ. So all of
[1:04:16] God was poured into Christ because
[1:04:18] Christ is the word made manifest. The
[1:04:19] anointed word manifest. Wherever the
[1:04:21] word is manifest, that's Christ. Because
[1:04:23] God is the originator of the word and on
[1:04:26] display of that word is Christ. So all
[1:04:29] that God was, his full thought, his full
[1:04:31] desire for expression. He poured into
[1:04:33] Christ the word. And wherever that word
[1:04:35] was manifest, that's Christ. And
[1:04:37] everything Christ is, he poured into the
[1:04:40] bride. Cuz what is she? She's the
[1:04:41] manifestation of the contents of the
[1:04:43] book in the end time because there's
[1:04:46] been an invisible union. The headship
[1:04:48] has come. Christ is dwelling in her. The
[1:04:50] fullness of the Holy Ghost has been
[1:04:52] unlocked and unleashed at the end of the
[1:04:54] church ages by the opening of the seals
[1:04:56] by the ministry of the seventh angel to
[1:04:58] do what? The Holy Ghost to come back.
[1:05:00] That's why brother Brennham couldn't
[1:05:02] preach token till after the seals.
[1:05:04] Because token is the full life. It's not
[1:05:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It's the
[1:05:08] Holy Ghost himself, the person of the
[1:05:10] Holy Ghost, Jesus Christ living in his
[1:05:13] body on earth now, which is a many
[1:05:15] membered bride body. Amen.
[1:05:20] So where's the book?
[1:05:23] It's in an earthn vessel.
[1:05:27] It's in an earthn vessel.
[1:05:32] Let's look at this
[1:05:34] scripture. But if our gospel be hid, it
[1:05:36] is hid to them that are lost. And whom
[1:05:38] the God of this world has blinded the
[1:05:40] minds of them which believe not, lest
[1:05:42] the light of the glorious gospel of
[1:05:44] Christ, who is the image of God, should
[1:05:46] shine unto them. For we preach not
[1:05:48] ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and
[1:05:50] ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.
[1:05:53] For God who commanded the light to shine
[1:05:55] out of darkness has shined in our
[1:05:57] hearts. This is revelation
[1:06:01] to give the light of the knowledge of
[1:06:04] the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[1:06:06] Christ. Amen.
[1:06:09] What is that? God made flesh. Amen. So
[1:06:13] the light of the knowledge of the glory
[1:06:15] of God. Where do you find the light of
[1:06:17] the knowledge of the glory of God to
[1:06:18] understand all the glory of God? Where
[1:06:20] do you find it? You find it in his son.
[1:06:22] Amen. God made flesh on the earth.
[1:06:27] Then listen. But we have this treasure
[1:06:32] in earthn vessels that the excellency of
[1:06:36] the power may be of God and not of us.
[1:06:39] So all that was in God, he poured into
[1:06:41] Christ. All that was in Christ, he
[1:06:42] poured into us. Amen. which is the
[1:06:44] knowledge of the glory of God. The light
[1:06:47] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[1:06:49] the face of Christ has been poured into
[1:06:50] us to do what? To prophesy again. Amen.
[1:06:57] Oh, I'm I got a few more minutes and I'm
[1:07:00] going to clip through these fast. I like
[1:07:02] I like having this so we can read them
[1:07:03] together and go quick. Oh God, this
[1:07:06] super sign. God. If the world can only
[1:07:08] see that the God and man are one, the
[1:07:11] super sign was that first man that God
[1:07:13] could come into. All that God was, he
[1:07:15] poured into Christ. And all Christ was,
[1:07:17] he poured into the church. Super sign,
[1:07:19] God and man together. That was to be the
[1:07:22] super sign of the last day when the
[1:07:24] entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the
[1:07:26] last day. Is that our day? Amen. So the
[1:07:30] super sign of the last day is God poured
[1:07:34] into man. The oneness of God in man. A
[1:07:38] super sign. A virgin shall conceive. And
[1:07:40] this conception when it's brought forth
[1:07:42] will be God manifest in the flesh. Super
[1:07:44] sign. They still don't believe it but it
[1:07:46] was anyhow. It's still a super sign.
[1:07:48] Notice super sign. They've got Superman
[1:07:50] today. They got fictions of Superman and
[1:07:52] all these other kind of super things.
[1:07:54] But the church has the church has got a
[1:07:57] super sign. God back in the church
[1:07:59] manifested in human flesh. God united
[1:08:02] with man his sure super sign. And he
[1:08:05] showed it in the flesh of his prophet in
[1:08:07] the end time. And he showed a super
[1:08:08] sign. He showed God in flesh again in
[1:08:11] the church in a prophet without
[1:08:13] question. That was God. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:18] Notice the eternal sign and unfailing
[1:08:20] sign. It will never fail. The the word
[1:08:23] and man became one. When God's word and
[1:08:25] man became one, as St. John the first
[1:08:27] chapter says, "In the beginning was the
[1:08:29] word and the word was with God and the
[1:08:31] word was God and the word was made flesh
[1:08:33] and dwelt among us." That's the super
[1:08:35] sign. Oh, if that was the super sign of
[1:08:38] that day when that same spirit that was
[1:08:40] on Jesus Christ comes into his church to
[1:08:43] manifest the written word for today,
[1:08:45] that is still the super sign.
[1:08:48] What's the super sign? When you manifest
[1:08:50] the word for your day, that's the super
[1:08:52] sign. When you become the bride of Jesus
[1:08:55] Christ, the end submitted to the word,
[1:08:57] living the word, manifesting the word,
[1:08:59] and nothing but the word, that's the
[1:09:01] super sign. Amen.
[1:09:03] When finished at the Leodysian age,
[1:09:05] according to Revelation 10, the mystery
[1:09:07] of all the Bible would be known to the
[1:09:10] bride. Sorry, not known, node.
[1:09:15] Doesn't take good English to get the
[1:09:16] revelation. It takes a gift from God.
[1:09:20] The mystery of the Bible would be node
[1:09:22] to the bride. Is that right? Revelation
[1:09:24] 10. Listen close now. Bride called out
[1:09:27] by the word. Christ himself calling out
[1:09:30] the bride. Hey, listen. When the true
[1:09:32] revelation of the word came forth, what
[1:09:34] called you? Christ himself called you.
[1:09:36] Because the word for this hour is your
[1:09:38] mate. It is. Amen. The revealed word for
[1:09:40] the hour is your bridegroom. And he
[1:09:44] called you to his side by what? By
[1:09:46] revealing himself. By revealing the
[1:09:48] mysteries. By revealing the mystery of
[1:09:49] God. That was your bridegroom calling.
[1:09:52] That was Christ himself cuz he's the
[1:09:54] only one that can take the book and
[1:09:56] loose the seal. Amen.
[1:10:01] Making plain Hebrews 13:8 that he's the
[1:10:03] same yesterday, today, forever. Does the
[1:10:06] same is the
[1:10:08] same. Satan's he says, "And so God knew
[1:10:11] that we would be here, but then he put
[1:10:14] us in flesh so we could be contacted. in
[1:10:16] order he could contact. He became one of
[1:10:18] us when he became Jesus Christ, the son
[1:10:20] of God himself, the fullness of the
[1:10:21] manifestation of God. Therefore, that
[1:10:24] was God's purpose to display his
[1:10:26] attributes in fellowship. So, what was
[1:10:28] God's purpose in the beginning? To
[1:10:30] display his attributes and fellowship.
[1:10:32] What are his attributes? His word. What
[1:10:34] is his word? You and I. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:38] We're also his attributes.
[1:10:40] When I was in my father, I knew nothing
[1:10:42] about it. But when I became a son, I was
[1:10:44] born of him. I was an attribute, a part
[1:10:46] of my father and you're a part of your
[1:10:48] father. And as children of God, we are
[1:10:50] part of God's attribute that was in him,
[1:10:53] made flesh like he was made flesh. So we
[1:10:55] can have fellowship one with the other
[1:10:57] as a family of God upon the earth. And
[1:11:00] that was God's purpose at the beginning.
[1:11:02] Yes, sir. That's what God wanted at the
[1:11:05] beginning. Amen. And that's what Adam
[1:11:09] was given the book for, to make that
[1:11:11] purpose come to pass. Amen. And that's
[1:11:14] why he lost the book when he lost the
[1:11:16] ability to make that to come to pass in
[1:11:17] perfection.
[1:11:19] But Christ is doing it spiritually and
[1:11:23] he's bringing it to pass. That's why he
[1:11:25] has the book and that's why at the end
[1:11:27] time he gives the book to us
[1:11:31] and we receive the book and manifest the
[1:11:34] book.
[1:11:41] He says now and now remember you
[1:11:43] Christians were his thoughts before
[1:11:44] there was a world and you are the
[1:11:47] manifestation of his thinking before
[1:11:49] there even was a world you were in
[1:11:50] Christ in God in the beginning that
[1:11:53] makes you then see his subjects and the
[1:11:55] whole thing is God himself materializing
[1:11:58] himself tangible so he could be handled
[1:12:01] seen and so forth and that's what God is
[1:12:04] the whole thing.
[1:12:07] Amen. It's what God is. The whole thing,
[1:12:11] the whole book coming into manifestation
[1:12:14] is God becoming tangible.
[1:12:19] That was his purpose at the beginning.
[1:12:21] That's what's being redeemed and
[1:12:23] restored
[1:12:26] back identification. He says, "Then see
[1:12:28] God come down and the character of God
[1:12:30] was Christ. He was the reflection. He
[1:12:32] was God made visible." Notice God made
[1:12:34] visible in the beginning was God. He
[1:12:36] wasn't even God then. No, God is an
[1:12:37] object of worship. Only thing he was was
[1:12:39] the eternal and in him was attributes
[1:12:41] and those attributes were thoughts and
[1:12:43] those thoughts was expressed to words
[1:12:45] and word has been was made manifest.
[1:12:47] What is it? It's all God becoming
[1:12:50] tangible and you are a part of God.
[1:12:54] That means you're a part of that book
[1:12:56] and you have to come to an expression.
[1:12:59] Amen. All right. Now, we're going to
[1:13:02] lead lead this. We're going to finish up
[1:13:04] with this and one other I think Christ
[1:13:07] is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:13:09] Revelation 10:7 is about what? In the
[1:13:12] days, let's read it again. Revelation
[1:13:15] 10:7, but in the days of the voice of
[1:13:17] the seventh angel, when he shall begin
[1:13:19] to sound, the mystery of God should be
[1:13:21] finished. Amen.
[1:13:23] So, brother Brandham when he comes to
[1:13:25] the seventh seal, he doesn't feel to say
[1:13:27] no more and he gives some typology and
[1:13:29] parables and stories and he moves on.
[1:13:32] But when he comes back to this message
[1:13:35] in July 28th in 1963, he preaches the
[1:13:38] seventh seal. Amen. And it's evident he
[1:13:40] does by the opening what he says in the
[1:13:42] opening. So when he preaches the seventh
[1:13:45] seal which is the mystery of God
[1:13:47] finished, what does he title this
[1:13:49] message? Yeah, Christ is the mystery of
[1:13:54] God revealed. So what is the fulfillment
[1:13:57] of Revelation 10:7? It's Christ. Christ.
[1:14:01] But listen, Christ is the word made
[1:14:03] manifest in every age. Amen. And the
[1:14:06] bride of Christ is part of the
[1:14:08] expression of Christ. Amen. And Christ
[1:14:10] is the mystery of God revealed. Now for
[1:14:13] a text, I want to take out of there this
[1:14:15] for a text basing it upon the entire
[1:14:17] Bible. So what's he trying to preach?
[1:14:19] Christ is mystery of God revealed. He's
[1:14:21] preaching the entire Bible. That's
[1:14:23] right. Which is the book of life. Which
[1:14:25] is the book that was in his hand. Which
[1:14:26] is the book that Adam had. Which is the
[1:14:29] book we're supposed to eat. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:32] Hallelujah. But I want us to title this
[1:14:34] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:14:36] Christ being the mystery of God
[1:14:37] revealed. Now, God's secret mystery he
[1:14:40] had before the world began. Now back in
[1:14:42] the back part of God's mind, there was
[1:14:44] something that he was trying and was
[1:14:46] going to achieve and he had a motive in
[1:14:48] doing it in order to let himself be
[1:14:51] expressed.
[1:14:53] What is this? This is the mystery of the
[1:14:55] whole book. This is the mystery that's
[1:14:58] laying under the seals. This is the
[1:14:59] mystery of the whole Bible. This is the
[1:15:01] thing that God's wanted to do from the
[1:15:03] beginning. This was the mystery locked
[1:15:05] up in the back part of his mind. This
[1:15:06] was what was healed, hid and veiled away
[1:15:08] from the church for seven church ages
[1:15:10] only to be revealed in the end time.
[1:15:12] This is the mystery of the seventh seal.
[1:15:15] This is the mystery laying under the
[1:15:16] seals. This is the mystery of the book.
[1:15:18] Amen.
[1:15:21] That God had a motive in order to let
[1:15:24] himself be
[1:15:26] expressed. We already learned as a
[1:15:28] family of God and fellowship together
[1:15:29] upon the earth.
[1:15:32] Because first there wasn't even a moon,
[1:15:33] star, atom, molecule, anything. He was
[1:15:35] God, but he exactly wasn't God at that
[1:15:38] time because God is an object of
[1:15:39] worship. And there wasn't nothing to
[1:15:40] worship him. So in his great mind, he
[1:15:43] wanted those attributes to be expressed.
[1:15:45] And in him was love. In him was to be a
[1:15:47] father. And him was to be a son. In him
[1:15:49] was to be a savior. In him was to be a
[1:15:50] healer. And all these great attributes
[1:15:52] that we see already expressed, they were
[1:15:54] in God. Now God had a purpose and a
[1:15:57] hidden mystery. And that's what I want
[1:16:00] to speak on to the church this morning.
[1:16:01] the hidden mystery of God that he had in
[1:16:03] his mind before the world ever began
[1:16:07] and how that's unfolded itself right
[1:16:09] down to this present hour that we're
[1:16:11] living then you will understand clearly
[1:16:13] then you see when I believe what is
[1:16:16] being done God's g great mystery of how
[1:16:19] it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody
[1:16:23] know nothing about it even the angels
[1:16:24] didn't understand it he didn't reveal it
[1:16:27] that's the reason under our seventh
[1:16:28] mystery when the seventh seal was open
[1:16:30] there was silence
[1:16:32] What is this great mystery of God? The
[1:16:34] seventh seal. Amen.
[1:16:37] Jesus when he was on earth, they wanted
[1:16:39] to know when he would come. He said,
[1:16:40] "Not even the son himself don't know
[1:16:41] when it's going to happen." See, God has
[1:16:43] this all to himself. It's a secret. And
[1:16:45] that's the reason there was silence in
[1:16:47] heavens for space of half an hour.
[1:16:49] That's Revelation 8:1, the seven opening
[1:16:51] seventh seal. And seven thunders utter
[1:16:53] their voice. That's Revelation 10. Yeah.
[1:16:55] Amen. And John was forbidden to write
[1:16:57] it. What is he saying? The reason that
[1:16:59] Revelations 8:1 didn't say anything, the
[1:17:01] Revelation 10 didn't say anything, is
[1:17:02] because it's a secret. It's all in God.
[1:17:04] And he's not going to let the secret out
[1:17:06] till the end of the church, to the end
[1:17:08] of the ages, till the end of everything.
[1:17:10] And then he's going to let out his
[1:17:12] secret. Which is the seventh seal, which
[1:17:15] is the mystery that was laying under
[1:17:17] those seals. Amen.
[1:17:20] The coming of the Lord. That's one
[1:17:22] thing. Listen, that's one thing he
[1:17:24] hasn't revealed yet of how he will come
[1:17:28] and when he will come. It's a good thing
[1:17:30] that he doesn't
[1:17:32] know. He has
[1:17:36] showed or revealed it in every type
[1:17:39] that's in the Bible. Amen. So, did he
[1:17:42] reveal it? Did he tell it? No. Did he
[1:17:44] show it? Yes.
[1:17:47] And if you can see where he showed it,
[1:17:49] then he will reveal it. Amen. Right.
[1:17:54] Listen to what he
[1:17:56] says. The entire B. Okay, I'm going to
[1:17:58] read again. It's a good thing that he
[1:18:01] doesn't know. He has showed or revealed
[1:18:02] it in every type that's in the Bible.
[1:18:04] Therefore, the entire Bible is the
[1:18:06] revelation of God's mystery in Christ.
[1:18:08] The entire Bible is an expression of one
[1:18:10] goal that God had, one purpose he wanted
[1:18:12] to achieve in the entire Bible. And all
[1:18:14] the acts of the believers in the Bible
[1:18:16] has been entied and expressing what
[1:18:18] God's great goal is. So this book is the
[1:18:21] mystery of the seventh seal. The entire
[1:18:23] book. That's why when you open those
[1:18:25] seals, it opened up the entire Bible.
[1:18:27] That's why brother Bam said, "My Bible
[1:18:29] became a new book to me." Amen. Because
[1:18:31] of this mystery unlocking at the end
[1:18:33] times, not knowing what a white horse
[1:18:35] is, knowing what a white horse is, shows
[1:18:37] where we are in time and takes the veil
[1:18:38] away so that we can see the mystery.
[1:18:41] Amen. And that makes the book a new
[1:18:43] book. Amen.
[1:18:45] All the acts of the believers in the
[1:18:47] Bible has been in type and expressing
[1:18:48] what God's great goal is. And now in
[1:18:50] this last day, he has revealed it and
[1:18:52] shows it. I thought he said he didn't
[1:18:54] reveal it. It's a good thing he does it.
[1:18:56] No, but he shows it. But now in the last
[1:18:58] days, he reveals it and shows it.
[1:19:02] Amen. Listen, you decide which which
[1:19:05] sentence you want to identify with, but
[1:19:07] I identify with this one that he has
[1:19:09] revealed it and chose it. If you want to
[1:19:11] claim that he hasn't, that's fine for
[1:19:12] you. But it's not fine for me because I
[1:19:14] believe this statement here.
[1:19:17] He has revealed it and shows it and
[1:19:19] God's help. Well, you'll see it right
[1:19:21] here this morning. This great mystery,
[1:19:24] the secret nobody told him about that.
[1:19:26] He hasn't revealed
[1:19:29] what with God's help. You'll see it
[1:19:32] right here this morning. Amen. In what
[1:19:34] message? Christ is the mystery of God
[1:19:36] revealed. Amen. what the Lord has had in
[1:19:39] his mind all along and has expressed it.
[1:19:44] Yeah.
[1:19:45] Therefore, you can see the great meaning
[1:19:47] of what it's been to know this and then
[1:19:49] try to bring it to the people. So,
[1:19:51] brother Bam knows what the Revelation 7
[1:19:53] sees. Amen. And then you don't I haven't
[1:19:56] went into details to try to explain it
[1:19:58] as God has revealed it to me.
[1:20:01] Oh, thank God for revelation, friends.
[1:20:05] Amen.
[1:20:07] the second seal. He says, "Let's bow our
[1:20:09] heads just a moment, heavenly father.
[1:20:11] Oh, just sometimes Lord's standing
[1:20:13] here." He's in the second seal. At the
[1:20:14] end of the second seal, I tremble. I
[1:20:17] think of that awful hour that's
[1:20:19] approaching. There's no way to stop it.
[1:20:20] It's predicted that it will come. Now,
[1:20:22] I've thought of why don't the people
[1:20:24] come and listen and why don't they come
[1:20:26] and accept it? But of course, I know
[1:20:28] that you said they wouldn't, so they
[1:20:30] won't. But there is some that's got
[1:20:32] their names written on the Lamb's Book
[1:20:34] of Life. And when them seals are thrown
[1:20:36] open there, they see their name there
[1:20:38] and the Holy Spirit speaks to them. They
[1:20:41] come, you can't keep them away. No one
[1:20:44] can. No one. I'm one of those who saw my
[1:20:48] name in the book. Amen. Why? How did you
[1:20:50] see your name in the book? It's not a
[1:20:52] book like you're thinking book. It's the
[1:20:54] revelation. And I saw myself part of
[1:20:56] that revelation. My name is in that
[1:20:59] book. Amen. When the seals are thrown
[1:21:02] open and they see their name there.
[1:21:04] Amen. When he throwed open the seals and
[1:21:06] revealed the mystery, something in me
[1:21:08] knew I was part of that mystery.
[1:21:12] And then they'll come. You can't keep
[1:21:14] them away. No one can. No one. That's
[1:21:19] right. Again, Christ is the mystery of
[1:21:21] God revealed. Now, you see the seals
[1:21:24] when he was in his mediator work back
[1:21:25] there redeeming. Someday he comes forth
[1:21:27] to get this book that he's redeemed. And
[1:21:29] all that's in the book would be him. For
[1:21:32] that's the believer. The word's in the
[1:21:34] book and the word is him. Amen. So
[1:21:37] everything that's in this book is what?
[1:21:41] Christ. Because Christ is the mystery of
[1:21:44] God revealed.
[1:21:46] But what are you?
[1:21:48] I'm one of the words in the book.
[1:21:51] So there's my name. I'm part of the
[1:21:54] book, but the book is Christ, which
[1:21:56] means I'm part of Christ. And Christ is
[1:21:58] the revelation, the mystery of God
[1:22:00] revealed. That means I'm part of God.
[1:22:01] I'm part of the revelation of God. I'm
[1:22:03] part of Christ. And Christ is the book.
[1:22:05] And the believer's words in the book.
[1:22:06] I'm part of the book, part of Christ,
[1:22:08] part of the revelation of God's great
[1:22:10] mystery.
[1:22:11] The seventh seal. The seventh seal is
[1:22:14] not something I believe. The seventh
[1:22:16] seal is something I'm part of,
[1:22:17] manifesting, expressing on this earth.
[1:22:20] It's not a belief. It's a manifestation.
[1:22:22] It's not a belief. It's a person. It's
[1:22:24] God himself coming and manifesting
[1:22:27] himself through Christ through the
[1:22:29] anointing of Christ upon a people on the
[1:22:31] earth to manifest the bride form of
[1:22:32] Jesus Christ. It's not a doctrine. It's
[1:22:35] not a teaching. It's not a belief. It's
[1:22:37] a manifestation of a life. That's the
[1:22:40] seventh seal.
[1:22:44] Praise God. Now, does it matter if you
[1:22:46] lose your job tomorrow? It doesn't
[1:22:48] matter if you lose your job tomorrow.
[1:22:50] Will your flesh suffer? Sure, it will
[1:22:51] suffer. But what does it matter? I saw
[1:22:54] my name in the book. The book that's
[1:22:56] been from before the foundation of the
[1:22:57] world. Amen. What does it matter?
[1:22:59] Everything's secure. If something
[1:23:01] happens to me, it's only because God
[1:23:03] wants to express some of his word
[1:23:05] through me.
[1:23:08] This revelation is the revelation that
[1:23:11] gives the bride faith to take her
[1:23:13] position. Yeah. This is the revelation
[1:23:15] that will eventually give her faith to
[1:23:16] take a body change because she
[1:23:19] recognizes what she really is, what her
[1:23:22] substance is, what she's part of, and
[1:23:25] why she's here.
[1:23:29] Brother said,
[1:23:32] "Look, Christ in you makes him the
[1:23:34] center of the life of the
[1:23:37] revelation." Christ's life in you makes
[1:23:40] him the center of the revelation. Christ
[1:23:42] in the Bible makes the Bible the
[1:23:43] complete revelation of Christ. Christ in
[1:23:45] you makes you the complete revelation of
[1:23:49] the whole thing.
[1:23:52] See what God is trying to do.
[1:23:57] He's trying to manifest the whole secret
[1:23:59] in you.
[1:24:01] Amen. He's trying to reveal the seventh
[1:24:04] seal in you.
[1:24:08] Do you see the title of the message?
[1:24:11] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:24:14] That's the preaching of the seventh
[1:24:15] seal.
[1:24:16] He hasn't went in great detail to
[1:24:18] explain it. I haven't great detail to
[1:24:19] explain it as he showed it to me. He
[1:24:21] hasn't revealed, but he showed it in
[1:24:23] every time. And with God's help this
[1:24:24] morning, you'll see it.
[1:24:26] Amen. And he comes down to the end of it
[1:24:29] and he's talking about Christ in you.
[1:24:33] I thought he's saying Jesus Christ was
[1:24:35] the manifestation of the seventh seal.
[1:24:37] He finishes this message with Christ in
[1:24:39] you.
[1:24:41] Makes you the complete revelation of the
[1:24:45] whole thing. Amen. Because what's the
[1:24:48] point? Adam and Eve united together
[1:24:51] again. Amen. What's taking place in the
[1:24:53] bride in the end time? Christ and his
[1:24:55] bride united together again in flesh in
[1:25:00] a many membered body on the earth in the
[1:25:04] end time. the complete revelation of the
[1:25:07] whole mystery. Amen.
[1:25:15] If you get a flat tire tomorrow,
[1:25:18] how does that change what's in the book?
[1:25:23] How does that take our faith away and
[1:25:25] stop? Listen, this is the revelation
[1:25:28] that gives us faith to be who he's
[1:25:30] called us to be. This makes every
[1:25:33] doctrine matter. This makes every
[1:25:35] teaching important. It's not the
[1:25:37] teaching alone. It's the revelation of
[1:25:39] the mystery that he's been unfolding.
[1:25:43] Let's all stand together.
[1:25:47] Praise be to God.
[1:25:51] This message is so much bigger than we
[1:25:53] ever thought and our part in it is so
[1:25:56] much critical than we could ever
[1:25:58] imagine.
[1:26:00] You're not an extra. You're not a tag
[1:26:02] along. You're not a stage hand. You are
[1:26:04] critical and to the manifestation of
[1:26:06] God's great mystery he had in his mind
[1:26:08] before the foundation of the world. You
[1:26:09] are finishing that mystery now. Amen.
[1:26:13] The way we think, what we look at, what
[1:26:15] we talk about, where we go, what we do,
[1:26:17] all matters.
[1:26:20] Amen. It matters. Why? It matters
[1:26:22] because of my purpose.
[1:26:25] Amen. My purpose. You catch this
[1:26:28] revelation, catch this purpose. Nobody's
[1:26:30] got to follow you around making sure
[1:26:32] that you don't do evil things and get in
[1:26:33] trouble and look at things you shouldn't
[1:26:34] and fe. Nobody's got to chase you down
[1:26:36] and make sure that you don't get
[1:26:38] involved in this kind of activ. Listen,
[1:26:39] there's nothing in you that wants to get
[1:26:41] involved in that activity. When this
[1:26:43] revelation becomes alive and you
[1:26:44] recognize you're part of it, there's
[1:26:46] nothing in you that wants to get
[1:26:47] involved in that anymore. All I want to
[1:26:49] do is yield this vessel to that purpose.
[1:26:52] It is the revelation that brings faith,
[1:26:54] true faith, real faith, overcoming
[1:26:57] faith. Amen. Amen. It'll never come by
[1:27:00] doctrinal teaching. It only come by
[1:27:02] revelation of who you really are.
[1:27:06] And when the seals are open and you see
[1:27:07] the mystery under the seals, can you see
[1:27:10] your name in the
[1:27:11] book? Oh, praise God.
[1:27:15] What was it John rejoicing about?
[1:27:18] When the lamb took the book and loosed
[1:27:20] the seals and John was shouting, he
[1:27:23] said, "Everybody in heaven, everybody on
[1:27:25] earth, everybody under the earth heard
[1:27:26] me shouting praises and glory and honor
[1:27:28] to him that sits on the throne and the
[1:27:30] lamb forever and ever and ever." What
[1:27:31] was he rejoicing about? You can say,
[1:27:33] "Well, he was rejoicing because the book
[1:27:34] was open." That's not what brother
[1:27:36] Brandham says. He wasn't rejoicing
[1:27:37] because there was already a rejoicing in
[1:27:39] heaven when the book was open. Because
[1:27:41] the 24 elders and everybody under the
[1:27:42] altar, they were all rejoicing and the
[1:27:44] heavenly host was rejoicing. But John
[1:27:46] wasn't rejoicing yet. When they stopped
[1:27:48] rejoicing, John started rejoicing. And
[1:27:51] what was John rejoicing about? Because
[1:27:52] brother Benham said he must have looked
[1:27:54] over and saw his name in the book. And
[1:27:56] when he saw his name in the book, he
[1:27:59] started up and he got fired up. Amen.
[1:28:01] It's not that we're excited cuz the
[1:28:02] seals are open. I'm excited cuz the
[1:28:04] opening of the seals unlocked my
[1:28:07] identity and I found my identity in
[1:28:09] Christ
[1:28:11] in the book. And that's worth shouting
[1:28:14] about. That's worth dancing about.
[1:28:15] That's worth singing about. That's worth
[1:28:17] clapping your hands about. That's worth
[1:28:19] getting a little excited about and
[1:28:20] getting beside yourself about when you
[1:28:22] realize that I've been part of God's
[1:28:24] eternal purpose from before the
[1:28:26] foundation of the world. And I can never
[1:28:27] be lost, never separated. His love can
[1:28:30] never fail.
[1:28:32] Oh, that's something to get excited
[1:28:34] about. where everything in heaven and
[1:28:36] everything on earth and everything under
[1:28:37] the earth can hear you sing and shout
[1:28:39] and get beside yourself
[1:28:43] for this
[1:28:44] revelation. Praise be to God. Amen.
[1:28:47] Let's sing a song. We're going to stop.
[1:28:51] Let's sing a song. Give me
[1:28:55] more revelation.
[1:29:01] Let my
[1:29:02] flesh be
[1:29:04] whole
[1:29:08] forsen that the
[1:29:10] word of God guide me on my
[1:29:17] way so he can have
[1:29:21] preeminence each
[1:29:25] day. Give me glory.
[1:29:30] [Music]
[1:29:34] Let my
[1:29:36] life be
[1:29:38] your
[1:29:42] reflection for I
[1:29:44] know this word is my redemption.
[1:29:52] Give me
[1:29:54] more
[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:29:59] revelation. Give me
[1:30:03] more
[1:30:08] revelation. Let my
[1:30:11] life be
[1:30:13] all forsen.
[1:30:18] And the
[1:30:20] word of God guide me
[1:30:24] on my
[1:30:27] way so he can have
[1:30:32] [Applause]
[1:30:35] evidence. Give me more.
[1:30:39] [Music]
[1:30:44] Let my
[1:30:46] life be
[1:30:49] your
[1:30:51] [Music]

[1:30:55] know this word is my redemption.
[1:31:02] Give me
[1:31:05] more
[1:31:09] revelation and give me
[1:31:13] more
[1:31:15] [Applause]
[1:31:18] revelation. Oh, let my
[1:31:22] life be
[1:31:24] your reflection.
[1:31:29] For I
[1:31:30] know this word
[1:31:36] I give me
[1:31:42] [Music]
[1:31:47] more. Oh, how I long to
[1:31:51] be in love with
[1:31:55] you. Till all the world just
[1:32:00] fade
[1:32:02] from
[1:32:03] you. Deep calling to the
[1:32:08] deep burning
[1:32:10] [Applause]
[1:32:11] inside is my heart.
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:21] to have the word made
[1:32:25] manifest in
[1:32:28] me. Living pure and
[1:32:32] holy
[1:32:34] unto
[1:32:36] thee. This longing in my heart.
[1:32:42] Only
[1:32:44] you can
[1:32:46] [Music]
[1:32:51] say, "Oh, how I long to
[1:32:58] be with you.
[1:33:02] All the world just
[1:33:05] wait
[1:33:07] around
[1:33:08] you. Deep calling to the
[1:33:13] deep. A burning
[1:33:17] inside is my heart's cry.
[1:33:23] [Music]
[1:33:25] Do you have the word
[1:33:30] [Music]
[1:33:31] made in
[1:33:33] me living pure and
[1:33:39] holy to
[1:33:43] thee in my
[1:33:46] heart
[1:33:48] only
[1:33:49] you can
[1:33:53] s once
[1:33:58] Oh, how I long to
[1:34:01] be in
[1:34:03] love with
[1:34:05] you. Till all the world just
[1:34:10] fades
[1:34:12] from you. And deep calling to the
[1:34:18] deep burning
[1:34:21] in is my heart's cry.
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:31] Have the word made
[1:34:35] manifest in
[1:34:38] me. Living pure and
[1:34:42] holy
[1:34:43] unto
[1:34:45] thee. This longing in my
[1:34:50] heart.

[1:34:53] you can
[1:34:57] [Applause]
[1:35:01] sit. There is none like
[1:35:09] you. No one else can touch my heart like
[1:35:14] you do.
[1:35:17] [Music]
[1:35:19] I can search for all
[1:35:23] eternity,
[1:35:24] Lord, and find there is none like
[1:35:34] you. There is none like
[1:35:39] you. There's none like you.
[1:35:44] No one else can touch my heart like you
