[4:10] summer threshing floor
[4:12] and the wind carried them away and that

[5:15] and it was
[5:16] it was a good time so we appreciate all
[5:18] those that came out i want to remind

[5:22] time at the end of service

[5:41] so keep them in prayer
[5:42] and that'll be wonderful
[5:46] we want to take a look if we could open
[5:48] up the powerpoint
[5:50] i want to continue on in the seal series
[5:53] and look at the fourth seal
[5:55] and this is a little bit strange this
[5:57] was surprising to me that in the fourth
[5:59] seal we'd find thyatira because thyatira
[6:01] is the fourth church age
[6:03] and so i wanna i want to just teach on
[6:05] this i'm going to try my best to go slow
[6:08] and just teach and every time i want to
[6:10] go slow and teach i end up going really
[6:12] really fast
[6:13] and i feel like i mess everything up and
[6:15] i feel horrible the rest of the day but
[6:17] i'm determined that i'm going to slow
[6:18] down
[6:19] and we're going to read some scriptures
[6:20] together and look at this because i
[6:22] found this to be absolutely fascinating
[6:25] you know last week i had to i had to
[6:28] call and apologize to sister rebecca
[6:30] wholesale
[6:31] because she was interpreting in french
[6:33] for us some of you might know that the
[6:35] the uh our brothers and sisters the
[6:37] bondo family from africa have been
[6:39] joining us for the last couple of months
[6:41] and they need french interpretation and
[6:43] they came one day
[6:45] they didn't know that we had anybody
[6:46] that spoke french they just came they
[6:48] got our address from friends
[6:49] they showed up at church and they walked
[6:51] in the door and they met one of the
[6:53] deacons and
[6:54] they started to talk and all of a sudden
[6:55] brother emanuel walks in the door
[6:57] and we put the two together and brother
[6:59] manuel started interpreting back in the
[7:01] father's nursery
[7:02] interpreting the services in the french
[7:04] and now we've got the system over the
[7:06] uh over the headphones for them to hear
[7:08] and so
[7:10] that's been going really well i i kept
[7:13] thinking that i would
[7:14] take my time and go slow for brother
[7:15] emmanuel but i never did
[7:17] and and and so he's done a really
[7:20] wonderful job
[7:21] but then last sunday i'm preaching away
[7:24] and i notice that brother emanuel's
[7:26] family is not here but
[7:28] i don't have time to think about it i'm
[7:29] just preaching i just noticed they're
[7:31] gone
[7:31] and i noticed jaraya sitting by himself
[7:33] and and i didn't think about it till the
[7:35] service was over and i'm at home i said
[7:38] oh lord what have i done
[7:41] what have i done to our poor sister but
[7:44] you know what she did a great job
[7:45] so god bless you and i think what a
[7:47] blessing it is and how god puts pieces
[7:50] together
[7:51] to where we where we we don't interpret
[7:54] services in the french normally in a
[7:56] family who needs
[7:57] interpretation comes and we've got two
[7:59] interpreters in our church
[8:01] i just think god just knows what he's
[8:03] doing he knows how to direct his
[8:05] children
[8:05] he knows how to put the pieces together
[8:07] so god bless you thank you
[8:08] so much and i'm sure her mom could be a
[8:10] backup to the backup if we need her to
[8:12] be while she's here
[8:13] praise the lord god's just good to us
[8:17] so we miss having brother emanuel down
[8:19] here on the floor we miss his amens we
[8:21] miss the shout
[8:22] but we he's working in the service of
[8:24] the lord so god bless him up there
[8:27] we should just open up the window there
[8:29] so he can just shout hallelujah so we
[8:31] can all hear it
[8:32] amen so we want to we want to look at
[8:35] the
[8:36] fourth seal i want to do just a little
[8:38] review with a couple excuse me a couple
[8:40] of quotes here
[8:42] first one is in the breach between the
[8:43] seven church age and the seven seals i
[8:45] just want to keep this in our mind i
[8:46] don't ever want to lose this
[8:48] so now when we go to breaking these
[8:50] seals we're going to see it goes plum
[8:52] back in the scriptures all the way back
[8:55] for each one of these seals the whole
[8:57] thing
[8:57] together the whole mystery lays right
[8:59] there in these seals
[9:02] every mystery of the bible lays in these
[9:04] seals
[9:05] we don't want to forget that we don't
[9:07] want to lose track of that
[9:09] every mystery in the bible lays in these
[9:11] seals
[9:13] and the seals cannot be broke until that
[9:15] time
[9:17] let's look at look a couple things these
[9:19] are refreshers but i want it to stay
[9:20] fresh in your mind
[9:22] and questions and answers from 1964 this
[9:25] is in
[9:26] in august of 1964. the question says
[9:29] have the seven thunders which equal
[9:30] seven mysteries already been revealed
[9:33] were they revealed in the seven seals
[9:35] but are yet not known to us as the
[9:37] thunders yet
[9:38] brother brandon says no they were
[9:40] revealed in the seven seals
[9:42] that's what the thunders was all about
[9:45] all right the seven thunders that had
[9:48] uttered their voices and no one could
[9:50] make out what it was
[9:51] john knew what it was but he was
[9:53] forbidden to write him he said but the
[9:55] seventh angel in the days of his
[9:57] sounding the seven
[9:58] the seven mysteries of the seven
[10:00] thunders would be revealed
[10:01] and the seventh angel is a messenger of
[10:03] the seventh church age
[10:05] so that should clear everything up for
[10:07] us that the thunders have been revealed
[10:09] amen
[10:09] that that that was the thunders was the
[10:11] revelation of the seals
[10:13] and so it's it's all clear before us
[10:17] but look at this quote in the latest in
[10:19] church age out of the church age book it
[10:21] says now this messenger of malachi 4
[10:24] and revelations 10 7 is going to do two
[10:26] things
[10:28] one according to malachi 4 he will turn
[10:30] the hearts of the children to the
[10:31] fathers
[10:32] two he will reveal the mystery of the
[10:35] seven thunders in revelations 10
[10:37] which are the revelations contained in
[10:39] the seven seals
[10:41] does that clear it up that should be
[10:43] crystal clear
[10:44] now look at the next statement so we
[10:46] know we know that malachi 4
[10:49] revelations 10 7 has already come we
[10:51] know that
[10:52] we know that that seventh church age
[10:54] messenger has been here
[10:55] he's fulfilled these scriptures and he
[10:58] he's come
[10:58] and he's passed off the scene and he
[11:01] says he's going to do two things
[11:02] he's going to turn the hearts of the
[11:04] children to the fathers and he's going
[11:05] to reveal
[11:07] the mystery of the seven thunders in
[11:09] revelation 10 which
[11:10] are the revelations contained in the
[11:13] seven seals
[11:14] now listen what this will do it will be
[11:17] these
[11:18] divinely revealed mystery truths
[11:21] that literally turn the hearts of the
[11:24] children
[11:24] to the pentecostal fathers this is
[11:27] really
[11:28] important this was not the first pull
[11:30] and second pull that did nothing to turn
[11:32] the hearts of the children back to the
[11:33] fathers
[11:34] that was to attract the attention of the
[11:36] rainbow trout they attacked attention of
[11:38] the children of god
[11:40] showing that god was on the scene but it
[11:42] wasn't the healing ministry it was not
[11:44] the campaigns
[11:45] that did nothing to fulfill malachi 4.
[11:50] the fulfillment of malachi 4 is found in
[11:53] revelations 10
[11:55] and in revelations 10 when the seventh
[11:57] church age messenger
[11:58] when he reveals the mystery truths the
[12:01] seven thunders the voices
[12:03] of god that were contained in the seven
[12:06] seals
[12:06] when he does that it's those mystery
[12:09] truths
[12:10] the revelation of the entire bible
[12:12] remember these seven seals
[12:14] the the mystery of the entire bible lays
[12:16] in those seven seals
[12:18] the fullness of redemption of the seed
[12:20] of god coming into earth and
[12:22] living their life all the way through
[12:23] and being redeemed and how they would be
[12:25] redeemed
[12:26] and called back where they came from
[12:28] what their purpose is on earth
[12:29] what they're going to afterwards these
[12:31] mystery truths
[12:33] it's these mystery truths of the seals
[12:36] as what
[12:37] literally turns the hearts of the
[12:39] children back to the faith of the
[12:41] fathers
[12:43] it wasn't god sent a prophet that's not
[12:45] going to do it
[12:46] it wasn't it wasn't brother branham was
[12:49] a mighty man of god that's not doing it
[12:51] it wasn't the healing prophecy it wasn't
[12:53] it wasn't showing the signs
[12:54] it was the sign of the messiah to get
[12:56] your attention to listen to what he was
[12:58] saying
[12:59] but it's the mystery truths being
[13:01] revealed
[13:02] that are literally turning your heart
[13:04] back to the faith of the fathers
[13:06] it's not turning your heart just back to
[13:09] oh i love the fathers and i appreciate
[13:11] paul so much
[13:12] it's turning you back to the faith that
[13:14] was in paul the faith that was in the
[13:16] pentecostal fathers
[13:18] and what is turning you back to that
[13:20] faith it literally
[13:21] it's the literally the revelation
[13:24] contained in the seven thunders
[13:28] that's why to ignore this is to ignore
[13:30] the message
[13:31] there's no way your heart if you if you
[13:34] ignore the seals
[13:35] and you ignore the revelation of the
[13:37] seven thunders you're ignoring the very
[13:39] thing that is supposed to turn your
[13:40] heart back to the faith of the
[13:42] pentecostal fathers
[13:48] hallelujah who can testify to that in
[13:50] your own life
[13:52] saying studying these seals is literally
[13:54] moving me in faith
[13:56] it is literally turning me back to a
[13:58] greater faith than i've ever had before
[14:00] i mean not not just reading through the
[14:02] seals really quick and saying oh that
[14:04] that covered the church ages no but
[14:06] actually seeing the mystery truths that
[14:08] that were in those seals what my brother
[14:10] branham was was bringing out and laying
[14:13] out
[14:13] and revealing the entire bible how many
[14:15] can say that it's literally turning me
[14:17] to a higher faith literally
[14:21] it's not it's not i'm straining it's not
[14:23] i'm groaning it's the word it's the
[14:25] revelation of the word that is
[14:27] literally taking me right back to the
[14:30] faith of the father
[14:31] i have greater faith now than i've ever
[14:32] had in my life
[14:34] what is it greater revelation greater
[14:36] unfolding i'm seeing what was already
[14:38] laying there
[14:39] i'm seeing what's already been given to
[14:40] us but i'm seeing it more clearly
[14:42] and in seeing it more clearly i'm
[14:44] operating in a level higher than i've
[14:46] ever operated in before
[14:48] i say god open my eyes to see all that
[14:52] you have for me
[14:55] these divinely revealed mysteries that
[14:57] literally
[14:58] turn the hearts of the children to the
[15:00] pentecostal fathers
[15:03] oh i don't know i don't know about you
[15:04] but i like saying that
[15:08] because it's it's what's been given to
[15:10] us in the seals
[15:11] that are literally turning our hearts
[15:13] back to the pentecostal fathers
[15:16] we know that the the pale horse rides in
[15:18] the fourth seal
[15:20] this is spiritual death it's also
[15:22] natural death but we're looking at
[15:23] spiritual death
[15:25] and it's the incarnate devil the prophet
[15:28] of god says in the four seal oh my
[15:31] notice he gave her a space to repent but
[15:34] she didn't do it
[15:35] he's done it again she won't do it her
[15:37] rejection away
[15:38] her rejection makes a perfect way for
[15:40] satan to come into her
[15:42] and be incarnate that's right incarnate
[15:44] himself
[15:45] right in her because she rejected the
[15:47] word
[15:48] and that's exactly the same thing that
[15:50] the protestant church
[15:51] becomes a harlot is because she rejects
[15:54] the vindicated truth of the word of god
[15:56] and that gives the devil a place to come
[15:59] right in and
[16:00] incarnate himself and he will make an
[16:02] image into the beast when they can
[16:03] consolidate together
[16:05] right yonder now and go on and do just
[16:08] exactly what he said
[16:10] now i want you to notice i want to i'm
[16:12] breaking this down for a reason
[16:15] brother branham starts off talking about
[16:17] the catholic church
[16:18] and what what happened to them and how
[16:20] the devil came right into
[16:22] the church amen and then he talks about
[16:24] the protestants doing the same thing
[16:26] so brother random is establishing a
[16:28] pattern and he's showing the repeat of
[16:30] the pattern in the protestants
[16:31] there's a pattern established in the
[16:33] catholic church and the pattern will
[16:35] repeat in the protestant movement
[16:38] and so we want to catch that and
[16:39] understand that because it's going to
[16:41] help us as we move on
[16:42] so he says whatever the catholic church
[16:44] did amen
[16:46] she rejected the word and it made a
[16:48] perfect way for him to incarnate himself
[16:50] into her and to who the catholic church
[16:54] and the protestant church by her
[16:56] rejection will
[16:57] make her a mental harlot just like her
[17:00] mother the
[17:01] she becomes a harlot by rejecting the
[17:03] vindicated truth of the word
[17:05] and it gives the devil a place to come
[17:07] right in and incarnate himself
[17:09] in her and when he does he'll make an
[17:11] image unto the beast
[17:13] which we know as a system of the world
[17:15] council of churches
[17:16] make an image into the beast when they
[17:19] can consolidate together
[17:20] right yonder now and go on and do just
[17:23] exactly
[17:24] what he said so we see the battle plan
[17:27] we see
[17:28] that satan is working through these four
[17:30] horses it's the same man on each horse
[17:32] these are not four horse riders
[17:34] these are four horses or four powers or
[17:36] four different ways he will deceive the
[17:38] church
[17:38] and it's the same rider riding each
[17:40] horse as he moves down through
[17:42] but we remember his objective was always
[17:44] to get to the fourth horse
[17:46] now you're gonna find the fullness of
[17:48] satan comes in the fourth age and the
[17:50] fourth horse and the fourth beast
[17:51] it's always in the fourth and that's
[17:53] what we're looking at now
[17:55] but god amen god is bringing back and
[17:58] whenever satan
[17:59] has a power riding god has a power to
[18:01] combat it
[18:02] comes in as compromise god sends out the
[18:04] pure word to keep from compromise
[18:06] when he comes in this persecution god
[18:08] sends an anointing of an ox
[18:10] where we can lay down our lives when he
[18:12] sends deception and darkness
[18:14] and keeping the word from the people
[18:16] till they have no understanding he
[18:17] brings godly wisdom as a man
[18:20] amen and these three things together
[18:22] bring us to the eagle
[18:24] so i want to look at daniel again i hope
[18:27] we still have our bibles in daniel
[18:29] let's go back to daniel
[18:32] chapter 2.
[18:39] now i want you to watch this number four
[18:41] this is an important number
[18:43] always watch the fourth
[18:46] as we go on and i want to establish
[18:50] something really quickly here
[18:52] i'll just skip to it
[18:55] in the message as i was with moses so i
[18:57] will be with thee
[18:59] the prophet of god says now last evening
[19:01] we were journeying with the children of
[19:03] israel
[19:03] all the way from egypt until we got into
[19:05] kedish
[19:06] oh what a great lesson what a great
[19:08] thing as we typed
[19:10] the natural church to the spiritual
[19:12] church
[19:13] god dealing with israel in the natural
[19:16] with the church in these days as he's
[19:18] calling out of the gentiles of people
[19:19] for his name he's dealing with them
[19:22] in the spiritual as he dealt with them
[19:24] in the natural
[19:25] just parallel one to the other now this
[19:28] is important to realize
[19:29] that god has laid down a pattern with
[19:32] israel
[19:32] and that's why brother branham would
[19:33] come and preach the third exodus
[19:36] because he's pointing to the first
[19:37] exodus as laying down a shadow
[19:39] and now in the natural church which was
[19:42] israel and now it's going to be
[19:43] completed by the spiritual church
[19:46] so whatever happened was just a shadow
[19:48] of things to come
[19:50] he says god dealing with israel the
[19:52] natural and he deals with the church in
[19:54] the spiritual
[19:55] just parallel one to the other all that
[19:57] god did with them and all that god did
[19:59] for them and all they did in response
[20:02] falls to us
[20:03] as an example and we see so far the word
[20:06] has been carried out exactly the same
[20:09] you got that so when when you want to
[20:13] find out what's going on you look at
[20:15] what has been and the pattern never
[20:17] changes
[20:18] so it's really important to follow that
[20:20] through that god what he's doing to
[20:22] natural church
[20:22] israel god is going to do it says here
[20:26] what he did for what he did with them
[20:29] all that he did for them and what they
[20:32] did in response
[20:33] falls to us as an example and we see so
[20:36] far the word has been carried out
[20:38] exactly the same it's been identical to
[20:42] what has happened
[20:43] i mean even solomon said there is
[20:44] nothing new under the sun all things
[20:46] that are things that have been
[20:48] there's nothing new that is happening
[20:50] friends these things have already
[20:51] happened
[20:52] there's just different places with
[20:53] different names and different people
[20:55] but these things have happened before
[20:57] and they're happening again right here
[20:58] among us
[20:59] and that's what makes these that's what
[21:01] the revelation in these seals
[21:02] ties the whole scriptures together
[21:04] because now you see it's the same spirit
[21:06] brother branham said spirits don't die
[21:10] so these spirits these fallen angels
[21:12] that fell from the battle in heaven
[21:13] they've never died it's not like
[21:15] it's not like they went and they
[21:16] corrupted the the the hebrew church
[21:19] and now they set back and they went on
[21:21] vacation and they're drinking tea and
[21:22] they've got nothing else to do because
[21:23] they fulfilled their purpose
[21:25] they're the same demons that corrupted
[21:27] them in the first exodus
[21:28] are the same demons that's corrupting
[21:30] the children of god in this
[21:32] exodus one was to a natural lineage
[21:34] called israel and one is to a gentile
[21:37] called out people
[21:39] so we find out that they run parallel
[21:41] one parallels the other
[21:42] and we've got to keep this in our minds
[21:44] so that we understand
[21:45] where we're at even the apostle paul
[21:48] when he's speaking of the exodus and
[21:50] those that fall away
[21:51] in first corinthians 10 verse 11 he says
[21:54] now all these things happen
[21:55] unto them for examples they are written
[21:59] for our admonition upon whom the ends of
[22:01] the world are come
[22:04] so to the people to whom the ends of the
[22:06] world have come
[22:08] all the things that were written in the
[22:10] old testament were for our example
[22:12] in our admonition so that we can look at
[22:15] that and see
[22:16] what happened and we can avoid the same
[22:18] catastrophe
[22:20] so let's look back here in daniel 24
[22:24] we just read you know nebuchadnezzar had
[22:27] a dream
[22:28] and in this dream he saw this image and
[22:30] and nobody could interpret it he was
[22:32] going to kill all the wise men but
[22:33] daniel
[22:34] interceded and said give me the night
[22:36] and god gave him the interpretation
[22:38] and so we find that that we picked it up
[22:40] here in 24
[22:41] 31 and we read down through and and he's
[22:45] talking about
[22:46] four different stages or four different
[22:48] things
[22:49] in this image the head of gold and it
[22:52] had a breast and arms of silver
[22:54] and it had uh uh
[22:58] what was it that it said it was thighs a
[23:01] belly in his thighs of brass and his
[23:03] legs of iron and his feet part of iron
[23:05] part of clay
[23:07] so there's four four different stages to
[23:09] this
[23:10] this uh image and so he says and i want
[23:14] to pick it up in verse 34
[23:18] thou saw was till that a stone was cut
[23:20] out without hands
[23:21] which smote the image upon his feet that
[23:24] were of iron clay and break them to
[23:26] pieces
[23:27] then was the iron the clay the brass the
[23:29] silver and the gold broke into pieces
[23:30] together
[23:31] and become like the chaff of the summer
[23:33] threshing floor and the wind carried
[23:35] them away
[23:36] and no place was found for them and the
[23:37] stone that smote the image became a
[23:40] great mountain and filled the whole
[23:41] earth
[23:43] this is the dream and we will tell the
[23:45] interpretation
[23:46] thereof before the king thou o king or
[23:49] the king of kings for the god of heaven
[23:51] hath given the kingdom power and
[23:53] strength and glory
[23:55] and who wheresoever the children of men
[23:57] dwell and the beast of the field and the
[23:59] fowls of the heaven
[24:00] that he giveth unto thine hand and hath
[24:03] made thee ruler
[24:04] over them over all thou art this head of
[24:07] gold
[24:08] and after thee shall arise another
[24:09] kingdom inferior to thee
[24:11] and another third kingdom of brass which
[24:13] shall bear rule over all the earth
[24:15] and the fourth kingdom shall be strong
[24:17] as iron for as much as iron breaketh in
[24:19] pieces and subdueth all things
[24:21] and as iron that breaketh all things
[24:23] shall it break in pieces and bruise
[24:25] and whereas thou saw us the feet and
[24:27] toes part of the potter's clay
[24:29] and part of iron the kingdom shall be
[24:31] divided
[24:32] but there shall be in it of the strength
[24:35] of the iron for as much as thou
[24:36] saws the iron mixed with the miry clay
[24:39] and as the toes of the feet were part
[24:41] iron and part of clay
[24:43] so the kingdom shall be partly strong
[24:45] and partly broken
[24:47] and where else thou saws iron mixed with
[24:49] the mighty clay
[24:50] thou shall mingle themselves with the
[24:52] seed of the men but they shall not
[24:54] cleave one to another even as iron is
[24:56] not mixed with clay
[24:58] and in the days of these of these kings
[25:01] shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom
[25:03] which shall never be destroyed and the
[25:05] kingdom shall not be left to other
[25:07] people but it shall
[25:08] break in pieces and consume all these
[25:10] kingdoms and shall stand forever
[25:12] for as much as thou saw us the stone was
[25:15] cut out of the mountain without hands
[25:16] that it break in pieces the iron the
[25:18] brass the clay the silver and the gold
[25:21] the great god hath made known to the
[25:23] king
[25:24] what shall come to pass hereafter and
[25:26] the dream is certain
[25:27] and the interpretation thereof sure
[25:30] i love that when a prophet speaks the
[25:32] dream is certain
[25:34] and the interpretation of is sure this
[25:37] is going to happen and nothing will stop
[25:39] this from happening
[25:40] now he's talking about these these four
[25:43] kingdoms
[25:44] and in in the the daniel gives the
[25:47] interpretation that they are four
[25:48] kingdoms amen and we see babylon that
[25:51] was replaced by medo-persia
[25:53] was replaced by greece which was
[25:55] replaced by rome
[25:56] and rome is the fourth kingdom now we
[25:58] see this is all talking about natural
[26:00] israel
[26:01] because in natural israel they the
[26:04] jerusalem was trodden down by four
[26:06] gentile nations amen
[26:08] assyria came and led israel captive but
[26:11] those were the
[26:12] 10 tribes to the north they didn't touch
[26:14] jerusalem jerusalem was trodden down
[26:16] by these four gentile powers and so we
[26:19] know
[26:20] that that that it started with babylon
[26:22] babylon carried them away
[26:24] captive and and they carried out from
[26:26] the treasury
[26:27] of of the temple and all these things
[26:30] out of jerusalem and it came down
[26:33] medo-persia had dominion
[26:34] and then greece had dominion and then
[26:36] rome and rome
[26:38] finally in 70 a.d trampled
[26:41] jerusalem under foot and then tramped
[26:44] him under foot
[26:45] and you're going to see how important
[26:46] this terminology is as we get into the
[26:48] book of revelation
[26:49] and later in daniel that this fourth
[26:52] kingdom will trample under feet
[26:53] because the fourth kingdom is defeat
[26:58] now remember satan can only copy what
[27:01] god does
[27:03] right because there was a prophecy back
[27:05] in genesis 3
[27:06] amen that the the seed of the woman
[27:09] shall bruise the head amen of the
[27:12] serpent and the serpent shall bruise his
[27:14] heel
[27:14] meaning the serpent's going to be
[27:16] trodden under the feet of jesus christ
[27:19] remember we pick it up and
[27:21] the apostle paul says amen and the god
[27:23] of peace
[27:24] amen shall destroy or bruise the
[27:27] the bruised serpent under your feet
[27:30] shortly
[27:31] and so now the feet of god the the feet
[27:34] of god and flesh
[27:35] is going to trample down the serpent so
[27:37] what is what is the serpent trying to do
[27:39] what is the beast trying to do
[27:41] he's trying to build something that will
[27:43] trample underfoot
[27:44] god's kingdom everything runs on
[27:47] parallel tracks friends
[27:49] whenever you see this you can just see
[27:51] that the devil all he is is a copier of
[27:54] what god does he's just copying what god
[27:56] does
[27:58] now the fourth kingdom is the one we
[28:00] want to pay close attention
[28:02] to because brother bam tells us and
[28:05] we'll read it here in a minute
[28:06] this this natural kingdom turned from a
[28:08] natural kingdom to a spiritual kingdom
[28:11] and that this kingdom goes all the way
[28:14] to the end of the world and to the end
[28:16] of the world system as we know it now
[28:18] it goes all the way to the end and is
[28:20] finally destroyed with the stone that is
[28:22] cut out of the
[28:23] mountain without hands so here we have a
[28:26] stone
[28:26] and and remember the temple of solomon
[28:30] was built with stones
[28:31] and that you are lively stones built
[28:33] into a spiritual household
[28:35] so you know that you are the stones amen
[28:37] that were cut out of the earth that were
[28:39] brought together to make the habitation
[28:41] of god
[28:42] the dwelling place of god but there's a
[28:44] chief cornerstone that's been cut out
[28:46] and that and the cornerstones become the
[28:48] head of the corner amen so he's the
[28:50] formation of the cornerstone he's also
[28:51] the headstone in the pyramid
[28:53] and this is jesus christ only jesus
[28:55] christ wasn't the product of a man and a
[28:57] woman
[28:58] he is a stone that was cut out of the
[28:59] mountain without hands
[29:02] god himself amen produced the embryo
[29:06] and put it amen into the womb of the
[29:09] woman and this stone was not touched by
[29:11] man
[29:12] it did not cut out of the mountain by
[29:14] man's hands like you and i
[29:15] we come through natural birth but jesus
[29:17] came a different way
[29:19] he was the stone that was cut on the
[29:21] mount without hands and this stone
[29:23] is the stone that will strike the image
[29:26] not in the head
[29:27] not in the arms but in the feet because
[29:29] at the end time it's the feet that are
[29:31] in play
[29:32] and it's amazing how the stone hit them
[29:35] at the feet
[29:36] and when it hit the feet the whole image
[29:38] is grounding the powder
[29:39] you know this is not logical when you
[29:41] look at it physically
[29:42] you can't hit it in the feet but the
[29:44] feet all the kingdoms move down and just
[29:46] keep coming out
[29:47] down into the feet and when you destroy
[29:49] the feet you've destroyed the whole
[29:50] thing
[29:52] so the feet is going to be the roman
[29:54] empire and and brother brahma explains
[29:56] it clearly it's split into western and
[29:58] eastern there's two legs
[30:00] and it goes down and mingles into the
[30:02] miry clay and when it mingles into the
[30:04] clay
[30:04] that means it separates the kingdom
[30:06] separates
[30:07] and the iron moves out and mixes in the
[30:10] clay
[30:10] which is people because you're we're
[30:12] made of clay
[30:14] but it said it doesn't ever cleave to
[30:16] the people this
[30:17] kingdom it may look like it's being
[30:20] friendly this roman catholic church
[30:22] like it loves the people but remember it
[30:24] doesn't actually mingle with the clay
[30:26] this iron is just mixed in with the clay
[30:29] but hey it's got its own agenda and it's
[30:32] not for the clay
[30:34] using the clay amen and it separates out
[30:37] and it dominates over all the nations of
[30:39] the earth
[30:41] we're going to read some of that so you
[30:42] can catch that and see that
[30:44] but just remember it's the fourth
[30:46] kingdom and the fourth kingdom goes all
[30:48] the way through until finally it's
[30:49] destroyed by jesus christ
[30:54] in the seventh week of daniel he says
[30:56] now what's happened the head of gold was
[30:58] nebuchadnezzar
[31:00] which he interpreted another king shall
[31:02] come and he
[31:03] be in fear to thee which was darius the
[31:05] medo-persian taking the gentile kingdom
[31:07] over
[31:08] next came and after the medo-persian was
[31:10] what the greeks alexander the great and
[31:11] so forth
[31:12] the grecian took the kingdom over then
[31:14] what took over the greeks the romans
[31:16] and who's ruled the gentile world ever
[31:18] since romans now that was
[31:20] iron notice rome exists to the end
[31:23] because it went to the end of the toes
[31:25] and he's seen mud clay and that's people
[31:28] what we're made out of and iron
[31:30] the strength of rome run in every one of
[31:32] these nations
[31:33] and rome has strength in every nation
[31:35] under
[31:36] heaven and the second seal
[31:40] he says tell me russia don't reign over
[31:42] all we don't reign over all
[31:44] there's only one king that reigns over
[31:45] everything like that nebuchadnezzar's
[31:47] iron running out to every one of them
[31:49] toes
[31:49] and it's rome rome don't do it as a
[31:52] nation it does it as
[31:53] a church so that's what we're looking
[31:56] this fourth kingdom
[31:58] turned amen from from the the
[32:01] the emperors it turned to the popes
[32:04] it turned from the national power of
[32:07] rome into the religious power of the
[32:09] catholic church
[32:12] so so we just want to want to look at a
[32:15] couple of things
[32:16] here don't forget we want to talk about
[32:18] thyatira
[32:21] so we see that these four powers or
[32:24] these four anointings
[32:25] of the antichrist spirit that would come
[32:27] and defile the church ages
[32:29] they run over the entire length of the
[32:31] church ages we know that it comes out as
[32:33] a white horse and moves to the red
[32:35] and this covers the duration of the of
[32:37] the seven church ages
[32:38] or approximately the last 2000 years and
[32:41] it covers that
[32:42] in the in the seventh one or the fourth
[32:44] horse rider
[32:45] is the one there's a one that rides
[32:47] through tribulation and the one that's
[32:49] ultimately
[32:49] stored or destroyed and it's the devil
[32:52] incarnate and
[32:53] a one-man person and a person called the
[32:56] beast
[32:58] and god sends his anointings to combat
[33:01] that and that covers the entire
[33:03] church age but brother graham's going to
[33:06] say something in the fourth seal
[33:08] that's going to be a little tricky so i
[33:10] want you to pay close attention
[33:12] now i want to back up and i want to show
[33:14] you that this is
[33:16] absolutely the truth these four
[33:18] anointings cover the seven church ages
[33:22] and these four godly anointings of the
[33:23] holy ghost they cover the seven church
[33:25] ages
[33:26] so brother branham is going to say
[33:27] something different than that in just a
[33:29] second
[33:30] something different than he's been
[33:31] saying but he's not changing his mind on
[33:33] this
[33:35] he's trying to show us a pattern and
[33:37] whenever the prophet of god does that
[33:38] if you ever read the scripture and read
[33:41] the message and two and two don't equal
[33:42] four
[33:43] just wait there's something laying there
[33:46] that our our little brains can't compute
[33:49] at this time
[33:49] but at the right time under the right
[33:51] conditions when it's needful
[33:53] god will just open your eyes and take
[33:55] the scale away
[33:56] and all of a sudden you'll see it and
[33:57] it'll be perfect
[33:59] so i don't i don't want you to when you
[34:01] hear what's coming next
[34:03] i don't want you to think we mean
[34:04] anything different than this brother
[34:06] branham was clear
[34:08] these four anointings these four horses
[34:10] ride to the seven church ages
[34:13] and these anointings cover that at two
[34:15] but he's gonna
[34:16] change his tone here for a minute
[34:18] because he's trying to teach us
[34:19] something he's trying to show us
[34:20] something
[34:22] and the third seal says now watch we are
[34:24] where we are at tonight the other church
[34:26] age now
[34:27] where come down to the third church age
[34:29] now just
[34:30] exactly on the third church age is just
[34:33] exactly like
[34:34] the third horse got that
[34:37] that's not what he said before
[34:40] right the third horse is the black horse
[34:44] and it doesn't start riding until the
[34:45] fourth to the fourth church age right
[34:48] and it rides on through till the pale
[34:49] horse and in the end of laodicean church
[34:52] age
[34:52] so he's saying something different he's
[34:54] saying now
[34:55] the the third the third age is the third
[34:58] horse
[34:59] and that would make the first age the
[35:01] first horse the second age the second
[35:03] horse or red horse
[35:04] and the third age the black horse he's
[35:06] saying something different than what he
[35:07] said before
[35:09] now the first church age what was it the
[35:10] nicolaitans had a doctrine
[35:12] just the first one all right and then
[35:14] the first thing we know
[35:16] this nicolaith and doctrine it became
[35:17] sanctioned and was right
[35:19] went into action and they crowned this
[35:21] fellow then this spirit antichrist
[35:23] became incarnate and a man
[35:25] and we find out later on he becomes
[35:27] incarnate devil too
[35:28] the demon goes away and the devil comes
[35:30] in
[35:31] and just as the church this kind of
[35:33] antichrist church progresses
[35:35] so has the bride come along with
[35:37] different things through justification
[35:39] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[35:42] just moving right on just like that
[35:44] only they take their revival first and
[35:46] the church is taking it last
[35:50] so they take their revival first the
[35:53] church takes their revival
[35:55] last look what he says next
[36:00] their first three years first three
[36:02] stages of them
[36:03] that went into the dark age the third
[36:06] three stages
[36:07] comes the church out from justification
[36:09] sanctification
[36:10] baptism holy ghost incarnate god made
[36:13] manifest among us
[36:14] here he comes in as the antichrist as
[36:16] the false prophet
[36:17] then the beast then in dark age and the
[36:20] church comes out that dark age
[36:22] justification sanctification baptism
[36:25] holy ghost
[36:26] incarnate word the way now so brother
[36:29] rem says those
[36:30] first three stages first three ages
[36:35] brought them to dark ages and from dark
[36:38] ages
[36:39] the next three stages brings the
[36:41] restoration of the bride
[36:44] incarnate word the way now so we see the
[36:47] first three church ages
[36:49] brings them to the dark age that's why
[36:51] brother ben this third age
[36:52] is that black horse and the last three
[36:55] stages he now he's not talking about
[36:58] the whole church age and the whole
[36:59] foreign things he's showing something
[37:01] that actually happened in history
[37:04] something happened in the first three
[37:05] church ages that brought him to thyatira
[37:08] which is the fourth which is dark age
[37:09] and something happened coming out of the
[37:11] dark age that restored the bride
[37:12] restored the church back again
[37:14] so he's trying to lay down a pattern
[37:18] and here's the pattern that he lays down
[37:22] white horse red horse black horse he
[37:25] said that third age
[37:27] that third age is that third horse
[37:31] anybody hear him say that besides me so
[37:33] i'm not off on the deep end
[37:35] but it's different than what he said
[37:36] before right there's a reason
[37:39] then he said those last three those last
[37:42] three are justification
[37:44] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[37:48] first three and last three that leaves
[37:50] this one right here in the middle
[37:53] he talked about the first stages he
[37:55] talked about the last three
[37:56] but he didn't talk about this middle
[37:58] that's the dark ages the first three go
[37:59] to dark ages
[38:00] the last three come out of dark ages but
[38:03] that's thyatira
[38:06] amen brother brenham says a lot about
[38:09] thyatira
[38:11] in the fourth seal he says
[38:14] now notice now remember this antichrist
[38:17] himself
[38:18] being the man his bride which is the
[38:20] church was given a space to repent
[38:22] and she did not do it in the church age
[38:24] thyatira
[38:26] remember it see she's given space to
[38:28] repent but she didn't do it
[38:30] where in thyatira so let's go to genesis
[38:33] 2 and look at thyatira
[38:36] and we're going to find why brother
[38:37] branham is showing us this and pointing
[38:39] us to this
[38:40] in the scriptures
[38:44] now i want to stop and explain something
[38:47] just a minute
[38:49] when we see the four kingdoms head of
[38:52] gold
[38:53] breast and arms of silver belly and
[38:56] thighs of brass and legs of iron
[38:59] we see the four kingdoms those are four
[39:01] natural kingdoms
[39:02] that are going to trample down jerusalem
[39:06] but in the fourth kingdom remember
[39:08] everything runs in four
[39:09] in the fourth kingdom in rome under the
[39:11] roman
[39:12] church system then you have four horse
[39:15] riders
[39:16] so within the four you have four
[39:20] so when the when the when it moves from
[39:22] pagan rome
[39:23] to papal rome then you go right back
[39:25] through four stages again so you come
[39:28] down four stages
[39:29] in the fourth stage you go through four
[39:31] stages and it's always
[39:33] four the devil's always coming to his
[39:35] fullness in four
[39:39] all right revelations chapter two
[39:42] verse 18. and unto the angel of the
[39:46] church and thyatirite
[39:47] these things sayeth the son of god who
[39:49] had his eyes like unto a flame of fire
[39:53] and his feet are like fine brass
[39:56] i know thy works and thy charity and
[39:59] service and faith in thy patience and
[40:01] thy works
[40:02] and the last to be more than the first
[40:04] notwithstanding i have a few things
[40:06] against thee because thou
[40:08] suffers that woman jezebel which calleth
[40:10] herself a prophetess
[40:12] to teach and to seduce my servants and
[40:15] to commit fornication
[40:16] and to eat things sacrificed unto idols
[40:19] and i gave her space to repent of her
[40:21] fornication and she repented not behold
[40:24] i will cast into a bed
[40:26] in them that commit adultery with her
[40:27] into great tribulations
[40:29] except they repent of their deeds and i
[40:32] will kill her children with death
[40:33] and all the churches shall know that i
[40:36] am he
[40:37] which searcheth the reins and hearts and
[40:39] i will give unto every one of you
[40:41] according
[40:41] to your works so now brother branham
[40:45] comes and he points back to thyatira
[40:47] and when you go back in the church age
[40:49] and you read the admonition to thyatira
[40:51] now you see they've come to jezebel
[40:53] religion
[40:55] this is thyatira is the full power
[40:58] of the catholic church when you actually
[41:01] look at the the years
[41:02] of thyatira 606 to 15 20. i don't
[41:06] remember exactly why
[41:08] this is the peak of the catholic power
[41:10] when the catholic church came to full
[41:12] power
[41:12] and united church and state together
[41:15] because it's the height of the roman
[41:16] catholic empire
[41:17] the roman catholic empire was political
[41:20] amen
[41:21] and then the roman catholic church was
[41:23] religious and they were united together
[41:25] in thyatira and they came to the full
[41:27] power of the catholic church
[41:29] but coming out of that we would come to
[41:31] the reformation and the catholic church
[41:33] as united church and state
[41:34] would never be in the same power it was
[41:37] there
[41:38] it began to weaken and begin to minister
[41:40] so brother branham is showing
[41:42] that what happened to the catholic
[41:43] church is patterned in these first four
[41:45] church ages
[41:48] but then he's showing that the pattern
[41:50] will repeat again
[41:52] but it will repeat in the protestant
[41:54] churches
[41:55] because they're going to come right to
[41:57] their own tire they're going to come
[41:59] right to spiritual death
[42:01] and he comes to jezebel and he ties it
[42:02] together in thyatira and in thyatira he
[42:06] says
[42:06] you i have a problem you suffers that
[42:08] woman jezebel that says she's a
[42:10] prophetess and is not and is teaching
[42:12] fornication and idolatry and all of
[42:14] these things
[42:14] that's exactly what the catholic church
[42:16] was teaching and he says
[42:18] i will take her and cast her into a bed
[42:20] and those that commit fornication with
[42:22] her
[42:22] into great tribulation that's tying us
[42:26] right over to revelation 17
[42:28] and 18 the judgment of the
[42:32] it's in thyatira it's already prophesied
[42:34] in thyatira that he's going to take this
[42:36] jezebel
[42:37] which is the catholic church and he's
[42:39] going to cast her amen
[42:41] into a bed brother graham said hell and
[42:43] those that
[42:44] committed fornication with her into
[42:46] great tribulation that's the great
[42:47] tribulation
[42:48] and then he comes and he says and i will
[42:50] kill her children
[42:53] what are her children the protestant
[42:55] daughters he's going to take this
[42:56] jezebel
[42:57] and in thyatira she's judged but then
[43:00] he's going to take and he's going to
[43:01] kill her daughters
[43:03] so the pattern repeats friends now see
[43:07] this black horse then after he refused
[43:09] to repent and thyatira
[43:10] changes his ride from a black horse to a
[43:13] pale one
[43:14] death for his last ministry
[43:18] see after he refused to repent
[43:21] where and thyatira
[43:25] changes his ride from black horse to
[43:28] pale one
[43:29] death for his last ministry he's
[43:32] speaking here of the catholic church
[43:35] but the same thing has to repeat in our
[43:37] day
[43:38] so you can look at thyatira and whatever
[43:41] was in thyatira
[43:42] you can expect to see it now
[43:46] oh i hope that we can get to this and
[43:48] make it plain
[43:50] there you are thyatira age the dark age
[43:53] his black horse now turns to death
[43:55] for his last age we know that that the
[43:58] palers actually doesn't ride till the
[44:00] end of laodicea
[44:02] we understand that and brother branham
[44:03] understands that he hasn't forgotten
[44:05] what he's taught us
[44:06] what he's showing us is the pattern of a
[44:08] cycle of death
[44:10] where a church will come out in seeming
[44:12] innocency
[44:13] and begin to just deviate ever so
[44:15] slightly from the word
[44:16] but it'll follow this pattern through
[44:18] white horse then the red horse
[44:20] then it comes to full power and under
[44:22] thy attire it comes to full power
[44:24] and is given a space to repent but she
[44:26] would not repent
[44:27] and now he's he's put judgment upon her
[44:30] and thyatira
[44:31] and that's why you see the catholic
[44:32] church fall and the protestant church
[44:34] rise
[44:37] but the protestant church is going to do
[44:38] exactly
[44:40] exactly to the t what the catholic
[44:42] church did they're going to come out in
[44:43] innocence
[44:44] they're going to come out with the word
[44:45] and then they're going to begin to
[44:46] organize and they're going to take that
[44:48] nicolaitan spirit
[44:49] that started the whole ball rolling in
[44:51] the catholic church and they're going to
[44:52] bring it right in amongst their banks
[44:54] they're going to have schools and
[44:55] they're going to have priests and
[44:56] they're going to put one preacher over
[44:57] top another preacher
[44:58] and they're going to divide themselves
[45:00] into different camps amen they're going
[45:02] to do the same
[45:03] thing by developing their system and
[45:05] they're going to fall into the same
[45:07] exact place that the catholic church
[45:10] fell to
[45:11] that's why the catholic church came amen
[45:14] remember the holy roman
[45:15] empire was a different entity seemingly
[45:18] than the roman catholic church
[45:21] one was religious one was a collection
[45:23] of nation-states
[45:24] bound together under an emperor called
[45:27] the holy roman empire
[45:29] and it was the pope who first crowned
[45:31] the emperor
[45:33] and it was the unification of church and
[45:35] state
[45:37] but the holy roman empire the political
[45:39] union of these nations
[45:41] it fell apart that's why there's
[45:42] prophesied in the scripture
[45:44] that there's going to be an image
[45:45] erected to the beast and what's it going
[45:47] to be
[45:48] it's going to be a collection not of
[45:49] nations but a collection of
[45:50] denominations
[45:52] the world council of churches bringing
[45:54] about a collective force
[45:56] and going to unite it right back to the
[45:59] beast
[46:01] right back to the catholic church
[46:04] and when it does it's going to unify
[46:07] political and spiritual forces back
[46:11] together again what are we coming back
[46:13] to we are coming back to thyatira
[46:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[46:21] but praise god we've got an injection
[46:23] seat
[46:25] we've got our hand on the handle it's
[46:27] called the rapture of the church
[46:29] before too long we're going to see the
[46:30] system building and it's getting closer
[46:32] and closer
[46:32] but before they shut her up he's going
[46:34] to take her up
[46:36] he's going to pull the ejection seat and
[46:37] we're out of here friends
[46:40] but this whole world all of these church
[46:42] systems all these organizations
[46:44] they're going right back as fast as they
[46:46] can to the mother harlot
[46:55] dietary is the dark ages black horse now
[46:57] turns to death for this last ministry
[46:59] see
[46:59] how the church ages blend in with the
[47:01] seals just perfect then we know it's
[47:03] right the holy spirit
[47:04] makes no mistake he gave us a greater
[47:06] vindication the last time when we got
[47:08] the church ages done back there you know
[47:11] see the loving long-suffering of god
[47:12] before he passed judgment upon her
[47:14] he gave her a place to repent and it's
[47:17] in the name of the lord i say this
[47:19] he's give the protestant church the same
[47:21] thing she won't do it
[47:23] these messages shook everywhere and she
[47:25] won't
[47:26] do it brother ram said his message is
[47:29] shook everywhere
[47:30] and she won't do it she won't come back
[47:34] now i want to keep going with this
[47:36] pattern and i want you to see
[47:41] brother van priest a message called the
[47:42] restoration of the bride tree
[47:44] that this bride tree that came out in
[47:46] pentecost was eaten down through
[47:48] how many stages of insects four
[47:52] how many gentile powers to trodden down
[47:54] jerusalem four
[47:55] how many horse riders four it's always
[47:57] going to be for
[47:58] when it tries to destroy the seed
[48:02] another thing i want to mention and i
[48:03] just want you to keep in your mind
[48:05] whatever happens naturally to israel
[48:08] is what's happening spiritually to the
[48:11] church
[48:12] so when you see these four gentile
[48:14] powers and you see that the four gentile
[48:17] powers what are they doing they're
[48:18] trying to take jerusalem
[48:21] they're trying to snuff out jerusalem
[48:23] until finally rome
[48:25] tramples jerusalem completely down and
[48:27] destroys it in 78d
[48:29] what was the purpose coming through
[48:30] these four stages was to destroy
[48:32] jerusalem
[48:33] so coming through these coming through
[48:35] these four horse riders is to do what
[48:37] destroy heavenly jerusalem and story
[48:40] mount zion destroy the bride
[48:42] the whole intent is to destroy and
[48:44] trample underfoot the bride
[48:46] so what happens to israel is what's been
[48:48] happening to the church
[48:51] that's why in thyatira it got ate down
[48:54] to just a stump
[48:56] these these insects ate it down to just
[48:58] a stump but there was a promise of
[49:00] restoration
[49:02] let's look at joel if we turn in the
[49:03] bibles to joel
[49:05] we're going to see four stages again
[49:08] now joel's an interesting prophecy
[49:10] brother branham picks up joel
[49:12] and he teaches the message restoration
[49:15] of the bride tree
[49:16] which he refers to over and over and
[49:18] over again
[49:20] but in that the the literal prophecy in
[49:24] joel
[49:25] is physical to israel
[49:29] and it's spiritual to us the same
[49:32] exact prophecy is literal to them
[49:36] in a spiritual to us see literally
[49:39] the four stages of this insect that ate
[49:42] down
[49:42] it literally happened to israel through
[49:46] babylon
[49:46] medo-persia greece in in rome
[49:50] but spiritually it's happened to the
[49:52] church
[49:55] joel 1 verse 1 the word of the lord came
[49:58] to joel the son of
[49:59] pathwell hear this ye old men and give
[50:02] ear all you inhabitants of the land
[50:04] have this been in your days or even in
[50:06] the days of your fathers tell your
[50:08] children of it
[50:09] and let your children tell their
[50:10] children and their children another
[50:12] generation
[50:13] that which the palmer worm hath left had
[50:15] the locust eaten
[50:16] and that which the locust hath left at
[50:18] the cankerworm eaten and that which the
[50:20] cankerworm had left
[50:21] had the caterpillar eaten awake you
[50:23] drunkards and weep and howl all you
[50:26] drinkers all you drinkers of the wine
[50:28] because of the new wine
[50:29] for it is cut off from your mouth for a
[50:32] nation has come upon my land a strong
[50:35] and without number whose teeth are the
[50:37] teeth of a lion
[50:38] and he hath the cheek teeth of a great
[50:40] lion he hath laid my vine waste and
[50:42] barked my fig tree
[50:43] he hath made it clean bare and casted
[50:46] away the branches thereof are made white
[50:49] so here he's talking about this great
[50:51] nation that comes with teeth
[50:53] like a lion and he's barked the vine
[50:56] tree and the vine is always
[50:58] israel israel was the vine that the
[51:00] husbandman planted and he digged about
[51:02] and he put a
[51:03] hedge about and he planted a choice vine
[51:06] and this nation came in
[51:07] and he barked it way do he stripped all
[51:08] the bark away from it and so it would
[51:10] die
[51:11] and that this literally happened to
[51:14] israel
[51:14] but it also literally happened to the
[51:17] church
[51:18] we're standing in a place now where we
[51:19] can look back and we can see the
[51:21] prophecies already been fulfilled
[51:23] and the prophecy is being fulfilled
[51:25] again
[51:26] a third time same prophecy so joel is
[51:29] speaking of natural and spiritual
[51:32] so we see these four in in the english
[51:35] they give them these names palmer worm
[51:37] locust
[51:37] canker worm caterpillar but it's really
[51:40] all locusts these are all locusts
[51:42] and these are different stages of
[51:43] development of the locust
[51:45] and they all eat this down until you get
[51:47] the thyatira until there's nothing left
[51:49] but a stump
[51:55] brother bam said now as he brought forth
[51:57] the first bride tree and the locust and
[51:59] palmer room was eaten down
[52:00] he is restoring the second tree bringing
[52:03] it up from
[52:04] them predestinated roots that cannot die
[52:06] they're standing by the rivers it's
[52:08] living in the waters
[52:09] it wouldn't show itself but it's there
[52:12] anyhow
[52:13] now it's starting notice the same insect
[52:15] as he restores back the same thing by
[52:17] the same way
[52:18] the first when that tree started to come
[52:20] forth out of catholicism was martin
[52:22] luther
[52:22] he preached justification the second
[52:25] angel was john wesley he preached
[52:26] sanctification
[52:28] luther preached justification just shall
[52:30] live by faith wesley preached
[52:31] sanctification second indefinite work of
[52:33] grace
[52:34] and then come the holy ghost just as he
[52:36] built the tree up the first time
[52:38] here he is restoring again in the same
[52:40] manner the second time
[52:43] so let's read joel chapter 2 together
[52:45] let's just go over to joel chapter 2.
[52:56] verse 23 joel 2 and 23 be glad then you
[52:59] children of zion and rejoice in the lord
[53:01] your god
[53:02] for he hath given you the former rain
[53:04] moderately and he will cause to come
[53:06] down for you the rain
[53:07] the former rain and the latter rain in
[53:10] the first month
[53:11] brother brennan picks this up and he
[53:12] tells us the former rain was the
[53:14] teaching rain
[53:15] and the latter rain is the harvest rain
[53:17] that will fall out
[53:18] and brother ram takes this right to his
[53:19] ministry and they say the
[53:21] people are preaching we're in the latter
[53:22] rain he said how can you be in the
[53:24] latter until you've had the former rain
[53:25] and the former rain is a prophet that's
[53:27] supposed to come in this day
[53:29] and and teach the children of israel and
[53:32] when he comes
[53:32] then there'll be a ladder rain poured
[53:34] out and in the ministry there'll be a
[53:36] former and latter reign together
[53:39] poured out and so this prophecy is a
[53:41] prophecy to
[53:42] physical israel that also applies to the
[53:45] bride of jesus christ
[53:49] so let's read it again be glad then you
[53:51] children of zion and rejoice in the lord
[53:52] your god for he has given you the former
[53:54] reign moderately and he will cause to
[53:56] come down for you
[53:57] the rain the former rain and the latter
[53:59] rain in the first
[54:00] month and because the former and latter
[54:02] rain is going to come together
[54:04] they were supposed to be rejoicing
[54:06] because the former rain and the latter
[54:08] rain
[54:08] is the teaching or planting rain and the
[54:11] harvest rain
[54:12] and it's showing here that when god
[54:14] restores he's going to restore quickly
[54:16] when he brings back he's going to re
[54:18] bring back quickly he's going to restore
[54:20] and there's going to come a time when
[54:21] when israel is going to come back into
[54:23] the land
[54:24] and quickly he's going to restore that
[54:26] that's going to be the former rain in
[54:27] the in the latter rain
[54:28] falling right together so that they can
[54:31] plant and harvest
[54:31] plant and harvest plant and harvest
[54:36] this is going to get good hopefully in a
[54:37] minute verse 24
[54:40] and the floor shall be full of wheat and
[54:43] the fat
[54:43] shall overflow with wine and oil when
[54:46] this former ladder rain together
[54:48] all of a sudden you're going to have the
[54:49] seed word all over the place
[54:52] amen in the oil and the wine the holy
[54:54] ghost and the stimulation of revelation
[54:57] amen and the vats are going to be full
[54:59] of the wine and the oil
[55:01] and i will restore to you the years that
[55:03] the locust hath eaten the cankerworm the
[55:05] palmer worm
[55:06] the the the caterpillar the palmer were
[55:08] my great army which i sent among you
[55:10] and you shall eaten plenty and be
[55:12] satisfied and praise the name of the
[55:14] lord your god
[55:15] that hath dealt wondrously with you and
[55:17] my people shall never
[55:19] be ashamed and you shall know that i am
[55:22] in the midst of israel and that i am the
[55:23] lord your god
[55:24] and none else and my people shall never
[55:28] be ashamed
[55:32] so god promised that he would bring back
[55:33] through justification sanctification
[55:36] the baptism of the holy ghost and he
[55:38] would restore
[55:40] back all the years that had been eaten
[55:43] it was all coming back now i want you to
[55:46] think of this prophecy
[55:47] as israel and the church running on
[55:49] parallel tracks
[55:50] because the the rome went in in 70 a.d
[55:54] and trodden down jerusalem and jerusalem
[55:57] had never been the same in israel had
[55:59] never been the same from that point on
[56:01] they were dispersed amongst all the
[56:02] nations israel itself turned into a
[56:04] wasteland an utter wasteland
[56:06] and jerusalem fell into arab hands and
[56:09] it was that way
[56:10] for for hundreds and hundreds and
[56:11] hundreds of years but there come a time
[56:14] and that time was around the second war
[56:16] war amen and it actually started in the
[56:18] first world war
[56:20] in the first world war there was a jew
[56:22] who helped
[56:23] finance the war for for england
[56:26] and in the thank you to that jew and
[56:28] some jews banded together to help
[56:29] finance the war
[56:30] they wanted to know what they could do
[56:32] to thank them and and
[56:34] there was a a a a a crime made or a plea
[56:38] he says if you want to thank us give a
[56:40] place for my people a homeland for the
[56:42] jewish people
[56:43] because friends they were dispersed
[56:44] there was no place for them
[56:48] and there there in world war one
[56:52] there was a decree sign called the
[56:53] belfast declaration
[56:56] and that declaration gave the jews
[56:58] because
[56:59] england was in control at that time of
[57:01] palestine
[57:02] gave them a homeland a place that they
[57:04] could return to
[57:07] but you could see it was just the
[57:08] beginnings coming back
[57:11] no now remember that came
[57:14] i can't remember the year it was 1918
[57:17] 1919 something like that that that was
[57:20] degree
[57:21] but remember there's parallel tracks
[57:23] here
[57:25] the war breaks out and as a thank you
[57:28] they've given a promised land
[57:31] but there's a prophet that's going to be
[57:32] born to the gentiles in 1909
[57:36] and and though it's going to be a long
[57:37] time from there before we start to see
[57:39] things happening
[57:40] there's also this belfar declaration in
[57:43] world war one taking place in a similar
[57:45] time
[57:45] within a handful of years of one another
[57:47] because god
[57:48] is going to restore all the years that
[57:51] the palmer worm the cankerworm the
[57:53] caterpillar
[57:54] and the locust had eaten up and so you
[57:56] see these parallel tracks
[57:57] and then we come to world war ii and in
[57:59] world war ii we have the holocaust that
[58:01] takes place and
[58:03] and as a thank you or as a not a thank
[58:05] you but
[58:06] as a measure to the jews who suffered so
[58:08] much in world war ii
[58:10] the nations got together and decided to
[58:12] give them a nation and petition them off
[58:14] a piece of land that they could return
[58:15] to and have their own nation
[58:17] and so at the same time they're doing
[58:19] that the same time the prophet of god is
[58:21] getting a commission to begin his
[58:22] ministry
[58:24] to begin his first pool and second pool
[58:26] ministry and you see the two are coming
[58:28] up together
[58:28] what's he re doing he's restoring all
[58:32] he all the years that this palmer worm
[58:34] can't go he's doing it in the natural
[58:35] and he's doing it in the spiritual
[58:37] at the same time
[58:41] oh i just love this
[58:44] and then the prophet begins his is
[58:46] healing campaigns he begins the first
[58:48] full second pool ministry
[58:50] and we come all the way through and he
[58:51] comes up and and in the nation of israel
[58:54] it fights his battles it fights its war
[58:56] and it establishes itself in the
[58:58] homeland as its own nation
[59:00] and and these things are growing up
[59:02] together this is just miraculous to me
[59:04] that these things can be taking place at
[59:06] the exact same time
[59:07] that there's a prophet to the gentiles
[59:09] and he's bringing back the word
[59:10] amen as israel is taking back the land
[59:13] because the land to us is the same as
[59:15] the word to israel
[59:16] and they're taking back their land and
[59:18] what's happening and
[59:19] the scriptures say that the land
[59:21] responds to israel and israel went into
[59:23] a desert in a few years it begins to
[59:25] blossom like a rose
[59:27] because they couldn't they couldn't get
[59:28] anything to happen with this land
[59:30] egypt couldn't do anything with it
[59:31] england couldn't do anything with it the
[59:33] ottoman empire couldn't do anything with
[59:34] it the palestinians couldn't do anything
[59:36] with it
[59:36] for for a couple thousand years it laid
[59:38] desolate and wasted and turned to a
[59:40] desert and they didn't grow anything
[59:42] there
[59:43] they had some bedouins who had passed
[59:46] through and grazed a little bit of
[59:47] of cattle a little bit of goats and
[59:49] sheep and that's all they had they had
[59:50] nothing
[59:51] until the the true seed of god that the
[59:54] lineage that was supposed to be in that
[59:55] land
[59:56] when they started moving back into that
[59:58] land amen
[59:59] then the land became to flourish it
[1:00:01] began to open up
[1:00:02] and give its fruits and give its grass
[1:00:04] and give and
[1:00:06] now it's a fertile land
[1:00:09] because the word was laying desolate and
[1:00:11] the word would only respond to the
[1:00:13] children of god
[1:00:14] and it had been eaten down to that all
[1:00:16] we had was an understanding that there
[1:00:18] was a messiah and jesus died a couple
[1:00:20] thousand years ago
[1:00:21] didn't know where we came from didn't
[1:00:22] know where we're going didn't know what
[1:00:24] our purpose was
[1:00:25] we were scattered amongst the
[1:00:26] denominations but there come
[1:00:28] a call that was pulling out of the
[1:00:30] denominations bringing back into the
[1:00:32] homeland
[1:00:33] of people and this word was going to
[1:00:35] respond in this restoration
[1:00:37] to who to the people of god and all of a
[1:00:40] sudden
[1:00:41] the word the scripture has been laying
[1:00:43] there it's been desolate it's been
[1:00:45] trodden over and all of a sudden that
[1:00:46] one
[1:00:47] scripture is going to start producing
[1:00:48] fruits amen and now we move over to this
[1:00:51] book of the bible and it's going to
[1:00:52] start producing fruits
[1:00:53] and ruth has been laying there for
[1:00:55] thousands of years and nobody knew it
[1:00:57] was about a gentile bride
[1:01:01] hallelujah esther had been laying there
[1:01:06] for thousands of years and nobody knew
[1:01:09] that it was talking about a gentile
[1:01:10] bride
[1:01:11] until until the people start moving back
[1:01:14] under the restoration
[1:01:15] restoring back this is the prophecy of
[1:01:18] joel friends this is in your life and in
[1:01:20] my life
[1:01:20] this is the prophecy of joel taking
[1:01:22] place before our eyes you can read
[1:01:24] on jewish history and you can see with
[1:01:27] your eyes
[1:01:27] what's happening in the natural but hey
[1:01:29] i want to tell you something
[1:01:31] if you'll get into the message and talk
[1:01:32] to someone that's been around here
[1:01:34] amen since the 60s they'll tell you
[1:01:36] what's been happening in the
[1:01:38] supernatural and the spiritual they're
[1:01:40] running on parallel tracks
[1:01:44] same thing that trodden down jerusalem
[1:01:47] rome is the same thing that came through
[1:01:50] four stages of horse riders
[1:01:52] and trot down the church
[1:01:55] but i will restore saith the lord
[1:01:59] seals come in 1963
[1:02:04] preaches the seals god
[1:02:08] has him prophesy again and he goes
[1:02:10] around and elaborates
[1:02:12] and brings so many truths as he preaches
[1:02:15] after the seals
[1:02:18] amen and then the prophet passes off the
[1:02:20] scene
[1:02:21] but in 1967 israel is in their homeland
[1:02:25] but they're not in jerusalem
[1:02:28] but after the seals are preached now
[1:02:31] something's got to
[1:02:32] further something's got to move for
[1:02:34] israel too because the bride's being
[1:02:36] moved into a different position
[1:02:37] after the opening of the seals amen it's
[1:02:39] coming back of mount zion it's coming
[1:02:41] back
[1:02:42] a holy jerusalem so now in 1967 the six
[1:02:45] day war breaks out
[1:02:47] and in that war israel takes back
[1:02:49] jerusalem
[1:02:52] hallelujah the holy city of god comes
[1:02:56] back
[1:02:58] the temple of god amen is not built but
[1:03:01] the land it comes back
[1:03:04] in 1967 do you see the parallel tracks
[1:03:10] there was a problem after they got there
[1:03:15] after they got the land after they got
[1:03:18] the temple mount
[1:03:19] after they got the city of david after
[1:03:21] they got it all back
[1:03:24] they gave it away
[1:03:27] for what for political peace
[1:03:31] still today there's an arab regiment
[1:03:34] that guards the temple mount and polices
[1:03:36] the temple mount
[1:03:38] not israel and we know in god's
[1:03:41] timepiece some more things have to
[1:03:43] happen
[1:03:44] but you see after the opening of the
[1:03:46] seals they take back jerusalem
[1:03:49] they come to the temple mount the
[1:03:50] soldiers stand there as they hoist the
[1:03:52] star of david up over the temple mount
[1:03:54] and soldiers heart and soldiers begin to
[1:03:56] weep and begin to cry and begin to sing
[1:03:58] begin to dance because why the hope of
[1:04:01] israel is in jerusalem
[1:04:02] amen the hope of the jewish people is in
[1:04:04] jerusalem everything that they
[1:04:06] they're taught to believe in everything
[1:04:07] that they were told to do centered
[1:04:09] around
[1:04:10] temple worship in jerusalem and here
[1:04:12] they they got it back but they're
[1:04:13] political re
[1:04:14] the leaders to keep peace and keep
[1:04:16] themselves in favor with the rest of the
[1:04:18] world
[1:04:19] they gave back control of most of
[1:04:23] [Music]
[1:04:24] jerusalem
[1:04:26] i wonder if things don't run on parallel
[1:04:28] tracks
[1:04:32] come to everything and then
[1:04:35] compromise a little bit for peace
[1:04:39] let down the bar a little bit just to
[1:04:41] have a little bit of peace
[1:04:43] this is the restoration but in this
[1:04:46] period of time
[1:04:48] israel's growing in strength
[1:04:51] growing in strength they have another
[1:04:52] war in 1973 and they win that one
[1:04:54] decisively and they're growing in
[1:04:56] strength
[1:04:56] and the bride is growing in strength
[1:04:59] taking more of the land
[1:05:00] amen amen cultivating the land pulling
[1:05:04] out of the land the resources that they
[1:05:06] need amen
[1:05:08] and now israel stands today a military
[1:05:10] powerhouse
[1:05:13] a wealthy nation an
[1:05:16] independent woman
[1:05:21] praise god think about where israel is
[1:05:23] today
[1:05:24] israel can fight her own battle she can
[1:05:26] defend herself she can feed herself she
[1:05:28] can clothe herself
[1:05:29] she's got industry amen she's got
[1:05:31] agriculture she they just found
[1:05:33] oil in israel and they found natural gas
[1:05:36] in israel
[1:05:37] what's happening israel's becoming
[1:05:39] totally
[1:05:40] self-sufficient where israel does not
[1:05:43] need
[1:05:43] anything from any other nation and
[1:05:45] anything from anywhere else to survive
[1:05:50] and the bride of jesus christ is coming
[1:05:52] and to be an independent woman
[1:05:54] where she doesn't need any other
[1:05:55] theological understanding
[1:05:57] she doesn't need help from anybody else
[1:05:59] from any other denomination
[1:06:00] she's come back and she's cultivating
[1:06:03] her land her word
[1:06:04] everything she has need of is right here
[1:06:07] and everything israel needed
[1:06:09] oil it's in the land gas it's in the
[1:06:11] land fruits and vegetables it's in the
[1:06:13] land
[1:06:13] textiles it's in the land amen meat it's
[1:06:16] in the land
[1:06:17] it's all in the land and they're coming
[1:06:20] back to complete independence and the
[1:06:22] bride is coming back to complete
[1:06:23] independence
[1:06:24] because she's digging around in her land
[1:06:26] she's irrigating it with the spirit
[1:06:28] amen she's cultivating all the time in
[1:06:31] the land
[1:06:32] and the land now is producing everything
[1:06:34] that she has need of
[1:06:36] what is this this is joel's prophecy
[1:06:39] being fulfilled now we're we're in the
[1:06:42] former and
[1:06:43] in the latter falling together
[1:06:48] this has been going on for just over 50
[1:06:50] years
[1:06:52] look at the thousands and thousands of
[1:06:54] years that man have been on the planet
[1:06:56] and look what's happened to israel in
[1:06:59] just over 50 years
[1:07:02] if you if you read anything on israel
[1:07:05] and you it's
[1:07:05] mind-blowing what has happened there is
[1:07:07] a people oh my goodness
[1:07:09] there's a people who whose language had
[1:07:12] utterly died
[1:07:16] there's a language of faith in the bride
[1:07:19] that had utterly died
[1:07:23] there was a language that had utterly
[1:07:25] died it was only held together through
[1:07:27] some documents
[1:07:28] into the rabbinical order through the
[1:07:30] priest amen there was a people with no
[1:07:33] nation
[1:07:34] no homeland no capital amen they had no
[1:07:37] organization to unite them together they
[1:07:39] had they had no
[1:07:40] system to keep them tied together they
[1:07:42] were totally dispersed
[1:07:44] totally on their own without a language
[1:07:46] without a headquarters without
[1:07:48] a national home with nothing that now
[1:07:51] their language has revived
[1:07:53] so never in the history of the world has
[1:07:56] an ancient language
[1:07:57] ever revived first time ever never in
[1:08:00] the history of world
[1:08:01] has a dispersed nation occupied for
[1:08:03] thousands of years
[1:08:04] by foreigners has it ever come back into
[1:08:06] the hands of the original owners
[1:08:08] that's never happened before what you're
[1:08:10] seeing has
[1:08:11] never happened before
[1:08:14] [Applause]
[1:08:18] i will restore all the years
[1:08:25] now she's an independent woman
[1:08:30] israel's totally independent becoming
[1:08:33] completely self-sufficient
[1:08:36] why because she's going to be cut off
[1:08:38] from the rest of the world
[1:08:40] and she's going to stand on her own and
[1:08:42] the bride
[1:08:44] is becoming totally self-sufficient
[1:08:48] why she was brought back under joel's
[1:08:51] prophecy to her land
[1:08:54] and she's been cultivating the land and
[1:08:57] the land is producing
[1:08:58] every single thing she needs
[1:09:03] there's nothing that we need to overcome
[1:09:06] in this age
[1:09:07] that doesn't come from our land
[1:09:13] tell you what friends i'm excited
[1:09:18] you just watch israel brother brahma
[1:09:20] said if you want to know what time we're
[1:09:22] in
[1:09:22] watch israel
[1:09:25] watch israel the church
[1:09:29] and the the church of natural the church
[1:09:31] spiritual
[1:09:32] israel and the church are running on
[1:09:33] these parallel tracks
[1:09:35] and this prophecy pertains to both
[1:09:40] we saw them go down into utter ruin
[1:09:42] through romanism
[1:09:43] trample them down into nothing and we
[1:09:46] saw the church get trampled down into
[1:09:48] nothing through romanism
[1:09:49] but there's a restoration been taking
[1:09:51] place
[1:09:53] and in the in the last time there will
[1:09:56] be a former
[1:09:57] latter rain falling together and the
[1:09:59] last time the prophet of god came
[1:10:01] and the former and the latter rain fell
[1:10:04] together
[1:10:04] and it's falling now friends
[1:10:09] the the desert is blossoming like a rose
[1:10:11] now
[1:10:12] israel israel is one of the main
[1:10:16] exporters of certain vegetables and
[1:10:17] fruit to the world
[1:10:20] israel is now feeding
[1:10:24] their enemies israel
[1:10:27] is now sending produce all over the
[1:10:30] world
[1:10:30] i mean if you eat a cucumber now it's
[1:10:32] got a pretty good chance it came from
[1:10:34] israel
[1:10:35] they they they're the number one
[1:10:36] exporter of cucumbers
[1:10:38] they export all kinds of fruits and
[1:10:40] vegetables and now
[1:10:42] the food is coming from the land
[1:10:46] how many times do you meet people amen
[1:10:48] and they have a need in their life and
[1:10:50] you've got some vegetables amen that
[1:10:51] come out of the word
[1:10:52] you got some fruit and now what is it
[1:10:54] now the denominations are eating from
[1:10:56] your hand now
[1:10:58] you're feeding amen you're not a
[1:11:00] desolate woman anymore
[1:11:01] you know who you are you've got your
[1:11:03] language restored your identities come
[1:11:05] back
[1:11:06] you've moved into your land you've
[1:11:08] cultivated your soil and not only do you
[1:11:09] have enough for you
[1:11:10] now you've got enough to go back and
[1:11:12] feed those old systems amen
[1:11:15] if they would just realize where they're
[1:11:16] getting their food from
[1:11:18] if the arabs and palestinians would just
[1:11:20] realize where they're getting their food
[1:11:22] from but they won't
[1:11:25] hallelujah if others could just realize
[1:11:28] where the food's coming from
[1:11:32] praise god
[1:11:35] see there was four stages to destruction
[1:11:40] four kingdoms four horse riders
[1:11:44] four insects four stages of the same
[1:11:47] insect
[1:11:48] all telling the same story
[1:11:51] brother ramen says notice the same
[1:11:53] insect that little rascal the same
[1:11:55] insect that started
[1:11:57] and killed the tree in the beginning
[1:11:59] started right back at them
[1:12:00] lutheran free branches but what it can't
[1:12:04] kill it it can't kill it
[1:12:06] because god has done said i will restore
[1:12:09] the insect started on luther to kill all
[1:12:12] the lutheran branches
[1:12:13] it came right over wesley and killed all
[1:12:14] the wesley branches but the main part of
[1:12:16] the tree
[1:12:17] keeps going because there's a prophecy
[1:12:21] that i will restore so i'll look at this
[1:12:23] it's laying in the fourth seal
[1:12:24] just as we wrap up but you see
[1:12:28] the way brother branham talks in the
[1:12:29] fourth seal he's showing
[1:12:31] he's not showing the entire church age
[1:12:33] he's showing the catholic system
[1:12:35] it moved through these first church ages
[1:12:37] and it came to death
[1:12:39] it came to the judgment of jezebel and
[1:12:41] thyatira
[1:12:42] in in revelation chapter 2. we just read
[1:12:45] that
[1:12:46] but then the same cycle has to repeat
[1:12:49] for the protestants
[1:12:51] so then you see the same cycle starts
[1:12:53] again it started for lutherans it
[1:12:55] started for wesleyan to start for
[1:12:56] pentecost
[1:12:57] it starts for every system that comes
[1:12:59] out comes out under the white horse and
[1:13:00] very quickly moves all the way down
[1:13:03] so this cycle is a repeating cycle in
[1:13:06] the church ages once for the catholics
[1:13:07] next for the protestants and at the end
[1:13:10] the protestants amen
[1:13:12] they will build a system an image to the
[1:13:14] beast
[1:13:16] and they'll connect it back to the
[1:13:18] mother
[1:13:21] amen and then the pope will sit on the
[1:13:23] throne
[1:13:26] the protestants are coming right back to
[1:13:27] thyatira
[1:13:30] right back to the unifying of church and
[1:13:33] state
[1:13:34] the holy roman empire the holy roman
[1:13:36] church united together
[1:13:38] when they had full power full control
[1:13:41] unquestionable
[1:13:42] authority and now this double
[1:13:45] cycle is bringing the protestant move
[1:13:48] under the world council churches
[1:13:49] bringing about an image to the beast
[1:13:51] we'll tie it right back to thyatira
[1:13:54] where there once again be a political
[1:13:56] and a religious unification and complete
[1:14:00] and absolute power will be restored to
[1:14:03] this system
[1:14:05] i thank god i won't be here
[1:14:11] see like he gave egypt he gave egypt
[1:14:14] place to repent
[1:14:15] what was that last plague was death
[1:14:18] that's the last plague that's hit the
[1:14:19] pentecostal church it's
[1:14:21] spiritual death she's dead that is in
[1:14:24] the name of the lord
[1:14:25] she's spiritually dead he gave her place
[1:14:28] to repent and she rejected it
[1:14:30] now she's dead she'll never rise
[1:14:33] again why is this so important for the
[1:14:35] pentecostals because that was the last
[1:14:37] stage
[1:14:39] that was laodicea and now brother
[1:14:41] branham's not saying
[1:14:42] there's any hope there's any
[1:14:43] resurrection he's saying she has already
[1:14:46] come to the fourth horse
[1:14:47] she's already come to spiritual death
[1:14:50] and this thing's going to tie right back
[1:14:51] into the catholic church
[1:14:55] but all the bugs that hell can turn
[1:14:58] loose on her will never stop her
[1:15:01] no communism catholicism no nothing else
[1:15:03] will stop it
[1:15:04] i will restore saith the lord all the
[1:15:07] man-made roman trees will never hang in
[1:15:09] there all the graves will never keep it
[1:15:11] there
[1:15:11] all the big denominational stones laying
[1:15:13] at the door will never keep it in there
[1:15:15] i will restore saith the lord there will
[1:15:17] be an easter i'll bring forth that same
[1:15:19] church in its same power
[1:15:22] same church in its same power i'll bring
[1:15:24] that bride out just like she was
[1:15:26] back there with the same signs the same
[1:15:28] fruit the same thing that they did
[1:15:30] i'll bring her back again
[1:15:34] when he says i'll bring her back again
[1:15:35] what is he talking about he's talking
[1:15:37] about the pentecostal fathers
[1:15:39] the first church this restoration brings
[1:15:42] us right back
[1:15:43] to this the restoration in israel is
[1:15:47] going to take it right back to the
[1:15:48] golden age of solomon
[1:15:50] when jesus christ sits on the throne but
[1:15:53] our restoration will take us right back
[1:15:55] to pentecost
[1:15:57] hallelujah
[1:16:00] i've skipped almost all my notes
[1:16:04] i don't even know if there's anything
[1:16:05] worth reading now
[1:16:08] praise god
[1:16:13] message be not afraid romanism and so
[1:16:17] forth
[1:16:18] eat that beautiful bride tree of christ
[1:16:20] down until it became a stump
[1:16:22] but god brought it right back out of
[1:16:24] that stump right up through these
[1:16:25] lutheran age right up through the
[1:16:26] wesleyan
[1:16:27] right up to the pentecostal wage and now
[1:16:30] it's in the evening light
[1:16:31] i will restore saith the lord all the
[1:16:33] years at the cankerworm caterpillar
[1:16:35] i will restore again that church in her
[1:16:38] beauty
[1:16:39] that church in her power
[1:16:44] when you look at israel and see the
[1:16:46] conditions she's in now
[1:16:49] you know israel when they first moved
[1:16:52] into their land
[1:16:53] they didn't have any planes they didn't
[1:16:55] have any guns
[1:16:57] they had to immediately fight a war and
[1:16:59] they had nothing to fight a war with so
[1:17:02] they had to gather up what
[1:17:03] money they could scrape together and
[1:17:04] they had to buy whatever
[1:17:06] armament they could buy and smuggle in
[1:17:08] and they weren't even allowed to have it
[1:17:09] before they were declared as a nation
[1:17:11] because these these countries couldn't
[1:17:13] sell planes and
[1:17:14] and and bombs and and guns to a country
[1:17:17] that wasn't a nation and they weren't a
[1:17:19] nation yet
[1:17:20] and so before they had to sneak it in
[1:17:21] and smuggle it in
[1:17:23] and they finally got it in and they they
[1:17:24] bought from this one and they bought
[1:17:26] from this one and they bought from that
[1:17:27] and they brought together all that they
[1:17:29] could piece together with their meager
[1:17:30] means
[1:17:31] and all these they got some planes from
[1:17:33] here some guns from there and they put
[1:17:34] it together
[1:17:35] and they defended themselves and they
[1:17:37] become a nation
[1:17:39] then when they become a nation they
[1:17:40] would buy from the us and buy from this
[1:17:42] and buy from that
[1:17:44] but now one of israel's main industries
[1:17:48] is weapons
[1:17:51] they are one of the main exporters of
[1:17:54] weaponry in the world
[1:17:59] why because nobody's going to take
[1:18:02] israel
[1:18:06] they've done been there they've been
[1:18:08] down the road of desolation
[1:18:10] they've been down the road of ruin
[1:18:13] they've been down the road
[1:18:14] of separation into denominations and
[1:18:16] they're not going back that way
[1:18:18] they've been under the trampling down of
[1:18:20] the roman system and they're not going
[1:18:22] back that way
[1:18:23] and the bride of christ is not going
[1:18:24] back either she's been given a sword and
[1:18:27] a sword has been placed in her hand
[1:18:29] and she's not piecing together little
[1:18:30] stones from here and a little rock out
[1:18:32] of
[1:18:33] out of methodism and a little rock out
[1:18:35] of baptism
[1:18:36] doctrine she's come to where she's been
[1:18:38] given the king sword
[1:18:40] it's been placed in her hand and she's
[1:18:41] been given the faith a strong hand of
[1:18:43] faith to wield the sword because she's
[1:18:45] not going back into denominationalism
[1:18:47] she's not going to be trampled down by
[1:18:49] rome anymore
[1:18:50] she's not going to accept any false
[1:18:51] doctrines she's come back to the word
[1:18:53] and she's staying in her land
[1:18:55] and there's nothing going to drive her
[1:18:57] off of her land
[1:18:59] it's not going to be disappointment or
[1:19:01] discouragement or family issues
[1:19:03] or job problems nothing is going to
[1:19:05] drive her off of her land
[1:19:07] she's already been down that road and
[1:19:08] she's not going again
[1:19:13] a huge percentage
[1:19:16] of israel's finances goes to defense
[1:19:21] they're constant on alert for the enemy
[1:19:25] constantly wary of the enemy coming in
[1:19:28] they are literally surrounded by
[1:19:31] demon forces
[1:19:36] want to paint a picture for you and if
[1:19:38] you just be patient with me
[1:19:40] i've gone a little bit slow today but
[1:19:42] it's for a reason
[1:19:44] i want to paint a little bit of a
[1:19:45] picture
[1:19:49] brother branham tells us that under the
[1:19:51] sixth trumpet
[1:19:52] he says the sixth trumpet is world war
[1:19:54] ii i mean
[1:19:56] ever heard him say that sixth trumpet is
[1:19:58] world war ii
[1:19:59] and under the sixth trumpet two hundred
[1:20:01] thousand thousand demons were released
[1:20:04] i don't have the quotes in front of me
[1:20:06] you just have to trust me on this and he
[1:20:07] says it in the
[1:20:08] feast of trumpets he said where were
[1:20:10] they released to to that hitler and
[1:20:12] eichmann group
[1:20:15] and so you see hitler's army now what is
[1:20:18] it
[1:20:18] it's anointed by two hundred thousand
[1:20:21] thousand demons
[1:20:24] if you watch if you watch uh the german
[1:20:28] nazi army in world war ii
[1:20:30] their technological advancement was
[1:20:31] staggering
[1:20:34] their abilities were supernatural
[1:20:37] the the the rate at which they developed
[1:20:40] weaponry was supernatural
[1:20:41] the rate in which they conquered was
[1:20:43] supernatural i mean it is staggering
[1:20:46] what happened in just a few years time
[1:20:48] what was it
[1:20:49] the seventh the sixth trumpet blew and
[1:20:51] two hundred thousand thousand demons
[1:20:53] came and where did they come to
[1:20:55] the hitler eichmann group they came into
[1:20:57] germany
[1:20:58] and what was their whole purpose what
[1:21:00] was the whole purpose of two hundred
[1:21:01] thousand thousand demons coming
[1:21:03] their whole purpose was to stop the seed
[1:21:07] to kill the jews it made
[1:21:10] no sense absolutely made no sense for
[1:21:14] the german army to spend so much time
[1:21:16] and resources
[1:21:17] on the holocaust it was ludicrous
[1:21:20] it caused them to lose the war they said
[1:21:23] they give so much time and energy to
[1:21:26] maintaining to building
[1:21:28] and maintaining concentration camps and
[1:21:30] sending food and soldiers and
[1:21:32] trains and transport it was an utter
[1:21:34] waste of time
[1:21:37] now you can see the spirit behind it
[1:21:40] what was the spirit behind it brother
[1:21:42] branham said it's the same
[1:21:43] roman spirit that trampled out jerusalem
[1:21:47] the same
[1:21:47] roman spirit had moved into nazi germany
[1:21:50] and in nazi germany 200
[1:21:52] 000 000 demons were released and
[1:21:54] anointed
[1:21:55] anointed the nation to bring about a
[1:21:58] persecution against the jews
[1:22:00] to totally and utterly destroy
[1:22:03] the jews
[1:22:07] then brother menom starts telling us
[1:22:09] what happened after the war
[1:22:12] now remember the church in israel on
[1:22:15] parallel tracks
[1:22:16] do we believe that now brother branham
[1:22:20] said those two hundred thousand thousand
[1:22:21] demons after the war
[1:22:23] they didn't go back into the pit where
[1:22:24] they came out of
[1:22:26] so where did they go they went into the
[1:22:28] ecclesiastical ranks
[1:22:31] and what are they anointing the
[1:22:33] ecclesiastical ranks for
[1:22:35] the same exact purpose
[1:22:38] to stop to trample out holy jerusalem
[1:22:42] to stop the bride of jesus christ
[1:22:45] there's two hundred thousand thousand
[1:22:46] demons brother bam said come against the
[1:22:48] denomination
[1:22:48] no to come against the bride
[1:22:52] and so now israel has to be totally
[1:22:54] vigilant
[1:22:55] totally on their guard because of
[1:22:57] enemies demon spirits all around them
[1:22:59] trying to penetrate take
[1:23:00] back their land move them off of their
[1:23:02] land take back what's been given to them
[1:23:04] and they're constantly on alert they're
[1:23:06] constantly digging in the soil
[1:23:07] developing their resources amen
[1:23:09] developing their defenses so they can
[1:23:11] keep these demons at bay
[1:23:13] why because they know the same demon
[1:23:15] powers that tried to annihilate them are
[1:23:17] still there still talking about driving
[1:23:21] them into the sea
[1:23:21] still talking about wiping them out but
[1:23:23] where did those demons go after the war
[1:23:25] they went to the ecclesiastical realms
[1:23:27] to what to bring about an attack
[1:23:30] on the bride
[1:23:33] so we need to be on constant vigilance
[1:23:36] because we're surrounded by demon powers
[1:23:39] subtle demon powers not coming at you
[1:23:41] with a bazooka or a grenade
[1:23:43] not running at you with a knife amen but
[1:23:45] a demon power
[1:23:46] that will anoint amen somebody to come
[1:23:48] and just whisper something in your ear
[1:23:51] or somebody or something to come up on
[1:23:53] your cell phone or or something to come
[1:23:55] between you and your wife
[1:23:56] one of the demons trying to destroy the
[1:23:58] bride
[1:23:59] demons that their only purpose is to
[1:24:01] trample
[1:24:02] out holy jerusalem
[1:24:06] and we've got to be constantly on our
[1:24:08] guard
[1:24:09] constantly developing our weaponry
[1:24:12] sharpening the sword
[1:24:14] and sharpening the sword and char
[1:24:16] there's no rust gathering on any guns in
[1:24:18] israel
[1:24:21] none of their tanks are tarnished but
[1:24:23] everything's in a state of ready
[1:24:25] everything they practice they drill amen
[1:24:28] they they make sure everything's ready
[1:24:30] everything's as it should be we could be
[1:24:32] attacked at any time
[1:24:33] from any direction and brothers and
[1:24:35] sisters we could be attacked at any time
[1:24:37] from any direction but that's why we got
[1:24:39] to keep sharpening the sword amen
[1:24:41] keep it oiled up with the spirit amen
[1:24:44] keep ourselves in a state of readiness
[1:24:46] dig in the land become self-sufficient
[1:24:48] amen become
[1:24:49] fed from the land watered from the land
[1:24:52] clothed from the land and protected by
[1:24:54] the land
[1:24:57] why because i will restore
[1:25:01] all that has been eaten down
[1:25:04] in israel in the church or on parallel
[1:25:10] tracks
[1:25:12] she's an independent woman
[1:25:15] independent from all the rest she's not
[1:25:18] looking to anybody for support
[1:25:20] she doesn't need a headquarters she
[1:25:23] doesn't need financial support
[1:25:25] she doesn't need to tell somebody to
[1:25:26] tell her what to believe or what
[1:25:28] she's been restored back into the land
[1:25:30] and everything she needs
[1:25:32] is coming from the land god bless you
[1:25:35] saints let's stand
[1:25:37] musicians if you could come
[1:25:46] oh so much i'd like to share with you
[1:25:50] so much more but there's just not time i
[1:25:54] know today was a lot of teaching a lot
[1:25:55] of charts and i didn't want to
[1:25:57] go too far with too much but i want you
[1:25:59] to see it's that fourth stage that
[1:26:01] brings death
[1:26:03] catholic church already went the
[1:26:04] protestant church is there now
[1:26:06] and they're going to tie it right back
[1:26:08] to thyatira the unification of the
[1:26:10] church and state
[1:26:11] that's why brother branham brings up
[1:26:13] thyatira and the fourth seal
[1:26:15] because the fourth seal is the fourth
[1:26:16] horse rider the fourth seal is the end
[1:26:19] of the gentile church the four seals
[1:26:21] when we go in a rapture
[1:26:23] and a fourth seal is when the power
[1:26:26] comes back
[1:26:27] to the beast and there's a unification
[1:26:29] of church and state
[1:26:30] it all comes back in the fourth seal and
[1:26:33] that's why brother branham points us to
[1:26:35] thyatira
[1:26:36] in the fourth shield and shows us
[1:26:38] jezebel
[1:26:39] and her children
[1:26:42] hallelujah how many appreciate these
[1:26:45] seals
[1:26:47] brother braham said we could preach
[1:26:48] every night on these seals and when he
[1:26:50] first said that i said how
[1:26:52] how but i'm starting to see
[1:26:56] that once you catch the pattern it runs
[1:26:58] through the whole scripture
[1:26:59] it runs from genesis to revelation
[1:27:01] because it's the same story over
[1:27:04] and over and over again and god has
[1:27:07] revealed it
[1:27:08] to you god
[1:27:11] has given it to you and the former rain
[1:27:14] and the latter rain are falling together
[1:27:17] and we're restored back to our land and
[1:27:19] this land
[1:27:20] only responds to the seed
[1:27:25] friends for almost 2000 years
[1:27:29] nobody could get the land of palestine
