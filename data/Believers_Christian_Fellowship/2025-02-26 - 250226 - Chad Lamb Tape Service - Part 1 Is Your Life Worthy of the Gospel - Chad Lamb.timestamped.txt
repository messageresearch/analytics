[11:28] we've come to listen listen to this tape
[11:30] to listen to what your Prophet has
[11:32] brought us Lord that I pray God that you
[11:34] would just anoint us with ears to hear
[11:37] that we'd receive all that you have for
[11:38] this in this hour may it be a blessed
[11:40] time that we get to share together Lord

[11:55] your seats for just a minute thank you
[11:57] musicians amen we going to go into our
[12:01] tape service um brother Frank if you can
[12:03] bring it up oh thank you also I want to
[12:06] make note that tomorrow brother Ron
[12:09] Garvin and brother John Brooks leave for
[12:11] their trip to the Philippines and Japan
[12:13] so we want to remember to pray for them
[12:14] and at the end of the service I'd like
[12:16] them to come up and we can all pray
[12:18] together for them as we send them off
[12:20] into the mission field amen so I'm
[12:23] excited to see what God will do for them
[12:25] they got quite an itinerary they're
[12:26] going to be gone I believe 18 days and
[12:28] so really be praying for them and for
[12:30] their families as well as they're
[12:33] absent um as you know I I like every
[12:36] year to take a book and go through a
[12:38] book together I always look forward to
[12:40] it I hope you do as well I enjoy it
[12:42] anyways amen uh this book this year is
[12:45] is your life worthy of the Gospel if you
[12:47] didn't get a copy the copies are out by
[12:49] the welcome desk you can run out and
[12:51] grab one quickly if you need one but
[12:53] we're going to it's going to take us
[12:54] three services to get through this uh
[12:57] this message three Wednesday nights in a
[12:58] row so bring your book each time don't
[13:01] forget just slip it in your Bible and
[13:03] bring it with you as we
[13:05] go uh most all of you are familiar but I
[13:08] I go through it every time for those who
[13:10] are new and also for the young ones who
[13:12] start to get interested in having the
[13:15] message for themselves and reading it
[13:16] for themselves as they grow older but on
[13:19] this uh back wall uh in the forer as you
[13:22] go out the doors just to the right
[13:24] there's this book rack we have here in
[13:26] the the on The Book Rack the top uh six
[13:31] titles never change and if you remember
[13:34] those are six titles that I asked
[13:35] everybody in the congregation to read in
[13:38] order and the order they're placed there
[13:39] from left to right because it's so
[13:41] fundamental to understanding what God
[13:44] did in our day and the transition of
[13:45] brother brenham's Ministry so if you
[13:47] haven't read them through in that order
[13:48] in a while if it's been 5 six seven
[13:50] years you might want to take note and go
[13:52] back through it and and those of you
[13:54] young who are coming up and you've just
[13:56] started to read the message for yourself
[13:58] I would encourage you to go there as
[13:59] well or anybody who hasn't then the this
[14:03] row on the bottom those we change out
[14:05] from time to time periodically but I've
[14:07] just got six new titles so every year uh
[14:11] brother uh John pittsburger helps me
[14:13] order six new titles and we put them on
[14:15] the bottom rack so that there's six
[14:17] fresh new books there now the way we'd
[14:20] like to do this is we want everybody who
[14:23] wants to to take a book and read it
[14:25] through but I just ask you don't go
[14:27] through and pull all six books just take
[14:29] one or two and read the entire book and
[14:31] then go back and get another one and
[14:33] that way every book you have in your
[14:35] personal library is a book you read
[14:38] yourself and it's exciting now that
[14:41] everybody has an opportunity to build
[14:43] their own book Library so we got six new
[14:45] titles for this year uh but I checked
[14:48] and if I if my number is right in the
[14:50] library we now have 59 titles we keep on
[14:53] hand so if you've been following along
[14:55] over the last however many years has
[14:57] been about six years we've been doing
[14:58] this and you've gotten books each year
[15:00] and you've read them all then your
[15:02] personal book library now is up to 60
[15:04] books that you've read yourself so you
[15:06] can see little by little the young
[15:08] people the teenagers can start to to
[15:10] build this on their own and I certainly
[15:11] don't think you should only have ever
[15:13] done 60 books but it's just nice to have
[15:16] the for me there's something about
[15:18] having the books that I really enjoy and
[15:20] a lot of people enjoy the digital format
[15:22] and that's fine as well but I like
[15:24] having books on hand and it's still nice
[15:27] uh just as a note while we're on the
[15:28] subject
[15:29] if you ever want to pass out material if
[15:31] you want to give a church age book to
[15:32] somebody you want to give a message book
[15:34] to somebody they're all in the library
[15:36] all you got to do is take one and give
[15:37] it away you don't need permission you
[15:39] don't need to pay for it nothing there
[15:41] is for sale all of it's paid for out of
[15:44] the general fund and the offerings the
[15:45] offerings people give by all the books
[15:47] so you're welcome to take literature
[15:49] material you want to pass out and pass
[15:51] it out if you want something for
[15:52] yourself just take it it's there it
[15:54] doesn't do any good sitting on that
[15:56] shelf it only does good when it's read
[15:57] and absorbed by somebody
[15:59] so it's there for us to use these are
[16:02] the six new titles for this year is your
[16:04] life worthy the gospel which is the book
[16:06] we're going to go over together the
[16:08] statue of a perfect man Blasphemous
[16:10] names God is identified by his
[16:13] characteristics marriage and divorce and
[16:15] souls that are in prison now so those
[16:17] are the six books if you go into the
[16:19] library you'll see The Book Rack here
[16:21] right in the front as you enter in the
[16:23] books are all there but then we outgrew
[16:25] that space uh so sister Elsie has taken
[16:28] this uh shelf now behind the door so if
[16:30] you don't see the book you want turn
[16:31] around and look behind you it might be
[16:33] there it's much Fuller than it that was
[16:35] when I took that picture so those are
[16:37] the titles and those are where you go to
[16:39] get them so now the book that we're
[16:42] going over is is your life worthy of the
[16:45] Gospel uh before we get to the questions
[16:49] and if you're not familiar with with uh
[16:51] our tradition and the way they do it
[16:53] we're going to break the book down into
[16:55] small sections uh and those sections are
[16:58] approximately 4 5 minutes or so and
[17:00] before we listen to each section I'm
[17:02] going to ask a few questions and you can
[17:04] jot them down on paper you can have
[17:06] those questions and while we listen
[17:08] brother Venom's going to answer those
[17:10] questions uh in that section we listen
[17:12] to and that gives us all tuned in and
[17:15] listening for those answers and it's fun
[17:17] to see what he what he has to say and so
[17:20] what I always like to do and I say this
[17:22] every time but I'm never going to quit
[17:23] going through it cuz I like it I always
[17:25] start by picking up the book or opening
[17:28] the digital form out whatever it is and
[17:30] I look at the title is your life worthy
[17:32] of the gospel because I know that's what
[17:35] brother brandham is going to be
[17:36] preaching about and I like to hold that
[17:38] in my mind the whole time because
[17:40] remember sometimes brother Benham goes
[17:42] into Parables he tells stories he he
[17:44] goes on what looks like rabbit Trails
[17:46] amen he goes and what he's doing is he's
[17:49] everything he's preaching and everything
[17:51] he's talking about relates to is your
[17:53] life worthy of the Gospel so don't miss
[17:55] the stories either they're not just
[17:57] stories there's a reason that he telling
[17:59] it there's a reason that he wants us uh
[18:01] uh to include that in the message then I
[18:03] always look at the title in the book
[18:04] it's up in the upper leftand quarter
[18:07] 1963 June 30th in the evening it's an
[18:10] evening message 06 it's 63-0 630e that
[18:14] means 1963 June 30th in the evening the
[18:19] morning message was Third Exodus this
[18:21] morning that he preached this this he
[18:22] comes and he preaches in the evening I
[18:25] always do that because I like to know
[18:26] where in the sequence of events in the
[18:29] message brother Brandon preached this
[18:30] was this before the seals or after the
[18:32] seals what major events in his life were
[18:34] before or after this where was he in his
[18:37] ministry because to me that's relevant
[18:39] it's important to know where it is where
[18:41] he is in his ministry when he preaches
[18:43] this message the other thing I do is I
[18:45] open up the book to the front cover and
[18:49] I flip the page once to the inside title
[18:52] page and it and once again down on the
[18:55] bottom left there's some small writing
[18:56] it tells you the date the title but it
[18:58] said this message by Brother William
[19:00] Mariam brandham was delivered on Sunday
[19:02] evening June 30th 1963 at brandham
[19:05] Tabernacle in Jeffersonville Indiana USA
[19:08] I always want to know too where brother
[19:10] Brandon preached it because many times
[19:13] what he says is in relation to the
[19:15] people he's talking to he's trying to
[19:17] get the crowd he's talking to to
[19:19] understand what he's saying amen so
[19:21] sometimes when he's out in Evangelistic
[19:22] field he'll address things a different
[19:24] way than he does at home so I always
[19:27] like to know where he's at and then it
[19:29] tells us the tape number and it says
[19:31] this is 2 hours and 36 minutes so you
[19:34] get a lot of information there so we are
[19:37] going to to start this we're not going
[19:40] to start on page one because brother bam
[19:43] starts off with some greetings he has a
[19:45] baby dedication and some things like
[19:47] that so we're going to skip ahead so
[19:48] that we can fit it into three services
[19:50] not four but there's something I'd like
[19:53] to read on page one if you'll just open
[19:55] it up to page one with me
[19:59] and let's look at paragraph four brother
[20:02] brenham's in his opening prayer and he's
[20:05] imploring the Lord he said heal the
[20:06] sickness in the midst of us take away
[20:09] all sin and unbelief G give us of thy a
[20:13] portion of thy blessing again tonight
[20:15] Lord as we meditate upon the word and
[20:17] the time that we're living we have
[20:20] assembled together father for no other
[20:22] purpose but to try to learn how to live
[20:24] better and to live closer to you I love
[20:27] that what is the purpose of their
[20:29] assembling together this is the purpose
[20:32] this should be our purpose tonight why
[20:34] did we assemble together tonight we have
[20:36] assembled together father for no other
[20:38] purpose but to try to learn how to live
[20:40] better and to live closer to you for we
[20:44] see the day approaching and we must
[20:45] assemble ourselves together off and take
[20:48] instruction from you grant it father in
[20:50] Jesus name amen I just thought that was
[20:54] special and I wanted to read that and
[20:55] include that all right I'm going to go
[20:57] over the the questions for tonight we're
[21:00] actually going to begin on page8 so if
[21:03] you want to turn to page eight and then
[21:05] I'll go to our questions we're going to
[21:07] begin on page8 at the beginning of
[21:09] paragraph 29 and we will go all the way
[21:13] to page 21 at the bottom of paragraph
[21:17] 107 that's the portion we'll have
[21:19] tonight and I believe it's just a little
[21:21] over 40 minutes so we'll do that this
[21:24] evening now if you want to get a note in
[21:26] the paper I'm going to give you a couple
[21:28] questions we're just going to do three
[21:29] tonight because of the preliminaries I'm
[21:31] not going to uh have many more than that
[21:34] but question number one is why is this
[21:37] nation
[21:38] doomed and if you always notice
[21:41] sometimes the way I ask a question it's
[21:42] worded funny or it seems like an odd
[21:44] question it's because of the way brother
[21:46] brandham says something or addresses it
[21:48] and once you hit it you'll know exactly
[21:50] why the question is worded the way it is
[21:52] why is this nation
[21:56] doomed question number two what
[22:00] separates you from
[22:02] God and like we said before if you just
[22:05] answer that question you can give me a
[22:07] myriad of question answers and they'll
[22:09] all be right but what we're looking for
[22:11] is what brother bam says in this portion
[22:13] that we're listening to that he says
[22:14] separates you from
[22:17] God and then the third question is what
[22:21] kind of a life is not worthy what kind
[22:24] of a life is not worthy
[22:37] so those are your questions I'm also
[22:38] going to encourage you just because
[22:40] we're listening to a tape doesn't mean
[22:42] this isn't word the word and doesn't
[22:44] mean it's not worthy of a hearty amen
[22:45] when it strikes your heart so don't be
[22:48] afraid to respond to the word like you
[22:49] would any time when it strikes you amen
[22:52] and that amen's inside let it come out
[22:53] of your mouth amen cuz the atmosphere
[22:56] that we create is what makes us such a
[22:58] special time we can all go home and
[23:00] listen to a tape and we can all break it
[23:02] into segments we can do that but there's
[23:04] something about the atmosphere we create
[23:06] together it really does something for us
[23:08] and I find it extremely encouraging to
[23:10] hear somebody's Amen to the word that's
[23:13] blessing me as well amen so we create an
[23:15] atmosphere together and so don't be
[23:17] afraid to respond to the word I also
[23:20] like to read uh the scripture brother
[23:22] B's going to go to an opening scripture
[23:24] but if you all would just turn in your
[23:25] Bibles with me I'd like for us to read
[23:27] it out of our own Bibles and see where
[23:29] he's going to we'll read it again in the
[23:31] book but let's turn to Luke chap
[23:42] 14 Luke chapter
[23:46] 14 we're going to read verse
[23:52] 16
[23:54] it
[23:56] uh yeah Luke 14:16 then said he unto him
[24:01] a certain man made a great supper and
[24:03] bade many and sent his servant at supper
[24:06] time saying to them that were bidden
[24:08] come for all things are now ready and
[24:11] they all with one consent began to make
[24:13] excuse the first said unto him I have
[24:15] bought a piece of ground and I must
[24:17] needs go and see it I pray thee have me
[24:19] excused and another said I have bought
[24:21] five yolk of oxen and I go to prove them
[24:24] I pray thee have me excused and another
[24:26] said I have married a wife and there
[24:28] therefore I cannot come so that servant
[24:30] came and showed his Lord those things
[24:33] then the master of the house being angry
[24:34] said to his servant go out quickly unto
[24:37] the streets and Lanes of the city and
[24:39] bring in hither the poor and the maimed
[24:41] and the Halt and the Blind and the
[24:43] servant said Lord it is done as thou
[24:45] Hast commanded and yet there is room and
[24:47] the Lord said unto the servant go out
[24:49] into the highways and hedges and compel
[24:51] them to come in that my house may be
[24:54] filled for I say unto you that none of
[24:56] these men which are bidden shall taste
[24:59] of my supper so I another thing that
[25:03] always strikes me and something that
[25:04] always pay attention to is when just as
[25:07] much as I look at the title to brother
[25:09] Brandon's message I always pay
[25:11] particularly close attention to his
[25:12] opening scripture because his opening
[25:14] scripture and his title go together and
[25:17] sometimes you can't see how they go
[25:19] together but they go together and that's
[25:21] what will become more alive to us as we
[25:23] get into this message amen so if we can
[25:27] let's go to page 8
[25:29] page 8 paragraph 29 we can go ahead and
[25:32] begin if you want to turn that on
[25:34] brother
[25:37] Franco now tonight I wanted to make
[25:41] another tape uh that was called is your
[25:45] life worthy of the Gospel probably
[25:47] wouldn't take very long on just some
[25:49] scriptures and notes I got here but
[25:51] first we want to read God's word before
[25:54] we do that we just bow our hearts to him
[25:56] just a moment Lord Jesus
[25:58] any man physically or woman or child can
[26:02] move back the P pages of this Bible but
[26:05] there's no one that can reveal it but
[26:09] you I pray Lord of taking this text as
[26:13] is placed upon my heart to send out
[26:15] across the Nations for the people that
[26:18] they might know what type of life is
[26:21] required of them to live for so many has
[26:24] asked me is a Christian Life a life of
[26:28] church service is it helping uh the poor
[26:32] or the needy or is it a constant member
[26:36] is it a loyal loyalty to the church in
[26:40] such
[26:41] questions father may it the correct
[26:45] answer come tonight through these words
[26:47] as we make an Endeavor to to bring them
[26:50] to the people in the name of Jesus
[26:53] Christ we ask that
[26:56] amen now turning your Bibles to the book
[27:01] of St Luke and we'll start at the 14th
[27:05] chapter and the 16th verse to read some
[27:09] scripture for a basis for a background
[27:12] for this that we're going to TI a lot
[27:15] about 30 to 40 minutes
[27:19] on
[27:20] now the 16th verse of the 14th chapter
[27:24] of St
[27:25] Luke then said he unto him a certain man
[27:31] made a great supper and bed many and
[27:35] sent his servants at supper time to say
[27:37] to them that were bidden come
[27:41] for for all things are now
[27:45] ready and they all with one Accord begin
[27:48] to make
[27:50] excuses the first said unto him I bought
[27:53] a piece of ground and I must need go and
[27:57] see it I pray thee have me
[28:00] excused and another said I have bought
[28:03] five y yolk of
[28:06] ox and I go to prove them I pray they
[28:10] have me
[28:11] excused another said I've married a wife
[28:15] therefore I cannot come so the servant
[28:20] came and showed his Lord all these
[28:24] things then the master of the house
[28:26] being angry said to to his servant
[28:29] notice it's not servant
[28:31] servant go out quickly into the streets
[28:33] and the lanes and the cities and bring
[28:37] in hither the poor and the main and the
[28:40] Halt and the
[28:43] Blind and the servant said Lord it is
[28:46] done as thou has commanded and yet there
[28:50] is
[28:52] room the Lord said unto the servant go
[28:55] out into the highways and hedges and
[28:57] compare tell them to come in that my
[29:00] house may be filled for I say unto you
[29:04] that none of those men which were bidden
[29:07] shall taste of my
[29:10] supper now did you notice there was
[29:13] three pools or three turns of
[29:15] it when they went out first and called
[29:20] to them that
[29:21] were uh or bidden to
[29:24] come and they didn't do it so they went
[29:27] out of healing t
[29:28] campaign went out to get to Blind and
[29:31] Hal and still they were room so he went
[29:34] out and
[29:35] compell the good bad and indifferent
[29:39] they should come in now you read another
[29:42] parable of this something on in Matthew
[29:45] 22 1 to10 if you'd like to read it later
[29:48] on but I I drew this subject from there
[29:53] uh is your life worthy of the
[29:56] Gospel now now Jesus here is saying man
[30:01] has always tried to make
[30:05] excuses not to receive God's word of his
[30:10] invitation though it be firmly proven to
[30:14] him that it's that it's his supper and
[30:17] his invitation but man is constantly
[30:20] making
[30:22] excuses and if you read St Matthew uh 22
[30:26] you'll find that the excuses were made
[30:29] there
[30:31] also and and they tried it went back
[30:35] into all ages went back into the age and
[30:39] said a man a bid them and had a Vineyard
[30:43] and we find that Parable and how he sent
[30:46] his servants to collect from this
[30:47] Vineyard first servant come what did
[30:50] they do they run him off the next
[30:53] servant come they also Stone him and
[30:58] there run servant after servant off the
[31:01] cruel man the king sent finally his
[31:05] son and when his son came we find out
[31:09] that they said this is an air we'll kill
[31:12] him then we'll have all things then
[31:15] Jesus said to them the king sent forth
[31:19] and slew those murderers and burnt their
[31:23] cities now we see when God gives a man
[31:27] an
[31:29] invitation and to do something or to
[31:34] receive the
[31:35] invitation that he's given him and he
[31:38] returns it down then there's nothing
[31:42] left after Mercy is spurn but judgment
[31:46] if you step over the boundaries of Mercy
[31:48] then there's only one thing left and
[31:50] that is
[31:52] judgment and we find that man has done
[31:55] that in all ages it's happened most
[31:59] every age in the
[32:01] Bible when God sent Noah his servant and
[32:05] made an way of an escape for all the
[32:08] people who wanted to to be saved but the
[32:14] people only laughed and scorned at
[32:18] Noah but God made the way but they had
[32:22] an
[32:23] excuse it wasn't according to their to
[32:27] their
[32:28] modern thinking it didn't it wasn't the
[32:31] way they wanted it so they made excuses
[32:34] in the days of Noah they made excuses in
[32:37] the days of Moses they made excuses in
[32:39] the Days of Elijah they made excuses in
[32:41] the days of Christ and they make excuses
[32:46] today now him speaking directly to
[32:50] Israel the ones that was called To The
[32:53] Feast that I would also apply today to
[32:57] the man the church who has been bidden
[33:02] to come to the feast and won't do it
[33:05] this spiritual Feast of the Lord and
[33:08] they won't do it they don't want to do
[33:10] it they've got other things to do they
[33:12] find
[33:13] excuses now if Israel 2,000 years ago
[33:17] would accepted the invitation that they
[33:21] were given they wouldn't be as they are
[33:24] today 2,000 years ago Israel turned down
[33:28] the invitation to come to the wedding
[33:31] supper and they turned it down and went
[33:35] into judgment but as Jesus said they
[33:39] stoned and killed the prophets that was
[33:42] sent to
[33:43] them um by making excuses now the
[33:48] excuses they made in each day we find in
[33:52] the days of Jesus that he didn't he
[33:55] didn't affiliate with any of them they
[33:58] said when did this man get this learning
[34:01] what school is he from is not this the
[34:04] carpenter son is his mother called Mary
[34:07] is his brothers Jo and James so forth
[34:10] and isn't his sisters with us then where
[34:13] did this man get this authority to do
[34:16] this in other words he didn't affiliate
[34:18] with him so they said he's beab he's a
[34:21] Samaritan he's got a devil and he's mad
[34:24] he's a he's a he's a man that's got a
[34:27] evil spirit on the line of religion and
[34:30] has drove him crazy and that's what he's
[34:33] out there like a wild man don't pay any
[34:36] attention to him and we know what
[34:38] happened to Israel and they screamed out
[34:42] they were so sure that that man was
[34:45] wrong until on when they condemned him
[34:48] he said he said let his blood be upon us
[34:51] and upon our children and it's been
[34:53] there ever
[34:54] since Jesus was trying to tell them that
[34:56] they excuse
[34:58] is what kill the prophets and what kill
[35:01] the righteous that
[35:03] come they accepted their Creeds that man
[35:07] had given them instead of taking the
[35:10] word of God and by doing so had made the
[35:12] word of God of no effect now you've
[35:15] either got to say in this that this is
[35:18] God's Will and God's desire are either
[35:21] something else that you can crop up
[35:23] that's better than what this is and you
[35:26] have to take one or the other you can't
[35:28] serve God in man and you've got to say
[35:31] this is the truth or that's part of the
[35:35] truth or it isn't all the truth or it
[35:37] isn't put together right or it isn't
[35:39] interpreted right and the Bible said
[35:42] that the word of God is no private
[35:45] interpretation no one else is supposed
[35:47] to put an interpretation to it it's
[35:48] written just the way God wants it
[35:51] interpreted just what it says that
[35:53] that's what it's supposed to be just
[35:55] take it the way it's said way it's wrow
[35:57] down
[35:58] here now they accept their Creeds they
[36:01] make God's promises of no effect to them
[36:05] they bypass that just skip away from it
[36:08] now if Russia had accepted the
[36:12] Pentecostal blessing 75 years ago when
[36:15] the Holy Ghost fell in
[36:17] Russia they wouldn't have been
[36:19] Communists
[36:20] today now 75 years ago they had a great
[36:24] Revival in Russia God among them and
[36:28] they had great Revival way into Siberia
[36:32] and what did they do they rejected it
[36:35] and today the country is gone and the
[36:39] churches can't have church uh only under
[36:43] permission and they are doomed into
[36:46] judgment as gone off on this wild
[36:49] tantrum of Communism sold out to the
[36:53] devil 50 years ago the Holy Ghost in
[36:59] England just after that come George Jeff
[37:04] and FF
[37:06] Bosworth and Charles price Smith
[37:10] Wigglesworth those great warriors of the
[37:13] faith 50 years ago and offered
[37:17] England the Holy Ghost Revival but what
[37:21] did they do they laughed at him put him
[37:24] in jail called him crazy thought they
[37:28] lost your minds the churches refused the
[37:31] people to come hear them and they heal
[37:33] the sick and cast out devils and done
[37:35] great works and because that England as
[37:39] a nation rejected the gospel her her
[37:44] sins is know throughout all the
[37:47] world there's hardly a a more of an
[37:51] apostate a nation in all the world even
[37:54] including Rome and France that England
[37:57] she's a mother of
[38:00] apostasy right where uh finny and many
[38:05] of the great man preached in the hay
[38:08] market and Charles G finny and Wesley
[38:13] and on down and she turned it down and
[38:17] down even last week or two in the papers
[38:21] you find out where their great man has
[38:24] so weakened to the to the of women until
[38:29] spies come in and their head man found
[38:32] some more of them the magazines is
[38:35] packed their sin of Scandal right in
[38:38] their government has sold their
[38:40] disgraceful Name Across the
[38:43] world why she rejected the truth she had
[38:49] her
[38:50] excuse and she's
[38:52] finished England is all washed up with
[38:56] God a long time ago
[38:58] ago if America 15 years
[39:02] ago when the Great healing
[39:06] Revival continued on from Pentecost
[39:09] broke out in the nation and there was a
[39:13] revivals on the capital Washington DC
[39:17] the presidents vice presidents great
[39:21] people Governors great things taking
[39:24] place Governors and and man were he
[39:28] that Congressman Upshaw had been a
[39:29] for for 66 years and they could
[39:34] not turn their face and say it wasn't so
[39:37] it was right before but they turned it
[39:40] down and tonight that's the reason this
[39:43] nation stays she's doomed there's no
[39:48] hope for it at all she's crossed the
[39:51] line between judgment and mercy and
[39:54] she's lected in what she has here to
[39:56] control the nation and she's rotten to
[40:00] the core her politics is
[40:04] rotten the morals of this nation is
[40:06] lower than anything I can think of and a
[40:10] religious system is rottener than the
[40:14] morals she becomes and doing this she
[40:18] has now joined herself all these
[40:21] churches and the the nation into the
[40:23] Federation of churches and taking the
[40:25] mark of the beast
[40:28] what a
[40:29] thing
[40:31] why Christ give them the
[40:34] opportunity come to my Feast the Feast
[40:38] of Pentecost which means 50 when the
[40:41] Holy Spirit poured out on Russia they
[40:43] was called To A Feast of Pentecost
[40:46] spiritual feast and they turned it
[40:49] down England a Holy Ghost is poured out
[40:52] upon them and they turned it down
[40:55] America the Holy Ghost H was poured out
[40:58] upon them and they turned it
[41:02] down he bid three times three times he
[41:07] sent out and they did not listen to The
[41:11] Feast then he sent again and he said go
[41:15] and compel those people to
[41:18] come the tables got to be set the
[41:21] table's ready to still room and I
[41:24] believe that maybe maybe within the next
[41:27] year few months or something or a year
[41:28] or whatever it is God's going to send
[41:31] another shaking across the country for
[41:34] the somebody still out there somewhere
[41:37] that's a predestinated seed that the
[41:39] light has to fall on somewhere somewhere
[41:42] in the
[41:44] world the nation itself is gone I was
[41:48] looking in this week's Life Magazine
[41:51] down at the where down at the Little
[41:54] Rock or the other day or a rather Hot
[41:56] Springs and there I seen I believe it
[41:59] was a governor of the state of New York
[42:03] with some kind of a strip tees over in
[42:06] huah dancing with her now and here below
[42:11] that was another renowned man oh what a
[42:15] disgrace look at our nation today look
[42:18] at the condition of our of our nation
[42:22] look where she's went to how low she
[42:25] sunk
[42:27] look at our religious system today how
[42:30] can it be that the churches can ever get
[42:34] into the condition that they are now is
[42:37] because they have rejected and refused
[42:40] the message of God the invitation to
[42:43] come to the feast could you call a life
[42:46] like that worthy of the
[42:49] Gospel could you call a life that could
[42:53] set and permit their their people to do
[42:56] the things to smoke cigarettes the other
[43:00] day down here a certain church a little
[43:02] league team was playing down here at the
[43:05] park and my brother-in-law's little boy
[43:09] is a pitcher uh for one of the teams and
[43:13] so he was out there pitching and there
[43:15] was a church league playing and there
[43:17] was the pastor with these little fellas
[43:20] out there on the ground playing and the
[43:23] pastor smoked cigarette after cigarette
[43:26] of a real
[43:27] neighborly church right here by and
[43:30] could you imagine a man and even people
[43:34] sitting in the audience noticed it but
[43:37] it's getting so that they don't even pay
[43:39] attention to it a certain great church a
[43:42] Baptist Church that I know of lets a
[43:45] church out from Sunday school 15 extra
[43:49] minutes so that the pastor and all of
[43:51] them can stand outside and smoke before
[43:53] they come back in to serve the duty of
[43:56] the law
[43:59] John Smith the founder of that church
[44:02] prayed so hard that God sent the Revival
[44:04] till his eyes swoll shut at night and
[44:06] his wife had to lead him to the table
[44:08] and feed him with a spoon if that man
[44:11] would turn over in his grave if he know
[44:13] that church had got in that
[44:15] condition what is it they were bidden to
[44:18] come and turned it
[44:20] down right that's the only thing and you
[44:23] remember Jesus said in here that those
[44:26] that were bidden and turned it down
[44:28] would not taste his
[44:31] supper when God sends the Holy Ghost and
[44:34] knocks at a man's door and he
[44:37] deliberately turns it down sometime he's
[44:39] going to turn it for his last
[44:42] time and then you won't be a privileged
[44:45] character you can sit in the church and
[44:48] listen to the gospel and agree with the
[44:51] gospel you might do so much to say I
[44:53] know it's right but never put a finger
[44:56] on on it to help it
[44:59] yourself see you just listen to it cuz
[45:02] you say I believe it's right that's just
[45:05] sympathizing with
[45:06] it I can say I believe that's a $10,000
[45:10] that don't mean I got it see I could say
[45:13] it's good cold water but refuse to drink
[45:16] it you know what I mean and this is
[45:20] eternal
[45:21] life and to refuse to do it one day
[45:24] you'll cross the line between judgment
[45:27] and
[45:28] mercy and then you won't be have the
[45:31] privilege to come and receive it to you
[45:34] people who come here I'm not responsible
[45:38] for those who are are other ministers
[45:41] are speaking to but if it's
[45:43] right you owe your life to
[45:47] it what more could you ever find that
[45:51] would be more of a benefit to you than
[45:54] to know that you can have eternal life
[45:57] amen amen what if I was giving away
[46:00] capsules here that scientifically proven
[46:05] scientifically proven that this capsule
[46:08] would make you live a thousand
[46:12] years well I I'd have to get a militia
[46:15] out here and and swarm away from the
[46:19] place you wouldn't have to make an alter
[46:22] call for it you just have to beat them
[46:24] away from it to live a thousand years
[46:28] and yet scientifically
[46:32] proven that the Eternal God all his
[46:37] power of His resurrections which promis
[46:39] you eternal
[46:41] life and Satan will put his Legions out
[46:43] there and keep you away from it that's
[46:46] right yet you can look and sensible
[46:48] enough look in the face of it and see
[46:50] it's right but then turn it down see
[46:53] something some kind of an excuse it's
[46:56] too hard
[46:57] I'm too tired I will tomorrow just some
[47:00] kind of an excuse that's all they do by
[47:05] rejecting the day of visitation it
[47:08] separates you from God now we noticed in
[47:12] in the Old Testament they had what they
[47:15] call the Jubilee year that was when all
[47:18] the people that was slaves could go free
[47:21] when the Jubilee sounded and then if the
[47:24] man did not go out if there was some
[47:27] excuse that he could give that he didn't
[47:29] want to return to his land then he had
[47:32] to be marked in the ear with an a by the
[47:35] post in the temple and then no matter
[47:38] how many jubilees come along that man
[47:41] was sold out he could never no more come
[47:45] back as a citizen in Israel no more what
[47:48] did he do he rejected his invitation he
[47:53] didn't have to pay nothing the debt of
[47:55] his slavery was over
[47:57] his family was free he could go right
[48:01] back to his homeland and get his own
[48:03] possession but if he refused to do it
[48:06] then he wasn't lotted no more with
[48:08] Israel and his possession was given to
[48:10] another now the same thing in the
[48:13] natural applies to the
[48:15] spiritual that if we as inheritance of
[48:19] eternal life and we hear the gospel and
[48:23] know that is true and we reject it and
[48:25] refuse to do it are to listen to it we
[48:28] take on the mark of the
[48:30] beast now somebody said now there's
[48:33] going to be a a mark of the beast is
[48:36] going to come someday let me tell you
[48:38] it's already
[48:40] come as soon as the Holy Ghost Begin to
[48:43] Fall the mark of the beast begin to take
[48:45] place see you only have two things one
[48:49] of them is accept it takes the Seal of
[48:52] God to reject it takes the mark of the
[48:54] beast to reject the Seal of God is to
[48:58] take the mark of the beast everybody
[49:01] understand to reject the Seal of God is
[49:05] to take the mark of the beast for the
[49:06] Bible said all that was not sealed by
[49:09] the Seal of God took the mark of the
[49:12] beast when the trumpet sounded and all
[49:14] wanted to go freak could go them it
[49:16] didn't was
[49:17] marked now you see the mark of the beast
[49:22] if we talk about it in the future is
[49:24] when it's going to be made manifest
[49:27] when you realize that what you've
[49:29] already
[49:30] done see and so is the holy spirit it's
[49:34] to be manifested when we see the Lord
[49:37] Jesus coming in glory and feel that
[49:41] transforming power and see the Dead
[49:44] Rising out of the grave and know that a
[49:47] second longer we'll be changed and have
[49:50] a body like his Lord it'll be made
[49:53] manifest then to see those who rejected
[49:56] it
[49:57] will be left down out didn't Jesus said
[50:01] The Virgins went out to meet Christ some
[50:04] of them fell asleep the first watch
[50:05] second third fourth fifth sixth to the
[50:08] seventh watch but in the seventh watch
[50:11] then came forth the sound behold the
[50:13] bridegroom cometh go out to meet him and
[50:16] the ones that were sleeping
[50:20] awakened all the age back to Pentecost
[50:23] woke up see from the seventh age of
[50:27] seven Church age all the way back
[50:29] through woke up and these that were in
[50:31] this church age of living they were
[50:33] changed and they went in at the very
[50:35] time they went in the sleeping virgin
[50:37] come and said we want to buy some of
[50:39] your or but they said we just got enough
[50:42] for our s go to them and sell it and
[50:44] while they were trying to receive this
[50:47] AA the bridegroom
[50:50] came there has never been a time in the
[50:54] history of the world that theist
[50:57] episcopalians Baptists methodists
[51:01] Presbyterians the papers are full the
[51:03] religious papers are praising God that
[51:06] those sleeping virgins are now trying to
[51:09] receive
[51:11] Pentecost trying to receive the Holy
[51:13] Ghost and don't the people realize that
[51:18] it will not happen according to the word
[51:21] of God while they were trying to come
[51:24] back the bridegroom and took away the
[51:27] bride and they were cast into outer
[51:29] Darkness for judgment
[51:32] Lord because they rejected their
[51:36] invitation all people are bidden to come
[51:40] God in every age has sent out his light
[51:43] and it's been rejected and now today is
[51:46] no different from any other day to
[51:49] reject the day of the
[51:51] visitation when God is making a visit to
[51:54] the church and to the people re receive
[51:56] it then don't put it off the next year
[51:59] the next Revival that's the hour today
[52:02] is the day of
[52:03] salvation and remember God has never
[52:06] sent a message in any day but what he
[52:09] Vindicated it with the
[52:12] supernatural Jesus said himself if I do
[52:15] not the works of my father then believe
[52:17] me not but if I do the works you believe
[52:20] the works if you can't believe
[52:22] me when you see it clearly cut and and
[52:26] made manifest now the time has come that
[52:30] she rejects it then she's bored in the
[52:32] ear with an awe then she'll never hear
[52:34] it now she takes herself to the
[52:36] confederation of churches to go right in
[52:38] to take the mark of the beast one of the
[52:40] great Ambitions somebody give me the
[52:42] paper and just now this new Pulpit said
[52:44] is to unite the churches together yes
[52:48] they'll do it just as certain as I'm
[52:49] standing you're and a Protestant fall
[52:53] part see because the church it the Bible
[52:57] said Paul the prophet of the Lord said
[53:00] that day will not come except there come
[53:03] a falling away
[53:05] first and then the man before the man of
[53:08] sin will be
[53:09] revealed he that Seth in the temple of
[53:11] God opposing himself all that's above
[53:13] God he as God forgiving sins on the
[53:18] earth and so forth
[53:20] how that this thing happened but it
[53:22] couldn't happen until the falling away
[53:25] until the church began to get away from
[53:27] the spiritual Feast draw itself back and
[53:30] organize itself and then the Revelation
[53:33] didn't stay with the church remember
[53:36] Israel walked Day and Night by the
[53:41] pillar of
[53:42] fire when that Pillar of Fire moved they
[53:45] moov with it and remember it was a fire
[53:48] at night and a cloud of day so it might
[53:51] come day or night anytime but wherever
[53:54] it was there was a propitiation made
[53:57] that they would not fail to see it it
[53:59] was a light at night and a cloud in the
[54:01] daytime and they followed it yes sir
[54:04] that's same thing Martin Luther saw it
[54:07] what did he do he come out of
[54:09] Catholicism but what did they do they
[54:11] build a little fence around said we're
[54:12] lutherans this is it then Wesley saw it
[54:15] moving away from there he went what they
[54:17] do build a little fence around and said
[54:19] this is it what did I do moved right on
[54:21] again Pentecost saw it what they do
[54:24] moved out of the wesling in Nazareth and
[54:26] so forth what do they do they build a
[54:28] fence call we're Oneness and we're
[54:30] Trinity and we're the United and all
[54:32] this what did he do God moved right on
[54:34] out of it am see we cannot do that we've
[54:38] got to follow every day every hour of
[54:40] the day every step of the way we've got
[54:43] to be led by the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:46] hallelujah amen if we don't we take an
[54:49] organizational life and a life that
[54:52] doesn't follow Christ daily is not
[54:55] worthy a man that's a Christian on
[54:57] Sunday and goes to church sits back
[55:00] there and thinks he owns the church
[55:01] because he does this that or the other
[55:03] and on Monday will steal and lie and
[55:07] women that'll go out on the public
[55:10] beaches and and out upon the streets
[55:12] with immoral clothes
[55:15] on I thought of our the first lady
[55:19] wouldn't even put on makeup to go before
[55:21] the pope and come back and set a
[55:23] Waterhead haircut uh uh spring for the
[55:27] women in the nation and all these uh
[55:29] dresses that when she's become mother
[55:32] every woman in the country wants to wear
[55:33] one of them uh mother type dresses now
[55:36] that's right it's examples and they know
[55:40] that those people would do that they
[55:42] take on a spirit of the world and that
[55:45] don't belong in the Church of the Living
[55:47] God praise the Lord women ought to look
[55:51] to Jesus Christ you ought to look to
[55:53] Sarah in name of the Old Testament yes
[55:56] now they got so that I was preaching the
[55:58] other night somewhere about a women to
[56:02] obey their husband
[56:05] ohy that went out the marriage a long
[56:07] time ago but uh they ain't going to do
[56:10] that no sir they live in America and
[56:13] they let you know so they not going to
[56:16] obey but as long as you don't do it
[56:18] don't never try to call yourself a
[56:20] Christian cuz you're not I don't care
[56:23] how much you dance and speak with
[56:24] tongues if you don't obey your husband
[56:26] you're out of the will of God and a
[56:29] woman that wears shorts and does these
[56:31] things that she does on the street don't
[56:33] call yourself a Christian you want to
[56:36] have the world and still hold your
[56:38] testimony you cannot do that in the
[56:41] presence of God when you know better
[56:43] than to do
[56:46] it notice bored in the air marked away
[56:50] then you'll never hear remember that's a
[56:52] sign of closing the ears you won't hear
[56:55] it no more you won't listen You'll never
[56:57] be able to get to it again oh she don't
[56:59] believe that oh my don't tell her she
[57:02] believes it no she tell you right she
[57:04] don't know
[57:05] it how could a a lady it's the asking
[57:09] how could a lady as I spoke Sunday last
[57:12] Sunday night a week ago tonight on of
[57:15] red flashing light how that the the the
[57:19] Run of women has become prettier than it
[57:21] ever was now that's nothing nothing
[57:23] against a woman now that's just but how
[57:25] she controls that see that she's got
[57:29] that way to put her in a Temptation like
[57:32] Eve was put before the
[57:34] tree every man every son that comes to
[57:37] God's got to go through that hour of
[57:40] testing this is the age of women this
[57:44] nation is or she has to go through that
[57:46] testing if she can be a pretty woman and
[57:49] act like a
[57:50] sister the Lord's blessings upon her but
[57:54] when she can get her self to to know
[57:57] this and display herself absolutely
[58:01] shows that she's got a a bad Spirit on
[58:04] her she don't mean to be that way I
[58:07] don't think many of them don't but they
[58:09] don't realize that could you tell me
[58:11] that a decent thinking
[58:14] woman could put herself on these little
[58:17] uh clothes that they wear out here on
[58:19] the
[58:21] street I've got two young girls sitting
[58:24] here I don't know what that outcome of
[58:26] them kids will be I just pray for them
[58:29] kids today I don't you can't tell I
[58:32] don't know they're not immune from that
[58:34] they've got to stand on their own two
[58:36] feet before Jesus Christ and give an
[58:38] answer they can't go in on what on on
[58:40] what I believe and what their mother
[58:42] believes I don't know what they do but I
[58:44] actually believe at this
[58:46] hour if them girls went out on the
[58:48] street with them kind of clothes on and
[58:50] a man inell them and I'm kind of clo I
[58:53] don't believe if I had the opportunity I
[58:55] could even condemn the
[58:57] man right I condemn the girls they had
[59:02] no business doing
[59:04] that listen if man thinks that and they
[59:07] teach that man's no more than an animal
[59:10] he come from the animal race and look
[59:12] then and you put him out there like you
[59:14] take the dog to the little female at
[59:16] certain
[59:17] times through the fences and everything
[59:19] else because the little female is in
[59:22] that condition Hogs cows every other
[59:25] animal and if we are animal life which
[59:27] we are the physical part and then when a
[59:31] woman displays herself like that she
[59:33] proves that she's the same thing the
[59:35] little dog is the same thing exactly for
[59:38] she wouldn't be doing that she knows
[59:41] nature teaches her that man's going to
[59:43] look at and the Bible said whosoever
[59:46] lookth upon a woman to lust after her
[59:48] has committed ad doy with her already in
[59:51] his heart that puts a testing time and
[59:53] the devil pretties them women and strips
[59:55] them down and set them out there to give
[59:57] you a test man turn your heads be sons
[1:00:00] of
[1:00:01] God women you dress like Daughters of
[1:00:05] God don't answer for adultery y today if
[1:00:08] that woman don't matter how innocent she
[1:00:10] might have never done nothing wrong
[1:00:13] never even had it in her mind to do
[1:00:14] wrong but when that sinner who looked
[1:00:16] upon that graceful Farm of that woman
[1:00:19] knowing he's a male and female sex and
[1:00:22] and one glands and one in male in the
[1:00:24] other and that's s is going to have to
[1:00:26] answer for it at the day of the Judgment
[1:00:28] who did it who's guilty not him you
[1:00:34] amen there you
[1:00:37] are immoral look at this nation it used
[1:00:41] to be when they had the knee high
[1:00:43] dresses that the women War we had to
[1:00:45] send to Paris to get them today Paris
[1:00:48] sends here to get them it's got so
[1:00:51] filthy the parish can't keep up with it
[1:00:53] that's right the whole why rejecting the
[1:00:58] gospel why parents didn't have it it's
[1:01:02] 100%
[1:01:04] Catholicism the Protestants can't even
[1:01:06] get in there look at V grah I think
[1:01:08] these only 600 Christians in all Paris
[1:01:11] out of the millions 600 Christians
[1:01:14] Protestants that's not Holy Ghost fill
[1:01:16] that's just absolutely Protestants 600
[1:01:19] amount of millions times
[1:01:21] millions they didn't get the opportunity
[1:01:24] to reject it but these people has the
[1:01:27] gospel and when they get away from the
[1:01:30] message and the gospel that they've seen
[1:01:32] demonstrated make fun of it because some
[1:01:34] old prostitute Doctrine has weaved them
[1:01:37] around and some Pastor standing in the
[1:01:39] pull pit thinking more of a dollar and a
[1:01:41] meal ticket than he does with the soul
[1:01:43] of people that he's preaching to my
[1:01:47] God that's what's done it now she leads
[1:01:50] the world you remember not long ago in
[1:01:53] this Tabernacle I preached on a subject
[1:01:55] about years ago I'll show you the
[1:01:57] goddess of America and had the little
[1:01:59] flapper here sitting there with that's
[1:02:01] what it
[1:02:02] is now they're even get it they're
[1:02:05] getting what they've asked for and
[1:02:07] they're going to get it that's all oh
[1:02:10] they won't believe it no are they let
[1:02:12] you know they are American citizens and
[1:02:14] they got a right to to function any way
[1:02:16] they want to I just wish let me tell you
[1:02:21] I'll tell you now no sure politics will
[1:02:24] never work no sure democracy will never
[1:02:27] work amen democracy's rotten to the Bone
[1:02:31] amen if it could be run amongst a bunch
[1:02:34] of Christians it would be fine but when
[1:02:36] you put it out there in the world it
[1:02:38] becomes all sales and no anchor am it's
[1:02:41] exactly right look at here today
[1:02:43] anything can take place and they'll be
[1:02:45] just anything pull a few politics and
[1:02:48] you'll get by with murder when I
[1:02:50] preached down there that night to try to
[1:02:52] save them two kids' life they're as
[1:02:54] guilty as guilty could be even that
[1:02:57] attorney got up behind me there and he
[1:02:59] said it's
[1:03:00] right he said I don't believe in taking
[1:03:03] the people's life he said if you'll
[1:03:04] notice on your criminal records who is
[1:03:06] it it gets killed electric chairs and
[1:03:09] things it's not the
[1:03:10] rich he can afford to get him a lawyer
[1:03:13] and some pull some dirty tricks and some
[1:03:15] wheel share and some over here and bribe
[1:03:17] the thing he said it's poor kids like
[1:03:19] that it ain't got enough money to buy a
[1:03:21] decent meal that's a kind of guess it
[1:03:24] there's a kind of electrocute somebody's
[1:03:26] like they call a bunch of ignorant
[1:03:28] people and they just hold up their name
[1:03:30] of capital punishment I said the first
[1:03:32] murder was ever committed in the world
[1:03:34] one brother killed another God did not
[1:03:36] take his life for it he put a mark on
[1:03:38] him that nobody should take his life
[1:03:41] right that's a supreme judge now I see
[1:03:45] they took the sentence off of them now
[1:03:47] they go to get another trial of course
[1:03:49] they'll get life now which should be 11
[1:03:50] years and maybe stand for parole they're
[1:03:52] guilty certainly they're guilty they
[1:03:54] ought to be set to finish poent for
[1:03:56] Lifetime but not their life take no man
[1:03:58] has a right to take another man's life
[1:04:01] no sir I don't believe in it no indeed
[1:04:04] oh they say well they don't believe that
[1:04:06] they're out of the will of the Lord
[1:04:08] because that's all they know about and
[1:04:09] all they want to hear about they turned
[1:04:12] to ear against the truth and there
[1:04:14] neither did Egypt want to know that that
[1:04:16] bunch of Holy Rollers down there was the
[1:04:18] will of Lord how they want to know that
[1:04:21] some crazy man come in there from the
[1:04:23] Wilderness with Whiskers hanging down
[1:04:24] like this and said they how come in the
[1:04:26] name of the Lord turn them children
[1:04:28] loose Pharaoh would say who
[1:04:32] me to him
[1:04:35] out see me if you don't do it the Lord's
[1:04:39] God's going to Smite this nation the old
[1:04:43] the old crank turn him out somewhere let
[1:04:45] him go the sons kind of baked his mind
[1:04:47] see but it brought
[1:04:50] judgment Hallelujah because a man was a
[1:04:53] prophet and had thus sayth the Lord am
[1:04:56] Hallelujah exactly right they didn't
[1:04:59] want to believe it Rome didn't want to
[1:05:01] believe it
[1:05:02] either but it happened just the same
[1:05:05] Israel didn't want to believe that that
[1:05:07] was a messiah how could they bunch a
[1:05:09] bunch of galileans in aren all all these
[1:05:13] galileans where did they come from what
[1:05:15] kind of a crowd does he go with the very
[1:05:17] poorest that can be got together that's
[1:05:19] the crowd he Associates with that's who
[1:05:22] comes to hearing is the poor people that
[1:05:25] people that don't know nothing they're
[1:05:27] not elected they're not they're not the
[1:05:29] intellectual type that we are they're
[1:05:31] poor Bunch you heard it say about the
[1:05:33] Revival in this day what kind of crowd
[1:05:35] hears them what kind of goes to these
[1:05:38] meetings what kind of people are they I
[1:05:42] heard a fellow say not long ago well he
[1:05:44] was kind of a he was hope stepfather and
[1:05:47] I was telling him about the baptism the
[1:05:49] Holy Spirit he said now who would
[1:05:51] believe a thing like that let some kind
[1:05:53] of a bunch like you got up there he said
[1:05:56] you let so and so a businessman you're
[1:05:57] the town a wicked is all go let him say
[1:06:00] that he received the Holy Ghost then I
[1:06:02] believe
[1:06:03] it I said don't worry he'll never say
[1:06:06] it the man died instantly without God
[1:06:10] see be careful what you're doing be
[1:06:12] careful what you're saying you want a
[1:06:14] life worthy of the Gospel that's right
[1:06:18] Israel didn't believe it that bunch of
[1:06:19] people that mad
[1:06:21] man by the name of Jesus of Nazareth
[1:06:24] born they thought it ill legitimate
[1:06:26] birth and the people believed it because
[1:06:28] they said that wasn't his why his
[1:06:30] father's Joseph and Mary was to have
[1:06:32] this baby before he even
[1:06:34] born why it's illegitimate and what is
[1:06:36] he just a mad man one of them funny sort
[1:06:39] of a GU don't go to hear him what did
[1:06:42] they do they were sending their souls to
[1:06:47] hell they T Jesus said let them alone if
[1:06:50] a blind leads a blind don't they both
[1:06:52] fall in the ditch right they didn't know
[1:06:54] it they wouldn't believe it
[1:06:56] they could not they could not see how
[1:06:59] that a simple people with a simple
[1:07:01] message to be rejected could cause a
[1:07:05] great nation to fall to
[1:07:07] ruins now listen they could not
[1:07:11] understand that a simple ordinary common
[1:07:14] bunch of people you know the Bible said
[1:07:16] that the Common People heard Jesus
[1:07:20] gladly amen aren't you glad you're
[1:07:22] labeled common people
[1:07:26] they heard him
[1:07:27] gladly amen God is good amen brother
[1:07:30] Franco yeah you pull up those questions
[1:07:32] before I get to the first question I
[1:07:34] just want to um pull out a couple things
[1:07:36] that he said if we can turn to paragraph
[1:07:40] 30 which is found on page eight where we
[1:07:51] began and and um page 8 paragraph 30
[1:07:55] says Lord Jesus any man physically or
[1:07:57] woman or child can move back to pages of
[1:07:59] this Bible there's no one that can
[1:08:01] reveal it but you I pray Lord of taking
[1:08:04] this text as it's placed upon my heart
[1:08:06] to send out across the Nations for the
[1:08:08] people that they might know what type of
[1:08:10] life is required of them to live for so
[1:08:13] many has asked me is the Christian Life
[1:08:15] a life of church service is it helping
[1:08:17] the poor the needy or is it a constant
[1:08:19] member is it loyal is it loyal loyalty
[1:08:22] to the church and such questions father
[1:08:24] May the correct answer come tonight
[1:08:26] through these words so brother bam is is
[1:08:29] addressing in his prayer here there's a
[1:08:31] question about what is a Christian Life
[1:08:33] is it faithfulness to a church is it
[1:08:35] doing good deeds and to the poor and
[1:08:37] needy and really what he's going to get
[1:08:39] down to to the very core of it that
[1:08:42] we're going to find as your life worthy
[1:08:43] of the Gospel Living Christian Life is
[1:08:47] believing God when God's presented to
[1:08:50] you there are there are manifestations
[1:08:52] of that there are things that come with
[1:08:54] obedience but when when you get down to
[1:08:56] the core of it it's not faithfulness to
[1:08:58] a church it's not doing good to the
[1:08:59] needy or the poor it's receiving the
[1:09:01] word of God in your day that's really
[1:09:04] what he's going to that's the heart of
[1:09:05] what he's trying to tell us is your life
[1:09:07] worthy of the gospel and I think we'll
[1:09:09] see that as we move on let's go to
[1:09:12] paragraph 39 on page
[1:09:21] 10 uh page 10 paragraph 39 him speaking
[1:09:24] directly to Israel the ones that was
[1:09:26] called To The Feast that I would also
[1:09:28] apply today to men the church who was
[1:09:31] bidden to come to the feast that won't
[1:09:33] do it the spiritual Feast of the Lord
[1:09:36] and they won't do it they don't want to
[1:09:38] do it they've got other things to do
[1:09:40] they find excuses so what have we been
[1:09:42] to we've been to the spiritual Feast of
[1:09:45] the Lord he's calling us to come and
[1:09:47] feast on his word let's go now to page
[1:09:50] 12 paragraph 53
[1:09:58] he says look at our religious system
[1:09:59] today how can it be that the churches
[1:10:02] can ever get into the condition that
[1:10:04] they are now so that's the question how
[1:10:07] is it that the churches can get into the
[1:10:09] condition they are now he says is
[1:10:12] because they rejected and refused the
[1:10:14] message of God the invitation to come to
[1:10:17] the feast so what is the message of God
[1:10:19] it's the invitation to come to the feast
[1:10:22] so how did the churches get into the
[1:10:24] condition they are now is because they
[1:10:26] refused the message of God the
[1:10:28] invitation to the feast they rejected it
[1:10:31] and he says could you call a life like
[1:10:33] that worthy of the Gospel what what kind
[1:10:36] of Life the one who refuses the
[1:10:39] invitation to the feast is not worthy of
[1:10:41] the
[1:10:43] Gospel he's not then he goes on and he
[1:10:46] talks about going to the Ball Game and
[1:10:47] seeing the pastor smoking and and the
[1:10:50] Baptist Church that lets out listen the
[1:10:52] problem wasn't the smoking that was the
[1:10:54] indication that the life had left the
[1:10:56] church and why were they in that
[1:10:58] condition they refused to accept the
[1:11:00] invitation of the Lord the message of
[1:11:02] God and because they refused it
[1:11:04] somewhere the long lay they find it in a
[1:11:06] condition brother bram's not saying
[1:11:08] because you smoke you're not worthy of
[1:11:09] the Gospel he says no you smoke because
[1:11:11] you rejected the gospel and rejecting
[1:11:13] The Gospel made you Unworthy of the
[1:11:15] Gospel this is just the outcropping of
[1:11:17] it this is just the effect that it has
[1:11:20] so but if we go through we're going to
[1:11:22] go through this entire message but I
[1:11:23] want you to keep that in your mind
[1:11:24] brother B is not saying your sinful acts
[1:11:27] make you Unworthy of the Gospel he's
[1:11:29] saying rejecting the message of your
[1:11:31] hour makes you Unworthy of the gospel
[1:11:33] and then you have no place to go but
[1:11:35] into this downward spiral Spiral of
[1:11:38] immorality so it's not doing good versus
[1:11:41] not doing good that's not what he's
[1:11:42] talking about it's accepting the word or
[1:11:44] rejecting the word that's really what
[1:11:46] he's talking about and then he'll go
[1:11:48] into some of the effects of that now our
[1:11:51] first question was why is this nation
[1:11:54] doomed if you'll go back with me to
[1:11:56] paragraph 36 on page n we'll start back
[1:12:00] here and we'll get to the the answer
[1:12:03] we'll work our way up to it bottom of
[1:12:05] page N9 paragraph 36 now we see when God
[1:12:08] gives a man an invitation and to do
[1:12:10] something or to receive the invitation
[1:12:12] that he's given him and he he returns it
[1:12:15] down then there's nothing left after
[1:12:17] Mercy is spurned but judgment if you
[1:12:19] step over the boundaries of Mercy then
[1:12:21] there's only one thing left and that's
[1:12:22] judgment and we find that the man has
[1:12:24] done that in all ages it's happened most
[1:12:27] every age in the Bible so when God gives
[1:12:29] a man an invitation to turn it down
[1:12:31] there's nothing left but judgment let's
[1:12:34] go to paragraph 48 at the bottom of page
[1:12:39] 11 says America 15 years ago when the
[1:12:42] great he healing Revival continued on
[1:12:45] from Pentecost broke out in the nation
[1:12:47] and there was revivals on the capital
[1:12:49] Washington DC the presidents vice
[1:12:51] presidents great people Governors great
[1:12:53] things taking place governor and men
[1:12:55] were healed like Congressman Upshaw had
[1:12:58] been crippled for 66 years and they they
[1:13:00] could not turn their face and say it
[1:13:02] wasn't so it was right before them but
[1:13:04] they turned it down and tonight that's
[1:13:07] the reason this nation stays she is
[1:13:09] doomed there's no hope for it at all she
[1:13:11] crossed the line between judgment and
[1:13:13] mercy and she's elected in what she has
[1:13:16] here to control the nation he's speaking
[1:13:17] of John F Kennedy being the first
[1:13:19] Catholic President and she is rotten to
[1:13:22] the core her politics is rotten the
[1:13:24] morals of this nation is lower than
[1:13:25] anything I can think of her religious
[1:13:27] system is rottener than the morals she
[1:13:30] becomes in doing this she has now joined
[1:13:32] herself all these churches of the nation
[1:13:34] into the Federation of churches and has
[1:13:36] taken the mark of the beast what a thing
[1:13:38] why Christ give them the opportunity
[1:13:41] come to my Feast the Feast of Pentecost
[1:13:43] which means 50 and so why is this nation
[1:13:47] doomed they turn down the invitation to
[1:13:50] the feast that's why this nation is
[1:13:52] doomed we can say because they've
[1:13:54] allowed home homosexuality because
[1:13:56] they've done this no no no that's not
[1:13:58] why they the nation's in this condition
[1:14:01] because it rejected the invitation to
[1:14:03] the feast
[1:14:04] amen then all of this comes later
[1:14:08] right so let's go now to paragraph
[1:14:13] 107 on page
[1:14:17] 21 brother goes on he talks about Egypt
[1:14:20] and he talks about Rome and the times
[1:14:21] that they were destroyed and he says in
[1:14:24] paragraph 1 7 he says they could not see
[1:14:26] how that a simple people with a simple
[1:14:28] message to be rejected could cause a
[1:14:31] great nation to fall into ruins so why
[1:14:34] did the nation fall because they
[1:14:36] rejected the simple message that was
[1:14:39] among simple
[1:14:41] people the next question we had was what
[1:14:43] separates you from god let's go to page
[1:14:48] 57 on the bottom of page 13
[1:14:55] page
[1:14:57] 57 on the bottom of page
[1:15:01] 13 to you people who come here I'm not
[1:15:04] responsible for those or other ministers
[1:15:06] are speaking to but if it's right you
[1:15:08] owe your life to it what more could you
[1:15:11] ever find that would be more of a
[1:15:12] benefit to you to know that you've got
[1:15:14] eternal life whatever I was giving away
[1:15:16] capsules here that scientifically proven
[1:15:19] scientifically proven that this capsule
[1:15:21] would make you live a thousand years
[1:15:23] well I'd have to get a militia out here
[1:15:25] to swarm them away from the place you
[1:15:27] wouldn't have to make an altar call for
[1:15:29] it you just have to beat them away from
[1:15:31] it to live a thousand years and yet
[1:15:33] scientifically proven that the Eternal
[1:15:35] God all his power of His resurrections
[1:15:37] which promis you eternal life and Satan
[1:15:40] will put his Legions out there and keep
[1:15:42] you away from it see yet you can look
[1:15:44] and sensible enough to look in the face
[1:15:46] of it and see it's right but then turn
[1:15:48] it down something kind of an excuse it's
[1:15:51] too hot I'm too tired I will I will
[1:15:53] tomorrow just some kind of excuse that's
[1:15:55] all they do by rejecting the day of
[1:15:57] visitation is separate you from
[1:16:01] God listen I I the reason I want to
[1:16:04] highlight that it's not smoking and
[1:16:08] drinking and running around and gambling
[1:16:11] and what separates you from God is
[1:16:14] rejecting your day of
[1:16:15] visitation is when God presents himself
[1:16:18] to you and you turn around and don't
[1:16:19] want it and reject it that separates you
[1:16:21] from God everything else comes later
[1:16:25] amen amen this is going to be this is
[1:16:27] really important uh let's keep reading
[1:16:31] now we notice in the Old Testament they
[1:16:33] had what they called The Jubilee year I
[1:16:35] thought this was amazing after what
[1:16:36] brother Gabe preached and here we come
[1:16:37] along and catch the Jubilee year I was
[1:16:39] really excited that was when all the
[1:16:41] people that was slaves would go free
[1:16:43] when the Jubilee sounded and then if a
[1:16:45] man did not go out if there was some
[1:16:47] excuse that he could give that he didn't
[1:16:49] want to return to his land then he had
[1:16:51] to be marked in the ear with an owl owl
[1:16:54] no all sorry and by the post in the
[1:16:57] temple and then no matter how many
[1:16:59] jubilees came along that man was sold
[1:17:01] out he could never no more come back as
[1:17:03] a citizen in Israel no more what did he
[1:17:05] do he rejected his invitation he didn't
[1:17:08] have to pay nothing the debt of his
[1:17:10] slavery was over his family was free he
[1:17:13] could go right back to his homeland and
[1:17:15] get his possession but if he refused to
[1:17:17] do it then he wasn't LED no more with
[1:17:19] Israel and his possession was given to
[1:17:21] another why because he refused the
[1:17:25] itation to go
[1:17:26] free that's what this whole thing is
[1:17:29] about 61 now the same thing in the
[1:17:32] natural applies to the spiritual that if
[1:17:34] we as inheritance of eternal life and we
[1:17:36] hear the gospel and know that it's true
[1:17:38] and we reject it and refuse to do it or
[1:17:40] to listen to it we take on the mark of
[1:17:42] the beast let's go to the next page and
[1:17:45] go to paragraph
[1:17:46] 66 but they said we just got enough for
[1:17:48] ourselves go to them that sell it and
[1:17:50] while they were trying to receive this
[1:17:52] oil the bridegroom came there was never
[1:17:54] been a time in the history of the world
[1:17:56] that the episcopalians Baptists
[1:17:58] methodists Presbyterians the papers are
[1:18:00] full the religious papers are praising
[1:18:02] God that these sleeping virgins are now
[1:18:04] trying to receive Pentecost trying to
[1:18:06] receive the Holy Ghost and don't the
[1:18:08] people realize that it will not happen
[1:18:10] according to the word of God while they
[1:18:12] were trying to come back the bridegroom
[1:18:13] came and took away the bride and they
[1:18:15] were cast out in the outer Darkness for
[1:18:17] judgment because they rejected their
[1:18:20] invitation so why were they cast out in
[1:18:22] the outer Darkness for all their sinful
[1:18:25] Deeds no because they rejected their day
[1:18:27] of
[1:18:28] invitation so simple 67 all peoples are
[1:18:32] bidden to come God in every age has sent
[1:18:34] out his light and it's been rejected and
[1:18:36] now today is no different than any other
[1:18:38] day to reject the day of visitation when
[1:18:40] God is making a visit to the church and
[1:18:43] to the people receive it then don't put
[1:18:45] it off till next year the next Revival
[1:18:48] that's the hour today is the day of
[1:18:49] salvation and remember God has never
[1:18:51] sent a message in any day but what he
[1:18:53] Vindicated it with the Supernatural
[1:18:56] Jesus said himself if I do not the works
[1:18:57] of my father then believe me not but if
[1:18:59] I do the works you believe the works if
[1:19:01] you can't believe me and when you see it
[1:19:03] clearly cut and made manifest now the
[1:19:06] time has come now the time has come that
[1:19:09] she rejects it then she's bored in the
[1:19:11] ear with the all and she'll never hear
[1:19:13] it she'll never hear it now she takes
[1:19:16] herself to the confederation of churches
[1:19:18] and right to the mark of the beast let's
[1:19:21] go to page 17 paragraph 82 notice bored
[1:19:25] in the ear marked away then you'll never
[1:19:27] hear remember that's a sign of closing
[1:19:30] the ear so being marked in the ear is a
[1:19:32] sign that your ear now is closed to the
[1:19:35] gospel because you refuse it you won't
[1:19:37] hear it no more you won't listen You'll
[1:19:40] never be able again to do it my oh my so
[1:19:47] what separates you from God refusing
[1:19:50] your in your day of invitation that
[1:19:52] separates you from God
[1:19:55] next question what kind of life is not
[1:19:58] worthy let's go to page 16 here at the
[1:20:01] bottom of 16 paragraph
[1:20:04] 76 we cannot do that we've got to follow
[1:20:07] every day every hour of the day every
[1:20:09] step of the way we've got to be led by
[1:20:12] the spirit of led by the Lord Jesus
[1:20:15] Christ if we don't we take an organ
[1:20:17] organizational life and a life that
[1:20:19] doesn't follow Christ daily is not
[1:20:23] worthy so what life is not worthy the
[1:20:25] one that doesn't follow Christ daily
[1:20:28] what did he say before that every day
[1:20:31] every hour of the day every step of the
[1:20:33] way we've got to be led by the Lord
[1:20:36] Jesus
[1:20:37] Christ that's a life that's worthy to
[1:20:40] not be led by the Lord every day every
[1:20:43] hour of the day every step of the way is
[1:20:45] a life that's not
[1:20:47] worthy
[1:20:49] amen that's all for the for the
[1:20:51] questions now I want to I want to go if
[1:20:53] we can take our Bibles really
[1:20:56] quick and go to Matthew 22 because this
[1:20:59] is the other scripture that he
[1:21:00] referenced was Matthew
[1:21:03] 22 and he said you can read that too
[1:21:05] later so I want to read it right now we
[1:21:08] started off by reading Luke 14 now we're
[1:21:10] going to read uh Matthew 22 Matthew
[1:21:16] 22 and let's go to verse
[1:21:21] one and Jesus answered and spake unto
[1:21:23] them again to them again by Parables and
[1:21:26] said the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto
[1:21:28] a certain King which made a marriage for
[1:21:30] a son and sent forth his servants to
[1:21:33] call them that were bidden to the
[1:21:34] wedding and they would not come again he
[1:21:37] sent forth other servants saying tell
[1:21:39] them which are bidden behold I prepared
[1:21:41] my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are
[1:21:43] killed and all things are ready come
[1:21:46] into the marriage but they made light of
[1:21:48] it and went their way one to his farm
[1:21:51] another to his merchandise and the
[1:21:53] remnant took his servants and treated
[1:21:54] them spitefully and slew them but when
[1:21:57] the king heard the thereof he was wroth
[1:21:59] and sent forth of his armies and
[1:22:01] destroyed those murderers and burned up
[1:22:03] their City then saith he to his servants
[1:22:05] the wedding is ready but they which are
[1:22:07] bidden were not
[1:22:09] worthy why were they not worthy because
[1:22:12] they refused the call to come but now
[1:22:16] look what he says go ye therefore in the
[1:22:18] highways and as many and as many as you
[1:22:21] shall find bid to the marriage so so
[1:22:24] these servants went out into the
[1:22:25] highways and gathered together all as
[1:22:27] many as they found both bad and good and
[1:22:30] the wedding was furnished with guests
[1:22:33] I'm so glad he's not looking just for
[1:22:35] good but he's calling the bad too and
[1:22:38] that means I can come to the spiritual
[1:22:40] Feast of the Lord why because I if I've
[1:22:44] been bidden to the feast and something
[1:22:46] in me accepts the invitation then I've
[1:22:49] been accepted amen and I've now been
[1:22:51] found worthy of the Gospel not because I
[1:22:53] was good CU there been both bad and
[1:22:56] good praise God many rejected it and
[1:22:59] many who rejected it were good people
[1:23:02] they weren't bad but they were not
[1:23:04] worthy to come to the feast because they
[1:23:07] made excuses not to come but then the
[1:23:09] call went out to the bad and to the good
[1:23:13] and I say praise God here's one bad
[1:23:15] fellow that heard that
[1:23:18] call and there was something in me that
[1:23:20] wanted to come to the feast I'm so
[1:23:23] thankful for that God bless you as we
[1:23:25] stand musicians if you can come but to
[1:23:27] John if you can make your way
[1:23:31] up
[1:23:33] amen I am so
[1:23:36] thankful that brother Bram didn't preach
[1:23:39] the life that's worthy of the Gospel is
[1:23:41] the one who never makes a mistake and
[1:23:42] gets everything right and lives all the
[1:23:44] word perfectly because this message
[1:23:46] would be super discouraging to me if
[1:23:48] that's the way he preached it but what
[1:23:50] he was preaching is a life worthy of the
[1:23:52] Gospel are you coming To The Feast the
[1:23:55] supernatural have you been bidden have
[1:23:57] you heard the call did something in you
[1:23:59] say I want to come were we willing to
[1:24:02] drop our merchandise and our farms and
[1:24:05] our yoke of oen and everything else and
[1:24:08] come to the call what was that that was
[1:24:11] God calling you to his Feast I'm so glad
[1:24:14] he had put something in me to respond to
[1:24:16] that call I'm not worthy because I'm
[1:24:20] good I'm not worthy because I've Done
[1:24:23] Right
[1:24:24] the only thing that made me Worthy is
[1:24:26] because God had a seat inside of me that
[1:24:28] when I heard the invitation I wanted to
[1:24:31] come and so then I was the one that he
[1:24:34] was calling to to come into His Feast
[1:24:38] I'm so thankful for this message and it
[1:24:40] just gets better and better friends we
[1:24:42] got two more two more sessions to listen
[1:24:44] and it just gets better you know you it
[1:24:48] used to be we thought we had to be
[1:24:50] perfect we had to live just right and
[1:24:52] listen there's not a one of us that
[1:24:53] doesn't want to please the Lord am I
[1:24:55] don't think there's a one of us that
[1:24:57] doesn't want to be obedient to our Lord
[1:24:59] and we want to please him and we want to
[1:25:01] do things that please him and it breaks
