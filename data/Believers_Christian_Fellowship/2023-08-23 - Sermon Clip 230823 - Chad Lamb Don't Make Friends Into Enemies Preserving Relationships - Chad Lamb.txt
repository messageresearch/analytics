========================================

you say well this guy did a certain certain thing your brother didn't do that your sister didn't do that that was the devil got into them that did it so don't blame the brother the sister blame the devil that's the one who caused it amen and brother bam said if you can get somebody to realize this they won't have enmity but they'll feel sorry if you can get to the place where somebody actually says something against you I mean they said something wrong and they said something hurtful and they shouldn't have said it they misunderstood a situation they repeated something wrong if you can get to the place to recognize this is a tactic of the devil and I'm not going to fall so easily to the devil's Wiles but I realized that my brother was just a tool in the devil's hands it wasn't him that brother loves me how do you know that brother loves you because if he loves Christ he loves me he can't help it sometimes we've got to fly a little higher On Eagle's Wings and have Eagle Vision and get out of the Cardinal and stop with all the offense and the hurt and he said and she said and fly a little higher and find out who's moving the chess pieces and you realize now I feel sorry for my brother and you know why I feel sorry for my brother because I'm going to forgive him I'm going to let it go and I'm never going to mention it but someday I know that brother's going to feel sorry for what he did yes and now I feel for him with compassion I'm not angry I'm not upset I don't want him to get in trouble I don't want God to spank him I don't want lightning that's Fallen I'm going to only get in a car accident on the way to work I really want to forgive him and let him go and ask God to forgive him and let him go and realize my brother didn't mean to and I know someday he'll be sorry for that and when that day comes I know what it's like because I've been sorry for things I did wrong and I know how horrible it is and how bad you feel and how shamed you are and how you how you feel like you failed God and your brother and I know that my brother is going to go down that same road and I'm feeling sorry for him now see you realize I'm getting the I'm getting the the the the the pity off of myself and I'm turning it outward and saying God help my brother he didn't mean to do that my sister you know what let's say that you assume that they didn't mean to but really they did how will it hurt you to assume that they did they didn't I would rather be found in error assuming my brother and sister didn't mean to then always in error assuming they did well I just don't want to be a fool don't be thinking for a fool I'd rather be taken for a fool than actually act like a fool I'd rather be taken for a foolish childish doesn't understand what's going on around him brother Chad just doesn't get it I'd rather be in that position than be the one who's wise and understand I see what you're doing you're manipulating here and I'm calling it out and I'm wrong half the time then you keep shame and foolishness upon yourself say God help us we got to recognize that these are the tactics of the enemy not tactics of my brother and sister
