[0:00] i was meditating on what to share
[0:02] i just thought of this little thought
[0:04] that i've been dwelling on and thinking
[0:06] about for days and how it blessed me and
[0:08] it was on the thought of identification
[0:11] and i'd like to just share some
[0:12] scriptures and some quotes with you for
[0:14] a few minutes
[0:16] if we look in colossians chapter 1 verse
[0:18] 15
[0:20] it says who is the image of the
[0:22] invisible god the firstborn of every
[0:24] creature
[0:25] for by him were all things created that
[0:27] are in heaven and that are in earth
[0:29] visible and invisible whether they be
[0:32] thrones or dominions or principalities
[0:35] or powers
[0:36] all things were created by him
[0:38] and for him and he is before all things
[0:41] and by him all things consist and he is
[0:44] the head of the body the church
[0:47] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[0:49] the dead that in all things he might
[0:51] have the preeminence
[0:53] so we see here in colossians it speaks
[0:55] that he is the head of the body and that
[0:58] is what i really want to focus in on
[1:00] just for a few minutes just to capture
[1:03] this thought he is the head of the body
[1:06] and there are two if you look at the two
[1:09] parts that are spoken of here
[1:11] if we look at a human being we have a
[1:13] body
[1:14] and on top of that body is the head
[1:17] and brother
[1:18] the the scriptures here that brother
[1:20] paul is referring to is that he is the
[1:22] head of the body and i want to expound
[1:26] upon that
[1:27] if we look at first corinthians chapter
[1:29] 12 verse 27
[1:31] he says now ye are the body of christ
[1:34] and members in particular
[1:36] so the church is the body of christ but
[1:40] we know from the scriptures that christ
[1:42] is the head of the church
[1:44] so the head of the body is christ
[1:47] and
[1:48] and the body of christ is the church but
[1:52] it's yet all christ amen
[1:54] so the head is christ and the body is
[1:57] christ but but jesus christ the full
[2:00] measure of the word is the head or the
[2:02] full revelation of god is the head
[2:06] and the body the church is the body of
[2:09] christ and all of this together makes up
[2:11] christ
[2:13] so
[2:14] i was thinking on this
[2:17] some statements that brother branham had
[2:18] made in the message and i'll start with
[2:21] the one christ is the mystery of god
[2:23] revealed
[2:25] in christ is the mystery of god revealed
[2:26] paragraph 5 28 he says therefore it is
[2:30] the word or nothing
[2:32] that's right he the word how do you know
[2:34] what's right he the word is vindicated
[2:37] see he the word properly vindicated is
[2:40] the headship the head of the church he
[2:42] is the word the headship so now the
[2:45] prophet is telling us that he is the
[2:47] headship he the word is the headship or
[2:50] the head of the body which is the word
[2:53] and he's properly identified
[2:56] he said he is properly
[2:58] identificate identified vindicated by
[3:01] his own spirit being in the church
[3:03] itself the person
[3:05] showing forth himself in vindication is
[3:08] the direct proof to the entire body you
[3:11] don't need creeds then denominations has
[3:13] perished but the headship itself
[3:16] recognized in the body by personal
[3:18] identification see identifying himself
[3:22] proves the headship to the body
[3:24] then we are united under one vindicated
[3:27] headship that is christ the word of god
[3:31] so this great head of the body is christ
[3:33] the word of god and he is the headship
[3:36] of the body and he has been vindicated
[3:39] he has been identified in this last days
[3:42] and we know that he was identified
[3:44] through a messenger through a prophet
[3:47] and there was
[3:48] a son of man revealing the son of man
[3:51] and the son of man is the ministry of
[3:53] jesus christ himself and it was jesus
[3:55] christ himself working through that son
[3:58] of man brother branham and identifying
[4:01] himself to the masses and showing amen
[4:05] that through the sign of the messiah who
[4:07] was present it was jesus christ himself
[4:10] was present and then when it comes time
[4:12] for the opening of the seven seals the
[4:15] prophet of god tells us that only the
[4:17] lamb jesus christ himself can open the
[4:19] seals no man can open these seals no
[4:22] theologian no no great person no school
[4:25] of theology nobody can open the seals
[4:28] only christ himself could open these
[4:30] seals and so in the opening of the seals
[4:33] god would reveal those seals to brother
[4:35] branham brother branham would then
[4:36] reveal the seals the mystery of the
[4:38] thunders amen those seven unknown
[4:41] thunders which is the revelation of the
[4:44] seven seals he would begin to break
[4:46] those down and what was that it was an
[4:49] identification of who was present
[4:51] because the lamb is the only one that
[4:53] can open the seals so the headship has
[4:56] been come down into the body and has
[4:59] been identified there's been an
[5:01] identification of who is present and the
[5:04] one who is present is jesus christ the
[5:07] word of god the headship coming to the
[5:10] body and that identification was made
[5:12] plain through a prophetic ministry where
[5:15] brother branham would say he said my
[5:17] ministry is to declare that he is here
[5:20] and through that ministry
[5:22] christ was identified among us he was
[5:25] present tense he was here he was the
[5:28] mighty angel that came down to open
[5:30] those seven seals so the headship has
[5:33] come to the body and identified himself
[5:38] and
[5:39] in the message it is the rising of the
[5:41] sun from 1965 we come to paragraph 307
[5:44] and he says look what we've seen in this
[5:46] day
[5:47] the quickening power has come to us to
[5:49] open the seven seals what was that the
[5:52] intelligence of man no the quickening
[5:55] power of god see the quickening power of
[5:57] god foretold this would take place see
[5:59] the quickening power of god made the
[6:02] world testify to it it's the truth
[6:05] the angel of the lord i told you was
[6:06] around in the pillar of fire quickening
[6:09] power let the world testify that it's
[6:11] the truth and in that they didn't know
[6:14] what it was and we knew
[6:16] and now he's referring to the clown they
[6:19] didn't know what it was we knew just
[6:21] look this away it's our lord up there
[6:23] you see and brother brandon was
[6:25] referring to the picture of the cloud
[6:27] that was taken in arizona in 1963 and
[6:30] was also displayed in life magazine and
[6:33] sent all over the world and he said they
[6:35] took the picture they they didn't know
[6:37] what it was we knew what was it it was
[6:40] another way that christ was identifying
[6:42] himself
[6:44] uh he said just look this away and it's
[6:46] our lord up there and if you look at the
[6:48] picture you can see the picture as it
[6:50] appeared in life magazine
[6:53] was the headstone was the capstone it
[6:55] was in a pyramid shape and brother
[6:57] branham had taught us that that this god
[7:00] has been building his church building
[7:02] his body amen from the time of christ on
[7:05] building it through seven church ages
[7:07] building it all the way up till it
[7:09] finally comes to the completion of the
[7:11] seventh church age and upon that
[7:13] completion of the seventh church age
[7:15] will come the headstone or the capstone
[7:17] amen and he saw it in the form of a
[7:19] pyramid coming to complete the body of
[7:22] the bride coming to finish the
[7:24] manifestation of the bride or the new
[7:27] testament and we see it here in pyramid
[7:29] form and brother branham says it was
[7:31] those he says it was those uh seven
[7:34] angels that made up his wig seven angels
[7:38] declaring the full revelation of the
[7:40] full seven church ages now being
[7:42] completed now at the end of that those
[7:45] seven angels will outline the head of
[7:48] christ the capstone will be coming down
[7:50] the headship coming to the body
[7:53] but
[7:54] brother branham said in the last quote
[7:56] we read he said look at it this away
[7:58] and we know and we'll read the quote in
[8:00] a moment but he's told to turn the
[8:02] picture to the right and when he turns
[8:04] the picture to the right now that
[8:06] capstone that pyramid shape headstone
[8:09] coming down when it's turned to the
[8:11] right is the outline of the face of
[8:13] jesus christ
[8:15] identifying who this headstone is
[8:17] identifying what this cloud is all about
[8:21] it's the headship the headstone the word
[8:24] coming back to the body to the bride
[8:28] he says it early on and it is the rising
[8:30] of the sun if we back up in this message
[8:32] and read from paragraph 15
[8:34] he says well if you turn the picture
[8:37] like this and look you can probably see
[8:40] it from the audience it's christ see
[8:43] his eyes look here just as perfect as it
[8:45] could be wearing the white wig of
[8:47] supreme deity and judge of all heavens
[8:49] and earth can you see his eyes nose his
[8:52] mouth
[8:53] just turn the picture from this the way
[8:55] they had it this way the way it's
[8:57] supposed to be
[8:58] and you can see it he is supreme judge
[9:02] there is none other but him and that is
[9:04] a perfect identification again
[9:07] a vindication that this message is the
[9:10] truth amen brother branham pointed to
[9:12] that cloud showing that the capstone was
[9:15] the headstone and it was the headship of
[9:18] christ returning back to the church to
[9:21] open the seven seals to peel away the
[9:23] mystery that has been laying in the
[9:25] bible since the foundation of the world
[9:27] to bring the word back to the people
[9:29] back to the brine and he said this there
[9:32] is none other but him and that is a
[9:34] perfect identification again a
[9:37] vindication that this message is the
[9:39] truth because brother bennett said this
[9:41] message is christ amen and so the
[9:44] vindication of the cloud is to vindicate
[9:47] that the message is true who vindicated
[9:50] it christ himself he's the only one who
[9:52] could put that clown there he's the only
[9:54] one that can make the seven angels make
[9:56] the outline of his face that when you
[9:58] would turn it to the right and brother
[10:00] branham didn't even see that when he
[10:01] first saw the clown later the angel of
[10:03] the lord told him turn it to the right
[10:05] and he says i have it right now he says
[10:07] turn it turn it right and he said maybe
[10:09] i thought to the right and when he
[10:11] turned it to the right he said there it
[10:13] was it was the face of jesus christ
[10:15] vindicating that this message is the
[10:18] truth this message was not vindicated by
[10:20] a man it was vindicated by almighty god
[10:23] himself
[10:25] he said that's the vindication that this
[10:27] message is the truth this is the truth
[10:29] it is true and making him not a third
[10:32] person but the only person with the
[10:34] white you see the dark his face his
[10:37] beard and his eyes and if we look at
[10:39] this picture in a black and white form
[10:41] you'll see that
[10:43] this is what brother venom is referring
[10:45] to when it turned to the right you can
[10:47] see his eyes his nose his mouth his
[10:50] beard and his white wig of supreme deity
[10:54] and he and he says again and it is the
[10:56] rising of the sun he is the one who
[10:58] opened those seals so who opened the
[11:01] seals william branham didn't open the
[11:03] seals jesus christ opened the seals the
[11:05] lamb is the only one who can open the
[11:07] seals he is the one who opened those
[11:09] seals he is those seals for the whole
[11:12] word of god is christ and christ is the
[11:15] seals that was opened
[11:17] what is opening the seals then revealing
[11:20] christ
[11:21] and the very seven angels which
[11:23] represented the seven churches all
[11:25] completed and we couldn't see it they
[11:28] did they took the picture not us and
[11:31] there he is standing there supreme judge
[11:33] showing that he is alpha and omega the
[11:35] beginning and the end
[11:37] what
[11:38] identification
[11:40] quickening power did that to us
[11:42] quickening power lets us see his coming
[11:46] so
[11:47] this is his coming down
[11:50] to qui to identify to vindicate it's an
[11:54] identification that the message is true
[11:56] it's an identification of who is coming
[11:58] the mighty angel who is the mighty angel
[12:00] it's none other than christ himself
[12:02] what's he coming down to do he's coming
[12:05] down to open the seals he's coming down
[12:07] as the headship to unite with the body
[12:10] to become one with his bride upon the
[12:12] earth in this end time and he's
[12:14] identifying himself through the signs in
[12:17] the heavens he's identifying himself
[12:19] through the opening of the seals he's
[12:21] identifying himself through the sign of
[12:23] the messiah amen he's identifying
[12:25] himself as the ministry of the son of
[12:27] man working in a son of man amen he what
[12:31] is he doing he's identified he's trying
[12:33] to show his bride who this is that's
[12:35] speaking who this is that's come down
[12:38] who opened the seals what is the seals
[12:40] the seals is christ what is the bible
[12:42] it's christ amen where is he coming he's
[12:45] coming to his body amen who is his body
[12:49] his church amen and so now is not only
[12:52] identification of who's come down he's
[12:55] also identifying where he's coming to
[12:57] and where is he coming he's coming to
[12:59] his wife he's coming to his bride he's
[13:01] coming to his true church and now not
[13:04] only is christ identified now that
[13:07] church is identified by the headship
[13:10] coming to the body
[13:12] brother branham says in christ is the
[13:14] mystery of god revealed he said but i'm
[13:16] talking about the headship of christ
[13:18] notice being personally identified by
[13:21] the original headship we have the answer
[13:24] to the devil's question amen glory we
[13:26] have the answer to the devil's question
[13:29] he christ is risen has paid the price
[13:32] and raised up the head or the body who
[13:36] raised up the body it was christ who
[13:38] raised up the body then he came down to
[13:41] identify that body that body is being
[13:43] raised up through seven church ages he's
[13:46] been building a body he's been building
[13:48] it up and bringing up that body through
[13:50] seven church ages and at the end of the
[13:53] seven church ages he comes down as the
[13:56] headship to unite with the body he has
[13:58] built up through seven church ages to
[14:00] identify this is the body this is my
[14:03] body this is my head coming to my body
[14:06] making the complete picture of christ
[14:10] he again says in christ as the mystery
[14:12] of god revealed what is it not them
[14:14] people
[14:15] the headship and the body has become one
[14:17] unit it's god manifested in his people
[14:23] when we look at the identification
[14:26] of christ in this message
[14:29] christ went to jesus christ went through
[14:31] great lengths to identify himself with
[14:34] that man it wasn't it wasn't the son of
[14:38] man it was it was the son of man it
[14:40] wasn't brother branham he was just a son
[14:42] of man revealing the son of man the son
[14:45] of man is the ministry of jesus christ
[14:47] himself then he showed the sign of a
[14:49] messiah to discern the thoughts and
[14:51] intents of the people's heart brother
[14:52] bam said i can't do that that's him
[14:55] doing that he said you never touched me
[14:57] you never touched him in my garment
[14:59] you've touched the hymn of his garment
[15:00] and it's christ speaking back then he
[15:03] identified himself in the cloud turning
[15:05] it to the right showing his face a
[15:07] perfect depiction of the face of jesus
[15:09] christ identifying who the mighty angel
[15:12] was it's coming down to open the seals
[15:13] and then in the opening of the seals
[15:15] he's showing that he's here because the
[15:16] lamb is the only one who can open the
[15:18] seals
[15:19] but he was so thoroughly identified so
[15:22] that you and i can be thoroughly
[15:24] identified because that head was coming
[15:26] to rest somewhere upon the earth and it
[15:29] was only going to rest on his body that
[15:32] head had a body to come down upon and
[15:35] that body was not methodist that body
[15:37] was not baptist that body was not
[15:39] catholic that body was the bride that
[15:42] had been built over seven church ages
[15:44] now coming to its complete form and that
[15:47] body is identified by the individuals
[15:49] who can receive that headship and that
[15:52] headship is the full revelation of the
[15:54] full word of god and if you in this day
[15:58] can look at that cloud and say that's my
[16:00] lord up there and that message that was
[16:02] preached by that prophet is nothing but
[16:03] the pure word of god and i receive it
[16:06] and i submit to it and i surrender my
[16:08] life to it in every way then that
[16:10] message that cloud those seals have
[16:13] identified you as the body he's resting
[16:15] on so the identification of christ is
[16:18] the identification of you as a member of
[16:20] his bride and if you by a seed gene of
[16:24] god on the inside can look at that
[16:26] manifestation and say that's my lord up
[16:28] there that was god working in that man
[16:31] that was jesus christ who opened the
[16:33] seals and every word of it is absolutely
[16:36] thus saith the lord and i surrender my
[16:38] life to it then that identification has
[16:41] identified you as the body that the
[16:43] headship is resting on and now you've
[16:46] moved into the manifestation of the
[16:47] capstone christ and his bride united in
[16:52] you and you're here to display that
[16:55] identification not only was christ
[16:58] identified not only was that prophet
[16:59] identified but his body was identified
[17:02] there should be no question in our minds
[17:04] anymore who we are we are the bride of
[17:07] jesus christ because the headship has
[17:09] come to us we've received the headship
[17:11] without reservations without questions
[17:14] without doubting and that revelation has
[17:17] identified that we came from god we are
[17:19] here to manifest god and we're going
[17:22] back to god where is the body the body
[17:24] is in his bride who is his bride the
[17:27] ones that can receive the headship
[17:28] because the headship only comes to the
[17:30] body
[17:32] i would like to finish with this with
[17:34] this scripture in colossians chapter 1
[17:37] verse 26 and verse 27
[17:40] even the mystery which hath been hid
[17:42] from ages and from generations but now
[17:44] is made manifest to his saints to whom
[17:47] god would make known what is the riches
[17:48] of the glory of this mystery among the
[17:50] gentiles which is christ in you
[17:53] the hope of glory
[17:55] listen friends it's not the it's not
[17:58] christ in you the hope of your glory
[18:00] it's christ in you the hope of all glory
[18:02] because this is the finishing act of
[18:04] god's redemption story to come down and
[18:07] unite with his bride to reverse what we
[18:09] lost in the garden of eden he's restored
[18:12] adam that was the old testament jesus
[18:14] christ came as the restoration of adam
[18:16] then through the new testament he's been
[18:17] restoring back eve bringing the bride
[18:20] back and now the old testament and new
[18:22] testament is bridegroom and bride
[18:24] husband and wife and at the end time
[18:26] he's come down himself in the full
[18:29] revelation of the word and united bride
[18:31] and groom together old testament and new
[18:33] testament with the full revelation of
[18:35] the full word and now it's christ in you
[18:38] the hope of glory all glory all heaven
[18:41] all earth all redemption is waiting on
[18:44] this manifestation to come into the
[18:46] fullness of its manifestation and to end
[18:50] the cycle of redemption and bring us to
[18:52] the millennium
[18:54] friends he's been identified he's
[18:56] identified himself he's identified this
[18:58] message he's identified you and i
[19:01] by uniting with us
[19:03] thank god for our identification
[19:07] say god bless you
[19:08] i love you we appreciate you so much and
[19:11] may these things that god has given us
[19:13] in this message may encourage you may it
[19:16] warm your heart may it give you your
[19:18] identification may this message in this
[19:21] coming of christ to open these seals and
[19:23] reveal this word may it identify you as
[19:26] the bride of jesus christ god bless you
[19:28] friends amen
