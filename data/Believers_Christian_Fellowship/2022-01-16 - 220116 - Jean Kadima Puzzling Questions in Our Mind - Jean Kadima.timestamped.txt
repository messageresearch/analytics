[5:21] amen
[5:22] it's so wonderful to be back in the
[5:24] house of the lord
[5:27] um
[5:28] i just spoke to uh brother chad a while
[5:31] ago and he's greeting the church
[5:34] he misses you guys
[5:37] so um the family is doing well sister
[5:39] angie is um not feeling very well so but
[5:43] uh
[5:44] your prayers will
[5:47] will do something so it will heal her
[5:51] so um and god will heal her so we
[5:56] it's a privilege to be here
[5:58] and uh
[6:01] let's keep up pastor in
[6:03] prayer this morning are you ready for
[6:07] the word
[6:09] amen oh i see a preacher here
[6:13] i forget the name i'm sorry my mind went
[6:15] blank
[6:18] yes brother owen uh yes uh he's uh
[6:24] i've seen him at but donnie reagan's
[6:27] church and uh
[6:28] his sister judy's father
[6:31] god bless you
[6:33] so um let's bow our head with a prayer
[6:38] heavenly father we just feel
[6:42] we feel good because
[6:44] you knew this day
[6:46] you knew that your children would gather
[6:48] together
[6:50] to hear your word father you made
[6:53] everything to work out so that we can be
[6:56] here
[6:57] we ask you to take control of the
[6:59] service from the beginning to the end
[7:02] father
[7:03] use us just as a true um god
[7:07] i'll be with us without you we cannot do
[7:10] anything
[7:12] but with you everything is possible
[7:15] when you open nobody closes
[7:18] and when you close nobody opens
[7:21] so we rely on you
[7:25] this morning once again
[7:27] grant to us your grace and mercy
[7:30] as we committing our life to you
[7:33] in jesus christ's name we pray
[7:36] amen
[7:39] um thank you musicians as you are
[7:41] standing up let's just go straight to
[7:43] the word of god
[7:45] we're going to read
[7:48] second corinthians
[7:53] so
[7:54] this morning
[7:56] i would say that i have an exhortation
[8:02] rather than
[8:03] teaching or something when i look at it
[8:06] it's like an exhortation
[8:08] could be good too right
[8:10] so um
[8:13] the theme
[8:14] is always about being
[8:16] sure of our calling
[8:20] and our election
[8:22] and uh that team has been spoken of many
[8:26] many times here
[8:28] even recently so i'm gonna just add my
[8:31] own you know way of looking at things
[8:35] my own words basically but the theme is
[8:39] the same nothing new
[8:42] second corinthians chapter
[8:45] 1 verse 18
[8:50] okay but as god is true a word toward
[8:54] you was not yea
[8:56] and nay
[8:58] for the son of god jesus christ who was
[9:01] preached among you by us even by me and
[9:05] sylvanas and timos timotheus
[9:09] was not yea and nay but in him was yea
[9:16] for all the promises of god in him are
[9:18] yea and in
[9:20] him amen
[9:23] unto the glory of god by us
[9:26] now he which
[9:28] established us with you in christ and
[9:31] had anointed us is god who had also
[9:35] sealed us and given the earnest of the
[9:39] spirit in our hearts
[9:42] may god had a blessing to the reading of
[9:45] the word you may take your seats
[9:53] so
[9:57] as i say
[9:59] we need to be
[10:01] certain of our calling
[10:04] we need to be certain of the word that
[10:06] we hear
[10:08] day in
[10:09] day out
[10:12] we need to be sure that this is the true
[10:15] word of god and it doesn't come from man
[10:20] and his impact is
[10:22] tremendous
[10:24] when we bring this word somewhere else
[10:28] you guys are
[10:29] used to this word
[10:32] but when we bring it to some somewhere
[10:35] else
[10:38] ah
[10:39] people get hungry
[10:42] amen and they want more
[10:45] i'm not saying that you don't want more
[10:49] but maybe what i want to say is is not
[10:52] about our ministry
[10:54] but is about the word
[10:57] and
[10:58] the word was always there
[11:01] the message was already there but god
[11:05] has opened our understanding to it
[11:09] and even for people that have been in a
[11:11] message for very long time when we bring
[11:14] it to them they want more
[11:17] amen
[11:19] but think about this
[11:24] if there are questions in our mind
[11:28] if there is anybody on the sideline
[11:32] who still have question in the mind
[11:36] then the word will be
[11:38] nay
[11:39] and
[11:41] and yey
[11:42] and that's a very
[11:44] bad position to be in
[11:47] that's why this morning
[11:49] by god's grace
[11:51] i want the person or persons that may be
[11:55] on the sideline
[11:57] to hear something from the lord that
[12:00] will remove those questions in their
[12:03] mind because this message is true
[12:08] this world has a power of transformation
[12:13] this world will transform our body to go
[12:16] home
[12:17] so nobody should have an a and yet
[12:21] it gotta be yeah yeah yeah
[12:25] [Applause]
[12:26] amen
[12:27] so that's the exaltation i have this
[12:30] morning
[12:32] and i'm calling it uh
[12:34] you know
[12:35] puzzling questions in your mind
[12:38] we will always have questions
[12:41] sometimes we will have a puzzling
[12:43] questions
[12:45] but i'm calling it this way because
[12:48] that's how the prophet calls it
[12:51] they're puzzling because they're
[12:53] paralyzing our faith
[12:56] okay
[12:57] when they paralyze our faith our faith
[13:00] cannot grow
[13:02] if we have this kind of questions
[13:05] it is time for us
[13:08] to go into conference with him
[13:11] it's time to go back to the world
[13:14] and check it
[13:15] because we gotta be certain of what we
[13:19] heard
[13:20] day in day out
[13:23] it's tremendous
[13:25] hallelujah
[13:27] so
[13:28] that's the what we're trying to say this
[13:31] morning
[13:32] i got grace
[13:34] questions and answer in 1959
[13:38] brother bottom says
[13:41] and now the church has assembled
[13:43] together tonight
[13:44] to worship you we've come
[13:47] to answer questions that's been asked
[13:49] it's
[13:50] it's the sincerity in the heart of the
[13:53] people that these things
[13:56] puzzle them in the mind and lord we do
[13:59] realize that if anything is puzzling us
[14:02] we can never have faith
[14:05] as long as there is a question so we
[14:08] we do not want any questions
[14:12] there will be
[14:13] always a questions
[14:16] but those questions should not puzzle
[14:18] our mind
[14:20] and paralyze our faith
[14:22] if there is
[14:24] it's your duty
[14:25] to seek god
[14:27] to check the word
[14:29] even to speak to brothers and sisters
[14:33] amen
[14:34] [Music]
[14:35] because no one has to have this type of
[14:39] questions
[14:42] now barbara continues
[14:45] lord
[14:46] we see the need of the baptism of the
[14:48] holy ghost among
[14:50] our people and among this church
[14:53] and we don't want any questions in the
[14:56] mind we want it all clear now
[14:59] so that they know what it is when it
[15:03] comes and know that it's
[15:05] for them
[15:07] amen
[15:09] check the
[15:10] word have conference with him
[15:14] bring it to the minister
[15:17] amen
[15:19] oh no brother uh is not the nikolaitan
[15:23] no
[15:24] not all the holy ghost is on the pastor
[15:27] no
[15:28] yes we have greater revelation of god
[15:31] yes but yet still we can still go to the
[15:35] minister
[15:37] to ask puzzling questions
[15:40] we check the word we pray we go into
[15:43] conference with god
[15:44] then we
[15:46] we ask the pastor
[15:49] the minister
[15:50] so that no questions are
[15:57] because we are called to go home
[16:00] amen
[16:02] we don't have answers to all questions
[16:05] if you see one person who has
[16:08] answers to all questions you got to run
[16:13] amen but any question that
[16:16] is a scripture question has a scripture
[16:20] answer anything as an answer in the in
[16:24] the word
[16:26] amen
[16:30] amen are you with me
[16:35] or i don't want to speak to brothers
[16:37] i have some questions
[16:39] maybe what is being preached
[16:42] or something like that
[16:44] but
[16:46] um you know i don't want to be
[16:48] [Music]
[16:49] people write you off
[16:52] and they
[16:53] think that you are not a team player
[16:58] right sometimes
[17:01] i used to be a pastor so i'm not talking
[17:03] about somebody here right
[17:06] all right but people do that
[17:09] and then they're hurting
[17:12] this they're standing on the sideline
[17:15] they have questions in their mind
[17:17] but they
[17:18] afraid of it and then one day because
[17:23] they are not progressing
[17:25] with the pillar of fire as the pillow
[17:29] fire is advancing they're not advancing
[17:32] then when you don't advance you become
[17:35] stagnant
[17:40] amen
[17:43] having
[17:44] questions doesn't mean
[17:48] that you are not a good christian right
[17:52] right
[17:53] no
[17:56] providing his word 1964
[17:59] for it's possible that staunch
[18:02] christians
[18:04] find people
[18:05] hold sometimes hold to the wrong things
[18:09] thinking it's right
[18:11] so
[18:12] not bad people
[18:14] but good christians
[18:16] you know
[18:18] people filled with the holy ghost
[18:21] ragged christians
[18:24] sometimes
[18:27] they can hold to something that is wrong
[18:30] it doesn't make them wrong right
[18:32] it's just a situation a condition
[18:36] but then these things should be proven
[18:39] whether they are right or wrong and it's
[18:41] the duty of all of us as we are
[18:44] expecting to go to heaven when jesus
[18:47] comes is the minister's duty when any
[18:51] question is brought up
[18:52] that he solved this out and then proves
[18:55] it before the people that they might
[18:57] understand because no one wants to be
[19:00] found wrong holding to the wrong thing
[19:04] if i have a question it doesn't make me
[19:07] a bad
[19:08] christian
[19:10] it doesn't make me a less christian
[19:14] is that right
[19:15] so you see it's an exhortation
[19:17] yeah it's basic right
[19:20] but it's true
[19:22] where you finding the whole congregation
[19:25] sometimes a person there they have so
[19:29] many things questions why this why that
[19:32] when they stay they are sitting on the
[19:34] sideline and keeping just quiet
[19:38] if i ask they will write me off they
[19:41] will think i'm not a good christian and
[19:43] people have tendency of discarding you
[19:47] right
[19:50] so somebody has to talk about something
[19:51] like that right
[19:53] so unto won't you be happy if somebody
[19:56] was
[19:57] sitting on the sideline and here they
[19:59] smoke this morning
[20:01] amen and that bring a solution to them
[20:05] absolutely absolutely
[20:08] absolutely now
[20:13] yes
[20:15] so we have to be sure
[20:17] of what we have received
[20:20] so
[20:21] we have to be sure of what we have
[20:24] received what we have actually
[20:26] received in the world that will bring us
[20:30] home
[20:31] that's exactly right
[20:33] because we have received the invitation
[20:36] which is the shout out
[20:39] we haven't even received the clothes to
[20:42] be
[20:42] in the wedding supper
[20:45] hallelujah so there must not be a
[20:49] question
[20:51] amen proving his word i'm continuing
[20:55] okay
[20:57] see it's the
[20:59] son of man jesus christ
[21:03] will come down in the human flesh among
[21:06] us and will make his words so real that
[21:09] it will unite
[21:12] the church and him as one the bride and
[21:16] and then she will go home to the
[21:19] wedding supper and the verb say amen
[21:22] she's already united see we go to the
[21:27] wedding supper not to the marriage
[21:31] fill your flesh itself and all the flesh
[21:34] of mighty men cause the marriage of the
[21:37] lamb has come
[21:40] so
[21:41] you must be sure because the world is
[21:45] uniting with a people right now
[21:50] so that is the rapture of the change in
[21:54] our body is a certain because right now
[21:58] the head has come to unite with the body
[22:03] we are not going to a marriage we are
[22:07] going to the supper and we already
[22:10] received the invitation we have the
[22:14] clothes on
[22:17] hallelujah
[22:20] the devil can exploit anything
[22:24] to paralyze our faith
[22:26] and that's why this morning our
[22:28] exaltation is be sure in what you have
[22:32] received what you hear is the word of
[22:36] god
[22:37] that will
[22:39] bring you to that wedding supper
[22:44] but the rapture is going to
[22:47] the rapture in itself what we call the
[22:49] rapture
[22:51] is going to the wedding supper because
[22:54] the
[22:55] marriage is taking place right now
[22:58] now the wedding is taking place right
[23:01] now but we're going to
[23:03] the supper
[23:04] but there we need clothes
[23:07] is that right
[23:08] we need an invitation
[23:10] we need clothes
[23:14] all right
[23:15] and they have been given to us
[23:17] right now
[23:20] amen
[23:22] where was i
[23:23] when the word here unites with the
[23:26] person
[23:27] they to become one
[23:30] then what does it do then
[23:32] it manifests the son of man again
[23:36] not the church theology the son of man
[23:39] the word and the church becomes one
[23:42] whatever the son of man done
[23:44] he was the word the church does the same
[23:48] thing
[23:50] oh what an assurance right
[23:53] what an assurance
[23:56] amen
[23:58] what an assurance
[24:00] now listen what the prophets say in 1962
[24:05] present stage of my ministry
[24:08] you say well all men have forsaken me
[24:12] but there is one thing he's stood by me
[24:15] i'm not
[24:16] i wasn't disobedient to heavenly vision
[24:20] that happened down there on the river
[24:23] i've stayed true to it
[24:25] he's been true to me i'm trusting in him
[24:28] someday i don't know when for a crowning
[24:32] of my ministry have stayed
[24:35] just as true as i could amen
[24:39] now he's continue saying that i don't
[24:41] know what it will be i don't know when
[24:44] it will be and i just when is ready i am
[24:49] i don't care i hope it will crown my
[24:52] ministry of this of letting me take the
[24:56] clothes of the world and dress is bright
[24:59] in the clothes of the world and for his
[25:02] righteousness
[25:04] oh did he do it
[25:06] did brother branham dress the bride
[25:09] was it just a prayer
[25:12] or did he dress the bride
[25:15] so where is the question then
[25:18] so we receive the invitation which is
[25:21] the shout that gather everybody together
[25:24] the bride together
[25:26] we receive the close of his
[25:29] word
[25:32] now
[25:33] we we are ready to
[25:35] get there without any question
[25:39] and he say i hope
[25:42] ah
[25:43] i hope he will crown me
[25:46] let me stand on that day say behold the
[25:49] lamb of god that takes away the sin of
[25:52] the world
[25:54] did he do it
[25:57] my
[25:58] did the prophet say
[26:00] this is the lamb
[26:02] of god
[26:04] my good
[26:05] think about this
[26:07] when john was told to look for the lamb
[26:11] when he looked he didn't see a lamb
[26:15] therefore if brother burnham said this
[26:17] is the lamb
[26:19] when we turn around we will see a
[26:22] lion are you with me
[26:25] and who is the lion is the king
[26:29] and the king is the judge
[26:32] in israel if you are a king you are a
[26:35] judge
[26:37] do you believe that
[26:39] so
[26:40] he say
[26:41] i will put the claws of the world on the
[26:44] bride
[26:47] and i will
[26:49] like john the baptist who introduced
[26:52] jesus
[26:53] i will do the same
[26:54] i will say here is the lamb
[26:57] and when people turn around
[26:59] they see the lion
[27:03] they see the cloud
[27:05] with the king who is a judge
[27:11] john turned around this did not see a
[27:13] lamb
[27:15] he said he saw the judge
[27:17] amen
[27:19] is so the lion
[27:21] amen
[27:24] so why does the devil
[27:30] put those puzzling
[27:32] questions in our mind
[27:35] of course he has to do that
[27:38] that is work to do
[27:40] and we need
[27:41] our work is to believe
[27:44] amen
[27:45] everyone has to do their job he has to
[27:48] do his job
[27:50] because he sees his days
[27:53] advancing
[27:54] he has to make the doubt in
[27:57] in you
[27:58] and me
[27:59] but i have to stay stand have an answer
[28:03] for him not a conversation with him but
[28:07] an answer for him
[28:09] don't ever have a conversation with him
[28:12] just an answer and keep going
[28:17] amen
[28:22] so as you can see
[28:24] talking about puzzling questions in your
[28:27] mind you can go so many directions
[28:31] what can puzzle a person
[28:34] is not just what they hear
[28:37] it's things in their lives
[28:40] you know situations
[28:43] but all this become puzzling
[28:46] when they attack
[28:48] it they it attack your life
[28:52] it attack the life that is in you it
[28:55] attacked the world that is in you
[28:58] it becomes a problem
[29:00] that's the problem it causes you to
[29:04] doubt the word that you have
[29:07] situation can come
[29:09] i can look at them and say lord i don't
[29:12] understand this but he will not
[29:16] you know this it should not
[29:19] get me to a point where
[29:21] i doubt the word that i received from
[29:24] the lord
[29:27] look at this question that they asked
[29:30] brother branham in 1964
[29:32] brother branham what seems to be wrong
[29:34] in the day
[29:36] when we are living in the day we when we
[29:39] are living and being a believer and
[29:41] following the message and the messenger
[29:43] today
[29:44] when we cannot seem to pray like we
[29:47] would like to
[29:49] that's a good question
[29:50] i believe brother sister ever
[29:53] who ask it it's a cause of
[29:56] the condition of time the revival is
[29:59] over
[30:00] what revival
[30:02] denominations the revival
[30:05] is over
[30:07] they feel good revival
[30:10] is over
[30:11] are you with me
[30:13] and people we i want i feel like i'm not
[30:16] a christian
[30:17] i used to feel this way it's no longer
[30:21] feel good
[30:23] it's believing the word
[30:27] oh the light the revival has lasted some
[30:30] 15 years and never did last before
[30:34] over about three years i believe
[30:37] it's receiving its last revival
[30:41] okay and i believe we uh that why you
[30:44] can't pray and feel the spirit like you
[30:46] used to it's because the revival fires
[30:50] have gone it's about those type of
[30:54] revivals are gone
[30:58] are you with me
[31:00] it's
[31:01] gone and now it's the word it's a it's
[31:05] the bride revival
[31:09] she is becoming the word and the word
[31:12] alone
[31:14] it doesn't mean she's not
[31:16] happy she has no feel good
[31:20] but those revivals that we're expecting
[31:23] everybody coming yeah yeah yeah let's
[31:25] fill up the church ah everything is
[31:28] wonderful that's not the revival we're
[31:30] looking for
[31:32] it's a men women with christ
[31:36] the word together
[31:39] that's the revival that we're looking
[31:40] for
[31:41] [Music]
[31:42] oh i want that we don't i want a little
[31:46] bit of
[31:48] sensation you know
[31:51] it's over that one is over okay
[31:54] don't expect it
[31:55] but keep the life in you
[31:57] the word
[31:59] yes you will have the joy of the lord in
[32:01] your heart
[32:04] you will still have that
[32:06] you know
[32:07] people listen to the word and you can
[32:09] see them dancing
[32:12] in the
[32:13] bedroom
[32:15] in the woods
[32:17] with this
[32:18] brother
[32:19] what's going on with you
[32:22] my this world is wonderful
[32:25] it has the power of transformation
[32:29] amen
[32:31] amen
[32:35] so sometimes we look into for the wrong
[32:38] things and when we don't see it he
[32:41] puzzles us
[32:43] we have questions now we start
[32:45] questioning our christianity we start
[32:48] questioning what we hear every day we
[32:50] start questioning our church we're such
[32:53] questioning our
[32:54] minister but
[32:56] that's not the word the word has not
[32:59] promised us all this kind of sensation
[33:03] but the word with the individual
[33:06] becoming one
[33:10] and anything can happen in that case
[33:15] is that right
[33:16] anything can happen you don't even have
[33:18] to you cannot even think what can happen
[33:22] buddha venom says it's hard
[33:25] to know
[33:27] what will happen
[33:31] amen
[33:35] are you with me
[33:37] am i the only religious person here
[33:41] all right
[33:44] listen
[33:45] we need to keep the life
[33:49] that is in
[33:50] us that's the revival that we need to
[33:54] keep
[33:55] the life that is in us
[33:58] that life comes from the word
[34:01] amen
[34:02] and i read this
[34:04] uh code
[34:06] uh maybe a long time ago here in 1963
[34:10] where brother ben talks about
[34:12] how can i overcome and it talks about
[34:15] being in a wood
[34:17] i was crossing an old log the other day
[34:21] down a wash and
[34:23] what is called a hello and i
[34:26] jumped up on this log on the outside it
[34:30] looked good
[34:32] looked like a big old log
[34:35] but when i jump on it and oh great chunk
[34:38] of it
[34:39] fell off
[34:40] it was real rotten daddy
[34:44] and i said that's the way
[34:46] christians have becoming
[34:49] are becoming
[34:51] so
[34:52] they say that
[34:54] they've been dead in sin and trespasses
[34:57] so long till become dirty
[35:00] they can hold no weight at all
[35:03] they don't know what the overcoming
[35:05] means
[35:07] and i begin to think of this text then
[35:11] overcome
[35:13] keep life in you when life went out
[35:17] that's what brought that love to that
[35:20] condition see
[35:21] it made it worse than ever when it laid
[35:25] in the branch where the water was
[35:28] that
[35:29] the branch or the uh the log
[35:32] had life
[35:35] and then it was cut
[35:37] it was laying there
[35:38] and the water came
[35:40] from the rain
[35:42] and pour
[35:44] on that log
[35:46] if
[35:47] life dramatized like the prophet said if
[35:50] the life dramatized from that
[35:55] branch or that log then you will see it
[35:59] will be very strong
[36:02] amen
[36:03] but if the word doesn't find that seed
[36:07] inside
[36:09] then it will start softening
[36:14] because they did not keep the life
[36:17] if
[36:18] i'm standing on the sideline as the word
[36:22] is coming
[36:24] then the word will not have life
[36:28] then
[36:29] the tree of the love will become soft
[36:33] dirty very quickly so hearing the word
[36:37] and the word not finding room inside
[36:41] to dramatize to reproduce according to
[36:45] its own kind will cause that
[36:48] blog
[36:50] too right
[36:52] quickly therefore i need to make sure
[36:56] what i'm hearing
[36:57] find a room in me
[37:00] amen because it will reproduce according
[37:04] to its own kind
[37:06] the kind of the word
[37:08] the word will reproduce the word in me
[37:13] amen
[37:14] and that's
[37:16] that's
[37:17] tremendous
[37:18] praise amen
[37:22] it's christ the word in you and the hope
[37:26] of glory it will reproduce according to
[37:30] its kind which kind is it
[37:33] the word the word kind
[37:35] the word will reproduce the word in you
[37:38] hallelujah
[37:40] amen
[37:42] amen
[37:50] inductment
[37:56] 63 whatever i'm saying oh brother this
[38:00] word is life
[38:02] if you will hold to it
[38:04] look it's not something we talk about
[38:07] that may happen here and after it's
[38:10] something that's already here with us
[38:12] and happening now not something will be
[38:16] something that's
[38:17] already
[38:19] we are not testifying we know that
[38:23] what he has done
[38:25] we know that he's going to do what he's
[38:28] going to do but now
[38:29] we are telling what he is doing see
[38:33] this is our hour
[38:38] it's here
[38:40] it's happening
[38:44] it's our hour
[38:46] keep the life
[38:49] overcoming
[38:51] is doing all we can to keep the life
[38:54] but it's not us
[38:56] it's a him
[38:58] keeping his own word in us
[39:02] but the preacher has to preach it
[39:04] because god keeps his church by the
[39:08] foolishness of the gospel
[39:11] amen amen
[39:15] that's the principle that god set for us
[39:19] somebody has to keep saying this keep
[39:21] the word keep the word no matter what's
[39:23] going on in your life in your family in
[39:26] the church whatever it is keep the word
[39:30] it will reproduce according to its own
[39:33] kind
[39:35] the kind of god
[39:38] amen
[39:41] is he okay i'm screaming
[39:50] i should be more you know okay
[39:53] no ah
[39:55] let's keep the word
[39:58] it comes with principles
[40:03] it comes with christ like
[40:07] life
[40:11] and when people come
[40:13] let them find a place where they can
[40:16] grow
[40:18] and let always pray that god let me be a
[40:22] blessing for someone
[40:25] amen
[40:26] let me just be a blessing to someone
[40:32] because that's what the attributes of
[40:35] christ are
[40:38] this
[40:39] you read it many times
[40:43] so
[40:44] you say blasphemous names so therefore
[40:47] we have no strings
[40:49] nothing to join
[40:50] nothing to do but just to be a christian
[40:54] as
[40:56] e
[40:56] howard carroll
[40:58] used to say we have no law but love
[41:03] no book but the bible
[41:06] no creed
[41:08] but christ
[41:10] that's right come and visit us you know
[41:13] we are happy too
[41:15] we believe the full gospel every bit of
[41:18] the word we believe amen
[41:21] that's what we need to be
[41:23] ask god because
[41:25] the holy ghost is a gentleman
[41:29] you have to ask him
[41:31] you know
[41:32] christ is a gentleman
[41:35] you have to restrain him
[41:38] because he's
[41:39] timid the holy ghost is timid you gotta
[41:43] restrain him and say
[41:45] abide with us amen and he's the one
[41:49] giving you the desire to abide with him
[41:52] but yet he wants you to say i want you
[41:55] to abide with me and whatever you have
[41:59] for me i want it and i mean it
[42:04] amen
[42:06] yes
[42:08] therefore when we look at any situation
[42:13] we have no love but the word all right
[42:17] word
[42:18] the bible brother branham did not preach
[42:22] on the message books
[42:25] you got it
[42:27] it preached the bible
[42:30] so we cannot we should not separate
[42:32] those two things
[42:34] it's the word
[42:39] anything we do
[42:41] we should ask is it the word is it the
[42:44] word
[42:45] give it the word test to see
[42:51] amen
[42:53] is it done in love
[42:55] oh i did this because the words say that
[42:57] but it's done in love
[43:02] amen
[43:04] only you can answer that
[43:10] it is done
[43:11] as christ-like
[43:15] that's the creed you say no creed but
[43:18] christ
[43:19] is that right
[43:20] uh to me i look at it i say
[43:23] ah
[43:24] christ-like
[43:26] amen
[43:27] word
[43:29] love
[43:30] and christ like
[43:37] i'm looking at the time
[43:41] i can't see from here oh it is here
[43:45] all right
[43:46] word
[43:48] give it the word test
[43:52] let it be done
[43:55] with love
[43:58] and it has to be christ
[44:02] christ is the anointing
[44:05] the inspiration
[44:12] and when christ acted
[44:15] you will
[44:16] just see
[44:19] depending on the situation
[44:23] but you will see that what he's trying
[44:26] to always do
[44:28] christ did not come to destroy life but
[44:32] to give life
[44:36] christ
[44:37] set the record right
[44:41] when his parents came to him and said we
[44:44] were me and your father were looking for
[44:48] you with tears
[44:50] he say if i leave this
[44:53] without saying a word
[44:56] that'll be a problem
[44:58] because it will be recorded in the court
[45:02] but the prosecutors say
[45:05] this is jesus father and mother
[45:09] and the defense attorney did not object
[45:13] therefore he will stay in the court
[45:15] record
[45:18] like christ say
[45:21] i am about the my father's business
[45:25] he set the record right
[45:28] and
[45:29] it did not add anymore
[45:33] it was done with love
[45:36] according to the word
[45:38] and christ like
[45:40] has to set the record right
[45:45] and that's what we do sometimes
[45:47] sometimes we may not be understood but i
[45:51] have to set the record right if if i'm
[45:55] given the opportunity
[45:57] i gotta do it because somebody will be
[46:01] misled
[46:03] therefore it's my duty as a minister to
[46:06] make sure that the record is right when
[46:08] i'm given the opportunity
[46:15] your mother and father your mother and
[46:17] your brothers are looking for you oh
[46:21] this will stay in the court record
[46:25] who is my father who is my mother
[46:29] the one that obey to god word
[46:33] the one that received the word are my
[46:37] family
[46:39] otherwise the record will show that
[46:41] jesus family was those people
[46:47] that's right he set the record right
[46:51] amen
[46:53] with love
[46:56] by the word
[46:59] don't you want to be like that
[47:02] anything you do
[47:03] you test it with the word
[47:05] and you make sure it's done with love
[47:08] and the christ-like
[47:10] and christ
[47:12] every situation is different he
[47:14] approached it
[47:15] differently by the word
[47:21] let's call the fire from heaven to
[47:23] destroy them
[47:24] you don't know what you're talking about
[47:27] christ did not come to destroy life but
[47:30] to give life
[47:32] amen
[47:33] he set the record right
[47:38] are you with me
[47:41] yeah
[47:42] woman
[47:43] where are those who are accusing you
[47:47] oh lord i don't know they're gone
[47:50] okay i'm not condemning you too
[47:53] but it could not leave the record that
[47:55] way
[47:56] because the woman will go back
[47:59] do the same thing
[48:00] you say
[48:01] i'm not condemning you either
[48:04] but go don't do it
[48:07] the record is right now
[48:11] amen amen
[48:14] amen
[48:15] everywhere it was barbara i'm saying
[48:17] that even when he went to the pharisees
[48:21] he did not say you pharisees you're
[48:23] gonna die
[48:25] ah i don't care about you i know you
[48:27] don't believe me
[48:28] but i'm saying no he actually went after
[48:31] them
[48:33] and he helped them
[48:35] yeah it's true he did he said verbum say
[48:38] that he went and
[48:40] speak to them help them but also told
[48:43] them the truth
[48:46] you are blind
[48:50] you see that
[48:51] you see christ like
[48:54] oh you are blind
[48:58] many people have want to see what you
[49:00] see they didn't see it you see it and
[49:04] you call it belzebub and something
[49:07] you're blind
[49:09] that doesn't make me a bad brother that
[49:12] brother will
[49:13] you know is so arrogant
[49:16] you know
[49:17] it would tell you off
[49:20] no
[49:21] i'm i'm just it's christ
[49:24] christ brother brenham went to
[49:26] switzerland and uh he was in a
[49:30] breakfast lunch i think
[49:33] according to the biography
[49:35] that uh
[49:37] you know
[49:38] those preachers were telling him
[49:41] brother brother branham we almost
[49:43] believe
[49:44] in your message we want to preach it but
[49:47] we have a problem with the visions
[49:50] your vision there can you explain to us
[49:53] scientific
[49:54] scientifically
[49:58] how do you get the vision
[50:01] because we think is a witchcraft
[50:06] you know what barbara told them at some
[50:08] point he said brother
[50:11] you are blind
[50:14] oh brother does not have love how can
[50:17] you tell a brother that you are blind
[50:23] you better tell the brother with love
[50:34] i guess to you you understand this
[50:39] that's the life of christ in you when
[50:42] the word comes it comes with the word
[50:45] everything now you do by god grace you
[50:49] test it with the word
[50:51] anything you do
[50:53] how i treat people
[50:56] i treat them with love
[50:59] and it's done christ-like
[51:02] amen
[51:11] oh let's go back to where we we came
[51:13] from
[51:14] changing gears again
[51:16] matthew chapter 22
[51:19] verse 10.
[51:23] i realize there's so much to talk about
[51:27] we will just go how the lord will lead
[51:30] matthew 22 10
[51:32] so those servants
[51:35] went out into the highways
[51:37] and
[51:38] and gathered together all as many as
[51:41] they found both bad and good and the
[51:45] wedding was of
[51:46] a furnish with
[51:48] a guest this is a king who asked people
[51:52] to come to his party or to his feast and
[51:55] the people gave excuses
[51:58] so he asked his servant to go and find
[52:01] anybody
[52:02] just i want my house to be full
[52:06] and
[52:07] when the king came in to see the guest
[52:12] he saw there was there
[52:14] there a man which had no
[52:17] uh not on a wedding garment
[52:20] and he said unto him friend
[52:24] how come his doubt in in either
[52:27] not having a wedding garment and he was
[52:31] speechless
[52:33] then say the king to the servant bind
[52:36] him hand and foot and take him away and
[52:40] cast him into outer darkness there shall
[52:44] be weeping and gnashing of teeth
[52:46] for many are god but few are chosen
[52:52] amen
[52:54] so i
[52:55] wondered i thought brother branham
[52:58] never answered this question about
[53:01] how can someone
[53:04] get to heaven
[53:06] by the window
[53:10] how did he not go he did not have the
[53:12] clothes
[53:14] that the messenger of the time
[53:17] of this time
[53:19] how do you get to heaven
[53:22] actually when you look closely they did
[53:25] not
[53:26] it's an image
[53:28] all right it's someone trying to go into
[53:32] rapture through
[53:33] a back door a window it won't work
[53:44] revelation chapter
[53:46] 4 1.
[53:47] what is it the bridegroom stand at the
[53:50] door
[53:52] and all comes up with an invitation
[53:56] no man can come to the father except by
[53:58] me
[53:59] all the father has given me
[54:02] or invited
[54:04] will come to me
[54:06] by this time you know you were invited
[54:07] right
[54:08] by the shout
[54:10] amen
[54:12] here come
[54:14] if they come give their invitation the
[54:16] bridegroom so that everybody will look
[54:19] alike they all dress alike
[54:22] by the prophet
[54:24] of the end time
[54:26] amen
[54:28] there's no
[54:29] there's one thing about
[54:31] good
[54:32] all-time
[54:34] holy ghost religion it makes them all
[54:38] look alike
[54:40] yeah because they are the same body
[54:42] and they have the body is in same shape
[54:46] we heard
[54:47] amen
[54:51] whether they are rich or poor bond of
[54:54] free black white male or female they're
[54:58] all one in christ jesus
[55:01] and the bridegrooms
[55:03] stood at the door and received the
[55:06] invitation put the robe around this
[55:09] fellow so the rich and the poor are
[55:12] look alike
[55:14] that's the way it is in the kingdom of
[55:16] god there's no big guys and the little
[55:18] guys they are all one guy

[55:27] notice the bridegroom is at the door
[55:33] all right let's go let's keep going
[55:37] so the to get there you got to go
[55:39] through the door
[55:42] yes the door is jesus
[55:46] but he is the word
[55:48] amen
[55:50] let's keep reading
[55:53] now what do you think when the
[55:56] bridegroom come back and found a man
[55:59] sitting there without a wedding garment
[56:02] on say
[56:03] you call him friend
[56:04] [Music]
[56:06] he didn't call son
[56:08] daughter
[56:09] a friend
[56:11] friend how do you get in
[56:13] in here he stood speechless
[56:16] it showed that he came some other way
[56:19] beside the door
[56:22] he came in a window he came in
[56:25] a back door
[56:27] like a virus
[56:31] well only computer people got it
[56:35] and he called him a friend sure he was a
[56:39] church member
[56:41] friend how did you get in here without a
[56:44] garment on
[56:46] so
[56:47] you should have peace right
[56:49] you got the garment you got the
[56:51] invitation you responded
[56:54] you know
[56:56] and you have your clothes you are
[56:58] untitled to get there
[57:00] and you're getting from the door
[57:03] revelation of christ
[57:06] the door
[57:10] amen
[57:16] okay now jesus said this himself and he
[57:20] called to the potter and he said bind
[57:22] him foot in hand and he was cast out
[57:25] into outer darkness where there will be
[57:28] whipping welling and gnashing of teeth
[57:31] that's christ on words right he was cast
[57:34] out because it proved
[57:37] without the wedding garment it came some
[57:40] other way beside the door
[57:43] beside the revelation of jesus christ
[57:46] the word
[57:48] he tried to
[57:50] that's why he didn't get there
[57:53] because it's proved because
[57:55] without the wedding garment it comes
[57:57] some other way beside the door
[58:00] if he would have come by the door
[58:03] he would have received a wedding garment
[58:08] and you have received it yet the devil
[58:10] speak to your mind
[58:13] the devil is a enemy
[58:16] a strong enemy we have to recognize
[58:20] but not the biggest enemy
[58:23] right
[58:24] the biggest is yourself right your human
[58:27] mind
[58:29] is telling you this telling you they are
[58:31] telling you this
[58:33] what is that he want to rob you from
[58:35] that
[58:37] blessed assurance
[58:39] jesus is mine
[58:40] hallelujah
[58:44] now let me
[58:46] look at the door again
[58:49] let me look at the door revelation
[58:51] chapter 4 verse 1.
[58:54] after this i looked and behold a door
[58:57] was open in heaven
[59:02] and the first voice which i heard was
[59:05] that
[59:06] as it were a trumpet
[59:09] uh talking with me which said come up
[59:12] higher i will show the
[59:15] things which must be after
[59:19] and immediately i was in a spirit and
[59:21] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[59:24] one sat on the throne
[59:27] and either sat was to look upon like a
[59:30] jasper and sardine
[59:34] stone and there was a rainbow around
[59:37] about the throne
[59:39] in sight like
[59:41] onto an emerald
[59:45] this is very this is tremendous
[59:49] jesus in the
[59:51] book of revelation chapter one
[59:54] he introduce himself and say i am alpha
[59:59] i am omega the beginning and the end
[1:00:04] is that right
[1:00:06] which was which is which was which to
[1:00:09] come
[1:00:12] that was the introduction
[1:00:15] it was introducing divinity
[1:00:18] every denomination will tell you that's
[1:00:21] jesus
[1:00:23] when he introduced himself in revelation
[1:00:26] chapter one everyone believes that
[1:00:31] then we make another
[1:00:33] step
[1:00:34] we realize that they are not three
[1:00:37] people persons in
[1:00:40] god
[1:00:42] that is the only one you say i am the
[1:00:45] alpha and the omega
[1:00:47] and all the message believers say amen
[1:00:53] i introduce
[1:00:54] why is he introducing himself again in
[1:00:58] chapter four
[1:01:01] are you with me
[1:01:03] before you introduce himself again
[1:01:06] it brings john to go higher
[1:01:10] so as john goes higher he sees a door
[1:01:15] and there
[1:01:17] he starts describing what was going on
[1:01:21] there
[1:01:22] i will say to you john received a
[1:01:25] greater
[1:01:26] revelation of the deity of christ
[1:01:32] that door
[1:01:33] is the revelation of the deity of jesus
[1:01:37] christ but a greater revelation
[1:01:43] now he knows
[1:01:45] who actually
[1:01:48] is
[1:01:48] christ
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:58] the first revelation is the deity the
[1:02:01] supreme deity of jesus christ
[1:02:05] that said
[1:02:06] but why does he
[1:02:09] call john again and introduce himself
[1:02:13] again
[1:02:14] is giving john a greater revelation of
[1:02:18] actually
[1:02:19] the deity
[1:02:21] okay the deity
[1:02:23] was in the father
[1:02:25] the deity went in the sun
[1:02:28] but the deity has come down in human
[1:02:32] beings and that's the revelation
[1:02:37] and only through that
[1:02:39] you got into the door
[1:02:42] otherwise it is some back door
[1:02:45] but for his children they receive the
[1:02:48] fullness of that revelation about who
[1:02:52] christ is
[1:02:57] 1964.
[1:03:00] so you see the whole thing is god
[1:03:02] becoming tangible
[1:03:05] everybody believe jesus is the son of
[1:03:08] god
[1:03:09] no problem
[1:03:11] message believers believe that
[1:03:14] ah
[1:03:15] there is only one god
[1:03:18] and he's jesus
[1:03:20] the father son and holy ghost are
[1:03:22] function or attributes of the same god
[1:03:26] but we need to go
[1:03:28] a little bit higher
[1:03:31] and if we go higher
[1:03:33] we'll find that that deity
[1:03:37] broke down into small
[1:03:41] and tabernacle in people
[1:03:44] and that's what we're calling
[1:03:46] the bride coming of christ
[1:03:50] it should not puzzle us
[1:03:56] amen because it's god becoming tangible
[1:04:01] that one the great
[1:04:02] great day that
[1:04:04] to come when christ set upon the throne
[1:04:07] of david and reign in the millennium
[1:04:09] it's god tangible in the earth he is now
[1:04:13] in you
[1:04:15] not just in the millennium right now
[1:04:18] that's a greater revelation
[1:04:21] and we find at the door
[1:04:23] and to get there to the wedding supper
[1:04:26] you gotta go through the door
[1:04:28] the door is a revelation of deity
[1:04:32] in the way you did not see it before
[1:04:36] christ any human beings
[1:04:42] so it should not be something that will
[1:04:44] scare you
[1:04:46] issued something that you embrace you
[1:04:48] say that grace grace grace
[1:04:52] yes he is now in you
[1:04:56] you are his attribute
[1:04:58] you have got eternal life
[1:05:00] your life always he was
[1:05:05] and you was god thinking the color of
[1:05:08] your hair
[1:05:10] whatever you are
[1:05:12] you was god thinking you were
[1:05:15] just
[1:05:16] materialized
[1:05:18] that a great
[1:05:20] revelation of a deity
[1:05:23] and that god was when he was
[1:05:26] materialized in christ god displayed
[1:05:29] manifest in flesh in christ it became
[1:05:32] material
[1:05:34] god that he could that we could touch
[1:05:39] first timothy 3 16 without controversy
[1:05:44] great is the mystery of godness for god
[1:05:48] was manifested in in the flesh see
[1:05:52] it was god being manifested
[1:05:55] getting ready
[1:05:57] amen
[1:05:59] greater revelation
[1:06:02] amen question is the answer in 1964
[1:06:07] and god became material
[1:06:10] in a man called jesus which was his son
[1:06:14] the son gave his life that he might
[1:06:17] bring other sons that god might become
[1:06:21] tangible working in all
[1:06:24] in all
[1:06:26] in that day you will know
[1:06:29] that i am in the father the father in me
[1:06:32] i in you and you in me
[1:06:35] when
[1:06:36] that day what day today
[1:06:39] now
[1:06:44] so i use my i i just repeat what was
[1:06:48] already said
[1:06:49] but i you know
[1:06:51] i put my two cents as they say
[1:06:54] you know i use my own wordings
[1:06:56] maybe somebody's sitting on the sidewalk
[1:07:00] will say oh
[1:07:02] i never heard that oh you heard it but
[1:07:05] you didn't hear it so yeah
[1:07:08] in that day you will receive a greater
[1:07:11] revelation of
[1:07:13] christ
[1:07:14] the door
[1:07:15] through which you go to the wedding
[1:07:18] supper
[1:07:20] invitation received claws on you the
[1:07:24] door is open a great revelation of a
[1:07:27] deity that's how god does for the bride
[1:07:32] john being the bride had to go higher
[1:07:37] see that
[1:07:39] divinity
[1:07:40] made manifest
[1:07:43] amen
[1:07:44] and that's what god does is so strange
[1:07:48] that god always
[1:07:50] to give a greater revelation he has to
[1:07:53] bring you
[1:07:55] come
[1:07:56] higher
[1:07:59] it's not strange that the prophet was
[1:08:01] called on sunset mountain
[1:08:04] higher
[1:08:06] to receive a greater revelation
[1:08:14] of the deity
[1:08:17] and pass it to us
[1:08:20] so we can be sure
[1:08:22] and certain and we will be there
[1:08:25] because we are already there
[1:08:34] therefore
[1:08:36] the word that we receive
[1:08:40] is not the yea
[1:08:42] and nay
[1:08:44] it is yet
[1:08:50] amen
[1:08:53] prophet did not like
[1:08:56] ney and yay we can see here joshua he
[1:09:00] say and if if it seemed evil unto you
[1:09:04] to serve the lord choose you this day
[1:09:07] whom he will serve whether the god which
[1:09:11] your father served that we're on the
[1:09:13] other side of the flood or the gods of
[1:09:16] the amorite and whose land
[1:09:19] we he there dwell
[1:09:21] but as for me in my house we will serve
[1:09:25] the lord
[1:09:28] it's not the time
[1:09:30] to be
[1:09:31] unsure
[1:09:32] it is not the time of cloud of the
[1:09:35] denominational
[1:09:37] church age
[1:09:39] it was a day that was not the day or
[1:09:42] night
[1:09:43] but now
[1:09:45] in the evening
[1:09:46] time the sun has rise
[1:09:50] there shall be light in evening time
[1:09:54] therefore i have to be sure of my
[1:09:57] calling my election that i will be
[1:10:00] there yes
[1:10:07] first king 18 and elijah came unto all
[1:10:10] the people and say how long
[1:10:12] hard ye between two opinions if the lord
[1:10:16] be god follow him
[1:10:19] but if it's bad then follow him
[1:10:22] and the people answer him not a word
[1:10:28] being too being under two opinions is
[1:10:31] not good
[1:10:34] it is a nightmare
[1:10:38] what is the nightmare
[1:10:40] you are not awake you are not sleeping
[1:10:44] you are in a certain state
[1:10:46] active is very bad
[1:10:48] have you ever had a nightmare
[1:10:52] and god doesn't want that
[1:10:55] only satan
[1:10:57] has a position that is not clear but you
[1:11:00] and i
[1:11:01] are right now
[1:11:04] in heavenly places in jesus
[1:11:07] amen
[1:11:08] in heavenly places right now
[1:11:13] positionally
[1:11:15] placed
[1:11:17] ready
[1:11:18] for the change of our atoms
[1:11:20] nothing will stop us
[1:11:23] nothing
[1:11:25] amen
[1:11:29] only satan has a strange position and
[1:11:32] the lord said unto satan where
[1:11:35] cometh down then satan answered the lord
[1:11:38] and say from going to and fro in the
[1:11:41] earth
[1:11:43] from walking up and down
[1:11:45] what is the position of up and down
[1:11:49] what is the fraud and two
[1:11:52] and up and down well he's hiding
[1:11:54] something
[1:11:56] you know he doesn't want to say i'm up
[1:11:58] and down i'm not up and down
[1:12:01] okay
[1:12:02] i'm to and fro i'm not doing frau no
[1:12:06] i am positionally placed in jesus christ
[1:12:10] reading the manner from above drinking
[1:12:13] from the rock i am positionally placed
[1:12:17] amen there is no question about it
[1:12:21] amen
[1:12:26] things that are to be and now you are
[1:12:29] risen with him and manifested attributes
[1:12:32] of god setting in heavenly places
[1:12:35] already raised resurrected to the new
[1:12:38] life and sitting in heavenly places in
[1:12:41] christ jesus well we are already even
[1:12:43] raptured resurrected
[1:12:46] oh my that's that can get somebody dizzy
[1:12:53] oh that means so much nowadays oh church
[1:12:57] that means so much today
[1:13:01] hallelujah
[1:13:04] this means so much to us to see
[1:13:06] ourselves positionally placed in
[1:13:10] jesus christ
[1:13:13] therefore it's done
[1:13:16] now
[1:13:18] leave it to the devil so i can say
[1:13:20] where did you go
[1:13:24] to and fro
[1:13:25] where i say where
[1:13:28] to and fro that's not the position
[1:13:32] confusing
[1:13:34] now
[1:13:42] let's look at
[1:13:43] matthew 11 2.
[1:13:47] now when john had heard
[1:13:51] in the prison the works of christ
[1:13:54] he sent two of his disciples and say
[1:13:57] unto him
[1:13:59] art thou he that should come
[1:14:02] or do we
[1:14:04] look for another
[1:14:06] jesus instant said
[1:14:08] unto them
[1:14:09] go and show john
[1:14:11] again those things which he do hear and
[1:14:14] see
[1:14:18] church
[1:14:19] if you go by the principle that i just
[1:14:22] set
[1:14:24] everything every situation
[1:14:26] you gotta look at the word
[1:14:30] right
[1:14:30] you gotta be done by with love
[1:14:35] christ-like and christ-like is a
[1:14:38] is a uh
[1:14:39] a function that redeems
[1:14:42] save
[1:14:43] you know you know when you are down
[1:14:46] take you
[1:14:47] you know that's that's the position
[1:14:50] right
[1:14:51] so
[1:14:53] um you see what how is handling this
[1:14:55] situation
[1:14:57] john has come
[1:15:00] and in a public
[1:15:03] in the whole court open
[1:15:07] the judges the
[1:15:08] prosecutors the jury
[1:15:13] is declaring his question is terrible
[1:15:17] you know
[1:15:20] are you the one
[1:15:22] that uh uh are you the one or do we look
[1:15:26] for another
[1:15:30] the record shows that the prosecutor
[1:15:31] asked if jesus is the one
[1:15:35] and somebody has to object to it
[1:15:38] otherwise he will stay on the record
[1:15:41] that there was a question about his
[1:15:43] divinity
[1:15:50] well
[1:15:51] it set the record right
[1:15:53] but in a very
[1:15:55] different way
[1:15:57] it say go tell
[1:15:59] john what you see
[1:16:01] so only john
[1:16:04] will get the answer
[1:16:06] john will read between lines
[1:16:10] he will know that that's him
[1:16:13] but he will not
[1:16:15] correct john in the presence of other
[1:16:18] people
[1:16:20] because
[1:16:22] john is a prophet
[1:16:26] if you want to correct him he will be in
[1:16:29] a private
[1:16:30] today people try to correct the prophet
[1:16:34] who gave you that authority
[1:16:37] god when he correct moses it was in
[1:16:39] private
[1:16:40] let's have a private meeting
[1:16:42] moses
[1:16:45] but today people have set themselves as
[1:16:47] a prophet
[1:16:49] they will say they will say he made so
[1:16:51] many mistakes
[1:16:53] ah we need the holy ghost so the holy
[1:16:56] ghost is in you
[1:16:57] to correct the prophet mistakes
[1:17:00] who give you that authority
[1:17:04] the fear of god has disappeared from
[1:17:07] people
[1:17:09] what a position to be in to say i am
[1:17:12] going to correct the prophet
[1:17:16] now you look at jesus and say well tell
[1:17:18] john this he will understand
[1:17:20] the blind receive the sight the lamb
[1:17:23] locked the lepers are cleansed and the
[1:17:25] death here the dead are raised up and
[1:17:28] the poor have the gospel preached to
[1:17:31] them
[1:17:32] and then it through this
[1:17:35] bless he
[1:17:36] is he whosoever shall not be offended in
[1:17:40] me
[1:17:41] his faith puzzle
[1:17:44] is is
[1:17:46] questions
[1:17:47] puzzling questions in their mind
[1:17:50] as they depart jesus begin to say unto
[1:17:54] the multitude
[1:17:55] concerning john
[1:17:57] and jesus start giving a good testimony
[1:18:00] about john
[1:18:02] love
[1:18:04] the word has corrected the love of god
[1:18:08] for his people is manifested here and he
[1:18:12] does it all this christ like
[1:18:16] oh my
[1:18:18] god help me to be like that
[1:18:22] what went you
[1:18:24] out into the darkness to see
[1:18:28] really shaken with the wind
[1:18:31] now do why did i highlight this
[1:18:35] because
[1:18:36] that was the problem
[1:18:38] with my human eyes
[1:18:40] i see john as a reed
[1:18:43] shaken by wind
[1:18:45] because he is the one who said this is
[1:18:47] the lamp
[1:18:49] now he's asking questioning about it but
[1:18:52] jesus said no no no no john
[1:18:54] was not wishy-washy
[1:18:58] i
[1:18:59] no no he said he wasn't
[1:19:01] it's his human mind that was
[1:19:04] but when i look at him i still see the
[1:19:06] seed
[1:19:07] and the light
[1:19:09] on the seed is just his human mind
[1:19:12] because his eyes of an eagle is a film
[1:19:15] over film over
[1:19:18] you know the situation was so hard it
[1:19:20] has no precedent in the word that god
[1:19:25] the prophet can be on earth in prison
[1:19:28] when the messiah is on earth he could
[1:19:30] not reconcile it
[1:19:34] and he baffled him it can happen to all
[1:19:37] of us and god still see the faith in you
[1:19:41] the seed has received the light the
[1:19:44] light was received by you
[1:19:46] no matter what the
[1:19:48] your human mind is tricking you giving
[1:19:51] some tricks but overcoming is to
[1:19:55] recognize the devil in all his tricks
[1:19:59] amen
[1:20:08] and jesus gave
[1:20:11] his
[1:20:13] best
[1:20:14] testimony about john
[1:20:16] even call him they say no one no prophet
[1:20:20] like is like him
[1:20:22] oh my
[1:20:24] christ like i want to be a christ-like
[1:20:26] don't you
[1:20:29] christ-like
[1:20:30] oh my
[1:20:34] well
[1:20:35] i don't want to be sacrilegious
[1:20:37] but when i look at the situation i kind
[1:20:40] of become the
[1:20:43] jones defense lawyer
[1:20:47] you know
[1:20:48] you know john did not have you know
[1:20:51] you know he was in a prison
[1:20:54] if you have a puzzling question in your
[1:20:56] mind
[1:20:57] you go to him
[1:20:59] jesus but he was in the prison
[1:21:02] and he was not like they're gonna
[1:21:04] parole you you know that's the word
[1:21:06] right
[1:21:08] they won't
[1:21:09] give him a break from prison he has no
[1:21:12] break he's in the prison
[1:21:14] the problem is since he told his
[1:21:17] disciples two of them
[1:21:19] then the disciple came in
[1:21:22] in the middle of you know
[1:21:24] gathering and said it
[1:21:27] but let's say
[1:21:29] they had like
[1:21:31] a private email
[1:21:35] and he has sent the email to jesus
[1:21:38] i have a puzzling question
[1:21:41] we will not have all this
[1:21:43] is that right
[1:21:45] he has no way
[1:21:47] to communicate this you know i'm just
[1:21:49] sharing my mind how my mind works
[1:21:57] but the fact that everybody heard it
[1:21:59] jesus has to clean it up
[1:22:02] but yet he said
[1:22:04] john was not wishy-washy
[1:22:07] sometimes we think that when the our
[1:22:11] human mind is playing tricks on us we
[1:22:14] think it's us
[1:22:17] it never asks god when he look into us
[1:22:20] he sees his seat there
[1:22:23] and he sees that the seed has received
[1:22:25] the light and is dramatizing glowing
[1:22:29] glowing into his own kind the kind of
[1:22:34] the world
[1:22:37] for there is no condemnation for those
[1:22:39] who live in christ
[1:22:41] all right
[1:22:42] there is no condemnation
[1:22:45] thank you lord
[1:23:10] 1963
[1:23:13] you know this brother da
[1:23:17] oh i think it was from lima
[1:23:19] is that right
[1:23:20] that was from lima
[1:23:22] i was looking for a story that i heard
[1:23:24] about
[1:23:25] him
[1:23:26] in the message i could not find it but
[1:23:28] he was so old and weak and he's telling
[1:23:31] brother brandon brother brandon i'm
[1:23:32] getting old i'm getting weak 91
[1:23:36] 91 years old he said do you think i'm
[1:23:40] ready to die do you think i'm ready to
[1:23:43] go
[1:23:44] do you think i'm saved
[1:23:47] but abraham look at this man and say
[1:23:50] when this man heard the message
[1:23:53] his seed
[1:23:54] instantly
[1:23:56] received the light
[1:23:58] instantly
[1:24:00] but yet he's still asking himself
[1:24:03] am i saved by the venom but i'm saying
[1:24:06] well what the doctor will do when you go
[1:24:08] to him he will do a checkup let's do the
[1:24:11] checkup
[1:24:12] so he goes and check the word with him
[1:24:15] and by the brother
[1:24:18] say i believe it
[1:24:19] he said well the head special you say
[1:24:22] that uh
[1:24:23] you passed the test
[1:24:26] it was very simple sometimes the word is
[1:24:29] simple do you believe the word of your
[1:24:31] time you say yes
[1:24:34] you pass
[1:24:38] oh no people no it's very simple
[1:24:42] that the clothes
[1:24:44] for the wedding supper
[1:24:45] [Music]
[1:24:48] so i was looking for one time when uh i
[1:24:51] don't know if it was somebody telling me
[1:24:54] or i read it in the message it was like
[1:24:56] brother dawg when maybe the next day
[1:24:59] when brother brennan went to look for
[1:25:01] him
[1:25:02] he had his body covered with bibles
[1:25:05] anybody had
[1:25:07] seen that i don't know maybe it was a
[1:25:10] testimony covered with bible everywhere
[1:25:12] that hurt
[1:25:14] open bible
[1:25:16] the head
[1:25:17] open bible
[1:25:20] the um open bible because the word of
[1:25:22] god
[1:25:23] promised healing
[1:25:25] amen
[1:25:26] but i'm saying that
[1:25:28] what but a dog was trying to do was to
[1:25:32] quieten his human mind
[1:25:37] and sometimes that's what we do we're
[1:25:40] trying to quieten our human mind
[1:25:44] now we have all these puzzling questions
[1:25:47] we just try to do that
[1:25:51] but the salvation is certain there is no
[1:25:55] question about it any longer
[1:26:00] amen
[1:26:10] our life will always have questions
[1:26:14] some things that
[1:26:16] we just don't have the answer
[1:26:20] some days our life turned upside down
[1:26:25] sometimes you start even questioning
[1:26:27] your christianity
[1:26:31] it's not you
[1:26:33] it is your human mind
[1:26:35] playing tricks
[1:26:37] have you ever
[1:26:39] thought about sister hattie
[1:26:42] wright
[1:26:43] we call her height right
[1:26:47] her name was
[1:26:48] mosher
[1:26:50] her husband name but never called her
[1:26:54] her husband name
[1:26:55] always call her a father's name
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:01] this sister should have a puzzling
[1:27:04] question in her mind
[1:27:07] you know
[1:27:09] you get married god gives you two sons
[1:27:14] and
[1:27:15] it takes the husband
[1:27:17] living with what
[1:27:19] did she have a safety net
[1:27:24] no husband
[1:27:25] children
[1:27:27] those boys need a
[1:27:30] father they need
[1:27:34] an authority figure
[1:27:36] she could have
[1:27:39] questions
[1:27:43] but they had those questions
[1:27:45] in her mind
[1:27:47] never
[1:27:48] never had an impact on her
[1:27:50] on her spiritual life
[1:27:56] is that right
[1:27:58] but if she could come to you or to me
[1:28:00] and say
[1:28:02] look at my situation brother my husband
[1:28:05] died i have two sons to ride to raise
[1:28:09] my sister is sick my parents are i'm
[1:28:14] getting old i have to take care of them
[1:28:16] i don't know why god left me in this
[1:28:19] condition
[1:28:20] we could cry with her
[1:28:23] and we will not be wrong
[1:28:25] sister we pray with
[1:28:26] let's pray together
[1:28:28] it's a puzzling
[1:28:30] question
[1:28:31] puzzling questions and situations come
[1:28:34] to every christian
[1:28:37] you know why because we still living in
[1:28:40] the filio love
[1:28:43] now this is what brother brahm says
[1:28:46] he must be born again
[1:28:48] but without that eternal life this
[1:28:52] fellowship life it will fade away
[1:28:55] it had a beginning
[1:28:57] it will have an end
[1:28:59] but with eternal life it can no more die
[1:29:03] than eternity can itself
[1:29:06] and what is eternity a perfect sickle
[1:29:10] cycle
[1:29:11] that has no end
[1:29:13] uh just
[1:29:15] revolves it he started it laying around
[1:29:19] this way you go through the table
[1:29:21] through the floor through the earth it's
[1:29:25] a still a perfect cycle
[1:29:32] and god had no beginning or
[1:29:35] had an end and when he puts that spirit
[1:29:38] in us in this flesh
[1:29:41] that he has brought
[1:29:44] from the earth and our fellow love has
[1:29:48] become to a place that it's
[1:29:50] overrode by a gappy love
[1:29:54] that we got eternal life in this calcium
[1:29:56] and potassium
[1:29:58] that's been fed and brought from the
[1:30:00] earth and how much more can the god
[1:30:04] who made it raise it up again therefore
[1:30:08] you must be born again
[1:30:11] think about this
[1:30:12] it's so good that the word
[1:30:15] is promising us
[1:30:18] that this affiliate love that we have
[1:30:21] that make us feel the way we feel
[1:30:24] give us those puzzling questions
[1:30:27] my children are hungry
[1:30:30] i don't know how i'm gonna bring you
[1:30:32] know
[1:30:32] we're gonna pay the bills at the end of
[1:30:35] the month
[1:30:36] all these things
[1:30:38] are
[1:30:39] part of the failure
[1:30:41] but god is is saying that the world that
[1:30:44] we're carrying every day
[1:30:46] will make that feel your love being
[1:30:49] overwritten
[1:30:51] by the agape
[1:30:53] not something we do
[1:30:55] but something that comes from god
[1:30:59] that word you hear will start decreasing
[1:31:03] the feeling with the human side of
[1:31:06] things and making the agatha the god
[1:31:09] love to increase and increase and we can
[1:31:13] see what was happening with sister
[1:31:16] hattie right
[1:31:17] it was like
[1:31:18] that agape has increased so much
[1:31:23] even though she's suffering
[1:31:25] but
[1:31:26] she doesn't see it
[1:31:29] don't you want to be
[1:31:31] that place
[1:31:39] smart people have this
[1:31:41] pyramid
[1:31:45] ah
[1:31:46] we slow whatever okay
[1:31:52] now
[1:31:54] a human being need food
[1:32:00] that's the basic
[1:32:03] they need food
[1:32:05] to live
[1:32:07] they need a shelter
[1:32:10] safety net
[1:32:13] they need the social
[1:32:16] only when the bottom of the pyramid
[1:32:20] is taken care of then you can go higher
[1:32:24] is that right no wonder when harty
[1:32:27] wright said the right word
[1:32:31] brother branham told her
[1:32:33] you have basic needs
[1:32:36] you need money
[1:32:39] to buy food
[1:32:41] it's uh it's not bad to ask god for
[1:32:44] money
[1:32:45] that basic need society
[1:32:51] you need health
[1:32:55] it's not bad to ask god for good health
[1:33:04] she could even ask god for her husband
[1:33:08] why not
[1:33:12] because the children need it
[1:33:15] that was not on her mind
[1:33:18] because the
[1:33:20] feeling of love was being
[1:33:23] overwritten
[1:33:24] by the agape
[1:33:28] and it goes slowly
[1:33:30] you to have it it's not just sister hat
[1:33:33] right
[1:33:34] you made decisions in your life
[1:33:36] because of the world
[1:33:38] same thing with sister hattie right
[1:33:41] your priority was him
[1:33:44] amen
[1:33:45] therefore you acted like him maybe not
[1:33:48] her maybe you had to go to a certain job
[1:33:52] but you say it will keep you far from
[1:33:54] the church
[1:33:57] and you will not hear the word or
[1:33:59] anything that you made a decision for
[1:34:02] him
[1:34:03] you acted like her
[1:34:05] and the more we hear the word
[1:34:08] that
[1:34:10] feeling love that makes us to be
[1:34:12] earthfully bound
[1:34:15] will start decreasing so we can become a
[1:34:18] little lighter
[1:34:20] and go up there
[1:34:22] it's not something that we do is
[1:34:24] something that he does
[1:34:34] you can ask her for food it's a basic
[1:34:36] need
[1:34:37] you can ask her for this
[1:34:40] well if the prophet say that she could
[1:34:42] ask for money
[1:34:44] then it was good
[1:34:46] think about it
[1:34:48] if sister had to write
[1:34:50] ask her for money
[1:34:52] who will call her less spiritual
[1:34:57] no
[1:34:58] you see that sister that cadillac you
[1:35:00] see that
[1:35:01] their sister is a very special sister
[1:35:04] she got the cadillac with the third pool
[1:35:11] she asked god
[1:35:13] and the god dropped a couple of millions
[1:35:16] of dollars
[1:35:18] just drop this
[1:35:19] you count them they really come from the
[1:35:22] federal reserve bank
[1:35:26] real they're real because god has banks
[1:35:29] everywhere
[1:35:30] in the water everywhere
[1:35:34] pact of 20 100
[1:35:37] and we will all look at you right that
[1:35:40] the most spiritual sister in the world
[1:35:43] every visitor that comes i'm gonna show
[1:35:46] you a special system
[1:35:49] don't stare don't stay
[1:35:54] she's over there
[1:35:59] we will never think that she asked the
[1:36:01] wrong thing
[1:36:02] but he was a god doing in her
[1:36:08] if she has asked god for a husband
[1:36:12] but i'm saying i give you the husband in
[1:36:15] the name of the lord jesus christ well
[1:36:18] we all have husbands but that one
[1:36:21] the third poor husband
[1:36:25] we will still think that she's spiritual
[1:36:30] don't you
[1:36:31] absolutely
[1:36:32] it's the prophet who told us otherwise
[1:36:35] we will not know
[1:36:39] but what was happening is
[1:36:41] the word working in her therefore the
[1:36:46] the
[1:36:46] issues of life become dim
[1:36:50] they did not have met value
[1:36:54] she after she asked for the salvation of
[1:36:57] her
[1:36:58] sons she's still going through difficult
[1:37:02] times not enough money maybe not enough
[1:37:05] food the parents are old the sister is
[1:37:09] sick and brother is praying and the
[1:37:12] sister is not healed
[1:37:14] she still have all these problems
[1:37:17] but the priorities have changed
[1:37:20] and he didn't do it by himself is god
[1:37:23] doing
[1:37:33] sister hearty right
[1:37:35] had a different pyramid
[1:37:40] are you with me
[1:37:42] in this pyramid
[1:37:44] the base is the fate
[1:37:47] the basic need
[1:37:49] without them i cannot go higher
[1:37:52] is a faith in the word of god in your
[1:37:55] time
[1:37:58] she didn't do it by herself
[1:38:00] christ in her we're doing that
[1:38:03] i want this
[1:38:05] i want this
[1:38:08] don't you
[1:38:09] amen
[1:38:14] so to these all things we are saying
[1:38:17] is not an effort a human effort
[1:38:20] will power
[1:38:22] it's the word
[1:38:24] and yet is the word that the devil
[1:38:26] attacked every day
[1:38:29] your enemy attack every day
[1:38:34] your enemy is certain but it's not the
[1:38:37] greatest enemy
[1:38:38] the greatest enemy is your human mind
[1:38:42] amen but to be sure about it there's no
[1:38:46] yeah nays just yay
[1:38:59] god gave us a greater revelation of
[1:39:02] who he is
[1:39:04] and that is the door that was open in
[1:39:07] heaven
[1:39:09] we did not go by the window
[1:39:12] or the back door
[1:39:14] we
[1:39:16] went
[1:39:17] by the word of god
[1:39:19] revealing our time
[1:39:22] god
[1:39:23] and the human being god become tangible
[1:39:26] in the human being that's what we're
[1:39:29] calling the coming the bright coming of
[1:39:32] christ
[1:39:34] and you standing on here
[1:39:36] you say you are on the sideline i come
[1:39:40] to church i hear pastor chad always
[1:39:44] talking about bride and dress and
[1:39:47] you know
[1:39:48] and
[1:39:49] and it's puzzling your mind but you
[1:39:52] don't go check the word you don't give
[1:39:54] it a test
[1:39:56] a word are you sitting there i should
[1:39:58] not say anything
[1:40:01] but you're dying
[1:40:05] the word is keep coming on you every day
[1:40:09] the lord the lord will become softer
[1:40:13] it's better to address it
[1:40:15] it's better to go into conference with
[1:40:17] god
[1:40:19] it's better to check the word because
[1:40:22] you gotta be certain of your calling in
[1:40:24] a recollection
[1:40:26] sure about what you hear every day
[1:40:30] there should not be any question about
[1:40:32] it
[1:40:33] time is so late we cannot play church
[1:40:38] churchianity
[1:40:40] is over
[1:40:42] christianity by the way is the
[1:40:44] vocabulary that brother branham created
[1:40:48] is no perfect word
[1:40:51] praying church is over
[1:40:54] it's a a matter of life and death
[1:40:57] if god is god let's worship
[1:41:02] god we don't want to be found
[1:41:08] coming
[1:41:10] from the window that the denominational
[1:41:15] system
[1:41:16] it won't go the stag
[1:41:19] is a stagnant
[1:41:21] thing
[1:41:22] and stagnant water
[1:41:24] smell bad
[1:41:27] i come from africa i know what i'm
[1:41:28] talking about
[1:41:33] you see stagnant water
[1:41:35] on the street this street some streets
[1:41:37] don't have
[1:41:38] uh asphalt whatever
[1:41:41] yeah
[1:41:42] so the water
[1:41:44] becomes stagnant then you see it change
[1:41:47] color
[1:41:48] you become a little green
[1:41:50] mosquito comes
[1:41:52] frogs
[1:41:54] all kind of
[1:41:56] beings start making the dwelling there
[1:42:00] and that's how christianity is when the
[1:42:03] world doesn't find life
[1:42:08] therefore you see somebody today in 10
[1:42:11] years they have regrets
[1:42:15] but we are called to a greater
[1:42:17] revelation
[1:42:19] if we receive it as the pillar of fire
[1:42:22] is going
[1:42:23] if moving we move with it
[1:42:26] oh the bible becomes a new book
[1:42:30] christ is stopping knuckling in the
[1:42:33] human being
[1:42:36] we are not presumptuous
[1:42:38] it's a truly christ tabernacling and
[1:42:42] that's
[1:42:42] the bright coming of christ
[1:42:47] is not arrogance
[1:42:50] it's the truth
[1:42:52] said in love
[1:42:55] as christ like
[1:42:57] christ like
[1:42:59] said said
[1:43:01] christ like
[1:43:04] amen
[1:43:18] amen
[1:43:20] well i'm so i'm start going
[1:43:23] to
[1:43:25] close
[1:43:26] so your pizza will still keep
[1:43:29] hot
[1:43:32] i don't want to pick it on brother
[1:43:34] chad's office and say this brother takes
[1:43:37] long time don't put him again so
[1:43:46] sister hat is not the only one
[1:43:49] you too
[1:43:52] you have cut things
[1:43:55] that had value for you
[1:43:59] you did like her
[1:44:05] when you
[1:44:06] you stopped bringing those movies
[1:44:09] from your home
[1:44:10] you were doing like her
[1:44:17] if you get those entertainment or
[1:44:20] that music
[1:44:22] what you were doing was
[1:44:24] because of the kingdom of god
[1:44:28] i'm cutting my right hand
[1:44:31] my right
[1:44:32] arm is that what jesus said
[1:44:35] the email imagery is really
[1:44:39] graphic
[1:44:41] jesus said that if is your right hand
[1:44:44] that makes you s
[1:44:46] sin
[1:44:47] chop it off
[1:44:52] that's why i chopped off these movies
[1:44:55] and that music i chop it off
[1:45:00] oh you could
[1:45:02] cut it a little bit nicely so
[1:45:06] well
[1:45:07] it doesn't matter
[1:45:11] it's chopped anyway
[1:45:13] yeah you may be right that i can do
[1:45:16] better
[1:45:18] but if i consider it as a stumbling
[1:45:21] block
[1:45:23] the point is i cut off
[1:45:29] oh yeah
[1:45:30] if a surgeon came
[1:45:32] you could you could do this and take
[1:45:35] this part
[1:45:37] well
[1:45:38] it's still ugly
[1:45:42] that's the point
[1:45:44] the point is i'm cutting it off
[1:45:47] no matter how i do it i did cut it off
[1:45:51] because of the love of christ in me
[1:45:58] amen
[1:45:59] do you believe that
[1:46:03] did it make sense to you
[1:46:06] a puzzling question in your mind
[1:46:09] is a paralyzing question
[1:46:12] what does it paralyze
[1:46:14] your faith
[1:46:15] whatever the devil attack you in the
[1:46:18] natural or in the spiritual the purpose
[1:46:21] is to reach your soul
[1:46:24] and steal that seed from you
[1:46:28] and my duty i know you want by the word
[1:46:31] you won't do it because you are part of
[1:46:33] god
[1:46:34] but i still have to preach about it
[1:46:37] because that's the way god made things
[1:46:40] the foolishness of preaching
[1:46:44] that's what it is
[1:46:49] do you believe that
[1:46:51] okay let's stand the musician can come
[1:47:05] one day i was invited at the pentecostal
[1:47:07] church
[1:47:09] they had like a service it was like
[1:47:12] a group of
[1:47:14] they call them prayer group of prayers
[1:47:17] and charismatic
[1:47:21] and
[1:47:22] they start talking
[1:47:25] at the end
[1:47:27] they start asking questions
[1:47:29] maybe to the preacher
[1:47:32] i knew where i was
[1:47:35] was not my land
[1:47:38] i have to respect them they invite me
[1:47:42] i will be quiet
[1:47:44] i will say a word
[1:47:49] which i did
[1:47:51] but they keep talking asking questions
[1:47:54] they came to the point of asking about
[1:47:57] william branham
[1:47:59] oh here
[1:48:00] how come
[1:48:03] william brennaman they start talking
[1:48:05] about things
[1:48:07] you know penny putting me down
[1:48:11] well it was a question and answer
[1:48:14] so it was not like a preaching right
[1:48:17] so i have to speak
[1:48:20] because i have to straight the record
[1:48:22] right
[1:48:24] if i did not say something will you call
[1:48:27] it love
[1:48:30] do you understand that we have to set
[1:48:33] the record
[1:48:34] sometime we got to do it
[1:48:36] no matter how it hurts we have to
[1:48:39] you provoked me to speak
[1:48:44] so i spoke
[1:48:47] of course i taught them with love okay

[1:48:53] uh i'm sorry i'm sorry but
[1:48:59] that's how he works yeah christ's like

[1:49:09] him
[1:49:10] is that right my wife because
[1:49:13] yeah that's true she is my memory
[1:49:20] oh don't you love that
[1:49:21] when the life of christ is new
[1:49:26] you will pass anything through the test
[1:49:28] of the world
[1:49:30] you will do it in love
[1:49:32] how do i treat that brother that i
[1:49:34] disagree with or with love
[1:49:37] but it has to be christ like
[1:49:40] christ's life is not always soft
[1:49:43] it can be shame on you
[1:49:45] brother i love you shame on you doing
[1:49:48] this you know better brother
[1:49:51] it's the love
[1:49:52] amen

[1:50:01] we all have to go
[1:50:03] amen
[1:50:05] what
[1:50:09] well amen not in trying
[1:50:13] but entrusting
[1:50:17] it's not in running
[1:50:21] but in resting

[1:51:53] puzzling questions
[1:51:57] the thing that we don't understand we
[1:52:00] put them together with the word of god
[1:52:03] it sometimes doesn't make sense
[1:52:09] but the word tells us that all the
[1:52:12] things these trials and tests and things
[1:52:18] they are precious
[1:52:20] even though when we are going through
[1:52:21] them we can't can't understand
[1:52:26] but they should never

[1:52:38] this morning we just pray that
[1:52:41] you give us that overcoming power
[1:52:45] that we can
