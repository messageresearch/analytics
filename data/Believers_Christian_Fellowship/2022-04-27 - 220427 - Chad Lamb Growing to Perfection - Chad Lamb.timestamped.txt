[10:05] turn to second peter
[10:07] chapter one
[10:08] we're going to
[10:10] read through a very familiar portion of
[10:13] scripture here
[10:17] in the book of second peter
[10:19] chapter one we'll just read the first
[10:21] four verses of chapter one and then let
[10:23] you have your seats
[10:24] so begin in verse one simon peter a
[10:26] servant and an apostle of jesus christ
[10:28] to them that have obtained like precious
[10:30] faith with us through the righteousness
[10:32] of god and our savior jesus christ grace
[10:35] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[10:37] the knowledge of god and of jesus our
[10:39] lord
[10:40] according as his divine power hath given
[10:42] unto us all things that pertain unto
[10:44] life and godliness
[10:47] through the knowledge of him that hath
[10:48] called us to glory and virtue whereby
[10:51] are given unto us the exceeding great
[10:53] and precious promises that by these you
[10:55] might be partakers of the divine nature
[10:58] having escaped the corruption that is in
[11:00] the world through lust amen god bless
[11:02] you as you take your seats
[11:04] may god bless us as we look at his word
[11:08] amen i want to take a look at the
[11:10] subject of growing into perfection and i
[11:12] really want to look at the statue of a
[11:14] perfect man and just go through a few
[11:16] things in that this evening before that
[11:18] i'd like to make an announcement um i've
[11:21] been
[11:22] working on trying to get brother abraham
[11:25] moses myra over for a visit
[11:27] and it looks like he'll be able to make
[11:29] it we don't have a confirmation for sure
[11:31] he went to the embassy this week and
[11:34] they signaled to him that he would get a
[11:36] visa so that he could come but he won't
[11:38] know for sure
[11:39] i think until may 6 when he goes to pick
[11:41] up his visa
[11:43] for his passport so we're just going to
[11:45] go ahead and move forward with faith
[11:46] that the brother will be coming so i've
[11:48] scheduled special meetings for may 20th
[11:50] 21st and 22nd that's a friday saturday
[11:54] and sunday so our services with brother
[11:56] abraham friday night saturday night and
[11:58] then sunday morning so i'm very much
[12:01] looking forward to that so if you could
[12:02] just be in prayer that everything will
[12:04] go through with this visa and we can we
[12:06] have to start making travel arrangements
[12:08] already so we'll start making those
[12:09] travel arrangements and ask god to take
[12:12] care of all of it amen
[12:14] so i'm very much looking forward to
[12:15] having our brother back again and very
[12:17] much looking forward to services with
[12:19] brother abraham
[12:21] also i've scheduled a kids service we
[12:23] haven't had a kids service since the

[12:51] your parents are welcome to come too but
[12:52] they got to sit a little further back
[12:54] other family members can come too but
[12:56] they can still further back so we'll
[12:57] have a kids service
[12:59] on uh i'm sorry i said march may 15th
[13:03] sorry
[13:04] you guys have to love me
[13:06] because god said you had to and you have
[13:08] to forgive me even
[13:10] 49 times whatever times or how many
[13:13] times bunch of times anyways
[13:15] may 15th so may 15th here in about three
[13:18] weeks we'll have a kids service so i'm
[13:20] looking forward to that we haven't done
[13:21] that in a while and we've got a lot of
[13:23] young children that have never been in
[13:24] the kids service so praise god we're
[13:27] looking forward to that
[13:28] also i wanted to just share a testimony
[13:30] real quick
[13:32] i came sunday and i preached this
[13:34] service on uh our guide and we were just
[13:36] talking about the message a guide and
[13:38] god had laid that on my heart really
[13:40] heavy and i just knew traveling home
[13:42] like i said i knew what to preach and i
[13:44] preached it and it was wonderful we had
[13:45] a good time on sunday and then monday i
[13:48] decided to listen to brother ben's
[13:50] service so i listened to brother ben's
[13:51] service monday and then tuesday i
[13:53] listened to brother kyle's service and i
[13:55] thought well praise god amen
[13:58] god is good and so i was talking to kyle
[14:00] yesterday and i i told him i called him
[14:03] after i listened to a service i said hey
[14:04] i just finished your service
[14:06] he said you just watched it
[14:08] i said yeah he says
[14:10] i was sure you watched it before
[14:13] and i said no and so it was just
[14:15] astounding it was astounding to me that
[14:17] the theme that god had these brothers in
[14:19] that he had brother been in and he had
[14:20] brother caroline i haven't yet watched
[14:22] brother
[14:23] knowles service yet but after those two
[14:25] services i was it was just jaw-dropping
[14:27] and i just wanted to mention it because
[14:29] these things happen all the time and i
[14:31] don't want to miss what god is doing
[14:33] when he works so supernatural like that
[14:36] when there's no communication i didn't
[14:37] know what they preached i didn't hear
[14:38] the services and when you see god drop
[14:41] into the same channel the same exact
[14:43] direction the same channel then i think
[14:46] our our ears should be tuned in like
[14:48] never before we should finally tune them
[14:50] in and concentrate and say god is
[14:52] speaking to us in a supernatural way and
[14:55] i want to hear what he has to say so i
[14:57] was very blessed by that and i
[15:00] and when i got done
[15:02] watching the services i said thank god i
[15:04] didn't watch those before
[15:06] it ruined sunday amen so it was a
[15:08] tremendous testimony we know that god
[15:10] does that we've seen him do it many
[15:12] times but i just wanted to point that
[15:14] out because i want to appreciate god for
[15:15] what he does
[15:17] i want to say thank you and when he does
[15:18] it in such a way like that we all know
[15:20] that it has nothing to do with a human
[15:22] being no human being can do that this is
[15:24] not about the men this is not about the
[15:27] gifts uh in the in the human being this
[15:29] is about god who knows what he wants to
[15:31] say and how to say it he can give
[15:34] inspiration and give direction and and i
[15:36] just i'm thrilled i'm so thankful to god
[15:38] for that and we want that every service
[15:41] amen
[15:42] so let's come with expectation and look
[15:44] to god to feed his sheep amen
[15:47] now if we look into this subject god
[15:48] laid this on my heart it's not
[15:50] unfamiliar this is something that we've
[15:52] been through many times it's very
[15:53] familiar to all of us who know the
[15:55] message but god laid it on my heart to
[15:57] go through again and we always have
[15:58] people coming up and new ones coming in
[16:01] and we just want to understand what god
[16:03] has for us and really we want to
[16:04] understand our life amen and the journey
[16:07] we're on and what god is doing with each
[16:09] one of us and so let's go back here to
[16:11] second peter chapter one again
[16:14] second peter chapter one
[16:16] verse four let's begin in verse four
[16:19] it says whereby are given unto us
[16:21] exceeding great and precious promises
[16:23] that by these you might be partakers of
[16:25] the divine nature having escaped the
[16:27] corruption that is in the world through
[16:29] lust
[16:30] and beside this giving all diligence add
[16:32] to your faith virtue and divert your
[16:34] knowledge into knowledge temperance and
[16:37] to temperance patience into patience
[16:39] godliness and degalling this brotherly
[16:41] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[16:43] charity for if these things be in you
[16:45] and abound they make you that you shall
[16:47] neither be barren
[16:49] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[16:50] lord jesus christ but he that lacketh
[16:53] these things as blind and cannot see
[16:55] afar off and hath forgotten that he was
[16:57] purged from his old sins
[16:59] wherefore the rather brethren give
[17:00] diligence to make your calling and
[17:02] election sure for if you do these things
[17:05] you shall never fall for so an entrance
[17:07] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[17:09] into the everlasting kingdom of our lord
[17:12] and savior jesus christ
[17:14] so we know that these uh we we typically
[17:18] call these the seven virtues that we're
[17:20] going through here in second peter and
[17:22] he says add to your faith uh virtue and
[17:25] to virtue knowledge under knowledge
[17:27] temperance unto temperance patience and
[17:28] the patience godliness god in his
[17:30] brother the kindness and the brother the
[17:32] kindness charity or love charity is the
[17:35] word agape it's love and we know that
[17:38] this is the divine nature so god's
[17:40] allowed us to be partakers of the divine
[17:42] nature which is the very nature of god
[17:44] which was the nature that was in christ
[17:46] and these are the seven virtues of that
[17:48] and so brother branham is going to go
[17:50] through this here in the messy stature
[17:52] of a perfect man and i'm going to be
[17:54] quoting quite a bit from statue of a
[17:55] perfect man and blasphemous names and he
[17:58] says now in building the virtue building
[18:00] this monument building this stature see
[18:02] it starts off with the foundation stone
[18:05] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[18:07] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[18:10] now what does it do then they're waiting
[18:12] for the headstone which is love for god
[18:15] is love so what is the headstone of all
[18:18] of this it's god
[18:20] what is charity god it's love and god is
[18:23] love so the capping off of this uh of of
[18:26] this stature of a perfect man is god
[18:29] amen so it's important to know we'll
[18:31] come back to them
[18:32] and he controls and he is the strength
[18:34] of every one of these things all the
[18:36] virtues that's right yes sir
[18:40] right in here right in here you see i
[18:42] got in between all these works in here
[18:44] and there these little waves come what
[18:46] is that the holy ghost coming down
[18:48] through christ the holy spirit the holy
[18:50] spirit is above all this welding this
[18:52] together building a what a perfect
[18:55] church for the capstone to cap it off
[18:58] what is it what is been done again it's
[19:01] manifested through seven church ages and
[19:03] seven church messengers started back
[19:05] here where was the church first founded
[19:07] there was the pentecostal church first
[19:09] founded by saint paul at ephesus the
[19:11] star of the ephesian church age ephesus
[19:14] the second church was smyrna virtue
[19:16] irenaeus the great man who held up the
[19:18] gospel of paul the next church age was
[19:20] pergamus who was martin martin was the
[19:22] great man who stayed
[19:24] paul irenaeus martin then in thyatira
[19:26] came columba you remember here it is
[19:29] drawn out right here columba after
[19:31] columba the dark ages come in there then
[19:33] comes sardis which means dead luther
[19:36] hallelujah what then what come next
[19:37] after sardis luther then come
[19:39] philadelphia godliness wesley holiness
[19:42] the just shall live by faith said luther
[19:44] sanctification through wesley
[19:46] then came in brotherly kindness through
[19:48] the laodicea and we believe the great
[19:50] message of the second appearing of
[19:51] elijah and the last day shall sweep the
[19:53] land
[19:55] here you are seven church ages seven
[19:57] steps god building his church is like
[20:00] one person into an individual into
[20:03] himself
[20:04] so now this is showing how god through
[20:06] seven church ages has been building his
[20:08] church and he's been building them
[20:10] through the through the seven church
[20:11] ages using the the seven church age
[20:13] messengers to bring the light of each
[20:15] age and he's been building them up and
[20:17] he types them with the virtues faith
[20:19] virtue
[20:21] knowledge temperance all of these things
[20:24] but he says he's building them like one
[20:26] person so the way he builds his church
[20:28] is the way he builds his individual so
[20:30] when we see what god has done through
[20:31] seven church ages we recognize that's
[20:33] the way he's building the individual as
[20:35] well
[20:36] and he's building the church amen god is
[20:39] building his church like one individual
[20:41] because the church altogether is his
[20:43] bride so it's like he's building an
[20:45] individual unit
[20:47] into himself so what is he building this
[20:50] church into and to himself she is going
[20:53] to be a reflection of him amen she's
[20:55] going to be in his very image when he's
[20:58] done with this great picture
[21:01] and then he goes on to say the glory the
[21:02] power of god coming down through this
[21:04] welding it together therefore the
[21:06] pentecostal people that let out the
[21:07] lutheran let out the wesleyans and
[21:09] things doesn't know what they're talking
[21:11] about what he means by let out is saying
[21:13] they're not included in this because
[21:15] they didn't believe all of this and he
[21:16] says they don't even know what they're
[21:18] talking about amen
[21:20] he says
[21:20] you see they lived in this part of the
[21:23] temple that's the way some people can
[21:25] come up that high and drop off but
[21:27] there's a genuine part of that that
[21:28] keeps making that building come on i
[21:31] will restore saith the lord you remember
[21:33] the bride tree you remember the sermon
[21:34] on the bride tree they eat it down but
[21:36] he pruned him they got denominational
[21:38] branches he pruned them off they raised
[21:40] up another church denominational
[21:42] branches he pruned it off but the heart
[21:44] of that tree kept growing and in the
[21:46] evening time it shall be light that's
[21:48] when come christ the holy spirit jesus
[21:51] comes down and sets himself at the head
[21:53] of the church then and he will resurrect
[21:56] this church being his own body
[21:59] in there is the body
[22:02] and the way god is expecting us is
[22:04] individual to grow the way he has
[22:07] brought his church in to grow every
[22:09] church age it becomes one big church
[22:13] amen
[22:14] so brother frank if we can bring up the
[22:15] overhead i'm going to draw this out on
[22:17] the whiteboard and and i want to spend a
[22:19] little time
[22:20] looking at this
[22:22] and
[22:25] i'll work on that let's go to romans
[22:27] chapter 8.
[22:43] romans chapter 8
[22:46] and we'll read verse 14.
[22:50] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[22:52] god they are the sons of god for you
[22:54] have not received the spirit of bondage
[22:56] again to fear but you have received the
[22:57] spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba
[23:00] father
[23:01] the spirit itself bearing witness with
[23:03] our spirit that we are the children of
[23:05] god now keep this scripture in your mind
[23:08] we're going to come back to this but
[23:09] first i'm going to draw
[23:11] this little picture here
[23:18] so when brother branham be a couple
[23:20] weeks before he comes to this sermon
[23:22] he he says
[23:24] that he he's going to preach well after
[23:26] he preaches this sermon he looks back at
[23:28] this sermon when he comes to the end of
[23:30] 1962 and into 1963 and calls this his
[23:33] pyramid message
[23:35] so brother ram titles this is pyramid
[23:37] message and when he he's he's a week out
[23:40] before this service and before this
[23:41] service he says next sunday he goes i
[23:44] want to preach on the capping of the
[23:46] pyramid so when he preaches the stature
[23:48] of a perfect man he's preaching on the
[23:50] capping of the pyramid that's what he
[23:52] says beforehand so it's very interesting
[23:54] when you get to look at this he's
[23:56] preaching on the capping of the period
[23:58] which we know the capstone is christ the
[23:59] capstone is god the capstone is love
[24:02] amen and and so
[24:04] then he's going to talk about when he
[24:06] looks back he calls us his pyramid
[24:08] message amen and when what's amazing
[24:11] about that is he's preaching all of this
[24:13] before he knows about junior jackson's
[24:15] dream of the pyramid amen
[24:17] he preaches all of this this is going to
[24:19] be uh the the capping of the pyramid
[24:22] message he preaches that before he has
[24:25] the vision of the constellation of
[24:27] angels in a pyramid form because that
[24:29] comes later
[24:30] so it's amazing to me that god is so
[24:33] directing brother branham to bring this
[24:35] message at this time so we could
[24:37] understand how he's been building a
[24:38] bride because he's coming to the capping
[24:40] time to cap it off with himself amen
[24:44] with love and so that the church would
[24:46] understand what's been happening through
[24:48] the church ages and what's been going on
[24:51] so we know that he builds this
[24:55] through seven
[24:56] church ages
[25:07] i think that's seven one two three four
[25:10] five six seven good
[25:11] so we have
[25:13] seven ages
[25:16] and we have seven virtues
[25:20] and then the capping
[25:23] is the eighth
[25:25] which is
[25:26] love
[25:28] just called charity same word
[25:31] which is god
[25:34] or christ
[25:36] himself
[25:37] and that will complete
[25:39] this this picture of a perfect church
[25:43] so
[25:44] there
[25:46] well i'm going to read this quote and
[25:47] then there's something else i want to
[25:48] get into okay blasphemous names 1962 is
[25:51] now when
[25:52] when jesus had been
[25:54] obedient
[25:55] jesus to god god placed him
[25:57] positionally this is him now when the
[26:00] member is born by the holy ghost and to
[26:02] the family of god and has proven that
[26:03] these virtues are in him that god can
[26:06] see virtue knowledge temperance patience
[26:08] brotherly kindness and godliness in him
[26:10] then god seals him or places him and
[26:13] there that's when you see the sons and
[26:15] daughters of god so brother branham when
[26:17] he's preaching on statue of a perfect
[26:19] man and blasphemous names he uses some
[26:22] language that's confusing and it's calls
[26:24] quite a bit of confusion and there's and
[26:26] there's different teachings on the
[26:27] statue of a perfect man and i just want
[26:29] to go into that and just share with you
[26:31] what i see and the way i see it in the
[26:33] message amen and knowing that god is
[26:35] still perfecting our understanding so
[26:37] the way we see it can be tweaked amen we
[26:39] can understand it better by and by but
[26:42] because brother bannon begins to talk
[26:44] about this building of the statue of a
[26:46] perfect man and as you add to faith to
[26:48] virtue and build your way up amen and
[26:50] then finally god caps it with the holy
[26:52] ghost and seals it with the holy ghost
[26:54] and you're sealed into the kingdom and
[26:56] because brother branham's using this
[26:58] terminology amen
[27:00] from and he uses it mainly in 1962 for
[27:03] the most part when he's preaching these
[27:05] messages because he uses this
[27:07] terminology amen people start separating
[27:10] being born again and baptized with the
[27:12] holy ghost
[27:14] and so they they begin to teach because
[27:16] brother ben says comments like this in
[27:18] this message he says you know you're
[27:20] born again and then you grow up and then
[27:22] you're sealed by the holy ghost after
[27:24] all these virtues are in you and so
[27:26] because he says that amen there's some
[27:28] that that see that and teach that you're
[27:31] born again at the bottom then you grow
[27:33] all the way up and then you're sealed by
[27:35] the baptism of the holy ghost amen but
[27:38] that's not the way i see it i don't
[27:40] believe it that way but i see why people
[27:42] say that because of the things brother
[27:43] ben i'm saying so i hope as we go on
[27:45] today that we can clear this up and
[27:47] paint the picture in a way in the way
[27:49] that i see it and i'll read this quote
[27:52] again because this quote says
[27:54] god can see virtue knowledge temperance
[27:56] patience brotherly kindness and
[27:58] godliness in him then god seals him or
[28:01] places him and really brother branham
[28:04] you know back in 1960 he preaches on
[28:06] adoption and when he comes the statue of
[28:09] a perfect man in blasphemies names he's
[28:11] actually preaching adoption again he's
[28:12] showing this is bringing us into
[28:14] adoption this is adoption which is a
[28:16] placing of a son
[28:18] and so he says now god seals him or
[28:21] places him so you can see the
[28:23] terminologies god brother is using by
[28:25] sealing he's also typing it with placing
[28:29] but the first sentence i read in this he
[28:30] says now when jesus had been obedient
[28:33] jesus to god god placed him positionally
[28:36] this is him
[28:38] well jesus was already a son amen jesus
[28:41] was a son and god saw that he would have
[28:44] been obedient and god was positionally
[28:46] placing him so when brother brahm's
[28:48] talking about this capping off her
[28:49] ceiling it's it's it's in reference to
[28:52] adoption and reference to a placing or
[28:54] positioning a son
[28:56] amen that's what brother branham did to
[28:58] the age that's why he started preaching
[29:00] on the statue of a perfect man he's
[29:01] showing there's been seven church ages
[29:03] but at the end of the seven church ages
[29:05] there's a capping off and the capping
[29:07] off is when christ himself comes to
[29:09] unite with the body
[29:11] and what's he doing is he's positionally
[29:13] placing the bride
[29:14] he's saying you're not down here and
[29:16] you're not down here you're not down
[29:17] here but you're come all the way up to
[29:20] adoption and now amen he's showing that
[29:23] the bride is moving into adoption amen
[29:25] where she amen is so like the father
[29:28] she's so like him that christ and and
[29:31] her unite together and now she can speak
[29:34] for him
[29:35] amen
[29:37] so let's look at this scripture again
[29:40] in romans chapter 8.
[29:44] and let's look at verse 15
[29:46] for you have not received the spirit of
[29:47] bondage again to fear but you have to
[29:49] receive the spirit of adoption whereby
[29:52] you cry abba father
[29:54] so you received the spirit and it was
[29:56] the spirit of adoption
[29:58] amen adoption brother brahm teaches us
[30:01] that biblical adoption is not like
[30:04] what we use the term adoption for now
[30:06] you have somebody who needs a home
[30:07] they're not your child you adopt them
[30:09] into your family and make them your
[30:10] child that's not this adoption that
[30:12] brother banh is talking about the
[30:14] adoption he's talking about is when a
[30:16] son is born to his father amen his
[30:18] father amen will watch his son build
[30:21] character in the sun before he places
[30:23] him in the family business or over the
[30:25] family farm and the placing of the sun
[30:27] in a position of of authority is
[30:30] adoption
[30:31] so adoption is placing of a mature sun
[30:35] so when a son comes to maturity where he
[30:37] can be trusted with responsibility in
[30:40] the father's kingdom then he is placed
[30:42] or he is adopted
[30:44] so this is what brother branham's
[30:45] talking about
[30:47] so so what spirit do we receive we
[30:49] receive the spirit of adoption
[30:52] so what does the spirit of adoption do
[30:54] the spirit of adoption brings you into
[30:56] the fullness of adoption so it's the
[30:58] holy ghost all the way through from the
[31:00] beginning to the end it's the spirit of
[31:03] adoption that brings you into the
[31:05] adoption
[31:09] now i want to make i want to make this
[31:11] really clear so that you understand what
[31:14] i'm saying and then i want to go back
[31:15] and and and diagram this maybe in the
[31:18] church age book
[31:20] brother branham gets to the smyrna
[31:21] church age and he said now comes our
[31:23] triumphal capstone on the baptism of the
[31:26] holy ghost
[31:27] so he's going to describe his teaching
[31:30] on the baptism of the holy ghost he says
[31:32] there it is jesus christ came forth died
[31:35] upon the cross and accomplished
[31:37] redemption restoring to original owner
[31:39] by means of purchase or paying the price
[31:42] and thereby placed us as sons he did not
[31:45] make us sons for we were already his
[31:47] sons but he placed us as sons for as
[31:50] long as we're in the world in the flesh
[31:52] we could not be recognized as his sons
[31:55] we were held captive by the devil but we
[31:57] were sons nonetheless
[31:59] and hear this and because you are sons
[32:02] god has sent forth the spirit of his son
[32:04] into your hearts whereby you cry father
[32:06] father upon whom did the spirit fall at
[32:08] pentecost sons at corinth upon sons
[32:12] while they heard the word what is the
[32:15] baptism with the holy ghost it is the
[32:17] spirit baptizing you into the body of
[32:20] christ it is the new birth
[32:23] so what is the baptism of the holy ghost
[32:24] it is the new birth so you can't
[32:26] separate these two things out they are
[32:28] one and the same
[32:30] it is the spirit of god coming in you
[32:32] and feeling you after you have repented
[32:34] having heard his word and been baptized
[32:36] in water as an answer of a good
[32:38] conscience towards god
[32:40] further down in the same passage in the
[32:42] church age book he says to begin with
[32:44] you will notice that in my meetings when
[32:47] i have finished preaching in an
[32:48] evangelistic service or some teaching
[32:50] message i cast a net and invite a
[32:52] response from the people i ask them to
[32:55] come forward and receive the holy spirit
[32:57] my pentecostal friends upon hearing me
[32:59] say this believe that i'm inviting
[33:01] people to come forward to be baptized
[33:04] with the holy ghost because they are
[33:05] already born again
[33:08] so when i invite those who are
[33:09] spirit-filled to come and deal with
[33:11] those who have answered the invitation
[33:13] to receive the spirit
[33:14] these dear ones search forward and deal
[33:16] with the people in such a manner as to
[33:18] encourage them to yield to god and
[33:20] believe to speak in tongues
[33:22] this has caused a great deal of
[33:24] confusion and i want you to
[33:26] i i want to tell you exactly what i mean
[33:29] do you want to know what brother means
[33:31] exactly he's going to tell us exactly
[33:33] what he means
[33:35] i mean for the sinner to come forward
[33:37] and be born again
[33:39] which is to be baptized into the body of
[33:41] christ by the holy ghost which is
[33:44] exactly what took place at pentecost
[33:46] when the church was launched in other
[33:48] words to be born of the spirit is to be
[33:50] truly baptized with the holy ghost
[33:52] it is one and the same
[33:55] so when brother brown comes through the
[33:56] church age book brother branham now he's
[33:59] editing the church age book into 1963
[34:02] and into 1964
[34:04] after the seals and when brother
[34:05] branham's editing the church age book
[34:07] he's got time to read back over cross
[34:09] out make changes and get his doctrine
[34:12] exactly the way he believes it amen so
[34:15] he clarifies doctrine in the church age
[34:17] book and when brother brahm clarifies
[34:19] his doctrine he does not separate the
[34:21] new birth and then you go through these
[34:23] virtues and you come to the baptism of
[34:25] the holy ghost but he says the baptism
[34:27] of the holy ghost and the new birth are
[34:29] the same thing
[34:31] it is one and the same so so we we must
[34:35] uh remember that that brother man made
[34:37] it so clear amen that there's there's no
[34:39] confusion on what he taught but when you
[34:42] go back and read in 1962 statue of a
[34:45] perfect man in blasphemous names there's
[34:47] things that he says amen where he's
[34:48] separating the two out and and i don't
[34:51] believe brother branham is changing his
[34:53] doctrine
[34:55] sometimes it you know we get confused it
[34:57] looks like brother branham is changing
[34:59] his doctrine you know
[35:00] but he's not sometimes he changes his
[35:02] terminology but he doesn't change his
[35:04] doctrine
[35:06] brother graham said i've taught the same
[35:07] thing all the way through
[35:09] and i'll give you an example of this
[35:11] amen and in case you're waiting for me
[35:13] to preach i'm preaching now we're doing
[35:15] a teaching tonight
[35:17] so hang with me and respond because i
[35:19] want to take my time so that we
[35:20] understand these things
[35:22] amen we know that teaching will
[35:24] establish the believer and we need to be
[35:26] established to have understanding
[35:29] so brother bam he we know if you know
[35:32] and study the message you know through
[35:33] the 50s and early 60s brother branham
[35:36] taught that you were three three
[35:38] uh you're a three-part being and your
[35:40] outer man was your body the inner realm
[35:42] the emotional realm next to that was
[35:44] your spirit and the inside of the inside
[35:46] was the soul
[35:47] but when he comes into 1961 and 1962 he
[35:52] changes some of those terms
[35:54] and he says the outside man is the body
[35:56] the inside emotional realm is the soul
[35:59] amen in the inside of the inside he says
[36:01] is the spirit
[36:03] so
[36:03] it caused a great deal of confusion and
[36:06] there's been a great deal of argument
[36:08] and people have struggled with what is
[36:10] soul and what is spirit and all of these
[36:11] other things and for me when i began to
[36:14] look at it i said well there's an easy
[36:16] way to solve this equation
[36:18] let's do away with all terminology
[36:21] let's just say the outside part is a
[36:25] the the emotional realm
[36:27] amen is b
[36:29] and the soul the inside of the inside is
[36:31] c
[36:32] a b c
[36:33] all right
[36:35] if you just take it a b c
[36:37] and you let it be a b c all the way
[36:39] through the message brother branham's
[36:40] teaching never changes
[36:43] what he says the outer realm does never
[36:45] changes what he says the next realm does
[36:47] never changes and what he says is the
[36:49] true you down on the inside where the c
[36:51] gene is amen never changes the inside of
[36:54] the inside is the true you and the outer
[36:56] two realms are fallen part of a hybrid
[36:58] nature and he never changes his teaching
[37:01] whatsoever the only thing he changed was
[37:03] terminology
[37:06] so so it's it becomes simple when you
[37:09] push the terminology to the side and
[37:12] says what is he teaching the teaching
[37:14] never changed only the terminology
[37:17] changed
[37:18] okay
[37:19] so now when we get into this subject
[37:21] let's do the same thing that brother
[37:24] man's not changing his doctrine amen the
[37:26] the the new birth is the baptism of the
[37:28] holy ghost the baptism holy ghost is the
[37:30] new birth
[37:32] all right but brother branham showing
[37:34] that there's something that takes place
[37:35] at the new birth amen that begins a
[37:38] process a process of growth amen and
[37:41] that growth now brings us to another
[37:43] work of the holy ghost which is a
[37:45] positional placing of a mature believer
[37:48] amen and that teaching never changes
[37:50] throughout his ministry no matter what
[37:52] terminology he puts to that
[37:54] so don't worry about the terminology
[37:56] look at the teaching what's the
[37:57] substance that's being teached and the
[37:59] substance never changes only the
[38:02] terminology so don't get confused
[38:04] brother branham's a man he said i have a
[38:06] seventh grade education he said i don't
[38:08] have language enough to explain these
[38:09] things
[38:11] but let's go below the terminology to
[38:14] the doctrine
[38:16] to the t and you'll find that his
[38:17] teaching doesn't change
[38:19] only the terminology
[38:23] so
[38:25] brother brahm says in blasphemous names
[38:27] you cannot join the church of the living
[38:29] god you're born into it by the baptism
[38:32] of the holy ghost so right here in
[38:34] blasphemius names he says it correctly
[38:37] he says it though i don't mean correctly
[38:38] like he says it correctly or incorrectly
[38:40] that i didn't mean it that way but he
[38:42] says it the same way he says it
[38:43] everywhere else in the message
[38:45] he says you're born into it by the
[38:46] baptism of the holy ghost and when
[38:48] you're baptized with the holy ghost
[38:49] these virtues are sealed in you by the
[38:51] holy ghost and therefore he that's born
[38:53] of god does not commit sin he cannot
[38:55] there you are so brother branham he uses
[38:58] the terminology the same way he was
[39:00] everywhere else even though in the same
[39:01] message it looks like he separates it so
[39:04] now the question is is he is he
[39:07] fluctuating on his doctrine in the same
[39:08] sermon
[39:10] no we want to understand what he's
[39:12] teaching and we understand what he's
[39:14] teaching all of a sudden everything he
[39:16] says makes sense
[39:17] [Music]
[39:20] praise god let's look at ephesians
[39:21] chapter 1.
[39:22] i want to really look at this in the
[39:24] scripture too because it brings a great
[39:26] deal of
[39:26] clarity to the subject so that we know
[39:30] in romans 8 you received the spirit of
[39:32] adoption
[39:33] so what does the spirit of adoption come
[39:36] for
[39:37] to bring you into adoption
[39:40] so when you receive the spirit you
[39:42] receive the spirit of adoption amen
[39:44] there's not two holy spirits
[39:47] there's one holy spirit when you receive
[39:49] the holy spirit it's the spirit of
[39:50] adoption and the spirit of adoption will
[39:53] bring you into adoption which is the
[39:55] working of the holy ghost
[39:57] amen so now let's look at ephesians
[39:59] chapter 1 verse 3.
[40:03] blessed be the father or blessed be the
[40:06] god and father of our lord jesus christ
[40:08] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[40:10] blessings in heavenly places in christ
[40:12] according as he hath chosen us in him
[40:14] before the foundation of the world that
[40:17] we should be holy and without blame
[40:18] before him in love having predestinated
[40:21] us unto the adoption of children by
[40:23] jesus christ to himself according to the
[40:25] good pleasure of his will
[40:28] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[40:30] wherein he hath made us accepted
[40:32] in the beloved
[40:34] i want to look at verse 5 having
[40:36] predestinated us unto the adoption
[40:39] you mean the adoption is not by chance
[40:43] the adoption is not i hope i make it
[40:45] the adoption is not efforts amen
[40:48] because it sounds like it brother
[40:49] branham says he says and the scripture
[40:52] says you know add to your faith virtue
[40:55] and add to your virtue knowledge and add
[40:57] this and add this and it's as if you're
[41:00] climbing this ladder to get to christ
[41:04] but but it's the spirit of adoption
[41:07] that's in you that's moving you up the
[41:08] ladder
[41:09] it's the spirit of adoption that you've
[41:11] received that is bringing you into the
[41:13] fullness of adoption or maturing you
[41:15] into a mature believer so that god can
[41:18] place you into a work in his kingdom
[41:20] amen that's what the spirit of adoption
[41:22] is doing it's not you climbing anything
[41:24] it's not you doing anything it's the
[41:26] spirit picking you up and moving you
[41:28] into adoption
[41:30] which you were predestinated to
[41:34] you're not it's not if i'm a good boy
[41:37] and if i work really hard and if i if i
[41:39] do everything right then i can finally
[41:41] come to this goal of adoption you were
[41:43] predestinated unto adoption you'll never
[41:46] come to adoption unless you were
[41:47] predestinated unto adoption and if
[41:49] you're predestinated into adoption
[41:51] you'll receive the spirit of adoption
[41:54] which will bring you into adoption and
[41:56] what is adoption placing of a son
[42:00] when is the son placed when he comes to
[42:02] maturity when he's full-grown
[42:04] we'll talk about all these terms
[42:07] i so want to go through this because i
[42:09] find that there's so much confusion even
[42:12] about our own lives amen and the devil
[42:14] brings confusion and other teachings
[42:16] bring confusion amen but praise god amen
[42:20] we were predestinated unto adoption
[42:24] and we've received the spirit of
[42:26] adoption
[42:27] praise be to god
[42:29] without that there's no way
[42:33] now
[42:34] for me personally
[42:36] if you come down here
[42:39] and you make this
[42:40] the new birth
[42:47] and you make this the baptism
[42:53] of the holy ghost
[42:56] and you have to
[42:58] work your way to the holy ghost
[43:01] and you have to have faith and then
[43:04] after you have faith and brother branham
[43:06] said you can't get above the rung he
[43:08] said so many people try to jump to the
[43:09] top and they fall off and bust their
[43:11] heads he said you've got to go to faith
[43:13] and then add to faith virtue and add to
[43:15] virtue knowledge and add to that
[43:16] temperance and add to add to ada until
[43:19] you get all the way up to the capstone
[43:21] which is christ and then you can be
[43:23] sealed until the day of redemption
[43:26] you know if i have to make this climb
[43:29] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[43:31] i'm never going to make it to the top
[43:33] i'm not going to get my first foot on
[43:34] the first rung of the ladder it's an
[43:36] impossibility amen that teaching is the
[43:39] most discouraging teaching i've ever
[43:41] heard in my life
[43:42] that in order for you to come to the
[43:44] ceiling to guarantee the baptism of the
[43:46] holy ghost which guarantees you to the
[43:48] day of redemption you've got to come
[43:50] amen after a confession you've got to
[43:53] begin to work through faith and then
[43:55] through virtue and then through
[43:56] knowledge and you don't have the holy
[43:58] ghost all ready to do it
[44:02] i say oh god there's no way you'll never
[44:04] make it you keep failing and falling
[44:06] down but i'm so glad that brother
[44:08] branham come along and he says these two
[44:11] are the same thing amen right here i
[44:14] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[44:16] the spirit of adoption and now when i
[44:18] need to go to faith amen the holy ghost
[44:20] quickens faith to me and when i need to
[44:22] move the virtue the holy ghost gives
[44:23] holy ghost virtue to me and when i move
[44:26] into knowledge the holy ghost gives
[44:28] scriptural knowledge unto me it's not me
[44:30] doing amen it's me yielding amen to the
[44:33] tudor who's bringing me into adoption
[44:36] [Music]
[44:37] praise be to god
[44:40] so let's keep going
[44:44] in the message and thy seed shall
[44:45] possess the gate of his enemy from 1962
[44:48] it says now there are a lot of times
[44:50] where many of us pentecostals has made a
[44:51] mistake i think well the holy ghost is
[44:54] poured out on me glory to god that's all
[44:56] i have to have
[44:57] no sir you're just then getting started
[45:01] so the holy ghost isn't the finish line
[45:03] the holy ghost is the starting line
[45:07] so you can't separate these out and make
[45:09] the holy ghost the finish line the holy
[45:11] ghost is the starting line
[45:14] you're just then getting started it you
[45:17] it's not then it's your test and your
[45:19] trial
[45:21] just like we find in the old testament
[45:23] testing's trying and then placing a sun
[45:26] adoption placing the sun after he's
[45:29] already a son
[45:32] been born into the family he's a son
[45:34] then he would be tested and tried and
[45:36] raised up by tutors and see how he comes
[45:39] out and then he's placed positionally
[45:41] equal almost to his father
[45:45] so
[45:46] brother ben is now showing
[45:48] that he
[45:50] down here
[45:54] already knows
[45:56] that he's a
[45:58] son right here he knows he's a son
[46:03] but that son cannot be put into position
[46:06] to work for the father or work in the
[46:08] kingdom until he's gone through a
[46:09] maturing process where he can handle the
[46:12] responsibility amen but he's never going
[46:15] to be cast out as a son he's never going
[46:17] to be disqualified as a son he will
[46:20] always be a son because he come from his
[46:22] father's genes
[46:24] amen and so now when he's born he's born
[46:27] a son amen and he grows up into adoption
[46:31] but he knows all along that he's the son
[46:35] so if he fails in his trials and his
[46:38] testings amen he comes to the he's
[46:40] working his way up and let's just use
[46:42] this uh
[46:44] imagery he's working his way learning
[46:46] his lessons and he's learning from the
[46:47] tutor but he fails he fails a lesson and
[46:50] he falls the furthest he can fall is
[46:53] back to being a son of god
[46:59] the furthest he can drop in his failure
[47:03] is to be a son of god
[47:06] brother benham said god he didn't come
[47:08] to make you a son you've always been
[47:10] sons but by the baptism of the holy
[47:11] ghost you woke up to the fact that
[47:13] you're a sign you come to yourself you
[47:15] realize that you're part of the genes of
[47:17] god amen you recognize who your father
[47:20] is and you recognize where you came from
[47:22] amen and so you've woke up to the fact
[47:25] that you're a son of god and no matter
[47:27] how many trials you fail and how far you
[47:30] fall off of this ladder and how big the
[47:32] bump is at the bottom the furthest you
[47:35] can go is to being a son of god
[47:39] praise be to god and i believe without
[47:41] that revelation you'll have no heart to
[47:44] even begin this journey to maturity
[47:47] because this journey to maturity is full
[47:49] of testings full of trials full of
[47:51] successes and full of failures because
[47:54] that's how we learn amen the the when
[47:56] when brother branham types this adoption
[47:59] he teaches it as a as a man who has a
[48:01] household and has a farm and has an
[48:03] estate and he's got all these things
[48:05] going on in his estate and he's got a
[48:07] son born from his loins it's his son and
[48:10] he wants this son to come to a place
[48:12] where he can take part in the business
[48:13] and maybe take over it someday so he
[48:16] finds the very best tutor that he can
[48:18] get the son and brother branham tells us
[48:19] that tutor is the holy ghost
[48:22] and he turns the son over to the tutor
[48:25] and the tutor begins to give him lessons
[48:29] you know
[48:30] have you ever been in school
[48:33] and had lessons
[48:34] they weren't all easy
[48:37] and you didn't pass them all
[48:39] but that was the point
[48:42] to learn
[48:43] the point listen the point in the trials
[48:46] and the testings that god sends our way
[48:48] is not for us to never fail
[48:52] that's never been the point
[48:54] the point has always been to learn
[48:56] and to mature
[48:58] so now with these testings and these
[49:01] trials and these difficulties if you
[49:03] stumble if you fall if you fail amen
[49:06] there's a revelation that i'm always a
[49:08] son i've always been a son he'll never
[49:11] cast me away as a son i am a son of god
[49:14] he is my father
[49:16] amen and with i say without that
[49:18] revelation who has heart enough to try
[49:21] to mature into christ
[49:24] only if you believe you've been
[49:25] predestinated unto adoption
[49:29] now it goes on to say hearing
[49:31] blasphemous names
[49:33] he says do you remember over in the book
[49:35] of matthew the 17th chapter
[49:37] the first and the fifth verse jesus on
[49:39] mount transfiguration you
[49:42] you've heard
[49:43] hear you've heard hear ye him that's the
[49:45] message brother branham preached the
[49:47] sermon i just hear about a year ago
[49:48] preached become so popular hear ye him
[49:51] the placing of a son
[49:53] in ephesians 1 5 god has predestinated
[49:55] us unto adoption of sons see a family
[49:58] when a son is born into it it's a sun
[50:01] then
[50:02] you got that it's a sun at your new
[50:04] birth you're a sun then because you've
[50:06] always been a son you just recognize
[50:08] you're a son
[50:09] but that son had tutors to raise it and
[50:11] that that son never did come to be the
[50:13] right kind of son he never became heir
[50:16] but if he was the right son and the son
[50:17] that obeyed his father then that son was
[50:20] adopted or placed positionally he'd
[50:22] become heir of what the father had
[50:25] and that's what god was doing on mount
[50:27] transfiguration
[50:29] when he took his own son after he had
[50:31] been proved to be the right son and had
[50:34] stood all temptations he took him up on
[50:36] mount transfiguration and overshadowed
[50:38] him
[50:39] so brother
[50:40] brother bam showing us that jesus
[50:42] becomes our example in this adoption
[50:44] work
[50:45] so jesus is the example when he's been
[50:47] proven to be the right son
[50:49] did did jesus face trials did he face
[50:52] testings that the pharisees testing the
[50:54] describes testing amen he was tested on
[50:57] every account he was tested and he was
[50:59] tried he had testings of all kinds and
[51:02] when he was proved to be the right kind
[51:03] of son he stood all temptations he took
[51:06] him up on mount transfiguration and
[51:08] overshadowed him what was he doing he
[51:09] was bringing jesus to adoption
[51:13] you know in the old testament they took
[51:14] a son dressed him in a nice pretty
[51:16] garment and set him out before the
[51:18] public and they had a ceremony of
[51:19] placing or we call it adopting in
[51:22] galatians there i kind of think paul
[51:23] refers to it as adopting sons
[51:25] now but placing us on ministers who
[51:28] understand spiritual bible readers of
[51:29] placing the sun in other words the son
[51:32] was a son when he was born
[51:34] there is where our pentecostal people
[51:36] made their mistake being born into the
[51:38] family by the holy ghost that's right
[51:40] but then we must be the right kind of
[51:42] children tutored by the right tutor see
[51:45] now if a man back in the old age thought
[51:47] of his son he wanted him to be a right
[51:49] kind of a son he got the best tutor he
[51:51] could find the best teacher because he
[51:53] wanted his son to come up to be like his
[51:55] daddy
[51:58] so why have we been given the tutor of
[51:59] the holy ghost
[52:01] to become like our daddy
[52:04] so when when we have the spirit of
[52:06] adoption
[52:07] that's bringing us into our
[52:09] predestinated place of adoption
[52:11] the the adoption is to bring us into a
[52:14] place where we'll be like our daddy
[52:19] so he got the right tutor now if a man
[52:22] on earth would think of the best tutor
[52:24] how about god our father now he never
[52:26] got bishops and cardinals and priests he
[52:28] got the holy ghost to be our tutor and
[52:30] the holy spirit
[52:32] is our teacher
[52:35] so i want to look at jesus because he
[52:37] becomes our example here let's turn in
[52:40] our bibles to matthew chapter 3.
[52:55] matthew chapter 3.
[53:00] and verse 16.
[53:03] and jesus when he was baptized went up
[53:06] straightway out of the water and lo the
[53:08] heavens were open unto him and he saw
[53:10] the spirit of god descending like a dove
[53:12] and lighting upon him and lo a voice
[53:14] from heaven saying this is my beloved
[53:16] son in whom i am well pleased
[53:19] so here when jesus is brought to jordan
[53:22] to be baptized of john amen brother
[53:24] branham shows us typing our baptism with
[53:26] the holy ghost and he comes now
[53:29] to jordan at the appointed time and now
[53:32] the holy ghost descends upon him like a
[53:34] dove and lights upon him and a voice
[53:36] from heaven saying this is my beloved
[53:38] son in whom i'm well pleased but brother
[53:40] branham does not make this his adoption
[53:43] brother branham points to mount
[53:45] transfiguration as his adoption because
[53:47] from this point he's led of the spirit
[53:50] the tudor into the wilderness to be
[53:52] tempted of the devil because he's got to
[53:54] be tested and tried to prove that he's
[53:57] the right kind of son before he can take
[53:59] the authority that comes with maturity
[54:03] so we're not calling jesus immature at
[54:05] this stage we're just showing the type
[54:06] that brother branham used amen he
[54:08] doesn't make this his adoption amen he
[54:11] makes this his receiving the holy ghost
[54:13] and he makes mount transfiguration his
[54:15] adoption
[54:17] so the question is where did the holy
[54:19] ghost come
[54:20] right here amen the holy ghost came
[54:22] right here at this point at the
[54:25] beginning of his ministry and birthed
[54:27] him into the ministry and when he was
[54:29] birthed then into the ministry he went
[54:31] through testings and trials but then he
[54:33] comes to mount transfiguration and
[54:35] brother branham calls that adoption
[54:37] so he says this is
[54:39] this is my beloved son in whom i am well
[54:41] pleased let's go to matthew 17.
[54:44] we'll go to mount transfiguration now
[54:51] mount transfiguration matthew 17 verse 1
[54:56] and after six days jesus taketh peter
[54:58] james and john his brother and bringeth
[55:00] them up into a high mountain apart and
[55:02] was transfigured before them and his
[55:04] face did shine as the sun and his
[55:06] raiment was white as light and behold
[55:08] there appeared unto them moses and elias
[55:10] talking with him then answered peter and
[55:12] said unto jesus lord it is good for us
[55:15] to be here if thou wilt let us make here
[55:18] three tabernacles one for thee one for
[55:20] moses and one for elias
[55:22] while he yet spake behold a bright cloud
[55:24] overshadowed them and behold a voice out
[55:27] of the cloud which saith this is my
[55:29] beloved son in whom i am well pleased
[55:31] hear ye him
[55:34] so he repeats the same phrase amen from
[55:37] jordan he repeats this is
[55:40] this is my beloved son in whom i am well
[55:42] pleased then he adds the phrase hear ye
[55:45] him now he's speaking for me now he's
[55:50] taking adoption now he's taking the
[55:52] father's place
[55:54] with the same authority hear ye him so
[55:57] brother branham uses this to type
[56:00] amen our journey
[56:02] so when we look at this we see jesus
[56:10] jesus
[56:12] at jordan
[56:17] and that mount transfiguration
[56:25] all right
[56:26] at jordan
[56:28] there was a pillar of fire
[56:31] all right
[56:38] i meant transfiguration there was a
[56:39] cloud
[56:42] which one was the holy ghost
[56:47] both
[56:50] when you have the bride
[56:54] you have pentecost
[56:58] and you have
[56:59] mount sunset
[57:02] at pentecost you had the pillar of fire
[57:08] at mount sunset you had the cloud
[57:10] [Music]
[57:12] which one was the holy ghost
[57:15] the holy ghost come on the day of
[57:16] pentecost and birth the church amen
[57:19] but brother branham says he's been
[57:20] building that church over seven church
[57:22] ages to bring the church into adoption
[57:24] but when it come adoption time amen came
[57:27] in the capstone came down in the form of
[57:29] a cloud there was a pillar fire and
[57:31] there was a cloud and brother branham
[57:32] said the holy ghost amen the holy ghost
[57:35] has been bound by these denominational
[57:37] rivers for nearly two thousand years but
[57:39] is loose in the evening time by the
[57:40] losing time message the holy ghost back
[57:43] in the church again
[57:46] but what do you mean back in the church
[57:47] again brother branham showed us that at
[57:50] the beginning at pentecost amen the
[57:52] pillar of fire the holy ghost came into
[57:54] the people and birthed the bride amen
[57:57] but then grew through seven church ages
[57:59] through trials and testings and
[58:00] successes and failures grew to an
[58:02] understanding to a knowledge to a level
[58:05] of maturity amen where the holy ghost
[58:07] would cap now this great pyramid through
[58:10] these seven church ages and say
[58:14] speak
[58:16] because she will be the final voice to
[58:18] the final age amen she in revelations 10
[58:22] 8-11 she eats the book amen john eats
[58:24] the book and prophesies again and so now
[58:27] at the capping off he's saying hear ye
[58:30] him now hear you him in her amen
[58:34] so
[58:35] even brother branham
[58:42] even brother branham
[58:47] he has
[58:48] ohio river
[58:52] and mount sunset
[58:55] here he has a pillar of fire
[59:01] and here he has a cloud
[59:04] which one was the holy ghost
[59:06] which one was christ
[59:08] which one wasn't
[59:11] is it you see
[59:13] god is just establishing and confirming
[59:15] establishing and confirming amen you
[59:18] can't say over here he had one thing and
[59:20] over here he got something different no
[59:21] it's the same thing amen god is building
[59:24] a ministry and capping it off god is
[59:25] building a bride and capping it off god
[59:28] is displaying his son and capping it off
[59:30] and bringing it to adoption amen you
[59:32] can't say down here this wasn't the holy
[59:34] ghost it was the holy ghost you can't
[59:36] say over here it's not the holy ghost it
[59:37] is the holy ghost and everything in
[59:40] between is the holy ghost
[59:42] brother branham said it's been the holy
[59:44] ghost all the way through seven church
[59:46] ages
[59:47] it was the holy ghost that brought amen
[59:50] the messengers the revelations of the
[59:51] messenger it was the holy ghost that
[59:52] brought the people the revelation of the
[59:54] word and built them up it was the holy
[59:56] ghost in the beginning it was the holy
[59:57] ghost as a tudor all the way through and
[59:59] it's the holy ghost capping it at the
[1:00:01] end
[1:00:02] amen
[1:00:04] brother brahma goes it says in
[1:00:06] the message you must be born again from
[1:00:08] 1961 he said born christians grow into
[1:00:11] the stature of christ as they live
[1:00:14] they're born again their lives begin to
[1:00:16] shape like a baby it takes form and
[1:00:18] begins to grow first thing you know
[1:00:20] there here they are in full stature
[1:00:23] further down he says but
[1:00:24] be borne of the spirit and grow into the
[1:00:27] stature of christ you see it brother dao
[1:00:30] growing into the statue of christ
[1:00:31] through your life proves like if you
[1:00:33] were born to prophet you'll remain that
[1:00:35] if you were born a christian you'll
[1:00:37] remain that if you abide in me and my
[1:00:38] words abide in you this grows you up
[1:00:41] into the stature of christ
[1:00:43] so now you're born of the spirit receive
[1:00:46] the spirit of adoption but you're
[1:00:48] predestinated to grow into adoption so
[1:00:51] now that holy ghost is your tutor is
[1:00:53] bringing you as the individual the same
[1:00:55] path he brought the church ages bringing
[1:00:58] you into adoption so that he can do what
[1:01:00] the same thing he did at the end of the
[1:01:02] church ages cap you off amen and cap you
[1:01:05] off with charity with love with the holy
[1:01:07] ghost to seal you as a unit amen and
[1:01:10] give you a position in the kingdom where
[1:01:13] now you can speak the word and now you
[1:01:16] can be part of christ displaying christ
[1:01:20] let's look at galatians chapter four
[1:01:22] i probably should have read this
[1:01:23] scripture earlier but
[1:01:25] we'll get to it now galatians chapter 4
[1:01:28] verse 1.
[1:01:35] galatians chapter 4 and verse 1.
[1:01:38] says now i say that the heir as long as
[1:01:40] he is a child differs nothing from a
[1:01:41] servant though he be lord of all but is
[1:01:44] under tutors and governors unto the time
[1:01:45] appointed to the father even so we when
[1:01:48] we were children were in bondage under
[1:01:50] the elements of the world
[1:01:52] but when the fullness of the time was
[1:01:54] come god sent forth his son made of a
[1:01:56] woman made under the law to redeem them
[1:01:59] that were under the law that we might
[1:02:01] receive the adoption of sons
[1:02:03] and because you are sons god has sent
[1:02:06] forth the spirit of his son into your
[1:02:08] hearts crying abba father
[1:02:10] wherefore thou art no more a servant but
[1:02:13] a son and if a son than an heir of god
[1:02:16] through christ
[1:02:18] so because you are a son
[1:02:21] he sent you the spirit of his son
[1:02:23] which is the spirit of adoption
[1:02:26] to bring you into adoption to place you
[1:02:28] as a son to make you a joint heir of all
[1:02:30] things and part of the kingdom work
[1:02:34] now if you're a son you are ordained to
[1:02:37] make it
[1:02:39] you are ordained to adopt and in this
[1:02:42] age you are ordained to full adoption
[1:02:44] you're not ordained to stop where luther
[1:02:46] stopped
[1:02:48] and luther's day he could only go so far
[1:02:51] amen in wesley's day he could only go so
[1:02:53] far but that's not this day
[1:02:55] this day we're to grow into the full
[1:02:57] stature of the stature of jesus christ
[1:02:59] amen but when we look at this
[1:03:09] okay
[1:03:13] when we begin to grow
[1:03:15] we're born again here
[1:03:18] we begin to grow
[1:03:19] into maturity
[1:03:21] not be good to grow into a christian
[1:03:24] not begin to grow into a sun
[1:03:26] but growing into
[1:03:28] maturity and that process
[1:03:31] amen is bringing us into adoption
[1:03:34] adoption is placing and he doesn't place
[1:03:37] until we come to maturity
[1:03:40] so how fast we come to maturity
[1:03:43] sometimes is dependent on us
[1:03:46] you're ordained unto adoption
[1:03:48] you're predestinated unto adoption you
[1:03:50] receive the spirit of adoption but as
[1:03:52] long as we keep fooling around and not
[1:03:54] learning our lessons and playing around
[1:03:56] and skipping out on class and
[1:03:58] you understand the analogy as long as we
[1:04:01] we're just fooling around with the world
[1:04:03] and playing around you're ordained to
[1:04:05] get there but you're you're just killing
[1:04:07] a lot of time and you're kicking around
[1:04:09] a bunch and the tutor and the father are
[1:04:11] going to have to make sure that there's
[1:04:13] some other kind of trials they meant to
[1:04:15] get your attention focused back on what
[1:04:17] you are predestinated to because you're
[1:04:19] predestinated to adoption
[1:04:21] and i say if we've been born again by
[1:04:23] the spirit of god and receive the spirit
[1:04:25] of adoption let's recognize that we've
[1:04:27] been ordained into adoption to come into
[1:04:30] the stature of christ and let's quit
[1:04:31] fooling around with the world and
[1:04:33] wasting time but let's get serious and
[1:04:35] say god i want to be everything you've
[1:04:37] called me to be in this life i want
[1:04:39] every virtue working in me i want faith
[1:04:42] i want virtue i want i want knowledge
[1:04:44] and temperance and all of that working
[1:04:46] in me because i want to be a display of
[1:04:48] you in this world
[1:04:51] if we know what our purpose is
[1:04:53] if we know what's happened to us in our
[1:04:55] new birth brother man said the
[1:04:57] pentecostals got it wrong they thought i
[1:04:59] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:05:00] that's all i need that's not why he gave
[1:05:03] you the baptism of the holy ghost he
[1:05:04] gave you the spirit of adoption to bring
[1:05:06] you into adoption not to give you the
[1:05:08] spirit of adoption so you can go out and
[1:05:10] play with your buddies and go fishing
[1:05:12] down on the bank of the river
[1:05:14] brother branham said i could go fish
[1:05:16] every day of my life and be just as
[1:05:17] saved as i am now
[1:05:20] would you have lost his sonship no he
[1:05:22] can't lose his sonship he can't lose
[1:05:25] amen to see gene of god but what he's
[1:05:27] doing is wasting time not fulfilling his
[1:05:30] purpose he can never lose his position
[1:05:32] as a son but god had ordained him into
[1:05:35] adoption and so the tutor was bringing
[1:05:37] him into his position
[1:05:41] so it helps to know what we're here for
[1:05:44] it helps to know what god's doing in our
[1:05:46] lives
[1:05:48] why the trial
[1:05:49] without this kind of understanding that
[1:05:51] the prophet gave us then our life is
[1:05:54] just a bunch of difficult circumstances
[1:05:56] string together amen we can't wait to
[1:05:58] get out of here i just want to die and
[1:06:00] go to the sixth dimension because we
[1:06:01] don't understand what god is doing the
[1:06:04] father wants to bring us into a position
[1:06:06] amen he wants to place us in the
[1:06:09] inheritance in the kingdom and he wants
[1:06:11] us to speak like he would speak on this
[1:06:13] earth
[1:06:14] he wants us to lay hands on the sick and
[1:06:16] pray for them he wants us to speak he
[1:06:18] wants us to share the word he wants us
[1:06:20] to give the revelation he wants us to
[1:06:22] prophesy again
[1:06:25] he wants us to speak
[1:06:28] but if you don't know what's going on
[1:06:30] you say well i believe the message i
[1:06:32] receive the baptism the holy ghost
[1:06:33] praise god and then the rest of our life
[1:06:36] is a is
[1:06:37] is aimless
[1:06:39] the rest of our life is confusion the
[1:06:41] rest of our life we have good days and
[1:06:43] then we have bad days and we don't
[1:06:44] understand the bad days but we thank god
[1:06:46] for the good days and we always pray for
[1:06:48] another good day and then something bad
[1:06:50] happens and we're like why is all this
[1:06:51] bad stuff happening to me because we
[1:06:53] don't realize that you've been ordained
[1:06:56] predestinated unto adoption you've been
[1:06:59] predestined to have every virtue of
[1:07:01] christ flowing in your life and flowing
[1:07:03] out from you and he's got to put it to
[1:07:05] the test so that you learn the lesson so
[1:07:07] that he can draw out the virtue
[1:07:10] and without this teaching our life
[1:07:13] becomes just
[1:07:14] life
[1:07:17] just
[1:07:17] routine broke up by a few highlights and
[1:07:20] some difficult things we cry sometimes
[1:07:22] and we laugh sometimes and not in the
[1:07:24] understanding that god wants a people on
[1:07:27] this earth that'll speak like he speaks
[1:07:28] act like he lacks be whatever he is she
[1:07:32] will be him amen this is the age of
[1:07:35] adoption and he has brought the church
[1:07:36] unto adoption under this ministry
[1:07:40] now as individuals he wants us to come
[1:07:42] to the same place
[1:07:45] but we have to know what's going on
[1:07:48] what did he save me for why did i
[1:07:51] receive the holy ghost what was my
[1:07:52] experience with him even about
[1:07:57] it's because he wants another messiah on
[1:07:59] this earth
[1:08:00] he wants a god
[1:08:03] what does he want you to be the tudor is
[1:08:05] trying to get you to be like your father
[1:08:07] your father's god the tudor's trying to
[1:08:09] get you to act like a god he's trying to
[1:08:12] get you to be a messiah he's trying to
[1:08:14] get you to represent christ upon the
[1:08:15] earth amen and without that
[1:08:17] understanding we're just confused but
[1:08:19] with that understanding you say i get it
[1:08:21] i understand here's a trial he's testing
[1:08:24] me so that he can give me more
[1:08:26] responsibility so i'm going to pass this
[1:08:28] test what does the word say how do i
[1:08:30] overcome how do i conquer this in my
[1:08:32] life how do i get over this complex how
[1:08:34] do i get healed how do i overcome this
[1:08:38] not just
[1:08:39] you know grit my teeth and bear it till
[1:08:41] it's over with and hope it's over with
[1:08:42] soon but no i god is testing me amen
[1:08:46] when brother branham begins to talk
[1:08:47] about in the in the mess the adoption
[1:08:49] messages he says when the holy ghost
[1:08:51] gives a report back to the father he
[1:08:53] said oh father he's just like you he
[1:08:55] handles the sheep just the way you
[1:08:57] handle them amen when this circumstance
[1:08:59] happened he did it just like you would
[1:09:02] do it
[1:09:03] well how would god handle any situation
[1:09:06] god would handle every situation by his
[1:09:08] word
[1:09:10] every situation he's ever had he handled
[1:09:12] by the word he's solved by the word he
[1:09:14] conquered by the word and what is he
[1:09:16] looking for his son to do he's looking
[1:09:18] for a son to start acting like him
[1:09:21] so what does he want us to do he wants
[1:09:23] us to recognize that this trial is not
[1:09:26] for my destruction this this testing is
[1:09:30] not for my annoyance amen this is a test
[1:09:33] oh
[1:09:35] what was that equation
[1:09:37] we went over that before on sunday when
[1:09:40] the preacher was preaching he talked
[1:09:41] about this what was that scripture he
[1:09:43] used
[1:09:45] that's it i got it i'm applying it and
[1:09:47] i'm overcoming and i pass the test
[1:09:53] praise god
[1:09:58] he says in the message hear ye him from
[1:10:00] 1960
[1:10:02] god also here was doing what he we call
[1:10:04] on in the bible the placing of a son
[1:10:07] now in the old testament when a child
[1:10:08] was born a son and a home then that son
[1:10:12] was a son as soon as he was born
[1:10:14] of course he was the son of the father
[1:10:17] but yet before he felt heir to the
[1:10:18] kingdom of his father or the possession
[1:10:21] the the first that son had to be raised
[1:10:23] and tried he had to find out whether his
[1:10:25] son was a true son or was he just simply
[1:10:27] a roused about
[1:10:29] and this son would never be heir if he
[1:10:31] wasn't qualified to take his father's
[1:10:33] place but he was qualified and took the
[1:10:35] father's place then all that the father
[1:10:36] had was given to his son
[1:10:39] there's where i think that many of us
[1:10:40] pentecostal people has made a mistake we
[1:10:43] think as soon as we become sons and
[1:10:44] daughters of god that settles it
[1:10:47] we just come into the place of trying
[1:10:50] the method is said as soon as they
[1:10:52] shouted that settled it the lutherans
[1:10:53] believed by faith on justification
[1:10:55] though it settled it no matter what kind
[1:10:58] of position god puts you in you're still
[1:11:00] growing going on towards perfection and
[1:11:03] we will never reach it until jesus comes
[1:11:09] see when we take the analogy of the of
[1:11:11] the of the man over his estate trying to
[1:11:14] raise up a son who could he could turn a
[1:11:16] responsibility over to when that son
[1:11:18] comes a full age he becomes an adult 18
[1:11:20] 20 23 24 whatever it is and the tutor
[1:11:24] declares that he's learned his lessons
[1:11:25] he can handle responsibility and his
[1:11:27] father puts him over some portion of the
[1:11:30] estate amen the father did not expect
[1:11:33] that this son will never learn anything
[1:11:35] else and grow in virtue one drop from
[1:11:37] here on
[1:11:38] out so we should never expect the same
[1:11:41] thing we shouldn't be waiting till we
[1:11:43] come to some kind of form of our own
[1:11:45] idea of perfection before we get busy
[1:11:47] about the father's business god is
[1:11:49] looking for maturity not perfection the
[1:11:52] way we understand perfection
[1:11:54] he's looking for us to come to a level
[1:11:56] of maturity where we can handle
[1:11:58] something that he puts in our hands to
[1:11:59] do and then we'll go do it but that's
[1:12:01] not the end of our growing in virtue
[1:12:03] amen this young man who starts to work
[1:12:05] in the father's estate as he works he's
[1:12:08] going to labor and work and he's going
[1:12:10] to have more trials and more testings
[1:12:12] and he's going to learn more virtue
[1:12:14] he's going to gain an experience and
[1:12:16] gain an understanding just because the
[1:12:18] father brought him to adoption didn't
[1:12:20] mean he was done growing
[1:12:23] it just means he came to a level of
[1:12:25] maturity he can use him
[1:12:29] god is not we're not waiting till i'm
[1:12:31] done growing my goodness
[1:12:34] before i can do something before god can
[1:12:36] really use me i i got a lot more rough
[1:12:38] edges more we all got rough edges to
[1:12:40] knock off we all got lessons to learn
[1:12:43] but can we come to a level of maturity
[1:12:45] by the word to where we can say you know
[1:12:47] what i may be only 18 and i haven't
[1:12:49] learned everything yet but i know enough
[1:12:51] i can do something for the kingdom of
[1:12:52] god
[1:12:54] i know enough i've got the message i
[1:12:55] mean i've grown up in it god has taught
[1:12:57] me lesson after lesson after lesson i'm
[1:12:59] not going to keep waiting and waiting
[1:13:01] and waiting if god gives me something to
[1:13:03] do i'm going to do it with all of my
[1:13:05] heart amen
[1:13:07] not waiting for there's no more learning
[1:13:09] not waiting till i come to perfection
[1:13:10] and every virtue my goodness you're
[1:13:12] going to be waiting for a glorified body
[1:13:15] and you're going to be you're going to
[1:13:17] be in your theophany body before you
[1:13:19] ever do anything for the kingdom of god
[1:13:22] but i say god
[1:13:24] help me lord
[1:13:26] help us come to that place of maturity
[1:13:29] where you can use us
[1:13:32] and the stature of a perfect man he says
[1:13:34] then the word come from here manifest
[1:13:36] itself through each one of these beings
[1:13:38] and makes this complete being a
[1:13:40] tabernacle of the living god a walking
[1:13:42] living example of christianity
[1:13:44] where christ was these people are
[1:13:46] because his life is in there they are
[1:13:48] they are in christ and their life is
[1:13:51] dead and hid in christ through god and
[1:13:53] sealed in there by the holy ghost
[1:13:55] first corinthians 12 that's right you
[1:13:57] reckon yourself dead then you're born of
[1:13:59] faith then virtue and these other things
[1:14:00] is added to you till you're a perfect
[1:14:03] living image of god
[1:14:06] let's look at this in ephesians chapter
[1:14:08] 4.
[1:14:11] ephesians chapter 4 verse 11.
[1:14:24] and he gave some apostles and some
[1:14:26] prophets and some evangelists and some
[1:14:28] pastors and teachers
[1:14:30] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[1:14:32] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:14:34] the body of christ
[1:14:36] edifying means building up so through
[1:14:38] seven church ages he's used a five full
[1:14:40] ministry to build up this body
[1:14:44] and
[1:14:45] for the edifying of the body of christ
[1:14:47] till we all come in the unity of faith
[1:14:49] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[1:14:51] unto a perfect man
[1:14:53] so what is this ministry doing bringing
[1:14:56] us to a perfect man
[1:14:58] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:14:59] fullness of christ
[1:15:01] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:15:03] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:15:05] every wind of doctrine by the slight of
[1:15:07] men and the cunning craftiness whereby
[1:15:09] they lie and wait to deceive
[1:15:11] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[1:15:13] up unto him in all things which is the
[1:15:15] head even christ from whom the whole
[1:15:17] body fitly joined together and compacted
[1:15:19] by that which every joint supplyeth
[1:15:22] according to the factual working and the
[1:15:23] measure of every part making increase of
[1:15:26] the body into the edifying of itself in
[1:15:28] love
[1:15:30] so this fightful ministry is to bring
[1:15:32] the perfecting of the saints
[1:15:34] the work of the ministry
[1:15:36] the edifying the building up of the body
[1:15:37] of christ till we all come into the
[1:15:40] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:15:41] of christ
[1:15:43] to a perfect man
[1:15:45] and we come into the headship because
[1:15:47] christ is the head
[1:15:48] and we're growing into this capstone of
[1:15:50] love
[1:15:51] but this definition of perfect man i
[1:15:54] want to go through the definition so we
[1:15:55] don't have any wrong understanding of
[1:15:57] what this word is this greek word
[1:16:00] it can be interpreted perfect it means
[1:16:02] man
[1:16:03] or a full age the definition means
[1:16:06] brought to its end finished wanting
[1:16:08] nothing necessary to completeness
[1:16:10] perfect that was just perfect consummate
[1:16:12] human integrity and virtue of men full
[1:16:15] grown adult of full age mature
[1:16:19] when you come when something comes to
[1:16:21] maturity it has not come to perfection
[1:16:24] the way we use the term perfection
[1:16:27] but it has come to completeness
[1:16:30] when you come to full maturity
[1:16:32] at 17 18 19 years of old it means you're
[1:16:35] not getting any taller
[1:16:37] you're done growing
[1:16:39] you've come to your full maturity you
[1:16:41] begin to fill out thicken up amen you
[1:16:44] you now look like a man amen you've come
[1:16:46] to a level of maturity we're not
[1:16:48] expecting you to grow anymore like you
[1:16:50] did between 6 and 10 between 10 and 14.
[1:16:53] you understand you've come to maturity
[1:16:55] that doesn't mean perfect it means
[1:16:57] complete it means mature
[1:16:59] and when this
[1:17:01] this teaching is to bring us into a
[1:17:03] perfect man and to the stature of christ
[1:17:05] it doesn't mean that we have to come to
[1:17:07] perfectness with no failure anymore no
[1:17:09] learning or no growing it means we've
[1:17:11] come to a level of maturity that we can
[1:17:13] be established as christians to be his
[1:17:16] representatives on earth to be
[1:17:17] ambassadors for the kingdom of god
[1:17:21] if we don't understand this then we
[1:17:22] never have the courage to do anything
[1:17:25] we're always waiting
[1:17:28] he said
[1:17:29] and we went through it this morning you
[1:17:31] can't expect a baby to be born a man
[1:17:34] that's why when somebody comes to christ
[1:17:35] we better be patient
[1:17:38] they've got to mature
[1:17:39] somebody gives their heart to the lord
[1:17:40] and you see god begin to deal with
[1:17:42] somebody and you can tell that they have
[1:17:44] an experience you better be patient
[1:17:46] because they've got to grow in virtue
[1:17:48] they've got to grow in patience they
[1:17:50] have to grow in temperance but you who
[1:17:52] are mature should already have enough
[1:17:54] temperance to cover for their lack of
[1:17:56] temperance
[1:17:57] you should have a brotherly kindness to
[1:17:59] cover for when they don't have enough
[1:18:01] temperaments to control themselves when
[1:18:02] they don't have enough patience to wait
[1:18:04] for the word to work you should have
[1:18:05] enough brotherly kindness amen to cover
[1:18:08] for the one who hasn't
[1:18:10] because you can tell that they're
[1:18:11] growing
[1:18:13] you don't expect a baby to be born a man
[1:18:16] it's got to grow to it and we grow in
[1:18:19] christ to the full stature
[1:18:21] not somebody get converted tonight
[1:18:22] tomorrow go to preach the gospel we grow
[1:18:25] up into manhood into the stature of
[1:18:27] christ
[1:18:28] brother brenham never stood for somebody
[1:18:30] playing honky tonk in a bar room one
[1:18:32] night and they got saved and gloriously
[1:18:34] converted and the next night they're
[1:18:35] playing gospel hymns no he says you've
[1:18:37] got to grow up amen you've got to mature
[1:18:40] and then when you mature you can be
[1:18:42] positionally placed and begin to work in
[1:18:44] the kingdom of god brother branham never
[1:18:46] stood for that
[1:18:47] because he understood that you received
[1:18:49] the spirit of adoption to bring you to
[1:18:50] adoption to place you as a son and god
[1:18:52] can use you in his kingdom
[1:18:55] amen
[1:18:56] but that process doesn't have to take 10
[1:18:58] years
[1:19:00] it doesn't have to take 15 years
[1:19:02] i don't even know if it has to take a
[1:19:04] year
[1:19:05] i don't think you put a timeline on it
[1:19:07] and then it's probably different when
[1:19:09] when you receive the new birth if you if
[1:19:11] you have a lot of life experience and
[1:19:12] you receive the new birth at 40 years
[1:19:14] old i doubt it takes as long for you to
[1:19:16] mature as when you receive it when
[1:19:17] you're 10 or 11.
[1:19:20] but it just depends on what god's doing
[1:19:22] in you
[1:19:24] and how you're growing
[1:19:25] i don't know that every son that went
[1:19:27] through the adoption process got there
[1:19:28] at the same time
[1:19:30] i don't think each one of us get there
[1:19:31] at the same time
[1:19:34] i think some of us are looking at others
[1:19:35] of us and saying are you going to ever
[1:19:37] quit drinking the bottle
[1:19:42] because we want to realize what is god
[1:19:45] doing in my life
[1:19:47] what am i supposed to be achieving what
[1:19:50] is happening what what is all of this
[1:19:52] about
[1:19:54] and brother benham showed us what it's
[1:19:56] all about
[1:19:59] he goes to say in the message the way
[1:20:00] back
[1:20:02] now before i read this
[1:20:05] i want to draw one thing
[1:20:08] we know that we begin down here
[1:20:11] in the new birth
[1:20:16] and we grow into this
[1:20:19] into maturity
[1:20:22] i want to write maturity so that we
[1:20:23] don't we're not mistaken
[1:20:26] and that maturity brings us to adoption
[1:20:30] which is placing
[1:20:33] where god can begin to use you
[1:20:35] he began to use you to minister to other
[1:20:37] people in the bride he can begin to use
[1:20:38] you to witness the message he can begin
[1:20:40] to use you in song he can begin to use
[1:20:42] you in works in the church he can begin
[1:20:43] to use you in different ways in in
[1:20:46] preaching and bible study and sunday
[1:20:48] school teachers and there's a myriad of
[1:20:50] ways god can use you so don't ever just
[1:20:52] think well
[1:20:54] when i come to adoption i'll probably
[1:20:55] have an office in the church
[1:20:58] don't wait for that
[1:21:00] but there's all kinds of works that need
[1:21:02] to be done in the kingdom of god but
[1:21:03] when you come to maturity you come to
[1:21:05] adoption or placing and a new birth and
[1:21:08] i would just like to just do this
[1:21:11] this so maybe we understand more clearly
[1:21:13] some of the things brother bannon was
[1:21:14] saying
[1:21:16] this position
[1:21:19] confirms this experience
[1:21:24] i think this is what brother ben was
[1:21:25] talking about
[1:21:28] that
[1:21:30] when we see when we come to adoption and
[1:21:32] replace and god's using us in his
[1:21:34] kingdom it's a confirmation we were born
[1:21:37] sons of god
[1:21:40] because if we never ever come to that
[1:21:42] place
[1:21:44] then why were you on the earth
[1:21:47] why were you here
[1:21:49] what was your existence for if god
[1:21:52] brought a seed of god on the earth and
[1:21:54] brought you here and gave you life amen
[1:21:57] and brought you to the new birth and
[1:21:59] gave you the word enough to be born but
[1:22:00] he has no purpose for you after that
[1:22:04] that you weren't predestinated unto
[1:22:06] adoption you were only predestinated
[1:22:08] unto birth
[1:22:10] but you were never predestined to come
[1:22:12] to maturity and do something that he
[1:22:14] wants you to do serve a purpose for him
[1:22:16] and this earth
[1:22:18] no
[1:22:19] god has a purpose for every one of his
[1:22:22] attributes
[1:22:23] there's something he wants to do in us
[1:22:26] and through us in this world there's
[1:22:28] some light we need to shine somewhere
[1:22:30] there's some life we need to touch in
[1:22:32] some way there's some work we need to do
[1:22:34] for him in some way he didn't just put
[1:22:37] us here on the earth fill us with the
[1:22:39] holy ghost and say oh good i've saved
[1:22:41] that one
[1:22:43] but he he brought us to a new birth to
[1:22:46] bring us to adoption to do what he
[1:22:48] always purposed for us to do in this age
[1:22:49] that we're here
[1:22:52] so the
[1:22:53] the the positional placing confirms the
[1:22:56] new birth
[1:22:58] you can't say i was born again but never
[1:23:01] mature never come into the kingdom of
[1:23:04] god never grow one drop the question now
[1:23:07] is about your new birth
[1:23:09] and i think that's what brother this is
[1:23:11] just brother chad i could change my
[1:23:12] opinion tomorrow so don't put a ton of
[1:23:14] stock but when i see what he's saying
[1:23:16] and the way he's teaching it i think
[1:23:18] that's part of what he's showing that
[1:23:19] you can't just say well i'm born again
[1:23:21] no you go on into adoption you're sealed
[1:23:24] in there the holy ghost vulcanizes seals
[1:23:26] all these attributes together and now
[1:23:28] you're in a very image of jesus christ
[1:23:30] that was the purpose he birthed you for
[1:23:32] that was the purpose you're on this
[1:23:33] earth
[1:23:35] to speak for him to live for him to
[1:23:36] manifest him
[1:23:39] so if you say i've been born again but
[1:23:41] never take a step towards maturity the
[1:23:43] question is were you
[1:23:47] it's like you know brother branham was
[1:23:49] talking about uh justification
[1:23:51] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[1:23:53] ghost consists of new birth
[1:23:56] and and you know brother man made the
[1:23:58] statement you can have justification
[1:23:59] without sanctification sanctification
[1:24:01] and he's showing that through the church
[1:24:03] ages luther came up to justification and
[1:24:05] he didn't go any farther came up to
[1:24:07] sanctification amen but what proved it
[1:24:09] was the bride all along is because the
[1:24:11] baptism the holy ghost came and the
[1:24:13] person himself came to unite with this
[1:24:15] body that had built up vindicating that
[1:24:17] it was all him
[1:24:19] the justification was him the
[1:24:20] sanctification was him the baptism was
[1:24:23] him he vindicated it all because the
[1:24:25] brother branham come and told us this is
[1:24:27] where this fit and this is where this
[1:24:28] fit is god building his body and then we
[1:24:30] saw amen the capping off of the church
[1:24:33] the holy ghost returned to the church
[1:24:35] vindicating what that prophet taught us
[1:24:38] but how can you say i've come to
[1:24:40] justification but no further
[1:24:44] but i'm a child of god
[1:24:46] no
[1:24:47] if you're a child of god you'll come all
[1:24:49] the way into the new birth and the new
[1:24:50] birth vindicate your justification
[1:24:53] because justification is just as if
[1:24:56] you've never done it in the first place
[1:24:59] that's justification and that's why we
[1:25:02] don't go to judgment because you've
[1:25:04] never done anything to be judged for
[1:25:08] you can't say i'm justified but i can
[1:25:10] never get the sanctification i can that
[1:25:13] may be true but what's going to be the
[1:25:15] evidence your justification was true the
[1:25:17] new verse
[1:25:19] the new birth is the evidence your
[1:25:20] justification was true your
[1:25:21] sanctification was true amen because
[1:25:24] millions have dropped off somewhere
[1:25:27] and when millions have thought they've
[1:25:28] come to the new birth and never come to
[1:25:30] adoption they've dropped off somewhere
[1:25:32] that's why i say the placing vindicates
[1:25:34] the new birth
[1:25:36] because millions can drop off through
[1:25:38] the church ages millions dropped off
[1:25:40] they refused to go on they were pruned
[1:25:42] off but the real heart of the tree kept
[1:25:44] on moving from one stage to the next
[1:25:46] from the next stage to the next and god
[1:25:48] was building his bride like he builds a
[1:25:50] person and that's how he builds us
[1:25:53] and if we're children of god we are
[1:25:54] predestinated unto the adoption of
[1:25:57] children by jesus christ
[1:25:59] you'll move from one step to the next to
[1:26:02] the next why because you've received the
[1:26:04] spirit of adoption
[1:26:06] brother branham says in the message the
[1:26:08] way back
[1:26:09] now we find that we see that one time
[1:26:11] that the inoculation was not too good
[1:26:14] there was a conscience always of sin
[1:26:16] he's speaking of the old testament
[1:26:18] and he had to come year by year and make
[1:26:20] his offering but now in hebrews it tells
[1:26:22] us that if the worshiper is once purged
[1:26:25] he is no more conscious of sin
[1:26:27] or otherwise no more desire to sin
[1:26:30] the whole thing's gone from him there's
[1:26:32] no more you don't have to sin every day
[1:26:34] you don't have to do these things you do
[1:26:36] it because you willfully want to
[1:26:38] and the reason you really willfully want
[1:26:40] to is because you have never died to
[1:26:41] yourself
[1:26:42] well brother i know that's scorching but
[1:26:44] it's good when you die to yourself then
[1:26:46] you become a new creature then those
[1:26:48] things are gone and if you try to act
[1:26:51] like you've got them before you have
[1:26:53] it's like i said the other day like a
[1:26:55] black bird trying to put in peacock
[1:26:56] feathers in his wings so you see i'm a
[1:26:58] peacock he isn't that's something he's
[1:27:01] stuck in himself it has to grow from the
[1:27:03] inside out
[1:27:05] and that's the way the holy spirit is
[1:27:08] it's not something you smear on or
[1:27:10] something like that it's a new birth
[1:27:12] you've got to be born again and these
[1:27:14] virtues of the holy ghost has got to
[1:27:16] come from the inside
[1:27:19] out
[1:27:21] and if you're predestinated to adoption
[1:27:24] they will
[1:27:26] let's look at the last scripture for
[1:27:27] tonight philippians chapter one
[1:27:29] musicians you can make your way up
[1:27:31] brother john or no i'm sorry brother ben
[1:27:34] you can come on up
[1:27:37] look at philippians chapter 1
[1:27:44] and verse 6.
[1:27:48] being confident of this very thing that
[1:27:50] he which had begun a good work in you
[1:27:52] will perform it unto the day of jesus
[1:27:54] christ
[1:27:56] if god has truly brought you to the new
[1:27:58] birth he will bring you to the adoption
[1:28:02] that's why he brought you to the new
[1:28:04] birth
[1:28:05] he brought you to the new birth to bring
[1:28:08] you to the adoption
[1:28:10] don't let the devil lie
[1:28:12] but i would encourage you to do this
[1:28:15] yield to the tutor
[1:28:17] and say father teach me
[1:28:21] recognize every obstacle in life
[1:28:24] as training
[1:28:26] recognize everything that we go through
[1:28:28] every opportunity every obstacle every
[1:28:30] junction in the road recognize this as
[1:28:33] god training me and teaching me
[1:28:36] because i need it for this life but i
[1:28:38] need it for the next one too
[1:28:40] because i'm taking with me all these
[1:28:41] lessons and the character that i gained
[1:28:44] it's going with me
[1:28:46] let's all stand
[1:28:49] i hope i hope i hope that didn't confuse
[1:28:52] anybody anymore
[1:28:54] i hope that brought clarity to you
[1:28:56] because that was the goal
[1:28:58] now when you go back and read through
[1:28:59] statue of a perfect man and blasphemous
[1:29:01] names don't get confused just let the
[1:29:03] big picture make everything else make
[1:29:06] sense
[1:29:07] man let's bow our heads and pray
[1:29:09] lord jesus we thank you for your word
[1:29:12] and god i thank you for this message
[1:29:15] god what will we do if you hadn't sent a
[1:29:17] prophet lord
[1:29:19] god you were so good to us that you gave
[1:29:21] us all these tapes recorded sermons
[1:29:24] books
[1:29:25] because you wanted us to understand the
[1:29:27] bible that we hold in our hands
[1:29:30] and you wanted to know how we fit into
[1:29:32] the bible and how the bible fits into us
[1:29:35] and so you sent a bright light in this
[1:29:37] message to illuminate your word
[1:29:40] so that we would understand who we are
[1:29:43] why we're here
[1:29:44] what you're doing in us and what you're
[1:29:46] trying to accomplish

[1:30:12] from pentecost
[1:30:14] all the way to the capping time
[1:30:16] you're capping her with that great
[1:30:18] capstone of love
[1:30:20] yourself
[1:30:21] [Music]
[1:30:22] god i pray that you'd bring us into that
[1:30:24] place

[1:30:48] uh outward works but lord it's something
