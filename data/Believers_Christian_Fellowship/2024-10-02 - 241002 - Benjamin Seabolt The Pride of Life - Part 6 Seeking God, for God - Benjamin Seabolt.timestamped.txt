[14:10] beond than
[14:17] you
[14:19] for
[14:22] you let's pray
[14:25] [Music]
[14:26] together Lord Jesus we
[14:31] just want to thank you for this
[14:32] opportunity that you've given us once
[14:34] again Lord
[14:36] that we can come into your house we can
[14:40] sing your
[14:42] Praises Lord for surely Thou Art Worthy
[14:44] of our
[14:46] Praises Lord and we have an opportunity
[14:50] as a select group of
[14:52] people predestinated before the
[14:55] foundation of the world to come and to
[14:58] look into your word this
[15:00] evening and to change our lives by the
[15:04] power of your
[15:06] spirit and by the power of your word to
[15:09] reflect the very image of the Living God
[15:12] on this Earth Lord may we not take that
[15:15] position lightly may we not take it
[15:17] flippant may we grasp what you have
[15:20] delivered into our hands and the
[15:22] opportunity that you've delivered into
[15:24] our
[15:25] hands and may we take full advantage of
[15:28] that Lord
[15:29] we would just ask as we would come to
[15:31] this part of the service as we so often
[15:33] do
[15:35] Lord
[15:37] father you know we're just Fallen
[15:42] Humanity Lord and it's one thing for
[15:46] fallen Humanity to sit and listen to the
[15:49] words of God that's no doubt our
[15:51] appropriate place but for a mortal
[15:54] to try to find the mind of God and speak
[15:57] the word of God to a people
[16:00] Lord we recognize that we have no
[16:03] ability to do
[16:05] that but Lord this is your way this is
[16:09] what you have ordained and that's why we
[16:12] stand here father and nothing
[16:14] else because if you said this is your
[16:17] way and this is what you want done then
[16:19] who are we to think that we have a
[16:21] better idea Lord so we would just commit
[16:25] ourselves to you both speaker and hearer
[16:28] and we would pray that that you would
[16:29] come and that you would supernaturally
[16:32] do this evening what you've ordained the
[16:35] purpose for this service to be we commit
[16:38] ourselves into your hands in the name of
[16:40] the Lord Jesus Christ
[16:43] amen God bless you I'll invite you right
[16:46] into the scriptures we're going to go
[16:49] to
[16:50] Psalm
[16:53] 105 take a portion of scripture there
[16:56] just greet you in the name of the Lord
[16:58] Jesus Christ any visitors that we may
[17:01] have here this evening we certainly want
[17:03] to greet you bring you greetings from
[17:07] our pastor he's on his way back home
[17:11] right
[17:13] now he got me a little excited when he
[17:16] text me a couple hours ago
[17:18] he said that he was praying for me for
[17:21] the service and I appreciated that and
[17:23] then he said he was going to be in the
[17:25] air during the service I thought well
[17:28] wow he don't even know what I'm
[17:29] preaching yet and he's going to be in
[17:31] the air so I was pretty motivated until
[17:36] I realized that he was just going to be
[17:38] in the air traveling so hopefully I
[17:42] don't ground
[17:46] him but we'll be glad when they're back
[17:50] home Psalm 105 beginning in verse
[17:57] one says
[17:59] all give thanks unto the Lord call upon
[18:03] his
[18:03] name make known his deeds among the
[18:07] People Sing unto him hymns I'm sorry
[18:11] sing unto him sing Psalms unto him talk
[18:16] ye of all his wondrous
[18:19] Works Glory ye also in His holy name let
[18:24] the heart of them Rejoice that seek the
[18:26] Lord seek the Lord
[18:29] and his
[18:30] strength seek his face ever more God
[18:35] bless you as you would have your seats
[18:37] this evening that verse four is where I
[18:41] would really like to key in on this
[18:45] evening and it says seek the Lord and
[18:49] his
[18:51] strength seek his face ever more so we
[18:57] immediately realize there's a
[19:00] differentiation here of seeking the Lord
[19:05] and for the sake of a title this evening
[19:08] that's what I would like to maybe title
[19:11] this is seeking God for
[19:14] God because we understand that we can
[19:18] seek God for many
[19:23] reasons as brother random said
[19:25] you let somebody claim to be an atheist
[19:29] and let them really get in a pinch one
[19:32] time and get hurt and the first thing
[19:35] they want to do is cry oh God oh God oh
[19:40] God so we
[19:43] recognize that that's not the
[19:45] appropriate seeking of God that we want
[19:48] to do although we as Believers no doubt
[19:51] we get hurt we certainly want to do that
[19:53] I would never tell somebody not to do
[19:55] that I intend to do that myself uh given
[20:00] the opportunity which I hope never comes
[20:02] my
[20:03] way so that's not what we don't want to
[20:07] say that that's
[20:09] wrong but we want to come to a proper
[20:14] understanding that we can seek God for
[20:20] ourselves instead of seeking God for
[20:25] God and this is what the scripture
[20:30] is uh petitioning us to do is to seek
[20:35] the Lord and seek his strength it's
[20:37] encouraging us to do that seek the Lord
[20:39] seek his
[20:41] strength but then it adds something to
[20:43] that seek his
[20:46] face ever
[20:48] more which means even while you're
[20:51] seeking the Lord for his strength you
[20:53] should be seeking him for his face and
[20:56] if you're not seeking him for his
[20:59] strength in a certain situation you
[21:01] should still be seeking his face so seek
[21:05] his face ever more means continually not
[21:10] ceasing not necessarily for a certain
[21:15] situation I want to go through a
[21:19] very very familiar portion of scripture
[21:22] here this evening I do not intend to be
[21:25] lengthy I do not intend to teach
[21:27] anything deep this evening
[21:29] I would uh very much encourage you to
[21:32] pull this evening because I feel just
[21:35] very much at Liberty to preach this
[21:36] evening um I've got some notes here but
[21:40] um if we get to them great if we don't
[21:41] that's fine I just want to extend this
[21:45] opportunity for the gift to work if you
[21:47] have a need this evening just pull if
[21:50] it's not in my notes that doesn't make
[21:51] any difference that's okay we'll get to
[21:54] the notes another time but you know I
[21:56] usually lean a lot more towards teaching
[21:58] but I just don't fail to do that this
[22:00] evening
[22:02] um that's just just the way that I feel
[22:05] so I to encourage you just a
[22:08] pull whatever specific need that you
[22:11] have in your life I feel that the Lord
[22:13] can answer that this
[22:14] evening but we're going to go to Exodus
[22:18] and I would say don't turn there just
[22:20] kind of follow along and listen because
[22:22] there's so many scriptures here if
[22:23] you're trying to turn and follow along
[22:26] um you're you're probably going to miss
[22:29] what's being said so I would encourage
[22:31] you just just to listen and you know you
[22:35] can go back and write the scriptures
[22:36] down and read them later in the full
[22:38] context if you would like but it this is
[22:41] a simple enough thought I think you can
[22:43] grasp it just by listening in Exodus
[22:46] 2:23 and it says this is Israel as
[22:49] they're in
[22:50] Egypt after Joseph has died and there's
[22:53] a new king that doesn't know Joseph and
[22:56] it came to pass in the process of time
[22:58] that the king of Egypt died and the
[23:01] children of Israel sigh by reason of the
[23:04] bondage and they cried and their Cry
[23:07] came up unto God by reason of the
[23:10] bondage if you could lower the lights
[23:12] just a little bit more I'd appreciate it
[23:14] so we hear we see here in the scripture
[23:18] that the children of Israel are sighing
[23:20] unto God and they're crying unto God
[23:24] which I would dares to say there's
[23:26] nobody going to raise their hand and say
[23:27] yeah they shouldn't have been oning that
[23:29] like that's a bad idea we don't have a
[23:31] problem with this but the problem is
[23:35] they're signed by reason of their
[23:38] bondage and their Cry came up to God by
[23:43] reason of the bondage so it tells us why
[23:47] they're sighing and why they're crying
[23:49] to God they're not sighing and crying to
[23:52] God that there's a portion of scripture
[23:54] here Lord that you haven't fulfilled in
[23:56] our lives and we're really seeking you
[23:58] to manifest
[24:00] that they're sighing and crying because
[24:03] they're
[24:05] uncomfortable in their flesh they are
[24:07] suffering and they are sighing and
[24:09] crying wanting God to move on the scene
[24:11] and again I don't want anybody to leave
[24:13] here this evening thinking that you
[24:15] should not do that or that's something
[24:16] that's wrong or evil that is not the
[24:19] case um I preached a message a while
[24:22] back of it's not wrong it's just not
[24:25] right and that's kind of a theme here
[24:27] this evening this is not wrong but this
[24:30] is not what should be the
[24:34] priority if they would be seeking God
[24:37] and sighing and crying to God to fulfill
[24:42] this portion of scripture that said
[24:44] after 400 years you would deliver us
[24:46] with a mighty
[24:48] hand and where is that at in our lives
[24:51] we want to see you fulfill your word in
[24:53] my
[24:55] life if they would have been focused on
[24:58] that
[24:59] instead of just simply reaching out to
[25:01] God because they're uncomfortable they
[25:04] may not have been
[25:06] uncomfortable they may have found
[25:09] themselves delivered of this
[25:10] situation earlier and we know this is
[25:13] factual um I don't remember the numbers
[25:16] right off but I'm wanting to say it was
[25:17] like 32 or 39 years after the 400 years
[25:21] that they finally went out of
[25:23] Egypt that wasn't God's
[25:26] will that was their will
[25:28] will because they weren't seeking his
[25:32] face they were seeking his
[25:35] hand and that's the principle that I
[25:38] want to relay this has been on my mind I
[25:41] think I've even shared it with a couple
[25:42] of you all before at for several months
[25:45] maybe a year the difference of seeking
[25:48] God's face and seeking God's
[25:51] hand there is a big
[25:54] difference verse 24 and God heard their
[25:59] groing so even though they weren't
[26:01] necessarily what we would say reaching
[26:03] out for the right
[26:05] reasons God
[26:07] heard and God will hear
[26:10] you that's why I want to
[26:13] emphasize there is never a situation
[26:16] that it's wrong for you to reach out to
[26:20] God like when things go sideways reach
[26:24] out to God cry out to God scream out to
[26:27] God
[26:30] but just understand we're called to a
[26:32] higher
[26:34] plane we're called brother Rand says
[26:37] it's a
[26:39] shame that man won't seek out after God
[26:42] until he gets into a position of
[26:45] desperation he says it ought not to be
[26:48] that
[26:49] way but it's not until we get crammed
[26:52] into a corner or until you know we get a
[26:55] bad doctor's report or until you know
[26:57] something and go sideways that we didn't
[27:00] expect that we seek out with desperation
[27:04] to
[27:06] God but that's okay he'll still hear
[27:10] us so do it but let's let's seek his
[27:15] face ever
[27:17] more not just his hand when we're in
[27:20] trouble and God heard their groaning and
[27:22] God remembered his Covenant with Abraham
[27:24] with Isaac and with Jacob
[27:29] God heard their groaning and he felt
[27:32] sorry for them because they were
[27:34] uncomfortable is not what the scripture
[27:39] says the scripture says God heard their
[27:43] groaning and God remembered his Co his
[27:47] word god remembered his word with
[27:50] Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob that
[27:53] said I'm going to do something with this
[27:56] people
[27:59] so yes they're sigh yes they're crying
[28:01] yes they're uncomfortable and yes I'm
[28:03] going to deal with that but I'm going to
[28:05] deal with it because I've already made a
[28:08] covenant I've already made a promise
[28:10] I've already made a word about these
[28:12] people that I'm going to do something
[28:14] I'm going to do
[28:18] something not just because they're
[28:21] uncomfortable we move into Exodus
[28:25] 3:16 and it says go and gather the
[28:27] Elders of of Israel this is God telling
[28:30] Moses go and gather the Elders of Israel
[28:33] together and say unto
[28:35] them the Lord God of your fathers the
[28:38] god of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob
[28:42] appeared unto me
[28:43] saying I have surely visited you and
[28:46] seen that which is done to you in
[28:50] Egypt and I have
[28:52] said I will bring you up out of the
[28:55] Affliction of Egypt
[28:58] unto the land of the Canaanites and the
[29:00] Hittites and the amorites and
[29:03] the perizzites and the hites and the
[29:08] jebusites unto a land flowing with milk
[29:11] and
[29:13] honey so God speaks to Moses says Go
[29:16] Tell them I've heard their
[29:18] cries I see the Affliction that you're
[29:21] in in
[29:22] Egypt and I'm going to deliver
[29:25] you and I'm going going to put you unto
[29:29] a land flowing with milk and
[29:32] honey so he says what he's going to do
[29:35] about the immediate
[29:37] situation but he also tells them what
[29:39] his purpose is for that what he really
[29:42] wants to
[29:44] do Exodus 4:29 and Moses and Aaron went
[29:47] and gathered together all of the Elders
[29:49] of the children of Israel and Aaron
[29:51] spake all the words which the Lord had
[29:52] spoken unto Moses and did the signs in
[29:54] the sight of the people and the people
[29:56] believed and when they heard heard that
[29:58] the Lord had visited the children of
[30:00] Israel and that he had looked upon their
[30:02] a Affliction then they bowed their heads
[30:05] and
[30:07] worshiped my question is why had they
[30:09] not bowed their head before and
[30:12] worshiped because they were human just
[30:14] like me and you and just like the
[30:17] prophet said it's a
[30:18] shame that we Fallen H humans won't do
[30:23] what we're supposed to
[30:24] do until we get into a situation of
[30:27] desperation
[30:31] then they bowed their heads and
[30:35] worshiped this is verse 31 in chapter
[30:40] 4 after they heard what God was going to
[30:43] do they bowed their heads and
[30:46] worship Exodus 5 verse 20 next
[30:52] chapter and they met Moses and Aaron who
[30:55] stood in the way as they came forth from
[30:57] F pharaoh this is immediately after
[30:59] Pharaoh said you'll have too much time
[31:01] on your hand I'm going to take your
[31:02] straw away and you still have to make
[31:03] the same amount of bricks they stood in
[31:06] the way as they came forth from pharaoh
[31:08] and they said unto them the Lord look
[31:10] upon you and judge because ye have made
[31:13] our
[31:14] savior to be a hoard in the eyes of
[31:17] pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants
[31:18] to put a sword in their hand to slay us
[31:21] and Moses returned unto the Lord and
[31:23] said Lord wherefore hast thou so evil
[31:26] entreated this people why is it that
[31:28] thou Hast sent me for since I came to
[31:31] pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath
[31:33] done evil to this people neither hast
[31:36] thou delivered thy people at all so in
[31:39] the chapter right before this all the
[31:41] people rejoicing all the people believe
[31:43] Moses all the people believe God they
[31:46] have their
[31:47] circumstances uh the Affliction
[31:50] increased and now all of a sudden they
[31:52] forgot that the Lord had visited them
[31:54] they forgot they believed Moses they
[31:56] forgot that they believed God and now
[31:58] they're saying God judge you because
[32:00] since you've came on the scene it's got
[32:06] worse you know
[32:09] why is because they were seeking the
[32:11] hand of God and not the face of
[32:17] God I would encourage
[32:20] you not to leave this story thousands of
[32:22] years ago
[32:29] in one
[32:30] chapter they went from
[32:32] Believers to
[32:37] unbelievers over
[32:41] straw he took away their
[32:44] straw and they had to make bricks
[32:47] without the straw which was harder and
[32:51] now their testimony their
[32:55] confession their status as believers
[32:58] went down the
[33:02] draam I would venture to
[33:06] say they had an intellectual
[33:12] conception they did not have a real
[33:15] experience with
[33:17] God but they had grasped something
[33:21] intellectually this sounds like it can
[33:24] improve my
[33:26] situation I've seen a couple signs and a
[33:28] couple wonders I'm on board with this I
[33:31] believe in this this is going to
[33:34] work until the straw got taken
[33:38] away now they're not only Believers
[33:41] they're cursing the very instrument that
[33:44] God is going to use to bring them out of
[33:45] this situation the very vessel that God
[33:47] has sent to
[33:54] them
[33:56] Moses in this early part of his
[34:00] ministry isn't in much better
[34:06] condition because he returns to the Lord
[34:09] and says Lord wherefore hast thou so
[34:10] evily entreated this people why is it
[34:12] that thou Hast sent me questioning his
[34:17] commission for since I came to pharaoh
[34:20] to speak in thy name he hath done evil
[34:21] to this people neither hast thou
[34:23] delivered thy people at
[34:26] all just for those of you who don't
[34:29] think a minister can ever get down and
[34:32] that we always float around on the
[34:34] clouds let the people resist the word
[34:37] one
[34:38] time sometimes we Scurry back to God and
[34:40] be like uh you sure that's what I was
[34:43] supposed to say cuz didn't really go
[34:47] over too well in fact I don't think
[34:49] anybody likes me
[34:55] anymore chapter 6 verse 1 then the Lord
[34:58] said to Moses now shalt thou see what I
[35:00] will do to Pharaoh for with a strong
[35:03] hand shall he let them go and with a
[35:05] strong hand shall he drive them out of
[35:06] this land and God spake unto Mo Moses
[35:09] and said unto him I am the
[35:17] Lord and I appeared unto Abraham and
[35:20] Isaac and unto Jacob by the name of God
[35:23] Almighty but by my name Jehovah was I
[35:28] not known to
[35:30] them so the people get
[35:32] upset they holler at Moses Moses gets
[35:36] gets
[35:37] upset can't figure out his commission
[35:40] can't figure out what he's doing comes
[35:41] crying back to God God in
[35:47] response does not act like a human he
[35:50] acts like
[35:52] God God does not coddle him God does not
[35:57] say all I'm sorry maybe you should have
[35:59] said it a little bit nicer a little bit
[36:00] different God
[36:03] says you will see what I will do I will
[36:06] deliver them out of the hand of pharaoh
[36:09] and I am the Lord I appeared to your
[36:12] fathers as God Almighty but I am now
[36:16] going to appear and be known by you and
[36:19] this people as
[36:21] Jehovah nobody has known me in this
[36:24] capacity before
[36:27] and I will also establish my Covenant
[36:30] with them to give to the land of Canaan
[36:32] the ca the land of their pilgrimage
[36:34] wherein they were strangers and I have
[36:36] also heard the groanings of the children
[36:38] of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in
[36:40] bondage and I have remembered my
[36:42] Covenant wherefore say unto the children
[36:45] of Israel I am the Lord and I will bring
[36:50] you out from under the burdens of the
[36:51] Egyptians and I will rid you out of
[36:53] their bondage and I will redeem you with
[36:54] a stretched out arm and with great
[36:56] judgment and I will take you to me for a
[36:59] people and I will be to you a God and ye
[37:02] shall know that I am the Lord your
[37:06] God which bringeth you out from under
[37:09] the burdens of the Egyptians and I will
[37:10] bring you unto the land concerning that
[37:13] which I will swear that I did swear to
[37:15] give it to Abraham and to Isaac and to
[37:17] Jacob and I will give to you for a
[37:20] Heritage I am the
[37:24] Lord amen you can see a theme
[37:28] in God's
[37:30] response settle down I'm going to do
[37:33] what I said I'm going to do and I'm also
[37:36] going to reveal myself to you and this
[37:37] people like I've never revealed myself
[37:40] to a person before I'm going to reveal
[37:42] you reveal myself to you as the Lord I'm
[37:45] going to reveal myself to you as Jehovah
[37:48] and in case you didn't get it the first
[37:49] time I'm going to reveal myself as the
[37:51] Lord and in case you didn't get it the
[37:53] second time when you come into this land
[37:55] you're going to know that I am the Lord
[38:01] three or four times he mentions this In
[38:03] this passage and Moses spake unto the
[38:06] children of Israel but they hearkened
[38:09] not unto Moses for anguish of spirit and
[38:14] for cruel
[38:17] bondage they make their case to Moses
[38:19] Moses makes his case to God God comes
[38:21] back and says I'm going to do what I
[38:22] said I'm going to do here is my Covenant
[38:25] here is what I'm going to do and it's my
[38:27] desire to reveal myself to you like I've
[38:30] never revealed myself to
[38:32] anybody and they
[38:34] said life to I had a bad day today was
[38:38] rough like I don't want to hear
[38:46] it anguish of
[38:49] spirit and for cruel
[38:53] bondage anguish of spirit and for cruel
[38:56] bondage made them say I don't want God's
[39:00] provided way I don't want to hear about
[39:03] God's covenant I don't accept you as
[39:05] God's messenger I don't want to hear
[39:07] anything you've got to
[39:09] say I don't want to know the God as
[39:14] Jehovah I do not want to know God as my
[39:19] Lord thanks but it's been a bad
[39:26] day has anybody found thems in anguish
[39:29] of spirit
[39:34] lately cruel
[39:42] bondage the reason you're tore up in
[39:44] your spirit is because it's Satan trying
[39:47] to get you to make this
[39:49] confession it's been a bad
[39:53] day I I can't handle the listen to a
[39:57] tape right now I just need to go relax
[40:00] like I need to clear my
[40:02] mind I I don't want to
[40:06] know what you're trying to do in this
[40:11] difficult situation right now I don't
[40:14] want to know you in the way that you're
[40:16] trying to because this surely cannot be
[40:19] of
[40:21] you I just need to go work this out I
[40:23] need to get my mind clear I need to get
[40:25] this settled saints of God the footsteps
[40:27] of the righteous are ordered of the Lord
[40:30] if you find yourself in anguish of
[40:32] spirit if you find yourself in Cruel
[40:34] bondage if you find yourself in
[40:36] unpleasant circumstances it's because
[40:39] the footsteps of the righteous are
[40:40] ordered of the lord and there is one
[40:42] reason you're in that situation is
[40:44] because he's trying to reveal himself to
[40:47] you in a way that he has never revealed
[40:50] himself to you
[40:53] before if you don't believe that
[40:58] you are going to live a miserable
[41:01] life there is no other hope you've only
[41:06] got two options my footsteps are either
[41:08] ordered of the Lord and He is revealing
[41:11] himself to me through this or this is
[41:14] just happen stance this is bad luck this
[41:16] is something this is sin catching up to
[41:18] me from you know something I did when I
[41:20] was in third grade like you got no other
[41:23] options but negativity
[41:28] amen they find themselves in this
[41:31] condition and God just simply says
[41:34] you're here because I want to reveal you
[41:37] reveal myself to you as
[41:40] Jehovah as the
[41:44] Lord you say well what does that mean
[41:47] that you want to reveal yourself to me
[41:49] as
[41:52] Jehovah
[41:55] Jehovah seven compound pound Redemptive
[41:59] names of
[42:01] Jehovah Jehovah
[42:04] Gyra the Lord is my
[42:11] provider we like that
[42:13] right that's good it's okay you can say
[42:17] Amen we like that it's
[42:22] good if the Lord is your provider that
[42:27] means you find yourself in a situation
[42:30] you need the Lord to be your
[42:33] provider also known as a trial
[42:39] AKA bad
[42:41] situation also known as not your best
[42:48] day do you want him to reveal himself to
[42:52] you as Jehovah
[42:54] Gyra be careful what you sign up for
[42:58] right we as Believers may not even sign
[43:01] up for it and we get it
[43:03] anyhow but that's okay that's what we
[43:06] may not have read the fine print but
[43:08] that's what we signed up
[43:10] for Jehovah
[43:13] RFA the Lord is my
[43:17] healer if the Lord is your
[43:21] healer guess
[43:25] what I thank you you've got my point I
[43:27] don't need to dwell on it very long
[43:30] Jehovah Shema the Lord is
[43:34] present if you find yourself in the need
[43:38] of Jehovah Shema wanting to reveal
[43:41] himself to you as such it's probably
[43:44] because you feel
[43:48] alone the reason you feel alone is not
[43:52] because he takes satisfaction in you
[43:54] feeling alone the reason that you feel
[43:57] alone is he wants you to get down on
[43:59] your knees and seek his face and say
[44:02] Lord Lord reveal yourself to me like
[44:06] you've revealed yourself to me never
[44:08] revealed yourself to me before reveal
[44:11] yourself to me as Jehovah Shema reveal
[44:14] yourself to me that you are present in
[44:16] this
[44:19] situation he takes no satisfaction in
[44:23] the external circumstances that cause us
[44:25] grief
[44:27] what he takes satisfaction is is in the
[44:30] purpose behind
[44:35] that Jehovah Shalom the Lord is my
[44:41] peace I'm not faulting you if you didn't
[44:44] sign up for needing Jehovah Shalom to
[44:48] manifest himself in your life
[44:51] today like I don't ask for these things
[44:55] either
[44:57] I'm not signing up for extra
[45:01] credit the fact of the matter is we've
[45:04] got to come to terms with our purpose
[45:06] here on Earth and our purpose here on
[45:10] Earth is for him to manifest his Essence
[45:14] and his character and his being through
[45:17] us and a part of that is us not
[45:21] responding to situations that cause us
[45:25] anguish of spirit and uncomfortableness
[45:28] the way the world
[45:30] does because if we respond and we
[45:33] exhibit the same traits that the world
[45:35] does what good is our Lord to the
[45:39] world but when we find ourselves in
[45:43] conditions that the world find itself in
[45:45] and we respond with the appropriate
[45:48] response of Lord I don't even know what
[45:52] you're doing now but in this situation I
[45:55] could really use you coming on the scene
[45:58] and revealing yourself to me as Jehovah
[46:01] Shalom I need peace in this situation to
[46:05] have an
[46:10] understanding but I find too often what
[46:13] I do is I pray Lord take this situation
[46:15] away from me Lord remove me from this
[46:18] situation Lord change the picture change
[46:21] the situation that's not the prayer that
[46:24] he's after the prayer that he's after is
[46:27] seek my face not my hands his hands can
[46:30] come down and fix that problem in a
[46:32] split second not even his whole hand one
[46:36] finger his hand is capable his hands are
[46:40] worthy there is not an issue with the
[46:43] power of His
[46:45] Hands but that's not his
[46:47] purpose what if he would think about
[46:50] this for a second and those that those
[46:52] of you that's been on the road for a
[46:54] minute think if God would have came and
[46:57] removed every hard circumstance from you
[47:00] as soon as you ask him where would you
[47:03] be right
[47:05] now I'll tell you where you would be you
[47:08] would be the most impatient person on
[47:11] the face of the Earth that's exactly
[47:13] what our Prophet said he says the reason
[47:16] that we have to wait the reason that God
[47:18] can't come and fix everything as soon as
[47:21] we ask ask him is because if he would do
[47:24] that then we would become even more
[47:27] impatient with him the next
[47:30] time but he says it's only through
[47:34] patience that we possess life and he
[47:37] also says that it's th that patience is
[47:41] the process of character
[47:46] development that's why we find oursel in
[47:49] conditions that are
[47:50] uncomfortable and when we just pray over
[47:53] and over and over lord change this Lord
[47:56] change change this Lord change this move
[47:58] on my behalf let me see your hand his
[48:01] hand does not come I dare you I dare you
[48:05] instead of praying that way next time I
[48:07] dare you to ask him Lord what are you
[48:10] trying to get me to right now through
[48:12] this what are you trying to reveal
[48:15] through me what are you trying to reveal
[48:17] through me to my coworker to my
[48:20] family what is your purpose behind this
[48:23] and may I seek your face what is your
[48:26] will behind this may I seek your face
[48:30] and may I pray in accordance to that may
[48:33] I not just be running to you all the
[48:35] time saying please help me please help
[48:37] me please help me please change this but
[48:39] may I run to you seeking your face Lord
[48:43] what are you revealing to me right
[48:48] now Jehovah nii the Lord is my banner
[48:51] the Lord is my protector the Lord is my
[48:53] victory
[48:56] remember brother random says that the
[48:58] seven compounds name seven compound
[49:00] names of Jehovah applied to
[49:05] Jesus so when we take the name of Jesus
[49:08] and we give our life to Jesus it's not
[49:11] just five little letters it's a
[49:14] person that represents a character that
[49:17] represents
[49:21] God God is represented as our Victory
[49:26] how are we ever ever going to know the
[49:27] we pray all the time let the fullness of
[49:29] his word be in me we're the fullness of
[49:31] his how many times have we heard that
[49:33] the fullness of his word the fullness of
[49:35] his word has come well we automatically
[49:37] think of all the good things of that but
[49:39] in order for all the good things of that
[49:41] to be manifested brother brandom says
[49:43] God works in pros and cons in types and
[49:45] shadows in negatives and positives in
[49:47] order to express himself as a savior
[49:50] somebody had to be lost in order to
[49:52] express himself as a Healer somebody had
[49:54] to be sick
[49:56] he says this was his purpose in the back
[49:59] part of his
[50:01] mind he wanted to express
[50:05] himself God didn't just stop wanting to
[50:08] express himself the day me and you came
[50:10] on the
[50:11] scene brother brandom says our purpose
[50:14] here on Earth is to prove to Satan that
[50:18] we're not like the first
[50:20] Eve he says our purpose here on Earth is
[50:23] to be a tool used of God to express his
[50:27] word to manifest
[50:31] himself that's why we find ourselves in
[50:34] bad
[50:35] situations is so
[50:38] Jesus can be
[50:48] manifested we
[50:51] pray to be like
[50:53] Jesus to be more like him
[50:58] we pray these things and I believe we
[51:00] mean
[51:02] it but I think it's time that we come to
[51:06] an understanding of what that really
[51:08] means what we're really signing up for I
[51:11] think if we will grasp
[51:14] that we're going to be a lot more
[51:18] settled we're not going to be so easily
[51:21] shaken we're not going to respond to bad
[51:24] situations like the world does
[51:29] Jehovah Raha the Lord is my
[51:33] shepherd if you need a
[51:36] Shepherd probably means you're
[51:39] lost if you need a Shepherd it probably
[51:41] means you need a little
[51:46] guidance if there's anybody in here that
[51:48] doesn't need need Jehovah
[51:53] Raha I'd say you're on Shaky Ground yes
[51:56] because that's one of the first things
[51:58] we need to come to it's like I need some
[52:01] help I don't have this all figured out
[52:05] life's not going the way that I think it
[52:06] is I need somebody to guide me here cuz
[52:08] I've made four decisions today that did
[52:11] not turn out very
[52:15] well Jehovah tesu the Lord is my
[52:21] righteousness these are the seven
[52:23] compound names of Jehovah and this is
[52:25] what God almighty was telling Israel I
[52:28] want to reveal myself to you this
[52:31] way but every time a situation came up
[52:35] for him to reveal himself this way to
[52:38] them they immediately went from
[52:39] Believers to
[52:41] unbelievers they immediately went from
[52:45] followers of the Prophet to I don't even
[52:47] think you're a prophet anymore and if
[52:49] you are God surely ain't talking to you
[52:51] for
[52:53] me just like this back and forth back
[52:57] and forth back and forth one chapter I'm
[53:00] getting ahead of
[53:01] myself Exodus
[53:03] 14 they finally made it out of
[53:06] Egypt they come to the Red
[53:10] Sea they're rejoicing they've went out
[53:13] of Egypt they've had the Passover Moses
[53:15] our fearless Prophet is leading us we've
[53:17] got everything good going for us no more
[53:20] making bricks and when Pharaoh Drew nigh
[53:23] the children of Israel lifted up their
[53:25] eyes and behold the Egyptian marched
[53:26] after them and they were sore afraid and
[53:28] the children of Israel Cried Out unto
[53:30] the Lord appropriate response nothing
[53:33] wrong here and they said unto Moses
[53:36] because there were no graves in Egypt
[53:38] hast thou taken us to die in the
[53:40] wilderness not the appropriate
[53:44] response remember Saints this was after
[53:47] they just sat and
[53:50] watched the nine plagues nine right
[53:53] don't crucify me if I get the number
[53:55] wrong
[53:57] they just watched all of the plagues
[54:00] strike
[54:01] Egypt up until the third plague and then
[54:05] none of the plagues touched them they
[54:08] have seen
[54:10] Supernatural Beyond
[54:12] Supernatural and now God's yanked them
[54:14] out of this land even to the fact they
[54:17] spoiled Egypt on their way out and now
[54:20] they come to a sea the Red
[54:24] Sea they've seen all of this they
[54:27] they've confessed all of this they come
[54:30] to the Red Sea they turn around
[54:32] Pharaoh's not even close yet they just
[54:35] see the threat of him
[54:44] coming they see the threat of something
[54:48] coming it hasn't even happened yet it
[54:50] hasn't even arrived and they're already
[54:53] unbelievers again
[54:58] wow they're crying out to the Lord which
[55:02] again is the appropriate
[55:04] response but the verse right after that
[55:06] reveals they're not crying out to the
[55:09] Lord Lord remember your promise remember
[55:11] your Covenant remember what you said you
[55:13] was going to do to us remember praise
[55:15] the Lord you said you were going to
[55:17] reveal yourself to us as
[55:22] Jehovah Raha you're going to be our
[55:25] Shepherd you're clearly leading
[55:28] us no that's not the response the
[55:32] response is we're all going to die and
[55:35] it's your fault Moses because there
[55:37] wasn't enough graves in Egypt you
[55:39] brought us out here so we could all be
[55:42] buried the flippy flippancy of their
[55:46] minds
[55:48] is I would say
[55:52] unbelievable but then I have something
[55:54] come up in my life that my day didn't go
[55:58] quite like I thought my day should go
[56:00] and I find myself scratching my
[56:03] head where are th
[56:05] Lord what's going on how did this
[56:10] happen remember brother Bram says
[56:12] everything that happened with Israel was
[56:14] just a type for
[56:15] us so we can sit here and point fingers
[56:18] at is at Israel all we want but all
[56:20] Israel revealed was
[56:24] me that's what the prophet said like it
[56:26] or
[56:27] not this is how flid I
[56:32] am it hasn't even arrived yet and
[56:35] they've already left the
[56:37] message they've already said that ain't
[56:39] a
[56:42] prophet wherefore hast thou dealt with
[56:44] us this far to carry us out of Egypt is
[56:46] not this the word that we did tell thee
[56:48] in
[56:53] Egypt the rebuking Moses
[56:57] as soon as they get done rebuking him
[57:00] they remind him oh yeah by the way
[57:01] remember I told you about
[57:03] this I told you what was going to happen
[57:06] I knew more than you did is what they're
[57:09] saying we told you this would happen
[57:12] saying let us alone that we may serve
[57:15] the Egyptians for it had been better for
[57:17] us to serve the Egyptians than that we
[57:20] should die in the wilderness and Moses
[57:22] said unto the people fear ye not watch
[57:25] Moses's response you remember Moses's
[57:27] response the first time he went running
[57:29] back to God like what about my
[57:30] commission what am I doing what look at
[57:32] Moses's response now Moses don't have
[57:35] all the answers but Moses has already
[57:37] been told to the Lord I'm going to
[57:39] deliver Pharaoh in your hands
[57:41] tomorrow Moses's response fear ye not
[57:46] stand still and see the salvation of the
[57:49] Lord which he will show unto you today
[57:53] for the Egyptians whom ye have seen
[57:55] today you shall shall see them again no
[57:57] more forever you can tell Moses is not
[58:00] the same Moses Moses has taken a
[58:09] step the Lord shall fight for you and
[58:13] you shall hold your peace amen thus the
[58:16] Lord saved Israel that day out of the
[58:18] hand of the Egyptians this is verse 30
[58:22] and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon
[58:25] the seashore yes and Israel saw that the
[58:29] great work which the Lord did upon the
[58:32] Egyptians and the people feared the Lord
[58:36] and believed the Lord and his servant
[58:40] Moses we're back to being Believers
[58:42] again it's a good day things are good
[58:45] enemies destroyed bad doctors report
[58:48] taken care of legal trouble I issue
[58:51] done car crash I was almost in I avoided
[58:57] credit card finally paid
[59:01] off keep
[59:04] pulling he can get
[59:08] specific put yourself in
[59:11] there I'm back to being a Believer again
[59:14] things are okay things are good things
[59:16] settled out a little bit family don't
[59:19] think I'm quite a fanatic I told him I
[59:22] didn't worship a man it's just God sent
[59:24] a prophet
[59:27] they backed off a little
[59:29] bit I'm not the black sheep of the
[59:33] family I might get a go to
[59:38] Thanksgiving
[59:40] back back to being the believer
[59:45] again next chapter so Moses brought
[59:48] Israel from the Red Sea and they went
[59:50] out into the Wilderness of shur and they
[59:52] went three days in the wilderness and
[59:54] found no water and when they came to
[59:56] Mara they could not drink of the Waters
[59:58] of Mara for they were bitter therefore
[1:00:00] the name of it was called Mara and the
[1:00:02] people murmured against Moses saying
[1:00:05] what shall we
[1:00:11] drink they've just had
[1:00:14] the plethora of Supernatural
[1:00:18] experiences things are good the
[1:00:21] Egyptians
[1:00:22] destroyed in the Red Sea
[1:00:26] that God dried
[1:00:29] up 3 days
[1:00:31] later God can't provide anything for us
[1:00:34] to
[1:00:46] drink he parted the Red
[1:00:48] Sea which was
[1:00:51] water I think he has control of water
[1:00:57] amen we've got nothing to
[1:01:01] drink he's wanting to reveal himself to
[1:01:04] us and he's already promised he's taken
[1:01:07] us to Canaan two options here either I'm
[1:01:11] not as thirsty as what I thought I was
[1:01:13] and I really don't need anything to
[1:01:14] drink right or he'll provide me
[1:01:18] something to drink because he says he
[1:01:20] wants to reveal himself to me this
[1:01:24] way that's the mindset of a real
[1:01:28] believer if I find myself in in
[1:01:33] situations that there is a promise of
[1:01:36] God
[1:01:37] for I want to get to the point that I
[1:01:40] default to the promise of
[1:01:42] God and count the external circumstances
[1:01:46] as a
[1:01:51] lie even carnally
[1:01:56] the scripture says I have never seen the
[1:01:59] righteous
[1:02:00] forsaken I have never seen God's
[1:02:03] children begging
[1:02:05] bread if I find myself in a situation
[1:02:09] we've read things in the message we've
[1:02:12] read thing in the scriptures to where
[1:02:14] the last days there not promised to be
[1:02:17] beds of roses for the
[1:02:21] believer if I find myself in a situation
[1:02:25] I can't buy food I don't have
[1:02:28] food I don't want to default to being an
[1:02:31] unbeliever and saying Lord what are you
[1:02:34] doing you clearly are don't have this
[1:02:35] under
[1:02:37] control I want to default to the promise
[1:02:40] of God I've never seen the righteous
[1:02:41] forsaken and I've never seen his
[1:02:43] children begging bread I'm not going
[1:02:45] begging for bread and that doesn't mean
[1:02:47] that you have to go begging on the
[1:02:49] street corner to violate that scripture
[1:02:50] I don't want to be begging him for bread
[1:02:53] I want to approach him Lord this is your
[1:02:56] scripture I don't have food I feel that
[1:03:00] I'm hungry and need to eat but I will
[1:03:02] deny my hunger pains as being true and I
[1:03:06] will accept your word as being
[1:03:09] true there's two ways God can answer
[1:03:12] that either you're not as hungry as you
[1:03:14] think you are and you don't need to
[1:03:16] eat or he will provide you
[1:03:20] food unless you renig on his promise and
[1:03:23] you start begging but because once you
[1:03:26] start begging you've now identified
[1:03:28] yourself as not a child of
[1:03:30] God and you've forfeited your
[1:03:36] promise I don't know how tight that it
[1:03:39] will
[1:03:40] get I don't know what carnal
[1:03:42] circumstances we may
[1:03:46] face but I'll tell you one thing I do
[1:03:49] know for a fact is
[1:03:50] leoda has set us up for failure for that
[1:03:54] time period because
[1:03:56] Leia programs into us that we got to
[1:04:00] have three meals a
[1:04:02] day and if we don't have three meals a
[1:04:05] day we're
[1:04:06] starving we might
[1:04:10] die I'll remind you that Jesus went 40
[1:04:19] days Jesus went 40 days with no food and
[1:04:23] he was a man that was not some super
[1:04:27] anointing that was a man that went 40
[1:04:30] days without food brother brandom says
[1:04:33] you can't do that without water but you
[1:04:35] can do it without
[1:04:46] food you say well that's really carnal
[1:04:49] it may be and it may never manifest I
[1:04:53] don't know
[1:04:57] but I do know one
[1:04:58] thing if the squeeze gets really squeezy
[1:05:02] and really Pinchy and I don't have
[1:05:05] natural food to eat I am not going to
[1:05:08] turn into an
[1:05:10] unbeliever and I'm not going to beg them
[1:05:13] to release the hold on my debit card so
[1:05:15] I can buy food and I'm not going to be
[1:05:18] begging my heavenly father to feed me
[1:05:22] the birds don't do that
[1:05:26] the birds don't do that and he takes
[1:05:28] care of them how much more so a child of
[1:05:35] God so we have external situations pop
[1:05:38] up to test the promises of
[1:05:42] God I would venture to say the farther
[1:05:45] along the line we go the more external s
[1:05:48] situations we're going to find oursel in
[1:05:51] testing the word of God right down to
[1:05:54] our daily
[1:05:57] livings write down food to eat water to
[1:06:01] drink clothes to put
[1:06:06] on I hope I'm wrong about all
[1:06:10] that but I've just read way too many
[1:06:14] quotes and I've seen too many scriptures
[1:06:17] and I've seen the pattern before us in
[1:06:19] the
[1:06:20] scriptures I don't want to come to that
[1:06:23] point in time and all of a sudden
[1:06:26] forget everything God's done for
[1:06:28] me forget how he's provided before let
[1:06:32] me ask you this
[1:06:35] Saints how do you think you get food
[1:06:38] right now
[1:06:41] anyhow your debit
[1:06:44] card you think that's what's sustaining
[1:06:47] you is your debit card your
[1:06:50] ability to swipe a card and get
[1:06:52] something what happens if your card gets
[1:06:54] taken away and you have to use cash what
[1:06:58] happens if you don't have cash and I'll
[1:07:00] remind you how did you get that cash to
[1:07:02] begin with you say well I went and work
[1:07:03] for it I can go to work and get money
[1:07:05] and buy who gave you the strength to go
[1:07:07] to
[1:07:11] work who gave you the strength to get
[1:07:13] out of bed and even who gave you that
[1:07:16] job who gave you the strength to get out
[1:07:17] of bed and go to that job see it becomes
[1:07:21] so easy to us that we forget we think
[1:07:24] we're in control
[1:07:26] we think we we can sustain
[1:07:32] ourselves without the grace of God to
[1:07:34] get us out of bed every morning we
[1:07:37] couldn't even go to work to make a
[1:07:39] living to put money in the bank to swipe
[1:07:41] the card to get the
[1:07:44] food how about we start depending on him
[1:07:47] now rather than wait till things get
[1:07:49] back why don't we recognize his face in
[1:07:52] our life now rather than crying for his
[1:07:55] hand
[1:08:04] later and the children of Israel said
[1:08:06] unto him would to God we had died by the
[1:08:08] hand of the land by the hand of the Lord
[1:08:10] in the land of Egypt when we set by the
[1:08:13] flesh pots and when we did eat and we
[1:08:16] had bread to the full for ye have
[1:08:18] brought us forth into this Wilderness to
[1:08:21] kill this whole assembly with hunger
[1:08:25] so they had a water problem Moses heals
[1:08:28] God heals the water through Moses few
[1:08:31] days later they got a food
[1:08:34] problem you're trying to kill us all
[1:08:36] with
[1:08:38] Hunger god reigns Mana
[1:08:41] down chapter 17 and all the congregation
[1:08:44] of the children of Israel journeyed from
[1:08:46] the Wilderness of sin after their
[1:08:47] Journey according to the Commandment of
[1:08:49] God and pitched in
[1:08:52] radm and there was no water for the
[1:08:54] people to drink we're back to another
[1:08:56] water problem Lord have mercy what are
[1:08:58] we going to do
[1:09:00] maybe the one who fixed the water
[1:09:03] problem before we'll fix it
[1:09:06] again and we're just going to praise God
[1:09:08] for him fixing that and believe that
[1:09:10] he's going to fix that nope verse two
[1:09:13] wherefore the people did chide with
[1:09:15] Moses and said give us water that we may
[1:09:18] drink and Moses said unto them why ched
[1:09:21] ye with me wherefore do you tempt the
[1:09:23] Lord and the people thirsted there for
[1:09:25] water and the people murmured against
[1:09:27] Moses and said wherefore is this that
[1:09:29] thou Hast brought us up out of Egypt to
[1:09:31] kill us and our children and our cattle
[1:09:34] with
[1:09:38] thirst Moses's position position is
[1:09:43] amazing he goes from savior one day
[1:09:49] to murderer the next and then he's
[1:09:53] savior the next day like I don't know
[1:09:56] how many masks that he puts on and off
[1:10:00] but it's
[1:10:01] amazing he's our Prophet he's our savior
[1:10:05] he's trying to kill us no he's not he's
[1:10:07] our Prophet he's our savior he's trying
[1:10:09] to kill
[1:10:17] us Exodus
[1:10:20] 19 and Moses went down from the mountain
[1:10:23] to the people and Sanctified the people
[1:10:25] and they washed their clothes and he
[1:10:27] said unto the people be ready against
[1:10:29] the third day so theyve made it through
[1:10:31] these problems they finally came to the
[1:10:33] Mount where God says this is where I was
[1:10:36] going to bring you all to worship this
[1:10:37] was my plan this is where I'm going to
[1:10:39] reveal myself to you Moses s Sanctified
[1:10:42] them washes their clothes be ready in 3
[1:10:46] days and it came to pass when the third
[1:10:49] day in the morning that there were
[1:10:51] Thunders and Lightnings and a thick
[1:10:53] Cloud upon the mount and the voice of
[1:10:54] the trumpet SE exceeding loud so that
[1:10:57] all the people that was in the camp
[1:10:58] trembled and Moses brought forth the
[1:11:01] people out of the camp to meet with
[1:11:08] God the whole
[1:11:12] purpose for God doing anything that he's
[1:11:16] done through this journey through this
[1:11:18] Exodus is now here we have finally made
[1:11:23] it to the purpose
[1:11:30] and they stood at nether part of the
[1:11:32] mountain and mount Sia was altogether on
[1:11:35] a smoke because the Lord descended upon
[1:11:38] it with fire and the smoke thereof
[1:11:40] descend ascended as the smoke of a
[1:11:42] furnace and the whole Mount quaked
[1:11:45] greatly Exodus 20:8 and all the people
[1:11:49] saw the thunderings and the Lightnings
[1:11:51] and the noise of the trumpet and the
[1:11:53] mountain smoking and when the people saw
[1:11:57] it they removed and stood a far
[1:12:04] off the question is
[1:12:09] why
[1:12:11] why when God said I'm going to do all of
[1:12:15] this for you and I'm going to reveal
[1:12:17] myself to you in all of these ways and
[1:12:19] the purpose is to get you to this one
[1:12:22] location so that I personally can come
[1:12:24] down and reveal myself to you and I will
[1:12:28] be your God and you will be my people
[1:12:31] and you will know me as my as I am known
[1:12:34] and you will know my Essence and my
[1:12:36] character and you will know me as your
[1:12:38] Shepherd and provider and
[1:12:41] victory there won't be any more
[1:12:43] middleman of Moses it'll just be me and
[1:12:47] you
[1:12:49] am and they've came through all of
[1:12:53] this and he keeps his word and he shows
[1:12:59] up no doubt about it the people did not
[1:13:02] back up and say I ain't going he ain't
[1:13:05] there they knew he was
[1:13:12] there they removed and stood a far
[1:13:17] off the question is why would you do
[1:13:20] such a rash
[1:13:23] thing the the answer is because when
[1:13:26] they were down in Egypt they weren't
[1:13:28] seeking his face they were seeking his
[1:13:32] hand so now that he finally shows up
[1:13:35] face to
[1:13:36] face they don't want anything to do with
[1:13:47] it are we seeking his face or are we
[1:13:50] seeking his
[1:13:51] hand if we spend every day of Our Lives
[1:13:54] seeking his hand to fix our problems
[1:13:56] when he shows up face to face we're not
[1:13:58] going to have nothing to do with the
[1:14:02] Saints it's going to be too
[1:14:05] scary but if we will seek his face from
[1:14:08] the
[1:14:10] beginning if we will seek to know him as
[1:14:13] he
[1:14:15] is not just in his delivering power not
[1:14:18] just in his problem fixing but if we
[1:14:21] will seek to know his purpose in our
[1:14:23] life and why are you doing this with me
[1:14:27] right
[1:14:28] now and I'm yielding to it even though I
[1:14:31] might not understand what you're doing I
[1:14:32] know you're doing something and I know
[1:14:34] you're revealing something to me if we
[1:14:36] will approach him with that mindset when
[1:14:40] he finally does pull the curtain back
[1:14:42] from our vision and allow us to see what
[1:14:46] he's been doing all along we're not
[1:14:48] going to run off
[1:14:50] scared we're going to worship him as he
[1:14:53] is and we're going to draw draw nigh to
[1:14:56] him and we're going to draw closer to
[1:14:58] him and we're going to say I'm going up
[1:15:01] into that mountain even if it would kill
[1:15:04] me because this is the purpose though he
[1:15:07] slay me yet I'll serve
[1:15:14] him we'll never have that
[1:15:19] confession if we continue on the hamster
[1:15:22] well Lord I got a problem with you f fix
[1:15:25] it Lord I got a problem will you fix it
[1:15:28] Lord I've got a problem will you fix it
[1:15:29] Lord this is a really bad
[1:15:31] one can you fix this
[1:15:35] one if we'll get on the hamster whe of
[1:15:38] Lord here's the
[1:15:40] situation what are you doing would you
[1:15:43] please reveal to me what you're doing
[1:15:46] would you please reveal to me what
[1:15:48] you're trying to accomplish maybe it's
[1:15:51] just you wanting to get me on my knees
[1:15:54] and ask you to reveal yourself to me in
[1:15:56] a way that I've never known you
[1:16:01] before it's a scary
[1:16:04] thought scripture says it's a scary
[1:16:07] thing it's a fearful thing to fall into
[1:16:10] the hand of a living
[1:16:13] God it's a fearful thing to pray that
[1:16:16] prayer Pray that prayer make me more
[1:16:18] like
[1:16:19] you with this understanding
[1:16:25] pray that prayer and really mean
[1:16:28] it you know I am convinced that God in
[1:16:31] his Mercy to
[1:16:33] us blocks our intellectual capacity when
[1:16:38] we start praying like that because if we
[1:16:42] intellectually knew what we were asking
[1:16:45] for we would never utter those words
[1:16:47] carnally we would never have the courage
[1:16:49] to do it it is only by a supernatural
[1:16:52] anointing for him to come down and block
[1:16:54] our brain waves and pray Lord make me
[1:16:57] more like
[1:17:00] you there is no carnal person that's
[1:17:04] going to pray that prayer that is a
[1:17:06] supernatural
[1:17:11] anointing because when we pray pray that
[1:17:14] he
[1:17:15] will am and it'll be the very next day
[1:17:20] and our response will be Lord what are
[1:17:23] you doing
[1:17:26] why are you trying to kill
[1:17:32] me it's because he's restored our
[1:17:34] intellects to us and now we're
[1:17:37] recognizing what we signed up
[1:17:44] for we're all very familiar with that
[1:17:47] story with that passage of
[1:17:51] scripture been preached on thousands of
[1:17:54] times no
[1:17:57] doubt but I don't want to leave it
[1:17:59] thousands of years
[1:18:02] ago Luke
[1:18:04] 7:26 but what ye went out to see this is
[1:18:08] a question Jesus asked them what did you
[1:18:11] go out to see speaking of John the
[1:18:13] Baptist a
[1:18:15] prophet yay I say unto you and much more
[1:18:18] than a Prophet this is
[1:18:21] he of whom it is written
[1:18:25] behold I send my messenger before thy
[1:18:29] face which shall prepare thy way before
[1:18:37] the you say well that's Malachi 3 that's
[1:18:40] not Malachi 4 you're
[1:18:45] right but there was a voice that came
[1:18:47] down on the Ohio River in 1933 and
[1:18:50] said
[1:18:52] as meaning the same
[1:18:56] way that John the Baptist foran my first
[1:19:00] coming your message will forerun my
[1:19:06] second so in order to know how the
[1:19:08] second forerunning and the purpose of
[1:19:10] the second
[1:19:12] forerunning is going to be we have to
[1:19:15] now go back and look at John the Baptist
[1:19:18] ministry which is defined in the
[1:19:21] scriptures behold I send my messenger
[1:19:27] before my great demonstration of the
[1:19:29] power of my hand to deliver you from all
[1:19:32] of your problems and give you a good
[1:19:34] easy
[1:19:35] life
[1:19:39] not one
[1:19:41] thing behold I send my messenger before
[1:19:47] my face shows up to prepare your hearts
[1:19:53] to receive my face
[1:19:56] as John the Baptist foran my first
[1:19:59] coming your
[1:20:01] message will forerun my second what is
[1:20:05] his what is his
[1:20:07] message what is this Forerunner to do
[1:20:11] what was brother Brandon's
[1:20:14] purpose Divine
[1:20:18] healing prayer lines
[1:20:28] no to
[1:20:31] prepare me and you to see the face of
[1:20:42] God 17th person that I baptized all at
[1:20:46] once I heard something say look up and I
[1:20:47] looked and here come that Pillar of Fire
[1:20:49] circling down out of the heaven stood
[1:20:51] right over where I was at and said as
[1:20:53] John the Baptist was sent to forerun the
[1:20:55] first coming of Christ your message will
[1:20:58] forerun the second coming of Christ what
[1:21:01] happened after John the Baptist for
[1:21:04] ran what happened did not the very face
[1:21:08] of God show
[1:21:10] up what do we think
[1:21:13] happened after brother brandham forerun
[1:21:15] the second coming of Christ did not the
[1:21:19] very face of God show up we've got a
[1:21:21] picture of it
[1:21:23] Saints the very face of God shows
[1:21:26] up not so that we can continue to seek
[1:21:30] his
[1:21:31] hand not that we can continue to just
[1:21:34] seek his
[1:21:36] hand so that we can recognize there's
[1:21:39] been a
[1:21:42] change there's been a change I'm not on
[1:21:47] this Earth to just seek his hand to rid
[1:21:50] me of my problems I'm on this Earth to
[1:21:53] now seek his face which is
[1:22:00] present Psalm 28 a Psalm of David the
[1:22:03] Lord is my light and my salvation Whom
[1:22:05] Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of
[1:22:07] my life of whom shall I be afraid when
[1:22:09] the wicked even my enemies and my foes
[1:22:11] come up against me to eat up my flesh
[1:22:13] they stumbled and F fell though a host
[1:22:16] should encamp against me my heart shall
[1:22:18] not fear though War rise against me in
[1:22:20] this will I be confident one thing have
[1:22:22] I desired of the Lord that I will will
[1:22:24] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[1:22:26] of the Lord all of my days guess what if
[1:22:29] you're in his house you're going to see
[1:22:31] more than his
[1:22:32] hand this is the rapture scripture how
[1:22:35] many wants to go in a
[1:22:38] Rapture this is the rapture scripture
[1:22:44] Amen to behold the beauty of the Lord
[1:22:48] and to inquire in his Temple for in the
[1:22:51] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:22:52] Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[1:22:55] shall he hide me I want to read this
[1:22:57] again for in the time of trouble for in
[1:22:59] the time of trouble for in the time of
[1:23:03] trouble expect trouble right trouble
[1:23:07] should not be
[1:23:10] unexpected if we are in a rapturing day
[1:23:14] in a rapturing age in a rapturing
[1:23:16] condition expect
[1:23:22] trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion
[1:23:25] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[1:23:27] hide me he shall set me upon a rock and
[1:23:31] now shall mine head be lifted up above
[1:23:33] mine enemies round about me therefore
[1:23:36] will I offer in his Tabernacle
[1:23:37] sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will
[1:23:40] sing praises unto the Lord this is not
[1:23:43] all things got bad I don't believe
[1:23:45] anymore this is things are Troublesome
[1:23:49] he's hiding me somewhere you all can't
[1:23:51] get to me he's hiding me somewhere the
[1:23:54] the world can't get to me he's hiding me
[1:23:56] somewhere The Squeeze can't get to
[1:24:02] me and while he's doing that I'm not
[1:24:05] there begging for him to show me his
[1:24:09] hand and deliver me I'm there I'm
[1:24:11] singing praises to his name because in
[1:24:15] spite of all of this I know he has
[1:24:18] hidden me someplace that's untouchable
[1:24:26] I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of
[1:24:29] Joy I I will sing yeah I will sing
[1:24:31] praises unto the Lord here O Lord when I
[1:24:34] cry with my voice have mercy also upon
[1:24:36] me and answer
[1:24:37] [Music]
[1:24:39] me remember this is the ma the Rapture
[1:24:45] scripture David is confessing all of
[1:24:49] this he's proclaiming this is fact he's
[1:24:52] saying all of this is happening
[1:24:55] this is what's going to happen it's
[1:24:59] undisputable but you know what there's a
[1:25:01] big difference between David and Israel
[1:25:03] and David gives us the key in verse
[1:25:07] eight because when thou said seek ye my
[1:25:12] face my heart said unto me thy face Lord
[1:25:16] will I Seek You Want To Be hid in his
[1:25:19] Pavilion you want to be hid in his
[1:25:21] secret Tabernacle
[1:25:24] respond to the call in your heart that's
[1:25:27] driving you and pulling you now to seek
[1:25:31] his face you don't want any problems at
[1:25:34] the river seek his face now you don't
[1:25:37] want any problems during the squeeze
[1:25:39] seek his face now you don't want to be
[1:25:41] unwavered when the doctor hands you the
[1:25:42] bad report seek his face
[1:25:45] now you don't want to be unwavered when
[1:25:47] the panty dries up seek his face
[1:25:51] now you don't want to be unwavered when
[1:25:53] there's no gas for the car seek his face
[1:25:56] now if there's no gas in the car and I
[1:25:58] don't have means to put gas in the car
[1:26:00] that simply means I don't need to go
[1:26:01] anywhere because if I needed to go to
[1:26:04] somewhere he would put gas in the
[1:26:12] car or I'm just crazy for believing
[1:26:15] that but if he can pick Phillip up and
[1:26:18] put him somewhere that he needs to go
[1:26:21] without gasoline surely he can put gas
[1:26:23] in the car when I need to go
[1:26:27] somewhere unless I'm not supposed to go
[1:26:31] there I'm not going to be pay praying
[1:26:33] and begging God to put gas in my car so
[1:26:35] I can go world go entertain myself with
[1:26:37] the world that's
[1:26:40] right remember you have to have faith
[1:26:48] first brother R says it's the same faith
[1:26:51] that will take you in the Rapture is the
[1:26:53] same Faith you go go out and start your
[1:26:55] car with I'm not making this stuff up
[1:26:59] Saints same
[1:27:01] principle if I need to go he'll put gas
[1:27:05] in the
[1:27:05] car if I need to go he'll change my
[1:27:10] atoms I'm not in control of this he's in
[1:27:13] control of
[1:27:15] this David gives us the
[1:27:19] secret of why when everything goes
[1:27:21] sideways he says
[1:27:24] my head's above my
[1:27:27] enemies I'm in a secret place with God
[1:27:29] you all can't touch
[1:27:31] me I'm looking at his Beauty there's
[1:27:34] chaos all around me isn't he wonderful
[1:27:36] isn't he
[1:27:37] beautiful David did not arrive at that
[1:27:40] point except he says when my heart said
[1:27:45] seek his face I sought his face
[1:27:56] I hope we're catching what the Lord's
[1:27:58] been doing in our myth
[1:28:05] Saints we have left the age of just
[1:28:08] seeking the hand of
[1:28:14] God our prayer
[1:28:16] lives should not just be seeking the
[1:28:19] hand of God anymore s we are too far
[1:28:23] down the road
[1:28:25] if you believe an ounce of just what's
[1:28:28] coming over this local pull pit you have
[1:28:31] to recognize that God is calling us
[1:28:35] higher I believe God will fix my
[1:28:38] problems I will ask God to fix my
[1:28:41] problems but I am still going to believe
[1:28:43] him and I am still going to worship him
[1:28:45] if he don't fix my
[1:28:49] problems amen I am not on this Earth for
[1:28:52] myself I am bought with a price I am his
[1:28:56] to do with as he so
[1:28:58] chooses he has told me I am going to
[1:29:01] reveal myself to you as Lord not just as
[1:29:05] God
[1:29:06] Almighty I've said be it unto me
[1:29:09] according to your word I have said I'm
[1:29:12] signing up for you to use me to manifest
[1:29:16] to Satan that I won't fall like the
[1:29:18] first Eve that's not signing up for
[1:29:20] everything to be easy that's signing up
[1:29:22] to be used of God
[1:29:25] you're not going to sign up for that if
[1:29:27] you're just seeking the hand of God the
[1:29:29] world seeks the hand of
[1:29:31] God constantly and I'm not faulting them
[1:29:35] for that I say God help them in every
[1:29:38] way that you can help them but I'm not
[1:29:40] the world and I'm not just going to seek
[1:29:43] his hand I'm going to seek his face I
[1:29:45] want to know him as he has known and I I
[1:29:49] want to to to Define what I mean when I
[1:29:52] say Seek his face I his face is his
[1:29:55] person his his face is his person it is
[1:29:58] the very essence it's the very character
[1:30:00] of God it's the very truth of
[1:30:08] God going to close with these last
[1:30:10] couple
[1:30:13] quotes brother Ram says he was going to
[1:30:16] take them away from that old muddy water
[1:30:19] of Egypt and give them Living Waters out
[1:30:21] of a
[1:30:22] rock he couldn't do it until he made an
[1:30:26] approach they just couldn't do it by
[1:30:29] desire there had to be a provided
[1:30:33] approach they was going to see the Red
[1:30:36] Sea opened they was going to see the
[1:30:38] Miracles take place before they could
[1:30:41] see this thing they had to come through
[1:30:43] God's provided
[1:30:45] approach you see it Christian it's not
[1:30:48] because they desired to see it not
[1:30:51] because you want to see something happen
[1:30:53] if you want to see whether Christ is
[1:30:55] right or not come through God's approach
[1:30:59] to him then you'll know and this is
[1:31:01] where I really want to emphasize the the
[1:31:04] title of seeking God for
[1:31:09] God not seeking God for
[1:31:13] ourselves but seeking God for
[1:31:17] God if you don't want to get wrecked up
[1:31:20] in life quit pretending to be a
[1:31:22] Christian cuz you're going to find
[1:31:24] yourself wrecked up out here somewhere
[1:31:27] if I started to go home this afternoon
[1:31:29] and I cut across the field I'd find
[1:31:30] myself sunk down in a mud puddle
[1:31:32] somewhere the highway has an approach to
[1:31:36] Jeffersonville and I must go the way of
[1:31:39] the highway it's easy running if I'll
[1:31:41] just get on the
[1:31:43] road am die out to self come through the
[1:31:49] blood of Christ then you can approach
[1:31:52] the father and he will give you the Holy
[1:31:54] Spirit that'll make you a Believer
[1:31:58] because it's not you that's believing
[1:32:00] anymore it's the holy spirit in
[1:32:03] you somebody in here tonight has got to
[1:32:06] quit asking God to fill me with your
[1:32:09] Holy Spirit fill me with your Holy
[1:32:10] Spirit fill me with your Holy Spirit and
[1:32:13] get on the approach to God get on the
[1:32:15] way he has provided how about you die
[1:32:18] out to yourself and then ask him to fill
[1:32:21] you with his holy spirit
[1:32:27] don't ask him to fill you with your with
[1:32:29] his holy spirit when you still got your
[1:32:31] spirit in
[1:32:33] there brother Brandon says you've got to
[1:32:36] come in God's provided
[1:32:38] way and his provided way is death to
[1:32:44] self then and only then can he fill you
[1:32:48] with his Holy Spirit and then and only
[1:32:50] then can you truly believe the words of
[1:32:52] God because it's it's not you with a
[1:32:55] mental intellectual conception trying to
[1:32:58] believe something or trying to work
[1:32:59] yourself up into something but now it is
[1:33:02] he himself God in you believing his own
[1:33:09] word there's young people in here that
[1:33:12] needs to die to
[1:33:15] yourself and follow the word of God and
[1:33:17] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:33:20] quit trying to have God have preeminence
[1:33:22] in your life when you have't came God's
[1:33:25] provided way repent be baptized in the
[1:33:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then
[1:33:31] and only then do you have claims on the
[1:33:35] promise repentance death to self I'm
[1:33:39] wrong your word is
[1:33:42] Right you've got to start there before
[1:33:44] you can get anywhere with
[1:33:47] God there's marriages in here this
[1:33:50] evening that need some death to self
[1:33:54] quit asking God to fix your marriage
[1:33:56] when you won't die to
[1:33:58] yourself it's not God's approach it's
[1:34:01] not God's provided
[1:34:04] way there are job situations in here
[1:34:07] that needs fixed this evening quit
[1:34:09] asking God to fix your job situation
[1:34:12] when you won't die to
[1:34:21] self the approach to God is death to
[1:34:27] self whatever the situation is Don't Be
[1:34:31] invoking the Name of Jesus Christ over
[1:34:33] top of it when you won't first die to
[1:34:36] yourself that is not God's approach that
[1:34:39] is not God's way he has no obligation
[1:34:41] for
[1:34:46] that look before they could see Miracles
[1:34:48] they had to come the provided approach
[1:34:51] and before you can ever become a
[1:34:52] partaker of the Blessed Heavenly calling
[1:34:54] you have to come through God's provided
[1:34:56] approach not self-
[1:35:00] sustaining not saying I got this I can
[1:35:03] handle this it's a good day things are
[1:35:06] okay I'm in control not self- sustaining
[1:35:09] that is not God's provided
[1:35:12] way not
[1:35:15] intellectually but death to
[1:35:19] yourself and a rebirth again in Jesus
[1:35:23] Christ through the offering of his blood
[1:35:25] am
[1:35:29] amen he
[1:35:31] says quit pretending you're a Christian
[1:35:35] when you're not you're going to find
[1:35:37] yourself wrecked up and if you want to
[1:35:41] be a Christian a real Christian a born
[1:35:44] again Christian die to yourself
[1:35:48] first come God's provided way
[1:35:58] come through the
[1:35:59] blood that was offered for
[1:36:06] you Saints I'm concerned we've got so
[1:36:10] intellectual that we think we can get
[1:36:12] somewhere with god without coming
[1:36:13] through the
[1:36:16] blood I'm afraid we've got so
[1:36:18] intellectual in this leot toan age that
[1:36:20] we forgot that God himself took on a
[1:36:23] human body and shed his blood for our
[1:36:28] penalty I'm afraid that we have got so
[1:36:31] intellectual that we as brother brandom
[1:36:33] says we'll come and have a dry-eyed
[1:36:35] confession and expect God to fill us
[1:36:37] with his Holy Spirit and change our
[1:36:39] being and change everything within us
[1:36:41] and make everything okay and we won't
[1:36:43] even acknowledge the fact that he hung
[1:36:45] and died on a cross for
[1:36:50] me have we got so deep in the message
[1:36:54] that we forget God took on the shape of
[1:36:56] a man and paid our penalty and suffered
[1:37:00] and
[1:37:01] died and we're trying to be a believer
[1:37:04] and go in a Rapture and have the Holy
[1:37:06] Ghost and be the bride and we won't even
[1:37:08] acknowledge what happened on
[1:37:14] Calvary that he died for us surely if he
[1:37:17] died for me I can die to
[1:37:20] myself and say not my will but thine be
[1:37:23] done and if I need to repent and I need
[1:37:26] to be baptized in your name before I can
[1:37:29] lay hold on a promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:31] that's the least that I can
[1:37:33] do but we get so intellectual we think
[1:37:36] we can skip the sacrifice that was paid
[1:37:38] for us and we can say God sent a prophet
[1:37:41] and now everything's okay nonsense he
[1:37:44] says quit pretending that you're a
[1:37:47] Christian until there is something
[1:37:50] within you not mentally but something
[1:37:53] within your soul that can say yay and
[1:37:55] amen to every word of God you're you've
[1:37:59] not even started and it's not going to
[1:38:01] work he says you're going to find
[1:38:03] yourself wrecked up we've got people
[1:38:05] that needs to quit pretending your
[1:38:07] message Believers but when something
[1:38:10] goes sideways and you can't figure out
[1:38:11] what brother Brandon mean between these
[1:38:13] two quotes all of a sudden he's wrong
[1:38:15] and he's not the prophet and that you've
[1:38:18] got a better
[1:38:20] idea quit pretending
[1:38:24] how about we first come to death to self
[1:38:26] and acknowledge the fact I'm not self-
[1:38:28] sustaining and I don't even have a
[1:38:30] thought coming and there's no way that I
[1:38:32] can interpret the scriptures to myself
[1:38:35] and that I've got to have a angel from
[1:38:37] God to come and even tell me who I am I
[1:38:40] don't even know who I am if he don't
[1:38:42] send me an angel to tell
[1:38:46] me he says may they raise their hands
[1:38:49] not to me but to you and in doing so say
[1:38:51] from this day henceforth Lord I am
[1:38:54] taking myself up to the river of

[1:39:15] approach him in the right
[1:39:19] way I'm plunging myself beneath to lose

[1:39:23] habits and my uncleanness and my
[1:39:26] thoughts all my indifference my quarrels
[1:39:28] my argues my tempers and all these
[1:39:30] things I'm just going to plunge them
[1:39:31] right beneath the flood that when I come

[1:39:36] that I
[1:39:38] should clean ready with a pure heart are
[1:39:44] you struggling feeling that you're clean
[1:39:47] this evening are you struggling feeling
[1:39:49] that you're ready to leave this
[1:39:51] Dimension are you struggling knowing
[1:39:53] your heart is not pure quit pretending
[1:39:56] to be something you're not and die to

[1:40:24] man is I still want to love them see the
[1:40:28] world can't do
[1:40:30] this I want to enter into a fellowship
[1:40:33] with thee until I feel to my enemies
[1:40:37] like you
[1:40:39] did the world can't do this the world
[1:40:43] can't love their enemies humans can't
[1:40:45] love their enemies it's not in us to
[1:40:47] love our enemies we can barely love our
[1:40:50] brothers and sisters when they say
[1:40:51] something wrong about us that they
[1:40:52] didn't even know is
[1:40:55] wrong how about we have a little death
[1:40:57] to
[1:40:58] self and say any bad thing that's been
[1:41:01] said about me there's probably some
[1:41:02] truth to
[1:41:04] it that's
[1:41:07] true and before the church will ever be
[1:41:10] able to see a resurrected
[1:41:12] power I'm closing real shortly just in a
[1:41:14] couple minutes stay with
[1:41:21] me before the church will ever be able
[1:41:23] to see a resurrected power who wants to
[1:41:25] see a resurrected
[1:41:27] power 50% of you want to see a
[1:41:29] resurrected power praise the
[1:41:33] Lord I'm not trying to work you up but
[1:41:36] let's say Amen to the word of God who
[1:41:38] wants to see a resurrected
[1:41:42] power before you can ever see before I
[1:41:45] can ever see a new ministry take place
[1:41:48] myself before you can ever enter into a
[1:41:51] new fellowship with God there has to got
[1:41:54] to be a self dest self crucifixion am
[1:41:59] amen how many wants to see the third
[1:42:02] pole in your
[1:42:05] life where's the self-
[1:42:08] crucifixion the third pole in the
[1:42:10] prophet's life did not come without
[1:42:12] self-
[1:42:13] crucifixion how do we think we're going
[1:42:15] to have the third pole the fullness of
[1:42:17] the word in our life the power of the
[1:42:19] spoken word on our tongue if we don't
[1:42:22] come through a self crucifixion and we
[1:42:24] still keep going through life pretending
[1:42:26] that we're something we're
[1:42:29] not and we keep going through life that
[1:42:32] our entire prayer life is just Lord help
[1:42:35] me Lord help me God have mercy God help
[1:42:37] me God save
[1:42:40] me seeking his hand and not his face
[1:42:53] I wonder if we seek his hand so much and
[1:42:56] we pray for Revival if he would send it
[1:42:59] if we would welcome
[1:43:01] it I wonder if maybe we have the wrong
[1:43:04] idea of a
[1:43:06] Revival and I wonder if our idea of a
[1:43:08] Revival is God coming in with his hand
[1:43:10] and fixing all of our
[1:43:13] problems and getting us out of here
[1:43:15] because we're tired of suffering and
[1:43:17] things are getting
[1:43:22] harder and the economy is about to
[1:43:26] crash and the list goes on and on and
[1:43:30] on is that what motivates us
[1:43:34] Saints are we
[1:43:37] motivated just to get out of here why do
[1:43:41] we want out of
[1:43:44] here if you're a Believer and you get
[1:43:47] out of here you're going to see his
[1:43:51] face I hope that won't be scary for
[1:43:55] us I hope we can see his face now before
[1:43:58] we see his face then and that we can get
[1:44:01] comfortable with
[1:44:11] that no wonder belly Graham says we
[1:44:13] can't have a
[1:44:17] Revival well you can't have a Revival
[1:44:19] just on
[1:44:21] theology you you've got to have an
[1:44:23] old-fashioned god-sent sin killing
[1:44:26] Revival that gets people up to the Altar
[1:44:29] and they die out to self and to
[1:44:32] sin are we so message that we've passed
[1:44:37] that are we so deepen our teaching that
[1:44:40] we'll bypass
[1:44:44] that I don't care if it's a Revival just
[1:44:48] for a new birth or if it's a Revival for
[1:44:51] God to reveal something something more
[1:44:53] in his word to you it's going to come
[1:44:55] the same way a sin killing death to self
[1:44:59] Revival
[1:45:01] first you you want to know the intricate
[1:45:05] workings of the Rapture
[1:45:08] process it's going to come through a sin
[1:45:10] killing death to
[1:45:13] self you're on the other end of the
[1:45:15] spectrum and you just need a
[1:45:18] savior it's going to come through a sin
[1:45:20] killing death to self the process and
[1:45:23] the approach to God will never
[1:45:30] change then we can have a Revival but
[1:45:32] just to stand and say I accept Christ as
[1:45:36] a personal Savior and sat down that's
[1:45:39] mental okay let's update it a couple
[1:45:42] decades just to stand and say God sent a
[1:45:45] prophet that's
[1:45:47] mental the devil knows God sent a
[1:45:50] prophet he is not saved and he is not
[1:45:54] okay the devil believes more
[1:45:57] than most people I won't say that the
[1:46:01] devil believes God sent a
[1:46:05] prophet and he's not wishy-washy about
[1:46:07] it
[1:46:10] either he doesn't go back and forth when
[1:46:13] he can't understand some
[1:46:15] quotes the devil knows who the angel was
[1:46:23] brother brandom is trying to get us away
[1:46:25] from that mental
[1:46:28] conception the trouble of it is you're
[1:46:32] asking people to stand up and accept
[1:46:35] Christ as my personal testimony stand up
[1:46:39] like that and that's all they know about
[1:46:41] it worked up under a little mental
[1:46:43] enthusiasm the next thing you know it's
[1:46:49] gone the only way that man will ever
[1:46:52] first stay is for him to lay down there
[1:46:55] and die out to himself and be reborned
[1:46:59] again by the spirit of God and filled
[1:47:01] with the Holy
[1:47:04] Ghost one way one prescription has it
[1:47:07] changed since the day of
[1:47:10] Pentecost don't think that we're going
[1:47:12] to come to this age and Proclaim and
[1:47:14] testify we know who Malachi for is and
[1:47:17] we're okay no where's the death to self
[1:47:20] where's the indwelling of the Holy
[1:47:24] Spirit where's the real New Birth not
[1:47:29] pretending I'm afraid we've watered down
[1:47:32] the holy spirit so much we will take
[1:47:34] that quote where brother brandom says
[1:47:36] the holy spirit is just a temporal gift
[1:47:38] to get you through this life the real
[1:47:40] gift is that soul in there and I believe
[1:47:42] that and I say yay and amen but I want
[1:47:44] to remind you what he said the Holy
[1:47:47] Spirit was given to you to get you
[1:47:49] through this
[1:47:51] life you are not going going to get
[1:47:53] through this life without the Holy
[1:47:57] Spirit we should seek it desperately
[1:48:00] every day of our life unless you don't
[1:48:04] want to get through this
[1:48:06] life you think that you have the
[1:48:09] capability to withstand Leota and
[1:48:13] however million demons were loosed on
[1:48:15] this age on the Bride of Jesus Christ in
[1:48:18] your own capacity without the Holy
[1:48:20] Spirit and say oh well I've got the real
[1:48:22] gift of Soul inside I don't it's
[1:48:24] temporal I'll take it or leave it no
[1:48:26] you're going to find yourself in a house
[1:48:28] with the padded walls is where you're
[1:48:29] going to find yourself wrecked up
[1:48:31] pretending to be a Christian you
[1:48:34] desperately need the Holy Spirit I
[1:48:36] desperately need the Holy Spirit every
[1:48:38] day of my life just to get through
[1:48:44] life don't water down the spirit of God
[1:48:47] there was a life that was given for that
[1:48:50] the life of God was given for that the
[1:48:52] life of God was given to release that
[1:48:55] Spirit on me and you just so we could
[1:48:57] get through this
[1:49:03] life don't stand and say God sent a
[1:49:06] prophet and put an equal sign between
[1:49:10] that that is not the equivalent of
[1:49:13] having the Holy
[1:49:15] Spirit death to self to where you lay
[1:49:18] there and you die to yourself not only
[1:49:21] die to yourself brother brand says you
[1:49:23] die and you rot away so much there's not
[1:49:26] even a chance of
[1:49:28] Rejuvenation not just death but to
[1:49:31] completely run away to
[1:49:39] yourself all you say I went down there
[1:49:42] and there's a lot of power brother the
[1:49:45] whole floor was dancing the
[1:49:47] spirit and not enough Faith to hell to
[1:49:50] think
[1:49:54] you call that
[1:49:56] power that's not
[1:49:59] power that's
[1:50:02] blessings there's a lot of difference
[1:50:05] between blessings and
[1:50:09] power I want to say there is a lot of
[1:50:13] difference there is a lot of difference
[1:50:17] between the hand of God and the face of
[1:50:20] God the hand of God will alleviate your
[1:50:23] temporal
[1:50:25] situation the face of God will change
[1:50:27] your Eternal destination and it will
[1:50:30] change your entire life as the musicians
[1:50:32] would come this
[1:50:37] evening let's Stand Together
[1:50:56] brother Brandon
[1:50:58] says the devil can't receive the holy
[1:51:00] spirit because if he did he'd be your
[1:51:03] brother he would have to be saved
[1:51:05] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[1:51:07] Ghost then he'd be your brother so you
[1:51:10] see he couldn't do
[1:51:14] it he couldn't do it he says Judas
[1:51:16] couldn't go to
[1:51:17] Pentecost cuz he had have been their
[1:51:20] brother he couldn't he couldn't go to
[1:51:23] Pentecost what happened at
[1:51:26] Pentecost the important thing wasn't
[1:51:28] when they came out of the upper room the
[1:51:29] important thing was what happened in the
[1:51:31] upper
[1:51:34] room death to self 120 people got in a
[1:51:38] room and they died to their
[1:51:42] self he says no
[1:51:45] no you just went to the borderline and
[1:51:48] came back lusting for the things of the
[1:51:51] world you never never went all the way
[1:51:53] over into Canaan you see you never went
[1:51:56] across
[1:51:57] Jordan the death to
[1:52:06] self this is why Israel didn't want to
[1:52:09] go across Jordan into Canaan 2 million
[1:52:12] of them
[1:52:13] died they didn't want to go across
[1:52:16] Jordan it wasn't that Canaan wasn't over
[1:52:18] there Canaan was over there it's not
[1:52:21] that the whole Holy Spirit isn't here
[1:52:24] Saints it's here it's just do you want
[1:52:27] to die to
[1:52:30] yourself 2 million people came to a
[1:52:34] mountain and God fulfilled his end of
[1:52:37] the deal and they said not for
[1:52:41] me they had to die off through the
[1:52:44] Wilderness looking across
[1:52:48] Jordan the prophet comes and says Jordan
[1:52:51] represented death to self it's no wonder
[1:52:55] they wouldn't go to
[1:52:56] Canaan they wouldn't die to themselves
[1:52:59] in Egypt they wouldn't die to themselves
[1:53:01] at the mount why in the world would they
[1:53:03] die to themselves to go into
[1:53:10] Canaan we want our atoms changed to
[1:53:14] leave this Dimension and go see him face
[1:53:17] to face but we won't even die to
[1:53:19] ourselves to have his holy spirit
[1:53:22] working in our daily lives
[1:53:25] now we think that we're going to want to
[1:53:28] see him face to face I'm telling you if
[1:53:31] it was possible for a make believer to
[1:53:34] go in a Rapture and see God face to face
[1:53:37] it would terrify
[1:53:39] him and he wouldn't be comfortable there
[1:53:42] he'd say send me
[1:53:50] back but if we will approach God the
[1:53:53] right
[1:53:55] way the great and Dreadful day of the
[1:53:58] Lord will not be a dreadful day to us it
[1:54:01] will just be a great day to us that's
[1:54:04] why the scripture says that this message
[1:54:06] is not given to everybody this message
[1:54:09] is just given to those who look forward
[1:54:12] to his coming that don't fear his
[1:54:16] coming if you're s let's bow our heads
[1:54:18] please if you're sitting here tonight
[1:54:20] and there is still an a a speck of fear
[1:54:24] in your soul
[1:54:26] fearful of Christ
[1:54:33] appearing there's an answer for that
[1:54:36] there's a solution for that you don't
[1:54:39] have to leave this building with that
[1:54:42] fear you can leave this building looking
[1:54:45] forward to his face appearing
[1:54:52] how awful would it be for God to have
[1:54:55] done all that he has done and given us
[1:54:57] everything that he has given us and
[1:54:59] brother R says we now live in a free age
[1:55:03] a free age free from Fear free from
[1:55:07] condemnation free from even our human
[1:55:10] genetics in our DNA how how awful it
[1:55:14] would be for God to have extended all of
[1:55:16] that to us and the least and the the
[1:55:18] best we can do is come and say Lord will
[1:55:21] you fix my
[1:55:23] problems will you help me today things
[1:55:27] are going
[1:55:28] sideways I'm I'm not faulting anybody
[1:55:31] for doing that I'm just saying let's
[1:55:32] come up higher Saints that's not the
[1:55:35] purpose of the message the purpose is
[1:55:38] the message was to prep prepare the way
[1:55:42] for his face to come to us so that we
[1:55:45] can see him as he
[1:55:47] is how awful it would be for him to
[1:55:50] extend that to us this evening and us
[1:55:53] still leave here with fear in our
[1:55:55] heart how awful that would be for him to
[1:55:59] extend that invitation to us this
[1:56:02] evening and we would walk out of here
[1:56:03] with without accepting him as our
[1:56:05] personal savior who died on the cross
[1:56:07] for us and paid the
[1:56:09] penalty how awful for him to extend the
[1:56:13] invitation to us to come and accept his
[1:56:15] name in water baptism and we would
[1:56:18] refuse that and go on about our daily
[1:56:20] life
[1:56:23] how awful for him to extend that
[1:56:26] invitation for his very Spirit the
[1:56:29] spirit of God to come and indwell us and
[1:56:33] change our change our very being in our
[1:56:36] daily
[1:56:38] lives and we say no I know he sent a
[1:56:41] prophet I'm okay I believe what he said
[1:56:44] I'm
[1:56:47] good how awful for him to extend that to
[1:56:50] us and we would not come and die to
[1:56:52] ourselves and say Lord fill me with your
[1:56:55] spirit every ounce of my being change my
[1:56:59] life amen how awful if we have been
[1:57:04] extended the grace to believe this
[1:57:07] message and we've came through that
[1:57:09] process and we find oursel washed up and
[1:57:12] dried up and in a rut and no overcoming
[1:57:15] power in our life to where our children
[1:57:17] can't even look at us and know whether
[1:57:19] we're a Believer or not how awful to
[1:57:21] continue in that situation when it's as
[1:57:23] simple as coming back and saying Lord I
[1:57:26] need your Holy Spirit to make it through
[1:57:28] this life I need your Holy Spirit to be
[1:57:31] the mommy I'm supposed to be and the
[1:57:33] daddy that I'm supposed to be I cannot
[1:57:36] do it in this condition and in this age
[1:57:38] I've got to have your Holy Spirit Saints
[1:57:40] he has given it to us but he is not
[1:57:43] going to fulfill his promise if we will
[1:57:45] not die to ourself and if we will just
[1:57:47] continue day after day to seek his hand
[1:57:49] to fix our problem when he has given us
[1:57:52] invitation to seek his very
[1:57:55] face how awful it would be to turn that
[1:58:01] away since he has loved us so much to
[1:58:04] send us a message and to come and to not
[1:58:07] only do that but to have his face the
[1:58:10] picture taken of his
[1:58:13] face we don't have to wonder about what
[1:58:16] the purpose was we know the
[1:58:19] purpose I say
[1:58:23] let's continue to seek his hand in our
[1:58:25] daily
[1:58:26] life but let us seek his face ever
[1:58:30] more let's pray together precious Lord
[1:58:36] Jesus father we bow with grateful hearts
[1:58:40] with Humble
[1:58:42] Hearts with Thanksgiving of what you've
[1:58:44] done for us
[1:58:48] Lord father and I pray that as we stand
[1:58:52] here this evening as your word has went
[1:58:55] forth that it would not return like
[1:58:58] bread upon the Water but that you would
[1:59:00] go now and that you would manifest and
[1:59:03] that you would vindicate and that you
[1:59:05] would accomplish what the purpose was
[1:59:10] Lord father you know what you laid on my
[1:59:14] heart before I came to this pull
[1:59:16] pit father and I do not ever want to be
[1:59:19] guilty of pulling on the emotions of
[1:59:21] people
[1:59:22] [Music]
[1:59:25] people but Lord you have told me that
[1:59:28] there is young people in this building
[1:59:30] that need a new
[1:59:31] birth and they have got to hear the
[1:59:34] gospel in its Simplicity and they have
[1:59:36] got to know what the next step is and
[1:59:37] that next step is death to
[1:59:40] self father there are marriages in this
[1:59:43] building that need death to self there
[1:59:46] are men making decisions as fathers that
[1:59:48] need death to self
[1:59:53] father your word has went forth your
[1:59:55] word is the answer I pray that you will
[1:59:57] give us the grace to receive it and to
[2:00:00] act upon
[2:00:02] it and to Humble
[2:00:04] ourselves and to do what is needed and
[2:00:07] not to be cold and not to be
[2:00:09] starchy Lord and not to have a dry-eyed
[2:00:12] confession and just say I'm a
[2:00:14] Believer Lord but to know that we know
[2:00:17] that we know that we have met the very
[2:00:20] face of God in our Liv
[2:00:24] Liv Lord may we not leave here the same
[2:00:28] way that we came
[2:00:31] in I pray and ask in the name of Jesus
[2:00:35] Christ amen God bless
[2:00:39] [Music]
[2:00:40] you seek ye
