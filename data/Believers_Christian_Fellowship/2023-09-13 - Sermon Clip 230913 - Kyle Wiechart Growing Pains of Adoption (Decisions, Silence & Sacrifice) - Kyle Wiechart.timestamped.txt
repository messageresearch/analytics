[0:00] if I have to go through suffering so
[0:02] that God could say just one word that
[0:04] helps you then it's okay amen I think
[0:06] brother Branham said I would push a a
[0:08] nickel if I knew it this would help me
[0:10] I'd push a nickel or a penny around the
[0:12] whole city if I knew it would help you
[0:13] you see the attitude of a son of God
[0:16] man he would do anything to help you you
[0:19] didn't care who you were didn't care if
[0:20] you were a bride didn't matter I'd do
[0:23] anything I could to help you make your
[0:25] burden a little lighter upon this Earth
[0:26] because life's hard I get it life's
[0:29] difficult I got a lot of sympathy for
[0:31] people and this day my goodness people
[0:34] are losing their minds and you can see
[0:36] why what hope do they have like do you
[0:38] fault a person for going on drugs and
[0:41] drinking themselves what hope do they
[0:44] have stop condemning people they're just
[0:47] trying to satisfy their nerves so they
[0:48] don't lose their minds in this crazy
[0:50] world
[0:51] you know I don't know why I just have a
[0:54] sympathy because I realized yeah without
[0:56] Christ I mean I get it
[0:59] I get it I totally see why you throw
[1:03] yourself into this thing than this thing
[1:04] and this thing and this thing it's
[1:05] because you don't have Christ but I
[1:07] promise you one thing you get Christ you
[1:08] won't thirst that stuff no more I
[1:11] promise you that I promise you brother
[1:13] Branham said something I was speaking to
[1:15] the youth he said it was your faith that
[1:17] lifted you up out of those things it was
[1:20] your faith so many times well God Lifted
[1:22] Me Up out of it no it was your faith in
[1:23] the word that lifted you up out of that
[1:25] God placed something inside of you that
[1:27] could say Amen to the word and you
[1:28] believed it and God like dropped a
[1:30] ladder down into where you were in the
[1:32] mud and the muck and the filth of life
[1:33] and it's like a ladder and you just take
[1:36] a step of faith on that ladder and just
[1:37] wow where am I going you're just
[1:39] climbing out of it you get into the
[1:40] depths of depression I promise you start
[1:42] believing the word you're going to climb
[1:43] out of it you get sorrowful you get
[1:45] weary you get sick I promise you put
[1:48] your faith back in the promise of God
[1:49] he's going to drop like a ladder down
[1:51] until you start climbing yourself out of
[1:52] it it's not rocket science
[1:55] it's just have faith in God
[1:58] he's provided everything we have needed
[2:00] for this Earthly Journey you just got to
[2:01] believe it
[2:03] Stop Believing the devil's lies it's a
[2:05] lie anything contrary to the word of God
[2:07] I don't care how convincing it is I
[2:08] don't care how much your mind reasons
[2:10] with and says that's the truth it's a
[2:11] lie
[2:12] not made to live this life using this
[2:15] does the Bible say God took a man's mind
[2:17] head God took God's devil took a man's
[2:21] mind God took his heart
[2:23] seed of faith is right down inside of
[2:26] there say that's the truth I believe it
[2:28] amen and just climb right on out of it
[2:30] don't let nothing get in your way I
[2:32] think brother bam said just cut your way
[2:33] through every bit of it
[2:35] that's what we do with the word but it's
[2:37] faith in the word why did the word not
[2:39] profit them it was never mixed with
[2:40] faith why is the word not profiting you
[2:43] you're not believing it
[2:45] right you don't want to blame so many
[2:46] people about so many problems maybe you
[2:48] don't believe the word
[2:50] maybe you have more confidence in the
[2:52] Natural Things of life and politics or
[2:54] things of that nature then you have no
[2:56] confidence in the word my goodness man
[2:58] stop consuming the nonsense and start
[2:59] getting back into the word faith comes
[3:01] by hearing the words to start reading
[3:02] the word feeding on the word and see
[3:04] what happens
[3:05] has a way of stirring you back up
