[0:00] everybody is important
[0:03] you might be just sitting there
[0:06] and you might be just uh you know
[0:10] praying secretly
[0:13] but don't you know brothers and sisters
[0:16] that there is no preacher that can
[0:19] preach A good sermon here
[0:21] Allelujah
[0:24] except there is someone praying for him
[0:29] you maybe say that this church is doing
[0:35] uh some missionary missionary Works in
[0:38] different places of the world
[0:41] but
[0:43] without somebody who is
[0:46] secretly giving doing their parts
[0:49] contributing their parts Hallelujah
[0:59] there would be no missionary work will
[1:02] be done for this church
[1:04] every part of the body is very important
[1:09] Hallelujah
[1:11] tell me
[1:13] any part of the body that
[1:16] got no purpose
[1:20] I am making this an example just like
[1:23] your eyebrow
[1:28] you may say what is he he doing there
[1:34] I tell you shave it and you will know
[1:41] Hallelujah
[1:45] what is the purpose of that eyebrow but
[1:47] it has a you know a more important role
[1:52] in our body the eyebrow
[1:55] because uh when you work
[1:59] and then you will sweat and win your
[2:01] sweat come into your eyes it will damage
[2:04] your eyes
[2:06] so God put an eyebrow
[2:09] and it did not just grow this way
[2:12] it grow this way
[2:15] Hallelujah so that when
[2:18] the sweat start dropping
[2:21] it will go this way and
[2:23] will not come to your to your eyes
[2:27] Hallelujah
[2:29] every part of the body is very important
[2:34] and we should do and babraham said as
[2:38] long as you serve your purpose you will
[2:40] come up in the resurrection
[2:43] as long as you serve your purpose
[2:44] remember Hallelujah God did not put you
[2:47] there without a purpose
