[0:00] so many times in our thinking when we
[0:02] see that that that dream showed brother
[0:05] branham on the white horse going as far
[0:07] to the west as he could go and then
[0:09] turning amen and he says we've gone far
[0:12] west if we go any farther we'll we'll be
[0:14] back east that's that is going through
[0:17] the pacific ocean back east but that's
[0:19] not how we go back east brother branham
[0:21] said you turn at the west coast and go
[0:23] right back to jerusalem again so there's
[0:26] not going back east it's not going
[0:28] across the pacific ocean going back east
[0:30] is turning at the west at the opening of
[0:33] the seals
[0:34] turning at the west and riding back and
[0:37] that's why brother bram said she'll ride
[0:39] back one of these things she'll ride
[0:41] right back she sure will why she's
[0:44] turning at the west
[0:47] and going back going back where back to
[0:49] where it all started in jerusalem and
[0:52] this spirit of elijah which is the
[0:53] spirit of christ will be upon this
[0:55] church until that elijah rises with
[0:58] moses and elijah
[1:00] and if you think about the man the
[1:02] message the way the message is traveled
[1:04] and spread the message at the opening of
[1:06] the word when brother branham was out
[1:08] west and received the commission amen to
[1:11] go back and open the seals it went from
[1:13] west he said we went as far west brother
[1:15] branham preached in los angeles i mean
[1:17] he got all the way out there and he
[1:19] preached birth pains all the way out in
[1:21] los angeles
[1:23] and it turned at the west and that
[1:26] message has been traveling in all
[1:28] nations and covering the globe where did
[1:31] it turn where did it turn from church
[1:33] ages to bride where did it turn from
[1:35] denominations to the word where did it
[1:37] come back to christ in his church again
[1:40] it turned at the west amen it traveled
[1:42] as far as it could west it turned at the
[1:44] west and now it for for almost 60 years
[1:47] it's been going back and it'll keep
[1:49] going back until it gets back to
[1:51] jerusalem but how has it been traveling
[1:54] amen and what vessels has the message
[1:56] been traveling it's not in the vessel
[1:59] amen of malachi 4 brother branham it's
[2:02] in the vessel of the bride the bride's
[2:04] been carrying the message the bride's
[2:06] been spreading the gospel the bride has
[2:08] evangelized south america europe amen
[2:12] amen all through russia into asia amen
[2:15] and it's coming back friends it's coming
[2:17] right back to jerusalem
[2:20] somebody asked me before what will that
[2:22] look like how will the bride brother bam
[2:24] said the gentiles will take the gospel
[2:25] right back to the jews i don't know what
[2:28] the handoff will look like i don't know
[2:30] if it's physical i don't know if we just
[2:32] carry it until he takes us and they pick
[2:33] it up i have no idea all i know is that
[2:36] spirit is riding in this bride it's been
[2:39] riding it turned at the west and it's
[2:41] riding back to the east it's going back
[2:43] to where it started to pick up the 144
[2:46] 000 to bring in the millennium amen and
[2:48] when in that that spirit has not stopped
[2:52] writing when the prophet left it's been
[2:54] riding in and through his bride
[2:57] that's why he says he'll ride his church
[3:00] right to glory in the resurrection
[3:01] because this is the resurrection
