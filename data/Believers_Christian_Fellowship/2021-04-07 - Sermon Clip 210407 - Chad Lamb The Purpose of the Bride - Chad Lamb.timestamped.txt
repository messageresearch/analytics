[0:00] the children of god are born amen when
[0:02] the light of the age strikes that seed
[0:05] it comes to life when the pure
[0:06] unadulterated raw amen pure virgin word
[0:10] strikes a virgin seed it brings forth a
[0:12] virgin daughter
[0:15] but we don't manipulate it amen we don't
[0:17] change it we don't
[0:19] uh we don't make it uh more palatable or
[0:22] we don't add
[0:22] sugar to it to get the kids to take it
[0:27] those things are all dangerous that's
[0:29] reasoning and ideas of
[0:30] man trying to bring forth children
[0:34] amen we don't want to bring forth
[0:36] children we want to bring forth his seed
[0:39] amen
[0:39] and i only want to bring forth his seed
[0:41] if that's one more for the duration of
[0:43] our existence on this earth that's the
[0:45] only one we want
[0:49] that sounds horrible but that's the
[0:51] truth
[0:52] jesus came to seek and to save what was
[0:55] lost he came to save his own
[0:57] he said i didn't come i don't pray for
[0:59] the whole world amen i didn't come for
[1:00] the whole world but i come to say mine
[1:02] that we're in the world
[1:04] the ministry of jesus christ was the
[1:06] second to save that which was lost his
[1:08] own sheep
[1:08] that were lost and the ministry of
[1:10] christ is now in the bride
[1:14] paul and barnabas amen they're going in
[1:16] their journey and they're preaching amen
[1:18] and as they're preaching the jews begin
[1:20] to resist them and he said it was
[1:21] needful that the gospel be first
[1:23] preached to you but by seeing that you
[1:25] count yourself unworthy of eternal life
[1:27] lo we turn to the gentiles
[1:30] then the gentiles began to rejoice and
[1:32] be glad
[1:33] and as many as were ordained unto life
[1:37] believed they didn't all believe
[1:40] but those that were ordained to life
[1:42] believe amen and paul
[1:43] didn't have to change his gospel to get
[1:45] the jews to keep him in the synagogue a
[1:47] little bit longer so that he could win
[1:49] the gentiles
[1:51] [Music]
[1:52] what did he do he preached the gospel
[1:54] that got him rejected
[1:56] he preached the gospel that got him
[1:57] kicked out he preached the gospel that
[1:59] got him stoned
[2:00] he preached the gospel that had him
[2:01] hated but he preached the gospel that
[2:03] those who were ordained to life would
[2:06] believe
[2:08] because we're not bringing forth our own
[2:10] children amen
[2:11] the bride doesn't have her own seed
[2:13] she's not out there trying to find a
[2:15] seed so she can replicate replicate
[2:16] replicate
[2:17] he said many more are the children of
[2:19] the desert the
[2:21] the desolate than of the righteous
[2:25] it's not about winning numbers it's not
[2:27] a soul-winning program that's
[2:29] denominationalism
[2:30] amen it's about finding the lost seed
[2:32] and you can only find it with the true
[2:34] word for your day
