[8:19] science voice today that i'm pretty
[8:20] happy about
[8:22] got a
[8:22] few degrees lower
[8:24] had a little head cold this week so uh
[8:27] you'd be praying for me i uh i kind of
[8:30] like it i gotta admit it sounds kind of
[8:32] nice
[8:33] but i just don't have a lot of volume
[8:35] behind it so i definitely won't be able
[8:36] to do what brother nathaniel can do
[8:38] so um but i'm happy to be here
[8:41] and uh i sure appreciate the opportunity
[8:44] by god's grace if you don't know brother
[8:46] chad's on vacation but i'm sure you most
[8:48] of you do
[8:49] and wow
[8:51] that's even better
[8:53] and um
[8:55] does that bother you
[8:57] sorry
[8:59] so but he's doing fine i do believe in
[9:01] how many are praying for him
[9:04] i'm praying for him praying that the
[9:05] lord just restore the strength of our
[9:07] brother his family of his children and
[9:10] and you know uses them as a light in the
[9:12] dark world wherever they find themselves
[9:14] to be and
[9:15] i'm sure he'd also be praying that the
[9:17] fish will be biting so you'd be praying
[9:19] for that as well but just continue to
[9:22] lift him up and just want to let
[9:24] everybody know brother ron will be here
[9:25] on
[9:26] wednesday preaching for us and then
[9:28] brother kadima after that so we'll be
[9:30] lifting them brothers up in prayer
[9:33] so um
[9:34] makes me nervous you know i'm like oh
[9:36] boy what announcements am i going to
[9:38] forget i don't think there is anything
[9:39] else but
[9:40] i uh
[9:41] yeah okay now you can stand
[9:44] let's just go to the word
[9:51] if you will you turn in your bibles to
[9:52] first peter
[9:54] chapters 2 verse 9.
[10:04] first peter chapter 2 verse 9.
[10:12] amen but you're a chosen generation a
[10:16] royal priesthood and holy nation a
[10:19] peculiar people that you should show
[10:21] forth the praises of him who have called
[10:23] you out of darkness into his marvelous
[10:26] light
[10:27] which in times past were not a people
[10:29] but are now the people of god which had
[10:32] not obtained mercy but now have obtained
[10:35] mercy
[10:36] dearly beloved i beseech you as
[10:39] strangers and pilgrims abstain from
[10:42] fleshly lust which war against the soul
[10:45] having your conversation this means a
[10:47] manner of life
[10:48] honest among the gentiles that whereas
[10:51] they speak against you as evil doers
[10:54] they may by your good works which they
[10:57] shall behold glorify god in the day of
[11:00] visitation
[11:02] and also john 17 17.
[11:23] john 17 17
[11:26] sanctify them through thy truth thy word
[11:29] is truth
[11:30] as thou has sent me into the world even
[11:33] so have i sent them into the world
[11:37] and for their sakes i sanctify myself
[11:41] that they also may be sanctified through
[11:43] the truth
[11:44] we just bow your heads
[11:47] gracious heavenly father we come before
[11:49] you once more today
[11:51] and lord we do deem it a great honor and
[11:53] a privilege that lord you've called us
[11:54] and chose us and elected us
[11:56] and lord have assembled us together but
[11:59] now lord we're asking that your great
[12:01] holy spirit would now brood over your
[12:03] people lord lord that you would soften
[12:05] our hearts father lord that you would
[12:08] remove anything in our lives and in our
[12:10] hearts and our minds that's hindering
[12:12] the expression of your life in us
[12:14] father that you could come down now and
[12:16] lord sanctify me as a speaker
[12:19] lord i know i'm in able and i'm weak but
[12:22] lord it's in weakness that your
[12:23] strengths are made strong and lord i
[12:25] pray that you would sanctify the ears of
[12:27] the hears
[12:28] lord that they could hear and receive
[12:30] those things from you
[12:32] that will bring them to that further
[12:33] expression of your heart's desire
[12:36] father we love you with all of our
[12:38] hearts and we appreciate all that you've
[12:40] done for us and continue to do
[12:42] now lord do the supernatural part
[12:45] lord make your lit word live in our
[12:47] lives
[12:48] may it be the word becoming flesh and
[12:51] now the flesh becoming the word
[12:54] we love you we thank you we commit
[12:55] ourselves to you in jesus name amen
[12:59] amen you may be seated so
[13:02] i wanted to if you've noticed there's
[13:04] some similarities in some of these
[13:05] scriptures in accordance to where the
[13:07] our pastor's been going from sunday and
[13:09] on wednesday service and if something
[13:11] happens where i think god is
[13:12] significantly doing something or he
[13:14] guides me in such a way that i think
[13:16] it's of significance i think we're
[13:18] mature enough people to realize i'm not
[13:19] trying to exalt myself but we believe
[13:21] that god works in the presence of his
[13:22] people and the supernatural elements and
[13:24] little things that he does
[13:26] and i
[13:27] i wanted to
[13:29] share with you this
[13:31] i feel like i'm going to go in the exact
[13:33] same direction as brother chad i don't
[13:35] feel like it i know i am
[13:36] and i can't do anything about that
[13:38] because i had come here last
[13:40] saturday and was praying for brother
[13:43] daniel
[13:44] and as i was praying and interceding for
[13:46] him i i started praying for the youth
[13:49] and as their faces come before me i pray
[13:51] for him and i started praying for all of
[13:53] you as your faces come before me i
[13:54] started praying for you interceding for
[13:56] you asking god to bless you and as i was
[13:58] praying i said you know lord i got a
[14:00] youth meeting tomorrow and i've i've got
[14:02] this sunday service before me here in a
[14:04] week from now
[14:05] i really don't know what the next step
[14:07] is i know what you you told me the last
[14:09] time that there's a choice that must be
[14:11] made
[14:12] and it's an expression of divine love
[14:14] when you know the until the chosen make
[14:16] him their choice it's a harder choice to
[14:18] make it's very hard um and and i saw
[14:21] that lord but lord what's the next step
[14:23] and i just began to pray and you know
[14:25] and i'm real simple and i guess i'm just
[14:28] i just don't know anything more than if
[14:30] i ask god he'll answer i don't maybe i'm
[14:33] but so i just was asking him and i says
[14:35] lord what what do i do now what's my
[14:37] next step
[14:38] and i was praying for a little bit and i
[14:40] had this little piece of paper because i
[14:41] always i'm kind of funny if i get a
[14:43] little inspiration i'll write something
[14:45] down on a piece of paper and you know
[14:46] maybe god will do something with it so
[14:48] this is the paper and i walked in the
[14:49] doors there to come pray
[14:51] had a little pen with me and
[14:53] i was praying and just real subtle real
[14:55] just a little
[14:57] you know little words come to my mind
[14:58] and i just wrote it down and on the top
[15:00] of it i wrote down remember thy divine
[15:02] purpose
[15:04] and i thought well that's interesting
[15:05] you know
[15:07] and then a little bit time goes on and i
[15:09] and i
[15:10] i flip the page over in another one he
[15:12] sanctified himself for others
[15:15] and so i
[15:16] i sat there and i looked at that for a
[15:18] little bit i went home and kept praying
[15:20] and going a different direction but i
[15:21] just seemingly couldn't go another
[15:23] direction it's like i needed to look at
[15:25] this
[15:26] don't forget remember you have a divine
[15:28] purpose
[15:29] and also paralleling it here with jesus
[15:31] setting himself apart for somebody
[15:32] else's sake
[15:34] and as i began i that morning i got up
[15:36] early and started praying again you know
[15:38] just
[15:39] what do i do and and it just
[15:41] like a just a firecracker it just went
[15:44] off real quick
[15:45] and i was like okay now esther because
[15:47] i've been in esther here for quite some
[15:48] a while if you all know i've been
[15:50] drawing lots of inspiration from there
[15:52] the bride of his choosing
[15:54] vashti who rejected his calling
[15:56] and then the chosen making him their
[15:58] choice him or his choice
[16:00] and so in all of that then i began to
[16:02] realize you know esther was chosen to
[16:05] choose
[16:06] after she made her choice she was
[16:07] accepted
[16:08] after she was accepted she was in the
[16:10] position of intercession
[16:12] and i took that and i realized that was
[16:15] in joseph that was in moses that was in
[16:18] enoch that was all throughout the bible
[16:21] all these bible characters are put in
[16:23] the same position and they have to
[16:25] express christ in the same way at the
[16:27] same time that was in brother branham
[16:29] that was expressed in sister hattie
[16:31] wright it just it kept going like that i
[16:34] says now here's moses he was called he
[16:35] was chosen of god but then after he was
[16:37] called and chosen he had to make his
[16:38] choice brother branham said he had to
[16:40] walk in his own choosing and as he
[16:42] walked in his own choosing he was loved
[16:44] of god he was brought into the presence
[16:45] of god and the pillar of fire then he
[16:47] finds himself throwing himself in the
[16:48] breach in exodus 32 32 saying lord blot
[16:51] my name out but don't forsake thy
[16:53] people. and that stumbled the prophet of
[16:55] god he said how could a man do this he
[16:57] says it was christ in that man
[16:59] expressing it was christ in moses saying
[17:01] blot my name out but do not forsake
[17:04] these people there was something
[17:05] throwing him in the breach
[17:08] and it was so interesting so i started
[17:10] just
[17:10] writing down all of these these notes
[17:13] about this and here's all my notes from
[17:15] early sunday morning
[17:16] and then brother chad gets up and
[17:18] preaches everything
[17:24] and so
[17:25] i've been in turmoil
[17:27] that's how
[17:28] i tell the kids i was like honestly i'm
[17:31] not going to add one thing to my notes
[17:33] i'm just going to repeat everything
[17:34] brother chad said but i promise you i
[17:36] promise you
[17:38] i didn't i didn't
[17:40] you know
[17:42] but when that happens i mean who who are
[17:45] we as a people to say i gotta go preach
[17:47] something different i can't
[17:49] if god is putting an inspiration he's
[17:51] saying this is the next step you tell my
[17:53] people this
[17:55] and i have a hard time even saying that
[17:57] but yet i believe that i believe that he
[17:58] wants you to know this right now it's of
[18:01] vital importance
[18:03] and so if he gets up through the
[18:05] ministry and says the exact same thing
[18:07] that i'm at home and i want to preach
[18:08] the exact same thing what more can i do
[18:10] but preach just the exact same thing so
[18:14] i've titled this today verily verily
[18:17] remember thy divine purpose
[18:22] and the reason i say verily verily
[18:25] as you probably all know i was praying
[18:27] and honestly i was saying lord i got you
[18:29] got to give me something else i got to
[18:31] go different direction
[18:32] and i stumbled across that one of these
[18:34] quotes that brother branham was
[18:36] explaining verily verily
[18:38] and he says and verily verily he was
[18:39] bringing special emphasis brother ma'am
[18:41] says in quotations listen close
[18:44] absolutely absolutely the son can do
[18:47] nothing in himself but what he seeth the
[18:49] father doing he the son doeth likewise
[18:52] and i says i know that god called me i
[18:54] know i'm a son so i better just do what
[18:56] he's called me to do i'd rather be found
[18:59] stumbling through putting a few words
[19:01] that he told me to say than putting
[19:02] together a masterpiece of a thousand
[19:04] words of something he didn't want me to
[19:05] say
[19:06] and i think that's the expression of
[19:08] every heart of the believer right and
[19:10] his he just wants to be what god made
[19:12] him he just wants to do what god called
[19:14] him to do he doesn't want to add to it
[19:15] he doesn't want to take away from it he
[19:17] just wants to express god and the
[19:20] purpose that he made him
[19:22] and so when i was talking to the kids i
[19:24] you know i was explaining to them you
[19:25] know the bible says we are fearfully and
[19:27] wonderfully made god made me with a
[19:29] purpose
[19:30] and he made you with a purpose you may
[19:32] not like the way he made you but he made
[19:35] you with a purpose so if you have
[19:37] confidence that god puts you in the
[19:38] position you're in you have the makeup
[19:40] that you have you had the parents that
[19:42] you had you had the upbringing that you
[19:43] had it must have been for a divine
[19:45] purpose for god to express something in
[19:48] his great nature through you that only
[19:50] you can do
[19:51] and that's just the reality of it you
[19:54] have some portion of the expression of
[19:56] god that has to be distinctly you
[19:58] because it's distinctly god
[20:00] and you cannot change from that
[20:02] expression
[20:03] and so when i began to just think about
[20:06] this more and more i said so well this
[20:07] verily verily okay
[20:09] lord i'll just go say it again
[20:12] and i hope that's okay
[20:13] i'm certainly i'll say some things a
[20:15] little bit different because i i'm just
[20:17] different you know
[20:18] but
[20:19] maybe god wants us to pay close
[20:21] attention to this
[20:23] because i find in esther you know esther
[20:25] at 4 it says
[20:26] 14
[20:27] it says if thou altogether holdest thy
[20:30] peace at this time then shall their
[20:32] enlargement and deliverance arise to the
[20:34] jews from another place god will
[20:36] preserve his elect
[20:37] but thou and thy father's house shall be
[20:40] destroyed and you knoweth whether and
[20:43] and who knoweth whether or not
[20:46] thou art come to the kingdom for such a
[20:49] time as this
[20:51] so mordecai isaac admonishing her and
[20:53] says you know what god will preserve his
[20:55] people some way the promises will never
[20:57] fail god will preserve his people but
[20:58] one thing you will know you and your
[21:00] father's house shall surely perish if
[21:02] you don't do something to intercede
[21:05] he was reminding her you know and
[21:07] we know if we follow the types there
[21:09] obviously mordecai was a type of the
[21:10] holy spirit clearly he had to be here is
[21:13] esther she loses mother and her father
[21:15] she comes and she's now under the
[21:17] tutorship of mordecai and mordecai
[21:18] trains her
[21:20] in a certain way with a certain
[21:21] character and a certain understanding of
[21:23] things and here she comes into a great
[21:25] position she's been chosen you know i'm
[21:27] sorry i'll back up here for a little bit
[21:28] but she was chosen along with a leather
[21:30] a lot of other women that were chosen
[21:32] she couldn't glory in the fact that she
[21:33] was chosen though she was chosen she was
[21:35] happy about that but now she was put in
[21:37] a certain position to make a certain
[21:38] choice and that certain choice was going
[21:41] to express the hidden secret part
[21:42] something that was in the back part of
[21:44] the king that he couldn't come right out
[21:45] and tell all the virgins do exactly this
[21:47] this this and this because if he was
[21:49] just evaluating and choosing based upon
[21:51] human beauty vashti had them all beat
[21:55] she was unbelievably attractive no doubt
[21:58] because the king wanted to bring her
[21:59] before all the people and show her off
[22:01] but the problem of it was she was
[22:02] disobedient
[22:04] she couldn't stay in some hit simple
[22:06] humble subjection to the king's command
[22:08] she wanted to do her own thing
[22:11] and we know this to be following up and
[22:12] i'm sorry i'm just reviewing here but
[22:14] when when esther came before the king
[22:16] here she is now she's listening to
[22:19] haggai now haggai the prophet of god to
[22:21] the age is instructing this woman
[22:23] and no doubt he was giving instruction
[22:25] to other women that were there
[22:27] but this one particular woman was
[22:29] listening very intently to every word
[22:32] how it was said and what was said and
[22:34] she wasn't going to add anything to it
[22:36] and she certainly wasn't going to take
[22:37] anything from it
[22:38] and she presented herself one day before
[22:40] the king after she also had the help of
[22:42] seven fair uh
[22:44] made chamberlain's from the king's
[22:46] palace you know seven church ages and
[22:48] seven seals
[22:49] and here she is now she has her
[22:50] opportunity to present herself to the
[22:52] king but she only brings the king just
[22:54] what the king required that little
[22:55] portion that wasn't spoken of
[22:58] because all the other fair young virgins
[23:00] certainly added to the presentation
[23:02] or they took away
[23:04] but one thing esther did not do she just
[23:07] took and she just came as haggy i
[23:09] instructed not adding one word not
[23:11] taking one word away from it just
[23:13] staying with that
[23:15] and she was accepted because of this
[23:17] and because she was loved she was
[23:19] accepted she then came to a point in
[23:21] time that she could intercede
[23:23] and mordecai then reminds her it's like
[23:26] hello
[23:27] um you know you're in the palace
[23:29] you're chosen god chose you
[23:32] you can glory in that you can bask in
[23:35] that or you can realize perhaps
[23:38] god brought you there for a reason
[23:42] and so many times
[23:44] that's why i said
[23:45] that's why i think i wrote down remember
[23:48] your divine purpose
[23:49] because we can forget
[23:51] we certainly forget
[23:53] we certainly can get the attributes of
[23:55] spiritual amnesia in this hour and
[23:57] forget why we're here upon this earth
[23:59] we're not here to just have a good time
[24:01] to make a bunch of money to enjoy
[24:02] ourselves to go on vacations no
[24:05] i have a divine purpose that's way
[24:07] bigger than that
[24:09] and so i want to spend some time with
[24:10] them
[24:11] and i'm just going to refresh here for a
[24:13] little bit
[24:15] until
[24:16] because thou has chosen the narrow way
[24:18] the harder way thou hast walked in thine
[24:20] own choosing thou has picked the correct
[24:22] and precise way and it is my way because
[24:25] of this momentous decision a huge
[24:27] portion of heaven awaits thee what a
[24:29] glorious decision that was made this in
[24:31] and of itself shall make or shall give
[24:33] and make to come to bring to pass a
[24:34] tremendous victory in love divine divine
[24:37] love had to be projected because the
[24:39] right people have to make the right
[24:40] choice at the right time
[24:44] in spiritual amnesia brother bam says
[24:46] this and why i want to emphasis in the
[24:48] sense that i do believe you can forget
[24:49] and you might have
[24:51] brother brahm says now this amnesia we
[24:53] are told that it can it can come upon
[24:55] you and you cannot identify yourself
[24:58] now it's an unusual thing you don't all
[25:00] it don't it doesn't happen too often but
[25:03] the cause of it is shock
[25:05] it's somebody that doesn't know who they
[25:06] are
[25:07] you find it in wars sometimes soldiers
[25:10] get it sometimes people get it
[25:12] another thing that causes it is worry
[25:14] worry will cause it the spiritual
[25:16] amnesia forgetting who you are
[25:19] worry has no virtue in it all
[25:21] worry forget worry accept faith someone
[25:24] said well now what if you're going to be
[25:25] shot in the morning wouldn't you worry
[25:27] he said no i don't think so why i said
[25:30] worry won't couldn't do nothing but make
[25:32] it make me worse
[25:33] well what good what will it do to have
[25:35] faith he said it may deliver me and
[25:37] that's right so worry has no virtue in
[25:39] it all but faith has all virtue belief
[25:42] now worry sometimes causes it another
[25:44] thing that can cause it
[25:46] is when among people is getting halt
[25:49] between two opinions this causes this
[25:52] amnesia
[25:53] and you get it you get to a place where
[25:55] you you actually what you've done is you
[25:58] have lost your reasons you've lost your
[26:00] mind you can't you don't know who you
[26:02] are you can't identify yourself you can
[26:05] walk eat talk everything
[26:07] and you can't identify yourself you have
[26:10] got your scholarly educations
[26:13] but you don't know where you came from
[26:15] and you don't know who you are
[26:17] where you belong you see this is an
[26:19] amnesia that we are told and that's why
[26:22] i want to speak about i think it's
[26:23] something we can forget too easily
[26:25] because we're in a great battle and we
[26:26] all know it 200 million million demons
[26:28] are every day waking up with you on
[26:30] their mind how can i get them off of
[26:32] their divine purpose how can i get them
[26:34] convinced that there is something else
[26:36] more important than just expressing the
[26:37] purpose that god has called them to this
[26:39] earth for
[26:40] so what do i do
[26:42] so brother branham then goes on to say
[26:44] they had a real bad case of it after god
[26:46] had been so good to them and brought
[26:47] them up out of the heathen lands and
[26:49] made them a separated people he
[26:51] separated them unto himself he said he
[26:53] took of the vine out of another country
[26:55] and he planted it into another country
[26:57] and how he fixed it and made it to grow
[26:59] in fruit and be fruitful but the vine
[27:01] forgot where all those blessings had
[27:03] come from
[27:04] so has god's people in this last day has
[27:06] forgotten the testimony of what it means
[27:08] to be a christian it's again that
[27:10] amnesia has become has come upon the
[27:12] people and they cannot identify
[27:14] themselves they had forgotten all about
[27:17] it they had forgotten his holiness they
[27:18] had forgotten his laws the woman started
[27:21] to act like all the other rest of the
[27:23] women god's church and his people has
[27:25] always been a separated people a called
[27:28] out people a peculiar people a holy
[27:31] nation a royal priesthood offering
[27:34] spiritual sacrifices to god giving the
[27:36] fruits of their lips giving praise to
[27:38] his name god called this church and
[27:40] separated it from the world for that
[27:43] purpose
[27:44] and he gave them a law that they may be
[27:47] holy as i am old holy they are holy and
[27:50] without holiness no man shall see the
[27:52] lord
[27:53] god said unto him himself
[27:56] so we can see here very clearly that god
[27:58] has chosen you as a royal priesthood and
[28:01] what does a priesthood do
[28:03] he intercedes
[28:04] that is the essence of a priesthood a
[28:06] priesthood intercedes that's what you
[28:07] were called to be you were called to
[28:09] maintain a peculiar life you were called
[28:11] to be distinctly different from the rest
[28:13] of the world you're aiming to look like
[28:14] the world act like the world talk like
[28:15] the world because you have a divine
[28:17] purpose you have to sanctify yourself
[28:18] keep yourself in a sanctified state so
[28:21] that you can constantly be in a position
[28:22] that you can intercede
[28:25] and i hope it's okay we're just going to
[28:26] fly through all this
[28:28] and i want to bring it out from enoch
[28:31] brother branham said enoch was a perfect
[28:33] reflection of the word that he was
[28:35] pointed to enoch was the living
[28:37] expression of the word of god in a human
[28:39] flesh
[28:40] and if you remember about enoch brother
[28:42] branham says noah kept his eyes on enoch
[28:45] i wonder why
[28:47] just because he's family in relation
[28:50] no because he was the living expression
[28:52] of the living god in a tabernacle in a
[28:54] human flesh
[28:55] so much so that enoch kept his eyes or
[28:58] noah kept his eyes on enoch and he knew
[29:01] that if enoch went missing judgment was
[29:03] sure to come
[29:05] you know what brother bam said
[29:06] so enoch while he was here the life that
[29:09] he was living was holding back the
[29:11] judgments of god to strike upon this
[29:13] earth
[29:14] and so much so this life that was being
[29:16] lived and projected before the people so
[29:18] much so that noah a type of the foolish
[29:21] virgin kept his eyes on enoch and
[29:23] brother banham said when enoch went away
[29:26] noah started hanging around the ark
[29:28] because he knew tribulation judgment is
[29:30] coming
[29:31] isn't it an interesting thing you know
[29:33] maybe you're living a sanctified life
[29:34] for the foolish virgin
[29:37] maybe you're living the kind of life so
[29:38] that other people see not that they're
[29:39] going to be converted and become a the
[29:41] bride but they could be saved through
[29:43] great tribulation because you held
[29:44] yourself in a sanctified state you threw
[29:47] yourself in the breach constantly
[29:50] now let's just keep going job
[29:53] job did the same thing
[29:55] job wanted to know god god chose job
[29:57] didn't he he clearly chose job
[29:59] so much so that he even reminded the
[30:00] devil you know job hey he's mine you
[30:03] want to go pick on him for a little bit
[30:04] sure go down but he was testing job and
[30:07] job had this great time of testing but
[30:09] job made his choice in the time of
[30:10] testing where he said god giveth and the
[30:12] lord taketh away blessed be the name of
[30:14] god he wasn't going to
[30:16] bring a reproach or speak evil against
[30:18] the lord he was going to commit himself
[30:19] to the lord and find say hey whatever
[30:21] state i find my end there i am content
[30:24] because god knows what he's doing and
[30:25] that he had passed the test and he come
[30:27] to the point where his good old friends
[30:29] those wretched friends that he had had
[30:31] come to the point where now what happens
[30:33] to them because they spoke evil of him
[30:36] now if he doesn't do something for them
[30:37] surely they're destroyed but what did
[30:39] job do he interceded on their behalf and
[30:42] they were spared
[30:44] and this pattern continues on we can go
[30:46] through abraham but i don't need to
[30:47] brother branham or brother chad went
[30:49] through abraham so i don't need to do
[30:51] that but just to you know he was chosen
[30:53] and then he made his choice brother
[30:54] bannon even said that about abraham he
[30:56] made his choice but he was after he made
[30:58] his choice he was accepted by god then
[31:00] he could stand in the gap to actually
[31:02] intercede joseph
[31:05] this is a strange one
[31:07] joseph takes a unlikely pathway of
[31:09] intercession now this is what i want you
[31:11] to kind of key in on because this is
[31:12] where i think it's a little different
[31:15] in order to actually intercede you have
[31:17] to feel for the people
[31:19] you cannot intercede unless you can feel
[31:21] the pain that they're feeling you
[31:23] understand that
[31:25] there is conditions for intercession
[31:28] just because you know you're in the
[31:30] position do you realize you can't
[31:32] actually help them unless you can feel
[31:33] their pain
[31:35] brother branham talks about this you
[31:37] can't do a thing to help them if you
[31:39] can't feel the pain they're in and
[31:41] sympathize with the situation they find
[31:43] themselves in i have found myself in
[31:45] that position many times out at
[31:47] restaurants and you know my i have a
[31:49] tendency to talk to people but i have a
[31:51] tendency to talk to them because i think
[31:53] as long as they got breath in their body
[31:55] there could be a chance there's
[31:56] something i can say there's something i
[31:58] can do there's some expression that they
[32:00] can see in my life that could be mercy
[32:02] to them
[32:03] but you just cannot help anybody if you
[32:05] don't feel for them you just cannot do
[32:08] it guys
[32:09] no one can
[32:10] so joseph it's fine it's an interesting
[32:13] pathway he takes to get to the throne in
[32:14] order to actually intercede on his
[32:16] brethren on behalf of his brother he's
[32:18] loved over the father we know that so
[32:20] he's clearly chosen the father chose to
[32:22] love him
[32:23] he's hated of his brethren he's totally
[32:25] rejected because he's spiritual he
[32:27] dreams dreams and he has revelations of
[32:29] things that his brothers have no clue
[32:30] what they're talking about and for some
[32:32] reason seemingly those revelations and
[32:34] dreams seem to put him in a position
[32:35] they don't exactly like
[32:37] and so he's having these dreams he's
[32:39] chosen so then he is now rejected of his
[32:42] brethren because he's spiritual and he's
[32:44] been called of god to fulfill a certain
[32:45] purpose and plan
[32:47] and then he's cast into the pit then
[32:49] he's thrown into slavery he finds
[32:52] himself in the middle of a prison so
[32:54] he's finding himself in an unlikely
[32:56] not so fun place of suffering
[32:59] and none of this ever does anything
[33:01] other than soften his heart for his
[33:02] brethren because when his brethren
[33:04] finally come in his presence he can
[33:05] barely hold back the tears
[33:07] in order to be able to show and express
[33:09] his great love to him he just hardly
[33:11] can't contain it he wasn't angry he
[33:14] wasn't
[33:15] upset he wasn't saying i got you now
[33:18] he wasn't had that attitude ever in him
[33:20] he had an attitude of wanting to restore
[33:22] fellowship with his brethren all the way
[33:24] through
[33:25] and it's interesting because that's the
[33:27] nature of christ in every situation we
[33:29] find ourselves in what would have
[33:30] happened if stephen would not have said
[33:32] father forgive them they know not what
[33:33] they do because there was a
[33:34] predestinated elect first church age
[33:36] messenger standing there at the feet
[33:38] with their stephen's coat being thrown
[33:40] and he didn't know what he was doing
[33:42] here was the elect of god persecuting
[33:44] the elect
[33:47] and here's stephen not getting a bad
[33:48] attitude about it but he's saying father
[33:50] forgive them they know not what they do
[33:52] because this elect can't persecute this
[33:54] elect can't blaspheme because he's the
[33:56] elect but he did not know what he was
[33:58] doing he could not recognize the
[34:01] manifestation of christ in stephen at
[34:03] that moment but he would at a later date
[34:06] and time if that ever isn't a rebuke and
[34:08] a warning to each and every one of us
[34:10] just because someone doesn't see things
[34:12] the way we see it in the hour in which
[34:13] we see it hold your peace pray for him
[34:17] don't say anything against him ask for
[34:19] mercy ask for forgiveness
[34:22] keep an arm open out there stretched out
[34:25] constantly doing something that you can
[34:27] maybe bring them back into fellowship at
[34:28] a later date and time you pray for them
[34:31] don't condemn them
[34:33] because even paul couldn't recognize
[34:35] this great unfailing
[34:37] and so it just keeps on going up through
[34:38] then in brother branham's life he does
[34:40] the same thing obviously clearly chosen
[34:43] obviously clearly makes his choice then
[34:45] obviously
[34:46] once wants to leave the ministry because
[34:48] he's been rejected but he realizes i'll
[34:50] let so many people lay sick and then
[34:53] later on because of his rejection he
[34:54] throws himself in the breach interceding
[34:56] on behalf of the people
[34:58] and so much so brother branham tells his
[35:00] story and i want to get to this if
[35:01] that's okay
[35:03] and i'm just bouncing around i apologize
[35:07] got a headache so
[35:10] i'll be all over the place
[35:12] brother branham tells this story you all
[35:14] of which you know very well and the
[35:16] reason why i'm saying this
[35:18] you have to be
[35:20] this will say it blind bartimaeus this
[35:22] is when the brother band began to
[35:23] condemn this woman that he found in this
[35:25] restaurant this poor old thing blue
[35:27] looking hair was all over the place
[35:28] little bitty short clothes on a man
[35:32] any man would be ashamed to have on
[35:34] and he looked and she was drunk he
[35:36] looked all around oh mercy i thought god
[35:38] have mercy have you you've been how can
[35:42] you being so holy and righteous ever
[35:43] look upon a thing such as that looks
[35:46] like you would just have to smite the
[35:48] thing off does a little
[35:50] my my little sarah rebecca have to be
[35:52] raised up in such as this
[35:54] and two men excuse themselves and walked
[35:56] out in a few minutes i was standing
[35:57] there looking at a woman criticizing her
[35:59] with all that was within me thinking
[36:02] what a horrible thing
[36:04] but many times we should not do that we
[36:06] don't know what's the what's the inside
[36:09] story and it happened to be god taught
[36:11] me a lesson right here
[36:13] i stepped back behind the door and
[36:14] something said move back and when i
[36:16] knelt down to pray i looked and i saw a
[36:18] vision of the world turning it looked
[36:20] like
[36:21] crimson spray around it and i seen
[36:24] myself as it as i was first standing on
[36:26] the earth and every time i would do
[36:28] something wrong my sins would start up
[36:31] to god but jesus act as a bumper to to
[36:35] keep me my sins from getting to god and
[36:37] every time i would do something wrong
[36:40] then i looked
[36:41] like that my sins would go up towards
[36:43] god but jesus would catch it and i'd see
[36:46] tears running off of his cheeks and
[36:48] blood running off of his face he'd look
[36:51] up and say father he doesn't know what
[36:53] he's doing forgiving
[36:55] and i thought is that my sins doing that
[36:58] and i went up close to him i looked and
[37:00] there was a book laying open and my sins
[37:03] were
[37:04] were awful on it and i said dear lord
[37:07] jesus
[37:08] you mean that my sins have hurt your
[37:10] sides and made tears in your eyes and
[37:13] blood on your face he said it is
[37:16] i said please forgive me and he touched
[37:18] his side and wrote
[37:20] across the book pardoned and he throwed
[37:22] it behind him i said oh i'll ever be
[37:26] grateful to you and when he did he said
[37:28] i forgive you but you want to condemn
[37:31] her. and when he did that i was looking
[37:33] back at that woman again
[37:35] i walked over to where she was and i
[37:37] said how do you do she was drinking
[37:39] quite extensively and i said she looked
[37:41] up at me and she said oh how do you do i
[37:44] said could i sit down she said oh i've
[37:46] got company and i said not like that i
[37:49] want to tell you something and i sat
[37:50] down and told her and i looked at her
[37:52] and she started crying
[37:54] i said aren't you shane
[37:56] she said who are you are you that
[37:58] minister down there at the armory
[38:00] i said yes ma'am i'm brother branham she
[38:03] said i'm ashamed to face you brother
[38:04] branham she said my father's a methodist
[38:07] minister and i've got two daughters and
[38:08] one of them's a renowned christian the
[38:10] other one's a sunday school teacher
[38:12] she told me the story of her drunken
[38:13] husband and what and what she started
[38:16] she said there's no hopes for me i said
[38:18] if there is no hopes for you why did why
[38:21] did god just show me that vision and
[38:23] then i took her by the hand and i knelt
[38:25] down beside her at at the booth and led
[38:28] her to the lord jesus right there in
[38:30] that room when we got up the policeman
[38:32] was standing there and the girl was
[38:33] standing back there crying you see it
[38:35] made a difference
[38:36] and it
[38:37] you see you must look at things in the
[38:39] right way that you may know the story
[38:42] that's behind it
[38:44] you all know that story but i read that
[38:46] story because brother branham wants to
[38:47] condemn this woman he wants to bring
[38:49] judgment he wants to see judgment come
[38:51] upon this earth and upon this woman
[38:52] until god reminds him that every one of
[38:54] your sins is smacking jesus in the face
[38:57] is bringing blood to him and it's our
[38:59] sins on a daily basis that keeps us in a
[39:01] position where it ought to be allowing
[39:04] you to stay in an intercessory position
[39:06] if you understand what he's doing for
[39:08] you every single day
[39:09] it doesn't put you in a position where
[39:11] you're saying i'm good i'm out let the
[39:13] rest of you guys go the way they go no
[39:15] there's got to be a bride that throws
[39:17] himself in the breach here at the end
[39:18] time and it says this is a purpose i've
[39:20] come to this place for a purpose i've
[39:22] got a job to do there's breath in their
[39:24] body there's breath in mind and i just
[39:26] so happen to have access to the throne
[39:27] of god so i can actually do something to
[39:30] intercede on their behalf you see you
[39:32] have to feel for the people if you want
[39:34] to intercede i can say you're here to
[39:36] intercede but do you realize you have to
[39:38] feel the pain that they feel you have to
[39:39] be able to identify with them you have
[39:41] to be able to say you know what i don't
[39:42] know the story i don't know how they got
[39:44] to this position but you know what let
[39:46] me see if i can find out maybe i can do
[39:48] something
[39:49] we live in our own world we want to do
[39:50] our own things and you forgot your
[39:52] divine purpose
[39:53] this is the greatest expression of
[39:55] divine love the world has ever seen god
[39:57] is literally breaking himself up putting
[39:59] himself in many membered bride and
[40:02] allowing them to stay in the most humble
[40:03] simple positions as a farmer as a
[40:06] mechanic as a factory worker as a
[40:08] housewife
[40:09] he he's literally breaking himself up
[40:12] putting himself in common vessels to go
[40:15] reach people who's going to reach him
[40:18] how's god going to how's how they going
[40:20] to come to church
[40:22] how are they going to hear a sermon
[40:23] preached
[40:24] so god's going out to him
[40:26] he's literally breaking himself up this
[40:28] is the most supernatural display of
[40:30] mercy i could have ever imagined god
[40:32] literally tabernacling himself in common
[40:35] everyday individuals so that they can go
[40:38] as little secret
[40:40] weapons you could say infiltrating the
[40:42] devil's strongholds going to places that
[40:44] no one could ever get to and saying
[40:46] there he is he's working on a factory
[40:48] line and little does the devil know
[40:50] right there's an absolute son and
[40:51] daughter of god there to display god in
[40:54] the fullness of his glory as a
[40:56] consecrated life
[40:57] and now you have factory workers all
[40:59] around saying what is it about that
[41:01] person i just don't understand it
[41:04] you see he pulled one over
[41:06] he really pulled one over and then now
[41:09] what you have is you have this beauty
[41:11] you have this this people of god that
[41:13] are content in the state that they find
[41:14] themselves in
[41:16] they're content being the factory worker
[41:18] they're content being the mechanic
[41:20] they're content being the farmer they're
[41:23] content and being that which god went to
[41:25] great efforts to make so that they can
[41:27] stay right there in that position
[41:30] and glorify god and do the work that he
[41:32] left for you to do it's the most amazing
[41:35] thing if you think about it it's very
[41:36] common and very simple but wow it's
[41:39] pretty awesome
[41:41] it gives you some it just does something
[41:43] to you
[41:44] and i when i had shared this last week
[41:47] or the week prior to the kids because i
[41:49] feel now it fits
[41:51] is this fellowship of his sufferings
[41:53] paul said
[41:55] in philippians he said to be found in
[41:57] him not having mine own righteous which
[41:59] is of the law but that which is through
[42:01] the faith of christ the righteousness
[42:03] which is of god by faith that i may know
[42:06] him
[42:07] and the power of his resurrection and
[42:09] the fellowship of his sufferings being
[42:11] made conformable unto his death
[42:15] this is not exactly the pathway that i
[42:18] would like to choose in life
[42:20] but you realize you cannot even know him
[42:22] unless you you know god wants fellowship
[42:25] right so in order to have fellowship god
[42:27] became man so he could taste what
[42:29] sickness is taste pain taste rejection
[42:33] taste sorrow so he can understand you
[42:36] but then so that you can understand him
[42:40] god now puts you in the position as an
[42:42] intercessor god be it's the becoming god
[42:45] god becoming man
[42:46] you becoming god
[42:48] for fellowship
[42:50] so now he came down to earthly flesh to
[42:53] understand you now you're ascending to
[42:56] heavenly places as his representatives
[42:58] on earth so you can understand him
[43:00] this is beautiful this is
[43:03] beautiful brother braham says it right
[43:04] here he says now notice the threefold
[43:06] purpose manifest himself in jesus christ
[43:08] to to come unto the body by jesus christ
[43:12] to have the preeminences to restore back
[43:14] eden bring back that which is lost that
[43:17] only thing out of order and all the rest
[43:19] of his things was in order but he had to
[43:21] put man on a free moral agency so he
[43:23] could fall
[43:24] so that he might be a savior to display
[43:27] what was in him so his attribute of
[43:30] savior something had to be lost and the
[43:32] very thing that man fell and became lost
[43:34] he become the savior of that taking his
[43:37] own law that he could not do it as the
[43:39] great jehovah that covered all space and
[43:41] time he couldn't do it
[43:43] and he had to become a man and he took
[43:46] kinship that with a man that was lost
[43:49] amen because a man god made flesh
[43:51] hallelujah i get excited to think about
[43:54] it something on the inside god became
[43:57] from god to become man
[43:59] to take my sin upon him that he might
[44:02] make me him
[44:04] amen
[44:05] back to his great purpose of sons and
[44:08] daughters of god
[44:09] for he is the eternal father
[44:12] god went to great efforts to become man
[44:16] now he's going to great efforts to make
[44:18] man god
[44:20] dude hard to say but truth that's
[44:23] exactly what he's doing
[44:25] so now it's kind of important to
[44:27] remember your divine purpose because now
[44:28] it's god manifested in the flesh of you
[44:30] and me
[44:31] each and every day going to work staying
[44:34] at home as a mom displaying at the
[44:37] grocery store displaying it wherever the
[44:40] pantry i don't know wherever you go
[44:42] there's your pulpit
[44:44] i had a conversation with the missionary
[44:46] yesterday and
[44:47] loved the brother and he said you know
[44:49] really no one's traveling anymore i said
[44:50] it's probably a good thing now they can
[44:52] stop being so busy that they actually
[44:54] have to display christ in the life they
[44:56] live in every day living
[44:58] they'll actually have to be considerate
[45:00] in the fact the realization that their
[45:02] missionary field was the place that god
[45:04] placed them 99 of whatever they do in
[45:07] the world of missions will be right
[45:09] where they're living
[45:10] and the expressions at work and the
[45:12] expressions at the grocery store the
[45:13] expressions of the man that cut you off
[45:16] on the way from home
[45:17] this amazing thing pretty simple
[45:20] pretty common
[45:21] pretty much like isaiah 53 no beauty
[45:23] that we should behold it
[45:25] but are you content in that
[45:27] i'm finding myself to be very very
[45:30] relaxed and content in just being what
[45:33] god called me and made me to be
[45:35] i'm finding it's bringing a different
[45:37] level of rest just something i'm
[45:39] relaxing myself into relaxing myself
[45:42] into the fact that he's went to great
[45:44] efforts to build me make me a certain
[45:46] way now wherever i go god is on the move
[45:51] i know it
[45:52] i'm humbled by it but that's what he
[45:54] said he was going to do i'm not looking
[45:56] at my great merit or any great abilities
[45:58] that i have none of us do but you're
[46:00] looking what he did for you now that's
[46:02] supernatural
[46:04] i like to continue this feeling because
[46:06] i want you to understand you have to
[46:07] feel you have to feel for the people you
[46:09] cannot intercede you cannot help anybody
[46:11] unless you can feel for them
[46:13] brother branham says in re fellowship by
[46:15] redemption 1955
[46:18] quit your formal worship and get into
[46:20] fellowship with him once stop just going
[46:22] to church on sunday and wednesday and
[46:24] then praying your little prayer every
[46:25] night before you go to bed and really
[46:27] get out there into a fellowship why
[46:30] you'll hurry up and you'll wash the
[46:31] dishes just to get some fellowship again
[46:33] you'll be reading your bible and talking
[46:35] to him that's what we need that's what
[46:37] the world needs today christian friends
[46:39] that's what we need that's what i need
[46:41] that's what this whole world needs is
[46:43] back to a fellowship with him
[46:45] paul said the fellowship of his
[46:47] sufferings bearing the persecutions with
[46:49] him you know paul was a he was a man
[46:52] who'd suffered with christ
[46:54] and when that slave over there had run
[46:56] away
[46:57] paul had borne so much persecution so
[47:00] many things for christ to win that that
[47:04] runaway slave
[47:05] paul said wrote back to his master and
[47:07] said now after that slave has been
[47:10] converted don't treat him like a slave
[47:12] anymore you treat him like a brother
[47:14] said he owes you nothing if he does
[47:16] charge it to my account when i come i'll
[47:19] pray i'll pay you see he had been in the
[47:21] fellowship with christ and his
[47:23] sufferings till he knowed what it meant
[47:25] to be an outcast
[47:27] do you know what it means to be an
[47:29] outcast you know what it was to
[47:31] fellowship in his sufferings
[47:33] see paul knew and could sympathize with
[47:36] others and brother branham said that
[47:38] this was the key to his ministry
[47:41] it was his ability to sympathize and
[47:43] love people
[47:46] so many times we think that the
[47:48] our ministry is really going to get good
[47:49] or we're really going to have something
[47:50] we can display to god if we just figure
[47:52] things out a little bit more you know
[47:54] the greatest expression of of the power
[47:56] of god in your life would be to divinely
[47:58] love someone who does not love you
[48:01] i mean why does he seemingly bring it
[48:03] down to the most simple thing can you
[48:05] love the unlovely can you be outcast and
[48:08] still extend an arm of forgiveness can
[48:11] you be rejected despised and made fun of
[48:13] and still go to a cross for them
[48:15] i mean if you cannot do those things
[48:17] then
[48:19] you've missed the revelation of this
[48:20] whole thing to begin with
[48:22] something has missed it you've totally
[48:24] missed the whole purpose of the seventh
[48:26] seal mystery secret was it was christ in
[48:28] you displaying the attribute of christ
[48:31] his life of intercession and constant
[48:33] intercession on behalf of others you
[48:36] realize that brother branham even says
[48:38] this is why we have so much division you
[48:40] know why we have so much division
[48:42] because they don't understand what this
[48:43] is all about
[48:46] god is known in simplicity it's a
[48:48] revelation of jesus christ to the most
[48:50] illiterate person it is not a theology
[48:53] it is a revelation of jesus christ and
[48:56] it's upon this rock i'll build my church
[48:58] no other rocks are accepted no other
[49:00] things will be accepted no other roman
[49:02] rock no other protestant rock no other
[49:04] school no nothing but on exactly the
[49:08] revelation of jesus christ through a new
[49:10] birth he
[49:11] he's born there and he injects his own
[49:14] life in there and your life is gone and
[49:16] the life of christ is now projecting
[49:18] itself through you with the preeminences
[49:21] to the people that when they see the
[49:23] very life and works and signs and
[49:25] wonders that he did is doing the same
[49:27] thing through you
[49:29] outside of that the rest of it is not
[49:31] even called to it
[49:33] god's great revelation is unfolding by
[49:36] the lack of this revelation is why we
[49:38] have so many divisions among us and it
[49:40] is such a mockery so much division among
[49:43] us is because the people lack that
[49:45] revelation see they lack the revelation
[49:48] they do not understand what it is
[49:52] no ability to understand causes you to
[49:54] constantly criticize a lack of the
[49:56] revelation of christ and you unveiling
[49:57] itself is why you constantly need to
[50:00] criticize and constantly condemn others
[50:04] that don't see things the way you do it
[50:07] a lack of the revelation i think god i
[50:09] think we need to pray for more
[50:10] revelation of what actually our position
[50:13] in life is and why did christ call us
[50:16] why did he unveil his son not only to us
[50:19] but through us what's it all about
[50:22] remember
[50:24] remember your divine purpose remember
[50:27] your divine calling
[50:29] because without that sincere love and
[50:31] sympathy for somebody else
[50:33] you can't even display the great mystery
[50:35] revelation of christ
[50:37] so maybe just maybe god may foreordain a
[50:40] very difficult path for you
[50:43] a very difficult path of suffering and
[50:45] rejection and constant outcastness
[50:48] just so that you can display that
[50:50] mystery of christ
[50:52] that he wanted displayed in you you ever
[50:54] think of it
[50:55] like in order
[50:57] and because this is
[50:59] god became man now it's man becoming god
[51:02] in order to know him
[51:05] as
[51:06] one who would go to a cross and say
[51:07] father forgive them they don't know what
[51:09] they're doing it must be that i must
[51:11] find myself in the same position being
[51:13] spit at stoned ridiculed mocked and
[51:16] rejected and still have the heart of
[51:18] christ inside of me expressing father
[51:20] forgive them they don't know what
[51:21] they're doing
[51:22] they can't see it surely if they
[51:24] understood
[51:25] what it was that you were and what you
[51:26] were in me they would never ever do the
[51:28] things they're doing they certainly
[51:30] wouldn't do it
[51:31] they just wouldn't do it
[51:33] and see i think we lack that revelation
[51:36] and i think that's what happens to so
[51:37] many churches they lack the revelation
[51:39] of the mystery of actually what christ
[51:40] the mystery of god was saying this is
[51:42] why they feel a need to criticize mock
[51:44] and ridicule even other churches that
[51:47] don't see things the way they do
[51:49] just stop it
[51:51] they have to do that that's for a
[51:53] purpose you know paul had to do the
[51:55] things he do it was for a purpose
[51:57] it served god's purpose everybody is
[52:00] serving god's purpose they have a job to
[52:02] do and i got mine
[52:03] so we don't have to worry about it you
[52:05] ever think about that you're on the job
[52:06] working on a line you don't concern
[52:08] yourself with the other man down the
[52:09] road hey you know is he doing his job no
[52:11] you worry about yourself
[52:13] i've had to correct employers employees
[52:14] over time because they always want to
[52:16] tell me about what somebody else is not
[52:17] doing i says my friend you're not even
[52:19] doing what you're supposed to be doing
[52:20] why don't you do what you're supposed to
[52:21] be doing then we'll talk later
[52:24] you know
[52:25] so let's just be concerned that we're
[52:27] expressing christ in the simplicity that
[52:29] he called us to express it in
[52:33] brother branham says in god projecting
[52:35] his love
[52:36] there was an old man and i began to feel
[52:38] real sorry for him i looked he had an
[52:40] old ragged coat and i put my shoulders
[52:42] up to his and see if my
[52:44] coat would fit him i looked at his feet
[52:46] he had no shoes he had great calluses
[52:48] all over his feet he's dusty all over
[52:50] the place where his ragged trouser leg
[52:53] my shoe wasn't nothing
[52:55] big enough for him i began to look and i
[52:57] thought this poor old man
[52:59] never even had a good meal probably in
[53:00] his life all the ex economics of mexico
[53:03] was so poor the brick mason gets only
[53:05] about eight pesos a day he takes it
[53:07] about it gets it about four days of hard
[53:09] work
[53:10] to buy himself a pair of shoes
[53:13] and and i thought after all that then
[53:15] the nature the devil had given him evil
[53:18] to blind this poor man how cruel it was
[53:21] to him and i began to enter into
[53:23] something i can't express it it was a
[53:26] love it was a sympathy sympathy and this
[53:29] old fellow come and laid his head over
[53:31] on my shoulder and i hugged that old
[53:34] rugged coat and i said merciful god help
[53:37] this poor blind daddy if my dad would
[53:40] have lived he'd have been about this age
[53:42] will you help him
[53:44] and i heard him hollering glory adios
[53:46] and the man could see as good as i could
[53:49] and the beginning the people began
[53:50] screaming and everything what was it i
[53:53] was entering into the fellowship of his
[53:56] sufferings with his blindness
[53:58] you must do it and if ever i've had a
[54:01] success in praying for anyone is when i
[54:04] could enter
[54:05] into a fellowship with them and feel
[54:07] their infirmities and feel their
[54:10] conditions then something in you goes
[54:13] beyond all reasonings and prays a prayer
[54:15] of faith for the sick you've got to feel
[54:18] for a man you've got to sympathize with
[54:21] him you've got to get him before you
[54:23] before you can help me then you enter
[54:26] into some sort of a deepness it's a love
[54:29] of god and it goes beyond all human love
[54:32] i'm gonna tell you something you may
[54:34] class me as a fanatic but i feel like
[54:37] that i feel like i want to tell you
[54:39] anyhow many times like that frankly
[54:42] all my ministry has been wrapped up in
[54:44] that one thing if i can love them and
[54:47] sympathize with them
[54:50] long way of saying you can't help nobody
[54:53] unless you can feel their infirmities
[54:56] the key to brother branham's ministry
[54:58] and displaying divine love was to be
[54:59] able to identify you know what maybe i
[55:01] don't know the whole story maybe i
[55:03] shouldn't be so quick to condemn
[55:05] maybe they just don't understand maybe
[55:06] had a harder way
[55:08] but maybe god also ordained me to be
[55:10] able to come into contact with him
[55:11] because there's probably nobody else in
[55:12] this room that would ever sympathize
[55:14] with this one but i could sympathize
[55:16] with him i could put my arm around him i
[55:18] could help him
[55:21] i believe god's training a very elite
[55:24] humble group of people that actually
[55:26] feel what he feels
[55:28] understands what he understands
[55:31] because how else could he have ever done
[55:32] what he had done how else could he have
[55:34] done it unless he knew that he was
[55:36] restoring fellowship
[55:38] and if there's one thing i want to do i
[55:40] want to restore fellowship
[55:42] i want to restore fellowship between god
[55:44] and man with as many people as i
[55:45] possibly can do so while i'm in this
[55:47] earth i've got a job to do and i'm going
[55:48] to continue to do it though our eagle
[55:50] eye could get very filmed over and it
[55:52] all happens to each and every one of us
[55:54] i'm included
[55:55] but one thing's for sure i certainly
[55:56] don't want to leave my post of duty and
[55:58] forget why i came here
[56:00] god had a job for me to do i was sitting
[56:02] after i spoke this to the youth there on
[56:05] sunday i
[56:06] callie and i were she was going to bed
[56:08] and i just started talking to her i said
[56:09] honey i want you to know something right
[56:11] now you identify as callian the daughter
[56:14] of kyle and carrie wiker but one day my
[56:17] prayer is
[56:19] gee
[56:21] that you'll know
[56:22] you're a daughter of almighty god
[56:25] you had a divine purpose that you're on
[56:27] this earth for to fulfill
[56:28] and right now you don't know that but
[56:30] one day i believe you will
[56:32] and when you do you can fulfill what god
[56:34] called you to this earth for and i just
[56:36] began to explain to her just as simple
[56:37] as i know how you've got a divine
[56:39] purpose
[56:40] everything's for a reason whatever state
[56:42] you find yourself in be content god got
[56:45] you there for a reason don't up get
[56:47] upset don't be frustrated don't complain
[56:51] god's got you there for a reason relax
[56:54] and just trust that god's going to
[56:55] express his great purpose of his will in
[56:57] you
[56:59] through even suffering and rejection
[57:02] brother brown says
[57:04] this morning before i had gotten up i
[57:06] was talking to my wife i said honey
[57:08] couldn't be possible i'm this old it
[57:10] just looks like the years keep slipping
[57:11] by real quick i said but you know i was
[57:14] born in this world for some purpose and
[57:16] i believe that that's to serve god and
[57:18] that is my heart's desire
[57:20] what i would ask of you
[57:22] would be that you would be praying for
[57:24] me when you lay down tonight that god
[57:26] would keep me humble in my heart and he
[57:28] would help me and bless me so that i can
[57:31] be a blessing to you people i find out
[57:34] that the greatest blessing in all of
[57:36] life is giving out not receiving in but
[57:40] giving out you see what you do for
[57:42] others will mean so much
[57:46] living your life for others that was the
[57:48] purpose from the beginning
[57:51] if you will turn into colossians
[57:56] 3
[57:57] 12.
[58:08] um
[58:23] paul says here put therefore as the
[58:25] elect of god holy and beloved bows of
[58:27] mercy kindness humbleness of mind
[58:29] meekness and longsuffering
[58:31] forbearing one another and forgiving one
[58:33] another if any man have a quarrel
[58:35] against you even as christ forgave you
[58:38] so also do ye
[58:40] and above all these things put on
[58:42] charity which is the bond of perfectness
[58:47] you see you have to realize you've been
[58:48] forgiven of much in order for you to
[58:49] forgive
[58:51] you have to realize you were in great
[58:52] need sometimes the devil would like to
[58:55] lift you up and make you little prideful
[58:57] think you're something a little more
[58:58] special than what you are
[59:00] you're the grace of god you are special
[59:02] but don't forget what made you special
[59:04] was the grace of god choosing he chose
[59:06] you from before the foundation of the
[59:08] world and now he's revealing himself in
[59:10] and through you that's what makes you so
[59:12] special that's what puts you in a
[59:14] position because you have to be in the
[59:16] right position and actually in order to
[59:18] intercede for somebody else
[59:21] musicians will you come
[59:24] i'm sorry i can tell my voice is already
[59:27] going out so
[59:29] i think i've made my point god bless you
[59:34] why don't you stand with me
[59:52] i am reminded
[59:53] of the bride
[59:55] the third pole ministry that was
[59:56] displayed in sister hattie wright
[59:59] as she said the right thing and preached
[1:00:00] on that a while ago she said the right
[1:00:02] thing at the right time in the presence
[1:00:04] of the right person
[1:00:06] and because she could she was the right
[1:00:08] person literally and figuratively the
[1:00:10] right woman
[1:00:11] and she said the right thing that so
[1:00:13] pleased him
[1:00:14] she
[1:00:15] had the opportunity to
[1:00:17] deliver herself from the sufferings that
[1:00:19] she was in brother bam said if she'd ask
[1:00:21] for a million dollars he'd give it
[1:00:23] healing he'd give it whatever
[1:00:25] but she never asked for any of that she
[1:00:27] didn't ask for an easier life she then
[1:00:29] asked for anything that would
[1:00:32] lessen the pain of her family
[1:00:35] and you know make life easier
[1:00:38] she interceded on behalf of her two sons
[1:00:41] if she could ask for anything there was
[1:00:43] in the whole world brother brown said
[1:00:45] he'd have given it to her
[1:00:47] anything it did not matter
[1:00:49] but the one thing she chose the right
[1:00:51] thing
[1:00:52] she said the right thing she had her
[1:00:54] had her opportunity and her opportunity
[1:00:57] was just the salvation of her two boys
[1:00:59] that meant everything to her
[1:01:02] the comforts of this life she wasn't
[1:01:04] looking to be delivered
[1:01:05] she just wanted those two boys
[1:01:08] kind of puts things in reality
[1:01:10] it's kind of simple
[1:01:13] sometimes god hides in simplicity
[1:01:15] why don't you just bow your heads or
[1:01:17] word a prayer with me
