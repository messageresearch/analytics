[0:00] God would use that failure in Peter
[0:03] because now Peter come back humble and
[0:05] repentant. And Peter was full of pride,
[0:08] self assured. Amen. He was so confident
[0:10] in himself and he was lifted up in pride
[0:12] and God would let him be sifted as wheat
[0:14] and fall flat on his face. And he didn't
[0:16] say, "I pray that you wouldn't be
[0:17] sifted. I pray that your faith would
[0:19] fail, not through your sifting."
[0:23] &gt;&gt; So what is it that you're going through?
[0:25] Do you say, "God, I mean, we go to God,
[0:27] God, do you know what's happening to me?
[0:29] What a foolish thing to say.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; Or God, don't you see me?
[0:38] &gt;&gt; Another foolish thing to say. But it's
[0:40] exactly how we feel. We feel abandoned.
[0:42] We feel left alone. We feel like surely
[0:45] God would not permit this to happen to
[0:47] me. And the reality is the prophet of
[0:49] God told us there's nothing that happens
[0:51] in the life of a believer that doesn't
[0:52] first cross God's desk.
[0:55] &gt;&gt; He couldn't touch Jonah. Amen. without
[0:58] God's permission. He can't touch you
[1:00] without God's permission. He couldn't
[1:01] sift Peter without asking.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; And God a for Job for God for Job. Amen.
[1:09] He put limitations on what the devil
[1:11] could do. You can do this, but you can't
[1:13] do that. And then later he would ask
[1:15] again, "But you've got a hedge." He
[1:16] said, "But you can do this, but you
[1:18] can't do that." Amen. God knew exactly
[1:20] what was happening to Job. Job was
[1:22] confused. He had no understanding. He
[1:24] didn't know why. But God knew why.
[1:26] Because God was trying to answer his
[1:28] question and he was trying to accomplish
[1:30] his purpose.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; And that became a tremendous thing in
[1:34] Job's life and a tremendous thing for
[1:36] us. And it was a tremendous thing for
[1:38] Peter.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; And I look back over all my strains and
[1:42] stresses and troubles and cries to the
[1:45] Lord. And there's times that I literally
[1:47] prayed all night long
[1:50] because I had no answer and I was in the
[1:52] midst of a horrible trial and I didn't
[1:55] know what to do. And I prayed all night
[1:57] long. Listen, I never prayed all night
[2:00] long in my prosperity.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; I never got so close to God, so
[2:06] dependent on God. I never clutched his
[2:09] ankles
[2:11] and wrapped my arms around him and said,
[2:13] "I won't let you go." Like I did when I
[2:16] got that desperate.
[2:18] And I look back on that time in my life
[2:20] and God answered my prayer and he
[2:21] brought me through and he did a work in
[2:23] my life. And I'm thankful for that time.
[2:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is good.
[2:32] &gt;&gt; God is good and he does good and he does
[2:34] what's right. And even the thing that
[2:36] doesn't feel good is good.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham's nervous tension didn't
[2:41] feel good. His sour stomach didn't feel
[2:43] good. His getting the blues didn't feel
[2:45] good.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; But it was important.
[2:49] Paul's thorn in the flesh didn't feel
[2:51] good. Whatever we go through certainly
[2:54] doesn't feel good and we don't call it
[2:55] good, but it works together for good.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; And if it works together for good, then
[3:00] in everything we can give thanks.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
