[36:25] seats
[36:27] that was very appropriate with uh the
[36:30] special we had this
[36:32] morning did you
[36:34] notice uh is the god that
[36:37] cares God that
[36:40] heals and what disease does he heal the
[36:44] body the spirit the
[36:48] soul and that's why we have uh this
[36:51] morning we're going to talk about it and
[36:55] God
[36:57] um let me just go to the title and say
[37:01] that it's a holistic approach of the
[37:05] message okay it is
[37:08] not holistic my holistic approach to the
[37:12] message but is a message holistic let's
[37:16] just Define it for holistic
[37:20] um uh you know when you have a
[37:24] holistic doctor that doctor will look at
[37:28] you as a whole he will not just look at
[37:32] your high blood pressure diabetics but
[37:36] it will be the whole thing the whole
[37:39] person uh then you will look at your
[37:43] social life um emotional uh situation
[37:48] and you will look at uh your diet and
[37:51] everything a man woman as a a whole
[37:57] amen and we want to preach the message
[37:59] as a whole preach everything is true we
[38:03] want to preach everything because as you
[38:06] preaching everything then it balances
[38:09] out all right but this morning I'm not
[38:12] talking about it I'm talking about the
[38:15] holistic uh approach of the message
[38:19] toward
[38:21] us all right because the message is a
[38:24] person amen right
[38:27] the person of Jesus Christ he approach
[38:31] us not just as a um a peace but as a
[38:36] whole you look at us as a human as a
[38:40] body spirit and soul and the target we
[38:44] know is our soul right but yet God look
[38:49] at us in a in a holistic way he cares
[38:53] about us he cares about our body cares
[38:56] cares about our spirit which is our
[38:59] emotional realm all right and he cares
[39:03] about the soul and the devil also when
[39:05] he attack our body he attack our
[39:09] emotional level realm he attack our
[39:13] spirit his goal is also to reach our
[39:16] soul so we can doubt yeah the pain we
[39:20] have the suffering all that the target
[39:23] the purpose is for you to reject check
[39:26] the word amen right so that the same way
[39:31] the Lord uh does is the same way that he
[39:35] does he it takes care of us sometime we
[39:38] don't pay much attention God cares about
[39:41] you know your physical um care he cares
[39:45] about what you do you know and um I
[39:49] would just give you an example here in
[39:51] believing God in
[39:54] 1952 he say brother say I've got a
[39:57] little girl 8 10 months old a little
[40:00] Sarah and she's sweet like darling I
[40:03] have not got to be with her very much
[40:06] and I have spoiled her I will admit that
[40:09] just hold her in my arms all the time
[40:12] you would too if you don't you didn't
[40:15] get to see that little Chomp of love no
[40:18] more than what I get uh to see here her
[40:22] you know just now and then when I'm home
[40:25] I guess I spoke her her a lot more whole
[40:29] lot she's cutting some teeth and got
[40:33] real sick she must have got the centy
[40:37] also it's going around I guess some of
[40:41] you uh families have a twoo real sick
[40:44] vomiting and dentry and and so she was
[40:47] crying her mother was so tired that she
[40:50] didn't even wake up I never either and I
[40:53] woke up and I will sleep sleep back in
[40:56] the second room from her and her mother
[40:58] and her in there and the little girl and
[41:02] I I was sleeping in the other room
[41:03] little Rebecca and so Billy po was
[41:06] staying with this grandmother that night
[41:09] I woke up I heard I say what made me
[41:14] wake up like that and but I'm is
[41:18] sleeping his wife is sleeping and the
[41:22] baby is sick and Bam suddenly w up why I
[41:28] heard his voice say go to your baby and
[41:32] give her a drink of
[41:34] water what the angel of the Lord working
[41:38] up the prophet to tell him go give water
[41:41] to your baby why don't you just heal
[41:44] her but because we are Body Spirit and
[41:48] soul and the baby just need water and
[41:51] God cares that the baby receive water at
[41:54] that time yeah praise God my I went in
[42:00] the room and she was crying she was
[42:02] crying all the time she uh she must not
[42:05] have uh uh woke her mother up the mother
[42:09] is sleeping in her little crib I went to
[42:12] got a glass of water as I went in the
[42:14] little thing pretty near drank the the
[42:18] whole glass of
[42:20] water the so the angel knew that the
[42:23] baby was
[42:25] dehydrated he cares oh why he should not
[42:28] he should just uh heal her no come on
[42:32] God follows the same law that he
[42:35] established the law of nature right
[42:40] so and the Lulu think pretty near drank
[42:44] the whole glass of water and there in
[42:46] her condition there with the dent she
[42:50] had had and just I thought isn't that
[42:53] lovely how sweet he is to do that that
[42:57] the second time of the third time so he
[43:01] really cares about us and uh we know in
[43:05] this age God actually
[43:08] demonstrated by uh sending to us a gift
[43:13] where it could just touch your your
[43:18] right arm with right hand with a left

[53:48] oil but I can do that we do that I
[53:53] didn't pray I didn't scream I didn't do
[53:58] anything I just I see all the Ping of
[54:01] oil and The Stomping kinking and the
[54:04] loud hollering would not do a bit of
[54:07] good because he a is in a spiritual
[54:12] realm it is
[54:15] emotional a conversation with her was
[54:19] the solution amen right there was no
[54:23] prayer involved
[54:26] and sometime we don't know that's what
[54:28] happened maybe to you to
[54:30] me yeah this is what the prophet say
[54:34] that the truth that makes you free he
[54:37] tells the lady it's the truth when she
[54:40] got the truth she knew what was going on
[54:42] with her now she had a victory there's
[54:46] no prayer involved just to know it how
[54:50] many we need to know right so to you
[54:54] know and the word that was given to
[54:58] us came to us in a holistic way holistic
[55:03] approach to look at us the whole thing
[55:06] the whole package that we
[55:09] are ye shall know the truth and the
[55:12] truth shall set you free he say that's
[55:16] right isn't it beautiful amen amen a did
[55:21] you notice I put the few thing in uh
[55:24] blue here
[55:27] things that she should
[55:31] do well uh my daughter Rebecca one day
[55:36] uh show me that do you know um the five
[55:40] love
[55:42] language and there is a Baptist Minister
[55:45] who BR that some people mock it but what
[55:49] I realize is brother brandham talk about
[55:54] it did you see that amen they say the
[55:58] five love languages is a word of
[56:02] affirmation
[56:04] compliment quality time is not what she
[56:07] did give him a quality time clean up the
[56:12] house change the atmosphere is it know
[56:16] what she did in the quality time and she
[56:19] had a gift for him
[56:22] that's sick thck
[56:27] by I think all the brothers say that's
[56:30] it
[56:31] brother that's it and the fact that she
[56:36] she clean up she cook that a Act of
[56:39] service and then she sit in his lap is
[56:44] that true yeah yeah she sit in the lap
[56:47] put her arms around him kiss him and
[56:50] give him some word of
[56:53] airation Y you know what I mean I love
[56:56] you you're the best man you know in the
[57:00] world you always take care of us you
[57:04] know you always care you work hard for
[57:07] us and Men love it you know you want
[57:12] them they become like babies you
[57:14] know yeah you always do this for us
[57:17] you're so smart oh you help us you
[57:21] always take care of us and you see the
[57:23] man is like well I I try you
[57:30] know he's so happy and love comes
[57:34] naturally
[57:36] then amen cuz he has been
[57:41] fed
[57:44] literally
[57:45] and you know you know what I'm talking
[57:48] about yeah so God is so good to us
[57:53] church amen yeah you look at us in a
[57:55] holistic way
[57:59] um he loves us he he knows
[58:02] us and he
[58:07] cares yes a question let me just pull it
[58:12] I don't know what is under this question
[58:15] question and
[58:17] answer if you got a difference why
[58:20] either take it to the pastor and let him
[58:23] see that we think about it and so forth
[58:26] and then let it be uh submitted and
[58:29] don't take some Theory now it has to be
[58:33] brought in the word and a lot of time
[58:36] the pastor builds all those things up
[58:39] then when I come in is very humble
[58:42] brother Neville you know he is good he's
[58:47] just a little bit too humble we don't
[58:50] speak he he don't speak when he ought to
[58:53] speak so that that's that's right that's
[58:56] very strange you cannot be too
[59:00] humble you know but say you cannot be
[59:03] too sincere in the work of God how can
[59:06] you be too humble brother was talking
[59:09] some about something else he was
[59:12] Discerning what was in brother
[59:15] neille in his emotional
[59:19] real are you with me yeah and that was a
[59:24] hint in God Work y amen yeah
[59:30] so oh my let me just continue uh reading
[59:34] and pray I think it's not long ago we
[59:37] had a little
[59:38] talk ministers
[59:41] talk pretty tough the prophet say yeah
[59:45] but we can only read between lines here
[59:49] and get I say what's the matter brother
[59:51] Neville is this uh you are loving sort
[59:55] of brother and you don't want to to hurt

[1:00:37] in with somebody siding this way another
[1:00:41] one siding this way you got to stand on
[1:00:45] Mutual ground and draw together here and
[1:00:48] say this is it see is that what the
[1:00:51] solution that's this is the decision I
[1:00:54] make don't say I am not this is not my
[1:00:58] Tabernacle this is Billy Billy uh Bram
[1:01:04] Tabernacle so this is what he's telling
[1:01:06] him
[1:01:08] yeah see that's why he could
[1:01:11] say you cannot be too humble
[1:01:14] brother because that humility is not
[1:01:17] right is not
[1:01:20] humility you you
[1:01:22] trying you try trying to
[1:01:26] avoid to take care of big
[1:01:30] situations you know the day a pastor
[1:01:34] cannot talk straight to you and tell you
[1:01:36] the truth that day I think it's time to
[1:01:40] pull why it has to be free to tell you
[1:01:44] exactly what the Lord tells him
[1:01:49] absolutely and sometimes when like a
[1:01:52] person like me I go to some place and
[1:01:55] God used the gift to help the people
[1:01:59] sometime I we say that I heard a
[1:02:01] minister Pastor telling me that I
[1:02:04] thought go uh God sent me I have a gift
[1:02:07] I go somewhere I help his
[1:02:10] people is yeah but to paraphrase him or
[1:02:14] to put it in my own words I say that's
[1:02:18] true but that's not the whole truth you
[1:02:21] go help people but you are also a child
[1:02:24] of God as a minister as a pastor you are
[1:02:29] all you also have needs amen absolutely
[1:02:34] and God is taking care of those needs
[1:02:37] God is molding you you know changing you
[1:02:42] molding you you need help and I learn it
[1:02:45] I learn it Pittsburgh has been good to
[1:02:48] me because God really you know I I had
[1:02:51] to take that journey and look in the
[1:02:54] glass I'm not talking about this face
[1:02:57] you
[1:02:58] know you know what I mean this face is
[1:03:01] gray
[1:03:03] out but I could stand here and and look
[1:03:07] at myself straight in the mirror and say
[1:03:12] this is your being a
[1:03:14] coward that's your
[1:03:17] nature
[1:03:19] right you are h a peacemaker you are
[1:03:23] this but this is not about you this is
[1:03:26] about my word that I'm sending to my
[1:03:29] people you cannot use the J Kadima and
[1:03:33] put it on my
[1:03:35] way amen
[1:03:38] absolutely you cannot do that this is
[1:03:41] bigger than
[1:03:46] you
[1:03:48] right and then now I now I have to when
[1:03:53] I want to make a decision do something I
[1:03:56] look is this jead
[1:03:59] again or it is the
[1:04:05] word what did that the truth makes you
[1:04:09] free if you take the truth if you don't
[1:04:12] take it then it's like anything
[1:04:15] else what is the truth what is the
[1:04:17] knowledge that you never
[1:04:20] apply right can you put it in your
[1:04:23] resume some will
[1:04:26] do to inflate the
[1:04:30] resume but you have to use that
[1:04:32] knowledge amen and say I not just know
[1:04:35] it but I used it
[1:04:38] amen
[1:04:43] yeah oh
[1:04:46] my the the toughest decision sometime we
[1:04:51] make in life is the best
[1:04:55] because spiritual thinks is when you
[1:04:57] look spiritual think is not when you're
[1:04:59] doing it is usually when you look
[1:05:03] back oh this is what I did yes it was
[1:05:06] the word you see the result was good
[1:05:10] amen
[1:05:12] amen
[1:05:13] amen right are we together amen sir I'm
[1:05:18] still a good friend all right all right
[1:05:23] right way I'm say this
[1:05:25] how can I overcome and say you look back
[1:05:27] and say I'm doing this and I'm doing
[1:05:30] that no no you you are defeated but
[1:05:33] there's no condemnation to them which
[1:05:35] are in Christ Jesus and walk not after
[1:05:37] the flesh but after the spirit then you
[1:05:40] realize that that you are overcome
[1:05:44] you've overcome and you know that is a
[1:05:46] devil you can't say I got a sickness I
[1:05:50] don't believe it is a sickness don't say
[1:05:52] that recogn what you
[1:05:55] have yes it is a
[1:05:57] sickness it's my
[1:06:00] complexes it's my wounds my my scars
[1:06:03] that I'm bringing with me everywhere I
[1:06:07] go I have to recognize it who will make
[1:06:10] you accept that you have a free moral
[1:06:13] agency how who who will pull that out of
[1:06:18] you why are we afraid of looking taking
[1:06:22] that Journey amen
[1:06:24] You are not alone in that Journey You
[1:06:27] are not alone is with
[1:06:30] you right face
[1:06:33] it don't say I have no sickness oh you
[1:06:37] got
[1:06:39] it ah you got cancer you don't believe
[1:06:43] it is cancer doesn't matter it's a
[1:06:46] cancer it's a
[1:06:49] answer but remember greater is he that
[1:06:53] is in you that is in the world you must
[1:06:56] realize that the holy spirit that is in
[1:06:59] you has already overcome the thing
[1:07:02] that's the victory H he's in you and you
[1:07:05] can overcome by him that exactly
[1:07:09] sensible it's exactly the way the
[1:07:11] scripture is written
[1:07:15] overcoming oh
[1:07:18] my thank
[1:07:22] you that's exactly
[1:07:26] right another thing that the prophet
[1:07:29] said
[1:07:31] and the
[1:07:33] bridge they say that this is H the way
[1:07:37] in praying for the sick until you can
[1:07:39] find the cause I know the
[1:07:43] Cure but I've got to
[1:07:45] find the
[1:07:49] cause
[1:07:51] amen that's why the Visions are so
[1:07:53] needed and prominent to reveal the
[1:07:56] secret of the heart heart tells the
[1:07:59] person where you made your mistake and
[1:08:02] what you to do see no matter how much
[1:08:05] medicine you take and how much oil you
[1:08:08] put on their head and how loud anyone
[1:08:12] would scream over you if there is
[1:08:16] something wrong it will lay right there
[1:08:18] I say that's Satan that's
[1:08:21] right the Cure is always the name of the
[1:08:24] Lord Jesus Christ that The Cure who
[1:08:28] heals God heals how does he heal it
[1:08:32] doesn't matter he heals with all kind of
[1:08:36] things but it's still him
[1:08:40] healing amen but I need to know the
[1:08:44] cause because if I know the cause maybe
[1:08:46] I
[1:08:47] will know how to heal the healer is
[1:08:51] still God but the way he heals my body
[1:08:54] is not the same way he heals my
[1:08:57] spirit yeah the physical uh sickness not
[1:09:03] the same as emotional
[1:09:06] sickness but the same healer but if I
[1:09:09] know now I
[1:09:12] know now I know how to deal with it now
[1:09:16] I know to ask for prayers but I have to
[1:09:21] know the cause
[1:09:24] and God in this age has given us has has
[1:09:27] unveiled to us through his word
[1:09:30] everything in a holistic way and the
[1:09:34] word comes every day you hear the word
[1:09:37] it discerns sometime I preach message
[1:09:40] brother CH is preaching here or
[1:09:45] anybody you see the same them it's it's
[1:09:49] Discerning the this the problem is
[1:09:52] global is everywhere and God is
[1:09:54] Discerning and we we must receive the
[1:09:58] word there is no other solution we must
[1:10:01] receive the word the word has the power
[1:10:04] to change to mold to transform to make
[1:10:07] us a new creature amen that's what it
[1:10:20] is oh
[1:10:22] my I want to be a good
[1:10:28] boy that's that's just a
[1:10:30] me
[1:10:34] um sometime I yeah
[1:10:40] okay Lord amen Christ is revealed in his
[1:10:45] own
[1:10:48] word I was just uh talking to a young
[1:10:52] Minister and is wife in his room in in
[1:10:55] the room just a few moments ago and both
[1:10:58] of them are nervous just like the rest
[1:11:01] of the world rest of the human beings on
[1:11:04] Earth I say remember Satan got a Punch
[1:11:08] coming at you don't care who you are God
[1:11:12] he's got a right for that one punch
[1:11:16] which had you rather be that punch be
[1:11:19] blind be a
[1:11:22] AR a IC sitting in a chair or be
[1:11:26] nervous
[1:11:28] so what punch so all of us we will
[1:11:32] always carry something
[1:11:36] right as long as we live in this body we
[1:11:39] will be carrying
[1:11:41] something that we can ask God over and
[1:11:45] over and over he may decide that he's
[1:11:49] not going to remove it how can you say
[1:11:52] that brother well look at what a prum
[1:11:55] amen ears and ears of nervous tension
[1:11:59] stomach ears ears and ears God tells him
[1:12:03] it's just 6 in
[1:12:07] long is a
[1:12:09] little a little try test it's going to
[1:12:14] go away well do you know when he went
[1:12:17] away just a couple months before he died
[1:12:21] yeah looks like he needed it
[1:12:24] but the point is to know
[1:12:26] it face
[1:12:29] it present it to the Lord let him say
[1:12:32] that my grace is
[1:12:35] sufficient let him say that if he
[1:12:37] doesn't say it continue praying about it
[1:12:40] but there are things that will be there
[1:12:43] and then if the devil is got right to
[1:12:48] that open uh to that open place now
[1:12:52] that's the spot you got to keep covered
[1:12:55] all the
[1:12:57] time and to see this nervous age that we
[1:13:00] are living in so the Lord say that there
[1:13:03] will be always something
[1:13:06] flaws did not we hear the Masterpiece is
[1:13:10] a masterpiece because he has
[1:13:14] flaws I was I was watching with
[1:13:19] you I told you Wednesday I'm free so I'm
[1:13:23] here
[1:13:29] questions and answers brother Bram when
[1:13:33] someone gets on step on my toes this
[1:13:38] might be a good
[1:13:40] one step on my toes as the old the
[1:13:43] saying is my temper
[1:13:46] Rises how can I overcome this thing I
[1:13:50] know the Lord will have to do it but
[1:13:52] what can I I do in my heart that's a
[1:13:55] very good question in my heart that's
[1:13:57] what the problem is I I I have to be
[1:14:02] with the Lord I have to be in God's
[1:14:05] favor meaning God word I want to apply
[1:14:08] God word and what do I do in my heart I
[1:14:12] have that temper and he
[1:14:14] say sweeten your temper with prayer then
[1:14:18] make up your mind and then make a good
[1:14:20] decision make a decision that is
[1:14:23] contrary to the thing that is contrary
[1:14:27] to the word sweeten your temper you see
[1:14:30] the The Cure is the word The Cure is a
[1:14:36] person the person of Jesus Christ the
[1:14:39] way he hears a different way but he he
[1:14:43] hears like hear is telling him to
[1:14:47] sweeten his temper by prayer wake up in
[1:14:50] the morning start your day by reading
[1:14:53] the word and praying amen that's it
[1:14:57] that's the solution take it and go
[1:14:59] challenge the Lord and say you told me
[1:15:01] to do that yeah right
[1:15:04] amen amen yeah right I guess uh there's
[1:15:10] too many people in the building had any
[1:15:13] more temper than I did so brother bam
[1:15:16] can relate to
[1:15:22] it
[1:15:24] oh I had a mouth mashed all the time oh
[1:15:28] my goodness that boy has a very rough uh
[1:15:32] you know childhood yeah and I taken a
[1:15:36] lot of my meals out of a straw poor
[1:15:41] boy so he can relate to that God relate
[1:15:44] to all the things that we go through my
[1:15:47] case is unique no no I was reading to
[1:15:49] the church where brother bam say uh Tri
[1:15:53] are just
[1:15:55] L and temporary I'm I'm just I'm not
[1:16:00] quoting Faithfully but something like
[1:16:02] that you see our tests and tries are
[1:16:04] just
[1:16:06] small temporary
[1:16:09] mine you
[1:16:14] too
[1:16:16] yeah but it's just to build that
[1:16:19] material so we can get to that adoption
[1:16:22] so we can speak like him the purpose of
[1:16:26] this message this morning is that we
[1:16:30] will have to display him we will have to
[1:16:34] speak like the father amen and when
[1:16:38] people look at us they see that they see
[1:16:42] Christ
[1:16:43] manifested you know we talk like him
[1:16:46] that's why sometime he let those test
[1:16:49] and tral come and it's good for us I of
[1:16:53] course when I go through that I don't
[1:16:55] say this is good for
[1:17:00] me hope you know hopefully nobody
[1:17:05] understand that that way it's not like
[1:17:07] we say oh send those test to
[1:17:11] me no I'm
[1:17:17] scared to a point sometime you may
[1:17:20] wonder why this morning there was no TR
[1:17:24] fire and I I have to preach and there
[1:17:28] was
[1:17:29] nothing chances that the service will
[1:17:32] not be
[1:17:37] good
[1:17:41] yeah we are Body Spirit and
[1:17:46] soul God heals our body he heals our
[1:17:50] soul our spirit and soul Soul amen we
[1:17:55] contact the the nature with our Natural
[1:17:58] Body we contact it we have five senses
[1:18:02] of uh the
[1:18:04] spiritual realm and there is one that
[1:18:09] has no uh multiple senses it has no
[1:18:13] emotion has nothing like that that's the
[1:18:18] soul and God is always targeting that
[1:18:22] soul
[1:18:24] amen wow when this the body has senses
[1:18:29] the spirit has senses the soul has no
[1:18:33] emotion see it's
[1:18:35] amazing and God will speak to us
[1:18:40] straight without any
[1:18:43] interference it's the third
[1:18:47] pole it's not a public
[1:18:51] display is that
[1:18:54] right it's like entering in your closet
[1:18:58] and close in with
[1:19:01] him do you know that the angel could not
[1:19:06] get with the the patient in that boxy
[1:19:11] place do you know that even the angel
[1:19:14] who was sent to brother brandham did not
[1:19:17] get with the patient in that boxy place
[1:19:21] it was the the fill of fire alone with
[1:19:25] the individual in his closet a personal
[1:19:30] relationship with him am what a
[1:19:33] privileged people we are we are actually
[1:19:36] Mystic
[1:19:38] people we we are Mystic we're living in
[1:19:42] a world that people don't even have any
[1:19:46] clue living here but also living there

[1:20:17] intellect is speaking straight to our
[1:20:20] soul because it's a soul will understand
[1:20:23] what the the emotional realm will not
[1:20:28] understand it's not Jesus say John
[1:20:35] 3 and no man had ascended up to heaven
[1:20:39] but he that came down from heaven even
[1:20:42] the son of man which is in heaven what a
[1:20:46] mathematic well well this is really hard
[1:20:50] for the people that see everything in
[1:20:52] three
[1:20:54] dimension he saying no one went there
[1:20:57] except me who came from there me who

[1:22:25] Dimensions that in one package and God
[1:22:29] takes care of all of the

[1:25:39] it to happen in me I want a closer
[1:25:46] walk I am an individual with my personal
[1:25:50] relationship with Christ

[1:26:47] the Church of God is actually saying
[1:26:49] that we we are our brothers
[1:26:53] Keepers our sister
[1:26:56] Keepers that's strange yeah we we un
[1:27:00] train do you know the parable that say
[1:27:02] don't pick them up too soon because they
[1:27:06] an twin it's a
[1:27:09] body
[1:27:10] right then we take care of our own
[1:27:14] we we take care of
[1:27:18] issues we don't have always to involve
[1:27:21] the pastor to reconcile with someone the
[1:27:25] first person that sees a person doing
[1:27:27] something wrong is the one who speak to
[1:27:30] that person but yet we are
[1:27:35] scared to go reconcile with a brother
[1:27:38] who has done wrong because of our
[1:27:43] culture our culture can doesn't like to
[1:27:47] look somebody straight even politely
[1:27:50] with all love and tell them this is
[1:27:53] wrong this is wrong our culture pretend
[1:27:57] that there is nothing
[1:28:04] wrong and then we let things come in a
[1:28:08] church and destroy the
[1:28:13] atmosphere and God say I left that to
[1:28:16] you why did even God give us gift we
[1:28:20] don't focus on gifts but they are there
[1:28:24] for the church to cleanse the
[1:28:27] church is that right because God want
[1:28:30] you to be your brother's
[1:28:33] keeper
[1:28:35] absolutely the gift come there so you
[1:28:38] can see something and tell the person
[1:28:40] the day we will be that church something
[1:28:43] may happen where we can talk to my
[1:28:47] brother with love and care and the
[1:28:50] person is not offend Ed because we are
[1:28:54] afraid because the people are easily
[1:28:57] offended so you always see something
[1:29:00] wrong with in on me I was I was maybe
[1:29:04] new in the United States
[1:29:06] when uh I went to work I don't know what
[1:29:10] I had on my
[1:29:12] face I don't know what I had in my face
[1:29:15] and all these people are my friend you
[1:29:18] know nobody dares me you have something
[1:29:22] on your face
[1:29:24] church this is when I start getting a uh
[1:29:28] a
[1:29:29] mirror cuz nobody tells
[1:29:33] you it's
[1:29:37] terrible but the prophet tells us that
[1:29:40] we should not have a national
[1:29:42] spirit is over the devil you are a
[1:29:45] Christian if you see your brother sister
[1:29:48] has a problem you pray about it you feel
[1:29:51] led talk to them if they're angry why
[1:29:54] they are angry they're supposed to have
[1:29:56] the Holy
[1:29:57] Ghost they supposed to know is the love
[1:30:00] that direct you to them
[1:30:03] yeah now everything goes back to the
[1:30:06] pastor Pastor I saw the sister so and so
[1:30:09] a brother and so the pastor has to go
[1:30:12] and my that's not the way it works
[1:30:15] brother CH maybe I don't okay thank
[1:30:20] you because I'm stepping up in his ter
[1:30:24] territory now right but you know what I
[1:30:27] mean but I'm a pastor too by the
[1:30:35] way it would be wonderful when when I
[1:30:39] believed I was like in the 21 22 you
[1:30:43] will see before the Surface Two Brothers
[1:30:46] are outside the church talking we will
[1:30:49] look at them and smile they're fixing
[1:30:52] some
[1:30:53] issues we just say
[1:30:56] that yeah and that's how it should
[1:31:01] be am oh
[1:31:06] my we have a different dimensions and
[1:31:11] God is taking care of the whole thing
[1:31:15] thank God for that we don't know how
[1:31:17] spiritual things
[1:31:20] work uh
[1:31:23] but we are more than one dimension
[1:31:26] amen the prophet say that's the way it
[1:31:29] is to all believer they are Mystic they
[1:31:32] people don't understand because they
[1:31:34] live in the world to themselves Jesus
[1:31:38] Liv in the world a world that nobody
[1:31:42] else could touch the disciples could not
[1:31:45] understand him when he spoke to them

[1:32:15] him and we are like
[1:32:19] that uh we even are not of this world
[1:32:23] because we are not of this world because
[1:32:26] we come from
[1:32:28] Heaven yeah our people may not
[1:32:32] understand it they cannot understand
[1:32:34] that's what the prophet say are we not
[1:32:36] like looking down on them and say I Come
[1:32:39] From Heaven you are nothing no this is
[1:32:42] the
[1:32:43] reality to encourage me encourage
[1:32:47] you yeah so that you can look for the
[1:32:50] things of above
[1:32:52] more than that are
[1:32:54] here
[1:32:57] amen question answer Genesis I think the
[1:33:01] people today that are possessed with
[1:33:03] this spirit this Spirit a part of the
[1:33:07] Angelic beings Spirits which rotate of
[1:33:11] of of God that never fell in in the

[1:34:28] tell people that when we lay hands on a
[1:34:32] people there's nothing in our hands and
[1:34:36] it's just a uh obeying the Commandment
[1:34:40] of God I realized that maybe I was not
[1:34:44] right I realize that because this is
[1:34:46] what the prophet says and God's provide
[1:34:49] place of worship he say your hand dep on
[1:34:52] the people has got quickened power in
[1:34:55] them if you have been quickened have you

[1:35:25] proving that he's here that the uh at
[1:35:28] the days of
[1:35:31] Sodom then the prophet is bringing
[1:35:33] another aspect we know that we are not
[1:35:37] in in a doctrine of laying hands and
[1:35:40] like like if we were the Jewish people
[1:35:44] but yet when you look at brother brand
[1:35:46] at the end of his life he more and more
[1:35:50] asking people to lay hands on each other
[1:35:53] that's right
[1:35:55] yeah well remember Jesus Christ is the
[1:36:00] same yesterday today and forever in all
[1:36:04] detail all aspect of it except the body
[1:36:08] that went to the grave but where is the
[1:36:11] body in you and
[1:36:14] I that's why you can
[1:36:16] say that laying hands on the people when
[1:36:20] you have a quick and
[1:36:22] power right amen this is different from
[1:36:25] just laying hand as a tradition this is
[1:36:28] I'm part of the body he is in the body I
[1:36:32] can just lay
[1:36:34] hands my my do you understand who we are
[1:36:38] we are Mystic being there is something
[1:36:41] in us and the devil want to Rob us from
[1:36:44] it and this morning we are saying no by
[1:36:48] the word of God that the authority that
[1:36:51] the word of God give us we are saying no
[1:36:54] and God cares about us the body the
[1:36:57] spirit and the soul today we can get
[1:37:01] Victory because he's here he's in his
[1:37:09] body oh praise God
[1:37:13] amen
[1:37:16] amen
[1:37:19] oh oh my
[1:37:22] same
[1:37:26] thing same thing you are H you are
[1:37:30] husband you have your personal
[1:37:33] relationship with
[1:37:34] Christ but you also have
[1:37:39] relationship as a unit husband and wife
[1:37:44] have you noticed that how God keep up
[1:37:47] with all that body spirit and soul
[1:37:51] believer member of the body
[1:37:55] husband
[1:37:58] wife living here living
[1:38:03] there the theop any over there the body
[1:38:08] here you also God look at you say
[1:38:11] individual but he looks also at you he
[1:38:14] sees not one it is two
[1:38:18] amen it's real yeah
[1:38:22] it really see you as a one husband and
[1:38:25] wife as not two but
[1:38:29] unit it's
[1:38:32] amazing but he does that I don't know
[1:38:34] how he does
[1:38:37] it sometime we try to explain spiritual
[1:38:41] matters but again I'm saying we are not
[1:38:44] talking to your intellect your soul will
[1:38:47] capture what we are talking about amen
[1:38:58] marriage of the Lamb did you ever read
[1:39:00] in the scripture how that the first man
[1:39:03] God made was a jeel person I had a whole
[1:39:08] message preaching about Je
[1:39:11] jeel duality in God
[1:39:14] word you
[1:39:16] know the first man God made was a jewel
[1:39:20] person Adam was both Adam and Eve
[1:39:24] spiritually speaking but when he made
[1:39:26] the first man in his own image and God
[1:39:30] is a spirit but when he put them in the
[1:39:33] flesh he separate them he he he taken
[1:39:37] the masculine Spirit but put it in the
[1:39:40] man and taken the feminine spirit and
[1:39:43] put it into the
[1:39:46] woman amen therefore you are dual yeah
[1:39:51] you know two things two
[1:39:56] Concept in one only God can do
[1:40:02] that and he say I did it no man should
[1:40:06] put us
[1:40:07] under and then when he look at you in
[1:40:10] your marriage he look at you as a
[1:40:14] unit you have your personal relationship
[1:40:17] your wife has your husband
[1:40:19] has
[1:40:21] but you have individual relationship but
[1:40:24] you have a relationship as
[1:40:27] two a one
[1:40:30] entity and God sees it as real as you
[1:40:34] and I are God sees the the two of you as
[1:40:37] a unit that's
[1:40:39] right therefore When you pray let me
[1:40:42] just go ahead and say when you pray
[1:40:45] there are prayers that you make to God
[1:40:48] between you and God but but there are
[1:40:51] prayers that God sees you as a unit
[1:40:53] where is your wife Adam where is your
[1:40:59] wife oh yeah yeah yeah my husband is
[1:41:02] more spiritual than we're covered in our
[1:41:05] house no no it doesn't work that way
[1:41:07] that's right oh you know my wife is very
[1:41:10] spiritual person God will hear I like to
[1:41:12] send her to church so she can be
[1:41:14] submissive to
[1:41:18] me I always use some sarcasm but I
[1:41:22] should not is I I'm a picture
[1:41:25] person that's what this thinks that look
[1:41:29] like sarcasm because I picture it and
[1:41:32] you see it you see how bad it is just
[1:41:34] the way I say it you see how bad it is
[1:41:37] then you understand is
[1:41:39] wrong
[1:41:45] amen no God uh God doesn't do that uh
[1:41:51] how are we doing about
[1:41:54] time
[1:41:58] Malachi Malachi 2 oh we always read
[1:42:02] Malachi 4A yeah go back to Malachi 4
[1:42:06] because that's what we read
[1:42:08] here no we're going to read Malachi 2
[1:42:11] because I say
[1:42:13] so
[1:42:15] okay okay and this has yet done again
[1:42:21] cover the altar of the Lord with tears
[1:42:25] with weeping and with crying out in so
[1:42:28] much that he regardeth not the offering
[1:42:31] anymore and receive it with
[1:42:36] Good Will at your
[1:42:39] hand huh you have come to the god altar
[1:42:43] with tears weeping crying but God
[1:42:47] doesn't look at
[1:42:49] it yet he say wherefore because the Lord
[1:42:52] had been witness between thee and the
[1:42:56] wife of thy youth against whom thou Hast
[1:43:00] dealt
[1:43:02] treasurly yet she thy
[1:43:06] company and the wife of thy
[1:43:09] Covenant I will not listen to your
[1:43:12] prayers because you mistreat your wife
[1:43:16] but remember the Old Testament did not
[1:43:18] just talk about women it did not talk
[1:43:22] about women he talks about
[1:43:25] men all right therefore what he's
[1:43:27] talking about here is the marriage am
[1:43:32] mistreating not being at your
[1:43:35] position in the marriage amen right man
[1:43:39] leading his family with the word and
[1:43:43] with love amen the wife is the mother is
[1:43:48] the pastor of the children she's
[1:43:51] submissive to the father to the
[1:43:55] husband therefore when they come with
[1:43:58] weeping and crying God hears their
[1:44:01] prayers because they are one unit that's
[1:44:04] how God sees them he cannot even
[1:44:07] separate them in that regard that's
[1:44:10] right
[1:44:14] amen you know some people say to Jesus
[1:44:16] this is not
[1:44:18] fair I I have my Christian Life wife my
[1:44:21] wife is doing something else my husband
[1:44:23] is doing something the Lord doesn't say
[1:44:25] that look look they asking him about
[1:44:28] putting away the wives and and you see
[1:44:33] they asking him about putting away he
[1:44:35] say they say in Matthew 19 they say uh
[1:44:39] unto him why did Moses then command to
[1:44:42] give a written of divorcement and to put
[1:44:45] her away he say unto them Moses because
[1:44:48] of the hardness of your heart heart
[1:44:51] suffer you to put away your wives but
[1:44:55] from the beginning it was not so amen
[1:44:58] and I say unto you whosoever will put
[1:45:01] away his wife except it be for
[1:45:05] fornication and shall uh marry another
[1:45:10] commit adultery whosoever married he
[1:45:14] which is put that away that commit
[1:45:19] adultery
[1:45:21] and they will ask him I don't see it
[1:45:23] here in the PowerPoint they will ask him
[1:45:27] if that is the condition of a man toward
[1:45:31] his wife then it's not
[1:45:35] worthy and Jesus said to them it's not
[1:45:38] given to everyone to understand this
[1:45:42] it's a
[1:45:46] mystery that there will be people that
[1:45:49] need to understand understand the
[1:45:51] mystery of marriage and divorce because
[1:45:54] he not starting here on Earth he
[1:45:57] starting up there it's God having his
[1:46:02] family and he want us to replicate the
[1:46:06] same thing that he had in
[1:46:15] heaven Peter
[1:46:18] says likewise he
[1:46:20] husband dealt with them according to
[1:46:23] knowledge giving honor unto the wife as
[1:46:26] unto the Wecker vessel and as being ears
[1:46:31] together of the grace of life that your
[1:46:35] prayers be not
[1:46:39] injured so so you have to
[1:46:43] be together in
[1:46:46] harmony everyone respecting what the
[1:46:50] word say about them yeah right then when
[1:46:54] you pray God listen to your prayer looks
[1:47:00] like some prayer are
[1:47:02] individual prayers some prayers are
[1:47:06] common as a unit and God will hear those
[1:47:10] prayers if you are in one unit amen yeah
[1:47:16] right this is not me I'm not being
[1:47:19] legalistic
[1:47:20] it's just the way it's just the way God
[1:47:24] made things to to be sure that you stay
[1:47:28] at the position and you reflect him on
[1:47:31] Earth that's all that's
[1:47:34] all a little spanking here and there to
[1:47:38] keep you into the grow growing into the
[1:47:42] adoption that's what he's doing he say I
[1:47:45] will not listen to your prayers but but
[1:47:47] God listen to our prayers he could
[1:47:49] listen more more he could answer
[1:47:53] more you see brother Bram taught us
[1:47:56] something that to be sensitive to the
[1:47:59] Holy Ghost brother Bram will know that
[1:48:02] God is not with me even though I'm going
[1:48:05] and lay hands on people miracles happen
[1:48:08] he still know God is not in me I feel
[1:48:13] empty true so he could give us more more
[1:48:18] of relationship with him it could give
[1:48:20] us
[1:48:23] more as a couple we cannot
[1:48:27] be
[1:48:29] separated is a unit yet I yet as a
[1:48:34] husband I have my personal relationship
[1:48:36] with Christ wife you should have a
[1:48:39] relationship with Christ but yet again
[1:48:43] he can change a little bit his glasses
[1:48:46] and see us as a unit yeah amen
[1:48:50] right why it's always a cleaning God
[1:48:53] cleanses his people he cleanses the
[1:48:56] church through gifts he cleanses the
[1:48:59] churches through the word when he comes
[1:49:02] you hear the word you tell your brother
[1:49:04] you reconcile with your brother constant
[1:49:07] cleansing cleansing cleansing because we
[1:49:10] have to display him we have to reflect
[1:49:14] him we have to act like
[1:49:19] him
[1:49:20] we have to have these things
[1:49:24] multiplying more and more Among Us I
[1:49:28] have not done
[1:49:30] enough I I remember living my house I
[1:49:35] had my neighbor coming to me and one of
[1:49:38] them was
[1:49:40] crying we're crying I never done
[1:49:42] anything actually I never done anything
[1:49:46] good I never shovel there
[1:49:49] s
[1:49:51] one one come to me and say you've been
[1:49:54] such a nice
[1:49:58] neighbor truly you've been and they have
[1:50:01] been good to me actually my job require
[1:50:04] I have some uh clearance okay don't
[1:50:08] tease me about it but clearance for my
[1:50:11] job security and things like that and my
[1:50:14] neighbors they the government will go to
[1:50:17] my neighbors talk to them is it a good
[1:50:22] guy yeah good recommendation what did I
[1:50:26] do to them I should do
[1:50:28] something but I did not it's not me it's
[1:50:32] the grace of God in Me but it will be
[1:50:35] great if also I can display really
[1:50:39] Christ to them because that's what we
[1:50:41] are doing here otherwise our body will
[1:50:44] be changed
[1:50:45] already right we are still here so
[1:50:49] someone
[1:50:50] can be influenced positively with our
[1:50:57] life therefore God is looking at us in a
[1:51:01] holistic
[1:51:02] way yeah your body how you take care of
[1:51:06] it your your your spirit your emotions
[1:51:11] those things those complexes if they
[1:51:14] make who you
[1:51:16] are that's what it is and God say I
[1:51:20] don't like what I see you can do better
[1:51:22] than that and I have
[1:51:25] provided for the solution I'm here to
[1:51:29] help you you are not
[1:51:31] alone amen
[1:51:33] right therefore when all these things
[1:51:36] are
[1:51:37] gone I mean they will not go all but we
[1:51:41] will know we will keep them under the
[1:51:44] blood
[1:51:46] amen and then we will display Christ
[1:51:49] more
[1:51:50] and more and
[1:51:52] more do you believe that yes sir yes
