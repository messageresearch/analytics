[0:00] that God promised and said I'll never
[0:02] leave you I'll never forsake you I'll
[0:05] always be with you you know what my
[0:07] faith says amen my faith says amen I
[0:11] didn't Merit that I don't deserve that I
[0:13] should have grieved him away and he
[0:14] should have left me and found somebody
[0:16] else way better than me a long time ago
[0:18] everyone but it's election
[0:20] God's election God foreordained me to
[0:24] stand in this hour God foreordained me
[0:26] to come across this message God foreign
[0:28] that that light would strike your life
[0:30] God foreordained the situation God even
[0:33] foreign major problems sometimes just as
[0:36] the vehicle to bring you and Usher you
[0:38] into the very Presence of Jehovah God
[0:40] you look at Jonah my what a bad
[0:43] situation Joan is in backsliding running
[0:46] from God from the carnal mind it looks
[0:49] like it we all know brother Benham said
[0:50] no I was prophets of God can't backside
[0:52] but he was certainly doing his best to
[0:54] get away from what God had purposed him
[0:56] to do so none of us are in this bad of a
[0:59] state brother Benham said he says I look
[1:00] this way whale's belly I look this way
[1:02] whale's belly I'm all tied up in seaweed
[1:04] I'm laying in vomit but what did Jonah
[1:06] do he remembered Solomon prayed a prayer
[1:10] and when Solomon prayed a prayer he said
[1:12] if any of your children be in trouble
[1:14] let them look this way and God would
[1:17] deliver them Jonah in the belly of a
[1:19] whale covered in vomit remembers the
[1:21] promise of God
[1:23] and he went to delivering so then what
[1:25] happened the very vehicle that looked
[1:28] like his destruction was the very
[1:30] vehicle God uses to deliver him to
[1:32] fulfill his purpose so many times we get
[1:34] so upset why this situation why this
[1:37] problem why am I in this don't you
[1:39] realize this could be the very vehicle
[1:41] that God is using to test your faith to
[1:43] turn you back to the promise of God and
[1:46] God will take that vehicle to Usher you
[1:48] right back into fellowship with him I
[1:50] believe that I'm going to be real honest
[1:53] I absolutely believe these things with
[1:56] all my heart my carnal mind doesn't
[1:58] understand it but something down inside
[2:00] of me says that's nothing but the truth
[2:02] God's word can't fail I will fail God
[2:05] can't and I'm resting in that my faith
[2:09] is resting in that my salvation is
[2:11] resting that he did this work me being a
[2:14] part of that elect bride of Jesus Christ
[2:16] I realized I didn't Merit you can't
[2:19] Merit it you ain't figuring your way
[2:21] into this gun guys this is a sovereign
[2:23] Act of God God's Victory not my victory
[2:27] his victory and he is bringing me into
[2:31] his presence I'm not figuring this out
[2:33] I'm not trying to say okay if I make
[2:35] that one and I figured this one and then
[2:36] I do this and then I do that forget
[2:38] about it I have no confidence in myself
[2:41] I have Supreme confidence that this is
[2:43] all God's plan all things were created
[2:45] by Him and for him he said he would have
[2:48] a bride of who's choosing his choosing
[2:50] oh my I'm so glad I didn't go looking
[2:54] for him he came looking for me
