[0:00] everything all around us can be falling
[0:02] apart and be shaken
[0:04] like there can be you know atmospheres
[0:06] of uncertainty and that uncertainty can
[0:08] get closer and closer to us
[0:10] amen there can be still more fallout
[0:13] from the pandemics and other things and
[0:15] other tensions that are going on
[0:17] there can be many more things that take
[0:19] place and a lot more repercussions and
[0:21] more uncertainty
[0:22] either in this wave or another wave or
[0:24] another thing that strikes there
[0:26] whatever it is
[0:28] and that uncertainty can get closer and
[0:30] closer to home it can affect our
[0:32] employment our jobs
[0:33] and it can affect all kinds of things
[0:37] but but we are secure
[0:40] in a kingdom that cannot be shaken
[0:43] so everything all around us become start
[0:46] falling apart
[0:47] we've got to realize that it has to fall
[0:50] apart
[0:51] it's got to fall apart the world is
[0:54] falling apart brother brenham said
[0:55] let it fall apart and we work so hard
[0:59] sometimes to hold things together
[1:01] what we need to do is resolve ourselves
[1:03] to the fact that it's going to crumble
[1:05] it's going to burn
[1:06] everything on this earth that is not
[1:08] redeemed as cannon fodder
[1:09] will be burnt over to create a bright
[1:12] new millennium for the bridegroom and
[1:13] the bride to step out on
[1:15] it's part of god's plan it's part of
[1:17] god's program god foresaw and god knew
[1:20] and this is the way things have to be
[1:22] and we don't want to fret too much about
[1:24] the way things are
[1:26] going because it's the way things need
[1:28] to be
[1:30] you know you can get discouraged when we
[1:33] see news and
[1:34] things changing and and the culture
[1:36] changing and the laws changing and the
[1:39] politics changing you can become
[1:41] discouraged but
[1:42] but don't let that discouragement stay
[1:44] look back to the word and realize
[1:46] these things must be this way i'm
[1:48] encouraged amen
[1:50] i told somebody the other day you know
[1:52] you know what the discussion
[1:54] was of gun control and and you know my i
[1:56] think my boys were asking me because
[1:58] they were a little bit nervous about
[1:59] losing their hunting guns
[2:02] and we love to hunt you know something
[2:03] as a family that we enjoy to do
[2:05] and to do that we enjoy our guns but i
[2:07] was talking to a brother and i said
[2:09] when they when they knock on my door and
[2:11] they change the laws and we're no longer
[2:13] allowed to have a gun
[2:14] and it's forbidden you know what i'm not
[2:16] going to be burying them in my backyard
[2:18] i'm not going to be storing up
[2:18] ammunition i'm not going to start a
[2:20] fight with the government because these
[2:22] things have to go that way
[2:23] i will take my gun in my hand i will
[2:25] forfeit it with a smile on my face
[2:27] because my days on earth are almost done
[2:31] i'm part of a kingdom that can't be
[2:32] shaking if you take this from me you'll
[2:34] never take the millennium from me
[2:36] you'll never take my position in
[2:37] security in christ you'll never
[2:39] take the peace that i have in my heart
[2:41] you can take privileges you can take
[2:43] rights amen you can take anything you
[2:45] want but you're not going to take the
[2:47] kingdom away

[2:50] heart of his bride
