[6:22] take our bibles and go right to the word
[6:25] go to titus this one say how much i
[6:27] appreciate the atmosphere of worship
[6:29] it means a lot amen it means a lot
[6:34] before we read the scripture i want to
[6:36] just give a big thank you
[6:37] to a couple brothers brother steve
[6:40] miller is on vacation
[6:41] for a little while so he's not here to
[6:43] do the normal plowing on the parking lot
[6:45] so yesterday brother dean hatfield and
[6:46] his son xavier came out

[6:50] and cleaned the parking lot so we want
[6:51] to thank them for that
[6:53] amen and this morning

[7:01] we appreciate these guys stepping in
[7:03] while steve is gone
[7:04] and making it nice for us amen god is
[7:07] good i also want to remind you that

[7:17] of confirmation for the deacons
[7:19] and also a vote to confirm brother dean
[7:21] hatfield as the new treasurer of the
[7:23] church
[7:24] so we want to remind you of that for
[7:25] this afternoon
[7:27] and let's look at titus chapter 3
[7:29] together
[7:32] titus chapter 3 i'm going to read verse
[7:34] 3.
[7:37] for we ourselves also were sometimes
[7:40] foolish disobedient
[7:42] deceived serving diverse lust and
[7:44] pleasures
[7:45] living in malice envy hateful and hating
[7:47] one another
[7:49] were you there at one time so do you see
[7:52] yourself in the scripture
[7:53] amen but let's not stop there let's keep
[7:55] reading but after that the kindness and
[7:58] love of god our savior toward man
[8:00] appeared
[8:01] not by works of righteousness which we
[8:02] have done but according to his mercy
[8:05] he saved us by the washing of
[8:07] regeneration and the renewing
[8:09] of the holy ghost that word renewing
[8:12] means to to um oh
[8:16] i got it here i'm going to mess it up if
[8:18] i don't read it verbatim
[8:20] it means a renewal a complete change for
[8:23] the better
[8:24] a complete change for the better so i
[8:27] read that verse 5 again not by works of
[8:29] any righteousness which we have done but
[8:30] according to his mercy
[8:32] he saved us by the washing of
[8:33] regeneration and renewal
[8:36] of the holy ghost which he shed on us
[8:38] abundantly through christ jesus
[8:41] our savior amen let's bow our heads
[8:44] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[8:46] for your goodness
[8:48] lord for truly this is a message of
[8:50] grace and a message of mercy to us lord
[8:53] god you've come at the end time lord to
[8:55] peel away all the misunderstandings and
[8:57] all the wrong teachings
[8:58] and you've come to show us who we are
[9:01] and you've come to show us how much you
[9:02] love us
[9:03] and what your grace has done for us no
[9:06] we just asked today that you would bless
[9:07] us lord in the preaching of the word
[9:09] for this is your way this is your plan
[9:12] may it serve your purpose this morning
[9:13] and may you speak to us yourself
[9:15] may it be you who feeds your sheep this
[9:17] morning we pray
[9:18] in jesus christ's name amen you can all
[9:22] have your seats
[9:25] i mean i want to continue on in the
[9:28] the path we've been going uh last week
[9:30] we were talking about the token is the
[9:32] assurance and i want to say a few things
[9:34] along those lines and then
[9:36] move on a little bit but today i'd like
[9:37] to talk about the end time token i just
[9:39] want to spend some time
[9:40] reviewing that and talking about that
[9:43] it's been such a pleasure
[9:44] these last few services because i never
[9:47] planned on preaching these things i
[9:49] never had
[9:50] a a mind to go through justification
[9:53] sanctification baptism holy ghost that
[9:55] wasn't
[9:55] pre-planned it's just the way it went
[9:58] and when you go to preach those things
[10:00] and sometimes it seems like well that's
[10:02] common we all know those things and
[10:04] they're just they've been understood for
[10:06] years but i tell you i enjoyed it
[10:08] amen i enjoyed it it's always so much
[10:11] deeper the word of god is so much deeper
[10:14] i mean the scripture says if you think
[10:16] you know anything you don't know
[10:17] anything as you ought amen
[10:19] and we don't even understand
[10:20] justification as we ought amen we don't
[10:22] even understand sanctification as we are
[10:24] but thank god as we go on and he
[10:26] continues to reveal himself we see it
[10:27] more clearly and more clearly
[10:29] and we find out it's deeper it's wider
[10:32] it's broader it's higher it's more than
[10:34] we ever thought amen
[10:35] and it settles us so much so
[10:39] while we're in the bible let's turn to
[10:40] ephesians chapter one
[10:42] and read a couple more scriptures here
[10:44] ephesians chapter 1
[10:47] and we found out that these things were
[10:49] given by grace and it's the mercy of god
[10:52] and if it's mercy and by grace then it's
[10:55] something that cannot be earned
[10:58] this is really important for us to
[11:00] realize because
[11:01] uh with a wrong understanding uh we
[11:05] we begin to have the concept of earning
[11:07] or working
[11:08] or or our our somehow uh
[11:12] if i could just say it the way i
[11:13] understand it
[11:15] uh somehow sometimes we get the concept
[11:17] of
[11:18] almost it's almost like levels i'm going
[11:21] uh from this level to this level if i
[11:23] work hard i'll make an achievement and
[11:25] and the reward for that achievement is
[11:27] to go to the next level
[11:29] but you realize there's never been a
[11:31] level opened up that wasn't opened up by
[11:33] grace
[11:34] amen and sometimes you know it's not
[11:37] that we don't
[11:38] strive amen it's not that we don't
[11:40] earnestly seek after the lord it's not
[11:43] like it's not a great desire for us
[11:45] to press into the kingdom there's two
[11:48] parts to this amen there's
[11:49] there's a part where you have a desire
[11:51] for god a part that you press into the
[11:53] kingdom
[11:53] a part that you pray and that you you
[11:56] you know you judge yourself you stay in
[11:58] the word
[11:59] all of those things are a great desire
[12:00] to grow closer to god
[12:02] but when we back it up a little bit you
[12:04] realize that desire that you have
[12:06] came from god and without god even
[12:09] giving you the without the seed
[12:10] in your soul amen you don't even have
[12:12] the capacity to seek after god the
[12:14] desire
[12:15] or the ability even to receive the word
[12:19] so it's it takes away the whole notion
[12:21] of i'm i'm striving
[12:23] and i'm achieving and i'm i'm gaining
[12:25] amen
[12:26] all you're doing is responding to his
[12:28] call
[12:29] all you're doing is he's pulling amen
[12:32] and you
[12:32] think you're pushing but really you're
[12:35] responding responding to a pull
[12:38] so it's a matter of perspective so many
[12:40] times our language is developed by our
[12:42] own perspective
[12:43] amen but the prophet of god come and he
[12:45] lifted us out of our perspective
[12:47] and lifted us up on high and gave us
[12:49] eagle vision and showed
[12:50] you cannot even come unless the father
[12:52] draws you amen you cannot believe unless
[12:54] you have something to believe with
[12:56] you can't even hear the word and
[12:57] understand unless there's a receptor on
[12:59] the inside
[13:00] to pick up that frequency so it was all
[13:03] gone it's all by grace it's all by mercy
[13:05] amen
[13:06] but it doesn't mean that we still don't
[13:08] have a desire it doesn't mean that we
[13:10] don't strive it doesn't mean that
[13:12] that we don't seek his face amen we do
[13:14] all that because he put us
[13:15] in us to do it amen
[13:19] praise god see one of the things that
[13:22] ends up frustrating believers
[13:24] is when we have the concept or the idea
[13:28] of reward amen
[13:32] then we have the concept or idea of if
[13:35] i get this good enough and i do it well
[13:37] enough and if i get to a certain level i
[13:40] get to go to the next level
[13:42] and the problem is uh with that kind of
[13:44] mentality there's always stumblings
[13:46] there's always trippings there's
[13:48] always something that's going on in our
[13:50] lives that that gives us
[13:52] the wrong concept that we've gone back
[13:54] to zero amen but with god you've never
[13:57] gone back to zero friends
[14:00] you know i i i drew out for the youth
[14:03] years ago and
[14:04] i don't know if anybody will remember
[14:05] the drawing but i had a little stick
[14:07] figure
[14:07] and i had him on a on a line you know
[14:10] from
[14:11] from here up to here you know up to
[14:14] to where he wants to be in christ and on
[14:17] that line
[14:18] i drew the line as the foundation of
[14:20] grace
[14:21] and that you can never fall below grace
[14:25] so you get on this journey with god and
[14:26] you increase in knowledge and
[14:28] understanding of the lord you
[14:30] grow in revelation and you're climbing
[14:32] up this climb
[14:33] but if you fall amen there's a line of
[14:35] grace there and mercy
[14:37] you don't fall back to the starting
[14:39] point you just fall on the line
[14:42] and you get up and you dust your knees
[14:44] off and you say god i'm sorry
[14:46] and you keep walking where you are amen
[14:50] but when we have the the concept if i've
[14:53] fallen off this line i've gone to the
[14:55] bottom
[14:56] i got to go back and get on the line
[14:57] there's such a discouragement that comes
[14:59] with this there's such a disheartened
[15:01] feeling
[15:02] amen that people begin to throw in the
[15:04] towel and i'll never and i can't
[15:06] amen and when you start to say things
[15:08] like i'll never and i can't and i've
[15:10] tried so hard
[15:11] it means you've got a wrong concept from
[15:13] the beginning
[15:15] because you think it's you i can't
[15:18] well that was obvious from day one amen
[15:22] i'll never that's true also amen i
[15:25] i'm never going to be good enough that
[15:26] was that was evident before you were
[15:28] born
[15:30] so when we use that terminology what
[15:33] we're where we're saying is i have a
[15:35] complete
[15:35] wrong concept of what god is doing in my
[15:38] life
[15:41] but when we look at it correctly we say
[15:43] he's drawing me
[15:45] there's something that god's doing and
[15:47] it's more than me and i need him i
[15:49] cannot do this on my own
[15:51] i cannot i cannot do one thing without
[15:53] him
[15:55] and then we have the right concept of
[15:57] our walk
[15:58] and so the whole idea of falling and
[16:00] going back to scratch
[16:02] we need to get rid of that idea and say
[16:04] if i fall i fall
[16:06] i repent i ask god to forgive me
[16:09] amen but nothing has changed with me and
[16:11] god nothing has changed with this
[16:13] foreordained plan for my life nothing
[16:15] has changed
[16:16] amen with his predestination nothing has
[16:19] changed
[16:19] with my sonship what has changed is
[16:23] is i allowed something in the flesh amen
[16:25] something and the old carnal nature that
[16:28] old sticky
[16:28] cockleburn nature that tripped me up
[16:30] amen and i need to realize that that was
[16:32] me and i was wrong and i repent and i'm
[16:35] sorry god and i need to come back to
[16:36] your word
[16:37] amen but i got to keep walking amen i
[16:40] don't stop and go all the way back to
[16:42] zero
[16:43] so some of these some of these concepts
[16:45] that are so discouraging
[16:47] is really a lack of revelation and
[16:50] misunderstanding
[16:51] but god and his mercy came and brought
[16:53] us a prophet to peel those things away
[16:57] so let's look at ephesians chapter 1
[17:00] verse 3.
[17:05] blessed be the god and father of our
[17:07] lord jesus christ who hath blessed us
[17:09] with all
[17:10] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[17:13] in christ jesus according as he hath
[17:16] chosen us
[17:16] in him before the foundation of the
[17:18] world that we should be holy
[17:20] and without blame before him in love
[17:24] i love that verse
[17:27] he chose me before
[17:31] he chose me in him before
[17:35] the foundation of the world that i
[17:37] should be holy
[17:38] and without blame before him in love
[17:41] because that's the condition he wants
[17:44] me to be in
[17:48] having predestinated us unto the
[17:49] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[17:52] himself
[17:53] according to the good pleasure of his
[17:55] will to the praise of the glory of his
[17:57] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[17:59] in the beloved
[18:00] he made us accepted in the beloved
[18:03] you didn't climb the ladder fast enough
[18:05] you didn't memorize the bible verses
[18:07] good enough
[18:07] you didn't you understand what i'm
[18:09] saying he made
[18:11] us accept it in the beloved
[18:15] in whom we have redemption through his
[18:17] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[18:19] to the riches
[18:20] of his grace wherein he hath abounded
[18:23] toward us in all wisdom and prudence
[18:25] having made known unto us the mystery of
[18:28] his will according to his good pleasure
[18:30] which he has purposed
[18:31] in himself that in this dispensation
[18:34] you know what so far what did you have
[18:36] to do with this
[18:38] as we're reading so far what did you
[18:40] have to do with it
[18:41] how did you this all this all took place
[18:44] in the mind of god before you were ever
[18:46] breathing breath upon this earth
[18:48] he purposed it was according to his
[18:49] purpose his good pleasure his will
[18:54] amen
[18:57] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[18:58] all wisdom and prudence having made
[19:00] known unto us the mystery was a will
[19:01] according to his good pleasure which he
[19:03] hath purposed in himself
[19:05] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[19:07] of times he might gather together in one
[19:09] all things in christ both which are in
[19:11] heaven and which are on earth
[19:13] even in him in whom also we have
[19:15] obtained an inheritance being
[19:17] predestinated according to the purpose
[19:19] of him
[19:20] who worketh all things after the counsel
[19:22] of his own
[19:23] will i am saved because he wants me to
[19:27] be saved
[19:29] not just because i want to be saved and
[19:31] i want to be saved because he wanted me
[19:33] to be saved
[19:37] verse 12 that we should be to the praise
[19:39] of his glory who first
[19:40] trusted in christ in whom ye also
[19:43] in whom you also trusted after that you
[19:46] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[19:48] your salvation
[19:49] in whom also after that you believed you
[19:51] were sealed
[19:52] with that holy spirit of promise which
[19:55] is the earnest of our inheritance until
[19:57] the redemption
[19:58] of the purchased possession unto the
[20:00] praise of his glory
[20:02] the apostle paul doesn't make it
[20:03] difficult here he shows you that god had
[20:05] a plan for you he chose you and him
[20:07] before the foundation of the world
[20:08] he wanted to choose you that way so that
[20:10] you would be holy and blameless before
[20:11] him in love
[20:13] he wanted to call you because he
[20:14] predestinated you he did all of these
[20:16] things and then
[20:17] verse 13 he just starts to he starts to
[20:20] explain the path that you came in this
[20:22] journey
[20:23] and he says in whom you also trusted
[20:25] after that you heard the word of truth
[20:27] when you heard the word of truth you
[20:28] began to trust him
[20:30] because the word of truth was awakening
[20:32] that portion that he placed of himself
[20:33] down inside of you
[20:36] you heard the word of truth the gospel
[20:38] of your salvation
[20:39] in whom also after that you believed you
[20:41] were sealed with the holy spirit
[20:43] of promise paul didn't make it hard
[20:48] he just told you you heard the truth you
[20:51] believed
[20:52] after you believed you were sealed
[20:55] praise be to god which is the earnest
[20:59] of our inheritance which is the down
[21:01] payment
[21:02] or the earnest money the money that will
[21:04] hold the earnest of our inheritance
[21:06] until the redemption of the purchased
[21:08] possession
[21:08] unto the praise of his glory
[21:12] i love that portion of scripture let's
[21:15] turn together over to luke
[21:21] see it's totally different
[21:24] concept when you think that you're
[21:27] trying
[21:28] to do something or get something from
[21:30] god or get somewhere with god
[21:32] that concept is it's you centered
[21:36] and the effort is yours
[21:39] the the ability is yours it's all you
[21:42] simple i'm trying to get somewhere with
[21:44] god i'm trying
[21:45] to get this i'm trying to do this i'm
[21:46] trying to do that but when we flip it on
[21:49] its head and saying that god had already
[21:50] predetermined and purposed that
[21:52] because he already predetermined in
[21:54] purpose that he put something inside of
[21:56] you that he could work with
[21:57] and now he sent his word so he can begin
[21:59] to draw you closer to himself
[22:01] that is a totally different concept
[22:04] now you realize amen it's not
[22:08] all the power is not in my wheels
[22:11] i'm not the one driving the whole thing
[22:13] i'm being pulled there's a greater power
[22:15] than the power within me
[22:16] amen and that's the power that's drawing
[22:18] me is the greater than the power
[22:20] amen that is in my flesh that is in my
[22:22] carnal makeup there wasn't enough power
[22:24] to get there amen i want to i want to go
[22:27] amen i put her in gear i want to get
[22:29] there but in and of myself i can never
[22:31] climb that hill i can never get there
[22:33] there's got to be a greater power than
[22:35] the power in my carnal man
[22:37] to get there no matter how much i desire
[22:39] to get there
[22:40] and that greater power is him pulling me
[22:43] amen and it's a sure
[22:44] it's an assurance that i will reach the
[22:46] destination because i'm hooked to him
[22:48] and he's got the winch pulling me up the
[22:52] hill
[22:54] praise be to god luke 11
[22:58] and verse 9. let's turn to luke and
[23:01] we'll look at 11.
[23:10] and verse 9 and i say unto you
[23:14] ask and it shall be given you seek and
[23:17] seek and ye shall find knock and it
[23:20] shall be open unto you
[23:21] for everyone that asketh receiveth and
[23:24] he that seeketh findeth
[23:25] and to him that knocketh it shall be
[23:27] opened
[23:29] if a son shall ask bread of any of you
[23:30] that is a father
[23:32] will he give him a stone or if he ask a
[23:34] fish
[23:35] will he for a fish give him a serpent or
[23:37] if he shall ask an egg
[23:39] will he offer a scorpion if you then
[23:42] being evil know how to give good gifts
[23:44] unto your children
[23:45] how much more shall your heavenly father
[23:47] give the holy spirit to them that
[23:49] ask him
[23:54] praise god
[23:57] when we make this complicated and we get
[24:00] ourselves injected
[24:01] and make it somehow we make it in a
[24:04] we make it to where uh we're trying so
[24:08] hard but god's not helping me
[24:12] like i've tried i've done everything i'm
[24:14] trying so hard but god won't help me
[24:17] we're denying this very scripture
[24:21] because what we're saying is without
[24:23] saying it what we're saying is
[24:25] god is an evil father
[24:29] because i'm asking for the holy ghost
[24:30] he's giving me nothing
[24:33] i i've done everything that he told me
[24:35] to do and i'm asking for the holy spirit
[24:36] but he's refusing to give me
[24:38] we're taking this scripture and we're
[24:40] saying according to this scripture
[24:41] that we have an evil father
[24:46] but if you have a natural father who
[24:49] would not
[24:49] give you a stone or a scorpion but would
[24:52] give you bread if you ask
[24:53] then your heavenly father will give you
[24:56] the holy spirit
[24:58] if you ask you just
[25:01] first have to believe and know that he's
[25:03] your heavenly father
[25:05] and if god has given you a revelation
[25:07] that he's your heavenly father
[25:08] amen and that you you love him and you
[25:10] obey him as a father
[25:12] you can ask and you can expect to
[25:14] receive amen
[25:16] as long as you're as long as you're in
[25:18] your mind you're not
[25:19] dictating how you'll receive it
[25:22] why the way it must come or how it must
[25:25] look or
[25:26] what sensation must come with it as long
[25:28] as you're not dictating to god how we
[25:30] must give it
[25:31] if you're willing to just ask and
[25:33] receive in whatever way he gives it
[25:35] he is a good father and he will give the
[25:38] holy ghost to them who ask
[25:40] to his children he's a good father to
[25:43] his children
[25:44] if you're his child and know that he's
[25:46] you're his child and by faith you can
[25:48] say i'm a son or a daughter of god
[25:50] then you can just simply ask the father
[25:52] to give you the holy ghost and if you
[25:54] know that there's nothing in your life
[25:55] that you're refusing him on
[25:57] you can expect to receive the holy ghost
[26:00] and don't make him an evil father don't
[26:04] say
[26:04] i prayed and prayed but he wouldn't i
[26:06] prayed and prayed but he won't
[26:08] don't you dare do that to him because
[26:09] he's promised to give you the gift of
[26:12] the holy ghost if you obey him
[26:15] i wonder if sometimes the problem is not
[26:17] in our receiving
[26:20] because it didn't come the way we
[26:21] thought it should or we didn't come in
[26:23] the dynamics that it came for somebody
[26:24] else
[26:25] and i didn't i didn't have it according
[26:27] to my own
[26:28] mental conception of what i was going to
[26:30] receive and so god has been trying to
[26:32] give us the gift that he's promised but
[26:34] we won't receive the gift because it's
[26:35] not coming the way we thought or was
[26:38] taught
[26:38] or however that it should come
[26:42] but i would say god i know by a
[26:44] revelation you're my heavenly father
[26:48] and i ask you to fill me with your holy
[26:50] spirit
[26:51] and i receive it in jesus name do
[26:53] however you want in my life
[26:56] just give me your spirit and then walk
[27:00] by faith
[27:01] and watch him change your life
[27:04] and the message the token brotherhood
[27:08] says in the holy ghost is our
[27:09] identification
[27:11] it's what identifies us as christians
[27:13] not our membership in churches
[27:15] not our understanding of the bible not
[27:18] how much you know about the bible it's
[27:20] how much you know about the author
[27:21] see how much the author is living in you
[27:24] it's yourself
[27:25] gone you're no more you reckon yourself
[27:28] dead and the token is what lives in you
[27:30] and it's not your life
[27:31] it's him see that's what we're asking
[27:34] for
[27:35] uh i i think also uh you know i hope
[27:38] this is okay because i'm just sharing
[27:39] from my heart
[27:40] when i started preaching on subjects
[27:42] like this i was telling my brother
[27:43] it's it's treacherous to me because
[27:45] there's so many angles on these things
[27:47] and you can take an angle and drive it
[27:48] too far
[27:49] so you've got somebody way out left
[27:51] field they're not even there anymore
[27:53] but i just want to i just want to just
[27:55] share from my heart
[27:56] amen when when we're seeking the holy
[28:01] ghost i think sometimes
[28:02] the wrong conception is that i'm seeking
[28:06] i just want to stamp you know i just
[28:08] want a stamp of approval
[28:10] and partially that's what it is it's the
[28:12] earnest statement it's the
[28:14] and the earnest of our inheritance i
[28:15] just want that stamp of approval
[28:17] amen brother branham comes and explains
[28:19] it so much more than just the the
[28:21] earnest just
[28:22] the stamp of approval he said it's
[28:23] actually a life it's not your life it's
[28:25] his
[28:26] life amen and that life will it's a seal
[28:29] that comes upon you and seals you to
[28:30] your destination
[28:31] absolutely but i think sometimes all we
[28:34] want is the seal
[28:35] or the guarantee or the stamp and it's
[28:37] not really the life that we're seeking
[28:39] after
[28:40] because what it really is is his life in
[28:42] you amen and you
[28:44] die to yourself and he comes alive in
[28:46] you and now it's not you anymore it's
[28:48] him
[28:48] in you amen and it's not a one-time
[28:51] thing it's in
[28:52] every moment of every day from then on
[28:55] i think sometimes what we're seeking was
[28:57] the stamp the approval the i've got it
[28:59] the ticket
[29:00] the seal amen because that was self-gain
[29:03] amen i've got the seal
[29:05] i've got the token i've got the holy
[29:07] ghost i'm secure i'm fine and we were
[29:10] looking for the baptism holy ghost to
[29:12] relieve our fears
[29:14] of not making a rapture or not being
[29:16] right or not being a christian
[29:18] and we weren't really seeking the right
[29:20] thing
[29:22] and so god because we weren't seeking
[29:24] the right thing
[29:25] god never let us have you know the that
[29:28] experience or sensation or the
[29:31] that thing that we were looking for he
[29:32] never let us have it because we were
[29:34] looking for the wrong thing
[29:35] we weren't looking for him we were
[29:37] looking for our security
[29:39] not his life we were looking for our
[29:43] benefit amen not his
[29:48] i hope you understand what i'm saying i
[29:50] hope it's coming across clear
[29:52] i'm not denouncing anything amen amen
[29:54] there's many
[29:55] many other ways that you can preach on
[29:57] this subject and they're still
[29:58] right amen i'm just sharing what my
[30:00] burden is to where god has me
[30:02] is that so what are we seeking after
[30:05] what do we want as children of god amen
[30:07] do we want uh do we want to seal to make
[30:10] us feel confident and secure
[30:12] and i'm fine and i can sit back and now
[30:14] as a lazy boy
[30:15] uh lounging around kind of christianity
[30:18] because i arrived
[30:19] i had a certain emotional experience
[30:21] that i'm labeling now as the holy ghost
[30:23] and everything's fine and i'm okay
[30:26] if that's all you want amen then you
[30:28] it's
[30:29] if that's all you want you don't want
[30:31] him yet
[30:35] but when you want him you're saying you
[30:38] know what it's
[30:38] more to me than just a stamp of approval
[30:40] it's more than a seal
[30:42] i want to lose my life and i want him
[30:44] amen
[30:45] i want him i want to be united with him
[30:47] i want to be married to him
[30:48] i want him to burn out everything in me
[30:50] that i hate all the thing that's rotten
[30:52] and crooked
[30:53] and not right i want it to go amen i
[30:56] don't want to just be able to say well i
[30:57] got the holy ghost i'm fine i'm going to
[30:59] heaven
[30:59] i want to say lord i'm not fine and i'll
[31:01] never be fine
[31:02] until you come in and burn out the old
[31:05] life and establish yourself in my heart
[31:08] i don't just wanna i i don't just wanna
[31:11] a security
[31:12] i want you and you're my only security
[31:15] and you're my only security when i walk
[31:16] with you every moment of every day
[31:19] every hour in my private life public
[31:21] life church life that's the only
[31:22] security i have is you
[31:24] in me not a certain
[31:27] altar experience or a certain
[31:29] manifestation or a certain thing
[31:31] amen all of those things go with it but
[31:33] they're not it
[31:36] remember bam said i don't believe a dry
[31:38] eyed confession
[31:40] and that's true but i don't always
[31:43] believe a wet-eyed repentance
[31:48] sometimes it's just emotional
[31:51] so they're both true does emotion go
[31:55] with it brother said emotion goes with
[31:56] it
[31:58] and there better be some emotion with a
[32:00] love relationship with christ
[32:02] there better be some life there better
[32:04] be some feeling there better be some
[32:05] sensations there better be something
[32:07] amen but it's not the sensation or any
[32:09] particular sensation and it's not the
[32:11] emotion
[32:12] those things go with it
[32:15] but what is it it's him it's his life
[32:18] amen it's my union with him that's what
[32:21] i want amen
[32:24] and i want it emotional i want it with
[32:26] feeling i want it
[32:29] but even if there's not feeling i still
[32:30] want him
[32:32] because the thing i want most is him
[32:36] so these things are just so uh
[32:40] such a burden for me that we see
[32:44] when you talk to people when you hear
[32:46] what individuals are seeking after and
[32:48] what they want
[32:49] it's like it's a misunderstanding
[32:54] well i want to know this and i want to
[32:55] know that i want to have this and
[32:57] i want to be sure of this and really
[33:00] the simplest thing to do is just fall in
[33:02] love with the lord
[33:04] give him your whole life surrender
[33:05] everything to him seek him with all of
[33:08] your heart
[33:08] when you when you seek him you shall
[33:10] find him knock and he shall open amen
[33:12] just don't stop seeking don't stop
[33:14] knocking don't stop surrendering amen
[33:16] and god amen he will take that heart
[33:19] amen he will fill it with his own life
[33:21] he will renovate he will renew he will
[33:24] recreate for the good amen completely
[33:26] change
[33:27] you your soul amen and he will live
[33:30] there
[33:31] and live his life through you that's
[33:33] what we're seeking after
[33:35] it's a new birth not a pass
[33:40] a new birth
[33:43] the new birth brings a pass
[33:46] but it's not just the past i want it's
[33:48] the new birth i want
[33:52] the the change brings earnest
[33:56] of an inheritance but it's not just the
[33:58] earnest i want it's the change i want
[34:01] you understand what i'm saying i hope
[34:04] this is hitting home
[34:05] i want to be changed
[34:08] and being changed will give me the
[34:10] earnest the down payment of my full
[34:12] inheritance but it's not just the
[34:14] earnest i want i want to be
[34:16] changed i don't want to be the same way
[34:18] i am i don't want my own life i don't
[34:20] want my own way i don't want my lust i
[34:23] don't want my desire
[34:24] i want to die to everything and i want
[34:26] him to live
[34:27] it's my greatest desire it's my great
[34:29] passion in life it's what i'm seeking
[34:31] after
[34:32] and if you seek him that way he'll be
[34:34] found amen
[34:35] you will find him when you seek him with
[34:37] all of your heart
[34:38] [Music]
[34:40] so many times i think we've been taught
[34:42] to look for something
[34:44] but not him and we're chasing after
[34:47] something but we should be chasing him
[34:49] and when we chase after him he'll bring
[34:51] everything not just to something but
[34:54] it's all there amen
[34:56] everything is there
[35:00] like brother branham said when you buy
[35:01] the shoe you get the tongue
[35:03] the tongue is not the shoe it just goes
[35:04] with it the gifts of the spirit go with
[35:07] it amen
[35:08] you can never have a true church without
[35:10] the gifts of the spirit in operation
[35:12] hey brother bam said they follow the
[35:13] true church
[35:15] always so you can't go to one side or
[35:19] the other
[35:20] amen you've got to go right down the
[35:21] middle you've got to have the gifts
[35:23] you've got to have a a relationship with
[35:26] feeling you've got to
[35:28] you've got to be connected to your lord
[35:30] amen you've got to feel your love for
[35:31] him
[35:34] but all of those things are what goes
[35:35] with it
[35:40] i keep reading here in the token the
[35:42] last thing i said is you reckon yourself
[35:44] dead and the token is what lives in you
[35:46] and it's not your life it's him
[35:50] paul said this life that i now live he
[35:52] lived a different life from what he once
[35:53] did
[35:54] it's not me but christ liveth in me
[35:58] there is the identified token that god
[36:00] required
[36:01] identified identification with our
[36:03] sacrifice the life of our savior in us
[36:05] the holy spirit oh what a positive
[36:09] token it's a positive token it's a short
[36:12] token
[36:13] it's his life and me there cannot be any
[36:16] more token
[36:17] oh my if you only could catch the
[36:19] thought of it
[36:20] if i had the power this morning with
[36:22] words to express and place in your soul
[36:24] that's on the not in your ears but your
[36:26] soul you could see the guarantee of it
[36:29] it takes it makes you so relaxed
[36:33] this is what this is what i want to say
[36:36] when brother branham preached the
[36:37] baptism holy ghost and the token
[36:39] amen he says when you have the token
[36:41] when you realize that something changed
[36:43] you you've been changed amen
[36:44] you're not the old person you were
[36:45] you're a new creation in christ jesus
[36:48] you can have the capacity to change you
[36:49] but something god himself came down
[36:52] amen and united with you and changed you
[36:54] and now it's not the life that you once
[36:56] lived it's a different life you're
[36:57] living now
[36:58] it's the life of christ and you love the
[37:00] word and you love him
[37:01] and you want the word and you don't want
[37:03] the world you don't want any evil
[37:05] something in you is totally shift
[37:07] brother branham says that's the token
[37:08] that he's looking for
[37:09] your life is gone and his life is living
[37:12] in you
[37:13] he said you see the guarantee of it it
[37:16] makes you
[37:16] so relaxed
[37:23] ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy
[37:26] spirit of god whereby you are sealed
[37:28] unto the day of your redemption it's a
[37:30] seal
[37:32] and that seal is a guarantee it's an
[37:34] earnest
[37:37] and it makes you so relaxed
[37:41] see when
[37:45] when you see
[37:48] the teaching on the baptism the holy
[37:50] ghost that makes everybody nervous and
[37:52] nobody relaxed
[37:54] it makes me nervous because there's got
[37:57] to be something that comes in a believer
[37:59] that they know they've met god
[38:01] they know something deep on the inside
[38:03] has shifted amen
[38:04] it wasn't a it wasn't i decided to quit
[38:07] lying and i decided to be nicer because
[38:09] i didn't like the consequences i was
[38:10] paying for my evil
[38:11] but something deeper than that it wasn't
[38:14] a reformation it was a transformation
[38:16] something on the inside shifted all my
[38:19] loves and almonds
[38:20] everything shifted and now what i want
[38:22] more than anything is i want god to be
[38:23] pleased with me
[38:27] amen and that should bring
[38:30] a rest because the holy ghost is rest
[38:35] when we entered into the holy ghost
[38:37] we've ceased from our own works we've
[38:38] entered in
[38:39] to rest amen amen we've entered into not
[38:42] me
[38:43] not my will not me it's him in me
[38:47] it's not the life i once lived but it's
[38:48] the life that he now lives in me
[38:51] and the token again brother says now how
[38:53] many knows that he never changes his
[38:55] ways
[38:56] he never does now look through the bible
[38:59] and see if he ever changed it no sir
[39:01] how did he prepare the people first he
[39:03] sent a prophet with a sign which was
[39:04] moses is that right
[39:06] and the sign had a message a message to
[39:08] get ready they were going out to the
[39:10] land that
[39:10] was promised then he had he had
[39:12] identification of this prophet
[39:15] that is a light was over top of him a
[39:18] pillar of fire followed his prophet
[39:19] do you think brother branham's only
[39:21] talking about exodus
[39:23] he's trying to point you to his day amen
[39:25] to what was going on present tense
[39:27] and then he also had a light
[39:28] identification a light over the top of
[39:31] him a pillar of fire followed this
[39:32] prophet
[39:33] we know that went through the wilderness
[39:35] with moses we realized that
[39:36] and then he gave them a token for the
[39:38] assurance that they wouldn't have to be
[39:40] scared
[39:42] all upset and nervous so moses
[39:45] gave them a token so that they wouldn't
[39:48] have to be
[39:49] upset all upset and nervous
[39:52] that they would have assurance amen so
[39:54] they wouldn't be scared all upset and
[39:55] nervous
[39:56] amen so so praise god i say god has a
[40:00] token for his people today
[40:02] an assurance so that we wouldn't be
[40:03] scared all upset and nervous
[40:06] how many wants that token amen that's
[40:09] what we want that's the life that we
[40:10] want
[40:13] when i see the token i'll pass over you
[40:16] watch how he did now he prepared first
[40:18] to sign a messenger
[40:20] identified message identification of the
[40:22] message and a token for the assurance
[40:24] that the way was paid
[40:26] they are headed for the promised land
[40:28] the same thing he has done today
[40:30] what did he do he sent us the holy ghost
[40:32] the holy ghost is the messenger
[40:34] and the scriptural identification of
[40:36] himself identifies him among us
[40:38] the same yesterday today and forever and
[40:40] the token
[40:41] is the assurance what are you scared
[40:43] about our fair is already paid and we
[40:46] are identified with our sacrifice
[40:48] he can't turn you down he promised that
[40:51] we
[40:51] are identified how are we identified
[40:54] because he changed us amen because he
[40:57] changed us
[41:00] amen i'm going to read another quote
[41:03] here from the token he said the blood is
[41:06] not the token now
[41:08] the life is the token so i want to just
[41:11] take a minute and brother branham
[41:13] when he's preaching the token he's not
[41:15] re-preaching the baptism of the holy
[41:17] ghost
[41:19] and i hope by the time we're done with
[41:21] this you'll understand what i'm saying
[41:22] it's not like i'm trying to separate the
[41:24] two two but when brother branham's
[41:26] preaching the token
[41:27] amen he said this toke this message
[41:30] couldn't be preached until now
[41:32] but they were preaching the baptism of
[41:33] the holy ghost before but he said this
[41:35] message this token
[41:36] it couldn't he said it couldn't be
[41:38] preached to now he said it couldn't come
[41:40] in existence until the evening time
[41:43] so brother branham is preaching in the
[41:45] token amen something that could only
[41:48] uh something that can only exist in the
[41:50] bright age
[41:53] [Music]
[41:54] and that token amen is the evidence the
[41:58] token
[41:58] is the security the token is
[42:02] the assurance the token is the evidence
[42:05] that the blood has been
[42:06] paid and been applied to you and that
[42:08] that you've been redeemed amen the token
[42:10] is the evidence of that
[42:12] and so he goes back and we'll just
[42:13] review this he goes back into the exodus
[42:15] journey and he shows
[42:17] how god sent a prophet and he gave a
[42:18] sign of a pillar of fire
[42:20] and he showed the signs of a prophet
[42:22] amen and then and then the prophet was
[42:23] going to give them a token
[42:25] and that token was going to be a
[42:26] covering of blood amen there's going to
[42:27] be a
[42:28] innocent one that's going to be
[42:29] sacrificed it's going to pay the price
[42:31] of substitution
[42:32] amen but you had to take the blood of
[42:34] the lamb that was slain
[42:36] and the blood had to be applied on the
[42:38] outside of your door
[42:39] so that when the death angel passed if
[42:40] he saw the blood he would pass over you
[42:44] and brother branham is basing the token
[42:45] message on this
[42:47] amen out of exodus in the exodus journey
[42:49] then he's showing that the token
[42:51] amen couldn't just be the fact that you
[42:53] believe in the blood
[42:56] the token wasn't believing in the lamb
[43:00] you could believe in the lamb you can
[43:02] believe in jesus christ your savior you
[43:04] can believe in the blood as the price
[43:06] for redemption you can believe that but
[43:08] he says you could believe
[43:09] moses amen you could slay a lamb you
[43:11] could put the blood in the bucket and
[43:13] you can say that's the right blood and
[43:14] that's the right lamb and
[43:16] this is what moses said but if the blood
[43:18] is not applied to the outside of the
[43:20] house
[43:20] amen the death angel won't pass amen the
[43:23] covenant was null and void
[43:26] and brother is bringing us to this day
[43:28] he said we've come to a day
[43:29] amen where it's not just believing the
[43:32] lamb that was slain not just believing
[43:33] in the blood
[43:34] but the blood applied and this is the
[43:38] day
[43:38] amen for the token to be not the blood
[43:41] not the chemistry of the blood not the
[43:43] chemicals that made up the blood
[43:45] not the red substance that was on the
[43:47] cross
[43:48] but the life that was in that substance
[43:50] now is the token and when that life
[43:52] comes into you
[43:54] and changes your life that's the token
[43:56] that what the blood that was shed at
[43:58] calvary has been applied to you
[43:59] and you're redeemed and we've come to
[44:03] the age
[44:04] amen of the token the token time the
[44:07] token age
[44:08] in the bright age
[44:11] so when brother branham is preaching the
[44:13] token
[44:14] we have to understand he's not going
[44:17] back and repreaching what was preached
[44:19] in the pentecostal revival
[44:22] he's taking what was preached then and
[44:23] he's bringing it all up
[44:25] and he's saying now all of this comes to
[44:28] a token
[44:29] amen and the token is the life that was
[44:31] in the blood
[44:32] the life of the sacrifice he said back
[44:35] then it was a chemistry of the blood
[44:36] they actually had to see the red paint
[44:38] over the door
[44:39] because the life that was in that lamb
[44:41] could not come back on the worshipers so
[44:43] they had to have an
[44:44] evidence amen that a lamb would died for
[44:46] them
[44:47] amen but now you have to have evidence
[44:50] that a lamb has died for you
[44:52] in this day you have to have evidence
[44:54] that a lamb has died for you
[44:55] and the lamb is not the chemical of the
[44:58] red amen of the blood
[44:59] but the evidence and now is the life
[45:01] that was in that lamb
[45:03] because now it was a man who died not an
[45:05] animal amen and that life can now come
[45:08] back upon the worshipper
[45:09] and it's his life in you is the token
[45:12] [Music]
[45:16] now i go to a certain church and i
[45:18] believe a certain thing and i and i
[45:19] repeat a certain thing and
[45:21] it's his life in you not i had a certain
[45:25] uh certain kind of experience or a
[45:26] certain type of sensation it's his life
[45:28] and you as the token
[45:30] that's the token so i repeat this the
[45:33] blood is not the token now the life is
[45:36] the token
[45:37] the life could not be there because it
[45:39] was an animal the chemistry was the
[45:41] token
[45:42] you'd have to have literal blood applied
[45:43] on the door but now it's the holy spirit
[45:45] we're coming to it just in a moment to
[45:47] prove that see
[45:48] it's the life that is the token your
[45:51] life has gone and you're dead
[45:54] and your life is dead and you are hidden
[45:56] god through christ and sealed in there
[45:58] by the holy spirit
[45:59] the mind that was in christ is in you in
[46:01] christ and the bible
[46:02] and the word is the same
[46:06] in the beginning was the word and the
[46:07] word was with god and the word was god
[46:09] then you
[46:09] and the word and god and christ are the
[46:13] same and if you abide in me and my word
[46:17] in you
[46:17] ask what you will it'll be done
[46:20] praise god so many things i want to say
[46:28] we've come to a day now listen brother
[46:30] venom i'll read the quote just in a
[46:32] minute but brother branham is telling us
[46:35] the token couldn't be applied till the
[46:36] evening time it couldn't be applied till
[46:38] now
[46:40] something has changed to where now the
[46:43] what was not available before is
[46:46] available now
[46:48] the literal life of jesus christ not a
[46:51] portion not a dip
[46:52] but the whole thing's come back and you
[46:54] say how does the whole thing come back
[46:56] amen because god brought a prophet on
[46:58] the scene to restore
[47:00] back the word amen and the word is
[47:03] spirit
[47:03] and life so
[47:06] sometimes it's it's what we're looking
[47:09] for and where we're looking for it that
[47:10] is sometimes the problem
[47:13] because brother branham came in a
[47:15] ministry brother branham's ministry
[47:18] was evidence of the token
[47:21] because what is the token it's the life
[47:23] of jesus christ
[47:25] and brother branham's ministry was
[47:27] evidence that the token is here
[47:30] and how many times did brother venom go
[47:32] to the plains of memory and show abraham
[47:34] and sarah in the tent
[47:35] and an elohim coming in flesh of a man
[47:39] eating eating the drinking the milk and
[47:42] eating the flesh of a calf you know and
[47:44] he shows that was elohim and stepped
[47:46] into a body of flesh
[47:47] and sarah was in the tent behind him and
[47:49] he could tell
[47:50] what sarah was thinking in her heart in
[47:52] the tent behind him amen and he be
[47:54] called it out
[47:55] how many times did brother brenham go
[47:57] through that story and then demonstrate
[47:59] the same thing by turning us back to the
[48:01] crowd and calling out people the
[48:02] thoughts of their hearts
[48:04] and what he was showing us is he was not
[48:06] just showing us
[48:07] that i have a gift that's not what he
[48:09] was showing he's not saying i have a
[48:10] gift
[48:11] he's saying elohim is here christ is
[48:14] here
[48:14] god is here it's showing that we've come
[48:16] to the place where god has stepped down
[48:18] in flesh
[48:19] to show himself to you to fulfill the
[48:21] promise to abraham's seed amen
[48:23] because why did elohim take on flesh he
[48:26] didn't come down and take on flesh
[48:27] to do a sign before abraham to say hey
[48:29] guess what abraham i'm elohim and i've
[48:31] got a gift
[48:32] he came down and did that so that he can
[48:34] confirm the promise to abraham
[48:37] the point of the visitation was not
[48:39] elohim in flesh
[48:40] the point of the visitation was
[48:42] confirming the promise to abraham
[48:45] and so brother branham would come and
[48:47] show the sign of the messiah
[48:48] so the elohim is here in flesh and it
[48:50] wasn't so that you could say
[48:52] elohim is here in flesh is so that you
[48:54] would know that now is the time for the
[48:56] confirmation of the promise to abraham
[48:58] and to abraham seed
[49:04] so it all depends on what you're looking
[49:05] at what you see in all these events
[49:09] brother man comes down and he says he
[49:12] starts showing
[49:12] us the sign of the messiah showing that
[49:14] the messiah is here
[49:21] the messiah how many believe that
[49:23] brother ben proved that the messiah was
[49:25] present
[49:26] that it was the return of jesus christ
[49:29] he was working through that ministry
[49:31] through it was a prophet a son of man
[49:33] revealing the son of man
[49:35] we believe that but then you have to ask
[49:38] yourselves
[49:39] well if i want to unite with that christ
[49:43] can i run like mary magdalene and grab
[49:45] him at his feet can i
[49:46] can i where where can i dump the
[49:50] the the fragrant oil that i've been
[49:52] saving for him where can i wash his feet
[49:55] how if christ is here how can i do him a
[49:58] service how can i kiss his feet
[50:00] how can i bow before him and worship if
[50:02] christ is here
[50:03] how can i embrace him how can i unite
[50:05] with him how can i find him
[50:08] and brother benham showed that when
[50:10] christ came it was the return
[50:12] of the word amen because he is the word
[50:14] and the word is god and christ is the
[50:16] manifestation of the word and when the
[50:18] word came back to the church
[50:20] it was christ coming back to the church
[50:23] and he went into a man
[50:24] to show the sign of the messiah so that
[50:26] he could confirm the promise for the day
[50:29] amen to turn the hearts of the children
[50:30] back to the fathers amen and restore the
[50:33] word that had been lost
[50:34] and now what do i embrace to embrace
[50:36] christ what do i unite with what do i
[50:38] wash with my tears what feet do i kiss
[50:41] it's the word amen i embrace the word
[50:44] amen i unite with the word
[50:46] amen i worship amen according to the
[50:48] word amen i received the word
[50:53] so christ has come where is he where do
[50:55] i find him
[50:58] he's the word he's the word that's amen
[51:01] he's the word that's presented to you
[51:03] amen every time you come to church he's
[51:05] the word that is on your device when you
[51:07] listen to the message when you read your
[51:08] book
[51:09] that's him amen he has come back amen
[51:12] he's come back as the word
[51:13] and i want to unite with christ and i
[51:14] want to embrace christ then you must
[51:16] embrace him as the word for this day
[51:19] amen
[51:20] the word of the age it brings the life
[51:23] it brings the token life
[51:26] and you know we we've been taught
[51:28] sometimes
[51:30] to to seek sensations
[51:35] but like i said before really we need to
[51:37] seek him
[51:41] how do i seek him he's the word that's
[51:45] been restored in this day
[51:48] what do i run to
[51:53] i'm gonna i'm gonna make a statement
[51:55] just from my heart but i don't mean
[51:56] anything ill about it you guys know me
[51:58] well enough
[52:00] to understand what i'm saying and take
[52:01] it into context
[52:04] some people have sought christ at an
[52:06] altar
[52:09] and not found him because he's not an
[52:12] altar
[52:14] he's the word there's nothing wrong with
[52:18] the altar as long as you come to the
[52:20] altar
[52:20] and repent and unite with the word
[52:24] i hope you understand what i'm saying i
[52:26] don't mean
[52:27] anything i don't mean anything
[52:28] derogatory but some people come and they
[52:31] they were seeking him in a prayer line
[52:34] but he's not a prayer line
[52:37] he's the word made manifest in this day
[52:40] he's the word for this age
[52:41] now the prayer line many people have got
[52:43] a new birth and a prayer line a new
[52:45] birth at an altar
[52:46] because they came to unite with the word
[52:48] in that prayer line
[52:49] they came to surrender their life they
[52:51] came to give up themselves and unite
[52:53] with christ
[52:54] they were coming to the word they were
[52:56] recognizing it didn't it wasn't the
[52:57] prayer line that gave me the holy ghost
[52:59] and it wasn't the altar that gave me the
[53:00] holy ghost it was uniting with christ
[53:04] see it's the approach it's the attitude
[53:06] it's what we're looking for
[53:07] if if you go to the altar i mean go to
[53:10] the altar to unite with him amen to
[53:11] receive the word for your day
[53:12] to repent for your rejection to lay down
[53:14] your life to repent for your selfishness
[53:16] and say god i surrender to you
[53:18] i surrender to all that word i want all
[53:22] of it i want to believe it all i want to
[53:23] live it all
[53:24] i want to act on all of it so there's
[53:27] nothing wrong
[53:28] i hope you don't get me wrong there's
[53:29] nothing wrong with an altar call there's
[53:30] nothing wrong with the prayer line
[53:32] there's nothing wrong with those things
[53:34] what's wrong is the person's attitude
[53:36] when they approach it
[53:38] if we come with the wrong attitude
[53:39] that's why we come down and pray and
[53:41] leave with nothing
[53:43] because we were looking for something
[53:46] we were looking for something that
[53:47] wasn't at the altar
[53:52] it's not at the altar the altar is just
[53:55] where you die
[53:59] the altar can be in your heart in your
[54:00] home in your car it can be right here at
[54:02] the front of the pulpit
[54:04] the altar is where you die
[54:08] but it's not that he's standing at an
[54:10] altar he's standing in a prayer line
[54:12] he's here the revealed word he's all
[54:14] around you
[54:16] he's the message of the hour this
[54:18] message is christ
[54:23] and we come and we die to ourselves to
[54:25] embrace him
[54:27] and he is revealed in the message of the
[54:29] hour
[54:31] it's important that we understand what
[54:33] it is we want
[54:35] and what it is we're looking for because
[54:37] if we look for the wrong thing we'll
[54:38] never find the right thing
[54:40] looking the wrong place
[54:46] i want him i want him so i want
[54:49] i want christ so i've got to find him
[54:51] and
[54:53] but he's in the word he is the word
[54:57] we make it so complicated that we want
[54:59] to find him in a special
[55:01] series of meetings or a special ministry
[55:03] or a special church or a special place
[55:05] or a special location
[55:07] when we have the word we all have the
[55:09] word amen if you really love him
[55:12] amen you really want to unite with him
[55:13] then you die just that word get into the
[55:15] word
[55:16] because when you get into the word
[55:17] you're getting into christ when you
[55:18] embrace the word you're embracing christ
[55:20] when you obey the word you're obeying
[55:22] christ
[55:27] it's so simple we just run right over
[55:29] top of it
[55:31] and wonder why we've never got the thing
[55:33] that we're seeking after
[55:34] and because we're seeking after the
[55:35] wrong thing
[55:38] we have to seek after him
[55:44] brother says in the token again he says
[55:46] and
[55:47] we can display the token of the holy
[55:49] spirit shows that we have been accepted
[55:51] in christ and that
[55:52] is our token that all that we have need
[55:54] is already purchased by him
[55:56] we are identified with our token the
[55:58] token must be ready
[56:00] the blood and covenant blood is not
[56:03] recognized without the token
[56:04] the word assures us of the promise the
[56:06] token is the sign that the purchase has
[56:08] been made
[56:09] for us full obedience to the full word
[56:12] of god entitled us to the token
[56:16] this is a good statement but i want to
[56:17] explain the statement full obedience to
[56:19] the full word of god entitles us to the
[56:21] token
[56:22] no other way is there that you would
[56:23] ever be entitled to the token
[56:25] until you fully obey the word not what
[56:28] somebody has put in it
[56:29] and added to it but what god said about
[56:31] it
[56:32] this is what brother branham is getting
[56:34] to and he's taking this out of acts
[56:36] chapter 5 verse 32 it says and we are
[56:38] witnesses of these things
[56:39] and so also is the holy ghost whom god
[56:42] hath given to them that obey him
[56:44] that's what brother branham is referring
[56:45] to but when brother graham says obey
[56:47] if we take an old understanding we can
[56:50] go back and say oh no i've got to get
[56:52] everything right and i got to fully obey
[56:54] all the word and when i got my life
[56:55] right and everything's right then don't
[56:57] fill me with the holy ghost
[56:58] that's not what brother branham's saying
[57:00] now what he's really saying
[57:01] is when you fully surrender to the
[57:03] message of the hour
[57:04] if i can just if i can just nail it down
[57:06] and simple without showing a dozen
[57:08] quotes to prove that to you
[57:09] what he's showing is when you finally
[57:11] surrender all your false understanding
[57:13] all your ideas
[57:14] amen all your wants and all your desires
[57:16] and you finally surrender to the message
[57:18] that was preached through the prophet of
[57:20] the day
[57:20] and say that's the truth and everything
[57:22] else is a lie and everything in me i
[57:24] want to obey that word
[57:25] that is what he's talking about
[57:28] not a creed not a doctrine of man not
[57:30] anything else but we've come back
[57:32] to christ the word amen in full measure
[57:34] with the full revelation by divine
[57:36] vindication
[57:37] when we come back to that and not just
[57:39] say it's true amen brother ben says
[57:41] you can say the message is true that's
[57:42] no more than being able to read that's
[57:44] not it yet
[57:44] you can say well that message is true
[57:46] and that man was a prophet but it's when
[57:48] you say
[57:48] i want to be fully aligned with that
[57:51] word amen
[57:52] it's so true everything else is wrong my
[57:54] opinion is wrong
[57:55] my desires are wrong everything's wrong
[57:57] and i want nothing but that word
[57:59] alive in me that's full obedience to the
[58:02] full word of god
[58:04] it's not about getting every conduct
[58:06] right amen it's an attitude it's an
[58:08] approach amen it's an understanding of
[58:09] what's been given us in this day
[58:11] that word is christ amen how can i want
[58:14] christ to dwell in me
[58:15] when i will not even surrender to christ
[58:18] the message of the hour that was
[58:19] preached through a prophet
[58:20] when he says women don't cut your hair
[58:22] and i cut my hair and don't wear makeup
[58:24] i wear makeup
[58:25] amen those things seem like simple
[58:26] things but they're huge in the eyes of
[58:28] god because it shows where your heart is
[58:30] amen
[58:31] because when you start to ask well what
[58:32] does it matter and why and how long is
[58:34] long and all these questions all you're
[58:36] doing is saying
[58:37] i want you but i want you as long as i
[58:39] can have some of me
[58:42] that's the real problem the real problem
[58:45] with the question is how long is long
[58:47] amen is not the question how long is
[58:49] long and because the holy ghost will
[58:50] reveal to you how long is long
[58:52] the real question is is how much of
[58:54] myself can i bring into this
[58:56] relationship
[58:58] so we think like these seem like trivial
[59:00] issues why is it trivial when brother
[59:02] branham preached it all through
[59:03] 63 64-65 because he's showing
[59:07] you want christ but you want christ
[59:09] according the way cain wanted christ
[59:11] according to his own will amen but you
[59:13] don't come to this word
[59:14] trying to hold on to your own idea amen
[59:17] your own desires and your own will but
[59:19] you come to this word
[59:20] not legalistically like if i don't cover
[59:22] my hair and don't wear makeup he'll give
[59:24] me the holy ghost that's not what he's
[59:25] talking about
[59:27] he's talking about a full surrender to
[59:28] the full word of god
[59:30] an absolute acknowledgement of who is
[59:32] here
[59:33] who is present amen it's not a message
[59:36] of brother branham this is jesus christ
[59:38] amen
[59:40] and if it's just brother branham's
[59:41] message it's subject to my
[59:43] opinions and my alterings and my
[59:46] [Music]
[59:47] see the whole problem with with dress
[59:50] and
[59:51] attitude and conduct and dirty jokes and
[59:53] and
[59:54] watching worldly movies and all that
[59:56] stuff it isn't friends it has nothing to
[59:58] do with that
[59:58] it's not like if i can cut out all the
[1:00:00] worldly movies and wear my hair right
[1:00:02] and dress right i'm going to get the
[1:00:03] holy ghost
[1:00:04] that's not it but it displays your
[1:00:06] attitude towards jesus christ
[1:00:14] i hope that strikes home because we've
[1:00:17] made it too much about the hair
[1:00:19] and about the makeup and about the
[1:00:21] movies and about that
[1:00:22] it's not about that it's about your
[1:00:24] heart and no condition to receive him
[1:00:27] until you hate it all amen until you're
[1:00:30] willing to give it all up
[1:00:31] amen i hate amen i hate any desire that
[1:00:35] i have that's contrary to the word i
[1:00:36] hate it amen
[1:00:37] i want it going i want it washed out of
[1:00:39] me because all i want
[1:00:40] this word is so beautiful it's so
[1:00:42] magnificent this message is so perfect
[1:00:45] that's the only thing that i want and i
[1:00:46] want everything else to go away
[1:00:48] [Music]
[1:00:50] you may not yet have the strength or the
[1:00:51] capacity to make it go away but there
[1:00:53] sure ought to be a desire
[1:00:55] not not ought to be there must be a
[1:00:57] desire in you
[1:00:58] amen for all of it to be gone and just
[1:01:00] that word to live in me
[1:01:02] that's coming with the right approach
[1:01:04] that's the right attitude amen that's
[1:01:06] the right desire and when you come to
[1:01:08] god that way
[1:01:08] all you have to do is ask for your
[1:01:10] father for the holy spirit and he'll
[1:01:12] give it to you
[1:01:15] full obedience to the full word of god
[1:01:17] amen it is
[1:01:18] not check boxes on a list check check
[1:01:21] check check check
[1:01:22] all right god i'm here in line for the
[1:01:24] holy ghost
[1:01:26] and your heart still is black as coal
[1:01:28] full of lust and selfish desire and
[1:01:30] self-will
[1:01:32] but because you have a strong willpower
[1:01:33] and a strong constitution and a lot of
[1:01:35] self-regulation you're able
[1:01:39] because there's different personality
[1:01:40] types
[1:01:43] that's why legalistic churches abound
[1:01:45] because they attract people who like
[1:01:46] rules
[1:01:48] and they like having rules i like having
[1:01:51] rules
[1:01:55] and it's it because people with a strong
[1:01:58] constitution
[1:01:59] an ability to self-regulate and a strong
[1:02:02] will can come and check all the boxes
[1:02:05] and still have a dirty heart but believe
[1:02:08] that they're in the message and they're
[1:02:11] a message believer
[1:02:12] and that they have the token
[1:02:14] [Music]
[1:02:16] now i believe all the boxes should be
[1:02:18] checked don't get me wrong
[1:02:20] i like the rules but don't be deceived
[1:02:24] by the ability to obey
[1:02:26] amen a certain doctrine that you've got
[1:02:28] the holy ghost amen it's a change inside
[1:02:30] in your heart
[1:02:31] deep down on the inside not outside deep
[1:02:33] down on the inside
[1:02:34] that will reflect on the outside and
[1:02:36] that life will check all the boxes
[1:02:40] not your life checking all the bugs
[1:02:45] we get the cart before the horse
[1:02:49] you realize full obedience full
[1:02:52] surrender to the full word of god
[1:02:54] entitles you to the token
[1:02:56] when you go on your altar of your heart
[1:02:58] and you sacrifice yourself
[1:03:00] and you say lord i don't want nothing
[1:03:04] i'm not asking for anything i don't want
[1:03:08] gifts i don't want abilities i don't
[1:03:11] want
[1:03:12] recognition of man i'm not asking you to
[1:03:14] make me a preacher i'm not asking you to
[1:03:15] give me tongues i'm not asking you any
[1:03:17] vision
[1:03:17] i'm not asking for anything all i want
[1:03:19] is you and this word that i see is
[1:03:21] beautiful and i love it and i want to be
[1:03:23] connected with it
[1:03:25] that's the right approach and all these
[1:03:28] other things just go with it
[1:03:33] praise be to god
[1:03:40] i realize
[1:03:43] that this preaching is quite different
[1:03:48] but it's the truth and it's what the
[1:03:51] prophet taught us
[1:03:53] and i realized somebody can take one
[1:03:54] aspect of what said and they can pick it
[1:03:56] apart
[1:03:56] but you guys know me and i love you and
[1:03:58] you love me and you know the spirit that
[1:04:00] i'm bringing it in
[1:04:02] that it's got to be about him and no
[1:04:04] longer about me
[1:04:06] the problem in the church is it's always
[1:04:08] been about the church
[1:04:11] the problem through denominations has
[1:04:12] always been about it's been a
[1:04:14] believer-focused faith instead of a
[1:04:16] christ-focused faith
[1:04:19] and that's the problem in you and i
[1:04:20] that's the problem in this church that's
[1:04:22] the problem in every church
[1:04:24] is when it's a believer-focused faith
[1:04:27] and a believer-focused walk
[1:04:28] amen we're never going to get where we
[1:04:30] need to get and we'll constantly be
[1:04:31] frustrated feeling like
[1:04:33] we have a heavenly father who doesn't
[1:04:34] give us what i asked for because we're
[1:04:36] focusing
[1:04:37] on our own wants and our own desires but
[1:04:40] to get where we need to get with god
[1:04:42] there has to be a death to self and it's
[1:04:44] got to be a
[1:04:45] christ-focused faith and say christ
[1:04:48] is that word and that word that that
[1:04:50] prophet bought is right
[1:04:51] and everything else is wrong
[1:04:56] and i believe it and i want it and i
[1:04:58] will obey it and the part in me that i
[1:05:00] can't make obey it i'm going to ask him
[1:05:01] to give me something that i can obey
[1:05:03] that word because that's my desire
[1:05:06] to obey that word because that word
[1:05:10] is more than a doctrine of the church
[1:05:14] that word is more than a teaching of the
[1:05:16] seventh church age messenger
[1:05:18] that word is jesus christ made and
[1:05:21] manifest
[1:05:22] that is my bridegroom the revealed word
[1:05:25] that is who i've been introduced to that
[1:05:27] is who the bride has been united to in
[1:05:29] this area
[1:05:30] that is who we are embracing that is
[1:05:32] whose feet we're washing with our tears
[1:05:37] and if we focus that way we'll get
[1:05:38] exactly what god promised that we'll get
[1:05:41] when we recognize him when we come to
[1:05:42] him
[1:05:47] brother brahm says in the token again
[1:05:48] and if the life of jesus
[1:05:50] christ lives in the person they become
[1:05:52] identified with him
[1:05:54] it's christ in you not a church member
[1:05:57] not a system
[1:05:59] but a resurrected power it's the holy
[1:06:02] ghost as a token upon
[1:06:04] you that your life says amen to every
[1:06:06] scripture
[1:06:08] listen he didn't say your mouth says
[1:06:10] amen
[1:06:12] he said your life says amen
[1:06:16] that's the token friends it's the life
[1:06:19] of jesus christ
[1:06:20] took over your life and it's a power
[1:06:22] that you didn't have before but now you
[1:06:24] have
[1:06:25] and the power is the power to live a
[1:06:27] christian life a power to overcome
[1:06:29] the temptations you couldn't overcome
[1:06:31] before a power to overcome lust you
[1:06:33] couldn't overcome before
[1:06:34] it is a power that has come into the
[1:06:36] church to make you a witness of jesus
[1:06:38] christ
[1:06:42] praise be to god
[1:06:47] you see
[1:06:50] he says your life
[1:06:54] the holy ghost is a token upon you that
[1:06:55] your life says amen to every scripture
[1:06:58] the promise is written in there and you
[1:07:01] are not yourself no more you are christ
[1:07:03] you don't think your thoughts
[1:07:04] you don't think your thoughts you say i
[1:07:06] think you have no thought coming the
[1:07:08] life that was in christ is in you
[1:07:09] the mind that was in christ is in you
[1:07:11] the works that was in christ is in you
[1:07:13] and christ himself is in you you're dead
[1:07:16] and your life is hidden god through
[1:07:17] christ
[1:07:18] sealed in there by the holy ghost you're
[1:07:20] not your own
[1:07:22] if you look at and i want to i i want to
[1:07:25] keep teaching i don't want to get off
[1:07:27] and i get off on rants sometimes but i
[1:07:29] want to keep bringing it back to my
[1:07:31] where my heart is you look at peter
[1:07:34] before he
[1:07:34] he had the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:07:37] peter believed that jesus christ was the
[1:07:38] messiah he believed that he was the son
[1:07:40] of god
[1:07:41] he saw him in the resurrection
[1:07:45] he believed he was called of the lord
[1:07:50] but he still was afraid and he was
[1:07:52] intimidated by the jews and
[1:07:54] he didn't know what to do next and he
[1:07:56] had no power to live that bold life
[1:07:59] amen to proclaim the gospel amen until
[1:08:01] the baptism holy ghost came until the
[1:08:03] life that was in christ come in him
[1:08:04] and now it changed peter peter believed
[1:08:07] but it changed peter
[1:08:08] and now peter could go into action on
[1:08:10] what he believed
[1:08:12] peter runs out on the day of pentecost
[1:08:14] and he begins to preach and what is he
[1:08:15] preaching he's preaching
[1:08:17] the modern fulfillment of the old
[1:08:18] testament prophecies
[1:08:21] he's preaching modern events made clear
[1:08:24] by prophecy
[1:08:26] he's preaching the manifested word for
[1:08:28] our day he's preaching
[1:08:30] he's preaching the word and so in that
[1:08:34] peter as a transformation and now before
[1:08:37] peter is jocking for position peter
[1:08:39] wants
[1:08:40] christ to bring in the kingdom peter
[1:08:42] wants to sit at his right hand
[1:08:44] peter wants to be one of the greatest
[1:08:45] amongst the disciples amen
[1:08:47] peter when jesus says that you know
[1:08:50] the son of man is going to be evenly
[1:08:52] mistreated and crucified and rise again
[1:08:53] the third day
[1:08:54] peter doesn't want that because that
[1:08:56] doesn't match peter's desire
[1:08:59] and it's not that peter so much loved
[1:09:01] the lord he didn't want the lord to die
[1:09:03] is peter so much loved peter that he
[1:09:05] wanted the lord to become
[1:09:06] king so that he could be part of the
[1:09:07] government
[1:09:11] human nature 101 it wasn't the love for
[1:09:15] the lord that was motivating peter it
[1:09:16] was the love for himself
[1:09:22] but after his conversion amen after
[1:09:24] peter filmed peter's repentance and
[1:09:26] peter's conversion
[1:09:28] then peter comes out and now it doesn't
[1:09:30] matter if they beat him
[1:09:32] threaten him prison him he's going to
[1:09:34] preach the gospel because he's really in
[1:09:35] love with the lord jesus christ not
[1:09:37] himself
[1:09:38] so much so that when he gets to the end
[1:09:40] of his life he says don't even crucify
[1:09:42] me the same way my lord was crucified
[1:09:44] but turn me upside down
[1:09:47] why because he he became nothing and
[1:09:50] christ became everything
[1:09:53] but even through peter's change peter
[1:09:56] changed you know we know what his
[1:09:57] temperament was before
[1:09:58] we know the boldness god gave him the
[1:10:00] humility he gave him afterwards
[1:10:02] but even yet when he's in antioch with
[1:10:03] the saints feasting and joining in with
[1:10:05] the gentiles
[1:10:06] when james sends a company of jews down
[1:10:09] what does
[1:10:09] peter do peter reverts back to some of
[1:10:12] his old ways and some of his old
[1:10:13] thinking
[1:10:13] amen and to save face with the jews he
[1:10:16] separates himself from the gentiles and
[1:10:17] won't eat with the gentiles but eat with
[1:10:19] the jews
[1:10:22] and god had a mouthpiece on the earth
[1:10:24] and the apostle paul and paul was stood
[1:10:26] into his face and told him he was wrong
[1:10:29] and before there would have been a huge
[1:10:31] fight
[1:10:33] but see what i want to show you is that
[1:10:35] peter
[1:10:36] peter was still subject to some peter
[1:10:39] stuff
[1:10:41] he still lived in the outer shell of
[1:10:43] peter
[1:10:44] but the inside of peter had changed
[1:10:47] so the inside of us has changed we still
[1:10:50] may have some outer shell things that we
[1:10:52] deal with amen
[1:10:53] and they were susceptible to peter was
[1:10:55] still susceptible to wanting to look
[1:10:56] good in the jews and worried about
[1:10:58] persecution or questioning from them for
[1:11:00] eating with the gentiles so he just
[1:11:02] separated from the gentiles amen so he
[1:11:04] didn't have to deal with all of this
[1:11:05] and paul was studying to the face that
[1:11:07] you are wrong amen instead of
[1:11:09] instead of smiting paul and chastising
[1:11:11] paul and saying paul's a false witness
[1:11:13] he just surrenders and he and he and he
[1:11:15] submits himself to what paul said
[1:11:19] why because he was converted because he
[1:11:21] had the holy ghost and what paul said
[1:11:23] was right
[1:11:23] anyway later went on to acknowledge that
[1:11:25] paul had the truth and what paul taught
[1:11:27] was right
[1:11:29] he didn't start a battle for the rest of
[1:11:31] their lives and contention
[1:11:32] amen peter was able to humble himself
[1:11:34] when he couldn't humble himself before
[1:11:36] but there's something inside in the core
[1:11:38] of peter that's different and
[1:11:40] although peter can be susceptible to the
[1:11:42] sticky cultivar nature
[1:11:43] amen there's something in him when faced
[1:11:45] with truth he'll always surrender self
[1:11:47] and take the truth
[1:11:48] [Applause]
[1:11:50] so we can preach the baptism the holy
[1:11:52] ghost in such a way and read quotes in
[1:11:53] such
[1:11:54] a way that you think that all you have
[1:11:55] to do that if you ever live
[1:11:57] any other life amen than a perfect life
[1:11:59] then you don't have it
[1:12:00] no it's not living a perfect life it's a
[1:12:03] perfect surrender to the life that's in
[1:12:06] you
[1:12:08] you may do something wrong you know
[1:12:10] brother branham told a lie he had his
[1:12:11] wife
[1:12:12] tell a lie and you know you may we may
[1:12:14] debate you know he had his wife to lie
[1:12:15] he didn't actually tell it but the holy
[1:12:17] spirit said why did you lie
[1:12:20] the holy ghost said you lied he lied
[1:12:23] what was it he was subject to the outer
[1:12:25] shell
[1:12:26] amen but when he was faced with truth
[1:12:28] when the holy ghost said why did you lie
[1:12:29] there was a there was a conversion on
[1:12:31] the inside that says lord i'm sorry amen
[1:12:34] i'm sorry that's the truth
[1:12:37] why because he was converted because he
[1:12:39] had the token on display
[1:12:43] the token is the life of jesus christ
[1:12:46] peter separating from the jews was not
[1:12:51] the life of jesus christ
[1:12:53] peter repenting in the face of the word
[1:12:55] was the life of jesus christ
[1:12:57] surrendering to the word brother branham
[1:13:01] telling a lie to the lawyer was not the
[1:13:03] life of jesus christ
[1:13:06] but brother branham being able to hear
[1:13:07] from the holy spirit in correction and
[1:13:09] surrender to the correction
[1:13:11] was the life of the holy spirit
[1:13:17] amen i'm so thankful that god has given
[1:13:20] us the truth
[1:13:28] let's go to first john 4.
[1:13:41] first john chapter 4.
[1:13:46] we'll start with verse 1. beloved
[1:13:49] believe not every spirit but try the
[1:13:51] spirits whether they are of god because
[1:13:53] many false prophets are going out into
[1:13:54] the world
[1:13:55] hereby know you the spirit of god every
[1:13:57] spirit that confesseth that jesus christ
[1:13:59] has come in the flesh
[1:14:00] is of god and every spirit that
[1:14:03] confesses not that jesus christ has come
[1:14:05] in the flesh is not of god
[1:14:06] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[1:14:08] wherever you have heard
[1:14:09] that it should come and even now already
[1:14:12] is it in the world
[1:14:14] year of god little children and have
[1:14:16] overcome them
[1:14:17] because greater is he that is in you
[1:14:19] than he that is in the world
[1:14:23] john is talking about he that is in you
[1:14:27] brother branham says in the message he
[1:14:28] that is in you he says now
[1:14:30] i would like to read first john 4 4 and
[1:14:32] he reads the scripture and he gets down
[1:14:34] to the verse that says year of god
[1:14:35] little children
[1:14:36] and have overcome them he says talking
[1:14:39] of the antichrist
[1:14:41] you have god little children and if you
[1:14:42] have overcome the antichrist
[1:14:45] which antichrist the one that is
[1:14:48] contrary to the word because the word is
[1:14:50] christ
[1:14:52] which antichrist the one that's with you
[1:14:54] the one that talks to you the one that's
[1:14:55] surrounding you the one that's all
[1:14:56] around
[1:14:57] how can you overcome that antichrist
[1:15:00] spirit
[1:15:00] antichrist is against the word
[1:15:05] greater see that is in you than he i'm
[1:15:07] sorry year of god little children have
[1:15:09] overcome
[1:15:10] them talking of the antichrist because
[1:15:12] greater is he that's in you
[1:15:14] than he that is in the world two
[1:15:16] pronouns see
[1:15:18] he personal pronoun he that is in the
[1:15:20] world and he that is in you
[1:15:22] he that's in you is greater than he
[1:15:24] that's in the world
[1:15:26] there's an antichrist spirit in this
[1:15:27] world and that antichrist spirit is
[1:15:29] constantly trying to influence your
[1:15:30] outer shell your carnal man
[1:15:33] but greater is he that is in you
[1:15:36] than he that is in the world the
[1:15:38] overcomer
[1:15:39] is on the inside it's not how strong you
[1:15:43] are
[1:15:44] it's not how bright you are it's he
[1:15:46] that's overcoming in you
[1:15:48] that's why we don't have to fear we
[1:15:51] don't to fear
[1:15:52] because greater is he that's in me than
[1:15:54] he that's in the world by the new birth
[1:15:56] that plants him inside me and now he is
[1:15:58] in me
[1:16:00] conquering everything else around me
[1:16:04] brother bam said in the message i have
[1:16:06] heard but now i see
[1:16:09] i want to start talking more about this
[1:16:11] token in token time we've talked about
[1:16:12] the batch of the holy ghost
[1:16:14] we started talking about the token but
[1:16:15] brother bam is going to start showing us
[1:16:16] there was a time for the token to come
[1:16:18] on display there was a specific time
[1:16:21] that the token was going to
[1:16:22] be on display and he says and we are now
[1:16:26] we are not living in luther's age wesley
[1:16:29] age
[1:16:30] or the pentecostal age now listen what
[1:16:32] he says
[1:16:33] the pentecostal age was only a
[1:16:35] restoration of the gifts coming back to
[1:16:37] the church
[1:16:39] this is important to note because
[1:16:41] brother brown will he'll go through
[1:16:43] justification baptism holy ghost
[1:16:45] and he starts talking about these things
[1:16:47] but brother barron is clearly showing us
[1:16:49] that the baptism of the holy ghost amen
[1:16:51] in the pentecostal revival was a
[1:16:53] restoration of the gifts back into the
[1:16:55] church
[1:16:58] and when we get to where we are now
[1:17:00] we're not going back to that this is
[1:17:02] something different than that
[1:17:05] the pentecostal age was only a
[1:17:06] restoration of the gifts come back to
[1:17:08] the church
[1:17:08] but we're living in the evening time
[1:17:10] we're living in a time of the calling
[1:17:12] out of the bride
[1:17:14] brother brahman explains this in resume
[1:17:16] of the ages in the church age book he
[1:17:17] says now
[1:17:18] as as this concluding chapter was given
[1:17:20] in order to trace the two churches
[1:17:23] and two spirits from pentecost to their
[1:17:25] consummation
[1:17:26] we will take this final time to show
[1:17:28] this in the laodicean age so he's just
[1:17:30] going to show it in the laodicean age
[1:17:32] so the age started just after the turn
[1:17:34] of the 20th century
[1:17:36] as it was to be the age in which the
[1:17:37] true church would return to being the
[1:17:39] bride
[1:17:40] she was at pentecost what was
[1:17:44] what was supposed to happen at laosei
[1:17:46] the true church
[1:17:48] it says it was it was to be the age in
[1:17:51] which the true church would return
[1:17:53] to being the bride she was at at
[1:17:55] pentecost
[1:17:57] we know that there must of necessity be
[1:17:59] a return of dynamic power
[1:18:03] the believers sensed this in their
[1:18:04] spirit and began crying to god for a new
[1:18:07] outpouring such as was in the first
[1:18:09] century
[1:18:11] this is so important he's saying we're
[1:18:13] coming to legacy in church we're coming
[1:18:15] to a time the
[1:18:16] true church must turn back to being the
[1:18:18] bride she was at the original pentecost
[1:18:20] and because of this they sensed that
[1:18:22] they needed a dynamic outpouring like at
[1:18:24] the beginning
[1:18:26] and all of that was correct there need
[1:18:28] to be a dynamic outpouring
[1:18:29] to return to give her the power to
[1:18:30] return back to being the bride
[1:18:33] and be they begin to cry out for an
[1:18:35] outpouring
[1:18:36] and this one he said what seemed to be
[1:18:39] the answer
[1:18:42] not the answer but what seemed to be the
[1:18:44] answer
[1:18:45] for the dynamic power that the church
[1:18:47] needed to turn back to being the bride
[1:18:49] what seemed to be the power but was not
[1:18:51] it what seemed to be the answer
[1:18:54] came as many began to speak in tongues
[1:18:55] and manifest gifts of the spirit
[1:18:58] it was then that it was then believed
[1:19:00] that this was indeed the long-awaited
[1:19:02] restoration
[1:19:04] it was not that is why we've got to go
[1:19:09] from pentecost from the pentecostal
[1:19:11] revival to this
[1:19:12] now to the token amen because that
[1:19:15] really
[1:19:16] wasn't what they thought it was but
[1:19:18] there had to be a dynamic power that
[1:19:20] would come
[1:19:20] to make the bride go back to being what
[1:19:22] she was it wasn't that
[1:19:24] amen that was the baptism of the holy
[1:19:25] ghost unto the restoration of gifts
[1:19:28] but now there is a baptism of the holy
[1:19:30] ghost unto the token life
[1:19:32] and that is the dynamic power that takes
[1:19:34] the bride back to what she was at
[1:19:36] beginning
[1:19:39] amen it was didn't believe that this was
[1:19:41] indeed the long way to restoration it
[1:19:42] was not
[1:19:43] for the latter rain can come only after
[1:19:46] the former rain
[1:19:48] which is the spring or teaching rain the
[1:19:51] latter rain then is the
[1:19:52] harvest ring how could this be
[1:19:55] the real thing when the teaching ring
[1:19:57] had not come the prophet messenger who
[1:19:59] was to be sent to teach the people
[1:20:02] and turn the hearts of the children back
[1:20:03] to the pentecostal fathers
[1:20:05] had not yet come thus what was thought
[1:20:08] to be the restoration
[1:20:09] and final quickening into the rapture
[1:20:12] had
[1:20:12] not come in it was a mixture of the
[1:20:17] unrighteous partaking of spiritual
[1:20:19] blessings and manifesting in the holy
[1:20:21] ghost
[1:20:21] as we kept pointing out to you and it
[1:20:24] also was devil power as men were under
[1:20:26] the control of devils
[1:20:27] yet no one seemed to realize it then to
[1:20:30] prove that it was not the real these
[1:20:32] people
[1:20:32] even before a second generation had
[1:20:34] appeared organized and wrote their
[1:20:36] unscriptural doctrines and built their
[1:20:38] own fences
[1:20:39] as every other group ahead of them did
[1:20:43] there's a reason that i say this
[1:20:48] because what looked like the baptism
[1:20:51] holy ghost that would be the injection
[1:20:53] of dynamic power
[1:20:55] that would take the bride back to what
[1:20:57] she was
[1:20:59] it was not what took place on azusa
[1:21:03] street
[1:21:05] what took place on azusa street was the
[1:21:07] baptism of the holy ghost unto the
[1:21:08] restoration of gifts
[1:21:11] i hope that you understand clearly what
[1:21:13] i'm saying
[1:21:15] and that won't work to bring the bride
[1:21:18] back
[1:21:18] to where she was in the beginning there
[1:21:20] must be something else another
[1:21:22] dynamic outpouring that would be poured
[1:21:24] out in the latter rain or the harvest
[1:21:26] rain that would come after the teaching
[1:21:28] reign after the prophet tied all the
[1:21:30] loose ends together
[1:21:31] then he would open the seals and show
[1:21:32] the mystery of god then there would be
[1:21:33] an outpouring of the latter rain
[1:21:35] that would be the dynamic power that
[1:21:37] would take the church back to what she
[1:21:38] was at pentecost
[1:21:40] that's why we cannot go back to a
[1:21:43] pentecostal revival experience of the
[1:21:45] baptism in the holy ghost we must keep
[1:21:47] moving forward to what god actually
[1:21:49] sent to us to be the power to bring the
[1:21:52] bride back to what she was and what did
[1:21:54] he bring
[1:21:54] amen he bring the revelation that was
[1:21:56] contained under the seals he brought the
[1:21:57] word back
[1:21:58] he brought the mystery of god that is
[1:22:00] unfolded would bring the life of christ
[1:22:03] back
[1:22:03] amen the holy ghost that was bound up
[1:22:05] has come back into the church
[1:22:07] in full measure with full power with the
[1:22:09] full dynamic power of the full baptism
[1:22:12] of the holy ghost to bring the church
[1:22:13] back to what it was at pentecost
[1:22:16] and that's why we cannot bring
[1:22:18] pentecostal revival teaching into this
[1:22:21] amen because we'll get it wrong amen
[1:22:23] because that wasn't it
[1:22:24] it looked like it but that wasn't it
[1:22:26] that was the restoration of the gifts
[1:22:28] amen but then come the restoration of
[1:22:30] the word that brought back the full life
[1:22:32] of jesus christ
[1:22:34] and that is the dynamic power that will
[1:22:36] take the bride back to what she was at
[1:22:38] penny
[1:22:40] so all of those ideas now there was
[1:22:43] nothing wrong with the pentecostal
[1:22:45] revival it was correct
[1:22:47] there was genuine seed and a genuine
[1:22:49] move of god that was correct amen
[1:22:51] but it must move on to further light
[1:22:55] so there's no condemnation to 1906.
[1:22:58] hey if i was alive in 1906 because i'm a
[1:23:00] seed of god i would have been in azusa
[1:23:02] street
[1:23:04] it was correct it was right it was of
[1:23:06] god but it wasn't what they thought it
[1:23:09] was
[1:23:14] that's why this is token time
[1:23:18] after that time comes token time
[1:23:22] brother says the lamb was killed in the
[1:23:24] evening time
[1:23:25] after being kept up for 14 days and then
[1:23:27] the lamb was killed and the blood was
[1:23:29] applied
[1:23:29] in the evening time you get it the token
[1:23:32] never come into existence
[1:23:34] until the evening time this is so
[1:23:37] important the token never come into but
[1:23:40] they had the baptism the holy ghost and
[1:23:41] brother baby said they had the baptism
[1:23:42] holy ghost
[1:23:43] but the token never come into existence
[1:23:45] until the evening time
[1:23:48] so what is the token it's what they
[1:23:51] couldn't have before
[1:23:52] even under a baptism of the holy ghost
[1:23:56] because under that they still had false
[1:23:59] understanding of false doctrine and
[1:24:00] didn't know the mystery of god
[1:24:04] so there couldn't be the full life which
[1:24:06] is the token which is the life of jesus
[1:24:07] christ
[1:24:08] what was back there was still a portion
[1:24:11] but to have the token it's got to be the
[1:24:13] full word
[1:24:15] that's why this is token time and it
[1:24:17] couldn't be token time till the
[1:24:18] evening time and this is the evening
[1:24:22] time of the age that we live in
[1:24:24] this is the evening time for the church
[1:24:25] this is the evening time for me this is
[1:24:27] the evening time of my message
[1:24:29] i'm dying i'm going i'm moving out in
[1:24:31] the evening time of the gospel
[1:24:33] and we've come up through justification
[1:24:35] and so forth but this is the time that
[1:24:37] the token has to be applied
[1:24:40] i'm going to read several quotes to show
[1:24:42] brother brad i'm teaching this and the
[1:24:43] feast of trumpets
[1:24:44] he says the holy spirit has been bound
[1:24:46] by these denominational rivers for
[1:24:47] almost
[1:24:48] 2 000 years
[1:24:52] so was it the fullness of the holy ghost
[1:24:54] no it was bound
[1:24:56] you can only have the fullness of the
[1:24:57] holy ghost after it's
[1:24:59] unbound it's been bound by these
[1:25:02] denominational rivers for almost two
[1:25:03] thousand years
[1:25:04] but is to be loosed in the evening time
[1:25:06] by the evening time message
[1:25:08] the holy spirit back in the church again
[1:25:12] what taking the church back to what it
[1:25:13] was at pentecost
[1:25:15] the holy spirit back in the church again
[1:25:16] christ himself revealed
[1:25:18] in human flesh in the evening time
[1:25:22] he said he promised it there was three
[1:25:24] stages of it as i said the martyr's age
[1:25:26] of the martyr for it
[1:25:27] then the stage of the reformers and the
[1:25:29] stage of the reformers went all the way
[1:25:30] through the pentecostal revival
[1:25:32] that was the last stage of the
[1:25:35] reformation was the pentecostal revival
[1:25:38] so from the martyr's age and to the dark
[1:25:40] ages coming out of the dark ages was the
[1:25:41] reformers age
[1:25:42] uh uh luther wesley pentecost
[1:25:47] and now the calling out time so we're in
[1:25:50] a different time
[1:25:52] when finished at laodicean age according
[1:25:53] to revelation 10 the mystery of all the
[1:25:55] bible would be known to the bride is
[1:25:57] that right
[1:25:58] revelation 10 listen now the bride
[1:26:00] called out by the word
[1:26:02] the bride called out by what the word
[1:26:05] christ himself calling out the bride
[1:26:09] making plain hebrews 13 8 that he's the
[1:26:11] same yesterday today and forever
[1:26:13] does the same is the same this bride
[1:26:17] was not going to be called out amen she
[1:26:20] was going to be called out
[1:26:21] by the word which was christ himself
[1:26:24] calling out the bride you're united for
[1:26:27] christ with christ
[1:26:29] well how do i unite with him have you
[1:26:30] heard him calling you
[1:26:32] how's he calling you it's the message of
[1:26:34] the hour
[1:26:35] that's his voice calling to his bride
[1:26:38] it's the message that's on those tapes
[1:26:39] it's the message that came through that
[1:26:40] prophet
[1:26:41] that's the word that's christ the word
[1:26:43] for the day calling out his bride
[1:26:47] what's he calling you to he's calling
[1:26:48] you to a union
[1:26:50] so that you can display the token
[1:26:55] now i want to i want to jump over here
[1:26:58] and just read something for you
[1:26:59] because this is helpful to me when we
[1:27:03] see brother brennam's life brother
[1:27:04] brennan was
[1:27:05] a prophet a son of man revealing the son
[1:27:08] of man
[1:27:08] he was elohim coming flesh to reveal
[1:27:12] that he was bringing the promise of
[1:27:14] redemption to the seed of abraham
[1:27:17] he was the showing the sign of the
[1:27:19] messiah it was christ in him showing the
[1:27:21] sign of the messiah
[1:27:23] we understand that so he also was
[1:27:26] in inside of him within him was the the
[1:27:30] word made manifest for that day the
[1:27:31] first part of the word to come the full
[1:27:33] harvest maturity
[1:27:34] that seed that was within him came into
[1:27:36] harvest maturity
[1:27:37] and it was plucked up and waved over the
[1:27:39] people
[1:27:41] so he was a type of moses
[1:27:46] and and sometimes i think
[1:27:50] we get maybe a little bit discouraged
[1:27:52] watching brother branham's life
[1:27:54] thinking i don't have all the gifts he
[1:27:56] has i'm not doing what he's doing
[1:27:59] but brother graham told us you don't
[1:28:00] have to do what he does
[1:28:02] to have what he has you can have what he
[1:28:05] has without doing what he does
[1:28:08] and here he says in in 1964 and god's
[1:28:11] word calls for total separation from
[1:28:12] unbelief
[1:28:14] he said many people look at gifts in
[1:28:16] closing now people look at gifts and
[1:28:18] they think
[1:28:19] oh what a great thing and then they try
[1:28:21] to impersonate gifts
[1:28:23] you can't do that you can't make a penny
[1:28:26] be a dollar
[1:28:27] you can't make it be a dime see can't
[1:28:29] make it a nickel it's a penny
[1:28:31] but if you'll just recognize yourself as
[1:28:33] a penny and go with the rest of the
[1:28:34] chain
[1:28:34] see god can use you you might not be
[1:28:37] able to do all
[1:28:38] there wasn't everybody when god called
[1:28:40] israel out of egypt every
[1:28:42] one of them didn't have to do the same
[1:28:43] thing moses did
[1:28:45] but they believed it
[1:28:50] that's right they believed moses because
[1:28:52] they know that it was a sign of the hour
[1:28:54] and that god had proved that he had the
[1:28:56] word
[1:28:57] they didn't have to do what moses did
[1:29:02] to go to the promised land to be called
[1:29:04] out
[1:29:05] but they had to recognize who moses were
[1:29:07] and believe that what moses was doing
[1:29:08] was god and moses
[1:29:10] and we don't have to replicate brother
[1:29:12] branham's ministry
[1:29:14] we don't have to replicate his gifts
[1:29:16] amen are the gifts of the bride their
[1:29:17] gifts are all through the bride but
[1:29:19] they're divided severally as he wills
[1:29:22] brother branham had a collection of the
[1:29:23] gifts because he was showing the sign of
[1:29:25] the messiah
[1:29:26] he come as a prophet like unto moses he
[1:29:28] came amen to bring us in an exodus he
[1:29:31] came with gifts and manifestations he
[1:29:33] came as elohim and flesh
[1:29:35] he came as the messiah a son of man are
[1:29:37] the son of man working through a son of
[1:29:39] man
[1:29:39] so he displayed all the life of jesus
[1:29:42] christ
[1:29:43] and all the gifts but you don't have to
[1:29:45] replicate that to have what he has
[1:29:48] but you can't deny any of it and have
[1:29:50] what he has
[1:29:52] you can't call it false you can't reject
[1:29:54] it you can't say it's not true
[1:29:55] just like any other scripture you can't
[1:29:57] reject manifestations of the spirit you
[1:29:59] can't reject gifts of the spirit you
[1:30:00] can't reject any word and have him in
[1:30:02] you
[1:30:03] you've got to accept all the word
[1:30:07] brother mama says in a court trial he
[1:30:09] says you might not be able to do this
[1:30:11] we have one of them in one generation
[1:30:14] there was one moses none of the rest of
[1:30:16] them didn't have to turn
[1:30:17] dust in the fleas and so forth and water
[1:30:19] and the blood there was one moses
[1:30:21] the rest of them just believed what he
[1:30:23] said
[1:30:27] you don't have to replicate his gifts
[1:30:32] but you have to replicate his faith
[1:30:35] you have to believe the word you must
[1:30:38] believe
[1:30:39] all the word and i want to jump
[1:30:42] back to the token time
[1:30:45] he goes on i'm still trying to
[1:30:49] lay this foundation for the time that
[1:30:50] we're in so god's only provided a place
[1:30:53] of worship he says now you people
[1:30:55] that had that old shouting methodist
[1:30:57] mother and so forth
[1:30:58] that you wondered if she didn't speak in
[1:31:00] tongues she ain't going to be there
[1:31:01] that's a lie she was the same holy
[1:31:04] spirit that you have today
[1:31:11] the same holy spirit that you have today
[1:31:13] but it was in
[1:31:14] tassel form
[1:31:18] not restoration of the gifts
[1:31:21] see when they come to restoration of the
[1:31:23] gift they look back at the holy ghost
[1:31:24] and tassel form
[1:31:25] and said well they didn't have it
[1:31:26] because unless you have the guest amen
[1:31:28] you don't have it amen
[1:31:30] but he says she was the same holy ghost
[1:31:33] you've got today
[1:31:35] but in tassel form and it was the holy
[1:31:37] ghost in
[1:31:38] portion through looser and portioned
[1:31:40] through wesley and portioned through the
[1:31:42] restoration against
[1:31:43] but it's not in portion anymore
[1:31:50] he says but all seven days just eat the
[1:31:52] unleavened bread the word then back
[1:31:54] then that denominated they're dead their
[1:31:56] stalk they'd just be gathered
[1:31:58] and burned but the life's going right on
[1:32:00] through and what happened all the life
[1:32:01] that was in the stalk
[1:32:02] in the tassel in the shuck all winds up
[1:32:06] in the wheat what luther had
[1:32:09] i've got what wesley has
[1:32:13] i've got what the pentecostal revival
[1:32:15] have i got
[1:32:16] it all comes into the wheat all the life
[1:32:19] that was there
[1:32:20] comes into the wheat
[1:32:25] and the same holy ghost that brought
[1:32:26] luther brought wesley brought pentecost
[1:32:28] winds up in the bride
[1:32:30] at the resurrection
[1:32:33] it says back to token he says israel
[1:32:35] come through many things but it was
[1:32:37] evening time when the token was required
[1:32:40] and not in the morning not in the
[1:32:42] preparation the 14 days of keeping up
[1:32:44] the lamb israel
[1:32:45] knows something was coming so did luther
[1:32:47] know it so did wesley know it so did
[1:32:49] finney knox calvin know it
[1:32:51] this is it they knew there would come a
[1:32:55] time that the pillar of fire would
[1:32:56] return back to the church
[1:32:58] they know there would come a time that
[1:32:59] these things would happen but they
[1:33:00] didn't live to see it
[1:33:02] but they looked forward to it israel
[1:33:04] knew something was coming but it was in
[1:33:06] the evening time when the lamb's blood
[1:33:08] the token was placed on the door yet the
[1:33:10] lamb was already put up
[1:33:12] what brother bran was showing is they
[1:33:14] had already selected the sacrificial
[1:33:16] lamb they had already
[1:33:17] had the lamb in their possession amen
[1:33:20] they were going to have to slay the lamb
[1:33:21] and apply the blood in the evening time
[1:33:23] even though they already had the lamb
[1:33:26] he's trying to type this through the
[1:33:28] church ages
[1:33:30] he said it's been the lamb all the way
[1:33:31] through it was the lamb and luther's
[1:33:34] time
[1:33:34] it was the lamb in wesley's time but now
[1:33:37] is the token time that each house must
[1:33:39] be covered by the token
[1:33:42] he's saying this is a different time
[1:33:44] than any of the other
[1:33:46] previous church ages this is a different
[1:33:48] time they had the lamb
[1:33:49] they had a portion of the word they had
[1:33:52] a sacrificial lamb they had the lamb it
[1:33:54] was the lamb and luther's time it was
[1:33:55] the lamb in wesley's time and that was
[1:33:57] good enough in their time
[1:33:59] amen but there come a time that it
[1:34:01] couldn't be the lamb among them anymore
[1:34:03] it had to be the life
[1:34:04] of the lamb on the outside of the house
[1:34:08] and he says we've come to the same time
[1:34:10] where it's not good enough to say i've
[1:34:12] got some of the word and i've got part
[1:34:13] of the word and i've got
[1:34:14] what they had back there but you've got
[1:34:16] to have that life
[1:34:18] on display on the outside of your house
[1:34:21] the life of jesus christ now it's token
[1:34:24] time that each house must be covered by
[1:34:26] the token
[1:34:27] each house of god must be covered by the
[1:34:29] token all that's inside of it must be
[1:34:30] covered by the token and the house of
[1:34:32] god is the body of jesus christ
[1:34:34] and by one spirit we're all baptized in
[1:34:36] this token and become part of it
[1:34:38] that god said when i see the token
[1:34:40] displayed i'll pass over you
[1:34:41] what an hour that we now are living
[1:34:44] and blood identified identified the
[1:34:46] believer because the life had gone out
[1:34:48] could not come back so he had a
[1:34:50] chemistry he had to have like a pain
[1:34:53] a blood a chemistry that showed that
[1:34:55] life went from it
[1:34:56] and now the very spirit itself is the
[1:34:58] token the holy spirit
[1:35:00] itself is the token not the blood
[1:35:03] the blood was shed at calvary that's
[1:35:05] true but the blood as far as it went
[1:35:07] it is went back into the elements from
[1:35:09] which it came from the food that he
[1:35:10] lived on
[1:35:11] but you see inside that blood cell was a
[1:35:13] life that started that
[1:35:15] that started the blood cell to moving
[1:35:17] the chemistry had no life in itself and
[1:35:19] therefore
[1:35:19] it could not move but when the life come
[1:35:21] into the chemistry of the blood it
[1:35:23] formed a cell it formed its own cell
[1:35:25] then cell after cell then it became a
[1:35:26] man and that man was god emmanuel and
[1:35:28] flesh
[1:35:29] but when that life returned back the
[1:35:31] chemistry went to it
[1:35:32] but the token is the holy ghost upon the
[1:35:35] church
[1:35:36] that they see christ the token
[1:35:39] is not just saying that i believe in the
[1:35:42] sacrifice of jesus christ but the
[1:35:44] sacrifice of jesus christ has provided a
[1:35:46] life in this day
[1:35:48] not a partial life not a dip not what
[1:35:50] they had in previous days
[1:35:52] but it's provided something different
[1:35:53] because with the restoration of the word
[1:35:55] came the restoration of the life
[1:35:58] and now with the dynamic outpouring that
[1:36:00] come from the latter rain the church can
[1:36:02] go back to being what it was
[1:36:04] at pentecost brother branham says
[1:36:09] as noah moses and david reflected the
[1:36:11] coming of the perfect bridegroom
[1:36:14] this is a good quote think about that
[1:36:17] the old testament
[1:36:19] some of the patriarchs and prophets what
[1:36:20] they were showing they were showing that
[1:36:22] there was a perfect bridegroom coming
[1:36:24] moses was showing it but moses wasn't it
[1:36:28] david was showing it but david wasn't it
[1:36:31] as noah moses and david reflected the
[1:36:33] coming of his perfect bridegroom
[1:36:35] so has luther wesley and pentecost
[1:36:37] reflected the coming
[1:36:39] of a perfect bride they weren't it but
[1:36:42] they were showing it's coming amen
[1:36:43] luther was showing it's coming wesley
[1:36:45] was showing it's coming pentecost was
[1:36:46] not it but they were showing it's coming
[1:36:49] and now is time for the manifestation of
[1:36:52] the perfect bride amen
[1:36:53] how does she become perfect because
[1:36:54] she's been given a perfect word
[1:36:56] and she has a perfect surrender to a
[1:36:58] perfect word bringing the perfect life
[1:37:00] upon the bride and she believes
[1:37:04] she believes the word
[1:37:09] brother brahman says now
[1:37:12] in the masterpiece the life that was in
[1:37:15] the husk
[1:37:17] in the stalk and then the tassel and the
[1:37:19] husk all gathers into the seed
[1:37:21] and the life that was in the stalk went
[1:37:23] one went to make the other
[1:37:25] justification made away for
[1:37:26] sanctification sanctification made a way
[1:37:28] for the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:37:30] the baptism of the holy ghost made a way
[1:37:32] for the holy ghost itself
[1:37:34] to come right down in perf imperfection
[1:37:37] back to the word again to manifest
[1:37:40] itself
[1:37:42] when the holy ghost come when that holy
[1:37:44] ghost come back down in perfection
[1:37:46] how did it come it was the word again
[1:37:51] and that the words that i speak unto you
[1:37:53] they are spirit
[1:37:55] and they are life that's why what we've
[1:37:58] been given in this day is just not
[1:38:00] another doctrine
[1:38:01] it's not just a higher rung on the
[1:38:03] ladder
[1:38:06] wesley had a higher rung than luther the
[1:38:08] pentecostal revival had a higher rung
[1:38:10] than wesley
[1:38:10] this is not a higher rung on the ladder
[1:38:14] this is the destination this was the
[1:38:18] purpose of the ladder
[1:38:19] this was the point and the point was to
[1:38:21] get the people
[1:38:22] back amen by our restoration of the word
[1:38:24] by the revealing of the mystery
[1:38:26] by the revelation of the union between
[1:38:28] christ and
[1:38:29] his the bride and the bridegroom to get
[1:38:31] the people to believe the full word of
[1:38:34] god and let the full life of god come to
[1:38:36] bring them back
[1:38:37] to what had fallen in the beginning
[1:38:40] we're not here just to be a perpetuation
[1:38:43] of another church age we're here to be
[1:38:45] the manifestation of jesus christ
[1:38:47] in bright form his life in
[1:38:50] his body which is you and i
[1:38:55] and that could not come till the seals
[1:38:57] were open
[1:38:59] that could not come till the till the
[1:39:02] the deception of denominationalism was
[1:39:04] washed away
[1:39:04] that could not come till man's ideas
[1:39:06] were left in ruin that could not come
[1:39:09] until the mysteries had been revealed
[1:39:12] but when all that's revealed we can see
[1:39:14] who we are and who he is
[1:39:16] and what the point of the whole story is
[1:39:18] then we can surrender to that and say
[1:39:20] god
[1:39:20] i don't want any of the past i don't
[1:39:22] want anything else i just want you
[1:39:23] living in me
[1:39:24] amen and he comes down into his church
[1:39:26] and lives his
[1:39:27] own life in you and i and that is the
[1:39:31] return back to what they had at
[1:39:32] pentecost
[1:39:34] not a certain manifestation not a
[1:39:36] certain gift not a certain thing
[1:39:39] but his life in you and i
[1:39:42] that's what he wants that's the token
[1:39:45] and this is token time
[1:39:52] brother bam says i want to read two more
[1:39:54] quotes before we close
[1:39:56] i just want to nail this down he said so
[1:39:59] will the church come through
[1:40:00] justification
[1:40:01] sanctification baptism the holy ghost
[1:40:03] restoration of the gifts
[1:40:05] it's amazing how often he puts that
[1:40:06] together and in your book it's in
[1:40:08] parentheses
[1:40:09] when brother many times when he says
[1:40:11] justification sanctification baptism he
[1:40:13] goes he says restoration in the gifts
[1:40:14] he doesn't want you to lose sight that
[1:40:16] it was really the restoration of the
[1:40:17] gifts but the true baptism holy ghost is
[1:40:19] when that full life comes
[1:40:22] that wasn't it that was a baptism that
[1:40:24] was the baptism of the holy ghost amen
[1:40:26] to the restoration of gifts but the
[1:40:27] baptism of the holy ghost now
[1:40:29] is his life in the church
[1:40:34] it says i'll read that again come
[1:40:37] through justification sanctification
[1:40:39] baptism of the holy ghost restoration of
[1:40:40] gifts
[1:40:41] right on into the formed image of christ
[1:40:46] christ is the bridegroom the church is
[1:40:48] the bride and the brightest part of the
[1:40:49] bridegroom
[1:40:50] it'll have to be a word church not a
[1:40:53] denominational church it'll be the word
[1:40:55] church the word
[1:40:56] that's been made known and by the
[1:40:58] vindicated word of god
[1:41:01] he was the word she has to be the word
[1:41:05] he was the perfect bridegroom which was
[1:41:07] the word made flesh
[1:41:08] all the prophecies that spoke of him all
[1:41:10] the all that the forerunners had showed
[1:41:12] that he would be
[1:41:13] all the patriarchs and prophets he was
[1:41:15] the fullness of that
[1:41:17] then the bride has to be the same thing
[1:41:19] all that the word
[1:41:20] said that a bride would be all that was
[1:41:22] spoken of the virgin all that was
[1:41:23] foreshadowed in the church ages
[1:41:25] now has to come into perfection and he
[1:41:27] had to be
[1:41:29] a perfect bridegroom by reflecting a
[1:41:30] perfect word the word
[1:41:33] how can she be the bridegroom until she
[1:41:35] gets the full word
[1:41:38] there could be no manifestation there
[1:41:39] could be no token time
[1:41:41] until the full word comes and when the
[1:41:43] full word comes
[1:41:45] now the full potential is here
[1:41:51] this is important because if we don't
[1:41:52] understand this we start waiting
[1:41:56] we start sitting around and waiting for
[1:41:58] another revival another happening
[1:42:00] another
[1:42:00] something special another something we
[1:42:02] can feel
[1:42:05] but the latter rain has been poured out
[1:42:06] friends let it pour into you
[1:42:09] amen the latter arrangement poured out
[1:42:11] the harvest rain to bring the wheat to
[1:42:13] full harvest maturity
[1:42:14] it has come it has poured out we have
[1:42:17] what we need
[1:42:18] he is here and he's looking for somebody
[1:42:21] that will embrace that word that will
[1:42:23] love him for who he is
[1:42:24] the revealed word of the hour
[1:42:28] we say we love him but we're making love
[1:42:29] to systems and churches and ministries
[1:42:32] we're making love to sensations and
[1:42:34] we're making love to gifts amen
[1:42:36] and they're proving that we don't love
[1:42:38] him because he's standing here ignored
[1:42:40] the revealed word of the hour he's the
[1:42:42] tape say man he's the message he's the
[1:42:43] word that's on those tapes he's the word
[1:42:45] that's in your bible he's the holy ghost
[1:42:47] that's here to connect with you
[1:42:49] and we want to make love to a minister
[1:42:51] to a church
[1:42:53] to a move to a sensation to a gift
[1:42:59] instead of coming to him picking up your
[1:43:01] bible and saying this is you my lord
[1:43:04] and i love you grabbing your message
[1:43:07] book and reading and saying this is you
[1:43:08] my lord
[1:43:11] i love you i want you
[1:43:16] you know there's a time that
[1:43:20] when eliezer come to get rebecca he came
[1:43:23] with gifts
[1:43:26] he came with 10 camels full of gifts he
[1:43:29] came with a lot of gifts
[1:43:31] eliezer had a lot of gifts and
[1:43:34] she had family that was there but she
[1:43:36] was being called out of her
[1:43:37] denominational family
[1:43:39] but he still gave the family gifts
[1:43:44] he gave them gifts and she got gifts too
[1:43:48] the bride gets gifts she was adorned she
[1:43:51] had gifts
[1:43:53] and then he took her on a ride
[1:43:56] but she wasn't riding that camel for the
[1:43:59] gifts
[1:44:02] she didn't believe eliezer and follow
[1:44:05] eleazar for the gifts
[1:44:07] the gifts just went with it
[1:44:10] she was riding on that camel to unite
[1:44:12] with isaac
[1:44:14] there was one purpose for her to leave
[1:44:17] there was one purpose for her to follow
[1:44:18] eleazar and that purpose
[1:44:20] was a man who was waiting in the field
[1:44:22] in the cool of the evening
[1:44:26] and when she come riding along amen she
[1:44:28] asked eleazar who is this in the field
[1:44:30] she says that's my lord and she jumped
[1:44:33] down off of that beast and she went
[1:44:35] running across the field and brother bam
[1:44:36] said they ran to each other
[1:44:38] embraced one another because it wasn't
[1:44:40] the gift she wanted it was
[1:44:41] isaac that she wanted it wasn't eliezer
[1:44:45] she wanted it wasn't the gifts that she
[1:44:46] wanted
[1:44:47] it was isaac that she wanted and there's
[1:44:49] a bride in this day that has had a
[1:44:51] visitation of lease or she's been given
[1:44:53] gifts she's been told wonderful things
[1:44:55] about isaac
[1:44:56] all along the journey i'm sure she was
[1:44:58] asking questions about isaac
[1:44:59] and eleazar he knew firsthand all about
[1:45:02] isaac and all about the father and all
[1:45:04] about the sun
[1:45:04] amen and he's sharing all this
[1:45:06] information and no doubt her heart
[1:45:08] burned within her as eliezer was talking
[1:45:10] about isaac
[1:45:12] but that heartburn that information
[1:45:15] could
[1:45:15] not satisfy the longing in her heart the
[1:45:18] longing in her heart was not satisfied
[1:45:20] by hearing
[1:45:21] lease or talk about isaac
[1:45:24] the longing in her heart was not
[1:45:26] satisfied with isaac's gifts amen
[1:45:28] the longing in her heart could only be
[1:45:30] satisfied when she jumped down off that
[1:45:32] camel and went running across that field
[1:45:34] and embraced isaac and isaac took him
[1:45:36] into her mother's tent and those two
[1:45:38] became one
[1:45:39] and then she found the satisfaction of
[1:45:41] her longing amen
[1:45:44] there's been too many girls that wanted
[1:45:46] gifts and one at eleazar and one
[1:45:48] all this stuff but there's a bride on
[1:45:50] this earth amen she'll get gifts
[1:45:52] absolutely she'll get revelations she'll
[1:45:54] get information
[1:45:55] but what she wants is him
[1:46:00] she'll be taken to the tent and she'll
[1:46:02] become one with him
[1:46:04] and then she'll have her own
[1:46:05] manifestation of his life in her
[1:46:09] that's what mary got that's what rebecca
[1:46:11] got eventually rebecca got the
[1:46:13] manifestation
[1:46:14] she got the life of isaac impregnated
[1:46:17] into her
[1:46:18] and then she began to change amen as
[1:46:20] that baby grew and now
[1:46:21] she had the manifestation of the life of
[1:46:24] isaac in her
[1:46:26] and that's what the bride has she's been
[1:46:27] impregnated with the word and she's
[1:46:29] bringing forth the promised son
[1:46:33] mary she was there there was a prophecy
[1:46:36] that gone out and
[1:46:37] it was waiting amen it was waiting for a
[1:46:39] time to be fulfilled but mary was there
[1:46:41] and mary gets uh invitatio she gets a
[1:46:45] visitation
[1:46:46] from an angel messenger
[1:46:51] and that visitation of an angel
[1:46:53] messenger is for one thing and one thing
[1:46:55] only
[1:46:56] it's for her impregnation so that she
[1:47:00] can bring forth the promise of the hour
[1:47:04] you know that angel messenger didn't
[1:47:07] come
[1:47:08] down and force anything
[1:47:12] he just gave his message
[1:47:16] and the message was a little strange it
[1:47:18] took her a minute
[1:47:20] she said well how would this be and he
[1:47:22] tells her how it would be
[1:47:24] and something in her could recognize
[1:47:27] that's true
[1:47:29] listen and what he told her was a most
[1:47:31] amazing piece of information
[1:47:33] this prophecy that's been through the
[1:47:35] bible for 700 years that isaiah gave
[1:47:38] that was all the way back in genesis
[1:47:40] chapter 3
[1:47:42] you're going to be the one that brings
[1:47:43] it forth
[1:47:45] this was a little girl in nazareth a
[1:47:47] young woman in nazareth
[1:47:48] the most unlikely place the most
[1:47:50] unlikely person i mean you think you
[1:47:52] have doubts what about her doubts
[1:47:56] but yes she couldn't deny that something
[1:47:58] inside of her resonated at that
[1:48:00] messenger's voice
[1:48:01] when he said amen this is going to come
[1:48:03] upon you the holy ghost is going to
[1:48:05] overshadow you and the thing that will
[1:48:06] be in you
[1:48:07] amen will be emmanuel
[1:48:10] she said be it unto me according to your
[1:48:12] word
[1:48:13] and when when she went to elizabeth amen
[1:48:15] elizabeth began to prophesy elizabeth
[1:48:18] said
[1:48:18] these things shall be performed because
[1:48:21] she
[1:48:22] believed
[1:48:26] she had the capacity to believe and what
[1:48:28] was told her was performed unto her
[1:48:30] because she believed
[1:48:34] and guess what she had an experience
[1:48:39] but she had an experience without a
[1:48:41] sensation
[1:48:44] because brother benham said if you would
[1:48:45] have had a sensation what would you have
[1:48:47] god doing
[1:48:51] but she had an experience and that
[1:48:54] experience changed her
[1:48:55] and after a while she had evidence of
[1:48:57] the change
[1:49:00] oh don't you love the word of god
[1:49:02] friends you're right there you're right
[1:49:04] in the bibles your life has been written
[1:49:06] there
[1:49:06] it's been written and rebecca has been
[1:49:08] written in mary it's been written in all
[1:49:09] of them
[1:49:10] amen and your experience is already
[1:49:12] written there
[1:49:13] so that the devil can't come down and
[1:49:15] and and mess with your mind and get you
[1:49:18] distracted in old pentecostal ideas
[1:49:20] you can look at the word it says i had
[1:49:21] the same experience mary had i've had
[1:49:23] the same experience rebecca had
[1:49:25] amen i've been changed amen and now
[1:49:28] within me is the evidence it's not me
[1:49:30] it's christ in me it's changing me it's
[1:49:32] manifesting in ways i never dreamed
[1:49:38] praise be to god
[1:49:44] he says in the third seal
[1:49:47] and the church comes out of the dark age
[1:49:49] justification
[1:49:50] sanctification baptism the holy ghost
[1:49:54] incarnate word the way now
[1:50:00] come through justification come to
[1:50:02] sanctification
[1:50:04] come through baptism holy ghost
[1:50:05] restoration of the gifts
[1:50:08] but what's the fourth state of life
[1:50:10] wheat
[1:50:13] back to what incarnate word
[1:50:17] what was jesus christ incarnate word
[1:50:20] the word was incarnated in him he was
[1:50:22] the word made flesh
[1:50:24] and god dwelt in him what's the bride
[1:50:28] she's been sanctified by the blood of
[1:50:30] jesus christ she's been washed by the
[1:50:31] word
[1:50:31] she's been purified by him so that he
[1:50:34] can unite with her
[1:50:36] and now that word that's been given to
[1:50:38] us we've been impregnated by it
[1:50:42] and now that word is bringing forth its
[1:50:44] own life
[1:50:45] we've received it friends we've received
[1:50:47] the message of the hour received our
[1:50:49] bride
[1:50:49] we've embraced him we've washed his feet
[1:50:51] with our tears
[1:50:53] we've anointed him with the most
[1:50:55] precious thing we have our whole life
[1:50:58] we've we've wiped his feet with our hair
[1:51:01] our consecration our nazarite vow to be
[1:51:03] separate from everything else
[1:51:05] we've embraced him we've loved him we've
[1:51:08] recognized him when he's talking to us
[1:51:11] and he has come to us and taken us into
[1:51:12] the tent impregnated us
[1:51:15] and now it's his life manifesting in us
[1:51:20] that's the token friends it's not
[1:51:24] a certificate of completion it's not a
[1:51:27] trophy
[1:51:28] of merit it's not something we've earned
[1:51:31] that we can sit back and relax and say
[1:51:33] i've arrived
[1:51:36] it's his life in you
[1:51:41] how do i get it brother chad surrender
[1:51:46] just surrender to him and ask the father
[1:51:50] and believe that he's your father
[1:51:53] and that you've obeyed his word you've
[1:51:55] obeyed this message
[1:51:57] and if he asks will he not give you good
[1:52:00] gifts will he
[1:52:02] not give the holy ghost to them that ask
[1:52:07] if you're seeking the right person the
[1:52:10] right way
[1:52:11] you're dying to yourself and you're all
[1:52:13] your love is him
[1:52:15] you're obeying the message of the hour
[1:52:17] and you're identifying that it's the
[1:52:18] truth and you're lining
[1:52:20] up to it as much as you can you're
[1:52:22] giving yourself over to it
[1:52:25] and you ask your father who you know is
[1:52:27] your father by revelation
[1:52:29] if you ask him for the holy ghost will
[1:52:32] he not give it to you
[1:52:34] will you not become impregnated by his
[1:52:37] life will you not now
[1:52:39] be the virgin carrying the life in this
[1:52:42] planet
[1:52:42] on this earth will it be the incarnate
[1:52:46] word in you
[1:52:47] yes will it be the token life living
[1:52:49] through you yes
[1:52:50] it'll be his life in you jesus christ
[1:52:54] in the formation of the bride
[1:52:58] we know that's true corporally
[1:53:01] we know that's true that it's jesus
[1:53:03] christ and the manifestation of his
[1:53:05] bride
[1:53:05] jesus christ and the formation of the
[1:53:07] bride jesus christ
[1:53:08] and bride form we know that's true right
[1:53:11] that's corporally we know that's true
[1:53:13] but individually it's got to be true to
[1:53:15] you
[1:53:16] it's got to be true for me it's got to
[1:53:18] be true for you as an individual
[1:53:20] this is no longer identification with
[1:53:22] the church this is identification with
[1:53:23] christ
[1:53:25] we're past the days of identification
[1:53:27] with the church our identification with
[1:53:28] the ministry
[1:53:29] amen we're even past the days of
[1:53:31] identification with eliezer
[1:53:35] but we're at the time of identification
[1:53:38] with christ
[1:53:38] and him alone and he is the word for
[1:53:41] this day
[1:53:43] it's his life living through us
[1:53:48] brother branham told us who was here but
[1:53:51] so many didn't believe him
[1:53:53] brother braham said he's here i can't do
[1:53:55] those things
[1:53:57] he looked at somebody and says you know
[1:53:59] he says
[1:54:00] you've got to this condition in that
[1:54:02] condition and the lord healed you
[1:54:04] he said who did that woman touch i'm 20
[1:54:07] feet from here
[1:54:09] what he showed was somebody was touching
[1:54:12] the lord
[1:54:14] by faith and i say he can still be
[1:54:17] touched
[1:54:18] he's still here he's still on earth he's
[1:54:21] hearing his bride
[1:54:22] he's here is the manifested word for
[1:54:24] this day
[1:54:26] don't let him pass your way and go seek
[1:54:28] something else
[1:54:30] seek him embrace him
[1:54:33] love him and surrender your life
[1:54:36] to him let's all stand
[1:54:41] musicians if you come brother ben
[1:54:46] brother branham preached some
[1:54:47] interesting messages
[1:54:49] you can get a whole list of them
[1:54:50] together but i was just right before i
[1:54:52] came out i was just thinking about this
[1:54:53] subject
[1:54:54] i think brother venom says he preached
[1:54:56] the message who do you say this
[1:54:57] is
[1:55:02] i think that's still a viable question
[1:55:05] who do you say this is is this a
[1:55:08] doctrine
[1:55:09] this is the teaching of the seventh
[1:55:10] church age messenger is this the
[1:55:12] teaching of a pastor
[1:55:13] or is this christ
[1:55:18] he preached there is a man here who can
[1:55:19] turn on the light
[1:55:22] he's either here he's not here who's
[1:55:24] that man and what form is he in
[1:55:27] who do you say this is who he brother
[1:55:29] man's not talking about himself
[1:55:31] he's saying before he said who do you
[1:55:32] say this is it's not him he says it's
[1:55:33] not me i can't do those things i can't
[1:55:35] know that about you you can't touch me
[1:55:37] he said it's not me it's got to be him
[1:55:40] so there's a man here who can turn on
[1:55:41] the light who he wasn't the man behind
[1:55:44] the pulpit
[1:55:44] amen it was the man christ jesus who's
[1:55:47] here
[1:55:48] and i'd say there's still a man here who
[1:55:51] could turn on the light
[1:55:53] he preached the identified christ of all
[1:55:56] ages
[1:55:57] has he been identified to you or is he
[1:56:00] still in mystery for him
[1:56:02] and he preached who is this milk is a
[1:56:05] dick
[1:56:06] not who was that milk is a dick but who
[1:56:08] is this melchizedek because the
[1:56:10] melchizedek high priesthood has come
[1:56:12] down
[1:56:13] he's here friends he's here in the
[1:56:16] revealed word of the hour he's here
[1:56:18] in his bride he's here to unite with you
[1:56:21] if you can just die out to everything
[1:56:23] else and just want him
[1:56:24] and him only don't look for any certain
[1:56:28] gift or any certain thing just love him
[1:56:31] and seek him and only him
[1:56:33] and die to yourself don't seek him for
[1:56:35] selfish reasons don't seek him to
[1:56:36] for any other reason but just because of
[1:56:38] him
[1:56:41] and he'll be found by you if you search
[1:56:44] for him
[1:56:45] with all of your heart man let's bow our
[1:56:48] heads and pray
[1:56:50] lord jesus i thank you for your word
[1:56:54] lord
[1:56:56] god i hope lord that you're able to take
[1:56:59] what was spoken
[1:57:01] lord i know it wasn't exactly in the
[1:57:04] same fashion as the revelation in my
[1:57:06] heart because there's a
[1:57:08] there's a an inability in humanity
[1:57:11] and an english language to bring a
[1:57:13] revelation perfectly
[1:57:15] through human lips and through english
[1:57:17] words
[1:57:19] but you who gave the revelation lord you
[1:57:22] can quicken it in the hearts of your
[1:57:23] children
[1:57:25] i pray that you would take these words
[1:57:26] that were
[1:57:28] broken up and these words that were
[1:57:29] spoken and that you would bring them
[1:57:32] into reality form in the hearts of your
[1:57:34] children
[1:57:35] god we realize that we're in a unique
[1:57:37] time a special time
[1:57:39] there's never been a time like this time
[1:57:42] it's not another age it's not another
[1:57:44] step this
[1:57:45] is the step lord this is not another
[1:57:47] time
[1:57:48] this is the union with christ this is
[1:57:51] you and your
[1:57:52] bride united together and lord that's
[1:57:54] what we want
[1:57:56] your prophet told us that it was the
[1:57:59] lamb all the way through but now it's
[1:58:00] token time
[1:58:02] it was luther and wesley and the baptism
[1:58:04] the holy ghost but now
[1:58:06] it's the incarnate word and god we can't
[1:58:09] do these things in ourselves we can't
[1:58:11] manifest this life on our own we can do
[1:58:14] nothing unless you come and do it in us
[1:58:17] lord as a body of believers we want to
[1:58:19] surrender ourselves now
[1:58:20] lord lord there's somebody out there
[1:58:23] that's been looking for the wrong thing
[1:58:26] if they've been looking for a sensation
[1:58:28] or looking for a
[1:58:30] token evidence in some flesh way if
[1:58:33] they've been looking for a
[1:58:34] church or looking for a ministry or
[1:58:36] looking for something
[1:58:39] god i pray that you would draw their
[1:58:40] attention to you now
[1:58:42] so that they would stop looking anywhere
[1:58:44] else for deliverance but they would look
[1:58:46] only at you
[1:58:47] and they would recognize you're the word
[1:58:49] that's been delivered in this hour
[1:58:51] you are the message of the hour i pray
[1:58:55] god that you would
[1:58:56] lord open the eyes i believe lord you're
[1:58:59] still a man that's here that can turn on
[1:59:01] the light
[1:59:02] and i pray this morning that you turn on
[1:59:04] the light for many of your children
[1:59:06] and may they unite with you lord and
[1:59:08] surrender to you
[1:59:09] may they ask you heavenly father to fill
[1:59:11] them with the spirit and i pray you'd
[1:59:13] fill them lord
[1:59:14] empowering them to live your life to
[1:59:17] live a christian life
[1:59:19] to be a witness for you i pray you take
[1:59:22] every false notion and wrong idea that's
[1:59:24] been ingrained in us
[1:59:26] that's been taught to us or that we've
[1:59:27] taught ourselves
[1:59:29] i pray that you've washed all of those
[1:59:30] away lord and let the truth of your word
[1:59:33] and this message take effect in our
[1:59:35] lives
[1:59:36] god lift us up on high lift us out of
[1:59:38] ourselves and out of the carnal and out
[1:59:40] of the world traditions and out of
[1:59:41] church traditions let us move lord
[1:59:44] beyond all of that
[1:59:46] into a perfect union with you
[1:59:49] lord may your may your wish be our
[1:59:52] command may
[1:59:53] may every move and nudge of the holy
[1:59:55] ghost be our pleasure lord
[1:59:57] to perform may you have preeminence in
[1:59:59] us absolute full control
[2:00:01] may we surrender all and just want you
[2:00:03] above everything else
[2:00:05] and lord may you manifest your life
[2:00:07] through us may the token be on display
[2:00:10] may the realization that you've changed
[2:00:12] us lord that you've quickened us
[2:00:14] bring us such comfort and such peace may
[2:00:16] it be to us
[2:00:17] such an earnest of our inheritance
[2:00:20] i'll let your token be on display let it
[2:00:22] be painted on the outside
[2:00:24] of the door so all that pass by can see
[2:00:27] that there's a lamb on the inside
[2:00:29] that we feasted on the lamb that we
[2:00:30] become one with it now we're living the
