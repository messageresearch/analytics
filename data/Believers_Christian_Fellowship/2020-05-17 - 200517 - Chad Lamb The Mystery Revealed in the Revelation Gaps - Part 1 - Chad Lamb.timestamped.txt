[14:42] is
[14:44] hallelujah god bless you saints it's
[14:47] good to be with you this morning
[14:49] so good to see your faces and see how
[14:51] many were able to gather out
[14:53] everybody's in the wrong spot the usual
[14:55] seats are
[14:57] shuffled so i've got to look around and
[14:58] find who's here and who's not and so
[15:01] god bless you when we don't do our
[15:03] naturally assigned seats it's a little
[15:04] hard on me
[15:06] i'm sure on you too well god bless you
[15:09] i'm happy to be here this morning and
[15:11] i can tell you i come with a full heart
[15:13] you know i've been looking into some
[15:14] things in the
[15:15] in the message in the word that's been
[15:17] thrilling me but i'm also at the same
[15:19] time overwhelmed
[15:21] there's so much there it's so
[15:22] overwhelming that i've been praying i
[15:24] said lord i don't know how to bring it i
[15:26] don't know what to say i don't know
[15:27] where to start i don't know where to
[15:28] stop
[15:29] i don't know what to do so i'm just
[15:31] depending on god
[15:32] under the anointing just to bring the
[15:34] word the way he wants it
[15:35] and i pray that you'll pull so we all
[15:37] get the portion that we have need of
[15:40] while we're standing let's take our
[15:41] bibles and turn to revelation chapter
[15:43] one
[15:46] brother franco i explained to him kind
[15:47] of what i was going to go into
[15:49] and he so graciously came up with a
[15:51] powerpoint for me to help me so he can
[15:53] visualize
[15:54] maybe some of these and and he set it
[15:56] all up and
[15:57] gave me the slides to use and i've been
[15:59] so overwhelmed and so full i'm hardly
[16:02] got anything together on that we'll use
[16:04] some of that so i asked him to turn this
[16:06] camera thing on so i could draw pictures
[16:09] if that's the way we do it i don't know
[16:11] if we'll use this or this or what we'll
[16:13] do
[16:14] but i tell you the word is so rich and
[16:17] it keeps opening up
[16:18] and the picture that brother branham
[16:19] painted for us keeps getting clearer
[16:21] and clearer and clearer amen and god
[16:24] wants us to know who we are and where we
[16:28] are and
[16:28] what's going on he wants us to know
[16:30] those things and
[16:31] and so that's why he sent a prophet and
[16:33] we just thank god for that
[16:35] but as as things clear up as things open
[16:37] as as something else bumps open
[16:39] it's almost like uh i say it this way
[16:43] when you begin to see something in the
[16:45] message that
[16:46] that maybe you haven't seen before
[16:48] haven't seen this way or haven't seen as
[16:50] clearly
[16:50] as soon as it opens i want to stop
[16:52] everything and read the whole message
[16:54] again
[16:55] it's like i don't want to preach it yet
[16:56] i want to go back and i want to read the
[16:58] church ages i want to read the seals i
[16:59] want to read
[17:00] you know because you never feel adequate
[17:02] it opens up a whole nother layer and i
[17:04] don't
[17:05] i don't feel adequate i know i'm not
[17:07] adequate there's no way to explain it
[17:10] and there's no way to even comprehend
[17:12] all that god has given us
[17:14] for when he opened those seals he took
[17:15] the mystery off the whole bible
[17:18] that's not something you comprehend in
[17:19] five days you know
[17:21] a week two weeks two months the word is
[17:23] eternal and it continually unfolds
[17:25] itself
[17:26] and he took the mystery off of the whole
[17:28] bible so that we can enjoy
[17:30] feeding on the lamb and keep feeding on
[17:33] the lamb
[17:34] and we haven't run out of lamb to feed
[17:36] on
[17:37] i don't think they're going to run out
[17:38] of lamb to feed on
[17:40] and so we enjoy it so much so let's just
[17:43] read
[17:44] revelation chapter 1 verse 1 together
[17:46] and then we'll let you be seated
[17:50] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[17:52] gave unto him
[17:53] to show unto his servants things which
[17:55] must shortly come to pass
[17:57] and he sent signified it by his angel
[18:00] unto his servant
[18:01] john who bear a record of the word of
[18:03] god unto the testimony of jesus christ
[18:06] and of all things that he saw let's just
[18:08] bow our heads and pray
[18:10] dear lord jesus we thank you for this
[18:12] word we
[18:14] thank you god for the opportunity to be
[18:16] here
[18:17] we don't want to take it in vain we
[18:19] don't want to take it for granted lord
[18:20] but we want it to be meaningful
[18:22] we want each time that we're able to
[18:24] have this opportunity for it to have the
[18:26] impact that it should lord
[18:28] god we pray that you would bless us now
[18:30] lord we're asking that you would come
[18:32] down yourself
[18:33] that you would show on the scene like
[18:35] you promised you were and through the
[18:37] foolishness of preaching would you save
[18:38] the lost would you feed your sheep lord
[18:42] we've come hungry to feed from you would
[18:44] you move the man out of the way and all
[18:46] the inadequacies and all the failures
[18:48] and all the stumblings around would you
[18:50] move that over lord and do you just pick
[18:52] up a gift that's laying in a tabernacle
[18:54] of clay
[18:55] and would you use it in the name of
[18:56] jesus christ give us ears to hear in our
[18:59] heart
[18:59] to perceive all that you want to share
[19:01] with us in this hour that we live
[19:03] for you give your secrets to your
[19:05] sweetheart lord not to everybody but to
[19:07] your sweetheart the love secrets of
[19:09] what you've been planning and what
[19:11] you've been doing and where you're
[19:12] working lord
[19:14] i just pray that we would receive those
[19:15] secrets in jesus christ's name we pray
[19:18] amen you can all be seated
[19:23] if we can bring up the powerpoint i
[19:24] think we'll start there
[19:29] amen
[19:32] all right where do we start and where do
[19:34] we go
[19:35] the book of revelation if you look in
[19:37] most bibles it will say the revelation
[19:39] of saint john the divine
[19:41] that's not true
[19:44] he was the scribe who scribed it but
[19:46] revelations one says it's the revelation
[19:49] of jesus christ and brother mam said the
[19:52] whole bible is the revelation of jesus
[19:54] christ
[19:55] so that this means this book we're
[19:56] getting looked to this book contains the
[19:58] mystery of the whole bible
[19:59] because the whole bible is the
[20:01] revelation of jesus christ and now this
[20:03] book
[20:03] is introduced as the revelation of jesus
[20:06] christ meaning it's the same thing
[20:08] it comes and he says the revelation of
[20:10] jesus christ which god gave
[20:12] unto him to show unto his servants
[20:14] things which must shortly come to pass
[20:17] and he sent and signified it by his
[20:18] angel unto his servant john
[20:20] now we know because we've been through
[20:22] this many times for many years
[20:24] that there was an angel that that
[20:27] brought the message
[20:28] to john and all through the book of
[20:30] revelations you can see this
[20:32] angel speaking to john and bringing the
[20:34] revelation
[20:35] and we can find that in this in the in
[20:38] the book of revelation
[20:39] twice john tries to bow down and worship
[20:42] this angel
[20:43] and this angel says i'm of the prophets
[20:45] i am of a man
[20:46] he measures the city which is the
[20:48] measure of a man so you can find out
[20:49] that this angel
[20:50] is is a man a man and he's of the
[20:53] prophets
[20:54] he's of those who have the testimony of
[20:56] jesus christ so he would be a new
[20:58] testament prophet
[20:59] so we find out that this angel is the
[21:02] seventh angel or his brother branham
[21:04] who's bringing
[21:05] john john the type of the bride amen and
[21:07] we know that there was an angel
[21:09] that came that that that led brother
[21:11] branham all the way through so in type
[21:13] there's an angel coming to brother
[21:14] branham brother branham's the type of
[21:16] john because john because he's type of
[21:17] the bride and brother branham was part
[21:18] of the bride
[21:20] he was the wave chief he was the first
[21:21] part to come to harvest maturity
[21:23] so the types just keep rolling through
[21:25] but to us there was an
[21:26] angel that came to seventh angel to
[21:28] bring us the mystery of the revelation
[21:30] of jesus christ
[21:32] so we can see ourselves as typed in john
[21:34] in this book
[21:36] and when we look at this you can say
[21:38] let's read it again the revelation of
[21:39] jesus christ which god gave to him
[21:41] to show unto his servants things which
[21:43] must shortly come to pass
[21:45] and he sentenced signified it by his
[21:46] angel and to his servant john
[21:48] so he says here he's going to show them
[21:51] things that shortly come to pass
[21:54] now if we just look at that historically
[21:57] 2 000 years ago when john wrote this
[22:00] letter
[22:00] he says these things must shortly come
[22:02] to pass amen but it was nearly 2 000
[22:05] years and much of the unfolding of these
[22:07] events but if you look at it in modern
[22:09] terms
[22:10] as the seventh angel bringing the
[22:12] revelation of jesus christ
[22:14] to john the type of the bride now when
[22:16] you look at this angel messenger
[22:18] bringing this message to the bride
[22:21] then these things must shortly come to
[22:23] pass
[22:24] we're looking at a ministry through the
[22:26] 60s and to now
[22:27] and from from brother branham's ministry
[22:29] and to now
[22:31] all most of these things are not mostly
[22:33] much of this book has come to pass
[22:36] so when he writes this these things that
[22:38] must shortly come to pass
[22:39] he's writing for our day friends so the
[22:42] book of revelation is the bride's book
[22:44] amen
[22:44] right from the very first verse he's
[22:47] showing us
[22:48] that this is a this is when this
[22:50] revelation comes forth
[22:52] and his sentence signified by an angel
[22:54] amen to his bride
[22:55] john's the type of the bride these
[22:57] things must shortly come to pass
[23:01] and i just want to say god be praised
[23:03] for living in the hour when we can see
[23:05] this
[23:06] because for seven church ages they look
[23:08] at this verse and they wonder what it
[23:10] must shortly come to pass
[23:11] and there was uh you know
[23:12] pre-millennials post-millennials i don't
[23:14] understand all that but some people
[23:16] think
[23:16] things have already happened or things
[23:17] are gonna happen and there's great
[23:19] debates because there was no
[23:21] angel who was sent and signified to
[23:23] bring the revelation yet
[23:25] so man was probing with the best that he
[23:27] could he was probing and brother graham
[23:29] said sometimes he got pretty close
[23:32] but until this angel was sent and
[23:34] signified
[23:35] by the lord jesus christ amen we didn't
[23:38] know
[23:39] amen what these events all were so there
[23:41] was a great debate in the church
[23:43] or these things because it must surely
[23:44] come to pass so these things happen
[23:46] they're over with no they're coming in
[23:48] the future and there was a great
[23:50] debate but now we've seen the angel sit
[23:52] and signified
[23:54] is that right that's the day when these
[23:57] things must shortly come to pass
[23:59] praise be to god
[24:03] amen i just want to
[24:06] look at this quote and the feast of
[24:08] trumpets
[24:09] said we'll walk in the light the
[24:11] beautiful light one step at a time lord
[24:13] coming closer to him
[24:14] yeah children of the light accept his
[24:16] word keep walking
[24:18] and watching more unfold don't leave it
[24:20] no matter what somebody else says
[24:22] stay right in that and just keep walking
[24:25] with it
[24:26] watch it unfold and reveal itself the
[24:28] word of the seed and the seed in the
[24:29] right ground
[24:30] will bring forth of its kind just before
[24:33] this brother branham
[24:34] and the feast of trumpets this is the
[24:36] message that i've been going through for
[24:37] a couple weeks
[24:38] and i've been through it and through it
[24:39] and through it and i love this message
[24:42] feast of trumpets is one of my favorites
[24:44] i've been attracted to it and drawn to
[24:46] it for a while but i don't know why
[24:49] it's one of those things you're just
[24:50] drawn to and don't necessarily know why
[24:53] but i absolutely love it and in here he
[24:56] makes this statement
[24:57] he's talking about the man that doesn't
[25:00] believe
[25:01] you know and and and and what he could
[25:03] see can't see and
[25:05] he in the vice brother of them to come
[25:06] up to his house and he says well i don't
[25:08] see your house
[25:08] and he says uh how am i going to get
[25:10] there it's dark and he says well i've
[25:12] got his lantern here he said well that
[25:13] lantern won't shine the light on the
[25:14] house
[25:17] he says well he's shining the light on
[25:18] the path and the path leads to the house
[25:20] and then brother bam goes and he makes a
[25:22] statement he says see that lantern will
[25:23] only lead for one step at a time
[25:27] and then he comes and makes this
[25:28] statement we'll walk in the light the
[25:31] beautiful light
[25:32] one step at a time lord coming closer to
[25:35] him yeah
[25:36] children of the light accept his word
[25:38] keep walking and watch
[25:39] more unfold so the light of the word
[25:43] amen as god continues to unfold himself
[25:46] amen we've had the message for
[25:48] for a long time we've had it in print
[25:50] form we had an audio
[25:51] but it's still unfolding amen not a new
[25:54] message brother branham has not
[25:55] added material to the message he
[25:58] preached it he preached the message in
[26:00] its entirety
[26:01] and he's not adding new there's not
[26:03] addendums to the message he's not adding
[26:05] i mean new messages amen he preached it
[26:08] he preached it all
[26:09] and now we've got it and been feeding on
[26:11] it and watching that message that he's
[26:13] already preached unfold into greater
[26:15] light and greater light
[26:16] and greater light and so now
[26:21] brother man's teaching us in order to
[26:23] get to the destination which is all the
[26:25] way home
[26:26] you've got to trust in the light that is
[26:29] that
[26:30] that you have to trust in where the
[26:31] light is leading you
[26:34] because if you want to get all the way
[26:35] home you can't hold up the light and say
[26:38] yep there's a path and i see some trees
[26:40] and i see all this and describe
[26:41] everything you see in the line and say
[26:43] well i'm just going to wait here until i
[26:45] get home
[26:46] you'll never get home friends but you've
[26:49] got to recognize the next step
[26:51] and take the next step and when you take
[26:53] the next step
[26:54] it opens up more territory that is seen
[26:57] in the lights
[26:59] and this is our walk friends this is the
[27:02] way the bride is walking through the
[27:03] message
[27:04] amen this is the way brother branham
[27:05] walked in his journey he hold up that
[27:08] light
[27:08] and he sees the next move and takes the
[27:10] next step amen now he can't say i'm on
[27:12] the path
[27:13] you know and you hold up the light and
[27:15] the path looks like this and it looks
[27:16] like that
[27:17] and i know somewhere down the end of
[27:18] this road is a home so if i stay on this
[27:20] path
[27:21] and stand right here it'll lead me home
[27:23] it'll only lead you home
[27:25] if you'll walk where the light is
[27:27] shining
[27:30] because from that point you don't know
[27:32] if it turns right you don't know if it
[27:33] turns left
[27:34] you don't go up a hill down a hill a
[27:35] valley you don't know
[27:37] all you know is this is the path that
[27:39] leads to home and you can describe
[27:41] everything you can see but that won't
[27:43] get you home only thing that will get
[27:48] you home
[27:49] is to keep moving forward as the light
[27:52] bumps out more territory
[27:54] and we move into that territory it keeps
[27:56] opening up more territory
[27:58] and more territory and usually what
[28:00] happens is every time something bumps
[28:02] open
[28:02] you just step on that land and you're so
[28:04] mesmerized by what else you can see
[28:06] you just stand there and look at it for
[28:07] a while and describe it and preach about
[28:09] it forever
[28:10] [Applause]
[28:11] right because it's a thrill so i didn't
[28:14] know this was here and i didn't know
[28:16] that was there i heard him say that but
[28:17] now i see
[28:20] i read in the scriptures but now i see i
[28:22] heard him say it but now i see
[28:23] and so now we're walking in the light as
[28:26] he is in the light
[28:30] says now
[28:33] children of the light accept his word
[28:34] keep walking and watch more unfold
[28:38] don't leave it no matter what somebody
[28:39] else says stay right in that
[28:41] and just keep walking with it and watch
[28:44] it unfold and reveal itself
[28:46] the word is a seed a seed in the right
[28:48] ground
[28:49] will bring forth its kind
[28:53] now you can see why
[28:56] you can see why being afraid to move
[28:59] forward is so detrimental to our
[29:01] spiritual walk
[29:03] fear of moving forward in the light is
[29:05] detrimental to our spiritual walk
[29:08] but moving off and with a man-made light
[29:12] to blaze your own path is detrimental to
[29:14] our spiritual walk too
[29:15] we've got to let the light of revelation
[29:18] of this true word be our guide
[29:20] we can't just get impatient amen get
[29:23] impatient because the light's not
[29:24] i don't know where to go next the
[29:26] light's not showing it i get impatient
[29:28] and i just go trekking off on my own
[29:29] with some man-made light affair
[29:31] that's just as detrimental but it takes
[29:35] faith in the light that's coming from
[29:36] this word and it takes
[29:38] patience to wait for the word to open up
[29:40] more territory
[29:44] amen but the bride will have it she may
[29:47] not get everything right the first time
[29:48] but she'll get it right
[29:50] she's predestinated too
[29:54] brother branham he makes a statement in
[29:57] the introduction
[29:58] of the revelation of jesus christ out of
[30:00] the beginning of the church age book
[30:03] said through this volume we concern
[30:04] itself with the various major doctrines
[30:06] such as godhead water baptism
[30:08] found in revelation chapter one through
[30:10] three its main theme is setting forth of
[30:13] a detailed study of the seven church
[30:15] ages
[30:16] this is necessary in order to study and
[30:18] understand the rest of revelation
[30:20] for out of the ages comes the seals out
[30:23] of the seals comes the trumpets
[30:25] out of the trumpets comes the viles like
[30:28] the first burst of a roman candle the
[30:30] church ages come forth almighty initial
[30:32] illumination
[30:33] without which there could be no further
[30:35] light but once the brilliance of the
[30:37] seven church ages is given by divine
[30:39] revelation
[30:40] light upon light follows until the whole
[30:43] of the revelation opens wide before our
[30:45] wondering eyes
[30:46] and we edified and purified by its
[30:48] spirit
[30:49] are made ready for his glorious
[30:51] appearing even our lord and savior
[30:53] the one true god jesus christ
[30:57] so he's saying there's an initial burst
[30:59] of revelation coming forth in the
[31:01] revelation of the seven church ages
[31:03] and from there another burst and another
[31:06] verse for one leads to the other and one
[31:08] leads to the other and one leads to the
[31:10] other
[31:10] and after they all lead to this and lead
[31:12] to this and lead to this it opens
[31:14] it opens wide the revelation before our
[31:16] wondering eyes
[31:18] so we can't stop at the church ages the
[31:21] church ages came
[31:23] to bring more light on the seals the
[31:25] seals came for the trump as the trumpets
[31:27] came for the viles
[31:30] one leads into the next amen and so
[31:33] so we when they and when they all burst
[31:36] open
[31:37] we stand wide stand wide-eyed you know
[31:40] gaping before our wondering eyes
[31:43] and we edified and purified by its
[31:45] spirit
[31:46] let's read that again
[31:50] i just want to go back up one sentence
[31:51] but once the burdens of the seven church
[31:53] ages is given by divine revelation
[31:56] given by what divine revelation
[31:59] light upon light follows until the whole
[32:01] of the revelation
[32:02] opens wide before our wandering eyes and
[32:05] we edified and purified by its spirit
[32:08] what spirit the spirit of revelation
[32:11] edified and purified by its spirit
[32:14] are made ready for his glorious
[32:15] appearing even our lord and savior the
[32:17] one true god jesus christ
[32:20] praise the lord brother man makes a
[32:23] statement in the first seal
[32:26] he says
[32:29] as we and now as we study this
[32:32] you're comparing it now the first three
[32:34] books of the bible of revelation
[32:36] which we have pretty thoroughly combed
[32:38] through that it's the church ages the
[32:40] seven churches now there's
[32:41] seven church ages seven seals seven
[32:43] trumpets and vials
[32:44] and the unclean spirits like frogs and
[32:46] all this goes together
[32:48] my how i'd like to have a great big map
[32:50] and draw all across
[32:52] the way i see it you know just how that
[32:55] each one
[32:56] takes its place i draw it out on a
[32:57] little sheet of paper
[32:59] and everything so far hit just exactly
[33:01] right and with the time and the ages and
[33:03] they
[33:04] have come and gone and everything has
[33:05] blended in just perfectly right
[33:07] so it may not all together be right but
[33:10] it's the best that i know about it
[33:12] anyhow this is brother branham in the
[33:14] first seal
[33:16] he's making this statement he said it
[33:19] may not altogether be right but it's the
[33:21] best that i know about
[33:22] it anyhow and i know if i do my best and
[33:25] i make a mistake and try to do my best
[33:27] and the best that i know of god surely
[33:30] will forgive me for
[33:31] doing for the error if i have done wrong
[33:34] brother branham was moving forward by
[33:37] revelation
[33:38] amen he was seeing something he was
[33:39] moving into it and he was sketching out
[33:41] he wanted to draw it out he was trying
[33:43] to explain it he drew it out on the
[33:44] piece of paper he said it's all perfect
[33:46] he said it's the he said listen anybody
[33:49] said he said it may not altogether be
[33:50] right
[33:51] but it's the best that i know about
[33:53] anyhow now not brother
[33:54] i'm saying he's not bringing the wrong
[33:56] revelation that's not what he's saying
[33:58] but i think what he to me this is just
[34:00] brother chad he's saying i've sketched
[34:02] it out and i've drawn it out and i fit
[34:03] it in here the timeline the age is all
[34:05] fit
[34:05] he said it may not altogether be right
[34:07] what i believe he means is
[34:09] he may have something in the wrong spot
[34:12] it may not have one of the details right
[34:17] it's not bringing the wrong revelation
[34:19] because it's been the revelation's been
[34:20] given to him
[34:21] but as he maps it out as he draws it out
[34:24] as he sketches it out
[34:25] it may not be it may not altogether be
[34:28] right but it's the best that i know
[34:29] about anyhow
[34:31] and if i do my best and i make a mistake
[34:33] and trying to do my best
[34:34] and the best that i know of god surely
[34:36] will forgive me for doing for the error
[34:37] if i've done wrong
[34:39] brother branham wasn't leaving the word
[34:41] he wasn't leaving
[34:42] amen what the revelation from god amen
[34:44] he was as a man just trying to map it
[34:46] out and get all the details
[34:48] connected he said if i get it wrong in
[34:50] doing my doing my very best god will
[34:52] forgive me
[34:53] and i'm going to say that as we move
[34:54] forward in the word amen
[34:56] don't be afraid to move forward in the
[34:58] word just stay with the message amen
[35:00] just say what the prophet said stay with
[35:02] the scriptures and if we see something
[35:04] we can explore it hey if we get one of
[35:06] the details wrong we're not going to
[35:08] have the revelation wrong because that's
[35:09] been given to us by a prophet messenger
[35:12] but if we get one of those details in
[35:14] the wrong spot we tried to map it out
[35:16] and we got well god will forgive us for
[35:18] that because why we're trying to walk in
[35:20] the light as he's in the light
[35:22] not trying to get ahead of him but
[35:23] trying to see what he gave us to see
[35:26] and enjoy what he gave us to feed on
[35:28] amen not that we're afraid
[35:30] to feed on the message because he's
[35:32] given us the message
[35:33] what part are we afraid of are we afraid
[35:35] of the feast of trumpets because it's
[35:36] complicated
[35:38] it's been given to us to eat
[35:41] it's been given to us in joy it's been
[35:43] given to us for edification and
[35:45] purification
[35:47] we should enjoy it amen and if we get
[35:50] one of the details wrong or if we try to
[35:52] map it out
[35:53] god will forgive us for that he'll
[35:54] correct us he'll make it right because
[35:56] where is our heart what's our intention
[35:58] what is it we want to do we want to know
[36:00] him our lord and savior
[36:02] the revelation of jesus christ our
[36:04] husband is what's been given to us in
[36:06] this hour
[36:07] and i want to know more about him not
[36:09] less
[36:10] and i'm not satisfied with where my
[36:12] relationship is now
[36:14] and remember understanding is always
[36:17] bringing greater relationship
[36:20] that's why as you season a marriage with
[36:23] time
[36:23] amen and you go through hard times and
[36:26] obstacles and trials
[36:27] and you go through ups and downs you get
[36:29] an understanding for one another
[36:31] amen that can only be built through time
[36:33] and through trouble
[36:35] there's no other way to have the right
[36:37] level of understanding for a spouse
[36:39] unless you hit tough times and you go
[36:41] through turbulent waters together
[36:43] you never have a proper understanding of
[36:45] everything that's hiding in that sister
[36:47] and everything that's hiding in that
[36:48] brother
[36:49] but to find out what's laying there
[36:51] you've got to spend time
[36:53] and go through circumstances
[36:56] and what does it do it opens more
[37:00] opens a greater revelation of who your
[37:02] spouse
[37:05] it's already yours you're already
[37:07] married
[37:09] is that right he or she is already yours
[37:13] and you're already married but you're
[37:15] not content and happy you want to grow
[37:18] in that relationship
[37:20] you want a better understanding and
[37:22] that's the same thing with the bride in
[37:23] jesus christ she wants to know
[37:25] him she wants to know him
[37:28] and if there's more to know i want to
[37:29] know i want to know the story about when
[37:31] you were 5 years old tell me about what
[37:34] happened
[37:36] you know i don't think if you if you
[37:38] don't want to know those things your
[37:39] spouse will say hey
[37:40] i just remembered i went through a real
[37:42] tragic thing when i was 10 yeah
[37:43] i don't have time to hear that we're
[37:46] already married i know enough about you
[37:48] to get me through
[37:52] but see we can treat the message the
[37:54] same way
[37:57] i know enough to get me through i know
[37:59] god sent a prophet
[38:00] i know what's happened in days i know
[38:02] about the church ages i know where the
[38:03] churches went wrong
[38:04] i know enough to get me through this
[38:06] isn't about information this is a person
[38:08] this is a relationship this is the
[38:10] invisible union of christ in his bride
[38:12] amen we never get tired of seeing him
[38:14] unveil himself to us
[38:16] it never gets boring and never gets old
[38:19] amen every time a new scripture pops off
[38:21] the page
[38:22] we get excited and then we get
[38:23] butterflies in our stomach
[38:25] amen what is it he's telling us love
[38:27] secrets and we never get tired of the
[38:29] love secrets
[38:32] so if we get details wrong god will
[38:34] forgive us
[38:35] because what's our motive what's our
[38:37] objective what's our hearts
[38:38] intent what are we trying to do start a
[38:41] new message we don't want a new message
[38:43] amen
[38:43] start a new movement we don't want a new
[38:44] movement we don't want any movement we
[38:46] want
[38:47] him him our whole desire is him
[38:50] our husband our bridegroom the revealed
[38:53] word of this
[38:54] hour is our mate we are the word for
[38:57] this day
[38:58] he's the revealed word for this day
[39:00] that's our mate we're bound we're
[39:02] magnetized to come together and we can't
[39:05] stay away from it
[39:07] my mate is not somebody oh my goodness
[39:10] my mate my brother brenham told us our
[39:12] mate is not somebody just in a nail
[39:14] scarred body
[39:15] off in a distance waiting some time to
[39:17] come back but my mate is the revealed
[39:19] word that i'm uniting to right now
[39:22] he is the word we are the word and the
[39:25] word and the word is coming together
[39:27] and we enjoy the process
[39:30] him may risping love secrets what's he
[39:32] doing making love to his bride
[39:35] when he when he shines the light and
[39:37] says come a little further
[39:39] he's making love to the bride that's why
[39:41] the bride
[39:42] loves revelation she loves to see him
[39:47] clear and clear so i just want to
[39:51] i just want to put my disclaimer oh
[39:54] all i want to do today if i can have the
[39:56] liberty to do it just share with you
[39:57] what i'm seeing
[39:59] in the message what brother branham said
[40:01] share with you what i'm seeing
[40:02] amen and it might not be altogether
[40:05] right
[40:07] is that okay it may not be altogether
[40:11] right i don't mean that the revelation's
[40:13] wrong i don't mean that the message is
[40:14] wrong or the scripture is wrong
[40:16] but maybe my understanding of one detail
[40:18] or one detail i may have on the wrong
[40:19] spot
[40:21] but if i do it with the best of my
[40:23] ability with a pure heart
[40:24] if i make an error god will forgive me
[40:28] amen and he'll correct us don't worry
[40:31] he's got a good rod
[40:32] and he knows how to use it so let's turn
[40:36] to the book of daniel if we can together
[40:38] daniel chapter 2.
[40:40] and i'm not even ready to get into what
[40:42] i want to get into but i just want to
[40:44] lay a little background
[40:48] let me get to daniel too sorry i'm
[40:50] getting excited
[40:56] nothing makes me happier than the
[40:58] revelation of the word
[41:00] nothing and it's hard to explain unless
[41:04] you've experienced it
[41:15] all right daniel chapter 2 we're going
[41:16] to go to verse 40.
[41:18] but i want to go to the next slide here
[41:23] after we see revelations 1 1 when jesus
[41:27] christ was given the revelation and
[41:28] sentence signified it
[41:30] uh by an angel to his servant john
[41:34] that's the time that these things must
[41:36] shortly come to pass
[41:38] so that's that's our marker for me
[41:40] that's my marker
[41:42] when things should shortly come to pass
[41:44] is when that angel that's sent and
[41:46] signified by jesus christ comes to bring
[41:48] the revelation of jesus christ
[41:50] to john the type of the bride then from
[41:53] that point these things must shortly
[41:55] come to pass
[41:57] and so now brother branham he comes from
[41:59] here
[42:00] and he and he goes in the end of 1960
[42:03] he goes and he goes to revelation
[42:05] chapter 1 chapter 2 and chapter 3
[42:07] and he preaches the revelation of the
[42:09] seven seals and he shows us
[42:11] historically what has happened to the
[42:13] church the preaching on the revelation
[42:15] of the seven church ages i mean not the
[42:17] seals
[42:17] the revelation of the seven church ages
[42:19] is a look back on the last 2000 years
[42:24] and so we we see that but before brother
[42:26] branham comes to this
[42:28] there's an event that unfolds in the
[42:30] world
[42:31] and when this event unfolds in the world
[42:34] brother branham takes particular
[42:36] interest in this event and i say this
[42:38] because i
[42:40] i believe that i could spend the rest of
[42:42] my life
[42:43] studying the historical events that took
[42:46] place during the prophet's life
[42:48] and match them with scripture
[42:51] i don't think we've even scratched the
[42:53] surface friends
[42:55] because when that prophet was on the
[42:57] scene god was movies and program forward
[43:00] amen and events were happening events
[43:02] were having a biblical proportion of
[43:04] biblical significance
[43:05] and brother brahm kept pointing to them
[43:07] and he would point to them sometimes in
[43:08] a nonchalant way
[43:09] sometimes directly but sometimes just
[43:11] off the cuffs did you see the other day
[43:13] and he would move on amen why
[43:16] because it's got to be laying there for
[43:18] the bride to catch it and pick it up
[43:20] without him coming through and
[43:21] explaining the whole mystery
[43:25] so so there's an event that takes place
[43:27] but i want to start by reading daniel 2
[43:30] daniel chapter 2 verse 40.
[43:33] it says and the fourth kingdom shall be
[43:35] strong as iron
[43:36] so we know that this is the vision of
[43:39] nebuchadnezzar that he had a dream
[43:41] and in the dream he was terrified but he
[43:43] saw the head of gold
[43:45] the uh breast and arms of silver uh
[43:48] the belly and the thighs of brass and
[43:51] the legs of
[43:52] of iron going down to iron mixed with
[43:54] clay
[43:55] and that that is the the image that he
[43:58] saw and it's showing four
[43:59] gentile world powers that would dominate
[44:02] amen
[44:02] and only four gentile world powers from
[44:05] babylon
[44:06] to rome we know that the fourth is rome
[44:09] and rome mixes in with the clay
[44:11] and goes out into the feet and to the
[44:12] toes amen and that is the whole
[44:15] gentile world domination from from
[44:18] beginning to end
[44:20] nothing extra nothing else no bonus no
[44:23] additions no edits
[44:26] and when you get to the end of this then
[44:28] you know you're at the
[44:29] end of the gentile dispensation
[44:33] so that's why certain things happen in
[44:35] the prophet's life and he point at them
[44:37] and they are they're major events
[44:39] they're not major events in our
[44:40] generation
[44:41] there are major events in the program of
[44:43] god from before the foundation of the
[44:45] world
[44:46] these are not just little news clips and
[44:47] brother branham antidotedly took it and
[44:49] said something about the message
[44:51] amen this thing was ordained to happen
[44:53] before the foundation of the world to
[44:54] send a marker upon the earth so that the
[44:57] prophet begin to move forward in the
[44:58] program of god
[45:00] we'll go into that here and the fourth
[45:03] kingdom
[45:04] which is rome shall be strong as iron
[45:06] for as much as iron breaketh in pieces
[45:08] and subdueth all things
[45:10] and as iron that breaketh all these
[45:12] shall it break in pieces and bruise
[45:15] and whereas thou saw us the feet and
[45:17] toes part of potter's clay
[45:19] part of iron the kingdom shall be
[45:21] divided
[45:22] but there shall be in it of the strength
[45:24] of the iron for as much as thou
[45:26] saws the iron mixed with miry clay and
[45:29] as the toes of the feet were part of
[45:31] iron and part of clay
[45:33] so the kingdom shall be partly strong
[45:35] and partly broken
[45:36] and whereas thousands iron mixed with
[45:39] miry clay
[45:40] they shall mingle themselves with the
[45:41] seed of men but they shall not cleave
[45:43] one to another
[45:44] even as iron is not mixed with clay and
[45:48] in the days of these kings shall the god
[45:50] of heaven set up a kingdom
[45:51] which shall never be destroyed and the
[45:53] kingdom shall not be left to another
[45:55] people but it shall break in pieces
[45:57] and consume all these kingdoms and it
[45:59] shall stand forever
[46:01] for as much as thou saw us the stone was
[46:03] cut out of the mountain without hands
[46:05] and that at break in pieces the iron the
[46:07] brass the clay the silver and the gold
[46:10] the great god hath made known to the
[46:12] king what shall come to pass hereafter
[46:15] and the dream is certain and the
[46:16] interpretation thereof sure
[46:19] daniel wasn't mincing words it is
[46:22] certain
[46:22] and it is sure and he's showing a
[46:25] gentile world domination
[46:27] all the way down to where rome and rome
[46:29] breaks into the eastern and western
[46:31] uh uh kingdoms and it goes down and it
[46:35] begins to mingle with clay it mingles
[46:37] out into the world
[46:38] because pagan rome became papal rome
[46:41] and pagan rome died and remember papal
[46:44] rome rose in its place
[46:45] and it became a church that mixed itself
[46:47] into the entire world
[46:49] and began to rule as a church but it
[46:52] began to rule politics and it began to
[46:54] rule and if you look down through
[46:55] history you can see this so clearly
[46:57] that the church ruled politics and in
[46:59] multiple nations
[47:02] and it goes all the way down into the
[47:04] feet and go all the way down into the
[47:06] toes
[47:07] and i just think it's a it's amazing to
[47:09] me that
[47:10] that satan's kingdom works from the head
[47:13] to the feet
[47:17] but god's kingdom works from the feet to
[47:19] the head
[47:21] because through the old testament they
[47:23] meant through the patriarchs and through
[47:24] the prophets and
[47:25] was building what building the body of
[47:27] jesus christ from the feet to the leg
[47:29] what was it becoming more clear all the
[47:31] time more clear all the time
[47:32] building up until finally through the
[47:34] old testament was was bringing forth
[47:36] jesus christ
[47:37] amen in a body of flesh and finally it
[47:39] was capped off by that great head that
[47:41] come and it was god in flesh emmanuel
[47:44] and then from there a piece was broken
[47:46] off amen and it was sowed
[47:48] and now it began to build amen through
[47:51] the through the
[47:52] apostles and prophets now building up
[47:54] through the seven church ages
[47:55] building from the feet to the legs to
[47:57] the arm all the way up to the finally
[47:59] the headstone comes back the headship of
[48:01] jesus christ the word comes back
[48:03] to cap it off to cap off this image
[48:05] which is jesus christ
[48:07] in bride form so satan's kingdom
[48:11] diminishes as it goes it can't get any
[48:14] better
[48:16] it gets stronger and it
[48:20] breaks and it tears but it doesn't get
[48:22] better it just gets stronger
[48:24] the political system and it goes from
[48:27] the head to the feet
[48:28] but christ builds from the feet to the
[48:31] head
[48:33] and and when the headstone
[48:38] the stone that was cut out of the mount
[48:39] without hands
[48:41] when at the time that the headstone
[48:43] comes it crushes the feet
[48:46] but caps the bride at the same time
[48:50] the same stone that's smiting is the
[48:52] same stone that's
[48:54] that's capping or vindicating or
[48:57] completing
[48:59] destroying and completing at the same
[49:01] time
[49:03] that's how the word of god works brother
[49:06] branham comes into the
[49:07] the thyatiran church age and i'm reading
[49:10] out of the church age book
[49:11] he said now along with that i have just
[49:13] said
[49:15] recalling the vision of daniel the last
[49:17] part of the image the last
[49:19] world power was in the feet that was
[49:21] iron and clay see
[49:22] iron is the roman empire but now it's no
[49:24] longer solid iron
[49:25] clay is mixed in it yet it is there and
[49:28] running world affairs in both the
[49:29] democratic nations and the more despotic
[49:32] ones
[49:32] it doesn't care it works in communism it
[49:35] works
[49:36] in capitalism it works in democracy it
[49:38] works in socialism
[49:40] it doesn't matter
[49:43] it can cross all lines
[49:46] he said the roman church is in every
[49:48] nation it is mixed up in it all
[49:51] let me give you a little something on
[49:53] the iron and clay remember when
[49:54] khrushchev
[49:55] beat his shoe on the desk at the u.n
[49:57] well there was five eastern nations
[49:59] there
[50:00] five western khrushchev spoke for the
[50:02] east and president eisenhower for the
[50:04] west
[50:04] in russia khrushchev is clay and
[50:07] eisenhower means iron
[50:08] the two main leaders of the world the
[50:10] two big toes of the feet of the iron and
[50:12] clay
[50:13] were side by side we are at the end of
[50:16] it
[50:16] all this is an important statement
[50:20] brother branham is not saying it's kind
[50:22] of like we maybe come to the end
[50:24] he said well this is kind of the end but
[50:26] it's not really the end i mean
[50:27] it'll go on for you know a long long
[50:29] time no he says we've come to the end of
[50:31] it all
[50:32] and the seventh seal is the end time
[50:34] seal
[50:36] so the seventh seal can't be open until
[50:37] the end of time
[50:39] because it's the end time seal and it
[50:41] finishes up everything
[50:43] so you've got to come to the end before
[50:45] the seventh seal can open
[50:46] because it's the end time seal so he
[50:50] points to this event
[50:51] that takes place in the world and
[50:54] brother branham draws significance to it
[50:56] he mentions it several times
[50:57] in 1961 he mentions the uncertain sound
[51:01] here the other day these conferences
[51:03] they've been there was mr eisenhower
[51:06] and khrushchev met up here in the united
[51:07] states eisenhower was representing all
[51:10] the western nations and khrushchev
[51:11] represented all the eastern nations
[51:14] did you notice there was nothing they
[51:15] could say they could
[51:17] they could get along khrushchev took the
[51:18] shoe off and and beat it on the desk and
[51:21] everything
[51:22] well don't you know that exactly
[51:23] fulfills what the prophet said
[51:25] do you know what khrushchev means in
[51:26] russia means clay do you know what
[51:28] eisenhower means in english iran
[51:30] iron and clay the east and west them two
[51:33] big toes of the vision of daniel
[51:35] we're already at the end friends
[51:39] praise be to god there's no question
[51:42] that's why when he's sent and signified
[51:44] about his angel to john these things
[51:45] must shortly come to pass because it's
[51:47] the end
[51:48] it's the capstone of the bible it's the
[51:50] end time
[51:52] in the message conference from 1961 he
[51:54] says now
[51:55] here they had another conference i'd
[51:56] like to speak of it just a moment
[51:58] the last conference they had at the u.n
[52:00] building where the east and the west met
[52:02] together where
[52:02] khrushchev took off his shoe and beat
[52:04] the desk with it eisenhower and
[52:06] khrushchev met eisenhower represented
[52:07] the five free world
[52:09] khrushchev the eastern communist world
[52:12] and that went right over the head of
[52:13] many people
[52:14] not praying not not praying concerning
[52:17] it
[52:18] there was a news event that took place
[52:20] it went out in the newspapers it was on
[52:22] the radio
[52:22] and he said it went over the head of
[52:24] most people praise god
[52:26] there was a prophet to bring it from
[52:28] over our head and bring it right to our
[52:29] attention
[52:30] because if it wasn't for that prophet
[52:32] it'd go over our head too
[52:35] so it went over their head because they
[52:36] weren't praying concerning it but
[52:38] brother benham was praying concerning it
[52:40] and he was able to catch something
[52:41] and he bringing it down now to show us
[52:43] so it doesn't go over our heads
[52:48] amen but if you happen to notice that
[52:51] was a direct answer
[52:52] and a direct prophecy fulfilled at that
[52:54] time
[52:55] it was a direct prophecy the east and
[52:57] the west had
[52:59] had fulfilled exactly what daniel said
[53:02] that ten kingdoms
[53:03] their wouldn't mix like iron and clay
[53:06] would not mix together and the word
[53:07] khrushchev in russia means clay the word
[53:09] eisenhower in english means iron
[53:11] and iron and clay could not get together
[53:15] he goes on to say in the end time sign
[53:17] seed in 62
[53:19] this great meeting they just had up
[53:20] there between khrushchev
[53:22] and eisenhower you know what khrushchev
[53:24] means in his own nation national tongue
[53:25] khrushchev means mud clay
[53:27] you know what eisenhower means in
[53:29] english iron and to even make it so
[53:31] plain to the people
[53:35] even to make it so plain to the people
[53:37] khrushchev took off a shoe and beat the
[53:39] desk
[53:40] to make what plane we're at the feet see
[53:43] the feet see the shoe where does the
[53:45] shoe go a shoe goes on the feet
[53:47] what's he making plain he's not making
[53:49] plain his objection
[53:51] well you know what he was doing he was
[53:52] objecting to something that was being
[53:54] spoken in the u.n and he was pounding on
[53:56] the table so hard
[53:57] that one account says his watch came off
[53:59] and another says his watch broke
[54:01] and he got mad he picked up a shoe and
[54:02] started beating his shoe on the table
[54:04] because he was objecting to what was
[54:05] being spoken
[54:07] so brother branham he didn't beat the
[54:09] shoe to draw attention to the objection
[54:11] he beat the shoe to draw attention to
[54:12] the fact so the whole world would see
[54:14] we're at the feet we're at the feet
[54:18] we've got ten toes we've got two big
[54:21] toes
[54:21] amen you can't go past toes
[54:25] the image starts at the top of the head
[54:27] it works it's all the way down to the
[54:28] feet
[54:29] turns at the feet comes forward you've
[54:31] come to the
[54:32] end of it when you come to the toes
[54:34] there's nothing left
[54:35] friends that's why brother branham looks
[54:38] at this and he says we've come to the
[54:40] end of it all
[54:44] praise be to god so why is time still
[54:46] going on because the seventh seal is
[54:48] finishing everything one thing at a time
[54:51] we've come to the end time shall be no
[54:53] more and now
[54:54] everything's finishing then finishing
[54:56] then finishing
[54:57] and a cycle of finishing
[55:02] but the finishing has already started so
[55:04] we've come to the end of it all
[55:07] we're not sitting here waiting oh we're
[55:10] not waiting for something else to happen
[55:12] it's already happened amen everything's
[55:14] been triggered the events have happened
[55:16] and the sequence of events have taken
[55:18] place and now the seventh seal is
[55:19] finishing
[55:20] everything finishing and then gentile
[55:23] world powers now
[55:24] finishing denominational systems amen
[55:26] now finishing
[55:27] governments about finishing this
[55:29] finishing the gathering of israel
[55:30] finishing finishing finishing finishing
[55:33] until finally the seven seal will finish
[55:35] the purging of the earth amen
[55:37] and usher in the millennial reign of
[55:38] jesus christ
[55:40] finish finishing what are you in we're
[55:42] in the seventh seal
[55:44] we're in the finishing we're in the end
[55:46] amen we're past the end
[55:48] in the end of the end
[55:51] amen friend where we are we got to know
[55:54] on the map
[55:55] you are here where is here past the end
[55:58] i'm past the end
[56:02] amen praise be to god
[56:07] i read that again even to make it so
[56:09] plain to the people khrushchev took off
[56:11] his shoe and beat the desk
[56:13] they will not agree what's going to rule
[56:15] romelu rule
[56:18] a confederation of churches the
[56:20] catholicism will
[56:21] bind it together and right there you are
[56:23] the ruling power
[56:24] the bible says that that's the seed that
[56:26] can't fail
[56:28] this is going to get really interesting
[56:32] i want to read one more quote along this
[56:33] line from the feast of trumpets 1964.
[56:37] notice quickly now these supernatural
[56:39] demons
[56:40] they're under the auspices of a united
[56:43] nation uniting groups together eastern
[56:45] and western
[56:46] just like the right and left foot of the
[56:48] image that daniel saw
[56:50] how they wouldn't agree and mix one with
[56:52] another
[56:53] now look how brother look at the
[56:54] terminology he's using
[56:57] just like the right and left foot of the
[56:59] image that then saw how they
[57:00] wouldn't agree and mix one with one
[57:02] another and the word eisenhower during
[57:05] that time eisenhower means iron
[57:06] khrushchev means clay and he pulled off
[57:08] his shoe and beat it
[57:10] on the desk and when the league of
[57:11] nations or the u.n khrushchev
[57:13] did dusting off the oh my the hour that
[57:16] we're living
[57:17] the church and its condition so brother
[57:20] branham wanted us to see some things
[57:22] and brother franco can you pull on this
[57:25] camera thing i'm going to try to use
[57:26] this
[57:27] you don't mind if i just take some time
[57:29] this morning let's just teach you know i
[57:31] get so
[57:32] i get so worked up and i go off on a
[57:34] tangent and i say so much that i don't
[57:35] even understand what i'm saying
[57:37] i don't even know what you're catching
[57:38] but i want to slow down and i want to
[57:40] just take this through this timeline
[57:42] what brother branham's looking at this
[57:45] event unfolds over a period of time
[57:47] now what we have is we have post-world
[57:49] war ii we have
[57:52] the world is beginning to divide between
[57:54] what they call free nations and
[57:55] communism
[57:56] and the ussr is formed and it's pulling
[57:58] in other nations
[57:59] to to it it's to agreement with its
[58:02] worldview
[58:03] and and now we come to a time where
[58:06] the the world powers have decided we've
[58:08] got to have peace we want to end the
[58:10] cold war
[58:10] the arms race is not good you know they
[58:13] saw what happened in world war ii with
[58:14] atomic weapons
[58:15] and they they want to they want to begin
[58:18] to disarm but they've got to come to a
[58:20] peace agreement
[58:21] because they have to disarm together
[58:22] because the u.s can't disarm
[58:24] well while the ussr is armed and vice
[58:27] versa
[58:27] so they stay on par with one another and
[58:30] so if they go up they go up together
[58:31] they go down they go down together
[58:33] so they're trying to make peace where
[58:34] they can come together but brother
[58:36] branham said
[58:37] they won't mix the iron and clay won't
[58:40] mix but they were trying to mix
[58:44] why so that we could see prophecy
[58:46] fulfilled
[58:48] so let's see if i can write this
[58:53] in september of 1959
[58:58] it works
[59:02] i'm so happy you may not be as excited
[59:06] as me but i'm excited right now
[59:10] it's september of 1959
[59:15] president eisenhower invites khrushchev
[59:17] over
[59:18] to visit the united states he spends
[59:19] some time in the united states they
[59:21] start
[59:21] discussions about disarmament and ending
[59:24] the cold war
[59:25] and the discussions go well at that
[59:28] meeting
[59:29] or just before that meeting they agreed
[59:31] that khrushchev will come
[59:33] and visit the u.s and in
[59:36] june of 1960 so let's do this
[59:40] dash june
[59:46] you know what the most dangerous part of
[59:47] this is is i can't spell very well
[59:54] and it may shock you the words that i
[59:56] misspell it's not the big ones it's the
[59:57] little ones
[59:59] i can sometimes get the big ones it's
[1:00:01] the little ones that are bad
[1:00:03] so in september
[1:00:06] khrushchev comes and visits the united
[1:00:08] states in june
[1:00:10] eisenhower is going to go visit ussr
[1:00:13] and his visit to the ussr is supposed to
[1:00:16] be uh
[1:00:17] the finishing of a deal that they're
[1:00:20] working on
[1:00:21] to end the cold war and disarm so the
[1:00:23] iron and clay
[1:00:25] are trying to mix together and the whole
[1:00:27] world is happy about this this is what
[1:00:29] we want to have happen
[1:00:30] so they're working on it so they
[1:00:34] start uh let me see here
[1:00:38] i'm going to write some more stuff down
[1:00:41] if i've got a pen and i've got a paper i
[1:00:42] might as well write stuff down
[1:00:45] but i can't spell chris jeff so i got to
[1:00:47] find it on my paper
[1:00:50] all right
[1:00:54] there's too many h's as far as i'm
[1:01:08] concerned
[1:01:11] i can't even spell eisenhower he's been
[1:01:13] one of our presidents
[1:01:17] yes sir brian i appreciate your support
[1:01:25] eisenhower to the ussr
[1:01:32] so so in between this
[1:01:36] they've decided to have a group
[1:01:39] that the uns sanctioned that are going
[1:01:41] to begin meeting
[1:01:43] on march 15th so march 15th
[1:01:49] to april 29th is the first meeting
[1:01:54] of the 10 nation
[1:02:00] committee on
[1:02:05] this armament
[1:02:10] there's a reason this is important
[1:02:11] there's a reason i'm doing this i like
[1:02:13] all these dates and stuff i know most
[1:02:14] people could care less just cut to the
[1:02:16] chase
[1:02:16] but i like that stuff this gives me an
[1:02:19] opportunity
[1:02:20] this is the worst thing that ever
[1:02:21] happened to us friends as i know how to
[1:02:23] use this now
[1:02:26] but but this ten nation
[1:02:29] committee on disarmament was five
[1:02:32] nations from the warsaw pact
[1:02:34] and five nations from the western bloc
[1:02:37] so the eastern bloc
[1:02:38] and the western bloc it was canada
[1:02:40] france great britain italy united states
[1:02:42] and bulgaria czechoslovakia poland
[1:02:45] romania and soviet union
[1:02:47] so what are the two big toes of those
[1:02:48] nations us
[1:02:50] ussr and the usa so now we've come to
[1:02:53] this
[1:02:54] uh they're going to have this meeting
[1:02:57] and in this meeting they're going to
[1:02:58] start drawing up plans
[1:03:00] and this is the plans are going to begin
[1:03:01] the peace process to end the cold war
[1:03:03] and disarm
[1:03:04] this is a great thing the iron and clay
[1:03:05] are going to mix
[1:03:07] but there they break april 29th
[1:03:10] because they're getting ready to have a
[1:03:12] paris summit and then the paris summit
[1:03:14] is going to begin march 15th or may 15th
[1:03:17] and in the paris summit
[1:03:18] eisenhower and khrushchev are going to
[1:03:20] come together and they're going to have
[1:03:21] a summit
[1:03:22] on peace again while this plan is being
[1:03:24] worked out and then after that plan
[1:03:26] breaks
[1:03:27] then after that meeting they're going to
[1:03:28] come back together in june
[1:03:30] this 10 nation committee on disarmament
[1:03:32] finish the plans
[1:03:33] and then eisenhower's supposed to visit
[1:03:35] in june to the ussr
[1:03:36] it's a beautiful plan the world's happy
[1:03:38] about it but something happens on may
[1:03:40] 1st
[1:03:42] may 1st the ussr
[1:03:45] shot down a u2 spy plane
[1:03:52] shot down a u2 spy plane and when they
[1:03:54] realized that the usa was still spying
[1:03:55] on them and infuriated the ussr
[1:03:58] they got angry they came to the paris
[1:04:00] summit which is supposed to be a peace
[1:04:01] summit
[1:04:02] and khrushchev is furious and
[1:04:05] and he demands a public apology and all
[1:04:07] of this stuff and and the and the talks
[1:04:09] completely dissolved the person
[1:04:11] everybody goes home it's ruined why
[1:04:14] why because the iron and clay can't mix
[1:04:19] you see everybody thinks they're doing
[1:04:21] things politicians are making decisions
[1:04:22] we're doing all this
[1:04:24] no they're fulfilling prophecy they're
[1:04:26] they're setting a marker so everybody
[1:04:29] can see
[1:04:29] hey the iron of because brother brandon
[1:04:31] will pick pick it up he said they're
[1:04:32] trying to mix themselves but they won't
[1:04:34] mix
[1:04:37] so they come to the paris summit may
[1:04:40] 15th
[1:04:42] it's bad and then
[1:04:45] he chris jeff cancels eisenhower's
[1:04:48] invitation to come to the ussr
[1:04:50] they try to go in june to have the
[1:04:52] second 10 nation committee on
[1:04:54] disarmament
[1:04:54] relations are so bad they disband it and
[1:04:57] never get together again
[1:04:59] this is the only time the only time
[1:05:03] five western nations and five eastern
[1:05:05] nations came together
[1:05:06] this is it after that they added more
[1:05:08] countries and more countries there was
[1:05:10] never a ten nation committee like this
[1:05:13] again
[1:05:15] why did it show up there because the
[1:05:16] prophet was on the scene
[1:05:18] why don't we have one now because the
[1:05:20] prophet was on the scene
[1:05:22] right there and he had to be there they
[1:05:23] had the world had to be split between
[1:05:26] democracy and communism there had to be
[1:05:28] a rise of the usa
[1:05:30] after war ii in the ussr both of these
[1:05:32] nations really rose up in prominence
[1:05:35] amen after world war ii why because
[1:05:37] there's a prophet on the scene
[1:05:39] getting ready to take us through the
[1:05:40] book of revelation and he's got to have
[1:05:42] a marker that shows where we are in time
[1:05:44] amen and he got to see the marker so now
[1:05:47] uh
[1:05:48] khrushchev there there's relations
[1:05:50] completely dissolved through the rest of
[1:05:52] the year in 1960.
[1:05:53] this is all taking place in 1960. so we
[1:05:56] come to the 12th of october
[1:06:00] 1960 at the united nations
[1:06:05] and khrushchev is there all the
[1:06:07] delegates are there
[1:06:08] and a delegate from the philippines gets
[1:06:10] up and starts speaking
[1:06:11] and he's speaking on behalf of the of
[1:06:14] democracy speaking on
[1:06:15] really khrushchev called him a a u.s
[1:06:18] crony
[1:06:19] but anyways he gets up and starts
[1:06:20] speaking he starts speaking against
[1:06:22] eastern nations losing their civil
[1:06:24] rights and losing privileges and going
[1:06:25] into communism
[1:06:26] and and that's when khrushchev gets
[1:06:29] angry and he starts
[1:06:30] banging on the desk to call a point of
[1:06:32] order because he believes the man's out
[1:06:34] of order
[1:06:34] and that's where he starts banging his
[1:06:36] hand he gets infuriated
[1:06:38] amen and he picks up his shoe and starts
[1:06:40] banging his shoe on the desk
[1:06:41] october 12 1960. this all
[1:06:45] unfolded amen throughout the year the
[1:06:47] end of 1959 to 1960
[1:06:49] but what does a prophet do a prophet
[1:06:51] looks at all of these stories together
[1:06:53] and he puts them right together and says
[1:06:55] this is that
[1:06:57] amen it's done in such a way amen nobody
[1:06:59] would piece it together
[1:07:01] it takes it takes months for this to
[1:07:02] unravel but
[1:07:04] what happens over months of time brother
[1:07:06] branham sees as one
[1:07:07] singular event in time that now
[1:07:11] now we're at the end friends when
[1:07:14] brother branham sees that
[1:07:15] when he sees them gather five in the
[1:07:17] east five in the west the two big toasts
[1:07:20] coming together in the paris summit
[1:07:21] it dissolves and breaks apart and
[1:07:23] finally winds up with khrushchev
[1:07:25] so that the world would know where we
[1:07:27] are in time
[1:07:28] takes off his shoe and begins beating it
[1:07:30] on the desk
[1:07:31] and that story goes through every major
[1:07:34] headline in every major paper
[1:07:37] why the youtube spy plane being shot
[1:07:39] down every paper covered it
[1:07:41] amen the tin committee conference on
[1:07:43] this armament every paper covered it
[1:07:45] just like amen life magazine covered the
[1:07:48] sign of the son of man in heaven
[1:07:49] why because god will testify to the
[1:07:52] world and make the world testify to his
[1:07:54] word
[1:07:56] and now this all happens it finishes
[1:07:58] october look at this october 1960.
[1:08:05] brother branham comes and preaches the
[1:08:06] church ages
[1:08:09] which he calls the revelation of jesus
[1:08:11] christ
[1:08:13] in december 1960.
[1:08:19] before brother branham moves in
[1:08:22] to the book of revelation
[1:08:26] he sees a marker that shows where we are
[1:08:29] in time
[1:08:31] and when he sees that marker where we
[1:08:32] are in time
[1:08:34] immediately after friends we're talking
[1:08:37] the 12th of october
[1:08:38] to the first weekend in december
[1:08:41] he moves right over and starts preaching
[1:08:45] the church ages starts in revelation
[1:08:47] chapter 1
[1:08:48] chapter 2 chapter 3 and from there he
[1:08:51] marches right
[1:08:52] through the book of revelation for the
[1:08:53] rest of his ministry
[1:08:56] amen because because why he was the
[1:08:59] angel that was sent and signified
[1:09:01] to bring this to john the bride
[1:09:04] and when he does these things must
[1:09:06] shortly come to pass
[1:09:10] you see the day we live in you see where
[1:09:12] we're at friends
[1:09:13] we're not we're not waiting these things
[1:09:15] have happened
[1:09:19] hey man so let's go back
[1:09:23] to daniel fricker you can turn that off
[1:09:28] and i'll just leave it there i might
[1:09:30] need some more i brought lots of paper
[1:09:35] i have no idea what's going to happen i
[1:09:38] don't know where we're going to get but
[1:09:39] we're not going to go too long
[1:09:40] there's a lot of details i don't mean to
[1:09:42] bog you down in details
[1:09:43] but to me this is important to me this
[1:09:46] matters what was brother venom seeing
[1:09:48] and why and what did it trigger
[1:09:50] nobody else caught that nobody else on
[1:09:52] the planet
[1:09:53] put that serious sequence of events from
[1:09:55] september 1959
[1:09:56] to october it took just a year for that
[1:09:58] to manifest nobody else knew what that
[1:10:00] was but brother branham knew what that
[1:10:01] was
[1:10:02] he knows that there was 2 10 there's 10
[1:10:04] kings coming together in the feet
[1:10:06] gentile days are done amen now it's time
[1:10:09] for the end time
[1:10:10] sign to break forth the end time sign
[1:10:12] and the end time seal to break forth to
[1:10:14] wrap everything
[1:10:15] up to usher in the millennium
[1:10:18] that's where we're at praise be to god
[1:10:23] amen now let's go
[1:10:26] let's look at daniel now where am i
[1:10:29] daniel daniel 40.
[1:10:34] daniel chapter 2 verse 42
[1:10:39] and as the toes of the feet were part of
[1:10:41] iron and part of clay
[1:10:43] so the kingdom shall be partly strong
[1:10:45] and partly broken
[1:10:46] and whereas thousands iron mixed with
[1:10:48] myriad clay they shall mingle themselves
[1:10:50] with the seed of men
[1:10:51] but they shall not cleave one to another
[1:10:53] even as iron is not mixed with clay this
[1:10:55] is where brother branham says see
[1:10:57] they won't mix together these ten
[1:11:00] nations they would not mix together
[1:11:02] and all broke apart to show they were
[1:11:05] trying to mix together but they won't
[1:11:06] mix together
[1:11:08] verse 44 and in the days of these kings
[1:11:12] did you catch that did you catch that
[1:11:16] in the days of these kings in the days
[1:11:20] of these kings
[1:11:22] shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom
[1:11:24] which shall never
[1:11:25] be destroyed it's the kingdom of the son
[1:11:28] of man it's the kingdom of jesus christ
[1:11:30] it's the kingdom of heaven and the lord
[1:11:32] himself
[1:11:33] has come amen to set up his kingdom in
[1:11:35] the hearts of his people
[1:11:39] amen that's the spiritual will to be a
[1:11:41] physical absolutely in the millennium
[1:11:42] this
[1:11:43] this kingdom will grow but i'm talking
[1:11:44] about in the days of these ten
[1:11:46] kings the god of heaven will set up a
[1:11:49] kingdom which shall never be destroyed
[1:11:51] and the kingdom shall not be left to
[1:11:52] other people but it shall break in
[1:11:54] pieces and consume all these kingdoms
[1:11:56] and it shall stand forever for as much
[1:11:58] as thou sauced them
[1:11:59] the stone that was cut out of the
[1:12:01] mountain without hands and that it break
[1:12:02] in pieces
[1:12:03] the iron the brass the clay the silver
[1:12:05] the gold
[1:12:06] the great god hath made known to the
[1:12:08] king what shall come to pass hereafter
[1:12:11] in another place he said that mountain
[1:12:13] amen it grew
[1:12:15] that that stone grew into a mountain
[1:12:17] that filled all of the earth
[1:12:19] that's going to take place from now and
[1:12:21] then from the time it smote
[1:12:22] until the until the end of the
[1:12:24] millennium it'll grow into a mountain
[1:12:26] what is that a kingdom
[1:12:27] the kingdom of jesus christ son of david
[1:12:30] will fill the whole earth
[1:12:33] amen when did it start it started now it
[1:12:36] started in me
[1:12:37] that kingdom has come and the kingdom is
[1:12:39] growing in me
[1:12:40] and it's filling all the world right now
[1:12:42] in the bride
[1:12:43] you are that kingdom that kingdom has
[1:12:45] come and that kingdom is word made
[1:12:47] manifest
[1:12:48] and you are the kingdom you are the
[1:12:49] mountain as growth from the sea
[1:12:51] when that stone came and struck it amen
[1:12:53] that was capping off of the church and
[1:12:55] from there
[1:12:56] the bride has grown and grown and grown
[1:12:58] and now
[1:12:59] in nations all around the world you have
[1:13:00] the bride of jesus christ what is it the
[1:13:03] kingdom
[1:13:03] of god is on earth and infiltrated
[1:13:06] the whole world and
[1:13:10] will through the millennium be a
[1:13:12] physical kingdom that will fill the
[1:13:14] whole world
[1:13:14] amen and i'm going to be there and i'm
[1:13:16] going to be part of that kingdom
[1:13:18] i'm going to be part of that ruling
[1:13:19] authority and that government there
[1:13:21] but how do i know because i'm part of it
[1:13:23] now
[1:13:24] i've got to recognize my part in the
[1:13:26] kingdom now because in the days of these
[1:13:28] 10 kings that a prophet of god on the
[1:13:31] scene showed us
[1:13:32] this is the end of it all right not
[1:13:35] another ten kings
[1:13:36] not a future ten kings but in the days
[1:13:39] of these ten
[1:13:40] kings amen there shall be a stone cut
[1:13:42] out of the mountain without hands
[1:13:44] a pure revelation
[1:13:48] not manhandled
[1:13:52] and it'll strike that image what is it
[1:13:56] because what was pagan what was carnal
[1:13:59] became spiritual down in the iron and
[1:14:02] the clay
[1:14:04] and it showed what spirit was in babylon
[1:14:06] the babylonian worship that came from
[1:14:09] nimrod
[1:14:09] that came from cain the false
[1:14:13] vine and its pinnacle from cain amen
[1:14:15] through nimrod
[1:14:16] from nimrod to syria from assyria to
[1:14:19] babylon
[1:14:21] and that religion has worked its way
[1:14:24] that false religion worked all his way
[1:14:25] down
[1:14:26] and come down into the clay and the iron
[1:14:29] and the feet and when that when that
[1:14:31] spiritual rock was cut out of that
[1:14:33] mountain without hand
[1:14:34] and hit that image it broke the pieces
[1:14:36] that entire false religion
[1:14:38] that entire false system the false mind
[1:14:40] was exposed
[1:14:41] the false religion was exposed because
[1:14:42] the seals the revelation was taken off
[1:14:44] the whole bible
[1:14:46] now we know how he deceived in the
[1:14:48] beginning now we know every fall
[1:14:50] how how that false vine has tripped up
[1:14:52] the true vine all the way down through
[1:14:55] it's been exposed the smiting stone has
[1:14:58] come and the smiting stone has smitten
[1:15:02] and it is growing into a kingdom that's
[1:15:04] filling all the earth
[1:15:07] praise be to jesus christ
[1:15:11] so many things we see this friends i
[1:15:14] when i say this
[1:15:15] this isn't an interesting bit of
[1:15:17] anecdotal evidence this isn't something
[1:15:19] oh it's neat that kind of fits together
[1:15:21] this is a happening that has happened
[1:15:23] and it is happening in our lives
[1:15:25] we got to get we we've got to give
[1:15:27] ourselves to that kingdom amen
[1:15:30] when we realize what's happening that's
[1:15:31] why the revelation that's why the
[1:15:33] revelation of this
[1:15:35] what does it do it edifies and purifies
[1:15:39] it edifies that prophet came to give us
[1:15:41] the revelation
[1:15:43] of jesus christ like i said he started
[1:15:46] at the beginning and walked through the
[1:15:48] book of revelation
[1:15:50] why because the revelation of it edifies
[1:15:52] and
[1:15:53] purifies because when you catch what has
[1:15:56] happened
[1:15:57] and you see world events tying together
[1:16:00] to point out a prophecy laying in the
[1:16:02] old testament
[1:16:03] so a new testament prophet can come and
[1:16:05] grab and say this is that
[1:16:07] what does it do to you are you edified
[1:16:10] are you edified that the smiting stone
[1:16:12] has come
[1:16:13] are you edified that it smote the image
[1:16:15] in the feet are you edified
[1:16:17] by that and now let it purify because
[1:16:19] what else do we care about
[1:16:22] what else matters amen what else what
[1:16:25] what job what
[1:16:26] what event what what article of clothing
[1:16:29] what new gadget
[1:16:30] what else matters amen in the face of
[1:16:33] this revelation
[1:16:34] it edifies and purifies
[1:16:37] automatically you don't have to ask
[1:16:39] somebody to give up something
[1:16:41] my goodness just give them something
[1:16:42] better
[1:16:44] and this is better this is sweet love
[1:16:46] words from our husband
[1:16:48] when he begins to reveal his secrets and
[1:16:49] you see what he's done and how perfectly
[1:16:52] he's done it and he says i did this for
[1:16:54] you
[1:16:54] my goodness your heart just begins to
[1:16:56] burst
[1:16:58] and you told me billions upon the earth
[1:17:02] and you told me
[1:17:05] there are billions of people on the
[1:17:07] earth there have been billions
[1:17:10] from the time of this debacle in 1960
[1:17:13] amen that happened in world events
[1:17:14] through world leaders there's been
[1:17:16] billions of people
[1:17:17] that have been on this earth from that
[1:17:18] time to now and you told me
[1:17:24] i mean count what are the odds of you
[1:17:26] knowing this what are the odds of you
[1:17:28] seeing this scripture fulfill
[1:17:29] of knowing the prophecy of daniel has
[1:17:31] been fulfilled what are the odds of
[1:17:33] knowing that
[1:17:34] that puts you in a special class of
[1:17:35] human being
[1:17:37] that puts you as the sweetheart of
[1:17:39] jehovah almighty because he doesn't tell
[1:17:41] his love secrets to everybody
[1:17:43] only to his sweetheart
[1:17:47] praise be to god i love this word
[1:17:51] it edifies and purifies
[1:17:55] oh praise his holy name
[1:18:00] amen where to next friends
[1:18:04] let's go a little further
[1:18:08] now if we could take your bibles out
[1:18:11] with me and let's do this together
[1:18:14] i got this bible up here
[1:18:17] this is just a picture that brother
[1:18:19] franco took and he put together but
[1:18:21] take your bible out and follow along
[1:18:26] we go to the book of revelation
[1:18:29] and we see in chapter 1 verse 1 the
[1:18:32] revelation of jesus christ which god
[1:18:33] gave unto him
[1:18:35] to show unto his servants things which
[1:18:36] must shortly come to pass
[1:18:38] he sent signified it by his angel unto
[1:18:40] the servant john
[1:18:42] so he he we go through from the
[1:18:45] beginning and
[1:18:46] you can see that your bible is
[1:18:48] constructed
[1:18:50] and it matches the ministry of brother
[1:18:52] branham
[1:18:53] he's walking right through this and i
[1:18:55] don't know if i can say it in a way
[1:18:57] say it correctly or show it in a way
[1:18:58] that you can see it but i pray by god
[1:19:01] that he'll let you see it i this is
[1:19:02] something that i'm seeing in the
[1:19:03] scriptures
[1:19:05] and when we get over to chapter one he
[1:19:07] begins to see jesus christ in the deity
[1:19:09] of jesus christ and he'll be able to see
[1:19:11] he begins to see that jesus christ is
[1:19:13] going to go through all the church ages
[1:19:15] and he's going to be in the midst of the
[1:19:17] seven candlesticks he's going to look at
[1:19:19] where he's going to be through all of
[1:19:20] this and
[1:19:21] and he comes to chapter two and and he
[1:19:23] begins to reveal
[1:19:25] from from john's standpoint it's
[1:19:27] prophetic
[1:19:29] from where john's at this is happening
[1:19:31] in the future
[1:19:32] from where brother branham's at he's
[1:19:34] preaching the seals from the past
[1:19:37] and so he preaches through these these
[1:19:40] seals
[1:19:40] then he comes over he are these church
[1:19:42] ages and he comes to the end of the
[1:19:44] church ages
[1:19:45] now friends i i'm going to my
[1:19:48] my brain is inadequate let's just start
[1:19:50] there and you're allowed to say amen
[1:19:53] it's quite all right with me it doesn't
[1:19:55] hurt my feelings to drop
[1:19:56] my brain is quite inadequate so if i say
[1:19:59] seals where
[1:20:00] where church ages go or church ages
[1:20:02] where trump or their seals go
[1:20:03] just say poor brother chad god help him
[1:20:06] his brain is fried
[1:20:08] the human mind can't keep up with the
[1:20:10] revelation
[1:20:12] but if you come here to the end and i
[1:20:15] don't know how it's out
[1:20:16] laid out in your bible every bible will
[1:20:18] be different but you come to the end of
[1:20:20] the seven church ages
[1:20:21] and at the end of the seven church ages
[1:20:23] you know verse 20 says
[1:20:25] chapter 3 verse 20 behold i stand at the
[1:20:27] door and knock and when you get to the
[1:20:29] end of the church ages you find jesus
[1:20:30] christ on the outside of the church
[1:20:33] amen he's already been put out
[1:20:36] is that right when john looks at that
[1:20:40] it's prophetic when brother branham
[1:20:41] points that out to us it's concurrent
[1:20:44] for him it was happening in his day
[1:20:47] so i didn't put out then we come to
[1:20:49] revelations chapter 4
[1:20:51] and chapter 5 chapter 4 setting the
[1:20:53] scene in heaven john's caught up through
[1:20:55] an open door in heaven he sees
[1:20:57] one sitting on the throne he he sees
[1:20:59] what's going on in the throne room and
[1:21:01] then chapter five is the event
[1:21:03] chapter four sets the stage chapter five
[1:21:06] is the event
[1:21:07] or there's a cry coming out there's a
[1:21:09] legal procedure going to take place
[1:21:10] who can take this book of redemption who
[1:21:13] can take this
[1:21:14] title deep book and then there comes
[1:21:16] forth the lamb the lamb takes the
[1:21:18] the lion the lion takes the book but
[1:21:20] he's a lamb amen and all the worship
[1:21:22] breaks loose
[1:21:23] and then he tears off the seals and in
[1:21:25] chapter in chapter six
[1:21:28] he begins to reveal what the seals are
[1:21:32] so when he begins to reveal the seals
[1:21:37] at the revelation of the seals he's
[1:21:39] going to bring the revelation of the
[1:21:40] entire bible
[1:21:43] so we have i'll just say this is my
[1:21:46] own terms we have a gap
[1:21:50] or a breach a breach is like a gap in
[1:21:53] the wall
[1:21:55] we have a breach and brother branham
[1:21:58] calls it the breach
[1:21:59] between the seven church ages and the
[1:22:01] seven seals
[1:22:03] calls it a breach a breach also means a
[1:22:07] bursting force
[1:22:08] like a birth of a baby or a bursting
[1:22:11] forth of a fountain or water can also be
[1:22:13] a breach
[1:22:15] and i'd like to say it's both it's a gap
[1:22:18] a breach between the seven church ages
[1:22:20] and the seven seals and at the same time
[1:22:22] it's a breaking forth
[1:22:24] something's going to be birthed and it's
[1:22:26] going to be a newborn bride
[1:22:28] [Music]
[1:22:29] praise be to god i love all these things
[1:22:32] for me this just thrills my heart
[1:22:37] so when you come to the breach
[1:22:40] oh let me just see i don't even know
[1:22:42] where my notes are yeah brother bram
[1:22:44] says in the feast of trumpets
[1:22:46] he said go into the prophet's chamber
[1:22:47] and watch them seven steps he's talking
[1:22:49] about the pyramid now
[1:22:50] when you go the pyramid you've got seven
[1:22:51] steps and the seventh step is a big step
[1:22:54] he said go ahead to the prophet's
[1:22:56] chamber and watch them seven steps
[1:22:58] where where did the guard meet the
[1:22:59] challenge to bring the comer to the
[1:23:01] presence of the king
[1:23:02] now look what he's saying on the seventh
[1:23:04] step amen there's a challenge
[1:23:06] of the guard there's a guard there
[1:23:08] brother bam calls him a prophet
[1:23:10] we know it's brother branham's ministry
[1:23:12] himself the seventh angel
[1:23:14] on the seventh step and he said that's
[1:23:16] where the guard
[1:23:17] meets the challenge of bringing the
[1:23:20] comer into the presence of the king
[1:23:23] where in the seventh church age on the
[1:23:25] seventh step
[1:23:26] what's happening there's got to be
[1:23:28] somebody there
[1:23:30] standing in the breach on the seventh
[1:23:32] step
[1:23:33] to bring the comer into the presence of
[1:23:35] the king
[1:23:37] somebody's got to stand in the breach
[1:23:39] somebody's got to bridge the gap
[1:23:41] when john the baptist come he stood in
[1:23:43] the breach between the old and new
[1:23:45] testament
[1:23:46] and he bridged the gap and he brought
[1:23:48] the people from the old testament
[1:23:49] into the presence of of the fulfillment
[1:23:52] old testament
[1:23:53] and come into the presence of the new
[1:23:55] and living way the atonement that was
[1:23:56] going to be made of jesus christ
[1:23:59] and there was a prophet on the scene to
[1:24:01] bridge the gap and it was john the
[1:24:02] baptist and brother branham said
[1:24:04] as john the baptist in 1933 on the river
[1:24:08] those weren't just neat words as john
[1:24:10] the baptist what did john the baptist do
[1:24:12] he introduced the messiah he stood in
[1:24:14] the gap
[1:24:15] he was in the breach between the old and
[1:24:17] the new and he bridged the gap
[1:24:19] between the old and the new testament
[1:24:21] and he introduced the messiah
[1:24:22] and as john the baptist amen your
[1:24:25] ministry will do the same and brother
[1:24:26] bannon is here
[1:24:27] to bring the comer from the seventh step
[1:24:30] to bring him into the presence of the
[1:24:32] king and he's in the breach
[1:24:33] standing in the breach he's got a
[1:24:35] ministry in the breach
[1:24:39] so go into that prophet's chamber and
[1:24:40] watch them seven steps
[1:24:42] where did the guard meet the challenge
[1:24:43] to bring the cummer into the presence of
[1:24:45] the king
[1:24:45] at the top of the steps was in the
[1:24:47] seventh step there shows that we've got
[1:24:49] to come again with the same
[1:24:51] spirit that was on john he introduced
[1:24:53] the messiah brother branham is tying
[1:24:55] these things right together
[1:24:56] you don't even have to imagine it and
[1:24:58] then he's putting it right together
[1:25:00] that the one on the seventh step has got
[1:25:02] to have the same spirit that john had
[1:25:04] because he's got to do the same thing
[1:25:05] john did
[1:25:06] to introduce the messiah what is that
[1:25:09] bring the comer
[1:25:10] into the presence of the king
[1:25:15] oh praise god you know how did you come
[1:25:18] into the presence of the king
[1:25:20] it was through that seventh angel every
[1:25:23] one of us we didn't come through mom and
[1:25:24] dad we didn't come to a church
[1:25:26] we didn't come through a preacher amen
[1:25:27] it was that seventh angel and if the mom
[1:25:29] and dad told you anything they told you
[1:25:31] what the seventh angel said
[1:25:33] and if a preacher told you anything the
[1:25:35] preacher told you what the seventh angel
[1:25:37] said
[1:25:37] it was the ministry of the seventh angel
[1:25:39] that brought you into the presence of
[1:25:41] the king
[1:25:42] that's why this means so much to us it's
[1:25:44] not past amen
[1:25:45] it's going on right now there's still a
[1:25:48] seventh angel message a voice that's in
[1:25:50] the earth today
[1:25:51] amen and the bride may be speaking in a
[1:25:53] preacher and a mom and a dad
[1:25:55] and a friend may be speaking it but it's
[1:25:57] still that same voice
[1:25:58] bringing us into the presence of the
[1:25:59] king
[1:26:00] [Applause]
[1:26:02] same word we don't have another message
[1:26:04] we have one message
[1:26:05] the message has been given to us
[1:26:12] he said there shows that we've got to
[1:26:14] come again with that same spirit that
[1:26:15] was on john
[1:26:16] he introduced the messiah he was greater
[1:26:19] than all the prophets he introduced it
[1:26:21] and we've got to come to a place again
[1:26:22] to something that's going to introduce
[1:26:24] the messiah
[1:26:26] and how will the people that's believing
[1:26:29] him
[1:26:29] know it unless they're constantly in the
[1:26:31] word to know what
[1:26:33] he is
[1:26:36] i love that terminology i don't think
[1:26:38] brother random misspoke
[1:26:40] he wants to know what he is what is he
[1:26:42] he's the word
[1:26:44] made manifest in our day
[1:26:48] that's the same thing he was 2 000 years
[1:26:50] ago
[1:26:51] what was he 2 000 years ago he was the
[1:26:53] prophecies
[1:26:54] laying in the bible made manifest and in
[1:26:56] flesh
[1:26:58] he was the manifested word amen for that
[1:27:00] day
[1:27:01] that's what he was then that's what he
[1:27:03] is now
[1:27:06] it doesn't have to be in the same form
[1:27:07] to be the same one
[1:27:13] how other people believe unless they're
[1:27:15] constantly in the word to know what he
[1:27:17] is
[1:27:18] daniel said the wise shall know but the
[1:27:19] foolish the unwise wouldn't know
[1:27:22] they shall know their god now how he
[1:27:24] shall appear in the last days
[1:27:26] is to bring the people back to the word
[1:27:29] so that the bride will know her husband
[1:27:31] know her mate the revealed word
[1:27:34] who are you uniting with the revealed
[1:27:36] word the person of the word the revealed
[1:27:38] word for this day
[1:27:39] that's who we're joining forces with
[1:27:42] her mate the revealed word that's why
[1:27:44] this has to happen
[1:27:46] it wasn't to the reformers it wasn't
[1:27:47] luther wesley and the pentecostals and
[1:27:49] scriptures say it wasn't
[1:27:50] but it will come that is his promise for
[1:27:53] this age
[1:27:54] where living in the age that is coming
[1:27:56] will be in she must be identified in him
[1:27:59] any woman must be identified with her
[1:28:01] husband for the two are one
[1:28:02] and christ's bride has to be identified
[1:28:04] with him for the two
[1:28:06] are one and he is the word not the
[1:28:08] denomination
[1:28:09] the word we are to be children of the
[1:28:11] light and the light
[1:28:13] is the word which is made light for this
[1:28:15] age
[1:28:17] how do we know light except it comes
[1:28:18] from the word all right the word made
[1:28:20] flesh is the light of the age when you
[1:28:22] see it
[1:28:22] and the bible said so now we know
[1:28:26] who we're married to christ
[1:28:29] the word revealed and on display
[1:28:34] praise god god is good
[1:28:39] so that was the the breach or the gap
[1:28:42] and i titled this message i don't even
[1:28:43] know what the title but i put the gap in
[1:28:45] the book of revelation but i
[1:28:46] i don't know you can title whatever you
[1:28:49] want
[1:28:51] so then we move from there if you
[1:28:52] actually look in your bible you move
[1:28:54] from there
[1:28:54] right into chapter six right into the
[1:28:57] seven seals
[1:28:59] when you get into the seven seals you
[1:29:01] can see here in this bible you've got
[1:29:03] one two three four
[1:29:04] five uh i didn't turn the page but i'll
[1:29:07] get to it a minute
[1:29:08] but if you go in yourself you go all the
[1:29:10] way to the end of chapter 6 verse 17
[1:29:13] is the end of the the sixth seal and
[1:29:16] then you go to chapter seven
[1:29:17] that's not the seventh seal chapter
[1:29:19] seven is a gap that's inserted and you
[1:29:21] don't come to the seventh seal till you
[1:29:22] get to chapter eight verse
[1:29:24] one now we all know this but i just
[1:29:26] wanna show this because there's gaps
[1:29:27] here and all the gaps
[1:29:29] correlate that's the important part of
[1:29:30] what we're gonna talk about today
[1:29:32] there's gaps here and all the gaps
[1:29:34] correlate
[1:29:36] praise god i don't even know how to say
[1:29:38] it right but praise god anyhow
[1:29:42] and tonight we have started on the
[1:29:44] subject of the breach between the seven
[1:29:45] church age and seven seals
[1:29:47] i was just speaking this afternoon to a
[1:29:48] friend and maybe the lord willing
[1:29:50] sometime this summer
[1:29:51] if it doesn't take me home or i get or i
[1:29:54] get to come back
[1:29:54] don't go overseas or something i'd like
[1:29:56] to strike again at the seven last
[1:29:58] trumpets
[1:29:59] and it all bridges together and then
[1:30:01] there's the seven last plagues and it
[1:30:03] all blends right together
[1:30:05] as we'll see as we go along so brother
[1:30:08] branham's saying
[1:30:08] you know the the seals and the trumpets
[1:30:11] and the vials
[1:30:12] they all blend together amen as we go
[1:30:14] along
[1:30:15] and it looks like when he gets to defeat
[1:30:17] the trumpet he says something different
[1:30:18] but he doesn't say anything different
[1:30:20] and we'll look at that in the second
[1:30:23] seal says all right now notice 17th
[1:30:25] chapter of revelation
[1:30:26] now everybody just try to open your
[1:30:28] heart and let the holy spirit teach you
[1:30:30] now
[1:30:31] they're coming to me one of the seven
[1:30:32] angels which had the i had the seven
[1:30:34] vials
[1:30:35] now you see there's seven vials you know
[1:30:37] these sevens as we are going through
[1:30:39] they all happen right at the same time
[1:30:42] following the plagues following the
[1:30:44] church ages just the same
[1:30:45] because it's all sealed up into that one
[1:30:47] book everything and everything happens
[1:30:50] just in rotation one goes right into the
[1:30:52] other
[1:30:52] and the other and to the other there's
[1:30:54] two spirits of working
[1:30:56] god in the devil so brother i'm saying
[1:30:58] these trumpets and these vials and seals
[1:31:00] one rolls right into the other which is
[1:31:02] what he said at the beginning of the
[1:31:04] church age book
[1:31:05] as is the initial illumination of the
[1:31:07] seals because out of the seals come
[1:31:09] out of the church ages come the seals
[1:31:11] out of the church they just come to
[1:31:12] trump it's how the trump has come the
[1:31:14] viles
[1:31:15] now don't worry i'm not going to try to
[1:31:17] explain them all because i don't know
[1:31:18] what they all mean that's not the point
[1:31:19] i'm just looking at the gap in the
[1:31:21] correlation of the gap
[1:31:23] there are still i still have a billion
[1:31:25] questions
[1:31:26] and when we get done with this you'll
[1:31:27] say brother chad what about this the
[1:31:29] third seal says this
[1:31:30] i don't either the third vial i have no
[1:31:32] idea i don't know
[1:31:33] i'm just going to show you something i'm
[1:31:35] seeing and i trust
[1:31:37] that if we have enough courage to step
[1:31:38] into what we're seeing and say that's
[1:31:40] the truth that's what the prophet said
[1:31:42] praise god maybe that lantern will shine
[1:31:44] a little more but i
[1:31:45] i'm still loaded down with questions
[1:31:47] friend about the vials and about the
[1:31:49] trump still
[1:31:50] loaded down with the questions but
[1:31:52] praise god there's something here that i
[1:31:54] see that i knows the truth and i'm not
[1:31:58] the first person to see it many of you
[1:31:59] have seen it too but this is exciting
[1:32:00] for me
[1:32:01] so just when you guys who have done this
[1:32:03] for a while and you've seen this you say
[1:32:04] yeah i see it just
[1:32:05] say god bless you god bless him
[1:32:09] he's getting excited god bless him
[1:32:13] amen 1965 of thinking man's filter
[1:32:16] said and i'm anxious this is 1965.
[1:32:18] august is 65.
[1:32:20] this is after he preaches feast of
[1:32:21] trumpets he said i'm anxiously waiting
[1:32:23] for the hour
[1:32:24] to where we can all congregate in one
[1:32:26] place and preach on those seven plagues
[1:32:29] the seven vials and the trumpets and so
[1:32:30] forth they all happen
[1:32:32] right in a cluster that's the reason it
[1:32:35] will take us about a week
[1:32:36] ten days or more to get through it in
[1:32:38] one single meeting
[1:32:40] if we can so brother branham he comes to
[1:32:43] preach the feast of trumpets
[1:32:44] many of you know this and he wants to
[1:32:46] preach the trumpets and he wants to do
[1:32:47] it the same way he did the seals he
[1:32:49] didn't want to think about it he just
[1:32:50] wanted to set the meeting he wanted to
[1:32:51] come each day and have god reveal to him
[1:32:54] each trumpet one by one amen and
[1:32:56] something wasn't right they couldn't get
[1:32:57] the venue he wasn't feeling right so he
[1:32:59] went into prayer
[1:33:00] and god told him you're not to preach
[1:33:02] that it's not for you it's not for the
[1:33:03] gentiles it's for the jews
[1:33:05] he said you already preached it under
[1:33:07] the seals
[1:33:08] supernaturally we may get to that quote
[1:33:10] we may not but anyways you know you're
[1:33:12] familiar with that
[1:33:13] so you would think that brother branham
[1:33:14] said well we'll just leave that alone
[1:33:16] but now he goes past the trumpets to the
[1:33:19] vials
[1:33:19] to the plagues and he says now he's he's
[1:33:22] at the end of his ministry he preached
[1:33:24] in
[1:33:25] feast of trumpets in july of 1964. here
[1:33:28] he's a year later
[1:33:29] and he wants to set up meetings for the
[1:33:30] plagues for the vials
[1:33:33] he'd be like you were just told don't do
[1:33:35] it for the trumpets what makes you can
[1:33:37] do it for the viles
[1:33:38] because brother branham is seeing
[1:33:40] something he's seeing something
[1:33:42] and he's he wants to preach on those
[1:33:44] seven plagues the vials
[1:33:45] and the trumpets and the trumpets and so
[1:33:48] forth i wish he would have mentioned the
[1:33:51] so forth
[1:33:55] he does that all the time
[1:33:58] when she begins to say i am my father
[1:34:01] one and them other things the shuck
[1:34:02] begins to pull away
[1:34:04] i would wish he left a list of them
[1:34:06] other things
[1:34:07] because that's exactly what i would go
[1:34:08] down saying preaching every week
[1:34:12] praise be to god and the trumpets
[1:34:15] forward they all happen
[1:34:16] right in a cluster see for my old
[1:34:19] denominational thinking
[1:34:20] i couldn't think this all happens in a
[1:34:22] cluster because one happens to the
[1:34:23] gentiles and then
[1:34:24] much later trumpets happen to the jews
[1:34:27] and then
[1:34:28] after that then in tribulation period
[1:34:30] you have something happen in the vials
[1:34:32] and that may very well be
[1:34:34] the natural part of it but brother
[1:34:35] branham says they all happen in a
[1:34:37] cluster
[1:34:38] and i'll tell you the cluster they
[1:34:40] happen in
[1:34:41] they happen under the seventh seal the
[1:34:44] end time sign the wrapping up of
[1:34:45] everything
[1:34:46] that's the cluster where they all happen
[1:34:49] right in that
[1:34:50] revelation of the seventh seal the end
[1:34:52] time sign that finishes everything
[1:34:55] that's the cluster of all of this but
[1:34:57] let's just take a look at this maybe for
[1:34:59] a minute
[1:35:01] i have no idea okay praise the lord
[1:35:05] brother ben said in the feast of
[1:35:08] trumpets
[1:35:09] he said the gathering of israel is the
[1:35:11] trumpets the trumpets is to gather
[1:35:13] israel notice the very first trumpet
[1:35:15] sound
[1:35:16] blood fire hail and everything scattered
[1:35:18] the ground seeing what was he doing
[1:35:19] bringing israel out of spiritual egypt
[1:35:21] see back into his homeland
[1:35:24] so brother branham is now telling us
[1:35:26] it's not for the gentiles
[1:35:28] at all it doesn't mean there's nothing
[1:35:29] in there that pertains to us
[1:35:31] it means the revelation of it's not for
[1:35:33] us it the trumpets were the gathering of
[1:35:35] israel back to the homeland
[1:35:37] that's the purpose of the trumpets
[1:35:40] so the trumpet does for the jews what
[1:35:43] the seals did for the gentiles
[1:35:47] so so now we look here at the seals
[1:35:50] there's a gap now
[1:35:51] between the sixth and seventh seal i
[1:35:54] think this is really important
[1:35:56] that we see this because it's here for a
[1:35:58] reason
[1:35:59] when you go one two three four five six
[1:36:02] a gap then you come to the seventh
[1:36:04] huh that's interesting why don't you
[1:36:05] just list all seven
[1:36:07] because when you find you get to the
[1:36:09] trumpets the same thing happens and when
[1:36:10] you get to the vile
[1:36:11] the same thing happens why is this cycle
[1:36:14] repeated
[1:36:15] i think it's to draw our attention to
[1:36:16] something and the things brother branham
[1:36:18] said about what happens in the gap
[1:36:22] then we go after the seals we go to the
[1:36:25] trumpets
[1:36:26] right after the seventh trumpet we have
[1:36:29] one two three four
[1:36:29] five we have six
[1:36:33] seven and in between
[1:36:37] the gap between the sixth and seventh
[1:36:39] trumpet
[1:36:41] so there's in your bible the way your
[1:36:44] bible is constructed
[1:36:46] when you come to the sixth seal it
[1:36:49] doesn't immediately go to the seventh
[1:36:51] seal
[1:36:52] but i'll say it this way under the sixth
[1:36:55] seal
[1:36:57] is chapter seven
[1:37:01] in chapter seven is the ceiling of the
[1:37:02] 144 thousand
[1:37:04] and it's the purging of the foolish
[1:37:06] virgin so brother brahman says in the
[1:37:07] seventh seal
[1:37:09] and then after that you go to the
[1:37:10] seventh seal
[1:37:12] why why don't you just list all seven
[1:37:15] and then put what happens to the
[1:37:17] foolish version or what happens to the
[1:37:18] fullest version into the
[1:37:20] uh the 144 thousand why don't you just
[1:37:22] put it after the seals
[1:37:23] i mean if i was writing the book that's
[1:37:25] the way i would do it
[1:37:26] keep your subjects together
[1:37:31] then let's let's let's look here the
[1:37:34] rest of chapter 8 starting chapter 8
[1:37:37] verse 2
[1:37:38] all the way through the bottom of
[1:37:39] chapter 9 verse 21
[1:37:43] is six trumpets but then
[1:37:46] revelations chapter 10 and chapter 11
[1:37:50] is injected and you don't get the
[1:37:52] seventh trumpet
[1:37:53] until you get down to chapter to verse
[1:37:55] 15.
[1:37:57] it's the same exact pattern
[1:38:02] it's not the way i would have written it
[1:38:03] i'd put all seven seals here
[1:38:06] any other information here all seven
[1:38:08] trumpets here
[1:38:10] any other information here
[1:38:13] and then let's turn over to chapter 16.
[1:38:16] and get to the viles chapter 16 verse 1
[1:38:21] you read the six vials from chapter 16
[1:38:24] verse 1.
[1:38:25] all the way down to chapter 16 verse 12
[1:38:28] is six vials chapter 12 is the sixth
[1:38:30] viral then chapter 13 through 16
[1:38:33] is another gap something's told in the
[1:38:36] gap
[1:38:37] and then you pick it up in 17 and the
[1:38:40] seventh angel poured out his vile
[1:38:42] it's the same pattern do we see that do
[1:38:45] we all agree
[1:38:46] in your bible there's a same pattern
[1:38:48] that there's a gap between the sixth and
[1:38:50] seventh seal
[1:38:51] there's a gap between the sixth and
[1:38:52] seventh trumpet and there's a gap
[1:38:54] between the sixth and seventh vial
[1:38:57] i don't know about you but my next
[1:38:58] question is why
[1:39:01] why my intellect wouldn't allow me to
[1:39:04] write it that way
[1:39:05] but god's knowledge foreknowledge wrote
[1:39:07] it that way
[1:39:08] for a reason and there's something
[1:39:10] inside of me says i want to know why my
[1:39:13] father
[1:39:13] wrote it this way because you've got to
[1:39:16] read between the lines to catch it and
[1:39:17] he wrote it in such a way that you'll
[1:39:19] see it and your bible is actually
[1:39:20] constructed to show us something
[1:39:24] oh i'm going to see if i can hurry i
[1:39:25] want to get this to you i i'm not going
[1:39:27] to dig down to the details there's a
[1:39:28] bazillion details and i love
[1:39:30] every little one of them and maybe we'll
[1:39:31] get together and i'll draw it out on a
[1:39:33] napkin and we'll go through hours and
[1:39:35] hours in little details because i like
[1:39:36] them all
[1:39:37] or maybe we'll revisit this subject
[1:39:39] again and again and again that sounds
[1:39:40] good to me too
[1:39:42] until we understand what we're looking
[1:39:43] at because for me
[1:39:45] this is not anything new it's laying in
[1:39:46] the message been there all the time but
[1:39:48] to me i'm finally starting to see what
[1:39:49] brother branham was talking about and i
[1:39:51] just want to keep looking at it and keep
[1:39:52] looking at it and keep looking
[1:39:54] at it and say god reveal to me exactly i
[1:39:56] want to i want to know what he saw
[1:39:58] and i want to know what he understood
[1:39:59] when he saw it and when he made a phrase
[1:40:01] and he made a statement that doesn't fit
[1:40:02] i wonder why did he say it that way
[1:40:04] why is it worded that way it doesn't
[1:40:05] make sense to anything else i understand
[1:40:07] but he clearly says it this way multiple
[1:40:10] times
[1:40:11] if he does there's a reason god showed
[1:40:12] me that reason
[1:40:15] so i'm going to try to just give an
[1:40:16] overview of this subject if i can god
[1:40:19] help us
[1:40:19] i want to i'm just going to look at this
[1:40:23] gap here
[1:40:24] in the feast of trumpets he says now let
[1:40:26] me say this right here that
[1:40:27] every trumpet that blowed blowed under
[1:40:29] the sixth seal
[1:40:31] we'll get to that in a few minutes where
[1:40:33] we caught the seal there
[1:40:35] all the trumpets sounded under the sixth
[1:40:37] seal
[1:40:38] now if you're going in chronological
[1:40:41] order
[1:40:42] your brain is going to sizzle and fry
[1:40:43] right now
[1:40:45] and if you and i have our old baptist or
[1:40:47] pentecostal understanding of this
[1:40:49] are what brother branham's going to say
[1:40:51] next is going to short-circuit our fuses
[1:40:55] because we think the seals are to the
[1:40:57] gentiles
[1:40:58] the trumpets are to the to the jews and
[1:41:01] then the vials are poured out during the
[1:41:03] three and a half year tribulation period
[1:41:04] and then we go i'm gonna study all this
[1:41:06] and all of a sudden brother branham is
[1:41:08] gonna say some things
[1:41:09] that are gonna take that picture and
[1:41:11] gonna gonna
[1:41:13] blow your circuits and then you're gonna
[1:41:16] say
[1:41:16] what do i believe and where did i get my
[1:41:20] belief
[1:41:23] now when i say this i want to preface
[1:41:25] this by saying
[1:41:26] all scripture has a compound meaning and
[1:41:29] a compound revelation
[1:41:31] and a compound fulfillment so just
[1:41:34] because brotherhood says it this way we
[1:41:35] look at it this way
[1:41:36] doesn't mean there won't be physical
[1:41:38] aspects and i'll take for instance the
[1:41:40] stone that was cut out of the mountain
[1:41:41] of hands and smote the
[1:41:42] defeat we've seen that happen do you
[1:41:45] believe you've seen that happen
[1:41:47] the catholic church all the protestants
[1:41:48] haven't been smoking have been ground to
[1:41:50] powder amen you've been freed from that
[1:41:52] now it's growing into a mountain
[1:41:53] but i believe and i may be wrong
[1:41:57] but i believe we'll see that same thing
[1:41:59] happen in a physical way when the
[1:42:01] kingdoms of the world are physically
[1:42:02] destroyed
[1:42:04] and the kingdom of christ is set upon
[1:42:05] the earth
[1:42:07] and i say it carefully this way and
[1:42:09] there's a reason i say it and i want to
[1:42:10] go slow
[1:42:11] because i get excited on this subject
[1:42:13] and i can just dance all over this
[1:42:14] platform and pace back and forth and
[1:42:16] preach it because i'm so excited about
[1:42:17] it
[1:42:19] because i think that they'll come a
[1:42:23] physical
[1:42:25] smiting and destroying of all the
[1:42:26] kingdoms of the earth i see it in
[1:42:28] scripture i see it
[1:42:29] i think it'll happen and that the
[1:42:31] kingdom of christ will be built
[1:42:34] but i'm so absolutely confident of the
[1:42:36] spiritual i know that's right
[1:42:39] i know that's right i know in the days
[1:42:42] of those 10 kings that brother branham
[1:42:43] pointed to and showed those those 10
[1:42:44] kings that there was a stone cut out of
[1:42:46] the mouth
[1:42:47] and that stone has become my capstone my
[1:42:49] headstone but it's come to destroy the
[1:42:51] works of the catholic church
[1:42:54] i'm so confident of that i'm not so sure
[1:42:56] about the other
[1:42:57] it looks like it i believe it i believe
[1:43:00] it's there i believe it unfold but i'm
[1:43:01] so sure that i know this
[1:43:03] see before our mind has always been
[1:43:05] opposite i've been
[1:43:06] sure and the physical because i was
[1:43:09] taught that as a baptist or a
[1:43:11] pentecostal
[1:43:12] i've been so sure of that that i'm
[1:43:14] wondering isn't there a spiritual
[1:43:15] application could it be spiritually
[1:43:17] fulfilled also
[1:43:18] but now by the revelation of jesus
[1:43:20] christ that come through a prophet
[1:43:21] i'm so confident of the spiritual
[1:43:23] fulfillment of that word in daniel
[1:43:25] that i believe that there'll be a
[1:43:27] physical
[1:43:28] knowing that i could be wrong but i know
[1:43:31] it's already been fulfilled spiritually
[1:43:33] in the bride
[1:43:35] does that make sense to you everything
[1:43:38] in me is changing friends
[1:43:40] not changing like new religion knew this
[1:43:43] changing in a way that
[1:43:44] i finally feel like i understand why
[1:43:47] brother branham said what he said
[1:43:49] and before i'd read through feast of
[1:43:50] trumpets and just you know
[1:43:52] keep reading got that book done
[1:43:56] what did he mean by this what do you
[1:43:57] mean by that i you know
[1:44:00] was it good it was good is it the truth
[1:44:03] every word's the truth what's it mean
[1:44:10] don't ask me too many questions but
[1:44:13] we've had lots of places in the message
[1:44:15] like that
[1:44:16] we've read we've pondered over he says
[1:44:17] it in a certain way amen and i believe
[1:44:19] every bit of it's the truth
[1:44:21] he'll take two statements that look to
[1:44:23] be totally contrary
[1:44:24] totally a polar opposite contrary to one
[1:44:26] another and put him together
[1:44:28] what's he mean i don't know but i am not
[1:44:30] going to go any meanie mining mode take
[1:44:32] that one
[1:44:33] i just say he knows what he's talking
[1:44:34] about he knows what he's looking at
[1:44:36] when i see what he sees it'll make sense
[1:44:38] to me i'm willing to say i don't
[1:44:40] understand
[1:44:41] but when god by revelation opens up new
[1:44:44] territory and you see what the prophet
[1:44:46] saw
[1:44:46] amen you can walk forward in that even
[1:44:48] if you can't answer all the questions
[1:44:51] [Applause]
[1:44:55] they asked brother ben questions about
[1:44:57] the millennium there's a question he
[1:44:58] says
[1:45:00] um he says i don't know some places it
[1:45:03] looks like yes in some places it looks
[1:45:04] like no
[1:45:08] praise god i like that
[1:45:12] so all trumpets sounded under the sixth
[1:45:15] seal
[1:45:17] but brother branham said that these
[1:45:19] trumpets
[1:45:21] will be the ministry of the two prophets
[1:45:23] in revelations 11
[1:45:25] moses and elijah and their prophecy
[1:45:27] their ministry won't start till the
[1:45:28] bride is out of the way
[1:45:30] right there and a physical rapture in a
[1:45:32] physical translation
[1:45:34] the bride is off the scene and those two
[1:45:36] prophets begin to minister
[1:45:37] and they bring the revelation of the
[1:45:39] trumpets is that right
[1:45:42] so so so
[1:45:46] so is the seventh seal open
[1:45:54] and they can't bring the
[1:45:57] or the revelation of the trumpets until
[1:45:59] after the bride is gone
[1:46:01] that's part of the seventh seal
[1:46:06] but everyone sounded under the sixth
[1:46:10] seal
[1:46:15] you see what i mean i want to draw
[1:46:18] something else
[1:46:19] we're not going to get very far is that
[1:46:20] okay i just
[1:46:23] i want to teach i love teaching and i
[1:46:25] preach too much
[1:46:31] you know the feast of the lord the seven
[1:46:34] feasts of the lord
[1:46:35] are a redemption cycle we believe that
[1:46:39] i'm just going to
[1:46:40] i'm just interjecting something so just
[1:46:42] pay attention to this for a minute
[1:46:44] you have seven feasts uh
[1:46:49] these are the feast of
[1:46:52] the lord and i hope i don't spell like
[1:46:55] lord or jesus or anything if i misspell
[1:46:57] that
[1:46:58] you're gonna kick me out but anything's
[1:47:06] possible
[1:47:09] so i'm going to write it like this
[1:47:14] in the physical fulfillment of the
[1:47:17] redemption side i shouldn't say physical
[1:47:19] it's physical
[1:47:19] spiritual you know i don't have words
[1:47:22] enough to explain this
[1:47:24] but i'm just gonna explain what i'm
[1:47:25] seeing and bear with me and hopefully
[1:47:26] you can see it
[1:47:28] and the day that jesus christ was here
[1:47:30] he was the first fruits
[1:47:32] right and and he was crucified he was
[1:47:35] taken and he was crucified as the
[1:47:37] passover lamb
[1:47:38] and and you go from passover
[1:47:41] to feast of unleavened bread
[1:47:44] to first fruits right so
[1:47:48] so you have these seven
[1:47:51] feasts i didn't plan on doing this
[1:47:55] so if i get run wrong just say hey you
[1:47:57] got that in the wrong spot you won't
[1:47:59] hurt my feelings
[1:48:02] passover
[1:48:04] unleavened bread
[1:48:12] first fruits
[1:48:16] pentecost
[1:48:19] trumpets
[1:48:23] atonement
[1:48:28] and tabernacles
[1:48:36] my penmanship is going downhill
[1:48:39] so so we have these feasts now when
[1:48:42] jesus christ came he came to who who did
[1:48:45] he come
[1:48:46] to the jews is that right he came to the
[1:48:49] jews
[1:48:50] and when he came to the jews he came as
[1:48:51] the passover lamb
[1:48:53] and he became the passover for the whole
[1:48:54] world but he came in his first ministry
[1:48:57] to the jews
[1:48:58] and he was their passover land then
[1:49:02] he became jesus himself became the feast
[1:49:05] of unleavened bread because you had
[1:49:06] unleavened bread for seven days brother
[1:49:07] i'm saying showing in the seven church
[1:49:09] ages there was going to be no leaven
[1:49:11] there's going to be pure word in all of
[1:49:12] it
[1:49:13] mixed in with man's ideas but there's
[1:49:14] going to be a strain of christ that goes
[1:49:16] through the seven church ages
[1:49:18] and then there's going to be the first
[1:49:19] the first fruits the first part to come
[1:49:21] to harvest
[1:49:22] will be taken and waived before the lord
[1:49:24] and way before the congregation
[1:49:25] and so now you have jesus death burial
[1:49:29] and resurrection in your first three
[1:49:30] feasts
[1:49:32] you got that then
[1:49:35] then 50 days later that's what pentecost
[1:49:38] means 50 50 days later or
[1:49:40] seven sabbaths later typing the seven
[1:49:42] church ages
[1:49:43] amen he comes to the feast of pentecost
[1:49:45] and in the feast of pentecost there's
[1:49:47] another wave there's wave loaves and now
[1:49:49] what was what was the grain that
[1:49:51] resurrected is now baked into the loaf
[1:49:53] or baked into the church and leaven's
[1:49:56] mixed in with it because we're still in
[1:49:57] hybrid conditions so now we're in the
[1:49:59] feast of pentecost
[1:50:00] and brother branham when it comes to
[1:50:01] feast of trump and say that's been that
[1:50:03] long
[1:50:04] gap between the resurrection of jesus
[1:50:07] christ
[1:50:08] and the feast of trumpets all three of
[1:50:10] these take place
[1:50:12] in the first month right
[1:50:15] and these all take place in the seventh
[1:50:17] month
[1:50:20] see that and in between the first month
[1:50:23] and seven
[1:50:24] months because after that comes the
[1:50:25] first church age to the seventh church
[1:50:26] age
[1:50:27] the long gap in between has been the
[1:50:29] feast of pentecost
[1:50:31] which has been the son of god the the
[1:50:34] resurrection the first fruits
[1:50:35] baked into the loaf so we understand
[1:50:38] that
[1:50:39] is that clear because brother graham
[1:50:42] says some things that's going to blow
[1:50:43] our mind about these feasts
[1:50:46] and there's just one point that i want
[1:50:48] to get to and i just don't want to
[1:50:49] belabor this but pray for me
[1:50:52] so when it comes to the jews when it
[1:50:54] comes to the cycle of redemption
[1:50:56] we've had passover jesus christ
[1:50:58] crucified unleavened bread
[1:51:00] that's that's a strain of pure word
[1:51:02] unleavened going through the church ages
[1:51:04] the first fruits he was the resurrected
[1:51:05] jesus christ
[1:51:07] then that first fruit gets baked into
[1:51:09] the loaf because pentecost has two wave
[1:51:11] loaves
[1:51:12] and it becomes christ in the church for
[1:51:14] seven church ages
[1:51:15] a long gap here is the seven church ages
[1:51:24] and then at the end of the seven church
[1:51:27] ages
[1:51:28] he turns back to the jews in the feast
[1:51:31] of trumpets
[1:51:35] and that's what brother bran's preaching
[1:51:36] and feast of trumpets and the purpose of
[1:51:39] the trumpets
[1:51:40] is to show them like the seals how god
[1:51:44] has been doing
[1:51:44] where he's been redeeming how he's
[1:51:46] brought them through how they got
[1:51:48] back how they were scout why they were
[1:51:49] scattered how they got back to the
[1:51:50] promised land and and reveals to them
[1:51:54] the their seventh trumpet which brother
[1:51:55] bram says the seventh trumpet to them is
[1:51:57] the same as the seventh seal to us
[1:51:59] which is what the revelation of jesus
[1:52:01] christ which brings them to the feast of
[1:52:03] atonement
[1:52:04] they recognize jesus christ the lamb
[1:52:07] that atoned for them
[1:52:08] and they recognized they missed it and
[1:52:10] now the feast of atonement becomes a
[1:52:12] feast of morning
[1:52:13] where everyone separates into his own
[1:52:15] home and mourns as though they lost
[1:52:16] their firstborn son
[1:52:18] and they say how could we have missed it
[1:52:20] that was him back there and we've missed
[1:52:22] it for these 2 thousand years
[1:52:25] and then that will bring the 144 000 to
[1:52:28] the jews
[1:52:29] and to the feast of tabernacles where
[1:52:31] christ will be with them
[1:52:34] and then bring them over into the
[1:52:35] millennium do we understand that cycle
[1:52:39] brother branham takes the same cycle
[1:52:41] these feasts
[1:52:42] he does something strange for the church
[1:52:45] he says
[1:52:46] in the seventh church age
[1:52:53] he said we are feasting now
[1:52:56] under the feast of tabernacles
[1:53:03] we are feasting now under the feast of
[1:53:06] tabernacles
[1:53:06] the seventh church age brother branham
[1:53:09] takes the seventh church age
[1:53:12] and the feast of tabernacles and puts
[1:53:14] them together
[1:53:15] because christ is dwelling in you
[1:53:18] he's come back in fullness under the
[1:53:20] feast of tabernacles
[1:53:22] why we've been introduced to the
[1:53:24] atonement he says we've been taken
[1:53:26] back to the old atonement the original
[1:53:28] word which bled for us and died for us
[1:53:30] and was given to us through the ministry
[1:53:32] of the apostles and prophets and was
[1:53:34] lost to the church ages
[1:53:35] now the messenger comes and he brings us
[1:53:37] back to that to recognize
[1:53:39] our atonement the bleeding bloody word
[1:53:43] and christ comes and lives and dwells in
[1:53:45] his bride in fullness and down becomes
[1:53:47] the feast of tabernacles in the seventh
[1:53:52] church
[1:53:54] so the jews are coming under the feast
[1:53:57] of trumpets
[1:53:59] number five and we're already over here
[1:54:01] in number seven
[1:54:03] this is the thing that i want to get in
[1:54:05] our head not everything that's redeemed
[1:54:07] has to be on the same timetable
[1:54:10] the jews can be into the fifth feast and
[1:54:13] we can be in the seventh feast
[1:54:15] at the same time and if we don't allow
[1:54:18] that we'll never
[1:54:19] understand what brother branham's saying
[1:54:21] we're going to be completely twisted up
[1:54:22] and confused
[1:54:23] why what we're under he says now we're
[1:54:26] under the
[1:54:26] the set we're we're under the seventh
[1:54:29] what is the seventh feast
[1:54:30] we're feasting under the feast of
[1:54:32] tabernacles the seventh church age
[1:54:33] that's why people started preaching were
[1:54:35] in the millennium
[1:54:37] why because brother branham says
[1:54:41] there's been six thousand years since
[1:54:43] the fall
[1:54:45] what fell when adam fell amen the earth
[1:54:48] also fell and the earth is an attribute
[1:54:51] of jehovah an attribute of god
[1:54:53] and so that earth has to be redeemed too
[1:54:56] so he's got to redeem
[1:54:57] gentiles he's got to redeem jews and
[1:55:00] he's got to redeem the earth
[1:55:03] but they don't all have to be on the
[1:55:05] same schedule
[1:55:07] and if we try to make them on the same
[1:55:08] schedule then we start preaching
[1:55:10] doctrine like we're already in the
[1:55:11] millennium because brother branham said
[1:55:12] we're feasting under the feast of
[1:55:14] tabernacles
[1:55:15] because brother branham clearly says in
[1:55:17] the millennium
[1:55:18] will be in the feast of tabernacles
[1:55:21] why does he say that he says because
[1:55:23] there's been six
[1:55:24] thousand years since the fall
[1:55:28] but that seventh one
[1:55:32] is the millennium and i'm not even going
[1:55:34] to spell it
[1:55:35] i'm not even going to try i can never
[1:55:37] spell millennium too many n's and too
[1:55:39] many l's
[1:55:42] and when he says when you get to that
[1:55:44] seventh thousand
[1:55:45] year he says now the
[1:55:48] earth is under the feast of tabernacles
[1:55:55] so we have a different
[1:55:59] schedule for the gentiles
[1:56:03] for the jews and for the earth
[1:56:06] and if we'll just allow that to be true
[1:56:08] and go back
[1:56:09] and read feast the trumpets and go back
[1:56:11] and read future home
[1:56:12] and all these other all the sun's like
[1:56:14] click click click click click
[1:56:16] that's what he's talking about because i
[1:56:18] don't know if we're in the millennium or
[1:56:19] we're not in the millennium
[1:56:20] is it the seventh age are we there's a
[1:56:22] feast of trump it's when did
[1:56:25] praise be to god everybody the earth can
[1:56:27] be in the
[1:56:28] sixth under the sixth feast
[1:56:31] under atonement because the blood
[1:56:33] dropped on it amen because the earth was
[1:56:34] redeemed the way we were redeemed
[1:56:36] first the water comes and washes it away
[1:56:38] then the blood comes and spills on it
[1:56:40] amen and then
[1:56:41] now christ and his bride comes and
[1:56:43] dwells in harmony on the earth
[1:56:44] what have you got now you go to the
[1:56:46] feast of atonement the blood dropping on
[1:56:48] we're
[1:56:49] under the feast of atonement we're in
[1:56:50] the 6 000 year
[1:56:52] and i know it doesn't matter years i
[1:56:54] know it's not a thousand each one but
[1:56:55] just listen to what i'm
[1:56:56] saying we're under the feast of
[1:56:58] atonement and getting ready to move in
[1:56:59] the feast of tabernacles where we all
[1:57:01] have glorified bodies and lived together
[1:57:02] with jesus christ
[1:57:03] and a glorified body on this earth for a
[1:57:05] thousand years
[1:57:06] and he calls that the feast of
[1:57:08] tabernacles
[1:57:10] but he says we're feasting now in the
[1:57:12] feast of tabernacles
[1:57:13] so is the millennium started now or does
[1:57:15] the millennium start
[1:57:16] after the rapture the three and a half
[1:57:18] year tribulation he says
[1:57:20] both because now the gentile bride has
[1:57:23] spiritually moved to the feast of
[1:57:24] tabernacles
[1:57:25] because all that was in christ is god is
[1:57:27] important to christ
[1:57:28] and all that was in christ has been
[1:57:30] poured into the church and now it's the
[1:57:31] feast of tabernacles
[1:57:34] because she recognized her atonement
[1:57:36] which was the bleeding bloody word
[1:57:39] amen and now the jews under the feast of
[1:57:43] trumpets
[1:57:44] they've got to have two prophets that
[1:57:46] show up and reveal to them what the
[1:57:48] trumpets have been all about and why
[1:57:50] they were rejected and why they were
[1:57:51] scattered and why they were regathered
[1:57:53] and what they missed 2 000 years ago and
[1:57:56] that seventh trumpet
[1:57:57] is the introduction amen what are those
[1:57:59] two prophets doing
[1:58:00] they're standing in the breach amen to
[1:58:03] connect the jews
[1:58:04] to the atonement which is jesus christ
[1:58:07] the slain lamb
[1:58:08] they're doing the same thing our prophet
[1:58:10] did for us to stand in the breach
[1:58:12] and now two prophets come and stand in
[1:58:13] the breach and say you missed it this is
[1:58:16] the atonement
[1:58:20] praise be to god
[1:58:27] and then they recognize in the feast of
[1:58:29] mourning that was him
[1:58:31] they recognized joseph
[1:58:34] right joseph reveals himself to them
[1:58:38] where is the bride at the time of
[1:58:39] joseph's revealing the bride's already
[1:58:41] in heaven brother ben said already put
[1:58:42] away
[1:58:43] in the in the heaven and the temple and
[1:58:46] he reveals himself to his brother
[1:58:49] and they begin to mourn and cry is that
[1:58:51] what happens
[1:58:52] in genesis they begin the morning christ
[1:58:55] and now he'll slay us for we've treated
[1:58:56] him so bad
[1:58:57] he says you meant it for evil but god
[1:58:59] meant it for good that's
[1:59:00] not a neat phrase amen given to joseph
[1:59:03] joseph is playing the part of christ
[1:59:05] revealing himself in the end time under
[1:59:07] a ministry of two prophets to reveal
[1:59:09] himself to his brother
[1:59:11] those two prophets are to connect them
[1:59:13] through the six seals
[1:59:14] what did the six trumpets do the six
[1:59:16] trumpets reveal the whole program to the
[1:59:19] jews from the time of christ
[1:59:20] on is that right
[1:59:23] what's the seventh trumpet the one who
[1:59:26] orchestrated the program
[1:59:28] what's the six seals it's the revelation
[1:59:31] of how he's been redeeming a bride
[1:59:32] through seven church ages and the whole
[1:59:34] plan from the fall in the garden how he
[1:59:36] was going to have a bride and restore a
[1:59:37] bride from that fall
[1:59:39] till now amen that was under six seals
[1:59:41] what was the seventh seal
[1:59:42] the one who was interpreting the six
[1:59:46] what's the seventh trumpet the one who
[1:59:48] orchestrated the six
[1:59:51] praise be to god
[1:59:59] what do we say next i don't even know
[2:00:01] what to say next
[2:00:02] there's more and more this is just the
[2:00:04] tip of the iceberg more
[2:00:06] and more and more
[2:00:09] but we've got to allow
[2:00:13] ourselves to be on a different schedule
[2:00:17] than the jews i'm seeing a schedule of
[2:00:20] redemption and a different schedule than
[2:00:21] the earth
[2:00:23] and if we do that brother branham said
[2:00:25] we can feast now under the feast of
[2:00:26] tabernacles
[2:00:27] no problem he said in the millennium
[2:00:29] we'll be feasting under the feast of
[2:00:31] tabernacles
[2:00:32] no problem but the jews are getting
[2:00:35] ready
[2:00:35] amen to have the wrap-up of their feast
[2:00:37] of trumpets
[2:00:39] if we all have to be in the same spot at
[2:00:41] the same time none of that works
[2:00:48] brother branham didn't know what he was
[2:00:49] talking about he didn't stutter
[2:00:52] and he didn't make a mistake and the
[2:00:53] feast of trumpets makes
[2:00:55] sense i don't care what anybody sells
[2:00:58] says
[2:00:58] the feast of trumpets makes sense future
[2:01:00] home makes sense
[2:01:02] brother branham knew what he was saying
[2:01:04] he got it by divine revelation
[2:01:06] he said when i'm teaching now in the
[2:01:07] trumpets he says not mine my own
[2:01:09] whatever he said is the truth and he's
[2:01:11] the one who's always told me these
[2:01:12] things
[2:01:13] he said i didn't get it of my own mind
[2:01:15] brother graham's not confused he's not
[2:01:17] mixing anything up he knows exactly what
[2:01:19] he's talking about but
[2:01:20] the brother branham he doesn't have to
[2:01:22] have the gentiles the jews in the earth
[2:01:24] in the same place in redemption they can
[2:01:26] be spread out in different spots and
[2:01:27] redemption
[2:01:28] and with that understanding when we go
[2:01:30] back and read the word
[2:01:31] all of a sudden just click click click
[2:01:34] click
[2:01:37] he knows what he's talking about
[2:01:41] the gathering of the the gathering of
[2:01:43] israel
[2:01:44] is the trumpets you got that the
[2:01:47] gathering of
[2:01:47] israel is the trumpets notice the very
[2:01:50] first trumpet sound blood fire hail
[2:01:52] everything scattered the ground see
[2:01:53] what was he doing bringing israel out of
[2:01:56] spiritual egypt
[2:01:57] back into his homeland let's go to
[2:02:01] let's go let's go to chapter 8.
[2:02:08] brother remember goes to chapter 8 verse
[2:02:10] 2.
[2:02:12] it says and i saw the seven angels which
[2:02:15] stood before god
[2:02:16] and to them we're given seven trumpets
[2:02:19] another angel came and stood at the
[2:02:21] altar i'm gonna go on down to the
[2:02:22] trumpet
[2:02:23] let's go to the first trumpet verse
[2:02:25] seven
[2:02:26] and the first angel sounded and there
[2:02:28] followed hail and fire mingle with blood
[2:02:31] they were cast upon the earth and the
[2:02:32] third part of trees was burned up and
[2:02:34] all green grass was burned out
[2:02:35] brother branham goes right to this and
[2:02:37] he points out the hail the fire and the
[2:02:39] blood
[2:02:40] you see says see all those things that
[2:02:42] moses
[2:02:43] that moses called him out of egypt with
[2:02:46] he said see
[2:02:47] this is the calling them out of
[2:02:48] spiritual egypt
[2:02:50] and calling them back into their
[2:02:51] homeland that's what he says
[2:02:54] and he says the trumpets are the
[2:02:56] gathering of israel
[2:02:58] now this is going to make a lot of sense
[2:02:59] in a minute
[2:03:01] he says every trumpet sounded
[2:03:04] under the sixth seal under the
[2:03:06] persecution of the jews
[2:03:09] notice revelation now eight and
[2:03:11] beginning the seventh verse
[2:03:12] all that was calling out of israel
[2:03:14] natural in egypt now it's the calling
[2:03:16] out of israel in the spiritual sense
[2:03:18] he was taking them ready to come to the
[2:03:20] feast of atonement
[2:03:22] remember every trumpet sounded under the
[2:03:25] sixth seal only then when it sounded
[2:03:27] are we seeing the picture friends that
[2:03:30] brother branham
[2:03:31] he really means this this is the fourth
[2:03:33] or fifth time he says this
[2:03:35] he really means this that every trump
[2:03:37] sounded under the six seal only then
[2:03:39] when it sounded
[2:03:41] so remember all the trumpets sounded on
[2:03:43] the sixth seal
[2:03:44] the sixth seal finishes the mystery
[2:03:48] did you catch that the sixth steal
[2:03:51] finishes the mystery
[2:03:53] under the sixth seal just before the
[2:03:55] seventh is opened
[2:03:58] the sixth seal finishes the mystery
[2:04:01] that's been hit in the whole bible
[2:04:03] because the seventh
[2:04:05] is the whole bible the seventh seal
[2:04:09] is christ and christ
[2:04:12] is those seals that was revealed and
[2:04:15] christ
[2:04:16] is the book the bible
[2:04:19] brother i said i see this seventh seal
[2:04:21] all the way back in genesis i can see
[2:04:23] the seven seal
[2:04:24] coming up coming up why
[2:04:27] it was all the seventh seal it was all
[2:04:30] christ being made known
[2:04:31] it was all building the family of god
[2:04:36] so it was all revealed under the sixth
[2:04:38] seal the sixth seal finishes the mystery
[2:04:40] under the sixth hill just before the
[2:04:41] seventh is open
[2:04:45] he said luke 17 30
[2:04:49] and also malachi 4 hebrews 4 12 all
[2:04:52] these scriptures as promised
[2:04:53] this is to be between the 6 and 7 seal
[2:04:56] and the 6th and 7th trumpet
[2:05:00] catch that between the 6 and 7 seal
[2:05:04] and the 6th and 7th trumpet what's
[2:05:07] revealed
[2:05:09] luke 17 30 and malachi 4.
[2:05:21] all right can we look at the paper here
[2:05:23] brother franco
[2:05:36] between the sixth and seventh seal
[2:05:40] and the sixth and seventh trumpet
[2:05:50] brother branham's ministry
[2:05:55] is that what he said
[2:06:00] that means most of the trumpets are
[2:06:03] history
[2:06:09] we're looking for things to happen that
[2:06:11] have already happened
[2:06:15] that's why this gap is so important to
[2:06:18] understand
[2:06:19] will there be more happening in the
[2:06:20] future yes i'm sure will there be
[2:06:22] physical manifestation
[2:06:23] absolutely i believe that but what
[2:06:25] brother branham said
[2:06:26] is this ministry of luke 17 30 and
[2:06:28] malachi 4 comes between the 6th and 7th
[2:06:30] ceo
[2:06:31] and the 6th and 7th trumpet
[2:06:36] he says in recognizing your day and its
[2:06:38] message now at the end of these seven
[2:06:40] sabbaths which has been
[2:06:41] there is to be the day of atonement
[2:06:43] which was the seven trumpets
[2:06:45] and the seven trumpets was to call a day
[2:06:47] of mourning back to the sacrifice
[2:06:49] or the atonement for we find out then
[2:06:51] that israel the seven trumpets pertained
[2:06:53] only to israel and then why
[2:06:56] he wouldn't let me preach them seven
[2:06:58] trumpets i
[2:06:59] even was ready to announce it and had
[2:07:01] the halls ready and everything to go
[2:07:03] into
[2:07:04] to preach the seven trumpets there is
[2:07:06] something bothering me so bad i said
[2:07:08] keep
[2:07:09] we keep on working and billy and all of
[2:07:10] us trying to get everything ready for
[2:07:12] the air-conditioned building
[2:07:13] for this next coming week for the seven
[2:07:15] trumpets have ten days or eight days in
[2:07:18] the school auditorium but the holy
[2:07:19] spirit wouldn't let me do it for some
[2:07:21] reason
[2:07:21] and i wondered why and when i went in to
[2:07:24] pray i told the wife i'm going in
[2:07:26] and sincerely i knelt down before god to
[2:07:28] pray and he revealed to me that the
[2:07:30] seventh trumpet sounded under the sixth
[2:07:32] seal
[2:07:33] and i've done preached it supernaturally
[2:07:35] see
[2:07:36] it's the hand of god the whole thing it
[2:07:39] pertains to israel
[2:07:40] and we picked it up under the sixth seal
[2:07:42] you all who have that
[2:07:43] how the persecution of the jews and the
[2:07:45] time of the gentiles has been in the
[2:07:47] pentecostal feast
[2:07:49] the trumpets all of them was sounded
[2:07:51] under the sixth seal
[2:07:52] and we picked it up last sunday under
[2:07:54] the feast of trumpets if you all want to
[2:07:55] get it
[2:07:56] what was it to do to rush the jews from
[2:07:59] all parts of the world
[2:08:00] back into their homeland it must be
[2:08:03] there
[2:08:04] and the opening of the seals under the
[2:08:05] sixth seal the seventh trumpets sounded
[2:08:08] in the sixth seal now the seventh
[2:08:11] angel's message is to open the mystery
[2:08:13] of the seals
[2:08:14] calling the 11th hour gentile worker to
[2:08:15] receive the same pay that the first hour
[2:08:18] workers got he's trying to tell us
[2:08:21] something
[2:08:22] i want to look at one more thing and
[2:08:24] then we're going to close
[2:08:26] the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal
[2:08:29] sounds at the same time
[2:08:32] the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal
[2:08:34] sounds at the same time
[2:08:36] that can't be future
[2:08:40] do we understand because between the 6th
[2:08:42] and 7th seal
[2:08:43] and the 6th and 7th there's a prophet
[2:08:47] messenger luke 17 30 malachi 4 is
[2:08:49] fulfilled
[2:08:50] that can't be future that doesn't mean
[2:08:52] there's not it doesn't pertain to things
[2:08:54] in the future
[2:08:55] but it can't all be future and the sixth
[2:08:58] trump and the sixth seal sounds at the
[2:08:59] same time
[2:09:00] and between the sixth trumpet and the
[2:09:02] seventh trumpet there is a prophet
[2:09:04] to appear before the gentiles to call
[2:09:06] the people back to the original
[2:09:07] pentecostal doctrine
[2:09:09] and the two witnesses of revelation 11
[2:09:11] appear to the jews
[2:09:12] to send them to jesus while the church
[2:09:15] is being taken up
[2:09:21] praise god let's look at this
[2:09:25] revelation chapter 9.
[2:09:32] revelation chapter 9 verse 13
[2:09:37] the sixth angel sounded
[2:09:40] and i heard a voice from the four horns
[2:09:42] of the golden altar which is before god
[2:09:44] saying to the six
[2:09:46] to the sixth angel which had the trumpet
[2:09:47] loose the four angels which are bound in
[2:09:49] the great river euphrates
[2:09:51] the four angels were loosed which were
[2:09:53] prepared for an hour and a day and a
[2:09:54] month and a year
[2:09:55] for to slay the third part of men and
[2:09:58] the number of the army of the horsemen
[2:10:00] were two hundred thousand thousand and i
[2:10:02] heard the number of them
[2:10:03] and thus i saw the horses in the vision
[2:10:06] and then that sat on them having
[2:10:07] breastplates of fire
[2:10:09] adjacent and brimstone and the heads of
[2:10:11] the horses were as the heads of lions
[2:10:13] and out of their
[2:10:14] mouths issued fire smoke and brimstone
[2:10:18] by these there was the third part of men
[2:10:21] killed by the fire
[2:10:22] by the smoke by the brimstone which
[2:10:24] issued out of their mouth
[2:10:28] we're getting low on time and we don't
[2:10:29] want to get too tired and too many
[2:10:31] details i don't want to miss this but
[2:10:32] i'm gonna
[2:10:33] i'm gonna just write down one more thing
[2:10:35] and then we're gonna come back and we're
[2:10:37] gonna hit this again on wednesday lord
[2:10:38] willing
[2:10:40] if we could go to our overhead
[2:10:49] i don't know how to say this
[2:10:54] i'll just say it this way the three woes
[2:10:56] in the book of revelation
[2:10:58] are three world wars world war one
[2:11:02] world war ii and world war three
[2:11:05] so let's look at this in in chapter
[2:11:07] eight
[2:11:08] revelations 8 verse 13
[2:11:14] and i beheld and heard an angel flying
[2:11:16] through the midst of heaven saying with
[2:11:17] a loud voice
[2:11:18] woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the
[2:11:22] earth by reason of the other voices of
[2:11:23] the trumpet
[2:11:24] of the three angels which are yet to
[2:11:26] sound revelation chapter nine verse one
[2:11:29] the fifth angel sounded and it tells all
[2:11:30] the things that happened when the fifth
[2:11:32] angel sounded
[2:11:34] then at the bottom of that that chapter
[2:11:37] verse 12
[2:11:38] says one woe is past
[2:11:41] and behold there come two woes more
[2:11:44] hereafter
[2:11:46] so the fifth seal takes place at the
[2:11:48] time of the first world war
[2:11:51] which was 1918 it ended i think in 1918
[2:11:54] or something like that
[2:11:57] so you realize brother branham was here
[2:12:00] for the first two woes
[2:12:04] that's astounding two world wars the
[2:12:07] woes that are
[2:12:08] in the scripture right here the first
[2:12:11] one happened
[2:12:12] during his lifetime amen and the second
[2:12:14] one happened during his lifetime
[2:12:16] and after the second woe he entered his
[2:12:18] ministry
[2:12:20] now look it says after the the fifth
[2:12:22] trumpet sounds
[2:12:23] one woe is past and behold there come
[2:12:26] two woes
[2:12:27] more hereafter two more world wars and
[2:12:30] then we move into the sixth trumpet and
[2:12:32] the sixth trumpet talks about those
[2:12:34] those
[2:12:34] demons being released out of the river
[2:12:36] euphrates and brother branham said and
[2:12:38] we'll go through all of this wednesday
[2:12:39] but brother bram said
[2:12:40] where did they go they went into the
[2:12:41] armies of hitler mussolini
[2:12:44] and stalin to bring a persecution
[2:12:46] against the jews
[2:12:47] and the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet
[2:12:50] sounded at the same time
[2:12:52] which is what war world two
[2:12:55] world war two
[2:12:58] so world war ii started in 1939 or
[2:13:01] something
[2:13:02] like that i didn't check all these i may
[2:13:05] be wrong but i'm just going by memory
[2:13:07] well you had the second woe
[2:13:12] started in world war ii
[2:13:15] brother branham gets his commission is
[2:13:18] it 1946
[2:13:20] am i right 1946 he gets his commission
[2:13:24] because because because because because
[2:13:29] he gets commissioned at the decline of
[2:13:32] the second world war
[2:13:34] because revelations chapter 10
[2:13:39] happens between the sixth and seventh
[2:13:40] trumpet after
[2:13:42] world war ii do we understand
[2:13:46] everything in the bible matches his
[2:13:48] ministry
[2:13:49] the book of revelation it matches his
[2:13:51] ministry amen he's growing up during the
[2:13:53] first war
[2:13:54] he's coming of age there's another war
[2:13:56] at the decline of that war amen it's
[2:13:58] going to set things in place
[2:14:00] that first war is what actually started
[2:14:03] amen there was a belfar
[2:14:04] declaration that came out of the first
[2:14:05] war because the jews helped finance some
[2:14:07] of the war
[2:14:08] and in a kickback from great britain
[2:14:10] they wanted to know what the financiers
[2:14:11] which were
[2:14:12] jews wanted and they wanted a zionist
[2:14:14] movement to move forward they wanted a
[2:14:15] homeland in palestine and the belfast
[2:14:17] declaration came out
[2:14:19] then that started the process of giving
[2:14:21] them land
[2:14:22] because the trumpets are to gather
[2:14:24] israel to their homeland
[2:14:26] and war one was instrumental in
[2:14:29] gathering israel to their homeland and
[2:14:31] set the foundation but world war
[2:14:33] ii set the stage when those demons were
[2:14:35] released and brought a bitter
[2:14:37] persecution against the jews
[2:14:39] it was doing what driving them to the
[2:14:41] homeland and
[2:14:42] changing the mind of all the nations to
[2:14:44] go back to the belkfire declaration
[2:14:47] and give them a piece of land in
[2:14:48] palestine why
[2:14:50] because the woes because the trumpets
[2:14:52] are all moving israel back into their
[2:14:54] homeland
[2:14:55] so the two prophets can show up to bring
[2:14:57] them to the feast of atonement so they
[2:14:59] can recognize the slain lamb
[2:15:02] the whole world is moving around your
[2:15:06] bible
[2:15:08] the whole world is moving in conjunction
[2:15:10] with these scriptures
[2:15:11] and brother branham's life and ministry
[2:15:14] is moving right
[2:15:15] in line with every bible we should have
[2:15:17] so much confidence in this word
[2:15:19] we've watched nations rise and nations
[2:15:22] fall
[2:15:22] in our some of our lifetimes because of
[2:15:25] this word
[2:15:25] we've watched war start and stop
[2:15:27] instantly because it was only
[2:15:29] world war one was only to start to get
[2:15:31] things rolling but it wasn't going to
[2:15:32] happen until world war
[2:15:33] ii we watched events
[2:15:37] national events the the two big toes
[2:15:40] iron and clay trying to mix but they
[2:15:41] won't mix
[2:15:42] it all fell apart to signal to brother
[2:15:44] branham that now
[2:15:45] we're at the end time you can move into
[2:15:47] the book of revelation and start
[2:15:48] preaching the church ages
[2:15:52] not coincidence not some man's fancy
[2:15:55] idea
[2:15:56] not people are easily persuaded but the
[2:15:59] bible alive in your history book a bible
[2:16:02] alive all around us
[2:16:03] where are we at in time france we're at
[2:16:05] the end of the end of the end
[2:16:08] israel's gathered back home amen when
[2:16:10] the last
[2:16:11] when the last member of the bride is
[2:16:12] gathered in and the last of the 144 000
[2:16:15] are gathered in
[2:16:16] then there's going to mark a translation
[2:16:18] time for you and i
[2:16:20] and that ministry will kick up to those
[2:16:22] two witnesses and they're gonna reveal
[2:16:24] to them
[2:16:24] they're not going you know
[2:16:29] opening the seals was not
[2:16:32] starting each seal because most of the
[2:16:36] seals were historical
[2:16:39] revealing the trumpets is not starting
[2:16:41] the trumpets because by the time they
[2:16:43] reveal it it'll be historical
[2:16:46] amen what happened
[2:16:49] in the gap in the book of revelations
[2:16:51] between the six and seventh seal
[2:16:53] between the sixth and seventh trumpet
[2:16:54] and between the sixth and seventh vial
[2:16:56] i'll tell you what happened a bride was
[2:16:58] called out of the gentiles
[2:17:00] and 144 000 jews were called out of the
[2:17:02] jewish tradition
[2:17:05] that's what happened under what under an
[2:17:07] eagle anointing of prophets three of
[2:17:09] them all together
[2:17:10] that's what's happening in the gap
[2:17:15] gathering what gathering us to christ
[2:17:18] the word
[2:17:18] gathering them to a home so that they
[2:17:21] can receive
[2:17:22] christ the word
[2:17:25] that prophet's ministry it lifts right
[2:17:28] out of the bible
[2:17:30] and my life is intertwined with this
[2:17:33] word
[2:17:37] brother brandon makes another statement
[2:17:42] want to make one more and then we're
[2:17:43] going to close we're going to have to
[2:17:44] close
[2:17:45] if i keep going there'll be so many
[2:17:46] details i won't even know what i'm
[2:17:48] talking about
[2:17:49] after a few minutes
[2:17:54] revelations 9
[2:17:57] 12 again after war one
[2:18:01] one woe was passed fifth trumpet and
[2:18:03] behold there come two woes more
[2:18:06] hereafter the sixth trumpet all the
[2:18:09] demons release out of euphrates
[2:18:11] and go to persecute the jews to drive
[2:18:14] them back to the homeland
[2:18:17] under the sixth seal if you just listen
[2:18:20] to me here
[2:18:21] under the sixth seal which opened
[2:18:25] when this river opened and these demons
[2:18:28] came out
[2:18:29] do you believe that and went into the
[2:18:33] armies to persecute the jews that was
[2:18:35] the opening of the
[2:18:36] sixth trumpet and brother banner said
[2:18:39] the sixth trumpet
[2:18:40] and the sixth seal sound at the same
[2:18:42] time because the sixth seal is judgment
[2:18:44] and persecution tribulation so it was a
[2:18:47] tribulation brother van calls it in the
[2:18:49] seals an amateur tribulation
[2:18:51] or a minor tribulation but nonetheless
[2:18:54] it was the sixth seal and it was the
[2:18:55] sixth trumpet come open then
[2:18:58] and after it opened
[2:19:02] you have the calling of a prophet and
[2:19:05] that prophet's life is on display he's
[2:19:07] doing the sign of the prophet
[2:19:08] everything's happening
[2:19:09] but that prophet can't begin his
[2:19:11] ministry into the book of revelation
[2:19:13] until he sees the kingdom of those ten
[2:19:15] toes
[2:19:18] and when those ten toes come together he
[2:19:20] knows
[2:19:21] now it's time for the stone that can be
[2:19:23] cut out of the mount without hand
[2:19:24] it's time for the the revelation of
[2:19:28] jesus christ which is the seventh seal
[2:19:33] it's the seventh seal that crushes those
[2:19:35] powers it's the seventh seal that sets
[2:19:37] up a kingdom in the millennium
[2:19:38] it's a seventh seal that you've united
[2:19:40] with it's a seven seal you're part of
[2:19:41] it's the seventh seal that brought the
[2:19:43] revelation
[2:19:43] it's the seventh seal that gathered in
[2:19:45] the it's under the trumpets gathered
[2:19:47] israel together
[2:19:50] and in that time under the sixth seal
[2:19:53] he says everything sounds under the
[2:19:55] sixth seal everything happens under the
[2:19:57] sixth seal
[2:19:57] brothers branham's ministry happens
[2:19:59] under the sixth skill because in the
[2:20:00] sixth seal
[2:20:01] persecution tribulation set in on the
[2:20:03] jews it
[2:20:04] starts a marker it starts a time date
[2:20:06] stamp marker
[2:20:08] and from there it'll run to the end of
[2:20:10] the three and a half year tribulation
[2:20:11] period
[2:20:12] and under that sixth seal a prophet
[2:20:15] comes to the gentiles
[2:20:16] gathers the gentiles together the
[2:20:18] gentiles are called home
[2:20:19] two prophets break out in revelation
[2:20:21] chapter 11 to bring the
[2:20:23] the feast of trump it's the revelation
[2:20:25] of the trumpets to the jews
[2:20:26] amen the 144 000 are called out they're
[2:20:29] martyred they're
[2:20:30] resurrected i think i'm not sure but it
[2:20:32] looks like
[2:20:33] but the rem said they were
[2:20:36] the world goes in absolute chaos the
[2:20:38] vials are poured out
[2:20:39] everything is is destroyed in jesus
[2:20:42] christ
[2:20:43] and the 144 thousand and the bride
[2:20:45] returned to set up an earthly kingdom
[2:20:47] in the millennial reign
[2:20:50] all of that up to the millennium
[2:20:54] happened under the sixth seal where are
[2:20:57] we at now
[2:20:58] under the sixth seal having united with
[2:21:01] the seventh seal
[2:21:04] we are the very manifestation of the
[2:21:06] seventh seal
[2:21:11] revelation 10 under the sixth seal
[2:21:16] is revelations 10 between the 6th and
[2:21:18] 7th
[2:21:20] trump and i mean under the 6th trumpet
[2:21:22] revelations 10.
[2:21:25] another mighty angel come down from
[2:21:27] heaven
[2:21:28] why because under the sixth seal we've
[2:21:32] come to the seventh step
[2:21:34] and there's somebody that can bridge the
[2:21:35] gap between number six and number seven
[2:21:40] there's somebody that can stand in the
[2:21:42] gap a prophet
[2:21:43] and tie six and seven together and six
[2:21:47] and seven together
[2:21:48] and six and seven together so that we
[2:21:51] would know who we are
[2:21:53] and where we came from and where we are
[2:21:56] in the timeline
[2:21:57] and what happens next and where we're
[2:21:59] going and what what we're going to enjoy
[2:22:01] in the next thousand years
[2:22:03] somebody came in the gap and it was a
[2:22:05] prophet to tie these two together to
[2:22:07] bridge the game
[2:22:09] but let's look at verse seven but in the
[2:22:13] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[2:22:14] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[2:22:16] of god shall be finished
[2:22:18] as he had declared to his servants the
[2:22:20] prophets do we believe that
[2:22:24] brother brahma says in the feast of
[2:22:25] trump is look i want to say one more
[2:22:27] thing closely now don't miss this
[2:22:28] how striking from the seventh angel's
[2:22:31] message
[2:22:32] he injects in parentheses somebody put
[2:22:35] parentheses
[2:22:36] how striking from the seventh angels
[2:22:38] message messenger
[2:22:40] of the seventh seal he said
[2:22:43] seventh angel's messenger the messenger
[2:22:45] of who is brother branham the messenger
[2:22:47] of the seventh
[2:22:48] seal from the seventh angels messenger
[2:22:52] of the seventh seal message in
[2:22:53] revelations 10
[2:22:55] so what was his message revelations 10
[2:22:58] was the seventh seal what was revelation
[2:23:00] 10 the seventh seal
[2:23:02] that's his message the seventh seal now
[2:23:05] he says
[2:23:06] from the seventh angels message in
[2:23:07] revelation 10 was the seventh seal
[2:23:09] to the seven trumpets between those
[2:23:12] times
[2:23:13] what happens between those times
[2:23:17] between the seventh angels message the
[2:23:20] 17th on revelations 10
[2:23:22] and between the seventh trumpet that
[2:23:24] shows up in 1115
[2:23:27] you have two things that take place
[2:23:31] you have the under the seventh seal the
[2:23:32] angel that descends the thunders
[2:23:34] the revelation under the seventh angel
[2:23:38] but then you have john
[2:23:43] in revelations 10 8 who's told to go and
[2:23:46] take the book
[2:23:48] out of the mighty angel's hand and eat
[2:23:51] the book
[2:23:53] and prophesy again
[2:23:56] what is that the seventh seal
[2:24:00] under the sixth seal in between the
[2:24:03] seventh seal
[2:24:04] and the seventh trumpet you have christ
[2:24:07] coming
[2:24:08] through a son of man ministry a
[2:24:09] prophetic ministry now you have the
[2:24:11] bride eating the book and prophesying
[2:24:12] again
[2:24:13] then you go to two prophets and then
[2:24:16] you have the seventh trumpet where are
[2:24:19] we
[2:24:20] you can put your finger right down here
[2:24:22] revelations 10
[2:24:24] verse 11. that's me
[2:24:29] that's me and world events has lined up
[2:24:32] to bring us here
[2:24:33] and everything that's going on in the
[2:24:35] world is to promote this
[2:24:36] and everything that's happening amen is
[2:24:38] to get this bride amen to gather
[2:24:40] together to get this bride to this word
[2:24:42] amen so that she can get out of the way
[2:24:44] so that the the message could go to the
[2:24:46] 144 000.
[2:24:48] and where are we right here
[2:24:52] brother branham had a ministry in the
[2:24:53] gap the two witnesses have a ministry in
[2:24:56] the gap
[2:24:57] and the bride has a ministry in the gap
[2:25:00] and i say thank god for telling us who
[2:25:03] we are
[2:25:04] and if god if god
[2:25:07] moved nations if god crumbled
[2:25:12] peace treaties if god
[2:25:16] anointed khrushchev to take his shoe off
[2:25:20] and pound it on the table to show us
[2:25:21] where we are
[2:25:23] what anointing is in the earth now to
[2:25:25] make sure that we do our job
[2:25:27] to make sure that we're in the right
[2:25:28] place in the right time with the right
[2:25:30] revelation speaking the right words
[2:25:32] everything is moving around these
[2:25:35] scriptures friends
[2:25:36] everything that's happening all
[2:25:38] pandemics all governments
[2:25:40] all whatever is happening financial
[2:25:42] rises financial collapse
[2:25:44] you rest assured fred that everything
[2:25:46] that moved in brother branham's life
[2:25:48] there's still just as many things moving
[2:25:50] right now
[2:25:51] because this is the seventh steal i mean
[2:25:53] we're still under the sixth seal amen
[2:25:54] we're still
[2:25:55] the bride is united with the seven seal
[2:25:57] and she's prophesying again
[2:25:59] what's been said before and everything
[2:26:01] on earth is facilitating that
[2:26:04] if it looks good if it looks bad if it
[2:26:06] hurts if it feels good
[2:26:07] it doesn't matter the whole world is
[2:26:10] turning around
[2:26:11] these scriptures in this bible and
[2:26:13] you're
[2:26:14] in that scripture in this bible and so
[2:26:16] the whole thing is moving to make sure
[2:26:19] you're in the right the whole thing
[2:26:20] moved can you imagine
[2:26:22] what moved globally and how many people
[2:26:24] died amen in that world war one in world
[2:26:26] war
[2:26:27] ii just to make a place for the jews to
[2:26:29] come back to
[2:26:30] and to give an incentive for them to go
[2:26:32] back and now they've run
[2:26:33] back to that place and they're there
[2:26:35] they're their own country own money own
[2:26:37] military
[2:26:38] and they're still gathering people in by
[2:26:40] the thousands
[2:26:42] why because there's got to be a ministry
[2:26:45] of the seventh trumpet
[2:26:48] why because of this bible not because of
[2:26:51] their ideas
[2:26:54] because of the prophecy not because of
[2:26:56] some man's idea
[2:26:58] in some pretty country some nice
[2:27:00] currency and some politics
[2:27:04] politics is controlled by this word
[2:27:11] there's a lot more i want to say but
[2:27:12] we'll come back let's all stand
[2:27:16] i hope i hope some of that was clear to
[2:27:18] you
[2:27:19] i hope some of it came across and i hope
[2:27:22] it wasn't too much
[2:27:24] it overwhelmed you but i say like
[2:27:27] brother benham said
[2:27:28] i've tried to draw it out and map it out
[2:27:30] here i may have some of it wrong
[2:27:34] boy that's a big thing to say you're
[2:27:36] preaching
[2:27:38] but i know one thing what i'm looking at
[2:27:40] is the truth
[2:27:41] what brother brandon said is right what
[2:27:43] when he says this all happens under the
[2:27:45] sixth seal he's
[2:27:46] right when he says the six and seven
[2:27:48] seals sound at the same time he's right
[2:27:50] it's nothing but the truth and it's
[2:27:53] truer than truer than true amen
[2:27:57] but i just say god reveal it to us in a
[2:28:00] greater way
[2:28:01] let me see it i hope more than anything
[2:28:04] that this revelation that grows
[2:28:06] out of the church ages the seals and the
[2:28:07] trumpets and the vials hopefully in the
[2:28:09] future
[2:28:10] i hope it edifies and purifies your
[2:28:12] heart
[2:28:14] do you feel edified let it purify
[2:28:18] if god sought thought so much
[2:28:22] of you and i his brother branham his
[2:28:24] word and those two prophets and 140
[2:28:26] 000 he thought so much of them to
[2:28:28] orchestrate all the world events to make
[2:28:30] it
[2:28:31] matches scripture how can we not give
[2:28:34] him everything
[2:28:36] how can we not put our confidence in him
[2:28:38] what's going to fail
[2:28:40] you tell me what's going to fail you
[2:28:42] look at the prophecy laying in this
[2:28:43] scripture what we just went through and
[2:28:45] what brother branham saw and pointed out
[2:28:46] you tell me what's going to fail
[2:28:48] nothing's going to fail nothing that
[2:28:50] threatens you
[2:28:50] nothing that's going to harm you nothing
[2:28:52] is every nothing
[2:28:54] is going to work to throw you off god's
[2:28:56] course and nothing that god said is
[2:28:58] going to fail
[2:28:59] it may not look like what we expected it
[2:29:01] may not come in the way we predicted
[2:29:03] but nothing is going to be out of kilter
[2:29:06] he's so
[2:29:06] perfectly tuned his word and he's moved
[2:29:09] this world to match his word
[2:29:11] there's nothing going to be out of
[2:29:12] kilter friends
[2:29:14] oh i want to have more rest i say that
[2:29:16] to myself because i want to have more
[2:29:18] rest in the hour of calamity i want to
[2:29:21] have peace that passes understanding
[2:29:22] i want to be like a baby in this
[2:29:24] mother's arms amen and the whole world
[2:29:26] is falling apart
[2:29:27] but i know i can find my place in
[2:29:29] scripture
[2:29:30] and i can find how we got here and i can
[2:29:32] see the world events that brought us
[2:29:33] here
[2:29:34] how is the future not just as secure
[2:29:38] and how is my life not just as ordained
[2:29:40] as brother branham's was
[2:29:43] we're children of god let the revelation
[2:29:46] of it
[2:29:47] edify and purify our hearts
[2:29:51] god bless you be praying for me there's
[2:29:53] so many more things i'd like to share
[2:29:56] on wednesday and maybe the next sunday
[2:29:58] but i'm overwhelmed
[2:30:00] this is nothing new brother ben said all
[2:30:02] these things
[2:30:03] but all of a sudden in my heart
[2:30:06] i'm having aha moments
[2:30:14] and what's the purpose to jump up and
[2:30:16] down and say i know i know i know i know
[2:30:18] something i know
[2:30:20] i know why khrushchev beat his ch is as
[2:30:22] shoe
[2:30:24] no because the revelation of it edifies
[2:30:27] and purifies my heart
[2:30:31] seeing the seals and the trumpets and
[2:30:33] the vial
[2:30:34] it purifies and edifies my heart
[2:30:38] my god my father my husband
[2:30:42] has tuned his word in it's
[2:30:45] pre-programmed
[2:30:46] and it's not going to falter
[2:30:50] my position is secure in christ
[2:30:54] i'm part of this word and it's
[2:30:58] perfect and because that word which i
[2:31:01] was part of bled and died to pay my
[2:31:03] redemption price
[2:31:04] i am also perfect not perfect in my
[2:31:08] conduct not perfect in my thinking but
[2:31:10] perfect in the seed gene in my soul it
[2:31:13] is
[2:31:13] perfect because when the price was paid
[2:31:16] i was there
[2:31:16] paying the price with him i am perfect
[2:31:19] perfectly in line with this word
[2:31:21] and the word is going to be perfectly
[2:31:22] manifest in me because i was there
[2:31:25] and i was there and i was in the mind of
[2:31:27] god before it was ever written and i was
[2:31:29] there when it was written i'm in the
[2:31:30] print
[2:31:31] and i was on the cross and i was there
[2:31:35] amen let's just pray
[2:31:38] the heavenly father we thank you lord
[2:31:40] jesus
[2:31:42] god there's so much lord there's just so
[2:31:44] much
[2:31:45] lord it's not about information lord let
[2:31:47] it never be about that
[2:31:49] but let it be about revelation to
[2:31:51] edification
[2:31:53] god you're so perfect your ways are so
[2:31:56] perfect everything you've done is
[2:31:57] perfect
[2:31:58] and i pray god that you would just
[2:32:00] reveal yourself to me
[2:32:02] that i can see lord what your prophet
[2:32:04] saw
[2:32:05] help me god never to stumble or to
[2:32:07] falter or to change what he said or
[2:32:09] put it off in some other place but god
[2:32:12] just shine that light a little further
[2:32:14] lord
[2:32:15] and give us the courage to walk forward
[2:32:17] when we see another place to step
[2:32:19] when we see a little further in the path
[2:32:22] give us that courage to move forward not
[2:32:24] knowing where it would lead not knowing
[2:32:25] where it will go not knowing when it
[2:32:27] might turn or go up or go down
[2:32:29] but give us that courage to keep walking
[2:32:31] and lord if we can be faithful to walk i
[2:32:33] pray that you keep shining that light
[2:32:34] further and further
[2:32:36] for you're leading us home lord
[2:32:39] dear god i pray that you bless your
[2:32:41] people that you'd give us the spirit of
[2:32:43] revelation
[2:32:44] that we could actually see our bibles
[2:32:46] and see the gap in our bibles and what
[2:32:48] takes place there
[2:32:49] and that it would encourage us lord and
[2:32:52] i pray god that you would cleanse our
[2:32:54] hearts and use us for this final push
[2:32:57] we know that the end time was declared
[2:32:59] all the way back in 1960 by a prophet
[2:33:03] and we know that the end time cycle is
[2:33:05] finishing everything
[2:33:07] and one day you're going to finish our
[2:33:08] ministry on this earth and call us home
[2:33:11] let us be found faithful lord let us be
[2:33:14] found
[2:33:14] faithful to that day give us revelation
[2:33:17] give us wisdom to handle it
[2:33:19] and give us a desire from the hunger for
[2:33:21] you
[2:33:22] we ask that you would bless us all as we
[2:33:24] go our way
[2:33:25] keep us by your grace in jesus christ's
[2:33:28] name we pray
[2:33:29] amen god bless you saints
[2:33:33] i love you all i pray that there is
[2:33:36] something helpful said today
[2:33:38] i feel like i jumbled it up and i mess
[2:33:41] if you knew what was in my heart
[2:33:42] you'd be like chad you ruined it
[2:33:46] if you knew what god and god drops
[2:33:48] things into your heart without
[2:33:49] explaining it to your mind
[2:33:51] have you ever experienced that he'll
[2:33:53] drop something to your heart and you
[2:33:54] know it
[2:33:55] you know it like you know your own name
[2:33:56] but to explain it it's just something
[2:33:58] altogether different
[2:34:00] i come through the pulpit today and not
[2:34:02] under anxiety
[2:34:03] because all the things that i'm saying i
[2:34:05] have no idea how to explain i don't even
[2:34:07] understand
[2:34:08] everything intellectually but there's
[2:34:10] something that i'm seeing that's real
[2:34:12] it's true and it's showing me that we're
[2:34:14] all the way through the book of
[2:34:15] revelation the bride is all the way in
[2:34:17] revelation 22
[2:34:18] 17 and she's standing there saying the
[2:34:20] spirit and the bride say come
[2:34:22] she's come all the way to the end of her
[2:34:23] ministry she's come all the way through
[2:34:25] all of these things and she's standing
[2:34:27] here at the
[2:34:28] end declaring come
[2:34:31] come and everything i see just
[2:34:34] reinforces that lesson
[2:34:35] we're not waiting for things to happen
[2:34:37] they've happened
[2:34:38] for the bride they've happened we're now
[2:34:40] feasting in the seventh feast
[2:34:43] the feast of tabernacles what comes next
[2:34:45] for the bride
[2:34:46] nothing it's already happened
[2:34:50] the next thing to happen is for us to go
[2:34:52] because for us he's already come
[2:34:56] for us he's already come what is the
[2:34:58] seventh seal the coming of the lord
[2:35:00] but brother branham said the seventh
[2:35:01] seal was the mystery of going
[2:35:03] why because we're standing in the place
[2:35:05] we've already been revealed the mystery
[2:35:06] of his coming
[2:35:08] but what's left is the mystery of going
[2:35:10] because that's not been told yet that
[2:35:11] third part of that
[2:35:13] vision hasn't been told to us yet
[2:35:15] [Music]
[2:35:17] what under the seventh seal
[2:35:21] a prophet comes to introduce
[2:35:25] us to the messiah to make an
[2:35:28] introduction
[2:35:29] to join us and he goes off the scene
[2:35:33] in the seven trumpets two prophets show
[2:35:34] up to make an introduction
[2:35:37] to join them together you see it's all
[2:35:39] the seventh seal
[2:35:42] and in the vials we haven't got today
[2:35:44] but the viles
[2:35:45] is to prepare the earth for the
[2:35:46] millennial reign to what
[2:35:49] bring christ to the earth to make an
[2:35:53] you see it seven seals introduced the
[2:35:57] gentiles to christ
[2:35:59] seven trumpets to introduce the jews to
[2:36:01] christ
[2:36:02] and the seven vials to bring christ to
[2:36:04] the earth for his millennial reign
[2:36:06] three things that are being redeemed the
[2:36:08] jews the gentiles and the earth
[2:36:11] three different cycles of redemption
[2:36:13] three different ways of introduction
[2:36:15] but what is it they're all coming to the
[2:36:17] seventh seal it's all the coming of the
[2:36:18] lord
[2:36:19] coming to the bride as a bridegroom amen
[2:36:22] coming to an invisible union
[2:36:23] that's the coming of the lord where is
[2:36:25] he coming now he's coming
[2:36:27] to the jews amen as the slain lamb as
[2:36:30] the true atonement
[2:36:31] coming now through two prophets ministry
[2:36:33] coming to be introduced to them what is
[2:36:35] it the coming of the lord
[2:36:37] and then when he comes as king the son
[2:36:38] of david is sitting on the earth on a
[2:36:39] purged earth in the millennium
[2:36:41] what is that the coming of the lord
[2:36:43] which one's the coming of the lord
[2:36:45] they're all the coming of the lord which
[2:36:46] one's the seven seal it's all the
[2:36:48] seventh seal
[2:36:49] but which one am i part of i'm right now
[2:36:52] in that first coming he is coming me
[2:36:57] do we understand when we see these
[2:37:00] things it takes so much fight away
[2:37:02] has he come or is he coming the coming
[2:37:05] of the lord
[2:37:05] no he's not coming till he sits his feet
[2:37:07] on there no he's coming as the thief in
[2:37:09] the night no but he'll be coming to the
[2:37:10] jews
[2:37:11] my goodness it's all true friends and
[2:37:13] the prophet says it all
[2:37:15] that's why there's so much fight and so
[2:37:16] much argue because the problem says he's
[2:37:18] come
[2:37:18] and then he says he's coming and then
[2:37:22] but you understand if you look at the
[2:37:24] three cycles of redemption then you can
[2:37:26] say
[2:37:26] if you're standing here as a gentile if
[2:37:28] you're the bride of jesus christ you say
[2:37:30] the lord has come amen
[2:37:34] if you're a jew you're looking for the
[2:37:36] lord to come
[2:37:39] and if you're the earth you're waiting
[2:37:41] for your king you're waiting to be
[2:37:42] purged for your king to come and set
[2:37:44] everything in order
[2:37:46] so for me he's come
[2:37:50] for the jew he's coming and for the
[2:37:52] earth he's coming
[2:37:54] but for me he's come
[2:37:57] and i've united with him in an invisible
[2:37:59] union and i've been caught through the
[2:38:00] open door
[2:38:01] and i've seen the mysteries revealed i'm
[2:38:04] feasting in the seventh trump of the
[2:38:05] seventh feast the feast of tabernacles
[2:38:07] because he's dwelling in this tabernacle
[2:38:10] the feast of tabernacles i'm in my
[2:38:13] spiritual millennium my king sitting on
[2:38:15] the throne of my heart
[2:38:16] ruling and reigning i will be in a
[2:38:20] physical millennium but right now
[2:38:22] the son of david solomon has come and
[2:38:24] brought me into the golden age of
[2:38:26] revelation
[2:38:27] where me and my savior are united
[2:38:29] together
[2:38:30] big why because i know beyond a shadow
[2:38:33] of a doubt that the smiling stone has
[2:38:34] come and
[2:38:35] smote that image in its feet
[2:38:38] and that has grown into a great mountain
[2:38:41] and i'm part of that kingdom i don't
[2:38:44] know what that does to you
[2:38:46] but that does everything in the world to
[2:38:48] me
[2:38:49] that's my life that's my existence
[2:38:51] that's my whole heart
[2:38:52] that's everything i live for is that
[2:38:54] right there and i can't explain it right
[2:38:56] i don't understand it correctly
[2:38:58] i don't put the pieces together right
[2:38:59] but that's my whole life
[2:39:02] and we may not get it exactly right but
[2:39:04] he'll forgive me if we got something
[2:39:06] wrong
[2:39:06] because he knows where my heart is and
[2:39:08] he knows what we're pressing towards
[2:39:11] hold that lantern up again friends and
