[0:00] God was so pleased with his actions.
[0:02] Amen. And and brother said, "All
[0:04] Abraham's seed believes God like that."
[0:06] I tell you friends, I don't know that I
[0:08] always do, but I want to. And I believe
[0:10] I'm Abraham's seed, and I want to love
[0:12] him more than I love anything else. Why?
[0:14] BECAUSE HE FIRST LOVED ME. LOOK WHAT
[0:15] HE'S DONE FOR ME. I'M A NOBODY FROM
[0:18] NOWHERE. AND I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE
[0:20] IN THIS WORLD. I was a I WAS A RENEGADE.
[0:23] I WAS EVERYTHING ELSE AND TOSSED ABOUT
[0:25] AND AND AND IGNORANT AND BLIND AS CAN
[0:27] BE. AND GOD BROUGHT THIS MESSAGE TO ME
[0:30] AND HE OPENED MY EYES. HE REDEEMED ME
[0:32] AND HE DREW ME TO HIMSELF AND HE
[0:34] WHISPERED LOVE SECRETS IN MY EAR AND HE
[0:36] OPENED UP THE BACK PART OF HIS MIND. HE
[0:38] UNVEILED HIMSELF IN THE HIDDEN CHAMBER
[0:40] AND SHOWED ME WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING FOR
[0:43] 6,000 7,000 YEARS. EVEN BEFORE THAT,
[0:46] WHAT HIS PLAN WAS BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[0:47] OF THE WORLD. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
[0:49] GARDEN OF EDEN? I KNOW THE SECRET THAT
[0:51] THE WHOLE WORLD DOESN'T KNOW.
[0:52] [screaming]
[0:52] AMEN. HOW COULD I NOT LOVE HIM? HOW
[0:55] COULD I NOT SERVE HIM? HOW COULD I TURN
[0:57] MY NOSE UP BECAUSE THE PROPHET SAYS
[0:58] SOMETHING THAT I DOESN'T THINK SOUND
[1:00] RIGHT WHEN GOD HAS BEEN SO GOOD TO ME?
[1:04] &gt;&gt; IT'S AN ARROGANT, SELFISH SPIRIT.
[1:07] &gt;&gt; I OWE HIM EVERYTHING. WHAT WHO WAS I
[1:10] THAT HE SHOULD COME AND REVEAL THE WORD
[1:11] TO ME? WHAT WISDOM DID I HAVE? WHAT
[1:14] INTELLIGENCE DID I HAVE? WHAT FAMILY
[1:15] CONNECTIONS DID I HAVE? I MEAN, WHAT
[1:17] WHAT WAS I? I WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; NOT EVEN A DOT ON THE MAP. NOT EVEN A
[1:24] NUMBER ON A TALLY SHEET SOMEWHERE.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; ONE OF EIGHT BILLION PEOPLE ON THE
[1:30] EARTH.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; WHO COULD FIND one out of eight billion?
[1:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; IF I PILED UP 8 billion anything here.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; I don't even know if it fit here.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; And you go pluck one out and tell you
[1:46] that one. You're precious to me and I
[1:48] love you and I'm going to tell you all
[1:49] my secrets. I'm going to draw you to
[1:51] myself and I'm going to I'm going to
[1:52] give you a glorified body and you're
[1:54] going to sit with me in my throne for a
[1:56] thousand years and you're going to be in
[1:57] the new heavens and new earth and you're
[1:59] GOING TO HAVE PERFECTION AND YOU'RE
[2:00] GOING TO BE PART OF ME. YOU'RE GOING TO
[2:01] BE AN EXPRESSION of me and we're going
[2:03] to come into a unity like nobody's ever
[2:05] seen before AND WE'RE GOING TO LIVE
[2:06] TOGETHER FOREVER. OH, WHAT WOULD THAT
[2:08] ONE LITTLE ITEM THAT'S PLUCKED OUT OF 8
[2:10] BILLION FEEL ABOUT THE ONE WHO PLUCKED
[2:12] THEM OUT? YEAH, that's right.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; OH, GOD, HELP US NOT TO BE PROUD AND
[2:17] ARROGANT AND GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE
[2:19] think we deserved it or we were owed it
[2:21] or
[2:23] &gt;&gt; OR I WAS GOOD ENOUGH OR HE LIKED ME OR I
[2:26] HAD BEAUTIFUL EYES.
[2:29] &gt;&gt; We had nothing. This was purely based on
[2:31] his love and election,
[2:34] &gt;&gt; not only merit of our own. And it should
[2:36] put inside of us such a tremendous
[2:39] passionate love for him [clears throat]
[2:42] &gt;&gt; that if he ASKED ME TO DROP EVERYTHING
[2:44] and go to the other side of the planet
[2:45] tomorrow, I should be willing to do it
[2:47] though it cost me everything.
