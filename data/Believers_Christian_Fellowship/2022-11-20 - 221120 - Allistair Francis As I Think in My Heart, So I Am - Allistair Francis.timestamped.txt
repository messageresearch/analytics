[15:29] these people I feel the most privileged
[15:32] person on the planet I hope you do too
[15:35] and I pray that God allows to take
[15:37] advantage of this time that we have
[15:40] this moment
[15:42] and that we've had wonderful Services
[15:44] God's been so good to us he's been
[15:45] feeding us with his own hand
[15:48] but you know I I woke up this morning
[15:50] and though I ate yesterday I wanted a
[15:53] little something this morning and
[15:55] spiritually I woke up this morning and
[15:57] we've ate good but I want something more
[16:00] from our Lord this morning I need
[16:03] something more for my spiritual
[16:04] nurturing to grow up to be what he wants
[16:07] me to be
[16:08] oh I love you I love you all and I've
[16:12] been so happy to be together I thank God
[16:14] for his hand upon us this weekend
[16:16] the things that he spoke to us
[16:19] that he's brought from his own mind and
[16:21] shared with us I'm so grateful for it
[16:24] it's changed me it's affected me it's
[16:26] helped me it's challenged me and
[16:28] encouraged me in the very same service
[16:30] how can a man do that that's not a man
[16:32] that's God that can create a challenge
[16:35] that makes you feel so challenged and so
[16:36] far away from the mark and then bring an
[16:38] encouragement that lets you know it's
[16:40] all okay you're going to make it all in
[16:42] the same service

[22:58] amen let's turn in our Bibles
[23:01] I'm going to go to Genesis 25 22-34
[23:13] .
[23:18] Genesis 25 22-34
[23:23] we'll just take our scripture reading
[23:25] then
[23:26] you can take your seats
[23:36] if you're there the word of God reads
[23:37] like this
[23:39] and the children struggle together
[23:41] within her
[23:42] and she said if it be so why am I thus
[23:47] and she went to inquire of the Lord and
[23:49] the Lord said unto her two nations are
[23:53] in thy womb and two manner of people
[23:56] shall be separated from thy bowels
[24:00] and the one people shall be stronger
[24:02] than the other people and the Elder
[24:04] Shall Serve the younger
[24:06] and when her days to be delivered were
[24:08] fulfilled behold they were twins in her
[24:12] womb and the first came out red all over
[24:15] like in Harry garment and they called
[24:18] his name Esau
[24:20] and after that came his brother out and
[24:22] his hand took hold on Esau's heel
[24:26] and his name was called Jacob
[24:29] and Esau was and Isaac was three score
[24:32] years old when she beared them
[24:35] and the boys grew and ESO was a cunning
[24:38] Hunter a man in the field and Jacob was
[24:41] a plain man dwelling in tents
[24:44] and Isaac loved Esau because he did eat
[24:47] of his venison but Rebecca loved Jacob
[24:51] and Jacob sawed pottage
[24:54] and Esau came from the field and he was
[24:56] faint
[24:57] and Esau said to Jacob
[25:00] feed me I pray thee with that same red
[25:03] pottage for I am faint
[25:05] therefore was his name called Edom
[25:08] and Jacob said sell me this uh this day
[25:11] thy Birthright
[25:13] and Esau said behold I am at the point
[25:15] to die and what prophet shall this
[25:17] Birthright do to me and Jacob said swear
[25:20] to me this day and he swear unto him and
[25:24] he sold his Birthright unto Jacob
[25:27] then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage
[25:30] of lentils and he did eat and drink and
[25:34] Rose up and went his way thus Esau
[25:37] despised his Birthright
[25:40] the Lord had a blessing to his word you
[25:42] may be seated
[25:46] glory to God
[25:48] greet you in the name of our Lord and
[25:50] Savior Jesus Christ
[25:52] the highest greeting of all amen the
[25:55] Lord bless you this morning it's been a
[25:57] privilege to be here it's been a
[25:59] privilege uh to share the pulpit with my
[26:02] brother brother Daniel you appreciate
[26:04] again brother Chad for allowing us this
[26:07] opportunity to share what God has laid
[26:10] on our hearts
[26:11] and I must say this uh I've never been a
[26:14] fanatical person or person who just
[26:18] looks on signs and things like this you
[26:21] know it's just I've tried to stay just
[26:23] stay with the word as much as I can and
[26:26] as simple as possible but these meetings
[26:29] have been uh unusually like brother Chad
[26:33] said lead
[26:34] just things and and I I I've never met
[26:37] brother Daniel I've never heard him
[26:39] preach
[26:40] I don't get on the internet much and I I
[26:43] don't know anything and here we are we
[26:46] come to this place we're speaking and he
[26:48] starts on things and I don't know what
[26:50] he's going to preach I don't know what
[26:51] the theme of this weekend is going to be
[26:53] when I prepare to go out I got like 11
[26:57] to 20 sermons that God has on my heart
[26:59] and I've got this whole selection in I
[27:02] feel like I want to get into something
[27:04] and and I had all these things and then
[27:07] but the ones that started standing out
[27:09] as we came closer to these meetings just
[27:11] started impressing in my heart
[27:13] and then
[27:15] he starts with this
[27:17] here I am
[27:21] and
[27:22] this particular one this morning
[27:25] I want to title it as I think in my
[27:28] heart so I am
[27:33] and you know from the scripture as I um
[27:35] and that's from the scripture so as I
[27:37] think in my heart so I am so I also want
[27:41] to thank brother Franco he's been
[27:43] wonderful such a fine spirit I think
[27:45] I've given him a lot of trouble because
[27:46] I didn't come here with a PowerPoint but
[27:49] he's done uh it for me I hope I remember
[27:52] to keep switching this
[27:53] but uh wonderful saints of God we just
[27:57] appreciate you the hospitality the
[27:59] fellowship has just been Rich so we
[28:02] trust that the Lord will bless you
[28:04] so uh this morning I was I was highly
[28:08] strong listening to brother Chad saying
[28:10] I must relax
[28:12] and shoulders were bunched because I was
[28:14] really toiling on whether to speak this
[28:17] message because you know it's so easy to
[28:19] speak a message and preachers like that
[28:22] we like to preach things that make the
[28:24] people happy but we get the most amens
[28:27] it's easy to do that there's so much to
[28:29] preach
[28:30] but this message is um
[28:33] I and and I felt led because it's I mean
[28:38] it's a closing day of special meetings
[28:40] you know I should leave here with
[28:43] something so inspirational you all feel
[28:46] so great we walk out there and hopefully
[28:48] you know go home on lunches and smiles
[28:51] on our faces but this is going to make
[28:53] us uh convicted
[28:57] and do a little introspection not just
[29:00] about ourselves but everything that's
[29:02] happening in the message
[29:04] and once again it's the types and I
[29:07] don't know how it just blended into
[29:10] who I am here I am amen so let's get
[29:15] into this message and uh maybe once I
[29:17] get in I'll get rid of all this
[29:18] tightness
[29:20] and you can keep praying for me amen so
[29:23] God bless you so you all know the story
[29:26] of
[29:27] um Jacob and Esau and as we've read in
[29:31] the scripture it's clear that ESO being
[29:34] the firstborn and I think we spoke in
[29:36] this on on Thursday night being the
[29:38] firstborn he had the right to the
[29:40] birthright which means he had the right
[29:42] to all his father's inheritance and
[29:45] Jacob would have not received anything
[29:47] uh because uh he may have been given
[29:50] something by his brother but his duty
[29:52] would have been to help his brother in
[29:55] his father's business that's how it
[29:57] would have went
[29:58] but ESO he kind of was so confident in
[30:02] himself he took it for granted
[30:05] and then when the time came it showed
[30:07] that and the Bible is saying he despised
[30:09] his Birthright
[30:10] and I'm sure he didn't actively despise
[30:13] it standing there thinking you know I
[30:15] hate this Birthright that's not what it
[30:18] means it means he didn't consider it the
[30:21] highest thing
[30:23] as Jacob did
[30:25] and Jacob was the one who was clearly
[30:27] born second and wasn't even supposed to
[30:31] get it but he he saw it as the greatest
[30:34] thing ever greater than himself
[30:36] amen
[30:37] so and I'll you know the scripture
[30:40] speaks of things like it says you know
[30:42] Jacob was a plain man those are
[30:45] those are mild words
[30:47] and because it doesn't really explain
[30:49] how plain he actually was
[30:52] and and Esau is this very religious man
[30:56] now remember we we typing
[31:00] so we got to put this into our lives
[31:01] into the Realms of the message into the
[31:03] church in every realm like our brother
[31:05] was speaking you've got to put it in so
[31:08] so ESO was a a religious man
[31:11] his father who is the type of the
[31:13] ministry respected him and loved him
[31:16] more than Jacob what does that tell you
[31:19] right he was handsome he was tall he was
[31:24] a brilliant Hunter which means he had
[31:27] gifts
[31:29] right uh and and Isaac loved him and he
[31:32] was a man of good stature he was a
[31:35] muscular broad-shouldered and very hairy
[31:39] he looked like the perfect son
[31:42] the perfect message believer
[31:45] right and he took care of his father his
[31:47] father loved venison I love venison
[31:50] um we get lots of good venison in South
[31:52] Africa
[31:54] uh but his father loved to eat that and
[31:57] yet Joseph was the uh Jacob was the one
[32:00] who stayed home and he was Mommy's boy
[32:03] right
[32:05] so Isaac the ministry of that day
[32:10] was being taken care of by Esau
[32:18] yet he despised the birthright
[32:24] Romans 9 10.
[32:26] see if I remember to go there
[32:29] Romans 9 verse 10 to 14. not only this
[32:34] but when Rebecca also had conceived by
[32:36] one even by Our Father Isaac for the
[32:39] children being not yet born neither
[32:41] having done any good or evil that the
[32:43] purpose of God according to election
[32:44] might stand not of works but of him that
[32:47] calleth it was said unto her the Elder
[32:49] Shall Serve the younger as it is written
[32:52] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[32:54] what shall we say then is there
[32:57] unrighteousness with God God forbid
[33:00] right so bear all these things in mind
[33:02] so you don't have you're not forced to
[33:04] follow in in the Bible you can just
[33:06] follow on the screen unless you can't
[33:08] read that but so because we're going to
[33:11] get through a lot and some quotes right
[33:13] so Jacob on the other hand was this
[33:15] plain man I tell you if the Bible's
[33:16] language says he was plain I mean he was
[33:19] dead boring
[33:21] right that's what it's saying there was
[33:24] nothing to him there was nothing to
[33:25] enjoy about him he had no gifts he was
[33:28] at home cooking
[33:30] he sought pottage while his brother had
[33:34] gifts he was attractive he was taking
[33:36] care of the ministry he was involved in
[33:37] the father's business this man was Jacob
[33:40] was around his mother
[33:42] right and his mother loved him but his
[33:45] mother knew something
[33:47] amen
[33:48] so he was loved by Rebecca and yet being
[33:53] a person with no outstanding gifts no
[33:57] outstanding abilities he loved the
[34:00] birthright more than anything
[34:02] it must have been
[34:04] every day thinking about it wheeling and
[34:06] dealing how do I get it what do we do
[34:08] waiting for the moment
[34:10] right
[34:11] and but clearly there was something in
[34:14] him longing before he was even conscious
[34:17] of the birthright because the Bible said
[34:19] he struggled in the womb and grabbed on
[34:21] his brother's heel
[34:23] and and the the what do they call him
[34:29] um
[34:31] the ones who would help bring forth the
[34:33] babies it's just the midwives The
[34:35] Midwives so when when the babies were
[34:37] born The Midwives saw the character and
[34:39] watched and they would tell the mothers
[34:40] this is what's happened and then they
[34:42] would give them a name like that that's
[34:44] why they chose Esau because it means red
[34:46] and then Jacob means supplanted because
[34:49] he grabbed his brother's heel he's
[34:50] trying to steal his position
[34:52] so that's how they named them it's a
[34:55] planter deceiver right and this showed
[34:58] there was more to him
[35:00] even before he knew what the birthright
[35:03] was
[35:04] he was they were struggling in the womb
[35:06] and and Rebecca's testimony was how can
[35:09] this be I was Barren I was waiting so
[35:12] long for a baby and here now I get these
[35:14] two and they're just fighting each other
[35:15] in the womb and she's struggling right
[35:19] Jacob loved both his father and mother
[35:22] the ministry of that day Esau wasn't too
[35:25] concerned with his mother
[35:27] but he wanted more Jacob wanted more
[35:30] than what was allotted to him right so I
[35:33] want to get through the story as quick
[35:34] as we can and then we'll get to the
[35:36] typing let's go to
[35:38] um Genesis 27 skipping forward to verse
[35:41] 18 to 29. now this is where it gets
[35:44] interesting because and ties in with
[35:47] what our brother Daniel was preaching
[35:49] Genesis 27 verse 18. now he's he's
[35:54] already bought
[35:56] the birthright from Esau now he feels he
[36:01] has to convince his father
[36:03] so he can get the blessing officially
[36:07] so he has to go to the ministry and get
[36:09] the approval
[36:12] and he came unto his father and said my
[36:16] father and watch Isaac
[36:18] and he said here am I
[36:21] who are thou
[36:23] my son
[36:25] the ministry is identified here am I
[36:28] now you identify yourself now watch this
[36:31] one with the birthright
[36:33] Jacob said unto his father I am Esau thy
[36:36] firstborn
[36:38] this man knows who he is but he's
[36:41] pretending to be somebody else
[36:44] in the message
[36:48] he's pretending to be the firstborn he's
[36:51] unconscious of God's prophecy that the
[36:54] birthright is actually his
[36:57] because God when he spoke to Rebecca he
[36:59] said the Elder Shall Serve the younger
[37:01] one people will be a stronger
[37:04] right so here he is in the message he's
[37:08] trying to be the older brother
[37:11] I am Esau thy firstborn he is deceiving
[37:13] the ministry
[37:16] I have done according to uh according
[37:20] arise I pray thee certain eat of my
[37:22] venison that thy soul may bless me he's
[37:25] even brought meat that is goat meat and
[37:29] lying that it's venison
[37:31] but his mother is so good at preparing
[37:34] the goat to taste like the venison
[37:38] and there even use the hair of the goat
[37:40] to disguise himself
[37:42] right
[37:43] and Isaac said unto his son how is it
[37:46] that thou has found it so quickly my son
[37:49] it's amazing you get this Revelation so
[37:51] fast
[37:53] I pray thee sit and eat of my venison my
[37:55] that thy soul may be blessed how is it
[37:57] that that was founded so quickly my son
[37:59] and he said because the Lord thy God
[38:01] brought it to me
[38:03] I mean how many lies can you tell in one
[38:06] time right
[38:07] and Isaac said unto Jacob come near I
[38:10] pray so Isaac smells a rat
[38:13] right
[38:14] come near I pray thee that I may feel
[38:17] thee my son whether thou be my very son
[38:20] ESO or not so again in the type we're
[38:23] seeing that the ministry actually
[38:25] prefers Esau and not Jacob
[38:28] the ministry in the message at the end
[38:30] time actually prefers the oldest son
[38:33] we've got to identify what that
[38:35] character is and that's amazing this is
[38:38] why they'll be so few
[38:41] in the end times staying true to the
[38:43] word because the ministry which is
[38:46] waxing old and getting blind
[38:49] is preferring the one that supports them
[38:52] according to what they need
[38:56] verse 22 and Jacob went near unto Isaac
[38:59] his father and he felt him and said the
[39:02] voices Jacob but the hands of the hands
[39:05] of Esau because he's feeling that
[39:09] you know when I look at this something
[39:11] but he's blind but how could he not feel
[39:14] this stuff strapped to him
[39:16] it should have known right
[39:19] but clearly the ministry was was getting
[39:23] so old the senses the the ability to
[39:26] discern was disappearing
[39:29] verse 23 and he discerned him see I
[39:32] didn't I didn't make that up he
[39:33] discerned him not because his hands were
[39:36] hairy
[39:37] so hands represent the things that you
[39:40] do the works
[39:41] The Works look like the firstborn
[39:45] so he discerned him not
[39:47] and he said art thou my very son Esau
[39:51] and so you can see the Ministries
[39:54] there's something off they just can't
[39:56] tell what it is right
[39:59] he said bring it near uh utter my very
[40:02] son ESO and look
[40:04] I am
[40:08] this I am
[40:11] is a wrong identification
[40:14] he's using the right words
[40:17] but he's he's getting the wrong
[40:19] identification
[40:20] The Chosen vessel
[40:23] the chosen one is identifying himself
[40:27] wrongly
[40:31] that's why I said it introspection
[40:35] and he said verse 25 bring it near to me
[40:38] and he said
[40:40] and I will eat of my son's venison that
[40:42] my soul may bless thee and he brought it
[40:45] near to him and he did eat and he
[40:47] brought him wine and he drank and his
[40:50] father Isaac said unto him still not
[40:53] fully convinced come near Naomi my son
[40:56] and kiss me kiss means Embrace hug
[41:00] right and he came near and kissed him
[41:03] and he smelled the smell of his raiment
[41:05] and blessed him so the smell
[41:08] even the anointing smell is anointing
[41:11] right
[41:12] remember the perfume of the Apothecary
[41:14] placed in the coals smell perfume it
[41:18] means anointing which means Jacob was
[41:20] even
[41:21] putting on an anointing
[41:25] and blessed him so he that anointing
[41:27] said all right this is him the smell is
[41:29] there see the smell of my son is as the
[41:33] smell of a field which the Lord had
[41:34] blessed therefore God give thee of the
[41:37] Dew of Heaven and the fatness of the
[41:39] earth and the plenty of corn and wine
[41:41] the blessing is is being given to Jacob
[41:44] though it's under false pretenses
[41:47] verse 29 let people serve thee and
[41:51] Nations bow down to thee be Lord over
[41:54] thy brethren
[41:55] and so the ministry the old and going
[41:59] blind is still preaching the blessing
[42:01] proclaiming the Liberty proclaiming The
[42:03] Blessing by prophecy according to what
[42:06] God Said to Rebecca Isaac is now echoing
[42:08] that
[42:09] right and left thy mother's sons bow
[42:13] down to thee curse should be everyone
[42:16] that cursed thee and blessed be he that
[42:19] blesseth thee which is why Esau
[42:21] eventually ends up cursed
[42:24] because Esau cursed him
[42:27] and vowed to kill him
[42:30] glory to God
[42:31] so here at first Jacob had to deny who
[42:35] he was to receive the blessing right
[42:37] this is this is the problem we've been
[42:40] hearing this weekend
[42:41] here am I
[42:43] the right place the positioning identify
[42:48] our brother said God is Desiring that
[42:52] you have a revelation of yourself
[42:55] now he has a revelation of himself but
[42:58] he's pretending to be somebody else
[43:03] right and he he had to First Act Like
[43:06] someone else to get the birthright oh
[43:08] that's what he thought he had to do
[43:10] if you have to think of it why couldn't
[43:12] he come in and say
[43:15] my father it is me Jacob this is what
[43:18] has happened between my brother and I he
[43:20] doesn't want the birthright he's legally
[43:22] sold it to me now I'm asking you to
[43:25] bless me and give it to me because I
[43:27] have rightfully inherited it from him
[43:29] and he has relinquished it that would
[43:31] have been honest right he if you think
[43:34] today but clearly at that time he
[43:36] thought it wouldn't work
[43:39] he thought the ministry is definitely
[43:41] not going to respect me it's not going
[43:43] to recognize me uh and I and they're
[43:45] going to ostracize me they're going to
[43:47] put me out
[43:48] and that's exactly how you and I think
[43:53] you'd rather go with the crowd
[43:58] and he thought if he did not it would
[44:00] look like he would not be recognized so
[44:03] he had to behave like somebody else whom
[44:05] he judged and everyone else did was
[44:09] better than him
[44:11] by all standards everybody felt
[44:14] including Jacob that his brother's
[44:16] mannerisms his brother's gift his
[44:18] brother's smell was better than his and
[44:21] more favorable
[44:23] verse 23 Isaac did not discern so we
[44:26] know even the ministry
[44:29] likes everything about Esau more than
[44:33] Jacob
[44:34] right
[44:35] so it looks like he is the you know
[44:39] um on the one hand looks so admirable of
[44:41] Jacob to want the birthright we've heard
[44:43] that being preached he loved it so much
[44:45] and and to us now it looks like he is
[44:48] the real message believer because he
[44:49] loved the birthright more than anything
[44:51] else and this is true he is the real
[44:53] message believer
[44:55] but this is only the beginning of his
[44:57] story and the beginning of his problems
[45:00] he used his Fallen nature Jacob to start
[45:05] with his name was wrong
[45:10] and I think when I think about it that's
[45:12] the problem
[45:13] when I come into the message I'm still
[45:15] holding the wrong name which they named
[45:17] me at my my conception my birth
[45:20] and that's the reason why I'm not
[45:23] identifying myself properly at first
[45:27] because I need to meet the angel and get
[45:30] the name changed and then I'm going to
[45:31] identify myself properly so I'm not
[45:33] really comfortable with my initial
[45:35] identity I come into the message with
[45:37] somehow or not I'm so uneasy I'm I'm I'm
[45:41] feeling better being ESO
[45:47] he could not see that God was willing to
[45:49] look Beyond his own natural laws God was
[45:52] willing to look Beyond his laws on the
[45:54] birthright and the firstborn which God
[45:57] was so strict on
[45:58] but it was God was willing and and Jacob
[46:01] couldn't see that because of everything
[46:03] presented to him in the natural
[46:07] amen God was willing to look Beyond his
[46:10] laws to give Jacob the birthright and
[46:12] The Inheritance because Jacob loved the
[46:14] birthright with all his heart and with
[46:16] all his soul
[46:17] Jacob also didn't know that he was the
[46:20] predestinated one to the birthright
[46:22] right that's why he was behaving like
[46:24] this being trapped Naturally by being
[46:27] born second
[46:30] I mean from the very beginning being
[46:33] born second you're already past passed
[46:36] up
[46:36] right
[46:38] he lived his life not knowing that he
[46:40] was the true heir of all things
[46:42] after his deception of his father and
[46:45] Esau he still doesn't see his worth
[46:48] he he flees
[46:50] I mean he's got the blessing he's he's
[46:53] got the birthright and the blessing he
[46:56] can actually take his place and and even
[46:58] though his father found out eventually
[47:02] he could stay and say listen it's done
[47:04] it's too late
[47:05] I can take my place now there's nothing
[47:07] you or anyone can do about it
[47:10] instead you still can't deal with it he
[47:12] flees
[47:14] from his family and his mother actually
[47:16] helps him
[47:19] he lived his life on the Run constantly
[47:21] trying to be somebody else but deep
[47:23] inside him there was a desire to put his
[47:25] Birthright to use
[47:27] also deep inside that Fallen nature was
[47:29] leading him into situations that would
[47:32] give him more of a bad time right like
[47:34] cheating his father-in-law of the cattle
[47:36] in the livestock
[47:38] right but what he didn't know uh that
[47:41] because of the predestinated seed in his
[47:43] heart his Fallen nature was only playing
[47:46] a part to drive him back to his
[47:49] inheritance and to take what was
[47:51] rightfully his
[47:52] but he needed to change his thinking
[47:57] in his heart because as you think in
[48:00] your heart so you are
[48:04] and so I preached this under a series
[48:07] called
[48:08] getting a higher level of thinking
[48:12] which is what we need to do in this time
[48:16] the the revelation of the word must not
[48:19] just come into our soul it must filter
[48:20] out into our spirit into our mind and
[48:24] literally change our thinking it must
[48:26] transform our reasoning
[48:29] we can't be cowards anymore
[48:32] amen we've got to realize I'm the chosen
[48:35] one
[48:36] I've got the message I don't have to
[48:38] cower from others who are putting me
[48:40] down
[48:42] let's go to Genesis 28 12-16
[48:48] right this is the beginning the coming
[48:49] of the Lord to Jacob as we spoke
[48:51] yesterday
[48:53] and he dreamed and beholden let us set
[48:54] up on the earth and the top of it
[48:56] reached to heaven and behold the angels
[48:57] of God ascending and descending please
[48:59] don't mind if I read quickly
[49:01] I know my my mother's not going to enjoy
[49:03] that she always tells me you read too
[49:05] fast
[49:06] and she's listening somewhere
[49:09] behold the Lord stood above it and said
[49:11] I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father
[49:13] and the god of Isaac the land we are on
[49:16] thou lies to thee will I give it thee
[49:18] and to thy seed so look in this first
[49:20] coming of the Lord to him
[49:21] God himself is revealing to Jacob now
[49:24] I'm giving it to you
[49:26] I am for you
[49:29] you know you're sitting in charge you're
[49:30] getting that Revelation and you you're
[49:32] feeling that Vindication inside you are
[49:35] the chosen one you're receiving the
[49:37] Revelation you may not be like Esau you
[49:40] may not have that anointing you may not
[49:41] have all the abilities but you are the
[49:44] chosen one and God is confirming it
[49:45] inside
[49:46] verse 14 and I see it shall be as the
[49:49] dust of the earth look at the blessings
[49:50] and to the
[49:52] um to the west of the East and to the
[49:54] north and to the South Indian inaisy
[49:56] shall all the families of the earth be
[49:58] blessed and behold I am with thee and
[50:03] will keep thee in all places with our
[50:05] goals and will bring thee again into
[50:07] this land the promise the prophecy that
[50:10] you will come back to this land you will
[50:12] be here even after that why not turn
[50:15] around and say okay let's go back now
[50:16] God has confirmed it nope
[50:19] still running
[50:21] for I will not leave thee until I have
[50:23] done that which I have spoken to thee of
[50:25] if God speaks that way it's going to be
[50:27] done verse 16 and Jacob awaked out of
[50:30] his sleep and said surely the Lord in
[50:31] this place is in this place and I knew
[50:33] it not
[50:35] right
[50:37] amen so God confirms his Covenant with
[50:39] Jacob shows him that all that he did in
[50:41] his life was because the predestinated
[50:43] seed was driving him to do it and to do
[50:46] it to bring him to his purpose to he's
[50:49] full he's calling right
[50:51] let's go to chapter 32 verse 24 to 31
[50:54] and this is that second coming you spoke
[50:56] of yesterday
[50:57] Jacob was left alone there Wrestled a
[50:59] man with him until the break of day when
[51:01] he saw that he prevailed not against him
[51:03] he touched the angel saw that the angel
[51:07] was not prevailing against Jacob right
[51:10] clearly he had some Talent
[51:14] some ability to Prevail against the
[51:16] angel that the angel had to cheat
[51:23] crippling I mean that's cheating in
[51:25] wrestling
[51:26] for making him lame right
[51:28] and the hollow of Jacob's style was out
[51:30] of joint that's not fair
[51:33] right and he wrestled with him and said
[51:35] let me go still with
[51:38] with this crippling he still doesn't
[51:40] want to let him go he'd show the
[51:42] character in him no matter what trial
[51:45] there is no matter how you've broken
[51:46] down
[51:47] that predestinated seat is not going to
[51:50] let go of that Birthright glory to God
[51:53] he said let me go come on it was the
[51:56] whole night surely you should be tired
[51:58] it's the breaking of the day let me go
[52:00] said I will not let thee go until you
[52:03] bless me verse 27.
[52:06] said unto him what is Thy Name there it
[52:08] is brother
[52:09] this is the first time he said Jacob
[52:14] every time else he was pretending to be
[52:16] Esau
[52:17] it's like the break of day Lord
[52:20] I'm Jacob
[52:23] and he said thy name shall be called No
[52:26] More Jacob
[52:27] but Israel it's at this point he goes
[52:31] back home
[52:33] as a as a prince thou has power with God
[52:36] and with men and has prevailed amen and
[52:40] Jacob called the name of the place oh
[52:42] and Jacob said unto him tell me I pray
[52:44] thee thy name so there's another thing
[52:47] he's not interested in just his name
[52:51] he's interested in divine nature okay
[52:54] I'm okay with my new heart of Flesh
[52:56] thank you for that but
[52:58] I want some divine nature
[53:01] what is your name
[53:03] and he says
[53:05] um wherefore is it that thou Dost ask
[53:07] after my name
[53:10] and he blessed him there and Jacob
[53:12] called the name of the place pineal for
[53:14] I have seen God face to face and my life
[53:16] is preserved and he passed over penual
[53:18] the son Rose upon him and he halted upon
[53:21] his thigh so from there on even his
[53:24] character change he even had less
[53:26] ability
[53:29] now he's crippled
[53:31] now he's got a limp
[53:33] this man does not look like an heir
[53:36] he does can you imagine now limping
[53:40] going toward Esau and say well I'm the
[53:43] one with the bus right now you have to
[53:45] relinquish everything you've been living
[53:46] here in my land for so long
[53:49] now here I am I'm I'm come to reclaim it
[53:53] he went fine he went away fine he comes
[53:56] back with the limp given to him by God
[53:59] who promised him everything
[54:03] when the seventh seal opened from his
[54:07] life when it broke away he recognized
[54:09] the coming of the Lord for the first
[54:11] time he can be honest who are you what
[54:14] is your name what is your character he
[54:16] lied to the ministry he lied he cheated
[54:19] he did everything he possibly could he
[54:22] lied he he created ability put on Harry
[54:26] he he he brought in gold for venison
[54:29] he was doing what the church said we
[54:31] must do then he even put on a false
[54:34] anointing
[54:35] to smell like Esau the firstborn and
[54:39] it's still he wasn't comfortable with it
[54:40] but he had to do it he failed to get the
[54:43] bus right
[54:43] and this is the first time I am Jacob
[54:48] he answers strong and honestly openly
[54:51] admitting his Fallen nature the acts of
[54:54] his past there's no reason to be
[54:56] deceitful in the presence of the Lord
[54:57] then the word gives him a new name a new
[55:02] fleshly nature this is the turning point
[55:04] in the life of a Believer this is when
[55:07] the word starts opening up to you and
[55:09] you realize I don't need to pretend
[55:11] anymore
[55:12] amen but he is not just after a new
[55:16] fleshly nature he is interested in the
[55:19] hidden word what is thy name
[55:23] glory to God he's after that divine
[55:25] nature not just interested in
[55:28] inheritance of this Earth of Church of
[55:31] the message I mean I'm interested in
[55:33] Divine inheritance I'm interested in
[55:36] Eternal inheritance
[55:38] it's almost like the birthright on Earth
[55:40] is not enough for him that's his main
[55:42] character and his only positive thing
[55:44] about him he is so interested in the
[55:46] inheritance of God
[55:50] he wants to inherit all things
[55:52] that's a real Heir he wants it all amen
[55:57] Heaven and Earth
[55:59] for this he was blessed abundantly given
[56:02] strength to go on overcome the Esau of
[56:04] his day he would he could go back to his
[56:07] inheritance put everything under his
[56:09] objection and that nature that he once
[56:11] pretended to be he now has a new nature
[56:14] a prince with God
[56:16] he knows to start living up to that can
[56:18] you imagine going back to Esurance and
[56:21] and ESO comes to him and says Jacob I'm
[56:23] so happy to see you hold on it's Israel
[56:30] amen as a man thinketh in his heart
[56:33] so is he
[56:36] Proverbs 23 7. exactly who you think you
[56:40] are
[56:41] is exactly who you will be
[56:44] God needs to change our thinking the
[56:47] word that you receive needs to change
[56:48] your thinking we cannot be imitating the
[56:51] Esau's neither can we be remaining
[56:54] Jacobs we need to become Israel
[56:58] glory to God Matthew 15 7-9 you
[57:02] Hypocrites welded Isaiah the prophet
[57:05] prophesy of you saying uh verse 8 this
[57:08] people draw an eye onto me with their
[57:10] mouths and honor me with their lips but
[57:12] their heart is far from me but in vain
[57:14] they do worship me teaching for
[57:15] doctrines the Commandments of men that
[57:18] is Esau Behavior
[57:21] and that is Jacob imitating Esau
[57:24] Behavior
[57:25] right that's
[57:27] now we've got to be honest with
[57:29] ourselves right
[57:30] okay this was one of the themes of the
[57:33] Lord's message do you know in the first
[57:34] coming Christ's message was all about
[57:36] what's in your heart
[57:38] right in Matthew Chapter 5 when he when
[57:40] he was preaching The Sermon on the Mount
[57:41] and he started saying thou Moses said
[57:44] thou shall not kill but I say unto you
[57:46] if you're angry with your brother
[57:47] without a cause he was going straight to
[57:49] what's in the heart
[57:50] says Moses said You shall you can marry
[57:54] again for this and that and he said but
[57:56] I say unto you if you look upon a woman
[57:58] to lust after you've committed adultery
[58:00] and and so on he Christ was going to the
[58:03] heart
[58:04] right that was his ministry let's look
[58:06] at it Matthew 5 28
[58:08] but I say unto you that whosoever
[58:09] looketh on a woman to lust after her
[58:11] hath committed adultery with her already
[58:14] in his heart
[58:16] Mark 11 23 for verily I say unto you
[58:19] that whosoever shall say unto this
[58:20] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[58:22] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[58:24] his heart shall not doubt in his heart
[58:28] but shall believe that those things
[58:29] which he shall we say it shall come to
[58:31] pass he shall have whatsoever he saith
[58:34] in his heart
[58:36] he's not interested in the Esau Behavior
[58:40] that what's in your heart needs to be
[58:42] seen Matthew 13 19 when anyone Hearth
[58:45] the word of the kingdom and
[58:46] understandeth it not then cometh the
[58:49] wicked one capture the way that which
[58:50] was sown in his heart this is he which
[58:54] received seed by the wayside
[58:57] Christ's Ministry was directed at in the
[59:00] heart as you think in your heart so are
[59:03] you Matthew 24 48
[59:06] but and if that evil servant shall say
[59:09] in his heart my Lord delaying his coming
[59:15] see why because God knows Christ knows
[59:19] people on the outside are going to say
[59:20] oh yeah you know I believe he's here but
[59:24] inside
[59:26] that's who you really are if that's your
[59:29] thinking on the inside you're not living
[59:31] true to yourself you're being an Esau
[59:35] amen that's the problem here that's why
[59:38] I say this is introspection
[59:41] so the prophet brings this concept in
[59:43] from a cigarette box
[59:46] a thinking man's filter
[59:49] right let's look at it I want to get
[59:51] through it quickly too uh let's go to
[59:53] the last paragraph there of paragraph 38
[59:56] right at the last three lines I looked
[59:59] at that thing I I'm just flying because
[1:00:01] I know you know the story right I look
[1:00:03] at that thing and I thought a thinking
[1:00:05] man's filter I thought if the man could
[1:00:08] think at all he wouldn't smoke at all
[1:00:10] how could it be a thinking man's filter
[1:00:12] a thinking man wouldn't smoke at all
[1:00:14] right so what he's showing is that this
[1:00:17] advertisement is a deception
[1:00:21] right he uncovers this deception that
[1:00:23] the enemy puts before a man he says that
[1:00:25] a real thinking man would not smoke in
[1:00:28] the first place right the advertisement
[1:00:30] was propagating a healthier cigarette
[1:00:33] healthier cigarette
[1:00:35] I was trying to say that it was a better
[1:00:37] filter for a thinking man than other
[1:00:40] cigarettes than an intelligent man would
[1:00:42] choose this cigarette because it's a
[1:00:43] better filter and still gives the
[1:00:46] desired taste brother Ram said it's lies
[1:00:48] because the filter actually removed the
[1:00:51] deadly stuff you couldn't even get the
[1:00:53] smoke if he said if the filter removed
[1:00:55] all the deadly stuff you wouldn't get
[1:00:56] the smoke so the filter is just a bluff
[1:00:59] amen and that's the problem with the
[1:01:02] church he said the same deceit is in the
[1:01:05] church
[1:01:06] let's read
[1:01:08] and I stood there looking at it and I
[1:01:10] think of how deceitful it was the
[1:01:12] question came to me and I stoop back
[1:01:13] look at the back again as it just seemed
[1:01:15] like some something said to me but the
[1:01:17] slogan is all right a thinking man's
[1:01:19] filter a smoking man's taste it came to
[1:01:22] me that that deceitfulness also in the
[1:01:25] realm day in tobacco is something on
[1:01:28] order of the churches of today see a
[1:01:30] deceitfulness
[1:01:32] paragraph 58 and 59
[1:01:36] uh like the tobacco companies I want to
[1:01:38] get to the yes the underlying portion
[1:01:40] each denomination has their own filter
[1:01:43] and they filter out all the true
[1:01:45] Christians that would say Amen when he
[1:01:48] was preaching
[1:01:49] and bring in all the bobbed hair and
[1:01:51] painted Jezebels and so on particle 59
[1:01:53] the people they know what they want
[1:01:57] so if they have to get what they want
[1:02:00] they'll have a certain kind of a filter
[1:02:02] and enough of the world speak through to
[1:02:05] satisfy their worldly taste now he's
[1:02:08] talking about denomination we feel
[1:02:10] comfortable hey we dressed right we
[1:02:12] behave right we've got the standards
[1:02:14] right we're doing everything right let
[1:02:16] me tell you something in the message
[1:02:17] there are message filters
[1:02:22] he's speaking here to the laodicean
[1:02:24] church he says they want to be religious
[1:02:26] because they have a soul but they still
[1:02:28] want to have their Taste Of Life what is
[1:02:30] it that the message people want what is
[1:02:33] it that the message ministers want
[1:02:36] eventually because we know there are
[1:02:39] twins
[1:02:40] and every Revival produces twins
[1:02:43] the first brother is always going to be
[1:02:45] the favored one
[1:02:47] but he's not the one who's going to
[1:02:49] receive the open book in the end
[1:02:51] each denomination claims to have the
[1:02:54] best filter but the stuff that brings
[1:02:56] out spiritual cancer it's a lie because
[1:02:59] you can see where it heads up they just
[1:03:01] go into immorality Hollywood is now on
[1:03:03] the Pentecostal churches the baptism of
[1:03:06] the Holy Ghost is a mockery it's cancer
[1:03:08] and you can see how fast it is today
[1:03:10] especially with the internet which
[1:03:12] metastasizes the cancer
[1:03:14] right it starts there before you know it
[1:03:17] if you start here in America it's in
[1:03:20] Africa in five minutes
[1:03:24] right and even Australia that is further
[1:03:26] it's still in the same time
[1:03:28] that's how fast it metastasizes anything
[1:03:31] that happens in your chart if it's if it
[1:03:33] happens in TD Jake's church it's
[1:03:34] happening in South Africa in five
[1:03:36] minutes they're like they're like tapped
[1:03:38] in
[1:03:41] that's how fast it is
[1:03:43] and that's happening now in the message
[1:03:46] because you can you can see people
[1:03:48] Gathering
[1:03:51] who which ministers associate together
[1:03:53] which
[1:03:55] where we're more comfortable
[1:03:58] that's showing a filter
[1:04:04] if the people didn't get what they want
[1:04:06] they want out of their religion then
[1:04:08] they just take a different one
[1:04:10] but how this has changed in the message
[1:04:12] is what we need to see today we have
[1:04:14] perfected our Esau
[1:04:16] our upward attractive message Natures we
[1:04:20] have driven out all the tastes of the
[1:04:21] world The Taste for the world and we
[1:04:23] look like we are perfect and better than
[1:04:26] denominations but each message church
[1:04:28] has its own filter for the revelation of
[1:04:31] the word now look at our filters I'll
[1:04:34] just give you a few don't worry about
[1:04:36] the Deep things
[1:04:38] just get the ABCs right
[1:04:41] who told you that
[1:04:44] where did you get that from
[1:04:45] just because you're afraid to get into
[1:04:48] the word to put your foot in Jordan you
[1:04:50] think you're safe
[1:04:52] just keeping the ABCs let me tell you
[1:04:55] something that's a lie
[1:04:58] whoever thinks he can keep the ABCs and
[1:05:00] keep standards of the message you're
[1:05:02] lying to yourself because nobody can do
[1:05:04] it
[1:05:05] nobody can do it perfectly
[1:05:08] look at the filters as long as you live
[1:05:10] the life you have the evidence of the
[1:05:13] Resurrection
[1:05:15] another lie
[1:05:17] what is living the life according to the
[1:05:19] type Jacob was living life
[1:05:24] as long as you apply the token over your
[1:05:26] household you'll make it so what is
[1:05:28] applying the token
[1:05:31] they thought
[1:05:33] oh Lord Jesus I apply the token over my
[1:05:36] house Lord may they receive the Holy
[1:05:38] Ghost blessed be your name that's it my
[1:05:40] family's safe
[1:05:43] how about this filter as long as you
[1:05:46] have the emotions the Holy Ghost and the
[1:05:48] gifts in operation you have the right
[1:05:50] way
[1:05:51] because that must vindicate the word
[1:05:53] that's coming
[1:05:54] you must have all the prophecies I I
[1:05:57] heard one one Minister speaking there in
[1:05:59] Africa who said a pasta must have a
[1:06:02] supernatural Vindication with him the
[1:06:04] power of fire something he must have he
[1:06:07] must have prophecy or something
[1:06:10] where'd he get there from
[1:06:12] but it's a filter and because it works
[1:06:16] for them to get more Esau's
[1:06:19] they're going to keep at it because Esau
[1:06:22] is going to keep giving back venison
[1:06:25] and ability and taking care of the
[1:06:28] ministry while the ministry is losing
[1:06:31] discernment
[1:06:32] unable to see who is the one that God is
[1:06:36] predestinated to get the birthright
[1:06:39] the ministry is going blind the ministry
[1:06:42] can still smell can see the anointing
[1:06:44] can feel the works but losing the
[1:06:47] discernment to see who are the chosen
[1:06:50] ones you know the prophet said there's
[1:06:52] going to be a lot of people there that
[1:06:53] you didn't expect to be there
[1:06:56] you know that right
[1:06:58] so there's nothing wrong with applying
[1:07:00] the token I think a lot of people don't
[1:07:02] know what the token is
[1:07:03] if you know the life is in the blood and
[1:07:06] where is the blood of God
[1:07:09] the prophet said the blood of God went
[1:07:11] back to being the word
[1:07:14] so where's the token it's in the word
[1:07:16] because the blood of God is in the word
[1:07:20] applying the token is not a feeling it's
[1:07:22] not an emotion it's not a type of
[1:07:23] behavior it's not just speaking the
[1:07:26] words Holy Ghost Holy Ghost it's not
[1:07:28] signs and wonders it's not gifts of the
[1:07:31] Spirit we know those things were not
[1:07:33] even that which is perfect how can that
[1:07:36] be the token
[1:07:40] the token is the person of the Holy
[1:07:42] Ghost
[1:07:47] right you know how trained we are
[1:07:49] to be Esau's because as your child is
[1:07:53] growing you even think the solution to
[1:07:55] your child becoming the most spiritual
[1:07:57] thinking person is to get the Holy Ghost
[1:08:01] and the wrong impression of the Holy
[1:08:03] Ghost because because you're catering to
[1:08:06] what you see
[1:08:08] so you assume the Holy Ghost is them
[1:08:11] standing in front raising their hands
[1:08:13] singing louder uh behaving emotional
[1:08:17] crying with tears doing all now I'm not
[1:08:19] saying that's not good because any
[1:08:21] person who has the real word inside is
[1:08:24] going to have some kind of emotion
[1:08:27] but putting on a show
[1:08:29] behaving like an Esau when you know you
[1:08:32] are a Jacob
[1:08:36] that's a problem
[1:08:39] and you expecting your child to behave
[1:08:41] like an Esau when really his desires
[1:08:44] when that word gets hooked in him
[1:08:47] that's what it's going to take that's
[1:08:49] where his his Revival is going to be but
[1:08:52] you're forcing him to be an Esau
[1:08:56] more abilities
[1:08:58] more anointing
[1:09:02] we know where that is that's the
[1:09:04] firstborn
[1:09:05] right the one who is preferred
[1:09:08] even by Isaac
[1:09:11] so here's what's happening in these last
[1:09:13] days men have advertised the message
[1:09:16] life with filters upon the revealed word
[1:09:19] there's nothing wrong with the ABCs but
[1:09:22] are you just being a Jacob trapped as an
[1:09:24] Esau to conform to something when you
[1:09:26] know there is so much more to you
[1:09:29] and that you are trapped by your natural
[1:09:31] circumstances
[1:09:33] right
[1:09:34] so in these days
[1:09:36] living the life filters people feel like
[1:09:39] and this is what happens in the church
[1:09:40] people feel like they are getting what
[1:09:42] they want I'm happy with my church it's
[1:09:44] so comfortable secure lifestyle secure
[1:09:47] marriages wives and children are under
[1:09:49] control pastors will help you make all
[1:09:52] your decisions for you security of
[1:09:54] making it in the Rapture books and
[1:09:56] messages of the Prophet a wonderful
[1:09:58] church with people who love each other
[1:09:59] stand up for one another provide
[1:10:02] Marriage Partners for the other for our
[1:10:04] children to allow our lifestyles to
[1:10:06] continue
[1:10:08] and you start ending up with a whole
[1:10:10] bunch of actors
[1:10:13] what do we do as a church we assume as
[1:10:16] the church we must control the dressing
[1:10:18] we must control the behavior of our men
[1:10:20] and women thinking
[1:10:22] if you control the dressing
[1:10:25] and and the behavior of our men and
[1:10:27] women we Bluff ourselves it's a filter
[1:10:30] if we do that there won't be any lust
[1:10:33] come on
[1:10:36] go ask the Muslims you can be covered
[1:10:39] head to toe and filled with lust
[1:10:42] all right yeah
[1:10:44] and you make it about that that's not
[1:10:47] where it's going to go if your son does
[1:10:49] not have an experience with a revealed
[1:10:51] word in this day his heart is going to
[1:10:54] be overtaken by the Beast nature he it's
[1:10:58] natural to feel attraction to the
[1:11:00] opposite sex
[1:11:01] but you need the revelation of God to be
[1:11:04] able to control that
[1:11:06] right Faking It is not going to control
[1:11:09] it dressing different is not going to
[1:11:11] control it
[1:11:13] but Esau's are comfortable with that
[1:11:19] but if that was the correct thing then
[1:11:21] why then we wouldn't see such a
[1:11:23] breakdown of marriages all over the
[1:11:24] message
[1:11:25] children backsliding breakdown of
[1:11:28] Brotherhood in the church dictatorship
[1:11:30] of pastors and Ministry slowly we can
[1:11:33] see with the with the observant eye that
[1:11:36] we had a filter a cover for what was
[1:11:38] really inside of people even to the
[1:11:40] point of ministers fall into adultery
[1:11:43] immorality is rising in the church
[1:11:44] ministers fall into a filthy Luca love
[1:11:48] for money love for popularity what's
[1:11:50] happening we're realizing we're
[1:11:52] surrounded by more Esau's
[1:11:56] and it shocks us when we hear things we
[1:11:58] think how could it be really respected
[1:12:01] that man you're standing there you're
[1:12:03] thinking I really wanted to be like him
[1:12:08] it's the greatest deception among our
[1:12:10] people
[1:12:12] but whatever is in your heart in your
[1:12:14] soul is what will affect your body and
[1:12:17] show its true nature your soul is the
[1:12:19] nature of who you are it is the answer
[1:12:21] to the question who are you
[1:12:26] it is she
[1:12:30] but the soul draws its resources from
[1:12:33] the body and the spirit amen it draws
[1:12:35] its resource it can the Soul can only
[1:12:37] manifest its nature through the body and
[1:12:39] the spirit
[1:12:40] right because Adam became a living Soul
[1:12:43] when he received a body
[1:12:46] was he a dead soul in Genesis 1 26 27
[1:12:51] . he had a soul there in theophany right
[1:12:54] all it means is that when the fleshly
[1:12:56] body was broadened he was now able to
[1:12:58] manifest the nature publicly that's how
[1:13:01] he became a living Soul right so no
[1:13:04] matter how you anoint the body in the
[1:13:06] spirit if your soul does not consist of
[1:13:08] the word you just have a religious
[1:13:10] filter
[1:13:11] with a worldly man's taste
[1:13:15] that's the hypocrisy of sin let's read
[1:13:18] I think your man's filter pack of 108
[1:13:20] notice the word cannot deny itself then
[1:13:23] it is satisfied or is the desire it's a
[1:13:25] desire of what what made you desire it
[1:13:28] in the first place because down in your
[1:13:30] soul there was a predestinated seed
[1:13:32] which was eternal life always laying in
[1:13:34] there always washing them all that the
[1:13:36] father has given me will come to me
[1:13:38] there isn't any of them going to be lost
[1:13:40] a thinking man's taste when a thinking
[1:13:42] man hears the word of God my sheep hear
[1:13:45] my voice a stranger they will not follow
[1:13:47] for down in there is life and life
[1:13:49] connects with life sin connects with sin
[1:13:51] and sin is so hypocritical until it
[1:13:54] thinks that it's saved
[1:13:57] when it isn't saved
[1:13:59] it's the very depths of hypocrisy
[1:14:04] so you see in the message we got so used
[1:14:06] to sin being like the denominations
[1:14:10] sin thinks it's saved
[1:14:13] this is amazing you see there's a
[1:14:15] problem with the man he wants to live in
[1:14:17] this world and still believe that he's
[1:14:18] safe with God
[1:14:20] right
[1:14:21] that's the problem we have today so he
[1:14:23] does what he wants to and uses religion
[1:14:25] as a filter they they say I can do what
[1:14:29] I want but as long as I be religious I
[1:14:31] can filter out sin
[1:14:33] but religion is created around
[1:14:34] worldliness
[1:14:37] so how can it be a true filter
[1:14:39] religion is the white horse rider
[1:14:43] it's it's the Imposter
[1:14:46] the first seal
[1:14:48] the first uh problem for the church was
[1:14:51] the white horse rider
[1:14:54] so here's what he means by sin
[1:14:56] connecting with sin if you really have
[1:14:58] the seed in you and you have the right
[1:15:00] filter you won't connect with the
[1:15:02] attributes of sin does this so in other
[1:15:04] words you don't need to act
[1:15:07] if you have the word the right seed
[1:15:09] inside you won't connect with sin
[1:15:12] and even if you fall you'll put yourself
[1:15:15] right you'll come back in because you
[1:15:18] get the right seed inside
[1:15:20] right so do we need a filter yes we do
[1:15:24] this the first two dimensions of us
[1:15:26] these these uh body and spirit is
[1:15:29] seriously messed up because we came
[1:15:31] through our parents Gene we do need a
[1:15:33] filter what is the filter the correct
[1:15:36] filter is the revealed word of the hour
[1:15:38] the open book before that Jacob was
[1:15:41] Jacob and Esau but when the coming of
[1:15:45] the Lord when the promise is open when
[1:15:46] he has a name change then he becomes
[1:15:49] Israel from there on he can take his
[1:15:51] position
[1:15:52] prior to that you're just active
[1:15:57] thinking man's filter again paragraph 95
[1:15:59] oh yes the word of God is a thinking
[1:16:01] man's filter anyone knows that that's
[1:16:03] what your soul is filtered through the
[1:16:05] word of God it makes you no no no young
[1:16:08] people say oh there it goes again the
[1:16:10] word of God everything is the word the
[1:16:11] word the word that's the solution that's
[1:16:14] what we're going to do that's what we're
[1:16:15] going to read that's what we're going to
[1:16:16] be word word word word
[1:16:19] sorry to disappoint
[1:16:22] Noah's date would have been Ark Ark Ark
[1:16:25] Ark
[1:16:29] whether it was boring or not that's all
[1:16:32] you had
[1:16:34] when a thinking man comes to God's fault
[1:16:36] it gives him a holy man's taste that's
[1:16:38] right when you come through God's filter
[1:16:40] then your taste is a holy man's taste it
[1:16:42] makes a righteous man taste the slogan
[1:16:45] certainly is okay brother agreed with
[1:16:47] the slogan on a cigarette box
[1:16:52] but made better
[1:16:56] I want to draw on that point you cannot
[1:16:58] do this by your work Saints God has to
[1:17:02] First change your thinking you have to
[1:17:04] come to that point where you admit Lord
[1:17:07] I'm just a Jacob
[1:17:10] and wrestle it out
[1:17:12] sweat it out amen
[1:17:15] praise be to God
[1:17:16] he has to change your thinking if you
[1:17:18] think you are supposed to be an Esau you
[1:17:21] will constantly be drawing on a weak
[1:17:23] filter
[1:17:25] it's not going to bring you to your
[1:17:26] position in Christ you'll be running
[1:17:28] away all your life
[1:17:31] young man when you get this revelation
[1:17:34] of the message
[1:17:37] you'll you'll become a preacher you'll
[1:17:40] become a real Witness
[1:17:42] you know we go to to youth camps
[1:17:45] and we ask young people
[1:17:48] you know what do you want to be how many
[1:17:49] of you want to be accountants oh
[1:17:52] hands go up how many of you want to
[1:17:53] study this let's go up how many of you
[1:17:56] want to be a doctor hands go up how many
[1:17:58] of you want to be a pastor
[1:18:03] that's what happens everyone starts
[1:18:06] laughing at them with one one boy's hand
[1:18:09] goes up and everyone everyone looks at
[1:18:10] him ah hey not you
[1:18:14] and then how many of you want to be a
[1:18:16] Deacon's wife
[1:18:17] and and like eight girls you know and
[1:18:20] everyone looks them laughing at them
[1:18:24] because it's almost like you shouldn't
[1:18:25] desire that
[1:18:27] no one laughed when someone put up their
[1:18:29] hands to be a doctor an accountant
[1:18:30] lawyer or work or something and then you
[1:18:33] feel your children like
[1:18:35] uh and so like what brother Daniel was
[1:18:38] saying these are important things why
[1:18:40] shouldn't the children desire to be a
[1:18:42] pastor one day desire to be a Deacon's
[1:18:45] wife one day because it's in you to
[1:18:46] support the church to be a part of the
[1:18:49] purpose to perpetuate the message to
[1:18:51] look care to take care of the Next
[1:18:53] Generation why shouldn't you growing up
[1:18:55] think I need to keep myself keep my
[1:18:58] virginity because I'm going to be a
[1:19:00] pastor's wife one day I'm going to be a
[1:19:02] pastor one day I'm going to be a deacon
[1:19:04] one day I'm gonna be a song leader one
[1:19:06] day why can't I have that ambition
[1:19:10] there's no shaming that
[1:19:13] you get a hold of the word and you're
[1:19:15] going to feel God's purpose resting on
[1:19:17] you and you're going to know this is
[1:19:18] good as long as I live whoever I'm going
[1:19:21] to marry is going to be part of that
[1:19:23] Commission because I know I'm being I'm
[1:19:25] being prepared for something
[1:19:27] but if you don't have that you're just
[1:19:30] going with the flow being an Esau
[1:19:33] waiting for something to happen people
[1:19:35] ask you I lied or no
[1:19:38] listen I was a Jacob
[1:19:40] I know that I felt the call inside my
[1:19:44] heart and I denied it all the way up
[1:19:46] until God took the rug out from under me
[1:19:50] so at to the point where you just flop
[1:19:53] down I literally flopped down
[1:19:55] and had a brother
[1:19:58] brother Nelson guy pray over me and just
[1:20:03] that was it from then
[1:20:05] but prior to that I said no no no never
[1:20:08] going to happen
[1:20:09] career and everything I wanted trying to
[1:20:13] get away from it as far as possible uh
[1:20:15] brother Steve would ask me to preach I
[1:20:17] denied it right to the very end just
[1:20:20] wouldn't do it but yet inside
[1:20:23] I'm burning I'm seeing the revelation of
[1:20:25] the word I'm discussing the Ministries
[1:20:27] are coming ministering brothers are
[1:20:29] coming in I'm toe-to-toe with them on
[1:20:31] the word my brother Adam says this we're
[1:20:33] talking about this and these ministers
[1:20:34] looking at me and thinking do you preach
[1:20:36] in the church are you going to preach
[1:20:38] are you called eventually some of them
[1:20:40] got fed up with me and said you are
[1:20:41] called to preach
[1:20:45] and then I'd shrink away oh no you know
[1:20:47] and and change the subject I've been
[1:20:49] that
[1:20:50] and I know the pain that goes with it we
[1:20:53] have a personal chat I can tell you the
[1:20:55] pain that goes with from denying who you
[1:20:57] are oh yes I literally had my tendons
[1:21:01] taken out from me
[1:21:04] now that's that's the truth uh
[1:21:08] injured both tendons in both ankles
[1:21:12] because I felt I was going to have a
[1:21:14] life in sport someday
[1:21:16] there was my test
[1:21:18] if you consult if you constantly draw
[1:21:20] your life through the revealed word
[1:21:22] you will love the birthright like Jacob
[1:21:25] you'll wrestle with the coming of the
[1:21:27] Lord till your old nature is gone till
[1:21:29] there is nothing left in you but the
[1:21:31] Holy Ghost only the Holy Ghost can
[1:21:33] filter through the word all sin will be
[1:21:35] blocked out from entering your soul you
[1:21:37] won't compromise with unbelief it will
[1:21:40] show you naturally that you have a holy
[1:21:42] man's taste for life
[1:21:43] you need the quickening spirit to bring
[1:21:45] life to pass amen so that means you have
[1:21:48] to recognize the word for your day and
[1:21:50] that your and that your place is in the
[1:21:52] word amen it's your Birthright any
[1:21:54] inheritance that you long for
[1:21:57] thank you man's filter Park of 163 if
[1:22:00] you won't cope with the word of God and
[1:22:01] your soul don't do it then there's
[1:22:03] something wrong if it shows up you have
[1:22:05] taste the life the kind of life is in
[1:22:07] you if it's a holy discreet honorable
[1:22:08] it'll come out that way the last part
[1:22:11] shows you are a part of the word of that
[1:22:13] word that the word is in you drawing
[1:22:15] from that word amen Park of 164 what's
[1:22:20] it drawing it's drawing through the word
[1:22:23] there's the filter because you are a
[1:22:25] part of the body of Christ of this age
[1:22:27] and if that word is in you it can only
[1:22:29] draw through the word that spirit that
[1:22:31] quickens the word that's in you just the
[1:22:33] word alone won't live that's the reason
[1:22:36] all the father has given me will come to
[1:22:37] me if I be lifted up I'll draw a meant
[1:22:39] the Father the part of the body of
[1:22:41] Christ that's in the world predestinated
[1:22:43] put into your heart
[1:22:45] see how it works if you can't handle the
[1:22:48] revealed word you'll never be able to
[1:22:49] use the spoken word as a proper filter
[1:22:52] you always get it wrong
[1:22:54] you know what we're saying Saints I
[1:22:55] don't want you to be confused if you
[1:22:57] don't get the open book you won't be
[1:23:00] able to properly use the written word
[1:23:03] for your life
[1:23:05] you'll always use it as an Esau
[1:23:08] you as a pretending issue you always you
[1:23:11] you know okay let's let's speak plainly
[1:23:14] the reason why you use
[1:23:17] standards and laws of the message
[1:23:20] because you're afraid
[1:23:24] that's that's the reason and when when
[1:23:26] you get to a church where it's so strict
[1:23:28] you it's because the pastor is afraid
[1:23:32] he doesn't want the stigma of what's
[1:23:34] going to happen if someone Falls
[1:23:36] the church is a sanctuary for wounded
[1:23:41] we're not meant to have upstanding
[1:23:43] members that don't fall that don't make
[1:23:45] mistakes how do they learn how will they
[1:23:47] grow
[1:23:49] you only you only
[1:23:52] excommunicate a person if they are
[1:23:55] unrepentant
[1:23:56] you know excommunication is an act of
[1:23:59] love
[1:24:00] it's not just correction because someone
[1:24:02] did something wrong you can't
[1:24:03] excommunicate someone who has confessed
[1:24:05] to their wrong
[1:24:07] if they're not confessing they're
[1:24:09] unrepentant it means they're against the
[1:24:12] word
[1:24:13] and that's what separates you is when
[1:24:15] you're against the word
[1:24:17] right so when you get to play and those
[1:24:20] of you sitting here who are thinking
[1:24:21] like Esau's when something goes wrong
[1:24:24] you form the pasta you see somebody is
[1:24:27] doing something wrong what are you doing
[1:24:29] about it
[1:24:31] what will you do about it
[1:24:35] I've I've been in the message since I'm
[1:24:37] four or five years old I've seen it all
[1:24:39] pastors will go correct correct correct
[1:24:42] everyone correct when it's their own
[1:24:43] children they say well you know what my
[1:24:45] child hasn't had the Holy Ghost yet
[1:24:49] I've literally heard that
[1:24:52] so we can kind of move around it you
[1:24:54] know we're just waiting for him to have
[1:24:55] the Holy Ghost
[1:24:57] what about the other person's children
[1:24:58] that you kicked out that you ostracized
[1:25:01] that you got rid of
[1:25:03] that you spoke about
[1:25:05] that the other cliques spoke about
[1:25:08] stop doing that you're teaching your
[1:25:10] children to be Esau's the more pressure
[1:25:12] you apply like that the more you want to
[1:25:14] make them fake it
[1:25:17] they want to fake it but inside their
[1:25:19] heart they just can't wait to get away
[1:25:21] from you
[1:25:23] that's what we've been doing
[1:25:25] I've heard things some pastors say I
[1:25:27] will pull you into heaven if I have to
[1:25:31] what is that
[1:25:34] where did you get that from
[1:25:38] see if you're going to make those
[1:25:40] standards those rules so high
[1:25:43] and and there it is in the Bible the
[1:25:45] prophet said uh Christ said to the
[1:25:47] Pharisees you place a burden on the
[1:25:49] people too hard for them to bear and you
[1:25:51] yourself won't move a finger
[1:25:54] to bear that burden
[1:25:57] so what are we saying must we just be a
[1:25:59] liberal Church no preach the word
[1:26:03] the word will change them the word will
[1:26:06] do it and the reason why they need rules
[1:26:09] in the church is because they're not
[1:26:10] preaching the word the word is supposed
[1:26:12] to be transforming
[1:26:15] amen
[1:26:16] we don't want to conform to the message
[1:26:19] wait we started off like that
[1:26:21] we had to and we came out of
[1:26:22] denominations and come into this oh wow
[1:26:24] these people all dressed different You
[1:26:26] Came From Another conservative
[1:26:28] denomination here all these people are
[1:26:29] clapping and you
[1:26:31] you can barely get your hands together
[1:26:34] but eventually you assimilate you get
[1:26:37] used to it you fall in line you first
[1:26:40] start off like a Jacob
[1:26:42] imitating an ESO you look around you see
[1:26:45] them you're quiet everyone's hands are
[1:26:48] raised one brother is worshiping glory
[1:26:50] to God praise the Lord you said this in
[1:26:52] page 28 of Christ the ministry of God
[1:26:54] revealed and you
[1:26:56] oh I need to read Christ the ministry of
[1:26:58] God reveal I want to do that too
[1:27:01] right
[1:27:03] that brother has a wrong idea of Prayer
[1:27:06] by the way God doesn't need you to quote
[1:27:08] message back to him in prayer
[1:27:11] if you're asked to pray for the need of
[1:27:13] the people come and pray for the need of
[1:27:14] the people Don't Preach a sermon you
[1:27:16] know right so there's no need to do that
[1:27:19] if you're starting to behave and create
[1:27:20] anointing listen you're trying to put on
[1:27:23] a goat smell you're trying to put on
[1:27:25] hair on your hands you're trying to show
[1:27:27] work speak from your heart
[1:27:30] be because who you are in your heart is
[1:27:33] who you are stop trying to be an Esau
[1:27:36] there's some brothers who are just
[1:27:38] anointed they just got this mellow voice
[1:27:40] they've got the Charisma it's who they
[1:27:43] are I'm not going to try to be that you
[1:27:45] ever seen someone with a bass voice
[1:27:47] trying to sing soprano
[1:27:49] that's kind of like what it is
[1:27:53] the revealed word will act as your
[1:27:55] filter you will receive the spoken word
[1:27:57] it'll be quickened to you by the
[1:27:58] quickening of the spirit of the coming
[1:28:00] of the Lord if you receive more quick
[1:28:02] and spoken word your filter of the
[1:28:04] revealed word becomes stronger and
[1:28:07] stronger it will block more you young
[1:28:10] man young woman you won't need anyone to
[1:28:12] watch you if your word the word is in
[1:28:15] you you'll protect yourself even in if
[1:28:18] you're engaged to someone you'll protect
[1:28:20] yourself if you're espoused to someone
[1:28:22] you'll protect yourself you don't need
[1:28:24] laws you don't need anyone to to to give
[1:28:27] you the laws you'll have it for yourself
[1:28:29] you'll have the strength to keep your
[1:28:31] character that's where we should be
[1:28:34] leading our people to thank you
[1:28:38] preach the word
[1:28:40] don't police the people
[1:28:43] policing the people comes with judgment
[1:28:45] because if you need police you need a
[1:28:48] Judicial System
[1:28:49] problem is the judicial system is always
[1:28:51] corrupt
[1:28:54] the prosecutors are very good
[1:28:57] and the judicial you know what judging
[1:28:58] is all about it's about this this is
[1:29:01] what people don't know about judging
[1:29:02] judging is deciding on how much Mercy to
[1:29:06] give
[1:29:09] because a prosecutor brings the
[1:29:11] accusation
[1:29:12] judging is about deciding how much Mercy
[1:29:15] to give when it is proven that he is
[1:29:18] guilty
[1:29:22] you know if you've ever been a part or
[1:29:25] seen a a Judicial statement being read
[1:29:29] they'll be like you've defied this this
[1:29:32] this this according to the law they'll
[1:29:34] give you all the laws you broke and
[1:29:37] because of this and what will he do
[1:29:38] they'll judge your age they'll judge
[1:29:40] your your situation where you come from
[1:29:42] uh maybe you have a health problem and
[1:29:45] they look at all these things and decide
[1:29:47] how bad and how much Mercy to give
[1:29:50] but it seems like in the message it's
[1:29:53] the highest penalty for everything
[1:29:56] no one thinks about how much Mercy to
[1:29:58] give to someone who's actually guilty
[1:30:01] until it's you sitting in the
[1:30:03] defendant's seat
[1:30:05] who am I then I am a real thinking man
[1:30:10] my thinking has been changed by the
[1:30:12] coming of the Lord since the opening of
[1:30:13] the seventh seal I no longer need to
[1:30:16] conform to an Esau religion I am up to
[1:30:19] my neck with it it's nauseating
[1:30:23] I cannot take it anymore cannot take
[1:30:25] fake worship
[1:30:26] fake prayer fake Behavior we're up to
[1:30:31] here with him we need to see people who
[1:30:33] want the word who love the word who love
[1:30:36] to desire to Fellowship
[1:30:39] I am no longer a Jacob who thinks he's
[1:30:41] less than the others
[1:30:44] I have no use for a religious message
[1:30:47] filters I've recognized it as hypocrisy
[1:30:50] I will say it openly
[1:30:52] the only photo that satisfies me is
[1:30:55] perfect perfectly is the revealed word
[1:30:57] of the hour I seek the spoken word that
[1:30:59] can be quickened by the same quickening
[1:31:01] spirit that revealed his coming
[1:31:03] I recognize that I'm called to be the
[1:31:06] person of Jesus Christ made flesh and no
[1:31:10] Esau religion can produce that that is
[1:31:13] my thinking if I draw my life through
[1:31:15] the word then I am the word because as I
[1:31:19] think in my heart so am I
[1:31:22] glory to God
[1:31:23] let's go to the next scripture Genesis
[1:31:27] 27 and this is the second part of this
[1:31:29] mystery
[1:31:31] do you love him Saints
[1:31:33] we still got time
[1:31:34] all right Genesis 27 30-41 I'm trying to
[1:31:38] see how many Jacobs there are
[1:31:43] and it came to pass as soon as Isaac had
[1:31:45] made an end of blessing Jacob and Jacob
[1:31:48] was yet scarce going out of the presence
[1:31:50] of Isaac his father and Esau his brother
[1:31:52] came in with his hunting that's how it
[1:31:55] always is you just show yourself and the
[1:31:58] older brother is there to show you up
[1:32:00] right
[1:32:01] verse 31 and he also had made Savory
[1:32:04] meat
[1:32:05] so you can see his bringing worship
[1:32:07] right and brought it into his father and
[1:32:10] said unto his father let my father arise
[1:32:12] in eat of his sons Venison and thy soul
[1:32:14] may bless thee now you're actually
[1:32:16] seeing in type what happens when Esau
[1:32:19] recognizes the favor on Jacob
[1:32:23] that's what's happening right now when
[1:32:26] those who have esor Natures are seeing
[1:32:28] what is happening with those who are
[1:32:30] receiving the open book
[1:32:32] there's the attitude you're going to see
[1:32:34] it what's happening
[1:32:37] verse 32 and Isaac his father said unto
[1:32:40] him who art thou
[1:32:43] and he said I am thy son thy first born
[1:32:45] isil he answers correctly he knows who
[1:32:48] is
[1:32:49] right and Isaac trembled very
[1:32:52] exceedingly
[1:32:54] the ministry has a problem because the
[1:32:56] two are so close
[1:33:01] trembled exceeding very exceedingly and
[1:33:04] said who where is he that had taken the
[1:33:07] Venison and brought it to me I have
[1:33:09] eaten of all before thou came as and
[1:33:12] have blessed him and he shall be blessed
[1:33:14] when Esau heard the words of his father
[1:33:16] he cried with a great exceeding bitter
[1:33:19] cry and said unto his father bless me
[1:33:22] even me also my father
[1:33:25] amen and he said thy brother came with
[1:33:28] satility and have taken away thy
[1:33:31] blessing
[1:33:32] and he said is not he rightly named
[1:33:36] Jacob
[1:33:39] for he had supplanted me these two times
[1:33:42] so
[1:33:43] the older brother actually knows
[1:33:46] who the other one isn't even rightly
[1:33:48] named that
[1:33:52] amen
[1:33:53] God help us for it supplanted me these
[1:33:56] two times he took away my Birthright and
[1:33:59] behold now he taken away my blessing he
[1:34:01] said hast thou not resolved a blessing
[1:34:03] for me Isn't there something for me
[1:34:06] Lord look at where it's coming to the
[1:34:09] end they've got a desire to have
[1:34:12] something more powerful than the one who
[1:34:14] actually has the birthright
[1:34:19] and Isaac answered and said unto Esau
[1:34:20] behold I've made him thy Lord
[1:34:23] and all his Brethren have I given him
[1:34:25] for thou for uh for servants you're a
[1:34:28] servant you're going to serve him
[1:34:30] everything you're going to do from here
[1:34:31] on is going to bless him no matter how
[1:34:34] you try
[1:34:38] and he said
[1:34:40] um for servants and with corn and wine
[1:34:42] there it is
[1:34:45] the written word the Revelation is going
[1:34:47] to bless him I've sustained him and what
[1:34:50] shall I do now unto thee my son what can
[1:34:52] I do for you that he's basically saying
[1:34:54] I cannot do anything for you right and
[1:34:57] Esau said unto his father has thou but
[1:34:59] one blessing my father bless me even
[1:35:01] also my father
[1:35:05] it's almost pitiful
[1:35:08] and Esau lifted up his voice and wept
[1:35:13] I don't reveal in this I don't
[1:35:16] feel fantastic about it it's not it's
[1:35:19] not a good feeling to have
[1:35:21] we're not rejoicing over this
[1:35:24] that's why I said this is a this is a
[1:35:26] solemn thing
[1:35:27] right
[1:35:29] but it's a reality of what is happening
[1:35:32] in this day
[1:35:33] and you can't deny it even if you don't
[1:35:35] like it to happen the way it is it's
[1:35:37] happening
[1:35:38] there's going to be a great Falling Away
[1:35:43] and it's already begun
[1:35:47] all of these
[1:35:50] and I don't want to say this hurtfully
[1:35:52] but I don't know what else what other
[1:35:54] word the only one come to me right now
[1:35:55] is defective
[1:35:57] those who are leaving the message
[1:35:59] this happened because of Esau religion
[1:36:05] that's why it happened because the
[1:36:07] people were guilty
[1:36:10] of being ESO
[1:36:13] going after that
[1:36:14] being brenamide
[1:36:16] focusing on the first obsessing over
[1:36:19] things that were not the revealed word
[1:36:22] and now the truth is all those with on
[1:36:25] the internet whichever they are and they
[1:36:28] and now say to them respectfully
[1:36:31] I'm not a brand Amite
[1:36:34] I and now and the prophet would never
[1:36:37] want me to admit that to admit that I'm
[1:36:40] a brand Amite because if you read
[1:36:41] Blasphemous names and have a real
[1:36:44] revelation of that you'll be afraid to
[1:36:48] call yourself by any label
[1:36:51] would never I'm devoted to the prophet
[1:36:53] and his word 100 but I do not wake up
[1:36:56] every morning obsessing over him
[1:36:58] wondering about what testimony I must
[1:37:01] fill my head with next of what happened
[1:37:02] in his life I'm not going to go to to
[1:37:04] Eagle Rock and Sabino Canyon and rate
[1:37:07] the place of every stone that is there I
[1:37:09] don't have a hank ring to go sit in his
[1:37:11] den room and put his hat on and feel
[1:37:13] like I need anointing or hold a gun
[1:37:15] no it's the word it's always been that I
[1:37:20] don't have to that my Revival is not
[1:37:22] there but because people did that for 40
[1:37:25] years
[1:37:27] is why you have this falling away and
[1:37:29] defecting from the message
[1:37:35] they're right
[1:37:36] they are right
[1:37:40] but they just didn't see us
[1:37:43] that's the problem
[1:37:45] and maybe we were behaving like the
[1:37:48] Esau's
[1:37:49] we didn't even see us
[1:37:53] and even when it happened we took it
[1:37:55] personally how could they do this
[1:37:57] to the cloud to the prophet it's hurtful
[1:37:59] but we just
[1:38:01] afraid to show ourselves right
[1:38:04] rather not say anything about it rather
[1:38:06] just stay away from the fights just stay
[1:38:08] calm just ignore it what's going to
[1:38:10] reach a place where you can't ignore it
[1:38:12] anymore
[1:38:13] I'm not saying you want to go out and do
[1:38:15] something now and fight back but it's
[1:38:17] going to hit you in the face and you're
[1:38:19] going to have to stand up and say I am
[1:38:22] Israel
[1:38:23] glory to God
[1:38:25] amen verse 41 and Esau hated Jacob
[1:38:31] because of the blessing where will these
[1:38:34] father bless him that's where it's going
[1:38:36] to come to
[1:38:37] and Esau said in his heart the days of
[1:38:39] mourning for my father are at hand then
[1:38:42] will I slay my brother
[1:38:44] you'll never see us going on the
[1:38:46] internet cutting up our brothers
[1:38:48] mentioning names you'll never see Jacob
[1:38:50] doing that you'll never see Israel that
[1:38:53] nature being on is but you'll see it on
[1:38:55] the other side
[1:38:56] getting on the Internet knocking
[1:38:57] Brothers down speaking against one
[1:38:59] another tearing a Brother's testimony
[1:39:01] down you're going to see that because
[1:39:03] they have purposed it in their heart to
[1:39:05] slay us
[1:39:09] this is the second part of the mystery
[1:39:11] since we are talking about the life we
[1:39:13] want to see this type to see how it
[1:39:15] directly speaks to us on the conditions
[1:39:17] we live under in this generation amen we
[1:39:20] identified Esau the firstborn right as
[1:39:23] the first nature we were born with so
[1:39:24] now we're going to get closer and I'll
[1:39:26] bring it in to me I was born with an
[1:39:29] Esau and a Jacob every Revival produces
[1:39:33] twins I was catering to the other side
[1:39:36] all my life
[1:39:37] right
[1:39:40] I was a pretender I was living the
[1:39:42] message I was pretending I was doing
[1:39:44] what my parents were telling I was
[1:39:46] living without a revelation every time
[1:39:48] they asked me I behaved like I was that
[1:39:53] Esau comes in from the field he and
[1:39:55] Isaac realized that Jacob has deceived
[1:39:57] Isaac and supplanted Esau
[1:40:00] ESO pleads for a blessing for himself
[1:40:02] this is vital Isaac tells Esau I'm sorry
[1:40:05] the blessing belongs to Jacob then Isaac
[1:40:08] prophesied something strange he says
[1:40:10] that towards the end Esau would grow to
[1:40:13] be more in numbers
[1:40:15] and dominion and will break the Yoke of
[1:40:19] Jacob from off of himself
[1:40:21] they'll separate
[1:40:23] eventually Israel Edom separated from
[1:40:27] Israel he didn't want to
[1:40:29] so if this is how it works if the
[1:40:32] brother has the birthright and the
[1:40:33] blessing the other brother is supposed
[1:40:35] to help him
[1:40:36] help build him up help strengthen him
[1:40:39] help threaten the cause help with the
[1:40:42] ministry to because they have the same
[1:40:44] father they have the same uh calling
[1:40:47] this is our should but Edom separated
[1:40:49] from Israel and Eden became a curse to
[1:40:54] Israel as long as they lived right
[1:40:57] and Isaac prophesies he says Edom will
[1:41:01] grow in numbers and will break the Yoke
[1:41:03] of Jacob from off himself means towards
[1:41:05] the end Esau will eventually become
[1:41:07] independent that's what we're going to
[1:41:09] see
[1:41:10] it's not a comfortable thing to realize
[1:41:12] right
[1:41:14] if the prophet said when I preached this
[1:41:16] I'm going to lose a lot of friends I
[1:41:18] guarantee you we are losing friends
[1:41:22] it's starting to feel really lonely
[1:41:25] because even though we have the right
[1:41:27] Desire with preaching what God shows us
[1:41:29] we accept what they preach when when God
[1:41:32] reveals something to them even if
[1:41:34] there's things we don't exactly see the
[1:41:36] same we say thank you brother the
[1:41:38] message was wonderful we go on we don't
[1:41:39] cut them down we don't blacken their
[1:41:42] names but they don't hesitate to slay us
[1:41:47] it's heading there
[1:41:49] it's a disturbing thought we thought
[1:41:51] that we'll actually get complete control
[1:41:53] over the first nature now look at
[1:41:55] yourself
[1:41:57] you when you consider yourself
[1:41:59] you look in the mirror your Easter
[1:42:02] nature is going to slay you
[1:42:05] every time you do something wrong you
[1:42:07] come in here what happens how do you
[1:42:09] feel when you have to take communion
[1:42:11] you're the biggest judge of yourself
[1:42:14] you'll come in here Palm sweaty nervous
[1:42:18] you know and here's the thing I did it
[1:42:20] see if you come in here and you know
[1:42:23] you're not worthy you're gonna take the
[1:42:25] communion anyway
[1:42:29] because you're Jacob and you're acting
[1:42:31] like Esau
[1:42:33] you listen the communion is not even
[1:42:36] about
[1:42:37] uh what you did wrong or whether you
[1:42:39] because you failed so many times some of
[1:42:42] us as families uh you fail on the way to
[1:42:45] communion
[1:42:48] and and what is putting it right oh I'm
[1:42:51] sorry honey I'm sorry does sorry put it
[1:42:53] right
[1:42:55] you said sorry just because you want to
[1:42:57] take communion
[1:42:58] and you come in here Esau convince
[1:43:01] himself I did it here's my venison I
[1:43:05] Jacob's very happy behaving like an Esau
[1:43:08] communion is about the Brotherhood of
[1:43:11] the church that's what it's really about
[1:43:13] it's about sitting at the same table and
[1:43:16] dipping in the SOP
[1:43:18] it's about the unity of the Brotherhood
[1:43:20] it's more about what you've done wrong
[1:43:22] to each other than all your regular
[1:43:25] failings in life
[1:43:27] it's about unbelief it's about because
[1:43:29] it's about Discerning the Lord's body
[1:43:35] you need to think about that and don't
[1:43:36] let Esau slay you for that
[1:43:38] come before the Lord it's not just an
[1:43:40] apology it's not just Lord I'm sorry the
[1:43:43] real apology is inside and the prophet
[1:43:46] says God already knows you repented of
[1:43:49] and again people repentance is a change
[1:43:53] of mind
[1:43:57] not an apology
[1:44:01] right and here's the other thing we
[1:44:04] forget because we're so good at being
[1:44:05] esos if your brother comes to to say I'm
[1:44:10] sorry brother please forgive me
[1:44:12] we've gotten used to our Western culture
[1:44:15] where we say it's okay brother
[1:44:18] you know what forgiveness is forgiveness
[1:44:21] is actually helping your brother to
[1:44:23] restore himself it's not word that says
[1:44:26] it's okay
[1:44:28] what do I do to help him regain his
[1:44:32] confidence
[1:44:35] that's the way it's going to work
[1:44:37] so there's a lot of people do not
[1:44:39] understand what Discerning the Lord's
[1:44:41] body is offending one another in word
[1:44:44] and deed
[1:44:48] but that's a different subject
[1:44:49] what are the Lord's Parables of the seed
[1:44:51] supports this type in the end the weeds
[1:44:54] will have to be gathered and burned
[1:44:56] while the wheat is harvested in the bond
[1:44:58] the battle between these brothers
[1:44:59] extends beyond what we have first
[1:45:02] thought
[1:45:03] I want to show you this in case you
[1:45:05] thought I made all this up
[1:45:07] you always get accused for making things
[1:45:09] up let's go to uh having a hearing
[1:45:13] recognizing acting on the word this is
[1:45:15] shocking it it's because it's in the
[1:45:17] message right a paragraph nine
[1:45:20] now we're fully acquainted with people
[1:45:22] who search the scriptures day and night
[1:45:23] read our papers and hear the news
[1:45:25] commentators that this world is now
[1:45:27] standing in the group of two spiritual
[1:45:29] forces and they are both religious
[1:45:31] forces and I believe that these great
[1:45:33] forces are soon coming to a head and
[1:45:35] both of these great forces were
[1:45:37] represented in two sons of Isaac
[1:45:40] how did God did you think of that
[1:45:43] both of these forces are represented in
[1:45:46] the two sons
[1:45:47] how that God is infinite wisdom had
[1:45:49] foreshadowed all things to us that we
[1:45:51] might be these things no of a certainty
[1:45:53] what lays before us made it so praying
[1:45:56] that God in his word the nature and his
[1:45:57] universe is so perfectly arranged
[1:45:59] together The Sinner can see something
[1:46:00] fixing to take place God has arranged it
[1:46:03] no one is without excuse the prophet
[1:46:05] said there are two great forces in the
[1:46:06] world and they are symbolized by these
[1:46:08] two sons of Isaac
[1:46:10] so we're not wrong when we say those two
[1:46:12] Natures inside
[1:46:14] uh uh Jacob and Esau two in the church
[1:46:17] two in the world
[1:46:19] right he says they're coming to a head
[1:46:22] in these last times
[1:46:24] right to the the prophecy of the type is
[1:46:27] coming to fulfillment let's go to the
[1:46:29] next one paragraph 10.
[1:46:31] now we see in these two sons that one
[1:46:33] day before they were born they were at
[1:46:35] war with one another
[1:46:37] even though the virgin mother she was a
[1:46:40] virgin a beautiful Rebecca that married
[1:46:41] the righteous seed of God promised Isaac
[1:46:43] they were two consecrated
[1:46:48] so we're not just talking about the
[1:46:49] world now
[1:46:51] too consecrated the world is not
[1:46:53] consecrated right right but we can still
[1:46:55] apply it there but we're talking about
[1:46:57] the church
[1:46:58] too consecrated Spirit-filled Believers
[1:47:02] of God foreordained to the very marriage
[1:47:04] they unite together by God foreknew it
[1:47:07] how could such a thing come through that
[1:47:10] one mother by one father
[1:47:13] one a very evil person another very good
[1:47:17] person and here's what I want to bring
[1:47:19] to you how did the good person look to
[1:47:22] be evil and the evil look to be the good
[1:47:28] let that soak in
[1:47:30] the evil looked to be the good and the
[1:47:32] good look to be the evil and isn't that
[1:47:35] how I felt isn't that how you felt
[1:47:37] always lesser than someone else they've
[1:47:40] got more of the ability more of the gift
[1:47:42] I'm Just a Nobody I just can't get this
[1:47:45] right no matter how much I try I still
[1:47:48] get picked on no matter how much I try
[1:47:50] I'm still lesser
[1:47:52] as someone else always seems better
[1:47:54] always seems to have more Revelation
[1:47:57] than me
[1:47:58] their their churches are producing more
[1:48:01] they seem to have more blessings at the
[1:48:04] advertising prophecies and miracles and
[1:48:07] all of that and we're just
[1:48:09] so simple and barely anything happens
[1:48:13] and it looks like they always have
[1:48:15] ammunition to prove us wrong to say
[1:48:17] something against us and we just stand
[1:48:19] there with our mouth shut accepting
[1:48:21] whatever they say
[1:48:24] one looks
[1:48:26] good but is actually evil
[1:48:29] and the other looks evil but he's
[1:48:31] actually good
[1:48:32] this is fascinating because it shows
[1:48:34] that things were completely opposite to
[1:48:37] the thinking of man without the right
[1:48:39] thinking it speaks the thing we TR we
[1:48:42] struggle with and I always look at
[1:48:44] everything personally I look at
[1:48:46] Lord what am I projecting if I'm
[1:48:49] projecting something but in the meantime
[1:48:50] I've got a hidden agenda I'm projecting
[1:48:52] something good in the meantime my agenda
[1:48:54] is evil
[1:48:57] yeah
[1:48:58] and you know Paul Paul said when I want
[1:49:02] to do good evil is present who can save
[1:49:05] me from the body of this death
[1:49:07] I find in me two laws
[1:49:12] uh you know what laws are right you know
[1:49:14] the prophet said there is a law in a
[1:49:16] bird there's a law in a fish the bird's
[1:49:19] law is it doesn't have to have a quote
[1:49:21] to say I should fly
[1:49:25] it just acts it doesn't need a way a law
[1:49:29] a standard to say well let's let's run
[1:49:31] along the road and pick up speed 30
[1:49:34] miles an hour that might be a bit too
[1:49:36] fast but
[1:49:37] in kilometers it sounds better and then
[1:49:40] pick up my wings and start it doesn't
[1:49:42] need to work up because the law exists
[1:49:45] the law means the nature there's a law
[1:49:48] and a fish you try it fish can just blow
[1:49:51] out the air from inside and sink to the
[1:49:53] bottom it cells are so perfect it will
[1:49:56] never explode it it has such a tiny
[1:49:58] brain anyway nothing's going to happen
[1:50:00] to it you and I try that just try
[1:50:02] sinking to the bottom of the ocean your
[1:50:04] wonderful skull will explode because the
[1:50:08] skin cells and bone cells are not
[1:50:10] pressurized for that that law does not
[1:50:13] exist in you
[1:50:15] see but so there are two laws in every
[1:50:19] human born in this earth
[1:50:21] and when he wants to do good evil is
[1:50:24] present
[1:50:25] and he finds in himself that when he
[1:50:27] goes to do the good he gets to do the
[1:50:29] evil instead
[1:50:31] always
[1:50:32] right two laws so a human is supposed to
[1:50:36] have a simple law just like a fish just
[1:50:39] like a bird the law of man and because
[1:50:42] the Beast nature was injected in that's
[1:50:44] how the two laws came in
[1:50:46] so everything we look at has a has is is
[1:50:50] contaminated with desire even when it's
[1:50:54] logical we'll still go with desire
[1:50:59] and so when we consider the word we see
[1:51:02] what the word says even when God has
[1:51:04] perfected it even in our reasoning we'll
[1:51:06] go with desire
[1:51:08] that's how it works we're constantly
[1:51:10] giving glory to Esau even in ourselves
[1:51:13] we feel I should be more like this I
[1:51:16] should be more like this and you find
[1:51:18] even when you are doing it be honest
[1:51:21] you're not feeling comfortable with it
[1:51:24] you're wishing you could just be
[1:51:27] yourself
[1:51:31] that's what I like about the open book
[1:51:33] it makes you really look at yourself in
[1:51:35] the mirror
[1:51:36] it makes you stop being a hypocrite
[1:51:40] paragraph 17 hearing recognizing acting
[1:51:42] in the word of God these two boys if you
[1:51:44] notice their nature thank you brother
[1:51:46] Frank keep forgetting
[1:51:48] one of them was a spiritual man that was
[1:51:50] Jacob and the carnal man was Esau but
[1:51:53] they were both religious and the same
[1:51:56] things took place all down through the
[1:51:58] age the carnal and the spiritual ESO
[1:52:00] represented the man of Earth natural
[1:52:02] religious incline so look at the man the
[1:52:06] natural
[1:52:06] the part of that was influenced by the
[1:52:09] Beast nature religious inclined but
[1:52:12] never able never able to do what get the
[1:52:15] promise
[1:52:17] it wasn't in him to do it he couldn't do
[1:52:19] it he never was in him to be able to
[1:52:21] climb a past the things of the world the
[1:52:24] carnal things but Jacob it was just so
[1:52:27] easy for him to do it see one purpose
[1:52:29] Jacob had that was that he longed for
[1:52:31] the birthright no matter how he got it
[1:52:33] just so he got it
[1:52:36] how did we get into the open book how
[1:52:38] did we see what we what we did how did
[1:52:41] we how did the seven seal open to us how
[1:52:43] is it look that it's so plain to us
[1:52:46] we're asking ourselves it's so plain how
[1:52:49] can they not see it how is it
[1:52:51] it's because there's something in the
[1:52:54] predestinated seed that allows us to do
[1:52:57] that
[1:52:57] and as that grows you will suppress the
[1:53:01] eso nature
[1:53:03] that's my purpose my personal Purpose
[1:53:06] with myself that's that's what I'm
[1:53:08] looking at I'm not looking to control my
[1:53:10] other brother I'm not looking to try and
[1:53:13] control him I want to be the best person
[1:53:14] I can be to be an example to him but I'm
[1:53:18] not even going to try to tell him to be
[1:53:19] more like me
[1:53:22] because that's going to make him an ESO
[1:53:25] he's gonna know who he is
[1:53:29] because as he is in his heart so he will
[1:53:32] be
[1:53:33] glory to God Prophet is talking about
[1:53:35] being true to the word paragraph 20.
[1:53:38] and that spirit that one birth this is
[1:53:42] beautiful one birth right produce twins
[1:53:47] so
[1:53:48] same message same Prophet for these
[1:53:51] twins
[1:53:52] that Spirit of that one birth is still
[1:53:54] represented in the world today it's
[1:53:56] coming to a head now the spiritual
[1:53:57] believer in the carnal man the carnal
[1:53:59] believer no one could say there wasn't
[1:54:01] both religious they were they didn't say
[1:54:04] that one served an idol and the other
[1:54:06] one God no they were both Servants of
[1:54:08] God problem 25 the carnal believer today
[1:54:11] or as long as I go to church and do
[1:54:13] what's right what difference does it
[1:54:14] make that's Esau's group
[1:54:18] bro see I didn't make it up right
[1:54:20] he still makes fun and despises the
[1:54:23] birthright
[1:54:25] he doesn't care for it but Jacob loved
[1:54:27] it same thing with Israel and Jacob Esau
[1:54:30] seemed like a better man he settled down
[1:54:32] and done charitable things he took care
[1:54:34] of all his old blind Daddy got him
[1:54:36] venison taken you can apply it
[1:54:38] spiritually we did already and was a
[1:54:40] good boy there's many things that carnal
[1:54:42] believers do in the line of religion
[1:54:43] helping societies paying off hospital
[1:54:45] bills for people and religious things
[1:54:47] that's not what I'm talking about
[1:54:50] let me tell you something
[1:54:52] I had to study this and actually go and
[1:54:55] prove to people
[1:54:56] there isn't a single
[1:54:59] uh
[1:55:00] religious organization on Earth that
[1:55:03] does more for the poor than the
[1:55:05] Catholics
[1:55:08] for all their failures let me ask you
[1:55:11] whenever there's a flood disaster where
[1:55:13] are the message charges
[1:55:19] the Catholics and the Muslims flying
[1:55:21] with Aid
[1:55:24] blankets food they're mobilized
[1:55:29] we don't even have that structure
[1:55:32] we gotten so satisfied with
[1:55:35] helping ourselves
[1:55:37] enriching ourselves in the message we
[1:55:40] got tucked away with this thing that you
[1:55:42] know we're going in the Rapture why
[1:55:44] should we care about the world
[1:55:47] we pale in comparison to them
[1:55:50] how many of the young people in the
[1:55:52] message go to the nearest
[1:55:54] orphanage and help feed the babies
[1:55:59] barely any
[1:56:00] how many of you would young people would
[1:56:02] go and and paint the fence the broken
[1:56:05] down fence and fix it off the widow
[1:56:07] woman in the street that you live
[1:56:09] you barely notice it
[1:56:12] we're pale in comparison to those that
[1:56:14] actually help the world
[1:56:17] and yet
[1:56:19] you don't have to go preach Doctrine to
[1:56:21] them you just go to fix that old lady's
[1:56:23] fence paint it up for her and she'll ask
[1:56:25] you boy where are you from
[1:56:29] you don't have to go there with quotes
[1:56:31] you know that's all it's going to take
[1:56:33] you just have to interact with them
[1:56:36] but those are the the things that our
[1:56:39] message churches fail to do
[1:56:42] you do you're meant to be not just pasta
[1:56:45] here but Pastor the community not just
[1:56:47] church here but Church of the community
[1:56:49] which means helping now I'm not saying
[1:56:52] create programs and have this that ends
[1:56:54] up being denominational you don't need
[1:56:56] the opposite to mobilize you but you
[1:56:59] also don't need to just go home after
[1:57:01] the word sit down have a fat lunch and
[1:57:04] then prepare for work on Monday and
[1:57:06] forget about your neighbors forget about
[1:57:08] the people in the street
[1:57:10] help pick up the milk bottles for the
[1:57:13] old lady and take it to a door and say
[1:57:14] hope you have a great day ma'am that's
[1:57:17] all it takes just one week of doing that
[1:57:19] she's going to ask you where are you
[1:57:20] from
[1:57:23] why are you so nice
[1:57:25] what do you believe why you dressed
[1:57:26] differently so tell you you know in our
[1:57:29] days this is how respectful we were
[1:57:31] what's happened in the message we're
[1:57:33] hiding away
[1:57:35] you know why we're hiding away we were
[1:57:37] we were following Esau religion
[1:57:40] Jacob has always been afraid to show
[1:57:42] himself
[1:57:43] but look what happens to one worldly
[1:57:46] person when they when they touch Jacob's
[1:57:50] essence
[1:57:51] for the first time it's unmistakable
[1:57:54] there's something about you they come up
[1:57:55] to you and say
[1:57:57] something about you there's something
[1:57:58] different about you now I know even the
[1:58:01] Esau say well that happens to us too
[1:58:03] of course everyone can see there's
[1:58:05] something about you
[1:58:06] but when they say there's something
[1:58:08] about me when I know who I am that's
[1:58:11] surprising
[1:58:12] because I'm not like you and no one's
[1:58:14] ever ever told me that before but
[1:58:16] suddenly starting to show out
[1:58:19] see
[1:58:20] that's that's where we're failing that's
[1:58:24] where our purpose we've stopped we
[1:58:26] thought our purpose is at church and it
[1:58:29] ends here
[1:58:30] but that's because we were primed by a
[1:58:32] whole bunch of results
[1:58:35] so I'm not encouraging you to start
[1:58:37] forming Church movements please far be
[1:58:39] it from that
[1:58:40] but I'm trying to tell you when but the
[1:58:43] prophet is saying they pay off hospital
[1:58:44] bills for people they do things that are
[1:58:46] religious they help societies
[1:58:48] I cannot explain to you I I actually
[1:58:51] took it down on paper to show how many
[1:58:53] hospitals they own how much of
[1:58:56] medications they have they have helped
[1:58:58] fund to help sick people how many things
[1:59:01] how many in in each City the Catholic
[1:59:04] church has done
[1:59:06] the Protestants cannot say anything
[1:59:08] they've just got a few programs here and
[1:59:10] there the the Catholics and the Muslims
[1:59:13] no matter what you say about them they
[1:59:15] will help the world in every disaster
[1:59:17] and we stand back and say oh my that
[1:59:19] that disaster is terrible look at those
[1:59:21] people how they're suffering in the rain
[1:59:24] thank God the Believers are safe God has
[1:59:26] answered our prayer
[1:59:29] that's our life here
[1:59:31] it's a disgrace
[1:59:35] of course I know in the in the places
[1:59:37] where there are believers I know the
[1:59:39] Believers if there's a they're in the
[1:59:41] disaster they will help them but it's
[1:59:43] amazing with all that we have all the
[1:59:45] resources we have we haven't even
[1:59:47] mobilized to do this
[1:59:52] and yet
[1:59:53] they have satisfied themselves in that
[1:59:57] they are helping the world They will
[1:59:58] receive a blessing from God that's for
[2:00:00] sure let me tell you that
[2:00:02] are there have been some of those people
[2:00:05] who have helped Believers in distress in
[2:00:07] flood disasters and so on it's been
[2:00:09] those people that open up their churches
[2:00:11] and clothe them with blankets and let
[2:00:13] them sleep and all that those
[2:00:15] denominational churches that did that
[2:00:17] God will bless them for it there will be
[2:00:19] them but they can never be a Jacob
[2:00:24] do you see how much there is to get over
[2:00:30] the spiritual loves the word Jacob loved
[2:00:33] it may get so many things wrong in life
[2:00:36] but will overcome at the end love for
[2:00:38] the birthright counts much more than
[2:00:40] carnally following and not loving it the
[2:00:43] thing is it's either
[2:00:45] in you or it's not you cannot make it up
[2:00:48] amen Prophet spoke out against Esau in
[2:00:51] his day do we know what the Jacob and
[2:00:53] Esau is in our day that's what we have
[2:00:55] to we we have been identifying him
[2:00:58] every Revival brings twins right do you
[2:01:02] know what twins are Prophet says it's a
[2:01:05] mixed multitude
[2:01:09] and we see that mixed multitude two sons
[2:01:11] of Isaac and Rebecca represents the
[2:01:13] world over every time there is Revival
[2:01:15] there's twins born every time we have a
[2:01:17] Revival twins are born ESO and Jacob
[2:01:19] were twins Esau has just good a man as
[2:01:22] Jacob and so on go right down to the
[2:01:24] bottom as Esau was loved a man of the
[2:01:26] world natural never cared nothing about
[2:01:28] the birthright
[2:01:30] turning northward
[2:01:33] uh but to Jacob it didn't make any
[2:01:36] difference how he got it there it was
[2:01:38] only one thing he had in his mind that
[2:01:39] was the birthright anything else how he
[2:01:41] got it that's the way it is with
[2:01:43] spiritual born churches watch this when
[2:01:45] the Catholic church had a Revival when
[2:01:47] Luther had a Revival when Wesley had a
[2:01:49] Revival are you seeing these churches
[2:01:51] actually had revivals
[2:01:53] but the prophet said the Catholic church
[2:01:54] had a Revival
[2:01:56] right
[2:01:57] and all down Through the Ages It
[2:01:59] produced Twins and when Pentecost had a
[2:02:02] Revival It produced twins when Moses had
[2:02:04] a Revival down in Egypt It produced
[2:02:06] twins a mixed multitude
[2:02:11] that's another word for twins
[2:02:13] a mixed multitude one word so let's
[2:02:16] let's zero it down into us today just a
[2:02:19] few more minutes in the early stages of
[2:02:21] brother Martin's Ministry when he
[2:02:22] preached from this thought this thought
[2:02:24] he explained how the Pentecostal age was
[2:02:26] a Revival and that it would produce
[2:02:28] twins in the church one he said would
[2:02:30] organize the gifts of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:32] into a denomination the other would
[2:02:34] remain true to the word under the
[2:02:36] ministry of the first and second poor
[2:02:38] today he taught that the difference
[2:02:40] between the twins in the in the seven
[2:02:42] Church age was the life they were
[2:02:44] leading
[2:02:45] right
[2:02:46] and one twin would be wild proud and
[2:02:49] have Liberties in the church against the
[2:02:51] word but not the other twin the other
[2:02:53] would remain humble and stick as close
[2:02:55] to the word as possible
[2:02:57] glory to God you believe that one twin
[2:03:00] would be wild and proud the other would
[2:03:02] remain humble the devil's lie is getting
[2:03:05] message people to preach the same thing
[2:03:08] the prophet was preaching back there
[2:03:12] right because it's it's easier to preach
[2:03:16] that what happened in the church age
[2:03:18] instead of talking about what's
[2:03:19] happening among us today
[2:03:21] message people still want to show that
[2:03:23] today it's about how messy one gets at
[2:03:25] the altar
[2:03:27] how emotional how spiritual it gets at
[2:03:29] the altar here God had that experience
[2:03:31] brother
[2:03:35] see how quiet he got
[2:03:37] because you're so used to hearing that
[2:03:39] so
[2:03:41] watch The Experience
[2:03:46] some of you parents in the message don't
[2:03:48] know this
[2:03:50] I was never in Egypt
[2:03:54] I was in this message from from the
[2:03:56] beginning
[2:03:57] my parents grew me up not doing anything
[2:04:00] wrong I dressed right from the very
[2:04:02] beginning
[2:04:03] I spoke right I never spoke slang never
[2:04:06] swore never drank never never smoked
[2:04:08] never had any girlfriends never straight
[2:04:12] I grew up perfect according to message
[2:04:14] standards
[2:04:15] so reached the point where they wanted
[2:04:18] me to have an experience with God
[2:04:21] and I had a Frank talk with my father
[2:04:23] and said tell me what to repent of
[2:04:27] I don't know
[2:04:28] because you want me to have that
[2:04:30] experience and my father and I had a had
[2:04:33] a relationship where we could talk this
[2:04:35] way and it was the first time he looked
[2:04:37] at me with a realization that there was
[2:04:40] no way I was going to have that
[2:04:42] experience
[2:04:43] being in the message all my life
[2:04:46] and being brought up not doing anything
[2:04:48] wrong so I was so specific with him I
[2:04:51] said so must I must I Repent of that one
[2:04:54] time I lied to Mom
[2:04:57] is that going to be it or when I fought
[2:04:59] with my brother does that make me a
[2:05:01] sinner
[2:05:02] I'm a Believer
[2:05:04] I believe the word
[2:05:06] ha you came from the denominations the
[2:05:10] some of the deacons the brothers they
[2:05:12] drank smoke they saw a change
[2:05:16] they could cry about wrong things they
[2:05:18] did and how unworthy they were and the
[2:05:20] message saved them I can't do that
[2:05:24] you brought me up but now when I see all
[2:05:27] the people come to the front and they're
[2:05:28] just crying and they're remembering what
[2:05:30] happened in their life before and so on
[2:05:32] they having this experience I don't have
[2:05:36] that
[2:05:37] and I can't fake it
[2:05:40] what do I do it's the first time he
[2:05:43] looked at me and he said Son there's
[2:05:45] only one thing the word has to be
[2:05:47] revealed to you personally when that
[2:05:50] happens you're going to know what to
[2:05:54] repent of
[2:05:55] and it happened
[2:05:57] and you'll never believe well you will
[2:06:00] now you'll never believe what it was I
[2:06:03] realized I had to repent of
[2:06:04] everything in my message life was
[2:06:07] self-righteousness
[2:06:11] I had to repent of self-righteousness
[2:06:13] which my parents never needed to repent
[2:06:15] of
[2:06:16] and repent means to change your thinking
[2:06:21] I realized when I came to the word and
[2:06:24] saw my place in the logos and it was
[2:06:26] revealed to me and I and I thought Lord
[2:06:28] I've been faking all this time I've been
[2:06:31] an Esau I need to repent of that
[2:06:34] thinking I know who I am now from that
[2:06:37] day
[2:06:38] changed
[2:06:39] I I don't stop crying
[2:06:42] glory to God
[2:06:44] amen so I just want to give you hope
[2:06:47] young people don't think you need to
[2:06:49] fake it parents encourage them into
[2:06:52] getting into the word family altars
[2:06:54] should be about the love of discussing
[2:06:57] and fellowship
[2:06:59] that's what it ought to be about it's
[2:07:01] correction correction correction
[2:07:02] correction you're going to get Esau's
[2:07:05] that's what's going to happen
[2:07:07] the prophet said the Revival has died in
[2:07:10] the shamed of him I just want to skip to
[2:07:12] paragraph 43 the Revival itself amongst
[2:07:15] the churches can you see that oh my so
[2:07:18] small
[2:07:18] uh it's it's paragraph 43 towards the
[2:07:21] middle he says he's been a nervous he
[2:07:23] says the Revival itself has died among
[2:07:25] the churches had died the end of
[2:07:28] paragraph 43 he says it seems to be a
[2:07:31] dead thump everywhere amen and notice
[2:07:34] this date is 1965. he spoke of himself
[2:07:37] after 63 of trying now if you if you
[2:07:40] read the messages from 63 he says he
[2:07:43] wants us
[2:07:44] start a Revival right you're trying to
[2:07:46] restart a Revival he was feeling the
[2:07:48] church needs another Revival and like he
[2:07:51] used to have and he felt that the church
[2:07:53] needs one desperately but it just never
[2:07:55] worked
[2:07:56] go read the messages we need a Revival
[2:07:58] we need a Revival he just could not get
[2:08:01] the first and second polls back like he
[2:08:03] used to in fact the the Lord told him
[2:08:06] why are you doing this
[2:08:08] here are you in the third pool why are
[2:08:10] you trying to bring back the second
[2:08:13] remember that and God began to show him
[2:08:15] his heart was not in the Revival mode
[2:08:18] anymore his heart was taken he couldn't
[2:08:21] help himself start to preach he wants to
[2:08:23] get the revival going and he goes to the
[2:08:25] cloud and 63 and what was preached in
[2:08:29] the seals he couldn't get out of that
[2:08:30] until he realized there was his Revival
[2:08:33] in the opening of the seal he was trying
[2:08:36] to get the church and and everything
[2:08:37] everybody knows the churches were were
[2:08:40] rejecting the cloud rejecting the seals
[2:08:43] rejecting the seventh seal it they just
[2:08:45] were not having a Revival with that but
[2:08:47] his Revival was there and no matter how
[2:08:50] we try to get away from it through 63
[2:08:52] 64.65 he couldn't help it kept going
[2:08:55] back kept going back to that amen
[2:08:58] anointed ones at the end time we're
[2:09:00] almost done
[2:09:02] I just want to show you this
[2:09:05] uh to the towards the bottom uh and then
[2:09:08] it happened can you see that
[2:09:10] right here come Wesley along with the
[2:09:13] new Revival the tassel that looks a
[2:09:15] little more like the wheat than what
[2:09:17] happened that organized and dried up and
[2:09:19] died the life went right into a shark
[2:09:20] and the shark come forth almost
[2:09:22] perfectly like the wheat but finally its
[2:09:25] Folly was made manifest in the last
[2:09:27] eight or ten years especially in the
[2:09:28] last three years now what does it do
[2:09:31] pull away from the wheat
[2:09:34] Watch What Happens he shows how every
[2:09:37] day every age brought a Revival then it
[2:09:39] died out then God showed him especially
[2:09:41] in the last three years
[2:09:44] after the seals got it
[2:09:46] right in the last three years of his
[2:09:48] ministry since the opening of the
[2:09:49] seventh seal that the Esau of the church
[2:09:51] was pulling away from him
[2:09:54] that was the death of the church
[2:09:56] ESO getting Dominion that's in the
[2:09:57] church ages how about now
[2:10:01] you're going to see it pulling away from
[2:10:02] us
[2:10:04] amen anointed ones of the Anton Park of
[2:10:06] 165 says now why hasn't there been an
[2:10:10] organization startup in these last 20
[2:10:11] years of this great Revival they cannot
[2:10:14] organize around the open book
[2:10:17] no matter how you try
[2:10:19] they will always organize on everything
[2:10:22] else on message religion randomism every
[2:10:25] they will be able to organize your one
[2:10:29] Minister who gets the open book you can
[2:10:31] never have organized religion why
[2:10:33] because if you're preaching it your
[2:10:34] people become free they'll never expect
[2:10:37] they'll never accept organized religion
[2:10:39] they'll never accept the mark of the
[2:10:41] beast they'll be they'll be maturing in
[2:10:43] the rising of the sun they're maturing
[2:10:46] in that sunlight they cannot accept it
[2:10:48] they'll be become independent strong in
[2:10:51] their prayer strong in their
[2:10:52] relationship confident in their worship
[2:10:55] they'll be realizing who they are you
[2:10:57] can't organize somebody who knows who he
[2:10:59] is glory to God Amen says there isn't
[2:11:05] nothing Beyond The Grain it's back
[2:11:07] without an organization oh my a blind
[2:11:10] man could see that
[2:11:11] it cannot organize it so firmly against
[2:11:14] it it's the grain of wheat itself the
[2:11:16] son of man will be manifest the grain of
[2:11:18] weed will come back to itself the son of
[2:11:20] man in the last days what's happening
[2:11:22] the son of man coming here in the last
[2:11:25] days you cannot organize him just when
[2:11:28] you think he comes out and he breaks
[2:11:30] every law
[2:11:32] plucks corn on the Sabbath day and says
[2:11:34] this crazy thing I'm the lord of the
[2:11:36] Sabbath
[2:11:38] then he's on the tribe of Judah he knows
[2:11:41] no tribe of Judah Gad enough to like can
[2:11:45] touch the Scrolls
[2:11:47] only Levi can he walks into the
[2:11:49] synagogue he doesn't just touch it he
[2:11:51] opens it he reads it and then interprets
[2:11:54] it and says this day is the scripture
[2:11:56] fulfilled well they had a coronary
[2:12:00] you can imagine what the uprising booted
[2:12:04] out of the synagogue because firstly who
[2:12:06] is he of the tribe of Judah to touch the
[2:12:09] Scrolls meant for Levi only
[2:12:11] and then he starts teaching things that
[2:12:13] we've never kept before
[2:12:16] right he says well if your cow or your
[2:12:19] donkey Falls in a ditch on the Sabbath
[2:12:21] day he's interpreting the quotes
[2:12:25] don't you think you should save it
[2:12:28] you're just trying to keep a standard
[2:12:31] because you're afraid of what people
[2:12:32] will say so in other words you're what
[2:12:34] you're saying is you let your cow die
[2:12:36] that's crazy
[2:12:40] and to us it seems like well that's the
[2:12:43] correct thing to do to them no no no no
[2:12:45] that's not according to Cod
[2:12:48] that's not according to what's written
[2:12:50] that's not according and what happens
[2:12:52] things are just going to die
[2:12:55] he came out doing everything against
[2:12:57] what they thought defying what they
[2:13:00] thought
[2:13:01] you cannot organize the son of man
[2:13:04] he's going to defy all your expectations
[2:13:06] that's what happens when a Son of God
[2:13:09] grabs hold of the open book I'll ask you
[2:13:12] this question that Paul said
[2:13:14] are you apprehended by that which you
[2:13:17] have apprehended
[2:13:21] you know Paul says that
[2:13:22] I have been apprehended by that which I
[2:13:25] have apprehended
[2:13:27] you grabbed her into the word it's
[2:13:28] grabbed on to you
[2:13:30] glory to God
[2:13:32] so the condition of twins will with
[2:13:35] regards to the church is over they have
[2:13:37] never had a Revival in the world they've
[2:13:40] never had a Revival since Billy Graham
[2:13:41] and Oral Roberts they've tried
[2:13:43] everything ends in Failure I don't want
[2:13:45] to mention names but you know every
[2:13:48] single move the Pentecostal church has
[2:13:50] tried just plummets
[2:13:52] it reaches its peak and then down it
[2:13:54] goes scandal after scandal
[2:13:57] it can't hold everything else has been
[2:14:00] carnality false pretenses Ministries
[2:14:02] trying to copy the these three all ends
[2:14:05] in Perdition money woman popularity
[2:14:07] God's focus is moved and your Revival
[2:14:10] begins elsewhere God began to show the
[2:14:12] prophet after the seals that that would
[2:14:14] have to be new different Revival to
[2:14:16] birth the bride for the rapture
[2:14:18] once again a Revival takes place there's
[2:14:22] another Revival invisible Union of the
[2:14:25] bride of Christ
[2:14:26] uh paragraph 49 there
[2:14:29] says watch from the spiritual bride when
[2:14:31] she begins to have a Revival
[2:14:34] spiritual bride when she begins to have
[2:14:36] a Revival
[2:14:37] amen when she begins to come back and
[2:14:40] line herself up with the word of God
[2:14:42] watch then again you see how the
[2:14:45] scriptures at that time there'll be a
[2:14:46] message sweep out to cast their blood
[2:14:49] cast that woman the elect
[2:14:52] here she is
[2:14:54] amen
[2:14:55] see this new Revival was a birth people
[2:14:59] were called out spiritual call and so on
[2:15:01] we've seen this happen in the message
[2:15:02] right God began to show how there'll be
[2:15:05] a message bring forth the bride it'll
[2:15:07] bring a Revival paragraph 182 of the
[2:15:09] third seal now that's the reason that
[2:15:12] the revivals we're supposed to have we
[2:15:14] have having denominational revivals but
[2:15:16] in 63 he's saying but we haven't had a
[2:15:19] real stirring
[2:15:21] this is during the third seal
[2:15:24] this is the prophet saying we haven't
[2:15:25] had a real stirring no no no no no no no
[2:15:28] no sir don't think we got revivals we
[2:15:32] haven't oh they've got millions and
[2:15:33] millions of church members but not a
[2:15:35] Revival nowhere no the bride hasn't had
[2:15:38] a Revival yet see
[2:15:42] I mean he went through first Paul second
[2:15:45] Paul he had campaigns he had healing
[2:15:47] campaigns and he's this and he still
[2:15:49] feels he hasn't had a Revival
[2:15:52] how can that be I mean you just you just
[2:15:54] go to message churches here and see
[2:15:56] something with discernment or something
[2:15:58] we had a Revival brother
[2:16:00] it's on the internet
[2:16:02] it'll be advertised we're having a
[2:16:04] Revival the gifts are uh uh exploding
[2:16:08] things are exploding in our churches
[2:16:10] and a prophet even with the first and
[2:16:12] second Paul said the bride hasn't had a
[2:16:14] Revival yet
[2:16:17] there's something wrong if they're
[2:16:18] trying to imitate Pentecost today
[2:16:20] he said there's been no Revival there no
[2:16:24] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[2:16:26] yet
[2:16:27] see we're looking for it it will take
[2:16:30] those seven unknown Thunders back there
[2:16:33] to wake her up again
[2:16:35] that's it that's the only Revival that's
[2:16:37] going to happen for you in the meantime
[2:16:38] all they'll do is keep up Esau religion
[2:16:43] seven Thunders is the bright Revival
[2:16:46] every Revival produces Twins and the
[2:16:48] Seven Thunders is the bride's Revival
[2:16:50] which means when the seven Thunders
[2:16:52] reveal themselves
[2:16:53] there'll be another set of twins
[2:16:58] and we've seen it listen it's no I'm
[2:17:00] sorry to be saying this
[2:17:02] we've seen when people came out with
[2:17:05] seven Thunder Seven Virtues seven
[2:17:07] Thunders is the seventh under the seven
[2:17:09] voices we've seen all that we've seen
[2:17:11] where it went to right
[2:17:12] we've seen them try to revive the gifts
[2:17:14] they said that the seven Thunders
[2:17:17] produced that what happened
[2:17:19] churches plummeted immorality
[2:17:23] teenage pregnancies
[2:17:25] adultery at the very top fraud
[2:17:30] financial fraud Non-Stop
[2:17:34] what happened to the Holy Ghost what
[2:17:36] happened to the boasting now it's like
[2:17:38] no no no we distance ourselves
[2:17:41] that thing was wrong they never
[2:17:43] apologized for having done the damage
[2:17:45] they've done
[2:17:46] but they've distanced themselves and say
[2:17:48] no we we didn't really believe that but
[2:17:50] we're not with them anymore that's it
[2:17:53] that's what we get
[2:17:55] so to think we've already seen that
[2:17:58] effect whatever and of course you know
[2:18:00] what happens with both sides you'll get
[2:18:02] the one side that goes into the emotions
[2:18:03] the other side says no no no that's so
[2:18:06] wrong and this other side becomes cold
[2:18:08] and formal we must study it's quote this
[2:18:11] and quote that and this Doctrine and
[2:18:13] that Doctrine until the doctrines become
[2:18:15] so complicated nobody can believe it
[2:18:18] nobody can understand it that's where we
[2:18:20] went to both sides right
[2:18:23] consequences and now it's amazing
[2:18:27] they're trying to revive the same things
[2:18:29] again
[2:18:30] when we've literally witnessed its
[2:18:32] failure
[2:18:35] so Saints in closing in this message we
[2:18:38] will have to see a carnal believer and a
[2:18:41] spiritual believer the problem is that
[2:18:43] the carnal believer is going to look a
[2:18:44] whole lot more like the real deal
[2:18:46] he's the one who looked like the good
[2:18:48] one say what the tape says literally
[2:18:51] preach God sent a prophet be a William
[2:18:54] Branham fanatic prayer Warrior inspired
[2:18:58] by first and second polls keep all the
[2:19:00] standards of the message religiously
[2:19:01] loved by everyone respected by everyone
[2:19:04] preach awarded our ministry that that
[2:19:07] satisfies everyone
[2:19:09] will deceive the even the ministry of
[2:19:12] the day Isaac because you'll never be
[2:19:15] able to know whether the person actually
[2:19:17] knows the message or not
[2:19:19] the problem is that they don't realize
[2:19:21] in their hearts the birthright was never
[2:19:23] Theirs to begin with they don't really
[2:19:26] love the word as much as they love the
[2:19:28] fame of the word the fame of the message
[2:19:30] the name of the message all you have to
[2:19:33] do I tell you what for a lot of
[2:19:35] ministers it's just a job
[2:19:38] it's an occupation you're getting some
[2:19:40] income we're taking care of our family
[2:19:42] and that's what it is
[2:19:44] sadly that's where it's become and if
[2:19:47] members don't and it's going to happen
[2:19:49] members dwindle then we've got to
[2:19:51] produce programs to get more members
[2:19:53] if you're preaching the word you don't
[2:19:56] have to worry about members because
[2:19:58] you'll be as Christ all that the father
[2:20:00] has given will come amen yeah I don't
[2:20:04] have to sweat it out or work like they
[2:20:06] used to preach the revealed word and the
[2:20:08] true seed will come I'm not interested
[2:20:10] in three kinds of Believers in my church
[2:20:12] the other two have to get out
[2:20:16] amen that was for another time not
[2:20:20] interested in anymore
[2:20:21] if they're not handling the heat they
[2:20:23] have to move
[2:20:26] all you have to do is talk to them about
[2:20:29] the coming of the Lord and the Seven
[2:20:30] seal and watch them close up
[2:20:33] but the life but this but that
[2:20:36] right
[2:20:37] and talk about the seven Thunders and
[2:20:39] what it is and you see their react it's
[2:20:41] their Birthright they're the ones who
[2:20:44] have the greatest respect among
[2:20:45] Believers but they'll split on what you
[2:20:47] say they despise the birthright and they
[2:20:50] don't even know it it's the very thing
[2:20:52] they were birthed into and they don't
[2:20:54] realize that very Revival and enjoyed
[2:20:57] for so long was in fact the result of
[2:20:58] the seven Thunders and the opening of
[2:21:00] the seventh seal
[2:21:01] how much have messaged people benefited
[2:21:04] from the message of their humble prophet
[2:21:08] we've we've benefited financially
[2:21:11] we've benefited family wise
[2:21:14] we've we have better relationships with
[2:21:17] our wives and our husbands we have more
[2:21:19] respectful children how much have we
[2:21:21] benefited we've had friends we've
[2:21:24] traveled the world
[2:21:26] had it not been for the message some of
[2:21:28] us would still be stuck in a small
[2:21:29] little Hometown we were born in but we
[2:21:32] travel the world we've seen the world
[2:21:33] we've preached
[2:21:35] we've visited people we've had people
[2:21:37] from uh from other parts of the world
[2:21:39] come to see us
[2:21:40] we've benefited so much from this move
[2:21:43] of the message from this humble Prophet
[2:21:45] who had barely any education didn't take
[2:21:48] any money from it didn't take any claim
[2:21:52] for it and was rejected right to the
[2:21:53] very end
[2:21:55] and we built Empires for ourselves on
[2:21:58] the back of that humble prophet
[2:22:00] it's ridiculous
[2:22:04] the ones who are not recognized the ones
[2:22:07] who didn't enjoy all the fame the great
[2:22:09] experience of the message all the
[2:22:11] Acclaim all the great food suppers are
[2:22:14] the ones with the birth who the birth
[2:22:16] part actually belongs to the
[2:22:18] predestinated ones who will not falter
[2:22:20] as time goes by the Esau group are the
[2:22:23] ones who will fall away with internet
[2:22:25] proofs against brother maram message and
[2:22:27] they will fall with it there's a lot of
[2:22:29] people a lot of them are fighting now
[2:22:31] on the internet against those who are
[2:22:33] against the prophet eventually they'll
[2:22:35] get taken
[2:22:37] that's what that's what will happen
[2:22:39] because if they don't have the the
[2:22:41] opening of the word they don't have the
[2:22:43] book they are going to fall with it
[2:22:46] and it won't be long you'll start
[2:22:48] hearing the Bible is false
[2:22:53] because that move is already taking
[2:22:55] place in our children's schools it's
[2:22:58] already taking place the Bible is being
[2:23:00] proved to be false they're coming up
[2:23:02] with archaeological findings
[2:23:06] your your educated children are going to
[2:23:08] look at archaeological findings that
[2:23:10] come to your dad they actually said
[2:23:12] Noah was just a story
[2:23:15] the ark never happened
[2:23:18] there was never ever a great flood
[2:23:21] what are you going to say then
[2:23:24] if they give up on the prophet they're
[2:23:26] going to give up on the Bible
[2:23:31] yeah he
[2:23:33] the Jacob the Jacobs will come in from
[2:23:36] behind and sweep it
[2:23:37] away from the esos he will recognize the
[2:23:40] coming of the Lord at Bethel he will
[2:23:42] have a personal experience of the angels
[2:23:44] of the Lord ascending and descending
[2:23:46] upon the son of man he will meet the
[2:23:47] coming of the Lord himself he will
[2:23:49] wrestle with the word until his name is
[2:23:51] revealed and he receives the revelation
[2:23:53] of who he really is to the individual
[2:23:56] follow the type you will realize it when
[2:23:58] the message come to you it was because
[2:24:00] of the opening of the seventh seal and
[2:24:02] it's something caught your attention
[2:24:03] though you didn't know what it was the
[2:24:06] one in you who received the message is
[2:24:08] the firstborn of the twins your first
[2:24:10] nature your intellect your very sincere

[2:24:25] right remember that where everyone loved
[2:24:28] each other we're in each other's homes

[2:24:48] know sorry brother we're not available
[2:24:49] right now we have a thing
[2:24:55] I know the old times because I was there
[2:24:57] I wake up one morning and I'm sleeping
[2:25:00] under the dining room table
[2:25:03] and there's 15 people in my house and my
[2:25:05] bed has four people in it I don't even
[2:25:07] know who moved me
[2:25:13] and there's other children next to me
[2:25:15] and we were hey hi God bless you we're
[2:25:18] from Durban

[2:25:22] people two in the morning Brothers say

[2:25:53] insurance
[2:25:58] amen
[2:26:00] I'm not saying it's going to go back to
[2:26:02] but you you remember those days when
[2:26:04] things felt friendlier
[2:26:07] and and you feel like if only it could
[2:26:09] go back to that it's not
[2:26:12] because it's pulling away time
[2:26:15] it's the time where the wheat is
[2:26:17] separating
[2:26:18] it's time for individual
[2:26:22] growth you can't depend on your
[2:26:24] brother's strength anymore
[2:26:26] you're not everything is going to break
[2:26:28] the way it is revealed is even your
[2:26:30] family might break
[2:26:31] the closest ones to you and you will
[2:26:34] have to stand
[2:26:36] every time you try to say something the
[2:26:38] other Esau shut you up and told you you
[2:26:41] had no right to ask such questions or
[2:26:43] say such things anyway what what did you
[2:26:45] know you just came in recently right
[2:26:48] that's how you were made to feel but
[2:26:50] something inside you was stirring and
[2:26:52] wanted to be free you love this message
[2:26:54] from the word go and you felt you could
[2:26:56] die for it
[2:26:58] just realize that struggle you're going
[2:27:00] through in your life as these two forces
[2:27:03] in you at War
[2:27:06] trust what your heart says
[2:27:09] it's who you really are your head is
[2:27:12] going to try a whole of things but that
[2:27:14] seventh seal is open the book is in your
[2:27:16] heart trust what your heart says when
[2:27:18] you reach it you will stand before God
[2:27:20] and say I am Jacob
[2:27:23] change me Lord amen trust what your
[2:27:26] heart said as you think in your heart so
[2:27:29] you are as I think in my heart so I am
[2:27:34] may the Lord bless you Saints brother
[2:27:35] Chad you can come up the musicians we
[2:27:39] can stand together Saints
[2:27:41] you love the Lord
[2:27:43] amen
[2:27:45] I didn't mean to offend anyone just got
[2:27:48] to say what God has put in our hearts
[2:27:49] and we've got to understand really
[2:27:52] understand what is happening around us
[2:27:55] today this isn't just some Revival we're
[2:27:58] having with the word where it sounds so
[2:28:00] good it sounds great we come to church
[2:28:02] we dress up nicely we're rejoicing no
[2:28:04] there's a battle happening and even
[2:28:08] though we're having good times here in
[2:28:09] Fellowship everything we've said
[2:28:12] here in this place is going to go out
[2:28:14] and they are going to slay us
[2:28:17] it's going to happen and if you are
[2:28:19] associated with it they're going to slay
[2:28:21] you
[2:28:22] young people you're going to have
[2:28:24] troubles at youth camps you can have
[2:28:26] troubles at meetings because you're
[2:28:28] going to have to stand for what you
[2:28:30] believe or assimilate
[2:28:33] you're gonna you're gonna go to youth
[2:28:35] meetings where you're going to see
[2:28:36] others behave in a certain way you're
[2:28:37] going to feel like I need to be an easel
[2:28:40] and and what do I do
[2:28:42] right or you or the other arm it may be
[2:28:45] about emotions or you'll be meeting with
[2:28:48] some user they'll be like brother random
[2:28:50] said this and this and that and that and
[2:28:51] this and that brother Daniel said
[2:28:53] something beautiful you don't need to
[2:28:56] preach the seventh seal by mentioning
[2:28:59] the seventh seal
[2:29:02] you can preach the seventh seal in the
[2:29:04] open book without even mentioning it
[2:29:06] and this has to be so
[2:29:10] that even a 90 year old person
[2:29:14] a 12 year old person can grab a hold of
[2:29:17] the open book and start to live
[2:29:19] according to how they are amen that's
[2:29:23] how it is what do we do with the theory
[2:29:24] we just preach and you catch it
[2:29:27] supernaturally
[2:29:28] you don't have to have the ability to
[2:29:31] intellectually explain everything
[2:29:32] neither does it have to produce some
[2:29:35] great signs and wonders and emotions and
[2:29:38] uh crying screaming slain in the spirit
[2:29:42] falling down twitching all of that no it
[2:29:45] doesn't have to do that it can happen to
[2:29:47] some it may not happen to someone else
[2:29:50] I'm not one of those people I couldn't
[2:29:52] dance to save my life
[2:29:55] if I had to and I often tell people when
[2:29:58] they when they speak about music and
[2:29:59] dancing it's wonderful it's scriptural
[2:30:01] it's there but and they tell you well we
[2:30:04] dance like David danced no you didn't
[2:30:09] because dancing is not choreographed
[2:30:12] dancing
[2:30:14] David danced like a madman whooped off
[2:30:17] his clothes and jumped around in circles
[2:30:20] because he was rejoicing at the word
[2:30:22] don't tell him you dance like David
[2:30:24] danced because that's how he danced he
[2:30:26] must have looked ridiculous so that his
[2:30:29] wife scorned him
[2:30:34] don't follow emotions after what the
[2:30:37] denominational systems have put out
[2:30:40] there's no choreographed sexy dancing
[2:30:42] that fits with the worship of God
[2:30:45] there's no
[2:30:46] sensual kind of behavior and you know
[2:30:49] let me tell you this is how easy it is
[2:30:53] when you preach the word all you got to
[2:30:54] do is let this
[2:30:56] glory to God
[2:30:58] the Lord is wonderful
[2:31:01] isn't he doesn't he touch your heart
[2:31:06] you already feel the emotion start
[2:31:08] Rising
[2:31:09] because a man can use Charisma to bring
[2:31:12] out the emotions in you that's an Esau
[2:31:15] right there
[2:31:16] you should be able to feel that pull if
[2:31:19] you're just hearing the word as if
[2:31:21] Christ was saying blessed are the meek
[2:31:26] not even needing song service or hype
[2:31:30] not even needing anything just reading
[2:31:32] the word preaching the word praying just
[2:31:35] you should feel the pull and in there
[2:31:38] you feel God coming down touching you
[2:31:40] without the addition of any humanism
[2:31:44] you don't need to fake it
[2:31:47] the experience you need is the word
[2:31:49] opening up to you personally that's what
[2:31:52] it's all about
[2:31:53] brother Chad and I were talking not
[2:31:56] about this but
[2:31:57] just a simple thing like people tell you
[2:31:59] you need to find a balance
[2:32:01] who has a balance
[2:32:03] how do you find a balance the prophet
[2:32:06] the word says an unjust weight is an
[2:32:09] Abomination to God
[2:32:10] you know what you know those scales with
[2:32:13] the two balances it's like you're in the
[2:32:15] marketplace and you're selling rice for
[2:32:17] one pound but your weight is actually
[2:32:19] 750 grams or something
[2:32:22] but it's written on there one pound
[2:32:25] that's a false weight
[2:32:27] it's an Abomination imagine the Lord
[2:32:30] saying that's an abomination
[2:32:32] and this is what we do with each other
[2:32:34] in the message who has the balance
[2:32:37] and who's the standard
[2:32:39] some person claiming to have the balance
[2:32:41] has a false weight because he feels in
[2:32:44] his life he's balancing off emotions
[2:32:46] versus intellectualism so he feels
[2:32:48] secure I've got it because the way I
[2:32:50] have it works for me that's not the same
[2:32:53] with someone else
[2:32:56] and you've got to realize that do not
[2:32:58] judge yourself with someone else do not
[2:33:01] try one church is emotional so we must
[2:33:03] be flat
[2:33:04] yes we all need to change some of us
[2:33:06] need to become more emotional some of us
[2:33:09] I used to be sitting there on that side
[2:33:11] of the church the word burning inside me
[2:33:13] and I want to say amen and I used to
[2:33:14] look like this
[2:33:17] but in my heart I wanted to scream
[2:33:20] I felt it and I was like yes
[2:33:23] yes
[2:33:24] amen
[2:33:26] until I just can't help it anymore and
[2:33:29] wasn't even preaching that helped me I
[2:33:31] had to come out of my own skin
[2:33:33] and some of us you just sit there and
[2:33:35] you just weep
[2:33:38] you don't even have to stand shout the
[2:33:40] tears just flow or inside some some
[2:33:43] people don't even react but inside their
[2:33:45] heart they leave the church and go fix
[2:33:47] something right away
[2:33:49] that's all it takes
[2:33:51] nobody's going to see that balance
[2:33:54] but they've got it
[2:33:56] amen just be who God has made you to be
[2:34:00] in your heart do not judge yourself by
[2:34:03] anybody live free bride of Christ
[2:34:06] it is who you are
[2:34:08] the Lord bless you brother chair
[2:34:20] willing
[2:34:23] [Music]
[2:34:30] glorified
[2:34:32] we glorified
[2:34:36] [Music]
[2:34:41] Lord be glorified
[2:34:46] in my heart
[2:34:50] in
[2:34:52] my heart
[2:34:55] Lord be glorified
[2:35:00] be glorified
[2:35:03] him
[2:35:04] [Music]
[2:35:07] My Heart
[2:35:09] Lord
[2:35:11] be glorified
[2:35:13] today in my life
[2:35:18] in
[2:35:20] my life
[2:35:23] Lord be glorified
[2:35:26] [Music]
[2:35:28] feel your refining
[2:35:33] bye foreign
[2:35:39] [Music]
[2:35:45] my
[2:35:46] what a Capstone
[2:35:48] [Music]
[2:35:50] a Capstone that takes us deep inside
[2:35:53] he said this would be a message that was
[2:35:55] introspective I found it to be so for me
[2:35:59] I don't know about you but
[2:36:02] I think I found a bit of myself in every
[2:36:04] part he talked about
[2:36:07] but I know I know beyond the shadow of a
[2:36:10] doubt who I am
[2:36:12] because the word identified me
[2:36:16] may have been confused in the outer
[2:36:18] realm for years and may have tried this
[2:36:20] and tried that
[2:36:21] but the word gave me my true
[2:36:23] identification
[2:36:26] and if the word can give me a true
[2:36:27] identification then the word can bring
[2:36:30] me into the full manifestation of that
[2:36:32] that identification
[2:36:35] not what I think I ought to be but what
[2:36:37] he's determined I am to be is what I
[2:36:40] want to be
[2:36:42] for years we've thought we should be
[2:36:45] like this and we should be like that and
[2:36:47] I should be more like this and I should
[2:36:49] be more like that and I don't know about
[2:36:51] you but I spend a lot of effort going
[2:36:53] down the wrong road because I can never
[2:36:55] be what I thought I was supposed to be
[2:36:58] but God planted a seed in his children
[2:37:01] and that seed is one of his attributes
[2:37:03] and that attribute has a certain
[2:37:05] expression and that's what he wants
[2:37:09] that's what Daniel was telling us to be
[2:37:11] who you are in your office is Christ in
[2:37:13] you in your office the Capstone was
[2:37:16] telling us don't imitate don't don't be
[2:37:19] false in any way don't pretend amen just
[2:37:23] seek Him and heed that word the water
[2:37:25] the life the spirit it'll all bring that
[2:37:28] seed to full manifestation and that seed
[2:37:31] will bear fruit in our lives
[2:37:33] and that's the only fruit that will be
[2:37:35] pleasing to God
[2:37:37] is the fruit that comes from the seed
[2:37:39] that he planted
[2:37:41] amen that's all I want
[2:37:43] that's what I want in my life and I'm
[2:37:46] sorry for all the other things that I've
[2:37:48] done I'm sorry for all the other efforts
[2:37:50] that I put forth all the other failures
[2:37:52] and all the other wanderings about I'm
[2:37:54] sorry for all of that but on I want more
[2:37:56] than anything is to stay where the water
[2:37:59] is flowing and where the sunshine is
[2:38:01] shining and to become all that God wants
[2:38:04] to become in this Tabernacle
[2:38:07] oh my
[2:38:09] I think we all could spend some time
[2:38:11] meditating
[2:38:13] on what we've heard this weekend and I
[2:38:15] thank God for it
[2:38:18] you know it's easy to come to meetings
[2:38:20] and it's it's very easy to preach in a
[2:38:22] way that stirs people up and gets them
[2:38:25] really excited and gets a lot of emotion
[2:38:27] going to mess everybody walk out the
[2:38:29] door feeling like wasn't that great
[2:38:30] meetings
[2:38:32] but what our brothers did through
[2:38:35] laboring in the word and yielding
[2:38:36] themselves to God was to come down and
[2:38:39] not try to make themselves the great
[2:38:41] preacher and us really excited and say
[2:38:43] we had great meetings but to come down
[2:38:45] and bring something that will bring a
[2:38:46] change in our lives that'll permanently
[2:38:49] affect us and change the way we think
[2:38:51] the way we act what we do tomorrow and
[2:38:54] get us com to identify who Christ said
[2:38:57] we are and give us the faith to just be
[2:39:00] that
[2:39:03] and if that can be accomplished and all
[2:39:06] that'll be the greatest success
[2:39:08] that we have ever experienced is just to
[2:39:11] accept what God said we were just to say
[2:39:14] you know when the Virgin Mary she didn't
[2:39:16] know she was the Virgin Mary her parents
[2:39:18] didn't call her Virgin Mary she wasn't
[2:39:20] raised being told she was the Virgin
[2:39:22] Mary
[2:39:23] she was just a woman from an obscure
[2:39:25] place from a mean city of Nazareth with
[2:39:28] with no with nothing special about her
[2:39:30] she was a teenage girl espouse to an
[2:39:33] older man amen and she was just in the
[2:39:35] routine of life and an angel messenger
[2:39:37] come down and says you're highly favored
[2:39:40] and she was the most unlikely person to
[2:39:43] be highly favored by God but he says
[2:39:45] you're highly favored of God and then he
[2:39:48] begins to tell her you are the reality
[2:39:51] of Isaiah's prophecy 700 years ago when
[2:39:54] Isaiah spoke he was talking about you
[2:39:57] when you were in synagogue and they
[2:39:59] picked up the scroll and opened Isaiah
[2:40:01] and went to the seventh chapter and said
[2:40:03] a virgin count conceived at that moment
[2:40:05] Isaiah prophesied God knew it was you
[2:40:08] you're the one
[2:40:10] and you know that woman when she said be
[2:40:14] it unto me according to your word she
[2:40:16] was making an impossible Claim by an
[2:40:20] impossible Faith to say I believe what
[2:40:24] you say about me that I am actually
[2:40:26] literally the word of God made flesh
[2:40:32] but it was her accepting what he said
[2:40:37] that made it possible
[2:40:41] you know we've had an angel messenger in
[2:40:43] this day tell us who we are
[2:40:46] but we need to have a revelation strike
[2:40:50] our hearts to say that ain't nothing but
[2:40:52] the truth
[2:40:54] I didn't earn it I haven't earned it I
[2:40:57] can't earn it I'm not worthy of it I'm
[2:41:00] not acceptable but it doesn't matter
[2:41:02] it's still the truth
[2:41:05] and now there's no other identification
[2:41:07] I want
[2:41:09] now God be it unto me
[2:41:12] according to your word
[2:41:17] oh May May the things we've heard Not
[2:41:21] Fade Away
[2:41:23] may they become living realities in our
[2:41:26] life
[2:41:26] May each one of us find our
[2:41:29] identification in Christ may he reveal
[2:41:31] to us who we are and help us to
[2:41:34] surrender to that and allow him to bring
[2:41:38] all the potential out of the seed
[2:41:40] not through effort but through surrender
[2:41:44] amen God bless you all
[2:41:47] I've so enjoyed the services I so
[2:41:50] enjoyed the fellowship enjoyed the
[2:41:52] fellowship together around the world
[2:41:54] enjoyed our brothers and the gift that
[2:41:57] God's placed in them
[2:41:58] and say God bless you God bless you all
[2:42:01] this is bow our hearts together and
[2:42:04] thank the Lord
[2:42:06] dear Lord Jesus I thank you so much
[2:42:09] [Music]
[2:42:10] that you care enough about us Lord that
[2:42:13] you'll expose us to us
[2:42:16] God that you love us so much
[2:42:18] you expose our wrong ideas and our wrong
[2:42:21] thinking
[2:42:22] not because you wish to condemn us mock
[2:42:27] us
[2:42:28] but because you want us to be free
[2:42:31] you expose the times that we act like
[2:42:34] Esau trying to gain acceptance when we
[2:42:37] played the part of the hypocrite
[2:42:39] religiously you've exposed it to us Lord
[2:42:42] not to shame us
[2:42:45] but you've exposed us so we could be
[2:42:47] free
[2:42:48] so that we could realize I don't have to
[2:42:50] pretend
[2:42:51] I don't have to try or put on an act I
[2:42:54] don't have to gain acceptance from
[2:42:55] another person
[2:42:57] for God you have ordained that I will be
[2:43:01] part of this bride in this end time it's
[2:43:04] your word your plan your thought your
[2:43:07] predestination it's your word it's your
[2:43:09] spirit it's your life it's all you
[2:43:12] God help us to be really real
[2:43:15] God help each one of us help me Lord to
[2:43:18] be really real
[2:43:20] to be genuine Lord and what I say and
