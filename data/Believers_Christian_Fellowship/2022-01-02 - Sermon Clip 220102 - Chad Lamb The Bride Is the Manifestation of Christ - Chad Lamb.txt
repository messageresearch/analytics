what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living brother brennan preached this december 5th 1965. he preached this just you know just 20 or 19 days before his accident just three four weeks before he passed away this was one of his final final set of messages that he preached and brother branham as he winds down coming to the end of his ministry he is making this point so clear amen he's driving this point home after the seals and he gets into 1965 and he's trying to show you there's not another manifestation the next manifestation will be two witnesses to the jews don't look for that you are the manifestation of christ christ is here in the formation of the bride he has returned in the fullness of the word the headship has united with the bride with the body this body is his body flesh and bones if you want to see christ you must look to the bride because she has to be manifesting christ just like if you wanted to see god you had to look to jesus christ if you want to see christ in this day you must find christ because christ is the anointed word for the day where is the anointed word for the day the anointed word for the day is the capping of the church the finishing of the bride that must be manifest in a people who are the body of jesus christ the habitation of god in the end time so what are we looking for what are we waiting for waiting for something what what's next there is no next friends this is it but i'm looking for the catching away the change in the body this brings the change of the body amen don't sit and wait for something else this word that's been restored that's becoming alive inside of us is changing our bodies amen brother branham said the sid the same spirit was in jesus christ be in you it'll quicken your mortal body and we've looked at that scripture for years as the final quickening and changing of the body but brother benham takes that scripture and says you used to smoke and you don't smoke anymore you used to drink you used to run around you are changing by the same spirit that was in him is quickening your mortal body and it will quicken and quicken and quicken and quicken until the final quickening amen and then you will be translated into another dimension and you will see him as he is
