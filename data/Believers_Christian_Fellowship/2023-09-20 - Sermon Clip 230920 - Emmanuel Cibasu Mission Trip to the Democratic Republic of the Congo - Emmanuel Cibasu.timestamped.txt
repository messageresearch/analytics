[0:00] so when you're finding your way back to
[0:03] little word that God has spoken you can
[0:06] anchor your soul there because that's a
[0:09] hiding place I'm just thinking about a
[0:12] little Miriam
[0:15] here's Moses born
[0:16] in their family and his mom uh hit him
[0:21] for three months
[0:22] in the best place ever Dad Mom brother
[0:26] and sister
[0:27] but after three months they couldn't
[0:29] hide him any longer
[0:32] so what did they have to do put him on
[0:35] the basket there close to the body of
[0:37] water now just with thinking I'm just
[0:41] imagining the drama of uh Pharaoh's
[0:44] daughter coming there because she had no
[0:46] child coming there with all the pump
[0:48] with all the bodyguards and people
[0:50] around her they might have been hundreds
[0:53] don't know
[0:54] because she was the daughter of a
[0:57] pharaoh
[0:58] she had had she must have a lot of
[1:00] people following her but among all those
[1:03] people there here's a seven or eight
[1:05] years old that is taking up to speak
[1:09] and what she's speaking out is she
[1:13] didn't even ask the question she just
[1:15] speaking in Pharaoh's daughter
[1:18] right away takes that little word of
[1:22] that little girl there it becomes thus
[1:25] say the Lord for her
[1:28] said can I get to your mother a Hebrew
[1:30] mother who can come and nurse that baby
[1:32] there was no question who are you
[1:35] why are you telling me that no question
[1:39] he was just little word that God put
[1:43] into that little girl there
[1:47] she never hesitated she did exactly with
[1:51] those hundreds of bodyguards around her
[1:53] she obeyed the word of that little girl
[1:57] there
[1:58] and they went to get to fetch a mother's
[2:01] mom
[2:03] Moses's mother
[2:07] 's mother came home to the the house of
[2:11] pharaoh
[2:13] and now I can imagine Pharaoh himself
[2:15] maybe one morning he is putting a decree
[2:19] there because he already had his degree
[2:20] there to kill all the children of Israel
[2:23] and little Moses was growing up there
[2:25] and Grandpa was picking up Moses
[2:28] little baby how you doing Moses keep
[2:31] quiet and he would call those his people
[2:34] did you make sure that you killed all
[2:37] the Hebrew children
[2:39] because he must be among those children
[2:43] you need to eliminate him I don't want
[2:45] to did you do it oh Moses sorry sorry
[2:48] could you keep quiet
[2:50] the very one he's looking for
[2:55] head
[2:57] in the open
[2:58] hid in the word because when Mother's
[3:02] mother was hiding him there was no word
[3:06] he was she was hiding him they were
[3:09] hiding him with the love of a mother of
[3:12] a father of a siblings but there was no
[3:15] word so he was still in the open
[3:19] but when God put little words into that
[3:22] little girl she spoke
[3:24] that was the hiding place for Moses
[3:28] she was in the pharaoh Pharaoh's
[3:31] mentioned being protected by the word of
[3:34] his sister
[3:38] Moses keep quiet God's coming in how
[3:41] many did you kill today
[3:43] at Moses sorry what do you want a candy
[3:50] that's how God the great God works
[3:53] sometimes in a ridiculous way
[3:56] sorry to say those words but it seems
[3:59] like it and that's the way of Faith he's
[4:02] hiding place is not in the greatness of
[4:04] him
[4:10] one word you can be hid there
