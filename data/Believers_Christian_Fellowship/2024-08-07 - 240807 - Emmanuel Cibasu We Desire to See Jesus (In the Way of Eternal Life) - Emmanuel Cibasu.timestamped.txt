[16:20] with uh the world we want to enjoy
[16:25] it thanks M musicians God bless you
[16:29] and uh you may be seated just for a
[16:32] little while as our pastor asked me to
[16:37] give a little detail of our trip so
[16:41] brother Burley uh Williams uh you know
[16:44] him he's a friend to us here acquainted
[16:47] well with us so he's a a pastor in uh
[16:51] South
[16:52] Carolina so he's going to be traveling
[16:54] with me this time so we're going to be
[16:56] leaving next Tuesday
[16:59] uh and be in the Congo to stay there to
[17:02] be there for uh uh 2 weeks but it seems
[17:05] like the the emails have been getting
[17:08] and the phone calls seems like the
[17:11] churches are going to be left out they
[17:14] they they just feel like uh we don't
[17:16] love them so there many churches there
[17:18] so we have within the two weeks brother
[17:21] Burley and I will only have a chance to
[17:24] um to rest on
[17:26] Mondays on Mondays and we have so
[17:29] another day when we traveling uh from
[17:31] the the capital of uh the Dior cono
[17:35] which is kinasa headed uh East Northeast
[17:39] uh that day we're going to be resting as
[17:40] we're going to be traveling but most
[17:42] days we're going to be in almost
[17:44] churches some of them has to assemble
[17:47] they have asked if we can add a third
[17:49] week we're still disputing that but uh
[17:53] we we just want to be there and I know
[17:56] that uh it is uh your prayers and your
[17:59] love that are sending us we just don't
[18:02] want to fall short of that we want to
[18:05] thank each and every one of you for uh
[18:08] your full support our pastor the
[18:11] congregation here we have brothers maybe
[18:14] Brother Rich cob who also supports Us in
[18:17] that we have two precious Brothers at
[18:20] the the true Tabernacle been supporting
[18:22] the the the charity side and also with
[18:26] the the mission they've been so faithful
[18:28] all of you whatever you do I know the
[18:31] families here that are just supporting
[18:33] in any way in prayers and little
[18:35] donation here and those even the girls
[18:37] that are giving their clothings
[18:40] so every everything there just want to
[18:44] thank you for all you do the little you
[18:46] do and I remember the the prophet of God
[18:49] said in um in paman church
[18:53] age he said that the first
[18:56] miracle that ever happened to the
[18:59] messenger
[19:00] Martin the first miracle that ever
[19:03] happened to him that even issued him to
[19:06] start his
[19:08] ministry was
[19:10] giving right
[19:13] giving so when he who took that cloak
[19:16] that coat he cut it into two gave a half
[19:20] to the Lord Jesus the prophet of God not
[19:23] me not a man the seventh messenger said
[19:26] that was the first miracle that sent him
[19:29] to the mission field as a messenger
[19:32] we're looking for uh
[19:34] Miracles we're living with Miracles
[19:36] inside of us so giving is the first
[19:40] miracle that uh the
[19:42] messenger
[19:44] Martin started with amen you might say I
[19:48] haven't laid I have laid hands on the
[19:50] people they haven't got uh healed I
[19:52] haven't done this I haven't done
[19:54] this Martin just shared what he had amen
[19:58] and was the greatest miracle that opened
[20:01] up the door for his entire Ministry God
[20:03] bless you uh uh we we just want on to
[20:06] leave you guys but you know what as we
[20:09] go you will see that um even a little
[20:13] portion of the word we're going to be
[20:15] reading here my mind is already set up
[20:17] into the mission field so a lot of
[20:19] scriptures a lot of quotations because
[20:22] the false doctrines are running every
[20:25] place and the only way to combat that
[20:28] it's not with our
[20:30] intelligence we take the scripture and
[20:33] we take the messenger amen cuz sometimes
[20:36] people don't have message books on the
[20:38] other side anybody can quote them
[20:41] anything and said Prophet the prophet of
[20:42] God said this how would they verify that
[20:46] but as we go we have books and we can
[20:49] verify with them we we give them the the
[20:51] quotation the number this is you can the
[20:54] reference is there the scriptures said
[20:56] this the reference said this what you
[20:59] have where are you getting it
[21:01] from so pray for us those areas uh
[21:06] sometimes you have Believers that are
[21:08] being taken from
[21:09] denominations that would come to the
[21:11] meetings special meetings in some
[21:13] Churches and those pastors are fighting
[21:16] they don't like their sheeps uh being
[21:19] taken out to come to listen to the
[21:21] message so they are many attacks and uh
[21:24] different scenarios but uh we have a
[21:27] confidence in the one who's sending us
[21:30] so it's not something we're doing it
[21:31] halfhazard we know exactly who is uh the
[21:36] sender amen and he will take care of
[21:39] that God bless you U May let's stand and
[21:42] read uh the scripture
[21:48] here and I'm aware of the time so I have
[21:52] uh many scriptures and many quotations
[21:54] but hey as you pull we're going to be
[21:57] just speaking about the products our
[22:00] pastor reminded me again as the brother
[22:03] Tony spoke on Sunday I might not be able
[22:06] to present uh the pro products the way
[22:08] it is all the details how beautiful how
[22:11] performant the product is but I can
[22:13] assure you the product is
[22:15] perfect I might stumble here and there
[22:18] but the pro product is perfect amen God
[22:21] bless you let's read let's go to the
[22:23] Book of
[22:25] John chapter 12
[22:38] we're going to be reading just a couple
[22:40] of
[22:41] uh verses so you can sit then you will
[22:44] sit down and as we'll get the the
[22:47] context of it this is John 12 we can s
[22:51] that the verse
[22:55] 20 and it says
[22:58] and there were certain Greeks among them
[23:01] that came up to worship at the feast the
[23:04] same came therefore to Phillip which was
[23:06] of be Bethesda of Galilee and desired
[23:10] him saying sir we would see Jesus you
[23:15] may be
[23:17] seated as uh let's have a again a prayer
[23:20] precious Lord we we thank
[23:23] you for the time you have given us this
[23:26] evening Lord to look
[23:29] into the perfect one The Immortal one
[23:33] the Eternal one and Lord we in our
[23:38] bodies we are
[23:40] limited father we are inadequate
[23:43] to speak of the Eternal to even present
[23:47] the Eternal because of our
[23:49] limitations but Lord we calling you on
[23:52] the sin this evening that you would come
[23:54] you the immortal one would come father
[23:57] and take your th out your word whom you
[24:00] are yourself and father and divide it
[24:03] and and and and feed father the
[24:06] counterpart of your eternal life that is
[24:09] inside of each of one each one of us and
[24:11] father you will give us life be with us
[24:14] father bless Lord the the the the
[24:17] reading of the word and the service and
[24:19] let the name of Jesus Christ be
[24:22] glorified Among Us in Jesus Christ's
[24:24] name we pray amen God bless you so we
[24:29] would I
[24:30] take um subject here or a title that uh
[24:35] we desire to see
[24:38] Jesus and I'm taking it we can desire to
[24:42] see Jesus in many angle because Jesus is
[24:45] big is is greater than any thought of
[24:50] man anything that you can think of you
[24:53] desire to see Jesus it's just a little
[24:56] portion of yes right you cannot even
[24:59] bring it into consideration of who he is
[25:02] and we put it here in the way of eternal
[25:05] life we want to see Jesus but in the way
[25:08] of eternal life starting with uh the the
[25:11] book of uh John here John is relating us
[25:16] you will see that from the 12 the
[25:18] beginning of the the chapter this is 6
[25:21] days before the pass uh the Feast of the
[25:24] Passover so meaning six days the
[25:27] Passover day would be the seventh day
[25:30] and Jesus is is is going to Lazarus
[25:33] place where Lazarus his two sisters Mary
[25:36] and uh and and in Martha where they
[25:40] lived Jesus is visiting them 6 days
[25:43] before the Passover now as he was
[25:45] sitting there at their place they uh
[25:49] prepared a supper for him Martha was
[25:51] cooking now these three people that are
[25:54] that are treating Jesus that are hosting
[25:57] Jesus here here they have something that
[26:00] all the people there don't
[26:02] have cuz these three people Lazarus knew
[26:06] exactly where he has been for 4
[26:09] days where his Spirit was he knew that
[26:14] this one who sitting at the table who
[26:16] with me brought my spirit from there and
[26:18] I'm back again to to life I've been very
[26:21] sick couple days ago very sick and I I
[26:26] collapsed I didn't even know where I was
[26:28] was now here I am where I was I know the
[26:31] four where my spirit was traveling for 4
[26:34] days I'm back here he has no doubt that
[26:37] he was sitting across the table with the
[26:40] eternal
[26:45] life that's that's Lazarus Mary Martha
[26:49] Martha knew that you when we we know
[26:53] what happened before uh the resurrection
[26:55] when she was talking to Jesus so Martha
[26:59] had no doubt that this person is the
[27:02] eternal life himself am Martha has
[27:07] done this family was over blessed and
[27:11] Mary Mary knew without any Shadow of
[27:15] Doubt that's the reason she could just
[27:18] imagine one pound of
[27:21] ointment of Spike n very exp even Judas
[27:25] Judas had to tell us that it was
[27:27] expensive otherwise you would knew that
[27:29] you would have known it was expensive
[27:31] very
[27:32] expensive one pound in the the the the
[27:36] the the saver so the perfume was was
[27:39] filled the entire house and she took her
[27:42] hair so she she she could give anything
[27:47] they could give anything they knew that
[27:50] we are facing eternal life
[27:54] itself now many people came there too to
[27:57] visit them those that heard that hey he
[28:00] Lazarus was resurrected by this uh this
[28:02] man here this
[28:04] Rabbi this prophet of Galilee they came
[28:08] some of them were there when he brought
[28:11] Lazarus to to life now they were the
[28:14] Bible said that they bear record they
[28:17] were testifying they were talking to
[28:19] others now the news were spreading and
[28:22] Jesus was sitting at the table being
[28:24] entertained and now the Pharisees came
[28:27] they look the way the news were was just
[28:31] spreading and the people coming
[28:33] believing they wanted to stop
[28:37] that these are these are not just a
[28:39] couple of few people dozens of people
[28:41] dozens of people talking these are
[28:44] multitude of people talking about the
[28:46] goodness of God God the god of Moses is
[28:50] back on the scene again there there
[28:52] things have not happened for many many
[28:54] years we're seeing this happening so
[28:56] they were just
[28:58] great news going
[29:01] on as we can read let's read again 12
[29:04] let's start at uh
[29:07] 17 now the people therefore that was
[29:11] with him when he called Lazarus out of
[29:13] his grave and raised him from the the
[29:17] Dead bear record for this cause the
[29:21] people also met him for that they heard
[29:25] that he had done this miracle the
[29:28] Pharisees therefore said among
[29:30] themselves perceive you how you Prevail
[29:33] nothing they were murmuring they said
[29:36] there's no way who can contain this guy
[29:39] there's no way to contain this news here
[29:41] it's
[29:44] dangerous behold the world is gone after
[29:48] him and that's where we started reading
[29:52] earlier and there were there were
[29:54] certain Greeks among them that came up
[29:56] to worship at the feast
[30:01] the same came therefore to Phillip which
[30:03] was of Bethesda of Galilee and desired
[30:06] him saying sir we would see Jesus Philip
[30:10] come and tell Andrew and again Andrew
[30:13] and Philip uh tell Jesus and Jesus
[30:17] answered them saying now this is
[30:19] becoming so critical and crucial cuz
[30:26] Jesus always does answer the way we
[30:29] think he ought
[30:31] to you might be asking a
[30:34] question and he speaking something that
[30:37] probably there's no correlation right
[30:41] but just think that every move that
[30:45] Jesus made on Earth every word he ever
[30:49] spoke anything he ever done this is
[30:53] perfect and it's
[30:56] Eternal it's the Perfection of anything
[30:59] that could be done so Jesus anything he
[31:02] might have said his entire life when he
[31:04] was on Earth any move he had made
[31:08] there's no sin there's no it's
[31:11] halfhazard things it's perfect because
[31:16] we will go to the book of Isaiah let's
[31:18] go to Isaiah
[31:22] 42 sorry that we are in the missionary
[31:25] mode we have to flip the pages
[31:30] Isaiah 42 we're just reading three
[31:32] verses if we get
[31:42] there Isaiah 421 goes behold my servant
[31:47] this is a prophecy given by the prophet
[31:50] Isaiah behold my servant speaking of
[31:53] Christ Jesus whom I uphold my elect in
[31:58] whom my soul delighteth I have put my
[32:01] spirit upon him he shall bring forth
[32:03] judgment to the Gentiles this is the
[32:06] only one who would be bringing judgment
[32:09] to the
[32:10] Gentiles now when we say judgment it's
[32:13] only not to judge he's bringing Justice
[32:16] to the
[32:17] Gentiles some will receive that some
[32:21] will reject it but he's the one who's
[32:23] bringing it to them he shall not cry nor
[32:26] lift up nor cause his voice to be heard
[32:29] in the
[32:31] street so any Jesus in himself could do
[32:37] nothing this is what is telling here
[32:40] anything he did he was ordained by God
[32:45] to do
[32:46] so if God didn't tell him to lift up his
[32:49] arm Jesus will not lift up his
[32:53] arm that's how submissive he was to the
[32:56] father
[32:58] if he speaks the father told him to
[33:04] speak any every move he made reflected
[33:08] God he was ordained of God so meaning he
[33:13] could do nothing in
[33:17] himself not even to lift up his voice on
[33:20] himself he couldn't do that it has to be
[33:24] God lifting up his voice through him
[33:30] AB bruised the Reed shall he not break
[33:32] he couldn't do that in
[33:34] himself if he does it the father
[33:38] ordained him to do
[33:41] that in the smoking flax shall he uh not
[33:45] quench he shall bring forth judgment
[33:48] unto truth he was there and these Greeks
[33:52] are showing
[33:54] up and remember these were stranger
[33:58] it's marvelous that when Solomon is
[34:01] dedicating the temple back 100 of years
[34:06] back Solomon knew as a prophet that the
[34:11] Gentiles will be coming too they will
[34:14] hear great news Solomon prayed for the
[34:17] Gentiles when he was praying for the the
[34:19] the children of Israel back when they
[34:22] were he was dedicating the temple let's
[34:25] go to his prayer
[34:29] one first king
[34:31] 8 chapter 8 first king we just want to
[34:36] give the
[34:38] background hope uh this
[34:41] doesn't get you to sleep stay
[34:44] [Laughter]
[34:47] awake first king chapter
[34:51] 8 uh verse 41 to 43 let's listen to
[34:56] Solomon's Prayer
[34:58] praying for you and
[35:00] me that's when the temple was dedicated
[35:04] Solomon knew that you were coming I was
[35:07] coming Salon said these are my brothers
[35:09] let me pray for them and he's saying in
[35:12] 41 he said
[35:14] moreover concerning a
[35:18] stranger a
[35:20] gentile that is not of thy People Israel
[35:25] but cometh out of a for country for thy
[35:29] name's sake for they shall hear of thy
[35:32] great name and of thy strong hand and of
[35:37] thy stretched out arm when he shall come
[35:41] and pray toward this house hear thou in
[35:44] heaven thy dwelling place and do
[35:48] according to all that the stranger
[35:50] calleth to thee for that all people of
[35:55] the earth May Know Thy Name to fear thee
[35:58] as thy People Israel and that they may
[36:01] know that this house which I have
[36:04] builded is called by thy name these Were
[36:08] Strangers they were the Gentiles the
[36:12] Greeks as they came there they went to
[36:16] find um Jesus
[36:19] disciples if they went to ask if they
[36:23] would see the mass or if they would see
[36:25] Jesus gently Philip took them to Andrew
[36:29] and both Phillip and Andrew went to
[36:32] Jesus I don't know why they might have
[36:34] told him Master they they have lived
[36:36] with him for three and a half years so
[36:38] far they knew his
[36:41] agenda and they they knew his
[36:44] nature and they went
[36:46] Master these Greek Greeks they would
[36:49] like to see
[36:50] you maybe you they anticipating them
[36:53] saying Oh not this time maybe you can
[36:56] wait maybe let them wait there or
[36:58] something now Jesus is speaking now
[37:02] speaking Eternal words in that moment as
[37:06] the Greeks were Desiring to see him as
[37:10] they made themselves known to the
[37:12] disciples the disciples brought them to
[37:14] Jesus Jesus knew that something was
[37:17] happening knew that and he said the hour
[37:21] is come knew that once they because he
[37:25] was God he was led by God that place he
[37:28] went ordained by God and knew exactly
[37:30] what would be happening and as they came
[37:33] he knew that the time is at hand for
[37:36] something amen the changing of the
[37:39] ministry amen the time has come is come
[37:45] right and look at his nature before we
[37:48] can even analyze what go through not
[37:51] analyze but but just cover what he's
[37:53] telling them look at Jesus nature we saw
[37:56] his nature
[37:58] that he could not even uh uh cause his
[38:01] voice to be
[38:02] heard because he was totally dependent
[38:06] on the will of the
[38:08] father
[38:10] Jesus do you think Jesus wants to be
[38:13] known just to brag that hey I'm Jesus no
[38:17] the Bible tells it differently if we go
[38:19] to the Book of Mark 7 you might not have
[38:21] to turn Mark
[38:24] 7 chter 7 verse 30 to3
[38:28] 7 I can start reading it and again
[38:31] deporting from the coast of Ty and sidon
[38:34] he came unto the Sea of Galilee through
[38:37] the midst of the coast of uh decapolis
[38:41] 31 32 now and they bring unto him one of
[38:45] the one that was de deaf and had an
[38:50] impediment in his speech and they
[38:53] beseeched him to put his hand upon him
[38:56] and he took him aside from the multitude
[38:59] and put his fingers into his ears and
[39:02] spit and touched his tongue and looking
[39:06] up up to heaven he sighed and said unto
[39:09] him um Eep eata EPA that is be opened
[39:17] and straight straight away his ears were
[39:20] opened and the string of his tongue was
[39:23] loosed and he spake
[39:25] plain 36 and he charged them this is
[39:29] Jesus look look his
[39:32] nature he's not somebody who wants the
[39:34] fame who wants to be known all the time
[39:37] because he wants us to be not in the
[39:40] body form he wants us in the spiritual
[39:44] way 36 he charged them that they should
[39:48] tell no man this is something great that
[39:52] has happened A great miracle there now
[39:56] he's char in them he said you have seen
[39:59] that tell no
[40:05] man but the more he charged them so much
[40:08] the more a great deal they published it
[40:11] if you go to the Book of Matthew Matthew
[40:13] also 16:15 he does the same
[40:17] thing when Simon Peter he go 16 and he
[40:21] said Matthew 16 let's let's read
[40:24] together sorry for uh going fast Matthew
[40:29] 16 and verse 15 let's read it together
[40:33] we we just trying to see the nature of
[40:36] Jesus is not somebody who said hey I
[40:39] want to do this people can know that
[40:41] Jesus is here that was not his nature
[40:44] that's right that's not him so what the
[40:47] Greeks are asking for it's something
[40:50] contrary to Jesus
[40:55] nature in Matthew 6
[40:58] he said 15 uh verse 15 he saith unto
[41:02] them but whom say ye that I am and Simon
[41:06] Peter answered and said thou are the
[41:08] Christ the son of the Living God and
[41:11] Jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[41:14] are thou Simon barjona for flesh and
[41:16] blood has not revealed it unto thee but
[41:19] my Father which is in heaven and I say
[41:21] unto I say also unto thee that thou art
[41:25] Peter and upon this Rock I will build my
[41:29] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[41:31] Prevail Prevail against it and I will
[41:35] give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom
[41:37] of kingdom of heaven and whatsoever Thou
[41:40] shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in
[41:42] heaven and whatsoever thou shal lose on
[41:44] Earth shall be Loos in heaven then
[41:48] charge he his
[41:52] disciples not that hey go tell the
[41:54] people that I'm Jesus who told you the
[41:56] Christ no he's charging his disciples
[42:00] that they should tell no man that he was
[42:03] Jesus
[42:05] Christ that's the second second witness
[42:08] let's get the third
[42:09] witness Luke
[42:13] 5 Luke Chapter
[42:18] 5 I read verse 12 to 15
[42:32] this is about the man which uh was full
[42:34] of leprosy 12 and it came to pass when
[42:38] he was in a certain city Behold a man
[42:41] full of leprosy who seeing Jesus fell on
[42:44] his face and besought him saying Lord if
[42:48] thou will thou can make me clean and he
[42:51] put forth his hand and touched him and
[42:54] saying I will be thou clean and
[42:57] immediately the Le leprosy departed from
[43:01] him and he charged
[43:06] him same
[43:08] thing to tell no
[43:12] man but go and show thyself to the
[43:15] priest and offer for thy cleansing
[43:18] according as Moses commanded for a
[43:21] testimony unto them so Jesus was not
[43:25] here on the scene to to make a
[43:29] show that I would like people to know me
[43:32] they can come and see me oh the Greek
[43:34] has have showed up my goodness this is
[43:36] an opportunity to show myself that was
[43:39] not his
[43:40] nature that was not what Jesus was here
[43:44] for and not only that the the Greek had
[43:49] to pass another another barrier another
[43:52] test too not only Jesus didn't want
[43:56] people people to know he ched them not
[43:59] to tell that I'm Jesus now the Greek
[44:03] were not of the household of
[44:07] Israel it's complicated not only he
[44:10] doesn't do the show he doesn't make a
[44:12] show out of him
[44:14] himself he always charged the people to
[44:17] tell no man that he is the Christ he's
[44:20] Jesus and now these are
[44:23] Greeks Matthew 10
[44:27] go there to
[44:31] see Matthew
[44:33] 10 10:
[44:44] 5 these 12 Jesus sent forth and
[44:47] commanded them saying go not into the
[44:50] way of the Gentiles don't even visit the
[44:54] Greeks don't visit Africa don't visit
[44:56] America America don't visit
[45:01] Europe or New Zealand Australia saying
[45:04] go not into the way of the Gentiles and
[45:07] into any city of Samar of the Samaritans
[45:11] enter ye not but go rather to the lost
[45:15] sheep of the House of Israel and as they
[45:19] go as you go preach saying the Kingdom
[45:21] of Heaven is at hand Matthew 15 just
[45:25] flip a couple of pages
[45:29] this is when the serop phenician lady
[45:33] came pleading for her
[45:36] daughter
[45:40] 15:21 then Jesus went then and departed
[45:43] into the coast of Tyron sidon and behold
[45:46] a woman of of Canaan came out of the the
[45:49] same coast and Cried unto him saying
[45:52] have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of
[45:55] David my hor is grievously vexed with
[45:59] the devil but he answered her not a word
[46:02] and his disciples came and besought him
[46:04] saying send her away for she cth after
[46:08] us but he answered and said I am not
[46:11] sent but unto the lost sheep of the
[46:14] House of isra
[46:18] Israel
[46:20] so these Greeks have had a
[46:25] tough day awaiting them because they are
[46:28] going in front of a man who is not
[46:32] making a show out of himself or out of
[46:34] his ministry and beside that he only
[46:38] came to the household of
[46:44] Israel so Jesus never wants us people to
[46:48] know him by following a certain movement
[46:51] or car pulling
[46:54] experience Jesus wants to meet people
[46:56] people individually by
[47:00] Revelation and he does that most time he
[47:03] would even sneak out living his
[47:05] disciples so it it would only be a
[47:08] secret meeting between the one who is
[47:11] Desiring to see him and himself so he
[47:15] can reveal himself not in the flesh
[47:17] because you could see the body of Jesus
[47:20] you will never get any benefit from
[47:22] it they can bring his he can bring his
[47:25] body just this evening here here walking
[47:28] there shaking hands you will get no
[47:31] virtue from that
[47:32] body no
[47:34] benefit but if you know him by
[47:38] Revelation then you have the full
[47:41] benefits of not only the full benefits
[47:44] that is above the Corporal body that you
[47:47] are seeing this is the entire Heaven
[47:50] that is available that is at your
[47:52] disposal amen for a benefit am
[47:59] so they
[48:01] came coming back to our scripture philli
[48:04] cometh and tell Andrew and again Andrew
[48:06] and philli tell Jesus and Jesus answered
[48:09] them saying the hour is come when the
[48:13] the Greeks were telling him about the
[48:14] Greeks outside Jesus knew that this is a
[48:19] sign that time is no more for the
[48:23] Jews I've got to turn to the Gentiles
[48:26] but can they cannot see me they cannot
[48:28] meet me in this way the Gentiles we meet
[48:32] on the on the
[48:35] cross is is uh Isaac had to cross his
[48:38] hand the prophet of God said that Isaac
[48:40] had to cross his hand Jo Joseph came
[48:42] with his two children he had in Egypt he
[48:45] came with them in front of Jacob his
[48:47] father sorry
[48:50] Jacob and before Jacob could uh bless
[48:54] them God is crossing his hand
[48:59] so we Gentiles so the bride could
[49:04] be brought into eternal
[49:06] life it's on the cross that we have to
[49:11] meet him and Jesus is laying this in all
[49:14] the what what he's going to be telling
[49:15] them there is is is him is the fullness
[49:19] of God bodily full of wisdom is laying
[49:25] something that is of so so
[49:27] profound from Genesis to Revelation that
[49:30] is contained in what he's going to be
[49:32] telling the Greeks at this moment let's
[49:35] go back to John
[49:41] 12 very profound that those that were
[49:46] there it would go above because some
[49:49] most of them were not even of their
[49:52] time for his disciples it had to be much
[49:55] higher for the Greek they could not
[49:57] because he was talking here from Genesis
[50:00] from before Adam and after the
[50:04] Revelation you could tie every book of
[50:06] the the Bible to every statement that
[50:09] Jesus is going to be giving in John
[50:15] 12 John
[50:19] 12
[50:20] 23 and Jesus answered them saying the
[50:24] hour is come that the son of man should
[50:27] be
[50:30] glorified he had to be glorified because
[50:33] the only the Holy Spirit could only come
[50:38] could only be made available after Jesus
[50:41] was
[50:42] glorified without his glory without
[50:45] being him not being glorified the the
[50:48] Holy Spirit was not
[50:50] available 24 he said verily verily I say
[50:54] unto you except a corn of wheat for fall
[50:57] into the ground and die it abide alone
[51:01] but if it die it bring forth much fruit
[51:05] he that loveth his life shall lose it
[51:08] and he that hate his life in this world
[51:11] shall keep it unto eternal life unto
[51:14] life
[51:15] eternal If any man serve
[51:18] me let him follow me and where I am
[51:23] there shall also my servant be if If any
[51:26] man serve me him will my father honor
[51:31] now is my soul soul troubled and what
[51:36] shall I say father save me from this
[51:40] hour but for this cause came I unto this
[51:44] hour father glorify thy name then came
[51:48] there a voice from Heaven saying I have
[51:52] both glorify it glorified it and I will
[51:55] glorify it again
[51:58] so these Greeks triggered something in
[52:00] the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ by
[52:03] them coming up in just just a little
[52:07] desire hey
[52:09] Phillip we desire to see
[52:12] Jesus not knowing that it was something
[52:16] that was pre-ordained of God that once
[52:19] this drop hits this Jesus is going to be
[52:23] speaking such profound words in such a
[52:28] way that the father had to intervene in
[52:30] that
[52:35] communication he forgot about the
[52:38] Greeks he forgot about his disciples now
[52:41] he's talking Eternal things knowing that
[52:45] no no one of them is even understanding
[52:47] what I'm talking
[52:48] about only the father could understand
[52:51] what he was saying and the father showed
[52:53] up he
[52:53] thundered and the people that were said
[52:56] he it it they heard a thunder speaking
[52:59] to the father so great that the time
[53:03] might not be allowing that to do that
[53:05] but the prophet of God said this in U in
[53:08] the
[53:11] message uh
[53:13] zakus because we know that within these
[53:17] words that Jesus is laying in chapter
[53:20] 12 he's showing us where
[53:24] when we can see him
[53:27] where to see him how to see him and how
[53:32] to know that you have seen him there
[53:34] inside here the prophet of God is saying
[53:37] this and said in preaching
[53:39] 1958 if you want to see
[53:43] him you know God will make a way for you
[53:48] to see him yes prise God Amen if you
[53:52] desire to see him this is not just hey I
[53:56] want to to see him no if there's a
[53:59] yearning amen if there's a craving
[54:02] inside of you if there something that
[54:05] probably your wife cannot even help you
[54:07] with your husband might not be able to
[54:10] help you with it's it's it's it's inside
[54:13] of you it's driving you beyond your
[54:17] explanation to anybody beside you right
[54:20] if you desire you have that yearning
[54:23] inside of you God Will Make A Way amen
[54:27] yes
[54:29] sir and the prophet of God said it may
[54:32] be
[54:35] ridiculous I love
[54:37] that it may be
[54:42] ridiculous but God will make a way for
[54:45] you to see
[54:46] him and you know you might have to even
[54:50] come to a Full Gospel business meeting
[54:52] some morning very ridiculous to you your
[54:59] prestige meaning he got to knock off
[55:03] some feathers out of
[55:07] you but if you want to see him God will
[55:12] make a way for you to see him what what
[55:15] a beautiful promise sir just come to a
[55:19] spot that you are really Desiring to see
[55:23] him brother and sister there's a sure
[55:25] promise that he will make a way for you
[55:27] to see
[55:33] him and you cannot fake that you cannot
[55:36] produce that
[55:37] yourself because the book of Romans 9:15
[55:58] 915 says for he saith to Moses I will
[56:03] have this is God telling Moses I will
[56:05] have mercy on whom I will have mercy and
[56:08] I will have compassion on whom I will
[56:11] have compassion so then it is not of him
[56:14] that willth nor of him that runneth but
[56:19] of God that showeth
[56:22] Mercy even if you are Desiring to see
[56:25] Jesus you will never produce for him to
[56:29] show up there God Will Make A Way but
[56:33] you have to
[56:35] wait cuz it's not because you can run or
[56:39] you can be willing to do that he's the
[56:41] one who shows
[56:44] Mercy now even if you run let's for
[56:47] instance if you run you are so willing
[56:50] badly to see
[56:52] him as I mentioned earlier his Corporal
[56:55] body will never never do you any
[56:57] good
[56:59] because Isaiah 53 you're familiar with
[57:02] this 23 said for he shall grow up before
[57:06] him as a tender plant and a root out of
[57:09] a dry ground he hath no form no nor
[57:14] comeliness there's no
[57:17] Beauty and when we shall see him there
[57:20] is no beauty that we should desire
[57:23] him if you Desiring him it for something
[57:27] unrelated to his Corporal
[57:30] appearance it has to be something bigger
[57:34] than what he would appear in if he would
[57:36] appear here three he is despised and
[57:41] rejected of
[57:43] men a man of sorrow and acquainted with
[57:47] grief and we hid as it were our faces
[57:50] from him he was despised and we esteemed
[57:52] him not this is the kind of if you want
[57:55] to see his Corporal
[57:57] body he there's no attraction for for
[58:01] for his body towards you that you can
[58:03] see somebody that you said this is that
[58:05] and that because we know that Judas
[58:08] Judas lived with him for 3 and a half
[58:11] years he betrayed him he saw him that's
[58:14] right so if Desiring to see Jesus does
[58:17] something good he didn't he didn't do
[58:20] good for Judah
[58:22] Judas the Young Rich Man the same way he
[58:25] saw Jesus Jus that's right he didn't
[58:27] help
[58:28] him he saw him face to face even a
[58:32] pilate right pilate saw him face to
[58:36] face Herod Herod saw him face to face
[58:41] Herod had that the same desire that the
[58:43] the Greek the Greeks
[58:46] had you don't have to turn it to Luke
[58:49] 979 it says that now Herod the tetrarch
[58:53] heard of all that was done by him and he
[58:56] was perplexed because that it was said
[58:59] of some that John was risen from the
[59:01] dead and some that Elias had appeared
[59:05] and of and of others that one of the old
[59:08] prophets was risen again and Herod said
[59:12] John have I beheaded but who is this of
[59:16] whom I hear such things and he desired
[59:21] to see
[59:22] him he had a great desire too
[59:27] and because the prophet of God says if
[59:29] you want to see him he will make a way
[59:32] he made a way for
[59:35] Herod he gave Herod an
[59:39] opportunity Luke
[59:41] 23 31 I can read it
[59:45] to give you time he was given an
[59:48] opportunity but let's see what he did
[59:50] with the
[59:54] opportunity Luke
[59:58] 23 verse
[1:00:07] three and pilate asked him saying asking
[1:00:11] Jesus pilate has been given the greatest
[1:00:14] opportunity the Greeks were fighting
[1:00:17] their way this is it was the day Jesus
[1:00:20] was at Lazarus Place 6 days before the
[1:00:23] Passover it was the next day 5 days
[1:00:25] before the Passover that these Greeks
[1:00:27] were making their ways because of the
[1:00:29] great news they wanted to see him so bad
[1:00:32] but here pilate had him in in front of
[1:00:35] him face to face with the very one that
[1:00:38] the Greeks desired so earnestly to
[1:00:43] see and he answered him and
[1:00:46] said he he said art thou the king of the
[1:00:49] Jews and he answered him and said thou
[1:00:52] say sayth it then said pilate to the
[1:00:55] chief priest and to the people I find no
[1:00:57] fault in this man that's why he
[1:01:01] could benefit from being in front of
[1:01:04] Jesus from seeing him face to
[1:01:06] face the only benefit is I find no fault
[1:01:10] with
[1:01:13] him and they were the more Fierce the
[1:01:16] saying he stir up the people teaching
[1:01:19] throughout all Jew jewelry beginning
[1:01:22] From Galilee to this place when pilot
[1:01:26] heard of Galilee he asked whether the
[1:01:28] men were a Galilean and as soon as he
[1:01:32] knew that he belonged unto
[1:01:34] herod's jur jurisdiction jurisdiction he
[1:01:39] sent him to Herod who himself also was
[1:01:44] at Jerusalem at that time God making a
[1:01:48] way for
[1:01:49] Herod because he desired to see
[1:01:53] Jesus and when Herod saw
[1:01:56] Jesus he was exceeding
[1:02:02] glad what was he exceeding glad
[1:02:06] for for he was desirous to see him of a
[1:02:11] long season so he has been planning for
[1:02:15] long Desiring maybe in his prayers if he
[1:02:20] was praying in his own ways I want to
[1:02:22] see this man so I heard great news of
[1:02:25] him is being brought to him and he does
[1:02:29] it to each and every one of
[1:02:34] us because he had heard many things of
[1:02:37] him and he hoped to have seen some
[1:02:41] miracle done by him then he questioned
[1:02:44] with him in many words but he answered
[1:02:47] him
[1:02:49] nothing as we said earlier he could only
[1:02:53] open his mouth if the father opens his
[1:02:57] mouth he could do
[1:03:00] nothing he opened not his his
[1:03:03] mouth and the chief priests and scribes
[1:03:06] stood and vehemently accused him and
[1:03:10] Herod with his Men of War set him at
[1:03:15] not and mocked him and arrayed him in a
[1:03:19] gorgeous robe and sent him again to
[1:03:23] pilate without knowing
[1:03:26] where to meet him where to see
[1:03:30] him when to see
[1:03:32] him how to see
[1:03:35] him how to know that you have seen him
[1:03:39] you can it's
[1:03:41] easy to set him at not without
[1:03:48] realizing without
[1:03:52] realizing so setting him at not meaning
[1:03:56] he was treat he was treated as
[1:04:01] unimportant we can do the same thing if
[1:04:04] we do not know exactly how to see
[1:04:08] him treated as an unimportant
[1:04:13] worthless despised
[1:04:17] disregarded the prophet of God says this
[1:04:20] in uh s we would see Jesus that's where
[1:04:24] uh you will see most of the the
[1:04:26] quotations are in this message the
[1:04:28] prophet of God preached 12 message
[1:04:31] messages on S we would see Jesus and I
[1:04:35] just picked up one the one in 1961 he
[1:04:38] preached it uh in Jeffersonville and
[1:04:41] that's uh where I base this uh uh this
[1:04:45] subject the prophet of God said and it's
[1:04:47] going to be kind of lengthy but I'm
[1:04:49] going to S it so here's the prophet of
[1:04:51] God he was praying in 1961
[1:04:55] [Music]
[1:04:56] to take a mission a reach trip he wanted
[1:04:59] to go to I think to go to Germany to go
[1:05:04] to um uh Norway and Africa in many other
[1:05:09] countries so he's praying in the morning
[1:05:12] between 9 and 10 he's breaking into a
[1:05:15] vision and in that Vision he's seeing
[1:05:19] himself entering into a
[1:05:21] store and in that store there were two
[1:05:24] counters he saw two ladies one at one
[1:05:28] store one one one counter one at the
[1:05:30] other counter now he saw a man a man
[1:05:33] walking to one of the counter counters
[1:05:36] and
[1:05:38] purchasing uh a perfume for his
[1:05:42] wife and the prophet of God stepped
[1:05:44] closer came also to ask the same lady
[1:05:48] how much is the perfume there she said
[1:05:51] oh this one is uh 40 cents you can read
[1:05:54] it in that message so I'm just going by
[1:05:57] memory here this one is 40 cents and the
[1:06:01] prophet of God said but I I I would like
[1:06:03] lilac I would like lilac because he
[1:06:06] likes the Lilac uh perfume and he said
[1:06:09] how about lilac that lady said lilac is
[1:06:12] about
[1:06:14] .98 and then the prophet of God took out
[1:06:17] of his pocket a purse or he called
[1:06:20] himself um a purse instead of a wallet
[1:06:24] he said a purse so so he took two dollar
[1:06:28] bills supposedly giving $2 dollar bills
[1:06:31] to that lady thinking that hey she's
[1:06:33] going to give giving me two two pennies
[1:06:36] back and when that lady took the money
[1:06:39] the two dollar bills she realized that
[1:06:42] one was a American Dollar and the other
[1:06:45] one was a Canadian $5
[1:06:48] bills now she said oh you have given me
[1:06:53] um a foreign money the prophet of God
[1:06:56] went and said oh I'm sorry because I'm a
[1:06:59] missionary so he was even answering God
[1:07:02] was answering his prayer within the same
[1:07:04] vision that I'm confirming that you're
[1:07:06] going to be going to the mission I'm a
[1:07:08] missionary so I go to different
[1:07:10] countries and I get different monies so
[1:07:13] give me the uh Canadian $5 bill and then
[1:07:16] the prophet gave him gave her another
[1:07:19] dollar uh $1 bill and she gave uh the
[1:07:23] changes to the prophet as she was the
[1:07:26] prophet was still talking to
[1:07:32] her that lady speaking to the other lady
[1:07:34] that was at the other
[1:07:36] counter let me start from there it's uh
[1:07:40] let me read it and he said and while I
[1:07:44] was talking all looking at her she
[1:07:47] looked over the next woman now the
[1:07:50] prophet is going to be interpreting this
[1:07:51] dream this vision for us
[1:07:55] she looked over the next woman and she
[1:07:57] kind of nodded her head and she said
[1:08:00] dear do you believe that brother
[1:08:02] brandham is
[1:08:03] right that we women today will have to
[1:08:07] live like he told us with the cutting of
[1:08:10] our hair and the wearing of our perils
[1:08:13] and like and things like that said don't
[1:08:16] you think that he is wrong in that this
[1:08:19] is one lady the one that sold the Lilac
[1:08:23] perfume to the prophet telling the other
[1:08:25] lady
[1:08:28] and she said the other lady said yes and
[1:08:31] she said go ahead honey you Ruth
[1:08:34] whatever her name was said you have the
[1:08:37] inspiration say
[1:08:39] it now the prophet is of God is going to
[1:08:42] tell us that these are two churches he's
[1:08:45] telling us one church is attacking
[1:08:50] him that he want us to live like in the
[1:08:52] old days and things like that and
[1:08:56] and but for her to do that she had the
[1:09:01] inspiration the very people that can
[1:09:04] criticize this message they are only
[1:09:07] those that are inspired to do
[1:09:11] so cuz anybody who doesn't know anything
[1:09:14] about the message will just stay away
[1:09:15] from it but for you to attack this
[1:09:18] message you must have a certain
[1:09:21] inspiration to do that that's
[1:09:24] right and World quickly I knew this is
[1:09:27] the prophet saying quickly I knew I was
[1:09:29] in the
[1:09:31] vision we're still in we want to see
[1:09:34] Jesus right so just going through this
[1:09:37] quickly I knew I was in the vision so I
[1:09:39] knew that I that that was them two women
[1:09:44] always see the both
[1:09:48] Oneness and Trinity
[1:09:51] Church the eye of an eagle is going
[1:09:54] seeing exactly those kind of those
[1:09:57] anointings the Oneness in the Trinity
[1:10:00] Church there they were standing there
[1:10:03] and said yes said I don't think we
[1:10:07] should because that's that's the the
[1:10:09] lady that was inspired to say so still
[1:10:12] continuing
[1:10:13] speaking I don't think we should because
[1:10:16] we have never seen his eyes we have
[1:10:19] never seen the eyes of
[1:10:21] Jesus we have never seen his makeup
[1:10:26] we wouldn't know what he would look
[1:10:29] like so why would we do it why would we
[1:10:35] listen to what brother brandham is
[1:10:38] saying to be
[1:10:40] modest to be letting our hair grow and
[1:10:43] everything why do we have to do that we
[1:10:45] have never even seen Jesus we don't even
[1:10:48] know how he looks like or his
[1:10:51] makeup and I had on an old Patrol suit
[1:10:54] and I said to to the woman I said just a
[1:10:56] moment my sister
[1:10:58] see you do have to live just according
[1:11:02] to the Bible no matter no matter how it
[1:11:04] was she said but we never lived back
[1:11:08] there and we never seen
[1:11:13] him that was a tough
[1:11:15] one in the prophet of God and I said I
[1:11:19] have seen
[1:11:20] him I thought Lord now I'm before two
[1:11:24] great smart
[1:11:27] churches now you got to give me wisdom
[1:11:32] this is the prophet of God the seventh
[1:11:34] angel messenger in a vision he's asking
[1:11:38] God to give him the wisdom to be able to
[1:11:43] answer these questions by inspired
[1:11:50] churches with an
[1:11:52] inspiration and so then I heard heard
[1:11:55] myself go to talking and the prophet of
[1:11:59] God said I want you to examine it I love
[1:12:03] that said I want you to examine it now
[1:12:06] listen to what the prophet is going to
[1:12:08] say excuse
[1:12:11] me never thought of it in my life I said
[1:12:16] a man today has to be like he was then
[1:12:19] because he's the same man he's made up
[1:12:22] of five senses
[1:12:25] and if he stood and looked at him right
[1:12:28] in the face he would still have to have
[1:12:32] that sick sense of Faith to believe him
[1:12:38] no matter what he looked
[1:12:40] like that's the inspiration that's the
[1:12:44] wisdom that God gave him that regardless
[1:12:46] of man today is still like the man in
[1:12:50] the old
[1:12:51] time he would still have to have that
[1:12:54] sick sense of Faith to believe him no
[1:12:57] matter what he looked like he he would
[1:13:00] have to believe him anyhow that's right
[1:13:04] and they did hid their their faces with
[1:13:07] shame that's right and said we never saw
[1:13:10] it sir like
[1:13:15] that this is just to coming back to our
[1:13:18] subject to say that seeing Jesus as a
[1:13:22] single
[1:13:23] unit and as a man as a a Corporal body
[1:13:28] as an
[1:13:29] individual standing in appearance will
[1:13:32] never do you any good no benefit if he
[1:13:36] was for benefit pilot would have had
[1:13:39] benefits herods Herod would have had
[1:13:42] benefit Judas would have had benefit but
[1:13:45] it's not that way even if he would come
[1:13:48] to to to tonight you would have no
[1:13:53] benefit no benefit at all sometimes we
[1:13:56] have that Pentecostal or Baptist mindset
[1:14:01] that if I see him appearing something
[1:14:05] will happen in my life he could be
[1:14:07] appearing all the time and you are
[1:14:11] setting him at not that's right sir
[1:14:15] because you can only see him by
[1:14:21] faith in the message we Serv we see
[1:14:25] Jesus 1957 the prophet of God said all
[1:14:29] of us want want want to see him I want
[1:14:33] to see him you want to see him and th
[1:14:36] the desire of the Christian world is to
[1:14:38] see him that was the desire of the
[1:14:41] Orthodox Jew uh world of the Jew Jewish
[1:14:45] church when Jesus came they wanted to
[1:14:48] see the Messiah but they didn't believe
[1:14:52] him when he was made
[1:14:56] manifested the main thing is when he's
[1:15:01] manifested we will see the when the the
[1:15:05] where the What the how are very
[1:15:09] important in seeing
[1:15:12] Jesus he said they didn't believe him
[1:15:15] when he was manifested and I wonder
[1:15:19] sometimes if that's just about isn't
[1:15:21] what we are to we long to see Jesus but
[1:15:25] when he appears we think it's something
[1:15:29] else we turn him
[1:15:32] down the disciples did that they want
[1:15:35] one time in the
[1:15:37] boat dark the water tossing the the boat
[1:15:40] on each side and they saw Jesus coming
[1:15:43] on the
[1:15:46] water but they were
[1:15:48] afraid they thought he was a
[1:15:50] ghost so they saw him coming but they
[1:15:53] were still afraid
[1:15:55] right so the how to see
[1:15:58] him the where to see him when to see him
[1:16:03] very critical that's right the prophet
[1:16:06] of God said in the same message knowing
[1:16:08] that there was some God
[1:16:11] somewhere and they had talking about the
[1:16:14] the the Greeks they had thousands of
[1:16:16] them that they worshiped and they had
[1:16:19] they heard they uh they would heard they
[1:16:22] have heard of a historical God that done
[1:16:25] great Miracles among the Hebrews and
[1:16:29] then they had also heard that this God
[1:16:32] that used to be the miracle working
[1:16:34] Hebrew God was over there in the land
[1:16:37] with them again that's the news that
[1:16:39] these Greeks heard the same God they
[1:16:42] used to be with them he's back in their
[1:16:44] land let's go meet him so it attracted
[1:16:48] their
[1:16:49] attention so they came to see Jesus and
[1:16:54] notied usually the way the that people
[1:16:57] want to to find Jesus is to find
[1:17:00] somebody who knows how to take them to
[1:17:04] him
[1:17:05] am a leader or one of his servants is
[1:17:09] the way they find him so Jesus if he
[1:17:12] ever
[1:17:13] chooses a servant he always chooses
[1:17:18] somebody that will bring the people to
[1:17:20] him because it's his purpose to to serve
[1:17:26] the people now when they came to Jesus
[1:17:30] Jesus didn't point to himself
[1:17:32] he this is me have you heard about me
[1:17:37] where I was
[1:17:38] born never even mentioned anything he
[1:17:42] pointed them to the word to meet him
[1:17:45] that's right let's see the word to meet
[1:17:47] him same message the prophet said now
[1:17:50] here's the great thing in the text
[1:17:53] that's unusual just just as soon as
[1:17:55] these Greeks was pointed to Jesus Jesus
[1:18:00] did not point to
[1:18:02] himself or he did not make himself known
[1:18:07] to
[1:18:08] them because you cannot
[1:18:12] know Jesus in that
[1:18:15] way the prophet of God is just tearing
[1:18:19] every conception of the seven church
[1:18:23] chages have you want to see him with
[1:18:25] nail scor SC scored hands he's tearing
[1:18:29] that everything that had been written I
[1:18:31] want to see him he will look this way in
[1:18:33] that way he said you cannot see him in
[1:18:35] that
[1:18:36] way Jesus is not known in that way we
[1:18:40] see here in the scripture that when
[1:18:42] these Greeks were brought up to Jesus
[1:18:45] and were in his presence it looks like
[1:18:48] Jesus would have said well I am the
[1:18:50] Messiah of the Jews race that's been
[1:18:53] predicted by the prophets by inspiration
[1:18:56] down through the the centuries and I'm
[1:18:58] here
[1:18:59] now and I'm the the born of Nazareth I'm
[1:19:03] of a Jewish mother my father is God and
[1:19:07] I'm here not to I'm here now to make
[1:19:09] myself known to the Greeks he didn't do
[1:19:14] that he's pointing them to something
[1:19:17] he's pointing him to himself now let's
[1:19:20] listen where how to find him how to see
[1:19:23] him in the same message he said now that
[1:19:26] would be more like the 1961 version of
[1:19:30] it if he would point to himself that's
[1:19:32] right the 2024 version of
[1:19:36] it but look as soon as they were brought
[1:19:40] in his
[1:19:41] presence that's the main thing get the
[1:19:44] people in his
[1:19:46] presence days in and days out we see the
[1:19:50] Holy Spirit using precious Brothers our
[1:19:53] pastor coming to this he's pointing you
[1:19:56] to him to his
[1:19:59] presence and as soon as in his presence
[1:20:02] Jesus said except corn of wheat falls
[1:20:05] into the ground and dies it abides alone
[1:20:09] what an unusual thing instead of
[1:20:11] accepting their
[1:20:13] introduction the thing he done was
[1:20:17] pointed them to a place that they could
[1:20:21] find him
[1:20:26] this is the revelation of our day how to
[1:20:31] see Jesus he has to point you to a place
[1:20:35] where you can find and see him let's see
[1:20:39] that place praise God what did he do
[1:20:45] here he pointed them to that great Truth
[1:20:49] how to see him they could not see him in
[1:20:52] the way of eternal life just by standing
[1:20:57] there the way he was he was a
[1:21:01] man but Christ himself pointed the
[1:21:05] people to his
[1:21:07] death and said except a corn of we falls
[1:21:11] in the ground it abides alone oh how
[1:21:14] different it
[1:21:15] is yes sir how different but your life
[1:21:20] and his life find each other
[1:21:25] your life in Jesus life you finding each
[1:21:29] other in his
[1:21:33] death where to find him to see him it's
[1:21:37] when you're dying to
[1:21:41] yourself when every me in you is
[1:21:50] gone Mary and and Martha got that chance
[1:21:54] and Lazarus they knew him that's why
[1:21:56] they could do him a service because they
[1:21:59] have seen him they have been dead to
[1:22:02] everything within them they were
[1:22:03] convinced Lazarus has nothing else to
[1:22:06] lose by by by by by testifying of Jesus
[1:22:09] right in such a way that he made the
[1:22:11] Pharisees mad they wanted to kill him
[1:22:14] back you imagine I'm I'm testifying of
[1:22:17] my resurrection so I make you so mad you
[1:22:19] want to kill me
[1:22:22] again he was completely dead to him
[1:22:24] himself amen Mary dead in such a way
[1:22:27] that her hair the beauty for her didn't
[1:22:30] mean anything
[1:22:33] right she gave it
[1:22:39] all you your life and his life find each
[1:22:42] other not at the church not in a
[1:22:45] building not in a Creed not in good
[1:22:49] works but in the cross where you are
[1:22:52] crucified with him am
[1:22:55] we want to see Jesus yes sir there's one
[1:22:58] place we can see him amen we can find
[1:23:01] him when we dying to every thought of I
[1:23:06] am this I can this when the word of God
[1:23:10] said that this is it the message of the
[1:23:13] says this you said
[1:23:16] but setting him at not that's right yes
[1:23:22] sir that's where to find Christ
[1:23:25] you don't find him by doing better
[1:23:27] turning a new page starting a new life
[1:23:29] you don't find Christ you find Christ
[1:23:33] only in death sir that's the word to to
[1:23:37] see him amen anybody who had had the
[1:23:40] privilege to see him in the revelation
[1:23:43] of the time he has to find him in death
[1:23:46] even
[1:23:47] Peter could you imagine Peter's
[1:23:50] wife your master said that unless you
[1:23:54] eat his his flesh and drink his blood
[1:23:57] honey what do you think of
[1:24:00] that Peter had no answer to his wife
[1:24:03] that's
[1:24:05] right him alone has the words of eternal
[1:24:08] life to whom would I go he became
[1:24:10] ridiculous before his wife maybe his
[1:24:12] children why because he seen him he he's
[1:24:17] he he's been dead
[1:24:22] himself you don't find him in a Manger
[1:24:25] not in a confession to believe in a
[1:24:27] certain Creed and fables you don't find
[1:24:30] Christ there it Cho a true servants
[1:24:33] takes you to him and he is the
[1:24:38] word meaning the way to see the word
[1:24:42] because Christ is the word Jesus is the
[1:24:44] word the way to see the word to find him
[1:24:47] is in
[1:24:49] death every time we come
[1:24:52] here if God can just realign our motives
[1:24:55] and objectives that every time I come
[1:24:59] God let me die more let me die more we
[1:25:02] finding him more let me die more we
[1:25:04] seeing him more that's what we we are
[1:25:07] here to be and to
[1:25:12] do and he said you want to be alive in
[1:25:15] the world and still you want to be
[1:25:17] religious so you accept an intellectual
[1:25:20] conception of it and then when you do
[1:25:23] that you will still dead in sin and
[1:25:27] trespasses he doesn't say if you go to
[1:25:30] church or if you listen to messages you
[1:25:33] go to camp meetings he said if you are
[1:25:36] still you accept an intellectual
[1:25:39] conception right you are still dead in
[1:25:42] sin and trespasses there a line
[1:25:46] there how to see
[1:25:49] him we see where we can find him we can
[1:25:52] only find him in death
[1:25:55] and once we find him in death our eyes
[1:25:58] of understanding open
[1:26:00] up then we can Behold Him we will start
[1:26:03] beholding him from
[1:26:08] Death in the same this is in one uh just
[1:26:13] one
[1:26:14] more more time lord preached in
[1:26:18] 1963 the prophet of God is showing us is
[1:26:20] telling us are you ready to die because
[1:26:24] he knows that that's the first step into
[1:26:26] meeting seeing
[1:26:29] Jesus death to myself that's death to
[1:26:33] yourself amen meeting him at the cross
[1:26:36] Amen in his death to start seeing him
[1:26:41] said are you ready to
[1:26:43] die are you Assemblies of God General
[1:26:46] Assembly are you ready to die Methodist
[1:26:48] Baptist Presbyterian or you ready to die
[1:26:52] out to your enemy are you willing to pay
[1:26:56] the
[1:26:57] price of sacrifice really
[1:27:02] sincerely this is the
[1:27:04] how the how is you've got to know that
[1:27:09] this requires a heavy
[1:27:16] price your
[1:27:19] surrounding will never give you the same
[1:27:21] consideration you used to have
[1:27:24] I know you have family members here all
[1:27:26] of us together we have some people in
[1:27:28] our family that think we're crazy can
[1:27:30] never even even when they know something
[1:27:32] about you who's
[1:27:36] that there is a heavy price to pay for
[1:27:39] this message once we come to it once we
[1:27:43] is everything else is just flying good
[1:27:47] there's a little question mark there God
[1:27:49] am I am I seeing
[1:27:52] you cuz
[1:27:55] before you can see him there's a heavy
[1:27:58] price to be
[1:28:00] paid and the prophet of God is asking us
[1:28:04] are you willing am I willing are you
[1:28:07] willing to pay the price of
[1:28:11] sacrifice really
[1:28:15] sincerely you don't know the
[1:28:18] sacrifice God might require you but are
[1:28:21] you ready said God whatever you bring my
[1:28:23] way
[1:28:26] way I'm
[1:28:31] ready we have to be ready for any
[1:28:40] sacrifice we want to see him this is how
[1:28:43] to see
[1:28:45] him we want to see him where we meet him
[1:28:49] it's in death
[1:28:55] not just come and say we'll give it a
[1:28:58] try and see how I come
[1:29:00] out no this is not a
[1:29:03] try you're not ready yet the prophet of
[1:29:07] God says if you want to give it a try
[1:29:10] you are not ready yet to see Jesus
[1:29:13] that's
[1:29:14] right right you must be ready to pay the
[1:29:19] price and die
[1:29:25] this
[1:29:26] is destruction
[1:29:29] altogether price and
[1:29:32] death sacrifice and death it's not you
[1:29:35] give sacrifice and then something good
[1:29:37] happen you give you are you ready to
[1:29:40] sacrifice and then to die to
[1:29:47] yourself your fathers your mothers are
[1:29:51] you fathers you
[1:29:53] mothers are you ready to establish an
[1:29:55] altar altar in your
[1:29:59] house and take that television out are
[1:30:02] you ready I know that most of us we
[1:30:05] don't have those we don't even know
[1:30:06] never had a television in our
[1:30:11] homes are you ready to take that deck of
[1:30:14] cards off the
[1:30:15] table them comic books that your
[1:30:19] children is reading preparing their
[1:30:20] little mind to a blast that the devil is
[1:30:23] going to them or you ready to establish
[1:30:27] the old family altar
[1:30:30] again I like he said again because we
[1:30:33] might have had it years
[1:30:35] back and we slipped we slipped
[1:30:40] out that's how to see
[1:30:44] Jesus or do you want to continue on the
[1:30:48] way you are the two choices there
[1:30:54] ready to pay the
[1:30:57] sacrifice or you are you wanting to
[1:31:00] continue the way you
[1:31:06] are you want to continue on you're not
[1:31:10] in condition of coming
[1:31:14] yet you're not in condition of meeting
[1:31:16] Jesus seeing him if you want to continue
[1:31:19] the way you're continuing
[1:31:24] but I pray that you will be like
[1:31:29] Samson you see the price and you are
[1:31:32] ready Lord let me die with
[1:31:37] them Samson had that Revelation at the
[1:31:40] end of his
[1:31:41] life when he had nothing else to lose
[1:31:45] said Lord once
[1:31:50] more realized that he had faith
[1:31:55] he had so many feathers on
[1:31:59] him that the time that came he was ready
[1:32:04] not only to sacrifice but unto
[1:32:08] death to see
[1:32:12] him in the message the
[1:32:15] Paradox
[1:32:17] was give me a few more
[1:32:20] minutes in the message the Paradox the
[1:32:23] prophet of God
[1:32:24] said that seed must
[1:32:27] die when the Greeks come to Jesus and
[1:32:30] said we would see Jesus Jesus what did
[1:32:34] he say the first thing he said except a
[1:32:36] corn of wheat falls into the ground dies
[1:32:39] it abides alone he showed them how to
[1:32:43] see
[1:32:46] him he showing them how to see
[1:32:50] him Greeks
[1:32:54] they want to see
[1:32:56] me unless they meet me in death at the
[1:33:03] cross they can see my shape there's an
[1:33:06] arm message the prophet said prophet of
[1:33:08] God say they saw his
[1:33:10] form but Jehovah was veiled to them
[1:33:13] that's right God was veiled in that body
[1:33:16] they could not see him that's right but
[1:33:18] in death they would see what was behind
[1:33:21] the person of Jesus
[1:33:27] said die to
[1:33:30] yourself die to your
[1:33:34] ethics we have some ethics of our
[1:33:37] own we want to see
[1:33:41] Jesus let get those things to
[1:33:45] die die to your Creeds and all this just
[1:33:50] be born in the word into Christ that's a
[1:33:58] paradox in the Mighty God unveiled he
[1:34:01] said the Greeks wanted to see him but
[1:34:03] they were unable to see him because he
[1:34:06] was in the temple of his
[1:34:09] Humanity God was in Christ reconciling
[1:34:12] the world to himself now we find that in
[1:34:15] this these Greeks could not see him and
[1:34:19] notice the very word that Jesus
[1:34:21] expressed to them after he said except
[1:34:23] BN of weed falls into the ground dies
[1:34:26] and abides alone in other
[1:34:30] words they would never be able to see
[1:34:34] him in the change in the mask that he
[1:34:37] was in WoW because he was veiled in
[1:34:43] human flesh but when this corn of wheat
[1:34:46] fell into the ground then it would bring
[1:34:49] forth all
[1:34:52] Races amen
[1:34:54] that's right Jesus to see Jesus it's
[1:34:58] more than one individual that's right
[1:35:00] you want to see all the
[1:35:03] races he was he was sent to the Jews of
[1:35:07] course at that time but this corn of
[1:35:10] wheat must for veiled God in human flesh
[1:35:14] hidden from
[1:35:16] unbelievers but revealed to Believers I
[1:35:19] know the time is flying I'm not even
[1:35:21] halfway yet but going there
[1:35:26] these Greeks came a little bit
[1:35:29] early that's
[1:35:31] right they came a bit early am cuz Jesus
[1:35:36] came in the morning he revealed himself
[1:35:38] to the
[1:35:39] Jews at noon he's revealing himself to
[1:35:43] the Samaritan because they were to see
[1:35:46] him right they these Jews were these
[1:35:49] Greeks were in the afternoon they should
[1:35:52] have waited in the evening time in the
[1:35:56] evening time would take 2,000 years they
[1:36:01] came early that's why Jesus said it's
[1:36:04] not time
[1:36:06] yet it was six
[1:36:09] days before the Passover thir Church
[1:36:13] ages they had to wait at the end of the
[1:36:16] seventh
[1:36:17] day this is the time that the Jew the
[1:36:21] Greeks could come and say we want to see
[1:36:24] Jesus and let me read something as we
[1:36:27] the musicians you can
[1:36:36] come the prophet of God says this in the
[1:36:38] message to see
[1:36:40] Jesus preached
[1:36:44] 1954 he said why don't he go down to the
[1:36:48] graveyard talking about the the
[1:36:50] Pharisees and those people that were
[1:36:52] criticizing him why don't he go down to
[1:36:57] the graveyard if he's the son of God and
[1:37:00] say all the people in the grave come out
[1:37:04] he could have done it the prophet of God
[1:37:07] said he could have done
[1:37:09] it if the father would have told him
[1:37:15] to because he could do nothing unless he
[1:37:20] seen it from the
[1:37:21] father but the father only showed him
[1:37:25] and he was submissive to the
[1:37:30] father and the same signs that followed
[1:37:34] Jesus Vision telling him what to do and
[1:37:38] how to do it Jesus did that in the world
[1:37:42] houss anything they wanted to he went on
[1:37:45] about the father's business that same
[1:37:48] Jesus is here tonight
[1:37:52] am now when the prophet of preaching in
[1:37:55] 1954 he's here 70 years later in
[1:37:59] 2024 that Jesus is here tonight
[1:38:04] amen do you believe
[1:38:06] it I believe it amen he will manifest
[1:38:10] himself in that way will you take all
[1:38:14] doubt out of your mind and go away from
[1:38:17] here tonight and do everything you can
[1:38:20] to get Sinners to come and be saved and
[1:38:24] sick people to be healed and confessing
[1:38:26] your sin and die to yourself if he will
[1:38:30] come he he who's listen he who is
[1:38:34] listening now if he will come and
[1:38:37] manifest
[1:38:38] himself he asked for the hands up I
[1:38:41] don't ask you for uh raising your hands
[1:38:44] up but he said now now people can see
[1:38:51] Jesus only in
[1:38:54] you let's
[1:38:59] stand the way you do now the people can
[1:39:03] see Jesus only in you how do they see
[1:39:07] him the way you
[1:39:10] do the way you act amen the way you
[1:39:14] live is how the people know Jesus today
[1:39:20] so the Greeks asked him the burden is
[1:39:25] upon us amen he said no I I cannot tell
[1:39:28] you who I am now I cannot show myself to
[1:39:32] you sister Karen will be my face in
[1:39:38] 2024 brother John will be my face in
[1:39:42] 2024 it's you and me that have that
[1:39:47] heavy heavy
[1:39:50] responsibility that the world
[1:39:53] could see Jesus again
[1:39:56] amen this is the
[1:39:59] only if his body comes here there's no
[1:40:02] help but within your body and my body
[1:40:05] there is still the help to the needy to
[1:40:07] the world right let's bow our heads
[1:40:09] together in prayer precious Heavenly
[1:40:13] Father your word
[1:40:16] is it's no longer a word of a prophet to
[1:40:21] us you have come and visited us yourself
[1:40:25] this is you I'm no longer seeing you as
[1:40:27] a
[1:40:29] word I'm seeing my Lord everything every
[1:40:32] time I read it and I listen to it it's
[1:40:36] you and father we
[1:40:41] know Through the
[1:40:46] Ages man has tried to see
[1:40:51] you and Lord we want not even looking
[1:40:53] for you we didn't even not
[1:40:57] know but yet we were in you and we came
[1:41:01] this
[1:41:02] way smitten with
[1:41:05] amnesia we started just acting like
[1:41:10] chickens but father thank you for that
[1:41:13] scream of the mother
[1:41:15] Eagle that scream has brought life to us
[1:41:19] Lord that scream let it father not only
[1:41:25] take Lord off all the feathers off of us
[1:41:29] but transform us father into the very
[1:41:33] image of the great
[1:41:35] Jehovah that father our neighbors our
[1:41:39] acquaintance those around us Lord they
[1:41:42] are Desiring to see
[1:41:45] you Lord would you use our
[1:41:49] bodies the very life that inside of this
[1:41:52] body
[1:41:54] is to be the reflection of yourself to
[1:41:58] others and father we thank you for the
[1:42:02] blood that has done this work in our
[1:42:05] lives We Believe Lord that your blood
[1:42:08] has washed us and cleanse us from every
[1:42:10] filth Lord that we've been exposed
[1:42:13] to and you are now father molding us
[1:42:17] shaping us into in so much that when the
[1:42:22] people that came to
[1:42:24] Paul they wanted to touch His
[1:42:27] Garment and who they saw they saw
[1:42:31] you Peter and and
[1:42:35] James the the gate beautiful they
[1:42:38] reflected you they people were even
[1:42:40] aware that these are ignorant they don't
[1:42:42] know
[1:42:43] nothing but one thing they knew was they
[1:42:47] have been with
[1:42:48] you in so much with you that father they
[1:42:52] reflected you the people could see
[1:42:54] yourself reflected in them Lord help us
[1:42:58] on our walk we we weak with children
[1:43:02] forgive us father of any chall things we
[1:43:07] we might have lingered on father doing
[1:43:09] or acting and not reflecting
[1:43:13] you but Lord your word has set us free
[1:43:16] and we know for sure that we that father
[1:43:20] you will do it let your life of this
[1:43:22] word come inside of
[1:43:24] us to live out father the full
[1:43:27] expression of your being we thank you
[1:43:29] tonight bless your children and sorry
[1:43:32] for taking l a little longer and father
[1:43:35] go with us and bless us and we'll
[1:43:38] glorify your name in Jesus Christ and we
[1:43:40] pray
[1:43:42] amen any little song There
[1:43:47] Brother All I want to see is Jesus
[1:43:55] oh all I want to
[1:43:58] see is him in
[1:44:03] me all I want to see is
[1:44:10] Jesus
[1:44:13] shineing Through
[1:44:16] Me
[1:44:18] Oh all I want to see is
[1:44:26] Jesus all I want to
[1:44:29] see is him in
[1:44:34] me all I want to see is
[1:44:41] Jesus
[1:44:44] shining through
[1:44:49] me
[1:44:51] amen how many of us want to see see
[1:44:54] Jesus amen question is are we willing to
[1:44:57] die and then find him where he is it was
[1:45:02] so amazing while he was ministering just
[1:45:04] so many things were coming to me things
[1:45:07] that we've known we've known for so long
[1:45:09] but we know what form he dwells in now
[1:45:10] he's in the form of his
[1:45:12] bride cuz when if a seed abides
[1:45:16] alone it's alone but if it fall into the
[1:45:19] ground and die he says it bringeth forth
[1:45:22] much fruit he said that's how you'll see
[1:45:25] me Gentiles you'll see me after I go
[1:45:27] into the ground and die and come up a
[1:45:29] many membered body amen that's how
[1:45:31] you'll see him but if we want the World
[1:45:34] to See Jesus then we must be a display
[1:45:36] of Jesus Christ and what was Jesus Jesus
[1:45:39] had died to himself and he only did that
[1:45:41] which the father showed him so if I'm
[1:45:43] going to be the display of Jesus I have
[1:45:45] to die to myself and only do that which
[1:45:47] the word tells me to do to be a display
[1:45:51] of the word to be a display of Christ I
[1:45:53] have to be lined up to the word just
[1:45:55] like Jesus was lined up to the
[1:45:57] word amen that's what I want to do is I
[1:46:01] want to be someone that that Jesus can
[1:46:04] shine himself through so that they can
[1:46:06] see
[1:46:07] Jesus amen it's going to take a
[1:46:09] surrender and a sacrifice like the
[1:46:11] brother was saying of our thinking of
[1:46:13] our ways of our desires and surrendering
[1:46:15] to
[1:46:16] his and then the other side of that
[1:46:20] every time we run into Calamity and
[1:46:22] trouble and
