[16:47] days and uh I didn't want to read them
[16:49] fast I just took a stack and I would sit
[16:51] in my seat with a couple of coffee and
[16:53] read them slow and it took me 3 days to
[16:55] get through the mall and I just want to
[16:56] say I love you all so much you guys are
[16:58] so
[16:59] kind to us and so encouraging and we

[17:12] thank sister Donna Howard for the cake
[17:13] it was
[17:15] wonderful amen uh and also for the Youth
[17:18] who were singing that was very very
[17:20] special my heart was in a puddle in my
[17:23] shoes I was I was a mess I was glad I
[17:26] didn't have to say anything that day
[17:28] because
[17:29] I was overwhelmed actually quite
[17:31] overwhelmed appreciate Brother Kyle for
[17:34] organizing that part of it and brother
[17:36] Jeremy for the things he said I I felt
[17:38] sorry for him for having to stay there
[17:40] stand there and say those things and
[17:42] somebody sent me a recording of it and I
[17:43] still haven't been able to go back and
[17:45] listen to it it just breaks me up too
[17:46] much but maybe I'll grow up and get
[17:49] tough and be able to listen to it here
[17:52] soon but uh we appreciated the cards
[17:54] were beautiful the things you wrote
[17:56] we're undeserving of but we're thankful
[17:58] for the love that you Express and also
[18:00] the gifts and tokens of affection I just
[18:02] want to say thank you all so very much
[18:05] you never know what you all mean to us
[18:07] and and I I I thank God that he's put us
[18:10] together amen amen in reality we really
[18:14] didn't choose each other God chose but
[18:18] I'm happy with his choice and I thank
[18:20] God for it I was actually um here on a
[18:24] Saturday at the prayer time praying um a
[18:27] couple months ago maybe I don't remember
[18:29] exactly and I was really burdened with
[18:31] some things that I was burdened about
[18:33] some issues and some decisions and and I
[18:35] was actually a little bit complaining
[18:38] that I have to carry these burdens and
[18:40] make these decisions and I was asking
[18:41] God for help and and just kind of
[18:44] expressing that it's too much and and
[18:46] then oh man I got rebuked so bad I know
[18:48] right where I was I was right about
[18:49] where Donovan is crossing this way and I
[18:52] got rebuked so hard and I thought my
[18:55] goodness God's called me to preach the
[18:58] gospel I have that calling and I can't
[19:00] change that but of all the places to
[19:02] preach and of all the people to
[19:04] fellowship with I feel like the luckiest
[19:06] preacher of all and I was just looking
[19:09] at the picture the wrong way I was
[19:11] looking at burdens I was looking at
[19:12] stress I was looking at tough
[19:14] circumstances but when God shifted my
[19:16] thinking all of a sudden I said thank
[19:18] you God there's people who love to work
[19:20] for your gospel there's people who love
[19:21] to come and hear the word there's people
[19:23] who pull service after service after
[19:26] service they sing they work they labor
[19:29] and I'm the luckiest Pastor on the
[19:31] planet of the earth and that God's let
[19:33] me preach here so I going to say I love
[19:35] you all very much thank you for being so
[19:38] steadfast and constant and always making
[19:41] life easy it's easy to preach here
[19:44] because the hunger for the word amen and
[19:47] I feel blessed I feel privileged I came
[19:50] across this quote I'd like to read to
[19:51] you in the
[19:53] token he said look you know what it's
[19:56] your tithe and offerings that I live by
[19:59] it's your support here at the church
[20:00] that I have somebody to preach to It's
[20:03] Your Love and your amens and your
[20:04] fellowship and your kind words amongst
[20:07] out in the in the world there where you
[20:09] go to to different states across a
[20:11] nation it's your words that helps take
[20:13] the message it's you we are Partners in
[20:16] this with Christ we are brothers and
[20:17] sisters and he is our King amen so I
[20:21] just want to say God bless you for the
[20:22] last 10 years it's been wonderful and I
[20:25] pray that God will help us to be
[20:27] faithful for however anym he he wants he
[20:30] desires and he permits and I'm I'm
[20:33] looking forward to see what he'll do
[20:34] next amen let's all stand
[20:38] together let's if we can turn to Second
[20:41] Timothy Chapter
[20:44] 2 and look into the
[20:48] word and we just want to we just want to
[20:51] thank God for his
[20:53] faithfulness there's no man that's been
[20:56] faithful none
[20:59] God's been
[21:01] faithful there's no there's no Pastor
[21:04] that's been faithful and there's no
[21:06] congregation member that's been faithful
[21:08] there's been no faithful Deacon and no
[21:10] faithful trustee it's God who's been
[21:12] faithful but we thank God for The Men
[21:15] Who yield themselves who sacrifice who
[21:17] surrender we appreciate that we want to
[21:19] always be thankful for that but we
[21:21] always want to recognize it's God it's
[21:24] God who both Wills causes us to will and
[21:27] do of his good pleasure
[21:29] and it's him in us and so we're thankful
[21:31] for that and we just trust him he who's
[21:33] been faithful in the past who he began a
[21:35] good work in us we'll finish it amen and
[21:38] we believe that amen let's as as we look
[21:41] at second Timothy let's go to chapter
[21:43] 2 and uh read verse 19 to 21 2 Timothy
[21:49] 2:1 19- 21 nevertheless the foundation
[21:52] of God stand ass sure having this seal
[21:54] that the Lord knoweth them that are his
[21:57] and that every one of you that named the
[21:58] name of Christ depart from iniquity but
[22:01] in a great house there are not only
[22:02] vessels of gold and of silver but also
[22:04] of wood and of Earth and some to honor
[22:06] and some to dishonor if a man therefore
[22:09] Purge himself from these he shall be a
[22:11] vessel unto honor Sanctified and meet
[22:13] for the Master's use and prepared unto
[22:16] every good work amen God bless you as
[22:19] you have your
[22:20] seats we ask God to open our eyes to see
[22:24] his word amen as we look into his word
[22:28] I'd like to preach on a subject this uh
[22:31] evening of a vessel unto honor a vessel
[22:34] unto honor and I I've been trying my
[22:37] best to turn over a new leaf and on
[22:39] Wednesday nights just to preach around
[22:41] an hour and I've not been super
[22:43] successful the last Wednesday I was I
[22:46] don't know if anybody took note but I
[22:47] was so proud of myself amen so because I
[22:50] was proud of myself I'll probably fail
[22:51] tonight but I'm trying so I I am mindful
[22:55] of work schedules and school schedules
[22:57] and I I understand that and I I want you
[22:59] to know I'm aware of that and so that is
[23:01] my intention you know and and U I thank
[23:05] God that brother brandham all the time
[23:06] says I'm just going to preach for 20 or
[23:08] 30 minutes then he goes an hour and a
[23:10] half hour and 45 minutes so I'm thankful
[23:12] that that at least we have that
[23:15] example amen but also we want God to
[23:18] have his way amen we're Mindful and we
[23:21] want to be realistic about where we are
[23:23] in life and the the people's work
[23:25] schedules and school schedules but we
[23:27] also want God to take his Liberty and
[23:29] when the atmosphere is right and the
[23:30] word is coming forth we're not going to
[23:32] shut him down amen but Our intention and
[23:35] I've been trying to come to the pull pit
[23:36] with narrowing my thought down and not
[23:38] trying to bring so much in so that we
[23:40] can be mindful of that so I say that to
[23:42] say this pull
[23:44] fast pull fast and hard and we'll we'll
[23:48] work together amen we'll labor together
[23:51] amen when we when we look here at second
[23:54] Timothy in this scripture uh in verse 21
[23:58] it says if a man therefore Purge himself
[24:00] from these he shall be a vessel unto
[24:03] honor Sanctified and meat for the
[24:04] Master's use and prepared unto every
[24:07] good work uh let's turn now to Romans
[24:10] chapter
[24:14] 9 Romans chapter
[24:25] n Romans chapter 9 and and verse
[24:30] 20 nay but oh man who art thou that
[24:33] repliest against God shall the thing
[24:35] form say to him that formed it why hast
[24:37] Thou made me thus ha not the Potter
[24:39] power over the clay of the same lump to
[24:42] make one vessel into honor and another
[24:44] into dishonor what if God willing to
[24:46] show his wrath and to make his power
[24:48] known endured with much long suffering
[24:50] the vessels of Wrath fitted to
[24:51] destruction that he might make known The
[24:53] Riches of his glory on the vessels of
[24:55] Mercy which he had a four prepared unto
[24:57] Glory even us so what are the vessels of
[25:00] mercy and the vessels of Honor us even
[25:03] us whom he hath called not of the Jews
[25:05] only but also of the Gentiles so here in
[25:08] verse or chapter n we we see this
[25:12] description of a Potter and making
[25:15] vessels out of clay and one vessel into
[25:17] honor and another vessel into dishonor
[25:20] dishonor and how can we how can we
[25:22] complain against God why has me why hast
[25:25] Thou made me thus does he not have P
[25:27] power over the play to make one this way
[25:30] and one that way and so we know that God
[25:32] is the great Potter and he has made us
[25:34] the way he wants us to be amen and some
[25:36] vessels under honor and some under
[25:38] dishonor but if we look at this analogy
[25:41] we're looking at here in the scriptures
[25:43] this example he's taking clay because
[25:45] the Potter is molding clay so both
[25:47] vessels are made out of clay and so that
[25:51] you will understand we are all made out
[25:52] of clay so we're all vessels amen we're
[25:55] all vessels that The Potter's made some
[25:57] are to honor and someone to dishonor but
[26:00] they're all made out of the same
[26:01] substance they're all made out of Earth
[26:03] they're all made out of
[26:04] clay so just to uh uh just to set the
[26:08] foundation here I I would like to make
[26:10] this statement it's not what the vessel
[26:12] is made of that makes it a vessel under
[26:15] honor it's what's in the vessel that
[26:19] makes it a vessel under honor and a
[26:21] vessel under dishonor because I can take
[26:23] two vessels of clay and I can fashion
[26:26] one with the intent that I'll make get a
[26:28] garbage can yeah right and the other one
[26:32] I can set to be a place to catch all my
[26:34] loose chain and coins or I can put gold
[26:37] gold coins or gold nuggets in it amen
[26:39] and one would be a vessel into honor one
[26:41] would be a vessel into dishonor because
[26:42] of the purpose I purposed it for and I
[26:45] need the trash can it serves a purpose
[26:47] in my home it has a there's a point to
[26:49] making it that way God does everything
[26:51] for a purpose and with a point and
[26:53] nothing's wasted but it's not and listen
[26:56] it's not the material that makes it
[26:58] honorable or dishonorable it's what it's
[27:01] made for and what's inside of it so it's
[27:04] not our clay that is Honorable it's not
[27:07] our vessel it's not us amen God said
[27:10] brother benam even said amen it's not
[27:11] the person that comes predestinated but
[27:13] it's the seed amen so it's that part of
[27:16] God that he or he purposed to be in your
[27:19] clay vessel that makes it a vessel and
[27:22] honor because he appointed it to be so
[27:24] he desired it he fashioned it for that
[27:27] purpose that that makes it a vessel unto
[27:29] honor and when Paul and Timothy was
[27:31] saying that there's so many different
[27:34] kinds of vessels in any house gold and
[27:36] silver and and clay and Earth and there
[27:39] there's so many vessels with so many
[27:40] purposes but if we will be a separated
[27:43] purged a vessel amen Sanctified will be
[27:47] fit for the Master's use which means
[27:49] everything that would be dishonorable
[27:52] has to be cast out of it so that which
[27:54] is Honorable can be inside amen right
[27:57] amen so we we we need to be purged from
[28:00] the things of the world separated from
[28:03] the things that are dishonorable and fit
[28:05] for the Master's use that we could be a
[28:06] vessel unto honor to serve his
[28:09] purpose to be filled with his Spirit to
[28:12] be a vessel unto
[28:14] honor now in the message why Christ
[28:17] speak brother benam says Moses being
[28:18] born with this great gift of faith then
[28:21] he was anointed and commissioned at the
[28:23] burning bush to deliver God's people now
[28:25] see what great qualities this man had he
[28:28] he was born for a certain thing God had
[28:30] a purpose in it God's got a purpose of
[28:33] you being here if you can only get to
[28:37] that place how much trouble you'll save
[28:39] God and yourself
[28:42] too I like that quote I've heard it I've
[28:45] heard it quoted many times I I've I've
[28:47] quoted it myself I've thought of it if
[28:49] we can only be get to that place how
[28:52] much trouble you'll save God in
[28:53] yourselves so to get to what place God
[28:55] has got a purpose of you being here so
[28:57] that's to get to your place of purpose
[28:59] amen so I've I've looked at that many
[29:02] times and I've talked about that many
[29:04] times but I realize also the quote if
[29:06] there's no understanding that comes with
[29:08] the quote it can also be something that
[29:10] causes anxiety and causes stress because
[29:12] if I don't get to my position of purpose
[29:15] I'm causing myself and God a lot of
[29:18] trouble right has anybody ever heard
[29:20] that and said I just wish I knew what my
[29:22] purpose was so I don't cause God any
[29:24] trouble amen so I want to I want to look
[29:26] at that because I would like to dispel
[29:28] that kind of thinking amen hopefully we
[29:31] can so he's talking about Moses was born
[29:35] with a gift of faith and Moses was born
[29:37] for a purpose and you're born for a
[29:40] purpose you've got a purpose of being
[29:42] here and if you can only get to that
[29:44] place how much trouble you'll save God
[29:46] and yourself too then he goes on says
[29:48] Moses born and then he was afterwards he
[29:52] was brought to the place where he was
[29:54] anointed and notice the seed laying
[29:57] there with an intellect ual conception
[29:59] with all the faith that he was born to
[30:01] deliver this people and yet it never
[30:03] came to life until that light from the
[30:05] burning bush flashed across it until he
[30:08] seen not something he read about but
[30:11] something he seen with his eyes
[30:13] something that spoke to him and he spoke
[30:15] back to it oh how that did bring things
[30:18] to life I think any man or woman boy or
[30:22] girl and I think in an intellectual
[30:24] conception of what they think the word
[30:26] is and so we're never can have a full
[30:28] Foundation stand until they have met
[30:31] that light that brings that word to
[30:34] reality so if we can talk about coming
[30:37] to our purpose that place to save God
[30:40] and ourselves a lot of trouble maybe
[30:42] let's just for the for the sake of this
[30:44] service and just for me let's not think
[30:46] about it as as finding your your
[30:49] position your place as far as a job to
[30:52] do but your position in Christ that
[30:54] comes through the new
[30:56] birth because there was a lot of trouble
[30:59] amen with Moses he created a lot of
[31:01] trouble for himself and a lot of trouble
[31:02] for God until he met the burning bush
[31:05] and when he met the burning bush that
[31:06] meeting with the Burning Bush brother
[31:08] benam said Quicken that seed that was
[31:09] within him before it was an intellectual
[31:12] Faith he knew by what his mother taught
[31:14] him that he was born to be a deliverer
[31:16] he knew what the promise was he knew the
[31:18] season was but when he went to try to do
[31:21] it on his own accord with his own
[31:22] ability he failed miserably caused a
[31:25] bunch of problems ran off for 40 years
[31:27] into the the Wilderness and wandered
[31:29] around following his father-in-law's uh
[31:31] uh goats
[31:34] sheep until he met a pillar of fire
[31:36] until he be come under that brother B
[31:38] said until he was anointed amen until he
[31:40] met the pillar of fire something that
[31:42] was real something that spoke back to
[31:44] him something that gave him his position
[31:46] and his commission it wasn't different
[31:48] than what he understood it was different
[31:51] because now it came to life amen
[31:54] right right amen amen that would save us
[31:59] a lot of
[32:00] trouble if we came to that position to
[32:03] the New Birth amen by meeting a living
[32:06] God face to face and recognizing who we
[32:11] are
[32:13] amen so let's turn to Acts chapter
[32:24] n Acts chapter 9: 3
[32:33] in Acts
[32:35] 9:3 this is the story of Paul he Saul at
[32:38] this time says as he journeyed he came
[32:41] near Damascus and suddenly there shined
[32:43] round about him a light from heaven and
[32:45] he fell to the Earth and heard a voice
[32:46] saying unto him Saul Saul why
[32:48] persecutest thou me and he said who art
[32:50] thou Lord and and the Lord said I am
[32:52] Jesus whom thou persecuted it is hard
[32:54] for thee to kick against the Pricks Here
[32:57] Comes PA Paul previously known as Saul
[33:00] coming down the road and we know why
[33:02] he's traveling we know what condition
[33:05] he's in he's in he's in good standing in
[33:08] the church he's a religious zealot he is
[33:10] trying to fight this new sect of of of
[33:13] of the Christians he's he's fighting for
[33:16] the word he's fighting for the law of
[33:17] Moses he's in good standing with the
[33:19] chief elders and the chief priest and
[33:21] he's got letters to go to Damascus now
[33:24] to to re them in and to stop this new
[33:26] Revival that's going forth but as he
[33:28] goes down the road he's going to meet a
[33:31] pillar of fire he's going to meet that
[33:33] same one that Moses met in the burning
[33:34] bush and that one's going to bring to
[33:36] life what is really inside the Apostle
[33:39] Paul amen Saul amen it's not that he
[33:41] doesn't love the word it's not that he
[33:43] doesn't want to stand for the word it's
[33:45] not that he doesn't want to serve God's
[33:47] purpose it's not that he doesn't want to
[33:49] serve God's people but he's doing it
[33:52] intellectually but he's got to meet the
[33:54] living word amen to Quicken that thing
[33:56] to life the change him for his real
[33:59] purpose and his real purpose wasn't much
[34:01] different than the purpose he was
[34:02] serving but he was going the wrong
[34:06] direction Moses was going the wrong
[34:09] direction but God brought him back in
[34:13] lineen so let's go down to verse 10
[34:17] now uh the Lord speaks to ananas and he
[34:20] says verse 10 and there was a certain
[34:23] disciple of Damascus named ananas and to
[34:26] him said the Lord in a vision ananas and
[34:28] he said behold I am here Lord and the
[34:30] Lord said unto him arise and go into the
[34:32] street which is called straight and
[34:34] inquire in the house of Judas for one
[34:36] called Saul of Tarsus for behold he
[34:39] prayeth and he seeth in a vision a man
[34:41] named ananas coming in and putting his
[34:43] hand on him that he might receive his
[34:45] sight then ananas answered Lord I have
[34:48] heard but many I have heard by many of
[34:50] this man how much evil he hath done to
[34:53] the Saints at Jerusalem and here he ha
[34:55] Authority from the chief priest to bind
[34:57] all that call on thy name but the Lord
[34:59] said unto him go thy way for he is a
[35:02] chosen vessel unto me this is a vessel
[35:05] unto
[35:07] honor he's been acting
[35:10] dishonorably and that's what ananas was
[35:12] seeing that's what he's relating back to
[35:14] the Lord he looked like a vessel of
[35:16] Dishonor but God knew he's a chosen
[35:18] vessel he's a chosen vessel unto me to
[35:21] Bear my name before the Gentiles and
[35:22] Kings and the children of Israel for I
[35:25] will show him how great things he must
[35:27] suffer for my name's sake amen let's go
[35:30] now to Philippians quickly there's a
[35:32] couple scriptures I want to hit
[35:34] quickly while we're talking about
[35:36] Paul if we could hit Philippians chapter
[35:39] 3 now for just a
[35:47] second Philippians
[35:52] 3
[35:55] oh 3 verse 4 four though I might also
[35:59] have confidence in the flesh if any
[36:02] other man thinketh that he hath whereof
[36:03] he might Trust In the Flesh I more
[36:06] circumcised The Eighth Day of the stalk
[36:08] of Israel The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew
[36:10] of the Hebrews as touching the law a
[36:12] Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the
[36:14] church touching the righteousness which
[36:16] is in the law
[36:18] blameless but what things were gained to
[36:20] me those I count loss for Christ yay
[36:22] doubtless and I count all things but
[36:24] loss for the Excellency of the knowledge
[36:26] of Christ Jesus my lord for whom I have
[36:29] suffered the loss of all things and do
[36:30] count them but dung that I may win
[36:34] Christ here comes the Apostle Paul and
[36:38] and when you look at the way Paul is
[36:40] approaching uh Ministry or Paul's
[36:43] approaching maybe his calling amen he's
[36:46] doing so
[36:48] intellectually he's doing so with church
[36:50] backing he's doing so with intellectual
[36:53] understanding of of the the Bible he's
[36:55] doing so with Bible School teaching he's
[36:57] doing so amen with letters of authority
[37:00] he's given permission he's got backing
[37:02] he's got education he's got everything
[37:05] going for him he's going this is the way
[37:08] the denominations like to do it this is
[37:09] the way mankind likes to do it this is
[37:12] with all strength and with all power
[37:14] amen but this is not how God wants to do
[37:16] it amen God is going to do something but
[37:18] it's it's still in Paul to do it he's
[37:20] still a chosen vessel he just is going
[37:23] about it the wrong way he's using
[37:25] intellect and power and support and all
[37:28] of these things Amen to go about doing
[37:31] amen doing what he believes is the work
[37:33] of the Lord but when he meets the pillar
[37:35] of fire amen there's going to be a
[37:37] change inside of him and that in that
[37:39] change he's going to Cast Away
[37:41] everything that was a strength before
[37:43] and he's going to become unsupported
[37:45] he's going to I mean he can't give up
[37:47] his education but he cast it away as
[37:49] dung because he realizes all I ever
[37:51] learn led me the wrong way I had the
[37:53] wrong interpretation the wrong
[37:55] understanding I missed the Manifest
[37:57] station I persecuted the very godm made
[38:00] flesh amen the very word for my day amen
[38:02] that I wanted I was
[38:04] fighting so now he has to cast it all
[38:07] away and now he moves out and when he
[38:09] moves out he moves out with no support
[38:12] no special education there is no new
[38:15] University of the new Nazarene church
[38:19] right he's just moving out by the power
[38:22] of God he's moving out amen with the
[38:25] Simplicity of that calling that's
[38:27] awakened in him and realize he's a
[38:29] chosen vessel he's a vessel of Honor but
[38:32] not honor the way the world sees honor
[38:35] he looked like a vessel of Honor
[38:37] before but to the world he looked like a
[38:39] vessel of Dishonor now yeah yeah
[38:44] Amen in in the book of Acts we don't
[38:47] have to turn there but I'll just you
[38:49] know it well when Paul and Barnabas go
[38:51] out preaching and they go preaching and
[38:53] the the Jews reject them he said it was
[38:55] needful that the gospel should come to
[38:57] you first but seeing how you put it from
[38:59] you Lo we turn to the Gentiles and then
[39:01] he recites the scripture he says for for
[39:04] Lo the Lord has said unto us that I will
[39:06] send you as a light to the Gentiles for
[39:08] the Salvation to the ends of the
[39:11] world and all of a sudden you realize
[39:14] he's quoting
[39:16] Isaiah he's quoting the book of Isaiah
[39:19] and when you go back and look Isaiah
[39:22] those scriptures are scriptures speaking
[39:24] of Jesus Christ am
[39:28] yes so now Paul when he leaves honor
[39:33] when he leaves education when he leaves
[39:35] power and he goes God's provided way and
[39:39] humility and simplicity now it proves
[39:42] he's a vessel of Honor because what's in
[39:44] him amen he is now the vessel that God
[39:48] is going to fulfill the prophecy of
[39:50] Isaiah now it's Christ working through
[39:53] him Amen to bring the light to the
[39:56] Gentiles and he says I've set thee to be
[39:58] a light to the Gentiles what is he who
[40:01] is Paul he's a clay vessel like every
[40:03] other clay vessel that's on the face of
[40:05] the Earth what's different is who's
[40:07] inside of Paul and the prophecy the word
[40:10] that Paul's living out is a light to the
[40:12] Gentiles for salvation to the end of the
[40:18] world Paul's demotion was a
[40:21] promotion his downgrade was an upgrade
[40:24] that's
[40:25] right Amen to so we find that that God
[40:29] has no
[40:31] problem God has no problem taking
[40:36] scriptures that he gave to Isaiah
[40:39] hundreds of years before and now telling
[40:41] Paul you're the Fulfillment of that when
[40:44] the scripture is clearly speaking of
[40:47] Christ that's a vessel un honor amen you
[40:53] couldn't tell by looking on the outside
[40:54] it was a clay pot yeah
[40:59] in so much that one of the greatest
[41:01] works of the Apostle Paul one of the
[41:04] greatest that things that was achieved
[41:06] through that man through that
[41:08] Ministry was really this is just my
[41:11] opinion so I might be wrong but it
[41:13] really wasn't the Miracles that were
[41:15] wrought by his hand really wasn't the
[41:18] Miracles that's in my in my mind in my
[41:20] opinion the way I view things it really
[41:23] wasn't even just his missionary Journeys
[41:25] although they were tremendous
[41:27] but I think the greatest achievement
[41:28] that was brought through that vessel was
[41:31] the
[41:32] letters that he wrote which is the New
[41:35] Testament that we read
[41:37] now as effective as the Miracles were
[41:40] they only affected so many people that
[41:42] saw them that right as effective as the
[41:45] missionary journey was the missionary
[41:47] journey could only impact several
[41:49] thousand people amen but how much impact
[41:52] has those letters that he wrote the
[41:55] Epistles of Paul the new Testament the
[41:57] main bulk and body of the New Testament
[42:00] how much impact does that have so much
[42:02] impact that at the end time a a prophet
[42:05] in our day would have to come back and
[42:06] say I preached what Paul preached how
[42:08] did he know what Paul preached because
[42:10] of the letters that Paul wrote
[42:14] yeah now I want to ask you where did he
[42:16] write the
[42:19] letters he wrote a whole pile of them in
[42:23] prison amen a vessel of Honor in a
[42:27] dishonorable Place yeah in a
[42:29] dishonorable condition Dishonored by the
[42:32] world but he was never Dishonored by God
[42:34] Amen it doesn't matter what we see amen
[42:37] what God sees is the only thing that
[42:38] matters and it doesn't matter the
[42:40] outside condition amen that's not what
[42:42] makes it honorable or a vessel unto
[42:44] honor what makes it a vessel unto honor
[42:47] is what's on the
[42:49] inside and that God can use it it's for
[42:52] the Master's
[42:54] use let's go to Acts chapter 7
[43:05] Acts chapter
[43:15] 7 uh verse
[43:18] 34 this is uh Saul pre or um not Saul
[43:22] this is uh who is this step stepen
[43:27] before he stoned preaching after he's on
[43:30] trial and he's referring to Moses here
[43:33] and he says I have seen I have seen the
[43:35] Affliction of my people which is in
[43:37] Egypt and I've have heard their groaning
[43:39] and have come down to deliver them and
[43:41] now come I will send thee into
[43:44] Egypt God was coming down but how was
[43:46] God coming down he was coming down in
[43:49] that
[43:50] Prophet with that Prophet amen that's
[43:53] what made him a vessel unto honor amen
[43:58] amen I'm going to read a couple uh I'm
[44:00] going to spend a little bit of time in
[44:02] God hiding himself in Simplicity this is
[44:04] the message brother brenon preaches at
[44:06] the very beginning of the seal Series so
[44:08] he comes back in the spring of 1963 to
[44:11] preach the seals and he starts off with
[44:14] God hiding himself in Simplicity than
[44:15] revealing himself in the same amen and
[44:18] it and it's an amazing it's an amazing
[44:20] service and the more I read it the more
[44:22] I'm Amazed by it but I want to look at
[44:24] it in uh as it as it has to do with
[44:27] Moses right now says just think they
[44:29] could break Adams and do everything else
[44:31] but when it come to touching life they
[44:33] can't even tell where it comes from a
[44:36] simple blade of grass and God's hid in
[44:38] it
[44:40] amen they can split an Adam but they
[44:43] can't explain what makes a blade of
[44:45] grass live reproduce and Thrive they
[44:49] can't explain but God's hid in it they
[44:53] stand on it they walk over it but God's
[44:54] hid in it remember he's preaching God
[44:56] hiding himself in Simplicity than
[44:59] revealing himself in the same so they
[45:01] can fire a rocket to the moon and shoot
[45:02] a radar over there or whatever more and
[45:05] yet can't explain the life in a blade of
[45:06] grass that's right it's because it can't
[45:09] be explained it's so simple they
[45:11] Overlook
[45:12] that now notice Moses now here this is
[45:16] this is what started to stand out to me
[45:19] right before he says that he's referring
[45:21] to Moses in Egypt now he says this then
[45:24] he comes right back to Moses so he wants
[45:26] us to understand something about uh
[45:28] hidden and revealed in Simplicity now
[45:31] notice Moses in the day that God was
[45:33] going to deliver the children of Israel
[45:35] according to his word what did he do he
[45:37] chose a simple
[45:39] family we have no record of them amram
[45:43] and jocked he's just a son of Levi is
[45:46] all we know and his wife just an
[45:49] ordinary probably a mud Dober as the
[45:51] world would think out there making brick
[45:53] for the enemy he was just an ordinary
[45:55] slave in Israel but God chose that
[45:58] family to bring forth the deliverer just
[46:00] an ordinary Jewish Family he never went
[46:03] and got royalty in Celebrity or
[46:05] something or even got some priest he
[46:08] took a common ordinary family see
[46:11] Simplicity notice what he done then he
[46:14] brought forth a child a simple human
[46:17] being he never he could have ordained
[46:19] the son if he wanted to deliver them he
[46:21] could have ordained the wind to deliver
[46:23] them he could have ordained an angel to
[46:24] deliver them so he starts to he's he's
[46:27] going into God hiding himself in
[46:28] Simplicity and he starts talking about
[46:31] Moses then he rocks over to man's Wisdom
[46:33] can shoot shoot a rocket I Me To the
[46:35] Moon and and shoot a radar but can't
[46:37] explain the life in a blade of grass
[46:39] they walk right over the Simplicity of
[46:41] God can never explain it CU it's so
[46:42] simple they can't explain it and then he
[46:44] goes right down to Moses moses' birth
[46:47] amen come through an ordinary family
[46:49] enslaved like everybody else was slaved
[46:52] Amen to a ordinary man and an ordinary
[46:54] woman who had an ordinary labor had an
[46:56] ordinary birth and brought forth an
[46:58] ordinary
[47:00] child but this child was a chosen vessel
[47:03] ordained before the foundation of the
[47:05] world Amen to be a deliverer so we know
[47:07] all the things that happened to him but
[47:09] from the outside you couldn't tell any
[47:11] difference yeah you couldn't tell he was
[47:15] a vessel of clay but he was a vessel of
[47:17] clay made for a
[47:19] purpose then he goes down a little bit
[47:22] further and God hiding himself in
[47:23] Simplicity and I'm going to read this
[47:25] this is a little bit lengthy so just
[47:27] stay with me and pay attention so now
[47:29] notice and he had him trained in worldly
[47:32] wisdom so God allowed that this simple
[47:36] human being would be taken to the house
[47:38] of pharaoh and be made the son of the
[47:41] daughter of pharaoh and he said and God
[47:44] and he had him trained in worldly wisdom
[47:47] so that he could fail and show that it
[47:49] isn't wisdom that will ever be delivered
[47:52] by God allowed him to be trained just so
[47:55] he could fail
[47:59] yes hey I just want to say some
[48:04] things has your education ever failed
[48:06] you has your religious training ever
[48:09] failed you did God let you get
[48:12] trained why so it could
[48:15] fail that's right praise God
[48:18] amen amen he said
[48:22] now he said it isn't wisdom that will
[48:24] ever be delivered by it's by faith that
[48:26] we are deler he let him go in and get
[48:28] such an education until he could teach
[48:30] the Egyptians wisdom he was so smart God
[48:33] was with that simple family who could
[48:35] perhaps maybe not write their name and
[48:38] Moses was tooken the highest of
[48:40] schooling and with such a great
[48:41] education till he could teach the wisdom
[48:43] to teachers he could teach the genius
[48:46] yes and God let him get that way so he
[48:48] could display himself in humility to
[48:50] show that wisdom has nothing to do with
[48:53] it amen and Moses miserably failed in
[48:56] his genius
[48:58] hey guess who else miserably failed in
[48:59] their genius Paul hey Saul he miserably
[49:01] failed in his genius he was persecuting
[49:04] the very thing he was trying to defend
[49:06] he was fighting the wrong thing in his
[49:08] genius he perfectly failed in Moses's
[49:11] genius he perfectly failed and my genius
[49:13] I have perfectly failed amen praise
[49:18] God yes and God let him get that way God
[49:22] let him get that way so he could display
[49:24] himself in humility to show that wisdom
[49:26] has has nothing to do with him and Moses
[49:29] miserably failed in his genius he let
[49:31] him get that way for his purpose so he'd
[49:33] fail and he did fail and he
[49:36] fell so to show not by power not by
[49:39] might but not by the wisdom of Egypt not
[49:42] by the wisdom of our schools not by the
[49:44] power of our seminaries not by the
[49:46] amounts of our organization not by the
[49:48] power of our scholarly teaching but by
[49:50] my spirit saith God yes wisdom has
[49:53] vanished and and at its end when he met
[49:56] God in the burning bush here he took off
[49:58] his shoes and humbled himself to
[49:59] humility and forgot all about his wisdom
[50:02] God bringing Deliverance had to train
[50:04] him in wisdom to let him fall to show
[50:07] that you cannot lean upon the arm of
[50:09] your understanding or anybody else's
[50:12] understanding amen let him fall to show
[50:15] his hand can you see it God's purpose in
[50:17] doing so was to display himself in
[50:20] humility and he let Moses become the
[50:22] highest until he was he'd be the next
[50:25] Pharaoh he was a General according to
[50:28] history he conquered Moses himself the
[50:30] countries around and when he turned to
[50:32] the work of the Lord with all of his
[50:34] talent God let him take a headlong
[50:36] topple so that he could put him out
[50:39] there on the desert and beat all that
[50:41] out of him and then appear to him in
[50:43] humility and send him down with a stick
[50:46] in his hand to deliver the
[50:48] people when he couldn't do it by
[50:50] military training by an education by a
[50:52] scientific education and by a military
[50:55] force he could not do it and he gave him
[50:57] an old Crooked Stick off the desert and
[50:59] he did it with it God in humility
[51:03] Simplicity God was in the stick and in
[51:04] Moses and as long as Moses had the stick
[51:07] then God had it because God was in
[51:09] Moses what a statement yeah as long as
[51:13] amen as long as Moses had the stick then
[51:16] God had it CU God was in
[51:19] Moses notice what was he he was a vessel
[51:22] un
[51:24] honor notice not by power nor by I might
[51:26] but by my spirit but by the simple Faith
[51:30] Moses had an understanding that he was
[51:32] to be the deliverer from the teaching of
[51:34] his mother and he trained himself in
[51:37] military might to do so but it failed he
[51:40] had the understanding he had the
[51:42] education but that didn't work so he had
[51:44] to forget it all and to come to the
[51:46] simple thing of taking God at his word
[51:48] and then he delivered the people yes sir
[51:52] amen this is a man who was taught by his
[51:56] mother you're the deliverer you were
[51:59] born a proper child there was a sign at
[52:01] your birth we know that you come at the
[52:03] right season we know you're special we
[52:05] saved you for that amen now uh uh look
[52:08] God has preserved your life and now
[52:10] you're you're you're in Pharaoh's house
[52:12] and his mother amen told him all of
[52:15] these things and and and Moses went
[52:18] about brother B tells us he learned all
[52:20] the military good he could all the
[52:22] wisdom why no doubt in his mind was this
[52:25] teaching from his mother that you're the
[52:27] special child you're born under a sign
[52:29] you're the deliverer and God let him get
[52:31] so full of that stuff amen so God could
[52:34] prove that none of that will work it'll
[52:36] absolutely
[52:38] fail and it did fail he went and killed
[52:42] one Egyptian was rejected by his
[52:44] Brethren went running into the
[52:45] Wilderness and and it failed so
[52:48] miserably until Moses walks around in
[52:50] the wilderness for 40 years and forgets
[52:53] about education and Science and Military
[52:56] until he becomes weak until he becomes
[52:58] nothing until his beard grows down till
[53:00] his age comes on till he's married with
[53:03] a couple children forgot about it all
[53:05] until God comes back to him now in the
[53:07] burning bush to send him right back
[53:09] because he's still a chosen
[53:11] vessel he's still a chosen vessel unto
[53:15] honor for the glory of God nothing's
[53:17] changed God's right on time God has
[53:19] Moses just where he wants him he let him
[53:21] spend the first 40 years gaining
[53:23] everything he can gain to prove that
[53:25] nothing man can do is going to
[53:27] accomplish God's purpose in your life
[53:29] it's going to take a washing out of that
[53:31] and coming to a weakness and a humility
[53:33] and an inability to an utter Simplicity
[53:36] and in the utter Simplicity Moses goes
[53:39] down there without military without
[53:41] might without money without politics
[53:43] without anything he goes down there with
[53:45] nothing but faith in the Commandment of
[53:47] God and he conquers Egypt and delivers
[53:51] Israel with
[53:53] nothing but
[53:55] simplicity humility
[54:01] weakness praise be to
[54:03] God brother brenaman preaching uh God
[54:06] hiding himself in Simplicity he's now
[54:09] coming to the preaching of the seals but
[54:11] he says I've got to preach this first
[54:13] then when he gets to the seventh seal he
[54:15] refers back to the the first service he
[54:17] preached God hiding he says remember
[54:20] remember God hiding himself in
[54:21] Simplicity why because now brother
[54:23] brandham is coming amen he's coming to
[54:26] the most Sublime scripture in all the
[54:28] Bible Revelation CH 5 when the lamb
[54:30] takes the book and then breaks the seals
[54:32] and he's coming to the breaking of the
[54:34] seals he's coming to the sounding of the
[54:36] seven Thunders that have been sealed up
[54:39] until the time of the end and it's going
[54:40] to take place right there where is it
[54:42] going to take place on the corner of two
[54:45] ordinary streets in an ordinary town in
[54:48] a small City and mid in the midwest
[54:52] USA in nowhere with nobody in a no no
[54:56] name Place amen it's called brandom
[54:58] Tabernacle if you've ever been by it
[55:00] it's a simple box of a square building
[55:03] no cathedral ceilings no high arching
[55:05] spikes no decorative ornamentation just
[55:08] a brick Square on the corner of two side
[55:12] streets and a little city amen a little
[55:15] no-name place in Midwest USA God hiding
[55:18] himself in Simplicity what was taking
[55:20] place there the greatest thing that had
[55:22] happened one of the greatest things that
[55:24] ever happened was taking place in that
[55:26] brick building on the corner of Athan
[55:28] pin God hiding himself in
[55:32] Simplicity chosen a chosen
[55:35] Tabernacle but it didn't look like
[55:38] it and who was the vessel he was going
[55:40] to use Amen to preach the seals the
[55:43] sound of Thunders it was going to be a
[55:45] man with a seventh grade education with
[55:47] no no educ no theological education a
[55:51] man who couldn't pronounce all those
[55:52] words a man who started in the ministry
[55:54] would ask his girlfriend friend to read
[55:57] the
[56:01] scriptures how would you like it if your
[56:03] pastor had to have his girlfriend read
[56:04] the scriptures before he started the
[56:06] service cuz he couldn't pronounce those
[56:08] big
[56:11] words some of you wouldn't go to church
[56:20] there amen was rejected by had no class
[56:25] had no form had no order had no elegant
[56:28] speech had no backing of denomination
[56:31] had no formal education he was simple
[56:34] humble amen a vessel of
[56:38] clay but to me he was a vessel unto
[56:41] honor amen not because of his stature
[56:44] not because of his eloquence not because
[56:46] of his education not because of his
[56:48] power because of who was in him amen and
[56:50] what he was doing he was a vessel under
[56:53] honor and he didn't do it by education
[56:55] he didn't didn't do it by politics he
[56:57] didn't do it by his great ability to put
[56:59] scripture with scripture he didn't have
[57:01] that ability it was the Holy Ghost who
[57:04] put scripture with scripture and all he
[57:06] did was come out and say what was told
[57:08] him the Simplicity of just taking God at
[57:11] his word amen believing what he said and
[57:14] coming forth the same as Moses Moses
[57:16] didn't come with anything other than his
[57:18] faith in the word of
[57:21] God that's what Paul eventually moved
[57:24] out with Paul had no support he had no
[57:26] backing he would have one Church give
[57:28] him an offering to help him go to
[57:29] another church at the end of his
[57:30] ministry he didn't have anybody hardly
[57:32] backing him at all they had all forsaken
[57:34] him and he's asking for somebody to
[57:36] bring his coat Deus has left me all has
[57:38] forsaken me only only Luke remains amen
[57:41] he's in this position why amen because
[57:44] God's not going to do it with might and
[57:46] power and strength and Glory he's going
[57:48] to do it through humility and simplicity
[57:51] because this was a chosen
[57:54] vessel unto honor
[58:00] but it didn't look like
[58:02] it God hiding himself in Simplicity
[58:06] amen
[58:08] until brother Venom
[58:10] preaches those consecutive days eight
[58:13] days takes 10 sermons comes to the last
[58:17] day in the seventh opening of the
[58:19] seventh
[58:20] seal he says oh friends if you only knew
[58:23] he says remember back God hiding himself
[58:25] in Simplicity remember what I said at
[58:27] the beginning about Simplicity you would
[58:29] think something like that would happen
[58:30] in the
[58:33] Vatican not in this little building not
[58:36] in this little place in Jeffersonville
[58:40] Indiana you think you think this great
[58:44] momentous this great huge thing that God
[58:47] was going to do and I ask you was it
[58:49] huge it was huge was it momentous
[58:51] absolutely was it powerful it was the
[58:53] thing that was waking up the bride it
[58:56] was the thing that was bringing her
[58:57] rapturing grace amen for Faith to change
[59:00] her body amen it was momentous it was
[59:02] powerful it was power packed and it was
[59:05] so
[59:07] humble there wasn't a prayer line amen
[59:10] there wasn't there wasn't anything that
[59:11] people would know how momentous this was
[59:14] taking place it was a man coming to the
[59:16] pull pit every day saying the an angel
[59:18] came to me and gave me this and I search
[59:20] it through the scriptures and this is
[59:21] the interpretation this lines with this
[59:23] lines with this lines with this amen and
[59:25] he was so busy with this he wasn't
[59:27] visiting people he wasn't he wasn't
[59:29] dedicating babies he wasn't praying for
[59:31] the sick what he was doing is he was
[59:33] going into a little room he was meeting
[59:35] an angel angel was giving him an
[59:37] interpretation amen he would go search
[59:39] of the scriptures he'd come out and tell
[59:41] him everything he said and everything he
[59:42] found and he'd go back into the room
[59:45] amen there was nothing of the
[59:47] person that was attracting the people it
[59:50] was the revelation of the word
[59:53] amen it was powerful yes yes but you
[59:58] couldn't
[59:59] tell God just by your senses you
[1:00:02] couldn't tell just by your eyes you
[1:00:05] couldn't tell how momentous it was we
[1:00:08] look
[1:00:09] back and we can
[1:00:12] tell no doubt there was an anticipation
[1:00:15] no doubt there was an energy no doubt
[1:00:16] there was an enthusiasm you can hear the
[1:00:17] people shouting and rejoicing at the
[1:00:19] breaking of the word but how many there
[1:00:22] that day knew how powerful it was knew
[1:00:26] how momentous it was knew how
[1:00:28] revolutionary
[1:00:29] lifechanging this
[1:00:32] was amen God hiding himself in
[1:00:36] Simplicity using a chosen vessel into
[1:00:39] honor but
[1:00:41] nobody nobody with natural eyes and
[1:00:43] natural ability can tell what God's
[1:00:47] doing let's go to
[1:00:50] John chapter 15
[1:01:08] John chapter
[1:01:12] 15 in verse
[1:01:16] 16 he says you have not chosen me but I
[1:01:19] have chosen you amen what are they
[1:01:23] chosen vessels
[1:01:24] amen unto
[1:01:26] honor you have not chosen me but I have
[1:01:29] chosen you and ordained you that you
[1:01:30] should go and bring forth fruit and that
[1:01:33] your fruit should remain that whatsoever
[1:01:35] you shall ask of the father in my name
[1:01:37] he may give it you the disciples didn't
[1:01:40] choose themselves
[1:01:42] right God chose
[1:01:44] them I think it's worth note what God
[1:01:47] chose amen when God was going to chose
[1:01:50] the men that were going to represent him
[1:01:51] after his death burial and resurrection
[1:01:53] and they were going to be the ones amen
[1:01:55] who would be his Apostles that would
[1:01:57] spread amen the message of this new
[1:01:59] message this message of Salvation and
[1:02:01] life around the world who did he
[1:02:04] choose fishermen Tax
[1:02:10] Collectors he didn't choose what we
[1:02:12] would have chose
[1:02:15] intellectually brother Brenham said
[1:02:17] Peter Couldn't Write his
[1:02:20] name they were ignorant and unlearned
[1:02:27] that's the what the Pharisees said of
[1:02:28] them of John and uh uh Peter they're
[1:02:31] ignorant and they're unlearned but
[1:02:33] that's a chosen vessel unto
[1:02:37] honor not because of what it looked like
[1:02:39] but because of what was inside what God
[1:02:42] had purposed its used to be for that's
[1:02:45] what made it a vessel into
[1:02:47] honor you know and as God chose these
[1:02:50] disciples they were I I think we could
[1:02:52] safely say they were nobodies they
[1:02:55] weren't the the elites they weren't the
[1:02:56] educated they weren't the wealthy they
[1:02:58] weren't any of that but God handpicked
[1:03:01] these men these were the men that he
[1:03:02] wanted to represent him to be the light
[1:03:05] of the world to to to to carry forth the
[1:03:07] gospel of
[1:03:09] Salvation and he chose them and they
[1:03:12] become part of the ministry and as they
[1:03:14] become part of the ministry now they
[1:03:16] begin to uh uh be in the midst of what
[1:03:19] was going on and there was crowds and
[1:03:20] there was healings and they even had
[1:03:22] healings themselves they would pray for
[1:03:24] the sick they were healed they saw mirac
[1:03:25] Ires amen they performed Miracles they
[1:03:28] were there in the preaching they were
[1:03:29] sent out two by two to go around the
[1:03:31] Villages and the cities amen preparing
[1:03:33] the way for the Lord and it was amazing
[1:03:35] it was so amazing till it got to the
[1:03:37] point where they begin to argue with
[1:03:39] themselves who was the greatest
[1:03:44] amen who is the greatest among them and
[1:03:47] then it got so bad that their mama got
[1:03:50] involved and wanted to know if she could
[1:03:52] secure a place for her boys in the
[1:03:54] Kingdom
[1:03:56] listen sometimes mamas need to just
[1:03:59] quit we love you Mom but we don't need
[1:04:02] your
[1:04:04] help so much so that that they went from
[1:04:09] nothing to when God started using them
[1:04:11] in the ministry and things started
[1:04:13] happening they got so elevated that they
[1:04:15] started getting political and they
[1:04:17] started vying for position and they want
[1:04:18] to know who was the greatest among them
[1:04:20] and who would be greatest in the kingdom
[1:04:22] and they begin to miss everything here
[1:04:25] here they are next to God in flesh God
[1:04:27] had come in such a humble way born amen
[1:04:30] through a nobody amen born through Mary
[1:04:33] who was who is nobody special no nobody
[1:04:36] of Elegance nobody of stature nobody of
[1:04:38] great wealth no royalty he just came
[1:04:40] humbly and a humble way and a humble
[1:04:43] Place lived in
[1:04:46] obscurity he comes forth and he has
[1:04:48] nothing he doesn't have houses he
[1:04:50] doesn't have armies he doesn't have
[1:04:52] politics he has nothing and they miss
[1:04:54] the humility they saw the power they
[1:04:57] missed this chosen vessel unto honor
[1:04:59] they missed what God was doing and they
[1:05:01] they got all wrapped up in the power and
[1:05:03] the might and the glory and the Grandeur
[1:05:05] until they wanted to secure their
[1:05:07] position in
[1:05:11] it and Peter was one of the
[1:05:15] worst until God let Peter
[1:05:19] fail let him utterly fail so Peter would
[1:05:23] realize what he is without God
[1:05:26] one all his arguments and his efforts
[1:05:28] and his strength and his his bold
[1:05:31] determination to serve God and His
[1:05:33] willingness to fight for what he
[1:05:34] believed in and even fighting to try to
[1:05:36] kill a man to save Jesus that was all
[1:05:40] carnal carnal carnal it wasn't a bit
[1:05:43] spiritual yeah all their fussing was
[1:05:45] carnal amen it wasn't a bit spiritual
[1:05:48] they were in the midst of a spiritual
[1:05:49] move and they were acting carnal yeah
[1:05:51] right Peter was pet Jesus was speaking
[1:05:55] spiritually amen prophecy saying the son
[1:05:58] of man must go into Jerusalem be evily
[1:06:00] treated amen be slain and lay in three
[1:06:02] days and resurrect and and and Peter
[1:06:05] amen heard spiritual words amen but
[1:06:08] because he was Cardinal he says far be
[1:06:11] it from you for the thing like this to
[1:06:12] happen to you and Jesus says get thee
[1:06:14] behind me Satan he was stuck in
[1:06:16] carnality he was stuck in the ways of
[1:06:18] the world he missed what true honor and
[1:06:21] true true honor really is amen till he
[1:06:25] fell flat on his
[1:06:27] face amen that was the grace of God Amen
[1:06:30] yeah now when he comes up now after
[1:06:34] after the resurrection and after
[1:06:36] Pentecost you don't see the disciples
[1:06:38] anymore jocking for
[1:06:40] position you don't see them anymore
[1:06:42] fighting for who's the greatest and who
[1:06:44] has the greatest Revelation who's going
[1:06:46] to be on the right hand and who's going
[1:06:47] to be on the left hand amen then they're
[1:06:49] willing to be crucified upside down
[1:06:51] they're willing to be rejected they're
[1:06:53] willing to be imprison they're willing
[1:06:54] everything they weren't willing before
[1:06:56] they're willing to have now why because
[1:06:58] they met the pillar of fire they met the
[1:07:00] thing that was already in them came to
[1:07:02] life and they were vessels chosen unto
[1:07:04] this to honor they were acting
[1:07:06] dishonorably but they were still CH
[1:07:08] vessels chosen unto honor but they had
[1:07:11] to come in contact with the Living God
[1:07:14] would Quicken that seed inside of them
[1:07:16] and then their carnality began to fade
[1:07:18] away and they still struggle with it we
[1:07:20] find Peter struggling with it in
[1:07:23] Antioch but he's able to get over that
[1:07:26] thing to the point that that Peter was
[1:07:30] rebuked by Paul y remember who came
[1:07:33] first Peter or
[1:07:37] Paul Peter was there from the beginning
[1:07:40] he was one of the first disciples chosen
[1:07:42] he was there in all the ministry he was
[1:07:44] he was even there during the trial there
[1:07:46] was only two of them that we know of
[1:07:47] that was there John and Peter amen he
[1:07:50] was one of the first to see the tomb he
[1:07:51] was one of the first he got a special
[1:07:53] meeting amen where God came Christ came
[1:07:55] to him in a special meeting yeah amen he
[1:07:58] had all of these things and Paul is
[1:08:01] Johnny come
[1:08:03] lately but Paul withstands him to his
[1:08:05] face and rebukes him because he was
[1:08:07] wrong based on the word you know what
[1:08:09] Peter does Peter subjects himself to the
[1:08:11] word and how do we know because later in
[1:08:14] his ministry when he's writing in the
[1:08:15] book of Peter it's either first or
[1:08:17] second Peter he starts to talk about the
[1:08:19] things that Paul says he said some of
[1:08:21] which are hard to be understood amen
[1:08:24] which men rest with wrestle with as they
[1:08:27] do the other scriptures so now Peter
[1:08:30] says Paul is speaking scriptures
[1:08:35] amen amen he gives honor unto that
[1:08:38] vessel that's God's using in the
[1:08:39] position he's in he's not trying to put
[1:08:42] Paul underneath of him and dominate and
[1:08:44] I was here first and you know you got to
[1:08:46] be careful about what Paul says if you
[1:08:47] really want it you got to come to the
[1:08:50] original
[1:08:52] right amen they met a pillar of fire
[1:08:55] something changed inside of them they
[1:08:56] were vessels un unto honor and some of
[1:08:59] that carnality began to fade away said
[1:09:03] oh God let carnality fade out of our
[1:09:05] minds this whole idea of who's better
[1:09:08] and who's best and who knows more and
[1:09:10] who know let's get rid of it friends and
[1:09:12] come back to humility and say all I know
[1:09:15] is what he said amen all I know is to
[1:09:17] move forward in the word amen I don't
[1:09:20] know anything
[1:09:22] else right let the carnality
[1:09:27] disappear brother B says well no I want
[1:09:30] to turn to Deuteronomy first and then
[1:09:32] we'll go to this next
[1:09:33] quote
[1:09:36] Deuteronomy
[1:09:42] I I'm
[1:09:44] hustling I just looked at the clock I
[1:09:46] shouldn't have done that bad
[1:09:52] news all right Deuteronomy 7 Deuteronomy
[1:09:57] 7 verse
[1:10:00] 6 de Deuteronomy 7 ver six for thou art
[1:10:04] a holy people unto the Lord thy God the
[1:10:07] Lord thy God ha chosen thee to be a
[1:10:09] special people unto himself above all
[1:10:11] the people that are upon the face of the
[1:10:13] Earth the Lord did not set his love upon
[1:10:16] you nor choose you because you were more
[1:10:18] in number than any people for you were
[1:10:20] the fewest of all people but because the
[1:10:22] Lord loved you and because he would keep
[1:10:24] the oath which he had sworn unto your
[1:10:26] fathers ha the Lord brought you out with
[1:10:28] a mighty hand and redeemed you out of
[1:10:31] the house of of bondman from the hand of
[1:10:34] pharaoh king of
[1:10:35] Egypt anden Moses is reminding them what
[1:10:39] he's reminding them of is you're nothing
[1:10:44] special what a good reminder you're
[1:10:47] nothing special God didn't choose you
[1:10:50] because you were special right he chose
[1:10:52] you to be a special people he chose you
[1:10:55] to be his people a holy nation a
[1:10:58] separated unto himself he did choose you
[1:11:01] for that but he didn't choose you based
[1:11:02] off your
[1:11:04] Merit he chose you based off his love
[1:11:07] his election his choice and his promise
[1:11:10] in his word right that's why he chose
[1:11:12] them because of the promise he gave to
[1:11:14] Abraham but it wasn't based on their
[1:11:16] Merit and it would do us a world of good
[1:11:18] to be reminding that God has chosen us
[1:11:21] amen he's called us to be a special
[1:11:23] people A peculiar people a chosen Nation
[1:11:26] amen a nation of Kings and Priests but
[1:11:28] he didn't do it because of us he did it
[1:11:30] because of him not this flesh amen we
[1:11:33] got to get that notion completely out of
[1:11:35] my mind this thing is just clay what
[1:11:38] makes it a vessel unto honor is not
[1:11:40] anything that has to do with this clay
[1:11:42] it's what's on the
[1:11:44] inside and the purpose the Potter
[1:11:46] fashioned it
[1:11:48] for he says in three kinds of Believers
[1:11:50] is and nobody can take your
[1:11:52] place no matter how little you say I'm
[1:11:55] just just a housewife nobody can take
[1:11:57] your place God in his great economy has
[1:12:00] so has so set so the body of Christ in
[1:12:04] order till there is no one can take your
[1:12:06] place how I would like to take Billy
[1:12:09] Graham's place any of us ministers but
[1:12:10] we can't do it but just remember Billy
[1:12:13] can't take your place see we all have a
[1:12:15] place some of us are evangelists some
[1:12:17] prophets some teachers some pastors
[1:12:19] whatever we are some Housewives some
[1:12:21] mechanics some Farmers Whatever It Is
[1:12:24] God has set you you in your place
[1:12:28] am I want to go back to the quote that I
[1:12:32] began
[1:12:33] with that when you would when you would
[1:12:36] recognize your position or place you'll
[1:12:38] save yourself and God a lot of trouble
[1:12:40] right somebody's place is a mechanic
[1:12:44] yeah praise God that's right a housewife
[1:12:47] a farmer an
[1:12:52] evangelist when we hear things we start
[1:12:54] to think
[1:12:55] wrong
[1:12:57] thoughts when we start thinking about
[1:12:59] your position in Christ we start
[1:13:01] thinking you're the bride of Christ we
[1:13:03] we immediately when you when you when
[1:13:05] you get into position it's hard for us
[1:13:08] not to think when we when we think about
[1:13:11] getting in position let me just say if I
[1:13:13] could say it this way when we say about
[1:13:14] when you get in your position in the
[1:13:16] body somehow we only think about what
[1:13:18] takes place in the church
[1:13:21] service what's on the platform Are the
[1:13:23] officers of the church are what we do
[1:13:25] collectively as a body but that is not
[1:13:28] what he's talking about am it can
[1:13:31] include that but that's not it God has
[1:13:33] placed you in your position right if not
[1:13:38] there's only about 10% of us that's in
[1:13:40] position and the rest of us are still
[1:13:41] waiting to get in
[1:13:43] position that's not true in any way
[1:13:46] shape or form that's a wrong conception
[1:13:48] that's the way the disciples were
[1:13:50] thinking before the resurrection before
[1:13:53] Pentecost they were thinking that way of
[1:13:55] positions yeah that's right but that's
[1:13:58] carnal that's not spiritual that's
[1:14:00] natural thinking that's not spiritual
[1:14:02] thinking
[1:14:04] amen
[1:14:07] amen amen let's go to 1 Corinthians 7
[1:14:11] we're flipping back and forth a lot but
[1:14:13] it's good amen 1 Corinthians
[1:14:22] 7 1 Corinthians 7: vers
[1:14:31] 20 First Corinthians 7:20 let every man
[1:14:34] abide in the same calling wherein he was
[1:14:37] called Art Thou called being a servant
[1:14:40] care not for it but if thou mayest be
[1:14:42] free use it rather for he that is called
[1:14:44] in the Lord being a servant is the
[1:14:46] Lord's free man likewise also he that is
[1:14:48] called being free as Christ's servant ye
[1:14:50] are bought with a price uh be not ye the
[1:14:53] Servants of men brethren let every man
[1:14:55] wherein as he is called therein abide
[1:14:58] with
[1:15:00] God are you called being a servant be a
[1:15:03] servant are you called being a master
[1:15:04] being a master are you called being a
[1:15:05] police officer be a police officer amen
[1:15:09] right are you called remember when they
[1:15:11] come to Jesus the tax collector the
[1:15:12] publicans come to Jesus say what must we
[1:15:14] do and Jesus didn't say stop being a tax
[1:15:18] collector what he said is he says don't
[1:15:21] extract more than what is fair and be
[1:15:23] honest amen right soldiers said to Jesus
[1:15:26] what must we do and he didn't say stop
[1:15:28] being a soldier what he said is do no
[1:15:31] violence to no man and be content with
[1:15:32] your wages yeah
[1:15:37] amen what if the farmer saying God what
[1:15:39] must I
[1:15:40] do just be faithful and true in what I
[1:15:43] called you to do don't leave the calling
[1:15:46] wherewith I called you it's
[1:15:50] not we have a funny idea of what's
[1:15:52] spiritual and not spiritual
[1:15:55] amen what's the work of God and not the
[1:15:58] work of God yeah yeah writing a song is
[1:16:01] the work of God is going to work the
[1:16:03] work of
[1:16:04] God that's
[1:16:07] right it depends on what he's called you
[1:16:10] for it depends on what your vessel is
[1:16:12] fashioned for and what God had his mind
[1:16:14] of you before the foundation of the
[1:16:16] world right if if we all have to wait
[1:16:20] until either I write a song sing a song
[1:16:22] sing in the choir uh I'm called to an
[1:16:25] office in the church preach the gospel
[1:16:27] do something if we're all waiting for
[1:16:28] that amen and when that's when I get in
[1:16:30] my position or when I see my gift
[1:16:32] operating that now I have tongues and
[1:16:34] prophecy and and that's my position no
[1:16:36] God's called you in a certain vein he's
[1:16:39] allowed your life to work out a certain
[1:16:40] way remain in the calling where they
[1:16:42] called you and be a Christian where
[1:16:44] you're at be Christ at work be Christ at
[1:16:47] school be Christ at home amen be the
[1:16:50] manifestation of Jesus Christ in your
[1:16:53] flesh for you're a vessel chosen unto
[1:16:55] honor and it doesn't matter what the
[1:16:57] rest of the world looks at what's inside
[1:16:59] of you is
[1:17:02] God God wants to shine a light in a dark
[1:17:05] place what dark place the one you work
[1:17:07] at amen God wants to be God working
[1:17:11] through a mother's office to bring up
[1:17:12] children in the nurture and ammunition
[1:17:14] of the Lord that's what God called some
[1:17:17] people to God called some people to be
[1:17:20] fathers some people for all kinds of
[1:17:22] occupations to do all kinds of things
[1:17:24] remember you're God's representation and
[1:17:27] wherever it is that you go every day
[1:17:29] you're taking God to that place You're A
[1:17:31] Link Between Heaven and Earth you are
[1:17:34] amen and don't don't go to that place
[1:17:36] you've met the pillar of fire you've
[1:17:38] come in contact your vess vessels
[1:17:40] holding the Living God the word made
[1:17:42] manifest for your day don't you dare get
[1:17:45] up in the morning put your boots on go
[1:17:47] to work thinking I wish I knew what my
[1:17:49] purpose was I wish I knew I wish God
[1:17:51] would give me a work to do in his
[1:17:52] kingdom you're called to go there there
[1:17:55] and be
[1:17:57] Christ and if we don't catch it we miss
[1:18:00] all the things that God's wanting to do
[1:18:03] every day in every place he puts
[1:18:06] us we start thinking carnal thoughts
[1:18:10] yeah this gift is better than that
[1:18:14] gift that position can really do
[1:18:16] something for God but this position is
[1:18:22] less if we think that way
[1:18:25] carnal amen that's carnal thinking amen
[1:18:29] that's right because what's spiritual is
[1:18:31] to be what God called you to be that's
[1:18:33] spiritual the highest thing you can
[1:18:36] achieve in the kingdom of God is to do
[1:18:38] exactly what he called you to
[1:18:42] do I want to ask you what's what's the
[1:18:45] greater position than being bride of
[1:18:48] Jesus
[1:18:51] Christ bride of Jesus Christ plus a
[1:18:53] title in the church no friends it
[1:18:56] doesn't work that way there's nothing
[1:18:59] better than being a son or daughter of
[1:19:00] God nothing nothing nothing you can't
[1:19:03] get any higher than bride of Jesus
[1:19:06] Christ praise be to God Amen we need to
[1:19:09] stop thinking carnal because when we
[1:19:11] think carnal we don't live
[1:19:12] spiritually we start living carnal going
[1:19:16] to work coming home wishing we had
[1:19:18] something to do for the kingdom of God
[1:19:19] going to work coming home wishing we had
[1:19:21] something making food for the kiddies
[1:19:23] taking care of husband been taking care
[1:19:25] of wife taking care of Home wishing we
[1:19:26] had something to do for the kingdom of
[1:19:29] God oh friends we got to wake
[1:19:33] up we got to wake up Christ in flesh a
[1:19:39] many membered
[1:19:44] body brother B said in voice of the sign
[1:19:46] he says Moses no one else could take his
[1:19:48] place no one else could do the job he
[1:19:50] was ordained to it and brother sister if
[1:19:53] you got eternal life you were dained to
[1:19:55] do a certain thing maybe a good
[1:19:57] housewife is that what the prophet said
[1:19:59] if you got eternal life you ordained to
[1:20:02] do a certain thing maybe a good
[1:20:04] housewife no it's got to be I I want to
[1:20:07] write a song that moves people to te and
[1:20:09] when they cry and they give their heart
[1:20:10] to the Lord that's the work of the Lord
[1:20:13] that is the work of the Lord but that's
[1:20:14] the work of the Lord for somebody else
[1:20:15] to do right and that work is not better
[1:20:19] than a good housewife am that's carnal
[1:20:23] thinking right we got got to break away
[1:20:25] from carnal thinking and be what God's
[1:20:27] called us to be and start having faith
[1:20:30] in who we are and the position he's put
[1:20:33] us
[1:20:34] in if you got eternal life you were
[1:20:37] ordained to do a certain thing maybe a
[1:20:38] good housewife maybe something else but

[1:21:21] crow putting peacock feathers in
[1:21:22] yourself that's right

[1:22:24] him to be the prophet for the age he
[1:22:26] didn't apply for the job he wasn't
[1:22:28] working up the chain he wasn't taking
[1:22:30] this job and then I'll come from past I

[1:22:41] have never missed it brother Ram didn't
[1:22:43] come to God God came to him Moses didn't
[1:22:46] come to God God came to him the
[1:22:48] disciples didn't come to God God came to
[1:22:50] the disciples you're not going to go
[1:22:52] find yourself a position God is going to
[1:22:54] put where he ordained you to be from
[1:22:56] before the foundation of the
[1:22:58] world you don't have to use politics and
[1:23:01] maneuvering and talk to people and sew a
[1:23:04] seed in people's minds don't you think I
[1:23:06] would be good at this position and don't
[1:23:08] just leave it alone and keep doing what
[1:23:10] God's called you to do and when God
[1:23:12] wants you to do something he'll drop it

[1:24:17] a Son of God you were in God before the
[1:24:18] foundation of the world you're only
[1:24:20] manifest in this day for his honor and
[1:24:22] Glory how can you do it without honoring
[1:24:25] his word and stand with every word of
[1:24:27] God yes sir which you are a part of that
[1:24:29] word by
[1:24:31] predestination because look God is the
[1:24:34] word you believe it well then he always
[1:24:37] was the word in the beginning was the
[1:24:39] word and if the Word was God then you
[1:24:41] were in God Amen the word the part that
[1:24:44] you're to play was in God before the
[1:24:46] foundation of the world he seen you he
[1:24:49] knew you he predestinated you to it
[1:24:55] God you don't have to apply for
[1:24:57] it you don't have to make a
[1:25:00] resume you don't have to go stand in the
[1:25:02] job
[1:25:03] line all you have to do is live your
[1:25:06] whole heart for
[1:25:09] Christ God's gifts find their
[1:25:16] place
[1:25:18] amen I'm
[1:25:20] overtime but I got two more things I
[1:25:22] want to read
[1:25:26] I'm just going to quote to you the
[1:25:27] scripture in 2 Corinthians 4:5 he says
[1:25:29] for we preach not ourselves but Christ
[1:25:31] Jesus the Lord and ourselves your
[1:25:33] servants for jesus' sake for God who
[1:25:35] commanded the light to shine out of
[1:25:36] Darkness has shine in our hearts to give
[1:25:38] the light of the knowledge of the glory
[1:25:40] of God in the face of Jesus Christ but
[1:25:44] we have this treasure in Earth and
[1:25:46] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[1:25:48] may be of God and not of
[1:25:51] us we have this treasure what treasure
[1:25:54] the knowledge of God in the face of
[1:25:56] Jesus
[1:25:59] Christ brother B said in things that are
[1:26:01] to be said now the only way that you can
[1:26:03] be a son or daughter of God because you
[1:26:06] have to have eternal life and there's
[1:26:07] only one form of eternal life and that's
[1:26:09] God's life only one form of eternal life
[1:26:11] that was God there to be a Son of God
[1:26:13] you had to be in him always the gene of
[1:26:16] your life spiritual life tonight was in
[1:26:18] God the Father before there was even a
[1:26:21] molecule and you are nothing but the
[1:26:23] manifestation of the gene of life that
[1:26:25] was in God as a Son of God am he said
[1:26:28] you're nothing but I I like being
[1:26:30] nothing but I don't want to be nothing
[1:26:33] but
[1:26:34] this now you're expressed after his word
[1:26:37] has come in you to light up this age you
[1:26:40] are expressing God's life in you because
[1:26:42] you are a son or daughter of God
[1:26:43] therefore you get what I mean see you
[1:26:45] are now made you're sitting in this
[1:26:47] church tonight because your duty is to
[1:26:49] express God to this nation and this
[1:26:51] people and this neighborhood where you
[1:26:55] associate that's our duty what's our
[1:26:58] duty to express God every Wednesday and
[1:27:01] Sunday when you come to
[1:27:03] church that's partially true you should
[1:27:06] Express God here
[1:27:09] too in this nation to this people this
[1:27:12] neighborhood where you
[1:27:14] associate wherever you are God knew that
[1:27:17] you would be there because you have to
[1:27:19] be one of his genes or his attributes
[1:27:21] you had to be if you ever if you got
[1:27:23] eternal life then always was eternal
[1:27:25] life and God before there was a
[1:27:26] foundation of the world knew that you
[1:27:28] would be
[1:27:29] here and he's not making one single
[1:27:32] mistake with where you are
[1:27:38] now
[1:27:40] amen back in the message of God hiding
[1:27:43] himself in Simplicity he said remember
[1:27:45] friends don't look for great big you say
[1:27:49] God he speaks of great big things
[1:27:51] there'll come a time there'll be this or
[1:27:52] that or the other great big things I
[1:27:55] hope you're catching what I'm talking
[1:27:56] about great big things and oh when this
[1:27:59] comes to pass it'll be great big like
[1:28:01] this it it'll be so humble you'll miss
[1:28:04] the whole thing and just go right on see
[1:28:07] you'll look back and say well that never
[1:28:09] did come to see passed right over the
[1:28:11] top and you never seen it it's so simple
[1:28:14] God lives in Simplicity to manifest
[1:28:16] himself in
[1:28:18] greatness
[1:28:20] amen one of these days God's going to
[1:28:22] move us to do something
[1:28:27] it's happening
[1:28:29] now he's living in a many membered bride
[1:28:32] now he's on the earth manifesting
[1:28:34] himself
[1:28:35] now anything else he can do he wants to
[1:28:38] do he can do when he gets preeminence in
[1:28:40] this body and
[1:28:42] control he can do whatever he wants
[1:28:44] remember when brother brandham spoke to
[1:28:46] squirrels that wasn't his idea he didn't
[1:28:47] go to God God came to him when it's time
[1:28:50] to speak to a storm he didn't ask God
[1:28:52] God come and told him what to say when
[1:28:54] it was time for his wife's healing he
[1:28:55] was asking God to heal but he never
[1:28:57] asked to speak the word god came to him
[1:28:59] don't look for big things you'll miss it
[1:29:01] if you're waiting and striving and
[1:29:03] trying that have signs and this big work
[1:29:05] and this big man you're going to miss
[1:29:07] the whole thing it's going to take place
[1:29:09] in the Simplicity of going squirrel
[1:29:13] hunting right where's this big powerful
[1:29:15] thing going to take place it's going to
[1:29:17] take place when you're in the woods amen

[1:29:36] day I love this quote this quote is from
[1:29:39] 1957 we'll quit with this if The
[1:29:40] Magicians want to come on it's from a
[1:29:43] message called belief from the heart
[1:29:45] said it was a few days ago just to see
[1:29:49] how God does things simple and we're so
[1:29:51] flustrated till we look for great big
[1:29:53] things be satisfied with little
[1:29:56] things watch him when he does his
[1:29:59] glorious Works how he protects you don't
[1:30:02] be looking way over the top of something
[1:30:04] look down here notice I have begin to
[1:30:07] think this that it is possible that when
[1:30:09] a man like the apostles when you can
[1:30:11] live close to God and God through his
[1:30:13] grace operates through you that the more
[1:30:15] God you get the more Godly you become
[1:30:18] the more eternal life comes in the more
[1:30:20] the intellectual is pushed out now I
[1:30:22] don't mean to be a f
[1:30:24] I mean to be a real sane sound believer
[1:30:28] not a bunch of isms but a real solid
[1:30:31] true sensible intelligent
[1:30:35] believer what's going to do that when
[1:30:37] you don't look for big things but you
