not forget because uh if you know somebody tells you and you forget that's always not so nice so uh and greetings from all from the church in uh in our church in uh the northern part of Germany West Tim where where I also come from just a short introduction um I think some of you yeah you know me as maybe your brother zilis pastor our sister The Village Pastor now and uh so but my name is Andrew uh ringan I'm uh you're born uh with my with the first birth in uh the northern part of Germany so from that a little bit uh cooler area and so but uh since I'm born again that changed amen so uh and uh we come there I'm a pastor of a church for some years and have a family uh married to one wife and uh have we having 10 children by the grace of the Lord and they're doing all well yes and I think that's all that's what we need to know uh the rest I think you will you will understand who I am in the service a amen so I'm I'm uh uh I'm just so happy and grateful to be here and having some time of Fellowship also with I I really I didn't really came here to minister uh that goes together together with it but I I was here to have fellowship with brother Jad because I think it's just a privilege to live in this hour and to meet ministers and uh preachers that this God called for for the purpose and to see where we are in that Vision together it's always amazing as I'm traveling quite a bit around the Lord has sent us to different places and it's just a move that is is there around the world Amen it's it's not just located to one place it's not here's a headquarter or there our headquarter as brother ROM would say is in heaven and Heaven is the word amen amen so that's our headquarter and we are so grateful for having fellowship and knowing one another before the we meet on the other side having really the great privilege amen God bless you amen let's take our Bibles we just want to because it's a Wednesday also and I I I have the um uh I'm I'm quite long winded many times so uh I have a reputation like that so I I trust that I don't stress your time straight from the beginning amen and so uh if somebody gets tired uh no problem if somebody falls asleep no problem with me uh I always say that in home I don't have any problem with that just don't snore too loud so that's that's that it might be a little difficult amen we greet you see some some people from God bless you from England is that right God bless you good to see you all here it's just surprising amen let's turn our Bibles and uh go to the to the Book of Psalms we want to read um one only one verse and uh and then we go to Genesis 18 amen we want to read a very familiar scripture and we trust that the Lord will really anoint his word inspire us that we are going where the Lord wants us to go because what we need something real for the hour that we are living in amen that's brother when I would say the time of church you know that that habit is just over doesn't work anymore uh amen so we need we need something to face the challenges of the hour amen and so we trust that the Lord will grant us uh a little bit more insight amen Psalm 103 I want to read only one verse verse 7 Psalm 1 103:7 amen and that will stay with us this evening for a short while Moses uh will stay a little bit with us and uh we want to see the connection between Moses and Elijah uh because we had an Elijah in our day amen and uh he brought us a message uh or through him a message came and and as as it was um the prophet would say uh in the church AG book what he brings will will literally turn the hearts of the children back amen and so we believe that amen and so it's just we want to see the connection verse 7 Psalm 03 103:7 he made known his ways unto Moses his acts unto the children of Israel amen it's a it's a uh if we had enough time we could because it's it's involved in a psalm and uh to show what God all is you know and and then verse 7 said he made known his ways unto Moses his acts unto the children of Israel amen amen and then we want to turn to uh Genesis 18 Genesis 18 we want to uh read very familiar scripture Genesis 18 we want to read the verses one and two verse1 and 2 and three very familiar we all are very familiar with that what it means and that it happened in our day uh as a type here and the Lord appeared keep that also in mind as we go uh the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day also remarkable not in the cool of the evening but In the Heat of the day and he Liv up his eyes and looked and L three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself towards the ground and he said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant amen isn't that amazing amen he sees three coming and he said my Lord amen let's pray together heavenly father it's such a wonderful privilege that we have again and what would we do Lord without you what would we do without your presence what would we do without the assurance that you lead and guide us father we would not have the courage to stand here father and but now as you have blessed us in such a great way we ask one more time open your word to us father and just unveil yourself a little bit more so that the Great I Am becomes more visible amongst us we pray father just anoint Thy word anoint thy servant anoint the hearers that are here and for we ask it all in the name of Jesus Christ to your honor and to your glory amen amen God bless you you may be seated amen so I just uh I just felt something on my heart to uh to speak on a on a little subject this evening of knowing him in his ways um knowing him in his ways and and also pointing it to the day that we are living in after the Revival has begun uh so we will we will try because we understand we are living already in a Time past the prophet left the scene many years ago um I think some of the people here maybe are from that area even know that so it's it's it's many years ago that the prophet was here and the Lord took the prophet away because his work was done amen he so now but but since then I think a lot of things have changed situations have become uh not not more easy actually more more many times more difficult more challenging but as it happens as the church is maturing so the maturing of the church is visible with the problems that uh we are facing today so God would only allow certain areas to come because the the church has reached a kind of maturity amen and and and as we Allow Me Maybe to to start something with with a statement of the Prophet from looking at the Unseen and uh we really want to want to go this evening and and rephrase a little bit we we all know that the prophet came and what the prophet has done but really what the the purpose of the Prophet really was and and and clearly to understand um uh what he was really here for what he really introduced to us and and uh and brother randam would say in the message looking at the Unseen he see after reading the scripture he he say he say he's telling the people may God bless his word and we are thinking of a day that has gone where God we thinking of a day that has passed that is gone as we are remembering a day that the prophet was here that is gone and brother Ram said do we remember thinking of a day that has gone has passed where God moved in in in a in a manner uh to reveal himself to men to make his ways known unto men through his servants His prophets amen so brother randam is is is using and he said what the prophet came for was actually to make known the ways of the Lord so that we and and and as we have read the scripture in Psalm which was which was it's easy read where it said that God was made known his ways unto Moses and and to the children of Israel his acts amen and and but I I I want to say straight from the beginning this evening it's not enough if you know him in his act it's not enough it will not meet the challenge of the hour if we just know him in his acts so God God needs to be identified he needs to be recognized so so as even Moses or Abraham as we was was uh seeing there in in in Genesis 18 as uh as Abraham was and it was a very interesting day it was actually long after after the the whole move had started uh it started actually um if I can call it the Revival or the move of God started uh in in Genesis 12 when God called Abraham he just called him and there it all started actually they had begun when God just came to Abraham and he C him Genesis 12 we don't take the time to go to to the the the the Genesis to chapter 18 what all happened in that time Genesis 12 13 14 15 16 17 a lot of things had happened a lot of things had happened to Abraham with Abraham Abraham saw God in in many different ways God spoke to him in many different he saw he saw I believe Abraham saw many manifestations of God he saw many acts of God and I want to say by that also Sarah she had the privilege on her journey to see really manifestation acts of God but all the acts of God were not able to change them amen and and that's why there had to be a visit amen and Genesis 18 they had to come a visit it was not enough what had happened to Abram even because you know remember even the time when MDC came to him and and gave him bread and one it was a time for Abraham when Abraham and how the the journey so amazingly started that God would call him and this is the way God is doing it we have to understand God and the the in the ways that he is doing things that how we have to identify him this evening amen amen do we believe that he is here this evening amen many times we just believe that because the Bible said so and that's right you understand we understand the Bible said but two or three are gathered in my name but in this hour we need to know a more clearer presence amen because the challenges of the day uh we need to know him we just need to know him we need to know that he is present because we understand when he is present all things are okay as brother randam would say preached the sermon there's a man here that can turn on the light if he turns on the light or not it's not so important but it's important that a man is here that can turn on the light and even if it stays dark if the man is there so he we have contact with that man nothing bothers so you understand how important it is that we understand that that man is here and that man surely was not William brandham that man was not William brandham Brother rham spoke of a different man he said there's a man here that can turn on the light amen but if we just know that he is here he is present that's enough amen if you're just aware of his Pres it doesn't matter what happens around us it just doesn't matter amen it just doesn't matter as as we understand as he is present and and and very interesting also as Abraham had seen had so many so many manifestations of God and all the manifestations he would tell to Sarah he would tell her you know what happened many manifestations he saw himself Sarah was not present there was a few things where Sarah was present she was present in Egypt straight I think is Genesis 13 or 14 she was there when when when whole Egypt was actually like under a curse because of her presence she was there so so she had a little insight and she knew also a God that can act a God that can that that that you you you recognize in his acts you you see oh when things happening like that you understand God is present if you see healing here tonight we understand God is present is that right amen you understand but in this hour we need we need much more of assurance of his presence amen you you need to be assure of his presence even if you don't get healed amen so and and and and really amazing as we see in gen genis 18 after all uh the things um that that that Abraham had uh lived out and and uh where he come from but all that he has seen all the manifestation all the manifestation didn't uh didn't change his body yet right also Sarah all the manifestation all that she had seen didn't change her body yet amen that's why the visit in Genesis 18 was necessary that's why a prophet had to come in this hour with all what we had before with all the manifestation what we saw and what we understood and received and experienced a prophet had to come and not only a prophet had to come because as Abraham is he a type of the Prophet is Abraham a type of the Prophet watch it Abraham starts with a Bram starts with b and I always say if you say A you must say B you you actually and we understand the same story that happened to Abraham happened to William Branham is that right we understand how his name was changed and his name was changed is that correct just to show us actually that God is doing the same to the church through that vessel as he did through from Abraham to Sarah amen and it was finally it was not Sarah actually it was not Sarah up to date Sarah was in a condition um we we come maybe a little bit later to that she was she was so influenced because the uh the time that she was living in was a terrible time they never were in Sodom also not Sarah but they lived under Sodom conditions am amen and because they lived under Sodom condition it had an effect on Sarah if you really watch her life yet and and this is the same with us we are not in lodia is it correct we are called out of lisia as Adam was not in as Abraham was not in Sodom so we are not in lisia amen yes we living under lisan conditions and these conditions affect us amen this affect us this affect the Family Life totally today the condition yet you may be not in loud this year but yet as Abraham and Sarah you are affected by the conditions amen and and and and really shortly looking what conditions they really lived in uh at that time that makes a little bit more clear why Sarah reacted the way she reacted amen amen so she was affected she needed that visitation she needed that visit ation and also that visitation of Genesis 18 after after a few moments or a few minutes or I don't know maybe half an hour as in this visitation uh so so Elohim was not talking to Abraham if you really see him coming it was actually Abraham doing the talking inviting him he never opened his mouth just as they were sitting together having Fellowship suddenly he opened his mouth and made plain the purpose of this visitation you know what he asked Abraham where is [Music] Sarah so he kept quiet all the time he just kept quiet he enjoyed what Abraham did but his whole purpose of coming was not Abraham so this whole purpose of coming in this hour was not because of William brandham this whole purpose of God coming in this hour was because of the Bride of Jesus Christ so he made it so plain isn't it amazing as they were sitting he kept silent he didn't say nothing as as he enjoyed the food that Sarah was a part of suddenly he opened his mouth and he unveiled the purpose of his coming he said where is Sarah he never said Abraham how are you he he see that was fine but this time this visit was just for her church do you understand that this visitation that William Brandon was here to declare to us who it is it was brother brandham he declared to us it was God telling him to tell us it is the same as Abraham told Sarah so Sarah was not sitting in the tentor looking at it no because of the Sodom condition that they were in come on come on church that was the days you understand that it was the hour where Sodom was burned is it right amen is absolutely so so they had Sodom conditions yet they were not in Sodom yet the Sodom condition affected them we better believe that so because in in this day you can do what you want you are not a part of ludia anymore because God called you out is it right you know we are not in lisia anymore yet this the condition of lisia is affecting us we are not in lisia but we live in lisia so the condition affects us the same way as it affected Sarah amen that's why we needed that visitation that's why we have to understand that visitation was because we would come into conditions like we are in now because be honest 60 years ago as brother random would speak of Sodom condition what about now what about now I mean we could we could go into it we don't do but we just realize it remember as it was as bad as it was in the time remember when the Angels finally came to Sodom when they finally came came and they they visited or you know they they they came to the the door of the house where lot lived lot lived not in sod but at the gate he was you know he he as the Bible would say and as they came the whole the Bible said whole Sodom came young and old all came because there was man coming so so lot was trying to quieten down the group in sending or you know satisfying the people and sending his girls out and what did they say we don't want girls that was the condition come on church that was the condition that Sarah was affected by yet she was not in Sodom but she was affected that's why we understand her her her ways how she acted come on she she was she was affected as we are many times our young people are affected we are so many times affected the the spirits don't know any border you understand that so they don't care to what church you go to so they know exactly and we are living in Satan's Eden right he is the God of this Eden is that right this is his Eden this is not God's Eden am this is his Eden where he is doing what he wants and we are pilgrims we are strangers in this Eden amen so really really understand it makes a little bit more clear why Sarah reacted the way he reacted and brother ROM was so um it was so amazing how he would he could look behind the scene how he could tell us situations out of the life of Abraham and Sarah do you know what brother wam told in that morning when when Abraham actually was sitting and it's beautiful for me this this scene is beautiful described here in the Bible he was sitting there in the heat of the day are we not living here in the heat of lisia In the Heat of the day we are living here right and In the Heat of the day Church In the Heat of the day he didn't know God just in his act yes sir oh trust trust we we allow that to that it really drops down see he saw God in so many in so many different ways he saw so many acts of God but he saw more than acts of God Amen all the time when he saw things he learned he he understood God in his ways now here came three men and no one had had a pillar of fire above his head amen it was a tanic visitation in human bodies is that right they could eat and they could drink so it was it was normal so on the outside now that man didn't carry a message book with him so as we many times identify when you go somewhere you know how do you get one another you know yeah I got the book in my hand okay then so but he just came and he was an ordinary man yeah he didn't look different than the other two right there was nothing in him amen nothing nothing there that Abraham could see ah but as Abram was looking at those three Hallelujah you understand as we are looking this evening on human vessels amen where God is living is that right this is the Bride of Jesus Christ is that true so as we are looking to vessels amen we should clearly identify the presence of the Lord is that not amazing how Abraham and here and and and that that man that never waved Abra said look look it's me it's me go it's me it's me no he just acted like the others and as Abraham looked at him looked at him he saw an identification because all his life he never only looked at God at his acts he could see God and he learned to know God in his ways God is identified by his characteristics is that right can we identify God today by his characteristics amen hallelujah amen so I and but really looking at the day really very very close I felt it's it's it's very important that we see the outside world and to really to understand and also to understand us and to understand why why a message came to make known unto us amen a prophet came to make known unto us God in his ways Hallelujah I trust we really understand but really watch really watch it was all the acts all the situations everything Sarah has seen so far and I believe she has seen marvelous acts right of God I I I believe she was there many times with Abraham as things were happening you know and she was witness eyewitness and yet and yet we understand she came at the end in in because it was the hour where the where the where the Fulfillment of the body change yeah was not happened yet so it was actually a quite silent time right mhm and we understand we are living actually in a time when it's quite a silent time people people want to make a lot of noise to not accept that we are living in a silent time because they cannot handle silence am have you see I I had people at my work I mean early years when people would come at morning into into what place the first thing they have to turn is a radio on because they cannot handle silence amen I want to ask you a question can you handle silence can you handle a silent God Amen oh you have to know him in his ways then you can handle a silent God Amen a silent God means silence in heaven yeah as we would hear it is an approval prise Lord you understand when a son comes to adoption sir the silent father is an approval prise I have sons they are they are above 30 if they are crying I don't move because I know they can do it themselves that's right come on Church sir God knows more what you are able of right than you know about yourself God knows if he allows things to come to you he told us he he would never test us about what we are able is it right so all that comes to us amen is not to bring us down is just to show us of what we are capable of it just actually shows us how far we are that's right so a silent God Church let never the devil tell you that a silent God is something that is bad amen oh can you can you oh no we don't go there we we don't we don't we we don't want to mess up the time from the beginning amen but but as we as we understand in Abraham Abraham here he and and and and and Elohim was coming next to all the things that had happened to Sarah next to all the things that had happened even in the time that brother Bram was saying we can speak of all the the acts that God has done right and we have seen many isn't it yet we are still here and our bodies is not changed amen so so nothing what what has happened what we could have seen has yet changed our body that's right amen hallelujah right so so we understand it will need more than just to see an act a work of God brother random would say if you one day the dead in Christ would rise he said and when you see watch very carefully when you see them coming he said this will be the last hit to you yeah because then you know this is God in his ways as brother renham told us how the change will be now when you see them coming what do you see you don't see maybe maybe they make not a lot of noise because they will not because the world will not recognize them they just come to the elect is it is it right and when they come they don't show maybe a sign to you absolutely not but when you see them coming you see this is according to what the prophet told us how it will be you see God in his ways and that has enough power to change your bodies the prophet says this will be the final so that our bodies will be changed because we understand now we are in the way we are in the plan we are just in the and the rolling of how the Rapture will finalize amen hallelujah there's so much power and we we can see it a little later that this was also the cause for Sarah to be changed amen and and but but let's quickly look a little bit around what was really going on there and and brother Adam had a had a wonderful and he was not shy to tell us things I mean he he Abraham wouldn't tell us Sarah wouldn't tell us but the Prophet you know how many times the prophet could just go into things and he would just tell a story amen remember the the sermon he preached on he preached a sermon and he was just telling the story and he said you know there as in Eden I can see Adam and Eve Walking you know you know the the Clapping of the of the skin of the animal on their leg next day brother said yesterday as I was in the vision as I were in the vision that's right that's right amen it was the prophet telling us the secret the prophet telling us the secret why why Rebecca came out he told us the secret why Rebecca came out and did something that Eleazar didn't ask yeah amen yeah the prophet told us because Abraham had said Abraham you know elazar had said how how can I make sure and then Abra said the angel of the Lord will go before thee and he was brother Bram and he makes that beautiful statement he said the angel of the Lord was 30 minutes 30 minutes quicker than Eleazar so he went to Rebecca is that right so finally Rebecca came out and then Eleazar just asked that one sentence and he told the Lord that that damel that I'm asking for drink and she will feed the camels also but I don't tell her so don't just speak about we do what brother brandham said she did something brother brother brandom or brother elasa didn't say and that was a sign that she was bright not to do what the prophet tells us to do is the sign that you're bright it's just a sign that you can read right it's just a sign that you can read and accept but to do what he didn't told us to do this is the sign of the Bride finally and can you imagine how Ela was jumping for joy as he was just telling her he said okay can you give me to drink and she said out from herself and who was responsible the angel of the Lord hallelujah and that angel of the Lord church I just want to identify this evening in our midst amen I want to know him in his ways how he's doing things I want to be there like Abraham yeah yes sir so that saw three men coming and the way that they were acting the way they were going the characteristic showed exactly that's him hallelujah amen and such a difference if we know him in his Acts or if we know him in his ways Hallelujah that's why the Bible said my thoughts my ways my thoughts are higher than your thoughts amen that's right so when we know him in his ways that it's different you know like an old couple you have an old couple they know one another amen you know I can put another skin on I can paint my my face black my wife will look at me and just said don't fool me you know why she knows me that's right amen and she knows more about me than that that I like coffee with milk you know she knows more about me that's right and we show we should know by now yeah amen amen that's right so much more about God because we are married to Christ and Jesus Christ is the heart of God am so as we are married to Christ we should know much more about God Amen God should not be a stranger in our midst we should know him in his ways by now this is always the the the way I when I come to church as a minister I I I I have I just want I just don't want to have the scripture just the Bible word for it I just want to see him I want to see him in his way I want to be sure that he's present and I learn to know him in his characteristics Hallelujah sir that's why that's why those characteristics you cannot deceive yeah right brother Bram said Satan can imitate everything that's right but he can never imitate the characteristic that's right he cannot yeah amen and how how beautiful that Abraham was there looking at three men In the Heat of the day under under under Sodom condition a wife at home she had a very bad day yes you know how brother Ram is is beautiful how he's he's describing it he said that morning he said he said Abraham and Sarah as Abraham maybe said goodbye to Sarah and said look I go and sit in the T door and then Sarah just said to herself I'm wondering what kind of Fanatics my husband will entertain today oh oh my you understand that so the that the home Sarah was frustrated total frustrated that's right amen you understand she was totally frustrated yes sir the whole situation of Sodom was on her neck yeah maybe maybe she had a she had a cell phone like we have today and she was confronted with situations amen like we are confronted amen so you understand that Abraham under that condition I just want to make you very plain under that condition Abraham was sitting in the tenter In the Heat of the day this is in his neck you're not a beautiful home and they you know what I mean it's just just tension at home that's right that's right Hallelujah but I'm so glad and I'm so happy that all the time from Genesis 12 yes he learned with everything that is heard from God he learned a little bit more about him remember when he met MDC or when MDC came to him you know MDC as Abraham was looking in the beginning God told him you know come out of and go into a country that I will show thee Paul tells us in Hebrew that he was looking for a city that's right so in the beginning it was just the country yeah because God couldn't show him and tell him everything from the beginning the same with us is it amen amen hallelujah amen in the beginning is just the bride is the land according to the Bible the bride is the land yeah that's right is that right right but then we learned as we moved on we learned that the Bride is a city that's right sir amen but remember as he met MDC in Genesis 145 or something like that and mzc came to him Abraham was actually on his on his journey to look for that City that's right and he recognized that the king of Salem would come to him and he understood when the king of a city is coming to me the city cannot be far away he understood that what he did not understand in that time that the king just came to his City God that's right so he didn't understand that he that the real him was where he was on the journey to find to am that's right amen prise prise the Lord but as he was walking and moving and God unveiling himself he saw so many acts and that's sad that too many people in the message are just focused on the acts when you tell him about ways they feel it's just Doctrine that's right or they feel it's too deep right so they rather have an act than the ways that's right that's true amen just just just just really be with me Sarah she saw many acts amen she saw many acts of God but nothing there yet to change your body amen hallelujah but it was it was really it was In the Heat of the day it was under Sodom condition and and as we are because as we look to Sodom condition we also have to realize as bad as the Sodom conditions are the Sodom conditions are connected to a work of God to a work of God amen the Bible said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be when the son of man that's right comes right you go to Matthew you'll find that amen but then Luke 17 tells us 28-3 he said as it was in the days of Sodom lot lot the days of lot are the days of Sodom right and the days of lot and Sodom are the days of Abraham amen amen between the days of Noah and the days of lot is about several hundred years mhm amen oh it's wonderful you understand that and brother Randon would say Revelations 10 and he speaks about Luke 17 the day when the son of man is come he could say it is fulfilled am because the son of man had come in flesh again right amen but then as we see the days of Sodom and watch it very carefully watch it very carefully this goes together with the days of Abraham right and if we understand what God is doing now we understand him in his ways amen because the Bible said as it was in the days of Noah Sodom or lot so shall it be when the son of man is being revealed yes right is that right do you believe that the son of man today that we are living in the hour not so much of the coming of the son of man but of the revealing of the son of man and brother brandham made the statement he said the son of man is revealing himself now in me through me and then brother brandham said he said it will continue it will not just be me he will do the same work with you amen the prophet said I and you together we will do that so you understand what goes together with Sodom condition what goes together we understand and this is what Abraham could see this is what Abraham could understand he as MDC came to him and he didn't realize what it was later he understood see he had seen God in so many ways and so many in so many manifestations and he did not he he he just didn't just hang on just an act of God yeah but he did not fail to understand to learn to see him in his ways hallelujah what a different story nobody else could see it lot couldn't see it oh my lot couldn't see it he saw two yeah and he said my Lord Abraham saw three and he ran to one fell down before him that's right and he said my Lord what could he see he had understood God in his ways suddenly he saw the characteristic of all the manifestations he could see bundled up in one man my is it not true that all that God was he put into Christ and everybody is shouting amen but then he said all that Christ was is nowh Amen in the church amen that means all that God is is now in the church you understand that manifesting the characteristic amen oh I trust we can understand I trust we can see the difference between the church and the bride the church is going we will we will see a little later what the problem was with Israel that's why God would say to Moses I make known my ways to Israel my acts um it was would say it was a special time actually when he came to Abraham I even would call it a special difficult time Sodom conditions to the top just before Sodom was burned yeah that's right is that right so it was bad so so even without being in Sodom it was it was not nice so it was a time of waiting is that correct it was a time of waiting it was a time when the promise was given long ago and proven and proven and Vindicated and Vindicated that's right and God came in Genesis 15 and Vindicated it again to to Abraham that's right confirmed the promise that's right so he had also it was and then it was 16 said it goes and goes and it was a time of waiting it was actually a time of Silence Hallelujah a time of Silence should only confuse the enemy the time of Silence should not confuse the church anymore Hallelujah because you know what happened in our day amen this is the hour we are just waiting on the Fulfillment of Romans the finalization of adoption amen is that right the final step of adoption which is the change of our bodies am that's right but this is the hour of adoption yeah that's right this is a time when the church is adopted and when the church is adopted don't be surprised about silence somebody can say Amen am if you know this is y of adoption don't be surprised about silence amen we should know God in his ways Hallelujah as a father as a father and a son when the time of adoption comes that's right and we understand the time of adoption is different than the time of birth amen that's right we understand Pentecost was the birth of the church is it correct but this is not the birth of the church that's right true amen this is the adoption of the church and when the church is in the adoption process it is not it is not a it is not is it should not be astonishing that God is silent that's right amen amen if you understand him and his ways what he's doing that's right that's right and as the hour comes that he said he see oh my oh my it was the hour of of when Esther came to her adoption that the King was silent Hallelujah the King was silent he was not calling for Esther he wasn't telling her now I married you because now come and do it no he was silent right right is that correct he was silent and in the beginning Esther was puzzled about The Silence she was just puzzled about as's being silent because you know there was a law in the land and the law in the land was that nobody could come to the king unless the king asked so Esther was a was waiting for the king to ask and he was silent amen amen and she was puzzled about The Silence amen one day Mori came by he said Esther he said you should not be puzzled about something silence prise God come on church it was a holy spirit coming to Esther telling her because you understand you came for a time like this to this position and when the King married you come on church when the King married you yes sir that means something yes sir that means something so Esther was puzzling she was and but the king would move you understand he wouldn't be okay okay no because he married her and with his marriage he showed everything to Esther amen come on oh my my my what is happening as brother random would preach the breach he made a very very amazing action as he preached the breach amen yo he's speaking about the lamb taking the book that's right is it right and then he's using phrases very very very very interesting that's right he said and it's the proph I just you know phrase it brother R said now the lamb come forth amen that's right and then brother BR said and let him take the book if he will yes sir and brother makes the next statement speak or forever hold your peace amen amen he does it in the breach that's right amen true you do that normally at a wedding right what is going on here remember brother Ram said the marriage takes place on Earth is it correct correct the marriage took place aerus took Esther as Queen and for him it was settled he had a lot of he had a lot of virgins to choose that but when he saw her come on jur when you saw her in the way that she was acting she said I have no choice because yes come on because she had a Chamberlain on her side that was responsible for the bedroom of the king so he knew exactly what the king liked in his bedroom and what not amen that's so as he gave it to Esther that's right and the King saw it yeah he un he understood plainly this is the one that you know why why vti was put away M she refused to show the beauty of the king amen that's why the church is refused yeah amen come on church because they refused to be pregnant with the further part of the word am that's right they call it fanatism yes sir they call it fanatism amen you know that's why vashi was put out yes sir because she refused to show the beauty of the king that's right of the Kingdom yeah that's right and and the King said I need another one yeah that is willing to unveil all who I am amen and when you saw Esther following higi amen he understood this is a woman that is able to unveil all of me that's why he was silent trust we can follow he was silent is it is it right and then Esther you know that came a day and she was really under pain and and she was she was she was she was struggling she she called a fasting out you know she something must be clear something is going wrong I that he he he he he never make a noise he never made he never wrote a letter he nothing amen that's right hallelujah praise God can can you see the picture see what God is doing yes sir can you see what God has done in this hour what he's doing with the church with the bride no there's nothing wrong Church there's nothing going wrong right amen that's right amen there's nothing going all is all is all is okay God is just manifesting more of himself that's and he's trying to ask you do you want to be my partner in my complete unveiling hallelujah amen and and as as the story went see it's another it's another story but as as it went with Esther finally you know she something broke open that's why brother bham said we should pray for Revelation more than for anything else so she had a three days of fast and prayer that's right for Revelation and then at the third day it broke open to her and then she said bring me the Garment amen that he married me in amen and as Esther was having that garment everybody was quite surprised and they felt now she's really no she now she's really you know she's moved and she's no no she said and everybody maybe was warning her Esther you cannot go but she no if you go without the king asking you it means you're death so as she she moved she never went backward to the king she never was crawling on her knees no right no she had recognized she had recognized what it was all about as the door was open and everybody kept his breath and the Bible said the king just put out his scepter right and he would tell Esther finally right finally and you understand that and she said King I was really confused because you know that is a law that tells you nobody can come to you unless you ask him yeah and the King said that's true Esther that is for the public that has nothing to do with you the Lord you understand when he came down when he took the book when he took the book that's right look how all changed yes sir no one was worthy not even to look at it that's right that's right but when he took the book when he said yes that's right that's right come on that's right the taking of the book is his yes that's right true I take you in marriage when he took the book is that right right before he took the book and only he could take the book is that correct it's always the husband that takes the wife and then the wife can say yes but it's his choosing is that correct amen so when he said yes and he took the book Hallelujah the same John a type of the Bride right that was not even worthy to look at the book now he is commanded to eat the book what a change right come on Church the same John that had that had no worthiness in himself the Bible said not even to look at it that's right amen that's true oh What is marriage changing amen that's right you understand that amen What is marriage changing Hallelujah so the Bible would say about Jehovah Jehovah would tell Israel Israel I am the Lord your maker that's right Isaiah you can read it the same God said you know and when he when he said when he said here the devil can jump in amen because who created the devil amen mhm that's right it's the same God Amen so as he said to Israel behold I am your maker Satan could say yeah well me also that's right you made me but then God said but that's not the whole story that's right he said Israel thy maker is also thy Redeemer and then the devil falls off but then it doesn't stop because if he redeems you he redeems you for a purpose that's right and then the same God said behold Israel thy maker who is thy savior is also thine husband and that shows the final relationship right that the Church of the Living God come to amen hallelujah and they come to that for a purpose yes it come for a purpose because God wants to unveil himself that's why it was the father it was Abraham looking for a wife that's right is it not this amazing that's right it was not Isaac looking for a wife that's right it was Abraham looking for a wife for Isaac is it correct yes sir is that not amazing so it was not Isaac hunting for a girl and said I need a no no it was Abraham said Isaac needs a wife and it was the father telling Eleazar don't go to that City don't go there it was not Isaac that's right it was Abraham telling why the father was concerned that's right it was not Adam making his own wife it was the father putting Adam to sleep yes amen at Calvary brother I'm said God put Christ to sleep so you are a work of God you know why you are a work of God because God wants to unveil himself that's why he is choosing a bride for [Applause] Christ oh isn't that wonderful because this is the unveiling of God we're living in the hour where God is unveiling himself am amen amen hallelujah hallelujah what a beautiful picture amen and and this is this but it it's it was for Sarah as we quickly go back it was for Sarah it was a waiting time allow me to to put that really in because we have to understand the hour that we're living in and uh under Sodom and under lisia conditions um it BEC so diff it became so difficult for Sarah that waiting that waiting became first frustrating because she was under the influence of of of Sodom you understand that she lived there she couldn't hand she couldn't do nothing on it she lived there and you cannot cannot help but you live in Satan's Eden right you are not in L like I said but you are affected by lisia conditions is that right everybody should be should have realized that this is the greatest battle what we have amen you you know you the spirits that are going around I mean you are affected by them even if you come to the best church here you're affected by them is that correct because we're living under and this brings a frustration so many times amongst us or amongst the family it's actually the spirit that is just this is this is those things that are let let loose on the earth is that [Music] right Hallelujah and yet and yet you understand how peaceful the one that came to Abraham was even when Sarah laughed he just said why does she love everybody could explain him why you know because it was it was fun is that right asking me an old lady but he said why so forg God is not a question when Sarah doubted God didn't doubt that's right you understand that's right because he did the choosing that's right and if God choose you you think God can make a mistake you think God is changing his mind on the way he said oh I think I think I choose the wrong one now cannot amen oh church we should understand if he choose you amise you're more than able amen yes sir and even your bad days even your bad days is not a reason for God that's right not to love you anymore who knows that God loves him I don't speak of of human love I speak of you understand that God cannot love you more or less true he loved you when you were still in sin that's right is that right he loved you when you converted right but he did love you more when you became a Christian because his love is constant and brother Brenham unveiled to us what his love is is he says his love to you is that he chose you do you know that brother Ram had that great trouble in his Darkest Hour Amen in his Darkest Hour when brother Brandon was on the point mentally he had given up mhm yes a prophet full of the Holy Ghost came to a place of giving up that's right mentally gone and brother Ram tells us also and I will I I just want to make you sure so far you don't have to go mhm he came to a point he wanted to commit suicide I tell you with this message you can rebuke every enemy right the enemy that tries to get you to Suicide telling you God don't love you right brother Ram said Satan couldn't tell me that there is no God I knew there is a God but what he could tell me is he don't love you look what happens to you right church God cannot love you more and he cannot love you less amen when you backslide God is not loving you less that's right when you come back to the Lord God is not loving you more amen amen he loves us not was apparently love that's right he loves us his love is election you understand that how you can throw that to every devil now yeah right oh I think it's necessary church I think it's never I know the de I know the devil that is going around that's right I know there's so many times that suicide spirit is hanging above people that's right and I know how he's working mentally amen but you can tell that Spirit you can tell that Spirit plain away plain he said you come too late that's right am you come too late whatever happens in my life whatever mistake I have done that cannot change God's love to me oh that should make us to overcoming Christians yes sir knowing that God loves us yeah but it was a waiting time allow me quickly allow me quickly it was a waiting time it was a waiting time for them it was the same waiting time uh that we are actually that we are actually in we just waiting for the hour and and brother R would make it plain let me quickly rephrase it how he's telling us that what something had started remember in the third seal brother Ram is telling the people third seal brother Ram is is as I can maybe uh uh uh quickly quickly read it to you brother R said that's what he said the bride hasn't had to Revival yet just rephrasing things am there has been no Revival no manifestation of God to serve the bride yet we're looking for it now it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again amen is that right that's right and then we know a little bit later in the recognizing youday in this message brother I'm telling plainly that's right it happened that's right it started that's right amen amen that's right amen so we a long time after it started that's right is that correct surely we're not waiting for a bride Revival surely not that's amen because we are here that's right so so we we are waiting for the we are not even waiting for the as as quoting we Brandon we are not really waiting for the coming we are waiting for the going oh if you have a few minutes time it's beautiful it's beautiful to see what that visitation we will not come to Moses tonight but what that visitation what that visitation did to Sarah what that did to Sarah Hallelujah that visit ation of not encouraging her a little bit this visitation was not just to mentally raise her up a little right that visitation was to show I cannot change my mind is it right this visitation that came to us that he appeared to us what a sign brother R wanted to show that to everyone God said no yeah that's not to the public that's just to my bride just for her right and turn the picture just for her it's me it's me coming it's the head come on church it's the head now coming to the body if the head comes to the body Jesus at that time 2,000 years ago he said foxes have holes birds have nests but the son of man has no body has no place to lay his head Jesus was not looking for a nice bed he wasn't looking for a wellness place he was looking for a [Applause] body Hallelujah and that body church we must accept that his coming allow me to say his appearance his appearance is a proof that the body is ready can we say Amen to that amen is is that the body is ready to receive it hallelujah what an hour are we living in church this is a proclamation this is God telling there we should not doubt it anymore because he he he told us I would not come down unless the body is ready oh my sometimes I I I I pray said Lord help me that we can make that clear to the people there's no reason for frustration you can frustrate frustration I believe that and not to put slogans up but as a as the enemy is trying you know you can give the enemy me a heart attack you can make him a n give him a nervous breakdown amen God is it right yes because we have the reality with us so regardless how your feeling conditions are right that's right feelings right I'm not interested to God Amen God is interested in do you believe oh my as but as as it is a time just just what watch carefully what we are really in now what really has started so we understand this is as brother Ram would say this is allow me quickly to rephrase he said this is church age book The Long awaited restoration amen they thought it was 2,000 years ago right they thought it was even when lisia started they thought isza Street was a long awaited restoration it was not amen but we are living in the hour amen amen where it said I will restore is that correct we are living in the hour of restoration right full restoration what means full restoration going back to where we came [Music] from oh my amen so this is allow me to say that this is the book of Acts 2.0 amen um let me quickly read to you the church age book and and see what brother bham is saying and and you will be you will be uh it you will enjoy it because we had we had a prophet amen telling us that that's right and now it's high time that we go back to what he said that's right yes sir not just to requote that but finally oh trust God opens our eyes finally we see what he saw yes finally we come to a time because you know when brother bam speaks something yes sir you cannot speak something unless you see something that's right true and as I always enjoy Also to say when people so in the message this became a slogan say what the prophet say and I say how can you say what the prophet said how can you say what I say not repeat me but say what I say right without you seeing what I saw and we have to see what Abraham saw and being able to identify him and his ways then we can say what brother Bram said otherwise we are just parrots right it just learned to repeat true Polly do this Polly do that Polly do this Polly do that that's right amen but we're not called to be parrots is that parot a good word we are called to be Eagles brother said Church H book page 15 he said a wonderful statement he said let me show you he said listen Satan he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Satan knows that yes you know how he knows that because he can read believe me when he spoke with Jesus it was a proof that he could read he said it is written amen plainly showing that he could read but to read it was not enough prise God to deceive Jesus Hallelujah so the devil knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that he changed is not amen amen he knows that the whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians because they don't read he knows that since God is inable his nature then is just immutable in his ways so not he doesn't change listen very carefully th Satan knows surely that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God is the true church that Jesus claims to his own everything else is false it has to be now remember this is not now what Satan knows but now brother R said now remember all the other things Satan knows because plainly he can read how many people know about things because they can read the prophet is it right honestly reading enough is not reading is not enough that's so beautiful church he said um now remember brother Ram said Christ in the true church is a cont continuation of the book of Acts okay um a continuation of the book of Acts Christ in the true church is not reading what they did right that's right and then doing the same that's right amen a continuation is a continuation Hallelujah you know how the book of Acts was they never copied no [Music] one they never looked in a book as said two disciples that walked that morning to the gate called Beautiful they never headed out of a book amen amen Hallelujah that was the book of Acts right amen so the book of Acts in continuation is not to read what they have done and then looking forward to do the same right amen right not even going back 50 years yeah and trying to do what brother bham has done you don't need to do what brother bham has done because God manifested himself and now God is waiting to manifest more of him because it's the same son of man Ministry working now in a many membered body hallelujah hallelujah let's turn quickly to Matthew so we we have the time we have the time before us uh let's turn turn quickly to Matthew very amazing scripture and Malachi Malachi sorry Malachi 3 so this is the book of Acts 2.0 this is Hebrews 13: 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever um before we read that you know how brother Brenham could figure out find out that Martin Luther was a church age messenger for his church age if you study Martin Luther he was a German by the way so did he choose John Wesley was John Wesley a messenger amen I would not have chosen John Wesley right no true right you know that John Wesley had a broken up marriage right mhm right would you choose a messenger come on Church would you choose a messenger to be the messenger of the church is with sanctification and he couldn't handle his wife if you if you go and study Martin Luther he was a trinitarian he hated the Jewish people would you choose a messenger he had excuse me when I say that okay but it's a reality he had a slogan he said in Heaven Is No Beer that's why we drink it here would you choose it would you choose him to be the church a messenger I just want hey if I I studied a little bit the church Edge Messengers we know Paul was a model is it right come on church as far as I know Paul was not married Martin Luther was what I want to show is and brother listen he was finding the church a mission there go to the book The Church a book I I quickly read it we should we should have the time brother said I was enabled by the Holy Spirit to see unfolded the pattern run through centuries right into this present day amen the key given to me listen to find out the messengers was not to study the life of Paul and to see who is fitting his life yeah no no come on Church yeah he said I was able to determine the messenger for each Ace and the key is the most scriptural key in fact it might be called hey and I jumped I jumped the Keystone of the Bible that's right it is a revelation that God never changes oh it's so beautiful that his ways are unchangeable as he is as it said in Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so that key that God doesn't change come on church amen he used used to find The Messengers if that is the most scriptural key oh church we should use it today to detect the true church yes yes so don't copy William brandham am is that okay okay yes sir amen hallelujah Martin Luther never tried to copy Paul it becomes better let's go to Matthew guess go to Matthew and this is this was to me so striking because as we have read God cannot change is that right are you not happy that there's an unchanging God he cannot change he cannot change his mind about his word he cannot change his mind about you but he can reveal his mind about you so God can never change his mind about his word but he can reveal his mind and looks many times that God changes his mind that's right because the unveiling is Progressive that's right amen you're with me V can never change his mind but now he came to unveil his mind amen praise God amen yes Matthew 3:6 uh ma Malachi I'm sorry Mali 3:6 quickly we we go there and then we we try to bundle it up and close it the scripture that we really enjoy read it with me enjoy it with me for I am the Lord and I change not therefore the sons of Jacob I'm not consumed the sons of Jacob are not consumed because God is unchangeable That's why nothing can consume us is that right sons of Jacob mean sons of his grace That's why nothing can consume the sons of his grace because they know God is unchangeable keep your breath in the Hebrew the word change the Bible said I am God and I change not is that right in the Hebrew Bible the word change means Shana you can look it up which means to repeat you can look it up or to do again so the other words God is saying I am God and I do not repeat myself I don't don't do things again oh I trust I trust the Lord is really is really opening to us what this message is amen what this message came for that's right this message never came to make us copies of something but this message came to allow us to be who we are right because only if we are what we are we can unveil what we are sent [Applause] for that's why no church should try to copy another church stay the way God Made You Stay the way you are Hallelujah no family should try to copy the other one that's right Paul never said copy me he said follow me as I follow Christ Hallelujah isn't that amazing if you watch the church a Messengers you wonder what in how in the world would the prophet be directed to Martin Luther you know by the way next to Martin Luther there were so many other Godly men yes yes Hallelujah but it fell on Martin Luther you know why he was a tool yeah to express justification amen that's right in his life yeah yes amen that's why when the devil came to him and he told him he said hey Luther you're drinking too much you know Luther said he said if you come to blame me that I drink too much I take another one you understand that I mean we we we we we don't what that was his life that's right and God the prophet was directed to him because through his life God could show justification he couldn't show it to William branham's life but to Martin Luther's life yeah yeah he could show justification isn't that amazing amen see what God how God CHS a certain Messengers representing for the age just to show more of him yeah that's why justification sanctification is was never never a copy it was just showing more of God baptism of the Holy Ghost but there it doesn't stop there it doesn't stop no no no no no there it doesn't stop it come after just after the baptism of the Holy Ghost now he comes and the fullness the entire Holy Ghost visits the church making God in human flesh again sir Hallelujah the final man manifestation not in lisia sir right but then he called it the bright age amen hallelujah amen oh if we if you really have understood him in his ways if you really have understood in in his ways as as Abraham would recognize him and no we we cannot go to Moses that would take too long but if you study the life of Moses finally at the end of 40 years God was tired with Israel and God said 40 years they just know me in my acts yes how do we know him today after so many years the prophet left the scene how can we identify his presence when somebody get healed to identify his presence you can can go to the denominations that's right that's true right amen a message had not come for this for that that's right amen but as a bride of Jesus Christ we should identify him now when no one of denomination I can identify him because we know him we should know him in his ways now as Abram would have known in his ways as William brandham looked there and then he said I always thought it is him yeah that's right and then he said that's him now he's here now amen is said that's why he said I can decrease I have to decrease and he has to increase amen because he is here now how did he saw him he saw he you know understand that he saw the wing God help us remember the prophet is telling the story of the great day when the when the when the when the court is coming together and judgment shall be passed on you okay because of all that you have done because of all your sins all your blah blah blah judgment will passed and then at that day your Advocate Jesus Christ has promised you I will never leave you or forsake you that's right amen and that day the seed where he normally sits next to you is empty he's not coming he's not there the court opens all the people come in the white hairs come all in the main judge comes in he has a wide wig onise and so you get very nervous because the one that is taking your case to plead is not there right amen church God open our eyes that we understand and see him in his ways and so the one that don't know the scene gets very nervous very nervous so the judge is sitting there he's just having the you know the wig yeah and he's looking in the direction of you and he's looking at you suddenly you realize the mimic even as he walked in is it he walks like my like my Advocate amen wonder you understand what's going on Amen yes sir suddenly as as he looks at you he looks at you and you realize he said what you see his eyes blinking suddenly you see hey that's him amen right yes sir you know what the case is finished right and you know why the judge had to come down you know why the judge had to come down in our day and the prophet could see the wide wig is that right and yet he clearly identify do you see his eyes do you see his nose that's him is that right that's him but you know why you had to come as a judge because the advocate can never pass the sentence right right is that correct only the judge can say you have never done it from the first is that right The Advocate cannot do that amen he cannot do that he's pleading for the case but only him in judge form can put the sentence down Hallelujah and as brother randim could see him and he said hey the characteristic did you see the hair is is weak you know angels and the prophet said I as I looked at the picture he said I always thought hey that's that's familiar to me uhuh till God show him told him okay now finally we just open it up turn the picture and then he said that's him that's him with other word Sarah listen praise God he's here he is here amen hallelujah prise God what started I'm closing what started in Genesis 18 was the appearing you know how brother bner would say he appeared to us in these last days and then he said there's a great difference between appearing and coming you know what the difference is the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right amen right yes that's true she makes the difference amen that's why brother brenon would call it the bright coming of Jesus Christ right so now when Sarah it started with an appearing that's right through Sarah it became the coming of the sun that's right because through Sarah the sun came is that right what started with an appearing in Genesis 18 ended in Genesis 2021 with with the coming of the sun amen what started in our day and how brother random would say look look look don't make that appearing the coming yeah right right amen praise but because of the churches here yeah because of the Bride is here it is the bride coming of Jesus Christ

happening and the world will not see the world will not see me anymore but you shall see me you shall see me because you shall know me as I am known you shall know me in my ways so you can can understand you are the second coming of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what an what an empowering of Sarah no wonder her body get changed amen that's right prise God hallelujah as we know him as we close as we close because we have to bring it in because we have to understand Elijah let's go back to Malachi promise you this is the last scripture but it's to me it is it was it was I I read it all my life the scripture because this is our famous scripture Malachi 4 right and now we understand surely why brother brandham came and also that quote I want to read in the message accepting God's provided way in the end times the prophet would say I ask you as Believers he's making a he's he's having a prayer line he said I ask you as Believers don't you move sit still and you believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen and I am here to make known his works and his ways praise how many have seen in the ministry of William Brenham The Works of God everyone you must be total blind not to see it but I ask you something who has seen his ways who has seen him in his ways because brother brandham said I am here to declare him in his works yeah and also in his ways amen praise Hallelujah we always enjoy chapter 4 for me it's four five and six behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest they come to Smite the Earth with a curse but you know what goes before that Malachi tells you in verse 4 he said remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded Tim on horb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments so Malachi is telling us remember remember Moses amen behold I sent you Elijah so when you think of Elijah don't forget Moses remember Moses and Moses come on Church Moses knew him in his ways amen right Hallelujah uh allow me allow me is that okay just I'm sorry for that so I I promise I don't come this year back again okay Psalm 81 quickly go with me sorry we have to do that Psalm 81 Psalm 81 to to wind that up Psalm 81 Psalm 8113 listen what God is saying about Israel oh that my people had hearkened unto me and isra had walked in my ways God's desire God's desire not just to unveil him in his acts but to unveil him in his ways but Israel didn't want Israel was just asking for acts that's right true is that correct and God said because of that I could never show you my ways yeah right amen what a lesson we can learn today am there's great strengths in seeing God in his acts but there's changing power in knowing him in his ways right praise the Lord Psalm 95 Psalm 95 8 to 11 you can also read it in Hebrews Paul pick it up Hebrews 38-11 Harden not your heart as in the provocation as in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work not my works so my work 40 years long was I grieved with this generation and said it is a people that do air in their heart and they have not known own my ways listen unto whom I swear in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest that's right amen hallelujah hallelujah God said 40 years 40 years I've tried to show you my ways only Moses I could teach my ways that's right Hallelujah no we don't have time for it Hallelujah isn't that wonderful you could see what Moses could do you could see what Abraham could do Abraham knew him in his ways that's why Abraham could step in and talk to him that's amen and said if you find 50 righteous that's 40 righteous 30 righteous 20 righteous 10 righteous it became so much that God has to turn away from Abraham because AB abah would have asked further and God could not say no that's right God Amen next morning as Abraham as as Sodom was to burn and God had went away from Abraham because God couldn't withstand him is that right that's why he moved away from him absolutely Hallelujah God knows you am that's right amen he knows that he cannot withstand you he knows that God now don't believe that I know that but that's the way it is next morning Abraham rose up early in the morning you know what Abraham did he went to the same place where he stood the day before that's right standing in the Gap amen he just stood there silent when God saw him standing there he said Angels go get him yeah and the Bible said that God saved lot because of Abraham exactly such an impact and you understand how God must have enjoyed it that's right how God must have enjoyed it that's why he enjoyed it to listen to Moses when Moses told him repent of your evil doing the Bible said and God repented of his evil doing praise God hallelujah what about the Bride of Jesus Christ then what about the Church of the Living God this evening hallelujah what about the Church of the Living God this evening what an excess we have if we know him in his ways God bless you let us stand to our feet Hallelujah let us stand to our feet and just give him praise and honor Hallelujah isn't he wonderful amen hallelujah let us pray together let's just worship and let us pray to him just just tell him I mean if if you sometimes I know it's it's I had a really a hard time myself to get around that and sometimes I said Lord this is this is too good to believe that's right but well as more I come to it I see how true it is amen because you see it in every scripture action that's right you can see it from Genesis to Revelation right right and at the end of the Bible Revelation 22 the beginning of the Bible it was a spirit of God that spoke in the end of the Bible it is the spirit and the bride amen it's not alone anymore saying the same thing you know why because they are the same amen can you believe it that what we what what has been said about from the prophet it has to do with you amen not with the church here in Ohio no it has to do with you who can say he said yes when he took the book that's right who can say yes am go now and eat the book because you must prophesy isn't that the story that we in God bless you let us pray Heavenly Father we are so grateful for what you have done in this days father it is everywhere it is overwhelming it is it is what we can say this is nothing but the truth amen thank you for a prophet thank you that he was not Tangled Up In first and second Paul that he he did not stop there but as he was going to the opening of the word so that the bride would know you amen in your ways Hallelujah father we have seen so many types and shadows there's so many evidences in the Bible there's a cloud of witnesses Hallelujah may you help each and everyone here this evening to believe encourage them this is not the words of a minister this is your own words spoken through a prophet he was just the mouse piece he was just declaring you just used him he was not he was not the speaker he was just like the microphone he was just a transmitter and we just want to say father We Believe father we believe it's your great plan you was you was responsible for the for the building of Eve of the woman you took a bride out of Christ you was responsible for it you allowed a Roman soldier to come by and what an what an awful picture that was but the enemy was used the enemy was needed to let loose the Bride of Jesus Christ so the enemy in this last hour again is needed to unveil through the bride all that you are Hallelujah we love you father we are so grateful that that you called us we are so grateful for your grace and for your mercy father and with all of our hearts we want to say Amen to what the word said we love you may you bless this church may you bless all the people here father may you bless brother Jed the the

unbelievable to just natural Humanity it is unbelievable it is impossible it is not reasonable but God is asking us to believe because he knows only his seed has the implanted Faith to believe the unbelievable so he's presenting the unbelievable because he knows only his bride can believe the unbelievable because she has not her own faith she has an injection of his faith the one who made the promise the one who showed his ways the one who revealed his ways is the same one who's has given you a measure of his faith to believe his ways I'm so blessed I just say God I want more God rub the
