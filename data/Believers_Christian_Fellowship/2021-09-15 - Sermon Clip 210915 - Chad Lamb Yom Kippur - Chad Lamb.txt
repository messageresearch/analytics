TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is my message to the church now as we go off the air just in a minute are you standing if you're standing on god's word and with god's word every amen that every every jot every tittle that means the full word where are you standing i'm trying to tell you pull away from them shucks and get out here in the weed where you can get right before the sun i hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place hallelujah talk about a thanksgiving i feel real good i'm more thankful for that than anything i know you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and washed in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect he drops down a couple paragraphs and he says you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place god don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it praise god that's how effective this washing is in this end time amen that's what's been given to the bride at the end time that can wash such a purification that a prophet of god can look at you and say this bride if you're standing with the word and you're standing on the word every jot every tittle what's he saying there's no more unbelief amen you're not i'm an unbeliever of the word but the full word has come and you're standing with the full word you believe it you've received it you've submitted to it he says you're perfect amen and he's not talking about you know the little mistakes that you make and he's not talking about you've come to sinless perfection and you'll never make another blunder brother venom is not talking about that because he says otherwise later but what he's talking about is the condition of your soul your condition before god because you've come to the i am you've come to the atonement amen himself and when you come to that atonement the full word that is coming this day through a prophetic ministry you said that's nothing but the truth i believe it i give my whole life to it and that word washed you from all the sins of unbelief in your life and in your heart and he says you're sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ you never did it in the first place because this original word comes to awaken an original seed inside of you and under the washing of the original word it takes that seed to its original condition and brings it to life and that seed never did it in the first place that seed was part of god part of god's thinking it never was in sin to begin with and the washing of the water of the pure word washes everything away from that seed and springs it to life in an original form which is pure
