========================================

near [Music] praise the lord god bless you folks [Music] is he worthy is [Music] is here [Applause] [Music] you are worthy worthy you are worthy worthy you are worthy i worship you [Applause] you worthy worthy is one more time oh yes me [Applause] hallelujah praise his holy name praise be to god amen don't you love him don't you love to praise him who else can praise him but his children who else can praise him but those who know him amen amen the father is seeking such to worship him that will worship in spirit and in truth amen i really appreciate that especially man god was moving man it's our privilege as children of god to worship our father amen when he's revealed so much to us and he's placed us and he's called us and he's showed us who we are amen it doesn't it somehow there's such a humility that comes with that such a desire just to tell him how wonderful he is how beautiful he is how precious he is to us oh praise be to god we love you this morning we're so glad to be together man while we're standing let's just take our bibles and go to the word let's turn to ephesians chapter one so say god bless you visitors that are with us we appreciate you being here you're more than welcome we appreciate god's spirit being here the holy ghost moving amongst us amen amen praise be to god god is good and i want to read here from ephesians chapter 1 verse 3 said blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ are you there if you're there in heavenly places in christ if you're already there not hoping to someday be there but if you're already there you're blessed with all spiritual blessings and sometimes i believe we live below our privileges because we don't realize where we've already attained to by the grace of god we're already in heavenly places in christ jesus therefore we're blessed with all spiritual blessings already and so so many times we're waiting for something to happen and the reason we're waiting to not realize it's already here amen we're already partakers it's already mine it's already portioned to me god is looking for somebody who can believe it amen when jesus was here on earth amen the the power to heal was here the prophet was here the one that moses spoke of was there amen but they didn't realize he was there amen but there was a little woman with the blood issue amen and she realized there's something there amen she knew within herself if i can but touch the hem of his garment i can be made every bit whole amen why she wasn't waiting for something to come she realized it was here and she got what she was seeking because her revelation is that that was there amen if our revelation is that i'm already there i'm already seated in christ in heavenly places now i'm blessed with all spiritual blessings i am a spiritual king and a spiritual priest i'm not waiting i'm here it's all mine friends it changes our behavior changes our attitude it changes our thinking amen let's read that again blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that means you were in him before the foundation of the world he's chosen us in him before the foundation of the world so where were you in him when were you chosen in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will that's the scripture that thrills me despite what i wanted in life despite what i hoped for no matter how much i longed to be his or long to be accepted by him or long amen it wasn't my purpose or my will that brought anything to pass it was his will and his purpose and because he had a will and he had a purpose he chose us in him before the foundation of the world so that his will and his purpose will never be defeated and he chose us that way so that we could be holy and blameless in love everything's already taken care of friends there should be no worry no fear no scare among us amen this morning by the grace of god i'd like to minister on a subject a chosen vessel for an ordained purpose a chosen vessel for an ordained purpose let's just bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing dear heavenly father we love you lord jesus and we thank you god for all that you're doing for us god your your plan of salvation your plan of redemption is mesmerizing it's amazing lord as you begin to open it up we begin to see that you've included us lord that we are part of this plan of redemption we are part of your plan a part of your thinking a part of your mind from before the foundation of the world and lord when we see that and the reality strikes our heart lord it's amazing god we don't want to take it for granted we don't want to just speak it as words or phrases but lord we want the reality of that to strike into our souls and bring forth the fruit that you've ordained for this moment in time for this hour and for this place we just asked all that you would take preeminence lord over the vessels that are gathered here that you would have your way in every part of the service in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated god bless you amen when we talk on this subject i've ministered on these things many times before this is not anything new there's nothing new here but it just becomes more vivid all of the time it becomes a greater reality in our lives all the time and like i mentioned before when the eagle starts soaring when you see him catching up draft you'll see the eagles start circling and circling and circling but every circle they're going higher and many times we circle back through the same things that that the prophet of god taught the same things that we preached before but each time we're going a little higher and seeing a little more clearly and a little higher and the prophet of god said the the higher an eagle goes the better its vision is amen and every time we're circling here in this updraft of the word we may cover the same theme again but when we go a little bit higher and a little bit higher and a little bit higher amen i want to read a quote from the prophet of god from the god who is rich in mercy from 1965. now we might i might inject just a little bit of doctrine here that if you don't believe it all right that's that's just okay i do believe it me too i believe that a man when he's born in this world that when you're a little baby born in the world you could not have been here without being the foreknowledge of god because he's infinite he knows all things when that little baby is born into the world there is something in that baby if he's ever going to have life there's a little something in there in that child then that he comes to sooner or later that little seed is in him now if you'll just take the scriptural plainly declares that now if you've got eternal life tonight if we have eternal life then we always were because there's only one form of eternal life we always were and the reason we were because we were part of god and god is the only thing that's eternal amen if we can have faith that we have eternal life we have to have faith that we were in god amen that god's family came from him amen you know my family came from me my children came from me and the children of god came from god they're a part of god they belong to god when we say heavenly father it's not just a phrase it's not just a term it's declaring origin when i say you're my father i'm declaring my origin that i came from you i'm one of your attributes i am i'm a child of yours and if i'm a child of yours i came from you amen so many things we get caught up in christian phrases amen and they become phrases with no meaning but the actual when we actually speak these words with understanding they have tremendous impact these are powerful things that we say he's my father well hallelujah if he's your father then you're the same thing he is [Applause] when jesus says that he was the son of god they knew he made himself equal to god amen the the the the jews the scholars and the rabbis in that day they understood clearly that if jesus could say i'm the son of god then he immediately put an equal sign between him and god and if i today can say i'm a son of god what does that do to me amen what am i in any different position i'm in a different category so of course not jesus christ but a child of god part of god he goes on to say now we are part of god you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in god you were only in his thinking your very name if it ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were oh praise god we've heard that we've heard that year after year after year we've read it in the scripture all whose names were not written in the book of life from before the foundation of the world we've read it we know it but it's got to become a living reality that takes all fear right out of your mind because it's already determined it's already happened it's already written and he's not going to change it he said i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare why is he teaching this to get us away from this fear and scare always scared that i'm going to mess up and i'm not going to be a child of god always is scared that somehow i'm not going to make it i'm not going to be one of them i'm not going to make the rapture i'm not going to be in heaven amen you didn't make the rapture because of your earthly conduct you made the rapture because your name is in the lamb's book of life from before the foundation of the world you've already made the rapture because god could declare that there would be a rapture knowing that there was going to be somebody in the rapture and he wouldn't declare there's a rapture unless he knew who was in the rapture god knows the end from the beginning amen what's brother brahm trying to do what are we trying to do take away the fear and scare you amen it's so hard sometimes we realize we're children of god we're expressed attributes of god but when you're walking through the store when you're driving down the road when you're sitting at a red light amen it's so easy to slip back into spiritual amnesia it's so easy for all of us to go back to just thinking of our human existence only in our human life in the beginning and that we began at our our natural birth amen where we had two earthly parents and we come forth in a hospital or someplace like that and began to live a life and and that's spiritual amnesia forgetting what was before forgetting where we came from and forgetting who we really are and it's so easy amen to drive down the road amen and slip back into that carnal natural just carnal existence amen but god is wanting us all the time to realize you're not just a carnal it's not just carnal experience it's not just earthly but you come from god you're going back to god you're an expressed attribute of god amen he wants to mold you after the image of himself he wants you to express there's this portion of himself that he wants to express through you [Applause] and he wants us to stay conscious of this all the time and quit slipping back amen into the in to the false amen slipping back into the negative but he wants us to stay focused on the positive so that this can be a proper reflection of what's over there [Applause] see it's so easy that's why that's why sometimes we harp and we preach on worldly entertainment and being caught up in the things of the world and in movies and entertainment and sports and and all of this social stuff because the the problem isn't and the problem is it it pulls you back into spiritual amnesia [Applause] that's the real problem it's constantly pulling you back amen we're not just harping on it to harp on it we're harping on because we've got to stay in the word because the word brings us the reality the word tells us who we are amen constantly feeding on that word gives you a proper identification of who you really are constantly in fellowship around the word amen fellowship on the things of god in the house of god hearing the preaching listening to the tapes reading our bible in prayer these things keep us in the right frame of mind but the things of the world amen cloud they fill our mind with other things and begin to take us away from the spiritual reality amen they become addictive to the flesh amen and the whole attempt is to pull you away from the spiritual and keep you planted in the cardinal because if you stay carnal and carnally minded amen the the devil could easily defeat us but when we focus on the true spiritual reality the devil cannot stand before the expressed word of god amen so sometimes these it seems like we're just harping or preaching or just blasting certain things we don't realize those things bring influence and the influence take us away from the influence of the word we can't walk two roads at the same time [Applause] god wants his bride singularly focused on him praise be to god don't know where i'm at so i might just repeat a little bit i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out then we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are you're not going to be but now you are sons of god you always were the sons of god for when god had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before there well when he before he even became material here on earth before there was anything but god you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be he knowed the color of hair you would have he knowed all about you the only thing happened is when you you be being a sinner many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy or little girl you would walk around and there would be a certain thing that would just where it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out that could be even in the midst of your sin doing horrible things but there was still something there there was something somewhere there was something somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then there was a little form of life in you then amen it's a little portion of god a portion of eternal life a little piece of himself and it was there then it doesn't come to you at some point amen the life of god comes to the life of god laying there amen to quicken it to life to bring it into manifestation to bring you to the realization of what's there [Music] praise be to god that was that little form of life in you then and then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination but one day you being part of god you had to be part of the word and when you heard the word you know where you come from you know what was the truth you were always the seed was in you always the word seen the word that was in you get that the word seeing the word that was in you who is the word god god is the word and the word seen the word that was in you and the word was god and the word seen the word what's in you it's not different friends it's not anything different the problem is the carnal mind can't say that but the spiritual mind can say that's thus stayeth the lord that's the truth amen the the word when you heard the word you know where you come from you know that was the truth you were always the seed was in you always the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you come to it like my little eagle story of how the little eagle was hatched out under a hen and the little fellow walked with the chickens the hen clucked and he didn't understand her clucking and the little chickens their diet they had in the barnyard he didn't understand them how that they did that but there was something in him seemed to be different from what the chicken was because of the beginning he was an eagle see he he didn't have to change from what he always was he had to have something to wake him up to the reality of what he always was you weren't changed from tear to weed you weren't changed from goat to sheep if you're a sheep you're always a sheep if you're a wheat you were always a wheat but something came to wake you up to what you always were that's right one day his mama came hunting him and when he heard the scream of the ego it was different from the cluck of the hen and that's the way it is with every born-again believer you can hear all the theology you want to and all the men made discrepancies but when the word flashes out there then there's something take a hold you come to it i mean that's why i said before i'm not going to preach the message in a theological way to try to entice somebody's mind amen because that'll never hold amen we're not looking for convincing chickens that they might be eagles but we're giving an eagle screen to attract the ones that are all ready eagles they're all ready and eagle but they don't know they're an ego but there's something in them that can connect to the word of this hour preached in its full power and authority there's something already there when they hear the scream something inside says amen their mind might be absolutely saying i've never heard this how is this right this can't be true but something inside is leaping for joy because it's finally found something that came from home amen this is something familiar something from home and the spiritual amnesia is starting to break amen but when the word flashed out there was something take a hold you come to it you who were once dead in sin has he quickened there has to be life there to quicken first gone by his foreknowledge knowed all things and we were predestinated to be sons and daughters of god ye who were once dead in sin and trespasses wherein we all had our times past but hath he quickened look at paul when paul was a great theologian but when he come face to face with that word jesus it quickened he come to life right quick because he was ordained to be that that he was the part of the word and when the word saw the word it was it was his nature when the word saw the word as you realize when we come to the truth of this hour the message been given to us by a prophet of god when we come to the restoration of the word that was originally given to the to the pentecostal fathers when you come to that it wasn't your mind that caught anything it wasn't your intellect it was the word that saw the word it was the word inside that saw the word for the hour made manifest and those two things clicked together and when the word saw the word it was his nature all the clucking of the hens and the orthodox churches didn't have no effect upon him he had saw the word it was part of him he was an eagle he wasn't a chicken he was just in the barnyard with them but he was an eagle to begin with what were you to begin with an eagle how do you know because i heard the eagle scream and it resonated inside and sirs we would see jesus he said in the beginning god was not even god he was the great eternal and in there was attributes attributes was his thoughts and then he become a word like this and a word expressed well a thought expresses a word a word expressed as a thought and then remember if you ever was in god's thinking you always will be there if you got eternal life you are the expression or the attribute of his thought for this age you got that that's not a generic thought if i could hammer that down if he thought of you it wasn't a generic thought he didn't just think of you but he thought of you in this age and he thought of you in your body and he thought of you in your position in place because that's how he saw you that's how he wanted you amen that was to accomplish something in this age it wasn't a generic thought it was a very specific thought there was only one eternal life and it always existed and you and his mind existed before there was a world that's the reason he said he chose you before the foundation of the world it isn't what we think what somebody else thinks it's what god eternal you always was see in his thinking so it didn't matter what you thought about it it didn't matter how wrong your thinking was it was his thinking from the beginning that's what we're coming to and modern events made clear my prophet said you were a gene of your father and you were in your father yet your father had no fellowship with you he was in there but you knew it not and he knew it not but you were manifested that you might he might have he might fellowship with you and you being born again you're born of eternal life and that's the only one form of eternal life and that's god's life zoe the greek word zoe only one form of eternal life then if you are a son of god or daughter of god you were in god all the time but he knew what bed in time that you'd be planted all this should give us great consolation friends god knew what bed and time that you would be planting you were ordained to be in the flesh body you're in and you were ordained to come to earth in the time you came to earth you were born at a specific time in a specific place under a specific sign in the heavens you believe that because every seed of god was ordained and placed positionally by god's thinking before the foundation of the world he knew what bed and ground it would be planted in he knew what bed and time you would be planted so now you're made a creature a son of god manifest his son or daughter of god to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living god of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time you're here amen you're not here to have a job and have a family and make a retirement and enjoy a few pleasures in life you're here to manifest the true and living god the message that's come forth in this hour you're here to manifest the message which is the word of god which is the true and living god and so we gotta we gotta quit letting the world strip us from our position and strip us from our placing we're here to manifest the true and living god the message that's come forth in this hour amen we've got to quit being carnal and quit being worldly because that's not what we were put here for praise be to god he said that's right you was done there before the foundation of the world if he wasn't chose that way no matter how much you try to impersonate it you'll never make it let's turn to ephesians chapter 2. ephesians chapter 2 verse 8. for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god boy you really did a pretty good thing when you finally figured out that the word of god is true and i should go ahead and get saved you didn't do nothing amen for by grace you're saved through faith and that not of yourselves it's the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast you can't be proud about getting saved you can be thankful you can be grateful but you can't be proud because you didn't do it for we are his for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them let's catch that he saved us by grace through faith and not on us not that not of ourselves is the gift of god why not of works so you can't boast for we are his workmanship his creation his molding his fashioning we are his workmanship he worked us and made us we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works so there's works for us to do which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them you mean he didn't just save me so i could be saved he didn't just give me faith so that i could have faith no you're saved by grace through faith because he had a purpose for your life he you're his workmanship his creation his fashioning his moaning ordained unto good works creating crises in the good works ordained that we should walk with them before god has already determined there's something for you to do and if we're to do that we've got to be serious about it we've got to surrender our lives completely to him because there's something he wants to do he saved us for his purpose not our purpose he saved us by his will not our will let's go to second timothy 1 7. i i think brethren we we've got to get away from the idea that the minister is called and ordained are certain gifts or are certain officers in the church or certain positions they're called and ordained amen that that that that thinking will allow you to sit in your seat amen and not fully express the attribute that's inside of you that thinking will hinder and hamper the expression of god in this age we think well the one on the platform's ordained to be there certain officers in the church they're ordained and called to be there and you know i'm just here i'm just here to be part of the whole the whole thing and watch the ones called to work do the work no you're called to do the work each one of us individually are called according to his purpose nothing's without a purpose you're positionally placed you're there to fulfill a purpose to express a certain portion of the attribute of god that's inside of you that only you can express amen nobody else can express it so we got to get away from the whole mentality that those are they're called and they're called in their place but i'm nothing amen that's the devil that's the devil trying to stop the work of god in this age because you're called to manifest the true and living god the message of this hour you not the preacher alone you not the ministry alone you not the officers in the church you you at work you and your home you when you drive down the road are called to manifest the true and living god [Applause] so if we have the wrong thinking we bring forth the wrong manifestation [Applause] because as a man thinketh in his heart so is he we've got to take our thinking and tune it in and dial it in to match what the word says about us because the word doesn't say you're just a hanger on you're just a tagging along no the word doesn't say that the word says you're you are his workmanship in christ jesus amen and ordained unto good works which he before ordained you should walk in them if you're not going to do it who's going to do it nobody else because you were ordained to do it see there's spiritual laziness that creeps in and the devil wants to bring back spiritual amnesia amen so that we can just be a church member there is no such thing as just being a church member there are only sons and daughters of god and a son and daughter of god of absolutely they'll be part of an assembly for sure they'll be part of a body amen they'll be contributing but they won't be a part as a church member they will be a contributing part as a son or daughter of god positionally placed by god with the revelation that i'm here in this body with this temperament for his purpose the devil is trying to hinder the expression of god amen by trying to take away people's authority and their position second timothy 1 and 7. for god has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me as prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god who have saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began when was your purpose declared and when was your purpose given to you when you were in christ jesus before the world began that's an eternal purpose for your life don't let the devil tell you anything different don't let the devil make you a church member god's calling you to be a son and daughter of god and the devil's trying to make you comfortable being a church member he's trying to make you comfortable just coming to church on wednesday coming church on sunday living a decent moral life believing that god sent a prophet and there's a message and i'm just going to be a church member and that's my position and that that position will hinder the expression of god in your life that position will not that that mentality will not put you in your position because god has a position for each individual in his body amen but but the devil's trying to get us just to be satisfied which is being in the message of just being in the church that's not what you're called for you're called to be a son or daughter of god an expressed attribute of god see this message didn't come to puff up a man this message didn't come to prop up a certain category over another category this message that came this message came to lift the bride into her position and the bride is the many member body of jesus christ on earth today and it's many members and every member counts and every member has a position and every member has a job so this message didn't come to promote one over another this this message came to lift the bride into her position amen let's read that again verse nine who hath saved us and called us a a holy calling not according to our works it wasn't what you did that got you anything it you didn't get your position by what you did you got your position before the foundation of the world and his purpose for you was determined before the foundation of the world when you were in christ jesus not according to our works but according to his own purpose that's why if we feel like if i do everything right if i just get right and i really study the message i'll read the message and i really come to church and i really pray and serve god amen then god will give me a position wrong thinking you already have a position you're not hoping for one you're not trying to attain to one you're not working your way up into one you already have a position that was given to you in christ jesus before the foundation of the world and you're the one for that position nobody's gonna take it no it's not going anywhere we've got to step into that and express what god wants us to express in that position amen not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of our savior jesus christ who has abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel let's go over to romans 8. romans 8 and 28. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are he called according to his purpose now let's look at this scripture this scripture has been a scripture given for consolation and it is it's a good consolation type scripture when you're going through troubles when things are difficult amen that that all things work together for good that's absolutely true but all things work together for good because of his purpose not because how special you are and how nice you are and how good what a good boy or girl you've been and how much you've been obedient and nice and done nice things that's not what happens amen all things work together for good for to them that love god and are the called according to his purpose everything's working good because of his purpose that's why in the midst of the worst trial of your life you can sit back and relax because nothing will defeat his purpose in your life we don't have to be afraid we don't have to be scared amen we've got to have confidence in god more confidence in god than our works more confidence in god than our will more confidence god than our thinking because it wasn't our thinking it wasn't our will it wasn't our works that put us in this position but the position was determined in christ jesus before the foundation of the world and we've got to believe that but but satan comes in and gets us to start acting like it's based on our works and our ability and our thinking why we live so defeated and so under our privileges and so nervous and scared all the time because we think i'm not getting it right and i'll never get it right and that's not it friends everything is going to work out because of his purpose everything's going to work together because his attributes will be on display he will not be defeated sons and daughters of god are not going to be lost amen they're going to fulfill the purpose he purposed in christ jesus before the foundation of the world nothing will stop that we got to get comfortable with that fact comfortable with the fact that he called me he chose me he placed me i'm here not by my will i'm not for my purpose but i'm here by his will for his purpose and i might as well get comfortable with that so that i can start expressing what he wants me to express [Applause] we've been so inhibited by wrong thinking we've been so held back by wrong thinking and lack of understanding we're spiritual creatures ordained of god to works and we've been holding back because we've been looking at the natural too much and we've been inhibited by the wrong understanding wrong teaching wrong doctrine carnal mind we've got to be lifted up into the spiritual and understand that i'm here to fulfill his purpose and i can do what he's called me to do and nothing can stop the works of god in my life but to speak with confidence move with confidence walk with boldness why is the sons and daughters of god so timid concerning the word of god it's our portion it's who we are it's what we are and if somebody's going to express the word of god in this age who's going to do it it's going to be the children of god look at this again romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god to them who are they called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called let he also justified whom he justified then he also glorified future tense past tense are you hoping to be glorified nope i've already been glorified am i hoping to make it the glory no i came from glory and in the mind of god i've already made it i went full circle i've already arrived i'm not worried about arriving i'm not worried about making it i'm not worried about being a son or daughter of god all i'm worrying about is stripping away the carnal walking by the spirit so i can catch what he's trying to do this moment in my life i'm not i'm not afraid of making it i'm not afraid of things working out i'm not afraid of the devil i'm not afraid of diseases i'm not afraid of financial circumstances i'm not afraid of the government i'm not afraid of anything see that strips us away i mean it kills our spiritual sensitivity because we're always worried and afraid and worried about something but when you can strip the fear and the scare away then you can get tuned in with god and say god what are you trying to accomplish with this vessel with this attribute at this moment that's the life the bride has to live she's going to be consciously aware moment by woman he's got pre he's going to have preeminence in me he's accomplishing his purpose he's doing something in me i'm not waiting for it to happen it's happening now god make me sensitive god let me be tuned in god let me walk amen by the spirit the bride's got to it's got to come higher it's got to change the same old same old's not going to work there's got to be a greater preeminence a greater sensitivity a greater walk in the spirits and how are you going to get there if you're afraid afraid you're not going to make it afraid you're going to be lost afraid that if you mess up you'll be kicked out of that's why the prophet of god came to correct this wrong doctrine to set it straight so he can take the fear and scare away so that we can be who we were always called to be the devils tried when you were a child to wrap chains around you with circumstances and complexes and fears we've got all kinds of complexes the prophet of god dealt with complexes what the devil tried early on to label you all of you got one or another you got a label you were the rebellious one and you're the stupid one or you're the product of that that's right you got a label if it wasn't direct maybe it was indirect but the devil amen deception always comes the the fall always comes by deception deception comes by a lie and the devil from the time we were little tots tried to get us to believe a lie i'm the rebellious one i'm no good i won't amount to nothing i'm the stupid one [Music] if you're human you've had something like that nobody wants me i'll never be good enough lie lie lie lie lie in the flesh that's all true but in the mind of god that's all a lie [Applause] and we've walked around with chains unnecessarily because we identified with the lie and believed it amen i'm not the spiritual one i'll never get it i'll never understand lie lie lie lie what are we going to start saying what the word says i was chosen in him before the foundation of the world he's ordained me unto good works that he ordained before that i should walk in them amen he's got a purpose in my life and there's something he wants me to do and i'm not accepting that label i'm accepting this label the label i'm accepting is son of god and with that label i'll overcome that complex i'll conquer that idea and that wrong teaching and that wrong concept by the word of god [Applause] see there's a difference between confidence and arrogance arrogance is somebody who doesn't really have it but trying to make others think they got it that's arrogance but a true revelation won't bring arrogance it will bring confidence and confidence doesn't have to prove anything it's already proved the bride of jesus christ doesn't have to prove anything amen that's why amen they they tried to trap jesus christ but brother bam said he never clowned for anybody [Applause] do this and do that raise him up in the graveyard and they tried to get brother branham to do the same thing but you don't have to prove anything because you're not afraid of anything amen if somebody doesn't believe you so what it's not my job to convince everybody that divine healing's true it's not my job to convince everybody that the message is true if they don't believe me that doesn't change me the only time we get hindered is when we have to convince somebody and we got to convince them i'm right because if they don't think i'm right then there's a doubt inside of my heart that they're expressing by their unbelief and then we get combative and then we get argumentative and then we try to at this angle and that angle and why what we're actually trying to do is get to them to confirm what we're saying so that it covers the unbelief in our heart but confidence doesn't argue confidence doesn't fight confidence isn't afraid confidence doesn't have to prove anything confidence is built on faith which is a revelation i know who i am that's why jesus christ didn't have to speak at his trial what did he have to prove he knew he was the son of god he didn't have nothing to prove he was just walking in the will of god his father was in total control when he's getting punched his father's in control beard ripped out of his faith father was in control spit on father was in control oh may god let us get to that position that no matter what's happening my father's in control and i'm here to express something in his nature there's part of the word that's predestinated for this hour that's got to be alive and flesh and he's chose my flesh and if this circumstance comes to me it's so that he can gain victory so that he can be expressed in this situation now i'm not afraid of the situation because it came for his purpose and for his glory that's confidence amen let's go to psalms 139. psalms 139 verse 13 david is writing this psalm says for thou has possessed my reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul north right well my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in the secret and curiously wrought rotten the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them when you didn't have fingers he wrote your fingers in the book when your members were being fashioned to continue he wrote them in the book and knew them before they were formed yet let's read that again thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect that means you weren't finished you were just starting and in my book all my members were written which in contingents were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them if i should count them they are more in number than the sand when i awake i am still with thee can you have that same revelation before i came to the earth before i was formed he knew my members he knew what i would look like he knew where i would be born he knew what my parents would be he knew my digits he he knew my limbs because he had a purpose in making it thus and everything was fashioned for his purpose can we believe that and if you can believe like david can believe then you can believe the next statement how great are thy thoughts about me how precious also are their thoughts unto me oh god how great is the sum of them amen if you thought about me before i was even born how much have you thought about me if you thought about me amen before my members were formed before i came to this earth before you were using me in this capacity if you thought about me then how much have you thought about me david says great is the sum of those thoughts when we go back up to verse 14. says i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made this word wonderfully is paula from the hebrew it means to be distinct marked out be separated be distinguished praise be the god when god made us we were fearfully with reverence in all fearfully and wonderfully distinguished and separated individually and precisely we were made not like everybody else not a clone but distinctly and separate were you fashioned because he's got a separate and distinct attribute for you to express so he formed you in a distinct and precise way with all and reverence why because that vessel is going to contain the very life of god that human vessel is going to hold eternal life and that human vessel is going to be the betting ground of the word and that human vessel is going to manifest the word in that day now we've got to get away from thinking i'm made wrong there's something wrong with me amen that thought's got to die too i'm wrong there's something wrong with me there's nothing wrong with you just surrender your life let the holy spirit come in and burn out everything that's not supposed to be there but god is not going to change the essence of how he made you because he made you fearfully and wonderfully to complete a task on this earth and if we keep thinking why am i this way i wish i were that way you're denying the very purpose of god and the devil gets us to say things that are contrary to the word of god i wish you had made me like this oh please don't ever say that again oh i feel like god made a mistake when he did this god doesn't make a mistake we got to quit wishing we were like brother so and so our sister so and so i wish i was like this don't ever do that again because god doesn't need two of the same thing [Applause] [Music] he needs something unique separated fearfully and wonderfully made see the bride's going to be in her position every member and she's not going to be afraid she's not going to have doubt she's going to know where she's placed and she's going to stay in that place because there's power that comes from positions you realize in an army everybody's got a different job to do you have the infantryman you've got the artillery you've got the supply chain you got the cooks you got the air force you got everybody they're all working together for the same objective and this is a mighty marching army this bride is supposed to be an invincible army but we're not all the same thing in this army and we can't all be the same thing if you sent out an army of a hundred thousand men and they were all infantry they'd last about two days amen they'd run out of ammo the first day they'd run out of food they would faint be weary and all die so why do we all want to be the same thing we're all the same thing there's no power there's no overcoming but we all have to find what god made how did god make me what is what am i interested in what am i good at what am i can do how can i contribute that's the exact way he wants you to contribute oh i wish i could drive the tank somebody's got to fix the tank somebody's got to put fuel in the tank if if the guy who's supposed to put fuel in the tank is off daydreaming and moping around and pounding because he doesn't get to drive the tank and he forgets to put gas in the tank because he's so distracted by what he's not and not paying attention to what he is [Applause] [Music] not a preacher i'm not a songly i'm not a singer i don't have super spiritual gifts amen forget about that don't pay attention to any of that be what you are start getting comfortable with the fact you're fearfully and wonderfully made he looked after your temperament he looked after your nature he got it all right he selected your parents all the way back for generations to get the right mix so that you can express a certain attribute of god quit worrying about what you're not and start focusing on what you are [Applause] we can't all do the same thing but when everybody gets in their place what a beautiful thing it is when it's running like clockwork and everything's just working the way it's supposed to be because everybody's operating the way they're supposed to operate the infantry men are good infantry men amen the artillery are good and accurate well the guy from the infantry says i'm sick of this i want to go fire the cannon amen and he doesn't know how to dial it in he can't even do his calculations right he doesn't understand geometry and all of a sudden he's lobbing mortars on his own guys that's what happens when somebody without a gift gets in the pulpit [Applause] because they're not built for it they're not made for it but we all got a place to be amen and when everybody gets in their place and gets happy in where god has put them then you're going to see a mighty marching army an invisible army not because we're the same but because we're different not because we have the same spiritual gifts because we have different spiritual gifts praise be to god i'm fearfully with reverence in awe and wonderfully to be distinct to be distinguished and separated that's how i'm made and i'm no longer going to complain about it i mean i i tell you i watch other men preach and i sit and marvel i'm like oh they're so good at that oh nobody can tell a story like that look how i'm like oh i wish i could do it that way i wish i was smoother that way i wish i could i'm done thinking those thoughts because i know where god's placed me and i know god has god made me amen i used to apologize because i read so many quotes amen i'm not apologizing anymore i'll read pages of quotes every service because that's how god made me and i know the way god made me and put me in this position amen will be the right the right ministry gift for the people that he gathers to this place this gift is matching these people in this place and i can't apologize for it anymore and i can't try to change it or wish it was different i'm absolutely satisfied with the way he made me if you watch my bald head for 10 minutes while i read a quote that's the way it's going to be because that's the way he made me and if i try to do anything different it's not going to work i've tried and it's failed we all have to get to that place i'm this and i'm comfortable being this this way i'm not trying to fashion after sister this or brother that because i've got them on a pedestal nobody should be on your pedestal brother brandon the prophet of the age he said if you love me call me brother but that was a brother with a powerful gift the gift was reverence the gift was lifted up but the man was a brethren we have to look at each other the same way we're brothers and sisters there's no categories there's no there's no stations one above the other there's offices and there could be an office one office over another office that's fine that's an office but the man is still a brother we've got to be careful that we keep a brother or brother in an office in office praise be to god let's go to jeremiah chapter 1. these things are so common i think we forget them i'd say it this way i told one brother this thought is simple but not simplistic it's not difficult but it's profound because we catch it in the right revelation it changes everything jeremiah 1 and 4 when the word of the lord came to me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee that probably only applies to jeremiah before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou comest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations god formed him to be a prophet to the nations before jeremiah had a chance to make a decision he was ordained to be a prophet to the nations and before jacob esau could make a decision or do good or bad and jacob have i loved esau have i hated and jeremiah was already given his job before he was formed in the mother's body let's read it again the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou cometh forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the nations jeremiah didn't get to pick his position he didn't get to pick what time he would be born on earth he didn't get to pick the gifts that would be him he didn't get to pick his physical characteristics and make up god picked it because god knew the job that he was going to do and he made him in in a way that he could do it jeremiah was called the weeping prophet he had a certain nature that god wanted to express in that day and he was made that way brother ben says in events made clear by prophecy god does his own choosing by predestination chooses the prophets for every age notice it he fixes the nature of that prophet to fit that age see he fits his style whatever he does he fits him whether he's educated or not educated he fits that gift the manner that he'll preach and the gifts he'll have and the message for that certain age god predestinated that certain thing to happen and there's not another thing can take its place care what it is how many man-made achievements nothing can take its place he's predestinated a man maybe an ignorant man he might have predestinated him another kind of man whatever he is he gives him his class his gift give him his nature his style and whatever it is how he expresses himself and whatever he does he makes the man of the hour to catch the people of the hour amen why because the man of the hour is going to have to catch a certain people of the hour and the people of the hour are going to have a certain characteristic i mean in that characteristic of the people of the hour it's only going to take that profit of the hour to catch that characteristic and the people of the hour so god makes him in the way to catch him his style the way he expresses himself the way he speaks his nature the things he likes that's probably only for prophets remember we're all sons and daughters of god oh praise be to god i don't when i say sons and daughters of god i don't want to get the wrong thinking either why because when jesus says i'm the son of god they went to stone him because him being a man made himself equal to god it wasn't just a son of god like something separate from god or something else other than god that's not the jews knew what he was saying when he's saying he's a son of god he made himself equal to god because the son of god comes from god's part of god connected to god is god expressed and so when we say we're sons of god we're not something separate from god something in addition to god uh something a different a different something else different than god it's the same thing it's god expressed in his attributes as sons and daughters of god it is god amen it is god expressed in this world that's sons and daughters of god we've got to stop thinking i'm a son of god like you're something different than god you're not anything different than god you are god portioned out in a little attribute and a little piece to have a certain expression that he labels his son so that it can be expressed in a certain way [Music] but what is that son of god what is that attribute of god it's god it's just a little piece amen it's just a portion but a portion of god is still god [Applause] that's why the scripture says the prophets were called gods little gods from the great god father is god sons are gods why it's the same thing same thing different expression right that should take the scare away that should take the fear away let's go to luke chapter 1 verse 11. i just want to keep laboring in this thought if you'll bear with me just want to stick with it for a little bit longer chapter 1 verse 11. what i mean it's simple but not simplistic it's not complicated but it's powerful i mean there come a time where peter realized that he was the son of god there came a time for peter when all the scare went away and the very authority that he was afraid of was the one that he'd faced down in the council the very one that he was running from during jesus trial peter could boldly and calmly talk to in his trial you realize what a revelation will do he caught who he was by the new birth he understood his position and he could stand there when they threatened him they they arrested him they threatened him they imprisoned him they brought him up to scare him he meant to try to threaten him and they said no longer preach in his name and he says you tell me is it better to obey god or better to a man he wasn't he wasn't trying to prove anything he wasn't defending himself he wasn't scared amen when the apostle paul began to give answers to felix amen when he began to answer the question that he wasn't trying to get out of prison paul was not trying to go free paul was trying to convert the one he's talking to when he got in front of the magistrate when he got in front of of the authority and the governor what did he do he preached the message he said you know what what have they got against you he says well i'm called here because of the resurrection and started preaching to them the resurrection of jesus christ he wasn't trying to make a case he wasn't trying to to manipulate any situation to go free amen he was just there because he wasn't afraid he was placed there by god all he had to do was speak the word and god was going to do what god was going to do we don't have to be afraid luke 1 11 and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing in the right side of the altar of incense and when zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell on him but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a sign and thou shalt call his name john and thou shall have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of israel shall be turned to the lord their god and he shall go before them in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord praise god he wasn't even conceived yet of john the baptist he wasn't even conceived yet but he was a portion of the word in the thoughts of god that had to be expressed in this dimension god had already ordained it he had already fashioned it he knew it was coming so when zacharias there gabriel the angel could come and tell him exactly what he would do the scripture he would fulfill and the very nature that he'd have of elijah john the baptist didn't get the pick because god picked when john the baptist was with him as an attribute and his thought before the foundation in the world it was already determined it was already decided now it was time to bring it out into manifestation and he could tell zechariah exactly what his name is going to be called what attributes you're going to have what portion of scripture is going to fulfill what nature he's going to have you think god didn't know about you you didn't think that you had the same position john the baptist that in the thoughts of god god knew you would come when you would come and what portion of his thinking that you would manifest in this life it's already determined he already knew we just have to get comfortable with that fact and we've got to believe it as truth [Applause] let it override every doubt let it override every question let it override every complex in every label that you've ever received let this truth override all of that brother bam said in super sign now i know you're going to remind me of what jesus said about if you can receive it this is elijah that was to come in that forgotten beatitude in matthew 11 6 when the disciple john after john like elijah woodsman lived in the woods a woman hater like elijah elijah condemning the women just as hard as he could by the way they were living and what did john do the same thing it's not lawful for you to have her the immoral woman the nature of that prophet the nature of that prophet wasn't his choice the nature of the prophet he loved the woods he loved to stay in the woods not because he wanted to love the woods do you understand he didn't decide one day to love the woods he was pre-programmed to love the woods too many people have tried to imitate brother branham and be a lover of the wilderness and lover of the woods and go hunting when it's not in their nature when the prophet did it i've got to do it he loved nature he saw god in nature i've got to go do the same thing that was his nature not your nature he didn't do it just because he wanted to he did it because he was pre-programmed to come in the spirit and nature of elijah and he was pre-programmed to love the woods and god put his parents together to get a nature in him that would love the woods and he made sure that his mother was half indian and that cherokee blood would come down through and he made sure there was enough irish blood in there to make him a fighter because he needed to be a fighter and enough cherokee blood to give him a woodsman because he needed to be a woodsman and he made sure the grandparents got the right spot and the parents got in the right spot why because he was putting in him a nature that he didn't choose but was already there because it fit the word of god and the portion that he had to fulfill of the word of god [Music] we're not imitating one another i don't have to be what brother branham was i'm not him he did his part i'm doing my part you don't have to be me and i don't have to be you we don't have to imitate anything we don't have to pretend [Applause] you don't have to go on a hike one day and you say oh if if i could just hear a bugle call amen it would do something to my heart because it did the brother bread you might hear a bugle call and it means nothing to you that doesn't make you not a child of god the bride is being liberated by the word of god we don't want imitation we don't want put on we want freedom to express the programming that came in our spiritual dna and god fashioned the flesh by bringing parents together to bring out a certain characteristic in your human flesh that would accent or be able to express the nature that was in the seed god worked hard to get it this way quit trying to undo all of his work hallelujah the nature of that prophet he loved the woods he stayed in the woods he came forth fearless he was against organization you generation of vipers who's warned you to flee the wrath to come for god's able these stones the right shield abraham he pulled no punches why did brother bradham go through so much time explaining how similar john and elijah was because that spirit of elijah had to come back five times and the fourth time it would arrive it would be in the prophet for this age and the characteristics that he had were pointing to his fulfillment of the scripture he wasn't putting on he didn't decide to love the woods because he read in the bible elijah loved the woods he didn't have to put nothing on you don't have to put nothing on you don't have to pretend anything don't pretend don't pretend to be spiritual don't pretend don't pretend to try to talk deep when you're not deep maybe you're not supposed to be deep don't try to be deep don't try to be spiritual don't try to be anything just be what god made you to be find that place in him where you're comfortable that you know that i'm his that he called me that i belong to him and i am what he wants me to be and get comfortable in that and get tuned in in the spirit where he can lead you the way he made you and quit feeling condemned because this one's so deep and when we when we preach on this i can't put it together and i can't ever explain it and maybe it's not your job to explain it it's only your job to believe it [Applause] don't try to explain don't try to be an intellectual don't don't try to be a super spiritual don't try anything just be what he made you to be and learn to get comfortable walking in the place he puts you in the body he puts you in in the place he puts you in if you only knew all these hard experiences i had who ordained the hard experiences if you only knew my childhood who ordained what parents you would be brought through if you only know what i've suffered through who ordained the suffering what's he trying to do he's trying to get his attribute to be expressed he's trying to fashion he's trying to mold he's trying to get everything in position to explain express himself hallelujah romans 9. romans 9 and 20. name but old man who art thou that replies against god shall the thing form say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel into honor and another unto dishonor what right do we have to say why'd you make me this way but we should be saying is god how do you want to use me this way and we can constantly go on our knees and pray god if there's anything that you don't want hanging over in my nature cut it out cut it out but one thing he's not going to do is change the very essence of how he made you that's going to remain the same brother says in the in the rapture now so were you if you got eternal life you were in god before there ever was a world you are part of a son of god an attribute of god he knowed the very age you were coming he predestinated you to that age what age are we coming you say brides age that's wonderful i'm coming the bride i was predestinated to be in the bride in the bright age but i was also predestined to come in the age of satan's eden the two take place at the same time so i was predestinated to be expressed in this age there is no deception there is no power of hell there is no demon influences there's no two hundred thousand thousand demons that's been released in this day that is going to stop the expression of god there's nothing to be afraid of because why he predestinated me to live in the age where two hundred thousand thousand demons has been released from the river euphrates and has left the the armies of hitler stalin and mussolini and now come into the ecclesiastical system to come after the bride i've been predestinated to live in this age so that means this age will not overcome me it means those two hundred thousand thousand demons in the ecclesiastical room will not overcome me why because he knew what age i would be in and he programmed me with my spiritual dna in this age to overcome these obstacles everything you're facing you're already programmed to overcome he'll put nothing more on you than you can bear what does that mean that means he already knows what you can bear because you're programmed pre-programmed to overcome certain things and he'll not allow the thing to come that you're not already programmed to overcome god orchestrates the events in our lives he's already got his program set he's already got his purpose declared and everything is moving according to his will that's why you can't say this is too much for you it's not too much for you because his word said it wouldn't be too much for you so if something comes on you and you get that overwhelming feeling this is too much i can't do it you got to drop back into another realm and go to the word of god says he'll put nothing more on you than you can bear that means he built me for this trial if somebody has to overcome that trial to express god and you say god not me then really what you're saying is god give it to my brother because somebody has to express that somebody has to get victory over that thing somebody has to express that attribute of god and if you're saying god not me you're saying god give it to somebody else yes instead of accepting what god has done and saying god give me wisdom give me your word let me express what you want expressed god we're going to have victory amen you're going to have victory through this vessel for your glory we have to have a greater confidence he preached destiny due to that age to take that place and no one else can take it i care how many impersonations and things you've got to be there because he knew you would be there now you were made manifest now you can fellowship with him and that's what he wants he longs for fellowship to be worshiped but if your life did not always was an attribute of god you're just a mimic of christianity there'll be millions and billions of them they'll just be mimics of christianity things that are to be just like your birth here i said you was prepared god knew you would be here did he know were you prepared then what are we scared of and now you know even things that your parents done people think that that isn't visited from generation to generation but it is further down he says you were you were all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance oh that's the thing we have to remember right in the middle of of a dreadful situation we got to go right back to this we were all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance with god he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight did you know that let's go to hebrews chapter 4. praise be to god i don't know about you but i'm feeling like my feet are on solid ground brother brown said the world's falling apart he said let it fall apart the condition of the world's not scaring me condition of the falling part of the world is not scary to me because we've been placed here for the falling apart of the world hebrews 4 3 for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world it's finished all the works of god were finished before the foundation of the world now it's just being manifested acted out but it's already been finished it's finished in the mind of god brother said god can't have a new thought jehovah jireh 1961 see we have to be what we are gifts and callings are without repentance when you were born in this world before the world ever began god knew you positionally placed you if that isn't so then the bible isn't so that's exactly you're not earning gifts 1964 the harvest time the potter as roman 8 tells us who can tell the potter can the clay say make me thus and thus see no god has to display all of his attributes and so he has to make one vessel of dishonor another one to honor to show that one up of course now but he is sovereign you see nobody can tell him what to do and he makes us different even we're told in the bible that the stars differ one from another one star difference from another you know there is you know there is a difference in heaven in angels angelic beings there is angels there is cherubims there are seraphims they're different they're differences there and we are all different and god has big mountains he has planes prairies grass desert water see he's different he's a god of variety and look at his people here this morning and some of us white some black some brown some yellow some red it's his people god doesn't want us to be the same we shouldn't want us to be the same and the message things that are to be he says jesus has gone to make ready are coming there notice in my father's house's many mansions or let us i don't mean to add to the word or take from it because we're not to do that he said in my father's house are many kinds of mansions i don't believe that when we get to heaven that we'll all just look alike just exactly alike i don't believe that we'll all be blondes or brunettes or are all big or all giants see what brother ram just said different kinds of mansions or abodes or dwelling places he says we're not all going to be the same we're not going to be blonde or brunette are little are giant this is just a reflection of that do you believe that this is just a negative reflection of the positive that's already there if that's true then that is already set so how are you going to change this if that's already set we just need to get the right influence to think the right thoughts to perform the right things he says i believe that god is a god of variety the world proves that he's got big mountains little mountains he's got planes he's got deserts he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it and he made the season summer winter spring on him he made the season it shows he's a god of variety he made you in a variety some men are real blusterous and some are real dogmatic and others are fine others are kind and you're just kind of all different kinds of people in his kingdom we think if i'm going to be in the kingdom of god i got to be just like brother so-and-so and be so pious and so quiet and so humble and me can hardly say anything peter wouldn't have made it amen don't let the devil lie to you anymore if god made you that way it's for a purpose [Music] look at saint peter and judge him by andrew andrew is that prayer warrior just staying on his knees all the time and the apostle peter was one of those firebrands that preached and so forth and paul was more scholarly more like like the prophet or something and set back now think about what he's saying this is profound what if peter thinks he should be like andrew i mean there's nothing wrong with being on your knees praying all the time there's a good attribute i like that that's a good thing to like and want but andrew was positionally placed to be a prayer warrior peter was positionally placed to be out front preaching do you get that if peter would have went and tried to do andrew's place he would have never succeeded and andrew would have never succeeded in peter's place and we could all say oh that andrew he prays hours and hours every day oh i'm just going to be like that if god didn't make you like that you'll never be successful like that you're just trying to imitate what god's given somebody else if god has called you to be a prayer warrior it will come natural that doesn't mean we don't pray we all pray we should spend time and pray we should set time aside to pray that's not what i'm saying but if god has called you to hours of intensive prayer and intercessory prayer it will come natural when you shed the things of the world and you quit thinking worldly thoughts and get tuned in with the spirit of god it'll be a natural outcropping of the way you're already programmed but to decide to be a prayer warrior is nonsense to decide to be a witnesser is nonsense brother so and so he's always witnessing to somebody standing in line goes to dinner with a stranger and next thing you know he broke the seals to him it's true right but then you try to do it and fall flat on your face and you make it worse been better if you just been quiet it's not your gift we've got to get comfortable with who we are we're not all witnesses we're not all preachers we're not all prayer warriors but some of us are prayer warriors some of us are preachers some of us are evangelistic some of us are witnesses some of us are caretakers some of us our job is just to care for the other sheep in the body just to give them care fix them a meal send them a card sometimes that's our job and if that's your job it'll be a natural expression of what god programmed into and if that's what god programmed into don't think that your job is littler than somebody else's job remember the guy putting the gas in the tank it's not littler than the guy driving the tank if we start to think that way then also we have a breakdown somewhere and the whole thing starts come crashing down because every joint must supply every joint must supply for the edification of the whole body if god's called me to be a caretaker i'm a caretaker if god's calling me to be an encourager i'm going to encourage her if whatever but it's got to come natural you're already programmed to do it and don't be dissatisfied with your portion don't be dissatisfied just get to the place where you say god help me to do the best of whatever you called me to do help me to do it unreserved help me to do it by your leading help me do it by the leading of your spirit not my mind but let your spirit lead me into what you want me to do and it's amazing different people with different gifts will catch different things there'll be people i'll talk to and they'll say did you catch that in the service when that changed and i'll be like i'm the pastor am i supposed to catch that and i didn't catch it it used to really bother me i'm like am i not spiritual some and two or three people will say did you catch that and i'd be like i missed it am i even a son of god but it's funny but the devil does that to all of us but there are some people who are spiritually sensitive but they're not good at other things there's some people who are not a spiritually sensitive and they're really good at other things you have gifts of administrations and helps wisdom knowledge they're not all supposed to be the same so the brother is super sensitive he said did you catch that in the service and when the other brother says no he doesn't go i did and brother so-and-so did because just a few days later this brother's going to do something that's going to save your hide because you'll miss it we have to have confidence in ourselves and we have to have confidence in one another we have to start saying that my that sister is really good at that i'm not good at that but i'm going to ask that sister if she can help me i know that sister spends hours a day praying i'm going to ask her to help me pray for this need this brother he's real sensitive i'm going to ask him a question that brother he's really good with the word he's really good at the details there's something i'm going to go ask that brother if we don't understand what god's doing we'll label somebody as not spiritual and somebody else is intellectual and somebody else is a fly by night well they're not grounded they're just spiritual they're just flipping well he's intellectual he's not spiritual see how dangerous that is [Applause] it's like saying you're just an infantryman but you're just in the supply chain you see what i'm saying we've got to have confidence in one another and we've got to be thankful that that brother's different than me and that sister's different than me because i need her and she needs me amen and i need him and he needs me because this is a body a body ministry a body of jesus christ that is called the bride that has to be on display fully functioning on display not just a minister and a pulpit but a body on earth and we've got to have confidence in one another and we've got to trust in the gifts that are in one another we have to have first confidence in ourselves and have faith in what god has done as us and then we have to have faith in what god has done in my brother and quit trying to evaluate and rate and i'm more spiritual and they're less spiritual and i i'm right and they're wrong stop all of that nonsense and let god do what god's done god has built his army and in his army everybody's got a place amen and i don't care if they're cooking i need to cook with no strength how are you gonna fight you need somebody who understands nutrition somebody who understands calorie count somebody who can get you through the next battle you understand you need somebody who understands logistics and gets the details you don't want your super spiritual person working on the details i tell you one thing right now if you're planning a camp don't get your super spiritual person to play in your camp because you won't have meals not everybody will have a bed but they just know that the lord will work it all out and they're right because the person who's detail-oriented with administration that gifts will see the failure and jump in and fix all their mistakes we laugh because it happens every day all around us it's taking place if we could just learn to trust it trust it and be thankful god made it that way i thank god this brother's wired that way and that sister is wired that way i'm thankful because that's what we need as a body god knew what he was doing he brought us together if he's ordained us to be here in this assembly as one body god knew each piece that had to be here and each piece has a specific place and a position and i'm thankful for all of them we've got to adjust our thinking and be so thankful for what god has done and thankful for a body not thankful for individuals i'm so glad that we got good preaching what good is good preaching if you don't have a sound system or even a church building because you have no trustees you don't have audio no audio visual people you see what i mean what if nobody claimed it some of you quit coming to church but you see what i mean it's not just one this and one that and this is the most important we've got to stop thinking like that let every joint supply freely so that we can be all that god's called us to be amen we're still in things that are to be god's the god of variety he's talking about andrew and peter andrew is that prayer warrior just stay on his knees all the time and apostle peter is one of those firebrands that preached and so forth and paul was more scholarly like like the prophet or something and set back and see moses wrote the first four books of the old which he wrote the old testament the rest of it was the laws and kings and psalms and so forth and what someone wrote of the prophets but moses wrote the laws the first four books of the bible genesis x's leviticus deuteronomy and then paul wrote the new testament that's true matthew mark luke and john were the acts of what taken place and so forth but paul separated the law in grace and put it into its place he was the writer of the new testament he gave us the writings of the new testament setting the word of god in order now notice many mansions many kinds of mansions like many kinds of hills like many kinds of rivers springs lakes they were here when you come here first because the kindness of your heavenly father placed them here because some men like mountains some like waters some like deserts and some like lime ohio i had to put that one in there amen good thing the beauty of the people is the k beauty of the church is the character of the people not the landscape around it you know you're coming he knew your nature what you would be so he made it just the way that you could enjoy it that's his natural creation he knew what you would be and what nature you'd have so he made his natural creation match what you would enjoy we weren't all supposed to enjoy the same thing he made plans for somebody to enjoy he made deserts for somebody enjoy he made mountains for somebody to enjoy he made lakes and oceans and water for somebody to enjoy he made prairies for somebody to enjoy do you understand he made it because he knew what characteristic that he would come in as children and they're not all supposed to be the same my wife she likes it where she can see forever i like to be in the holler in the midst of the trees all hidden in she likes to be up where she can see for we have two different likes but i like mine better but you can't fake it it's either there it's not and god created this world because of the nature we'd come with if he did that on the planet if he constructed this planet in a certain way and let volcanoes erupt here and glaciers move here just because his expressed attributes would like it one way or another if he could orchestrate the entire planet to match the nature of his children what about your daily life what about the things that are happening all around you they're all there for a reason god has something he wants to be expressed he says in the identified masterpiece of god from 64. he has a purpose in your life each individual can you believe that i mean really believe it like don't believe that each individual is important but believe this individual it's easy to say oh yeah every individual matters that's not what i'm asking you to believe i'm asking you to believe that this individual you yourself he's chosen me he's ordained me he's placed me i'm one of his attributes me as an individual is what he wants and he has a purpose in your life each individual that no one else on the face of the earth can take your place do you see why this matters so much it matters what we do it matters where we go it matters what assembly we're in i mean we don't just pick churches in the mini mighty mode because god has something to express through that individual and he has a place for that individual and we have to be led by god where's my place where do you want me where do you want this expression to fit into a body to bring greater life to the body he has a purpose in your life each individual no one else on the face either can take your place god has got something for you you're made like that you just did that way for a purpose god is sovereign in his work he thinks different we're different one from another notice in the animal life we find out the animal life there's one animal god made a beast of burden like the horse and he has to work and the cows are sacrificed and the lion and the tiger roams the forest without any labor or anything he made a great big animal like an elephant and he made a little bitty fella like a mouse now who is there to tell god what to do and how to do it he does it his own way and he makes the mountains he makes the deserts he makes the seas he makes the planes he makes one kind of tree a hardwood palm and so forth he does it he makes men different he gives us each one a different place and a palm tree can never be a hickory a hickory tree can never be a palm nobody can take your place and you shouldn't try to take anybody else's place because you are an individual to god and god has a purpose for you he made you thus why did he do it he is sovereign he's got a reason for it being that way but we find out that we're all guarded by the word in heaven we look at the celestial bodies the bible says that even one star differs from the other there is serious and different ones and mars and jupiter and all those different ones they differ one from the other the sun differs from the moon and the moon from the stars and there's angels such as their seraphims and cherubims and angels and great angels and degrees and even in the new world to come the kings of the earth bring their honor into the city we're always going to be that way we're always going to be that way do you know what that means when you get a body change you're still going to be that way brother ben said in the millennium we got work to do we're not just going to sit around we got works to do we got jobs to do well have you ever seen a work crew with everybody has the same job we're all hammering on the same nail doesn't work this is just a reflection of that [Music] god is not changing he's got a characteristic and a nature in you that's not going to change it's just going to come to a greater perfection it's not going to change greater perfection greater maturity more perfectly refined but not changed and when we go to the millennium we're going to recognize each other and each other's gifts and watch each other work in our gift because there's going to be a king on the throne that knows the way you're wired a king on the throne of david earthly king earthly throne that knows the way you're wired and knows what he built you for and knows what you're supposed to express and he's the one giving out the work assignments and when he hands you your work assignment something in you says oh i've always wanted to do this it's not work it's not labor it's not a drudgery it's not a punishment amen he's given you something that exactly matches the way he built you inside and when those two things come together you're like oh i'm so excited i can't wait to do it there's going to be no work assignment on that day says oh jesus do i have to why should we act that way now [Applause] if we're acting that way now maybe we haven't found our place yet maybe we need to pray and say god you've built me for a reason and there's a purpose in my life and you purposed it and you ordained for me to do certain works before the foundational world i'm here lord make me sensitive to your spirit reveal to me what you want me to do lord let me tune me into your program from my life and your purpose have your way have preeminence we're never going to get away from that word preeminence this is the season for full preeminence it affects everything cherubims and angels and great angels are all different we're always going to be that way because god is not a sears and roebuck harmony house he's a god of variety he makes one one way and one another but we must serve him in the way that god made us and be glad and stay behind his word and that's the way god did it letting off the pressure in 1963 now god created the creation is expressing himself back in creation and he's not a god just of one solid sears and roebuck harmony house he's a god of variety he makes big hills little hills he makes deserts he makes lakes he makes little trees big trees white flowers red flowers makes little men big men red-headed women black-headed women if you're little don't ask to be tall if you're tall don't ask to be little god knows what he's doing because he's the god of rhine and he makes some rich and some poor he makes some rich and some poor everybody's trying to get rich don't god's the only one who can make you rich he makes some rich some poor some in between but we got a place to serve god and that's the place that he's placed us in if we'll just abide in that place the prophet of god says according that he has chosen chosen us in him who done the choosing god did you didn't i didn't god did you haven't chosen me but i've chose you said jesus according he has chosen us in him chosen us the elected now the ones that's in christ jesus he chose us in him when yesterday the day before listen at the scriptures before the foundation of the world i'm surely not reading that wrong that's the way it reads here in the king james version god chose you in christ before the foundation of the world was ever laid then if god knew that what are you scared about if i could wrap up everything i've said into these last couple of minutes what are you scared about if you believe the things that we preach if you believe what the prophet said and you believe the preaching today what are you scared about if god knew way back before the foundation the world to choose you in christ and you come and accepted the call what you scared about if something in you heard the eagle scream and jumped up to meet it in the air and knew it was the truth amen what are you scared about you know you couldn't have recognized that was eagle food unless you heard from your theophany if you heard from the authority you have a theophany an eternal body in the heavens what are you scared about there's now no more fear i heard the eagle scream i knew what it was whatever it screamed resonated solid in my heart and i rose up to meet it in the air hey praise god there's nothing to be scared about first john 4 17 hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world this is how our love is made perfect because as he is in the world so are we there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us perfect love cast out all fear but you have to know that you love him because he first loved you and chose you and ordained you and fashioned you and placed you message gyrus and divine healing the prophet said perfect love cast out all fear love and faith is the same thing that's a big statement love and faith is the same thing see love perfect love cast out all fear which gives faith love and faith is the same thing that's why we can't say oh i love god i love god i love god but have no faith because if we really loved him because he first loved us if our love for him is a reciprocation of his love for us it drives out fear why because he first loved us when before the foundation of the world and nothing will defeat his love our purpose for us what are you scared about i want to say nothing can your flesh man your spirit realm get scared absolutely but there should be something inside that'll take control something in the watchtower that'll take control and say no there's nothing to be afraid of i will not let fear control me because by revelation i know that this trial was ordained by god and he's built me and positioned me and placed me to overcome this i've got to have confidence in what he's done can you have confidence in what he's done let's start acting like it had to quit being so timid the bride's not supposed to be timid she's supposed to be confident not arrogant confident no weapon formed against him shall prosper nothing shall happen that he didn't first approve and he didn't approve it for our destruction he approved it for our perfection nothing's out of kilter with god the clock's just ticking right on time all these things have to be this way you were ordained and placed in a certain body of flesh that he watched generations over to get it molded a certain way for a certain expression and he brought you forth in a certain time and placed in you a certain attribute of himself and we don't all get the same attribute and that attribute was ordained to be expressed in that flesh in this time under these conditions what are we scared about let that drive all fear out that's perfect love that's a realization of what he has done for me man let's all stand musicians if you don't care to come the prophet of god told us that when a chime builder a bell maker he wants to make these chimes he's got to mix the metals so much copper and or so much brass and so much ten and so much of this to get that certain thing and brother branham said he did that for you he said he bred this one to that one i mean this sounds like farming he bred this one to that one and this one to that one to get you just a certain way so that in his great symphony you've got that certain thing and you might ting all the time or you might ting occasionally but nobody else can play the note you ordain to play in the part you're ordained to play brother bam said like the great symphony amen you might stand there with that symbol and he which waits and he reads the sheet music and he waits the man waits and he waits and waits finally gets his part bang and that's the only thing he does but it's an instrumental part of the program and it was written in there by the conductor and somebody's got to do it [Music] and if god called us to do it let's do it with our whole heart if i if i'm just here for one specific thing and if i'm just here to do one little thing if i'm just here for this one little part in the body let's give our whole heart to it let's stay with the music let's stay with the program let's stay engaged with what everything else is happening so when it comes time we can bang oh that sounds good we've got to stay in our position don't get out of position don't don't get distracted by the world don't start playing around with worldly things and entertainment don't don't don't just get distracted and all of a sudden wednesday's not so good i'm tired and i'm a little too busy and don't get distracted now's the time to pay attention god put us here for a purpose to be conformed into this image of his dear son to play our part i say let's have faith in what he's done he said i have no faith in myself do you have faith in him if you have faith in him then you have faith in the place he puts you in the body he puts you with the nature he placed in you i hate myself don't say anything like that don't ever say that god made it the way he wants it i wish i was different don't ever say that you can say i wish i was more surrendered you said i wish i was more under his control i wish i was more sensitive to spirit you can say all of those things but don't say what the word doesn't say start to embrace what god's done and have faith in it and walk in faith and confidence i think so many times we don't express what god wants to express it's because we're timid because we don't have faith in the way he's made us how many times have you felt to say something but you held back and later you regretted it you knew you missed something how many times does that happen how many times have you felt to say something to somebody or encourage somebody or write to somebody and then a week or two later you find out that something happened to them and you knew you missed it what is it we don't have confidence in the way he made us that nature that he put on us if we're tuned into god and we're living for god it's a natural expression and when those things come we've got to start acting on them because they're here not for you they're here for the body we've got to start having faith in the way he's made us and act on those things when he moves you to write what he moves you to say when he moves you to visit just do it we're so timid because we got such a concept from the world that we're wrong and somehow can't be right and somehow there's something wrong with us that's not the what the word of god says we've got to get comfortable i say like this we got to get comfortable in the skin he's put us in not confidence in the flesh but confidence in god who orchestrated the flesh who gave you a certain nature to express a certain thing and start to believe that god can actually use you that that thought you had was actually inspiration of the holy ghost that that little desire you had to do that for that brother or give a gift or write a note or go visit somebody that little desire that you had was actually the holy ghost moving in your life you got to actually believe it and if you believe it and we all believe it and we all start operating by the leadership of god you're going to see a mighty marching army moving forward unstoppable and invincible because everything's turning everything's moving the way it should say relax everything's okay don't be scared and don't be afraid of making a mistake don't be afraid of making a mistake i'd rather make a mistake once in a while than do nothing i'd rather god i make a mistake and god have to correct me and put me back on track than to sit in my seat and never have done nothing for the lord let's be in motion and let god do something let god work with us according to our temperament according to our makeup according to the nature he gave us you've got a certain element a certain attribute that only you can express don't wait for somebody else to do it if the inspiration strikes you don't wait for somebody else to do it you're wired like nobody else is wired do you believe that accept it by faith and learn to operate in them let's pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this day we thank you for the words that you spoke to us lord and god my prayers is more than words it's more than a sermon lord but it becomes our life because this is the hour for full expression this is the hour for manifestation this is not the time to do things the way they were done before but this is a time for every joint to supply god help us to be what you've called us to be help us to be in the image you've called us to be in help us to display what you want us to display god i surrender to you and i ask that you would just do what only you can do god we give ourselves afresh to you and forgive us lord for the negative thoughts we've had of ourselves forgive us lord for downplaying or or trivializing something that you've done in us god i pray that you would move all your bride above the false notions above the wrong teaching knowing that you would move us all above the complexes that were placed in our lives and bring us into that full expression that you ordained before the foundation of the world help us to be tied in with you cut off from the world and the influences of the world and let us be tied into you to move by the moving of your spirit we ask it lord in jesus christ's name we love you god and we ask that you and move on your people as we go from here bless us lord as we go and come back later for the communion service let us come back with hearts prepared in order to receive from you lord to participate in the lord's supper recognizing and acknowledging what you've done for us and where you've placed us by that we give you glory
