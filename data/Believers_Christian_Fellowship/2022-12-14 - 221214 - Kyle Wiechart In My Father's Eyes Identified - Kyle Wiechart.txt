peace there's no peace that they can find but father you came our way and you are the one that gave us a hope you are the one that gave us a joy you were the one that gave us a peace Lord that passes

midst of Sorrow we have peace when there's turmoil all around us thank you Father what more could we say but thank you father come this evening I pray Lord I know I'm insufficient Lord take my

you and we thank you we commit this special time in your hands in Jesus name amen amen God bless you if you'd like to turn in your Bibles to first Samuel chapter 16 verse 6. everybody happy to be at church tonight amen thoughts and prayers are with a lot of people that sick I don't think I've seen so many people get sick at one time but that's okay God's still the same yesterday today and forever his word is just as stronger every day you just have to believe it but we're lifting up our brothers and sisters and people picking me up a little bit I'm not feeling the greatest myself I've had a headache all day so just a little attack that's all it is so it's all is well all is well so are you there first Samuel chapter 16 verse 6. and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on Iliad and said surely the Lord's anointed is before him but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looks upon the heart amen I want to read one more verse in first John chapter 3 verse 1. first John chapter 3 verse 1. says behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not amen may God add His blessings his word you may be seated this evening well God bless you I have a little thought on my heart and I pray that it's uh it's just a little inspiration I even was wrestling with it throughout the day saying Lord It's just seemingly a little too small tonight but I think God knows how to just give us that which we have need of and you never quite know where somebody's at you never quite know where what struggle they're going through you know we have a maturing bride so that means that we're in all levels of maturing in our process of growth and so we we bear with one another right but maybe just maybe we may need some of the mature ones may need to hear this at times as well so I was just uh just meditating on it throughout the day and it encouraged me though it's something I know yet it still encourages me to know uh when God speaks to me this way and so I'd like to bring a little thought to your mind I've titled It In My Father's Eyes In My Father's Eyes and this thought is coming as a result of a conversation that I had with a friend of mine about a month and a half ago I had a and met him in a coffee shop and he's a nice man good friend known him for a long long time began to ask me some questions and wanted to know if I could give his opinion give me his opinion on some of the business that he was running he knew I had owned some businesses and and I said sure and so after a while of talking you know I kind of could tell something was a little bit bothering him and he kept looking out the window and after a while I says you know I called his name and I said hey why are you still doing this and he said you know I've been thinking that for the last week he's about 67 years old he said I've been asking myself that for the last week why am I still doing this and he said you know what he said when I was a kid my dad made fun of me he said he always thought I had crazy ideas and I could have never accomplished any of these crazy ideas that I have he said you used to make fun of me all the time in front of my brothers he said he looked out the window he looked out the window and he said he said I guess I'm still just trying to please my dad and I thought my and his dad's dead his dad has been dead for years and here he is still striving through life trying to achieve something trying to find Merit or success or find approval from his natural death and it's still driving him today and then he looked at me says why do you do everything you do I said you framed the question right because the reality of it is we do most the things we do as we see ourselves in the eyes of God Alice better ouster when he spoke here that last time the news here he said as a man thinketh in his heart so is he and we began to realize that Jacob saw himself what he thought he was he manifested but when he got a new name change he could say this isn't the god of my father's this is my God and everything changed for him when he recognized his position in his father's eyes in the eyes of God it changed and so I would like to just continue in this thought because it's been kind of a moving thing for me because I realized that you know who we are it cannot be identified um by our brethren who we are cannot be identified by the church who we are must only come from God our Father you are not something because the pastor tells you something you're not something because your mother and your father tell you or something you're not something because the brothers and sisters that we fellowship with on a weekly basis tell you or something you are only what you know you are when your father declares to you who you are and I'd like to take that through the Bible because I find the same thing took place in Jesus's life took place in brother branham's life and it continues to be something that we have to come to our own conclusion in and I remember the first time that I had had my uh Ellie air Cali when she was first born I I had we had her at the hospital and they cleaned her up you know cleaned all the blood off of her and everything and I began to they'd let me come over and look at her and I'm looking at her and I'm looking at this little baby this little life and she was perfect she was all clean and she's cute and then I got down her close and I looked at her in the eyes and instantly you know that fatherly like something that I never understood what it was it's like oh wow this thing right here came from me and this thing that I'm looking at for the first time I would die for in a heartbeat I would do whatever it takes to protect and provide for this little thing though I just met you and it's just something that struck me and then it was after I began to look at her and hold my own daughter that it really put me into a desperation to find where did I come from and if you all remember it was about three months later I showed up in this church and uh because it created a desperation I knew that I had a little daughter that would be looking one of these days for the truth she'd have to know where she came from not in this natural life but in a spiritual journey and so and I didn't know where I came from so I needed I got desperate for God and when I got desperate for God he led me to this church and though I went through a few struggles and we all went through a little bumps in the road and a lot of things changed over the years I was still hearing the voice of my father declare who I was it was identifying me and it changed the way I talked it changed the way I walked it changed the way I viewed things it changed everything in my life and I think it changed everything in yours because we come into this world with a natural um perception of who we are and usually that for for a boy I would imagine is for a girl it comes a lot from your father your natural father how he views you how what he thinks of you it determines a lot of how you act in life and if I look back in my own natural birth with my own natural father I have a wonderful father I have a wonderful mother but they could not uh there was a lot of bad in me still too in my natural first birth there was nothing much to be proud of but I'll tell you one thing that I can find tremendous uh a tremendous amount of words of congratulations or thanks for and that's in my second birth when I recognized I had a father that was in heaven and I can brag on him all day long and it changed my walk it changed my perspective it changed everything in my life when I began to view my life through his eyes and not my own and not the people around me and far too often I find you know the world is in complete chaos they don't know if they're male they're female they don't know what they are from day to day they change they're in complete chaos and I was looking at some stats of a father and homes that have no father and it shocks you you should look at it the statistics of a home with the children that have no father an absentee father I believe it's like 65 percent of teen suicides come from a home without a father 93 of girls born in a home without a father will have a teenage pregnancy 92 percent of them will divorce in life uh 163 percent increase in having a baby before marriage I mean when you look at the lack of a father giving a home its identity and its children's identity all you see is chaos because that's the reality of it a father that can identify for his children who they are in their home who we are in God who we who this family and what this family is on Earth for and show at its direct purpose it goes into complete chaos and that's what we're seeing in the world around us but that's not so for us amen with this message came down and it was my father declaring I'm here to redeem my children I'm making my net self known to you and as I have identified myself and unveil myself I will unveil you at the exact same time you recognize that in the Bible that every time that God was identified as this is the word made flesh the word made flesh then identified them this is a daughter of Abraham she recognized me or those that could not recognize the word may flesh then he says when they say you do these things by Beyonce he said you are of your father the devil and his works you do do you recognize when the unveiling of God was unveiled before them those that could recognize this is the word made flesh he identified them as part of the same word and those that rejected this as the word made flesh he identified them as from their father the devil you see so you cannot peel back the unveil God unless you're going to unveil his children we are a part of this there is no separating us from this great mystery the seventh Angel's message was this that the mystery of God would be made known and this is the mystery of God being made known I look at at it every day we're being molded in shaped and expressing the very portion of the word that we've come here to fulfill so I'd like to just read some things if that's okay because I'm and I'll also say this that's one thing with the youth I never want to do and I always try not to do because I've seen a fallacy in this I find that there's an insecurity amongst many people that they always have to be a part of a group you ever notice this in the natural world you find there's groups everywhere they have to find okay I'm into this so I identify with this or I'm into this and identify with this but then that's one thing for the world but when the church has to get groups and we have to assemble ourselves and unite ourselves with a group so that we can feel secure there's something wrong I should not need to have a group around me to feel secure in my walk with the Lord I should not have to have the approval of my brother to know who I am in God I should be able to see through his eyes and know who I am in God and that's with my own daughter and my in even in the youth I don't tell them who they are I tell them what God says the elect of God are but God himself has to identify them I cannot do that the pastor brother Chad I don't care who stands here he can't tell you who you are he can tell you what the word says but you yourself have to hear from God himself that's who I I am until then you're just you're just a parrot you're just repeating what's been told you but it's not a rock of Revelation you can stand on and it will be tested and it will be tried but when God tells you who you are what can come against that that's what we want to hear I want to hear my father's voice say Kyle you are bone of my bone the Flesh of My Flesh life of my life power of my power that's what we want to hear I want to see what my father says about me and so I'd like to read this in and remember this keep this in mind in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so my father is the word so if I'm going to be identified my father is going to identify me by the word that's why brother Brandon preachers identified with those Bible characters can you find yourself in the book can you find yourself identified with your father the word if you can't you better get desperate before God which side of this identification are you on so he says in Smyrna Church age he says now then here are we coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifested in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest In the Flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn become the many membered spoken word seed manifested in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest In the Flesh of the sons of God that's a big statement right there is to be the fact is I it's my turn he had his turn now it's my turn now I am the word made flesh in this day now you're the word made flesh in this day that's what the word said you are now it's your portion to be fulfilled and I'm identified with that so therefore I walk differently it's my turn you ever say that you're like good job Paul good job Peter good job it's my turn I think there's an attitude in the bride it's like it's my turn you did good you did good Brothers my turn watch out here we go not in in arrogancy but it's a fact that God manifests himself in human beings now he said hold this carefully in mind now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death and a shed blood brought back his own he brought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my word and they follow me you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that's impossible for any kind of Life produces the same kind of Life same kind and there is no change in its species as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice his word and hearing his voice become aware of our father calling us and recognizing that we are the sons of God we heard his voice and we cried out as did The Prodigal Son oh oh Save Me O my father I'm returning to thee oh man I just I'll tell you what that gets me a little bit excited I'm sorry but reality of it was every one of us was groping in darkness until we heard the voice of God in our age and we didn't maybe we didn't realize it at first but this is my father identifying me as a Son of God you as a daughter of God not by association with the right people but by the voice of God that declares Who You Are it changed you walked differently now I want to bring in the little story and you all know this story quite well it's amnesia's story it's the soldier now he says the French soldier I was told and and I again remember there may be some that don't know this there's new in all stages so bear with us okay you bear with me we love one another a French shoulder I was told a little story before we close I didn't know it was this late I got about 10 pages here on these notes notice there was this French soldier they got a bunch of shoulders soldiers in the Army and they all had Amnesia it was from shock on the battle they had a program and they had called up and left left these people who were missing loved ones to call and see if they could identify any of these boys and no hope for them maybe one or two they caught it and then they just took the rest of them they'd put them out in a sanitarium and there they'd stay for the rest of their lives they were going up the hillside uh train was pulling and they stopped at the station let a few boys get out and stretch their legs and the guards got out on the hill and they began to watch him because you know with that Amnesia you have to watch him so they watched this one Young fella and he got out and began to look around at the water tank he looked all over the hill he rubbed his face and he studied it he looked all again and then he seen a water tank he looked all over the station he started walking and then instead of the Guard stopping him he just followed him he went up the hill and down a path and turned to the right and then over another Hill and he'd come to a little cabin he looked and coming out the porch was an old man with a cane in his hand he'd come out and he throwed his arms around him and he said my son I know you would return they told me you were dead but I knowed you would return and the boy came to himself his Amnesia came and left him because he could identify it again who he was he knowed who his father was o soldier of the Cross that's been shocked by so much training so many shocks of denomination and Creeds and the themes of this world why don't you just step off for a few minutes and get to looking in the Bible why don't you wander around a little bit you might find yourself identified here in the word as a Believer one of these days you might not know him you may come to know yourself like the prodigal son and find yourself for your identification is in the word of God amen that's where I was identified I wasn't identified for group Association I was identified when I could find myself in the story of Jacob how many found yourself in the story of Jacob I found myself in the story of Jacob I found myself trying to be a manly or man and make myself more hairy and trying to please everybody around me and be plea be something that I wasn't right you did too you know you found yourself identified there I found myself in the story of David I found myself in these stories I found myself in Abraham I'm not worthy that you should come to me Lord but I had to separate from all my Kindred you found yourself too I found myself there but see I found myself when I began to see myself in the word and my father was identifying me all the way through but you see there's such a Temptation along the way to identify with a group another band name even talks about this he warns about it and we'll get to that now I want you to turn your Bibles to Samuel a little story just take a little bit of a moment to look at this I found it quite entertaining first Samuel 16 we read the portion of it there in the beginning everybody okay with me just taking some time looking at some Bible verses it says in first Samuel 16 6 we read the first portion of it already it said it came to pass they were cut when they were come that he looked upon Iliad and said surely the Lord's anointed is before him but the Lord said unto Samuel look not upon his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as man seeth from Man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looks on the heart then Jesse called Abba dad and made him come to pass before Samuel and he said neither hath the Lord chosen this then Jesse made shama to pass by and he said neither hath the Lord chosen this again Jesse made Seven of his sons to pass before Samuel and Samuel said to unto Jesse the Lord hath not chosen these now think of it the next verse Samuel has to ask Jesse the father Samuel said and Jesse are here all thy children David wasn't even recognized as the son of David or of Jesse the father of David wouldn't even bring him forth and acknowledge Him but remember this is the eighth son the first seven sons were refused it was the eighth son that had the anointing it was the chosen son this was the chosen King the eighth one and through seven Church ages they were all refused because we've come to the bride age this is God's choosing this is the one whom the Lord hath anointed and this is the one whose real father stepped up and identified him God himself because his natural father could not identify David and he said their remaineth yet a youngest behold he keepeth the sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch for him for we will not sit down till he come hither I like that they can't rest God will not rest there is no rest because his finding his rest in me is where is the place of his dwelling in the place of his rest in The Bride of Jesus Christ the prophet can't rest until the bride comes on the scene and he sent and brought him in and he was ready and with all of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look upon and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he so he heard the word of his spiritual father and his spiritual father identified him when his natural father couldn't even recognize him couldn't even bring him before the prophet thought well this little fella he's and nothing nobody anyhow I'm so glad to be a part of a group of people that know there are nothing nobody's anyhow it was just a predestinated elected hand of God that brought you forth and anointed you as the eighth bride of Jesus Christ in the Eighth Day in the bride age here you stand so it really doesn't matter what natural perception I have in the eyes of people it matters what God says about me and let's continue to find this because you'll find out when God identified David David begins to identify with God now if you look at Samuel 17 23 we'll slide down to 23. first Samuel 17 23. and the men of Israel said have ye seen this man that has come up surely to defy Israel is he come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father Father's House free in Israel and David spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth the Philistine and take away the reproach of Israel for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the Living God and the people answered him with this saying so that it would it will be done to the man that killeth him now look who can't still recognize David and Elliot his eldest brother heard when he spoke unto the men and iliab's anger was kindled against David and he said why cometh thou down hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness I Know Thy pride and thy naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down down that thou might to see the battle he's making fun of him here's the eldest brother refusing and jealous of his own youngest brother whom the Lord hath anointed remember he refused eliab and Elliot looked pretty good he was so good looking that the prophet Samuel almost thought this surely has to be the one but God refused him because God wasn't looking out the outside he was looking at Faith on the inside God recognized the heart of Faith he knew where he would find his chosen vessel and he wasn't look on an outward appearance it didn't matter and so then David Dave look at David's response and David said what have I done now what I do Elliot what am I doing the the elect of God is always persecuted because they've the other brothers have been passed up jealousy it's always been jealousy they're jealous of the anointing of the Lord upon Little David a little nobody but the anointing of the Lord was upon him and his brothers refused him couldn't recognize it and made fun of him all the way but it didn't phase David David wasn't like oh yeah okay yep Elliot yep I'm naughty I'm nothing I know it I I'll go home no he said where's that unfilled uncircumcised Philistine get out of my way the anointing the Lord's upon me and I'm gonna cut off his head this is the attitude of the elect of God when the anointing the Lord's upon him he's bold with the word when it comes to the word of God he's as bold as a lion don't cross him in that red you can call him a ready fella nothing no good yeah he'll agree yeah outwardly I'm nothing but on the inside I take a hold of that word of God with everything in me I believe it see God's looking on the inside now let's slide down and you'll see the attitude of David and you'll find out he's so much not like his brothers and David said in verse 45 and then said David to his Philistines thou cometh to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts and the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defied and this day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand and I will smite thee and I will take thy head from thee and I will give it give the carcasses of the host to the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth and to all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with a sword or with the spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands do you think that when David was identified by Samuel and anointed that he believed him he sure did because this wasn't talking that none of the other sons of Jesse could talk like this man and I had I had talked to the kids this last couple weeks because I realized the RSA that the the attitude of your tongue changes when you mature as a son did you notice that when David you look at all the Bible characters as they began to mature in the Lord and God begins to deal with him and they begin to be anointed and fulfilled the word they talk differently they act differently they don't talk like a child anymore they talk like a full-grown adult they when I was a child I thought as a child I I I spoke as a child but when I became a man I put aside these childish thoughts and I started talking like a man I started talking like God would talk I started talking like the word would say a thing you notice that so there's a maturing to the tongue when there's a maturing of the vessel the best way to know the maturity of the individual is watch what they talk about for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks so watch what you say the power of life and death is there so if you're maturing as the Son of God you'll start to be able to notice it there'll be a little signal watch what you talk about see what you say about one another see if we can recognize God in the body of his Believers we're all make mistakes news flash you're not a perfect people quotation marks brother banham we are not a perfect people we make big mistakes but when we do we recognize them we confess them and we keep get up and we keep going by The Vamps okay we make mistakes but we get up we keep going we encourage one another let's go Brother come on let's go let's talk like a brother let's talk like the son of God and so uh let's just keep going here now dropping down some more into first Samuel 17 54. now we recognize David's not talking like the son of Jesse David's talking like a Son of God now David in verse 54 David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem but he put his armor in his tent and when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine he said over to Abner the captain of the host Abner whose son is this youth and Abner said as thy Soul liveth King I don't know you just imagine it's always like where'd this fella come from I mean who who's his daddy I have no idea because we've never seen anything like this guys this is a strange individual it's just come it's comical I mean he really you think about it I I thought it was entertaining myself I could just see them it's like where'd this fella come from you know we got to identify as father and when they go to identify his father he says uh they said the king said hey go inquire of whose son is this young man stripping this young man and David returned the slaughter of Israel Philistine Abner took him brought him to Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand and Saul said unto him who's on Art Thou this thou young man David answered I'm a son of the servant Jesse of Bethany height so there was a great mystery that was being unfolded because this guy wasn't acting wasn't talking wasn't doing anything like the other seven sons of Jesse this son this eighth son this anointed one taught totally different and he backed up his words with action I mean this is a unique situation so see how Revelation and the word of God spoken over your life changes you yeah it changes the way you talk change is where you go changes your attitude changes how you view obstacles in life you don't say oh whoa it's me you say okay where's the where's the where's that Philistine well let me get my sword real quick hold on you see it ought to change the way we act in life still okay you're too quiet it's too quiet it's okay so now I want you to look at something now in the uh life of Jesus there was a problem we recognized in the life of Jesus and it was in the ability of the his mother Mary unable to properly identify him because your identity won't come from the church identity comes from the word you remember a few weeks ago brother Chad and he nailed it and so I apologize almost everything that I wanted to say has been preached in the last six seven term sermons it gets to the point you're like what am I going to say anymore and so brother Chad had said we are not bcfans remember the statement and I sat there I'm like man now I can't even preach on that dude you already said that too but the reality of it is there is an insecurity in people by Nature you're two-thirds the devil to begin with let me just identify something for you you're two-thirds the devil you have insecurities in you you have scars you have little complexes you were born with and I'll tell you what you're going to try to do your old carnal flesh and nature is going to try to find security in somebody some group some church some Doctrine some Creed some some philosophy something it's your human nature to do that but the soul of a sea Gene of God says I can only be comforted and wrapped in his word that's the only thing that I can find security in is what my father said about me that's my place of security my security isn't being identified as a bcfid my security comes from I've identified myself in the word of God amen he spoke to me and I find myself in the pages of the book and so we look at this in Luke chapters 2 that Mary it says in Luke 2 46. and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and his answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou why hast thou thus dealt with us Behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrow and he said unto them how is it that thou has sought me whis thee not that I must be about my father's business see the word correcting the air she misidentified him she he was not the son of Joseph he was the son of God and he was doing what he was supposed to be doing he was about his father's business now brother Branham brings this up in Shalom and it's very interesting he says now as a 12 year old boy he said I'm about my father's business he rebuked her that's that isn't my father see the church today is carried about with counsels and all kinds of the things of the world she's been blacked out and God is rebuking her never did Jesus ever call her mother one day she came to visit him at the meetings in the house something like this someone said outside the door there's your mother and your brothers he said who is my mother and who are my brothers who are they looked around at his disciples and said they that do the will of God are my father and my mother and my brother see that's who it is and at the cross when he was dying he looked over at John that young disciple he said behold thy mother woman Behold thy son behold son Behold thy mother see never claimed himself it wasn't her son it was God's son she was just the womb listen this is a house this morning this is not a church the church is in you it's Christ and the spirit of The Mortals that are sitting here we've met together today in Heavenly places it's Christ not in this house this building this church the house is all right it is serving its purpose but it's only used for this meeting place Mary was was the only was only a womb that he had used to come to the Earth to be identified himself amongst the people not the mother of God no more than a house is the Church of God it's just used for that see Mary misidentified him the church will always misidentify you you can't get your identity from the church but your father passed to give you an identity now we continue to look at this now he couldn't even walk being identified by his own family the Bible says in John 3 or 7 3 his Brethren therefore sending him departments and go up into Judea that thy disciples Also may see the works that thou doest for there is no man that doeth anything in secret and he himself seek it to be known openly if thou do these things show thyself to the world for neither did his Brethren believe in him so Jesus wasn't walking through the world with his mom correctly identifying him his brothers couldn't correctly identified with him who he was growing up with and spending every day with they couldn't recognize who he was so he couldn't walk with their identification even the Devil Couldn't identify him he said if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bricks or into bread right if thou being if thou be a son and he kept identifying himself with the one who identified him the word it is written see the word identifies the word and vice versa the word identifies the word and the word identifies the word it's a very unique thought so then he begins to only identify with the thing that identified him the word see it didn't matter it didn't matter who recognized who he was it only recognized that he himself knew who he was you know that brother bam said he knew who he was Jesus in Matthew 26 or Matthew 3 16 it says when Jesus was baptized straight way up out of water Lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like the dove enlightening upon him and lo a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased so his father the word identified him so Jesus knowing who he was because I'm bringing this to you you know that right that's the obvious course of action 1965 the Easter seal so Jesus so full of the quickening power said if you can destroy this Temple that took you 40 years you thought to build I'll raise it up in three days why how could Jesus say that want to ask you why could Jesus say a thing like that he knew who he was I wish I could make that stick he knew who he was he knew that every word that God had wrote in there of him he had fulfilled it and he knew that he was the one that David spoke of do you know you're the ones the Bible speaks of do you know your position in Christ if you're in Christ you're a new creature do you know this word is just like everyday living for you why sure it's yours you're an eagle that's your food we shouldn't be shocked by that we should say absolutely that's exactly right this word is just everyday living for me the manifestation of God in my life it's just everyday Living For Me God's speaking to me through a brother when we have coffee in the coming and same thing when we have church that night through the pastor that's just everyday living for me you see he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's with me wherever I go because wherever I go he's with me I'm dwell he's the I'm the dwelling place of almighty God it should be just common everyday living for us to see that he's the same yesterday today and forever in our lives why do we stumble at that sometimes why are we critical of that we should be the happiest people in this world we should have most confidence and most security of anybody that has ever walked this Earth You know through seven Church ages they couldn't have this kind of security but this the last age this bride has a security that no other age had had nobody exactly knew who they were a mighty Angel comes down breaks the Seven Seals opens the book shows you exactly who he where he's been and what he's been doing identifies this group as the false Church identifies this group as the Bride of Jesus Christ identifies this identifies this identifies this identifies this you see when he's unveiled he's identifying everybody else when you identify the word he identifies you that's just the way it goes you recognize him he'll recognize you and so that's what's happening in this day and it's bringing a proper identity so Christ is the mystery of God still okay I'll go faster I'm sorry I'll go faster so in the Easter seal oh sorry in Christ The Mystery of God now notice God's making himself no not we're all we're not supposed to make converts through Christianity through governments no it's by Revelation that Christ is in you and God was in Christ as God was in Christ Christ is in you and what God did in Christ Christ now does in you what signs did God in Christ do Christ does he does now in you oh isn't that so beautiful I like that Jesus said at that day and that is this day the revelation will be named known you will know that I am in the father and the father is in me and I am in you and you are in me when the Revelation is made manifest that's flesh at that day you shall know that I am in the Father the father and I are one and I am in the father and the father is in me then when the Revelation comes forth It's I and you and you in me there you are see the manifold the threefold manifestation it will bring it back everything's great when we just talk about certain things but when I began to say you know your God to this world when you recognize that the dwelling place of God is you and all you can see is all your mistakes here's the problem we can recognize God in that brother and in that sister and I can see God in that one and I can see God in that one but it's really hard to see the god that looks at me in the mirror that's a really one it's hard to recognize him face to face you look at that one and all you see is your mistakes all you see is what you've been identified through a natural birth with all your failures and your insecurities and all your mistakes that's what you see and that's what's really hard to recognize but you will have to recognize it a certain day when the mystery of the revelation of God is totally unveiled the mystery of God's unveiled you'll find out that I am in the father and the father is in me and then it's not so hard to believe that we talk the way we do we act the way we do and we look at the obstacles in life the way we do but it's hard to recognize it in ourselves so Christ The Mystery of God he says now see it goes right over them and they won't recognize it until it's gone but it will pick up a predestinated seed God's predestinated from before the foundation Rule and the same thing come through in the days of Noah the same thing came through in the days of Moses same in the Days of Elijah and in the prophets and in the days of Jesus now on down through to this very hour the pregnated person with the seed of God the word in there it's manifesting itself so surrendered to the will of God or to the will of God that the word and the word alone will manifest in the person The Prisoner the individual they'll not say my church no the church has nothing to do with it see it's individual the one person and all hell is against that teaching all hell is against that truth but that is the truth see Jesus never said now Peter you and John and all the rest of you people see you all got the Revelation see now the whole church is safe no it was to him personally I say unto thee not them thee Thou Art p leader and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the word Peter means a little Stone a confessed one or a separated one see so praise God I love coming to church with you I sure do and I appreciate your lives and I appreciate everything you've done but your view of me does not dictate whether or not I'm going to serve God because Jesus wasn't recognized by his Brethren his mother couldn't identify him properly the Devil Couldn't exactly figure him out either but he knew who he was because God had identified him as a Son of God and he found himself in the pages of the book and he acted like it talk like it and live like it he knew who he was and what portion of the word he was on this Earth to fulfill it was his turn now it's mine you see it's not about just going to church it's not about just hey that was a good sermon no I gotta unveil me this word this message has to peel back the mystery of my life so I can find myself in the mystery when the mighty angel came down with an open book and it was signified as a cloud over there in Arizona and remember what happened brother Brandon was caught up into the mystery when he saw the head of God now when seeing the head of Christ brother banham saw one kind of interesting to him one that little that one there to the right of him boy that one seemed a little something to me who was it the seventh angel so he was a part of the mystery and so now the part of Christ the bride she's got to be unveiled I'm part of the mystery you're part of the mystery see but it does not matter the obstacles around us are what people will think of us don't be distracted by that that has nothing to do with it what God said about you that has everything to do with it yeah that has everything to do with it and so as we continue on spiritual amnesia you see what happened they just couldn't identify themselves with the word no more see she doesn't know whether she is a church or a lodge or she doesn't know whether she's a lodge or she's just a church she doesn't want to be called a lodge and she certainly can't be called the church because to be called a church she'd have to identify herself with Christ and that give that gives her a spiritual Amnesia she doesn't want to be called a lodge so it ain't the Pentecostal Church the Methodist Church or the Baptist Church it's the Pentecostal Lodge Methodist Lodge and the Baptist Lodge see because she can't be identified with the word and when the word is made manifest flesh they still don't believe it it's a disease it's a spiritual Amnesia people can't identify themselves they don't know where they belong that's right it's just exactly like high breeding something I've often said one of the dumbest things I ever seen was a mule he's a hybrid his mother's a mayor and his daddy's a donkey and he don't even know where he belongs and the first thing you know you breed him back and you and you get a donkey and then or you get a meal and the mule can't breed itself back so he don't he just you can't teach him nothing he's hard-headed you'll never to be able to tell him anything you can sit there he can sit there with his big old long ears and wait till the longest day of his life just before he dies and kick you that's a that's a rotten donkey that's all he's always waiting for something to bust it in on you now that's a hybridized Christian always hard-headed can't teach him nothing won't humble himself to the word stubbornism you can't accept the word of God or what word of God tells him about him just looking to bust it out on somebody else let me get my hands on somebody I'll bust him a real good one when I get a chance sounds like a hybrid Christian that don't sound like a son and daughter of God does it see a son and daughter like then brother bam goes in talking do I have it I don't know if I have it starts talking about that thoroughbred horse he said oh he's gentle oh my you can teach him you can train him my he knows who his mama is he knows who his papa is he knows who his Grand papa is he can trace his line all the way back he's a thoroughbred horse he said just like a thoroughbred Christian he can trace his lineage all the way back through the Bible back to God he's his gentle calm you can teach him training he knows who he is that's the identification I want I know who I can I know who I am I'm trainable I'm moldable unbreakable if I need to be so the seed is not air with the shut it's okay all right I know it's Wednesday night I'll wrap it up but when you come to say now this is the kicker uh now when you come to say I and my father are one and these other things then the shock pulls away from it but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God in its fullness and in its strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever notice the womb of Mary was the seed in the womb of Mary was the sea but when the seed was delivered it said I have come to do the will of him that sent me I and my father are one if I do not his Works believe me not there was the sea which one of you condemn me for unbelief and what what part of the Bible has been promised that I do that I haven't done God has verified it through me he said who can tell me but see the seed in Mary the shuck it was close to being that but it wasn't it was still in the womb notice at the Pentecostal age through the Lutheran age and through the Wesleyan age it's been the same thing all the way through to this Pentecostal age now know notice but the opening of The Seven Seals in Revelations 10 and the full word being born into a manifestation again and it was Vindicated by the spirit of God in its full strength here upon the Earth manifested here in the same way it's doing the same things here on Earth you see it it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever do you see it that's my question have you seen it Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever fully manifested manifested is to be made flesh God veiled in human flesh again Discerning the thoughts and the intents of your own heart I had a conversation with a brother a while ago about a month ago when brother Jean Kadima and I told him in my heart it's burning I says it's like I just Abba Father Abba Father I want to preach on it and then we got to talk and we talked for an hour almost an entire hour and just sharing what what was stirring in my heart brother John Kadima comes up that night and this opening scripture is Galatians 4 and Abba Father and he preaches everything we talk about that morning who is this in our midst is what is going on do you notice it's not a public show do you notice how calm and quiet these things are do you notice there's not a lot of screaming and shouting in the public running in to see something but it's still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Discerning and identifying what you're talking about in your home what you have a cup of coffee with a brother over here on this side who is this in our midst but see it's just as calm and settled as can be will the bride have a great ministry yes but it'll be so humble it'll be so humble people won't even realize it it won't be screaming and shouting in the public coming from all places to see a skeptical or spectacle no you know after the resurrection when Jesus came back on the scene he went to people privately if what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is where God himself is individually coming to you meeting you when you're discouraged out like Peter fishing by the seashore he comes to you in your place of discouragement and begins to talk to you and you read this in the Bible and then the brother says this to you when you call him and then the minister preaches on the same thing that you have need of that day who is this is this the Mighty God unveil it is the Mighty God unveil he's here he's doing the same things that he did then doesn't that declare him to be the same yesterday today and forever he is he's here but see how quiet and personal and private it is now it's in silence not a lot of screaming shouting and Gathering everybody in no he's meeting you quietly in the secret of your own prayer life of your own devotion and walk with him he comes to you here he comes to you here it comes to you here so shocking now but see so humble so simple um where am I hmm okay we'll just jump here because I don't know this one looks like a good spot now to be a true Christian you have to be the same you don't want to forget about it I'm identified with him I'm identified with him notice as he is in me I'm in him notice every Christian that's a real genuine Christian and uh was with him then when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God were shouting for Joy there before the foundations of the world we were identified in the immortal Realms with God 10 million years before the world was ever formed I was back there with him if I've got eternal life I was there with him I was identified with him I was there when the morning stars were singing together and the sons of God were shouting for Joy I was with him when he called Abraham at the age of 70 and his wife being 65 and told him they were going to have a baby I was with him when he took a stand on thus saith the Lord I'm going to have this baby have you said the same thing I'm old I'm not worthy of it but I'm bringing forth this word this word's coming forth in me have you identified yourself in the same way Abraham had did Abraham did Elohim turned his back and to discerned the thoughts that were in Sarah's heart did he discern the thoughts in your heart sure he is I'm identified with him this is the same thing it's it's our turn I stood with him every other Christian stood with him I was there when he had his Temptations I was with him when he was on top of the mountain up there to offer Isaac and the ram appeared I was with Joseph when he was rejected of his Brethren because see he was spiritual and all the rest of them was carnal I was with him when he knowed the reproach he had to stand by his own Brothers what he was I am and what I am he was for We Are All One in Christ Jesus I was with Joseph in his cave in his grave I was with him when he was at the right hand of pharaoh you have to be identified with him I was with Jacob that night that he wrestled all night with the angel you see I wrestled myself I know that what he went through through with so I've wrestled it with Jacob the same as he did for I am his brother uh you have to be it's in the Bible for us to do so so you see I'm identified you're identified I'm wrestling it out with Jacob anybody wrestling I've been wrestling it out there's some things in me I don't like and I need to hear from God and God himself has to clearly identify me and I may I want to walk different from this place on I I want to come and I want him to touch me I could never walk the same you see there's a reason why we're finding ourselves identified in these scriptures there's a reason why brother Allison when he preach and our hearts were burning within us as he started picking up the stories of the Bible and taking that which was in the past and bringing into the president because this is the coming of the Lord I will visit you according to the time of life he told Abraham and what happened Sarah brought forth a child so who was it God where in the woman in the womb of the woman here she came so where is God today in his second coming in the womb of the woman not the womb but that which is in the woman this flesh and this shuck it's giving way to give birth to the life that's on the inside you see what I'm saying so we're identified the mystery of God is being made known now transforming he can Trent he can transform us through his word and that we can rest upon because we are a part of it and now there's many things in my natural birth in my natural birth that I cannot brag on and I'll tell you I ain't got nothing to braggle my mother was a sinner to begin with and my father was a sinner we're a bunch of Cutthroats and gunfighters and most of them died with their boots on a bunch of drunks and bootleggers and everything else out of Kentucky my mother was a half Indian and I ain't got nothing to brag on I can't brag on any of my family tree amen I can identify but glory to God there is one thing that I can brag on and that's my second birth which came from Jesus Christ I can brag on that parent he is my father he is my savior he is my redeemer I can brag on everything that he was for he done it for me because now I have become his son I am no more a son of Charles Branham I'm a son of Jesus Christ that's right I can brag on my birth now I can't brag on my first there's nothing I'm ashamed of that one but I can brag on my second and I I and I will brag on my second you see I've been washed by the washing of his word amen I can brag on my second my natural life before the Lord pretty rough pretty messed up nothing to brag on nothing to look at a mess I'm so glad he came to me I heard his voice and I came walking I came on a journey with him and I'm still on a journey with him until one day these atoms change and I'm out of here I'm out of here I'm going to keep on walking this journey remember Enoch had three stages of his journey you ever think of that he picked up at the birth of Methuselah I just wonder it's just me I'm weird he picks up his son Methuselah the Bible says at the birth of Methuselah he begins to walk with God I wonder if he picked up his son and looked into his eyes and said now you know you came from me but I wonder where I came from I just wonder because it was at the birth of his son Methuselah began to walk with God see there was something that happened when he could hold his own son in his hands and he was thinking now I'm a father to you but who's my father Where'd I come from and where am I going who am I then he began to walk with God and in that Journey he walked for some time and then he took one more Step In the Journey that third step and that third step took him from one dimension to another that's the one I'm looking forward to musicians we come amen get you home early there's a lot of sick people at home maybe you got to get home and take care of somebody but why don't you turn in your Bibles to First John 3 1. we read the first portion of this at the opening we'll read both portions of it here at the end first John 3 1. it says beloved what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is amen don't be shocked if the world doesn't recognize who you are it's okay they didn't even recognize Jesus his own family his own mother I did this didn't identify him don't worry it didn't matter you're identified by the word the word is your identification that's your father that's the one you walk in confidence to I just want to please him the word that's the one I'm looking to please that's the one I'm looking remember the composer he didn't he didn't care if he heard booze or cheers when he was playing his composition on the piano he had his eyes on his master just wanted to see what did his master think did he find approval in the eyes of his master that's the one that we want to have we find approval in the eyes of God not what brothers not what churches think about us it's what God thinks about us will you stand for a moment I don't know who that was all for I really don't I I I I just I just go by inspiration and and if he doesn't lead me in a different direction I have no options I just don't I don't have the ability that others do I wish I could teach I wish I could break things down I don't I just get inspiration something starts to come and move me and I go to scripture in this scripture and this and then I just say well Lord you know I don't know I have never had confidence in me and I still don't have confidence in me in fact the older I get the less confidence I have in me so I was talking to a brother Oswald you know brother Oscar and uh Malawi yesterday and it was so interesting he told me he said he said he had a I got about blinded you know maybe six seven years ago I don't remember if you know that and he said you know brother it's been tough God hasn't brought my healing right away I I labor with this year after year after year he said but you know the Lord used me to bring more souls in the last six years with this eye injury than I ever did with both eyes working good he said I've LED multiple people to the Lord just on the trips to go to the doctor and he was just tell me just in the last week he led some very big panic I don't know what it was the nominational Theologian who asked him a question what is the godhead and he just sat there and broke it down for him and he said I want to be baptized the way you say it needs to be baptized and he says so God's using me in my weakness I said ain't it something I wonder how strong the Bride of Jesus Christ gets at the end I wonder if she realizes she gets weaker and weaker but God gets stronger and stronger he begins to perform things in her weakness that she can never do in her strength just like David it was when David was ready he took out the Goliath so maybe it's maybe don't worry about how strong we are I said Lord just make me weaker just get me weaker get me more broken so I can just do your will and I was just just so encouraged in that and so let's just bow our heads for a word of Prayer most gracious Heavenly Father again thank you Lord to be able to see ourselves in the pages of the book to see that this isn't a mystery just made known to us it's a mystery that's made known in US father it's it's just it's shocking Lord I just I want to walk in it more with a more clearness in my mind and in my life I want to understand that even more every day I want it to that Revelation to so grit me that I I can't talk the way I used to I can't walk I can't pursue anything because I I know now who my father is he had clearly identified me as a Son of God father that's my prayer for each and every one of us both young and old no matter where they are who they are may they recognize this isn't just a a group of ideas or doctrines spoken by a by a prophet or from a man from Kentucky oh this is the Mighty God came down identified before us Lord you led the wise men by a star that star led the wise men to the word made manifested word made flesh father we have seen his star we've seen your prophet and we've recognized and followed that star to a literal life of Jesus Christ father now we're just Desiring to see it expressed in Us manifested in everything that we do and say more and more each and every day father help us forgive us Lord for those things we do wrong we make big mistakes father Lord forgive us we don't mean to we don't want to do those things may we lord walk with a better understanding as we are maturing we're no longer children we're becoming adults a mature bride father may it take control of our thoughts it can take control of our words may we start talking like David who is this uncircumcised Philistine may we talk like Jesus it is written it is written it is written then the Devil comes to tempt us and bring distractions on our way we just say what the word said we don't say anything but the word because the word has identified us now we're identified with it father we love you we thank you for your word we thank you for your presence amongst us not just at church but everywhere we go whether we're sitting having a cup of coffee with our wife talking with our children getting our hair cut talking with our Barber Lord you're here in our midst and we so appreciate that you haven't went unrecognized father so father we just ask your blessings upon us as we go home Lord be with our sick ones that are all around father this young people so many sick but father you paid for our our sickness it's it's all we're already healed father Lord we are people that have faith we believe that you're strengthful make them strong and you'll raise them up quickly father and they'll just come with a testimony I was looking at the word and I believe the word and I got better and Lord we so thank you for that you're a loving father father be with our brother Chad sister Angie and the family watch over them keep them safe Lord may they have a wonderful time may your angels be encamped
