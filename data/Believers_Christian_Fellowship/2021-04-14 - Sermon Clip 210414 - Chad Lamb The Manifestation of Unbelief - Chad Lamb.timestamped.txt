[0:00] christ-like ripeness is not
[0:03] only understanding a revelation of the
[0:06] mysteries of god
[0:07] but the revelation of the mysteries of
[0:09] god should produce something in our
[0:11] lives
[0:13] not an intellectual with an
[0:14] intellectualism so that we know
[0:16] something that's debatable
[0:17] we can debate and know something more
[0:19] than somebody else
[0:20] that's not the reason that he tore the
[0:22] seals off he meant so that he could show
[0:24] us
[0:24] the great mystery of god but he gave us
[0:27] the revelation of his great mystery
[0:29] because the revelation was to produce
[0:31] something
[0:33] and what was that revelation amen it was
[0:35] the rising of the sun amen
[0:37] and the rising of the sun was here to
[0:39] bake all the greenness all the
[0:41] immaturity out
[0:42] so that we can bake into the likeness of
[0:44] jesus christ
[0:45] as mature seed and so the revelation
[0:50] amen the predestination the revelation
[0:52] of our position with god
[0:54] coming from god returning to god being
[0:56] seated in heavenly places the election
[0:58] of the bride the calling out of the
[1:00] bride the bride at the end time
[1:01] all of these revelations should produce
[1:04] something in us
[1:05] and it shouldn't have us running around
[1:06] saying god where are you don't you
[1:08] recognize
[1:09] god can't you see what's happening don't
[1:10] you care
[1:12] there should be another revelation and
[1:14] say god i know you know me and i know
[1:16] you know where i'm at
[1:17] and i know you had a plan before the
[1:18] foundation of the world and i know i'm
[1:20] here as an instrument that you can work
[1:22] through
[1:22] and i'm trusting you in the middle of
[1:24] this trial because you're my heavenly
[1:26] father
[1:26] and you've deemed fit for me to walk
[1:28] this let me walk as an
[1:30] overcomer lord forgive me for
[1:34] forgive me for being fearful forgive me
[1:36] for my anxiety
[1:38] amen let me recognize your love from you
[1:40] lord let me see the seals torn away
[1:42] afresh right now in this trial
[1:46] he may not tell you the next step or how
[1:48] he's going to get you out of it
[1:50] or how deliverance will come but it
[1:52] doesn't matter if we can just go back
[1:54] and see what we were with him before the
[1:56] foundation of the world
[1:57] where we're going to what his purpose is
[2:00] right now
[2:00] then doesn't matter anymore what's
[2:03] happening
[2:05] will it be difficult yes will the flesh
[2:07] not like it of course not
[2:09] amen will the circumstances make you
[2:10] weary make you tired
[2:12] absolutely but those are things for us
[2:14] to overcome
[2:15] because he has already proved his love
[2:17] for us
