[0:00] in the identified masterpiece of god in
[0:02] december of 1964
[0:04] he says when he made his first
[0:06] masterpiece he put him behind the word
[0:09] when he made his second masterpiece he
[0:11] was the word
[0:14] big difference there's a real big
[0:17] difference
[0:18] from being behind the word and being the
[0:20] word
[0:21] because adam and eve were protected
[0:23] behind the word
[0:24] as long as they stayed behind the word
[0:26] the devil couldn't get to them
[0:27] amen so if they would step around from
[0:30] this word
[0:30] amen then they were open game for the
[0:32] devil and that's how they fell
[0:34] by moving out from behind the word amen
[0:36] but what if there's nothing to be behind
[0:38] anymore amen it's not
[0:40] the thing that was protecting them was
[0:42] separate from them but now
[0:44] the thing that's protecting us is who we
[0:46] really are we
[0:47] are the word amen that's why she can't
[0:49] fall she's predestinated not to fall
[0:52] because she's not behind the word she is
[0:54] the word
[0:56] and the devil couldn't go through that
[0:58] word to get to them amen but now we
[1:00] are the word and he can't break the word
[1:03] [Applause]
[1:05] it's different god protected him behind
[1:08] the wall of the word because it was a
[1:09] foreshadow but when the reality comes
[1:11] it's not behind
[1:12] the word it is the word you can no more
[1:14] fail than god can fail
[1:16] amen you are the living word amen jesus
[1:19] christ manifested in the flesh
[1:21] body of his bride amen how is the devil
[1:23] gonna get he can
[1:24] circle all around it amen but he cannot
[1:27] penetrate that word
[1:28] because we are the word the living word
[1:31] restored
[1:32] back to the word the word come to the
[1:34] word the body
[1:36] and the headship the capstone is united
[1:37] together
[1:39] and when we take him his word amen when
[1:41] we take his body the word we become in
[1:43] him
[1:45] the word amen
[1:48] cannot be defeated cannot fail amen why
[1:52] because the word has been restored to
[1:54] the original condition
[1:55] the bride has been united with that word
[1:57] and come in the word to be part of the
[1:59] word and she's not
[2:00] hiding behind anything she doesn't
[2:04] have to hide behind anything
[2:07] there's nothing to hide behind jesus
[2:09] christ when he came in flesh
[2:10] two thousand years ago he wasn't hiding
[2:12] behind anything
[2:13] he was the word made flesh he didn't
[2:16] have to hide he didn't need protection
[2:18] he was the word and he could not be
[2:20] defeated
[2:22] amen we're not hiding worried if i step
[2:26] over here if i step over here i'll be
[2:27] lost and oh i've got to be so careful
[2:30] no you are the word
[2:33] the very plan of god the very heart
[2:36] purpose of god
[2:37] is taking place in our lives right now
[2:38] and it cannot fail it's predestinated
[2:41] not to fall
