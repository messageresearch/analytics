[0:00] do you remember if if you remember
[0:02] watching the video brother Brenham said
[0:04] go home in peace God bless you you're
[0:05] all right God bless you and she starts
[0:08] walking around him this way and as she
[0:10] starts going around when he says this
[0:12] part you're not a witch he leans over to
[0:13] her and says you're not a witch if you
[0:16] listen to the tape you've got to catch
[0:17] it close you're not a witch do you know
[0:19] what that did for that woman when a
[0:21] prophet of God who could hear from God
[0:23] would look right at her and expose the
[0:25] lie that was in her life and say they
[0:27] lied about you that's not the truth amen
[0:30] he says don't pay no attention to them
[0:31] people they're
[0:34] lying and furthermore that lie is
[0:38] causing all kinds of other problems in
[0:40] your life you're all nervous and worked
[0:41] up and think you got a heart condition
[0:43] you don't even have a heart condition
[0:45] you're all stirred up because of the lie
[0:48] why because the LIE brings
[0:52] death he
[0:54] says they're lying and the only thing
[0:57] that's wrong with your heart is that
[0:58] nervous condition got your heart work up
[1:01] go on home in peace God bless you you're
[1:03] all right God bless you you're not a
[1:08] witch I guarantee that woman walked off
[1:10] that platform a whole lot different than
[1:12] she walked up on it and I wonder how
[1:14] long it took for that nervous condition
[1:16] to go away and her heart problems to
[1:18] fade away they were the product of a lie
[1:21] she was believing a lie she was
[1:23] struggling she may not have fully
[1:24] embraced it but she was struggling with
[1:26] the LIE Hey listen I'm telling you here
[1:28] today I don't want to to struggle with
[1:30] this lie anymore but I want to believe
[1:32] the truth of this message that I have
[1:34] been accepted in the Beloved that God
[1:36] has revealed himself to me and he's
[1:38] revealed me to me and I Know Who I Am by
[1:41] the grace of God because he has called
[1:43] me to his side by opening the word to
[1:48] me that's the truth that dispels all the
[1:51] lies we can't go back and erase what was
[1:54] done in our past friends you can't go
[1:56] back listen many of us can't go back and
[1:58] we can't ask our moms and dads to take
[2:00] back what they said they're gone some of
[2:02] them are gone my dad is gone there's
[2:04] things that I cannot I cannot ask him to
[2:06] make it right I cannot ask him to make
[2:07] it up other people who have done wrong
[2:09] and furthermore the things that I've
[2:11] done to wrong people I can't even make
[2:12] all those things right amen but God help
[2:15] us to receive the truth that'll push
[2:17] back the lie and that I will come to a
[2:19] position of security in Christ not in
[2:22] what's been told not in all that's gone
[2:24] wrong not in all the circumstances but I
[2:26] can come to a position of security and
[2:29] say God I don't understand why you would
[2:32] choose me I don't understand how you
[2:33] made that choice but I believe in my
[2:35] heart that I'm part of you that when
[2:37] this word is preached something in me
[2:39] knows I belong with it there's a
[2:42] magnetism on the inside amen I look at
[2:45] all the facts around me all the facts
[2:47] around me confirm the LIE amen but
[2:49] there's a fact inside of me that
[2:52] confirms the truth and the truth is I do
[2:55] believe that this is
[2:57] true amen
