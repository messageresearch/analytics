[17:00] [Music]
[17:03] Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our heads
[17:05] together this morning.
[17:08] Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, God, that
[17:11] you have cared for us, Lord, that you've
[17:14] provided for us, that you've watched
[17:16] over us, and you've brought us back
[17:17] together once again. And God, we know
[17:21] that we can do nothing in and of
[17:23] ourselves.
[17:25] But God, it's you working in us but to
[17:28] do the will of your good pleasure. And
[17:31] God, you've drawn us together again,
[17:33] Lord, into this meeting place and where
[17:35] we can gather with our brothers and
[17:37] sisters and worship your name. And we're
[17:39] grateful for that, Lord. And God, our
[17:42] desire is that you would find welcome in
[17:43] this place. For you've been invited,
[17:45] Lord. And Lord, may we welcome you with
[17:48] a kiss and anoint you, Lord, with our
[17:50] worship and prayers, weeping before your
[17:53] feet with joy and gratitude and
[17:55] repentance. God, may we be willing,
[17:58] Lord, to bear your reproach.
[18:00] God, we're here to hear from you, to sit
[18:02] at your feet and learn of you, Lord. We
[18:04] pray, God, you would, Lord, move amongst
[18:07] us as you break the bread of life and
[18:09] feed it to us by your own hand,
[18:11] instructing us as individuals, Lord, in
[18:13] the way of righteousness, what you have
[18:16] for us in our individual lives, Lord.
[18:18] May you speak it to us now through this
[18:20] vessel of clay. And may you get glory in
[18:23] it all and take preeminence among us
[18:24] all. May you have the first place. That
[18:27] is our desire. And we ask you would
[18:29] bless all that we say and do. In Jesus
[18:32] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[18:35] Amen. God bless you this morning. We're
[18:36] going to let you have your seats for
[18:37] just a moment. Musicians, thank you. You
[18:40] can be dismissed. Just want to say I
[18:42] appreciated that special this morning.
[18:44] Sister Anne, thank you for sharing that
[18:45] with us. Amen. And also wanted to let
[18:47] you know that at the end of service, we
[18:49] have a baptism. Sister uh Amanda Balog
[18:53] has desired to be baptized in the name
[18:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ. So we're very
[18:57] happy for her and for God drawing her to
[19:00] himself. Amen. It's always exciting to
[19:03] see. Amen. I wanted to also share with
[19:07] you, many of you know, but um uh Brother
[19:10] Jordan, Sister Rebecca Simson's baby
[19:12] Judah passed away Friday evening. And I
[19:15] know the prayer request went out a
[19:17] couple times for the assembly to be
[19:19] praying and just wanted to take the time
[19:21] to thank you all for praying for them.
[19:24] And it's such a heart heartwrenching
[19:27] heartbreaking tragedy uh for them. Some
[19:30] of you don't know uh Jordan Rebecca.
[19:33] Rebecca was here in this assembly before
[19:35] she was married. She was attending here
[19:37] for many years. Uh those of us who've
[19:39] been for a while, we know her really
[19:40] well. She visits every year. She's got
[19:42] family in Indiana. She visit them. she
[19:44] comes over. So, we've seen her and their
[19:47] children. Um, they had four children
[19:49] before Judah was born. Amen. So, it's
[19:52] it's it's a heartbreaking
[19:54] heart-wrenching thing. And, uh, Rebecca
[19:57] had sent me some text along the way. We
[19:59] stayed in communication while they were
[20:01] while Judah was in the hospital. He had
[20:03] some sort of a virus and swelling of the
[20:05] brain. Uh, his brain was damaged and
[20:07] they they they considered him to be
[20:10] brain dead. They had him on life support
[20:12] and they had to remove the life support
[20:14] Friday evening. And so I I can't imagine
[20:18] the heartbreak that they're suffering
[20:19] from. And so I'd like for us to just
[20:22] pray together for that family and and
[20:25] for their not just their family, their
[20:27] assembly and their extended family and
[20:29] their friends. But I immediately as I
[20:32] was praying for them thought of a quote
[20:34] that uh brother Gabe had read last
[20:37] Sunday and I want to read it to you to
[20:39] remind you of it and you'll remember but
[20:41] there was a woman that was stationed in
[20:43] Germany with her husband and she was
[20:45] trying to get brother Bam to come pray
[20:47] for her baby and the baby was had died
[20:50] and was dying and and she kept calling
[20:52] sister Ma trying to get brother Bam to
[20:54] come was going to send a plane ticket
[20:55] and all of these other things and then
[20:58] brother Brandham he wakes up and and I
[21:00] want to read from this point here. This
[21:02] is out of the message the Messiah 1961
[21:05] said, "One morning about daylight, I got
[21:07] up and the wife went out of the room and
[21:09] she went out of the room and I just
[21:11] wakened up and I lay there a little bit
[21:14] directly. I heard something coming into
[21:16] the room and I looked there was
[21:17] something moving in the room and I
[21:19] jumped up and I said, "Lord, what would
[21:21] you have your servant know?" It said,
[21:23] "Do not rebuke that. That's the hand of
[21:26] the Lord." See, so I got her on the
[21:28] phone. And I said, "No, God has called
[21:31] your baby." And so when she come over to
[21:33] see us, I left her at the house when I
[21:35] left yesterday. She said, "What was it,
[21:37] Brother Brandham? My weakness of faith."
[21:40] I said, "You have great faith. You
[21:43] prayed for your baby. You and your
[21:45] husband held on to it. God raised that
[21:47] baby." And he refused to do it because
[21:50] he knows what's best. And still you love
[21:53] him. That's real faith. Anybody when
[21:58] mountains are moving and things can have
[22:00] faith but let it go backwards one time
[22:01] and see how it works. That's when you
[22:03] prove whether you got faith or not.
[22:06] Every son that cometh to God must be
[22:08] chasened and tried of God. So remember
[22:10] our trials works patience and patience
[22:12] works hope and so forth. So we just hold
[22:14] on to God whether he blesses us or not.
[22:17] We are right there to believe him anyhow
[22:19] cuz he's promised it.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I can assure you that as I was
[22:25] receiving text from Sister Rebecca, she
[22:27] was believing.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; She was believing to the last moment,
[22:30] she was holding on to the promise of
[22:32] God. She was expecting that baby to
[22:34] raise up. She was even expecting though
[22:36] they removed the life support, the baby
[22:38] will raise up. She had tremendous faith.
[22:40] And even after God took Judah home, she
[22:43] sent me a text still declaring the
[22:45] goodness of God and her faith in him. So
[22:48] I say that Jordan and Rebecca Simonson
[22:50] have great faith.
[22:52] And so, you know, we we have so many
[22:55] testimonies and we have prayer requests
[22:57] here and testimonies all the time. We
[22:58] see God move all the time. And sometimes
[23:01] God moves in ways we don't expect. And
[23:04] sometimes he moves in ways our human
[23:06] mind cannot fathom. Amen.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; I cannot with human reasoning I cannot I
[23:12] cannot grasp a two to threemonth old
[23:15] baby leaving this world being born
[23:18] healthy being born strong and starting
[23:21] to interact with his parents and then
[23:23] God allowing something like this and
[23:25] taking the baby home. I I can't fathom
[23:27] that.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; My my human mind can't I can't reason
[23:32] that one out, friends. The emotional
[23:34] realm can't come to terms with it. But
[23:36] one thing's for sure, God remains good
[23:39] &gt;&gt; and he remains faithful and his word is
[23:41] true.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham had to deal with this
[23:44] with losing Sharon Rose and and he saw
[23:47] her in a dream as a beautiful young
[23:49] woman standing there 18, 19, 20 years
[23:52] old and she said, "Daddy, don't you
[23:54] recognize me in life? I was your little
[23:57] Sharon Rose." And Brother Random knew it
[24:00] was it was okay. Amen. when he saw
[24:02] Sharon Rose there as a as a woman and
[24:06] though Judah has been stripped away from
[24:09] mom and dad and they don't have the
[24:11] privilege now of seeing him grow they
[24:13] don't get to embrace him and kiss him
[24:15] and hug him and all the things that they
[24:17] desire to do. I believe by the grace of
[24:19] God somewhere yonder there's a fine
[24:22] handsome young man
[24:23] &gt;&gt; named Judah. Amen. And there's going to
[24:26] be a reunion someday with his earthly
[24:29] parents. And that's the consolation that
[24:31] we have. That's where our faith when our
[24:34] faith in in the the promise of God and
[24:38] our faith and the hopes of God and our
[24:39] hopes that we have for a certain outcome
[24:41] when they don't go that way. Amen.
[24:43] There's still an anchor of faith that
[24:45] can look beyond the natural and beyond
[24:47] into the supernatural and beyond time
[24:49] and say his word is still true and his
[24:52] promises are still true. So, if we could
[24:55] stand together, I'd like to have a
[24:57] special time of prayer for the Simonson
[24:59] family.
[25:01] Amen. Let's bow our heads and hearts
[25:03] together. Dear Lord Jesus,
[25:06] we love you, Lord. We're so thankful for
[25:09] the price of redemption that you paid to
[25:13] take away the sins of the world. And
[25:16] God, your prophet told us that that sin
[25:20] offering removed the sin even of babies.
[25:24] the sin that he was born with. He had
[25:26] not yet had his own sin. He was born in
[25:28] sin, but you removed that sin at
[25:30] Calvary. And your prophet said, "Babies
[25:32] go to heaven."
[25:34] God, we're so thankful for the price of
[25:36] redemption and the consolation that we
[25:38] have. God, we're so thankful that we
[25:41] live in the hour that you've allowed a
[25:43] prophet to step beyond the curtain of
[25:44] time and show us what's beyond this
[25:46] life. So in times of heartbreak, in
[25:49] times of sadness, we can lift our eyes
[25:52] above the carnal and to the supernatural
[25:54] and realize that all is well. And God,
[25:58] our hearts are broken uh for brother
[26:01] Jordan and Sister Rebecca.
[26:03] Lord, for the whole Simson family, for
[26:05] their brothers and sisters, and God, for
[26:07] their church, for brother Kelly, their
[26:09] pastor, who now has to do a funeral for
[26:11] this baby. God, I just pray that you'd
[26:14] send a special comfort to them all,
[26:17] especially to Jordan, Rebecca. May they
[26:19] feel a tangible presence among them,
[26:21] Lord, that you would take them by the
[26:23] hand and wrap your arms around them as
[26:25] it were, and walk with them through this
[26:27] trial, through this tragedy in their
[26:29] lives. And God, may they find you
[26:32] faithful even in death, faithful in
[26:35] heartbreak, faithful in sadness. May you
[26:38] be true to them, Lord, and true to your
[26:39] word. God, we ask that you would do
[26:42] these things. We bind our faith with
[26:44] theirs and our hearts with theirs. For
[26:46] you said, "When one rejoice, we all
[26:48] rejoice. And when one mourns, we all
[26:50] mourn." And we're in mourning now with
[26:51] our brother and sister. And God, we know
[26:54] that someday the mourning will be turned
[26:56] to rejoicing sometime beyond this life.
[26:59] But until then, we pray you give them a
[27:01] supernatural comfort by your grace. We
[27:04] ask it for the whole church there. God,
[27:06] be with us this morning as we look into
[27:08] your word. May we also, Lord, be able to
[27:11] look beyond this life and keep our eyes
[27:13] fixed on something that's greater. And
[27:15] may that joy that comes into our heart
[27:18] by that vision help us to walk through
[27:20] every tragedy, every valley, everything
[27:23] that we face in this life, the highs and
[27:25] the lows, may they all be leveled off by
[27:28] the revelation of what lays ahead. We
[27:30] love you, God, and we ask your blessing
[27:32] for this family in Jesus Christ's name.
[27:35] Amen.
[27:37] Man, I appreciate if you just remember
[27:38] them in prayer for no doubt there some
[27:41] difficult days ahead with funeral
[27:43] planning and and all the things that go
[27:45] with that and then the time that comes
[27:47] to a family after a funeral and after a
[27:50] burial. So, just remember them in
[27:52] prayer, please. Amen.
[27:55] If you could turn with your Bibles with
[27:57] me this morning to the book of Jude. I'm
[27:59] going to read two places in the
[28:00] scripture while we're standing. and
[28:02] Jude. We'll start in Jude chapter 14.
[28:16] Jude chapter 14. I'm just going to read
[28:17] the first part of this verse.
[28:21] And Enoch also the seventh from Adam. If
[28:26] you turn with me to Genesis chapter 5,
[28:29] we'll go back there and read a bit about
[28:31] Enoch.
[28:41] Genesis chapter 5
[28:47] verse 21.
[28:49] Genesis 5 and 21.
[28:52] And Enoch lived 60 and five years and
[28:55] begat Methuselah. And Enoch walked with
[28:57] God after he begat Methuselah 300 years
[29:00] and begat sons and daughters. And all
[29:03] the days of Enoch were 360 and5 years.
[29:07] And Enoch walked with God and he was not
[29:10] for God took him. Amen. God bless you as
[29:13] you have your seats. Amen. So now we
[29:16] know that Enoch was the seventh from
[29:18] Adam. And Enoch is a type of the seventh
[29:21] church age. He's a type. He's our type
[29:23] in the scriptures because we've come to
[29:25] the seventh church age. and the seventh
[29:26] from Adam. Amen. Typing the seventh
[29:29] church age shows that Enoch had a a
[29:32] translation. He had a rapture. Amen. He
[29:34] was translated out of this world into
[29:36] the next. Showing that that's that's the
[29:39] that's the type of us in this generation
[29:42] that we're going to take a translation.
[29:43] Amen. We're going to take a body change
[29:45] and step out of this world and we'll be
[29:47] not for God will take us. Amen.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I want to look at this. I I
[29:52] ministered this last Sunday, this
[29:54] subject uh uh at brother Eugene Bronn's
[29:57] uh uh service there and I know several
[30:00] of you uh listened to that, went to the
[30:03] archives and listened to it. Maybe many
[30:04] of you have and so you're going to get a
[30:07] part two or you're going to get not part
[30:09] two, maybe repeat with overlap. I don't
[30:11] know. Amen. But I I was debating on
[30:14] whether to bring this or not and I had a
[30:15] couple thoughts and I kept bouncing back
[30:17] and forth and I finally settled on this
[30:19] and I just really wanted to share this
[30:21] again with the whole assembly. So if
[30:23] you've heard it already, you know the
[30:24] parts to amen, okay?
[30:27] So we're expecting you to stay with me.
[30:29] Amen. But it's always a little
[30:30] different. There's some new things that
[30:32] I would like to share that God's been
[30:33] dealing with me on. And so I would like
[30:35] to just work uh this subject together.
[30:37] But if we could bring up the PowerPoint
[30:40] uh this morning, I want to talk about
[30:42] walking in a deeper relationship. I want
[30:45] there's a little bit of a different uh
[30:48] direction I want to take than I did last
[30:50] Sunday. What amazed me is when I got
[30:52] home and I watched the archive uh of
[30:54] Brother Gab's service, he he quoted
[30:56] several of the same quotes that I quoted
[30:58] and several of the same thoughts along
[31:00] the way. It wasn't the same service, but
[31:01] there were some points that were the
[31:03] same. And that was encouraging to me to
[31:05] see that God was working in a
[31:06] continuity. And so I just want to stay
[31:08] in that theme where God's working, I
[31:10] want to stay there and keep working in
[31:12] that and see what God will do. So Enoch,
[31:16] he walked with God. And it's amazing
[31:19] before he came to a translation, he
[31:22] walked with God.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; And if we want to look at what would be
[31:26] a precursor to a translation, it would
[31:28] be walking with God.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we cannot force a translation.
[31:33] We cannot force a body change. Amen. We
[31:37] we cannot predict, amen, the day or
[31:39] hour, the moment of that body change.
[31:42] But we know that that it's going to come
[31:44] as we walk with God.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the thing that we cannot do is
[31:48] force a body change. But the thing we
[31:50] can do is walk with God. And as we walk
[31:52] with God, we'll be walking in that
[31:54] resurrection, walking in that rapture,
[31:57] and moving closer and closer to him. And
[31:59] as we walk with him, we walk closer to a
[32:02] translation and further from this world.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; And I think our goal should be to walk
[32:06] with him.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and when we walk with God, I I
[32:12] wanted to look at this subject of
[32:13] walking with God. Uh in Genesis chapter
[32:16] 3, it speaks uh here of the fall, but
[32:20] we're going to take a a little picture
[32:22] into Eden. It says, "And when the woman
[32:24] saw that the tree was good for food, and
[32:26] that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a
[32:28] tree to be desired to make one wise, she
[32:30] took of the fruit thereof, and did eat,
[32:32] and gave also, and to her husband with
[32:33] her, and he did eat." And the eyes of
[32:36] them both were opened, and they knew
[32:37] that they were naked, and they sewed fig
[32:39] leaves together, and made themselves
[32:40] aprons. And they heard the voice of the
[32:43] Lord, God, walking in the garden in the
[32:46] cool of the day. And Adam and his wife
[32:48] hid themselves from the presence of the
[32:50] Lord God amongst the trees of the
[32:52] garden. And then brother Bam would
[32:54] dramatize this many times. We've talked
[32:56] about it where God would come down in
[32:59] the cool of the evening to fellowship
[33:01] with his children. But brother Benham
[33:04] tells us they never saw a physical form.
[33:06] They never saw a body. They never saw a
[33:08] man. He said sometimes he would
[33:10] materialize as a pillar of fire or or
[33:13] something like that. But here when he
[33:15] came down in the cool of the evening for
[33:17] fellowship, he found them fallen. But it
[33:20] says they heard the voice of the Lord
[33:22] God walking in the garden. They didn't
[33:25] hear footsteps because there were not
[33:27] footsteps because there was not a human
[33:29] form. He wasn't coming in that way.
[33:31] Amen. But he was coming. And and and it
[33:34] says, "And they hid themselves from the
[33:36] presence of the Lord." How was the
[33:38] presence of the Lord recognized? How did
[33:40] they know he was there? Amen. It wasn't
[33:43] that he heard his footsteps. They didn't
[33:44] recognize him by footsteps. They
[33:46] recognized him by his voice.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; So his voice declared his presence and
[33:52] they were walking with the voice.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; And they heard the voice of the Lord God
[33:57] walking in the garden. Amen. So when
[33:59] when you hear his voice, the voice of
[34:02] God, Amen, is God coming to walk with
[34:05] us. Amen. Like he came to walk with his
[34:07] children in the cool of the evening.
[34:09] Amen. And they hid from his presence.
[34:11] Amen. because his presence was declared
[34:14] by his voice.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; This has everything to do with you and
[34:18] I.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Bham says Jesus said, "No man
[34:22] can come to me except my father has
[34:23] drawn him and all that my father hath
[34:26] given me they they will come. My sheep,
[34:29] my doves hear my voice. A stranger they
[34:32] will not follow." And what is the voice
[34:34] of God? Is the word of God. What's any
[34:38] man's voice but his word. It's the word
[34:41] of God. They'll they'll hear the word of
[34:44] God. So when we're hearing the word of
[34:46] God, we're hearing the voice of God.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we can walk with that voice.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[34:57] Amen. Brother B said, "The bride must be
[35:00] unified, unified together by the word.
[35:02] My sheep hear my voice, and this is his
[35:04] voice in printed form." Brother said,
[35:07] "This is his voice in printed form." So,
[35:10] it's not necessarily audible, but it's a
[35:12] voice because it speaks. What does it
[35:15] speak? It speaks him. His thoughts, his
[35:18] mind, his desires are spoken through his
[35:21] word. And it's his voice. And it's the
[35:23] voice that we can walk with.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; He says this. This is always God's way
[35:29] of making his voice known to his people.
[35:32] He sends his prophet and gives a sign
[35:34] and then takes his voice that's been
[35:36] spoken before on his word and vindicates
[35:38] it by this man. And they know that it's
[35:41] his voice because it's the promised word
[35:44] of the day.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; So the promised word of the day is his
[35:48] voice
[35:50] &gt;&gt; which brings us denotes his presence.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; And we can walk with that voice in his
[35:57] presence.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I I like to ask questions and
[36:04] I asked this question. Brother Beam told
[36:05] us that when God came in Eden to walk
[36:09] with his children, he didn't come in a
[36:12] physical form of a body. They didn't
[36:14] hear footsteps. He didn't walk with him
[36:16] that way. But his presence would come,
[36:18] his voice would come. And even they
[36:20] would maybe see a pillar of fire,
[36:21] brother said, hanging in the bushes and
[36:23] they would hear his voice. Amen. And so
[36:24] they were walking with the voice of the
[36:26] Lord, not walking with a physical form.
[36:29] Amen. So to walk with God, you don't
[36:31] have to see anything.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; You can walk with God when you hear
[36:36] something.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; When you hear his voice, you can walk
[36:39] with his voice.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; And the question is, how did Enoch walk
[36:44] with God? That's my question.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Was he handinand with another physical
[36:48] being in human form? Amen. How was Enoch
[36:51] walking with God? that the the Bible
[36:54] doesn't tell us how he was walking with
[36:56] God. But from the things the prophet
[36:58] tells us and from everything we
[36:59] understand, Amen. I don't think that
[37:02] that God appeared him to him in a flesh
[37:04] body and they went strolling along
[37:05] together. Amen. In a flesh body. Amen.
[37:08] But he knew the presence of God. He knew
[37:11] the voice of God. He knew the word of
[37:13] God. And he was walking with God.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; And he may not have had another being
[37:19] beside him on the stroll. Amen. But he
[37:21] was still walking with God.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:26] And and we're going to uh look at that
[37:28] in the prophet's life here later.
[37:31] Now, look at what brother Bam says,
[37:35] taking from the scriptures. How can two
[37:37] walk together lest they be agreed?
[37:41] How can you walk with God unless you
[37:42] agree with his word?
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; How can you add creeds and so forth to
[37:46] it? Then you're ordained not to do it or
[37:48] commanded not to do it. You can't do it.
[37:50] There's no way of doing it, brother,
[37:51] sister. You can't mix that leaven with
[37:53] the unleaven. Oil and water will not
[37:55] mix. Darkness and light will not mix. So
[37:58] how how can two walk together? This is a
[38:01] fundamental principle. Amen. From the
[38:03] scripture is how can two walk together
[38:05] lest they be agreed? So how can I walk
[38:08] with God unless I agree with his word?
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Because his word is him
[38:14] &gt;&gt; revealed. It's him. It's his thought
[38:16] which is him. Amen. Come into word form.
[38:19] come into a manifestation, come in to a
[38:22] revelation and a manifestation. That's
[38:24] him. And how can I say I walk with God
[38:27] and deny his word and disobey his word
[38:30] and not give heed to his word? How can I
[38:32] say I walk with God when I'm not
[38:34] agreeing with God?
[38:36] &gt;&gt; And if I don't agree with his word and I
[38:38] don't agree with the word for the day
[38:39] and I don't agree with the prophet's
[38:41] message, then it's impossible for me to
[38:43] walk with God. Amen. Because God is his
[38:46] word. Amen. And he's manifest his word
[38:48] in this day. And to walk with God, I
[38:50] must walk with his voice, with his word.
[38:53] Amen. That's been spoken in our hour.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "What is sin?"
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Unbelief. Unbelief in what? The word.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to
[39:12] try to move to the whiteboard here and
[39:15] see if I can use this. I I want to write
[39:18] this out because it becomes uh it
[39:21] becomes so real to me when we start to
[39:23] look at these things because the prophet
[39:25] teaches us so many fundamental lessons.
[39:27] And if we'll take the lesson the prophet
[39:29] gave us, it begins to give us some
[39:31] understanding and discernment. He says
[39:34] sin.
[39:37] He said it's not smoking, drinking,
[39:38] swearing, running around, committing
[39:40] adultery. That's not sin. He said those
[39:43] are the attributes of sin. That what
[39:44] comes that comes forth from sin. But he
[39:47] says sin
[39:50] is unbelief.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; But unbelief
[39:56] in what?
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Word.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Unbelief
[40:01] in the word.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's my next question.
[40:05] What word?
[40:09] &gt;&gt; That's a good question.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; It's unbelief
[40:16] in the word
[40:19] for your day. Amen.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came
[40:29] in flesh as the fulfillment of the
[40:31] prophet prophecy, he was the word for
[40:34] his day. M. He was the word made flesh.
[40:38] And they believed the Old Testament and
[40:40] they believed the mo ministry of Moses
[40:42] and they believed in the Exodus journey.
[40:45] And they believed in the parting of the
[40:46] Red Sea and they believed in the
[40:48] stopping of the waters in Jordan. And
[40:50] they believed that there was uh 12
[40:52] tribes, sons of uh uh of Israel. They
[40:56] believed in all of the visit. They
[40:58] believed in in God visiting Jacob. They
[41:00] believed in God visiting Abraham. They
[41:03] believed in all of those things.
[41:07] But Jesus said, "Unless you believe that
[41:09] I am he, you will die in your sins."
[41:13] &gt;&gt; So they believed so much of the Bible
[41:16] and which would be the word. You say,
[41:18] "Do you believe that that there was a
[41:20] deliverance out of Egypt, amen, by the
[41:23] hand of God through Moses?" Yes. Do you
[41:24] believe in the 10 plagues? Yes.
[41:26] Absolutely. Would you stake your life on
[41:28] it? Absolutely. I'd stake my life on it.
[41:31] Amen. They believed so much of the
[41:33] Bible. But where were they failing to
[41:35] believe? They were failing to believe
[41:37] the word for their day.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; From the beginning of our Bibles to the
[41:42] end of our Bibles, salvation is always
[41:45] the same.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; I've said before, I'll say it a thousand
[41:48] times. This is where denominations fail.
[41:51] Amen. This is where traditions of men
[41:53] fail. Amen. From the beginning of our
[41:55] Bible to the end, salvation has always
[41:57] been based on believing the word for
[41:59] your day. Amen.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Because God would send a word of
[42:03] salvation in every age. Amen. And to
[42:06] heed that word would equal salvation in
[42:08] that day.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So sin is unbelief. And so you can
[42:14] get somebody who says, "Well, I believe
[42:16] the Bible and I believe in Paul and I
[42:19] believe in Peter and I believe in
[42:21] Calvary." And nobody's contesting that.
[42:24] Amen. They believe in that. But but
[42:26] where was the sin in Jesus's day? It
[42:29] wasn't that they disbelieved the Torah.
[42:31] It wasn't that they disbelieved the
[42:33] prophets. It was that they disbelieved
[42:35] when all of that was brought into
[42:37] manifestation in front of them and the
[42:39] word made flesh in their day. They
[42:41] disbelieved the word that they were
[42:43] encountering in their day. And when they
[42:45] disbelieved that word, amen, Jesus said,
[42:48] "You'll die in your sins."
[42:51] &gt;&gt; They paid ti. They went to church. They
[42:53] gave tribute. They went to the feast.
[42:54] They did everything that the Bible was
[42:56] telling them to do. Amen.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; So to me this is a really really
[43:02] important understanding that brother
[43:04] Brandham gave us. Amen. And it shows
[43:06] what the fallacy with tradition what the
[43:09] fallacy with denominations. Amen. It's
[43:11] it's not just that they get some of the
[43:13] word wrong. Amen. It's that they get the
[43:15] whole fundamental principle of the word
[43:17] wrong.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; And God is alive. He is present tense.
[43:22] He is an I am God.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; And he wants us to receive him as I am.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:30] And so he he goes on to say, "How can
[43:33] two walk together unless they be
[43:35] agreed?" They can't. Jesus said they
[43:37] can't. And how can a church, the
[43:39] Methodist and Baptist, walk together?
[43:41] How can the church of Christ walk with
[43:42] the Presbyterians? How can the Catholic
[43:44] walk with the Protestant? How can the
[43:46] Protestant walk with Protestant? But the
[43:49] bride can walk with the word, which is
[43:51] Christ.
[43:53] It must be in agreement. Not the
[43:56] ecclesiastical system, but the word. You
[43:59] have to agree with the word to walk with
[44:01] the word.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; This is so amazing. So, brother said,
[44:05] "But the bride uh the bride
[44:09] can walk with the word."
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Which is Christ.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; So to walk with the word is to walk with
[44:20] Christ.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:23] Amen. And you have to agree with the
[44:25] word to walk with the word. So to be in
[44:29] disagreement with this message, Amen.
[44:32] means that you're not able to walk with
[44:34] the Lord because how can two walk
[44:37] together unless they be agreed.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:43] Again, he says, notice, you can't walk
[44:45] with the world and expect God to walk
[44:48] with you.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:50] Angels won't visit you or nothing else
[44:52] but the world because you cannot mix God
[44:54] and the world together. I
[44:57] &gt;&gt; mean these are so basic principles but
[44:59] they're so important for us to
[45:01] understand. Now when we go back to
[45:04] Hebrews and Hebrews 11 we're going back
[45:07] to Enoch. It says by faith Enoch was
[45:10] translated that he should not see death
[45:12] was not found because God had translated
[45:15] him. For before his translation, he had
[45:17] this testimony that he pleased God.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; I I love this. I just absolutely love
[45:25] this.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to highlight this
[45:30] because it says, "Without faith, it's
[45:32] impossible to please him."
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; For he that cometh to God must believe
[45:38] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[45:40] them that diligently seek him.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So before his translation, he had
[45:47] a testimony in his walk with God. He had
[45:50] this testimony that he pleased God. And
[45:53] the thing that I want to share, this is
[45:55] what I was sharing uh up in Edmonton
[45:57] last week, is he didn't please God
[46:00] because he was really good at doing good
[46:03] deeds and he always did the right thing.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; And I'm not accusing Enoch of doing the
[46:08] wrong thing, but if he was a human being
[46:10] like everybody else that was in the
[46:12] Bible, he probably did some wrong
[46:14] things. Amen.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; I'm just an assumption that I'm making,
[46:16] but that's not what pleased God. What
[46:19] pleased God is his faith because without
[46:22] faith, it's impossible to please God.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. It it you know, it wasn't all
[46:28] through the Bible. It's what's pleased
[46:31] God. God's been looking for somebody who
[46:33] will believe him.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; He's always in the Bible in every age
[46:37] looking for those that will believe him.
[46:39] Amen. Uh and not doubt him and not doubt
[46:41] his words and not disbelieve. but
[46:43] somebody who could believe. And and when
[46:45] we believe in God, God has a vessel to
[46:47] work through. He can perform his word
[46:48] and he can bring it to pass. But God is
[46:51] looking for somebody that will believe
[46:52] him. So, how was it that Enoch pleased
[46:55] God? I'm sure he did some of the right
[46:58] things. I'm sure he he was obedient, but
[47:00] I'm also sure that he probably made
[47:02] mistakes along the way and did some
[47:04] wrong things if he's like all the other
[47:06] heroes of the faith in in Hebrews 11.
[47:10] But without faith, it is impossible to
[47:12] please him. So all the works that we can
[47:15] do if we don't have faith in the word
[47:18] for our day. Amen. We cannot please him
[47:21] by dressing right, acting right, doing
[47:23] right. A amen. All of those things. We
[47:26] cannot please the Lord by that absent of
[47:28] faith.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean that the Lord's not
[47:31] pleased with the right conduct. It
[47:33] doesn't mean that it doesn't bring him
[47:34] pleasure to see us in obedience in the
[47:35] word. Amen. But those things are an
[47:37] outcropping of our faith. Amen. They
[47:40] don't bring faith. Neither they do bring
[47:42] God's pleasure.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; What brings God's pleasure is faith. And
[47:47] faith brings works.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Enoch couldn't please God by doing a hu
[47:56] and Noah Noah could not please God by
[47:59] undertaking a huge construction project.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; One day he just decided, you know what?
[48:05] I'm gonna build a gigantic boat to
[48:07] please God.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the building of the ark that
[48:12] pleased God. It was the fact that Noah
[48:14] believed the voice of God.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; And because Noah believed, he built an
[48:19] ark.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Hebrews. Can you turn with
[48:24] me to Hebrews chapter 11?
[48:30] Sometimes we get the cart before the
[48:31] horse. You know, we misunderstand the
[48:33] things with God. And it wasn't that
[48:35] building the ark didn't please God, but
[48:38] what pleased God was his faith. And and
[48:40] and building the ark was the outflow of
[48:43] his faith.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Why did he build an ark? He didn't build
[48:49] an ark to please God.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; He built an ark because he believed the
[48:53] message. And the message said, "There's
[48:55] coming a destruction, but I made a way
[48:57] of escape. If you'll build this ark, you
[48:59] and your family will be saved." He built
[49:01] the ark because he believed the message.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; He didn't build the ark to get merit
[49:07] points with God or to please God or to
[49:10] get salvation from God. God brought him
[49:12] his word. Amen. And his word with
[49:14] salvation and he built the ark because
[49:16] he believed the word.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; He didn't do it to get something from
[49:21] God or to be pleasing to God. He did it
[49:24] because he believed God. Amen.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Why did Abraham take his son, his only
[49:31] son, up to Mount Mariah to slay him? Why
[49:34] did he do that? He didn't do it to find
[49:36] pleasure with God. He had already found
[49:38] pleasure with God. He his faith had
[49:39] already pleased God. He already had an
[49:41] imputation of righteousness because he
[49:43] believed God. He wasn't going up there
[49:45] to get righteousness. He wasn't going to
[49:47] get something. He was taking him up
[49:49] there because he believed God.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:56] Let's in Hebrews 11. Let me find it
[49:58] here. Verse 7. Hebrews 11:7.
[50:04] By faith Noah being warned of God of
[50:07] things not seen as yet moved with fear,
[50:09] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[50:11] house, by which he condemned the world
[50:13] and became heir of the righteousness
[50:15] which is by faith.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; So how did Noah save his family?
[50:22] He didn't save him with an ark. He saved
[50:24] him by faith.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; And faith moved him to build the ark.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; I hope we're getting this.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; We can't just go and decide to do
[50:34] something and I'm going to do this and
[50:36] save my family. I'm going to do this and
[50:38] save my faith. No. The only place of
[50:40] salvation is faith. You're saved by
[50:42] grace through faith and that not of
[50:44] yourselves. It is the gift of God. But
[50:45] the faith in the word of God will
[50:47] produce the word of God.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the way it's been all
[50:52] down through time. Now in Hebrews 11:1,
[50:56] it says, "Now faith is the substance of
[50:58] things hoped for, the evidence of things
[51:00] not seen. For by it, it what's it?
[51:06] By it
[51:08] faith.
[51:11] By it the elders obtained a good report.
[51:18] It did not say by good deeds the elders
[51:22] obtained a good report.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Have you read the book of Hebrews?
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; By faith Noah. By faith Abraham. By
[51:34] faith Sarah. By faith. By faith. By
[51:37] faith. What was pleasing God? What put
[51:40] them in Hebrews chapter 11? The the the
[51:42] the heroes of faith chapter. What put
[51:44] them there? faith
[51:46] &gt;&gt; and the promise word for their day. What
[51:49] Noah believed was different than what
[51:50] Moses believed was different. What
[51:51] Abraham believed,
[51:53] &gt;&gt; but it was all the same. Jesus Christ
[51:55] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[51:56] The word for their day.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; So by it faith, the elders obtained a
[52:03] good report.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; By what? By faith, not by deeds.
[52:11] Amen. You say, "Well, they did good
[52:12] deeds." They did. But go back and read
[52:14] their lives and see, did they always do
[52:16] good deeds?
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Was everything they did right? Did they
[52:20] do good only? What about David? No. What
[52:22] about Solomon? No. What about Noah? No.
[52:24] What about Moses? No. Amen. You go
[52:27] through each one of their lives and you
[52:29] will not find that they pleased God
[52:31] because of their deeds. They pleased God
[52:33] because of faith.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; And they obtained a good report because
[52:37] of faith.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Now we go to Hebrews 11:13. These all
[52:42] died in faith.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; I love this.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; You mean I can die in faith?
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; You means to die doesn't mean I lack
[52:53] faith.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; They died still believing.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; These all died in faith, not having
[52:59] received the promises, but having seen
[53:01] them a far off, and were persuaded of
[53:03] them, and embraced them, and confessed
[53:05] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[53:08] the earth. For they that say such thing
[53:10] declare plainly that they seek a
[53:12] country. And then Hebrews 11:39-4, these
[53:16] all having obtained a good report
[53:18] through faith. There it is again. Having
[53:20] attained a good report through faith,
[53:22] received not the promise, God having
[53:24] provided some better thing for us that
[53:26] they without us should not be made
[53:28] perfect. Amen. So each one of them
[53:30] obtained a good report through faith.
[53:32] And each one of them overcame by faith.
[53:36] Amen.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; They didn't overcome by sword. They
[53:38] didn't overcome by feet. They didn't
[53:40] overcome by deed. They overcame by
[53:42] faith. And faith produced the feet and
[53:44] the deed.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; I hope we're all on the same page. I
[53:48] hope we're all on the exact same spot.
[53:50] So, how do I get into the heroes of
[53:52] faith chapter? Do I build an ark? Do I
[53:54] slay a giant? Do I destroy enemies? No.
[53:57] The only thing I have to do to find
[53:59] myself in Hebrews 11 is believe the word
[54:01] when it's presented to me. And by it,
[54:04] faith in the present word, I will
[54:06] receive a good report.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; What good report? The same good report.
[54:11] Amen. That'll give me entrance into
[54:13] eternal life and entrance into all the
[54:14] promises of God.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; So they without us should not be made
[54:19] perfect. That means they're waiting on
[54:21] us. What are they waiting on us to do?
[54:26] probably the same thing they did,
[54:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Build an ark. Clay a giant.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; No.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Believe the word.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Believe the word for our day. Walk with
[54:38] God and give God something to work with
[54:40] so that he can perform his word in our
[54:42] generation through somebody who will
[54:44] believe his word. They without us are
[54:46] not yet made perfect. They're waiting.
[54:48] Brother Brandham said they're waiting
[54:49] for this church to come to perfection.
[54:51] They're waiting on us to do what? to
[54:54] just believe God's promise for this hour
[54:56] to believe the word and walk with the
[54:59] word. And as we walk with the word, the
[55:01] word will produce itself in someone who
[55:03] believes.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; And that's what they're waiting for. So,
[55:08] we've got to do the same thing they did.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[55:13] Brother said in the Easter Seal, "Let's
[55:15] take another man with this quickening
[55:17] power." There was a man way long ago by
[55:20] the name of Enoch. when a new thing come
[55:22] along, when something come along and
[55:24] said, "Well, now we have to go back to
[55:26] the old school or this that or the
[55:27] other." Enoch walked with God. Whatever
[55:30] God said do, Enoch never missed one
[55:32] word. He walked with God. What was he?
[55:34] He was a son of God. He was an eagle
[55:37] that had been called to that day.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:41] Brother Ram goes on and he says,
[55:43] "Salvation is an individual affair
[55:45] between not a church but between each
[55:48] individual and God walking with the
[55:52] word."
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Are we seeing a pattern?
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Salvation's an individual affair
[56:00] between each individual with God walking
[56:03] with the word.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember I said from the beginning
[56:07] of our Bible to the end, salvation has
[56:09] always been the same in every
[56:10] generation. It's been receiving the word
[56:12] for your day.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Walking with the word.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; And only believe, brother says, wouldn't
[56:21] that be nice if we had a testimony like
[56:23] that, brethren? I do only that which
[56:25] pleases God. Wouldn't that be wonderful?
[56:28] Like Enoch walked with God 500 years and
[56:30] had a testimony that he pleased God. He
[56:32] didn't have to die. He just went up. So
[56:35] then a little afternoon stroll, he just
[56:37] started walking out and just thought,
[56:39] "Well, I've been on Earth long enough.
[56:41] I'll just walk on up." And just started
[56:43] by faith. He thought, "Well, I've been
[56:45] here long enough, so I'm kind of tired
[56:47] of being around here. I think I'll just
[56:49] stroll on up till I hit the Milky White
[56:51] Way and just walk on up and knock on the
[56:53] door." So that's what he did. See, by
[56:56] faith, he did it. The Bible said, "So,
[56:59] see, he just got tired staying here." He
[57:01] said, "Well, I'm just going to walk up
[57:03] home." God just went on up through the
[57:05] air walking. He did that by faith. Amen.
[57:08] I put this quote in here because I want
[57:10] to show when brother Brandham dramatizes
[57:12] the body change. Amen. Enoch walked with
[57:15] God and was not. For God took him. Amen.
[57:17] And and and he he by faith Enoch was
[57:20] translated.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; By faith. How was he translated? By
[57:24] faith. It wasn't an act of works. It
[57:26] wasn't his willpower. It wasn't It was
[57:29] by faith that Enoch was translated.
[57:31] Yeah.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; But the way brother Bam describes it is
[57:35] absolutely amazing to me. He says, "As
[57:37] Enoch walked with God," he just took a
[57:39] stroll one day. And as he's walking
[57:41] along, he says, "Well, you know what? I
[57:42] think you know what? I don't have to
[57:44] die. You know what? I think I've walked
[57:46] so long." And in other places, I'm I'm
[57:49] closer to here than I am there. Instead
[57:50] of going back on home, I think I'll just
[57:52] walk on and be with God. And so, he just
[57:54] strolled on up to God. And you look at
[57:56] this and you think, what in the world is
[57:58] Brother Benham saying? Because Enoch is
[58:00] a type of us, the seventh from Adam.
[58:02] Then we're the seventh from the last
[58:04] Adam. Amen. In the seventh age, there's
[58:06] going to be the same thing take place.
[58:08] There's going to be a translation. And
[58:10] how's it going to come? By faith. Amen.
[58:12] What faith? Faith in the promise of God
[58:14] for our hour as we're walking with God.
[58:17] Amen. We're going to please God because
[58:19] we're going to believe God's word.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; And something's going to happen. And the
[58:23] way brother Ben Brandham makes it sound
[58:25] as he dramatizes this in many places. He
[58:28] he says there was just a realization
[58:30] that came to Enoch. I don't have to die.
[58:33] I can go on home. And he just walked on
[58:35] home. Brother Brandon made it the
[58:37] easiest thing in the whole world.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe when the rapture
[58:42] time comes for the translation of the
[58:44] body, I don't believe it's going to be a
[58:46] strain and a push and a works program
[58:49] and we've got to this and I'm straining
[58:51] and I'm trying. I believe it's going to
[58:52] be the easiest thing that ever happened
[58:55] because by faith he was translating.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about what's going
[58:59] on all around. I don't know what will go
[59:01] on all around. Amen. In the proximity to
[59:04] to the bride to those who are
[59:05] translated. It might be difficult times,
[59:07] but there's going to be a people who are
[59:09] walking with God and a communion with
[59:11] God. And there's going to be a peace in
[59:13] their heart and a revelation. And
[59:15] they're going to be pleasing God because
[59:17] they've accepted his word, received his
[59:19] word, and are letting the word flow
[59:21] through them. And in that communion,
[59:23] there's going to come a time where
[59:24] there'll be a realization. You know
[59:26] what?
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; We don't have to die.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; We don't have to go by the way of the
[59:32] grave. We can just go on up and they're
[59:34] just going to walk on up. They're just
[59:36] going to change. The Adams are going to
[59:37] change. They're going to step from this
[59:39] dimension to another dimension. And it's
[59:41] not going to be strain and push and pull
[59:43] and strive. It's going to be by
[59:45] revelation.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; How? walking with God.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Not the revelation that hits when you're
[59:55] in the world and not the revelation that
[59:57] hits, Amen. when we're off doing our own
[59:59] thing and have our own agenda. But this
[1:00:02] is going to be something that happened
[1:00:03] to Enoch as Enoch was walking with God.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; And as Enoch was walking with God, Amen.
[1:00:09] All of the sudden, the further he walked
[1:00:11] with God, the more real this became to
[1:00:13] him until all of the sudden there come a
[1:00:15] day where he says, "I can go home."
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, praise God. May that be our
[1:00:21] experience and that we start walking
[1:00:22] closer and closer with God.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; He said
[1:00:27] in this message, I started walking down
[1:00:29] the mountain and the snow all drying up.
[1:00:31] This is the Colorado experience he had
[1:00:33] when he spoke to the storm with the hot
[1:00:35] sun steam coming out of my shirt. Just a
[1:00:37] moment or two difference. And I started
[1:00:39] walking down the mountain. And when I
[1:00:40] did, it said, I heard a voice say, why
[1:00:43] don't you walk with me?
[1:00:46] I said, 'Lord, the greatest privilege I
[1:00:49] ever had. I turned and started back down
[1:00:52] through the big deer trails, down
[1:00:53] through the virgin forest.
[1:00:55] God came to him just like an Eden and he
[1:00:59] says, "Why don't you walk with me?" And
[1:01:01] brother said, "That's what I would love
[1:01:03] to do." And the question is, how did
[1:01:07] brother Brandham recognize his presence?
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; What form did he come in?
[1:01:14] How did he walk with him?
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Did he hold another man's hand? Did he
[1:01:20] go arm in arm? How? They were walking
[1:01:22] together. Brother Bam said that virgin
[1:01:24] timber. They were he was walking with
[1:01:25] the Lord. How was the Lord walking with
[1:01:27] him? Brother Bam didn't see anything
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; but he heard his voice
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; and he was walking again with that
[1:01:35] voice. And he was walking in the
[1:01:37] fulfillment of the promise because the
[1:01:39] promise was if you believe and don't
[1:01:41] doubt your heart, if you say to this
[1:01:42] mountain, be plucked up and cast into
[1:01:44] sea. And he had just experience that
[1:01:46] word coming to pass. And God says, "Why
[1:01:48] don't you walk with me?" And he says,
[1:01:50] "Oh God, that's what I want to do." But
[1:01:52] what did he recognize? How did he
[1:01:54] recognize his presence? How did he know
[1:01:56] he was walking with him? Because of his
[1:01:58] voice.
[1:02:01] That's why I believe Enoch didn't see a
[1:02:04] physical form,
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Because Brother Brandham didn't see a
[1:02:07] physical form.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he was walking with the voice.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham made this statement and
[1:02:16] I want to spend some time on this. He
[1:02:18] said, "You live in a three- room house."
[1:02:21] You know that that you say, "I beg your
[1:02:25] pardon. I got 10." No, you haven't. You
[1:02:27] only live in a three- room house.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have three or four
[1:02:30] bedrooms and three or four pantries and
[1:02:32] things like that, but you actually live
[1:02:34] in a three- room house. That is the
[1:02:36] kitchen, the living room, and the
[1:02:37] bedroom. And brother Benham says he he
[1:02:40] goes and he talks about this quite a
[1:02:42] bit. And he says you live in a three-
[1:02:44] room house. And he says you may have
[1:02:45] four bedrooms, but you can only sleep in
[1:02:47] one at a time. You may have a living
[1:02:50] room and a family room or two living
[1:02:51] rooms or whatever you call them parlors
[1:02:53] or lounges or whatever, but really you
[1:02:55] have you have an eating place. Amen. you
[1:02:58] have a fellowship place and you have the
[1:02:59] bedroom, the place of rest.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; And he said, "You live in a three- room
[1:03:04] house." And I'd like to uh look at that
[1:03:06] for a little bit.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Uh as we look on the whiteboard here for
[1:03:10] just a moment.
[1:03:13] And there's some things that became
[1:03:16] started to become reality to me as I
[1:03:18] began
[1:03:21] to look at this.
[1:03:24] He says, now he begins to talk about you
[1:03:27] live in this three- room house. And he
[1:03:29] starts to type it with our relationship
[1:03:31] with the Lord. And he says, you know,
[1:03:33] you've got the kitchen where you eat and
[1:03:35] there's a certain amount of fellowship.
[1:03:36] Then you go into the living room and you
[1:03:37] sit together and you have a more
[1:03:39] intimate fellowship and a time together
[1:03:42] of relaxing together. And then you go
[1:03:44] into the bedroom, which is the most
[1:03:45] intimate of the intimate of
[1:03:47] relationships. And he starts to type
[1:03:49] that with our relationship with the
[1:03:50] Lord. And and before I go into that, I
[1:03:52] just want to look at at this right here.
[1:03:55] If you look
[1:03:58] at the tabernacle tabernacle in the
[1:04:00] wilderness with me
[1:04:06] in the tabernacle in the wilderness,
[1:04:09] you've got three parts to this building,
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; to this construction. You have outer
[1:04:14] court,
[1:04:19] you have inner court,
[1:04:23] sorry,
[1:04:27] and you have
[1:04:31] the holy of holies.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; And so in this three- room house, God
[1:04:40] has a three- room house. When he built a
[1:04:43] tabernacle to dwell in, he put it in
[1:04:44] three parts. And you come in through the
[1:04:47] eastern gate
[1:04:49] and you you move to the west to go
[1:04:51] through this house. You come in east and
[1:04:53] you moved in a direction of west. And
[1:04:56] this is a type, amen,
[1:04:59] of the of the movement of the sun
[1:05:02] from east to west. And the movement of
[1:05:05] the sun from east to west types start
[1:05:08] and finish. Amen.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; The day begins for everybody on the
[1:05:12] earth. No matter where you live on the
[1:05:13] earth, your day begins when the sun
[1:05:15] comes up in the east.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; That's the start of your day. And it
[1:05:18] doesn't matter if it comes up for you a
[1:05:20] different time than it comes up for me.
[1:05:21] The beginning of your day is when the
[1:05:23] sun rises in the east. And the end of
[1:05:24] your day is when the sun sets in the
[1:05:26] west. So this is marking beginning to
[1:05:28] end, first and last, start to finish.
[1:05:30] And so there's a direction you move in
[1:05:32] the tabernacle and you move from east to
[1:05:34] west. Amen. When you come into the outer
[1:05:37] court, the outer court is crowded and
[1:05:39] there's many people in the outer court.
[1:05:40] And there's a lot of coming and going in
[1:05:42] the outer court. And the outer court is
[1:05:44] also exposed to the elements because
[1:05:45] there's no roof on it. There's just a
[1:05:47] barrier around the outside, a curtain
[1:05:49] that separates us from the world. Amen.
[1:05:51] And we begin to move in to this greater
[1:05:53] relationship with the Lord. But there's
[1:05:55] a lot of people involved in that
[1:05:56] relationship. But but as the priest
[1:05:59] would move from the outer court into the
[1:06:01] inner court, Amen. There's much fewer
[1:06:04] people. And now there's a shelter.
[1:06:05] There's a further degree of separation
[1:06:07] from the world. As you go into another
[1:06:10] shelter with the Lord and in there,
[1:06:12] you've got the light from the church
[1:06:14] ages. You got the showbread of
[1:06:15] fellowship. You got the altar of
[1:06:16] incense. Amen. Where you commune with
[1:06:18] the Lord. Amen. But but there was one
[1:06:21] priest once a year who could go beyond
[1:06:23] that next veil and go into the Holy of
[1:06:25] Holies. But he could only go there by
[1:06:28] himself.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Only go there by himself. And what was
[1:06:32] in the holy of holies? It was just the
[1:06:36] throne of God.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; The ark of the covenant. And what would
[1:06:39] he find in there? He would find in there
[1:06:41] the presence of the Lord, the shikina
[1:06:43] glory of God. And I want you to note
[1:06:45] there's no door over here on the western
[1:06:48] side. There's only one door and there's
[1:06:51] only one direction of travel and that
[1:06:53] direction is traveling from the outer
[1:06:55] court to the inner court to the holy of
[1:06:57] holies. So when you look at the
[1:06:59] construction of this house, what was the
[1:07:02] destination of your travel through the
[1:07:04] house? What was the whole purpose? Where
[1:07:06] were you trying to get to and worship to
[1:07:08] God? Amen. Each stage had more worship.
[1:07:11] Coming through the altar of sacrifice,
[1:07:13] coming to the labor of baptism. Amen.
[1:07:15] Moving in to to the the light of the
[1:07:18] ages and to fellowship with God at the
[1:07:19] altar of incense. What is all of this
[1:07:21] bringing us to? It's bringing us into an
[1:07:24] individual relationship with God
[1:07:25] himself.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; God's three- room house was to bring us
[1:07:29] from the outer court to the inner court
[1:07:31] to the Holy of Holies. Amen. And when
[1:07:34] you get to the Holy of Holies, there's
[1:07:36] nobody else in the Holy of Holies, just
[1:07:38] you and God.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; And that's why there's not a back door.
[1:07:43] You can't continue your journey. Where
[1:07:45] do you go past this? How do you climb
[1:07:47] higher than being one with God? That's
[1:07:49] the connection he wanted. That's the
[1:07:51] relationship he wanted. That's what he's
[1:07:53] been trying to get us to, friends.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he showed it all in his three-
[1:07:59] room house.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[1:08:09] Does anybody know what this is?
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; And don't say three circles. I don't
[1:08:14] need any smart.
[1:08:17] Brother Bam showed this was us. body,
[1:08:21] spirit,
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; and soul.
[1:08:28] We live in a three- room house.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; This is us. When it comes to the
[1:08:33] physical, our body, our outside, our
[1:08:35] outer court, our outer man. We come in
[1:08:37] contact with so many people. And this is
[1:08:41] how we begin our journey with the Lord
[1:08:42] because you come in contact with
[1:08:44] somebody. in that contact with somebody
[1:08:45] will share something with us and it will
[1:08:47] hit our ears and we'll see something,
[1:08:49] read a book. We have a contact. Amen.
[1:08:51] And in that body realm, we come in
[1:08:53] contact with so many people just like
[1:08:55] the outer court of the temp temple.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; But then inside of that is a spirit man.
[1:09:00] Amen. And that spirit man is the more
[1:09:02] intimate side of us. Amen. And there's
[1:09:04] fewer people that get to connect with us
[1:09:06] on a spirit level.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; We connect with so many people walking
[1:09:10] through the store. Amen. People see you.
[1:09:12] They're connected to you. You're driving
[1:09:13] around. and you're all over the place.
[1:09:14] There's a there's a broad connection.
[1:09:16] Amen. But when it comes to the spirit
[1:09:18] level, amen, it becomes much narrower of
[1:09:20] a connection.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; There's only a few people who are
[1:09:23] connected with us on that level. But
[1:09:26] when it comes to the soul, Amen. There's
[1:09:28] only one that can go in there, and
[1:09:30] that's God.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; When it comes to the soul, to the core
[1:09:34] of where we are, it's either faith or
[1:09:36] unbelief.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; So, it's either God or not God.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God is the one who has access
[1:09:44] to our souls cuz we live in a three-
[1:09:46] room house. And where does God want to
[1:09:48] get to? He wants to go past just your
[1:09:50] body. He wants to go past just your mind
[1:09:52] and your spirit realm and your emotions.
[1:09:54] He wants to get down to the core and
[1:09:56] essence of who you are where there's a
[1:09:58] part of him there and connect with that.
[1:09:59] He wants to come to the bedroom. He
[1:10:01] wants to come to the soul. He wants to
[1:10:02] come to the maximum level of intimacy
[1:10:04] for you and him.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; He wants to come into your three- room
[1:10:08] house.
[1:10:11] Now I want to look at marriage.
[1:10:18] Marriage
[1:10:20] is friendship,
[1:10:25] courtship
[1:10:28] and union.
[1:10:32] Three parts to the journey
[1:10:35] and marriage
[1:10:37] starts off as friendship. If you make an
[1:10:38] acquaintance and you talk to somebody
[1:10:40] and and as the friendship goes, it
[1:10:43] begins to develop and you're friends
[1:10:45] like everybody else's friends. You have
[1:10:46] the same access to this person everybody
[1:10:48] else has to this person and you talk to
[1:10:50] them like anybody else would talk to
[1:10:51] them. But along the way, amen, there
[1:10:54] becomes a different level of interest.
[1:10:56] And all of a sudden, I don't want to
[1:10:58] stay in the outer court anymore.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; I don't want just the access everybody
[1:11:03] else has. I want a different level of
[1:11:04] access. So, we move from friendship to
[1:11:06] courtship where we declare our intention
[1:11:08] and have that opportunity to move into a
[1:11:11] more intimate relationship where we can
[1:11:13] have private conversation where we can
[1:11:15] begin to get to know each other. We've
[1:11:17] moved from the kitchen to the living
[1:11:18] room.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now we're sitting on the couch
[1:11:22] together comparing notes, talking about
[1:11:24] their future and what we want and what
[1:11:25] we expect and what we love in life and
[1:11:27] our hopes and our dreams and our
[1:11:29] ambitions and all of that. Amen. And and
[1:11:31] you know what? We can go into the uh a
[1:11:34] friendship with many many people. You
[1:11:36] can even have courtship and have more
[1:11:38] people involved because parents are
[1:11:39] involved and maybe a chaperon's involved
[1:11:41] and maybe other people are involved.
[1:11:43] Amen. But when it comes to the third
[1:11:45] step in this union, nobody else is
[1:11:47] involved. It's just you and your spouse
[1:11:49] alone.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is the journey that God
[1:11:54] wants us on. And he's typed it in
[1:11:56] everything around us. Typed it in his
[1:11:58] tabernacle. Amen. Typed it in us. Typed
[1:12:00] it in our marriages. And what does God
[1:12:02] want? God wants us to walk with him
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; alone
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; in the inner chamber. Us in his inner
[1:12:11] chamber behind the veil. In him in us in
[1:12:14] our inner chamber and the soul behind
[1:12:16] the veil.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; I in you and you in me.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; At that day you'll know that I'm in the
[1:12:23] father and the father in me. I in you
[1:12:25] and you in me. Everybody say what day?
[1:12:26] That's this day. That's the seventh from
[1:12:29] Adam. That's the day that he wants us to
[1:12:31] walk with him and him alone.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; We need to move through the tabernacle,
[1:12:38] friends,
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; from outer court. We can come into
[1:12:42] church and have fellowship and that's
[1:12:44] wonderful. And we can be in the outer
[1:12:46] court and our relationship with God here
[1:12:49] with everybody else. Amen. We may even
[1:12:51] be able to go a little deeper and and
[1:12:52] and share some of our h more intimate
[1:12:55] spiritual experiences with other people.
[1:12:57] Maybe a few people. Amen. But there's a
[1:13:00] place that we've got to go beyond that.
[1:13:02] There's a place that we've got to move
[1:13:04] into that third chamber, into that third
[1:13:06] phase in our relationship with God. And
[1:13:08] we've got to move into the marriage
[1:13:09] where nobody can go there with you, just
[1:13:12] you and God alone.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; This is an experience you can't share
[1:13:16] with your spouse. It's an experience you
[1:13:18] can't share with your children. It's an
[1:13:20] experience you can't share with your
[1:13:22] parents. Amen. You can't take anybody
[1:13:24] else into this walk. It's got to be just
[1:13:27] you and God.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:31] Brother Bam says,
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; he says, "Not say my church. My church
[1:13:35] has nothing to do with it." I'm sorry.
[1:13:38] You can't read what I'm reading,
[1:13:41] but I'm going to read it anyways. You'll
[1:13:42] catch up. Amen. Has nothing to do with
[1:13:44] it. It's an individual one person.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; All hell is against this teaching.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; All hell is against this truth, but it
[1:13:56] is the truth. Jesus never said, "Now
[1:13:58] Peter, you and John and all the rest of
[1:13:59] the people, you've got the revelation.
[1:14:01] Now the whole church is saved." No, it
[1:14:03] was to him personally.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; This wasn't about anybody else. That was
[1:14:10] him personally. Amen. And that
[1:14:12] revelation to you personally upon that
[1:14:14] rock I will build my church. What rock?
[1:14:17] The rock of an individual revelation
[1:14:19] from the father of who Jesus Christ is.
[1:14:21] And when you get that revelation from
[1:14:23] the father, you're on the rock.
[1:14:26] But you get there individually. He said,
[1:14:28] "I'll build my church." But he's not
[1:14:30] saying, "I'm going to plant the whole
[1:14:31] church." He's going to plant us
[1:14:33] individually on that rock of revelation.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; It's an individual, not a group. We can
[1:14:41] come into the group and that's how our
[1:14:43] journey begins. And that's absolutely
[1:14:45] wonderful that there's a group of people
[1:14:46] who love God. It was wonderful to come
[1:14:48] into the outer court with people who
[1:14:50] want to worship God. That was
[1:14:52] tremendous. That's exciting. That's
[1:14:54] wonderful. Amen. But there's a further
[1:14:56] step to go. Don't just come in and out
[1:14:58] of the outer court all the time saying
[1:15:00] we're worshiping God. You can go further
[1:15:02] with God than that. You don't have to
[1:15:04] stay there. Amen. You can come into the
[1:15:06] inner court. Amen. Where there's another
[1:15:08] degree of separation where you're not
[1:15:10] tossed about with the wind and the rain
[1:15:12] and the sun and the dark and everything
[1:15:14] that's going out now. There's a light
[1:15:15] that doesn't go out. It's a light of the
[1:15:18] word of God. Amen. There's a fellowship
[1:15:19] of the showbread that's renewed all the
[1:15:22] time. Amen. There's a prayer of incense
[1:15:23] where you're praying to God and he's
[1:15:25] receiving a sacrifice of praise.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; We can go deeper and in there there's
[1:15:31] fewer people that make that journey.
[1:15:33] Amen. From the outer court experience to
[1:15:35] the inner court experience. Amen. And we
[1:15:37] get into that place and the intimacy is
[1:15:39] greater. The things we talk about are
[1:15:42] more wonderful. Amen. We see the same
[1:15:44] things. We talk about the same things.
[1:15:46] We're talking about the light of the
[1:15:48] seven churches is shining in fullness.
[1:15:50] We're talking about the fellowship we
[1:15:52] have together and with God and the
[1:15:53] completion. We're talking about all the
[1:15:56] prayers and the answered prayers and the
[1:15:57] time with the Lord. That's wonderful.
[1:15:59] But don't stop there. There's another
[1:16:01] room beyond that room. There's a place
[1:16:04] we can go. And there's nothing wrong
[1:16:06] with these stages. There's nothing wrong
[1:16:08] with these rooms. Amen. But the real
[1:16:10] goal was not to stop from east to west,
[1:16:13] but it was to go all the way to the
[1:16:15] west. Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; The real goal is to go behind that last
[1:16:20] veil.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; And when you go behind that lost veil,
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; nobody's in there with you.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Not your husband, not your wife, not
[1:16:30] your children, not your parents, not
[1:16:31] your best friend, not the person who
[1:16:33] witnessed the message to you.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Not your pastor, not your favorite
[1:16:37] preacher, not
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Nobody can go in there.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; And it's wonderful to be in the outer
[1:16:44] court. I love it. It's exciting to be
[1:16:46] gathered, moving in. Amen. We're coming
[1:16:49] to worship God. We're recognizing our
[1:16:51] salvation. We're recognizing our baptism
[1:16:53] by the brazen altar and the brazen. It's
[1:16:55] so exciting. Amen. It's exciting to move
[1:16:58] into that next phase with fewer people
[1:16:59] and say, "Did you see that? Did you see
[1:17:01] that? Did you experience this?"
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. There's another step
[1:17:07] beyond that. And that's the step I want
[1:17:09] to take. And that's the place I want to
[1:17:11] remain. I want to go within the veil
[1:17:14] where Jesus has already entered
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; waiting for us to come there.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that we do alone.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And once we've entered there,
[1:17:29] everything's different. Yes.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Even when you enter there,
[1:17:36] the conversation is different
[1:17:39] than it was in the inner court.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Because there's things that take place
[1:17:45] there you can't describe.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; You can't explain.
[1:17:50] You can't make anybody else understand.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Remember when brother Brenham had the
[1:17:55] tent vision, he was throwing the third
[1:17:57] pull, which is the third phase.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. which is the third step.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; And in the third pool, he's caught up in
[1:18:06] a vision and he sees a little room and
[1:18:08] people are entering in and they're going
[1:18:10] in. There's a crowd of people.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; He said they're all in the tent and
[1:18:16] outside the tent. They've come into the
[1:18:18] outer corner. Now there's people lined
[1:18:20] up to go into the room.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; But when they go in the room, they go
[1:18:25] one by one
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; individually. And when they come out the
[1:18:29] other side, Amen. What was in the room?
[1:18:32] The only thing we know that was in there
[1:18:33] is we know that pillar of fire whirled
[1:18:35] down and went into the room and they
[1:18:37] come in contact with the shakina glory
[1:18:38] of God, the pillar of fire, Jesus Christ
[1:18:40] himself. Amen. When they come in contact
[1:18:42] with that, they came out the other side
[1:18:44] and the lady with the tablet who was
[1:18:46] writing down, they said, "What happened
[1:18:47] in there?" And they said, "I don't know.
[1:18:50] I can't explain it.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; This is the place that we have to go. We
[1:18:55] got to go to the place where you may try
[1:18:57] to explain it to somebody. You may try
[1:18:59] to explain your experience with the Lord
[1:19:01] and this is what happened. But every
[1:19:02] time you start to use words, it starts
[1:19:04] to fall flat and you start to try to
[1:19:06] explain it and you start to try to give
[1:19:08] them what's inside of you. Then all of a
[1:19:09] sudden you say, "Well, just never mind.
[1:19:11] You've got to go in yourself."
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; And you might use different words to try
[1:19:15] to describe in a different way, but the
[1:19:16] reality is there's something that takes
[1:19:18] place there that I cannot explain to
[1:19:21] you. Yeah.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; It's like you have so many young people
[1:19:26] have come to me over the years and said,
[1:19:28] "Uh, Brother Chad, I don't understand
[1:19:29] this courtship thing and I don't
[1:19:31] understand. I've tried to do it and I've
[1:19:33] tried this and that and it's amazing.
[1:19:37] The guys don't get it.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; The girls get it instinctively.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; The guys don't get it
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; because they're made different.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; A guy is made mechanical.
[1:19:51] He's a problem solver. He goes step by
[1:19:53] step. A woman is made more emotional.
[1:19:55] She's intuitive. She understands what
[1:19:56] falling in love is. A guy doesn't get
[1:19:59] it. He's never fallen in love. So when I
[1:20:03] say something like friendship,
[1:20:04] courtship, then marriage, he goes,
[1:20:07] "Okay, explain to me friendship. Okay,
[1:20:09] I'm in friendship now. All right, what
[1:20:11] are the parameters? Okay, when do I step
[1:20:13] to this step?"
[1:20:15] And no matter how many times I preach
[1:20:17] it, no matter how many times I discuss
[1:20:19] it, all a guy ever hears is step one,
[1:20:22] step two, step three, I'm married.
[1:20:26] That's all they ever hear. Step one,
[1:20:27] step two, step three. I got it.
[1:20:31] It doesn't work like that. It's a
[1:20:33] natural progression of a real
[1:20:35] relationship.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; It's not something you plan. It's not
[1:20:38] something you meter. It's not staged.
[1:20:40] It's not rules. There's not parameters.
[1:20:42] Not a rule book. Amen. You just find
[1:20:44] yourself in a friendship with somebody
[1:20:46] and all of a sudden you start liking it.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; It's not a formula, friends. It's just
[1:20:52] something that happens to you.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Then you like it better and better and
[1:20:56] then you like it so much other people
[1:20:58] are starting to notice you're liking it
[1:20:59] and then it gets to the awkward place
[1:21:00] where you're like, "Well, I better say
[1:21:02] something to somebody because this is
[1:21:03] the only friend I want to have."
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; So then I have to have a discussion with
[1:21:08] their dad or my parents or whatever cuz
[1:21:10] I'd like to have a deeper friendship.
[1:21:12] Amen. And I like to go into courtship
[1:21:14] because I want to know if this is God's
[1:21:16] plan for the rest of my life. I'm
[1:21:17] feeling something, sensing something,
[1:21:19] but I want to explore this option before
[1:21:21] I make a lifetime commitment.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; And in there, that's not a stage,
[1:21:25] friends. That's not a step. That's not a
[1:21:27] phase. It's a natural progression of a
[1:21:30] natural relationship until the
[1:21:31] relationship grows so strong and the
[1:21:33] intimacy becomes so intimate till you
[1:21:35] say, "I cannot stay in this phase
[1:21:37] anymore. I've got to go to the next
[1:21:40] step."
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got to have this one for life.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; And when somebody's never been to that
[1:21:47] spot,
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; you can't explain it.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; You can't explain it. And when you try
[1:21:56] to explain it, it's so foolish.
[1:21:59] Can you imagine a young man going to He
[1:22:01] says, "I I have a desire to get married.
[1:22:03] How do I get married?" Every time he
[1:22:06] asks that question, he's asking for the
[1:22:08] formula.
[1:22:10] Yeah.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, go talk to somebody and
[1:22:15] find out how they fell in love." So, you
[1:22:18] go talk to 10 different people and you
[1:22:19] get 10 different stories,
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; And you can't figure out the formula.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; They got this before that and this
[1:22:26] happened, that happened, and I don't
[1:22:28] understand it. You don't understand it
[1:22:30] because you've never been behind that
[1:22:31] last veil.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; You've never fallen in love for
[1:22:34] yourself. And as soon as you do, as soon
[1:22:37] as the sparks fly, as soon as your heart
[1:22:39] melts, as soon as something happens to
[1:22:41] you that you didn't make happen, just
[1:22:43] happened to you, all of a sudden you're
[1:22:45] like, I get it now.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; I understand.
[1:22:50] That's what it's like to go behind this
[1:22:52] last fail.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; What's it like to be born again? What's
[1:22:56] it like to have the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:58] Ghost? What should I expect?
[1:23:00] Brother Brandham said, expect a change
[1:23:02] in your life.
[1:23:04] Amen.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; But give me more details what will
[1:23:08] change and how much will change. Listen,
[1:23:10] just keep walking with God.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Can't explain it to you. I can't give
[1:23:15] you the formula. I can't tell you, Amen,
[1:23:17] the steps and the stages and what you
[1:23:20] need to do to get to the next phase. All
[1:23:21] I can tell you is keep moving from east
[1:23:23] to west. Keep going towards that
[1:23:25] chamber. Keep moving towards the Lord.
[1:23:27] Keep moving in a deeper separation.
[1:23:30] getting you further away from the world,
[1:23:32] closer to him, more intimate with him
[1:23:34] all the time. And keep moving as he
[1:23:36] leads until you find yourself behind the
[1:23:38] last veil. And something happens inside
[1:23:41] of you that you can't explain to anybody
[1:23:43] else that you can't put words to, but
[1:23:45] you just know that you've met your
[1:23:47] savior and you're in love with him and
[1:23:48] he loves you.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; It's an individual
[1:23:55] in the third room of the house.
[1:23:58] We've gone behind his veil and he's gone
[1:24:01] behind our veil.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's an individual one person.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; He says all hell is against this.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Why is all hell against this? Because
[1:24:18] you can't control individuals connected
[1:24:20] to God.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; You can control systems. You can control
[1:24:25] denominations. You can control churches.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; All you've got to do is control who's
[1:24:30] ever in charge at the top. You can
[1:24:32] control that. You can control the whole
[1:24:33] system.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; You can control governments. You can
[1:24:36] control denominations. You can control
[1:24:38] churches. You can control businesses.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Wherever there's a structure, you can
[1:24:43] control the time. Then you can control
[1:24:45] everything.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; But you get a bunch of people who is
[1:24:49] connected to God individually. Amen.
[1:24:51] Listen, you can't control that. You
[1:24:53] can't stop it. You can't manipulate it
[1:24:55] because each individual has their own
[1:24:57] walk with God, their own relationship,
[1:24:59] their own revelation.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; That's why if the church blows up and
[1:25:04] the leadership fails, they'll still walk
[1:25:06] with God because they're connected into
[1:25:08] something deeper than church, deeper
[1:25:10] than ministry, deeper than all of those
[1:25:12] things, it's got to be deeper. Or when
[1:25:14] the church fails, you fail. When your
[1:25:16] pastor fails, you fail. When your mom
[1:25:18] fails, you fail. Dad fails. If you fail
[1:25:21] when somebody else fails, it means you
[1:25:22] didn't go behind the veil.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; And if we blame our failure on somebody
[1:25:28] else's failure, it shows we haven't went
[1:25:30] behind the veil.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Because it's an individual, one person,
[1:25:38] you and God.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. When Enoch was raptured,
[1:25:45] when Enoch was translated,
[1:25:48] who went with him?
[1:25:52] Have you ever thought about this?
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Enoch was married.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he had Methusela when
[1:25:59] he's 65 and had sons and daughters.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Where were his sons and daughters?
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Where was his wife?
[1:26:10] Where were his brothers and sisters?
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Where were the rest of the people in his
[1:26:14] church fellowship?
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Where was his best buddy?
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:20] When Enoch was translated, he translated
[1:26:22] by himself.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; And friends, that's how you and I are
[1:26:27] going to translate.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Alone.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; I hope once we meet that translation, we
[1:26:33] meet again on the other side. But the
[1:26:34] pass through is going to be individual.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; It's going to be alone.
[1:26:41] Enoch walked with God and brother said
[1:26:44] he got so far down the road he just
[1:26:46] decided to go on.
[1:26:49] There was something about this
[1:26:51] relationship with God as he walked with
[1:26:53] God. It became more important than every
[1:26:56] other relationship.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; As he walked with God alone, it became
[1:27:02] more powerful than the power of any
[1:27:04] earthly connection.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. How can a man leave his wife and
[1:27:13] his children behind?
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; How can a man walk with God and get so
[1:27:21] far down the road, as brother Benham
[1:27:23] dramatizes, so far down the road that he
[1:27:26] says, "You know what? I'm so far down
[1:27:29] the road. I think I'll just go on."
[1:27:34] And how did that love affair between him
[1:27:37] and God become so real and so strong? He
[1:27:41] didn't say, as he may have said in
[1:27:43] previous days, "No, I better go back. My
[1:27:46] family needs me.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; My wife wouldn't understand, I'm worried
[1:27:51] my kids won't make it without me."
[1:27:58] He got so into this walk with God and
[1:28:03] such in harmony and union began to think
[1:28:05] the way God thinks. When God gave him
[1:28:07] the tug to come home, he responded.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. That means this relationship
[1:28:14] he had with God was far superior to the
[1:28:17] relationship he had with his wife.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; And far superior to the relationship he
[1:28:23] had with his children.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; It's amazing. Friends,
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; I've read about Enoch so many times, but
[1:28:31] when I really go to contemplate
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; him walking away,
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; I'm sure by this time he had
[1:28:37] grandchildren.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; And he could leave his grandchildren.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; You ask him how he had entered to a
[1:28:46] realm of love that was higher than filio
[1:28:47] love.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; He had entered to a place of perfection.
[1:28:51] Amen. That was so much higher. Amen.
[1:28:53] That he was moving and operating in a
[1:28:56] perfect love. And that perfect love had
[1:28:58] a totally different set of understanding
[1:29:00] than the earthly love.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's nothing wrong with us
[1:29:04] feeling for our family and wanting for
[1:29:06] our family and helping our family. Amen.
[1:29:08] But there's got to come a relationship
[1:29:09] that becomes stronger than any filio
[1:29:12] love relationship.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; And and listen, the only way that we can
[1:29:16] help anybody in this world is to walk
[1:29:19] with God.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:22] I say before when the when the when the
[1:29:24] uh when the prodical son comes to his
[1:29:27] father and asks for his inheritance and
[1:29:29] he takes off with his inheritance, the
[1:29:31] father gives it to him and lets the son
[1:29:33] go. Amen. And the father doesn't go to
[1:29:36] the world following his son around
[1:29:37] because he's worried about his son and
[1:29:39] trying to redeem his son by leaving his
[1:29:41] position and becoming like his son.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; The only hope he had for redeeming his
[1:29:46] son was to stay in righteousness and
[1:29:48] stay his position and give his son a
[1:29:49] place to come to. Yeah. Amen.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; We can't stop walking with God to save
[1:29:54] anybody.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Because if we stop walking with God to
[1:29:58] save somebody, then we we will be lost
[1:30:00] ourselves.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; The only hope that the world has, the
[1:30:04] only hope we have for anybody else is to
[1:30:06] walk with God. The only hope that we
[1:30:08] have is to enter behind this veil. And
[1:30:11] you say, "But my wife's not ready."
[1:30:13] Listen, you can't stay out of the veil
[1:30:14] when God's calling you beyond the veil
[1:30:16] because your wife's not ready. You've
[1:30:18] got to walk behind the veil because
[1:30:20] there's nothing that you can do for her.
[1:30:23] This last step, she's got to make
[1:30:25] herself. He's got to make himself. You
[1:30:27] can't stay out of the veil. My son, my
[1:30:29] son's going wayward. I want to stay with
[1:30:31] my son and help my son cross the veil.
[1:30:33] You can't cross that veil arm in arm.
[1:30:36] You can only cross that veil alone.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; And you staying out does nobody any
[1:30:42] good. Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; It doesn't help a soul to say, "But I
[1:30:47] want to stay with my family. I want to
[1:30:49] stay with my son. My wife's not ready.
[1:30:51] My husband's not ready."
[1:30:54] Listen,
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; is God calling?
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Is God calling you beyond the veil? Do
[1:31:02] you hear Jesus who's entered in within
[1:31:04] the veil bidding you to come? Come unto
[1:31:06] me. Come unto me. Do you feel the pull?
[1:31:09] Do you hear him calling? Then you've got
[1:31:11] to move. Amen. from the inner court to
[1:31:13] the Holy of Holies. And you've got to
[1:31:15] make that move by yourself.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Man, it's a shame so many times that
[1:31:25] carnal love we've put more value on than
[1:31:29] the love of God.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; And we've deemed this somehow heroic
[1:31:35] to stay behind and not keep walking with
[1:31:37] God so that we don't leave someone
[1:31:40] behind.
[1:31:42] That's not God's plan. Everybody has an
[1:31:45] individual walk
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; and everybody has an individual time and
[1:31:49] everybody's got to go through this
[1:31:51] three- room house
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; on their own time.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; And we can't speed it up for anybody
[1:31:58] else by stopping it for ourselves.
[1:32:01] We've got to walk with the Lord.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was told this. said
[1:32:09] there he stood talking to me and he said
[1:32:11] but you walk with too many. He
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; said to walk with me you walk alone.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Listen there should be
[1:32:25] there should be a part of your spiritual
[1:32:27] life
[1:32:29] between you and God
[1:32:32] that your wife can't even enter into
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; or your husband can't enter into. And it
[1:32:38] doesn't mean you don't want them to. And
[1:32:39] it doesn't mean there's separation. But
[1:32:42] there's something more that you can't
[1:32:45] explain in the natural. That's right.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. You want to serve the Lord arm in-
[1:32:50] arm. Absolutely. But a man and a woman
[1:32:52] have to have their individual connection
[1:32:54] to God.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; And that's what makes a family strong.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; And there there there should be a part
[1:33:01] of your love relationship with the Lord
[1:33:04] that you can't even fully explain to
[1:33:06] your wife. And there should be a love
[1:33:07] relationship between her and the Lord
[1:33:09] she can't even fully explain to you. And
[1:33:12] we shouldn't be jealous of each other's
[1:33:14] walk with God.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; And we shouldn't be intimidated when we
[1:33:18] see our wives have a connection with
[1:33:20] God.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; And God reveals something to them and
[1:33:23] they pray and God answers their prayer.
[1:33:24] We shouldn't be intimidated by that,
[1:33:26] brothers. We should thank God for that.
[1:33:28] That's what makes a strong family.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Now, what makes a family that's not
[1:33:32] going to get off the rails? That's going
[1:33:33] to make a family. Amen. where each one
[1:33:35] is led by the spirit of God. But
[1:33:37] sisters, you shouldn't get intimidated
[1:33:39] just because your husband has a
[1:33:40] relationship with the Lord that you
[1:33:41] can't enter into and he can't explain to
[1:33:43] you and you see the connection and you
[1:33:45] can't enter in with him. Don't get
[1:33:47] intimidated with that. Praise God.
[1:33:49] Because that's a relationship that you
[1:33:50] need. If he's going to be your headship,
[1:33:52] you need him to have a relationship
[1:33:54] that's greater than his relationship
[1:33:55] with you.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; So that your emotions doesn't change his
[1:34:00] headship.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; That's what we want.
[1:34:04] We shouldn't get intimidated when we see
[1:34:06] our brothers and sisters have their own
[1:34:08] walk with God
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; and they can go beyond us spiritually.
[1:34:11] We should encourage that. Amen. We
[1:34:13] shouldn't try to put them under us and
[1:34:15] well, you just said that because and
[1:34:16] you're just always No, we should thank
[1:34:18] God that they have a walk with God.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; That they can go behind the veil and
[1:34:22] they've got a connection with God that
[1:34:24] maybe I can't even comprehend and they
[1:34:26] explain it. It sounds amen beyond my
[1:34:28] understanding. It may even sound
[1:34:29] stronger than my relationship with the
[1:34:31] Lord, but I can't help that. And I can't
[1:34:33] enter in there. I've got to enter in
[1:34:35] with him alone.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; And have my own unique relationship.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:41] The apostle Paul in Galatians, he says,
[1:34:44] "But when it pleased God, who separated
[1:34:45] me from my mother's womb and call me by
[1:34:47] his grace to reveal his son in me that I
[1:34:50] might preach him among the heathen,
[1:34:52] immediately I conferred not with flesh
[1:34:53] and blood, neither went I up to
[1:34:55] Jerusalem to them which were apostles
[1:34:57] before me. But I went into Arabia, and I
[1:34:59] returned again into Damascus."
[1:35:02] What did God do with Paul when Paul
[1:35:04] first was converted and met the pillar
[1:35:06] of fire? God immediately took him to the
[1:35:07] wilderness
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; to be alone,
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; to come in contact with Jesus Christ
[1:35:12] alone and to deal with him alone. And
[1:35:14] that became the foundation of his whole
[1:35:16] ministry.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; I when when Paul was smitten down to the
[1:35:22] ground by a pillar of fire and a voice
[1:35:24] from heaven. Amen. There was other men
[1:35:26] with him.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; He wasn't alone.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; But I want to read two accounts out of
[1:35:31] the book of Acts of this. Acts nine
[1:35:33] says, "And the men which journeyed with
[1:35:35] him stood speechless, hearing a voice,
[1:35:37] but seeing no man."
[1:35:40] Then in another place they said, "And
[1:35:42] they that were with me saw indeed the
[1:35:44] light and were afraid, but they heard
[1:35:46] not the voice of him that spoke to me."
[1:35:50] They heard something, but they didn't
[1:35:51] see a man. And another account, they saw
[1:35:53] a light, but they didn't hear the voice.
[1:35:56] Amen.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; That means they were there when Paul had
[1:36:00] his experience with Jesus Christ.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; But they could not understand what Paul
[1:36:06] understood and they didn't get out of it
[1:36:08] what Paul got out of it.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; It was individual to Paul. Even though
[1:36:16] they were there when it happened and
[1:36:18] they were all struck to the ground, but
[1:36:20] there was only one who knew that that
[1:36:22] was Jesus Christ. And there was only one
[1:36:24] who heard what the voice says. They saw
[1:36:26] something. They saw a light. They heard
[1:36:28] something, but they didn't hear the
[1:36:30] voice of him. Amen. They had an
[1:36:32] experience when he had an experience,
[1:36:34] but his experience was special and
[1:36:36] unique to Paul alone. And he's the only
[1:36:39] one that saw Christ and heard Christ and
[1:36:42] understood the message.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter who's with you.
[1:36:47] Amen. You could sit in the same church
[1:36:49] service and everybody can hear things
[1:36:50] and see things and and experience things
[1:36:52] on a different level, but you can hear
[1:36:54] preaching and everybody can walk out and
[1:36:56] they can walk out and say, "Listen, I've
[1:36:58] had it happen in the forer, brother
[1:37:00] Chad. You don't know that was for me."
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; There was a part there where everything
[1:37:05] you said was exactly what I was praying
[1:37:08] about.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Same service, somebody else will say,
[1:37:11] "Brother Chad, that was for me. That's
[1:37:12] what me and my wife were talking about
[1:37:14] last night." Listen,
[1:37:16] you compare notes and you say, "This
[1:37:18] message was for me." You said, "No, it
[1:37:20] was for me." You say, "Well, this was
[1:37:22] the best part of the sermon." No, this
[1:37:23] was the best part of the sermon. They
[1:37:25] both heard and they saw. Amen. But there
[1:37:27] was something individual to you in every
[1:37:30] service, in every book, in every tape,
[1:37:32] every time you read your Bible, every
[1:37:34] time you pray, there's a relationship
[1:37:36] that's just for you. There's something
[1:37:38] that's just for you alone. And no matter
[1:37:40] how much you explain it, other people
[1:37:42] listen, you may have a prayer request.
[1:37:44] You may have a desire in your heart. You
[1:37:46] may have a question that you've been
[1:37:47] praying about and you've shared it with
[1:37:49] nobody. And all of a sudden, right over
[1:37:51] the pull pit comes, bang, bang, bang.
[1:37:53] That's exactly what I was praying about.
[1:37:55] And you can go out with enthusiasm and
[1:37:57] tell somebody else and they'll say, "Oh,
[1:37:59] that's so nice."
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; But there's no way they can understand
[1:38:03] what's happening inside of you. God just
[1:38:05] spoke to you. God just answered your
[1:38:07] question. God just gave you exactly what
[1:38:10] you were looking for. And for you, it's
[1:38:12] the greatest thing that ever happened.
[1:38:13] for somebody else. That's exciting.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; I'm happy for you.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; That's wonderful.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; And after you've explained it two or
[1:38:21] three times, you said, "I'm not going to
[1:38:22] explain it to nobody else."
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; They just don't get it.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; And the truth is, they can't get it.
[1:38:27] That was you behind the veil. That was
[1:38:29] God whispering in your ear because it's
[1:38:31] love secrets to you as an individual.
[1:38:34] He's whispering the answer back to you.
[1:38:37] Everybody else heard the same words.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:41] But to you, it was a personal meeting
[1:38:43] with you and God.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love it, friends.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; I love it so much.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Then look at second Timothy 4 said, "In
[1:38:57] my first answer, no man stood with me,
[1:38:59] but all men forsook me."
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Here comes Paul towards the end of his
[1:39:05] ministry. He started off alone with God.
[1:39:09] Guess where he's going to wind up at the
[1:39:10] end?
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Alone with God.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; I pray God that it may not be laid to
[1:39:16] their charge. Notwithstanding, the Lord
[1:39:18] stood with me and strengthened me, that
[1:39:21] by me the preaching might be fully
[1:39:23] known, and that all the Gentiles might
[1:39:24] hear, and I was delivered out of the
[1:39:26] mouth of the lion, and the Lord shall
[1:39:28] deliver me from every evil work, and
[1:39:29] will preserve me into his heavenly
[1:39:31] kingdom, to whom be glory forever and
[1:39:33] ever. Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Who was Paul depending on? Yeah.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Not any of his companions on earth. Not
[1:39:42] any of his fellow ministers, not anybody
[1:39:45] who walked with him and talked with him
[1:39:46] and helped him. Listen, they went
[1:39:48] through some stuff together.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Those who traveled with Paul, they went
[1:39:51] through some things together and some
[1:39:53] hardships. But there come a time when
[1:39:55] Paul had to walk a part of his journey
[1:39:57] all by himself and all forsook me and no
[1:39:59] one stood with me, but the Lord stood
[1:40:01] with me.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Listen, there's times, friends, you can
[1:40:04] be surrounded by people. You can go to a
[1:40:06] church with 200 other people and you
[1:40:08] feel absolutely isolated and all by
[1:40:11] yourself like nobody understands and
[1:40:13] nobody's standing with me and nobody can
[1:40:16] comfort me in my pain and nobody can
[1:40:17] take my pain away and nobody can
[1:40:19] understand what I'm going through. And
[1:40:21] that's absolutely the truth. And we
[1:40:23] wonder why do we get in those positions
[1:40:25] sometimes? It's because God wants to
[1:40:27] deal with you as an individual. He wants
[1:40:30] to come and be your deliverer. He wants
[1:40:32] to be your comforter. He wants to be
[1:40:34] your prince of peace. He wants to show
[1:40:36] that it's me and you together. If all
[1:40:38] forsake you, I will not forsake you.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; God's constantly bringing us into a
[1:40:46] relationship with himself.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:34, I tell you, in that night
[1:40:53] there shall be two men in one bed. One
[1:40:56] shall be taken and the other shall be
[1:40:58] left. Two women shall be grinding
[1:41:01] together. The one shall be taken and the
[1:41:02] other left.
[1:41:04] Two men shall be in the field. The one
[1:41:06] shall be taken and the other left.
[1:41:10] This is discussing the translation and
[1:41:13] the rapture.
[1:41:15] We know that this starts way back when
[1:41:18] we first hear the message because the
[1:41:21] beginning of the rapture is a shout to
[1:41:23] gather the elect together.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; And in that gathering, there's already
[1:41:27] been separation.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; There was two who heard, but one
[1:41:31] followed.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. you and a friend or you and a
[1:41:34] family member or you and whatever. But
[1:41:36] there was one who came out from among
[1:41:38] her.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; But the separation continues
[1:41:44] because your translation is not
[1:41:46] dependent on my revelation.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; My revelation won't change your Adams.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; My revelation will change my Adams.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Your revelation will change your Adams.
[1:41:59] Your revelation will not translate your
[1:42:01] children.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Your revelation will not translate your
[1:42:06] spouse.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; It's got to be a personal individual
[1:42:11] revelation ourselves.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; When we come to the translation of the
[1:42:15] body and the change of the atoms, it'll
[1:42:17] be one by one with nobody else.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; I'll take one and I'll leave one.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:28] Brother Rem says in Christ is the
[1:42:29] mystery. He said his presence in the
[1:42:31] individual
[1:42:33] with a personal vindication of himself
[1:42:35] expressing himself the living word
[1:42:37] that's promised for the day expressing
[1:42:40] itself through you. A vindication of the
[1:42:42] great revelation of God. Look only in an
[1:42:44] individual. Never in a group. An
[1:42:46] individual. Not in a group. His
[1:42:48] identification is with an individual.
[1:42:51] Not with the Methodists, not with the
[1:42:52] Baptist, not with the Presbyterian, not
[1:42:54] the Lutheran, not the Pentecostals, but
[1:42:56] as an individual. I'll take one and I'll
[1:42:58] leave one. I'll separate them. That's
[1:43:00] right. There'll be two in the field.
[1:43:02] I'll take one and leave one. There'll be
[1:43:03] two in the bed. I'll take one and leave
[1:43:05] one. It's not a group. It's a personal
[1:43:09] vindication of a pregnantated child of
[1:43:11] God filled with the Holy Ghost, so
[1:43:13] surrendered to God that he don't care
[1:43:15] about anything else.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:20] Can I highlight that?
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; So surrendered to God, he don't care
[1:43:26] about anything else.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Enoch got to this place.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit living its life
[1:43:33] pulsating through him, showing the
[1:43:35] personal vindication of the word itself,
[1:43:37] expressing itself to the people and to
[1:43:40] the world.
[1:43:41] Enoch come into a personal relationship
[1:43:44] with God himself.
[1:43:46] And that personal relationship wasn't
[1:43:47] group. It wasn't family. But I don't
[1:43:50] believe that that personal relationship
[1:43:51] made him a bad husband.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; He didn't forsake his wife and say,
[1:43:57] "Listen, I'm I'm dealing with the Lord.
[1:43:59] You leave me alone."
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; He didn't become so spiritual that he
[1:44:04] stopped being a daddy.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; He didn't become so high in his
[1:44:09] revelation that he stopped being a good
[1:44:11] friend
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; or a good neighbor.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Or a good citizen. Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; I think Enoch was the best daddy.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; But I think his fear of God and his
[1:44:20] relationship with God made him a better
[1:44:21] father,
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; made him a better husband, made him a
[1:44:24] better neighbor. I don't think he became
[1:44:26] so spiritually minded that he was of no
[1:44:28] earthly good.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; I don't think this personal relationship
[1:44:32] we have with the Lord Jesus Christ will
[1:44:34] make us deficient as a husband.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; I don't think it'll make us absent and
[1:44:40] negligent. Yeah,
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; I don't think it'll make us negligent as
[1:44:44] fathers and as friends and as coworker.
[1:44:46] I don't think I don't think it's that
[1:44:48] kind of relationship. I think it's a
[1:44:49] relationship nobody else can enter into.
[1:44:51] But that relationship brings me into the
[1:44:53] life of Jesus Christ. Amen. And he was a
[1:44:55] good friend and he was a good brother
[1:44:57] and he was a good neighbor.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; But he was a good son.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; And I believe that Enoch got so
[1:45:06] surrendered to to God that he didn't
[1:45:08] care about anything else. Everything
[1:45:10] else comes secondary.
[1:45:12] Not that he was a bad father, but that
[1:45:15] God became his all in all.
[1:45:18] Brother Bham says, "But all this mystery
[1:45:20] is revealed only as he promised to his
[1:45:22] bride. Hell is against this truth of the
[1:45:25] revelation of this mystery. But the
[1:45:27] bride is standing on it. That's her
[1:45:29] stand."
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Why do you hunger, church? Why do you
[1:45:33] thirst? It's the father trying to reveal
[1:45:36] this hidden secret to you. But you let
[1:45:40] so many things get it out of you. You
[1:45:42] let your job, you let your wife, you let
[1:45:45] your husband, you let your children, you
[1:45:47] let the cares of the world, you let some
[1:45:49] pastor, you let somebody else get that
[1:45:51] out of you. When when you know that way
[1:45:53] down in your heart, you're thirsting,
[1:45:56] hungry. It's God trying to reveal it to
[1:45:59] you. See the revelation, the last day is
[1:46:01] here. What is it? We're hungering for
[1:46:04] him and for this revelation with him to
[1:46:06] enter in behind the veil. Amen. that we
[1:46:08] can let so many other relationships take
[1:46:11] it out of us.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; But there's got to be one relationship
[1:46:16] that means more than anything else to
[1:46:17] us. And I think that's the relationship
[1:46:20] that will affect all other
[1:46:22] relationships.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Beam says, "In a shame, let me
[1:46:29] speak to you as dying mortal that
[1:46:31] someday you've got to come to the end of
[1:46:33] this life. And I may not be there and
[1:46:35] another preacher may not be there but
[1:46:37] there is only one who can meet you there
[1:46:40] and that's God. And you listen to it and
[1:46:43] not whether my wife is a good Christian
[1:46:44] or my husband is a good Christian but I
[1:46:47] am I right with God. Have I met God like
[1:46:50] that? Not because my pastor met God or
[1:46:52] because my deacon met God but have I met
[1:46:55] him not because I shouted, not because I
[1:46:57] spoke in tongues, but because I met him
[1:46:59] as a person.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you'll never be ashamed of
[1:47:03] that. There is something that is so
[1:47:06] perfect and pure and true.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; We'll never be afraid to cross death's
[1:47:12] gate
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; when we've met him personally.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; We'll never be afraid of the rapture
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; when we've met him personally.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Never be afraid of the journey and this
[1:47:25] life coming to an end and a transition
[1:47:27] to the next life because we met him
[1:47:30] personally.
[1:47:31] Because there's a transition if if if if
[1:47:34] we don't go in the translation of the
[1:47:36] body in the next so many years. Amen.
[1:47:38] There's many among us who's going to
[1:47:40] transition to the sixth dimension.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; And you transition alone
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; by yourself
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; without anybody else. And how are you
[1:47:50] going to make it? Because you've walked
[1:47:52] with him. He'll walk you across Jordan.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; He'll not leave you nor forsake you.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:01] Brother Bram says, "He that loveth not
[1:48:04] knoweth not God, for God is love."
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; I want to leave you with this thought.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; I believe what Enoch came to was the
[1:48:13] capstone of love.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Perfect love.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Pure love. He was the seventh from uh
[1:48:20] Adam. He had come to a perfect
[1:48:23] realization as a son of God into a
[1:48:25] perfect relationship with God until he
[1:48:27] actually was a foreshadow of the rapture
[1:48:29] in our day.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; And he was translated by faith and
[1:48:33] showing what path we're going to walk.
[1:48:34] But we know and to get to this place,
[1:48:36] we've got to come to the stature of a
[1:48:38] perfect man. We got to climb from faith,
[1:48:40] amen, to temperance into all these
[1:48:41] things until we finally come to the
[1:48:43] capstone which is love.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Which is God himself.
[1:48:50] We climb to this capping off of us in
[1:48:53] perfect love. And this perfect love is
[1:48:56] so different than filio love.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; The reason I believe Enoch came to
[1:49:00] perfect love is because when he came to
[1:49:02] this kind of love, he could walk out of
[1:49:05] the earth and leave his wife and
[1:49:07] children behind.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; You say that doesn't sound like love. No
[1:49:12] friends, this is perfect love. Amen.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Not human love, not emotional love, not
[1:49:18] filio love, but perfect love and love is
[1:49:20] God. He got to the place where he began
[1:49:22] to understand like God understands.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; He began to love like God loves and see
[1:49:28] like God sees. To the place where he
[1:49:31] understood, I can go on because God's
[1:49:33] got a plan for everyone and everything's
[1:49:35] under his control and all things work
[1:49:37] together. I'm not leaving them. I'm
[1:49:40] going the way God's called me to go
[1:49:41] because God has a plan for them. Amen.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Perfect love brings us to a place where
[1:49:46] there's no anxiety. There's no fear.
[1:49:49] There's no heartbreak. You've come into
[1:49:50] perfect love. Perfect love is perfect
[1:49:52] realization of God. And God does all
[1:49:55] things well. And if God was calling
[1:49:58] Enoch home, Enoch come to the place
[1:50:00] where he realized if he's calling me
[1:50:02] home, the best place for me to be his
[1:50:04] home. The best place for my wife is for
[1:50:06] me to be home. The best place for my
[1:50:08] children is for me to go home.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Because God's will is perfect. God's
[1:50:13] word is perfect. And if he wants me to
[1:50:15] go, the best thing I can do for them is
[1:50:18] to go.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Not to stay,
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; this love is so different than human
[1:50:25] love.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; It's so it's it's magnitudes beyond
[1:50:30] human love.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; It's a perfect realization. Brother
[1:50:35] Brandham when he went beyond the curtain
[1:50:36] of time says and I heard a voice then
[1:50:38] that spoke to me that was in the room
[1:50:41] said this is what you preached was the
[1:50:42] Holy Ghost. This is perfect love and
[1:50:45] nothing can enter here without it.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Nothing can enter into the sixth
[1:50:51] dimension without perfect love.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; I am more determined than ever in my
[1:50:55] life that it takes perfect love to enter
[1:50:57] there. There was no jealousy. There was
[1:51:00] no tiredness. There was no death.
[1:51:01] Sickness could never in never enter
[1:51:04] there. Mortality could never make you
[1:51:06] old. And they could not cry. It was just
[1:51:08] one joy. Oh my precious brother. Look at
[1:51:12] this experience. I'm going to read a
[1:51:13] couple more quotes in this experience
[1:51:14] brother Brandham had. But brother, when
[1:51:17] you pass between here and yonder, it
[1:51:19] ain't that way there. Oh my. It's it's
[1:51:22] impossible. It's all love. Everything is
[1:51:25] real brother and everything's real
[1:51:27] sister. There's no death, no sorrow, no
[1:51:30] jealousy, no nothing. Nothing can enter
[1:51:32] there. It's just perfection. That's what
[1:51:34] I'm striving for. That's what I'm
[1:51:36] placing for I'm placing for. I said,
[1:51:39] Lord, that's what I'm here at the church
[1:51:41] for, trying to set the church in order.
[1:51:43] Telling you, brother and sister, there's
[1:51:45] only one thing that can enter there.
[1:51:47] That's perfect love. Not because you're
[1:51:49] loyal to the Brandham Tabernacle or the
[1:51:51] Methodist Church or the Baptist Church.
[1:51:53] Them's all right. You should be. But oh
[1:51:56] friends, not because you spoke with
[1:51:58] tongues, danced in the spirit, because
[1:52:00] you cast out devils or moved mountains
[1:52:02] with faith, that's all right for that's
[1:52:04] all right. But still, unless that real
[1:52:07] perfect love is in there, that was where
[1:52:09] perfect love was. And that's the only
[1:52:12] thing that'll let you in there. That's
[1:52:14] the only thing that can stay there. It's
[1:52:16] the only thing there was there. Oh my,
[1:52:19] it's an adoption.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; When we come to adoption, we've got to
[1:52:24] come to the capstone. perfect love.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Bham said in the
[1:52:27] sixth dimension when you enter into
[1:52:28] perfect love, you've come into an
[1:52:30] adoption because you've come to the
[1:52:31] capping. You've come to God himself.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; And when brother Brandham entered into
[1:52:38] that realm,
[1:52:39] he says, I thought, now this is strange.
[1:52:43] I turned back around and I looked and
[1:52:45] there laid right there and there was my
[1:52:47] wife laying there on the bed and said,
[1:52:49] now you know what? I died. I said,
[1:52:52] that's what's happened. I've died.
[1:52:56] And he wasn't upset.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; He looked back and he says, "I wasn't
[1:53:03] 20t from where I was laying. He was
[1:53:04] looking at his body. And next to him in
[1:53:07] the bed was his wife, who he loved
[1:53:09] dearly. Probably loved more than he
[1:53:11] loved anything else on this earth.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; And he said, "hm, I died."
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Oh, my poor wife. Oh,
[1:53:20] God, let me go back. Oh, she can't
[1:53:21] handle this.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; He had entered into perfect love.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; And in perfect love, he knew everything
[1:53:29] is okay.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Everything is fine. Listen, we can't
[1:53:33] understand that in the form we're in
[1:53:34] right now. We can't comprehend that. If
[1:53:36] you take me and separate me from my wife
[1:53:38] and see her laying there and say, "Now
[1:53:39] you're dead. You got to separate." I
[1:53:40] said, "No, no, let let me go back. If I
[1:53:42] go with the mind I have now and the
[1:53:44] feelings I have now, let me go take care
[1:53:45] of her. She's going to be heartbroken. I
[1:53:47] don't want to see her cry. I don't want
[1:53:48] her to suffer." But when you enter into
[1:53:50] that realm, it's totally different. In
[1:53:53] perfect love, you say, "God does
[1:53:54] everything perfect and everything well
[1:53:56] and everything's okay." And hey, I died
[1:53:58] and there's my wife.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; I don't mean to make a joke out of, but
[1:54:03] listen, folks. Look at his tone of
[1:54:05] voice. It He wasn't mourning. He wasn't
[1:54:07] sad. He wasn't afraid. Amen. There was
[1:54:09] no fear. There was no anxiety. There was
[1:54:12] no heartbreak. He said, "You couldn't
[1:54:13] cry. There was nothing but joy." He knew
[1:54:15] he'd enter into a realm of perfect love.
[1:54:17] And in perfect love, her suffering was
[1:54:19] going to be okay. It wasn't breaking his
[1:54:22] heart because he had enter into where
[1:54:23] God was.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us get to this place. Help
[1:54:30] us get to this place.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham goes to the bedside of
[1:54:35] his wife, his first wife, who's dying.
[1:54:38] She's dying alone in a makeshift
[1:54:40] hospital, laying on a cot because of
[1:54:43] flooding that took place all over the
[1:54:45] Ohio Valley, separated from her husband,
[1:54:47] separated from her babies. And she dies
[1:54:49] all alone. Amen.
[1:54:52] And he finally finds her after she
[1:54:54] passed away. And he ran to her c. And he
[1:54:57] began to pray, "Oh God, oh God." And he
[1:54:59] starts calling for her to come back.
[1:55:03] And he says, this is in his life story.
[1:55:05] He says, "God, I know I've been wrong,
[1:55:07] but if you'll just let her speak to me
[1:55:09] one more time, will you, Lord, please
[1:55:12] let her speak?" Listen, I want you to
[1:55:14] look at the different perspective from
[1:55:16] him that's on earth and her that's
[1:55:18] entered into perfect love.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "Please let her talk to me one
[1:55:23] more time. Please don't let her go.
[1:55:25] Please, Lord."
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; And while I was praying, I looked. If I
[1:55:29] live to be a hundred years old, I'll
[1:55:31] never forget that. Those big dark eyes
[1:55:33] opened up and she looked at me. She
[1:55:35] motioned for me to get down. I looked at
[1:55:37] her. I said, "Sweetheart, you're all
[1:55:38] right, aren't you?"
[1:55:41] She said, "Why did you call me, Bill?"
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Not, "Thank you for bringing me back.
[1:55:47] I'm so lonely without you. I want to
[1:55:49] stay with you in my B." No. Why did you
[1:55:51] call me back, Bill? This is what walking
[1:55:54] with God will produce. This is the
[1:55:55] destination, friends, where everything's
[1:55:58] okay. Where everything's perfect, where
[1:56:00] God does all things well.
[1:56:04] She entered in there. Why did you call
[1:56:06] me, Bill? Why did you call me? I said,
[1:56:10] what do you mean?
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Look at these two different
[1:56:12] perspectives. I say, oh God, I want to
[1:56:14] walk with you till I enter into that
[1:56:16] perspective in life.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; What do you mean? She said, "Oh, I was
[1:56:22] so easy." She'd been suffering so hard.
[1:56:26] I said, "What do you mean easy, honey?"
[1:56:28] She said, "Well," she said, "Bill, you
[1:56:29] know I'm going, don't you?" I said, 'N
[1:56:32] no. She said, 'I am.' And she said,
[1:56:35] 'Bill, I don't mind it.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; He was minding it.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; He was scared.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; He was heartbroken. She'd entered to a
[1:56:45] place where there was no more
[1:56:46] heartbreak, no more fear, no more
[1:56:48] anxiety.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Friends, I want you to see this is the
[1:56:52] destination.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; This is where we're coming to. And I
[1:56:56] believe our walk with the Lord is going
[1:56:57] to bring us there. And even if we don't
[1:56:59] fully realize it till we translate,
[1:57:00] we're going to get closer and closer and
[1:57:02] closer and closer
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; as we move with the Lord. Why? Because
[1:57:06] we've got to come to a stature of a
[1:57:07] perfect man. And we've got to move in
[1:57:09] the capstone of this kind of love.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Then she says further down she said
[1:57:16] another thing I want you to promise me.
[1:57:19] I said what's that? She said that you
[1:57:23] won't live single.
[1:57:25] I said, 'Oh, Hope, don't please, please
[1:57:27] don't ask me, honey. She said, 'Look,
[1:57:30] Bill, said, 'I'm in heaven. There'll be
[1:57:32] no marriage or given in marriage.' She
[1:57:34] said, and I got two little babies here
[1:57:36] I'm leaving you with. She said, I don't
[1:57:39] mind going, but I hate to leave you.
[1:57:41] Said, I hate to leave Billy and Paul and
[1:57:43] Sharon. She said, "But Billy, if they're
[1:57:45] raised up and you in the ministry and
[1:57:47] they be pulled about from pillar to
[1:57:48] post," she said, "find some good girl,
[1:57:50] some good girl that's got the Holy
[1:57:52] Ghost, and let her be in my place as a
[1:57:54] mother."
[1:57:57] I cannot imagine
[1:58:00] a woman saying that. She's in her 20s,
[1:58:03] only been married a couple years,
[1:58:04] looking at her young husband and saying,
[1:58:07] "Bill, get married. Promise me that you
[1:58:10] won't stay single, that you'll marry.
[1:58:12] Promise me there's two babies there in
[1:58:13] you. And I hate leaving you like that,
[1:58:15] but I'm happy to go. But promise me that
[1:58:18] you'll take some other woman and she can
[1:58:20] replace me as a mother.
[1:58:23] This is a different kind of love.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; This is a different kind of love. This
[1:58:29] is the kind of love I want to walk into.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; No jealousy,
[1:58:34] no anxiety, no fear,
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; no pride,
[1:58:39] just perfect love.
[1:58:41] say, "God,
[1:58:43] help me."
[1:58:46] Brother Ram goes on to say in the fifth
[1:58:48] seal, "So then, but however, there was
[1:58:51] Fritz
[1:58:53] standing there licking me on the hand."
[1:58:55] Y'all know who Fritz is? His dog,
[1:58:58] his coonhound.
[1:59:00] Fritz standing there licking me on the
[1:59:01] hand. I couldn't cry. Nobody could cry.
[1:59:06] It was all joy. You couldn't be sad
[1:59:09] because it was all happiness. You
[1:59:10] couldn't die because it was all life.
[1:59:13] You couldn't get old because it was all
[1:59:15] youth. See, it was just perfect. I
[1:59:19] thought, "Oh, isn't this wonderful?" And
[1:59:23] millions, oh my, I was right at home.
[1:59:25] See, and just then I heard a voice and
[1:59:26] it cried out and said, "All that you've
[1:59:28] ever loved, reward for my service. I
[1:59:31] don't need no reward." He said, "All
[1:59:32] that you ever loved and all that ever
[1:59:34] loved you, God has given to you." I
[1:59:38] said, "Praise the Lord." I felt funny. I
[1:59:39] thought, "What's the matter?" I felt
[1:59:41] funny. I turned around and looked and on
[1:59:43] the bed, my body was moving. I said, "I
[1:59:45] don't have to go back. Surely, don't let
[1:59:49] me go."
[1:59:51] But the gospel had to be preached. In
[1:59:53] just a second, I was on the bed again.
[1:59:55] See, like that.
[1:59:59] Here's a man
[2:00:01] looking back and seeing his wife on the
[2:00:03] bed next to him, and he thinks, "Oh,
[2:00:04] I've died."
[2:00:06] He's looking around and there's you
[2:00:07] can't he said you can't be sad.
[2:00:10] You can't be
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; it's impossible.
[2:00:14] It's not this is not a self-help like
[2:00:16] don't be sad. You couldn't be sad.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; You couldn't fear. You couldn't have any
[2:00:22] anxiety. You couldn't be nervous.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; You couldn't be upset.
[2:00:28] and he looks back and he sees his wife
[2:00:30] and he feels something funny and he sees
[2:00:31] his body moving in bed and he and he
[2:00:33] says, "I don't have to go back.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; His wife's laying there.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; She's getting ready to wake up and
[2:00:40] realize he's dead. She's going to
[2:00:42] probably cry, scream, call for the
[2:00:44] paramedics. Then his children will be
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; But he'd enter into a realm that was so
[2:00:50] much higher."
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't don't let me go." He
[2:00:55] doesn't want to go back. He wasn't
[2:00:56] begging to go back. He didn't want to
[2:00:58] go.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Hope wasn't begging to go back.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; She wanted to pass on.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go backwards in my walk
[2:01:07] with God. I want to keep moving till I
[2:01:09] strike this.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; I want to move higher in my revelation
[2:01:13] closer to him more into perfect love
[2:01:15] until I get to the place where if I have
[2:01:17] to walk alone, I can't save anybody by
[2:01:20] bailing out on God and going, I got to
[2:01:22] walk with God and everything's going to
[2:01:23] work out right.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what did brother Benham
[2:01:26] realize in that moment? Listen, when
[2:01:28] when Fritz come up and licked his hand
[2:01:30] and Prince come over his shoulder and
[2:01:32] knickered his saddle horse and his dog.
[2:01:36] Remember when Fritz died?
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Remember when the sheriff fed him a dog
[2:01:41] button, poisoned him and killed him? And
[2:01:43] Brother Man was so heartbroken and so
[2:01:45] upset and so distraught as a boy, he
[2:01:48] promised Fritz over his grave that he
[2:01:50] was going to kill him.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "If I'll catch him out
[2:01:53] somewhere and shoot him. If not, I'll
[2:01:54] run him over with my car. He promised he
[2:01:57] took his gun and was going out the door
[2:01:58] and his dad rrestled him down and took
[2:02:00] the gun out of his hand cuz he was going
[2:02:01] to go kill him. He was so heartbroken,
[2:02:03] so dro so destroyed as a boy.
[2:02:07] But when he moved into the sixth
[2:02:08] dimension where there was perfect love,
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Fritz came up and licked his fingers.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; I think brother Benham realized
[2:02:17] everything's going to be okay.
[2:02:20] What have you suffered? Loss and
[2:02:22] heartbreak and disaster in your life.
[2:02:25] Listen, when you get to that side, you
[2:02:27] realize everything is okay.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Everything God has atoned for,
[2:02:34] everything God has provided for, God has
[2:02:37] writed every wrong. When brother
[2:02:39] Brandham got to that place,
[2:02:42] God had writed every wrong.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Everything was perfect and perfect love.
[2:02:49] Oh, please God, bring me into this realm
[2:02:52] of love to where if somebody does me
[2:02:55] wrong, it's okay because God will make
[2:02:57] it right.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; If I have a terrible loss in my life,
[2:03:02] it's going to be okay because it's going
[2:03:03] to come out right because God does
[2:03:06] everything well.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram says in first John or
[2:03:12] brother Bram 1 John 4:18 says there is
[2:03:14] no fear in love but perfect love cast
[2:03:18] out fear because fearth torment he that
[2:03:22] fearth is not made perfect in love.
[2:03:26] So many of my reactions to situations to
[2:03:28] disasters and heartbreaks and hardships
[2:03:30] is fear.
[2:03:32] But God let me walk with you into this
[2:03:34] realm of love where there's no more
[2:03:37] fear. where I'm not motivated by human
[2:03:40] emotions and fear and the lower form of
[2:03:42] love, but where I move into the higher
[2:03:44] form of love and I realize if I lose it
[2:03:47] here, I'll have it there.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; If it's stripped from me in a horrible
[2:03:51] way here, I will be given back to me
[2:03:54] because all that I ever loved and all
[2:03:56] that I ever loved me, God is going to
[2:03:58] write it all for all of his children.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; I don't know what that'll equate to for
[2:04:02] you or what that'll equate to for me,
[2:04:04] but I believe it. Amen. I believe the
[2:04:06] experience brother Benham had and I
[2:04:08] believe no matter what's been wrong
[2:04:09] here, God's going to make it all right.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; I just need to walk with him.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; In perfect faith, he said, "That's the
[2:04:17] way it is to all believers. They're a
[2:04:20] mystic. They're people that don't
[2:04:22] understand because they live in a world
[2:04:23] to themselves." Jesus lived in a world
[2:04:25] that nobody else could touch. The
[2:04:28] disciples couldn't understand them. When
[2:04:30] he spoke to them, they say this and then
[2:04:32] they said, "Why are you talking riddles?
[2:04:34] Why? We don't understand this. How can
[2:04:36] this be? See, they wasn't in the world
[2:04:38] that he lived in. They couldn't
[2:04:40] understand him. Nobody could understand
[2:04:42] him. And so, when a man lives by faith
[2:04:45] and walks by faith, I mean substance
[2:04:47] faith. He is isolated from the entire
[2:04:49] world and becomes a new creature in
[2:04:51] Christ there. Now, you're getting into
[2:04:54] bride material. That wasn't just for
[2:04:56] Jesus Christ. That's for you and I.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; You're getting into rapturing condition.
[2:05:02] Now that means for each one of us, not
[2:05:04] just the pastor, deacons, trustes. That
[2:05:06] means for the ley, every individual
[2:05:08] walks in a world with God alone. You're
[2:05:11] baptized into this kingdom and there's
[2:05:12] nobody in there but you and God.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; And in there, everything's okay. Amen.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; When you've gone beyond the outer court
[2:05:25] and you've gone beyond the walled
[2:05:26] curtains, you take another step into the
[2:05:29] inner curtain and there's another
[2:05:30] curtain that falls behind you. And then
[2:05:32] you go to that third phase where it's
[2:05:34] just you and God and there's yet another
[2:05:36] veil that falls behind you. In there,
[2:05:40] everything's okay.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; In there is perfect love. In there is
[2:05:46] unity. in there is a trust and a faith
[2:05:50] in God that everything that's going on
[2:05:53] outside is okay.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; And listen friends, when things happen
[2:05:58] to us in life and tragedy strikes and
[2:06:00] heartbreak and hardship and things that
[2:06:02] we never thought we would deal with come
[2:06:04] our way, amen, the solution is not to
[2:06:07] fight back or scream or yell, but the
[2:06:09] solution is slip back into that inner
[2:06:11] veil and let that curtain fall behind
[2:06:12] you till everything is again okay. Your
[2:06:16] outer man can be shaken. Your heart
[2:06:18] could be broken. You could be shedding
[2:06:19] bitter tears. But in your soul, if you
[2:06:22] can commune with God and he can be in
[2:06:24] behind your inner veil and you can be
[2:06:26] behind in his inner veil, you can say be
[2:06:28] it unto me according to the Lord
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; according to your word. Then that's the
[2:06:33] place where you can say the Lord giveth,
[2:06:35] the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the
[2:06:38] name of the Lord. That's where brother
[2:06:40] Brandham was when he stood by the
[2:06:42] bedside of his baby Sharon Rose
[2:06:44] suffering and twitching. Her eyes
[2:06:46] crossed. He was chewing away the flies.
[2:06:48] She was suffering so bad.
[2:06:51] And he prayed to God as any man would
[2:06:54] pray to God. God, don't take my baby.
[2:06:56] Don't let her die. What did he want? He
[2:06:59] wanted to take her home. He had just
[2:07:00] lost his wife. He was absolutely
[2:07:02] distraught. His nerves were on edge. And
[2:07:04] all he wanted was to hold that baby and
[2:07:06] care for her and let it live. maybe even
[2:07:08] as a reminder of his wife
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; and a black sheet fell down and God
[2:07:15] wouldn't answer his prayer and the devil
[2:07:17] come in and started speaking to him and
[2:07:19] say he he's done so much but he doesn't
[2:07:21] care for you and you've done all this
[2:07:23] for him and
[2:07:26] said I was just about to agree with him
[2:07:30] and all of a sudden something changed
[2:07:33] something from within and he said the
[2:07:35] Lord giveth the Lord taketh away blessed
[2:07:37] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Listen, that's something beyond human
[2:07:41] love, friends. That's beyond human.
[2:07:43] That's somebody who's been in behind the
[2:07:45] veil. That's somebody who's been in a
[2:07:47] love relationship with God Almighty that
[2:07:49] knows, "No, though he slay me, yet will
[2:07:52] I serve him because he is perfect
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; in every way."
[2:07:59] Abraham said, "Many times and every time
[2:08:02] that a man ever done anything that's
[2:08:04] worth anything, he walked alone with
[2:08:05] God." But we think we have to have some
[2:08:09] great something around us to secure us.
[2:08:13] We This is what we're looking for.
[2:08:19] We're always looking for security.
[2:08:22] We're We're like sheep. We find security
[2:08:24] in numbers.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; The more people, the safer we feel. the
[2:08:28] more people that agree with us and the
[2:08:29] more people that gather around, we're
[2:08:31] we're looking for security in the wrong
[2:08:33] place.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; But to walk with God, we walk alone with
[2:08:40] God.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; When Paul went to prison, he went by
[2:08:43] himself. When he first stood, nobody
[2:08:46] stood with him. He stood alone. But God
[2:08:49] stood with him.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; What was his security? His security
[2:08:53] wasn't his friends. They weren't there.
[2:08:56] his security. Listen, when brother
[2:08:58] Benham come to the bedside of his baby,
[2:09:00] his security wasn't his buddies. They
[2:09:02] weren't there. His security wasn't his
[2:09:04] wife. She was gone.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; His security had to be the Lord.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; That's what secures us as our
[2:09:12] relationship with God.
[2:09:15] 1 John 4, he says, "And we we have known
[2:09:18] and believe the love that God hath to
[2:09:20] us. God is love. And he that dwelleth in
[2:09:25] love dwelleth in God and God in him.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; I in you, you in me.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; And that day you'll know that I am in
[2:09:35] the Father, the Father, me, I in you,
[2:09:36] and you in me.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Me behind his veil, in him behind my
[2:09:41] veil.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; And he that that dwelleth in love
[2:09:46] dwelleth in God. Amen.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; And God in him. Amen.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; What is this innervail relationship?
[2:09:51] It's bringing me to the capstone.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; It's bringing me to perfect love. It's
[2:09:56] bringing me to the place where though he
[2:09:58] slay me, yet will I serve him.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; It's bringing me to the realization, the
[2:10:02] Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away.
[2:10:04] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; It's bringing us to a place where we can
[2:10:09] walk alone with God. And when it's time
[2:10:11] to leave this world, we're not asking
[2:10:13] the question, where's my wife? Where's
[2:10:15] my son? Where's my daughter? Where's my
[2:10:17] baby? Where's my this? But when we get
[2:10:19] to that place, like brother Brandon was
[2:10:21] in beyond the curtain of time, like like
[2:10:23] hope was in beyond the curtain of time.
[2:10:25] When we get to that place, all we're
[2:10:26] going to say is yes, Father, I'm coming.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; Because that perfect love makes
[2:10:33] everything perfect.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; And all is well.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; I want to finish with this.
[2:10:44] And you're here to fulfill it, too. Just
[2:10:46] walk unconscious of fear. Walk
[2:10:49] unconscious of criticism. Walk
[2:10:51] unconscious of this world. Walk as you
[2:10:53] walk in Christ. Walk with him. Not
[2:10:55] paying any attention to the right or the
[2:10:57] left hand. Just keep moving on. If
[2:10:59] something comes up in the church, walk
[2:11:01] with God.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; If sickness strikes you, walk with God.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; If the neighbor don't like you, walk
[2:11:08] with God. Just keep on walking with God.
[2:11:11] Enoch one day walked like that. You know
[2:11:13] what he done? He walked all the way home
[2:11:15] with God. got so far up the road he
[2:11:17] didn't want to come back home anymore.
[2:11:19] Walk with God. Doctor says you're going
[2:11:22] to die. Walk with God. Doctor says you
[2:11:25] can't. Well, walk with God. Just walk
[2:11:27] with God. That's all. For God has
[2:11:29] promised you, I'll never leave you or
[2:11:31] forsake you. I'll be with you to the end
[2:11:33] of the world. And he took an oath by
[2:11:35] that covenant that he give you that he'd
[2:11:38] confirm it. Just walk with God then.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; You'll have your ups and downs. Don't
[2:11:43] worry. You've got to go through brier
[2:11:45] patches, over sharp rocks, over bluffs,
[2:11:47] down on the hillside, up through the
[2:11:49] mountains, over waters, but walk with
[2:11:53] God.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; What is the solution to every problem?
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Get in behind the veil.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Walk with God
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; and with him alone.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Where is he leading me? To perfect love.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; The perfect realization of perfect love
[2:12:09] to perfection. Amen.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; And
[2:12:12] when we get to that place,
[2:12:16] we won't be scared.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; We won't be afraid. We won't worry. We
[2:12:21] won't have anxiety.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; We'll get to a place where it's just all
[2:12:26] joy.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about in this natural
[2:12:30] life, this natural man, he's always
[2:12:32] going to be a certain way. That's why
[2:12:34] it's going to change. Amen.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; But inside on the inner veil, I want to
[2:12:38] get to this joy, this faith, this place
[2:12:41] of perfect love and perfect trust where
[2:12:43] I know no matter what's going on all
[2:12:45] around, I may have to quiet my flesh
[2:12:47] down and say, "Be quiet."
[2:12:49] But inside, I want to know all is well.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; If somebody poisons my dog, I want to
[2:12:56] say it's okay. God will write every
[2:12:58] wrong. Amen.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; If somebody does me wrong and does
[2:13:01] somebody does me evil, my neighbor don't
[2:13:03] like me or somebody takes my job or
[2:13:06] somebody lies about me on the job site
[2:13:08] for a promotion. Listen, I got to get to
[2:13:10] the place where I've walked with him so
[2:13:11] much I know he'll write every wrong and
[2:13:13] he'll take care of everything. And what
[2:13:15] does it matter to me anyways? If he
[2:13:17] wanted me to have it, I'd get it. If he
[2:13:18] doesn't want me to have it, I don't want
[2:13:20] it. I've got to walk with God. My place
[2:13:23] is in the inner chamber, not out here in
[2:13:25] the outer court where it rains and sun
[2:13:27] and wind and happy and sad. That's not
[2:13:29] where I belong. I belong in the inner
[2:13:31] chamber. I belong in the bedroom. I
[2:13:33] belong in the third phase of this
[2:13:35] relationship.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; And in there, everything's okay.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's stand
[2:13:42] together.
[2:13:44] Musicians, if you'll come and brother
[2:13:45] John, please.
[2:13:47] Amen. Sister Amanda, if you and your
[2:13:50] folks want to make your way around back
[2:13:51] for the baptism, I just want the rest of
[2:13:53] us to bow our heads and pray for just a
[2:13:56] moment. Dear heavenly father, I'm so
[2:13:59] thankful,
[2:14:01] God, for the word that you have given
[2:14:02] us. And God, I'm the first to say, Lord,
[2:14:06] I'm sorry.
[2:14:08] I'm sorry for being distracted.
[2:14:11] I'm sorry, Lord, for meandering in my
[2:14:13] walk.
[2:14:14] But oh God, I realize more than
[2:14:16] anything, I want to go beyond that last
[2:14:19] veil. And I want to remain there with
[2:14:22] you, Lord. I want to take that journey
[2:14:24] as far as I can take it right into your
[2:14:27] very presence. And there I want to
[2:14:29] remain walking with you.
[2:14:32] God, I I ask that you would just come
[2:14:35] and dwell in the innermost part of my
[2:14:37] life. That you would come behind my veil
[2:14:41] and my soul. that you would there would
[2:14:43] take your abode and may you draw me in
[2:14:45] behind your veil into the innerv.
[2:14:48] And God, may I there with you commune
[2:14:51] until everything in the world fades
[2:14:53] away.
[2:14:55] Until everything, Lord, becomes
[2:14:57] secondary to this love affair.
[2:15:00] God, may I come into the relationship
[2:15:02] that I can only have with you and can
[2:15:04] share with no one else. And may that
[2:15:06] relationship bring me to a greater love
[2:15:08] and a greater understanding and a
[2:15:10] greater realization of reality.
[2:15:14] Lord, if there's anybody here, Lord,
[2:15:16] who's never went beyond the outer court,
[2:15:19] may they hear your voice drawing them in
[2:15:21] further. God, if they've come into the
[2:15:24] inner court and they've discussed the
[2:15:25] wonderful things that are there, the
[2:15:28] light from the ages, the the showbread
[2:15:31] of fellowship, the altar of incense, and
[2:15:34] they're rejoicing in it. But Lord, may
[2:15:36] they realize that there's another veil.
[2:15:39] There's a deeper relationship. There's
[2:15:41] another place that they can go. And may
[2:15:44] they not be afraid to go alone.
[2:15:47] God, I pray as your voice is drawing us,
[2:15:50] may we come. As you're bidding us to
[2:15:53] come, may we lay down whatever's
[2:15:56] hindering us. If it's a relationship,
[2:15:59] may we lay it down, Lord. If it's if
[2:16:02] it's some ambition, may we lay it down.
[2:16:04] May we lay down anything that's
[2:16:06] hindering us. And may we move beyond
[2:16:08] that last veil and come into the Holy of
[2:16:12] Holies, into the place of your shikina
[2:16:15] glory, where we meet you in a way we've
[2:16:17] never met you before. Where we become
[2:16:20] one with you, Lord, and where we're
[2:16:21] changed, forever changed. And God, where
[2:16:25] you bring us into that atmosphere of
[2:16:27] love
[2:16:28] where everything, Lord, is going to be
[2:16:30] all right. where our faith just soarses
[2:16:34] because we know you're perfect and you
[2:16:36] do all things well and you cannot fail
[2:16:39] and our life is in your hands. God,
[2:16:42] bring us into that place. Let us abide
[2:16:45] in that place as Enoch walked with you
[2:16:48] before his translation. May we walk with
[2:16:50] you now in the last days before this
[2:16:53] final translation. And may we have faith
[2:16:56] to believe you, Lord, to take you at
[2:16:58] your word, to stand upon it and just
[2:17:00] hold on to it and believe it with all of
[2:17:02] our hearts. And may that word become our
[2:17:05] life.
[2:17:07] Bless your people, bless your children,
[2:17:09] guide us as we move from here. And may
[2:17:11] we never stop walking with you. We love
[2:17:14] you, Father, for your word. And may it
[2:17:16] become more and more of a reality to our
[2:17:18] hearts. We ask it in Jesus Christ's
[2:17:21] name. Amen.
[2:17:24] Amen.
[2:17:26] Just want to say
[2:17:28] Enoch
[2:17:30] raptured by himself.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; I think it's time for us to get
[2:17:35] comfortable in our individual walk with
[2:17:38] the Lord.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; I think it's time for us to to find that
[2:17:43] our happiest place
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; is alone with him.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; Where we have the most comfort is not in
[2:17:49] the group, but where we have the most
[2:17:50] comfort is alone.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. with God. That's right.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; In our times of meditation and devotion
[2:17:56] and prayer, I I I believe it's time that
[2:17:59] that is the last phase of our journey
[2:18:02] where we just walk with him.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was a foreshadow of us. So I
[2:18:08] know that if it happened to him, it'll
[2:18:10] happen to me.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; And may I walk with him.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother John.
[2:18:18] Just beyond the veil.
[2:18:24] I long to see your face.
[2:18:31] Just to see your beauty there.
[2:18:37] Just beyond
[2:18:39] the veil.
[2:18:40] [Music]
[2:18:43] Beautiful.
[2:18:45] You are
[2:18:48] beautiful.
[2:18:50] You are
[2:18:54] beautiful.
[2:18:56] You are. You are.
[2:19:00] Beautiful.
[2:19:02] You are.
[2:19:05] And you're the prince of peace.
[2:19:10] peace. You're the prince of peace.
[2:19:18] You're the prince of peace. You are.
[2:19:24] You're the prince of peace.
[2:19:29] And marvelous
[2:19:31] you are.
[2:19:35] Marvelous
[2:19:37] you are.
[2:19:40] Marvelous
[2:19:43] you are. You are
[2:19:46] marvelous
[2:19:48] you are.
[2:19:51] Oh just beyond
[2:19:54] the veil.
[2:19:57] I long to see your face.
[2:20:03] Just to see your beauty there.
[2:20:08] Oh, just beyond the veil.
[2:20:14] And you're the prince of peace.
[2:20:20] You're the prince of peace.
[2:20:26] You're the prince of peace. You are. For
[2:20:31] you're the prince of peace.
[2:20:36] It's just beyond
[2:20:39] the veil.
[2:20:43] Just to see your face,
[2:20:48] just to see your beauty there,
[2:20:54] just beyond
[2:20:56] the way.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful day to see God still
[2:21:02] drawing his children and drawing Sister
[2:21:03] Amanda. And God has been drawing her for
[2:21:06] quite a while and she's responding to
[2:21:08] that call. Amen. And she wants to be
[2:21:10] identified with the Lord Jesus Christ by
[2:21:12] taking his name in water baptism. So,
[2:21:14] we're so happy for you, Amanda. So happy
[2:21:17] that the Lord has drawn you and that you
[2:21:18] want to make a public declaration of
[2:21:20] what God has done in your heart. And you
[2:21:22] want the world to know that you're
[2:21:24] identified with Jesus Christ in his
[2:21:26] death, burial, and resurrection, and
[2:21:28] that you intend to live for him. So
[2:21:31] because of your confession of what the
[2:21:32] Lord has done in your heart and your
[2:21:34] desire to be baptized in his name, it's
[2:21:36] with great pleasure that I now baptize
[2:21:38] you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:21:40] Christ.
[2:21:43] Dear heavenly father, I lay hands on my
[2:21:45] sister, Lord, and so appreciative, Lord,
[2:21:48] that you know how to draw, that you're a
[2:21:50] great shepherd that can lead a sheep
[2:21:52] back home. And God, as she has fulfilled
[2:21:54] your word, she's been obedient to what
[2:21:56] you've called her to. Lord, I pray God,
[2:21:58] you confirm the promise that you've made
[2:22:00] to her, upon her, that she will receive
[2:22:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. May you
[2:22:04] walk in her every day of her life. May
[2:22:06] you shield her from the fiery darts of
[2:22:08] the enemy. May she become a light in
[2:22:10] this world and a testimony of your
[2:22:12] saving grace. And may you use her, Lord,
[2:22:14] as you intended to from before the
[2:22:16] foundation of the world as part of your
[2:22:18] kingdom. And may she do the work that
[2:22:20] you've left for her to do. Bless her in
[2:22:22] all of this. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[2:22:24] name. Amen. God bless you, sister
[2:22:27] Amanda. God bless you all. Thank you,
[2:22:29] brother John.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; I have a maker.
[2:22:38] He formed my heart.
[2:22:44] And before even time began,
[2:22:50] my life is in his hands.
[2:22:58] And he knows my name.
[2:23:05] And he knows my every thought.
[2:23:12] And he sees each tear that falls.
[2:23:17] And he hears me when I call.
[2:23:23] All.
[2:23:25] Oh, I have a father.
[2:23:33] He calls me his own.
[2:23:40] And he'll never
[2:23:42] leave me.
[2:23:45] Oh, no matter
[2:23:48] where I go.
[2:23:53] Oh, he knows my name.
[2:24:00] He knows my every thought.
[2:24:07] He sees each tear that falls.
[2:24:13] And he hears me when
[2:24:16] I call.
[2:24:18] [Music]
[2:24:20] Oh, he knows my name.
[2:24:27] [Music]
[2:24:28] He
[2:24:30] knows my every thought.
[2:24:35] And he sees each tear that falls.
[2:24:41] and he hears me when
[2:24:44] I call.
[2:24:47] How deep the Father's
[2:24:51] love for us.
[2:24:55] How fast that beyond all measure
[2:25:02] that he would give his only son
[2:25:10] to make a wretch of treasure.
[2:25:18] How great the pain of searing loss.
[2:25:26] The father
[2:25:28] turns his face away
[2:25:32] [Music]
[2:25:34] as wounds which are the chosen one.
[2:25:41] Bring many
[2:25:44] sons to gloryy.
[2:25:50] Behold
[2:25:51] the man upon a cross.
[2:25:57] My guilt upon his shoulders.
[2:26:06] ashamed.
[2:26:07] I hear my mocking
[2:26:11] voice
[2:26:13] call out among us scers.
[2:26:20] [Music]
[2:26:21] It was my heat that held him there
[2:26:28] [Music]
[2:26:29] until
[2:26:31] it was accomplished.
[2:26:35] [Music]
[2:26:37] His dying
[2:26:40] breath has brought me life.
[2:26:45] I know that it is finished.
[2:26:53] How great the golf that God did spend
[2:27:01] to come where I lay helpless.
[2:27:09] Through tears I see his outstretched
[2:27:14] arms
[2:27:16] as he declares me guiltless.
[2:27:24] How great his love that sought me out.
[2:27:32] How infinite
[2:27:36] his mercy.
[2:27:40] His blood has cleansed my every part
[2:27:48] and placed me as his purchase.
[2:27:56] I will not boast in anything.
[2:28:04] No gift, no power, no wisdom.
[2:28:10] [Applause]
[2:28:11] [Music]
[2:28:12] But I will boast in Jesus Christ
[2:28:20] his death and resurrection.
[2:28:28] Why should I gain from his reward
[2:28:34] forth?
[2:28:36] I cannot
[2:28:39] give an answer,
[2:28:44] but this I know with all my heart.
[2:28:52] His fruits have paid my ransom.
[2:28:57] [Music]
[2:29:00] Why should I gain from his reward?
[2:29:08] I cannot
[2:29:10] give an answer,
[2:29:13] [Music]
[2:29:16] but this I know with all my heart.
[2:29:24] His words have paid my ransom.
[2:29:30] [Music]
[2:29:35] Here is here is love. Here
[2:29:39] is love
[2:29:41] vast as the ocean.
[2:29:45] Loving kindness
[2:29:47] as the flood.
[2:29:50] When the prince
[2:29:53] of life, our ransom
[2:29:57] shed for us,
[2:29:59] his preious blood.
[2:30:02] Oh, his love
[2:30:05] will not remember.
[2:30:09] Look who can cease
[2:30:11] to sing his praise.
[2:30:15] He will never
[2:30:18] be forgotten.
[2:30:21] throughout his
[2:30:24] eternal days.
[2:30:27] On the mount
[2:30:30] of crucifixction,
[2:30:33] fountains open and deep and wide.
[2:30:39] Through the floodgates
[2:30:42] of God's mercy, oh flow of glass
[2:30:48] and a gracious time,
[2:30:51] grace and love
[2:30:54] like mighty rivers
[2:30:57] poured incessant
[2:30:59] [Applause]
[2:31:00] from above.
[2:31:03] Heaven's peace
[2:31:06] and perfect justice.
[2:31:09] Kiss the guilty
[2:31:12] world in love.
[2:31:16] Let me all thy love except thee.
[2:31:21] Love thee ever
[2:31:24] all my days.
[2:31:28] Let me see
[2:31:30] thy kingom only.
[2:31:33] and my life
[2:31:36] be to thy praise.
[2:31:39] Thou alone
[2:31:42] will be my glory.
[2:31:45] Nothing in
[2:31:48] the world I see.
[2:31:51] Thou has cleansed and sanctified me.
[2:31:57] Thou thyself
[2:32:00] has set me free.
[2:32:03] and in thy truth
[2:32:06] thou dost direct me.
[2:32:09] By thy spirit
[2:32:12] through thy word
[2:32:15] and thy grace
