[0:00] You ever had a conversation, a a man and
[0:03] his wife had a conversation, child's
[0:05] done something, they need discipline,
[0:07] and who is it that's always advocating
[0:09] for the child?
[0:11] Well, they didn't mean to. And and
[0:14] they've they're overly tired and they
[0:16] and and and maybe just not this time.
[0:22] Is that only in my house or
[0:25] does that happen anywhere else?
[0:28] That's the proper role of a mother. But
[0:31] you see how if that's the only role that
[0:33] you have, how there's never any
[0:34] character building in that child because
[0:36] it takes a father, amen, to say, "No, th
[0:39] this is for their good.
[0:42] This is what they need." The same thing
[0:44] happens in a church when you get into
[0:46] situations that are violations of the
[0:47] word. You take for instance, amen,
[0:49] qualifications for ministry, who can
[0:52] marry, who can not marry, who's
[0:53] eligible, divorce, and all of a sudden
[0:55] you say, "Well, I feel sorry for them
[0:57] because their situation and this
[0:58] happened to them." And you don't know
[1:00] how bad their husband treated them and
[1:01] now they're all alone and they're so
[1:03] lonely. I feel for them. That is the
[1:05] role that you should play as a mother,
[1:08] right? I feel for you. I love you. This
[1:10] is hard for you and I'm here to support
[1:12] you and take care of you. But the moment
[1:14] you start to try to deviate from the
[1:16] word and say, "I think in your
[1:19] circumstance or in this situation, we'll
[1:21] let it go." The moment that happens, the
[1:23] church has just cut the father out of
[1:25] the scene and she becomes a doineering
[1:27] woman and she's taken her mercy and love
[1:29] and she's done damage
[1:32] to the very objects of her love by what?
[1:35] By circumventing the word of the father.
[1:38] Amen. For what? For compassion and
[1:40] sympathy.
[1:43] This is what's happened to the worldly
[1:45] church.
[1:47] God forbid it would ever happen to us.
[1:50] Amen. Because the church, it doesn't
[1:53] matter what names on the sign, it
[1:54] doesn't matter how much you like the
[1:56] people that gather gather together, the
[1:58] church can never give you your
[2:00] identification. And if you're looking
[2:02] for the church for identification,
[2:04] you're always going to be struggling
[2:05] with identity. Yeah.
[2:09] But oh, if that mother could just say,
[2:11] "This is your father." Amen. This is
[2:13] your father right here. This message
[2:15] that God given us is the word restored.
[2:17] That's our father. That's that that's
[2:20] where you came from. That's your
[2:21] progeniator. That's your origin. That's
[2:23] the giver of your life. Amen. I've only
[2:25] been here to facilitate his will. The
[2:27] church is only here to be a help. Amen.
[2:30] But never. We are not the originators of
[2:32] life.
[2:35] Amen. The originator of life is father.
[2:38] Amen. The one who coddles and holds and
[2:41] protects and feeds and nurses, that's
[2:42] mother. But the originator of life is
[2:45] father.
