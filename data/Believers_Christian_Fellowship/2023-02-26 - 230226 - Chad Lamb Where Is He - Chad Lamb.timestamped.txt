[13:20] it's interesting I'm I'm excited to be
[13:22] traveling with brother cobbler the Kyle
[13:23] and I have never had the opportunity to
[13:25] travel together in Ministry we tried it
[13:28] once
[13:29] five or six years ago and poor Brother
[13:31] Kyle got left alone at the airport and
[13:33] had to go by himself because my passport
[13:36] didn't have enough time on it and they
[13:37] turned me down and sent me back and so
[13:39] we tried it once so we're going to try
[13:41] it again amen but they invited us to
[13:44] come for anniversary meetings Brother
[13:45] Kyle got a special invite from Brother

[14:27] Wednesday Brother David Dean Hart then
[14:29] the following Sunday I will be brother
[14:31] Burley Williams he's coming up to
[14:33] minister for us so be praying for those
[14:35] Services as well
[14:37] man let's look into Colossians
[14:40] Colossians chapter one
[14:43] verse 26 very very familiar we could
[14:47] probably quote it by heart but I'd like
[14:48] to begin with this verse Colossians
[14:51] chapter 1 verse 26 even the mystery
[14:53] which has been hid from ages and from
[14:55] Generations but now is made manifest to
[14:58] his Saints to whom God would make known
[15:01] what is the riches of the glory of this
[15:03] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[15:05] Christ in you the hope of glory amen God
[15:09] bless you as you take your seats
[15:11] there are certain things that that has
[15:13] been preached in this day certain things
[15:15] in the scriptures and certain things
[15:16] that the prophet of God have brought to
[15:18] light and those things I don't think we
[15:20] could ever be reminded of enough because
[15:22] it is the manifestation in our day it is
[15:25] the revelation of the mystery that we're
[15:27] to be fleshing out in this day and this
[15:30] scripture is such a key pivotal
[15:31] scripture to that this is the mystery
[15:34] you know whom God would make known verse
[15:37] 27 to whom God would make known what is
[15:39] the riches of the glory of this mystery
[15:41] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[15:44] you the hope of glory
[15:46] amen what a theme and I just want to
[15:49] take for a subject tonight if I can for
[15:51] a title or this morning sorry for a
[15:53] title is where is he just to question
[15:56] where is he and we can all answer that
[15:58] question we all know you know the things
[16:00] that I want to talk about uh this
[16:02] morning that are on my heart are not
[16:04] something we're not aware of or don't
[16:05] know but they're things that it behooves
[16:08] us to look at and it and it really
[16:10] behooves us to look at it and let it
[16:12] become more real amen that it becomes a
[16:15] greater reality in our lives because
[16:17] there are consequences for things
[16:20] Amen in Revelation will bring
[16:22] consequences in our life a true
[16:24] revelation will actually change the way
[16:27] we think the way we view something and
[16:29] it actually will change our behavior and
[16:31] change our conduct and it makes us a a
[16:34] line to that Revelation and so it's
[16:36] important that these things remain true
[16:39] to us and before our eyes constantly so
[16:41] the question is where is he in in this
[16:44] message has been brewing for quite some
[16:47] time and I'll I'll fill you in on why as
[16:51] we go a little further but there was a a
[16:54] question that brother Abraham Myra asked
[16:56] me about a quote and he sent me the
[16:58] quote he said what do you think about
[16:59] this he said I can't sort this out and I
[17:02] told him I have no clue brother you know
[17:04] that's just my answer real quickly but I
[17:06] read it but I never could get that quote
[17:09] out of my heart I've been meditating on
[17:11] it dwelling on it for quite some time
[17:13] and I'll share that with you when we get
[17:15] to it it'll be a little bit later and
[17:18] then there was another brother I was
[17:19] speaking with brother Elmer Schwartz one
[17:21] day and he mentioned the scripture and
[17:23] gave a comment on it and and lo and
[17:26] behold if it didn't spark another
[17:28] thought and these two things that were
[17:30] totally random and separate from one
[17:31] another started moving together in my
[17:34] heart and so I'll I'll share that
[17:37] scripture with you when we get to it as
[17:38] well
[17:40] but I just in a way of maybe review or
[17:43] laying a foundation or whatever there's
[17:45] some things that I'd like to go over and
[17:47] as we get to there then I'll share with
[17:49] you what those things were and why
[17:51] they've had such an impact on me
[17:53] personally let's turn to John chapter
[17:55] 10.
[18:00] John chapter 10.
[18:05] and we'll look at verse 33.
[18:11] John 10 and 33.
[18:21] the Jews answered him saying for a good
[18:23] work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy
[18:26] and because thou being a man maketh
[18:29] thyself God Jesus answered them is it
[18:31] not written in your law I said ye are
[18:33] Gods if I called them Gods unto whom the
[18:37] word of God came and the scripture
[18:39] cannot be broken say you of him whom the
[18:42] father has Sanctified and sent into the
[18:44] world thou blasphemus because I said I
[18:47] am the son of God
[18:48] so he asked a question they want to
[18:51] accuse him of blasphemy because he says
[18:53] he's the son of God but he said doesn't
[18:55] the scripture says that you are gods
[18:58] to whom the word of the Lord came to
[18:59] let's go back and look at this scripture
[19:01] in Psalms 82. we'll take it from there
[19:05] because I love to go back to the
[19:07] scripture that Jesus is referring to
[19:10] and read in what context read what it
[19:13] said so Jesus is referring back to
[19:15] Psalms 82.
[19:17] and verse 6.
[19:20] and he says I have said ye are gods and
[19:25] all of you are children of the most high
[19:28] you are all gods and your children the
[19:31] most high but Jesus said
[19:34] that he called them Gods unto whom the
[19:37] word of God came so who does the word of
[19:39] God come to it comes to the children of
[19:41] God
[19:43] and when the word of God comes to the
[19:44] children of God it's a declaration that
[19:47] they they are Gods according to the
[19:48] scripture because we've been through
[19:50] this before The Offspring of a man is a
[19:53] man The Offspring of a dog is a dog and
[19:55] The Offspring of a cat is a cat so The
[19:58] Offspring of God would be
[20:01] amen
[20:03] praise God those things are hard to say
[20:06] there's a repulsion within our human
[20:08] being in our human mind amen but if God
[20:11] is God the family of God are gods
[20:14] and God meant man God meant for man to
[20:17] be a God on the earth he when he made
[20:19] Adam and placed him on Earth he gave him
[20:21] rulership over all the creation and he
[20:24] was to be a God on Earth and he fell
[20:26] from his status because of falling from
[20:28] the word but now Jesus said unto whom
[20:30] the word come to they are gods
[20:33] praise God so we must stay with the word
[20:37] now in the unveiling of God brother
[20:40] Brandon says notice Through the Ages the
[20:42] same way by His prophets he has revealed
[20:44] himself then wasn't exactly prophets
[20:47] they were Gods he said so for what they
[20:50] spoke was God's word they were the flesh
[20:53] that God was veiled in
[20:55] this is so important they were the flesh
[20:58] that God was veiled in they were Gods
[20:59] Jesus said himself said how can you
[21:02] condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God
[21:04] and your own law says that them who the
[21:06] word of the Lord come to was God's
[21:09] so now I want to go look at Moses in the
[21:11] book of Exodus if you could turn with me
[21:12] to Exodus chapter 3
[21:22] Exodus chapter 3.
[21:24] and we just keep laying this Foundation
[21:28] Exodus chapter 3 verse 7.
[21:32] and the Lord said
[21:34] I have surely seen the Affliction of my
[21:37] people which are in Egypt and have heard
[21:39] their Cry by reason of their task
[21:41] Masters for I know their sorrows and I
[21:44] am come down to deliver them out of the
[21:46] hand of the Egyptians and to bring them
[21:48] up out of that land unto a good land and
[21:51] a large unto a land flowing with milk
[21:53] and honey unto the place of the
[21:55] Canaanites and the Hittites and the
[21:57] amorites and the parasites and the
[21:59] hivites and the jebusites now therefore
[22:02] Behold The Cry of the children of Israel
[22:04] is come unto me and I have also seen the
[22:06] oppression where with the Egyptians
[22:08] oppressed them come now therefore and I
[22:11] will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou
[22:13] Mays bring forth my people the children
[22:15] of Israel out of Egypt
[22:17] so he begins by saying I have heard the
[22:20] cry and in verse 80 says and I am come
[22:23] down to deliver them
[22:25] I have come down to deliver them now he
[22:28] goes and he finds Moses when God come
[22:30] down to deliver them he finds a man
[22:33] because God always works through man so
[22:36] he finds Moses and Moses was born a
[22:38] proper child he was born under a sign he
[22:40] was always predestinated to be this
[22:42] deliverer but he had run to the backside
[22:44] of the desert he was out in the
[22:46] wilderness tending his father-in-law
[22:47] sheep and God came to him with a sign
[22:50] and found him and told him this is time
[22:53] for me to come and for me to deliver my
[22:56] children now I'm and now now I'm calling
[22:59] you now you go and you deliver my
[23:02] children
[23:04] so what was Moses Moses was representing
[23:07] God where was God when he was delivering
[23:10] his children coming to deliver them he
[23:12] was in that Prophet coming to deliver
[23:14] his children
[23:15] Moses was a representation of God and
[23:18] what God was doing in that day what God
[23:21] had declared I will now do he was now
[23:24] doing in and through Moses
[23:27] praise God
[23:29] again in the unveiling of God he says
[23:31] Moses had the word now remember after
[23:34] the word was made manifest Moses was
[23:36] Moses again but while that word was in
[23:38] him to be given out he was God
[23:41] well he wasn't Moses no more he had the
[23:44] word of the Lord for that age nothing
[23:46] could touch him till that was over had
[23:48] had that word with him so therefore when
[23:51] he come the people turned their heads
[23:53] they couldn't understand they they had
[23:56] been changed he was a different fellow
[23:58] he came with that word and he put a veil
[24:00] but the Bible said over his face for he
[24:03] had the word and he was the word to them
[24:07] he didn't just have the word he was the
[24:10] word to them he was God coming to set
[24:13] them free
[24:15] and it wasn't the Flesh of Moses but the
[24:17] flesh of Moses was the vessel that God
[24:20] was using it was gone through Moses
[24:23] sometimes it's hard to keep these things
[24:25] separated and sometimes the terminology
[24:27] the the prophet speaks so bluntly
[24:31] sometimes and it takes your breath away
[24:33] a little bit because we have so much
[24:35] experience with the flesh man we see
[24:37] everything through flesh amen and we
[24:39] like no it couldn't be this flesh and I
[24:41] make so many mistakes but God's not
[24:43] interested in that part there's a seed
[24:45] on the inside that gives him something
[24:47] he can access and use to use this flesh
[24:50] for his purpose
[24:55] so
[24:57] again says in the unveiling of God like
[25:01] he was in Moses when the word was in
[25:02] Moses he was God in flesh
[25:05] that's a statement
[25:07] that's a statement
[25:09] when it was in Jesus it was God in flesh
[25:11] see only thing he done was change his
[25:14] mask not his word not his nature he is
[25:16] the same yesterday today and forever he
[25:19] only changed his form he changed from
[25:21] Noah to Moses he changed from Moses to
[25:24] David from David to Joseph on down until
[25:26] he come into the fullness of the godhead
[25:28] bodily it's still the same God amen amen
[25:32] I hope that gets through it's the same
[25:34] God but he just takes on another Veil
[25:36] see he puts on another Veil he did it in
[25:40] the reformers taken on a veil taken on a
[25:42] veil until finally it come down through
[25:45] the Lutheran age down through the other
[25:46] age then finally it comes out into
[25:49] complete
[25:50] that's the age we live in
[25:53] just before it comes a prophet arises
[25:55] again what it does it foreshadows the
[25:57] word showing back here revealing what's
[26:00] been done what's been left off that the
[26:03] church will be not without understanding
[26:05] then when this Fades out then like John
[26:08] said I must decrease he must increase
[26:10] then all in all comes into him
[26:14] he is fully manifested through Luther
[26:16] Wesley Pentecost agent on down on on
[26:19] down he is fully manifested you see come
[26:22] down just the manifestation God
[26:25] unfolding see yet notice now fulfilled
[26:28] in his promise for this day as they had
[26:33] so what is it it's God
[26:35] manifesting himself God unfolding down
[26:39] through time taking a veil and through
[26:42] that Veil doing his work and revealing
[26:44] himself
[26:46] and and brother Bram says like this that
[26:49] statement was so bold he said when the
[26:51] word was in Moses Moses was God to them
[26:55] but yet they could never worship Moses
[26:58] because Moses the flesh man was only the
[27:00] veil and you never worship the Veil
[27:03] it was the god that was in Moses amen
[27:06] it's been so hard sometimes for people
[27:08] to keep these things separated and
[27:10] because it's so hard to keep it
[27:11] separated people have they have failed
[27:14] on both sides amen because because it
[27:16] seems so extreme amen and it gets so
[27:19] close sometimes people make a mistake
[27:21] and worship the Veil
[27:23] and then that's idolatry
[27:27] there was a veil that separated the
[27:29] Shekinah Glory of God Amen from from the
[27:32] inner corn amen and you could go to that
[27:34] Veil knowing just beyond that Veil and
[27:36] you can see the Tabernacle with skins in
[27:38] the middle of Israel and all of Israel
[27:40] could know that God is right there where
[27:42] is God right there and you're pointing
[27:45] to a tabernacle but you're not thinking
[27:47] of the Tabernacle you're thinking of the
[27:49] god inside the Tabernacle but for
[27:53] Generations amen they would they would
[27:54] the children would say where is God
[27:56] dwell he dwells right there that's where
[27:58] God is he's right there amen but it
[28:01] wasn't the Skins it was the god inside
[28:03] the skins
[28:05] and you could see how when somebody's
[28:06] been pointed and pointed and pointed
[28:08] they can begin to worship the skins
[28:12] which is an absolute failure it's
[28:14] idolatry
[28:17] but because somebody has failed and
[28:19] worshiped skins there's another side
[28:21] that wants to distance themselves far on
[28:24] this side away from that truth as well
[28:26] and not get any close to it because they
[28:28] want nothing to do with idolatry but in
[28:30] doing so they forsake the very place of
[28:32] God
[28:33] and they will not witness to or identify
[28:36] with or recognize where God is working
[28:39] and so they stay away because they don't
[28:41] want to worship the veil but they won't
[28:42] even give the veil proper respect
[28:48] because you still had to honor that
[28:50] Temple
[28:51] take care of it not defile it amen you
[28:55] couldn't worship it but you sure
[28:57] couldn't disrespect it either
[29:00] see what a fine line
[29:03] amen
[29:05] so God was moving down through and it
[29:09] was God in the veil it was God and Noah
[29:13] and God and Moses and God and David and
[29:15] God and Jeremiah it's been gone through
[29:17] the reformers and Through the Ages and
[29:20] it's God today
[29:22] and he's still working through a veil
[29:26] let's go back to Exodus chapter 4.
[29:31] I just want to look at something that
[29:33] was of interest to me
[29:37] in the life of Moses we're just going to
[29:38] pick a couple more places and then move
[29:40] on
[29:41] Exodus chapter 4 verse 14.
[29:48] and the anger of the Lord was kindled
[29:50] against Moses and he said is not Aaron
[29:52] the levite thy brother I know that he
[29:55] can speak well Moses was contesting with
[29:57] God giving excuses for why he couldn't
[29:59] go and be God's representation he
[30:02] couldn't go to deliver the children of
[30:03] Israel and so God gets angered and he
[30:06] starts telling talking about Aaron he
[30:08] says I know that he can speak well and
[30:10] also behold he cometh forth to meet thee
[30:12] and when he seeth thee he will be glad
[30:14] in his heart and thou shalt speak unto
[30:16] him and put words in his mouth and I
[30:18] will be with thy mouth and with his
[30:21] mouth and will teach you what you shall
[30:22] do and he shall be thy spokesman unto
[30:25] the people and he shall be even he shall
[30:28] be to thee instead of a mouth and thou
[30:30] shalt be to him instead of God
[30:34] Lord
[30:37] thou shall be to him instead of God he's
[30:40] saying I'm not going to talk to Aaron
[30:43] but you're going to be my representation
[30:45] and your mouth is going to take my words
[30:47] and you will be to Aaron instead of God
[30:50] instead of going to God God will be
[30:53] coming to Aaron through the lips of
[30:55] Moses
[30:57] you will be to him instead of God and
[31:00] thou shalt take this rod in thy hand
[31:02] wherewith Thou shalt do signs so God
[31:06] calls Moses and he equips him he gives
[31:10] him Aaron to be his mouth but but Moses
[31:13] is still the mouth of God
[31:15] he is still the mouthpiece of God he
[31:16] said I'll be with your mouth and you'll
[31:18] be the heir he'll be to you instead of a
[31:20] mouth but you'll be to him instead of
[31:21] God
[31:23] that's a pretty amazing statement
[31:27] in Exodus chapter 7 to hold your place
[31:31] in four we're going to come back to
[31:32] chapter four but look at chapter seven
[31:34] quickly
[31:35] Exodus chapter 7 verse 1.
[31:40] and the Lord said unto Moses see I have
[31:42] made thee a God to pharaoh
[31:46] and Aaron thy brother shall be thy
[31:48] prophet
[31:49] so even the Pharaoh Moses was God made
[31:52] Moses a God to him
[31:55] amen so we see this principle we see
[31:57] this coming from the from the very
[31:59] mouthpiece mouth of God
[32:02] but I want to go back
[32:05] to chapter four
[32:07] chapter four verse 1.
[32:12] he goes and Moses answered and said but
[32:15] behold they will not believe me nor
[32:17] hearken unto my voice for they will say
[32:20] the Lord hath not
[32:21] the Lord has not appeared unto thee and
[32:23] the Lord said unto him what is that in
[32:26] thy hand and he said a rod
[32:29] and he said cast It cast it on the
[32:31] ground and he cast it on the ground and
[32:33] it became a serpent and Moses fled from
[32:35] before him and the Lord said unto Moses
[32:37] put forth thine hand and take it by the
[32:39] tail and he put forth his hand and
[32:40] caught it and it became a rod in his
[32:42] hand that they may believe that the Lord
[32:45] God of their fathers the god of Abraham
[32:47] the god of Isaac the god of Jacob hath
[32:49] appeared unto thee
[32:51] so go on
[32:53] tells Moses what's in your hand he said
[32:56] a rod
[32:57] a stick
[33:00] he tells him to cast it down and then he
[33:02] it works a sign with it and he says so
[33:05] that the children will believe that I'm
[33:06] with you there's this there's a sign of
[33:09] the rod
[33:10] and brother mentions this rod in the
[33:12] message it is I be not afraid he said
[33:14] Moses had a dry stick in his hand and
[33:17] Moses's hand it was nothing else but a
[33:19] stick that he had picked up perhaps on
[33:21] the desert but once when that hand of
[33:24] Faith taken a hold of that stick it
[33:26] became God's judgment Rod to the world
[33:28] that dry stick became the Judgment Rod
[33:31] remember Moses stretched the rod he
[33:33] stretched the rod Over the Sea he
[33:35] stretched it in the air it was God's
[33:37] judgment rod
[33:39] now there's a reason I'm going into this
[33:41] and we'll get to that in a second but if
[33:44] you can imagine that one day Moses the
[33:46] question is when did Moses pick up this
[33:48] rod
[33:50] was it and when he flew from Egypt it
[33:53] was at a rod that he had in Egypt did he
[33:54] pick it up along the way or did he get
[33:57] it when he became a shepherd and began
[33:59] to to watch over his father-in-law
[34:01] Jethro's flock the scripture doesn't
[34:03] tell us but you can use your imagination
[34:05] somewhere along the line he picked up
[34:07] this rod
[34:08] and for him it was a shepherd's Rod it
[34:11] was a rod I mean much like a walking
[34:13] stick and it was something that he he
[34:15] used in his daily life
[34:18] I got this and we found it who knows
[34:21] where it was fashioned out of who knows
[34:23] what amen but but Moses and Moses
[34:26] himself had needed it so when he needed
[34:29] it Moses himself had found it and he
[34:32] himself had picked it up and he himself
[34:34] had purposed it
[34:36] but now God is going to repurpose it
[34:40] okay
[34:41] and now I want to look at verse 18.
[34:49] Verse 18 chapter 4 verse 18 and Moses
[34:53] went and returned to Jethro his
[34:55] father-in-law and said unto him let me
[34:57] go I pray thee in return unto my
[34:59] brethren which are in Egypt and see
[35:01] whether they be yet alive and Jethro
[35:04] said to Moses go in peace and the Lord
[35:06] said unto Moses and Midian go return
[35:09] unto Egypt for all the men are dead
[35:11] which sought thy life
[35:14] and Moses took his wife and his sons and
[35:16] set them upon an ass and he returned to
[35:19] the land of Egypt and Moses took the rod
[35:22] of God in his hand
[35:28] when did it become the rod of God
[35:31] Amen brother Benham said it was a dry
[35:33] stick that Moses found somewhere in the
[35:35] wilderness amen and Moses when he picked
[35:38] up that stick he didn't know it was the
[35:40] rod of God
[35:41] when he grabbed it when he grabbed a
[35:43] hold of it but yet there was something
[35:45] in Moses's life that God was going to
[35:47] use there was something predestinated
[35:50] about Moses Moses was calling for a
[35:52] specific work he was a specific chosen
[35:54] vessel and here Moses is just living
[35:57] life and in living life his hand he
[36:00] thought in his mind his hand just picked
[36:03] up a random rod and used it for his own
[36:05] purpose not knowing that what he was
[36:08] doing God was going to use because that
[36:10] Rod was the rod of God
[36:14] God will now take that old dry stick and
[36:16] use it for a sign now would be the rod
[36:18] that he holds over the waters to
[36:20] separate the waters it'd be the rod that
[36:22] strikes the rock that brings forth water
[36:23] it would be the rod that is held up in a
[36:26] great battle and as the arms are held up
[36:28] and the rod is held up there's Victory
[36:30] amen so this Rod becomes amazing Rod but
[36:33] what was it it was something in Moses's
[36:36] hand that he picked up of his own he
[36:39] thought thinking and for his own he
[36:41] thought desire but he didn't realize he
[36:44] was going to become a God he was going
[36:46] to come and represent God he was going
[36:49] to be the fleshly manifestation of God
[36:51] coming to deliver his people so Moses is
[36:54] Rod when Moses represented God became
[36:57] God's Rod because he was representing
[36:59] God
[37:03] amen
[37:05] so many things in the Bible are so
[37:07] amazing
[37:09] how Moses Rod could be called God's rod
[37:12] he took the rod of God it was the same
[37:15] Rod but now he himself had become a god
[37:21] he was the representation of God the
[37:23] veil that was veiling God as he was
[37:26] coming to deliver amen and in his hand
[37:29] now was God's Rod Moses wrought yes
[37:32] God's wrought yes was it Moses yes was
[37:35] it God and Moses yes were you looking at
[37:37] Moses or were you looking at God the
[37:39] answer is yes
[37:43] praise God
[37:46] amen
[37:52] you know the message says
[37:54] brother remember says how many knows
[37:56] that his physical body sits on the
[37:58] throne of God and his Spirit returned to
[38:00] the Earth to live in a church to
[38:02] energize it as a vine to the branches
[38:04] certainly then he has no hands but mine
[38:07] and yours
[38:08] he has no eyes but mine and yours
[38:13] it's amazing
[38:15] we'll see this as we go and we'll just
[38:17] keep moving but it becomes so evident as
[38:20] we move forward
[38:22] let's look together to Ephesians we're
[38:24] going to read quite a few scriptures
[38:26] here out of the New Testament so keep
[38:27] your Bibles handy
[38:29] but first we're going to go to the book
[38:30] of Ephesians
[38:48] Ephesians chapter 2.
[38:52] and verse 20.
[38:56] let's start at 19. now therefore you are
[38:59] no more strangers and foreigners but
[39:00] fellow citizens with the Saints and of
[39:02] the household of God and are built upon
[39:05] the foundation of the Apostles and
[39:06] Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the
[39:08] Chief Cornerstone in whom all the
[39:11] buildings fitly framed together growth
[39:13] into a holy Temple in the Lord
[39:15] and whom ye also are building together
[39:17] for a habitation of God through the
[39:20] spirit
[39:21] remember the title where is he
[39:24] where is he you are built together for a
[39:28] temple to the Lord you grew his whole
[39:30] house and you know you cannot say I am
[39:33] the Temple of the Lord but you are part
[39:35] of the Temple of the Lord you're one of
[39:37] the many stones
[39:39] but that doesn't change the fact that if
[39:42] you that if you are tabernacling deity
[39:45] amen if you've been born again by the
[39:47] spirit of God then God is in you
[39:51] amen and then God now is in the
[39:54] habitation in the habitation of God is
[39:57] the many membered body amen so it's the
[39:59] body of God the dwelling place of God
[40:01] the habitation of God Amen and where God
[40:04] has been working in and through flesh
[40:06] all along God is still working in and
[40:09] through flesh he is still veiled he's
[40:11] still tab or not going amen God the in
[40:14] the in the history of the Bible as we
[40:16] look down through the history of the
[40:18] Jews they have sought to have God in
[40:20] their midst amen and God made an
[40:22] allowance for that and they had a had a
[40:25] temple and or had a tabernacle and he
[40:27] had a temple and and all of these things
[40:28] was gone dwelling with them and they
[40:30] would know that the very presence of God
[40:32] is with them because God's behind those
[40:34] skins he's behind those Temple walls
[40:36] he's behind that Veil but it was just a
[40:39] representation it was representation of
[40:42] a greater truth amen because God is not
[40:45] just behind amen a certain veil in one
[40:48] location or a certain temple in one
[40:50] location but gone wants to dwell in his
[40:52] people
[40:54] God wants to stretch his tip further
[40:56] than that and he wants to stretch his
[40:58] tent with man
[41:01] let's look at Acts chapter 7 together
[41:11] foreign
[41:17] Acts chapter 7
[41:20] verse 47. this is the the sermon
[41:25] that Stephen preached just before he was
[41:27] stoned
[41:29] Acts chapter 7 I'm going to begin in
[41:30] verse 47.
[41:32] but Solomon built him a house
[41:35] albeit the most high dwelleth not in
[41:37] temples made with hands as saith the
[41:39] prophet
[41:40] Heaven is my throne and Earth is my
[41:42] first or what house will you build me
[41:43] saith the Lord or what is the place of
[41:46] my rest hath not my hand made all these
[41:50] things
[41:51] so he's saying you know we can't
[41:53] foolishly think that we can build a
[41:55] physical structure that will contain all
[41:57] of God right God is far beyond all of
[42:00] that but God says he would make his
[42:02] presence known there it was a place
[42:04] where they could come in contact with
[42:06] God Amen and and we know that God was
[42:08] greater than their Temple God can't
[42:10] dwell in a house made with hands amen
[42:13] but God wants to dwell in a
[42:16] mini-membered body he desires to live he
[42:19] desires to dwell in flesh in this day in
[42:22] the flesh of his bride amen the body of
[42:25] Jesus Christ
[42:26] not in one location not in one person
[42:29] but in a mini-membered bride
[42:33] and I want to look at where this
[42:35] scripture comes from because uh Stephen
[42:38] is referencing a scripture out of Isaiah
[42:41] 66 so if you keep your hand here in Acts
[42:43] but go to Isaiah 66 I want to read this
[42:47] because it's it's interesting to me
[42:50] what he says next in Isaiah 66.
[42:58] Isaiah 66 verse 1.
[43:03] thus saith the Lord the heaven is my
[43:06] throne and Earth is my footstool where
[43:09] is the house that you built unto me and
[43:11] where is the place of my rest
[43:14] for all those things hath my handmade
[43:17] and all those things have been saith the
[43:20] Lord
[43:21] so that so far is pretty pretty much
[43:24] what Stephen quoted but the sentence is
[43:27] not over the thought is not finished he
[43:30] goes on to say
[43:31] he goes on to say but but to the man but
[43:35] to this man will I look even to him that
[43:38] is poor and of a contrite spirit and
[43:41] trembleth at my word
[43:43] what what house will you build me what
[43:46] what Tabernacle can I have I've made all
[43:49] of these things but I'll tell you this
[43:51] to whom will I look
[43:54] and this word look means to look to
[43:56] regard to pay attention to
[43:59] all that you build and all your
[44:01] structures and all this amen you can't
[44:03] contain me what house will you build me
[44:05] where's the place of my rest but
[44:07] immediately says to this man will I look
[44:09] to will I regard the one that trembleth
[44:12] out my word amen the one that is a
[44:14] contrite spirit and trembleth at my word
[44:16] that's where I'm going to focus my
[44:18] attention
[44:22] again in the unveiling of God
[44:24] brother man says notice then we then we
[44:27] become part of him as you are the veil
[44:30] that veils him
[44:31] you are part of him as long as Christ is
[44:33] in you as Christ was of gone because God
[44:36] was in him made him gone and as Christ
[44:38] is in you the hope of glory you become
[44:41] part of Christ he that believeth on me
[44:43] the works that I do that that I do shall
[44:46] he also see you become part of Christ as
[44:49] long as Christ is hid in you then it's
[44:52] veiled to the unbeliever but you know
[44:54] he's in you you are templing Christ
[44:57] that's behind the veil the skin so now
[45:01] you're templing amen you've become a
[45:03] temple a house a a habitation a place
[45:06] for the spirit of Christ for the spirit
[45:08] of God and now you're templing Christ
[45:10] behind your skin
[45:13] now you're the veil praise be to God
[45:17] behind because of this Veil The Veil
[45:21] again in human flesh hides God the word
[45:24] from the unbeliever
[45:27] now the veil becomes the problem
[45:30] like it always has been the veil becomes
[45:33] the problem Moses came as a veil and
[45:36] behind the veil was God coming to
[45:37] deliver his children but I mean that was
[45:39] a problem to the people that he was
[45:41] going to deliver it was a problem to
[45:43] Pharaoh in his court they couldn't
[45:45] recognize what God was doing because all
[45:48] they saw was the veil amen so he had so
[45:51] many signs and wonders to show to prove
[45:53] that there was something else behind the
[45:55] veil and they were still stumbling out
[45:57] the Veil
[45:59] the same thing's true in our generation
[46:01] gone a sin of Mighty prophet in our day
[46:03] and done Mighty signs and wonders to
[46:05] prove who's behind the veil so much so
[46:08] that he would turn his back to the crowd
[46:09] to show that the same sign that was
[46:11] showed Amen to Abraham on the plains of
[46:14] Moriah are shown here again and he did
[46:16] the exact same thing and in the and they
[46:19] stumbled at the Veil
[46:23] but he says now you are the Veil
[46:27] so where is he
[46:29] he's in you he said you're templing
[46:32] Christ that's behind the veil the skin
[46:36] let's go to First Corinthians chapter 6
[46:38] together
[46:53] First Corinthians chapter 6
[46:55] verse 19.
[46:59] what chapter 6 verse 19 what know you
[47:02] not that your body is the Temple of the
[47:05] Holy Ghost which is in you which you
[47:07] have of God and you are not your own
[47:11] for you are bought with the price
[47:13] therefore glorify God in your body and
[47:16] in your spirit which are gods
[47:18] this body is God's
[47:22] and it's the veil that he's hiding
[47:24] behind
[47:26] it's the temple it says you know you're
[47:28] not that your body is the Temple of the
[47:31] Holy Ghost
[47:33] if so be that you have the Holy Ghost
[47:35] living inside
[47:37] your body is the Temple of the Holy
[47:39] Ghost and so now your body has become
[47:42] the veil you are templing Christ that's
[47:43] behind the veil so where is he he's in
[47:46] you
[47:48] and and the Hebrews chapter 5 and the
[47:51] Hebrew series brother M said now his
[47:53] church is supposed to manifest God to
[47:55] show what God is that's what Moses was
[47:58] doing that's what the prophet in this
[48:00] day was doing that's what this church is
[48:02] supposed to be doing
[48:03] brother Brandon tells us a story of the
[48:06] little boy in the thunderstorm and he
[48:07] cries from Mama and he tells it here in
[48:10] the Mighty God unveiled before us he
[48:12] said Mama I believe every bit of that
[48:13] she's trying to calm him and tell him
[48:15] we're Christians and gods will take care
[48:17] of us and I believe every bit of that
[48:19] but when the lightning is so close he
[48:20] said I want a god with skin on it
[48:23] so I think not only Junior but all of us
[48:25] feel that way when we get together when
[48:28] we pray one for other god with skin on
[48:30] it
[48:31] and we find out here that God has always
[48:35] had skin on him when Moses seen him he
[48:37] had skin on him look like a man when God
[48:39] was behind the curtains he had skin on
[48:41] him and God tonight in his church is
[48:43] veiled in his church with skin on it and
[48:46] he is still the same God tonight we find
[48:48] that
[48:50] but now as ever the skin Veil is what
[48:52] catches the Traditions they just can't
[48:55] believe that is god making them people
[48:57] act like that it's because God is veiled
[48:59] in his church is skin on it that's right
[49:02] and he is hid from the unbeliever and
[49:04] revealed to the believer
[49:07] let's turn to First Corinthians chapter
[49:09] 12 now
[49:13] chapter 12
[49:14] we'll read one verse verse 27.
[49:20] it says now ye are the body of Christ
[49:24] and members in particular
[49:27] this is his body his flesh his skin
[49:31] the veil that he's hiding behind when
[49:34] brother Branham said I preached what
[49:36] Paul preached that's absolutely the
[49:38] truth
[49:38] we're just looking at what Paul's
[49:40] preaching
[49:42] and so Brothers tells us many times he
[49:45] quotes uh Jesus and it's out of John 20
[49:47] and we won't turn there I'll just quote
[49:48] you John 20 21 it says then Jesus said
[49:51] unto them peace be unto you as my father
[49:54] has sent me even so send I you so
[49:56] brother random references this many
[49:58] times and he said how did the father
[50:00] send him the father sent him by going in
[50:03] him
[50:04] so how does Christ send us he sends Us
[50:07] by going in us and that's how he sent
[50:09] the disciples he told them not to begin
[50:11] their Ministry he said but tear you in
[50:13] Jerusalem till you be endued with power
[50:14] from on high so they weren't to be able
[50:16] to go out and spread he told them you're
[50:19] the light of the world go into all
[50:20] nations and preach the gospel he gave
[50:22] him all of these instructions before
[50:23] they left but he was going to send them
[50:25] the same way the father sent him
[50:28] even on the day of Pentecost amen when
[50:30] he came back in the form of the Holy
[50:32] Ghost and divided himself into his
[50:34] Tabernacle now back behind veils then
[50:37] they were sent out in their commission
[50:39] amen he sent them the same way he
[50:41] himself was sent the father went in him
[50:44] now Christ comes in US
[50:47] and those disciples became the Veil
[50:51] that veiled him second Corinthians
[50:54] chapter 5.
[51:00] second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 18.
[51:05] I want to read a lot of scriptures this
[51:07] morning I hope that's okay
[51:09] just do a good old-fashioned Bible study
[51:11] preaching
[51:13] second Corinthians 5 18.
[51:16] and all things are of God who hath
[51:18] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[51:20] and hath given to us the ministry of
[51:23] reconciliation so Jesus Christ did the
[51:25] work of reconciliation but he had given
[51:27] to the disciples the ministry of
[51:29] reconciliation
[51:30] it was a continuation
[51:32] to wit that God was in Christ
[51:34] reconciling the world unto himself not
[51:36] imputing their trespasses unto them and
[51:38] hath committed unto us the word of
[51:40] reconciliation now then we are
[51:43] ambassadors for Christ as though God did
[51:47] beseech You by us now listen he's saying
[51:50] God is calling you with my lips
[51:54] this is what Paul is saying amen we are
[51:57] ambassadors for Christ we're here
[51:59] representing Christ an ambassador
[52:01] represents the Homeland Homeland so now
[52:04] he says we are ambassadors for Christ we
[52:06] are representing Christ as though God
[52:08] did beseech You by us God is talking to
[52:10] you by us
[52:14] amen
[52:15] so now
[52:17] as though God to beseech You by us we
[52:20] pray you in Christ's dead be reconciled
[52:24] to God
[52:25] they're saying we pray you we're in
[52:29] Christ's place
[52:31] or
[52:32] in in Christ that we're here instead of
[52:34] Christ
[52:36] we're here in the place he's in us we're
[52:40] here representing him as though God's
[52:43] calling to you by us we're here in the
[52:45] stead of Christ amen calling you to be
[52:48] reconciled to Christ if you knew who was
[52:51] behind this Veil and who was calling to
[52:54] you you would run because it's not Paul
[52:56] it's the life behind Paul it's the
[52:59] Christ that's in Paul that gave Paul the
[53:01] word it's not Paul's words it's not
[53:03] Paul's a Reconciliation it's Christ
[53:06] reconciliation now working through the
[53:08] mouth of Paul
[53:11] but the veil's always the problem
[53:15] pray you in Christ then
[53:19] be reconciled to God
[53:22] it's good now to Acts chapter 5.
[53:32] I'm just hoping that the picture becomes
[53:34] clear as we move
[53:36] more clear than it was a week ago or a
[53:38] month ago
[53:40] that keeps getting more and more clear
[53:42] Acts chapter 5
[53:44] and it will begin in verse 12.
[53:48] acts 5 and 12 and by the hands of the
[53:50] apostles were many signs and wonders
[53:52] wrought among the people and they were
[53:54] all with one Accord in Solomon's porch
[53:56] and of the rest there's no man join
[53:58] himself to them but the people magnified
[54:00] them
[54:01] and Believers were the more added to the
[54:03] Lord multitudes both of men and of women
[54:08] sorry I'm in the wrong place oh I'm in
[54:10] verse 14. I want to skip down to verse
[54:12] 18. sorry
[54:16] and laid their hands on the apostles and
[54:19] put them in common prison
[54:21] but the angel of the Lord
[54:23] By Night opened the prison doors and
[54:25] brought them out I am not in the right
[54:27] spot
[54:28] no I'm I'm in the wrong spot
[54:31] oh no let's go back to verse 14.
[54:34] sorry every time this happens I wish I
[54:37] had some story behind it like brother
[54:38] branham's with the pages stuck together
[54:39] and I could come back and say that was
[54:42] the Lord that was fulfilled
[54:45] but no it's just me I can't find my
[54:47] place in the Bible
[54:48] it's because my Progressive bifocals are
[54:51] interesting
[54:53] all right
[54:54] let's read verse 14 again and the
[54:57] Believers were the more added to the
[54:58] Lord multitudes both of men and women
[55:00] and so much that they brought forth the
[55:02] sick unto the streets and laid them on
[55:04] the beds and couches that at least the
[55:07] shadow of Peter passing by might
[55:10] overshadow some of them
[55:13] I don't know if that's amazing to you
[55:15] but that's amazing to me
[55:18] they begin to so recognize where God was
[55:21] working
[55:22] they became so convinced that God was
[55:25] with these men
[55:27] that their faith Rose to such a level
[55:29] that they would take their sick and
[55:32] Afflicted and lay it on the street by
[55:34] Chance the shadow not now even touching
[55:37] his body but the shadow that was cast by
[55:40] his body and we're talking about a body
[55:43] of Flesh
[55:44] we're talking about Flash The Flash that
[55:47] denied Christ just shortly before this
[55:50] the flesh that was an illiterate
[55:51] fisherman amen they may have had listen
[55:54] I'm sure many people have had uh Peter's
[55:58] Shadow pass over them at some point in
[56:00] their life if they lived in the same
[56:02] Village as Peter they probably touched
[56:04] him they probably took fish from his
[56:05] hand we weren't healed they weren't
[56:07] delivered but now he is there
[56:09] representing Christ because Christ is in
[56:12] him showing by signs and wonders where
[56:14] he's at in this day and their faith come
[56:17] to such a level that it wasn't even now
[56:19] touching that body but a shadow that
[56:22] would come because of the presence of
[56:25] the body they had enough Faith to stand
[56:27] up and be healed
[56:31] oh my goodness friends I I when when we
[56:35] go back and really think about the
[56:37] things that are in scripture they're
[56:39] absolutely mind-boggling they're be
[56:40] they're beyond understanding amen it's
[56:43] the same body of Flesh that was always
[56:46] there it was that was illiterate that
[56:48] couldn't sign his name on the bill of
[56:50] sale brother Venom was saying amen the
[56:52] same one that fished and sold fish and
[56:54] cursed and swore and all of these things
[56:57] that he did but now he is tabernacling
[57:00] deity in this same flesh man has been
[57:03] converted and now he's a representation
[57:05] of Jesus Christ and the people so see
[57:08] what's behind the veil that the Shadow
[57:10] from the veil Rises their faith to a
[57:13] place they can accept their healing and
[57:14] walk away
[57:18] that's the right kind of respect
[57:21] for the Tabernacle of deity
[57:27] you know I
[57:30] I just marvel at some of these things
[57:34] they begin to so see where God was
[57:37] it became so evident where the
[57:40] supernatural power of God was
[57:42] their faith came to a place
[57:45] where I don't even have to touch him
[57:47] but if a shadow passes over me
[57:53] it's amazing friends
[57:56] and the message the masterpiece
[57:59] remember I said some woman just made a
[58:00] remark coming the other day and said
[58:02] show me where the man has walked and let
[58:05] me walk behind him upon the ground said
[58:07] I'll get well
[58:09] there's some woman who come into
[58:11] Jeffersonville and brother Branham
[58:13] wasn't there and she said that's okay
[58:15] show me where that man walked
[58:18] and I'll walk where he walked and I'll
[58:21] get well
[58:24] you can call it fanaticism but it's like
[58:26] the book of Acts
[58:30] there was an understanding of what was
[58:32] behind the veil
[58:34] there was understanding of what God was
[58:37] doing in that day there was a respect
[58:39] and Brethren says now and the
[58:41] Brotherhood never condemn the woman for
[58:43] that he said now the people believed you
[58:45] like that and you're a representative of
[58:47] Christ then what should we do we should
[58:50] be very careful because you're not only
[58:51] destroying yourself with wrong you're
[58:53] destroying others who are following you
[58:56] that you know you're representing Christ
[58:58] and that that's what the people were
[58:59] recognizing but then you have to be
[59:01] careful now are we here to represent
[59:03] Christ then then we must also be careful
[59:08] with how we live and what we do
[59:12] let's look at Acts 19 let's turn over to
[59:14] Acts 19.
[59:22] Acts 19.
[59:26] verse 11.
[59:34] Acts 19 11 and God wrought special
[59:38] Miracles by the hands of Paul so that
[59:41] from his body we're brought unto the
[59:43] sick handkerchiefs and aprons and the
[59:45] diseases departed from them and the evil
[59:48] spirits went out of them
[59:50] so this is the same man that was Saul
[59:54] and Saul was binding the Christians and
[59:57] having them beat and having them
[59:58] arrested and some were even killed this
[1:00:00] is the same flesh body but now he's
[1:00:03] become a temple he's become a he's now
[1:00:06] templing deity now Christ is on the
[1:00:08] inside of him and now he is so given
[1:00:11] himself over to the word he has become a
[1:00:13] representation of Christ in his day
[1:00:16] and now from the very body they would
[1:00:19] take from the body of Paul aprons and
[1:00:23] handkerchiefs and they would go lay them
[1:00:25] on the sick and the sick would become
[1:00:26] well just taking a garment an apron
[1:00:29] something that was attached to his body
[1:00:30] just taking that not him coming and
[1:00:33] laying hands on them not any of that but
[1:00:35] they they began to understand that God
[1:00:37] is with this man
[1:00:39] God is there Where's God he's there
[1:00:42] is that right
[1:00:44] where is God he's right there he's in
[1:00:46] them people he's in that Apostle he's in
[1:00:48] that Gifted Man there God's working
[1:00:50] right there and so from his very body
[1:00:53] they would take aprons and handkerchiefs
[1:00:56] from his body lay them on the sick and
[1:00:58] their faith was so high amen because
[1:01:00] they knew what was behind the veil amen
[1:01:03] listen there wasn't there wasn't power
[1:01:05] just in Paul's body the power lay in the
[1:01:08] faith of the people to recognize what
[1:01:10] was behind Paul
[1:01:15] I mean this isn't sorcery this isn't
[1:01:17] witchcraft amen it's Faith it's a
[1:01:19] recognition and understanding amen that
[1:01:21] God has that is tabernacling himself in
[1:01:24] that vessel and God's working we're
[1:01:26] there and that's where God's working and
[1:01:28] it was the power behind the veil amen
[1:01:30] that they were respecting
[1:01:34] but to me it just goes to show
[1:01:36] how close this runs
[1:01:39] how tight it really is
[1:01:43] that from his body
[1:01:46] that body was sin born
[1:01:49] from the shadow of Peter
[1:01:52] from a sunborne body
[1:01:54] amen it shows
[1:01:56] where God is
[1:01:59] in the message that ever present water
[1:02:01] from The Rock
[1:02:03] and the power that will raise us up is
[1:02:05] right in us now
[1:02:08] we are now in Heavenly places we are now
[1:02:11] in the power of the Resurrection
[1:02:13] if there wasn't a law to that Sons and
[1:02:15] Daughters of God would create them a
[1:02:16] world out here and go live a private
[1:02:18] life on it
[1:02:19] you have the power in you to do it if
[1:02:22] you've got a shadow of the power of God
[1:02:25] in you
[1:02:26] you got power to do it God is omnipotent
[1:02:29] see what I mean the power that's in you
[1:02:31] will make you could speak a world into
[1:02:33] existence and go live on it Hallelujah
[1:02:36] there you are that's what power is in
[1:02:38] the church now but it is controlled by a
[1:02:41] law and that law is not keeping a bunch
[1:02:43] of Commandments it's a law of faith
[1:02:46] he said all things are possible to them
[1:02:48] that believe and if you can believe it
[1:02:50] whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:02:53] believe that is yours every place the
[1:02:55] soul of your foot can set upon by faith
[1:02:58] God gives it to you amen it's yours you
[1:03:01] possess it if you can find the key to
[1:03:03] this law of faith that opens it to you
[1:03:05] you see what I mean the power is
[1:03:07] controlled if you are a son of God you
[1:03:09] are a daughter of God that never leaves
[1:03:12] you it's with you all the time
[1:03:15] so the power that will raise you where
[1:03:17] is the power that will raise you it's in
[1:03:18] you
[1:03:20] what is the word that we preach what is
[1:03:22] the word that we receive the word that
[1:03:24] we received amen is the word that is
[1:03:26] taking the veil off the power that's in
[1:03:28] you so you'll recognize what's inside of
[1:03:30] you
[1:03:31] because what's in you amen we recognize
[1:03:33] as a son or daughter of God that there
[1:03:35] is an attribute of Peace a portion a
[1:03:37] gene however brother bam said it
[1:03:39] something from God an eternal thought of
[1:03:42] God Eternal attribute of God is laying
[1:03:45] down inside of you amen but it's covered
[1:03:47] over in darkness and it needs the light
[1:03:49] which is the word to remove the darkness
[1:03:52] so that it can spring forth in life and
[1:03:54] manifest itself so the word that we
[1:03:56] received in this day is here to break
[1:03:58] away spiritual Amnesia depart the clowns
[1:04:01] amen so that the light can hit the seed
[1:04:03] so the life can come out because it's
[1:04:05] already there
[1:04:10] if you've got a shadow of the power of
[1:04:12] God if you have received the baptism of
[1:04:15] the Holy Ghost in your soul and it's
[1:04:16] quickened to seed the life the power
[1:04:19] that will raise you up is already in you
[1:04:22] so where is he
[1:04:25] question
[1:04:29] brother M said and the message show us
[1:04:31] the father
[1:04:32] a woman said who did he pray to In The
[1:04:35] Garden of Gethsemane
[1:04:37] on a street meeting one time
[1:04:39] I said I want to ask you something you
[1:04:40] testify you had the Holy Ghost
[1:04:42] where is it at what do you pray to
[1:04:46] it's on the inside of you
[1:04:48] of course
[1:04:50] well we have the spirit with measure he
[1:04:52] had it without measure we are Sons and
[1:04:54] Daughters of God by measure like taking
[1:04:56] a spoonful of water out of the ocean and
[1:04:58] he's the whole ocean but the same
[1:05:00] chemicals that's in the spoon is in the
[1:05:03] whole ocean it's quantity but this is
[1:05:06] it's quantity but the same quality
[1:05:08] therefore Jesus Christ is saying
[1:05:09] yesterday today and forever God is in US
[1:05:13] said that portion you got when when
[1:05:16] Christ came as the pillar of fire and
[1:05:17] broke himself up on the day of Pentecost
[1:05:19] and portioned himself out amongst the
[1:05:22] body now if you take a spoon into the
[1:05:24] ocean brother I'm showing us an analogy
[1:05:26] when you take that spoon out you don't
[1:05:28] have the whole ocean but whatever's in
[1:05:30] the ocean is in the spoon
[1:05:33] the same quality the same chemicals the
[1:05:36] same minerals the same of everything
[1:05:37] amen and we may not say I'm all of God
[1:05:40] no man can say that only Jesus Christ
[1:05:42] can say that amen but they're whatever
[1:05:45] was in him is in me in portion
[1:05:49] praise God
[1:05:51] but I've always thought
[1:05:52] how much God does it take
[1:05:55] to do Supernatural things
[1:05:59] how much God does it take
[1:06:01] maybe a spoonful
[1:06:03] maybe that's enough
[1:06:07] now now I want to I laid all that down
[1:06:13] to get to really what was on my heart
[1:06:15] this is the I'm going to read you the um
[1:06:18] quote that brother Abraham sent me and
[1:06:20] asked me and and the day he asked me I
[1:06:23] had not a not a clue in my mind
[1:06:25] how to help him
[1:06:27] uh
[1:06:29] and I don't even know that needs help
[1:06:31] but I mean I couldn't do anything
[1:06:34] but this is a 1963 out of the message
[1:06:36] Spirit of Truth
[1:06:38] he said and then from then on 600 miles
[1:06:40] the way the crow flies he's talking
[1:06:42] about going up where he hunts with Bud
[1:06:45] Southwick and them up there 600 miles
[1:06:47] away the crow flies there's not even a
[1:06:49] path or a trail when you hit the West
[1:06:51] Coast you go about 800 miles to
[1:06:53] Vancouver there's not even a speck of
[1:06:54] civilization
[1:06:56] and the next civilizations going this
[1:06:58] way is Anchorage about seven or eight
[1:07:00] hundred miles go back this way you run
[1:07:02] into the little city yellow line where
[1:07:04] you get a ship in there once a year for
[1:07:05] the eskimos and next you hit Russia so
[1:07:08] you're really to yourself
[1:07:11] that's what brother remember said no
[1:07:12] this is the next part
[1:07:15] that's where God can take his rest
[1:07:19] up there
[1:07:20] from all of our troubles and trials that
[1:07:23] we've put him into
[1:07:25] so I like to go up there and talk to him
[1:07:28] when he's resting you see
[1:07:30] now brother van was going way off into
[1:07:32] the Wilderness and he's showing you how
[1:07:34] far away it is from everywhere and he
[1:07:36] says that's where God can take his rest
[1:07:39] up there
[1:07:40] from all of our troubles and trials that
[1:07:43] we put him into
[1:07:45] so I like to go up there and talk to him
[1:07:48] when he's resting
[1:07:51] and brother Abraham said what do you
[1:07:53] think he means I said I don't know
[1:07:55] but I started meditating on it and it
[1:07:58] just it wouldn't never leave me you know
[1:08:00] sometimes somebody says something it
[1:08:01] just won't ever leave you
[1:08:03] it's there you don't have an answer you
[1:08:04] don't have a clue what it means but it
[1:08:06] just never leaves you
[1:08:08] so I started asking myself a question
[1:08:11] is there one place on the map
[1:08:14] a vacation place for God
[1:08:17] is there a certain spot where God goes
[1:08:20] to God's a spirit
[1:08:22] and he encompasses space and time he's a
[1:08:26] spirit but he says that's the place
[1:08:28] where God can go take a rest
[1:08:31] from All the Troubles and trials we put
[1:08:33] him into and so I started thinking if
[1:08:36] there is a location
[1:08:38] where God goes the rest
[1:08:40] then I want to get with Billy Paul and
[1:08:43] and brother biscoll and I want to find
[1:08:45] out where I want the pinpoint prick
[1:08:48] where did you camp where was your Trail
[1:08:50] how did you hike in how did you hike out
[1:08:52] because I want to go to that place
[1:08:54] if there's a place that you know God
[1:08:56] goes to do you want to go there
[1:09:01] then the next thing that he says is I
[1:09:04] like to go up there and talk to him when
[1:09:06] he's resting
[1:09:07] so then I think maybe he's not always
[1:09:09] there
[1:09:12] so now not only do I have to find the
[1:09:14] place in the middle of the wilderness
[1:09:16] but I have to know when God will be
[1:09:18] there
[1:09:20] but if there was a place that God would
[1:09:23] be and there was a time he would be
[1:09:25] there would you try to be there
[1:09:28] if you knew God was going to be in this
[1:09:31] spot
[1:09:33] at this time I would do all I can to get
[1:09:36] there
[1:09:37] so I started thinking about this and no
[1:09:40] God doesn't have a particular spot
[1:09:44] but I started asking myself
[1:09:46] what was the prophet doing
[1:09:48] the prophet was going to find rest
[1:09:52] why from All the Troubles and trials
[1:09:55] that the people put him into
[1:09:59] when did he know to go when he got tired
[1:10:04] how did he know God would be there
[1:10:06] how did he know where the place was it's
[1:10:08] like he just kind of found it
[1:10:11] and how did he know the time that God
[1:10:13] would be there but when the prophet got
[1:10:15] tired from the ministry and we realized
[1:10:18] it wasn't his ministry it was Christ in
[1:10:20] him
[1:10:21] but when he got tired from the troubles
[1:10:24] and trials that people put him in he
[1:10:26] wanted to run up there where nobody was
[1:10:28] so that he could have a time of rest and
[1:10:30] lo and behold who should be there when
[1:10:32] he gets there but God himself to comfort
[1:10:34] him and talk to him
[1:10:37] how did God get there how long was he
[1:10:39] there did he have a cabin there was
[1:10:40] there a tent was there a marker on the
[1:10:41] tree no he that is in you amen where was
[1:10:45] he he was in that Prophet when that
[1:10:47] Prophet was going to take his rest this
[1:10:49] is just brother Chad I can't say that
[1:10:51] for sure but that's the way I see it in
[1:10:53] the light of the scriptures and the word
[1:10:55] we're looking at that he was in that
[1:10:57] little man and when that little man
[1:10:58] needed to take a rest God was resting
[1:11:00] with him
[1:11:03] because God promised to never leave you
[1:11:06] more forsaking
[1:11:08] amen and when God was there resting
[1:11:11] was there no more God helping the rest
[1:11:13] of his children all over the Earth
[1:11:16] was God resting from all his works and
[1:11:18] nobody was healed during that trip
[1:11:21] nobody was praying to God and getting it
[1:11:23] delivered he realized God was there with
[1:11:25] the prophet resting but he was also with
[1:11:27] another one of his children doing
[1:11:28] whatever that child was doing and he was
[1:11:30] with another one doing whatever if it
[1:11:32] was Ministry he was ministering it was
[1:11:34] preaching he was preaching he was
[1:11:35] praying it was mothering of his father
[1:11:37] and amen if it was resting God was with
[1:11:39] his children amen God has veiled himself
[1:11:42] and flashed and attached himself to his
[1:11:45] children and when brother Branham needed
[1:11:47] a rest and he needed to get away from
[1:11:49] the people and he ran up there for a
[1:11:51] rest who should he find up there but God
[1:11:53] doing the same thing taking a rest
[1:11:59] amen
[1:12:01] this so began to encourage me
[1:12:06] because when I need to find God
[1:12:10] when I need to get in touch with God
[1:12:13] where am I going to go
[1:12:15] when I need an answer from God when I
[1:12:18] need to come in contact with the Living
[1:12:19] God when I need to meet him face to face
[1:12:22] because I have such a need I need an
[1:12:24] answer where am I going to go am I going
[1:12:26] to try to go to Northern British
[1:12:27] Columbia and find the spot on the map
[1:12:29] and predict what time he'll be there am
[1:12:31] I going to run to some church somewhere
[1:12:33] or some Minister somewhere where am I
[1:12:35] going to go when I need to find God Amen
[1:12:38] the god I need is the god that's in me
[1:12:41] maybe what I need to do sometimes is get
[1:12:43] away from all the noise amen and
[1:12:45] separate myself from All the Troubles
[1:12:48] and trials that are going on and get
[1:12:49] quiet and find some rest and find hey lo
[1:12:52] and behold God's here resting too
[1:12:55] and brother bam says I like to go up
[1:12:58] there and talk to him
[1:13:00] when he's resting
[1:13:03] whatever brother Ben what was he looking
[1:13:05] for he was looking for a break a rest
[1:13:07] getting away from the troubles and and
[1:13:10] communing with God Amen God was there
[1:13:13] communing with him and the question is
[1:13:15] how did God get there did he fly up
[1:13:17] there did he I would say that wherever
[1:13:20] brother Branham was going God was in
[1:13:21] route to that place
[1:13:23] when he was riding in a car with brother
[1:13:25] bisco he was going when they when they
[1:13:27] got the brother Ed's uh Bud southwick's
[1:13:29] house he was there in Bud southwick's
[1:13:31] house amen then when they got on
[1:13:32] Horseback to go further in God was on
[1:13:34] horseback
[1:13:37] do you understand what I'm saying
[1:13:40] he's with you
[1:13:42] the power you need to Rise Above This
[1:13:44] World is in you now if you have a shadow
[1:13:47] of the power of God everything is
[1:13:49] possible amen we need to quit running
[1:13:51] all over trying to find something what
[1:13:53] we need to do is get quiet and recognize
[1:13:55] who's inside
[1:13:57] who's here who's with us amen if you say
[1:14:01] I need a break I need to talk to God
[1:14:02] Amen then find a place where you can get
[1:14:05] yourself quiet and talk to God because
[1:14:08] God is with you
[1:14:12] Oh I thought I began to when I began to
[1:14:15] meditate on this I thought if there was
[1:14:17] such a place we would build a camp
[1:14:21] that would be a Minister's retreat
[1:14:24] and we would all go in fact you you
[1:14:26] couldn't find a booking it'd probably be
[1:14:28] booked out years in advance
[1:14:30] but I thought that doesn't match the
[1:14:32] scripture that's not what he taught us
[1:14:36] I believe when God was taking his rest
[1:14:38] he was taking his rest in that prophet
[1:14:41] and while he was resting in that prophet
[1:14:44] he was still working in others
[1:14:52] let's go to John chapter 14. I want to
[1:14:54] read a few more scriptures
[1:15:15] John chapter 14. verse 18.
[1:15:19] I will not leave you comfortless
[1:15:22] I will come to you
[1:15:27] he said he was going to go to the father
[1:15:28] and ask the father to send a comforter
[1:15:32] but now he's promised to be the
[1:15:34] comforter
[1:15:36] and he says I will not leave you
[1:15:38] comfortless
[1:15:39] I will come to you yet a little while in
[1:15:42] the world seeth me no more but ye see me
[1:15:44] because I live you shall live also at
[1:15:47] that day you shall know that I am in my
[1:15:49] father and I and ye and me
[1:15:52] and I in you
[1:15:55] where is he
[1:15:56] he's in his believing child
[1:15:59] and he promised to be what what was he
[1:16:02] going to be he was going to be a
[1:16:04] comforter
[1:16:06] he said I will not leave you comfortless
[1:16:09] I'll send somebody else no I will not
[1:16:10] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[1:16:14] and in that day you'll know that the
[1:16:16] father is in me you and me and I in you
[1:16:19] where is the comforter he's in you when
[1:16:21] you need comfort there's no reason to go
[1:16:23] running around all over the place the
[1:16:25] comforter he's promised to be in you
[1:16:32] in the uniting time and signs brother
[1:16:34] bam says the world become the word
[1:16:35] becomes you and you become the word
[1:16:37] Jesus said at that day you know what all
[1:16:39] the father is I am and all I am you are
[1:16:43] and all you are I am
[1:16:47] can we can we can we
[1:16:49] take that in and soak it in just a
[1:16:51] minute
[1:16:52] can I read that one more time
[1:16:55] all right
[1:16:57] all the father is I am
[1:17:00] all I am you are
[1:17:03] all you are I am
[1:17:08] so where is the I am
[1:17:12] he's in his people
[1:17:16] in that day you'll know that I'm in the
[1:17:18] Father the father and me I in you and
[1:17:20] you and me see at that day
[1:17:23] what day
[1:17:24] this day
[1:17:26] we find out the great hidden mysteries
[1:17:28] of God being revealed
[1:17:31] you see why this Revelation at the end
[1:17:34] time the great mystery of God being
[1:17:35] revealed under the seventh seal begins
[1:17:38] to kill the denominational influence
[1:17:41] because now I don't need the church to
[1:17:44] find God God's in me
[1:17:46] and it doesn't mean that God doesn't use
[1:17:48] the church it doesn't mean God's not
[1:17:50] using a body of people we can never
[1:17:52] disregard any of that but there was a
[1:17:54] false concept that if I align myself
[1:17:57] with the right church or the right
[1:17:58] theology or the right denomination then
[1:18:00] I was aligning myself with God and I
[1:18:02] would be fine but now the the revelation
[1:18:05] of the hour is that that he that's in
[1:18:07] you amen the revelation of the hour is
[1:18:10] that God Amen wanted to be a family and
[1:18:12] God portioned himself out over time his
[1:18:15] attributes and he was bringing
[1:18:16] attributes to Life by the word but in
[1:18:18] the end time he brought the fullness of
[1:18:20] the word to display the full attribute
[1:18:21] of a bride of Jesus Christ and in that
[1:18:24] Revelation it's to the individual not to
[1:18:26] a group to kill the whole idea of
[1:18:28] denomination because I don't have to run
[1:18:30] a certain place to find God that at the
[1:18:33] seed of life in me has come to life by
[1:18:35] the Holy Ghost I can find God wherever I
[1:18:38] am because God is in me
[1:18:41] it was always there laying dormant it
[1:18:43] was always there remember when it sprung
[1:18:46] the life I began to realize it was there
[1:18:48] and now the word that's coming forth is
[1:18:50] washing me and cleansing me and moving
[1:18:52] everything out of the way so that this
[1:18:54] life in me can take preeminence in me
[1:18:57] and it can accomplish everything that
[1:18:59] needs accomplished from the life on the
[1:19:01] inside
[1:19:04] then we realize we're tabernacling
[1:19:07] deity we're templing Christ
[1:19:10] that we are the habitation of God we are
[1:19:12] the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:14] all of a sudden in every trial
[1:19:17] with every need with every great
[1:19:20] obstacle
[1:19:21] amen the the
[1:19:24] overcoming power is inside
[1:19:30] now in every great trial and through
[1:19:33] every great difficult circumstance
[1:19:37] you know when when Moses was leading the
[1:19:40] children of Israel out of Egypt he come
[1:19:43] into an possible situation in the
[1:19:45] impossible situation was the Red Sea and
[1:19:48] the Pharaoh's Army and all of this but
[1:19:50] but he began to cry out to God and God
[1:19:52] says why cry to me speak
[1:19:55] you're the vessel of the hour you're
[1:19:58] you're the one I'm using you're the one
[1:20:00] I called I'm working through you now you
[1:20:02] speak amen and he spoke and he held up
[1:20:05] the rod and the waters parted
[1:20:08] because God whatever whatever Moses
[1:20:11] needed God whatever the children of
[1:20:13] Israel needed Moses needed was going to
[1:20:14] come through that vessel
[1:20:16] that was God working in that day
[1:20:19] now God is working through a
[1:20:20] many-membered bride and God is working
[1:20:22] through these vessels
[1:20:25] but now when I when I come into trouble
[1:20:28] trouble sometimes if I come into
[1:20:31] difficult circumstances
[1:20:33] you know sometimes what we need to do is
[1:20:35] just hold steady
[1:20:37] and not run around and get paranoid and
[1:20:40] scared and running trying to solve
[1:20:42] problems but maybe we just need to hold
[1:20:44] steady and say you know if I have a
[1:20:47] shadow of the power of God there's
[1:20:48] enough power laying inside of me right
[1:20:50] now to speak worlds into existence and
[1:20:52] go live a private life on it
[1:20:54] but it's controlled by a law and that
[1:20:57] law is Faith and faith is not just an
[1:20:59] unanchored thing floating around but
[1:21:01] faith is solidly anchored in the word of
[1:21:03] God
[1:21:04] so now that power operates by faith and
[1:21:07] faith is founded on God's word
[1:21:10] so now when I come into a difficult
[1:21:12] situation I know the power lays there
[1:21:14] ready to be Unleashed to solve the
[1:21:16] problem but what will unleash it will be
[1:21:19] when I have faith on the word of God so
[1:21:21] what do I need I need to hear the word
[1:21:24] of God faith cometh by hearing hearing
[1:21:26] by the word of God and when God quickens
[1:21:28] that word to me Faith Rises the power is
[1:21:30] already there to believe it and
[1:21:32] whatsoever you believe you can have
[1:21:37] praise God
[1:21:40] this
[1:21:41] ends the whole idea of group therapy
[1:21:44] group think
[1:21:46] group group group
[1:21:49] because now
[1:21:51] Moses didn't have a group
[1:21:54] it was him and God
[1:21:56] when David faced Goliath he didn't have
[1:21:58] a group
[1:22:00] some of the trials that we Face we don't
[1:22:02] have a group
[1:22:03] we thank God for Fellowship we gain
[1:22:05] strength from fellowship
[1:22:07] one another we encourage one another
[1:22:09] we're supposed to be connected with the
[1:22:11] body of Christ we're not supposed to be
[1:22:12] disconnected we're supposed to be
[1:22:13] connected
[1:22:15] but we have to realize that that what
[1:22:18] God wants to accomplish in my life he
[1:22:20] has put something in me to believe his
[1:22:22] word
[1:22:23] he can do it
[1:22:25] I don't need the I don't need to act
[1:22:27] like I've lost my mind and forgot who I
[1:22:30] was
[1:22:31] but I can stop and say
[1:22:33] God I need a little rest
[1:22:35] I want to find you where you're resting
[1:22:37] and talk to you for a minute
[1:22:39] I have some needs and
[1:22:41] I I have no place else to go
[1:22:45] but I believe that greater is you that's
[1:22:47] in me than he that's in the world
[1:22:50] that none of these circumstances
[1:22:52] surrounding me can overpower the life on
[1:22:54] the inside
[1:22:55] sometimes we just need to go find him
[1:22:58] where he's resting
[1:22:59] away from the troubles and tribulations
[1:23:02] that people put them into and go to
[1:23:04] talking to him
[1:23:07] we talk to everybody else
[1:23:09] why don't we talk to him
[1:23:14] you know
[1:23:15] let's learn to Matthew 28.
[1:23:30] Matthew 28 verse 18.
[1:23:41] and Jesus came and spake unto them
[1:23:42] saying all power is given unto me in
[1:23:45] heaven and in Earth go you therefore and
[1:23:47] teach All Nations baptizing them in the
[1:23:49] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:23:51] the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe
[1:23:53] all things whatsoever I have commanded
[1:23:55] you and lo I Am with You alway
[1:23:59] even to the end of the world
[1:24:02] there was these times that these
[1:24:04] disciples were alone
[1:24:06] they didn't all go 12 at a time
[1:24:11] but they would go to different parts in
[1:24:13] different areas and Philip was in
[1:24:14] Samaria doing something and someone else
[1:24:16] was somewhere else and
[1:24:19] but they had a promise
[1:24:22] go I am with you always
[1:24:25] even to the end of the world
[1:24:27] no matter what dark kernel corner of the
[1:24:30] world they would find themselves in
[1:24:31] whether in a prison cell or a king's
[1:24:34] Palace standing before Agrippa or or
[1:24:36] before Caesar's Court he was always
[1:24:39] there
[1:24:40] he promised he would be
[1:24:43] you know there's times that we feel all
[1:24:46] alone
[1:24:47] is there any time you ever feel all
[1:24:48] alone forsaken abandoned with with no
[1:24:52] power to overcome and nothing you feel
[1:24:54] completely alone
[1:24:56] many times when you've had agonizing
[1:24:58] prayer in the night there's nobody you
[1:25:00] can call or nobody can come to your your
[1:25:02] by yourself
[1:25:04] but the reality is you're not by
[1:25:06] yourself
[1:25:08] the reality is we've never been forsaken
[1:25:10] we've never been for abandoned and we've
[1:25:12] never been alone those are only feelings
[1:25:16] and the feelings are real in a certain
[1:25:18] realm they're real but in another realm
[1:25:21] they're not real
[1:25:23] only in your spirit realm where they're
[1:25:25] real that's the only place that they
[1:25:27] exist
[1:25:28] because those feelings don't exist
[1:25:30] anywhere else they only exist in your
[1:25:32] own personal Spirit Realm
[1:25:35] right
[1:25:36] and those feelings can shut us down so
[1:25:39] much but they're they're very temporal
[1:25:41] they're real in that world but they're
[1:25:43] not real in the word of God Amen because
[1:25:45] the word of God's not looking at how we
[1:25:47] feel about a thing it's looking at the
[1:25:49] reality of it
[1:25:52] and the reality is there's no weapon
[1:25:54] formed against these that shall prosper
[1:25:56] I will be with you always even to the
[1:25:58] end of the world we have so many
[1:25:59] promises I will not leave you
[1:26:01] comfortless but I will come to you we
[1:26:03] have a comforter we have a power we have
[1:26:05] we have a living God that's with us we
[1:26:08] need to sometimes look past the temporal
[1:26:10] things and deal with them of course deal
[1:26:12] with them you can't you can't make
[1:26:14] believe that they're not there
[1:26:16] when you feel alone you can't pretend I
[1:26:18] don't feel alone but you have to confess
[1:26:20] the word and says I am not alone
[1:26:22] it's amazing how powerful it is just to
[1:26:25] confess the word of God remember the
[1:26:27] power of God's word was a spoken word
[1:26:30] sometimes we just have to take the word
[1:26:32] of God and put it on our lips when we're
[1:26:33] feeling all alone and isolated and like
[1:26:36] nobody knows the struggle we're going
[1:26:37] through and you can say God you promised
[1:26:40] to be with me always even to the end of
[1:26:41] the world and I'm not alone because
[1:26:43] you're my comfort and you've promised to
[1:26:45] come and comfort me
[1:26:46] and you'd be surprised at how powerful
[1:26:49] it is just to speak the word
[1:26:52] because it brings us back to reality
[1:26:56] the false reality begins to diminish and
[1:26:58] the true reality begins to take over
[1:27:00] when we speak the words of eternal life
[1:27:03] that are always true
[1:27:06] amen
[1:27:08] let's go to Psalms 139.
[1:27:11] this is the scripture
[1:27:13] that brother Elmer mentioned to me
[1:27:18] he made a statement and this is the
[1:27:19] other thing that sparked this whole
[1:27:21] thought these things come together here
[1:27:24] Psalms 139
[1:27:27] verse 7.
[1:27:32] Psalms 139 and 7.
[1:27:36] wither shall I go from thy Spirit or
[1:27:38] wither shall I flee from thy presence
[1:27:41] if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art
[1:27:44] there if I make my bed in hell behold
[1:27:47] Thou Art there
[1:27:49] if I take the wings of the morning and
[1:27:51] dwell in the uttermost part of the sea
[1:27:52] even there shall thy hand lead me and
[1:27:55] thy right hand shall hold me
[1:27:58] my goodness
[1:28:01] think about this statement
[1:28:03] this is the one that Elmer mentioned to
[1:28:05] me this one verse this part said
[1:28:09] um let me find it here yeah in verse 8
[1:28:11] if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art
[1:28:14] there
[1:28:18] why because a child of God is always a
[1:28:22] child of God
[1:28:23] and there's an attribute of God that's
[1:28:25] with that child of God and you can never
[1:28:27] get away from it and he says that David
[1:28:29] says do I make my bed in hell you're
[1:28:31] there
[1:28:34] you know when when Abraham Abraham was
[1:28:37] called of God Amen and he called to go
[1:28:39] out of the land of the Chaldeans and and
[1:28:41] into the what would be the promised land
[1:28:43] into the land of inheritance amen and as
[1:28:46] he was moving brother bear says God was
[1:28:48] watching everywhere he went God never
[1:28:51] stopped watching Abraham even when
[1:28:53] Abraham didn't immediately obey and go
[1:28:55] straight to the land God was still there
[1:28:57] even when he was in the land amen God
[1:28:59] was there even when he left the land
[1:29:01] contrary to the word of God and went
[1:29:04] down to Egypt God was there
[1:29:07] so think about this God's word put him
[1:29:09] in the land Abraham's reasoning in a
[1:29:12] time of famine took him out of the land
[1:29:14] so what did Abraham do he left the word
[1:29:18] and he went down into Egypt and he left
[1:29:20] the word and went into Egypt but while
[1:29:22] he was in Egypt it wasn't as though God
[1:29:24] forsook him God couldn't forsake Him He
[1:29:26] was a seed Gene of God God delivered him
[1:29:29] because God was there and knew watching
[1:29:31] over him delivered him and brought him
[1:29:33] back to the word
[1:29:36] sometimes we've seen people leave the
[1:29:38] word or we ourselves have left the word
[1:29:40] in one way or another and you think well
[1:29:42] that's it they're gone they're never
[1:29:44] gone if God is with them amen if they've
[1:29:46] been predestinated and they have a
[1:29:48] sieging of God on the inside God was
[1:29:51] watching over them before they ever
[1:29:52] believed the word God is watching over
[1:29:54] them through every mistake it doesn't
[1:29:56] mean he won't chastise them they won't
[1:29:57] suffer for it but God is never going to
[1:30:00] lose himself
[1:30:01] [Applause]
[1:30:03] and when Abraham left the word God
[1:30:05] didn't leave Abraham he may have he may
[1:30:07] have got punished for it he may have got
[1:30:10] chastised for it but he wasn't going to
[1:30:12] say well there you go buddy I was going
[1:30:14] to take care of you but I'm not going to
[1:30:15] take care of you anymore
[1:30:17] I was going to make a prospered Nation
[1:30:19] out of you no
[1:30:22] he was there watching over him
[1:30:24] protecting Sarah making sure that that
[1:30:27] wound was protected because it was the
[1:30:29] word watching over Abraham making sure
[1:30:30] he wasn't killed amen he was bringing
[1:30:33] plagues into the house of pharaoh
[1:30:36] he was working
[1:30:39] with a disobedient sign
[1:30:42] to bring him back into the land
[1:30:47] I'm so thankful that God's been watching
[1:30:49] me
[1:30:51] I didn't have power to watch over myself
[1:30:53] I didn't have the ability to always make
[1:30:55] right choices in fact in myself in this
[1:30:58] Veil that God's tabernacled in is all
[1:31:00] kinds of wrong desires and wrong
[1:31:02] thoughts and deceptions and
[1:31:03] self-deception that would get me a
[1:31:05] million miles away from right so it's
[1:31:07] not the veil that we can put any stock
[1:31:08] in but it's God behind the veil
[1:31:11] that's constantly correcting us and
[1:31:13] bringing us back in line because he
[1:31:15] promised to never leave us or forsake us
[1:31:17] he's promised amen that he would watch
[1:31:19] over us he's promised that he would
[1:31:21] bring us to an expected end
[1:31:24] suffer yes chastisement yes suffering
[1:31:28] for our wrongs absolutely reaping what
[1:31:29] we sow without a doubt
[1:31:32] but he's not going to forsake us
[1:31:35] he's going to bring us back
[1:31:38] David's saying there's no place I can go
[1:31:41] to hide from you
[1:31:44] Abraham couldn't hide in Egypt he
[1:31:47] couldn't hide in garage
[1:31:49] there's no place that we can go to hide
[1:31:51] from God
[1:31:53] when brother Branham went
[1:31:56] hundreds of miles from any civilization
[1:31:59] you found God there
[1:32:03] how did he get there
[1:32:05] amen
[1:32:07] amen praise be to God
[1:32:10] to God in the jail cell
[1:32:13] he was with Paul and Barnabas
[1:32:15] he was in jail
[1:32:19] when he stood in the courts of king of
[1:32:22] grip or Felix and Agrippa God was there
[1:32:26] when he stood in the court of Caesar God
[1:32:27] was there when he was on a ship as a as
[1:32:30] a a soldier uh not a soldier but as a
[1:32:33] prisoner on a prison ship Bound for for
[1:32:36] for Rome God was there
[1:32:41] amen no matter what you've been through
[1:32:43] God is there
[1:32:46] if you're a child of God
[1:32:48] if God's attribute is in you God has
[1:32:51] been watching over you all your life
[1:32:53] he knows the way you take
[1:32:56] and when you're tried you shall come
[1:32:57] forth as gold
[1:33:01] let's go to Psalms 23.
[1:33:18] Psalms 23 verse 1.
[1:33:22] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[1:33:24] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[1:33:26] Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still
[1:33:28] Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth
[1:33:31] me in the paths of righteousness for his
[1:33:33] name's sake yea though I walk through
[1:33:35] the valley of the shadow of death I will
[1:33:38] fear no evil for thou art with me
[1:33:42] thyroid and thy staff they comfort me
[1:33:46] you know David wasn't Fearless because
[1:33:49] he was Brave
[1:33:51] he wasn't Fearless because he was mighty
[1:33:53] he was Fearless because he knew God was
[1:33:56] with him
[1:33:57] he was Fearless because he knew the
[1:33:59] shepherd was leading him and he knew the
[1:34:01] shepherd was with him amen and that's
[1:34:04] what made him not fear it wasn't
[1:34:06] anything to do with David it was had
[1:34:08] everything to do with the Shepherd that
[1:34:10] was shepherding David
[1:34:12] and listen there's nothing that we need
[1:34:14] to be afraid of
[1:34:16] whether it be sickness a diagnosis from
[1:34:18] the doctor a a tragedy in life there
[1:34:22] even even the falling apart of
[1:34:25] governments or the collapsing of
[1:34:27] economies there is nothing that we need
[1:34:29] to be afraid of and though we walk
[1:34:31] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:34:32] death we can fear no evil because he's
[1:34:35] promised to be with us it's his word
[1:34:38] amen he made the word we didn't he said
[1:34:40] it it's his reputation that's on the
[1:34:42] line not ours and if we have faith in
[1:34:44] what he said amen we can just walk
[1:34:47] knowing we can put our hand in his and
[1:34:49] he'll lead us right through I don't know
[1:34:51] what will happen tomorrow but I know
[1:34:53] that he already has a plan
[1:34:56] I don't know how to get from A to B I
[1:34:59] don't know how to navigate some of these
[1:35:01] obstacles but I know beyond a shadow of
[1:35:03] a doubt that he promised that he would
[1:35:05] be a comforter to me and he would never
[1:35:06] leave me nor forsake me
[1:35:17] it's gonna go to First John chapter 4. I
[1:35:21] just want to lay all these scriptures in
[1:35:22] because I want them to become pillars to
[1:35:25] us
[1:35:27] something that we never forget and they
[1:35:29] I want them to become for me living
[1:35:31] realities so first John I'm sorry first
[1:35:33] John not the Gospel of John but first
[1:35:35] John
[1:35:37] chapter 4.
[1:35:45] first John 4 and 4. year of God little
[1:35:48] children and have overcome them because
[1:35:51] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:35:54] that is in the world
[1:35:56] is that the truth
[1:35:58] can you bank on it
[1:36:00] can you believe it in the face of every
[1:36:02] obstacle
[1:36:03] can you believe it in the face of
[1:36:05] governments and economies and can we
[1:36:08] always believe this
[1:36:15] let's go to Hebrews 13.
[1:36:19] Hebrews 13 and while you're turning
[1:36:21] there I'm going to read out of
[1:36:22] Deuteronomy 31 it's the scripture that
[1:36:25] Hebrews is referencing that Paul
[1:36:26] references in Deuteronomy 31 6 it says
[1:36:28] be strong and of good courage fear not
[1:36:30] nor be afraid of them for the Lord thy
[1:36:33] God he it is that doth go with thee he
[1:36:36] will not fail thee nor forsake thee this
[1:36:40] is the instruction that Moses is giving
[1:36:41] to the nation of Israel as they're about
[1:36:43] to go into the promised land and possess
[1:36:45] all the promised land that's given to
[1:36:47] them and Moses says be strong and of
[1:36:49] good courage fear not nor be afraid of
[1:36:51] them listen there were walled cities
[1:36:53] there was Giants there was everything
[1:36:56] there that you could be afraid of and
[1:36:58] these are not trained soldiers these are
[1:37:00] slaves that have come out been living
[1:37:02] now in a Wilderness without a City
[1:37:03] without a a fixed location for 40 years
[1:37:06] how organized could they be you know
[1:37:09] how militarily trained but yet in every
[1:37:12] battle God gave them victory
[1:37:16] and he says so this is the context that
[1:37:20] he's given this instruction be not
[1:37:22] afraid of them for the Lord thy God he
[1:37:24] it is that doth go with thee
[1:37:27] that's the key to everything
[1:37:30] is that he's with thee
[1:37:33] he it is that go with thee he will not
[1:37:36] fail thee nor forsake thee now in
[1:37:39] Hebrews 13
[1:37:41] Paul is writing now and he says in verse
[1:37:43] 5
[1:37:45] let your conversation be without
[1:37:46] Covetous covetousness and be content
[1:37:49] with such things as you have for he hath
[1:37:51] said I will never leave thee nor forsake
[1:37:54] thee so that we may that we may boldly
[1:37:57] say the Lord is my helper I will not
[1:38:00] fear what man shall do unto me
[1:38:03] so Paul takes that whole um
[1:38:07] scenario where Moses is giving
[1:38:09] instructions and now he brings it right
[1:38:11] into the New Testament to the New
[1:38:12] Testament Church and he says because
[1:38:14] he's promised never to forsake thee then
[1:38:17] you can you can then so that we may
[1:38:20] boldly say the Lord is my helper and I
[1:38:22] will not fear what man shall do unto me
[1:38:25] who's writing this the Apostle Paul is
[1:38:28] writing this who is this man that's
[1:38:30] writing this the man who has been beaten
[1:38:32] the man who has been Shipwrecked the man
[1:38:33] who has been stoned and left for dead
[1:38:35] the man who has been imprisoned and in
[1:38:38] Chains and has been held captive for
[1:38:40] years and now being taken to Caesar to
[1:38:43] stand trial amen and this is the man who
[1:38:46] would eventually be beheaded
[1:38:48] you know what he says
[1:38:50] I will not I can boldly say we will not
[1:38:53] fear what man can do to me
[1:38:56] because when Jesus stood in front of
[1:38:59] pilate pilate says don't you know that I
[1:39:01] have power to release thee or I have
[1:39:02] power to kill thee and he says you have
[1:39:04] no power unless it were given to you
[1:39:06] from above
[1:39:07] what a revelation Jesus could stand
[1:39:10] there knowing that God has orchestrated
[1:39:12] the whole thing and that he has a
[1:39:13] purpose to fulfill and nothing is going
[1:39:16] to disturb distract him from that
[1:39:18] purpose and if it means that he must go
[1:39:20] to a corporal punishment under the Roman
[1:39:23] system then there's no way to sort it
[1:39:25] that's what's going to happen but not
[1:39:27] because pilate has power but because God
[1:39:29] has allowed it
[1:39:31] and the same thing in our lives nothing
[1:39:33] is going to happen to us unless God has
[1:39:35] allowed it for his purpose and for our
[1:39:37] good
[1:39:39] so he will never forsake us
[1:39:44] brother Brown says in the message it is
[1:39:46] the rising of the Sun
[1:39:48] it says no wonder he said fear not
[1:39:51] for now notice we are Redeemed by him
[1:39:53] and now risen with him that's what
[1:39:56] Easter means to the people risen with
[1:39:58] him notice now we have his spirit in us
[1:40:01] the abstract deed fully paid
[1:40:04] it's amazing we have already Resurrected
[1:40:07] if somebody comes to you and says you
[1:40:10] know if you preach the gospel again I'm
[1:40:12] going to kill you
[1:40:14] you can say well you can't kill me
[1:40:18] and they may have the ability to pull
[1:40:20] the trigger
[1:40:22] but I've already have eternal life
[1:40:24] I can't die
[1:40:27] you see how Revelation is so much higher
[1:40:29] than what the world calls reality
[1:40:31] there's another reality that's greater
[1:40:33] than this reality this is the vapor this
[1:40:35] is the Mist
[1:40:37] when somebody threatens you you don't
[1:40:39] have to respond to the threat when they
[1:40:41] try to evoke fear you don't have to
[1:40:43] respond to the fear because I I'm not my
[1:40:46] own I'm bought with a price this very
[1:40:49] veil has been purchased by the blood of
[1:40:50] Jesus Christ and now God is templing
[1:40:53] himself inside nothing's going to happen
[1:40:55] to this if if you have power to do it
[1:40:57] then you should do it
[1:41:01] if you have power to do it then you
[1:41:03] should do it because that means God's
[1:41:04] allowed you
[1:41:06] but if God has another purpose for this
[1:41:08] vessel God will stop you
[1:41:13] that's what
[1:41:15] Easter means now we have a spirit in us
[1:41:18] the abstract deed fully paid no you
[1:41:20] don't say well I hope I make it you've
[1:41:23] already made it
[1:41:25] not I will make it I've already made it
[1:41:29] listen you you can't even say I know I'm
[1:41:32] gonna make it
[1:41:34] you've already made it
[1:41:36] that terminology is not even necessary
[1:41:38] anymore amen because it's not something
[1:41:40] that's going to happen it's something
[1:41:42] that has happened and what has happened
[1:41:43] we'll show forth and declare itself
[1:41:46] because it's already happened it's not
[1:41:48] something we're pressing to it's
[1:41:50] something we're resting on
[1:41:53] right we're not pressing to the change
[1:41:56] in the body we're resting on the fact
[1:41:58] that he's already resurrected me out of
[1:42:00] the deadness of sin and trespasses have
[1:42:01] said I've already come to New Life in
[1:42:03] Christ Jesus I'm not pressing I'm
[1:42:05] resting amen I'm not pressing for
[1:42:08] salvation I'm resting upon the work that
[1:42:10] he did at Calvary for me
[1:42:13] it's already done
[1:42:17] now you don't say well I hope I make it
[1:42:19] you've already made it
[1:42:21] he said you don't say I will make it
[1:42:24] I've already made it I never made it he
[1:42:27] made it for me
[1:42:29] see not me him well brother Brandon they
[1:42:32] say I don't care what they say there he
[1:42:34] made it for me that's all I want I'm I'm
[1:42:37] caring about
[1:42:38] I just want to see him manifested
[1:42:42] now this is what he says I want you to
[1:42:43] listen carefully this I just want to see
[1:42:45] Memphis do you want to see me manifested
[1:42:47] is that our calling in this day to let
[1:42:50] Christ be manifest through us he said I
[1:42:52] just want to see you manifested he said
[1:42:54] how do you do it call him down
[1:42:57] no he's in you
[1:43:01] the manifestation is in you
[1:43:03] the power to live the word is in you
[1:43:06] amen it's not calling him down remember
[1:43:09] when the the disciples were in the ship
[1:43:11] being tossed about and the Raging Waves
[1:43:14] in the storm and they begin to fear for
[1:43:16] their lives amen Jesus was in the boat
[1:43:20] he was in the boat he was sleeping Amen
[1:43:23] in the boat and and brother bam preaches
[1:43:25] a message called wake go wake Jesus amen
[1:43:28] and showing that the solution was
[1:43:30] already in the boat with them they
[1:43:32] didn't need any outside force or outside
[1:43:34] help the help that they needed was with
[1:43:37] them
[1:43:39] he was in the boat
[1:43:41] amen God's called us to manifest his
[1:43:44] very life where will I go to do it the
[1:43:46] power is already in me the life is
[1:43:48] already in me I just need to get myself
[1:43:50] out of the way and quit thinking my own
[1:43:53] thoughts and stay focused on his word
[1:43:54] and release him release my own thinking
[1:43:58] and allow his thinking to come forth
[1:44:01] the manifestation is already inside
[1:44:05] so you know when Jesus was in the boat
[1:44:09] the
[1:44:11] the disciples were safe but they didn't
[1:44:15] feel safe
[1:44:18] the disciples were secure but they
[1:44:20] didn't feel secure
[1:44:22] because that wasn't the time for Jesus
[1:44:24] to be crucified he had to live
[1:44:27] and besides he said let's get in the
[1:44:29] boat and go to the other side so if he
[1:44:31] said let's get in the boat to go on the
[1:44:32] other side that boat's going to the
[1:44:34] other side
[1:44:35] they were secured by the word
[1:44:38] and although they were safe although
[1:44:41] they were secure everything in their
[1:44:44] senses told them they were not safe and
[1:44:46] they were not secure
[1:44:47] the waves coming over the ship the
[1:44:49] bailing that they were doing maybe the
[1:44:51] sale was torn maybe they were already
[1:44:53] weak and tired I mean it was black and
[1:44:55] they couldn't see anything everything
[1:44:56] declared to them that they were in
[1:44:58] trouble amen but the proof that they
[1:45:00] were not in trouble was in the boat
[1:45:04] listen sometimes it looks like we're in
[1:45:06] a whole heap of trouble
[1:45:07] it looks like everything's falling apart
[1:45:09] and I don't know how to put the pieces
[1:45:11] together but all you need to know is is
[1:45:13] he in the boat
[1:45:14] is he in the boat if he's in the boat
[1:45:16] then I'm just going to go wake Jesus
[1:45:19] where is he where do you find him he's
[1:45:22] in the boat with you he's in your boat
[1:45:24] amen
[1:45:25] and the storms rage he never said there
[1:45:27] wouldn't be storms but he said he would
[1:45:29] be with us
[1:45:30] all the way to the end of the world
[1:45:34] see now here's here's what he says I
[1:45:35] want to read read what the prophet says
[1:45:38] I want to see him manifested now how can
[1:45:40] you do it call him down no he's in you
[1:45:43] see he's in you well the Lord if I can
[1:45:45] get myself out of the way you can
[1:45:47] manifest
[1:45:49] how can you do it because he ordained it
[1:45:51] so
[1:45:54] amen sometimes
[1:45:57] God needs trials
[1:45:59] for manifestation
[1:46:03] so in order for God to prove himself a
[1:46:05] Healer in your life you need to be sick
[1:46:09] so the sickness was never to destroy you
[1:46:11] but to manifest Christ
[1:46:14] there's many things in life in order for
[1:46:17] there to be a manifestation there must
[1:46:19] be a difficult situation
[1:46:21] and Christ was manifesting himself all
[1:46:23] the time through difficult situations
[1:46:26] so was the prophet of God
[1:46:28] and so are you and I
[1:46:30] Christ will manifest himself through our
[1:46:33] difficult situations if we can just
[1:46:35] remember I have some promises
[1:46:38] he's promised to never leave me nor
[1:46:41] forsake me but to be with me to the end
[1:46:44] of the world
[1:46:45] he's promised to be my comforter he's
[1:46:47] promised to never forsake me
[1:46:50] and I believe him
[1:46:52] and then when we
[1:46:53] remind ourselves of the reality then
[1:46:56] faith
[1:46:57] takes charge
[1:46:58] and begins to master the circumstances
[1:47:02] I want to read
[1:47:03] one last quote musicians if you'll come
[1:47:05] Blake if you'll make your way up
[1:47:08] I'm going to read this quote out of the
[1:47:10] rising of the Sun
[1:47:12] it says we shall rise in him we become
[1:47:14] part of him the Easter the revealed
[1:47:16] Secret Of God like it was then of life
[1:47:18] after death we are now alive who were
[1:47:21] once dead in sin and trespasses
[1:47:23] the true Easter seal has broken death
[1:47:26] from around me and I'm alive
[1:47:28] the Easter seal at the beginning broke
[1:47:30] the Seal of the Roman seal the Easter
[1:47:32] seal that he was sealed up and man when
[1:47:35] they died was gone but he broke the seal
[1:47:37] and revealed the secret and now God by
[1:47:40] his holy spirit has broke the seal from
[1:47:42] around our lives and Christ is revealed
[1:47:45] as he lives in US
[1:47:47] for now we are quickened with him
[1:47:51] let's all stand
[1:47:55] the Holy Spirit has broke the seal from
[1:47:58] around our lives
[1:48:00] and now Christ is revealed as he lives
[1:48:04] in US
[1:48:05] amen where will I find him
[1:48:08] what city will I run to what altar will
[1:48:11] I bow out where will I find him he's
[1:48:14] promised to be with you
[1:48:16] he's promised to be in you
[1:48:18] he's promised to never forsake you I
[1:48:20] mean you can no more get away from him
[1:48:21] than David could get away from
[1:48:23] Dave said if I go here you're there if I
[1:48:25] go to heaven if I make my bed in hell if
[1:48:27] I fly to the ends of the Earth you're
[1:48:29] there I can never get away from you amen
[1:48:32] he's watching over us because he he is
[1:48:35] linked to us he's living in US amen he's
[1:48:37] wanting to live through us
[1:48:40] we can trust him where is where is he
[1:48:44] he's behind this Veil
[1:48:46] behind this Veil and he wants to live
[1:48:49] his life in this Veil
[1:48:52] let's bow our heads and pray Lord Jesus
[1:48:55] I thank you Father for your word
[1:48:59] God if we can see how you were in Moses
[1:49:03] see how you were in Paul and Peter
[1:49:07] Philip we saw what you did and delivered
[1:49:10] them and cared for them we see all that
[1:49:13] you've done Lord
[1:49:15] help us to recognize that we stand in
[1:49:18] the same position
[1:49:18] [Music]
[1:49:20] that we are a vessel a tabernacle that
[1:49:23] you want to live in and not just live in
[1:49:25] you want to manifest yourself through
[1:49:29] help us Lord to recognize that it's this
[1:49:31] body of Flesh
[1:49:33] Lord you could you could use the body of
[1:49:36] Peter you could use the body of Philip
[1:49:37] you could use the body of Paul so much
[1:49:40] so that they would take aprons and
[1:49:42] handkerchiefs from his body and people
[1:49:44] would have faith and be healed oh God if
[1:49:46] you could use them men you can use us
[1:49:50] before we release ourselves we just
[1:49:52] commit ourselves to you Lord and lay
[1:49:54] ourselves down at your feet we're asking
[1:49:56] you to take these vessels of clay and
[1:49:59] manifest yourself through
[1:50:01] forgive us Lord for all the worry and
[1:50:03] all the anxiety and all the fear God I
[1:50:07] pray that your word would begin to
[1:50:08] diminish those things that your word
[1:50:10] would take over and Conquer every
[1:50:12] circumstance Lord you're in the ship I
[1:50:14] pray that you would help us just to
[1:50:16] realize you're there and call upon you
[1:50:18] to wake you onto the scene
[1:50:21] oh there's anybody struggling with
[1:50:23] fearful circumstances I pray that you
[1:50:25] put Faith in their heart that the word
[1:50:27] would go and release their Faith Lord to
[1:50:30] overcome that circumstance
[1:50:32] they would realize Lord that you're
[1:50:34] working a work Lord and though we walk
[1:50:37] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:50:38] death we shall fear no evil for you are
[1:50:41] with us
[1:50:42] help these to be more than Sunday school
[1:50:44] verses we memorized or things we've
[1:50:47] heard but let them become living
[1:50:48] realities to us in this end time
[1:50:52] may we find you whereversoever we go may
[1:50:55] we know you're present with us
[1:50:57] in every circumstance may we recognize
[1:51:00] that you're here
[1:51:02] Lord I pray you would use these vessels
[1:51:04] of clay For Your Glory these physical
[1:51:07] bodies may they be the veil that you're
[1:51:10] working behind May the light shine forth
[1:51:12] and may others find their way to you
[1:51:14] through these Tabernacles
