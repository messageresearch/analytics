[0:00] Think about those three Hebrew men that
[0:02] were going into the fiery
[0:04] furnace. They already made the
[0:06] declaration, "Our God is more than able,
[0:08] but even if he doesn't, he's able to
[0:10] deliver us, but even if he doesn't,"
[0:12] they had no guarantee. They believed he
[0:14] would, but no guarantee that he
[0:17] would. They got one step closer, he says
[0:21] God wasn't there. Two steps, God wasn't
[0:24] there. three
[0:26] steps. What if they weren't determined
[0:28] to go all the
[0:29] way? What if they assumed, "Oh, I got an
[0:33] assumption here. God will deliver us
[0:34] when we get near the fire. God will not
[0:36] he'll certainly not let us go in that
[0:38] fire." And what if they had pulled the
[0:40] eject button somewhere along the way?
[0:42] When they felt the flames, Amen. when
[0:44] the guards started to suffer, they they
[0:45] aborted. Never mind. And I thought he
[0:48] would save me, but he didn't.
[0:50] They would have never known what a
[0:52] miraculous deliverance lay just
[0:55] ahead. Just that last the worst step,
[0:58] the worst condition, the impossible.
[1:01] When nothing can save us, when there's
[1:03] no turning back, when there's no hope,
[1:05] when all hope is gone, that's where he
[1:08] was. What if they didn't take the last
[1:11] step? They would have never come in
[1:13] contact with a living, breathing son of
[1:15] God in their midst to fan away the
[1:17] flames. They would have missed a
[1:18] miracle. They would have missed the
[1:20] sign. They would have missed the
[1:21] deliverance. They would have missed the
[1:22] turning of Nebuchadnezzar's heart. They
[1:24] would have missed the declaration that
[1:25] went all over the world that this is the
[1:27] true God.
[1:30] What happened when they were willing to
[1:32] go all the
[1:33] way? There's story after story after
[1:36] story in the Bible. Listen, you can't
[1:38] determine after you get started to go
[1:40] all the way. You've got to determine
[1:42] before you begin to go all the way.
[1:44] Amen. If it gets bad, if it goes from
[1:46] bad to worse, if it gets impossible. If
[1:48] it gets where there's no more hope, this
[1:50] is a hopeless situation. All hope is
[1:52] gone. Hey, you already determined I'm
[1:54] going all the way. And many times God
[1:57] lets it get the darkest and the worst
[1:59] and impossible to show his glory. Many
[2:02] times deliverance comes past where we
[2:05] thought deliverance would come.
[2:11] What if that widow decided not to knock
[2:13] the next day? I've knocked
[2:16] enough. I've tried for 20 days, for 15
[2:20] days. How many days I went knocking on
[2:22] the door asking for deliverance. She
[2:24] didn't know it was that time.
[2:27] Amen.
[2:31] That he was going to answer.
[2:35] How many times have we stopped just
[2:37] before? I don't know. But I'm determined
[2:40] not to stop again.
[2:43] Whatever it takes. Amen. Wherever he
[2:46] takes me, whatever he wants to do,
[2:47] wherever he wants to manifest, I want to
[2:49] be determined that he's going to have
[2:50] his way and I'm going to follow
[2:53] him. Hey, Peter was determined. I'm
[2:56] going all the way. But he didn't. He
[2:59] bailed out. He hit the eject button when
[3:00] it got too
[3:02] scary. I'll go to prison. I'll go to
[3:04] death. But when prison came, he
[3:08] bailed. He had to go die out to himself
[3:11] and be born again by the spirit of God.
[3:12] But with the spirit of God, he was able
[3:14] to go all the way. Amen. All the way to
[3:18] crucifixion, all the way to being hung
[3:21] upside down on a cross and giving his
[3:23] life. So, I want that same spirit to be
[3:26] in me to help me go all the way. And I
[3:29] want to yield to that spirit. I don't
[3:31] want to pull the eject button anymore. I
[3:33] know I'm not the only one who's pulled
[3:35] the eject button
[3:37] and tried to save
[3:38] myself. No more eject
[3:41] buttons. No more abort. Let's just go
[3:44] all the way and let God have his way and
[3:47] never stop and never quit. What we might
[3:51] just find is we might find the son of
[3:53] God, one like unto the son of God right
[3:57] in our midst, right in our camp, fanning
[3:59] the flaves away. Praise God.
