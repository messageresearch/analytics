[22:17] 50 next year in

[22:47] uh so I just appreciate all of you so
[22:50] much and love every one of you and it's
[22:53] this trip uh has been uh wonderful cuz
[22:56] I've just met so many wonderful saints
[22:58] of God I've been blessed constantly amen
[23:01] so I really appreciate that and uh so
[23:04] just thankful to brother Chad once again
[23:06] for the opportunity to be here and to
[23:09] share God's word with the bride of
[23:10] Christ and good to see every one of you
[23:13] good to meet every one of you just all
[23:16] the familiar faces and and uh we
[23:18] appreciate looking forward to some good
[23:20] Fellowship as well after the service is
[23:22] over amen so uh let's go to our
[23:27] Bibles and and
[23:30] uh so I want to speak on the seven
[23:33] sealed book
[23:35] amen and we're going to tie it into what
[23:38] we heard last night and so I'm not going
[23:42] to give you the no lightning and thunder
[23:45] is going to occur when I tell you what
[23:47] the theme is so it's not that great a
[23:51] mystery it's just going to link last
[23:53] night's service with this one so I don't
[23:56] want to I know it sound it a bit like a
[24:01] cliffhanger amen but let's go to
[24:04] Revelations 5 and verse
[24:07] 1 if by now you don't realize that the
[24:11] day we are living in is all about this
[24:15] there is nothing more exciting than to
[24:17] speak about this
[24:19] amen Revelations 5 and verse1 and we're
[24:22] going to go methodically through this
[24:25] chapter with a few verses and discuss
[24:28] this and enjoy it with all our heart
[24:31] amen Revelations 51 and I saw in the
[24:33] right hand of
[24:35] him that sat on the throne him singular
[24:40] sat on the throne singular a book
[24:44] written within and on the backside
[24:47] sealed with Seven Seals the Lord bless
[24:49] the reading of his word you may take
[24:51] your
[24:54] seat amen so in the revelation of Jesus
[24:58] Christ series The Prophet said that he
[25:01] wanted to spend seven nights breaking
[25:05] each seal in a series that was always
[25:07] his desire right and he said at that
[25:10] time if God permitted he wanted to set
[25:13] the stage for the opening of the seals
[25:16] and he did that from Revelations chter 5
[25:20] amen and many theologians of
[25:23] denominations that have studied This
[25:25] Book of Revelation have gotten it all
[25:29] wrong amen all of them have got it wrong
[25:33] many come close to the truth but still
[25:37] just do not get
[25:38] it it's amazing how that our simple
[25:41] people have apprehended
[25:43] this amen and also the way um that it is
[25:49] spoken right in the message the prophet
[25:52] brought us the truth as God wanted it to
[25:55] be brought God to the bride and and yet
[25:58] he spoke it in such Simplicity you'd ask
[26:01] the question why would God choose this
[26:04] man to bring it such
[26:07] Simplicity and that Simplicity is what
[26:10] makes it hard for anyone else to put it
[26:12] together amen and even harder for the
[26:14] intellectual mind also the way the Book
[26:18] of Revelation is written and the way the
[26:20] prophet speaks of it are
[26:23] similar it's all over the place right
[26:26] it's got so the Book of Revelation
[26:28] matches the way the prophet speaks right
[26:32] why is this book so hard for people to
[26:35] understand is it because God gave John
[26:37] such complex
[26:39] Visions is it because John wrote it all
[26:42] jumbled
[26:43] up right uh jumbled mixed up I believe
[26:49] that it is written as simple as possible
[26:52] because John wrote it as he understood
[26:54] it and the fact that modern people
[26:57] cannot understand it proves that it is
[27:00] us that have a
[27:02] problem this is very important is it
[27:05] sealed to them with seals that God put
[27:08] on the book or is it seals of our own
[27:12] making the book is called The Book of
[27:15] Revelations not the book of hiding away
[27:18] yes sir which means it was always God's
[27:21] desire to reveal who will name a book
[27:25] The Book of
[27:26] Revelations when he wants to hide things
[27:29] away right it was meant to reveal it was
[27:33] meant to make known not to hide things
[27:37] so why has it become hidden because man
[27:39] has become so much into his own thinking
[27:43] and so far from
[27:45] Gods amen so this has caused Ripple
[27:49] effects through the church circles
[27:51] making sure that only a minority will
[27:54] receive the
[27:56] Revelation and there are many mistakes
[27:58] we can make if we don't find out what
[28:01] the problem is so we want to find uh
[28:03] with the specific book The Book of
[28:05] Revelation what is the problem why is it
[28:08] if we can just sift out at least a few
[28:10] reasons right so if we start from the
[28:13] top let's have a look at it the reasons
[28:15] we read in error is interpreting a book
[28:19] written in symbol form as literal so
[28:23] that's the first thing this is the first
[28:24] thing the prophet punches through this
[28:26] is a book of symbols Revelations book of
[28:29] symbols and whenever you take a book of
[28:31] symbols and try to apply it literally
[28:34] well you're going to miss everything
[28:36] it'll make a good Hollywood movie though
[28:39] you know lots of creatures and demons
[28:41] and things flying around and and bangs
[28:45] and Thunders and explosions and uh 200
[28:49] million demons in the river Euphrates
[28:51] and wormwood can you imagine what these
[28:54] people can come up with if because they
[28:57] if they just take everything literally
[28:59] that's what they're going to come up
[29:00] with amen so if we only look at the
[29:03] symbols now for us okay enough mocking
[29:05] Hollywood but for us Brothers and
[29:08] Sisters of the bride of Christ if you're
[29:11] still taking things literally from The
[29:13] Book of Revelations you're just adding
[29:16] injury to yourself Amen in other words
[29:19] we must be able to translate the
[29:22] symbols into the
[29:24] manifestations now I know you're well
[29:26] taught I could just give you examples
[29:28] but that's going to take us too long so
[29:31] number two is thinking it's a book of
[29:34] Prophecy all of future events that's
[29:36] right I've heard some people who say
[29:39] there in the message saying that the
[29:41] entire Book of Revelations is in the
[29:43] future This Book of Revelations was
[29:46] written in the on the aisle of patmas by
[29:49] John at the beginning of the seven
[29:50] Church ages 2,000 years
[29:53] ago right how can it be a book of the
[29:57] future yeah there are many things in
[30:00] there that have already completed
[30:02] themselves it's finished there are some
[30:05] things happen in our recent past like
[30:08] the fifth and sixth trumpet World War I
[30:10] and World War II and then there are some
[30:12] things like World War 3 which is still
[30:14] on the verge of happening and there's
[30:17] other things that are in our future so
[30:19] we must be able to translate these
[30:21] symbols right and know it's not all for
[30:24] the future it's kind of like how people
[30:25] take the seven seal message preach 50
[30:28] years ago and still claim that the third
[30:30] fold is way off in the future and
[30:33] because brother bam couldn't talk about
[30:35] it we can't talk about it it's exactly
[30:37] the same am right amen The Book of
[30:40] Revelations is known as the book of
[30:43] Apocalypse the word revelations in the
[30:45] Greek is apocalypse which means
[30:48] unveiling it doesn't mean cataclysmic
[30:50] event that ends the world apocalypse
[30:53] means
[30:54] unveiling amen right right is very often
[30:58] we say oh my goodness it's going to be
[30:59] an apocalypse what do you
[31:01] mean apocalypse means
[31:05] unveiling prophecy means foretelling
[31:08] events that are still going to happen or
[31:11] for the future but this book of Prophecy
[31:14] was written 2,000 years ago is it still
[31:17] a book of Prophecy today some of the
[31:19] things are there right some things have
[31:22] actually come to pass so many Christians
[31:25] put all those prophecies into the future
[31:28] but we the bride of Christ must be able
[31:30] to accurately perfectly discern where
[31:34] things are where they stand what is in
[31:36] the past what is happening right now and
[31:38] what is in the future one strange thing
[31:41] is that many message people tend to see
[31:43] the events as if they happen all at once
[31:47] quickly right so they're expecting at
[31:50] the coming of the Lord everything in the
[31:51] Book of Revelation just going to happen
[31:53] like
[31:54] this and over uh you but it did
[31:58] it's they don't consider that it took a
[32:00] long space of time listen Revelations 2
[32:04] and 3 alone is a manifestation of 2,000
[32:08] years just those two
[32:10] chapters and that's only one mystery of
[32:14] the prophecy the church ages the church
[32:17] ages themselves manifest over 2,000
[32:22] years amen so here's the other problem
[32:26] thinking that The Book of Revelation is
[32:29] written in chronological order of
[32:33] events amen is this is many people
[32:36] thinking that well it's got to happen
[32:38] that way and then they take this quote
[32:40] of brother maram where he said the bride
[32:42] goes up in Revelations 3 and comes back
[32:43] in 19 and therefore everything that
[32:46] happens in between has got to do with
[32:47] the Jews nothing to do with us and they
[32:50] hold him to that statement forgetting he
[32:53] preached this whole message on
[32:55] Revelations 6 and Revelations 8 81
[32:58] called The Seven Seals Amen to us and
[33:03] tells us it's the
[33:05] bride right yes sir so you hold him to
[33:08] one quote but you're not taking the
[33:10] whole message of the Revelation Seven
[33:12] Seals right it proves they don't
[33:14] understand and as long as they keep that
[33:16] thinking they never see Revelations 10
[33:18] manifested that's right so if God opens
[33:21] your eyes you will see that some things
[33:24] are written in chronological order of
[33:26] events and others absolutely not now how
[33:29] can it be written in chronological order
[33:31] of events when the church ages alone are
[33:34] spoken of in chapters 2 and three but so
[33:37] many of the things the other Mysteries
[33:40] written in the other chapters are
[33:42] happening in the church
[33:45] ages right so if you just take that it's
[33:48] not written in chronological order of
[33:51] events it's written in order of
[33:55] understanding Amen in order of
[33:58] Revelation that means you could not
[34:01] understand the crisis of Revelations 5
[34:04] why there must be a book taken you
[34:06] couldn't understand the seven Thunders
[34:08] you couldn't know the vials unless you
[34:10] first see the church
[34:12] ages so he wants us to understand the
[34:15] church ages first first see the
[34:18] distribution of oil seven golden
[34:21] candlesticks first understand the seven
[34:24] Messengers first understand the spirits
[34:26] that's going to happen within in the
[34:27] church ages that's right order of
[34:31] understanding then go to the throne then
[34:34] go to the seals then go to the 144,000
[34:38] you wouldn't see that the 144,000 is
[34:41] Israel the elect of Israel if you didn't
[34:43] have the church ages first that's right
[34:46] this is why rord and ruford and the
[34:48] Jehovah's Witness and other peoples
[34:50] believe they're the 144,000 because they
[34:53] don't even recognize the church ages
[34:55] right so the book starts with John being
[34:58] in the spirit on the Lord's day when the
[35:02] vision broke you know we sing that song
[35:04] John was in the spirit on the Lord's day
[35:06] of course the Pentecost will say get in
[35:08] the
[35:10] spirit those words in the spirit on the
[35:13] Lord's Day means John was meditating on
[35:17] the second coming of the
[35:20] Lord the Lord's day is the second coming
[35:22] in other words think of all the things
[35:24] he he had heard Christ say and he their
[35:28] their thinking was remember the
[35:29] disciples question Lord what is the sign
[35:31] of the coming what is the sign of the
[35:32] end of the world you know what shall
[35:34] these what will these things be so he's
[35:37] locked up on the aisle of patmas and
[35:39] he's meditating on the things Christ
[35:40] spoke when is the coming of the Lord how
[35:43] is this going to happen how's this going
[35:44] to work out he's meditating on it he's
[35:48] that's what being in the spirit Spirit
[35:49] of Revelation he's in that is
[35:52] contemplating what what Christ had
[35:54] spoken what Peter had said what others
[35:56] were talking about when is this going to
[35:58] happen and because he was seeking it
[36:02] amen he was Desiring it he was
[36:04] meditating on it he was going back to
[36:06] the types and shadows in his mind he was
[36:08] looking at what the scriptures were
[36:10] saying and God brought the Revelation
[36:12] down get in the spirit on the Lord's day
[36:15] and you shall receive that's not have a
[36:19] Pentecostal uh time that's not the
[36:22] spirit amen that's right amen meditate
[36:26] on that seven seal meditate hate on the
[36:28] coming of the Lord and God shall
[36:30] reveal that is John in the pma's vision
[36:34] meditating and praying to receive
[36:36] understanding on things that the Lord
[36:38] Jesus had spoken concerning his coming
[36:40] and the end of the world and look at
[36:42] exactly what the Book of Revelation
[36:44] about God reveals the symbols of exactly
[36:48] the coming of the Lord and all the
[36:50] things that should come and lead to the
[36:52] end of all things amen that's exactly
[36:55] what God revealed look at that I mean
[36:57] Church ages Throne uh Revelation 6 the
[37:01] seals uh 144,000 the trumpets
[37:05] Revelations 10 the Thunders Revelations
[37:08] 11 the two witnesses uh and the Seven
[37:11] trumpet and Revelations 12 the The
[37:14] Mystery of the woman in travail and the
[37:17] and the dragon coming up to to take the
[37:19] the child the Manchild and uh
[37:22] Revelations 13 the two political spirits
[37:24] that would rule the Earth that would
[37:26] bring about the mark of the beast
[37:28] Revelations 14 The Reaping Revelations
[37:31] 15 those that stand upon the sea Victory
[37:34] Day uh Revelation 16 the vials and 17
[37:38] the revelation of the the that
[37:40] sits upon the Beast and and and and then
[37:43] the destruction over in 18 and 19
[37:45] speaking of the the bride making itself
[37:48] ready and the Armageddon and the
[37:50] revelation of he who sits in the White
[37:52] Horse Revelations 20 the Millennium and
[37:55] the Battle of Gog and MOG and the white
[37:57] tone judgment and 21 the holy city the
[38:00] New Jerusalem the symbols of who the
[38:02] bride is and 22 the closing of the book
[38:05] would think that just just meditating on
[38:08] the coming of the Lord would produce
[38:09] this entire chain this entire wonderful
[38:14] uh uh group of prophecies and
[38:17] understandings just given so the bride
[38:19] would understand nobody else would
[38:21] understand
[38:22] this oh if only Saints we could just
[38:25] meditate on that day of the Lord you
[38:29] shall receive glory to God the seven
[38:32] seal book is what we want to talk about
[38:35] amen so to begin the understanding of
[38:38] the seals we must first examine the book
[38:41] and its
[38:42] history did it ever strike you that the
[38:47] entire Bible we don't hear anything
[38:50] about a book in the hand of one who sits
[38:52] on the
[38:53] throne right you heard different things
[38:56] like in Ezekiel and and a scroll of book
[38:59] was brought to me by hand but you just
[39:02] don't there's no crisis from Genesis all
[39:05] the way through to Jude there's no
[39:07] crisis about a book we don't hear about
[39:09] these things suddenly in Revelations 5
[39:12] there's a
[39:13] crisis right and I saw in the right hand
[39:16] of him that sat on the throne a book
[39:17] written within and on the backside
[39:21] sealed with Seven Seals so for us to
[39:24] understand this book we must go into the
[39:26] history of it you must know what it
[39:28] means right so I recently had a a young
[39:32] person on the trip that I that i' just
[39:35] been on a young man said to me so what
[39:39] actually is the open book and I thought
[39:42] well I'm definitely going to have to
[39:44] preach this amen what exactly is the
[39:48] open book because I hear you ministers
[39:51] and a lot of you speaking about it you
[39:53] constantly saying it thank God for the
[39:54] open book we are we are we appreciate
[39:57] the open book we keeps what exactly is
[40:00] the open book is it just the Bible being
[40:03] revealed is it just us understanding
[40:05] things in the Bible what exactly is
[40:08] this that's a fantastic question amen
[40:12] and it requires a proper answer amen so
[40:16] first of we have to understand one
[40:18] crucial point when you read in this
[40:20] scripture and I saw in the right hand of
[40:22] him that sat on the throne a book
[40:25] written what do you see open your eyes
[40:29] now right Open the Eyes of our
[40:31] understanding one crucial point there is
[40:36] one sitting on the
[40:39] throne and only one can can you see
[40:44] it one is a
[40:47] very beautiful number very mysterious
[40:50] number when my dad was teaching me
[40:52] message maths he said 1 + 1+ 1 is 1
[41:00] and I thought
[41:01] wow I'm going to fail math in
[41:04] school 1+ 1+ 1 is
[41:07] one only one sits on the throne you
[41:12] agree you agree how about you yes sir
[41:15] right let's go to Revelations 4:
[41:19] 1-2 and after this I looked and behold a
[41:23] door was opened in heaven just follow on
[41:27] the screen we'll we can we can save time
[41:30] and the first voice which I heard was as
[41:32] it were of a trumpet talking with me
[41:35] which said come up hither and I will
[41:37] show thee things which must be Hereafter
[41:40] and immediately I was in the spirit amen
[41:44] and I be and behold a throne was set in
[41:46] heaven and
[41:49] one sat on the throne Amen in
[41:53] Revelations 51 we see three things one
[41:56] sitting on the throne two he has a book
[41:59] in his right hand three the book is
[42:02] written within and on the backside it's
[42:06] sealed with Seven
[42:07] Seals so to begin with who is the one
[42:11] sitting on the throne is it Christ is it
[42:14] the father is it the Holy
[42:16] Ghost right it's not even showing you
[42:19] any identification it's just telling you
[42:22] there's a throne and one sits on the
[42:25] throne there's there's nothing there's
[42:28] no I mean come on this guy is he's
[42:31] seeing a symbol couldn't he have seen a
[42:34] more definite couldn't he have said
[42:36] there's an old man with a beard couldn't
[42:39] his symbol you know indicate he looks
[42:42] like the father he looks like the
[42:44] Ancient of Days I mean we're waiting so
[42:46] long for this right and God gives him a
[42:49] revelation no nothing he doesn't even
[42:51] tell us what form he doesn't mention a
[42:53] gender he doesn't do anything like that
[42:55] he doesn't mention any other thing that
[42:58] gives any other kind of clue it just
[42:59] says one sat on the throne right and in
[43:04] his hand was a
[43:06] book so who is it right to understand
[43:10] this you then have to go to Revelations
[43:13] 2 and 3 which is the seven Church ages
[43:17] that's right why in there lies the true
[43:21] revelation of the godhead at the end of
[43:25] Revelations 3 we see
[43:28] this let's have a look Revelations 3:21
[43:31] so this is after the leian church age to
[43:36] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[43:39] with me in my throne even as I also
[43:43] overcame and am sat down with my father
[43:46] in his throne amen oh this can look
[43:51] quite confusing if you don't read with
[43:54] Revelation firstly is he saying there
[43:56] are Two Thrones now because now this
[43:59] scripture is saying it's as if I Jesus
[44:03] Christ have my Throne amen and the
[44:06] father has his throne so I overcame and
[44:09] I sat down with him in his throne uh and
[44:12] so if you overcome you will sit with me
[44:15] in my Throne I'll let you sit in my
[44:17] Throne as I am overcome and sit down in
[44:19] my father's Throne if you read without
[44:21] Revelation it looks like there's two
[44:23] seats here one here and one there right
[44:27] so if there if you say there are two
[44:30] Thrones it's as if well Christ was
[44:33] sitting there at the right hand of
[44:35] God right because they misunderstand
[44:38] what Steven saw and then so he overcame
[44:41] and sat down in in the father's Throne
[44:43] so Christ is in the father's throne and
[44:46] then uh you overcome you sit down in his
[44:48] throne so now there's Christ in the
[44:50] bride and the father is on
[44:54] vacation you see how silly that that is
[44:58] there is and if this is Revelations
[45:02] 321 the end of chapter 3 and we just
[45:04] Revelations 4 if you were thinking there
[45:07] were two Thrones Revelations 4 tells you
[45:09] there's one throne and one sits on the
[45:11] throne there's no two seats right if
[45:15] there is one Throne you might say well
[45:18] Jesus sat down in his father's Throne
[45:20] Revelations 3 so in Revelations 5 it was
[45:23] Jesus in The Throne holding the seven
[45:24] seal book
[45:27] amen but hold on if Jesus was sitting in
[45:30] the throne holding the seven seal book
[45:32] because he just said in Revelations 3
[45:34] that he overcame and sat down that means
[45:37] who is the Lamb that took it from Jesus
[45:39] who was already sitting on the throne
[45:41] with the book
[45:44] am
[45:46] oh now we're mixing the
[45:48] part therefore Revelations 5 is giving
[45:52] you the revelation of chapter 3: 21 when
[45:56] you read with Revelation you'll see that
[45:59] this is not again symbols not a physical
[46:04] literal happening in heaven of Jesus
[46:07] floating into the air going past the
[46:09] cloud and saying father I'm here to take
[46:12] the book now you you can have a vacation
[46:16] it's my turn now and then he comes in
[46:18] see I got to speak this way because I
[46:20] got to mock that thing that is exactly
[46:24] what the enemy wants from us to think
[46:26] like trinitarian
[46:27] and think like that in that way because
[46:29] it's preventing us from the truth and
[46:32] I'm going to tell the truth as it is
[46:35] amen not a physical literal happening
[46:38] where Jesus is coming another person in
[46:41] Trinity taking it from the Father the
[46:43] first one in the Trinity and then him
[46:45] sitting down if you see it that way
[46:48] you've got no right to criticize
[46:50] trinitarians that's right because either
[46:53] you are a trinitarian or a tunist or
[46:56] something amen yes the throne is a
[46:59] symbol that represents authority of the
[47:03] word am that's it amen amen the father's
[47:08] authority of the word ran through the
[47:11] church uh ran through the dispensation
[47:13] of the Father the invisible God who is
[47:15] above the people who could not be seen
[47:17] who could not be touched who work
[47:19] through the prophets and the Kings and
[47:20] the priesthood from Adam all the way up
[47:22] to Christ the dispensation of the father
[47:25] glory to God one with revelation will
[47:28] understand that the Throne of God
[47:30] described in four and five chapters 4
[47:32] and 5 is a symbolic Vision that
[47:34] represents the authority of the word
[47:37] amen that represents the place where God
[47:41] dwells changing now from one
[47:43] manifestation to the next God expressed
[47:47] in an attribute called the father was
[47:50] the supreme authority of the word as
[47:52] long as he was invisible and above the
[47:54] people but Emmanuel ch against that not
[47:58] God above anymore but God With Us and
[48:01] Emmanuel was manifested in flesh became
[48:04] the Son of God that we could see that we
[48:06] could touch glory to God God expressed
[48:10] in the attribut of father was supreme
[48:12] authority of the word amen from the
[48:14] beginning of time until the word was
[48:16] made flesh and was crucified before that
[48:20] the rulership was in the name the
[48:23] relationship of Jehovah or Elohim but
[48:26] when the word was made flesh it
[48:31] changed Christ said no man cometh to the
[48:34] father but by me when he was crucified
[48:37] and resurrected listen the throne
[48:40] changed he said all judgment is given to
[48:44] the son what does that mean God himself
[48:48] and Moray changing himself one throne
[48:52] but now his manifestation is no longer
[48:55] father it is son amen amen that's what's
[48:59] happening still one Throne still one who
[49:02] sits in the throne amen just changing
[49:06] manifestation this is the great mystery
[49:09] the symbols of Revelations 5 is actually
[49:12] showing us so when it says sit with me
[49:16] is not sharing the
[49:20] throne oh now we getting there see let's
[49:24] tell the truth amen let's not try to be
[49:27] safe Jesus was not sharing the
[49:30] throne with the Father the father became
[49:35] the
[49:37] son that's what it is if the son took
[49:40] the book if he was taking them the
[49:42] father became the son glory to God God
[49:46] changing his form his throne
[49:50] moving glory to God what is this man
[49:53] becoming equal co-equal with God in in
[49:57] authority of the word in rulership of
[50:00] the world in rulership over all
[50:02] Dimensions do you believe that amen this
[50:05] was God becoming Christ and Christ
[50:07] becoming God there's more you know
[50:10] that's what brother m'am said God
[50:12] becoming man man becoming God there's
[50:15] more to that understanding for an
[50:17] entirely different teaching all right so
[50:20] what is the book now there's many
[50:23] pictures on the internet and uh all
[50:25] kinds of pictures
[50:27] I don't like pictures when it comes to
[50:29] the Book of Revelations so this is just
[50:32] a a a a
[50:35] pictorial uh expression of the symbol
[50:39] okay I don't believe there are literal
[50:41] books of paper in
[50:43] heaven God has
[50:45] no
[50:47] Forest to mash wood and make paper and a
[50:51] God who is omnipotent does not need
[50:54] books to remember stuff amen
[50:57] he does not need a secretary with files
[51:00] and files and libraries of cabinets and
[51:03] and articles and and files for him to
[51:05] remember like when he says and God
[51:07] remembered Noah it doesn't mean he
[51:10] forgot
[51:13] Noah it means he kept his Covenant when
[51:17] it says God remembered it means he kept
[51:19] his
[51:21] Covenant so this book all I want to show
[51:26] you is the symbol a
[51:29] scroll locked with Seven Seals okay
[51:33] nothing else I don't I I don't even want
[51:35] to say that there is a better drawing
[51:37] than this or I can make a better drawing
[51:39] I just want to show you a book sealed
[51:41] with Seven Seals what do we need to
[51:43] understand this book is locked
[51:46] up amen and it needs to be open right so
[51:51] how about this book then this book is
[51:53] written within in other words there's
[51:55] writing in inside the writing on the
[51:58] inside is not locked up it's the whole
[52:02] book is just sealed shut it's closed
[52:06] right and on this the back side of this
[52:09] book there are seven seals Seven Locks
[52:12] or seven
[52:13] preventions from opening the book yeah
[52:16] those Mysteries those seals are a
[52:19] mystery because we cannot identify what
[52:22] they are back then we didn't we were not
[52:25] able no man was able to identify what
[52:28] was locking up this book are you agree
[52:31] it's a symbol yes am what so what does
[52:34] the book
[52:35] symbolize what does it symbolize what
[52:38] what is inside the book what is this
[52:40] book symbolizing fine we're talking
[52:42] about this open book we know what the
[52:44] seals are we now know what the White
[52:46] Horse wrer but after all the seals are
[52:48] open and you've now got the book well
[52:50] what is
[52:53] it this book is so mysterious because
[52:56] nobody had ever seen or heard it about
[52:59] it since Genesis or that there was some
[53:02] kind of sudden urgency that all mankind
[53:05] would be lost if John or or somebody
[53:07] didn't take this book suddenly there's
[53:10] this this is like a trap like all of a
[53:13] sudden there's this crisis about this
[53:15] book and if no man takes the book All Is
[53:17] Lost that's right and we've never heard
[53:20] about this Moses never talked about it
[53:22] Joshua never talked about it Daniel had
[53:26] something there but we never heard Seven
[53:28] Seals in Daniel and we saw Ezekiel but
[53:32] there was no Seven Seals in there now
[53:34] suddenly like there's a trap here for us
[53:37] and we're in a bad place because if the
[53:40] Seven Seals are not broken and the book
[53:42] is not given all mankind is lost this is
[53:45] so
[53:46] unfair nobody told us about this let's
[53:50] go to is this the sign of the end
[53:53] sir notice Revelations 5:1 listen at
[53:56] this now and I saw in the right hand of
[53:58] him that sat uh that sat upon the throne
[54:01] a book written within the writing was
[54:04] with inside and on the backside sealed
[54:08] with Seven Seals I'm just showing you
[54:09] what the prophet says right there's
[54:11] writing on the inside of the book but
[54:13] the backside had seven seals on the book
[54:15] of it that wasn't written in the book
[54:17] now this is the revelat now I know
[54:19] you're possibly to preached on this I
[54:21] don't want to get into all of that I
[54:23] just want to point out the symbol
[54:25] there's writing in the inside uh and on
[54:28] the backside had seals Seven Seals on
[54:31] the back of it that wasn't written in
[54:32] the book now this is the Revelator
[54:34] talking John now remember it wasn't
[54:37] written in the book so everyone's got
[54:39] the
[54:40] symbol I don't like to do this but I'm
[54:42] doing it now imagine a
[54:45] scroll there's writing inside and
[54:49] there's these locks around it amen and
[54:52] you can't read the writing unless you
[54:54] break away the locks that's a very
[54:57] simple symbol right and he's saying here
[55:00] that the revelation of what the seals
[55:02] are are not written in the book that in
[55:06] itself needs some understanding so how
[55:08] can he say that when the symbols of the
[55:11] seals are written in Revelation
[55:13] 6 and Revelations 81 what so what does
[55:17] he mean by it's not written in the book
[55:20] right and yet it's written in the Bible
[55:23] yeah what he meant was the real real ity
[55:26] of those seals was a mystery that was
[55:29] holding the book
[55:31] bound those those spirits of those seals
[55:34] were going to manifest over the ages and
[55:36] were going to literally bind something
[55:39] over the ages of Christianity making it
[55:42] that the end time impossible for
[55:44] Christians to even know remotely what is
[55:48] God that's how bad it is
[55:52] amen he meant the reality of those seals
[55:55] became IM Myster and they wouldn't know
[55:57] it because the reality of what the white
[56:00] horse rider was was not written in the
[56:02] book yeah right the reality of the what
[56:05] the red horse rider turned out to be
[56:06] Church joining State not written in the
[56:09] book right black horse rider payos not
[56:13] written in but the symbols
[56:15] were right so we need to know the actual
[56:18] thing that's binding the book what is it
[56:21] firstly what is the book what's binding
[56:25] the book amen I know some of you
[56:27] thinking how does this apply to what
[56:29] what we heard last
[56:31] night we're going to get there am so
[56:34] next question I want to go through this
[56:35] slowly listen I know all the quotes
[56:37] we're going to read you've read be
[56:39] everything you've read before I know you
[56:41] know it every single message believer on
[56:44] Earth has read these things right is I'm
[56:47] not giving you anything you haven't
[56:49] heard of or you haven't seen what I'm
[56:51] just doing is putting it in a little bit
[56:53] of an order so we follow a thought amen
[56:56] right and hopefully by the end we can
[56:57] enjoy some fellowship together you love
[57:00] him Saints am okay is the book The Bible
[57:04] right let's answer that question and by
[57:07] that uh brother M says in earnestly
[57:10] contending for the faith this is
[57:11] preached 1953 we can lay down the lids
[57:15] of his Bible we can open up the lid the
[57:17] Bible Lids but we cannot open up the
[57:19] Bible that's right
[57:26] there's only one can do that that's
[57:28] right that's Christ the Bible is in the
[57:31] hand of
[57:34] God
[57:36] Amen the Bible is in the hand of God is
[57:39] there some special Bible in
[57:42] heaven English
[57:46] Bible see let's put all that out of our
[57:49] head the Bible is in the hand of God on
[57:52] the throne and there was no man in
[57:55] Heavens nor man in earth or man beneath
[57:57] the Earth worthy to take the Bible am to
[58:01] open it or to loose the Seven Seals that
[58:03] was sealed on the backside of it and
[58:04] John began to weep and one of the elders
[58:06] said weep not for the lamb that was
[58:08] slain before the foundation of the world
[58:09] was worthy and able to come and take the
[58:11] book out of the right hand of him that
[58:13] sat upon the throne and to open it and
[58:15] loose the seals thereof and that's the
[58:17] Lamb of God that was slain before the
[58:18] foundation of the world and the Lord
[58:20] Jesus Christ now here it is may he come
[58:23] this afternoon and open our
[58:27] standing may he take the things that's
[58:30] written in this book and give them out
[58:32] to the people just as they have need of
[58:35] it so though I have the Bible in my hand
[58:39] the understanding of something about it
[58:42] yeah even if you say the understanding
[58:45] you and I can read this Bible we can
[58:46] read the words and yet not understand we
[58:50] can understand it in our own way we can
[58:53] understand it in someone else's way yeah
[58:56] yes but the understanding that is
[59:01] required that's what we want so is it
[59:05] really the Bible I mean the English
[59:07] Bible is that really it English is not
[59:10] even a Heavenly tongue yeah or a
[59:12] seven-dimensional form of communication
[59:15] I don't know neither is Hebrew and a
[59:18] Heavenly it's an Earthly tongue it's an
[59:20] Earthly language there isn't a single uh
[59:23] Earthly language that that that should
[59:26] be a Heavenly dimensional language CU
[59:30] they were all created here on Earth
[59:32] right furthermore this Bible this
[59:35] English Bible or this Bible that was in
[59:37] the hands of God apparently no man was
[59:40] worthy to even look on it that's
[59:47] right men have been looking on on this
[59:49] thing for a long time it's in Gideon
[59:52] Bible on every filthy Hotel yeah and
[59:56] mtel all over the world and men are
[1:00:00] looking on it touching it oh my goodness
[1:00:03] terrible things done with it yeah it's
[1:00:06] definitely not that yeah amen no man was
[1:00:09] worthy to look upon it to open
[1:00:12] it furthermore the prophet says that
[1:00:15] this book was in the hands of Adam
[1:00:18] before English came about before French
[1:00:21] or Hebrew or anything this book was in
[1:00:24] the hands of Adam
[1:00:26] and he lost it he sold out his
[1:00:29] inheritance to Satan and the book went
[1:00:31] back to the hands of the original owner
[1:00:34] right if the book was in the hands of
[1:00:36] Adam it means it's definitely not the
[1:00:39] book that you bring to church every day
[1:00:43] absolutely not the Book of Revelations 5
[1:00:45] is the secret of all
[1:00:48] secrets yes it's far greater than secret
[1:00:51] number 11 which is the ingredients of
[1:00:53] KFC
[1:00:57] it's the secret of all
[1:00:59] secrets amen the symbol of the mystery
[1:01:03] of God Amen that's right that's what the
[1:01:07] book
[1:01:08] is who God is that's right what it means
[1:01:13] to be God it is the symbol for the
[1:01:16] intimate knowledge of the person of God
[1:01:19] Amen it is a symbol of the revelation of
[1:01:21] the mind of God
[1:01:23] am what is revelation 5 telling us if
[1:01:27] man does not take the revelation of the
[1:01:30] mystery of God All Is Lost amen if man
[1:01:34] does not take the intimate knowledge of
[1:01:36] the person of God All Is Lost amen if
[1:01:40] man does not receive the revelation of
[1:01:42] the mind of God All Is Lost the Bible is
[1:01:45] the written word expression of that
[1:01:50] symbol what it is amen is one thing and
[1:01:56] it means everything to us amen all right
[1:02:01] what is it then if you have this book of
[1:02:04] Revelations 5 you have the power to rule
[1:02:08] the
[1:02:09] Earth you have you receive back
[1:02:11] everything Adam lost once that book is
[1:02:14] delivered to you once you whoever holds
[1:02:17] the book
[1:02:19] rules amen we know that God wrote three
[1:02:22] Bibles the prophet tells us the stars in
[1:02:25] the universe the pyramids in
[1:02:27] measurements and The Holy Bible which is
[1:02:29] written in the many different actual
[1:02:31] languages of men on Earth in other words
[1:02:34] God expressed the revelation of God of
[1:02:39] being
[1:02:41] God in all kinds of manifestations
[1:02:44] that's right the Stars the pyramids the
[1:02:48] English Bible the written Bibles you
[1:02:50] agree right so the the books of the
[1:02:53] Bible were written in Chalan in Hebrew
[1:02:57] in Aramaic in coin Greek so the English
[1:03:01] Bible as we know it is just actually the
[1:03:04] last
[1:03:06] expression of the actual thing the
[1:03:09] English Bible is actually the lowest
[1:03:13] expression amen and there are many
[1:03:16] things to it but simply it
[1:03:19] symbolizes the revelation of who God is
[1:03:22] in the present day what is the Book of
[1:03:24] Revelations 5 it is the mystery of being
[1:03:27] God
[1:03:29] Amen a reation
[1:03:31] Jes what is the mystery of God remember
[1:03:35] Revelations 10 the mystery of God should
[1:03:36] be
[1:03:37] finished what does that mean the
[1:03:40] greatest questions that man has today
[1:03:44] number one ask any people in the world
[1:03:47] even the atheist they arguing they are
[1:03:50] atheists because someone you you can't
[1:03:52] get an atheist unless there was someone
[1:03:54] who believed in God yeah that only
[1:03:56] occurs because the belief in God came
[1:03:59] first atheist didn't come
[1:04:01] first so does God exist that question
[1:04:05] does God exist and the second question
[1:04:07] who is God if he does exist that's a
[1:04:10] question in every man's mind right is
[1:04:14] knowing God's name knowing the mystery
[1:04:16] of God that's what the Jehovah's Witness
[1:04:19] say that's what the Jewish people
[1:04:22] believe knowing God's name Yahweh I am
[1:04:27] uh the
[1:04:28] tetragramaton the uh what other every
[1:04:31] other name they they've got people
[1:04:33] fighting about Jehovah and Lord and uh
[1:04:37] uh Elohim and and uh um what are they
[1:04:42] they call him all sorts of different
[1:04:44] Hebrew names and now you find Christian
[1:04:46] churches things kind of fizzled out for
[1:04:48] them and even Jesus got boring so now
[1:04:51] the songs are all Yahweh Yahweh Yahweh
[1:04:54] right have you seen that happen
[1:04:56] and all different kinds of of names of
[1:04:59] God it's like they feel like if they
[1:05:02] know this name well then they get to
[1:05:04] know God once again fooling
[1:05:06] themselves knowing God's name God
[1:05:10] doesn't need a name like alisto or Chad
[1:05:13] what does that even
[1:05:15] mean every name of God was defining a
[1:05:19] relationship of God to
[1:05:21] man it's not a name you how can you even
[1:05:24] limit God to a name a name sort of
[1:05:27] defines some finite thing even the
[1:05:32] attribute father had a time limit on it
[1:05:35] because a father is producing sons and
[1:05:37] and giving purpose right and then son
[1:05:40] had a time limit on it because there was
[1:05:42] still the Holy Ghost to come and then
[1:05:43] son comes and then there's still bride
[1:05:46] amen and they're all relationships to
[1:05:49] god Jehovah meaning God dwelling with
[1:05:52] his people Jehovah Gyra uh the Lord will
[1:05:56] provide Jehovah Rafa the Lord who heals
[1:05:59] amen El Roy
[1:06:01] elai uh so many of the different names
[1:06:05] that are there in the Old Testament the
[1:06:07] strong and mighty tower The Refuge The
[1:06:09] Shield the buckler they're all
[1:06:11] relationships to man a name is simply
[1:06:15] God's relationship you can know those
[1:06:17] names in the letter or even try to
[1:06:20] understand it and you still don't know
[1:06:21] God amen amen
[1:06:25] if if we even have to have a a
[1:06:28] discussion about what God means do you
[1:06:31] know what's all the big problem when you
[1:06:33] get people fighting against the
[1:06:35] revelation of the open book yes sir they
[1:06:38] literally don't know what it means to be
[1:06:41] God they have a problem with that think
[1:06:44] of it if you have a problem with what it
[1:06:46] means to be God you will resist the open
[1:06:50] book because we have an idea everyone
[1:06:53] thinks God is an idol meaning we must
[1:06:56] bow down to him we must worship him we
[1:06:58] must say good things about him because
[1:07:00] if we do then he'll bless us oh my
[1:07:03] goodness what an immature understanding
[1:07:06] of God Amen you do we really believe
[1:07:10] that when we say God loves the Praises
[1:07:11] of his people is he sitting there and
[1:07:13] say yeah give me more come on you can do
[1:07:17] better more words amen more lovely
[1:07:20] English words better vocabulary come on
[1:07:23] I love it
[1:07:26] do we really think he's this like this
[1:07:28] Earthly Kings who like write some pages
[1:07:32] about me write more books extol my name
[1:07:36] bow down worship is that our vision of
[1:07:40] God and when when we speak about what it
[1:07:42] means to be God they will say
[1:07:46] blasphemy you are making yourself Above
[1:07:49] This you are making yourself God that's
[1:07:51] a problem CU they don't understand what
[1:07:54] God means
[1:07:57] so do that mean when Adam lost the book
[1:08:00] and he lost the right to the mystery of
[1:08:02] God does it mean Adam forgot what name
[1:08:05] God
[1:08:06] had what does it mean then he he if if
[1:08:09] the book is about the mystery of God and
[1:08:11] Adam forfeit it what did he
[1:08:14] forfeit the knowledge of who God was
[1:08:17] like oh he had sudden Amnesia he forgot
[1:08:20] who his father was he didn't know who
[1:08:23] created him man just suddenly lost
[1:08:25] everything every knowledge of God
[1:08:29] suddenly do you hear see this is why I'm
[1:08:31] saying we got to preach this way the
[1:08:33] only way to challenge your thoughts and
[1:08:36] put the reality in is to mock the
[1:08:38] previous belief is to show you how
[1:08:40] ridiculous and silly it was yes amen
[1:08:45] absolutely not Adam did not forget the
[1:08:47] name of God and suddenly uh Yahweh
[1:08:51] became a mystery that could not be
[1:08:52] pronounced or could not be spoken or
[1:08:55] hidden and there's some anagram and
[1:08:56] there's some kind of cryptic and stone
[1:08:59] and tablets and oh my goodness that's
[1:09:01] some Egyptian adventure program or
[1:09:03] something that's not what God
[1:09:07] is there's no more to it than that
[1:09:09] people believe that man who has the true
[1:09:13] answer to all these questions that any
[1:09:16] man who has the answer to these
[1:09:18] questions who is God what is God what is
[1:09:21] his name people think if we can just
[1:09:23] know those things well we have the
[1:09:26] answer to
[1:09:27] life you know the Lord Jesus said even
[1:09:29] if I tell you you won't believe
[1:09:32] me so if let's say there was some
[1:09:35] denomination uh who came out with this
[1:09:38] revelation of what God's secret name is
[1:09:42] what good is it going to do for
[1:09:44] them what what are you going to do with
[1:09:46] it how is it going to help
[1:09:49] you right and but they believe it
[1:09:52] Pentecostals believe oh when that new
[1:09:54] name is
[1:09:56] revealed they've got no idea what that
[1:09:59] is that's the secret name and and the
[1:10:02] Mysteries spoken of some people in the
[1:10:04] message to hear what brother baram says
[1:10:06] and they think man that name one day is
[1:10:08] going to flash in the skies and the
[1:10:10] clouds and lightning is going to open it
[1:10:12] up and when we see and then reveal that
[1:10:14] new name there's just going to be
[1:10:18] power the answer to that question of the
[1:10:21] mystery of God is not given to the mind
[1:10:26] it's not even conceived in the mind it
[1:10:29] is believed in the
[1:10:31] soul the soul was corrupted by unbelief
[1:10:34] once therefore it lost the answer to the
[1:10:37] mystery of God holding the mystery bound
[1:10:41] are Seven
[1:10:42] Seals that means the soul of man is
[1:10:45] never going to conceive that mystery of
[1:10:48] God again unless those seven seals are
[1:10:50] broken that's why all was lost if the
[1:10:53] seals were not or the book was not taken
[1:10:55] and the seals not loosed are you with me
[1:10:58] so now we can understand why there was a
[1:11:00] crisis in Revelations 5 why at the end
[1:11:04] because here coming to the end time man
[1:11:06] had gotten so far from God they
[1:11:09] literally used the revelation of Jesus
[1:11:11] Christ to trap people yeah to enslave
[1:11:16] people amen amen it's not a literal book
[1:11:20] it is the symbol of the all powerful
[1:11:23] Almighty revelation of Revelation
[1:11:25] the mystery of God God's Great Plan of
[1:11:28] Redemption for man and if we don't see
[1:11:30] it there is no hope for
[1:11:34] mankind amen that's the crisis listen
[1:11:38] let's make it this understanding a
[1:11:40] little bit more before we get to the
[1:11:41] secret of
[1:11:43] it if you don't take the
[1:11:45] book there are no
[1:11:48] souls saved at the white Throne judgment
[1:11:51] right that's right
[1:11:53] amen true we are not just here to have a
[1:11:56] good time in the presence of the
[1:11:58] Lord there are going to be Souls who are
[1:12:01] going to be granted Mercy at the white
[1:12:04] Throne judgment because you took the
[1:12:08] book we have a bigger responsibility
[1:12:11] than just having a church singing some
[1:12:13] songs and listening to sermons there's a
[1:12:15] actual judgment coming where people's
[1:12:18] souls are going to be granted Mercy
[1:12:21] because the bride of Christ prevailed
[1:12:23] amen am sin took away what being God
[1:12:29] means and made it the greatest mystery
[1:12:32] in the world when I look out there it's
[1:12:35] so sad yes when I walk in I just choke
[1:12:38] up sometimes walking through airports
[1:12:41] and watching all these Souls Pass Me By
[1:12:43] I get this feeling in the back of my
[1:12:45] spine like Lord what am I doing here
[1:12:48] what is going on look at this they're so
[1:12:51] unconscious of you and and I'm walking
[1:12:54] through this place and my mind is
[1:12:55] constantly conscious of you I'm thanking
[1:12:58] you for having arrived I'm thanking you
[1:13:00] for where I'm going I'm speaking with
[1:13:02] you in my mind where where and yet
[1:13:04] there's just people worried about what
[1:13:06] Bagel to have
[1:13:07] next you know or which flight and or
[1:13:11] what they're going to do when they get
[1:13:12] there there's just no uh uh uh
[1:13:17] conscience of God in man's mind anymore
[1:13:20] he's so far
[1:13:23] gone let's go to um paragraph
[1:13:27] 294 the word comes the book that is
[1:13:29] written within is then completed when
[1:13:31] this all these Mysteries have finished
[1:13:33] to be sounded now let me read it again
[1:13:36] so you'll be sure now uh in the days of
[1:13:39] the voice of the seventh angel the last
[1:13:42] Angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:13:44] mystery of God should be finished you
[1:13:50] agree finished the mystery of God should
[1:13:53] be finished when the Lost Angel is
[1:13:57] sounded amen which means everything that
[1:14:00] needed to be manifested has been
[1:14:03] manifested amen now it's ready to be
[1:14:05] revealed because immediately after that
[1:14:08] someone says go take the book yeah amen
[1:14:11] it's complete whatever was supposed to
[1:14:14] be manifested in time of the mystery of
[1:14:17] God is complete in the days of the
[1:14:19] seventh messenger amen and then the
[1:14:21] command of voice from Heaven says go
[1:14:23] take the book amen never before amen so
[1:14:27] the mystery of God is
[1:14:31] complete 295 now what is the mystery of
[1:14:35] God one of them Paul said in 1 Timothy 3
[1:14:39] I believe it was said without great or
[1:14:42] controversy or controversy whichever way
[1:14:44] you pronounce it here great is the
[1:14:46] mystery of godliness for God was
[1:14:49] manifest In the Flesh we handled him now
[1:14:53] we love this because oh that was Jesus
[1:14:56] Christ God right received up in glory
[1:15:01] witnessed By Angels Vindicated here on
[1:15:03] Earth God was sure it's a great mystery
[1:15:08] but it's all solved not father son Holy
[1:15:11] Ghost three Gods but one God in three
[1:15:13] offices now he's explaining the
[1:15:16] fatherhood under Moses the sunship under
[1:15:20] Christ the Holy Ghost under the dis this
[1:15:23] dispensation three dispensations of the
[1:15:26] same God not three Gods three different
[1:15:31] officers three so you understand why it
[1:15:33] says the mystery of God is finished amen
[1:15:37] because the the manifestations that
[1:15:39] should reveal God in a relationship of
[1:15:44] father son Holy Spirit has been complete
[1:15:47] am it's done its work all the Mysteries
[1:15:51] that had to reveal father was done all
[1:15:54] the Mysteries that had to reveal son in
[1:15:56] time was done all the Mysteries That was
[1:15:59] supposed to reveal Holy Ghost was
[1:16:02] done the mystery is finished now amen
[1:16:06] you love him Saints amen the mystery was
[1:16:08] finished in manifestation but yet man
[1:16:11] did not possess the
[1:16:14] Revelation the mystery of God had
[1:16:16] nothing to do with the
[1:16:18] name uh any singular written name of God
[1:16:25] or what his name is it had to do with
[1:16:29] his relationship to
[1:16:32] man that's it that's the
[1:16:35] mystery right what is Father what is
[1:16:38] Father what does Father mean to us right
[1:16:41] the dispensation of the father had two
[1:16:44] ages the age of conscience and the age
[1:16:46] of law the father was invisible he was
[1:16:50] above them he could not be touched he
[1:16:51] could not be seen you would die he gave
[1:16:54] them law in the beginning they they
[1:16:56] served him by conscience having no
[1:16:58] church no opening prayer no closing in
[1:16:59] prayer no Bible no scripture No audios
[1:17:03] no Gatherings no Traditions just
[1:17:05] conscience for 2,000 years and then the
[1:17:08] law came in because of transgression and
[1:17:10] it came with Thou shalt not kill Thou
[1:17:11] shalt not steal Thou shalt not this he
[1:17:14] started dealing with them as teenagers
[1:17:17] right right they're immature man is
[1:17:20] immature because man lost the right amen
[1:17:23] he lost the book
[1:17:25] yeah and so he the father dispensation
[1:17:28] is God dealing with children amen but
[1:17:32] when the son he came to bring forth many
[1:17:34] Brethren like unto himself it was
[1:17:37] Fellowship it was Brethren it was
[1:17:39] Emmanuel it was God with us and then the
[1:17:42] son came for a season and left and the
[1:17:44] Holy Ghost comes in which is God upon us
[1:17:48] God anointing us God giving us gifts and
[1:17:51] abilities like the son I pray the father
[1:17:55] he will send the Holy Ghost In My
[1:18:00] Name What's that the spirit of God will
[1:18:04] send you an anointing that will give you
[1:18:06] the gifts of the son of
[1:18:09] man when you break that down that's what
[1:18:11] it actually means right so the mystery
[1:18:14] of God and always has been here it is
[1:18:17] are you ready for it the mystery of
[1:18:21] God is and always has been
[1:18:25] about
[1:18:29] man from the
[1:18:31] beginning it's been about
[1:18:36] man why use the symbol of a
[1:18:38] book so because we understand books
[1:18:42] books happen in our realm of life
[1:18:45] because a book contains words and words
[1:18:48] give meaning words can be read words can
[1:18:52] be understood words can be believed
[1:18:54] that's why the symbol of a book is used
[1:18:57] so God because God reveals himself by
[1:19:00] his word he's using the symbol of a book
[1:19:04] why is this book then
[1:19:06] sealed amen let's read are you still
[1:19:10] with us amen verse 2 to 4 of Revelations
[1:19:13] 5 and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:19:16] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[1:19:20] the book and loose the seals thereof and
[1:19:22] no man
[1:19:25] yes amen no man in Heaven Nor in Earth
[1:19:29] neither under the Earth was able to open
[1:19:31] the book neither to look there this book
[1:19:34] is
[1:19:35] required by
[1:19:38] man to be
[1:19:40] open come on God can open anything if
[1:19:44] it's the father why could he open it if
[1:19:48] it's the spirit the great Eternal being
[1:19:50] the self-existing one what's the deal
[1:19:52] with man and this book
[1:19:57] because it's always been about
[1:20:00] man and no man in heaven and verse four
[1:20:03] and I wept much again because no man was
[1:20:07] found worthy to open and to read the
[1:20:09] book neither to look thereon so as long
[1:20:12] as this book remains sealed no man would
[1:20:16] know God no man would understand God no
[1:20:20] man would perceive what God is no man
[1:20:22] would would have any result resemblance
[1:20:25] or understanding of what it means and
[1:20:27] would believe in other words if the book
[1:20:30] is not in the hands of man we are always
[1:20:33] guessing we're always presuming we're
[1:20:36] always getting it wrong every religion
[1:20:39] is so far from the truth it's as if
[1:20:41] North Pole and South Pole yeah right now
[1:20:45] today Christianity is as far away from
[1:20:48] the understanding of God as North is
[1:20:50] from
[1:20:52] South it was an emergency that the book
[1:20:55] comes back into the hands of man or else
[1:20:58] everything on Earth was lost all right
[1:21:00] so it seems that this book is meant for
[1:21:03] man you
[1:21:04] agree you love him Saints you enjoy his
[1:21:07] word amen paragraph 25 the fourth seal
[1:21:10] and then no one in Heaven Nor in Earth
[1:21:13] or beneath the Earth was was worthy to
[1:21:15] open it or even to look upon it you know
[1:21:17] that means if it's saying that no one in
[1:21:19] heaven that's sixth Dimension no
[1:21:23] man sixth Dimension no man under the
[1:21:26] Earth beneath the Earth That's The Fifth
[1:21:28] Dimension no one in the sixth no one in
[1:21:31] the fifth no one under the sea wherever
[1:21:34] they died no man living no man dead in
[1:21:37] other words it was
[1:21:41] searched amen and John wept because he
[1:21:44] could find no man he could find no man
[1:21:48] because if that book was not taken out
[1:21:49] of the hand of the original owner where
[1:21:51] it had been lost by Adam and Eve so he's
[1:21:54] not telling us where it was
[1:21:56] lost in other words this book was once
[1:21:59] with
[1:22:01] man the mystery of God was once with man
[1:22:06] amen they forfeited their rights of the
[1:22:09] word the promises their inheritance
[1:22:11] remember they controlled the Earth they
[1:22:15] controlled the Earth he was an amateure
[1:22:18] God for he was Son of God and Son of God
[1:22:21] is an amateur God and the people in the
[1:22:23] message stumble at the flower in the rug
[1:22:27] amen that's a quote by the way brother
[1:22:30] Ram says they stumble at on the flower
[1:22:32] in the rug he was this amateur God this
[1:22:37] is the the thing they used to make an
[1:22:39] excuse we're amateur Gods we're not God
[1:22:43] we're amateur
[1:22:46] Gods see how quiet you
[1:22:50] went that ain't contrary to the
[1:22:53] scripture he's saying amateur God is Not
[1:22:55] contrary to the scripture why does this
[1:22:57] this Prophet have to explain this
[1:22:59] because people are going to Mis
[1:23:02] interpret him saying amateur God even
[1:23:05] Christ came and did exactly the same
[1:23:07] thing they understood listen if we know
[1:23:11] Christ came speaking and at every time
[1:23:14] he was speaking uh he said don't tell
[1:23:17] them don't say son of God don't say son
[1:23:19] of David don't say this sh don't tell
[1:23:21] them that and with all the don't tell
[1:23:24] them
[1:23:25] they still come and say you being a man
[1:23:27] make yourself
[1:23:28] God which means they were
[1:23:31] understanding what he was not saying
[1:23:33] yeah right amen they were not confused
[1:23:37] about it with all the terminology he was
[1:23:39] using and not using they
[1:23:42] understood he being a man is making
[1:23:45] himself God and this is a problem for us
[1:23:47] and then he makes a a a man's argument
[1:23:51] why but doesn't the word say Gods as if
[1:23:55] that proves anything he was just fooling
[1:23:59] with
[1:24:00] them right he was never going to tell
[1:24:02] them
[1:24:04] anything amen amen if you call them who
[1:24:08] this is what Jesus said if you call them
[1:24:09] who the word of God come to what does
[1:24:11] the word of God come to profit if you
[1:24:13] call them who the word of God come to
[1:24:15] Gods how can you condemn me when I say
[1:24:17] I'm the Son of God right there it
[1:24:20] is are you still with me on the journey
[1:24:25] all right so here it
[1:24:27] is we're going to tell the truth right
[1:24:29] amen sir the book made Adam God Amen on
[1:24:40] Earth that's it yeah Adam was God on
[1:24:44] Earth no no no he wasn't a God on Earth
[1:24:47] he wasn't an amateur God on Earth he was
[1:24:50] God on Earth amen man was the last
[1:24:54] unfolding of the great self-existing
[1:24:58] one he was the last
[1:25:01] manifestation go read Cod volume
[1:25:06] one question one on Genesis
[1:25:09] 1 amen he starts with this great
[1:25:12] self-existing one the Fountain of Life
[1:25:14] and the logos coming out and he speaks
[1:25:16] about all the plan that happens and
[1:25:18] literally tells you unfolded into man
[1:25:21] that's right man was the last man
[1:25:24] estation of
[1:25:27] himself and the book was in his
[1:25:32] hand when Eve stopped to reason Adam
[1:25:36] chose to walk out with her he chose to
[1:25:39] give
[1:25:40] up the book the position amen right is
[1:25:47] it really a crisis why do we need that
[1:25:50] book now watch what's happening let's
[1:25:52] wake up and smell the coffee like like
[1:25:55] say right let's see what's happening do
[1:25:58] you see what's happening around us yes
[1:26:00] sir in this world Amen everybody on
[1:26:03] Earth is living their own life in peace
[1:26:07] nobody is interested in any
[1:26:10] book we have worked out a good
[1:26:13] system you buy your food you don't even
[1:26:16] have to plant your food anymore you
[1:26:18] don't some of you don't even have to
[1:26:20] kill maybe some of you only kill cuz you
[1:26:22] like the sport and you like the meat but
[1:26:25] you really don't have to you can just go
[1:26:28] to the store and buy packaged beef and
[1:26:30] mints and chicken and shrimp and
[1:26:32] whatever you want you don't even know
[1:26:34] where shrimp
[1:26:38] lives oh what it
[1:26:43] eats it's delicious but they are the
[1:26:46] pigs of the
[1:26:49] ocean yeah they feed on the excrement of

[1:26:56] oh that is delicious they are the
[1:26:59] Scavengers the lobster and the shrimp
[1:27:02] and all but you don't even care you
[1:27:04] don't even have to because it's
[1:27:05] literally provided for you everything
[1:27:08] you need is brought it's in arms length
[1:27:10] it's in reach you can buy clothes you
[1:27:13] don't even have to stitch them anymore
[1:27:15] or cut the cloth you can just go to the
[1:27:16] store and buy it
[1:27:19] man without the book has created his own
[1:27:23] book
[1:27:26] right we have governments that protect
[1:27:28] well they're supposed to protect our
[1:27:31] borders they're supposed to make global
[1:27:34] trade uh profitable to
[1:27:37] us not the elites they're supposed to
[1:27:41] protect us they're not supposed to teach
[1:27:43] us morality that wasn't their
[1:27:45] job but they're doing that as
[1:27:48] well right governments are literally
[1:27:51] telling us what is moral and what is
[1:27:53] immoral
[1:27:55] and listen politics is
[1:27:59] immoral you hear that it is
[1:28:02] immoral if you vote for a government and
[1:28:07] giving it the right to kill someone yes
[1:28:12] sir you voted for that person to be
[1:28:18] killed that's the truth about politics
[1:28:21] politics is as far away from God as it
[1:28:23] should should be amen our government
[1:28:26] should not be teaching us the way it was
[1:28:28] under your founding fathers was the
[1:28:30] government takes care of the borders
[1:28:34] providing military protecting the nation
[1:28:37] uh providing U maybe even health care or
[1:28:40] something but uh global trade so it can
[1:28:43] sustain the nation but leave the
[1:28:45] morality to the
[1:28:47] church we'll teach them about marriage
[1:28:49] about gender about abortion but that
[1:28:52] leave that to us we'll handle that but
[1:28:55] now they're the
[1:28:58] preachers they're controlling the
[1:28:59] morality imagine some of the greatest
[1:29:02] things on the ballot in a few weeks time
[1:29:04] is morality look at these people talking
[1:29:07] about
[1:29:08] decency and a candidate who's more
[1:29:11] decent than another what is that there's
[1:29:14] no decent
[1:29:17] politician there's no decent politics
[1:29:19] it's all a ruse it's all a
[1:29:22] lie right
[1:29:25] why am I telling you this because the
[1:29:27] system has been created so man doesn't
[1:29:30] need a
[1:29:31] book man doesn't need the
[1:29:34] book everybody on Earth is living in
[1:29:37] peace and they don't need God they don't
[1:29:41] need the mystery of God we are all
[1:29:43] depending on the systems in fact nobody
[1:29:46] in this world cares about the knowledge
[1:29:48] of God anymore they literally brought
[1:29:50] out all the intellects Richard Dawkin
[1:29:52] Sam Harris uh Christopher Hitchens and
[1:29:55] they turned their Western Society
[1:29:58] Godless amen and those who are living
[1:30:01] are regretting it right because now you
[1:30:04] have these people rioting and protesting
[1:30:07] for stuff they don't even know about
[1:30:10] right and they're they're wishing they
[1:30:12] never turned a society
[1:30:15] Godless no one sees the importance of
[1:30:18] believing in God for survival for
[1:30:21] anything for wisdom no we we just don't
[1:30:24] need
[1:30:26] it you're going to you know life has
[1:30:28] become so
[1:30:30] soft if you really think about it it
[1:30:32] looks like we're we're bluffing
[1:30:34] ourselves we're just that this is why
[1:30:36] they say we're a cult we're a religion
[1:30:38] we're we're a philosophy if you ask your
[1:30:41] children today in reality there's no
[1:30:46] life expectancy argument for them your
[1:30:49] children are under the illusion that
[1:30:51] they're going to live a very long
[1:30:52] prosperous healthy life there's no death
[1:30:55] at their doorsteps there's no uh Twigs
[1:30:59] poking them in the nest this life is so
[1:31:02] comfortable we work we buy cars we buy
[1:31:06] homes we buy our clothes what is it
[1:31:09] really pushing us that I really need to
[1:31:12] go in the
[1:31:13] Rapture I really need to get out of this
[1:31:16] life that kind of only happens when you
[1:31:18] get some debilitating disease or
[1:31:20] something then you start getting
[1:31:22] desperate other than that that all is
[1:31:25] well we are
[1:31:28] blessed right which means that
[1:31:32] system is
[1:31:34] working on you and you actually have no
[1:31:38] desire for the mystery of
[1:31:41] God and all religions are bluffing
[1:31:44] themselves about worshiping God and
[1:31:46] waiting for him to Cal and and save us
[1:31:49] from what from this beautiful life
[1:31:54] amen of paychecks and good clothes and
[1:31:58] air conditioning and good cars and
[1:32:01] vacations please take us in the Rapture
[1:32:03] away from this horrible life we're
[1:32:07] enjoying your children are not confused
[1:32:10] about this it takes something of the
[1:32:14] Bride to desire the mystery of God that
[1:32:17] believes that that we need something
[1:32:20] that transcends this life of comfort but
[1:32:24] you must know that this world has
[1:32:26] created another
[1:32:31] book the bigger
[1:32:33] question more important question for us
[1:32:35] sitting
[1:32:36] here is knowing that Christ died to take
[1:32:39] away our sins enough to make you sons of
[1:32:43] God or is there
[1:32:45] more because that's what the
[1:32:48] Pentecostals and denominations are
[1:32:49] saying that's where they've
[1:32:51] stopped that he came came he died on the
[1:32:54] cross and he shed his blood for our sins
[1:32:57] and he took our sins away and then we
[1:32:59] wait for him to do the
[1:33:02] rest that's the
[1:33:04] idea is that
[1:33:06] enough because that's stopping with a
[1:33:10] manifestation a part of the
[1:33:11] manifestation of the mystery of God
[1:33:13] 2,000 years
[1:33:15] ago and more of the mystery of God was
[1:33:18] manifested through the church ages
[1:33:21] bringing it right to this end time and
[1:33:23] there's stopped
[1:33:25] there and and when we got the message we
[1:33:27] said oh look at these poor people stop
[1:33:29] there and then we got the message people
[1:33:31] and they stopped with William
[1:33:34] brandom right and they want us to stay
[1:33:37] stuck
[1:33:38] there let's go to the six seal message
[1:33:41] prise God paragraph 127 that's the
[1:33:44] reason John wept because if no one could
[1:33:46] get that book all creation everything
[1:33:49] was gone she just simply turned back to
[1:33:52] atoms molecules and so forth cos light
[1:33:54] not even be creation person nothing else
[1:33:58] cuz Adam lost the rights of that book he
[1:34:01] forfeit it when he listened to his wife
[1:34:03] and don't get distracted with that right
[1:34:06] she listened to Satan's reasonings in
[1:34:08] the stad of the word see it was
[1:34:10] forfeited then it couldn't go back into
[1:34:12] the dirty hands of Satan who tempted her
[1:34:14] out of the way the mystery of God could
[1:34:17] not go into the dirty hands of
[1:34:19] Satan right Satan was unable to it was
[1:34:23] not even meant for him the mystery of
[1:34:25] God was meant for
[1:34:28] man it went back to its original owner
[1:34:30] like any abstract deed would do goes
[1:34:33] right back to its original owner that
[1:34:35] was God the Creator who made it he holds
[1:34:39] it so Saints if man doesn't take that
[1:34:42] book again the Earth will come to an end
[1:34:46] as we see it clearly coming we're so on
[1:34:49] the brink of World War I an absolute
[1:34:53] annihilation
[1:34:55] right the signs are all over the planet
[1:34:57] religions have been expecting the end of
[1:34:59] the world for a long time uh I was
[1:35:02] speaking to um um a doctor I can't
[1:35:05] remember what his his station was what
[1:35:08] his specialty was but he he was telling
[1:35:11] me that uh I asked him what what does he
[1:35:14] think about the world and he said well
[1:35:16] there are several categories by which
[1:35:19] the world will come to an end and most
[1:35:21] scientists actually believe that it will
[1:35:24] that the world the the planet itself
[1:35:26] won't even go to a place where it will
[1:35:28] it will survive and U that life on Earth
[1:35:31] will will be completely destroyed
[1:35:33] somehow and they said like on the bottom
[1:35:35] of the list is like a a virus that just
[1:35:38] kills all humankind or another asteroid
[1:35:41] that smashes the Earth and destroys life
[1:35:43] on the planet fills the atmosphere with
[1:35:45] horrible gases but he said to me all
[1:35:49] scientists know that it is more likely
[1:35:52] for man to destroy destroy himself by
[1:35:54] nuclear war than for an asteroid and a
[1:35:58] virus or any other
[1:36:00] reason they believe that that's right
[1:36:05] amen religions have been expecting it
[1:36:07] this is why John was crying he saw the
[1:36:10] end of mankind he saw man
[1:36:14] Godless sinful
[1:36:17] annihilated more so he was crying
[1:36:20] because no man that ever existed was
[1:36:23] Worthy not even job or Enoch
[1:36:28] yeah what made us wor unworthy was our
[1:36:31] sexual birth that's right amen what
[1:36:35] makes us unworthy the way we were
[1:36:38] brought into
[1:36:40] existence why you get such good people I
[1:36:44] mean Mother Teresa people would say you
[1:36:48] know Mahatma Gandhi you know Nelson
[1:36:51] Mandela you know I'm sure they
[1:36:54] spouses had good lot to
[1:36:57] say but you know they think humanitarian
[1:37:00] soft Souls that love people
[1:37:04] self-sacrificing you can go through
[1:37:06] names and you know honest able whoever
[1:37:09] you want to you're never going to come
[1:37:11] up with someone who is worthy because as
[1:37:15] long as we conceived by sexual desire
[1:37:17] we're
[1:37:19] doomed right and that's where it ties
[1:37:22] into last night
[1:37:24] yeah that's
[1:37:26] right because someone
[1:37:28] else decided to overrule us within
[1:37:33] ourselves
[1:37:35] amen amen one of the elders Revelations
[1:37:38] 5:5 saith unto me weep not Behold The
[1:37:41] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[1:37:43] David had prevailed to open the book and
[1:37:45] to loose the Seven Seals thereof one of
[1:37:47] the elders shows us that we could that
[1:37:50] we should see the somewhere somewh where
[1:37:53] in the Old Testament he moves our Focus
[1:37:56] one of the elders symbolically Taps him
[1:37:59] on the shoulder and says the lion of the
[1:38:02] tribe of Judah has prevailed this this
[1:38:04] uh
[1:38:05] Prophet uh Apostle John is something's
[1:38:09] Rising inside of him and is telling him
[1:38:11] there's a revelation emanating from the
[1:38:13] Old Testament someone was worthy who can
[1:38:16] it be and uh lion means leader king of
[1:38:20] Judah Lion of the tribe of Judah hence
[1:38:23] the name son of David and Messiah that's
[1:38:26] who he is he has he has saved us he is
[1:38:29] worthy he has prevailed he overcame he
[1:38:32] fulfilled his purpose because he wasn't
[1:38:35] just a man he was God becoming a man and
[1:38:37] John who had doubts about
[1:38:41] Christ the way they understood him the
[1:38:43] Messiah to be a mighty prophet and
[1:38:46] Christ came and he died on the cross
[1:38:48] they he let them whip him he let them
[1:38:50] pluck out his beard he let them spit on
[1:38:52] his face he let the man handle him how
[1:38:56] could this be he that's right no man was
[1:39:00] worthy so was Jesus a man or
[1:39:04] not why was he worthy he was not
[1:39:07] conceived of sexual
[1:39:10] desire which
[1:39:11] means he had no son of the Bond woman
[1:39:15] right amen he had no Bond woman amen
[1:39:19] amen he was perfect in all things he
[1:39:22] could have taken the book for himself
[1:39:24] and rule the Earth but any single person
[1:39:28] conceived of sexual desire if you give
[1:39:30] him the book he'll never take it for
[1:39:32] anyone but
[1:39:35] himself that's why it had to take a lamb
[1:39:38] that's why it take one who was not born
[1:39:40] of sexual desire one conceived of the
[1:39:42] Holy Ghost who would come what is a lamb
[1:39:45] really about one who will take the book
[1:39:47] for others amen and not for himself one
[1:39:51] was willing to do that that glory to God
[1:39:55] that's what made him lamb he was the
[1:39:58] perfect sacrifice he's not asking you
[1:40:01] for the book now right he's not being
[1:40:04] offer of the book The qu the statement
[1:40:06] is take the
[1:40:07] book let's read it and I beheld in low
[1:40:11] in the midst of the throne out of the
[1:40:12] four beasts and in the midst of the
[1:40:13] eldest stood a lamb as it had been slain
[1:40:15] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:40:17] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:40:19] into all the Earth and he came and took
[1:40:22] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:40:24] that sat upon the throne oh let's break
[1:40:27] into
[1:40:28] that Lord there's this great person
[1:40:32] sitting in the throne are you still with
[1:40:34] us amen and there's four Liv creatures
[1:40:37] and there's 24 elders and there's a
[1:40:38] rainbow and there's a glass sea of glass
[1:40:42] and there's seven uh lamps of fire
[1:40:44] burning Before the Throne and this lamb
[1:40:47] just walks up and takes the
[1:40:49] book just strolls up and takes the book
[1:40:53] from the right hand of him that sat on
[1:40:55] the throne I mean you should expect like
[1:40:58] lightning to zap this lamb
[1:41:00] right if it had to be that way what does
[1:41:03] he think he just walks up it doesn't say
[1:41:05] he goes father please give me the book
[1:41:08] oh no the symbol say he takes the book
[1:41:12] amen come on break into it
[1:41:15] Saints understand this this is why it's
[1:41:18] not some fictitious Greek story about a
[1:41:21] son taking it from the father or asking
[1:41:24] or the father handing with loving eyes
[1:41:27] here you go my son take it he goes up
[1:41:29] and takes the book this tells us it's
[1:41:32] not about those stories it's God
[1:41:34] changing his
[1:41:36] manifestation a new manifestation taking
[1:41:39] the throne God revealing himself in a
[1:41:42] new way am so what John saw here was a
[1:41:45] lamb not being offered the book not
[1:41:47] asking for the book but taking the book
[1:41:50] nobody could just do that with God the
[1:41:52] way we think think God is you have to
[1:41:54] really understand this now this is
[1:41:56] symbolic of a son coming to
[1:42:00] maturity in our carnal thinking how
[1:42:03] could any lesser being just take
[1:42:05] something from a higher being more
[1:42:08] powerful being so clearly that's not
[1:42:11] what the symbol is revealing do you
[1:42:12] believe it's saying amen a change over
[1:42:16] from father to son the relationship of
[1:42:19] God to man becoming closer the mystery
[1:42:21] of God one part of it CH already
[1:42:25] manifesting father to son God who was
[1:42:30] father God becoming
[1:42:33] son right
[1:42:35] amen God that was one
[1:42:38] part in other words Christ was making it
[1:42:41] possible for man to get the revelation
[1:42:44] of who God is the father becoming the
[1:42:47] son in Jesus Christ was only a stepping
[1:42:50] stone to bring the book back to man amen
[1:42:53] amen no man cometh to the father but by
[1:42:57] me that's what it actually means there's
[1:43:01] no way for man to get the mystery of God
[1:43:03] unless I came and was manifested here in
[1:43:07] flesh oh Hallelujah the Seven Seals now
[1:43:11] was this problem because so he took the
[1:43:13] book but now these seals have to be
[1:43:14] broken amen because the work of Satan
[1:43:17] and the sinfulness of man man was not
[1:43:19] yet ready to take the book even with the
[1:43:21] gifts of the Holy Ghost and the power of
[1:43:23] God through the church ages they spoke
[1:43:25] with tongues they prophesied they healed
[1:43:27] the sick they raised the dead they
[1:43:30] crossed oceans they were bitten by
[1:43:32] serpents they drank poisons they had so
[1:43:35] much of power and with all that holy
[1:43:37] ghost power they were still not
[1:43:40] worthy
[1:43:41] amen so the lamb had to sit on the
[1:43:44] throne for 2,000 years of church ages
[1:43:46] waiting for the Holy Ghost to finish
[1:43:49] find the worthy ones whose names were in
[1:43:52] the book when the time was wi he would
[1:43:54] come down himself and what put the book
[1:43:59] in the hands of man he comes down with
[1:44:02] an open book in his
[1:44:05] hand Revelations 1 uh paragraph 1 180
[1:44:09] Revelation 5 part 2 you still with me
[1:44:12] they could not hold it for that I pass
[1:44:15] that 50th day cuz that was a day of
[1:44:16] Jubilee when everything went back to its
[1:44:18] original beginning and the power of God
[1:44:19] was taken back to its original 50th day
[1:44:21] let's go to the next paragraph there
[1:44:23] will come another Year of Jubilee and
[1:44:25] that we've had it about this time if you
[1:44:26] notice Pentecost has been falling in
[1:44:28] America for about 50 years somewhere in
[1:44:31] that time just about 50 years ago
[1:44:33] Pentecost Begin to Fall now what's
[1:44:36] happening the church is receiving the
[1:44:39] seven seal book of the revelation of
[1:44:41] Jesus Christ of the Seven Seals and not
[1:44:44] one tenth of them can receive it that's
[1:44:49] right listen I'm going to say it again
[1:44:51] open your eyes amen this Prophet is
[1:44:53] telling you 5050 years ago Pentecost
[1:44:56] began to
[1:44:57] fall right now the seven seal book which
[1:45:01] was sealed is open sir we are receiving
[1:45:04] it and no one's available or ready to
[1:45:08] take it that's right not one/ tenth of
[1:45:11] them he confirmed for us that the book
[1:45:14] was descending amen the book was sealed
[1:45:17] to man those seals had to be broken so
[1:45:20] that man could know what is written
[1:45:21] within the book so his next Duty the
[1:45:24] Lamb's Duty was to open the seals for us
[1:45:26] because no man was worthy to do that and
[1:45:28] what happens right Revelations 5: 8-9
[1:45:32] and when he had taken the
[1:45:35] book please I don't want to preach too
[1:45:37] long so you are you seeing what taking
[1:45:41] the book means okay the four beasts and
[1:45:44] the 4 and20 Elders fell down before the
[1:45:47] lamb having every one of them Harps and
[1:45:49] golden vials full of olders which are
[1:45:50] the prayers of saints symbols
[1:45:53] and they sang a new song saying Thou Art
[1:45:55] Worthy to take the book Thou Art Worthy
[1:45:58] they sang a new
[1:46:00] song Amen and new worship comes off
[1:46:04] Amen in other words they are seeing
[1:46:07] these people who are recognizing the
[1:46:09] lamb amen taking the book it brings a
[1:46:12] new worship to them right it's not some
[1:46:15] new song We'll learn sometime this is
[1:46:17] happening this has happened amen and to
[1:46:19] open the seals thereof for thou was
[1:46:21] slain has redeemed us unto God God by
[1:46:23] thy blood out of every Kindred tongue
[1:46:25] and people and nation that law statement
[1:46:28] tells us it's worldwide amen notice how
[1:46:32] things changed when the lamb uh sat down
[1:46:34] in the throne you know brother mam says
[1:46:35] he took the the book and sat down in the
[1:46:37] throne right so those four beasts and 20
[1:46:41] Elders always fall down and worship
[1:46:44] whoever is in the throne with the
[1:46:46] book amen right so here he takes the
[1:46:50] book he sits down they do exactly what
[1:46:51] they did in Revelations 4
[1:46:53] amen amen they fall down before Christ
[1:46:56] showing us that the rulership of Heaven
[1:46:58] Was now under a new manifestation a new
[1:47:01] name the name of Jesus all worship was
[1:47:05] now directed in his name a new song and
[1:47:08] he redeemed us unto God let's move on
[1:47:10] chap uh verse 10 and has made us unto
[1:47:14] our God Kings and Priests and we shall
[1:47:17] rain on the
[1:47:19] earth can you see it coming closer it's
[1:47:22] bringing us to Reign to rule it was now
[1:47:26] revealed that the lamb was putting
[1:47:28] rulership back in the hands of man
[1:47:31] because that was what was lost we will
[1:47:34] take back our Earth from this Beast
[1:47:37] system that's running mankind the only
[1:47:40] way we can is by taking this book we
[1:47:43] will take back our Earth yes amen the
[1:47:46] kings of this Earth and Satan uh will
[1:47:48] take it back from them we will do this
[1:47:50] only by the book and that he will place
[1:47:53] in our hands because he became man the
[1:47:56] book shifted again from Heaven to Earth
[1:48:00] that's where it's coming to do you see
[1:48:02] it okay so he was the second Adam
[1:48:06] displaying the book in the hands of
[1:48:09] man this is why there was need for a
[1:48:12] second Adam and he went away and shared
[1:48:14] his promise was to share his mystery of
[1:48:18] God With Us
[1:48:21] amen you believe that amen who is Christ
[1:48:24] The Mystery of God revealed amen that's
[1:48:28] not a trinitarian
[1:48:31] Doctrine no Christ The Mystery of God
[1:48:35] revealed it didn't even say Jesus the
[1:48:38] mystery of God revealed it said Christ
[1:48:41] what is Christ a fleshly
[1:48:47] vessel a messiah is a fleshly vessel an
[1:48:51] Earthly vessel Christ is a
[1:48:54] man
[1:48:56] amen let's say the another
[1:48:59] way the anointed man was the mystery of
[1:49:03] God
[1:49:09] revealed what how do we know because
[1:49:12] when they asked him what will be the
[1:49:13] sign of your coming he said false
[1:49:17] christs will arise there will be men on
[1:49:23] Earth who will claim to be me who will
[1:49:26] claim to be Christ who will make it look
[1:49:29] like they will have the
[1:49:32] book
[1:49:34] so

[1:49:43] book absolutely nothing without the open
[1:49:46] book that's Revelations

[1:49:56] upon his head and his face was as it
[1:49:57] were the Sun and his feet as PL as a

[1:53:51] it everything he said came to pass made
[1:53:54] it possible made it true I begin to
[1:53:57] experience everything he said would be
[1:53:59] sweet in the mouth and bitter in the
[1:54:01] belly easy to love easy to worship easy
[1:54:04] to praise but it's difficult to become
[1:54:07] alive it's difficult it's going to take
[1:54:09] some victory it's going to take some
[1:54:11] fighting amen that voice from Heaven
[1:54:13] speaks to John and who represents the
[1:54:16] believer take the book the book crosses
[1:54:19] hands was not meant to be on a throne of
[1:54:22] Heaven it was meant to be in your hand
[1:54:25] and my hand that's what the Plan of
[1:54:28] Redemption was all about and what is the
[1:54:31] mystery of God Christ
[1:54:35] amen Christ Christ is an anointed
[1:54:45] man the mystery of
[1:54:47] God is the right to rule
[1:54:53] praise God that's what it actually means
[1:54:56] to be
[1:54:57] God man's understanding of God is an
[1:55:01] idol right who we sing to bow down to
[1:55:04] worship say nice words to him that's not
[1:55:07] what it means to be
[1:55:11] God Moses you shall be
[1:55:14] God and Aaron thy
[1:55:18] Prophet
[1:55:20] amen God means the right to
[1:55:25] rule the right to have dominion over all
[1:55:28] things Adam was God on Earth am that's
[1:55:33] what we
[1:55:34] lost this is what come this is the
[1:55:37] purpose of the Bride the bride is not
[1:55:40] some fancy term in the message that just
[1:55:44] means we're extra special Elite people
[1:55:47] that will be transported one day into a
[1:55:49] happy
[1:55:50] place Bride is a
[1:55:53] responsibility bride means bride
[1:55:55] reflects the equality of man and God
[1:55:58] come back again co-ee equality that was
[1:56:02] lost by sin in the beginning that
[1:56:03] separated the first husband and wife
[1:56:06] bride means marriage bride shows the two
[1:56:09] coming back Heaven and Earth embracing
[1:56:12] the the book can only come back to
[1:56:13] someone who has had that or is part of
[1:56:16] that not someone living under law or
[1:56:19] Grace or intercession someone who is Bri
[1:56:22] is expressing God and man becoming one
[1:56:25] and the book can only come back to that
[1:56:28] manifestation that's why it had to wait
[1:56:30] and the Mystery of God has been
[1:56:33] finished all that it took to bring a
[1:56:35] bride has been finished all the
[1:56:38] messengers all the preachers all the
[1:56:40] prophets priests psalmist Kings sages
[1:56:43] all the books written everything every
[1:56:45] word that was meant to be spoken has
[1:56:47] been complete it is ready there is the
[1:56:50] mystery of God ready on Earth and a a
[1:56:53] vessel to receive the book the right to
[1:57:00] rule but that right to rule was sealed
[1:57:03] with Seven
[1:57:04] Seals and this is where the Bond woman
[1:57:07] and her son came in cuz they were the
[1:57:10] cause of
[1:57:12] it
[1:57:14] right because there in the church ages
[1:57:18] the Bond woman was that Roman Catholic
[1:57:21] system
[1:57:22] that then took the very mystery of
[1:57:25] Christ and who he is and sealed it with
[1:57:31] white horse rider red horse rider on and
[1:57:34] on and what did they do with it they
[1:57:36] took the power for themselves they made
[1:57:39] it at the church and then they made it
[1:57:42] the
[1:57:43] pope and he became the
[1:57:46] representative just doing that making
[1:57:49] him a representative of Christ and
[1:57:52] telling you you can only come to God
[1:57:55] through him and then you became so bad
[1:57:58] you couldn't even go to him directly you
[1:58:00] had to go to St Christopher or Mary and
[1:58:03] pray to Mary to pray to Jesus to Jesus
[1:58:05] to the father and then even before that
[1:58:08] even even if you got that right you're
[1:58:10] still unworthy you to come to the
[1:58:13] pope now we're not picking on the
[1:58:15] Catholic church that
[1:58:17] format passed down to every Church am
[1:58:23] yes what does that do to a human who
[1:58:26] believes in Christ who does not
[1:58:29] understand he's always going to feel
[1:58:32] unworthy he's always going to never know
[1:58:35] what it is to be God here we are sitting
[1:58:38] in this you know when we preach this
[1:58:40] series in our church I had the question
[1:58:44] and I I love the question it was brother
[1:58:47] Al you know if we are God who do we pray
[1:58:50] to
[1:58:52] it was a sincere
[1:58:54] question and the question was that way
[1:58:57] because we are people who always
[1:59:01] imagine someone else we are praying to
[1:59:04] because we have been brought up with
[1:59:07] this this culture this
[1:59:10] tradition I was telling brother Chad the
[1:59:13] other day I said one of these days when
[1:59:16] my 8-year-old is grown up and he
[1:59:19] understands more respect I'm going to
[1:59:21] sit at our lunch table dinner table and
[1:59:23] I'm going to say I bless this
[1:59:29] food in the name of Jesus
[1:59:34] Christ because I've come to that
[1:59:36] understanding that I can bless something
[1:59:38] yes
[1:59:43] amen I believe it I bless this
[1:59:47] food I can always have the traditional
[1:59:50] prayer Lord bless this food and make
[1:59:52] sure it's not poisonous you know and
[1:59:55] keep me safe and give it strength to our
[1:59:57] bodies and whatever when let me ask you
[2:00:00] something when you pray for something
[2:00:03] does God send an angel to do it for you
[2:00:06] no do you not know that you go out and
[2:00:09] do it yourself
[2:00:12] right you go out somehow and get it done
[2:00:16] yourself who's doing
[2:00:19] that it is the mystery of God in you
[2:00:23] getting what you prayed for to
[2:00:26] yourself that potential is in you God is
[2:00:31] literally working through you the
[2:00:33] mystery of God is literally working
[2:00:34] through you for whatever you need it's
[2:00:37] going to go out and come back through
[2:00:39] what you
[2:00:41] do it's no longer Christian traditions
[2:00:44] this is a reality am he's not sending
[2:00:47] some angel with something that plops
[2:00:49] down in front of you and zap miracle
[2:00:52] thank you Lord for providing this it's
[2:00:55] going out and and and and it's expanded
[2:00:58] because it'll it'll happen through
[2:01:00] somebody else in the body somebody else
[2:01:02] in the body something else happened even
[2:01:05] the fact that you walk into places and
[2:01:08] there's unbelievers who will get things
[2:01:10] done for
[2:01:13] you to the nth degree we don't even know
[2:01:17] why they did it amen it's because it's
[2:01:20] happening through you
[2:01:23] am you got to start believing this
[2:01:26] Saints what are those seals and this is
[2:01:29] where we're closing it down this is
[2:01:31] where we come to that Bond woman and her
[2:01:33] son it is sealed because of that b Bond
[2:01:36] woman and her son they were the ruling
[2:01:39] power they took over the carnal nature
[2:01:42] what is the carnal nature what is the
[2:01:44] right to rule sealed with yes first one
[2:01:49] is a religious spirit right that's right
[2:01:52] amen your religious spirit yeah amen
[2:01:58] right your way of
[2:02:00] praying going to
[2:02:02] church being a religious
[2:02:05] person loving the Lord in some religious
[2:02:09] way uh believing in the blood of Christ
[2:02:13] the way Pentecost preached it yes the
[2:02:15] church you came from the culture you
[2:02:18] had that's a white horse rider it's an
[2:02:21] impost
[2:02:22] amen it's not the real belief in Christ
[2:02:25] it's not the real belief in God it's
[2:02:27] what stemmed from the denomination you
[2:02:29] came
[2:02:31] from what is a red horse rider it's
[2:02:34] taking religion and law and joining it
[2:02:36] for
[2:02:38] control you can do that in your family
[2:02:41] you can do that as a husband you can do
[2:02:43] that as a person in yourself right as
[2:02:46] long as you have a religious spirit m a
[2:02:50] political Spirit yeah a black horse
[2:02:52] rider a pale horse rider the fifth seal
[2:02:56] an eye for an eye a tooth for tooth how
[2:02:58] long can you uh avenge us oh God that is
[2:03:02] a spirit of
[2:03:03] Vengeance a Son of God cannot take the
[2:03:07] land cannot take the book with a spirit
[2:03:09] of
[2:03:10] Vengeance the six seal is all about what
[2:03:15] wars earthquakes trauma rumors of wars

[2:03:38] uh Church problems Church splits false
[2:03:42] doctrines that's a six seal right there
[2:03:44] it's an interruption of
[2:03:47] nature if all those things still affect
[2:03:50] you it still seals the book that's right
[2:03:52] because if all those things still affect
[2:03:55] you how are you going to be God right
[2:04:00] how how will you rule if those things
[2:04:02] make you question who you are and
[2:04:04] question God right I'm not coming to
[2:04:07] church anymore I've been such a good
[2:04:09] person where is God in my need where is
[2:04:12] God in my time of need how could this
[2:04:14] have happened to

[2:04:19] amen if you are unable
[2:04:22] to deal as being the bride deal with
[2:04:24] Petty things like
[2:04:26] that if you come to a place where Petty
[2:04:29] things like that make you question God
[2:04:31] question his Prophet listen to these
[2:04:33] people discrediting the prophet
[2:04:36] questioning the cloud and puts a thing
[2:04:38] in your heart to say how could this
[2:04:40] happen amen
[2:04:42] bromism this is happening in the message
[2:04:45] we can't trust listen if you're a person
[2:04:47] who have a spirit of racism in you you
[2:04:49] cannot take the book that's right if you
[2:04:52] have any kind of prejudice you cannot
[2:04:54] take the book if you even feel inferior
[2:04:57] to someone else you cannot take the
[2:05:00] book you need to get over
[2:05:03] yourself praise the Lord that's what the
[2:05:06] seals of your life are you cannot take
[2:05:09] the book unless the revelation of this
[2:05:12] day breaks those seals away so you
[2:05:15] personally can take the right to rule
[2:05:18] you can never overcome and what do we
[2:05:20] want to rule first the Bor woman and a
[2:05:22] son need to be cast out how can we cast
[2:05:26] them out we read a quote last night you
[2:05:28] cannot do this by yourself you cannot do
[2:05:31] this by works you cannot do it by church
[2:05:33] this is why everything fails right now
[2:05:36] tongues prophecies interpretations
[2:05:38] fasting prayer
[2:05:40] religiosity praying five times a day
[2:05:43] having prayer meetings having Holy Ghost
[2:05:45] Services nothing can work because those
[2:05:47] seals of your life have to be broken
[2:05:50] there's no other way that you can have
[2:05:52] the mystery of God and still be affected
[2:05:55] by those
[2:05:57] things praise be to God it is Christ
[2:06:00] revealed in you God is dwelling in you
[2:06:04] this is the original purpose amen let's
[2:06:08] read these quotes quickly and then we
[2:06:09] can close the breach message this seven
[2:06:12] seal book is revealed at the time of the
[2:06:14] seventh THS of Revelations 10 done amen
[2:06:17] I believe
[2:06:19] it the mystery of the the seven seal
[2:06:22] book will be revealed at the sounding of
[2:06:24] the seven Church Angels message I
[2:06:26] believe
[2:06:27] it amen the seven Angel begins to sound
[2:06:30] there's the messages wrote out there got
[2:06:32] it on Cape and book form I believe it
[2:06:34] amen at the beginning of the sounding of
[2:06:37] the message the mystery of God should be
[2:06:39] finished I believe
[2:06:41] it now we will notice the book of The
[2:06:44] Mystery of God is Not revealed until the
[2:06:47] seventh Angel's messenger message is
[2:06:49] sounded I believe it yes his message is
[2:06:53] sounded that means the book of The
[2:06:55] Mystery of God is
[2:06:57] revealed these points will be important
[2:06:59] in the seals I'm sure cuz it must every
[2:07:02] bit tie together now it's wrote
[2:07:05] mysterious because no man knows where it
[2:07:07] is God alone Jesus Christ yes God Amen
[2:07:10] paragraph 39 Bridge message now but it
[2:07:13] is a book a mystery mysterious book it's
[2:07:15] a book of redemption we'll get into that
[2:07:17] in a little while and now we know that
[2:07:19] this book of redemption will not be
[2:07:21] thoroughly
[2:07:22] understood it's probed that through six
[2:07:25] church church ages but at the end when
[2:07:27] the seventh angel begins to sound his
[2:07:28] mystery he winds up all those loose
[2:07:31] hands that these fellows probed at amen
[2:07:34] and the Mystery the Mysteries comes down
[2:07:37] from God as the word of God and reveals
[2:07:40] the entire revelation of
[2:07:45] God Amen then the godhead and everything
[2:07:49] else is
[2:07:50] settled I love that because as long as
[2:07:53] the this these seals are are not broken
[2:07:56] and
[2:07:57] listen please make it personal every
[2:08:00] time you read it sir stop talking about
[2:08:03] the seals like a white horse rider from
[2:08:05] Paul's day talk about your
[2:08:08] seals as soon as these seals are open
[2:08:12] everything else is settled why do I
[2:08:14] still have questions on the godhead why
[2:08:17] are things in the word still bugging me
[2:08:19] why can I not understand this you know
[2:08:22] what when I don't understand something I
[2:08:24] always believe it first am and then I
[2:08:28] look for the understanding to confirm
[2:08:30] what I believe I don't go the other way
[2:08:32] around let's look for it and then when I
[2:08:35] understand it then I believe I believe
[2:08:37] first then I
[2:08:39] understand glory to God Saints then the
[2:08:43] godhead and everything else marriage and
[2:08:45] divorce message is not given to you as a
[2:08:48] solution to bad problems I I hate that I
[2:08:52] hate to use the the marriage and divorce
[2:08:54] messes to handle messy marriages I want
[2:08:57] to preach so we don't have messy
[2:08:59] marriages I want to preach so we don't
[2:09:01] have divorces I don't want to have
[2:09:03] solutions to bad things I want to preach
[2:09:06] I want to have the word so we stop the
[2:09:08] bad things glory to God Amen and he says
[2:09:12] all the Mysteries serpent seed becomes
[2:09:15] clearer after after your seals are open
[2:09:19] that's right ser and Seed becomes
[2:09:20] clearer and whatever more is to be
[2:09:22] revealed now you see I'm just not making
[2:09:25] that up that's what it's thus sayith the
[2:09:29] Lorden
[2:09:31] amen paragraphs uh we we're closing
[2:09:34] musicians can come up and there's only
[2:09:37] one thing left when the seven seal book
[2:09:39] is open then the entire mystery of God
[2:09:42] why we Prov at it through the years and
[2:09:44] according to the scripture then when
[2:09:46] there was no way to understand it until
[2:09:48] this day you believe the entire mystery
[2:09:50] of God
[2:09:51] yes sir entire
[2:09:53] finished there's no more manifestation
[2:09:56] after the bride in the dimension of time
[2:09:59] that's it it's over amen we probed at it
[2:10:03] through the years and according to the
[2:10:04] scripture when there was no way to
[2:10:06] understand it until this day because
[2:10:08] it's been hereit we've seen the symbol
[2:10:11] what it was symbolized by but it could
[2:10:13] not be correctly revealed until the last
[2:10:16] day now then we must be there at the end
[2:10:20] time praise be to God I believe
[2:10:25] it which brings us to the
[2:10:29] theme the mystery of God is the right to
[2:10:34] rule amen and the right to rule gives
[2:10:37] you the power to put out the born woman
[2:10:39] and her
[2:10:41] son prise God glory to God this is what
[2:10:45] brings it together come and take the
[2:10:48] book amen the mystery of God is the
[2:10:53] right to rule do not do not faint at it
[2:10:58] no one is saying that if the bride is
[2:11:01] God manifested in flesh that we are
[2:11:03] people who are standing here and
[2:11:05] accepting worship from others and we are
[2:11:08] placing ourselves above Jesus
[2:11:10] Christ they don't understand what it
[2:11:12] means to be God that's why they're
[2:11:13] stumbling at it what does it mean to be
[2:11:16] God to
[2:11:17] rule God is an English word which God
[2:11:20] himself didn't make up yeah we made it
[2:11:23] up and messed it up he just used what we
[2:11:27] understand the word God is a different
[2:11:29] word in many other languages du deity
[2:11:33] yes sir right all different words what
[2:11:36] does it mean man has transferred that
[2:11:38] meaning by his interpretation to be an
[2:11:41] idol who people bow down to and worship
[2:11:43] and exall as greater than them but to
[2:11:46] God the word god means to rule to sit in
[2:11:50] the throne to hold the book to control
[2:11:53] things of creation on Earth he was God
[2:11:57] when Angels were created before that he
[2:11:59] was a self-existing one he became a
[2:12:02] father when he brought forth Sons he
[2:12:04] became the man Christ when he came to be
[2:12:07] an intercessor for sin but being God is
[2:12:11] included in the mystery of the father in
[2:12:13] the mystery of Christ amen and the bride
[2:12:16] is the final manifestation that is our
[2:12:19] faith this is the reason there's a us
[2:12:21] that the book had to be brought down to
[2:12:23] us do you believe that the mystery of
[2:12:26] God is the right to rule and the right
[2:12:29] to rule is what gives you the power to
[2:12:32] cast out the carnality of the Flesh and
[2:12:34] the worship that emanates from the
[2:12:36] carnality of the Flesh in other words
[2:12:39] the right to rule will cancel out the
[2:12:43] conception of sexual desire amen and
[2:12:46] that's what takes us in the
[2:12:47] translation that's what makes it
[2:12:49] possible for us to be put back back in
[2:12:51] touch with our theophany and then come
[2:12:53] back again for the Millennium in
[2:12:56] Perfection and we shall Rule and
[2:13:01] Reign praise the Lord let's stand

[2:14:51] a new day has
[2:14:54] begun Mercy made us free from sin
[2:15:01] today for the joy that fills my soul for
[2:15:06] the message is my
[2:15:09] all thank you Jesus for this day of
[2:15:17] Liberty
[2:15:19] amen amen are you thankful that you're
[2:15:22] free amen free from what we we've known
[2:15:27] we're free from denomination we're free
[2:15:29] from false ideas free from
[2:15:31] Traditions but oh how we've been
[2:15:33] learning that I need to be free from
[2:15:37] this amen I got out of denominations but
[2:15:40] I still carried this out of the
[2:15:41] denomination I still carried this we
[2:15:44] brought it into the message and has been
[2:15:46] troubling us all
[2:15:48] along but Paul began to bring a message
[2:15:50] message that would show us how to
[2:15:52] possess our
[2:15:53] vessels and I believe this message in
[2:15:55] the end time has come to perfectly give
[2:15:57] us understanding on how to P
[2:16:01] possess how to rule the
[2:16:04] Earth amen I've said before and I've
[2:16:07] thought before we want to rule the Earth
[2:16:08] we want to get to the Millennium we want
[2:16:10] to be Kings and Priests but God has
[2:16:12] given us one little patch of Earth to
[2:16:14] start with and that's this patch right
[2:16:17] here and we're learning how to rule and
[2:16:19] reign as those SE seals break the
[2:16:21] mystery off of us and we realize who it
[2:16:24] is that's in us and we don't have to
[2:16:26] succumb to this patch of Earth we can
[2:16:28] rule it it's not to rule
[2:16:32] us oh what an eye openening lesson we
[2:16:36] have
[2:16:37] friends amen it's not this kind of
[2:16:40] teaching sometimes scares people because
[2:16:42] you being a man make yourself equal to
[2:16:44] God is so somehow we begin to rule over
[2:16:47] each other and we begin to dict no this
[2:16:50] Revelation come so that I will possess
[2:16:53] this vessel and bring it subject to God
[2:16:56] and obedience and surrender to manifest
[2:16:58] Jesus Christ upon this earth right here
[2:17:03] amen it's all about me the Revelation to
[2:17:07] one person to the individual to do what
[2:17:10] to give us the power to
[2:17:13] overcome what man's never been able to
[2:17:15] overcome
[2:17:20] maam said it was Christ in Moses it was
[2:17:23] Christ in Noah it was Christ in
[2:17:25] David but Noah couldn't overcome
[2:17:29] Noah Moses couldn't overcome Moses and
[2:17:32] David couldn't overcome David
[2:17:34] yeah but now it's Christ in you the hope
[2:17:38] of glory and God has come and give us a
[2:17:41] book and God Has Come himself to enter
[2:17:44] into his bride so that we can break the
[2:17:48] cycle prise the Lord thank you Lord God
