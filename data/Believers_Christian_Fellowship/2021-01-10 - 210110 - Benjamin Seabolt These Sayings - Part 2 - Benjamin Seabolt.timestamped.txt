[8:26] [Music]
[8:29] praise the lord it's dangerous words to
[8:32] utter if you don't mean it
[8:35] i heard a man say that one time he said
[8:37] i got down on my knees and
[8:39] i prayed lord make me more like thee
[8:43] and then he did and it wasn't a pleasant
[8:46] experience
[8:47] so we have to be careful about what
[8:49] we're asking and we have to mean what
[8:51] we're asking
[8:52] but i know that's each and every one of
[8:54] our hearts desires
[8:55] here this morning thank you musicians i
[8:58] appreciate that appreciate the
[8:59] atmosphere
[9:00] here this morning if you have your
[9:03] bibles we'll just go ahead and turn to
[9:05] the book of john chapter 10.
[9:11] we're going to begin reading it verse 24
[9:16] john 10 24.
[9:19] i've been spending so much time in the
[9:21] book of john that
[9:23] william is now preaching to me at the
[9:25] house out of the book of john
[9:27] so he don't know any other book well
[9:29] i'll take that back he knows i think
[9:31] three other books but
[9:32] when he uh gets his little bible out
[9:34] let's turn to the book of john
[9:37] so i don't foresee myself going anywhere
[9:40] anytime shortly there is so much lane
[9:42] here when jesus comes and starts
[9:44] speaking these things
[9:47] let's begin reading here at
[9:50] john 10 24 and we'll read through 31
[9:54] it says then came the jews round about
[9:56] him and said unto him
[9:59] how long dost thou make us to doubt
[10:02] if thou be the christ tell us plainly
[10:06] jesus answered them i told you and you
[10:08] believe
[10:09] not the works that i do in my father's
[10:12] name
[10:12] they bear witness of me but ye believe
[10:15] not because you're not of my sheep as i
[10:18] said unto you
[10:20] my sheep hear my voice and i know them
[10:23] and they follow me
[10:25] and i give unto them eternal life and
[10:27] they shall never perish
[10:28] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[10:31] my hand
[10:32] my father which gave them me is greater
[10:34] than all
[10:35] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[10:38] my father's hand
[10:39] i and my father are one
[10:43] then the jews took up stones again to
[10:46] stone him
[10:47] let's just bow our heads together
[10:49] precious lord jesus we
[10:53] humbly thank you lord for this
[10:54] opportunity once again together together
[10:57] lord
[10:59] lord as we so often say not to gather
[11:02] around
[11:03] a man's idea or to socialize
[11:07] lord or just to come and to see each
[11:10] other
[11:12] father but we've been given an
[11:14] opportunity to come and together
[11:16] around you lord the revealed word for
[11:20] our age
[11:21] lord and we don't take that
[11:23] understanding lightly we
[11:25] appreciate that lord for we know that
[11:28] one day we will
[11:29] look back on these as just fond memories
[11:32] so i would pray that as we would still
[11:34] have this opportunity that
[11:36] we would take full advantage of it lord
[11:38] and that we would just
[11:39] yield ourselves to you both speaker and
[11:42] hear that you could come
[11:43] and that you could do what you have
[11:45] divinely orchestrated to do this morning
[11:48] we asked lord that you would come and do
[11:50] that which only
[11:52] you can do and that is to take this book
[11:54] and to loose the seals and to speak the
[11:56] word father
[11:58] we ask this in the name of the lord
[11:59] jesus christ amen
[12:02] god bless you as you would have your
[12:04] seats i would just like to continue this
[12:06] morning
[12:06] i'm sure no surprise with
[12:09] these other things that brother branham
[12:13] has spoke about in the quote
[12:15] the seed is not heir with the shock he
[12:17] says luther
[12:19] had justification wesley had
[12:22] sanctification
[12:24] pentecostals had the restoration of the
[12:26] gifts
[12:27] but when the word come now they could
[12:30] produce that justification would save a
[12:33] man speaking of luther's day
[12:35] you believe that sure it was a carrier
[12:38] of the word just the same as i believe a
[12:40] stalk is part of the wheat
[12:42] sure it is but it's the carrier it ain't
[12:45] the life
[12:46] then along came sanctification how many
[12:49] believes in sanctification
[12:51] if you believe the bible you have to
[12:53] sure
[12:54] so still that's not it but
[12:57] then come the pentecost the restoration
[13:00] of the gifts speaking in tongues there
[13:04] they called that the initial evidence
[13:06] which brought forth what
[13:07] the shock but they denominated
[13:10] but when you come to say i and the
[13:13] father are one
[13:15] i and my father are one and these
[13:18] other things then the shuck will pull
[13:20] away from it
[13:22] but the real genuine bride church
[13:25] will bring forth the entire word of god
[13:28] in its fullness
[13:30] and in its strength for he's the same
[13:32] yesterday today
[13:34] and forever so this is obviously where
[13:37] i'm drawing my context or my inspiration
[13:39] from if you would say that
[13:40] because brother branham is making a
[13:45] comment here that when you come to say i
[13:48] and the father are one and these other
[13:50] things the shock will pull away from
[13:52] that
[13:53] and the way that he's making that
[13:54] comment is
[13:56] referencing and implying similarities of
[14:00] comments similar to i and my father are
[14:03] one
[14:05] so obviously me being the curious person
[14:07] that i am when he says these other
[14:09] things then
[14:10] then i have to know what these other
[14:11] things are and i believe by the
[14:13] grace of the of the lord that he's
[14:16] laying these things out to us
[14:17] and as i told you in the prior service
[14:20] these are not
[14:21] necessarily new things to us because
[14:24] these are things that have we've had the
[14:26] privilege of setting under a ministry
[14:27] that
[14:28] has been teaching these things so i just
[14:30] told brother chad in the back
[14:32] i think my role is that of peter as i've
[14:34] come along and just said this
[14:36] is that so it's not necessarily anything
[14:40] new
[14:40] but it's just to draw our attention
[14:44] and to maybe give us a little bit better
[14:46] clearer and concise and
[14:48] focused understanding of what exactly we
[14:50] have been hearing
[14:52] and how we should view that because
[14:54] brother branham says that
[14:56] when you say these other things
[14:59] the shock will pull away so
[15:02] if we've already been saying these other
[15:04] things
[15:05] what should be happening and what should
[15:07] we be seeing
[15:09] so i just want to bring
[15:12] if by the by the grace of the lord i
[15:13] just want to bring that into perspective
[15:16] that when that shuck starts pulling away
[15:18] don't let it surprise you because we've
[15:20] been saying these things we've been
[15:21] living these things we've been believing
[15:23] these things
[15:24] and the implications that come from that
[15:27] should not shock us
[15:28] it was the same that happened in genesis
[15:31] it was the same that happened when jesus
[15:33] was here
[15:34] it's going to be the same reaction when
[15:36] we begin to say those things
[15:39] so as we looked at the first part of
[15:41] that um
[15:43] back at the end of december we
[15:46] learned a few things we just as a way of
[15:49] a quick review for maybe some that
[15:51] weren't here i'm not going to spend a
[15:52] lot of time on this but just as a very
[15:54] quick review
[15:56] we learned that brother branham told us
[15:57] that the father's business
[16:00] was to destroy denominational thinking
[16:03] by explaining the scriptures with their
[16:06] true
[16:07] spiritual meaning and to fulfill the
[16:09] scriptures that's written of yourself
[16:11] that was the father's business
[16:15] we learn that the bride does have the
[16:17] power to remit sin
[16:19] of unbelief by presenting the living
[16:22] word
[16:24] for the day that we live in the same
[16:27] that jesus did the same that
[16:29] any believer down through the ages has
[16:32] had
[16:33] that power to remit sin by simply
[16:35] presenting the living word for that day
[16:38] so that power to remit sin did not cease
[16:40] in our age or it did not cease when
[16:42] jesus corporal body went off the sin
[16:44] or off the scene but the power to remit
[16:47] sin
[16:48] was even prior to that because there was
[16:50] believers that were
[16:51] that was presenting the living word for
[16:53] their day
[16:54] and as such was remembering sin to other
[16:56] individuals who would accept that
[16:58] so that truth and that power just
[17:01] doesn't go away
[17:02] with the corporal body leaving the scene
[17:06] we learned that brother branham taught
[17:07] us that all hell
[17:10] not just a small portion of it but all
[17:13] hell is against the revelation of christ
[17:17] to the individual all
[17:20] hell is not against the revelation of
[17:23] christ
[17:23] to the prophet all hell is not against
[17:27] the revelation of christ
[17:28] to your neighbor all hell is against the
[17:31] revelation of christ
[17:33] to you that's what we're concerned about
[17:37] we learned that the spirit of truth says
[17:40] jesus christ
[17:41] is come in the flesh which is why
[17:45] all hell is against the revelation of
[17:47] christ to the individual
[17:49] and we learned that the true bride
[17:51] doctrine
[17:53] is the spiritual bride is the word made
[17:56] flesh and blood again
[17:59] and brother branham says that anything
[18:00] opposes that
[18:02] is antichrist because anything that
[18:05] would oppose the true bright doctrine
[18:08] of jesus christ being made flesh again
[18:11] in the power of his word
[18:13] living and breathing in me and you is of
[18:16] the antichrist
[18:18] it opposes that jesus christ is
[18:21] come in the flesh and then i would say
[18:24] possibly the most
[18:26] important thing that we learned was that
[18:28] the antichrist frame
[18:29] the antichrist spirit within the
[18:31] framework of the church
[18:34] is not as far off as what we thought
[18:37] and that it's actually what we carry
[18:39] around with us each and every day in our
[18:41] hybrid spirit
[18:42] and our hybrid flesh combating and
[18:45] consistently conflicting
[18:47] with the seed the word that is trying to
[18:50] emit from our soul
[18:52] and we have to recognize that first
[18:55] and we can't put that anywhere else
[18:58] we have to recognize that that is the
[19:00] most important thing to recognize as
[19:02] she's saying
[19:03] that is the most important thing to
[19:04] recognize because in
[19:06] if you don't recognize that if i don't
[19:08] recognize that brother branham says that
[19:10] we will never be able to have the power
[19:12] to do the greater works
[19:14] because he says the power to do the
[19:16] greater works laid
[19:18] on that revelation to discern the
[19:21] antichrist spirit within
[19:23] the framework of the christian church if
[19:26] we're the christian church if we're the
[19:29] framework of the christian church
[19:31] we have to discern that within ourselves
[19:34] can we say amen so let's go to john 5.
[19:42] i know some of you are probably
[19:43] wondering how i just covered all of that
[19:45] in five minutes but yet it took me over
[19:47] two hours last time
[19:48] but brother brother
[19:52] chad was preaching at the beginning of
[19:53] the year that he wanted to be a farmer
[19:55] this year and that was his kind of
[19:57] vision that we should take on the spirit
[19:58] of a farmer
[19:59] and i thought that's good but you know
[20:02] some farmers are slower than others
[20:04] you know some plant with uh high-powered
[20:07] machinery
[20:08] and they go really fast and they have
[20:12] gps devices on their machines to tell
[20:14] them exactly how fast to go and what to
[20:17] do
[20:17] and then some are just out there with a
[20:19] hand plow so he didn't say which we
[20:21] should be
[20:22] so i'll let you decide which i was
[20:26] john 5 verse 5
[20:29] as we would look to maybe
[20:34] see some of these other things that
[20:36] jesus said to cause the shuck to pull
[20:38] away
[20:41] and a certain man was there this is at
[20:42] the pool of bethesda we won't take time
[20:44] to read the first part of it this is at
[20:46] the pool of bethesda were very familiar
[20:47] with this
[20:48] and a certain man was there which had an
[20:50] infirmity
[20:51] 30 and eight years when jesus saw him
[20:54] lie
[20:55] and knew that he had been there a long
[20:57] time in that case he saith unto him
[21:00] wilt thou be made whole
[21:04] simple question right severe
[21:07] implications
[21:08] because jesus has come along and he says
[21:10] wilt thou be made whole
[21:12] that implies that he has the power to
[21:14] make him whole
[21:18] the impotent man answered him sir i have
[21:20] no man when the water is troubled to put
[21:21] me into the pool but while i am coming
[21:23] another step
[21:24] down before me jesus saith unto him
[21:28] rise take up thy bed and walk
[21:31] and immediately the man was made whole
[21:33] and took up his bed and walked
[21:36] and on the same day was the sabbath
[21:40] the jews therefore said unto him that
[21:42] was cured it is the sabbath
[21:44] day it is not lawful for thee to carry
[21:47] thy bed
[21:49] he answered them he that made me whole
[21:51] the same said unto me take up thy bed
[21:53] and walk
[21:54] then they ask him what man is that
[21:57] which said unto thee take up thy bed and
[21:59] walk and he that was healed with not who
[22:02] it was for jesus had conveyed himself
[22:04] away
[22:05] the multitude being in that place
[22:08] afterward jesus fined him in the temple
[22:11] and said unto him behold thou art made
[22:15] whole
[22:16] sin no more lest the worst thing come
[22:19] upon thee
[22:20] the man departed and told the jews that
[22:23] it was jesus
[22:24] which had made him whole and therefore
[22:26] did the jews persecute jesus
[22:28] and sought to slay him because he had
[22:31] done these things on the sabbath day
[22:33] but jesus answered them
[22:37] not what they wanted to hear
[22:40] my father worketh hitherto
[22:45] and i work therefore the jews sought the
[22:49] more to kill him because he
[22:50] not only had broken the sabbath but said
[22:53] also that god was his father
[22:56] making himself equal with god
[23:02] this revelation that we're preaching
[23:05] is not a new revelation saints it's not
[23:07] a new understanding
[23:08] what has happened is this understanding
[23:10] has been obscured for thousands of years
[23:15] but even the religious sect in that day
[23:18] who was not walking
[23:19] in the light for their age recognize
[23:21] that this man came on the scene
[23:23] and said that i'm doing the works of my
[23:25] father my father is working and i'm
[23:27] working with him
[23:29] they recognize the fact that he said
[23:31] that god was his father
[23:32] what that made him
[23:36] they didn't even have to sit down and
[23:37] study this out or contemplate this
[23:40] it says immediately immediately they
[23:43] took issue with this
[23:45] so just because just because
[23:49] ages have went by and years have went by
[23:52] and this revelation and this
[23:53] understanding
[23:54] has been withdrawn and taken from even
[23:56] what we would call the nominal christian
[23:58] church or the nominal world
[23:59] that does not make it a radical idea now
[24:03] it's not a radical idea just because a
[24:06] layer is pulled off of something and
[24:08] exposed for what it was back
[24:09] two thousand years ago two thousand
[24:11] years ago you could say this and they
[24:13] didn't have a problem with it
[24:15] they understood that god that the the
[24:17] son that would come forth from god the
[24:19] messiah that would come forth from god
[24:21] would be god the problem they had is
[24:23] when he said he was that
[24:27] now two thousand years later they can't
[24:30] even accept the fact that the father
[24:32] and the son is the same thing let alone
[24:33] the fact that you are you or she
[24:36] and that she is he
[24:39] that's radical that's unacceptable kill
[24:41] that with some stones
[24:44] but i want to back up because i don't
[24:46] want to go too fast through this chapter
[24:48] because there were some really there
[24:50] were some things that stuck out here to
[24:51] me
[24:52] in verse 6 jesus comes and he asks a
[24:54] question
[24:55] he comes and he asks a question will
[24:57] thou be made whole
[24:59] and as i said before this implies that
[25:01] he has the power to do what he's asking
[25:03] and he's asking the question will that
[25:05] me be made whole
[25:06] meaning i have the power to make you
[25:08] whole if you want to be whole
[25:11] he did not ask him do you want me to
[25:14] help you
[25:15] do you want me to give you a book do you
[25:16] want me to get somebody else that will
[25:18] help you
[25:20] he says wilt thou be made whole
[25:23] the man answered sir i have no man when
[25:25] the water is troubled to put me into the
[25:27] pool but while i am coming another step
[25:29] down before me jesus said unto him rise
[25:33] take up thy bed and walk and immediately
[25:35] the man was made whole and took up his
[25:37] bed and walked and on the same day was
[25:39] the sabbath
[25:40] the jews therefore said unto him that
[25:42] was cured watch the question that they
[25:44] asked him
[25:46] the jews therefore said unto him that
[25:48] was cured it is the sabbath day
[25:50] it is not lawful for thee to carry thy
[25:52] bed
[25:55] he answered them he that made me hold
[25:56] the same said unto me take up thy bed
[25:58] and walk
[25:59] then they asked him what man
[26:02] is it that which said unto thee take up
[26:05] thy bed and walk
[26:09] as we're reading this it's so easy just
[26:11] to read through this and not catch this
[26:13] but when i read this i ponder
[26:17] here is a man that has laid in the bed
[26:19] for 38 years
[26:21] and there's now a man who has came along
[26:24] with the power to say take up thy bed
[26:26] and walk
[26:28] and instead of asking who is the man
[26:32] that made you
[26:33] whole they said who is the man that told
[26:36] you to carry your bad on
[26:38] bed on the sabbath day
[26:43] i mean i've been accused of being
[26:45] legalistic but
[26:46] i mean this is a whole other level
[26:50] of all things this i mean
[26:53] do we understand the fact pattern here
[26:56] this man's laid here for 38 years
[26:58] he's been made whole and the only thing
[27:00] that they can think to ask him
[27:02] is who's told you to come and bust up
[27:04] our denominational thinking
[27:07] who has told you to come and throw a
[27:10] wrench into our tradition
[27:11] our traditional sunday service
[27:15] who has who has asked who has told you
[27:18] to do these things
[27:22] not wilt now who has told you and made
[27:25] you whole
[27:27] they won't ask you that they want to
[27:28] know who's disturbing things
[27:30] who is threatening our position who is
[27:33] going to put us
[27:34] out of a job if this be so i'm not
[27:37] concerned that you've been made whole
[27:38] what i'm concerned about is my self
[27:40] security
[27:42] and how many how many in here can relate
[27:46] to that when the message of the hour
[27:48] came your way
[27:49] [Music]
[27:51] the people that you thought well
[27:53] everybody will see this
[27:55] everybody will love this will
[27:58] will thou be made whole you're just
[28:00] chucking that out to everybody
[28:02] you come to will thou be made whole like
[28:03] i've been made whole well that'll be
[28:05] made whole like
[28:06] like i've been made home and they've
[28:07] known you
[28:09] they've known me and they've known that
[28:11] you've laid there and putin
[28:13] for 38 years maybe not 38 years you put
[28:15] your own number in there
[28:17] but of all things they just can't seem
[28:21] to ask
[28:21] how is it that you have been made whole
[28:24] they want to know
[28:25] why are you trying to cause this
[28:28] confliction in my life by presenting
[28:30] this cult to me
[28:31] by presenting this false doctrine to me
[28:33] what what is your problem
[28:35] where are these radical who has told you
[28:38] this
[28:39] who has told you to come and disturb my
[28:41] traditional sunday plans
[28:47] they don't say yes please make me whole
[28:50] they want to know who is causing this
[28:52] disturbance
[28:54] why are you doing this to me see
[28:58] if we can't discern the spirits within
[29:01] the framework of the christian church
[29:03] we will so easily be caught into that
[29:06] because the question they asked they had
[29:08] scripture for
[29:10] the question they asked was not a what
[29:12] we would say a wrong question it was a
[29:14] very scriptural question
[29:16] the problem was they missed the point
[29:19] this is a man who had been laying in
[29:22] false teaching for years this is a man
[29:25] that had been stuck in the
[29:26] denominational system for years
[29:29] you say that's not what the scripture
[29:30] says well just follow me
[29:32] just follow me i'm not talking about
[29:34] that man anymore
[29:36] this is somebody who is laid under false
[29:38] doctrine and denominational teaching and
[29:40] denominational understanding
[29:42] i'll even bring it closer they have laid
[29:44] under their own
[29:45] understanding for 38 years and now comes
[29:48] along a message that says
[29:50] wilt thou be made whole and our hybrid
[29:53] carnal spirit the only thing that it can
[29:55] think to do
[29:56] when this comes along is not say yes i
[29:59] want to be made whole
[30:00] the only thing it can do is say who's
[30:01] saying that who is telling you to break
[30:04] this tradition of your own thinking
[30:07] this is not acceptable i must kill this
[30:09] with stones of my own revelation
[30:12] of my own hybrid revelation i i cannot
[30:14] let you be whole
[30:16] no it would never obviously utter that
[30:19] that i
[30:20] i mean the scribes and the pharisees
[30:21] they obviously wouldn't come to that man
[30:23] and say well
[30:23] we do not want you to be made whole
[30:26] but what are they really saying who is
[30:30] this that's told you to carry your bed
[30:32] on the sabbath day
[30:34] you you cannot do that that's radical
[30:37] that clearly breaks the law
[30:42] wrong question to ask
[30:46] wrong motivation
[30:52] don't think that spirit's dead
[30:56] we pack it around with us each and every
[30:57] day
[31:03] what man is it that said unto thee take
[31:05] up thy bed and walk
[31:08] and he that was healed with not who it
[31:10] was
[31:11] for jesus has conveyed himself away a
[31:13] multitude being in that place
[31:15] how many can relate to this you have a
[31:17] revelation come
[31:19] strike in your heart and you start
[31:22] declaring that
[31:24] then people will question that
[31:25] revelation
[31:28] and your answer to them is i don't know
[31:35] i don't know where that's found in the
[31:36] message i don't know where it's found in
[31:38] the scriptures all i know is i'm whole
[31:45] same position this man was in
[31:50] i don't know where to find i don't know
[31:51] i can't tie it all together i can't
[31:53] explain to you how i see all these
[31:55] things you know what i
[31:56] don't know how i was back there and i
[31:58] fought a battle in heaven
[32:00] already and i resisted the devil's lie
[32:01] and kicked him out i don't know how i
[32:03] already won that battle
[32:04] but i know i did i don't know how i can
[32:08] tie that through all the scriptures how
[32:10] i can talk
[32:10] how to tie that all through the message
[32:13] but i know it's true
[32:16] but we've believed that for years and
[32:19] now
[32:20] the same thing that happened to this man
[32:22] because we have believed something
[32:24] happens to us watch what happens
[32:27] afterward jesus findeth him in the
[32:29] temple and said unto him behold thou art
[32:31] made whole sin no more
[32:33] lest the worst thing come upon thee the
[32:36] man departed
[32:37] and told the jews that it was jesus now
[32:40] jesus will drop this revelation into our
[32:42] heart and he'll expect us to accept that
[32:45] he'll expect us to walk in that even
[32:47] when he doesn't give us all the pieces
[32:48] to put together
[32:49] even when we can explain to somebody
[32:52] else he'll expect us to believe that
[32:55] but if and when you do he will
[32:58] always come back on the scene and reveal
[33:01] to you
[33:02] this was jesus this is jesus christ come
[33:06] in the flesh
[33:06] and this is where you can find it
[33:10] he will always do that
[33:15] same thing that he did with this man so
[33:17] don't be afraid just because you can't
[33:19] put all the puzzle pieces together
[33:21] and just because you can't go and run a
[33:24] quote a list of quotes and a list of
[33:26] scriptures and tie everything together
[33:27] in a nice little box
[33:29] don't be afraid don't resist the spirit
[33:33] of revelation
[33:36] don't resist the spirit of revelation
[33:40] allow it to come allow it to be true
[33:48] if there is something
[33:52] that god is trying to get to you
[33:57] i'm going to say 9 times out of 10
[33:59] probably more
[34:01] it is going to come in opposition of
[34:04] your hybrid spirit
[34:07] so if god is pricking your heart to
[34:09] something
[34:10] or he's pricking your mind to something
[34:13] and he's
[34:13] trying to draw your attention to
[34:15] something and your hybrid spirit is
[34:17] resisting that
[34:21] i would say pay very close attention to
[34:23] that
[34:26] don't resist that allow it to be true
[34:29] i'm not saying go and just believe
[34:32] anything we know we know better than
[34:34] that
[34:34] check it by the word but what i'm saying
[34:36] is if god has dropped something in your
[34:38] heart and you don't see anything in the
[34:40] word that is contrary to that
[34:43] don't discount that allow
[34:46] god to come back into the temple later
[34:50] and reveal himself to you don't be
[34:52] afraid to stand on that don't be afraid
[34:54] to declare that
[34:55] now obviously if something drops into
[34:57] your heart and there's a word contrary
[34:58] to it then don't believe it
[35:00] we know that we're taught we're taught
[35:02] better than that
[35:04] but i would i would say most of the time
[35:08] in my life in your life and through the
[35:10] scriptures most of the time
[35:12] a significant spiritual revelation
[35:16] comes prior to a proper understanding of
[35:19] being able to
[35:21] being able to tie it together in the
[35:22] word and in the message
[35:24] it will it will come as brother brahm
[35:27] says it comes tumbling down through a
[35:29] mystical channel
[35:30] [Music]
[35:33] brother don't get hung up on this saints
[35:35] because
[35:36] this is the scare tactic of the devil
[35:40] if the devil can keep you from receiving
[35:43] revelation
[35:44] he's got you if you're scared to receive
[35:46] revelation he's got you
[35:48] if you're if you're scared to receive
[35:51] something from god
[35:52] before you read it in a message book or
[35:54] before you read it in a scripture you've
[35:55] got a problem
[35:58] and i know that's really straightforward
[36:00] and i know that's
[36:01] uh it's scary to the devil
[36:04] but brother brandon said the same thing
[36:06] happened to him he says i'll be out in
[36:08] the woods
[36:08] and the thought will strike me
[36:13] then he says then i take that thought
[36:15] and i go back to the word
[36:17] and i run it through the scriptures and
[36:18] i make sure it's in the scriptures and i
[36:20] make sure
[36:20] he says when he saw a vision he says
[36:24] i'll see that vision
[36:26] and then i'll take it back to the word
[36:27] and i'll run it through the word you
[36:28] tell me which is coming first
[36:31] brother random's not sitting here
[36:32] reading his bible now we know revelation
[36:34] comes that way
[36:35] obviously we know revelation comes that
[36:36] way by
[36:38] reading by physically reading the
[36:40] message by physically reading
[36:42] our bibles we know that that's a primary
[36:45] source of god
[36:46] revealing himself to us but it's
[36:50] it's so important that we be able to
[36:52] receive
[36:54] revelation through that mystical channel
[36:57] because we have to be able to bypass our
[37:00] hybrid spirit and our hybrid mind
[37:02] and like i said that happened with
[37:04] brother branham all the time
[37:05] he says i will i'll be out in the woods
[37:07] i'll be walking along i'll be doing
[37:09] whatever i'll be mowing the grass
[37:10] and a and a thought will strike me
[37:12] revelation will hit
[37:15] and i receive that but then i go track
[37:17] down in the word
[37:18] so there's nothing wrong with tracking
[37:20] it down in the word there's nothing
[37:21] wrong with
[37:22] with wanting to put the pieces together
[37:24] wanting to put the quotes together
[37:25] wanting to put the scriptures together
[37:27] we should do that but we cannot be
[37:31] scared of revelation
[37:33] we can not be afraid of the spirit of
[37:36] revelation
[37:37] speaking into our lives coming
[37:41] and asking the question will thou be
[37:43] made whole
[37:47] the man did not give jesus
[37:52] 21 questions of well
[37:55] yeah but how well yeah i'd like to be
[37:59] made whole but
[38:00] who's going to do it yeah i would like
[38:03] to
[38:04] but are you are you trying to say you
[38:06] have the power to do that
[38:09] jesus came along and he says without
[38:10] being made whole he just simply said yes
[38:12] but i don't have any man to put me in
[38:13] the pool
[38:14] that was all the understanding that he
[38:16] had right then
[38:18] that was all the understanding that he
[38:20] had was i've got to get into that pool
[38:22] and it wasn't a wrong understanding but
[38:25] before
[38:26] he even knew who jesus was he somehow
[38:29] comes in contact with a revelation that
[38:32] this man has the power to make me whole
[38:34] jesus says take up thy bed and walk
[38:38] and there is something that comes to
[38:40] this man
[38:42] that gives him the faith to do what it's
[38:45] told him
[38:47] prior to knowing who jesus is
[38:55] will thou be made whole or do you have
[38:58] to understand everything first
[39:01] will you allow him to make you whole
[39:03] this morning or are you going to wait
[39:05] until you can track everything down and
[39:07] put it in a nice little box
[39:08] allow him to make you whole saints if
[39:11] you allow him to make you whole he
[39:13] will come back into the temple and show
[39:14] you himself
[39:16] he is not going to leave you out on some
[39:18] wild tangent out in left field with no
[39:19] scriptures and no quotes to support your
[39:21] belief
[39:22] it's not going to happen but he wants
[39:25] you to step
[39:25] out in faith he wants you to step out in
[39:28] the spirit of revelation
[39:29] brother branham said in the church age
[39:32] book
[39:32] he says that was the first mistake the
[39:34] ephesians church made
[39:35] he says they stopped reaching out in the
[39:40] spirit
[39:44] so i'm not crazy for saying those things
[39:46] saints i'm not just making it up
[39:48] i can feel the tension surrounding that
[39:50] because we are we are so
[39:52] trained in denominational thinking that
[39:54] luther came i've got to say what luther
[39:56] said wesley came i got to say what
[39:58] wesley said
[39:59] brother branham came i just got to say
[40:00] what the tapes say
[40:02] that's true but you can say what the
[40:05] tapes say and never say what the tapes
[40:06] say
[40:07] without the spirit of revelation we have
[40:10] to receive the spirit of revelation
[40:12] and again i would always back that up
[40:14] with i am not about to support something
[40:16] that the scriptures does not say this
[40:18] and something the message does not say
[40:20] if you have a divine revelation you're
[40:22] going to be able to find it in the
[40:24] scriptures and in the message
[40:28] don't resist the spirit of revelation
[40:30] that's all that i'm saying
[40:31] don't resist the manifestation of the
[40:35] word in your age that will come along
[40:37] and say wilt thou be made whole
[40:40] he'll bring the proper understanding he
[40:42] will show you where to find that at
[40:46] let him make you whole let him come back
[40:48] to the temple and say
[40:50] this is that i am he
[40:53] go in sin no more the man departed and
[40:57] told the jews that it was jesus
[41:00] which had made him whole and therefore
[41:02] did the jews persecute jesus and sought
[41:04] to slay him
[41:05] because he had done these things on the
[41:07] sabbath day
[41:11] starting in verse 17 but jesus answered
[41:15] them
[41:17] my father worketh hitherto and i work
[41:20] therefore the jews sought the more to
[41:22] kill him because he not only had broken
[41:24] the sabbath
[41:25] but said also that god was his father
[41:27] making himself equal with god
[41:30] then answered jesus and said unto them
[41:32] verily verily
[41:33] i say unto you just relax
[41:37] i didn't mean it it's okay
[41:41] maybe i was a little bit too aggressive
[41:46] oh no he pulled poured fuel in the fire
[41:50] then answered jesus and said unto them
[41:52] verily verily i say unto you the son can
[41:54] do nothing of himself but what he seeth
[41:56] the father do
[41:57] for whatsoever he doeth these things
[42:00] also do with the son likewise
[42:02] for the father loveth the son and
[42:05] showeth him all things that himself
[42:06] doeth
[42:08] and he will show him greater works than
[42:10] these that ye may marvel
[42:12] for as the father raiseth up the dead
[42:14] and quickeneth them
[42:16] even so the son quickeneth whom he will
[42:23] i mean he's not pulling punches with
[42:24] them saints
[42:26] he's basically said you didn't like me
[42:27] saying that i and my father are one by
[42:29] the way i do everything that my father
[42:31] shows me to do
[42:32] i quit him just like my father quickens
[42:36] he's not backing up on that revelation
[42:39] he just continues to say the same thing
[42:41] different ways
[42:46] for the father judgeth no man but hath
[42:48] committed all judgment unto the son
[42:51] that all men should honor the son even
[42:54] as they honor the father
[42:56] he that honoreth not the son
[42:59] honoreth not the father which hath sent
[43:01] him
[43:08] don't leave this 2000 years ago
[43:12] this saying is still true today
[43:16] remember brother graham says when you
[43:18] come to say i and the father are one
[43:21] and these other things the shock will
[43:24] pull away
[43:27] can we come and can we say my father
[43:29] worketh and i
[43:30] my father worketh hitherto and i worketh
[43:36] can we say that what reaction do we
[43:40] think we're going to get
[43:41] you're doing
[43:44] god's work god's using
[43:48] you to fulfill scriptures
[43:54] what reaction do we think we're going to
[43:55] get
[43:58] don't back up on that revelation just do
[44:00] what jesus did
[44:02] verily verily i say unto you the father
[44:05] does not does verily verily i send you
[44:08] the son
[44:08] i can do nothing i can do nothing except
[44:11] for
[44:12] accept the father show with me
[44:15] you mean you have commun direct
[44:17] communication with god
[44:21] brother branham says that jesus didn't
[44:24] do
[44:24] anything until god first showed him a
[44:26] vision
[44:27] he says he walked along god would show
[44:29] him a vision he would go and do it
[44:31] he said he never did any miracles
[44:34] without first
[44:34] god showing him a vision you say well i
[44:37] can't work like that because i don't see
[44:39] visions
[44:42] we've seen a vision saints the scripture
[44:46] says where there's no vision the people
[44:47] perish
[44:48] we've had a prophet come in this day
[44:52] to reveal the entire vision
[44:55] to reveal the entire scriptures
[44:58] we don't need to have our subconscious
[45:01] and our conscience start changing realms
[45:02] and going back and forth to see the
[45:04] vision that we should walk in
[45:06] because we've had the scriptures and now
[45:09] christ will come
[45:10] and he will show us in the vision in the
[45:13] word
[45:14] what our work is to do so now we can
[45:17] come and we can declare the very same
[45:19] thing that i do
[45:20] nothing i do nothing except the father's
[45:23] show with me
[45:25] you say well i didn't see a vision did
[45:27] you see it in the word
[45:29] it's the same thing saints division is
[45:31] the word
[45:32] where there is no open word the people
[45:35] perish
[45:35] where there is no open vision the people
[45:37] perish if you have an open vision you
[45:40] have an open word
[45:41] if you are trying to do what the father
[45:44] would do
[45:45] the father is not going to do anything
[45:47] but what's in the vision what's in the
[45:48] word
[45:49] so if the entire word has been opened to
[45:51] us
[45:52] how can we not declare i do only that
[45:56] which the father doeth
[45:57] i i do nothing unless he shows me first
[46:02] now if you're in worldly entertainment
[46:04] and you're in worldly uh
[46:05] worldly uh sin and you're doing things
[46:09] as the scripture says he that loveth the
[46:11] world the love of god's not even in him
[46:14] if you are involved in those things then
[46:16] don't try to make that statement
[46:18] but you had the opportunity to be able
[46:20] to make that statement
[46:22] and we should the scripture says
[46:24] everything that you do
[46:25] do in the name of jesus christ
[46:28] how how is it any difference to say any
[46:31] different to say
[46:32] i don't do anything unless the father
[46:34] shall with me
[46:36] that's sanctification on a whole other
[46:38] level saints
[46:39] see if you catch that revelation
[46:43] you don't even have to deal with
[46:44] sanctification anymore
[46:46] because it all goes into that it's all
[46:49] included in that
[46:50] if you catch the revelation that i and
[46:52] my father are one
[46:55] and i will not allow my hybrid spirit or
[46:58] my hybrid flesh to do anything except
[47:00] for what he show with me in the word
[47:05] you don't have to go back and be like
[47:09] i don't know if this skirt is too if
[47:11] it's long enough i got to get my tape
[47:13] measure
[47:14] i don't know if my hair is long enough
[47:15] let's measure it i
[47:17] i don't know if i should tell this this
[47:19] collar off collar joke
[47:22] you see what i'm saying saints you don't
[47:24] have to
[47:26] you don't have to press sanctification
[47:28] into yourself
[47:29] the scripture says we're sanctified by
[47:31] the word of god
[47:34] if the word of god is closed to you
[47:37] it is impossible for you to live a
[47:39] sanctified life in the age that you're
[47:41] living in
[47:43] but if the word of god is open to you
[47:47] if the vision is open and you're walking
[47:50] in the vision that the father has given
[47:52] you
[47:53] of what he would do sanctification is
[47:56] not an issue
[47:58] because the father is not going to show
[48:00] you to go do
[48:01] something that's not holy that would
[48:04] mar your sanctification as a christian
[48:08] one is it's at a higher level saints
[48:11] let's get out of a wesleyan age of
[48:13] trying to sanctify ourselves
[48:15] and allow the open vision the open word
[48:18] let's just do what the father show with
[48:20] us to do in the word
[48:23] it will take care of itself
[48:27] that all men should honor the son even
[48:29] as they are to honor
[48:30] the father he that honoreth not the son
[48:34] on earth not the father which has sent
[48:36] him
[48:40] moving into verse 24
[48:44] john 5 24 jesus said verily verily i say
[48:48] unto you
[48:49] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[48:53] him that sent me
[48:54] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[48:57] into condemnation condemnation
[48:59] but is passed from death unto life
[49:03] that's a bold statement
[49:06] that's a statement that we're supposed
[49:07] to make to cause the shock to pull away
[49:16] think of the implications of that saints
[49:21] verily verily i say unto you
[49:25] he that heareth my words
[49:29] and believeth on him that sent me
[49:34] hath everlasting life
[49:38] oh you mean jesus yes
[49:44] oh you mean you're jesus yes
[49:51] brother random says when you begin to
[49:53] say i and the father are one
[49:55] and these other things meaning he is
[49:58] giving us permission to say these other
[50:00] things
[50:01] if he wasn't giving us permission to say
[50:03] these other things i would be dares
[50:05] to even think these other things let
[50:07] alone put them on a hybrid
[50:09] corrupt tongue and say them let alone
[50:11] say them before the very purchased
[50:13] purchased product of the blood of jesus
[50:15] christ
[50:18] but let's back up a verse 23
[50:21] that all men should under honor the son
[50:23] even as they honor the father he that
[50:26] honoreth not the son on earth not the
[50:28] father which has sent
[50:29] him so now if we refuse to say
[50:33] what he that has been sent to us has
[50:35] told us to say
[50:37] we have automatically rejected what the
[50:39] father wants us to do
[50:45] i would rather be declared a radical
[50:47] than i would be
[50:48] declared and know that i'm not saying
[50:52] what the prophet of god has told me to
[50:54] say
[50:56] and as such i'm resisting that message
[50:59] and i'm resisting what he's told me to
[51:01] say and because my hybrid spirit my
[51:04] hybrid flesh is in constant battle with
[51:06] that
[51:06] i just can't seem to to break through
[51:08] and to utter those words
[51:11] if you refuse him that the father has
[51:14] sent you have refused the father
[51:20] when you come to say i and the father
[51:24] are one
[51:25] and these other things verily verily
[51:29] i say unto you unless you
[51:32] he that heareth my word
[51:36] and believeth on him that sent me
[51:40] hath everlasting life
[51:44] i wouldn't recommend saying that if you
[51:48] don't know
[51:49] who it is that sent you if you're not
[51:52] comfortable with that revelation
[51:53] that you come from god and you go back
[51:55] to god and that he has sent you to carry
[51:57] out and fulfill
[51:58] and finish his work here on earth today
[52:00] you probably shouldn't say that
[52:03] but if you do have that understanding
[52:06] and you do have that knowledge and you
[52:08] do have that revelation
[52:10] why back up on what the prophets told us
[52:12] to say
[52:15] verily verily i say unto you
[52:18] he that heareth my words
[52:22] so let's break that down a little bit
[52:24] you say well you can say anything that's
[52:26] true i can
[52:27] and it's utterly worthless utterly
[52:30] worthless it's just my opinion
[52:33] unless i am the final voice
[52:37] to the final age which is under the
[52:40] correct messenger
[52:41] and saying what the correct messenger
[52:42] said
[52:45] you say well that's not your words
[52:47] anymore then you're right
[52:49] it wasn't jesus's words either
[52:51] [Applause]
[52:53] see what we're saying saints
[52:55] [Music]
[52:57] we have got to get away from the pagan
[52:59] idea that we are somehow different than
[53:01] god
[53:02] we have got to get away from the pagan
[53:04] idea that the bride of jesus christ is
[53:07] somehow not flesh of his flesh and bone
[53:09] of his bone
[53:10] that somehow when she speaks it's
[53:11] different than god speaking because it's
[53:14] the same spirit and the same principle
[53:16] that would want to differentiate the
[53:18] words of jesus from that of his father
[53:21] if that's true this is true
[53:26] regardless of what your hybrid spirit
[53:28] says
[53:31] it's irrelevant your hybrid spirit will
[53:34] never agree just face it your hybrid
[53:36] spirit will never agree with that which
[53:38] the father saith
[53:40] we'll get to that here in just a little
[53:41] bit it will never do it saints
[53:44] but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't
[53:46] declare it that doesn't mean that it's
[53:47] not true
[53:48] we don't have to bypass and check
[53:51] everything through our hybrid spirit to
[53:52] make sure that it's okay to declare
[53:54] we have to see the vision that the
[53:56] father is showing us and declare that
[53:58] vision
[53:59] from our soul from the sea gene within
[54:02] from our heart whatever terminology you
[54:04] want to put on it as paul said from the
[54:05] inner man
[54:06] who is in constant war with the outer
[54:08] man
[54:11] verily verily i say unto you
[54:15] he that heareth my words
[54:18] as they line up with the revealed
[54:20] messenger for my age
[54:25] which makes me the voice to the final
[54:28] age
[54:29] which makes you the voice to the final
[54:31] age
[54:32] he that heareth my words and believeth
[54:35] on him that sent me
[54:39] hath everlasting life you say that's
[54:43] radical that's too extreme we can't go
[54:46] there
[54:47] i'll just leave you with one question if
[54:50] this
[54:50] isn't true
[54:54] if there are people in sin and there are
[54:56] people in darkness and there are people
[54:58] that are needing to be set free
[55:00] can we agree with that can we agree that
[55:02] there are people that are
[55:04] lost that needs life that needs to be
[55:06] found
[55:09] if you will find me another voice that
[55:12] can set them free then i will back up on
[55:14] this revelation
[55:17] but until you can find me another voice
[55:21] under a correct messenger making them
[55:23] the final voice for the final age
[55:25] like it or not you're stuck with that
[55:27] responsibility
[55:29] and you say well i i cannot live a life
[55:33] i cannot live a life to where i can look
[55:34] my co-worker in the eye and declare to
[55:36] them unless you believe the words i
[55:37] speak to you
[55:39] you will die and be lost you are lost
[55:41] and you will die in your sins
[55:44] unless you believe the words that i
[55:45] speak unto you you will not have
[55:47] everlasting life
[55:50] and your hybrid spirit will tell you
[55:51] that's correct you can't live that life
[55:53] and you know what that's the only thing
[55:54] that it'll ever say that's true
[55:57] i take that back it can say one thing
[55:59] that's true
[56:00] you will never live that life you are
[56:02] incapable of living that life that is
[56:04] true
[56:06] but he that has sent you has made you
[56:08] more than able
[56:09] the word that has come has made us more
[56:12] than able
[56:13] more than conquerors more to come to a
[56:17] point of revelation and a proper
[56:20] understanding
[56:22] to understand i have to declare those
[56:24] things
[56:27] and if we just if we would take the time
[56:29] and as i said
[56:30] i'm trying to slow down i want to go
[56:32] slow because i want to think about these
[56:34] things
[56:35] we've heard these preached for months
[56:37] and years now there's no disputing that
[56:39] this is not new but i want to
[56:42] stop and think about this saints not let
[56:46] it just go in one ear not the other and
[56:47] over the head
[56:50] but there are so many things that we
[56:53] have to say are not
[56:56] true that we know to be true
[56:59] in order not to say this if
[57:02] we can't say this by default we have to
[57:06] say that the message of the hour is not
[57:08] correct
[57:11] because if we can't say this that means
[57:14] that there's another
[57:16] option besides the message of the hour
[57:20] and there's somebody else speaking that
[57:22] other option and instead of saying
[57:25] verily verily i say unto you he that
[57:27] heareth my word
[57:28] and believeth on him that sent me we
[57:30] would have to declare
[57:32] he that he that hears this other
[57:35] person's word
[57:36] and believe on him that sent him
[57:42] see we think oh well we'll just be
[57:44] humble we won't say that we
[57:46] can't say that that's too bold that's
[57:48] too radical
[57:49] but see saints when we do that there's
[57:51] implications that way as well
[57:53] because if we can't say this we are by
[57:57] default saying that there's another way
[57:58] to life besides the revealed word of the
[58:00] age
[58:02] as declared through the vindicated
[58:03] prophet for this age william brother
[58:05] brother raynham
[58:08] see that's what i say we've got to think
[58:10] about these things
[58:12] we have to under understand the
[58:14] implications one way and the other way
[58:16] it's not just good there's bad to it as
[58:18] well because you remember the scripture
[58:20] says
[58:21] he that will add to or take away
[58:24] from this book his part will be taken
[58:26] out of the book of life
[58:34] that does not mean if i take this bible
[58:38] and a pen and scratch out a word right
[58:40] here that i'm lost
[58:43] or that if i take a pen and i write an
[58:45] extra word in here
[58:47] that i'm lost what that means
[58:50] is if you or me fail
[58:53] to declare the same revelation that this
[58:56] declares
[58:57] your part will be taken out of the book
[59:00] of life
[59:05] now let's go back to this scripture and
[59:07] put it in context
[59:08] verily verily i say unto you he that
[59:11] heareth my word and believeth on him
[59:13] that sent me
[59:15] hath everlasting life why
[59:18] is it that they would get everlasting
[59:21] life
[59:22] is because you're not backing up on the
[59:25] revelation of the book
[59:27] of life
[59:31] and you are not declaring to them that
[59:35] they have to come to you and
[59:38] worship you in your hybrid condition and
[59:42] get
[59:42] words of life from you you are simply
[59:45] stating
[59:46] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[59:48] him that sent me
[59:50] hath everlasting life you are simply
[59:53] saying that you have been a partaker
[59:56] of that life and now as being a partaker
[59:59] of that life
[1:00:00] by default all through the scriptures it
[1:00:03] makes
[1:00:03] it makes you and puts you into a
[1:00:06] position
[1:00:06] to disperse that life
[1:00:10] that was jesus's purpose was it not
[1:00:14] he said unless a corn of wheat fall into
[1:00:16] the ground it abideth alone
[1:00:18] but if it fall under the ground and die
[1:00:20] it bringeth forth much fruit
[1:00:23] what fruit what is fruit fruit is
[1:00:26] life
[1:00:32] verily verily i say unto you
[1:00:36] i have caught a proper revelation
[1:00:39] and understanding of my position in this
[1:00:42] book
[1:00:46] and if you will believe what i am saying
[1:00:49] unto you you can then see your position
[1:00:53] in the book as well
[1:00:55] and when you see your position in the
[1:00:57] book
[1:00:59] you will receive eternal life
[1:01:02] eternal life will be imparted unto you
[1:01:05] you will understand that you have always
[1:01:08] had eternal life
[1:01:12] the shock will pull away from your true
[1:01:15] life
[1:01:16] and then you will start saying things
[1:01:18] like you and the father are one
[1:01:20] and then next thing you know you'll be
[1:01:22] saying to somebody unless you believe
[1:01:24] the revealed word for the hour
[1:01:27] as brought by a vindicated prophet
[1:01:30] you will die in your sin you will die in
[1:01:33] your unbelief
[1:01:36] you say well that's not very palatable
[1:01:38] you know what
[1:01:39] jacob have i loved and esau have i hated
[1:01:41] is not very palatable either
[1:01:49] don't back up on the revelation saints
[1:01:54] like i said if you will find me one
[1:01:56] other option
[1:01:58] besides you and me as the bride of jesus
[1:02:02] christ
[1:02:03] being the final voice to the final age
[1:02:06] under our vindicated messenger
[1:02:08] to disperse truth and to disperse
[1:02:11] life to those that are lost in sin
[1:02:15] if you will find me somebody else
[1:02:18] that has a message of life then i'll
[1:02:21] back up on that revelation
[1:02:23] but until you do i'm not going to back
[1:02:26] up on it
[1:02:27] and i'm going to declare i and my father
[1:02:29] are one and
[1:02:30] he that will hear the words that i speak
[1:02:35] and believe on him that has sent me
[1:02:39] you can have eternal life
[1:02:43] i'm not going to back up on that because
[1:02:46] i know
[1:02:47] if i back up on that i bring
[1:02:50] dishonor to my father and i'm not doing
[1:02:53] what the open vision has declared
[1:02:56] verse 25 verily verily i say unto you
[1:02:59] the hour is coming and now is when the
[1:03:03] dead
[1:03:03] shall hear the voice of the son of god
[1:03:08] and they that hear shall live
[1:03:15] was that 2000 years ago
[1:03:19] or is that still happening if it's
[1:03:22] still happening where's the voice
[1:03:29] and the father himself which hath sent
[1:03:32] me
[1:03:33] hath born witness of me ye have neither
[1:03:36] heard his voice at any time nor
[1:03:40] seen his shape and ye have not his word
[1:03:43] abiding in
[1:03:43] you for whom he hath sent
[1:03:47] him ye believe not you say well i've
[1:03:50] accepted the prophet i accept brother
[1:03:52] branham as the messenger for the age i
[1:03:54] accept that
[1:03:58] this is not that age saints there was a
[1:04:01] wave sheath
[1:04:03] and it had to go into the rest of the
[1:04:05] harvest
[1:04:07] it's not good enough to be the voice for
[1:04:09] a former age
[1:04:10] we have to recognize whom he hath sent
[1:04:14] for this age you say well
[1:04:18] we still say what brother branham says
[1:04:19] yes yes yes
[1:04:21] but chronologically he is not here
[1:04:25] which means he cannot speak
[1:04:30] you understand he is not going to come
[1:04:31] here in a corporal body and
[1:04:33] say these other things so
[1:04:36] what tongue has to utter those
[1:04:41] it gives us no option
[1:04:44] if we if we do not believe in who he has
[1:04:49] sent
[1:04:51] he says my words not abiding in you
[1:04:55] so if we declare that his word
[1:04:58] is abiding in us what does that by
[1:05:01] default mean
[1:05:04] he has sent us don't make it any more
[1:05:07] complicated than what
[1:05:08] it has to be
[1:05:12] back up to verse 37 if he hath
[1:05:15] sent us because his word is abiding in
[1:05:18] us
[1:05:19] verse 37 says and the father himself
[1:05:22] which hath sent me hath borne witness of
[1:05:25] me
[1:05:26] ye have neither heard his voice at any
[1:05:29] time
[1:05:30] nor seen his shape so now if we declare
[1:05:34] we have his word abiding in us
[1:05:37] and he hath sent us
[1:05:41] now think of the implications
[1:05:45] now they can no longer say
[1:05:48] we have not heard his voice nor
[1:05:52] seen his shape
[1:06:00] do we agree with that now let's go back
[1:06:03] one more verse
[1:06:05] to 36. verily verily i say unto you the
[1:06:08] hour is coming and now
[1:06:10] is when the dead shall hear the voice of
[1:06:13] the son of god
[1:06:14] and they that here shall live
[1:06:20] see i wasn't just making all that up
[1:06:22] when i told you you had the power to
[1:06:24] impart eternal life
[1:06:27] because if we work this backwards it
[1:06:28] says the exact same thing
[1:06:30] let's read it backwards from 38 if we
[1:06:33] have his word abiding in us
[1:06:35] can we sing amen to that
[1:06:38] that means that we are sent of him
[1:06:43] which means we are his voice
[1:06:47] which means we are his shape
[1:06:51] which means we are what the world can
[1:06:53] see
[1:06:55] which means we're the voice of the son
[1:06:58] of god
[1:06:59] that can cause the dead to live
[1:07:05] you say oh yeah we've heard all that
[1:07:06] before praise the lord
[1:07:08] think about the implication saints
[1:07:12] because that's the part that's sweet in
[1:07:14] the mouth
[1:07:15] the part that's bitter in the belly is
[1:07:17] if you don't come to this point of
[1:07:20] revelation
[1:07:20] and you allow worldly living and your
[1:07:23] hybrid spirit
[1:07:24] to default to distract you and cause you
[1:07:27] to to
[1:07:28] bring a variance to this revelation you
[1:07:30] are speaking
[1:07:31] death to people
[1:07:39] see the implications see the
[1:07:42] gravity to the position see how it's
[1:07:46] so much more than what happened in the
[1:07:48] garden
[1:07:49] water baptism in the name of jesus
[1:07:51] christ long hair long skirts
[1:07:53] not cussing not swearing not cheating
[1:07:55] not stealing
[1:07:58] see the position it puts us in
[1:08:02] life and death in the power of the
[1:08:05] tongue
[1:08:09] life and death
[1:08:12] in the power of a lived life
[1:08:17] because we know that's what brother
[1:08:18] branham said we needed he says we need
[1:08:20] thousands of lived voices
[1:08:24] thundering out in this age
[1:08:28] a lived life is
[1:08:31] the form and the shape that the world
[1:08:34] can see
[1:08:35] that will declare i and my father
[1:08:38] are one i am the dispenser of eternal
[1:08:42] life
[1:08:43] i have the authority i have the ability
[1:08:46] not within myself but because i'm under
[1:08:50] the correct messenger for my age and i'm
[1:08:52] declaring
[1:08:53] the truth and the revelation as he
[1:08:55] brought it to us
[1:08:56] does that make sense that day on calvary
[1:09:00] 1960 brother branham says now notice
[1:09:03] the greater works was to have the power
[1:09:05] in the church
[1:09:07] not only to heal the sick by prayer to
[1:09:10] cast out devils by prayer
[1:09:11] but to impart eternal life
[1:09:17] to believers the holy ghost was coming
[1:09:20] and given into the hands of the church
[1:09:22] to impart
[1:09:23] life
[1:09:26] oh that's what calvary meant it took
[1:09:30] stooped degraded men and women and
[1:09:32] lifted them into a place to be sons and
[1:09:34] daughters of god
[1:09:35] to heal the sick and to impart eternal
[1:09:38] life
[1:09:38] by giving the holy ghost to obedient
[1:09:41] believers
[1:09:42] men who were once unbelievers be made
[1:09:45] believers and impart
[1:09:47] spiritual eternal life
[1:09:51] you'll notice how many times he says
[1:09:53] this he's not mincing words
[1:09:55] he's not saying this by accident he
[1:09:58] means what he says
[1:10:01] this sick woman laying here i can pray a
[1:10:04] prayer of faith and she'll be healed
[1:10:06] that's a great thing that's what he was
[1:10:08] doing then
[1:10:10] but he said
[1:10:14] greater than this shall ye do i'm going
[1:10:17] to give you
[1:10:18] power not only to raise him up for a
[1:10:21] while
[1:10:21] but to give him eternal life which will
[1:10:23] be eternal forever
[1:10:25] poor blind wretched people how do you
[1:10:28] miss that
[1:10:28] don't you see what the greater thing is
[1:10:32] that's the greatest thing that could
[1:10:34] ever happen was to impart eternal life
[1:10:36] to people what is eternal life
[1:10:40] the life that he lived the life that was
[1:10:43] in him
[1:10:44] impart that to others
[1:10:50] can a man do that
[1:10:54] a son of god can
[1:10:59] if you refuse he that the father has
[1:11:03] sent
[1:11:04] you refuse the father
[1:11:07] so if you say that's too much for me i
[1:11:09] can't go there that's too radical
[1:11:11] that puts me in a place that i can't
[1:11:13] agree with that puts the bride in a
[1:11:15] position that i can't agree with
[1:11:20] i'm not going to say that even if my
[1:11:24] hybrid spirit and flesh
[1:11:25] resisted every day of my life i'm still
[1:11:28] going to say what he said
[1:11:30] and it's up to him to come into the
[1:11:31] temple and declare who he is
[1:11:35] the life that he lived that was in him
[1:11:39] impart that to others can a man do that
[1:11:44] a son of god can jesus said
[1:11:47] watch immediately where he goes jesus
[1:11:50] said
[1:11:50] whosoever sins you remit to
[1:11:54] them they are remitted whosoever sins
[1:11:56] you retain
[1:11:57] sin you retain to them they are retained
[1:12:01] we covered that a couple weeks ago but
[1:12:04] look where he immediately goes back to
[1:12:07] can a man do that a son of god can
[1:12:11] whosoever sin you remit how do you remit
[1:12:14] their sin
[1:12:15] saints by simply telling them the truth
[1:12:19] the present day living truth
[1:12:23] always remits sin always always always
[1:12:26] it did back in genesis
[1:12:28] it does in revelation it did when jesus
[1:12:30] was here it will now
[1:12:32] present day truth always remits sin
[1:12:37] because sin is unbelief and if you know
[1:12:39] the truth
[1:12:40] and you do the truth i'm getting ahead
[1:12:44] of myself but
[1:12:45] who can convince me of sin
[1:12:48] who can who can say that i'm sinful
[1:12:54] john 5 39
[1:12:58] these are some heavy things we're laying
[1:13:00] down saints
[1:13:01] they're heavy things with with serious
[1:13:04] implications
[1:13:06] but here's what i'll say to that you
[1:13:08] think i was bold before and now i'm just
[1:13:09] going to go crazy on you
[1:13:11] search the scriptures for
[1:13:14] in them you think you have eternal life
[1:13:16] and they are they
[1:13:18] that testify of me
[1:13:26] and ye will not come to me
[1:13:29] that you may have life
[1:13:35] i've received not honor from men i'm not
[1:13:38] looking for honor for men
[1:13:40] i don't care about honor for men
[1:13:43] but i know you that ye have not the love
[1:13:46] of god in you
[1:13:49] these are harsh things this is as we
[1:13:52] would say this is gun barrel straight
[1:13:54] saints
[1:13:55] jesus is not pulling any punches
[1:14:00] search the scriptures you know what if
[1:14:03] your life don't match the scriptures i
[1:14:05] wouldn't tell your coworker at work
[1:14:07] search the scriptures
[1:14:11] because he might
[1:14:15] and then you're in a real pickle
[1:14:19] you say well i can't ever declare that
[1:14:20] then because i i know i can't live
[1:14:22] live that life and if they do search the
[1:14:24] scriptures they'll find me out
[1:14:25] you don't have to live in that saints
[1:14:28] you don't have to live in that
[1:14:30] brother brandon says this is a bright
[1:14:31] age he says this is an astronaut age
[1:14:33] he says this is a light age he says this
[1:14:36] is a
[1:14:37] free age
[1:14:40] you can be free from that
[1:14:46] you can declare that you can declare
[1:14:49] that to the people that you see that the
[1:14:50] people you meet
[1:14:52] you can declare go search the scriptures
[1:14:55] for they are they that testify of me
[1:14:58] they
[1:14:58] are they that testify of my position
[1:15:04] it's easy for us to say well yeah go
[1:15:06] look at malachi 4.
[1:15:09] right you'll you'll see brother
[1:15:10] branham's there
[1:15:13] what about the children in malachi 4.
[1:15:17] what about the children
[1:15:21] go go search luke 17 30. you'll see the
[1:15:24] son of man you'll see brother branham's
[1:15:26] ministry in there
[1:15:27] what about the eagles that was on the
[1:15:29] carcass
[1:15:30] [Music]
[1:15:32] who's that
[1:15:36] go search revelation chapter 10 you'll
[1:15:38] see brother branham was the one to
[1:15:40] that angel that was declared those
[1:15:41] mysteries
[1:15:43] what about 8 through 11. who was that
[1:15:49] i've not crunched the numbers so don't
[1:15:51] crucify me if i'm wrong
[1:15:54] but i would venture to say that there's
[1:15:56] more scriptures that testify of the
[1:15:58] position of the bride
[1:15:59] than testify of that of the messenger
[1:16:03] he himself declared that john declared
[1:16:07] that when he was here
[1:16:09] look how many scriptures have written
[1:16:11] about eliezer look how many
[1:16:13] scriptures are written about rebecca and
[1:16:15] isaac
[1:16:18] you say well you're trying to diminish
[1:16:19] that no saints
[1:16:21] no there is there is nobody i'm
[1:16:25] convinced of this i have crunched the
[1:16:27] numbers on it
[1:16:28] there is nobody that will hold the
[1:16:31] prophet
[1:16:31] into his rightful position more so than
[1:16:33] i
[1:16:35] i will never back up on that if you ever
[1:16:38] hear me backing up on that
[1:16:40] you will know that i've lost my mind and
[1:16:43] brother branham says that you can have
[1:16:44] the holy ghost and lose your mind
[1:16:45] so i'm still saved but you know that if
[1:16:48] i back up on that revelation just
[1:16:50] overlook me and don't believe anything
[1:16:52] that i say because it's not me talking
[1:16:54] i'll go on record here and now he is the
[1:16:57] vindicated voice for this
[1:16:58] age he is the messenger for
[1:17:02] this h and through that messenger
[1:17:05] comes our revelation but in order to
[1:17:08] honor that revelation and in order to
[1:17:10] properly place him where he
[1:17:12] is and where he was we have to accept
[1:17:15] our position
[1:17:16] in order for rebecca to truly show she
[1:17:20] believed what eliezer was
[1:17:22] and what he said she had to get on a
[1:17:24] camel accept her position
[1:17:26] and go marry isaac
[1:17:32] if i would ever back up on that
[1:17:36] again don't hate me don't crucify me
[1:17:38] saying just understand i've lost my mind
[1:17:41] just just understand he's lost his mind
[1:17:44] but
[1:17:44] here and now what is today the 10th of
[1:17:46] january 2021
[1:17:48] i will declare to you that is the true
[1:17:51] messenger
[1:17:53] he was the voice of god to us
[1:17:56] the vision that he declared is correct
[1:18:00] and if i would ever say anything other
[1:18:02] than that again
[1:18:04] just ignore it just love me just pray
[1:18:06] for me
[1:18:07] i've got the holy ghost but i've just
[1:18:09] lost my mind
[1:18:12] but while i'm in my mind and i know we
[1:18:15] laugh at that and we say that
[1:18:17] jokingly but i mean the food that we're
[1:18:19] eating nowadays brother branham told us
[1:18:20] it's breaking down our brain cells
[1:18:21] since there is no guarantee that
[1:18:23] tomorrow i will not i just will not be a
[1:18:25] crazy man
[1:18:27] it's hybridization jesus himself said if
[1:18:30] i don't cut this work
[1:18:31] short there will be no flesh saved
[1:18:34] your brain is flesh he did not say there
[1:18:37] would not be any seed saved he said
[1:18:40] there won't be any flesh saved
[1:18:42] because he knows the effects of
[1:18:43] hybridization
[1:18:47] so i would say let's extend mercy to
[1:18:49] those who have lost their way
[1:18:51] let's extend mercy maybe they did just
[1:18:54] lose their mind
[1:18:55] pray for them i mean what's the harm in
[1:18:57] that
[1:18:59] just pray for them if they if they've
[1:19:02] lost their way and they can't see that
[1:19:04] open vision anymore
[1:19:04] if they've lost just the simplest
[1:19:07] revelation
[1:19:08] of who the messenger was
[1:19:12] it's the effects of hybridization it is
[1:19:15] saints
[1:19:16] it's the effects it's it is either one
[1:19:18] of two things
[1:19:19] it's the effects of hybridization or
[1:19:22] it's a
[1:19:23] demonic spirit
[1:19:26] because even a rational thinking person
[1:19:30] could clearly identify the prophet in
[1:19:31] the in the scriptures and his position
[1:19:33] in the scriptures
[1:19:34] and and that's not a that's not an
[1:19:38] outlandish statement because
[1:19:39] the scripture says that he says the
[1:19:42] prophets come and you kill him
[1:19:43] and then years later you recognize that
[1:19:45] was the prophet so if time would go
[1:19:48] on saints the whole world will come to
[1:19:50] the understanding that he was the
[1:19:51] prophet
[1:19:53] that look at history they've done it
[1:19:55] that's
[1:19:56] every time they've done that in history
[1:19:59] we just haven't seen
[1:20:01] time going long enough for them to
[1:20:02] recognize that
[1:20:05] but now as i don't know why i'm dealing
[1:20:07] with this but now
[1:20:08] why why we're in this hybrid condition
[1:20:11] and hybridization is coming on so strong
[1:20:14] and the effects on the flesh and on the
[1:20:16] mind and the brain cells brother branham
[1:20:18] says
[1:20:21] those are real effects and the only
[1:20:23] thing that can overcome that is the
[1:20:24] spirit of god the spirit of revelation
[1:20:26] so it's either the effects of
[1:20:28] hybridization that have broke that down
[1:20:30] from the people
[1:20:30] or it's just a demonic spirit that's
[1:20:32] possessing them
[1:20:34] either way we should pray for him either
[1:20:37] way
[1:20:37] we should extend mercy to him
[1:20:42] search the scriptures for in them ye
[1:20:45] think ye have eternal life
[1:20:47] and they are they which testify of me
[1:20:50] and ye will not come to me that ye might
[1:20:52] have life
[1:20:54] i receive not honor from men i'm not
[1:20:57] looking for honor for men
[1:20:59] but i know you that ye have
[1:21:03] not the love of god in you he's saying
[1:21:06] you don't have the love of god in you
[1:21:08] and it's evident
[1:21:09] because you won't receive the words that
[1:21:10] i'm speaking to you you won't go and
[1:21:12] search the scriptures and
[1:21:13] acknowledge i am he you don't have the
[1:21:16] love of god in you
[1:21:17] because you don't want to recognize the
[1:21:19] present word for this age
[1:21:24] jesus was saying this then
[1:21:27] and it was okay for him to say it then
[1:21:29] because he was the present word for the
[1:21:31] h
[1:21:32] but jesus is still the present word for
[1:21:34] the h he's simply in another form and in
[1:21:37] another
[1:21:38] another shape what
[1:21:41] is the bride the manifestation
[1:21:45] of this hour so when people would want
[1:21:49] i won't say people because again i don't
[1:21:51] want to put it out there
[1:21:52] so when your hybrid spirit wants to
[1:21:55] resist
[1:21:56] the position that the scripture puts you
[1:21:59] in
[1:22:00] just declare to it
[1:22:04] i knew you would say that because you
[1:22:06] don't have the love of god in you
[1:22:10] why would you say anything else
[1:22:13] you clearly don't have the love of god
[1:22:16] in you if you would agree with me i
[1:22:18] would be concerned because you're hybrid
[1:22:20] and i'm not
[1:22:25] it can't say anything else saints
[1:22:28] it can't recognize that because it
[1:22:31] doesn't have the love of god in it
[1:22:35] it won't hearken to that true voice
[1:22:38] because it's not
[1:22:39] looking for life it's father is
[1:22:43] death he rides a horse
[1:22:46] with that name on it he doesn't want the
[1:22:50] love of god
[1:22:51] he doesn't want life he's happy on his
[1:22:54] horse of death
[1:22:59] he can't declare these things because he
[1:23:01] does not have the love of god
[1:23:07] we're going to touch just on a couple
[1:23:08] more and then we're going to wrap this
[1:23:11] up
[1:23:11] you were very gracious to me last time
[1:23:14] and let me get my
[1:23:15] long lengthy foundation laid i won't
[1:23:18] abuse you this morning
[1:23:20] i'll try not to abuse you this morning i
[1:23:22] always give myself an out
[1:23:25] john 5 43
[1:23:29] i am come in my father's name
[1:23:36] i can tell some of you are starting to
[1:23:38] pick up on this revelation
[1:23:39] because when i say that you're not
[1:23:40] thinking about jesus anymore
[1:23:46] i am come in my father's name
[1:23:51] and ye receive me not if another shall
[1:23:54] come in his
[1:23:55] own name him ye will receive
[1:23:59] how can you believe which res how can ye
[1:24:02] believe
[1:24:03] which receive honor one of another he's
[1:24:05] saying how can you believe a man that
[1:24:07] would receive honor
[1:24:08] from another man and and that man does
[1:24:11] not seek the honor that cometh from god
[1:24:14] alone
[1:24:16] do not think that i will accuse you
[1:24:18] before the father there is one that
[1:24:20] accuses you
[1:24:21] even moses
[1:24:28] moses let's bring it present tense
[1:24:33] there is one that accuses you
[1:24:36] even brother branham
[1:24:40] in whom ye trust
[1:24:47] let's back up i am come in my father's
[1:24:51] name
[1:24:53] and ye receive me not i'm to make it
[1:24:57] real plain
[1:24:58] i am come in mrs jesus christ
[1:25:01] and ye receive me not
[1:25:06] if another will come in his own ministry
[1:25:10] on his own platform you will receive him
[1:25:15] if he seeks if he seeks honor for men
[1:25:18] you'll accept that
[1:25:19] why would you accept that and not he
[1:25:22] that's not
[1:25:22] looking for honor from men but he that's
[1:25:25] looking
[1:25:26] from for honor from god
[1:25:32] but don't think i'll accuse you of
[1:25:33] anything
[1:25:35] there's one that's already accused you
[1:25:37] because you will not accept the position
[1:25:39] of the bride that brother branham has
[1:25:41] put her in
[1:25:42] i don't need to accuse you of anything
[1:25:46] don't put it out there saints
[1:25:49] i'm talking to myself i don't need to
[1:25:53] accuse
[1:25:54] my hybrid spirit of anything there's one
[1:25:57] that's already done that
[1:25:59] and he has already declared your hybrid
[1:26:01] spirit is not part of that bride
[1:26:03] position
[1:26:06] your hybrid spirit will raise up with
[1:26:09] all kinds of thoughts and ideas
[1:26:12] selfishness and pride
[1:26:19] it will seek honor among men
[1:26:26] it will be much easier for you to accept
[1:26:29] your hybrid spirit which is seeking
[1:26:31] honor among men
[1:26:32] then it will be your true seed and the
[1:26:35] word coming from your soul
[1:26:36] which is not looking for honor from men
[1:26:43] see how close it is saints don't put it
[1:26:46] out there
[1:26:48] bring it home discern the spirits within
[1:26:53] the framework of the true christian
[1:26:55] church
[1:26:59] don't think that i'll accuse you of
[1:27:01] anything hybrid spirit there's one that
[1:27:04] accuses you
[1:27:05] even the vindicated prophet brother
[1:27:07] branham
[1:27:08] in whom ye trust
[1:27:12] even the hybrid spirit knows who he is
[1:27:16] it don't like it but it still know who's
[1:27:19] he is
[1:27:20] you say well how can that be look at the
[1:27:23] devils that confronted paul
[1:27:27] there was no doubt they knew who paul
[1:27:30] was
[1:27:34] there were devils that came and says
[1:27:38] we know who jesus is and we know who
[1:27:41] paul is
[1:27:42] but who are you
[1:27:51] see i'm i'm not just crazy saying so
[1:27:53] these things lay in the scriptures
[1:27:54] we've been taught this for years we've
[1:27:56] heard this preached for years
[1:27:58] think seriously of the implications
[1:28:00] though
[1:28:02] think of the implications
[1:28:06] i know who jesus is and i know who paul
[1:28:09] is
[1:28:10] but who are you
[1:28:15] your hybrid spirit will ask you that
[1:28:17] every day who
[1:28:19] do you think you are
[1:28:25] mrs jesus christ you don't believe that
[1:28:29] well i know you wouldn't believe that
[1:28:31] because you don't have the love of god
[1:28:32] in you
[1:28:33] because if you did you'd believe the
[1:28:34] words that i said unto you and then you
[1:28:36] would have eternal life
[1:28:40] by the way i and my father are one
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:44] when he raises his ugly head just step
[1:28:46] on it
[1:28:48] i'm not going to preach that because
[1:28:51] lord knows we've had enough stomping on
[1:28:53] the devil preaching over the years
[1:28:57] if you really want to stomp on the devil
[1:28:58] and give him a black eye tell them you
[1:29:00] and your father are one
[1:29:03] brother branham says these people
[1:29:05] nowadays up here on the platform
[1:29:06] punching devils and
[1:29:08] saying all that blue devil over there
[1:29:09] i'm going to get them and this one's a
[1:29:10] hairy when i'm going to get them
[1:29:14] if you really want to hit the devil
[1:29:19] tell them these other things
[1:29:22] give them a black eye with i and my
[1:29:24] father are one and then knock him out
[1:29:25] with these other things
[1:29:28] and if you really want to hurt him do
[1:29:31] that without ever saying a word
[1:29:36] a lived life will kill the devil not
[1:29:38] just knock him out not just give him a
[1:29:40] black eye just not
[1:29:41] not a bloody nose
[1:29:45] if you had believed brother branham you
[1:29:48] would have believed me because he spoke
[1:29:50] of me
[1:29:56] you say that's adding to the scriptures
[1:29:59] is it
[1:30:04] is it or am i saying what the tape said
[1:30:13] if you had believed the prophet for the
[1:30:16] age you would recognize and believe the
[1:30:18] position that it places you in
[1:30:20] and if you take away from that you're
[1:30:23] guilty from taking away from the book of
[1:30:25] life
[1:30:26] and your part will be removed and that
[1:30:28] just makes good common sense
[1:30:29] if you won't declare that i am in the
[1:30:31] book of life and this is my position
[1:30:34] how are you going to be in the book of
[1:30:36] life and that be your position
[1:30:40] as brother brainer says you're only
[1:30:42] saved as long as you testify you're
[1:30:43] saved
[1:30:44] you're only healed as long as you
[1:30:45] believe that you're healed if you
[1:30:46] believe that you're not
[1:30:48] in that position you won't be in that
[1:30:50] position
[1:30:51] but the same is true for the other if
[1:30:54] you believe that that is your position
[1:30:57] that is your position regardless of what
[1:31:00] your hybrid spirit tells you
[1:31:04] if you would have believed verse 47
[1:31:10] if ye believed but if ye believed
[1:31:14] not his writings how shall ye believe
[1:31:17] my words
[1:31:22] if you didn't believe what brother
[1:31:24] branham said about me
[1:31:26] there is no way you're going to believe
[1:31:28] what i'm saying about me
[1:31:31] but if you do
[1:31:35] if you do believe what he said about me
[1:31:38] then why would it make you hiccup when i
[1:31:40] say the same things
[1:31:42] why would you give any attention to your
[1:31:44] hybrid spirit when it hiccups when you
[1:31:46] say the same thing about yourself
[1:31:55] if ye believe not his writings
[1:31:59] how should you believe my words
[1:32:03] don't leave it 2000 years ago bring it
[1:32:06] home today
[1:32:16] let's do one more and then we'll close
[1:32:19] is that fair
[1:32:22] i didn't tell you how long the one more
[1:32:24] was
[1:32:31] i'm sneaky like that you have to watch
[1:32:34] john 6 24
[1:32:37] this is immediately after brother i'm
[1:32:39] sorry this is immediately after jesus
[1:32:42] does the miracle with the loaves and the
[1:32:44] fishes
[1:32:47] john 6 24 when the people therefore saw
[1:32:49] that jesus
[1:32:50] was not there neither his disciples they
[1:32:53] also took to ships
[1:32:54] it says took shipping but we understand
[1:32:56] they got on a ship and they went
[1:32:57] somewhere
[1:32:58] and came to capernaum seeking for jesus
[1:33:01] and when they found him on the other
[1:33:02] side of the sea they said unto him
[1:33:04] rabbi when cometh now hither
[1:33:08] jesus answered them and said and said
[1:33:11] verily verily i say unto you
[1:33:14] you seek me not because you saw the
[1:33:15] miracles but because you did eaten the
[1:33:17] loaves and were filled
[1:33:22] why didn't you just answer my question
[1:33:24] and tell me how you got over here
[1:33:30] see jesus just did the exact opposite of
[1:33:33] what the scribes and the pharisees did
[1:33:37] they saw a situation and asked the wrong
[1:33:41] question
[1:33:42] jesus saw a situation and even though he
[1:33:45] was
[1:33:46] asked a question he gave the correct
[1:33:48] answer
[1:33:49] that had nothing to do with the question
[1:33:51] being asked mastermind
[1:33:53] how did you get over here you come
[1:33:56] because because you want something to
[1:33:59] eat
[1:34:00] not because you saw the miracles let's
[1:34:02] just deal with deal with the issue here
[1:34:04] it's it's the issue is not how i got to
[1:34:07] where i am
[1:34:09] the issue is you're wanting me to give
[1:34:10] you more loaves and fishes
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:15] i'm not going to get into that because
[1:34:16] i'll be sure and get myself into trouble
[1:34:24] ye seek me not because you saw the
[1:34:26] miracles
[1:34:27] but because ye did eat of the loaves and
[1:34:29] were filled
[1:34:30] labor not for the meat which paireth
[1:34:32] perisheth
[1:34:33] but for the meat which endureth unto
[1:34:35] everlasting life
[1:34:37] which the son of man shall give unto you
[1:34:40] for him hath god the father sealed
[1:34:46] then said they unto him what shall we do
[1:34:49] that we might work the works of god
[1:34:51] jesus answered and said unto him now
[1:34:53] when i read this next statement remember
[1:34:55] of everything we've just covered
[1:35:00] jesus let's back up to the question i
[1:35:02] got to slow down
[1:35:05] when we look at this question and answer
[1:35:08] think about everything we've just said
[1:35:10] this morning
[1:35:12] then said they unto him
[1:35:16] what shall we do that we might work the
[1:35:19] works of god
[1:35:21] jesus answered and said unto him unto
[1:35:24] them
[1:35:25] this is the work of god
[1:35:29] that ye believe on
[1:35:32] him whom he hath
[1:35:37] [Music]
[1:35:40] sent
[1:35:42] now we have an understanding of why
[1:35:44] brother branham would say
[1:35:45] the true bride doctrine is that the
[1:35:49] spiritual bride is
[1:35:52] the word made flesh and blood
[1:35:56] because if you believe that you're doing
[1:35:59] the works of god
[1:36:01] and you are believing in yourself
[1:36:04] that he hath sent you
[1:36:07] not 2 000 years ago but you're doing the
[1:36:11] work of god
[1:36:12] now by believing the true bride doctrine
[1:36:16] and believing that you are
[1:36:19] who he hath sent
[1:36:24] these things are so simple saints
[1:36:28] but they are so deep and so profound
[1:36:32] and the implications that go with them
[1:36:35] with them
[1:36:36] cause havoc in our hybrid mind
[1:36:40] every time we read them but if we will
[1:36:43] just allow the spirit of revelation to
[1:36:46] bypass that and allow
[1:36:49] the simplicity of what the scriptures
[1:36:52] say and what the prophet teaches us to
[1:36:54] be
[1:36:54] true it's simple saints and
[1:36:58] one just goes right with the other and
[1:37:00] it ties into the next one and that ties
[1:37:02] into the next one
[1:37:03] and that's why brother branham can come
[1:37:05] out and say
[1:37:07] in a couple seconds when you begin to
[1:37:10] say i and the father are one and these
[1:37:12] other things the shock will pull away
[1:37:15] because he knows if you can say i and
[1:37:17] the father are one
[1:37:18] and these other things they tie together
[1:37:21] so he can say that in a couple seconds
[1:37:24] and i'll spend months saying it
[1:37:28] but it all goes back to the same thing
[1:37:31] if you can say i and the father are
[1:37:35] one and these other things you are
[1:37:38] doing the work of god by believing the
[1:37:41] true
[1:37:42] bride doctrine see how it all just
[1:37:45] meshes together
[1:37:49] it's so simple but like i said it is
[1:37:53] so profound and the implications that
[1:37:56] go with such are so radical and so
[1:37:59] against denominational teaching and
[1:38:03] and the the thoughts of our own hybrid
[1:38:05] condition
[1:38:06] that we we have to do like paul did we
[1:38:09] have to die
[1:38:10] every day to allow this to be true
[1:38:13] while we're here and while we're
[1:38:14] preaching it and while we're going over
[1:38:16] it while we're reading it and while
[1:38:17] we're studying it and while the
[1:38:18] anointing is here it's like well yeah 2
[1:38:20] plus 2 is 4 duh
[1:38:23] yeah i see it i am he and those other
[1:38:26] things
[1:38:28] but then you go to work monday and your
[1:38:30] hybrid hybrid spirit
[1:38:32] will a situation will come along
[1:38:35] and your hybrid spirit will be like no
[1:38:38] no that may be true for somebody else
[1:38:40] but not you not the way you reacted to
[1:38:42] that
[1:38:45] and that's when that's when we have to
[1:38:50] stomp on the devil
[1:38:52] because we have to take the word of god
[1:38:54] in its simplicity
[1:38:56] and in its truth and squash that
[1:39:00] and get back into the vision
[1:39:04] get back in line
[1:39:09] does that ring a bell with you
[1:39:12] what was he telling the bride to do in
[1:39:15] the vision
[1:39:17] get back in line
[1:39:21] saints were not going to be
[1:39:24] physically marching in ranks and rows
[1:39:28] and the prophet standing over here
[1:39:30] screaming get back in line
[1:39:32] you're six inches to the left
[1:39:34] [Music]
[1:39:36] it's a spiritual vision it's a spiritual
[1:39:39] position
[1:39:41] you go to work monday something happens
[1:39:44] you respond incorrectly and you get six
[1:39:46] inches out of line
[1:39:48] you have to take the word of god and
[1:39:50] allow it to say get
[1:39:52] back in line with the revelation that i
[1:39:54] declared to you
[1:39:56] what revelation is that oh i and my
[1:39:58] father are one
[1:40:02] who can convince me of sin
[1:40:06] you know what i'm really glad he didn't
[1:40:08] say there
[1:40:09] is who can who can accuse me of bad
[1:40:12] decisions
[1:40:14] now he could have said that and it would
[1:40:17] have been true
[1:40:20] but he didn't want to say anything he
[1:40:22] knew we couldn't say
[1:40:24] in our hybrid condition so he said who
[1:40:27] can accuse me of sin
[1:40:31] see if he would have said who can accuse
[1:40:34] me of bad decisions
[1:40:36] you ain't saying those other things
[1:40:37] saints
[1:40:39] i'm not even going to think those other
[1:40:41] things let alone say them
[1:40:43] who can accuse me
[1:40:48] of a mistake he could have said that
[1:40:52] we can't say that
[1:40:57] let's just make it real who can accuse
[1:41:00] me of doing something stupid
[1:41:05] he could have said that
[1:41:08] we can't say that
[1:41:12] but what we can say is what he said
[1:41:15] who can accuse me of sin
[1:41:20] because sin is simply unbelief in the
[1:41:22] word
[1:41:23] and even if in my heart musicians come
[1:41:26] or i'm never going to stop
[1:41:28] if even in my hybrid condition
[1:41:34] i have to testify yesterday
[1:41:38] i made a bad decision
[1:41:41] yesterday i made a mistake let's not
[1:41:43] even put it yesterday this morning
[1:41:45] i made a bad decision this morning i
[1:41:48] made a mistake
[1:41:49] this morning brother franco you could
[1:41:51] appreciate this i did something stupid
[1:41:55] that's an inside joke don't you all ask
[1:41:57] i will never divulge you
[1:42:02] but that doesn't change the fact that i
[1:42:05] can say
[1:42:07] who can accuse me of sin because even in
[1:42:10] my mistakes and my bad decisions
[1:42:12] and even in my outright stupidity
[1:42:16] there is not one speck of this word of
[1:42:19] this open vision that i will not line up
[1:42:21] with
[1:42:22] if he in his grace and in his mercy will
[1:42:25] simply
[1:42:26] show me where i am not believing
[1:42:29] and where i am not in line with his word
[1:42:31] i will repent for that
[1:42:33] and i will immediately get back in line
[1:42:35] even if three seconds later i fall out
[1:42:37] of line again
[1:42:38] i will immediately get back in line and
[1:42:40] then when i go around the corner and i
[1:42:42] fall out of line again i will repent and
[1:42:44] get back in line
[1:42:45] because he did not say who can accuse me
[1:42:48] of bad decisions
[1:42:49] who can accuse me of wrong who can
[1:42:51] accuse me of being stupid
[1:42:54] i know that's a harsh word to use from
[1:42:55] the pulpit but i'm talking about myself
[1:42:57] so i'm allowed to use it
[1:43:00] if you want to use it on yourself that's
[1:43:01] that's up to you i'm not saying that
[1:43:02] about you
[1:43:03] i'm saying it about me but
[1:43:06] he could have said those things but he
[1:43:09] didn't
[1:43:12] who can accuse me of sin
[1:43:15] and i know i'm speaking to a group of
[1:43:17] people here this morning that can say
[1:43:18] that and that believe that
[1:43:21] saints we in our hybrid condition are
[1:43:23] going to get it wrong
[1:43:25] every day every hour
[1:43:28] every minute we are going to fall flat
[1:43:31] on our face
[1:43:33] as brother john said a couple weeks ago
[1:43:35] when he was preaching
[1:43:37] the more that i grow in spiritual
[1:43:39] maturity
[1:43:40] the more i hate myself
[1:43:43] that if you want to put a uh indicator
[1:43:46] on spiritual maturity
[1:43:48] put that on it because that's the true
[1:43:50] indicator
[1:43:51] the more the person hates themself
[1:43:54] that's they're getting there then
[1:43:57] they're getting who was more mature than
[1:43:59] paul and that's all paul could say
[1:44:01] is i want to do good and i can't i don't
[1:44:04] want to do bad and i do
[1:44:06] who will rid me from this body of death
[1:44:10] in me is no good thing
[1:44:12] [Music]
[1:44:17] paul had the revelation
[1:44:21] paul was in line with the vision
[1:44:24] paul recognized you know what
[1:44:28] that vision is true even if i've got to
[1:44:31] die daily
[1:44:32] to make it true it's still
[1:44:36] true i'm going to stop there because if
[1:44:40] i read anything else we're going to be
[1:44:41] here for another
[1:44:43] however long we've been here so praise
[1:44:45] the lord let's stand together
[1:44:52] let's just pray together as our pastor
[1:44:54] would come
[1:44:56] precious lord jesus
[1:45:00] lord we're grateful
[1:45:03] for your truth in this age to us lord
[1:45:09] father we know
[1:45:13] in us lays no good thing
[1:45:17] except that
[1:45:20] predestinated seed word
[1:45:24] soul life gene of god that
[1:45:28] you have placed in there
[1:45:31] lord but we want to go forward from
[1:45:34] this day and from this building and from
[1:45:36] this service
[1:45:37] with the revelation that though
[1:45:40] everything
[1:45:41] else even in myself
[1:45:44] testifies against that that revelation
[1:45:47] is still true
[1:45:48] and that part of me is good and that
[1:45:51] part of me
[1:45:52] never fell in the beginning that part of
[1:45:54] me resisted the devil's lie in heaven
[1:45:56] and will resist the devil's lie now in
[1:45:59] my hybrid spirit that would tell me
[1:46:01] that i my father are not one
[1:46:04] lord we want to move forward in these
[1:46:06] things
[1:46:07] we want to think solemnly about these
[1:46:10] things
[1:46:11] we don't want to put these things off on
[1:46:13] somebody else
[1:46:14] or for another age but we want to accept
[1:46:17] them for ourselves so that we can be
[1:46:20] found faithful as you said we were in
[1:46:24] the book of revelation
[1:46:26] that we were chosen and faithful
[1:46:30] lord we want to be faithful to the
[1:46:33] vision that you have given us in this
[1:46:35] day that we can testify
[1:46:37] i do nothing and i believe nothing
[1:46:40] except for what
[1:46:41] my father showed with me regardless of
[1:46:44] how many times our hybrid humanity would
[1:46:47] raise up against that
[1:46:52] we want to testify that i believe
[1:46:54] nothing but what my father showed me
[1:46:56] lord would you grant that to us we thank
[1:46:59] you once again for this time that you
[1:47:01] have
[1:47:02] given us to speak of you lord we just
[1:47:04] pray that you would take these things
[1:47:06] make them a reality in our lives
[1:47:08] i pray that you would bless the people
[1:47:10] lord father if there's
[1:47:12] sick here would you heal them if they're
[1:47:14] lost here would you draw them to you
[1:47:16] lord
[1:47:17] if there's financial needs would you
[1:47:19] meet them lord if there's
[1:47:21] spiritual needs would you meet them if
[1:47:23] there's emotional needs would you
[1:47:24] meet them lord and would you meet them
[1:47:28] in the way that you have chosen to
[1:47:31] through the opening of your word lord
[1:47:34] not that some man could do anything to
[1:47:37] help another man
[1:47:38] but you can come lord you can come
[1:47:43] and pick up a vessel our brothers and
[1:47:46] our sisters
[1:47:48] and help one another lord i pray that
[1:47:51] that would be our position to each other
[1:47:53] and to ourselves
[1:47:54] we ask these things in the name of the
[1:47:56] lord jesus christ
[1:47:58] the bride says amen god bless you saints
[1:48:01] let's sing brother
[1:48:04] [Music]
[1:48:06] [Laughter]
[1:48:10] i belong to jesus
[1:48:18] he purchased me
[1:48:25] and i'm all his
[1:48:37] [Music]
[1:49:00] praise god when i hear brother ben
[1:49:03] preach and i
[1:49:04] recognize those things to be true
[1:49:06] there's one word that keeps popping into
[1:49:08] my mind
[1:49:09] responsibility what a heavy
[1:49:12] responsibility
[1:49:14] god has called us in these places in
[1:49:16] this age we didn't do it to ourselves
[1:49:18] we didn't call ourselves we didn't
[1:49:19] predestine ourselves he did
[1:49:22] but he's given us the truth he's given
[1:49:25] us life we carry with
[1:49:26] us life we carry with us the message we
[1:49:29] are
[1:49:29] amen we are the message on display we
[1:49:32] are the message the living word
[1:49:35] and what a responsibility to accept that
[1:49:37] word to acknowledge that word
[1:49:39] and to give it unto us if you turn with
[1:49:42] me let's turn to luke chapter 10 the
[1:49:44] scripture kept coming to mind
[1:49:47] [Music]
[1:49:52] luke chapter 10 verse 16
[1:49:56] jesus takes and he sends the disciples
[1:49:59] out two by two and he sends them into
[1:50:01] cities
[1:50:02] to go and preach the gospel of the
[1:50:04] kingdom and tell them that
[1:50:05] the kingdom is at hand and he sends them
[1:50:08] out with a message and
[1:50:09] they go to the cities declaring the
[1:50:11] message and he tells them what to do
[1:50:12] in any home you come and say peace be
[1:50:15] unto you and if there's peace there then
[1:50:16] their peace will remain if not it'll
[1:50:17] return unto you
[1:50:18] if they don't accept you go out and
[1:50:20] shake the very dust of the city off of
[1:50:22] your feet and move on and then this is
[1:50:24] what he says in verse 16 he says
[1:50:26] he that heareth you heareth me
[1:50:30] and he that despises you despises me
[1:50:34] and he that despises me despises him
[1:50:36] that sent me
[1:50:40] see these men didn't call themselves the
[1:50:43] lord called them
[1:50:45] these men didn't come up with their own
[1:50:47] message he gave them the message to
[1:50:50] preach
[1:50:52] see if you call yourself and you take a
[1:50:55] position that's not yours
[1:50:56] then none of this applies to you anyways
[1:50:58] [Music]
[1:50:59] if you don't take the words that he gave
[1:51:01] you to say and you make up your own
[1:51:02] words
[1:51:03] none of this applies to you anyways this
[1:51:05] only works
[1:51:06] if you are predestinated chosen before
[1:51:08] the foundation of the world he's called
[1:51:10] you
[1:51:10] into a position and then he's given you
[1:51:12] the words to say and then when you go in
[1:51:14] that position and speak what he's given
[1:51:16] you
[1:51:17] all of this applies then to you
[1:51:20] that's why the first revelation is the
[1:51:22] revelation of who you are
[1:51:24] the one that's most important is that he
[1:51:26] called me i didn't call myself
[1:51:28] i didn't make myself bride you can't
[1:51:30] take the title of bride
[1:51:31] unless he has before the foundation of
[1:51:33] the world called you to be his bride
[1:51:35] you could say whatever you want but it
[1:51:36] means nothing
[1:51:39] but when god has called you before the
[1:51:41] foundation of the world to be his bride
[1:51:43] in this
[1:51:44] end time that you would be the
[1:51:45] manifestation of the word in this day
[1:51:48] that's not your choosing that's his
[1:51:49] choosing and then when he would give you
[1:51:52] the message through a messenger to say
[1:51:54] this is the truth this is the vision
[1:51:55] this is the word and you go forth in
[1:51:57] repeating that
[1:51:59] he that heareth you heareth him
[1:52:03] he that despiseth you despises him and
[1:52:06] you despise him you despise him to send
[1:52:07] him
[1:52:08] why because it's all working in a line
[1:52:12] all that the father was he poured into
[1:52:14] christ amen
[1:52:15] all that christ was he poured into the
[1:52:17] church
[1:52:19] and all is connected amen
[1:52:22] that's why it's so important that this
[1:52:25] message has come the seals have been
[1:52:27] broke
[1:52:27] to unseal who we are amen because we're
[1:52:30] walking around in spiritual amnesia
[1:52:32] amen and we're afraid to declare the
[1:52:34] truth and who we are we're doing nobody
[1:52:36] else any good but once he's awakened us
[1:52:38] to who we are
[1:52:39] what hour we're living in what is the
[1:52:41] manifestation of this hour
[1:52:42] now we've got something to go forth and
[1:52:44] say and when we say
[1:52:46] that amen those are the words of eternal
[1:52:49] life
[1:52:49] that way you can say to somebody the
[1:52:51] words that i speak unto you
[1:52:52] how can you say that amen you know you
[1:52:55] know you're just a human being you know
[1:52:57] you're just so flawed
[1:52:58] because you know that's not my words of
[1:53:00] my human flesh it's not the words of my
[1:53:02] mind
[1:53:02] but this is the very word of god that
[1:53:04] he's given to me
[1:53:07] and he's given it to me to say he hasn't
[1:53:10] given it to my neighbor
[1:53:11] he hasn't given it to the other person
[1:53:13] or the preacher but he's called
[1:53:14] me to be the manifestation of this hour
[1:53:16] because i'm part of the bride
[1:53:19] and he's called me to say these things
[1:53:22] and then you can say to somebody the
[1:53:23] very words that i speak unto you
[1:53:26] they are the words of eternal life
[1:53:33] if we would just embrace that not be
[1:53:34] afraid of that
[1:53:37] we would allow the fear of the flesh and
[1:53:38] the spirit to subside
[1:53:40] and just embrace who he told us we were
[1:53:45] and to move in with confidence into that
[1:53:48] role
[1:53:50] it's the only way that we can help
[1:53:52] anybody else
[1:53:53] the apostle paul was no help at all to
[1:53:56] the gentiles
[1:53:57] until the apostle paul could get
[1:53:59] comfortable with the revelation that
[1:54:01] i am the light to the gentiles
[1:54:03] [Music]
[1:54:05] that's a big statement he's taking the
[1:54:07] scripture right out of isaiah and he's
[1:54:08] saying i
[1:54:09] am the fulfillment of that word and when
[1:54:12] he come into
[1:54:13] and we come into the city and they
[1:54:14] rejected what he said he said
[1:54:16] seeing that you have refused eternal
[1:54:18] life what is paul doing
[1:54:20] paul is declaring i am the light to the
[1:54:22] gentiles
[1:54:23] you did not receive the words that i
[1:54:24] speak unto you because the words are
[1:54:26] speaker to your eternal life
[1:54:27] when you rejected that you saw yourself
[1:54:29] not fit for eternal life
[1:54:31] lo i turn unto the gentiles
[1:54:33] [Music]
[1:54:35] if paul would have been wishy-washy on
[1:54:37] that revelation
[1:54:38] if paul would allow the doubts and the
[1:54:40] contradictions in his own life in his
[1:54:42] own mind
[1:54:43] amen where would the gentiles that could
[1:54:45] where would the gentiles be
[1:54:46] and the corinthians and the
[1:54:48] thessalonians and those in ephesus and
[1:54:50] those of laodicea
[1:54:50] what would have happened to you and i if
[1:54:52] paul would have not been able to catch
[1:54:54] the revelation for his day and catch his
[1:54:56] position in the word
[1:54:57] and go forth and be bold enough to say
[1:54:59] i'm the light to the gentiles
[1:55:01] amen he will judge you by the gospel
[1:55:03] that i preach
[1:55:04] [Music]
[1:55:07] you realize we're not talking about the
[1:55:09] manifestation of christ in jesus christ
[1:55:11] we're talking about the manifestation of
[1:55:12] christ
[1:55:13] and a fallen human being paul the
[1:55:15] apostle who's a persecutor of the church
[1:55:17] who was grabbed at his appointed time
[1:55:19] and revealed who he really was
[1:55:22] and he could say that god the world will
[1:55:25] be judged god will judge you by the
[1:55:26] gospel that i have preached he says by
[1:55:30] my gospel
[1:55:33] why because it wasn't his gospel amen it
[1:55:36] was the gospel that he'd received on the
[1:55:37] back side of the desert
[1:55:38] it was the revelation of the word it was
[1:55:40] the word of god but it was coming from
[1:55:42] his lips
[1:55:43] so he say my words my gospel the things
[1:55:45] that i have said
[1:55:47] and that's why you can say the things
[1:55:48] this is the words that i get it's not my
[1:55:50] words it's his words but he's
[1:55:51] he's chosen to speak it through this
[1:55:53] vessel
[1:55:55] and these words that i speak unto you
[1:55:58] they are eternal life
[1:56:02] amen what what brother ben is preaching
[1:56:05] is not something foreign to the word
[1:56:07] it's something
[1:56:07] right out of the word it's foreign to
[1:56:10] our minds
[1:56:12] it's foreign to our spirit realm but
[1:56:15] it's not
[1:56:15] foreign to the word
[1:56:19] that's why that's why
[1:56:22] the revelation of who we are in this day
[1:56:25] is so key first the revelation of who is
[1:56:29] christ
[1:56:30] who is jesus christ he's the word the
[1:56:33] word
[1:56:33] made manifest then who am i
[1:56:37] i'm the same thing
[1:56:42] not because i made myself not because i
[1:56:44] appointed myself not because i agreed
[1:56:46] because he already chose before the
[1:56:48] foundation of the world i finally have
[1:56:49] just come to myself
[1:56:52] i find myself in a pig pen eating pig
[1:56:54] slop
[1:56:56] one day in the world trapped in all the
[1:56:58] darkness and all of a sudden i came to
[1:57:00] myself
[1:57:01] and i realized i have a father
[1:57:04] i don't have to live like this i will go
[1:57:07] back into my father
[1:57:10] praise god and when that young man come
[1:57:12] back to his father
[1:57:13] what did he get he said i'm not worthy
[1:57:16] to be a servant i'm not worthy to be no
[1:57:18] more called your son make me a servant
[1:57:19] i'll work for you
[1:57:20] and he come back and we come back with
[1:57:22] the attitude sometimes i'm not worthy i
[1:57:24] i'll just be a servant but he says give
[1:57:26] him a robe
[1:57:27] give him a ring amen slay the beast amen
[1:57:30] he's not come back as a servant this is
[1:57:32] my son
[1:57:33] and i've given him a position by the
[1:57:35] signet ring of power
[1:57:36] and authority when he speaks it's the
[1:57:38] same as me speaking
[1:57:41] [Music]
[1:57:44] we have to get we have to quit acting
[1:57:47] pious and religious and and absolutely
[1:57:50] all it is is denying the word we have to
[1:57:52] get comfortable saying this isn't pride
[1:57:54] this isn't arrogance
[1:57:55] in fact sometimes when i say these
[1:57:56] things it is absolutely
[1:57:58] ripping me to shreds because i know the
[1:58:00] reality of what i am in the flesh
[1:58:02] and there's no good thing and i know my
[1:58:04] mistakes and i know my favorites and
[1:58:05] it's not
[1:58:06] comfortable sometimes for me to say
[1:58:07] these things but i say it because it's
[1:58:09] nothing but the truth and if i allow
[1:58:12] myself to be
[1:58:13] be held back and if i allow the
[1:58:15] manifestation of christ in my life to be
[1:58:17] held back
[1:58:18] because of all the things that go on in
[1:58:20] my hybridization and my
[1:58:21] my confusion and my doubts and my
[1:58:23] backslidings and my mistakes and all
[1:58:25] that
[1:58:25] then i will never be any good to the
[1:58:28] people that are around
[1:58:29] me but i have to deny that as a false
[1:58:32] life and i have to deny that
[1:58:35] is is an imposter of who i really am
[1:58:38] and i've got to identify with the real
[1:58:39] me on the inside
[1:58:41] the true me and that's the portion i
[1:58:44] identify with
[1:58:45] and that's what i'll speak
[1:58:49] praise god let's just practice saying
[1:58:52] what the word says
[1:58:55] and let god have this way man let's pray
[1:58:59] [Music]
[1:59:01] lord jesus we thank you lord
[1:59:04] for speaking unto us so clearly lord
[1:59:08] these are things lord these are
[1:59:11] statements with consequences
[1:59:14] these are revelations lord that bring
[1:59:16] impact

[1:59:26] but this is meat lord for eagles for
[1:59:28] this is an eagle day

[1:59:33] immature

[1:59:36] because your bride has come to full
[1:59:38] maturity

[1:59:42] take this meat lord

[1:59:46] one with us

[2:00:04] live these are the things i'm supposed
[2:00:06] to believe
[2:00:09] god we know that we can't do it lord
[2:00:12] when we look at ourselves as human
[2:00:14] beings we know that all we'll do is ruin
[2:00:16] your plan if we're
[2:00:17] left up to us so you didn't leave it up
[2:00:20] to us
[2:00:21] lord god you sent your spirit
[2:00:25] the spirit was the birth the seed that's
[2:00:27] within us and now it's not us living

[2:00:33] yield to it

[2:00:37] to express
[2:00:38] and freedom to move and freedom to take
[2:00:40] over
[2:00:42] we love you lord forgive us lord for our
[2:00:44] failings and our wanderings
[2:00:47] give us the boldness to declare what
[2:00:49] your word says
[2:00:51] i pray if there's anyone around us lord
[2:00:54] who needs the words of eternal life
[2:00:56] that you would allow us to speak it with
[2:00:58] our lives and to speak it with our
[2:00:59] mouths
[2:01:01] may life be imparted into someone else
[2:01:04] help us to fully embrace what you've
[2:01:06] called us and who you told us we are
[2:01:08] and help us to yield ourselves in a
[2:01:10] fuller measure to that reality
[2:01:12] and to walk in it to live in it
[2:01:15] love your father and i ask that you
[2:01:17] would move on us as we go out from here
[2:01:19] let us go different than we came in let
[2:01:22] our eyes be clearer by the eye salve
[2:01:24] that you've rubbed into them this
[2:01:26] morning

[2:01:32] and may you accomplish through us
