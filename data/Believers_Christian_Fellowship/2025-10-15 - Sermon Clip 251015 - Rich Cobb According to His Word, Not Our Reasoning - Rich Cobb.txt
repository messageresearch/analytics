TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God heals cancer. We We have a family that has a friend who who had cancer and they had her at the house and and this this woman that had the cancer was a registered nurse and and she had taken care of charity when she was in the hospital and another sister at the church when she was in the hospital. And so she'd done a lot of good things for the bride. And so her husband was there with her at our friend's house and and so they asked could we come and pray for him. So at communion that Sunday, we took a prayer cloth, we all prayed over it, went there to the house and and they're they're of another flavor of religion that, you know, may not really believe about healing. And so we talked about taking the the things from the aprons from the body of Paul and and everything else about laying on of hands. Amen. And so we began to pray and the presence of God just came down mightily. And one of the brothers looked at me and says, "He's here." I said, "Yeah, I know." But here's the lesson. That's good. And you're going to say, "Brother, you're really going to say this?" Yeah, I'm going to say this. This is greater than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I enjoy that. Don't we enjoy those times? &gt;&gt; We're nothing against that. &gt;&gt; But I want people to see this was the absolute of why she's now cancer free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stage four cancer gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The husband was kind of lerary of me at first and afterwards I go to shake his hand. He goes, "Come here." And we're so fat. It was just like, "Come here." Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was his word that did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.
