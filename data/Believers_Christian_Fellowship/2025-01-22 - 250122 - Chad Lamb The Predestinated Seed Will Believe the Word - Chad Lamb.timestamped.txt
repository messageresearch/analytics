[7:57] amen amen God bless you all while we're
[8:00] standing this evening let's just take
[8:02] our Bibles and turn to the Book of John
[8:04] John chapter 4 and say it's good to have
[8:07] brother Gabe and his family back we're
[8:09] glad they made it back safe up in the
[8:10] Cleveland area and I've asked brother
[8:12] Gabe to take the Sunday service for us
[8:14] this Sunday so we were getting a little
[8:16] envious he's been preaching for
[8:17] everybody else we thought we have a
[8:19] right too amen so we've asked him to
[8:21] take the service and he he agreed so
[8:23] he'll be doing
[8:25] that amen it's good to see you all here
[8:28] I'm glad you all are not fren amen it's
[8:30] been nice and cold but God's been good
[8:32] amen nice and warm in here so we thank
[8:35] God for that amen let's look at John
[8:38] chapter
[8:39] 4 verse
[8:46] 46 John 4:46 it says so Jesus came again
[8:50] into canaa of Galilee where he made the
[8:53] water wine and there was a certain
[8:55] nobleman whose son was sick at capernium
[8:57] when he heard that Jesus was was come
[8:59] out of Judea into Galilee he went unto
[9:02] him and besought him that he should come
[9:04] down and heal his son for he was at the
[9:06] point of death then said Jesus unto him
[9:10] except you see signs and wonders you
[9:12] will not believe the noble man saith
[9:14] unto him sir come down air my child die
[9:17] Jesus said unto him go thy way thy son
[9:20] liveth and the man believed the word
[9:22] that Jesus had spoken unto him and he
[9:24] went his way and as he was now going
[9:26] down his servant met him and told him
[9:28] saying thy son liveth then inquired he
[9:31] of of them the hour when he began to
[9:34] amend and they said unto him yesterday
[9:36] at the seventh hour the fever left him
[9:38] so the father knew that it was at the
[9:40] same hour in which Jesus said unto him
[9:43] thy son liveth and himself believed in
[9:45] his whole house amen God be praised may
[9:48] you have your seats now and may God
[9:51] bless us as we look into his word I want
[9:54] to highlight a few things in this uh
[9:56] before we move on to another scripture I
[9:58] I I want to go back up to verse 48 when
[10:02] the man asked Jesus to come and heal his
[10:04] son who is at the point of death then
[10:07] Jesus said unto him except you see signs
[10:09] and wonders you will not believe man
[10:11] that's a uh interesting thing brother
[10:13] benam says or Jesus says because uh this
[10:17] man comes and says will you heal my son
[10:18] who's now at the point of death and his
[10:20] response to that is except you see signs
[10:24] and wonders you will not believe he
[10:27] wanted him to come and lay hands on him
[10:28] or do what whatever he would do pray for
[10:30] him and raise up his son and this is
[10:32] Jesus's response and whenever I see a
[10:33] response like this it's always curious
[10:35] to me why he responds his way there's
[10:37] something that that Jesus is addressing
[10:39] there's something that he's
[10:41] understanding he's wanting to highlight
[10:42] and and make visible and this man says
[10:44] come down and heal my son come down and
[10:48] heal my son for he was at the point of
[10:50] death then said Jesus unto him except
[10:52] you see signs and wonders you should not
[10:54] believe then the noble man addresses him
[10:56] again he says unto him sir come down he
[10:59] my child die and Jesus said unto him go
[11:03] thy way thy son liveth and the man
[11:06] believed the word that Jesus said unto
[11:08] him that Jesus had spoken unto him and
[11:11] he went his way this is the most
[11:13] critical part of the whole thing to me
[11:15] amen he says come down and heal my son
[11:18] and Jesus said unless you see a a
[11:20] miracle or a sign you'll not believe and
[11:23] he says please come down and heal my son
[11:26] a he die and he says thy son liveth
[11:29] he he didn't do what the man said the
[11:31] man saying come down and heal my son
[11:34] physically come to the scene physically
[11:36] come and show up and do something that I
[11:38] can see that you lay hands you can pray
[11:40] you come to my house amen and you heal
[11:42] my son and and and Jesus says that's
[11:45] unless you see a sign or a wonder you
[11:48] won't even believe but the man implored
[11:50] again please come down he he die and
[11:54] Jesus said thy son liveth in the next
[11:56] verse the man believed
[12:00] the man believed the word that Jesus had
[12:03] spoken unto him and he went his way and
[12:05] as he went then his servant comes and he
[12:08] begins to tell him hey your son's alive
[12:10] and he questions him what hour amen was
[12:12] he made better he said the seventh
[12:15] hour just like in the seventh age the
[12:18] seventh hour and he realized amen he
[12:21] realized it was the same hour in which
[12:23] Jesus says thy son liveth and so now he
[12:25] realized that it was the word that did
[12:28] it it wasn't it wasn't Jesus coming
[12:30] physically on the scene but when he
[12:32] spoke the word he believed the word and
[12:34] it was the word that did the work and
[12:36] his faith in the word and when he when
[12:38] he caught and in the seventh hour it was
[12:41] the spoken word amen that did the
[12:43] healing then he realized and he
[12:47] believed you Lord praise God Amen we
[12:50] could take that so so to where we're at
[12:52] today amen cuz so many times when we
[12:54] have a problem we say God come down
[12:56] would you come down and heal us will you
[12:58] come down and deliver will you come down
[13:00] come down what do we mean by come down
[13:03] where is he amen what we need is Faith
[13:06] in his
[13:08] word praise God Almighty amen for a
[13:12] subject tonight I'd like to just take
[13:14] the the predestinated seed will believe
[13:16] the
[13:17] word and you'll see as we go through why
[13:21] we started with this scripture and what
[13:22] meant so much to me oh if we could just
[13:25] get the same if we could come to the
[13:26] same place amen where When God says it
[13:28] we believe it it's
[13:30] done we don't need anything
[13:33] else in the in the message brother BR
[13:36] says in the message the angel in the
[13:38] commission from back in
[13:40] 1950 he talks about the angel of the
[13:42] Lord coming to him and he could feel the
[13:44] presence of the Angel when he went to
[13:46] prayer and he makes this statement he
[13:48] said I knew it was still there but I
[13:49] didn't know why I waited I guess 5
[13:52] minutes passed I felt it moving closer
[13:54] to me and when it did I just heard the
[13:56] voice sound like way back I could not
[13:59] personate the voice if I had to but I
[14:01] heard it just as plain and audible as my
[14:03] voice is to you said you're confining
[14:06] too much of that gift of healing to
[14:08] perform Miracles it will come to pass
[14:11] that people will not believe you unless
[14:13] there's a miracle
[14:14] performed so this was the warning of the
[14:16] Angel of the Lord to the prophet he says
[14:19] now and brother brandham he talks about
[14:20] this in several places and I mentioned
[14:22] it to you the time we ministered before
[14:24] that brother bam and his campaign
[14:25] managers were having Miracle lines and
[14:28] they were bringing the wor and they said
[14:29] we want the worst cases you got bring
[14:31] them through first and we want things
[14:33] that are visible we want de we want
[14:35] those in wheelchairs we want that's what
[14:36] we want and what they were what the
[14:38] attempt was the attempt was that if
[14:41] people see the Miracles amen they'll
[14:43] believe
[14:45] right and so that's that's why they had
[14:48] adapted uh adapted that practice amen
[14:51] that's why they began to do the miracle
[14:53] lines and God warned him and after God
[14:55] warned him brother bham still did one we
[14:56] spoke of this before and it was
[14:58] disastrous he did a miracle line amen
[15:01] and and and he prayed for a little girl
[15:03] that was hard of hearing she went
[15:04] completely deaf yeah prayed for a man
[15:06] that was hard of hearing he went
[15:08] completely deaf and brother M knew he
[15:09] was wrong he had to go and repent
[15:11] because this was the warning he had and
[15:13] what was God doing God was trying to
[15:15] break that wrong understanding and the
[15:17] wrong understanding is if they see
[15:19] Miracles they'll believe but what the
[15:21] angel was telling him is you're training
[15:23] the people to only believe if they see a
[15:26] miracle yeah not to just take it based
[15:29] on the word amen just because his word
[15:32] says but now unless there's a miracle
[15:34] performed the people won't believe
[15:36] unless there's a miracle performed and
[15:38] that was the warning of the Angel and
[15:40] that's what Jesus also
[15:42] said let's go to Matthew 16
[15:59] Matthew
[16:01] 16 verse
[16:05] 1 says the Pharisees also with Sadducees
[16:09] came with the Sadducees came
[16:11] tempting Desiring him that he would show
[16:13] them a sign from Heaven he answered and
[16:16] said unto them when it is evening you
[16:18] say it will be fair weather for the sky
[16:20] is red in the morning it will be foul
[16:22] weather today for the sky is red and
[16:24] lowering oh you Hypocrites you can
[16:26] discern the face of the sky but you
[16:28] cannot discern the signs of the times a
[16:31] wicked and adulterous generation seeketh
[16:33] after a sign and there shall be no sign
[16:35] be given unto it but the sign of the
[16:38] Prophet Jonas and he left them and
[16:41] departed and so they ask for a sign and
[16:45] Jesus won't give them a
[16:47] sign they want a sign amen but Jesus
[16:51] knows these are the Pharisees and
[16:53] Sadducees he knows that he can give them
[16:55] a sign but a sign won't cause them to
[16:57] believe yes that a wicked and adulterous
[17:00] generation seeketh after a sign and none
[17:03] will be given them but the sign of Jonas
[17:05] what was the sign of Jonas death and
[17:07] Resurrection amen Jonas was in the belly
[17:09] of the whale and he resurrected and he
[17:11] went and preached but the sign of Jonas
[17:14] was not just the resurrection from the
[17:15] dead it was also going and preaching to
[17:17] the Gentiles and seeing the Gentiles
[17:19] believe and that was the sign that was
[17:21] given to that Wicked and adulterous
[17:23] generation they wanted they wanted to
[17:25] see a sign in order to believe or they
[17:28] they were we're going to make Jesus
[17:30] prove by signs amen that what he said
[17:32] was true and they said you can't even
[17:34] discern the season that you're in you
[17:36] can discern natural things but you can't
[17:38] even discern spiritual things because
[17:40] it's already been declared to you the
[17:42] season that we're in so what will a sign
[17:45] do for you
[17:47] nothing man let's go back in to Exodus
[17:50] so I just want to lay those scriptures
[17:52] down as a foundation for where we want
[17:53] to go let's go into Exodus
[17:56] now and look at the life of Moses for
[17:58] just just a little
[18:00] bit Exodus chap
[18:12] 4 Exodus chapter
[18:15] 4 and verse
[18:17] one this is Moses on the back side of
[18:20] the desert he's he's speaking to God out
[18:22] of the burning bush and Moses answered
[18:25] and said but behold they will not
[18:27] believe me nor hearken into my voice for
[18:29] they will say the Lord hath not appeared
[18:31] unto thee and the Lord said unto him
[18:34] what is that in thine hand and he said a
[18:35] rod and he said cast it on the ground
[18:38] and he cast it on the ground and it
[18:39] became a serpent and Moses fled from
[18:41] before it and the Lord said unto Moses
[18:43] put forth thine hand and take it by the
[18:45] tail and he put forth his hand and
[18:46] caught it and it became a rod in his
[18:49] hand that that they may believe that the
[18:52] Lord God of their fathers the god of
[18:54] Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of
[18:56] Jacob hath appeared unto thee and the
[18:59] Lord said furthermore unto him put now
[19:01] thine hand in thy bosom and he put his
[19:03] hand into his bosom and when he took it
[19:05] out behold his hand was leprous as snow
[19:09] and he said put thine hand into thy
[19:10] bosom again and he put his hand into his
[19:12] bosom again and plucked it out of his
[19:15] bosom and behold it was turned again as
[19:17] the other flesh and it shall come to
[19:19] pass if they will not believe thee
[19:21] neither hearken to the voice of the
[19:23] first sign that they will believe the
[19:24] voice of the latter sign and it shall
[19:28] come to pass if they will not believe
[19:30] also these two signs neither hearken
[19:32] unto thy voice that thou shalt take of
[19:34] the water of the river and pour it upon
[19:36] the dry land and the water which thou
[19:37] takest out of the river shall become
[19:39] blood upon the dry land so Moses now
[19:43] going down to the children of Israel
[19:45] he's going down because it's the time of
[19:47] Deliverance he's going down because God
[19:48] has given him a message to deliver to
[19:51] them that now it's time to go take the
[19:53] promise and as he goes amen God calls
[19:55] him down and he says they won't believe
[19:57] me and so God says so that they'll know
[19:59] that you met God so that they'll know
[20:01] that you're that you're my mouthpiece I
[20:03] will give you a sign and he told him to
[20:05] throw the rod down and he did and he
[20:07] told him to pluck his hand into his
[20:08] bosom and pull it out it was leprous and
[20:10] he did it again it was white as snow and
[20:12] then he gave him a third sign if they
[20:13] don't believe those two that he would
[20:15] pour water out of the river onto dry
[20:16] ground and it would turn blood so God
[20:19] gave these three signs and what were the
[20:21] signs to do the signs were to vindicate
[20:24] Moses yeah they were to vindicate Moses
[20:27] that Moses had met God and that Moses
[20:30] had a message from
[20:32] God that's what the signs were to do it
[20:34] was a Vindication that Moses had met God
[20:37] on the back side of the desert amen
[20:39] because Moses anybody can come out and
[20:40] said I met God yeah time for deliverance
[20:43] but God would vindicate that this is my
[20:46] mouthpiece I sent him and I gave him a
[20:49] message now hear his
[20:52] message
[20:54] amen and and so I want to look at a
[20:56] couple more scriptures and then let's go
[20:58] to one more uh Exodus
[21:04] 14 Exodus
[21:08] 14 and
[21:11] 29 we know that Moses went to Israel
[21:14] showed the signs uh uh obeyed the Lord
[21:17] brought the plagues uh got the
[21:20] Deliverance LED them out with a mighty
[21:22] hand then they found themselves at the
[21:25] banks of the Red Sea with the Moses's or
[21:26] with Pharaoh's Army coming down upon
[21:29] them and and we'll pick up the story in
[21:31] verse 29 uh 14:29 but the children of
[21:34] Israel walked upon dry land in the midst
[21:36] of the Sea and the waters were a wall
[21:38] unto them on their right hand and on
[21:40] their left thus the Lord saved Israel
[21:43] that day out of the hand of the
[21:45] Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians
[21:47] dead upon the seashore and Israel saw
[21:50] that great work which the Lord did upon
[21:52] the Egyptians and the people feared the
[21:54] Lord and believed the Lord and his
[21:57] servant mother
[21:59] Moses I think I'd believe
[22:02] too they they they had just went through
[22:05] the 10 plagues they had seen uh uh Egypt
[22:09] wiped out they were affected by the
[22:11] first several plagues but then after
[22:13] that they saw that there was a
[22:14] separation between Goan and a separation
[22:17] between the Egyptians and then they were
[22:18] preserved under the shed blood and the
[22:20] atonement of an innocent lamb under the
[22:23] last plague and then they were sent out
[22:25] and they had spoiled Egypt and they they
[22:27] took all the gold and all the vessels
[22:28] and all the garments and that they could
[22:30] carry and they went out amen as a mighty
[22:32] conquering Army and they saw all of this
[22:35] through the servant Moses and knew that
[22:37] it was God working through this man then
[22:39] they get to a a tight spot when they get
[22:42] pinched in against the against the water
[22:44] against the sea and against the cliffs
[22:45] and the army of pharaoh coming down to
[22:47] destroy them and they see the pillar of
[22:50] fire go and stand between them and the
[22:52] enemy to to hold them back amen and then
[22:55] then Moses reaches forth his hand with
[22:57] the rod and the Red Sea parts right down
[23:00] the midle and stands up as a wall on
[23:03] either side and they all walk down into
[23:05] the water not on soggy moist ground that
[23:08] had been covered by water for how many
[23:09] hundreds or thousands years amen but
[23:11] they walked across on dry ground right
[23:14] and as they walked across the wall the
[23:17] water was a wall on their left hand and
[23:19] a wall on their right hand they could
[23:21] look right into the water and sometimes
[23:24] I wonder you know as a child I wonder
[23:25] could they see fish right
[23:28] yeah they were looking right they were
[23:30] looking into the Red Sea standing on dry
[23:34] ground and a wall on either side and
[23:36] they come out the other side two million
[23:38] people pass through amen and then the
[23:41] pillar of fire removed and then
[23:43] Pharaoh's Army came down and they saw
[23:45] the sea when when Pharaoh extended his
[23:47] arms again the sea crash back down and
[23:49] wipe out the Egyptian Army and they
[23:52] belied the Lord and they believed
[23:55] Moses there's no way you couldn't uhhuh
[23:58] yes
[23:59] yeah well let's go to Exodus
[24:06] 16 this is
[24:08] approximately a month
[24:10] later 30 some days
[24:14] later and they took their Journey 16
[24:16] verse1 they took their Journey from Elum
[24:19] and all the congregation of the children
[24:21] of Israel came into the Wilderness of
[24:22] sin which is between Elum and Si on the
[24:26] 15th day of the 2 month after their
[24:28] depart departure out of the land of
[24:29] Egypt and the whole Congregation of the
[24:32] children of Israel murmured against
[24:33] Moses and Aaron in the
[24:35] wilderness and the children of Israel
[24:37] said unto them would to God we had died
[24:40] by the hand of the Lord in the land of
[24:41] Egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and
[24:44] when we did eat bread to the fool for
[24:46] you have brought us forth into this
[24:48] Wilderness to kill this whole assembly
[24:51] with
[24:54] Hunger I thought they believed the
[24:57] Lord and
[25:04] Moses after walking through the Red Sea
[25:08] and then all the things that led up to
[25:09] that
[25:11] event a miracle Beyond any miracle that
[25:15] we could think
[25:17] of and they're completely delivered and
[25:20] here 30 or 30 some days later when
[25:24] they're hungry and they don't have any
[25:26] food and all the food that they brought
[25:28] with them had expired had run out been
[25:32] consumed they tell Moses I wish to God
[25:36] we had died in the land of
[25:38] Egypt when we sat by the fleshing pots
[25:43] and when we that did eat bread to the
[25:47] fool for you have brought us forth into
[25:50] this Wilderness to kill this whole
[25:52] assembly with
[25:56] Hunger see what we realize very quickly
[26:00] here is that Miracles never produce
[26:03] genuine
[26:05] Faith it's been proved all through the
[26:08] scriptures yeah because they believed
[26:11] the Lord and they believed Moses of
[26:13] course they could not believe they
[26:14] believed Moses held his Rod out and they
[26:16] believed the Lord parted the waters they
[26:18] believe they walked on dry ground they
[26:19] believe they got to the other side they
[26:22] believed that Pharaoh's Army was
[26:23] consumed in the waters and died they
[26:25] believed all of that they didn't doubt
[26:27] it but here they doubted the message
[26:30] that Moses brought and they failed to
[26:33] understand that the Miracles that Moses
[26:35] worked were the Vindication that God
[26:37] gave that Moses was the mouthpiece so
[26:39] when Moses threw down the rod and picked
[26:41] it up again when Moses put his hand on
[26:43] his bosom pulled it out when he poured
[26:45] water out turned to blood and then all
[26:47] the plagues they were there to vindicate
[26:49] that Moses had the word of God so that
[26:52] the people would believe the words that
[26:54] came out of Moses's mouth and they
[26:57] believed all all the signs and all the
[27:00] Wonders but they failed to believe the
[27:07] words more signs wouldn't have helped
[27:09] these people more wonders wouldn't have
[27:11] helped these but you can't do
[27:14] anymore what more could you
[27:16] do they don't need more signs they don't
[27:19] need more wonders they don't need more
[27:21] what they need is faith in the word of
[27:23] God and that's what they did not have
[27:26] they had faith in the Miracles they had
[27:27] faith in the power of God they had faith
[27:29] in the prophet of God but they did not
[27:31] have faith in the word of God because
[27:33] the word of God was God has come to
[27:36] deliver you and take you back to the
[27:38] land that he promised to your father
[27:39] Abraham yeah that was the word of the
[27:42] Lord and their testimony here proved
[27:44] they did not believe the word of the
[27:45] Lord but they believed all of the
[27:51] Miracles oh praise
[27:54] God what is it God wants us to believe
[27:57] the word
[28:00] right believe all of the Miracles and
[28:02] still missed the whole point yeah
[28:08] righten it's like this all through the
[28:10] Wilderness Journey it's terrible for
[28:12] poor
[28:14] Moses Moses goes from hero to zero to
[28:17] hero to zero and everything in between
[28:20] and and poor Moses he's dealing with
[28:23] he's dealing with unbelieving Believers
[28:27] yeah that's
[28:29] right believe in
[28:31] God believe that Moses is a prophet a
[28:34] servant of God believe the power of God
[28:37] believe the Miracles of God and they
[28:38] believe Moses can do it because every
[28:40] time they get in trouble they tell Moses
[28:41] to do something else because they know
[28:43] that the power of God resides in Moses
[28:45] yeah but they they through the entire
[28:48] Journey they proved that they did not
[28:50] believe Moses's message yeah
[28:56] Amen brother B says in the message
[28:58] proving his word he said only two of
[29:00] them believed
[29:01] it that was Joshua and Caleb and they
[29:04] brought back the evidence that the land
[29:05] was good but the circumstances was that
[29:09] was what hindered them he's talking
[29:11] about the other 10 because they were not
[29:13] able to take the land because their
[29:14] cities were walled their people are
[29:16] great Giants why we look like
[29:18] grasshoppers up aside of them Joshua and
[29:20] Caleb said we are more than able to take
[29:22] it why God had give it to them no matter
[29:25] how big the giant was they obstacle
[29:28] meant nothing to them God had said so
[29:30] and God proved it by
[29:32] them how did God prove it by Joshua and
[29:35] Caleb because later they would go in and
[29:37] take the land amen because they believed
[29:40] and they did go over and take the land
[29:42] and God said they would do it he proved
[29:44] it to them so here you had and all the
[29:47] company amen that had come out through
[29:49] the through the Wilderness Journey
[29:50] Through the plagues in Egypt through the
[29:52] signs through the Wonders through
[29:53] everything that happened you had two
[29:55] that actually believe the word of the
[29:57] Lord amen the other however many
[29:59] hundreds and hundreds of thousands and
[30:01] millions they believe the the power of
[30:03] God they believe the sign of God they
[30:06] believe the Wonder of God they believe
[30:08] the gift of God but they did not believe
[30:11] the word of
[30:13] God my
[30:15] goodness Amen in the Smur and church age
[30:20] out of the church age book brother says
[30:22] this they are like the children of
[30:24] Israel who came out of Egypt and stopped
[30:26] short of the promised land now now those
[30:28] children of Israel left Egypt about 2
[30:30] million strong they all journeyed
[30:32] together all saw the same miracles of
[30:34] god all partook of the same man and
[30:36] water from the smitten rock all followed
[30:38] the same Cloud by day and the pillar of
[30:40] Fire by night but only two reached the
[30:43] promised land only two were true or real
[30:47] Believers yeah that is correct because
[30:50] the word tells us that the rest died
[30:52] because of unbelief and because of
[30:54] unbelief they could not enter Hebrews 3
[30:56] 3:19 then since that is so and only two
[30:59] entered then the rest were not true
[31:02] believers what made the difference two
[31:04] stayed with the
[31:06] word when the hearts of the 10 spies
[31:08] failed at kades barnea Joshua and Caleb
[31:11] did not stagger for they believed the
[31:12] word and said we are more than able to
[31:15] take the land they knew they could
[31:16] because God had said I have given you
[31:19] the land how did they know listen Joshua
[31:22] and Caleb saw the same wall cities and
[31:24] the same Giants and the same armor and
[31:26] the same instruments of war they saw
[31:28] everything else that the 10 spies saw
[31:30] the difference was they actually
[31:32] believed the words that had come out of
[31:33] Moses's mouth were from God they
[31:36] actually believed the word of the Lord
[31:38] they actually heard the message that
[31:40] Moses brought not just saw the Miracles
[31:42] but they heard the message and they
[31:43] believ the message and they knew that
[31:45] they were able to take the land not
[31:48] because they themselves were able to
[31:50] take the land but they were able because
[31:52] God said he gave it to them
[31:57] praise
[31:59] God I'm going to read that again they
[32:01] knew they could because God had said I
[32:04] have given you the land after all those
[32:06] Israelites solve the power and goodness
[32:08] and deliverance of God they did not
[32:10] enter into rest which is a type of the
[32:13] Holy Ghost let's go to Hebrews 3 and
[32:16] actually read this
[32:17] reference the prophet of God referenced
[32:19] here Hebrews chapter
[32:23] 3 when I read these things and hear what
[32:25] the brother said I absolutely Marvel
[32:27] friends
[32:28] I Marvel because you would think listen
[32:32] we still think the same thing today amen
[32:34] we've got somebody that that we we want
[32:36] to believe or we we wish they would
[32:38] believe we just want so bad God to show
[32:40] them a miracle so that they'll believe
[32:42] amen if God shows them a miracle they
[32:44] may believe the miracle but the real
[32:46] challenge amen is to believe the
[32:48] word that's where the real predestinated
[32:51] C Gene of God will believe that word all
[32:54] the way through to the end they won't
[32:55] reject the Miracles either they'll
[32:56] believe the Miracles yes but they'll
[32:58] believe the Miracles but they believe
[33:00] the word
[33:02] am amen so in Hebrews chapter
[33:07] 3 verse 7 we'll start at verse 7
[33:11] wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today
[33:14] if you will hear his voice Harden not
[33:16] your hearts as in the day of provocation
[33:18] and the day of Temptation in the
[33:19] wilderness when your father's tempted me
[33:22] proved me and saw my Works 40 years
[33:26] wherefore I was grieved with that
[33:27] generation and said they do always air
[33:29] in their heart and they have not known
[33:31] my ways so I swear in my wrath they
[33:34] shall not enter into my rest take heed
[33:37] Brethren lest there be in any of you an
[33:39] evil heart of unbelief and departing
[33:41] from the Living God but exhort one
[33:43] another daily what is called today lest
[33:47] any of you be hardened through the
[33:48] deceitfulness of sin for we are made
[33:51] partakers of Christ if if we hold the
[33:53] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[33:55] Until the End while it is said
[33:59] today if you will hear his voice Harden
[34:01] not your hearts as in the provocation
[34:03] for some when they heard did provoke how
[34:05] be it not all that came out of Egypt by
[34:07] Moses but with whom was he grieved 40
[34:09] years was it not with them that had
[34:11] sinned whose carcus carcasses fell in
[34:14] the wilderness and to whom swear he that
[34:17] they should not enter into his rest but
[34:18] to them that believed not so we see that
[34:21] they could not enter in because of
[34:25] unbelief so what was the sin
[34:30] unbelief what was the sin that kept him
[34:32] out of the prominis land
[34:33] unbelief unbelief in what Moses was a
[34:36] prophet of God no they believed that
[34:38] right amen unbelief in God no they
[34:40] believed in God unbelief in the power of
[34:43] God no they beli they believed in the
[34:44] power of God they believ God brought
[34:46] them out they believed in the Miracles
[34:47] they believed in the signs they believed
[34:49] in the Wonders they believed that they
[34:50] passed through the Red Sea yeah right
[34:53] they believed that they drank water from
[34:55] the rock they believe that God provided
[34:58] Mana every morning they believed that
[35:00] the quail came out of the air they
[35:01] belied that when they looked to the
[35:02] Brazen serpent they were healed from the
[35:04] snake bite they believed all of that y
[35:07] amen yet they
[35:10] sinned through unbelief
[35:14] yeah what was the sin of unbelief it was
[35:16] kades
[35:18] Baria when they did not believe that
[35:20] they could take the land
[35:24] yep listen if you and I as beings were
[35:28] standing there looking at the wall
[35:29] cities the Giants and the Armament and
[35:31] all that we wouldn't believe we could
[35:32] take the land
[35:33] either amen so let's not be too hard on
[35:36] the 10 spies I mean we would be the same
[35:39] way I mean here we are we're slaves just
[35:41] a little while before marching now
[35:43] through the Wilderness being kept by the
[35:45] power of God but no armor no armorment
[35:47] no no training no anything you were just
[35:49] slaves you knew how to make bricks and
[35:51] do whatever else the Egyptians had you
[35:52] doing and now you've got to organize
[35:54] yourself into some Army and take the
[35:55] land with the walled cities with with
[35:57] Giants and everything else in the land
[35:59] amen if you would look at it with
[36:01] natural eyes with natural ability you
[36:03] would come to the same conclusion I
[36:04] cannot do
[36:06] this that's why Joshua and Caleb had to
[36:09] have a different heart in them they had
[36:11] to have a heart of a predestinated c
[36:13] Gene of God with the capacity inside
[36:16] them by the faith that was gifted to
[36:17] them by the father God to believe that
[36:20] what God Said was
[36:22] true and they believed it because Moses
[36:25] said it amen but they believed Moses cuz
[36:27] Moses was Vindicated by the signs and
[36:29] the Wonders yeah amen cuz that was the
[36:33] purpose of the signs and the Wonders was
[36:34] to vindicate Moses is the mouthpiece of
[36:37] God and these two
[36:40] believed
[36:41] amen I should say this way they believe
[36:44] the purpose of the signs and the
[36:48] Wonders so all that God did to one
[36:52] generation of people to one people you
[36:54] think about this uh H uh large multitude
[36:57] of people that came out of Egypt and and
[37:00] everything that they witnessed
[37:03] firsthand the manner they chewed and
[37:06] tasted the water they drank the sea they
[37:10] walked in the midst of the army they saw
[37:13] destroyed the the quail that they were
[37:16] provide everything I mean it's
[37:18] absolutely unbelievable friends it's
[37:20] it's it's off the charts for one group
[37:23] of people one generation to see that
[37:25] much Supernatural
[37:28] and at the end of it all they all died
[37:31] in the wilderness because of unbelief
[37:33] right
[37:37] yeah my my my I said God I'm a Believer
[37:43] help me God help me to look to the right
[37:47] thing let's go to uh John chapter 20
[37:59] John chapter
[38:12] 20 John chapter
[38:14] 20 and let's go to verse
[38:18] 24 but Thomas one of the 12 called dimus
[38:21] was not with them when Jesus came the
[38:24] other disciples therefore said unto him
[38:25] we have seen the Lord but he said unto
[38:28] them except I shall see in his hands the
[38:30] print of his nails and put my finger
[38:32] into the print of the nails and thrust
[38:34] my hand into his side I will not believe
[38:37] and after eight days again his disciples
[38:39] were within and Thomas with them then
[38:41] came Jesus the doors being shut and
[38:43] stood in the midst and said Peace be
[38:45] unto you then saith he unto Thomas reach
[38:48] hither thy finger and behold my hands
[38:50] and reach hither thy hand and thrust it
[38:52] into my side and be not faithless but
[38:55] believing and Thomas answered and said
[38:57] to him my Lord and my God Jesus say unto
[39:00] him Thomas because thou Hast seen me
[39:03] thou Hast believed blessed are they that
[39:06] have not seen and yet have
[39:11] believed so here's a question I'll ask
[39:14] you it's not fair because I already read
[39:15] the scripture and you know too much but
[39:18] just to ask a question which would you
[39:20] in your Humanity say was more blessed to
[39:24] touch the prince of his hands
[39:27] and believe or never have seen the nail
[39:30] scarred body in
[39:33] belief what did Jesus say where the
[39:35] blessing was he said blessed are those
[39:38] who have not seen and yet
[39:41] believe amen so praise God we're among
[39:45] the
[39:46] blessed but we in our in our Humanity we
[39:49] think it would be
[39:51] better yes I would I would if if I would
[39:54] see that I would never disbelieve
[39:57] what about walking through two walls of
[39:59] water on dry ground when the Red Sea
[40:01] parted I would never
[40:03] disbelieve what about seeing a man Smite
[40:05] a rock and see water gushing out enough
[40:08] to to to water two million people plus
[40:10] their cattle yeah yeah I would never
[40:14] disbel listen there's been a lot of
[40:16] people that were in brother benham's
[40:17] meetings and saw the Supernatural and
[40:19] disbelieved there are those who grew up
[40:21] in this message and grew up in the
[40:22] Tabernacle and knew the stories
[40:24] firsthand and talked to the people had
[40:26] witnessed it and know that it's nothing
[40:27] but the truth and they disbelieve yeah
[40:30] seeing more miracles won't make you a
[40:32] Believer having the C Gene of God inside
[40:34] is what makes you a Believer the gift of
[40:37] God Amen by grace are we saved through
[40:39] faith and not none of ourselves it is
[40:41] the gift of God the ability to believe
[40:43] the word of God comes as a gift from God
[40:46] Amen because it's part of God and God
[40:48] will believe his own word that's right
[40:50] but we can wish for miracles all day
[40:52] long and push for miracles all day long
[40:54] and miracles will not make more
[40:55] Believers amen
[40:57] that's
[40:59] right
[41:01] amen it it will not create more
[41:04] Believers it never
[41:06] has it will attract attention of the
[41:09] True
[41:11] Believers it'll get them to come but
[41:14] remember they're not hooked by the bait
[41:17] on the hook they're hooked by the hook
[41:19] under the bait
[41:21] amen and that hook is the word of God
[41:24] Amen the truth of God the revelation of
[41:28] God Amen let's go to Luke
[41:48] 16 Luke
[41:51] 16 verse 27 this is The Story of Lazarus
[41:55] and the rich man Lazarus goes to at the
[41:58] death Lazarus goes to Abraham's bosom
[41:59] and the rich man amen goes into hell and
[42:03] he and he's imploring Abraham and now we
[42:05] go to verse uh chapter 16: 27 then he
[42:09] said I pray thee therefore father that
[42:12] thou wouldest send him to my father's
[42:14] house who does he want to send to his
[42:15] father's he want to send Lazarus the
[42:17] beggar that begged at his footsteps that
[42:18] he's at his doorstep that he stepped
[42:20] over who's now in the bosom of Abraham
[42:22] and he find himself in hell and now he's
[42:25] asking Father Abraham please send him
[42:28] back to my father's
[42:29] house for I have five Brethren that he
[42:33] may testify unto them lest they also
[42:35] come into this place of Torment Abraham
[42:38] saith unto him they have Moses and the
[42:40] prophets let them hear
[42:42] them and he said nay Father Abraham but
[42:46] if one went unto them from the dead they
[42:48] will repent and he said unto them if
[42:51] they hear not Moses and the prophets
[42:53] neither will they be persuaded the one
[42:55] rose from the dead
[42:59] right because Miracles don't make
[43:02] Believers
[43:04] right
[43:06] amen John chapter
[43:12] 5 Miracles are a Vindication and an
[43:15] Evidence of the work of
[43:23] God John chapter 5
[43:30] in John chapter 5 I want to start at
[43:32] verse
[43:35] 45 sayso not think that I will accuse
[43:37] you to the father there is one that
[43:39] accuses you even Moses in whom you trust
[43:43] for he for had ye believed Moses you
[43:45] would have believed me for he wrote of
[43:48] me well that's a statement because they
[43:51] were all claiming they believed
[43:53] Moses and the reality is they believed
[43:56] Moses
[43:57] was a prophet of God they believe Moses
[44:01] was the vessel that God used to bring
[44:02] the Exodus out of Egypt they believe
[44:04] that they believe Moses wrote the
[44:06] pentiuk they believe Moses got the law
[44:08] they believe Moses had the the the the
[44:10] Ten Commandments on the two tables of
[44:11] stone they believe Moses got the vision
[44:13] for the Tabernacle they believed all of
[44:16] that but they did not believe Moses's
[44:18] words yeah amen that's what he said for
[44:22] had you believed Moses you would have
[44:25] believed me for he wrote a to me but if
[44:28] you believe not his writings how shall
[44:30] you believe my
[44:32] words Jesus is saying well I don't
[44:35] expect you to believe me you can't
[44:36] believe me you don't even believe what
[44:38] Moses said yeah because Moses wrote of
[44:40] me and you won't believe what Moses was
[44:42] saying y that's the same thing that
[44:44] happened in The Exodus they believed
[44:46] Moses but they didn't believe moses'
[44:48] words yeah they didn't believe that what
[44:50] he said they didn't believe the message
[44:52] that he had brought from God but they
[44:53] believed Moses they could see him they
[44:55] could see him hold up the rod they could
[44:57] see him throw it down and become certain
[44:58] they could take it back up they knew he
[45:00] was a mighty prophet of God they knew
[45:01] that that God was using him they
[45:03] believed in Moses but they did not
[45:05] believe Moses's
[45:07] message my oh my and here he is
[45:11] Generations later Here Comes Jesus
[45:12] Christ which is the Fulfillment of what
[45:14] Moses had said and Moses wrote of him
[45:16] and he's standing here the word made
[45:17] flesh and he's saying how are you going
[45:20] to believe me if you won't believe Moses
[45:21] because Moses wrote of me if you won't
[45:23] believe his writings why will you
[45:24] believe my words
[45:27] it shows where true faith is Friends
[45:29] true faith is in the present day word of
[45:31] the Lord amen that's where true faith
[45:34] lies is those who can believe the
[45:37] present tense word of the
[45:41] Lord and the message as I was with Moses
[45:44] brother banham is telling the story of
[45:47] how in the cabin that day he got his
[45:49] commission from the angel of the Lord
[45:52] and he says but he told me that he would
[45:54] give me when I told him that the people
[45:56] would not believe
[45:58] me how would a king or Monarch an
[46:00] educated person he had been told you're
[46:02] going to go take a gift of healing to
[46:04] the peoples of the world and you're
[46:05] going to pray for Great Men and monarchs
[46:07] and kings and and and leaders and and
[46:09] you're going to travel all over and
[46:11] brother man saying but no one's going to
[46:12] believe
[46:14] me how would a king or a monarch or an
[46:16] educated person most of them that looks
[46:18] to the wisdom of the world and the
[46:20] talents of that type listen to a man
[46:21] that that that talked like me they would
[46:24] not do that and so I said they won't
[46:26] believe me
[46:27] he said as as the prophet Moses was
[46:29] given two signs to vindicate his being
[46:31] sin of God so will you be given now that
[46:35] was something not in the educational
[46:37] realm but out in the Supernatural realm
[46:39] see and said the first thing you'll know
[46:42] to diseases by taking people by the hand
[46:45] and then it'll come to pass that you'll
[46:46] know the very secrets of their hearts
[46:48] and the things that's happened in their
[46:49] life and be able to tell them from the
[46:51] beginning to the end and said they'll
[46:53] believe
[46:55] this is that right yes that's right so
[46:59] as Moses was given sign two signs he was
[47:01] given two signs he was given the sign in
[47:03] the hand and he was given the sign of
[47:06] discernment and the angel of the Lord
[47:08] said they'll believe this and that's the
[47:11] truth they believe the sign in the hand
[47:14] and they believe the discernment yeah
[47:16] right but many of them didn't believe
[47:17] the messag
[47:19] amen and what was the point of the sign
[47:22] of the hand and what was the point of
[47:24] the sign of discernment to vindicate the
[47:27] messenger to vindicate that God sent him
[47:31] so people would listen to him so that
[47:32] they would get the word of the Lord and
[47:34] they could believe the word that comes
[47:36] out of his mouth so the signs were given
[47:38] to him to vindicate that he was sin of
[47:43] God praise God so the Vindication is
[47:47] important but what's more important is
[47:49] the
[47:53] message
[47:55] amen let's go to John chapter
[48:09] 12 John 12 verse
[48:15] 44 John
[48:19] 12:44 Jesus cried and said he that
[48:21] believeth on me believeth not on me but
[48:23] on him that sent me and he that seeth me
[48:26] seeth him that sent me I am come a light
[48:29] un the world that whosoever believeth on
[48:31] me should not abide in darkness and if
[48:33] any man hear my words and believe not I
[48:35] judge him not for I come not to judge
[48:37] the world but to save the world he that
[48:39] rejecteth me and receiveth not my words
[48:41] hath one that judgeth him the word that
[48:44] I have spoken the same shall judge him
[48:47] in the last day for I have not spoken of
[48:49] myself but the Father which sent me ha
[48:51] given me Commandment that I should say
[48:53] and what I should speak and now I know
[48:56] that this command and his life
[48:57] Everlasting whatsoever I speak therefore
[49:00] even as the father said unto me so I
[49:03] speak so even Jesus is saying amen I've
[49:06] done signs I've done wonders I've done
[49:08] Miracles but you're going to be judged
[49:11] by the words that I speak yeah because
[49:14] the word that I speak is not mine but
[49:17] it's the father's who gave me to speak I
[49:18] only speak what he gave me to speak so
[49:20] Jesus was sent with a messag amen and
[49:24] they were judged on whether or not they
[49:25] believed his message yeah multitudes
[49:28] believed his healing campaigns
[49:30] multitudes Hey listen thousands of
[49:32] people believe that he broke bread and
[49:34] fish yeah because they ate it right they
[49:38] ate the bread they ate the fish that was
[49:40] multiplied over little fishes and a few
[49:43] little loaves a handful amen and a small
[49:45] basket and it it fed multitudes of 5,000
[49:48] men Bes besides women and children and
[49:50] they actually ate it and swallowed it
[49:52] they knew he had the power to break
[49:54] bread and multiply they knew he was a
[49:56] man sent from God that's that's what
[49:58] Nicodemus said we know that thou are a
[50:00] man sent from God for no man can do
[50:02] these Miracles lest he be sent of
[50:05] God they believed he had power they
[50:08] believed he was a great prophet they
[50:09] believed but they didn't believe his
[50:11] words and they were judged not whether
[50:13] they believed the Miracles or not they
[50:14] judged whether they believed his word or
[50:18] not why because it was the father's
[50:22] word amen in the message what hearest
[50:26] thou
[50:27] brother benam
[50:30] says he says what hearest thou what can
[50:34] you hear and what have you heard through
[50:36] the years we've had Miracles we've had
[50:39] things that God has had men to wait he's
[50:41] performed Miracles he's never it never
[50:44] changed the country sin is on the
[50:46] Rampage worse than it ever was it moved
[50:48] right into the locks of the church and
[50:50] has tore it up what did our miracles do
[50:53] what did our healing campaigns I believe
[50:55] in Divine Healing sure but but you can't
[50:57] major on a minor Divine Healing is a
[50:58] minor you could never major on those
[51:00] things the church ought to be to
[51:03] maturity and we've had rushing winds and
[51:05] we've had all kinds of Sensations
[51:07] where's the church at where are we at
[51:09] today still more denominations growing
[51:11] every day and colonizing and everything
[51:13] and still the same men what we need is
[51:16] to wait till we hear the voice of God as
[51:20] individuals guess this he's typing it
[51:22] with Elijah in the cave and and Elijah
[51:24] is running away from his commission
[51:26] running scared he's back in the cave
[51:28] amen hiding out and God comes to him and
[51:30] and he speaks to him and and Elijah has
[51:32] excuses we know but then you know then
[51:34] there's a a great fire then a great wind
[51:36] and a great earthquake and God wasn't in
[51:39] any of it but then there was a still
[51:40] small voice and the still Small Voice
[51:42] had a
[51:43] message for Elijah and that message for
[51:47] Elijah through the still Small Voice
[51:49] it's what caused him amen the the fire
[51:51] didn't move him the earthquake didn't
[51:53] move him amen the wind didn't move him
[51:55] but the still soul Small Voice got him
[51:57] to come out of the back of the cave and
[51:59] how did he come out he came out in
[52:00] humility with his face wrapped in his
[52:02] mantle
[52:04] yeah cuz God was dealing with
[52:07] Elijah and that still Small Voice called
[52:10] him out and gave him his commission and
[52:13] his position and the work that he had to
[52:17] do
[52:19] Amen brother B says he's he's talking
[52:22] he's talking to a a World Church system
[52:25] he's talking in campaign aigns amen
[52:27] where there's been a Pentecostal Revival
[52:29] or restoration of the gifts from isusa
[52:31] Street on then there's been healing
[52:32] campaigns that broke out in the late 40s
[52:34] and tent revivals and meetings that
[52:36] swept uh uh after World War II and swept
[52:39] for a decade amen and he went through
[52:41] all of that and he says what have we got
[52:43] are the churches any better have the men
[52:45] changed what what have we
[52:48] got he says what we need is to wait till
[52:51] we hear the voice of God as an
[52:55] individual every man and woman in this
[52:58] convention no matter of Jim Jones and
[53:00] the rest of them that's that's that's
[53:02] with you if they don't do it you do it
[53:05] anyhow you pull yourself back in a cave
[53:07] and wait there until God speaks to you
[53:10] don't you move he will do
[53:13] it see to me this is this is
[53:17] amazing there was let's just go back to
[53:21] the Exodus Journey signs wonders
[53:24] Miracles powerful manifestations
[53:28] yeah and all of them heard what Moses
[53:32] said but only two of them receive the
[53:38] message because receiving the message is
[53:40] not hearing it with these
[53:43] ears receiving the message is receiving
[53:45] it with a receiving Crystal on the
[53:47] inside that knows that that's nothing
[53:49] but the truth and how did they know it
[53:51] was nothing but the truth cuz they were
[53:52] willing to do the word yeah they were
[53:55] willing to live the word word they were
[53:56] willing to manifest the word how were
[53:58] they live willing to do the word they
[54:00] were willing to go fight Giants and
[54:03] climb walls on walled cities because
[54:05] they believe the message yeah how did
[54:07] they believe it listen everybody heard
[54:10] the voice of Moses declaring what God's
[54:13] message was but two received the message
[54:16] they got the voice of God individually
[54:20] yeah Amen to them they knew they could
[54:23] do it they knew they could take it they
[54:25] knew the Pro was to them so much so that
[54:28] Caleb after 40 years he was 40 years old
[54:31] when he went to spy out the land 40
[54:33] years old when he stealed them 40 years
[54:35] old when he said we can do it God said
[54:37] we can do it and then he had to wait
[54:39] another 40 years till all the
[54:40] unbelievers who died because of the sin
[54:42] of unbelief we're separated from the
[54:44] camp then he comes to Moses and now he's
[54:47] 80 years old he said 40 years and he was
[54:49] he was over 80 40 plus years he said I'm
[54:52] waited I'm just as strong
[54:54] today yeah to go out and to come in he
[54:58] says give me my Mountain amen what he
[55:01] what's he saying I heard God speak to me
[55:04] that promise was to me it wasn't a
[55:07] general message to everybody out there
[55:09] he heard a whisper in his heart that
[55:11] that land was his land that promise was
[55:14] his promise and he was and God says I've
[55:18] come he said it through Moses's voice
[55:20] but he Vindicated Moses as the voice
[55:23] right Moses had the vindication that
[55:26] he'd been on the backs side of the
[55:27] desert he met God was commissioned by
[55:29] God to bring a message and he came out
[55:31] and showed the signs that God wanted him
[55:32] to show to vindicate that he was the
[55:34] mouthpiece of God so it wasn't Moses's
[55:36] message it was God's messag amen amen
[55:39] and God's message found its
[55:42] home and two
[55:46] people everybody else heard what Moses
[55:48] said that
[55:50] day but there was
[55:53] two that received the message
[55:56] amen and here Caleb is after a 40-year
[56:00] delay
[56:03] yeah and he still knows what he heard
[56:06] while he was in Egypt is still the truth
[56:10] yeah right because What mo what here's
[56:14] what Caleb heard or here's what he
[56:16] didn't
[56:17] hear I'm taking a group of people over
[56:21] to the promised land and I'm taking a
[56:22] group of people and I'm giving them the
[56:24] promised land yeah right

[56:28] what Caleb heard is I'm calling you out
[56:31] of Egypt and I'm taking you to the
[56:33] promise of your fathers and I'm giving
[56:34] that land to you
[56:38] yeah amen that's what the crystal of
[56:41] predestinated seed picks up not the
[56:43] general message the individual message
[56:46] to you it's you I've promised this to
[56:49] you Caleb couldn't die amen he had
[56:52] already received the message it was to

[56:56] going to bring you out with a mighty
[56:58] hand I'm going to give you to take you
[57:00] to the promise that I promised to your
[57:01] fathers and I'm going to give you this
[57:05] land listen that's how we've got to hear
[57:07] this message friends amen we've got to
[57:10] hear it it's got to speak to the crystal
[57:12] the seed Amen to the real us down on the
[57:15] inside and it doesn't matter how long we
[57:17] wait or what we see or how many
[57:19] Compadres die in the wilderness it does
[57:21] not matter because I heard the message
[57:23] to me it was to me
[57:28] amen there's been all kinds of revivals
[57:31] and all kinds of meetings and all kinds
[57:33] of camps and all kinds of doctrin and
[57:35] they sweep through and everybody gets
[57:37] excited then it dies off and then
[57:39] another one sweeps and it dies off and
[57:41] great ministry and what it doesn't
[57:43] matter how long that goes on I heard
[57:45] something to me that this message is to
[57:48] me the body Chang is for me the calling
[57:50] out of Leo deia was for me the stepping
[57:53] through an open door and taking another
[57:55] position with my Lord that was for
[57:59] me doesn't
[58:01] matter doesn't
[58:05] matter amen and all the sweeping
[58:08] revivals and all the big moves and all
[58:10] the great camps and all the big
[58:13] doctrines what's It
[58:17] produced God already Vindicated the
[58:20] mouthpiece was the prophet of
[58:23] God and that mouthpiece of God come to
[58:26] bring God's
[58:28] message and God's message came to
[58:31] connect with
[58:36] individuals the the first pull the
[58:40] second
[58:41] pull what was
[58:43] it brother man begins to to to talk
[58:47] about he goes back to the vision of the
[58:50] three pools when he's
[58:52] fishing and it begins the whole vision
[58:55] and the whole purpose of the Vision was
[58:56] to catch the rainbow trout out in the
[58:58] deep
[58:59] water the Covenant fish Rainbow's a sign
[59:01] of the Covenant there's Covenant fish
[59:03] there's big rainbow trout laying out
[59:05] there he said in the deep
[59:06] water so I just thought to myself I
[59:09] think I can catch
[59:10] them of course he can catch him he was
[59:12] ordained to catch
[59:14] him and the first pole in the vision was
[59:17] a pool with a lure amen that was the
[59:20] sign in the hand brother bam relates it
[59:21] all to us it was a sign in the hand and
[59:23] what was it to do it was to attract
[59:25] attention he trying to get those
[59:27] Covenant fish to come to the
[59:31] word so he throws out there the sign in
[59:34] the
[59:36] hand and it attracts he said a bunch of
[59:38] little fish gather around well when
[59:39] those little fish gather around that
[59:41] gets attention to the big fish they rise
[59:42] off the bottom they start watching and
[59:43] seeing what's going
[59:44] on then the second pool amen was
[59:47] supposed to what it was supposed to do
[59:49] is scatter all the little fish and cause
[59:52] the big fish to come closer and the
[59:53] third pool was supposed to catch them
[59:56] but in brother R's second pull the
[59:58] discernment he pulled too hard and when
[1:00:00] he pulled too hard he caught one little
[1:00:02] old bitty fish he said it looked like
[1:00:04] skin Over The
[1:00:05] Lure he said that was the same kind of
[1:00:08] fish these other brothers was cing along
[1:00:09] the bank well all the brothers along the
[1:00:11] bank were other
[1:00:14] ministers so what was the first and
[1:00:17] second pool it was an
[1:00:21] attraction and a lot more got attracted
[1:00:24] than just the rainbow trout yeah it
[1:00:27] attracted other species of fish it
[1:00:29] attracted the little fish like the other
[1:00:31] it attracted all kinds of fish because
[1:00:34] that was the purpose to attract the
[1:00:37] fish but the third pull was when he set
[1:00:40] the
[1:00:43] hook and at the third pool the rainbow
[1:00:46] trout were hooked they were never going
[1:00:47] to get
[1:00:48] away they were going to make it all the
[1:00:51] way in Shore because they were hooked on
[1:00:53] the third pool and brother B said the
[1:00:55] third pool was the opening of the
[1:00:58] word brother M go now he he makes some
[1:01:01] comments let me see if I can jump to
[1:01:04] another page
[1:01:06] Lord and see a few things he
[1:01:11] made brother bam said in anointed ones
[1:01:14] in the end times he says not when he
[1:01:15] starts on but when he begins to declare
[1:01:17] his
[1:01:18] message the first pull healing second
[1:01:21] pull prophesying third pull the opening
[1:01:22] of the word the Mysteries revealed no
[1:01:25] more no more there is any more higher
[1:01:27] order to reveal the word than prophets
[1:01:29] but the only way the prophet can be
[1:01:31] Vindicated is by the word and remember
[1:01:33] the third pull was the opening of them
[1:01:34] Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth
[1:01:36] that's been sealed in the word do you
[1:01:38] see it that's the million-dollar
[1:01:41] question
[1:01:42] yeah do you see it but I like when he
[1:01:45] says not when he begins but when he
[1:01:48] begins to declare his message so there
[1:01:50] was a time that he began to declare his
[1:01:54] message he he says in works as Faith
[1:01:59] expressed he says Revelation 10 said
[1:02:01] that in the hour of the seventh Angel's
[1:02:03] message when he begins to sound forth
[1:02:05] his message not in a healing service but
[1:02:08] the message that follows the healing
[1:02:11] service so we begin to realize and he
[1:02:14] says that in more than one place but
[1:02:16] we'll just leave it at that what brother
[1:02:18] B is telling us is there was an
[1:02:20] attraction but that attraction was
[1:02:22] attracting all kinds of fish and that
[1:02:24] can represent the church at Large
[1:02:26] attracting everybody that's in the pond
[1:02:27] you know y but but the third pool the
[1:02:31] one that was supposed to catch the big
[1:02:33] trout in the deep water the Covenant
[1:02:35] fish that third pool that was supposed
[1:02:37] to catch them was the opening of the
[1:02:40] word amen and the opening of the word
[1:02:44] was not a healing campaign a sign or a
[1:02:46] Wonder or or water from a rock like
[1:02:49] anything that's visible or tangible but
[1:02:51] the third pool came in a way that
[1:02:53] brother bham said I feel checked not to
[1:02:55] say any more I'm told I'm not to explain
[1:02:57] this one you explain the first one you
[1:02:58] explain the second one but you won't
[1:03:00] explain the third one when it starts
[1:03:01] it'll be a total
[1:03:03] secret amen so what's supposed to catch
[1:03:06] the rainbow trout it's going to be the
[1:03:09] message that comes after the healing
[1:03:11] campaigns not the healing campaigns
[1:03:13] that's the attraction to attract all the
[1:03:15] fish but what's supposed to catch those
[1:03:17] predestinated what was it amen that
[1:03:20] caught what was it that caught Caleb and
[1:03:22] and and and and Joshua amen I'm of
[1:03:25] course they were excited about the
[1:03:27] Miracles of course they were excited
[1:03:28] about the destruction of Egypt I I bet
[1:03:30] they were as excited as everybody else
[1:03:32] was excited amen when they walk through
[1:03:34] the Red
[1:03:35] Sea I don't know about you but I would
[1:03:37] be
[1:03:39] thrilled to have an experience like that
[1:03:42] yeah thrilled I bet they were as excited
[1:03:45] as everybody else was excited they were
[1:03:47] thrilled amen when they saw water come
[1:03:49] from the rock they were thrilled with
[1:03:50] the man every morning they probably
[1:03:51] talked like everybody else talked can
[1:03:53] you believe what just happened can you
[1:03:55] believe what we just saw I mean I this
[1:03:57] is absolutely amazing I've never heard
[1:03:58] of anything like this in the history of
[1:04:00] the
[1:04:01] world
[1:04:03] Amen everybody was
[1:04:06] attracted but there was something else
[1:04:09] that was deeper in those
[1:04:13] two they believed everything else
[1:04:15] everybody believed but they believed
[1:04:17] more because they believ the
[1:04:20] message and when it come to KES
[1:04:24] barnea and they moved through into cage
[1:04:27] Baria and they saw the physical
[1:04:31] hindrances to the word when they saw the
[1:04:35] cities and the Giants and this and that
[1:04:36] and the
[1:04:37] other 10 of them's heart failed for
[1:04:41] fear two of them said did you see the
[1:04:44] size of Those Grapes yeah
[1:04:47] right oh yeah 10 said did you see the
[1:04:50] size of those Gates the other said yeah
[1:04:53] those are the biggest cluster of grapes
[1:04:54] I didn't say grapes I said Gates he go I
[1:04:56] didn't notice the gates I was looking at
[1:04:57] the
[1:05:00] grapes because two believe the message
[1:05:03] 10 didn't believe the message they
[1:05:06] believe the messenger they believe the
[1:05:08] power of God they believe the signs and
[1:05:10] wonders at the end of it all they didn't
[1:05:12] believe the
[1:05:15] message cuz when it came time to take
[1:05:17] the land he said you take
[1:05:20] it you'll fight you'll fight for every
[1:05:23] in you fight you take I'll be with you
[1:05:25] I'll D but you fight
[1:05:28] amen amen and they just couldn't see
[1:05:32] how what we need we've had rushing winds
[1:05:36] we've had all kinds of sensation and
[1:05:38] where's the church at I'm going back to
[1:05:39] this quote from 59 what here's the
[1:05:42] Elijah what we need is to wait till we
[1:05:44] hear the voice of God as
[1:05:48] individuals every man woman in this
[1:05:50] convention no matter Jim Jones the rest
[1:05:52] of them that's that's with you if they
[1:05:55] don't do it you do it
[1:05:58] anyhow pull yourself back in a little
[1:06:00] cave and wait there till God speaks to
[1:06:03] you don't you move he'll do
[1:06:06] it the problem with the faith that the
[1:06:10] Israelites
[1:06:12] had as long as they had water and they
[1:06:14] had food and they had security and they
[1:06:16] had safety and they had a constant
[1:06:17] stream of Supernatural things happening
[1:06:19] they they had no problem
[1:06:21] believing it's when those things stopped
[1:06:23] that they always had a problem believing
[1:06:29] in the Third Exodus brother B says the
[1:06:30] first Exodus what did he do he brought
[1:06:32] them out of a natural land to a natural
[1:06:34] land the second Exodus he brought them
[1:06:36] out from a spiritual condition into a
[1:06:38] spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost now
[1:06:40] he's bringing them from the spiritual
[1:06:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost right back
[1:06:44] into the Eternal land of the Millennium
[1:06:47] and the great Hereafter same Pillar of
[1:06:49] Fire by the same anointed system the
[1:06:51] same God doing the same things and the
[1:06:54] same word declared the first one
[1:06:57] declared the second one the same word
[1:06:58] declared the second one is declared the
[1:07:00] third one and here we see it Among Us
[1:07:02] come out oh come out of this chaos come
[1:07:05] to the Living God so what's what's he
[1:07:08] coming he says come out but come what
[1:07:11] are we coming out of what was the Third
[1:07:12] Exodus to come out of man's ideas come
[1:07:14] out of denominationalism come out of
[1:07:16] traditional understanding but there's a
[1:07:18] Going In Too part of The Exodus is not
[1:07:20] just come out but now he says come to
[1:07:22] the Living God come to the word and the
[1:07:25] word word was made flesh and dwell Among
[1:07:27] Us and now he's in our flesh dwelling
[1:07:30] Among Us what are we coming out to what
[1:07:33] we're coming out of denominationalism

[1:07:37] understanding of the scriptures and of
[1:07:39] the Gospel what are we coming to we're
[1:07:40] coming to the realization of where God

[1:07:53] God and Christ is the mystery of God

[1:07:59] the
[1:08:00] Revelation Christ's life in you makes
[1:08:03] him the center of the Revelation Christ
[1:08:05] in the Bible makes the Bible the
[1:08:06] complete revelation of Christ Christ in

[1:08:24] Bride form

[1:08:30] back to the church in the fullness of
[1:08:32] his
[1:08:33] glory that's this great Exodus Journey
[1:08:35] coming out but coming into what coming
[1:08:38] into being the Tabernacle that God
[1:08:40] dwells in the dwelling place we look at
[1:08:44] we look at the Giants in our land and
[1:08:47] when you look in the mirror you'll see
[1:08:48] the worst
[1:08:52] one so you can't do it I can't live this
[1:08:55] I can't be that I can't
[1:08:57] be listen we're more than able friends
[1:09:00] why are we more than able because God
[1:09:02] promised it for this hour this is the
[1:09:05] word he wants to accomplish this is the
[1:09:06] message but this isn't the message to a
[1:09:08] group of people this isn't the message
[1:09:10] that this is the message to individuals
[1:09:14] amen Christ in you makes you the
[1:09:17] complete revelation of the whole thing
[1:09:19] see what God is trying to do Christ in
[1:09:22] who the bride Christ in the true church
[1:09:25] yeah Christ no he said Christ in
[1:09:28] you Christ in
[1:09:31] you I'm going to read it again I want to
[1:09:35] read it again is that okay
[1:09:38] amen Christ in you makes you the
[1:09:42] complete revelation of the whole thing
[1:09:48] amen
[1:09:49] amen see what God is trying to do what
[1:09:53] is the new birth then you said well
[1:09:55] brother Brandon what is the new birth it
[1:09:56] is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:09:58] personally to you amen see not you
[1:10:01] joined a church you shook hands you've
[1:10:02] done something different you set a Creed
[1:10:04] you promised to live by a code of rules
[1:10:05] but Christ the Bible he is the word that
[1:10:08] was revealed to you and no matter what
[1:10:10] anybody says what takes place it's
[1:10:12] Christ Pastor priest whatever it might
[1:10:14] be it's Christ in you that is the
[1:10:17] Revelation that the church was built
[1:10:18] upon what is brother B saying what is
[1:10:20] the New Birth the new birth is the
[1:10:22] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:10:25] you do we say all right I believe I got
[1:10:28] a personal revelation that Jesus Christ
[1:10:30] died on Calvary for me that is part of
[1:10:32] the Revelation but that's not what
[1:10:33] brother Brenham ends with he says it's
[1:10:35] Christ in you that is the Revelation
[1:10:38] that the church was built upon amen what
[1:10:41] is the Revelation that we need to climb
[1:10:43] back into a cave and stay there until
[1:10:45] God calls us out it's the Revelation
[1:10:48] that the message is all about you amen
[1:10:53] amen it's about Christ getting Dominion
[1:10:57] in your life Christ Living his life
[1:11:00] through you Christ manifesting himself
[1:11:03] through
[1:11:04] you me
[1:11:06] too but when he says you I say me and
[1:11:10] when he says you I hope you say
[1:11:12] me
[1:11:14] amen so when brother B preaches Christ
[1:11:17] as the mystery of God revealed he opens
[1:11:18] with Colossians 1 and he reads all the
[1:11:21] way till he reads to the part where it
[1:11:23] says which is Christ in you the hope of
[1:11:27] glory what was this great message that
[1:11:30] brother renham came to what was the
[1:11:31] great message that he come to bring what
[1:11:33] was the attraction what was the signs
[1:11:35] and wonders the signs and wonders
[1:11:36] Vindicated he was the voice of God for
[1:11:38] this age and they drew the
[1:11:40] attention of the fish but what was it
[1:11:44] that caught the fish it was the opening
[1:11:46] of the word it was the mystery of God
[1:11:48] being revealed and under that mystery of
[1:11:51] God was a message to the individual
[1:11:56] you're part of
[1:11:57] this it has to do with
[1:12:00] you it's something to do with Christ and
[1:12:04] you it has something to do with an
[1:12:06] invisible Union it has something to do
[1:12:08] with the dwelling place of God it has
[1:12:09] something to do with God restoring back
[1:12:12] what was lost to the church ages and has
[1:12:15] something to do with
[1:12:17] you see that's what Caleb got in the
[1:12:20] message so many people they got they
[1:12:23] played Moses's tapes and they heard what
[1:12:25] Moses said about great this and that and
[1:12:27] the other and and but when it came down
[1:12:29] to the a difficult trial when it came
[1:12:32] down to an impossibility amen they they
[1:12:34] they walked
[1:12:35] away they
[1:12:38] disbelieved what did they
[1:12:40] disbelieve they disbelieved what Caleb
[1:12:42] and Joshua were able to believe yeah and
[1:12:46] what were they able to believe they are
[1:12:48] able to believe that they were part of
[1:12:50] the promise yeah that the promise was to
[1:12:53] them and for them and they were part of
[1:12:55] it
[1:13:02] amen I read this same quote I've read
[1:13:05] this quote twice now I think I think if
[1:13:07] I remember right in the last two
[1:13:09] Services I preached but I'm going to
[1:13:11] read it again it's out of the rising of
[1:13:13] the
[1:13:14] sun says you believe that we shall rise
[1:13:18] in him we are part of him the Easter the
[1:13:21] revealed Secret Of God like it was then
[1:13:23] of life after death we are now alive who
[1:13:26] were once dead in sin and trespasses the
[1:13:29] true Easter seal has broken death from
[1:13:31] around me and I'm alive the Easter seal
[1:13:34] at the beginning broke the Seal of the
[1:13:35] Roman seal the Easter seal that he was
[1:13:37] sealed up and man when they died was
[1:13:39] gone but he broke the seal and revealed
[1:13:42] the secret and now God by his holy
[1:13:44] spirit has broke the seal from around
[1:13:46] our lives and Christ is revealed as he
[1:13:48] lives in us for now we are quickened
[1:13:52] with him I say God break the seal from
[1:13:54] arest around our lives you want to pray
[1:13:57] that today God break the seal from
[1:13:58] around my life let me side in that cave
[1:14:01] till I heal your still small voice
[1:14:03] calling me out to my position to my
[1:14:05] commission amen uh Elijah wasn't much
[1:14:09] different than you know other human
[1:14:11] beings he couldn't do it the task was
[1:14:14] too much he was left alone and they
[1:14:15] sought his life and he was all alone and
[1:14:17] he was looking at all the natural
[1:14:20] things and Elijah listen Elijah had just
[1:14:23] witnessed Supernatural
[1:14:26] is that right absolutely powerful
[1:14:29] manifestation of God coming down and a
[1:14:31] in a whirlwind of Fire and Fire falling
[1:14:34] upon his altar consuming the altar the
[1:14:36] water the stones and all of it and then
[1:14:38] a tremendous Victory and then in his own
[1:14:41] Humanity amen he falls back into fear at
[1:14:44] the threat of a woman runs amen out to
[1:14:46] the Wilderness wants to die he's no
[1:14:47] better than his fathers runs into a cave
[1:14:49] amen then God comes and deals with him
[1:14:51] and what is the message that God is
[1:14:53] giving to Elijah amen the messages
[1:14:55] Elijah Don't if I could
[1:14:58] paraphrase Jesus didn't say don't worry
[1:15:00] about all those he just ignored it all
[1:15:02] yeah I've left alone they seek my life
[1:15:05] I've done this and I've tried that and
[1:15:07] now I'm here in this cave because I'm
[1:15:09] all alone they seek my life and and
[1:15:10] God's like I'm not worried about that
[1:15:12] yeah don't you worry about that yeah but
[1:15:15] there's still something for you to do to
[1:15:17] finish the
[1:15:20] commission man I believe what we need is
[1:15:23] the same thing that Caleb got
[1:15:26] a revelation that when Moses Moses is
[1:15:30] standing there talking to 600,000 men
[1:15:32] plus women and
[1:15:34] children and it's 600,000 men plus women
[1:15:37] and children he says God come to give me
[1:15:39] a message that the time for deliverance
[1:15:41] has come he's going to give you the
[1:15:42] promise of your fathers what he promised
[1:15:44] to Abraham he's going to perform now
[1:15:46] he's taking you out of here and he's
[1:15:47] taking you to give you the land that he
[1:15:49] promised yeah and everybody cheered yay
[1:15:52] we're going we're going we're going
[1:15:57] but for everybody else it was
[1:15:59] we right but for Caleb it was me
[1:16:04] yeah so that even if we would fail me
[1:16:08] would still
[1:16:10] believe that's the Revelation that I
[1:16:12] want that's the Revelation I believe
[1:16:14] God's giving us if if we fail me
[1:16:17] believes because God told
[1:16:20] me when I hear the tapes and brother bam
[1:16:23] there there's two ways to listen to the
[1:16:24] tapes you can listen to the tape and say
[1:16:26] yeah God's calling out a bride well
[1:16:28] that's true yeah God's calling out a
[1:16:30] bride and the bride's going to do this
[1:16:32] and the bride's going to do that and the
[1:16:33] bride's going to be the Tabernacle of
[1:16:35] God and the bride and the bride and the
[1:16:36] bride and the bride you can listen to
[1:16:37] the tape that way or you can listen to
[1:16:39] the tape and say God's calling me and
[1:16:41] God wants to use me and God's going to
[1:16:42] fill me and God's going to manifest
[1:16:44] himself through me and God's going to
[1:16:46] use me to do everything that he did in
[1:16:48] his first
[1:16:51] coming that's the way I want to believe
[1:16:53] the message friends
[1:16:55] amen there's that's true faith in the
[1:16:59] word of God that's been given to
[1:17:02] us more miracles can't produce
[1:17:06] that because many times when the
[1:17:08] Miracles stop people wander
[1:17:11] away but when the revelation of the word
[1:17:14] comes and it strikes a predestinated
[1:17:17] seed they'll never walk away that's
[1:17:20] right amen they'll keep pressing on and
[1:17:22] pressing on and for 40 years what did
[1:17:25] Caleb do I don't know he could have done
[1:17:27] all kinds of stuff but I think for 40
[1:17:30] years he kept thinking I'm going to go
[1:17:32] back to that place that I saw yeah when
[1:17:34] I went over the mountain and I saw that
[1:17:36] thing and that place there I'm going
[1:17:37] back there yeah why cuz he believed
[1:17:41] it amen that's the way I want to listen
[1:17:44] to the messag
[1:17:46] amen let's go to John chapter 8 I'm
[1:17:48] going to finish with this verse
[1:17:50] musicians if you'll come brother John if
[1:17:52] you'll make your way up please John
[1:17:54] chapter
[1:18:04] 8 John chter
[1:18:09] 8:31 then
[1:18:11] Jesus uh then said Jesus to the Jews
[1:18:14] which believed on him if you continue in
[1:18:17] my word then you are my disciples indeed
[1:18:20] and you shall know the truth and the
[1:18:22] truth shall make you free amen I want to
[1:18:25] continue in his
[1:18:27] word amen more than anything I want to
[1:18:30] continue in his word no matter what
[1:18:32] happens around me no M matter what we
[1:18:34] see or don't see or feel or don't
[1:18:37] feel I want to continue in his
[1:18:40] word why because the Vindication came to
[1:18:44] prove that this was a mouthpiece of God
[1:18:47] so that I would get the word and that I
[1:18:49] would believe and follow the word amen
[1:18:53] say God help me to continue in the word
[1:18:56] am and be a disciple indeed you know
[1:18:59] many of the disciples that were with
[1:19:01] Jesus didn't continue in the word yeah
[1:19:04] many of them that saw all the works saw
[1:19:07] the raising of the Dead the opening the
[1:19:08] blind's eyes even those who performed
[1:19:11] the same kind of Miracles because Judas
[1:19:14] was sent out with a Healing Ministry
[1:19:17] Judas laid hands on the sick and that
[1:19:19] they were delivered demons were subject
[1:19:22] to him he cast out demons cuz he came
[1:19:24] back testif ifying like everybody else
[1:19:25] did that he did those works but he
[1:19:28] didn't continue in the
[1:19:29] word and what what was it all for so
[1:19:33] that we would get the word and what is
[1:19:36] it we need to do continue in the word
[1:19:40] and let's all Stand
[1:19:48] Together
