[0:00] Amen. But I've had I've heard people
[0:02] say, "Brother Brandon only said that one
[0:03] time and you don't find it in the New
[0:05] Testament."
[0:07] MY GOODNESS. BROTHER BRANDHAM ONLY SAID
[0:08] IT ONE TIME. You don't find in DO WE
[0:11] BELIEVE WE GOT A PROPHET OF GOD OR DO WE
[0:12] NOT HAVE A PROPHET OF GOD? AND IF YOU
[0:14] SAY WE HAVE A PROPHET OF GOD, DO YOU NOT
[0:15] KNOW WHAT A PROPHET OF GOD IS?
[0:18] &gt;&gt; Look through the LOOK THROUGH THE BIBLE
[0:19] AND FIND OUT WHAT A PROPHET IS. AMEN. A
[0:22] PROPHET IS NOT A SUPER EXTRA-GIFTED
[0:24] PREACHER. A PROPHET IS SOMETHING
[0:25] COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. HE BRINGS YOU THE
[0:27] WORD of God.
[0:29] HE HANDLES THE WORD OF GOD. HE IS THE
[0:31] MOUTHPIECE OF GOD. HE IS THE VOICE OF
[0:32] GOD ON EARTH. AND I DON'T CARE IF HE
[0:34] ONLY SAID IT ONE TIME. HE TOOK YOU RIGHT
[0:36] TO THE SCRIPTURES TO BACK UP WHAT HE
[0:38] SAID.
[0:39] &gt;&gt; AND TO REJECT THAT FOR WHATEVER
[0:41] REASONING you want to reject it to me is
[0:43] foolish.
[0:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[0:46] &gt;&gt; I DEALT WITH THIS OVERSEAS BEFORE. I
[0:48] WENT TO A PLACE OVERSEAS AND THEY WERE
[0:50] TELLING ME THIS WAS GOING ON IN THE
[0:51] CHURCH and the church was splitting.
[0:53] Amen. Because there was ministers
[0:54] sitting there who wanted to preach.
[0:58] But they WERE NOT MARRIED TO VIRGINS.
[0:59] AND THEY SAID, "WELL, IT HAPPENED BEFORE
[1:01] WE were converted." Brother Brandham
[1:03] DIDN'T SAY WHETHER BEFORE OR AFTER YOU
[1:05] WERE CONVERTED. BROTHER BRENHAM SAID,
[1:07] "IF GOD CALLS A MAN, HE CALLS HIS WIFE,
[1:09] TOO."
[1:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD WANTED YOU TO PREACH THIS
[1:12] MESSAGE, HE WOULD HAVE PRESERVED YOUR
[1:14] SPOUSE. GOD CAN WORK EVERYTHING OUT.
[1:16] DON'T YOU THINK GOD COULD HAVE WATCHED
[1:17] OVER YOU AND WATCHED OVER HER AND
[1:19] BROUGHT YOU TOGETHER TO PREACH THIS
[1:20] GOSPEL CLEAN AND PURE?
[1:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU UPHOLD SOMETHING YOU DENY?
[1:25] &gt;&gt; YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. That's right. Amen.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; And when I was dealing with this OVER
[1:29] THERE, AMEN. THE STATEMENT WAS, "BUT I
[1:32] have a gift and the people need it."
[1:36] &gt;&gt; BUT THE GIFTS AND CALLINGS OF GOD ARE
[1:38] WITHOUT REPENTANCE. I YOU SAY, "I HAVE A
[1:40] GIFT." I DON'T DOUBT THAT ONE BIT.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not going TO ARGUE WITH YOU. YOU
[1:45] HAVE A GIFT. YOU MAY BE GOOD. MY MY ONE
[1:47] TIME I HAD SOMEBODY IN MY FAMILY, they
[1:49] handed me a cassette TAPE OF A WOMAN
[1:51] PREACHER. SHE SAID, "PLEASE listen to
[1:52] this." This is when we first come to the
[1:54] message and they were trying to persuade
[1:55] me otherwise. I played it. This was
[1:58] after I started preaching. I'd just been
[1:59] called to preach. I was nervous behind
[2:01] the pullpit. I was insecure. I was, you
[2:04] know, all those things. [laughter]
[2:06] I listened to this woman preach and she
[2:08] was marvelous.
[2:10] And I got back to the family said, "What
[2:12] do you think?" I said, "She's good.
[2:14] She's far better than I am, but she's
[2:18] got no right behind the pull pit because
[2:19] the word of God SAYS
[2:21] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ABOUT ABILITY. IT'S NOT ABOUT
[2:23] EFFECT. YOU CAN'T SAY, "WELL, I'VE GOT A
[2:25] GIFT AND THEY NEED ME AND IT'S
[2:26] EFFECTIVE." WHAT DID GOD SAY?
[2:30] &gt;&gt; AS IF GOD CAN'T MAKE IT WITHOUT YOU AND
[2:32] WITHOUT YOUR GIFT AND GOD NEEDS YOU.
[2:34] LISTEN, GOD CAN RAISE UP STONES.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; He can raise UP CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM OUT
[2:40] OF STONES. DON'T YOU THINK THAT GOD
[2:42] NEEDS you
[2:44] &gt;&gt; because you're a good aator because you
[2:45] have a clear mind and you can put
[2:47] TOGETHER A THOUGHT. YOU MAY HAVE A GIFT,
[2:48] BUT THAT doesn't mean you're called to
[2:50] it.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, we have nobody ELSE TO
[2:54] DO IT." I'D RATHER GO WITH NOBODY ELSE
[2:56] THAN TO GO CONTRARY TO THE WORD OF GOD.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[3:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHY DO WE DO THIS? BECAUSE OF
[3:03] REASONINGS. WHAT WAS THE TEMPTATION? THE
[3:05] TEMPTATION WAS NOT TO BE EVIL. THE
[3:08] TEMPTATION, AMEN, WAS TO DO SOMETHING
[3:10] GOOD, BUT NOT ACCORDING TO THE WORD.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; AND I WANT TO PREACH THE MESSAGE. AMEN.
[3:15] AND I'VE GOT A GIFT AND THE PEOPLE NEED
[3:17] ME. THAT'S THE PRIDE OF LIFE, FRIENDS.
[3:23] &gt;&gt; I said, God, help us to stick with the
[3:25] word.
[3:27] &gt;&gt; I took two examples, BUT WE CAN APPLY
[3:29] THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE. The thing that
[3:31] brother Brandham taught us about, HE
[3:32] TAUGHT US ABOUT INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE. HE
[3:34] TAUGHT US ABOUT ELIGIBILITY to marriage.
[3:36] HE TAUGHT US ABOUT QUALIFICATIONS FOR
[3:38] MINISTRY. HE TALKED ABOUT ALL KINDS OF
[3:40] THINGS. AND THE QUESTION IS, IS HE A
[3:41] PROPHET OF GOD? DID HE BRING US BACK TO
[3:43] THIS WORD? IS IT THE WILL AND WORD OF
[3:45] GOD? ARE WE going to reason it away?
[3:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; Are we going to go down the line of
[3:50] every other denomination who takes a
[3:52] reason? ARE WE GOING TO STICK WITH THE
[3:54] WORD that's been restored to us?
[3:56] &gt;&gt; I say, God, let's stick with the word.
