========================================
that's all we want is for him to pull us in there amen no man can come unless the father draw and if you feel the father drawing what a blessed place you're in amen praise the lord it's so good to be with you this morning we appreciate you being here and the time for fellowship around the world has come and we look so forward to it amen it's like i almost cannot wait to come back and see what god's going to do again what he's going to say because his word means everything to us this is more than life when this natural life is going it's this word that's going to raise it up again amen it's this word that has prepared a place for me to go when i leave this body there's a home for me to go to amen and in this life i'm just reflecting that life and it's all based on the word amen it's not based on our thoughts it's not based on our experiences it's not based on how we feel about it it's based on the word and that's what we want praise the lord we want to just greet our visitors brother already god bless you and his wife priscilla and charissa god bless you all it's good to have you with us brother already is going to be ministering for us this afternoon so we're going to have a second service at four o'clock so we invite you all back for that we're going to go grab a bite to eat come right back and he's going to minister at 4. the fellowship hall's open if you've brought something you want to run and grab something quickly you can eat in there or go out and get a bite or go home and then come right back so that'll be a wonderful time this afternoon also you know there's so many exciting things happening it's just fun to it's fun to show up to church you know but today we've got a baptism brother ben wholesapple would like to be baptized after surface today so god bless you we'll be happy to do that at the end of the service so let's take our bibles and turn to the book of revelations we're going to continue on in the seals revelations chapter 6 praise the lord revelation chapter 6 and verse 1 and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder and one of the four beasts saying come and see and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see and there went on another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword just bow our heads dear heavenly father we ask that you would come and that you would just minister lord your word unto us god i pray lord as we just sacrifice ourselves right now and lay ourselves down on your altar we pray that you would come and take these vessels of kalelo and you would anoint us you would anoint these lips to speak and you anoint all of our ears to hear lord and we might receive what you have for us in this hour we love you lord and we ask that you would just give us of your spirit to receive your word in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated praise the lord we're going to continue on with the second seal and just see where we get i'm going to read a couple passages out of the seal book if you brought your seal book you can turn to that i'm going to be reading there's just a few things i think it's neat to read out of your own seal book so we'll open that up to the second seal and then in the in the book i have it's page 159 it's at the beginning of the second seal we're going to be in the third paragraph and i think i think actually i'm going to jump over i'm sorry to the third seal if you'll turn to the third seal with me i want to read something else first third seal in my book it is page 207. i'm sorry 206. paragraph 14. brother ben was talking about preaching this seal and he says on page 206 paragraph 14 sometimes when we just read and now be real careful and when you read get the tapes listen to them real close so brother branham's not wanting us to take a casual glance at these seals but he's telling us to read it and get the tape and read it real close why because there's so much more here than just the history of the church ages there's more happening in the seals than just an explanation of what's went wrong over seven church ages and how the antichrist moved he's telling us a whole lot more in these seals and he's constantly trying to get the people to see something else he's constantly saying if you read through your seals i hope you're catching it now i hope you're seeing this i'm just testing to see if you'll get it on your own now amen read your seal book and see brother branham's wanting the church to catch revelation amen so let's go back to the second seal page 159 paragraph 3 and we'll read this together it says it is now we pray father that you will come tonight and will break the second seal for us and as the poet has said he would like to look a past the curtain of time and that's our desire lord is just just to look a past and see what lays ahead so here brother branham's asking him to break the second seal in the second seal when he begins to explain it is all about the persecution of the early church and how they laid down their lives and how the red horse was rioting as the catholic church got power and they began to kill and martyr the saints and that's all past but here in his opening prayer he's saying lord open this second seal so we can see what lays ahead see why you have to read real because if you don't really read real careful you think that brother branham and breaking the second seal is explaining church history but he's not explaining church history he's showing church history so that we can see something that lays ahead hallelujah just look past and see what lays ahead and we pray that the lamb that had been slain will come among us now and break the seal and reveal it to us the things we have need to see now you realize why you have to read real careful because he's not telling us this breaking of the seal is not telling us the history the breaking of the seal will tell us to see what lays ahead hallelujah now let's go to paragraph 18. let's turn to my book page 161. paragraph 18 page 161 and now we're trusting now that the lord will bless us in our efforts tonight the first seal i certainly enjoyed that the first seal the blessing that went with it to me and now i don't want to keep you too long but you see i'll be going now just again in a few nights and after this is over and we have to just kind of suffer a little while that's the second seal we just kind of have to suffer a little while and we'll get into that more and you'll see but that is the second seal let's keep going and we'll see let's go through our powerpoint we'll back up just a little bit so we not we find out now that we're we're talking about this seals this this seven sealed book of redemption this entire bible that's been sealed up with seven seals and there's going to come a time in the transition of of of redemption when this book is not going to be sealed anymore this book is not going to be in the hand of the original uh the one who gave it the original owner anymore but now something has to transition it's got to move from one hand to the other it's got to move from the great eternal spirit god it's got to move to the man christ jesus amen the one who came as christ as god made himself a body and stepped into that and made his own blood and he shed that blood for the price of redemption and now he's come back to take redemption claims back to man and when he does he's going to open the book and show the mysteries of redemption what's been happening what's happening now and what's going to happen in the future and so so he has to open these seals because these seals have everything to do with redemption brother branham told us many times he says now several times in the seals he says now go look back at jeremiah go back and look at jeremiah now in jeremiah there was there was an open scroll and a sealed scroll and what jeremiah had done is he went and he redeemed a piece of land because they were going to go into babylonian captivity which is a type of the church going into the captivity of babylon which is the catholic system and before they go into babylon what he does is he buys a piece of land because you have to understand that the jews their inheritance was a physical piece of property land but for us our inheritance is the word and so he has to pay a redemption price amen for the inheritance pay a redemption price for the land and when he would pay that redemption price it was recorded that the price was paid and that now there's going to be those that come behind jeremiah and those that come behind him when they come out of babylonian captivity are going to have a right to what's been paid for but but they have to record it and they record it in an open document and they record it in a sealed document and then and they put it in an earthen vessel and they store it up so that when they come out of babylonian captivity when the captivity is ended and the restoration comes now those who have rights to that portion of the land those that have rights to the word they're going to come back and peel open the seal and read the document and compare the open with the clothes and they'll dovetail together and when they dovetail together then you know that it's time for the land to go back to the rightful air and when they open the seals and we've seen we've seen the symbol form of the seals in the open book and then we see the thunders that are the closed seals and at the sounding of the seven thunders when that's taken away there's a comparison made the bible dovetails together and we find out that we have the right of inheritance amen that we're going to the inheritance that the word belongs to us that we're part of the word we were always part of the word the word is for us the word belongs to us and will never be separated from the word because there's been a price that was paid now remember jeremiah paid the price long before they returned out of babylonian captivity jesus christ paid the price long before we returned out of babylonian captivity but we become out of babylonian captivity and now we're standing here the seals are open he's sitting on the throne he's holding the open book amen and he's come to tell us that we're the heirs joint heirs with christ these seals are exciting friends they're not in doubt anymore we're not in question who gets the inheritance who's the inheritance for is it for muslims is it for baptist is it for presbyterian no it's not for any of those it's for the children of god those that will wear no title amen those that will pin no badge on but those that will come right back to the original word those are the ones who are eligible for inheritance because they are the original word coming back to the original world signifying that they have the right of inheritance that's why the original word that's why the seals had been broke off the mysteries have to be revealed so that the original word can be laid out because only those who are part of the word can come to the word this is the test here's my word can you receive it and when you can receive it by faith it indicates that you are part of the word coming to the original word meaning you've come from the same source this word come from when you can believe every word that's written in this book it indicates that you came from the same place this book came from but when you reject what's written in this and you reject the prophet of the hour reject the message that he gave through vindication you have rejected it shows that you do not have rights to inheritance because the book of redemption when it peels open reveals all the mysteries of the bible and shows us this is the truth the seed of god says i believe that the non-seed said no that's not it then they don't have rights of inheritance why he came to show your name in the book how do you see your name he reveals the mystery that's what's calling your name what's he calling he's not calling chad and bob and larry and susie he's not calling that what's he calling he's calling for the original word he's calling for the word that's in you and the only thing that will call your name which is christ will be christ because the whole family in heaven and earth is named jesus christ christ is the mystery of god revealed amen it's christ being revealed the word being made manifest and when the word is unlocked it will only call the word that's why denominations will reject it that's why in this hour it's been so rejected it's not rejected by the word it's rejected by the false vine hallelujah so this these seals are everything to us it's showing us so much more than church history souls that are in prison now we've read this many times but we're going to keep laying it out so we see this the mystery was in the seven seals when these seven seals was opened that opened up the entire bible that means it cannot relate only to the new testament church these seals cannot only pertain to the new testament church to the seven church ages if it opened up the entire bible the seven seals it was sealed with seven mysteries and then these seven seals held the entire mystery of it and so now the veil has been taken away and now by the revealing of the word he's calling all he's calling his bride to come stand by his side the king theophany has come down the mighty angel has come down in the full revelation of his full word with full power to back it up and what's he doing by revealing the mysteries he's calling for his bride to come stand by his side and there's those that are saying that ain't nothing but the truth hallelujah now remember it's one of my favorite quotes now out of the church age books now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word now you can we we've mentioned this but i just want to lay this down so this doesn't leave us this is important to catch satan is not working in the bar room the house of prostitution the drug house he's not working there that's where people in a hybrid condition without the word of god go on their own right you move away from god it'll be amazing how fast your life will deteriorate you leave this word you leave this spiritual anointing that goes with the word then your life will spiral downhill you leave the message and you go out you're going to wind up with tattoos and shaved heads and piercings and marriage and divorce and adultery and everything else because you cannot sustain without the anointing that comes with the revealed word so so so devil's not he's not he's not out there in all of those things because his main work his works what he's doing has been has been unlocked or unveiled by the book of revelation and what is he trying to do he's trying to destroy god's people and discredit god's word that's the only thing he's doing he's not doing anything else that's his main objective so if he's trying to destroy god's people and discredit god's word where is he working in the bar room and the sports club and the where is he working he's trying to work in you and me he's trying to work right here right in our midst he's trying to come across and he's trying to bring deception and move us away but the book of revelation reveals his whole scheme reveals his whole plan amen so this this book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless see when he begins to work in and he begins to come in he always comes in as the white horse you'll remember and the white horse is innocent harmless looks good he has to mimic christ so it looks like it's okay amen and it's it's it's got really no authority over your life it doesn't have a crown amen he's got a bow but no arrow so he really can't hurt you so it looks harmless and when he comes in harmless his whole objective is to change horses he does not want to ride the white horse all of your life that's not what he came in for he didn't want to ride the white horse all the way through the last 2 000 years his objective has always been to get on the pale horse which is which is death which is spiritual death eternal separation from god that's his plan it always has been his plan but he doesn't show up with spiritual death he shows up with compromise he shows up with slight deviation from the original word he shows up with reasoning against the word of god and that's how he slips in and when he does he defiles the church and when he defiles the church he makes it formal lukewarm and powerless god hates a powerless church amen so what will what will give the church power obedience to the original word the life that comes with the word will give the church power the life the fire of god the holy ghost that comes with the revealed of the revealing of the word and the revealed word of the hour will keep you keep it from getting cold because you'll have the fire of god keep it from getting formal because you're not your own you're not in control god's he's running the ship he's behind the steering wheel keeps you from becoming formal and keeps you becoming powerless because you have the power of the word but it exposes satan this book of revelation revealing his works the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army so in order to be an invincible army you have to see the two spirits and that's what the book of revelation came to expose was the two spirits that's what the revelation of the seven seals does is exposes the two spirits and in order to be an invincible army you have to recognize the two spirits hallelujah this is going to get right down to home it's going to come right right down to sit in your seat with you that he fights that he can't stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and what she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her so if you haven't seen the antichrist spirit fully exposed how are you going to resist the antichrist spirit but the seals fully expose the antichrist spirit and then when when you see his deception and you don't fall for his deception and you find out how christ comes raising a standard against when the enemy comes in like a flood that god will raise a standard against it and you find that in the four living creatures now you find what the defense tactic is or how to combat that antichrist spirit and as soon as you go right to the scriptural way of doing this you have overcoming power he is now powerless over you when he is exposed he is powerless over you it's like somebody has a cunning scheme that's going through the neighborhood and a little kid is knocking on the door and he's a poor little ragged kid with a little jar and he says i'm trying to raise money for orphans i'm an orphan down here and i need some money would you give me some money oh my goodness what deception you're like oh cute little kid poor hungry thing and you're dropping coins in this thing but then your neighbor comes along and then he tells you hey is the kid coming to your door knocking your door asking for money don't give him any money his dad's one of the richest men in town and he sends his kids out collecting money now when you know the scheme he's powerless over you when he's been exposed it's simple it's so simple once he's been exposed he's like no i'm sorry i'm not going to do that well you reason the word no i'm sorry because that's how you always start will you compromise just a little bit no no no no because compromise leads to spiritual death eternal separation from god i'm not going to compromise the word i'm not going to deny the word i'm not going to deny what the prophet taught us why because i will not compromise on the word hallelujah satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ was stood as every effort to gain power over him in the desert how did christ withstand his every effort with it is written not not ideas not concepts not self-help amen not group therapy not support systems not any of those things it is written that's how he defeated the devil that's how we defeat the devil we don't need a buddy system to overcome the enemy we need the word of god hallelujah yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them so we see that there's two vines there's two vines and only two vines there's two spirits and only two spirits brother branham says in this message it's pretty amazing he says in victory day it never gives the inward man a chance to operate we are trying being soul body and spirit but when the natural mind the two spirit spiritual forces that works in you is your mind and your spirit now the macro mind that's highly polished will try to achieve something by his intelligence and when he does that the very thing when he does that he throws himself away from the spiritual man that's in him and there what causes the trouble right there see he tries to make it out himself so we find out that these two vines are in the christian church they are in the true church because they're in you there's two vines in you there's the inner man and the outer man right second corinthians 4 16 says for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day and paul says i love the law and the inward man. so he's talking about a difference between the inward man amen that which has been born again and the outward man which is your old carnal nature your old self amen that's fallen in a hybrid condition will never be right till it's made over again and what is he showing is there's two vines brother banner said these two vines are intertwined where are they intertwined in you you have to see the deception and trickery of the false vine the antichrist and resist him he's not trying to work out there he's not trying to bring you deception through the pentecostal denomination because the pentecostal denomination won't bring you deception you're not going to be deceived by that but you're going to be it's got to be so close that it could deceive the very elect if possible that's how close it has to be so this starts hitting pretty close to home brother branham says in the interval and man never knows what it is to live a victorious life until he completely overcome who who does he completely overcome himself that's the biggest enemy you god is yourself that's the reason you can't rise up in faith because you got intellectuals there your intellectual part says well this and or that or it's reasoning we want to cast down reasoning the bible tells us there's two parts of you two faculties you know when somebody starts to tell you that what you believe isn't reasonable you should shout and say hallelujah i don't want reasonable faith because that's intellectual faith and that will never produce the word of god that's why a seminary has never been able to produce anything but a cold formal powerless church because by intellectual understanding and reasoning and figuring out the word and reasoning out and trying to uh place it and make it work in our modern society and our modern culture will always lead to spiritual death but it's your intellectual part that you're fighting it's your intellectual part it's the intellectual part that that got even trouble it was the intellectual part that the serpent came to and began to reason with her and begin to show her he being ashore that it's beautiful and and it's good to make one wise and and there's nothing wrong with this and there's a better way and you'll know a little bit more and what's wrong with knowing a little bit more oh my goodness that's your enemy you have to completely overcome who yourself hallelujah amen brother branham says in the resurrection of lazarus abel led his lamb away by a grapevine sacrificed him on the altar and abel died on the same altar his sacrifice lamb died and every believer that comes to christ must die on the same altar with his dying lamb christ and die in christ to be a new creature die out to the things of the world become born again a new creature in christ jesus died on the same altar of self-sacrifice you must be born again in 1961 like cain when he slew abel abel died on the altar with his sacrifice after abel offered his sacrifice and killed a sacrifice for his sin then he died on the same altar with his sacrifice in order to be born again you have to die on the altar with your sacrifice just as dead as he was and you're born again now remember jesus didn't die on calvary jesus died in gethsemane amen and we have to come to gethsemane amen praise the lord you have to die to self-will die to self-preservation die to your own ideas die to your own feelings and that's what jesus was doing he was completely dying out in gethsemane he was asking lord if this cup could pass me amen that was a man with intellectuals asking the lord if there's no other way but when the lord would give no other way there was a faith in the man a true seed of god a true god himself in flesh was saying amen amen be it unto me according to thy word let it be but but you see now you see now that he had to die at gethsemane you have to die on the altar with your sacrifice just as dead as he was and you're born again you have to completely overcome who yourself i say lord kill me kill me dead all over again lord let the old vine and me die let thee let the false vine in me die and let christ live the seed is not there with the shuck no to see how close it looks matthew said saint matthew 24 24 the two spirits in the last days the church spirit of the church people and the bride spirit of the bride people would be so close together till it would deceive the very elected if it was possible that's how close that's amazing he said the church spirit of the church people and the bride spirit of the bride people now this can look really really far away until you come home and you realize as brother harold beckett said one time at camp i thought it was amazing he said you don't have to look very far in your church to find three types of believers he said you yourself are three types of believers amen he said your carnal self your flesh is an unbeliever he said your spirit is a make-believer amen but your soul that life in your soul is a genuine believer and so you don't have to look very far to find three types of believers amen you don't have to look very far to find out what the church spirit of the church people is he just wants to put a holy ghost anointing on your spirit brother branham said you can have the holy ghost on your spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell that's how deceptive this is he wants he doesn't mind if you have tingling sensations and you feel the presence of god and when god's sweeping down through the auditorium that you feel it the same as the one next to you feels it he doesn't matter he doesn't care what you feel he doesn't care if you say i believe the message because brother branham said that's fine but that's not it yet that's just being able to read that's being able to take a mental conception and acknowledge that it matches the scriptures and i agree with that but you have to take the life of the message you have to take the life of christ and it's got to come in and you've got to die to everything but that every way of thinking every way of feeling every bit of reasoning that goes against the revealed word of the day you have to completely die out to that what he says about the way we should live and the way we should conduct ourselves and marriage and divorce and the way we dress and the way places we go we have to die to all of our little reasonings and our excuses and our making excuses for why we don't fully obey you've got to die completely die on the sacrifice on the altar with your sacrifice and then you're born again and it's not you that lives it's not you that does the works it's not you it's not a life that you live it's a life he lives through you but he's not going to share the dwelling place with your reasoning he is not going to share the dwelling place with the antichrist spirit that will reason the word and make excuses for why and be in a hybridized condition spiritually that has to die and we can slay that old vine and let it die and receive christ what is christ christ what is he he's the word made manifest we can receive jesus christ the living word may manifest in our hour and bring newness of life then it's not a life you live it's the word life living through you if you receive the word and let the washing of the water the word sanctify you and wash out how's it going to wash out you say that's true you said it it's true i commit myself to it and let the word wash it out of you it didn't say you wash yourself the washing of the water of the word washes it out of you but you can't resist it you have to submit to it hallelujah let's take our seals book and the second seal and turn to paragraph 212. page 184 the seals book paragraph 2 12 it says now watch satan's duty is to pervert the word of god to wisdom's reasonings satan's duty let's get this if you want to find out what his job description is satan's duty is to pervert the word of god to wisdom's reasonings then he marks his subjects by rejecting the original word they don't reject the hybrid word they don't reject the reasoned word they don't reject the word it's been passed down from denomination denomination denomination and mixed with ideas and entered into the message with mixed ideas and stayed mixed with ideas that's not that's not that's not what they receive he marks them by rejecting the original word and that's what malachi 4 came to do that's what revelation 10 7 came to do is bring us back to the original faith of the original fathers and when we reject that we've been marked amen so now let's look at this second seal i told you before when brother branham said now we just have to suffer a little while that that's the second seal and some of you looked at me like what in the world are you talking about let's let's look at what he says in paragraph 3 17. of the second seal page 197 and the second seal page 197 paragraph 317 he said now they that sure they should kill one another they should kill each other his bow had no arrows at first but his great sword did he done his killing later and changed from white horse to red horse the same exact devil with the sword now remember see he doesn't want to stay on the white horse so there's a battle plan here there was a battle in heaven the battle in heaven came to earth and it's playing out the same thing that took place there is just repeating down here and so and so we find out that the first thing in heaven was a battle lucifer was kicked out and come to earth and he polluted eden then he's been polluting ever since and now from the battle in heaven it's come to the battle on earth and it's finished on earth at the time of the battle of armageddon now anyone knows that the battle started in heaven and so they kicked them out michael and his angels overthrew them just ran out and when they did he dropped right down in eden and here started the battle down here god had his children all fortified up by his word but eve stuck her neck out and i believe you're right maybe and there it went and it's been ever since same tactics same plan same thing what he did in heaven he's doing now he drops down to eden and what does he do in eden when he goes down to eden he doesn't get a troop of baboons he doesn't go and start a church of the serpent he doesn't do any of that he comes right down and he wants to go where god's at he wants to work where god's working he wants to be he wants the destruction of god's children amen in the discrediting of god's word he had serpents that were so close they were almost like humans they could talk with humans they could be a walk in an upright condition they may have been stronger they were intelligent they he could have built mass vast armies with the with the serpent but he didn't want the serpent they mean he was only going to use the serpent to get even closer he wants to be where god is he wants to work where god's working and then he wants to take over where god's ruling so now we see his tactics we're not to be deceived so he comes in with a white horse this white horse he has a bow but no arrows he really can't hurt you and he has no crown but he receives a crown and he comes forth to conquer now you have to understand we talked about this i think last sunday we have to understand his purpose is to conquer but how does he conquer he conquers by deception it's the deceitful spirit that's gone now and corrupt then what's the deception i'm not here to conquer you i have no arrows i have no crown i'm not here to hurt you i'm not here to conquer you when the nicolaitan spirit started off it was just a saying and the staying was deeds and man it was just a fellowship amongst ministers what's wrong with the fellowship amongst ministers but then it became a doctrine and it began to rule amen so it starts off i'm not here to hurt you i have no arrows i'm not wearing a crown i have no authority over you i mean you can come and go as you please you can jump in this compromising out anytime you want you can take a little it's okay it's not going to hurt you you can defy what the prophet of god said just a little bit it's all right god still loves you that's what he told eve he told eve the same exact thing well surely surely god wouldn't kill you i mean come on you're a daughter of god you're a child of god you come out of adam he loves adam he loves you he's not going to kill you and so he's coming in why through deception and the deception he's coming to conquer but he never looks like he's coming to conquer he looks like he's just coming to fellowship and then when you come in he receives a crown and in the early church who crowned this white horse rider it was the church themselves that put the crown on his head and it's you yourself to give the white horse authority when he shows up at your door with reasoning against the word with compromise on the word of god he shows up and he's got no authority over you he has no arrows he can do nothing to you all you have to do is roar as a lion with the pure word of god and say does not the scripture say did not the prophet teach us doesn't the word tell us amen and he'll flee from you because he has no arrows and he has no crown but when you entertain that compromise when you entertain that deception and bring it in you put the crown on his head and when you put the crown on his head he changes horses and now he comes as a red horse see first stage white horse he was a teacher but an antichrist spirit in his doctrine and his quality it was innocent it couldn't hurt nothing seemed like couldn't hurt anything seemed like how can this little video hurt you how can this little thing hurt your kids how how how can this hurt you it couldn't hurt you seemed like right just going on that's the way satan comes in he's a slick bird but god raised up a standard brother bam said satan raises up those four horses watch the strudent there's this fellow that we're talking about here satan we're unfolding him right here just stripping him down by the scriptures and letting you see who he is what's supposed to be done you remember he's not tried to go in and be a communist satan hasn't he's an antichrist so close that jesus said would deceive the very elect don't look around for the white horse you look right here for the white horse but god raised up a standard against it the pure word which is christ paul's teaching brother benham said paul was roaring out those early apostles roaring out with the pure word of god with the pure revelation of the word they were writing the bible that you and i are still reading amen and that was the combat to this antichrist spirit of white horse and it's still the combat to the antichrist spirit of white horse and brother branham came to restore us back to the original teaching he said when he went beyond the curtain of time they say you have to be judged with your group he said well paul has to be judged and he said yes he said well good because i preached what paul preached and the millions that were there which is you and i i was standing there and i hollered we're resting on that and i'm still resting on that that he preached what paul preached amen and if paul was a vindicated messenger if he was a light to the gentiles the fulfillment of old testament prophecies if he laid it down and brother brethren restored it back to us god cannot change his word amen god cannot manipulate his word god has to honor his word and if we went back to the original faith of the original fathers then i am resting on that how many of you are resting on that hallelujah that's what defeats the white horse don't forsake god has given us through miraculous vindication god has put his seal on the message of the hour don't you reason it those things you read that you don't understand that don't compute you can't add them up don't you go to reasoning it don't you go to get out your spiritual calculator and try to work out the formula you just wait till god reveals it don't reason it don't question it don't cast it to the side you just wait because in the hour we have need of it god will reveal it the prophet of god told us the same thing in the seals i can't turn to it right now but he said that the disciples come to him and said now we know that you're the son of god for no man can do these things let's be of the father and brother braham said jesus must look at him said oh now do you know amen now do you know i mean it's been so long with you and you don't know me now you know right and so the disciples were walking with the lord much like we have been for 50 some years and saying oh now i get it it was jesus christ that came down in 1963. it was the mighty angel it was the theophany king theophany it was christ amen come down in the fullness of his word with the full life of the word that was christ oh i get it now now you get it are you are you just now getting it so the the bible pattern never changes disciples are with him sleeping with him talking to him he's there watching over them instructing them doing everything amen through the message of the hour they're listening to the tapes and they're not realizing it this is king theophanies come down and all of a sudden we say oh now i know this is the lord of glory in this word amen this that i'm receiving when i take this word in and get that life that's the king theophany life amen hallelujah that's the life of jesus christ and so now i said he said now you know and brother branham said this it's interesting in the seals he said see maybe it wasn't supposed to be until just that time there god's awakening things in your heart now he's awakening things in his bride right now and maybe it's just not supposed to be in this till this time but when he's troubling the waters get in when he's troubling the waters jump in when you see him stirring when you see the word when he's unlocking and unveiling it you throw yourself in there as fast as you can and you say god i want it all amen if it scours me if it tears the height off of me i want it all because the way i lived last year is not good enough what i've accepted for 50 years is not good enough we're supposed to be growing in the knowledge and grace of christ jesus we're supposed to be growing into the head which is christ we're not supposed to be staying the way we were receiving the message 50 years ago and believing god sent a prophet and there's malachi forward and that the seals are open that's not good enough for a rapture if it was good enough for a rapture we would have taken a rapture but he's got to bring a greater revelation and a greater revelation comes with a greater cost and a greater sincerity we've got to come to this feast of passover not with the old unleavened bread of malice and wickedness but we come to this feast of passover which is what christ our passover lamb we must come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth amen that's what the that's what the lord told the prophet when the prophet of god amen he saw this a vision of this mamba snake trying to bite his friend amen and that's the worst kind he said the worst devil that was satan himself trying to bite him and he couldn't buy it brother brandon was trying to bite him and he said you have the power to bind him but you must be more sincere and brother venom started to speak and he bound him and he says you can unbind him too why would you ever want to unbind the serpent i mean we all want to bind him but why would you want to unbind him brother man is seeing a principle here life and death is in the power of the tongue we have the power by the restored word of god through sincerity and truth to bind the serpent but you also have the power to unbind him in your life as soon as brother branham unbound that serpent he went right back come right after him he was going after doing the same thing he was doing before he has to be bound but only in sincerity but you have the power also to unbind that certain that's why when compromise comes in and we agree with and we reason on the word we begin to unbind the serpent and we find out he starts to do things to us we don't like and take us down past we don't like when we find out a little ways down the road that we don't like where we're at and how did we get here and why am i here and why is my life dry and why am i in my dark ages why is everything why am i in a desert place amen did you unbind the serpent by a confession different than the word brother branham was struggling with this it must be more sincere and he asked the lord to show him and his bible opens to this passage in scripture and it says you you have to come to this feast of passover not with the leavened bread of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth you know what brother branham said he did he said i started fasting and praying fasting and praying he realized that what i have isn't enough this is the prophet of god he's coming to a greater revelation that he can bind this serpent and but he has to do it he can only do it through sincerity and truth amen the disciples came one time to jesus and they weren't able to cast out a demon remember there was no problem with the promise no problem with the word but they had to have a different level of sincerity and jesus said why why is your faith so small and he cast him out and he said this one comes out not but by prayer and fasting so when brother venom finds out he combined this serpent and the lord shows him that you have to keep this feast of passover with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth you can be sincere and sincerely wrong amen you can be you can have the truth and not be sincere but when you put sincerity together with truth now you're keeping the feast of the passover which is the crucified jesus christ so brother venom had to be more sincere brothers and sisters we're not cruising along waiting for god to do something in heaven are we getting to the time we're getting to the time all right king wraps your time rapturing faith comes down and all of a sudden we go up he's given us rapturing grace it lies on them tapes and it's got to convert by revelation to rapturing faith precept upon precept line upon line here a little there a little what's he doing he's building his church into the full stature of jesus christ and will manifest it with the full power that jesus christ had when he was here on earth we're cut we've got to be growing into it we can't just be cruising along riding brother branham's coattails into the rapture you know sitting around and saying i believe the message it's all going to be all right with me he says you get into the message you receive the messenger you receive the life and then that life has to grow into rapturing faith a church should be growing into a rapturing condition if you find your life sliding backwards or staying level the same way it's been for years my fire and my zeal and my hunger for the word of god if you find that it's hard to listen to tapes it's difficult to read books that come in the church as exciting as it used to be you're in a backslid condition you need to get back amen to the fervency and desire for the word of god come back to sincerity and truth start fasting and praying and say god bring me back my first love that i'll do the first works i'm growing cold and formal and powerless that's the works of the devil you shouldn't have a powerless religion when the devil comes and strikes your home there should be a consecration in that home of sincerity and truth that can take the word and believe it and cast the devil out god hates a powerless religion amen where are we supposed to be all right let's go back we want to bring up the red horse second seal let's read now back on page 197 of the second seal paragraph 317. they should kill one another they should kill each other his bow had no arrows at first but his great sword did he done his killing later and changed from white horse to red horse the same exactly the devil with the sword what did jesus say jesus said they that take the sword will perish by it don't fight back remember when i said in the beginning he said we must suffer just a little while i said that's the second seal now listen he says if you take the sword you'll perish by it don't fight back jesus that night when he when he told said that to peter took his sword and just do like he did just go ahead now now remember he has got a sword he is going forth a sword in his hand riding red horse wading through the blood of everybody that disagrees with him now do you understand it how many understands what the seal is now he just told you what the seal is all right let's read it again in case you missed it remember the seal is represented by a red horse this antichrist has got off his white horse he's now riding his red horse this red horse is given a sword his objective was to take peace from the earth and kill that they might kill one another in fact let's read that we want to catch that in revelations chapter 6 i don't want to miss this verse three chapter six verse three and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword so objective is to take peace from the earth and to kill one another so here here we have in the garden of gethsemane jesus is now he's now here he knows his hour has come it's time it's time for him to lay down his life he's wrestled out in gethsemane he's asked if there's another way he knows there's no other way so jesus is now taking the ox anointing because the knock anointing is a sacrificial animal it lays down its life and it bears under burdens not like the lion but now like the ox and now jesus has wrestled it out in gethsemane and now he's ready to lay down his life he told him he was going to now that he wrestled it out now the time has come but but peter is not in the same anointing with jesus peter is under a different influence than what jesus is under peter was sleeping while jesus was praying and peter wasn't catching the same spirit that jesus was catching amen and he said what did jesus say he said i'm in first i'm in uh uh back in the seals second seal paragraph 3 18. what did jesus say they that take the sword will perish by it don't fight back jesus that night when he told said that and peter took his sword he said just do like he did just go ahead now remember he's got a great sword he's going forth a sword in his hand riding red horse wading through the blood of everybody that disagrees with him now do you understand it how many understands what the seal is now how many here understand what the seal is now the antichrist spirit is going through killing everyone who disagrees with him but the spirit of christ now is not fighting back surrendering and laying down his life keep reading peter was not under the right anointing if he was in the right anointing he would have caught the same anointing jesus christ caught but peter was not yet converted and he did not have the right anointing peter is moving through the seals and i want to show you that let's read in matthew 16. matthew chapter 16. it's a great portion of scripture we read it all the time verse 13. when jesus come unto the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremiah are one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and sent unto him blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so here we find out peter comes to a direct revelation from the father of who jesus christ is he's standing here in the whole world in turmoil on who this is and he says who do you say this is and he says daughter christ the son of the living god he says flesh and blood never told it to you revealed to you my father which is in heaven and besides this i'm going to give you the keys to the kingdom so peter's got himself in a good spot if you were there and the lord had just told you that and spoken to you you'd be like i got it i got it i know who he is i have a personal revelation from the father of who the son is and i've got the keys of the kingdom of promise to me everything's in the bag i'm okay peter's chums with the lord you know i saw it lord loves me i'm the best because they were always arguing over who's going to be the chief among them they're carnal in their mind they're always disputing back and forth who should be the chief who should be among them when he comes on his throne who's going to be the chief deputy of the land they've got carnal thinking carnal understanding missing what's going on spiritually now hear peter who's been wondering who's going to be the best now he says oh you got it nobody else got it you got it and you're getting the keys if you were peter how would you feel pretty good verse 20. very next verse that he charged the disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus christ drop down the very next thing that happens from that time forth began jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go into jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day so the next revelation he brings them after this incident is that he has to go and be killed amen he has to go and be killed and raised again the third day then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee but he turned and said unto him peter get thee behind me satan thou are an offense unto me for thou savers not the things that be of god but the things that be of men what a turn of events for peter he had it all wrapped up everything was going good and and he says one thing and the lord turns around and says get thee behind me satan how would you like the lord to look at you and say get thee behind me satan what was it peter was under the influence of the white horse rider because the white horse rider is trying to reason the word because he knew jesus christ was the son of god he was the christ he was the word and the word just said i'm going to be killed and i'm going to be raised again the third day that's the word that's thus saith the lord and now peter starts to reason with thus saith the lord and whenever you reason with thus saith the lord that's the antichrist spirit amen peter no doubt loved the lord no doubt didn't want to see this happen in his intellectual mind and his reasoning thinking everything's going so good that's not going to happen he begins to rebuke the lord he repeat begins to rebuke the person of the word himself and say far be it from thee that shall not happen and jesus turns right around and he he doesn't say peter this is you he says peter that he says get thee behind me satan he recognizes this is the same white horse that was riding in eden this is the same thing that came to me in the wilderness this is the same spirit now it's in peter speaking back to me look how close the deception is friends peter just got a divine revelation from the father himself the father god dropped into peter an understanding of who jesus was and jesus says you're going to get the kingdom the keys to the kingdom and immediately after that the white horse anointing the antichrist comes right into the same vessel and speaks back to jesus out of the same lips that our revelation from god is now speaking antichrist words and jesus recognized it like that he said get thee behind me satan see the deception friends you cannot reason the word of god if these things have to happen they have to happen if these things have to be this way it has to be this way because does sayeth the lord it ain't changing anything that would try to get you to say something different than the message is an antichrist spirit and it comes from satan jesus was there the messenger of the hour the word made manifest he'd come in the ministry of a prophet he was standing there on earth as a prophet prophesying that i must go and i must be abused and i must be killed and i'll raise again the third day and peter was denying the prophetic ministry of the saith the lord same thing happens to us when we reason with brother branham reason the message try to properly place what he was saying correct him where he was wrong on the word oh my goodness friends that's the white horse that's the white horse anointing you better be careful with that kind of talk you better stay away from that if you don't understand it say i don't understand it if it doesn't make sense you say it doesn't make sense to me but don't you dare say he was wrong you wait till god gives you a revelation or you find in the message where brother branham switches or he says i was wrong on that but you don't dare tell him he was wrong that's the antichrist spirit trying to get you to reason the word coming in like he did the eve coming in like he tried to jesus he went directly to jesus it wouldn't work so what's he always do he always comes through number two you think you think that lucifer did not see this whole thing with with who do men say that i am and the revelation that comes and now peter's going to get the keys to the kingdom amen do you think lucifer didn't see that so where does lucifer goes he always goes to number two and tries to get to number one hallelujah we love the lord the devil is being exposed the scriptures are stripping him down the word and the word only so this is peter now think about this that seed dropped in peter's heart now we don't we don't have any record that peter repented from what he said to the lord we don't have any record that he repented the lord rebuked him but we have no other record that peter ever come to repentance for allowing the white horse to to influence him for saying something than what the word says we're trying to reason the word so let's turn over to matthew 26. we're going to the garden of gethsemane you're going to see the progression of the antichrist remember he doesn't want to stay on the white horse he wants to get on a different horse matthew 26 verse 47 and while he spake lo judas one of the twelve came with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people now he that betrayed him gave him a sign saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same as he hold him fast and forthwith he came to jesus and said hail master and kissed him and jesus said unto him friend wherefore thou come then came they and laid his hands on jesus and took him now i want you to stop for a minute jesus knows good and well who judas is he knows what judas is doing because he told judas he looked at him when he dipshot with him he said what thou must do do it quickly and judas went out he knew he was the son of perdition from the beginning he knew it when he chose him he knew it from the beginning who he was and he knew what he was doing that night of the last supper when he went away but look at what jesus says to him he says friend wherefore art thou come you know in billy paul's testimony he said you couldn't tell brother branham's enemies from his friends jesus has wrestled it out in gethsemane and now they're coming to betray him they're coming to kill him and what's he doing he's laying down his life and he's not fighting back this is the second seal friends this is our example then came they laid hands on jesus and took him and behold one of them which were with jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and smote off his ear now i just want to take note that he was not trying to cut off his ear we have to realize the objective with the sword here was not the ear he was trying to kill this man he was trying to split his skull up and trying to cut his head off i don't know who weaved and who wagged and who zigged and who zagged but whatever happened he missed and hit his ear amen he said he drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and smote off his ear then said jesus and him put up again thy sword into his place for all those that take the sword shall perish with the sword thinketh down that i cannot now pray to my father and he shall present presently give me more than 12 legions of angels but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be here he's walking in the word he's catching the right anointing for the hour the right spirit to combat the antichrist if jesus would have fought back he wouldn't have been jesus because what's jesus doing he's walking in full surrender to the word what the word says you must die he's going to die he's not fighting it he's not reasoning he's not running away and hiding he's not hoping that the whole thing will blow over he's facing it like an ox because he's got the ox anointing upon him but peter peter received seeds of discrepancy all the way back when jesus was first talking and saying that i'll be killed and i'll raise again the third day there was a seed of discrepancy that dropped into peter's heart from the antichrist spirit and he rebuked the lord and he refused the word and he reasoned with it and said you'll not be killed and he was rebuked but he didn't repent and the white horse just changed to the red horse in peter's life because he took a sword and tried to kill see he doesn't want to stay on the white horse friends something as simple as just saying oh lord you're not going to die turned into peter trying to kill a man and jesus under the oxenoin thing picks the man's ear up or touches his touches his ear and heals him jesus tells us we see the same story in the book of john they come to him he says whom do you seek they said jesus he says i am he and they all fall backwards think about this he's demonstrating he has the power to smite them all dead he has the power to deliver himself that's what he told peter put up the sword think not that i cannot pray to the father and he'll send me 12 legions of angels but then how is the word going to be fulfilled because i have to walk with the word the word and the word only but the antichrist is constantly trying to stop the word peter was under an antichrist anointing trying to stop the word and it looked so good it looked like he was defending the lord that he was fighting for jesus christ he was defending the message of the hour against all the hypocrites against all the right and he had the wrong anointing under the wrong spirit and he was trying to kill see when the enemy comes in like a flood god will raise a standard against it don't fight back he said let's look at the second seal paragraph 197 paragraph 197 on page 182 of the seal book that's the same thing today haven't you heard these old devils come say if you believe in divine healing here's somebody's eye won't you open their eyes smite me blind smite me blind that's the same old devil come down off the cross we would believe you if you be the son of god turn these stones in the bread same devil you just walk away see don't fight back you just walk away see no that's the way jesus did it he never clowned for any of them put a rag over over his hand over his precious eyes like that and they took a stick and they hit him on top the head said tell us if you're a prophet now tell us who hit you they changed the stick one to another now tell us who hit you and we'll believe you're a prophet he never opened his mouth he just sat there see he don't clown he just does as the father says you see lets them go ahead their time is coming don't worry yes sir now they touch this garment they left no they felt no virtue so he's saying they're beating jesus jesus knows who's beating him they're putting a rag over his eyes and mocking him you're a prophet tell us who's hit you he knows but he doesn't speak a word because he's under the ox anointing he's bearing down under the burden amen he's sacrificing his life why because that's what the word calls for in the second seal he talks about people making fun of the christians he says they that's what they say while you bunch of holy rollers why you got you get he says you bunch of holy rollers and now brother says why we get the world the meek shall inherit the world that's what jesus said we don't have to fight back let's go to genesis i want to start showing the progression of the seals so we can see that these seals unlock the mystery of the whole bible genesis chapter 3. this is after the woman's deceived she gives also to the man and then we're going to pick up that story here in verse 6 chapter 3 verse 6. and when the women sold that the tree was good for food and then it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden you know why when you begin to deviate from the word it's hard to come to church this is it right here they had disobeyed the word of god they had deviated and now it's hard to come to church it's hard to listen to the message it's hard to read the books it's hard why because you've broken fellowship it's broken fellowship and now here they are in broken fellowship why because of the lie of the white horse the power the anointing of the white horse sowing a seed of discrepancy just something that looked good but it wasn't good looked innocent wasn't innocent and they sowed that seed of discrepancy and they received what came from the white horse and now they're in broken fellowship with god and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called him to adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself and he said who told thee thou was naked now here's the question who told thee that i was naked hast thou eaten of the tree wherewith i commanded thee that thou shall does not eat and the man said the woman gave me and i did eat and the lord said unto the woman what is this that thou has done so he asked her what have you done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me here we've just changed from white horse to red horse now there's strife amongst the family of god what used to be perfect harmony in the garden of eden all the beasts were in harmony with adam and the woman and the man and the woman were in perfect harmony from one another amen they were in perfect harmony with the serpent everything was in perfect harmony there was no strife no malice no wars no rumorings no backbitings none of those things they weren't there until after the white horse came in and when they accepted the white horse he changes horses and he goes right to division and strife because his job is to take peace from the earth his job is to take peace from your earth his job is to take peace from your family from your home between you and your children between you and your wife between you and your brothers and sisters in the church that's the red horse anointing whenever there's strife and conflict that's the influence of the red horse until we begin to fight he says when you bite one another be careful lest you be consumed one of another immediately the white horse switches to the red horse adam who told you you were naked that woman woman what has thou done that serpent from harmony to war instantly you want to know why there's strife in your home go find where the white horse come in go back and find where the white horse has come in and led the compromise compromise will come to strife and when you come to strife amen you have to recognize that there's only one power in the world that will ever break the power of the red horse that's the anointing of the ox because you can never fight the red horse with the red horse if you fight the red horse with the red horse then antichrist wins but the only way to break the power of the red horse anointing is with the ox anointing the red horse come against jesus christ to kill him he took the ox anointing and under the ox anointing he completely broke the power of the red horse anointing to a now in the church ages they would give their lives willingly and freely and with joy they would make a sacrifice of themselves why because the the sacrifice that went before them had broke the power of the red horse and now the red horse had no power over them and now they would give their lives in the dark ages through persecution they would give them willingly they would give it freely why because i've already overcome because that was the anointing that was on the age and that was the power that would break the power of the red horse remember under that anointing the church was growing the church wasn't supposed to start an army they weren't supposed to get a militia they weren't supposed to go join themselves with another government to deliver themselves they were supposed the seed was supposed to go into the ground and die they were under an anointing and that anointing was to give their lives for the gospel amen and it was breaking the power of the red horse if they had aligned themselves with the government if they had found themselves a militia or got a bunch of armaments and trained for war they would have been the red horse fighting the red horse somebody has to take the auxinoid thing if there's red horse in your home and every day it's strife and conflict and war and fighting somebody has got to take the red horse anointing somebody's got to become a sacrificial animal somebody's got to lay down their life when they lay down their life it's going to break the power of the red horse because when the enemy comes in like a flood god raises a standard against it to combat it he said so how did he combat the red horse with the ox hallelujah you see now where white horse always moves to red horse cane came under the influence of the white horse the antichrist he tries to produce a substitute different than what revelation would have given him so he comes up with a beautiful altar with a beautiful sacrifice that took a lot of work he labored for a long time to to plant the fields and to produce the flowers and to produce the vegetables and he worked and he labored and he worked and he labored and he was doing according to his own intellect according to his own mind he was going to worship the lord the way that he thought it was the best way to worship the lord but god doesn't want worship the way you think you should worship the lord he wants worshipped according to revelation of the true word that's the way he receives worship and that's the way when abel abel didn't work abel didn't labor abel had a requirement and the requirement was blood he had to bring a lamb and he had to kill it he had a work to do but his work was based on revelation he wasn't saved by his works he was saved by revelation his works was evidence that he had faith so his works taking a lamb and slaying it was evidence that he received the revelation of what it took to be free a substitute offering cain received no revelation so cain is working and laboring and producing something that the the antichrist spirit is telling him this is good this is beautiful look it's it it'll make you wise you look wise you look intelligent producing this it's beautiful it's desirable it's all the same thing that he fell by he produces this and it's not accepted abel waits for revelation from the lord and he gets revelation on the eternal word that never changes see because the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world but god wrote his bible before there was ever paper in ink this was already written this was already word that word is unchangeable that word is eternal and that word will never change and so abel had to wait for revelation of the word that was already written to tell him how to overcome his situation and the only way that he could overcome it was by the blood of an innocent lamb because that was already written in the word of god before moses ever penned it hallelujah we didn't get our bible over the last 6 000 years we've had a bible before there was a earth there was a bible when he set the stars in the heaven he wrote the bible amen before he wrote the bible it was complete in his mind amen it's we're just now coming to what's always been we're just now learning what he's always known and what he's always desired and what he's always wanted we're just now stepping into what's always been a reality so now abel has to come that way by revelation of the word he comes by revelation of the word and his sacrifice is accepted why he comes under the lion anointing the pure word hallelujah how did paul get it by revelation how did abel get it by revelation what was it the pure word so with the lion anointing he offers the sacrifice he's accepted now cain is wrath why is he angry because he's moving to red horse anointing antichrist is changing his tactics changing his power he's leaving innocency he's leaving i can't hurt you he's leaving it's just an idea it's just a way to worship it's just a nice plan and he's moving into wrath god comes to cain and says just do as abel does and will it not be well with thee and then we find out he goes and he has a conversation with abel and it's not recorded but brother branham said it's like a love letter you got to read between the lines he goes and has a conversation with abel and somehow during this conversation he becomes so angry that he kills abel what did abel say i'm curious because the whole con the whole discussion was why was your sacrifice of substitution blood we accept it and why was mine of works of my hand and fruit like mama ate an apple or there's a problem in the blood brother said cain thought that it was an apple so he thought giving fruits was the right sacrifice abel realized that there was a problem in the blood and he gave blood and so now this discussion is all about why is mine not accepted and why is yours so if abel would have just simply childlike gave him the revelation that he had of the word it would have exposed cain for who he was and cain got so angry he killed his brother why did he kill his brother he had moved from white horse to red horse take peace from the earth that they might kill one another this just didn't happen in the church ages this has always been happening this happened in heaven before it came to earth he's exposing the tactics of the devil he's exposing his battle plan he's exploding the riding path of the horse rider so that we can see him and resist him and stand against him and we know exactly how to stand against if you stand just like abel abel didn't fight back he gave up his life brother branham said he died on the altar with his sacrifice hallelujah that's our example friends follow every pattern in the bible and you'll follow this pattern of the of of the horse riders and the four living creatures i want to look at one more before we go let's look at numbers together we can go everywhere we can find this everywhere we're just going to look in the book of numbers numbers chapter 20. numbers chapter 20 verse 2. and there was no water for the congregation and they gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron and the people chode with moses and spake saying would god that we had died with our brethren died before the lord and why have you brought up the congregation of the lord into this wilderness that we and our cattle should die there and therefore have you made us to come up out of egypt to bring us into this evil place it is no place of seed or figs or vines or pomegranates neither is there any water to drink so here we have a pretty bad situation for moses the congregation gathers together there's no water and they start chiding against him again they've done this multiple times and here they come why did you lead us out this isn't a place of pomegranates and water and all these things that you talked about why did you bring us out of egypt why did you why did you why did you and moses is saying all i ever did was what the lord said moses is walking in pure obedience to the word that's all he's doing he's not doing anything the word's doing it through him he's not leading them the pillar of fire is leading them he's not making decisions the lord's making decisions he's being led by the word and when he's being led by the word now they're attacking him for following the word and they're blaming him for all their problems just like people like to blame the message for their children going into the world they like to blame brother branham for the breakup of their marriage it isn't brother branham's fault it isn't the message fault it's your own disobedience to the word of god that caused it you have let the white horse deceive you in doing something other than the word amen and it's caused destruction in your life destruction in your family it's not the message's fault and just because there was a man who misrepresented the message don't blame brother branham and don't believe jesus christ because the message is jesus christ and the minute you say it's the message is fall you're saying it's jesus christ's fault because when you say why did you why did you why did you if it was done according to the word you're pointing your finger right at god you have to be careful about the way we speak with our mouths hallelujah so moses in obedience to the word comes to strife they come against him verse 6 and moses and aaron went from the presence of the assembly into the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon their faces and the glory of the lord appeared unto them and the lord spake unto moses saying take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and heir and thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and that shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation in their beast drink and moses took the rod from before the lord as he commanded him and moses and aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock and he said unto him here now ye rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and moses lifted up his hand and with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beast also and the lord spake unto moses and aaron because you believe me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which i have given you what did moses do that was so wrong moses took the red horse anointing every other time that they would come against moses god would say separate yourself i'm going to destroy them and start over with you they'd come to moses why have they let us out here we're gonna die out here why have you brought us out here that our children will die and and god would go to moses or moses would go to god and god would say separate yourself i'm gonna smite them and what did moses do moses would throw himself in the breach and brother branham said that was the spirit of christ in moses he said i used to say how is it his brother remember used to be confused by this passage of scripture you say how is it that that moses could give god a better idea when god said i'm going to smite him kill him and start over and moses said no don't and the lord repented himself from what he was going to do how is it that moses could change the lord's mind because it wasn't it was not changing his mind it was coming to his original thought he was testing moses because why there had to be be a display of the life of christ god had to say he would destroy the people so moses could throw himself in the gap and he took the spirit of christ again and again and again but moses had finally had enough they come against him and he said ye rebels now he's fighting back and when moses fights back it keeps him out of the promised land let's read another passage in deuteronomy let's go to deuteronomy 27. deuteronomy 27 verse 12. in deuteronomy our numbers i'm sorry i'm i told you wrong numbers not deuteronomy numbers 27 verse 12 and the lord said unto moses get thee up unto this mount abram and see the land which i have given unto the children of israel and when thou has seen it thou also shall be gathered into thy people as aaron thy brother was gathered for ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of zen in the strife of the congregation to sanctify me at the water before their eyes that is the water of meribah and kadesh in the wilderness of sin this word meribah the waters of maribel means strife in the waters of strife this is why moses was kept out of the promised land let's go to psalms we're going to it's going to become even more apparent in psalms psalms 106. psalms 106 verse 32. in psalms 106 verse 32 says they angered him also at the waters of strife so that he went ill with moses for their sakes because they provoked his spirit so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips to catch that why was moses kept out of the promised land they provoked him they provoked him they angered him also at the waters of strife meribah so that it went ill with moses for their sakes because of them their strife it went bad for moses why because moses was supposed to take the anointing of christ and he took the anointing of antichrist because they provoked his spirit so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips brother branham said in the second seal he rose up in the time of moses you know how they did and wanted to say well you're not the only holy one in the bunch and nathan and core and god said just separate yourselves i'll just up the earth and swallow them you see then the people got to complaining i'll just take the whole thing away and there moses took the place of christ then to throw himself in the breach and say don't do it lord of course after he'd ordained moses to do this he didn't come over moses because he was acting like christ in that time it was christ in moses see brother brown tells us the story of elisha and the she bears when those children were they were they were making fun and mocking elijah and elisha called for two she-bears to come out of the wilderness and kill the children and it was because of the disrespect of their parents for the servant of god and they began to sow seeds of discrepancy and just saying things against elijah and elisha now in his anger against that he takes the wrong anointing and brother branham said that wasn't the spirit of christ he said he was wrong moses he said things out of his lips that was unadvisable unadvisedly spoke out of his lips and it kept him from the promised land elijah he did this and he shouldn't have done it and brother branham the lord comes to brother benjamin said there's a trap for you tonight what's the trap the trap while he's preaching he realizes there's two a young couple and a boy and a girl down sitting in the front and they're making out and they're making a scene and making a mockery of christianity and it's upsetting the prophet amen and they just won't stop and they just won't stop and they just won't stop and finally the lord tells him whatever you say he could smite them dead they could have all manner of diseases whatever judgment he wants to judge them with he can judge him he's getting upset he's asking to stop they won't stop they're causing a disruption he's being upset in the spirit and the lord said whatever you say and he looked at them and says i forgive you why moses had failed elisha had failed but here he comes amen after after we received the atonement under jesus christ after he come and received the holy ghost the spirit of christ now he looks down and he says i forgive you brother man comes to a message i'd like for you to listen to it if you can call standing in the gap and the whole message is about this standing in the gap and he finds out i got upset with the people i was angry with them because i thought they should have received the message he preaches after the seals and they've rejected the seals and he says i was calling them rickies and requettas and god give me to understand that i shouldn't do that i lost the feeling for the people what is this he wasn't wanting to stand in the gap anymore he wasn't wanting to lay in the breach he wasn't wanting to take the ox anointing for the people anymore he was upset he was angry he felt like they had rejected him he felt like they should have heard the message and god comes and rebukes him he's driving down the road and he's having these thoughts of i'm just going to be like an old testament prophet i'm going to go off into the wilderness and i'm going to stomp out this is a man under hurt feelings i'm going to stomp out and deliver my message and go back and he said that was just an excuse so i could finish it hunt and do what i wanted and he said he sees all of a sudden there's two bums eating next to them they get up and one of them looks like fletcher broy hill his his brother-in-law and it's him brother bram sees himself as a bomb with his brother-in-law fletcher roy hill who's a bomb living on the streets and he sees them together and even billy paul says dad that looks like you and fletch and they guys pay and they leave brother branham's driving down the road and billy paul falls asleep and the lord begins to speak to him you go through with your plans you'll be just like the bone your wife will leave you you'll be a bum and brother branham goes through this whole thing and he recognizes the lord in his mercy shows him a mountain range with seven peaks and says your name is written in that mountain that's your ministry that's a sign that's an everlasting sign that you're supposed to be doing what you're doing and brother branham has to repent and he comes and that's what that's what standing in the gap is all about it's all about this he says he says i'm like moses moses lost the feeling for his people and i've lost the feeling for the people and he's struggling with this but he surrenders he repents amen he comes to a place brother venom is in the message and questions and answers on the seals this is just an example he says then the fellow here trying to debate it once here in the tabernacle said brother branham was wiggled out of all of them he won't he won't this one said he's talking about the godhead and this man is debating with brother branham and the tabernacle here it shows three different persons exactly perfectly said matthew third chapter here was john standing preaching here come the son walking up to be baptized he went in the water and was baptized by john went back out of the water and low he said the heavens was open unto him and he said down from the heaven came the holy ghost like a dub descending and the voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son the three distinct persons right at one oh my you know it just goes to show that people without the baptism and not called to the officers of the minister has no business to be in the pulpit that's right i could take that person now by the help of god and tie them in such a knot it take and make their head swim look i don't care what he pauses he says now i don't mean that now that don't sound right forgive me i didn't mean that lord i didn't know i felt him check me on that so i didn't mean to say it that way i'm sorry i believe that the holy spirit could reveal to the person some secret that sounds better that sounds better he wouldn't take the red horse anointing he wouldn't fight back when somebody railed against him now don't don't be mistaken the ox anointing is no weak anointing brother branham was death on sin he would stand in the pulpit and he would rip the height off of the devil night after night after night you can strive with the devil you can fight with spirits you can call out sin but the moment he went to a person god rebuked him you don't go after people jesus comes and he's laying out the word he's laying out the principles and he says you can't receive me because you're not part of me because i come from the word and he's laying this out and and they ask him a question he gives them the word they ask him a question they give him the word when the pharisees and sadducees ran out of word they started calling him names you're bl's above you have a devil you're mad you're illegitimate born they called him every name but why they were destroying his character they went to character brother ben said there's more than one way to kill a man you don't have to stick a knife in his back to kill him you run down his character and hurt his influence it's the same as killing him what were they doing to jesus they were killing his influence running down his character amen the same thing that happens in churches all the time same thing that happens amongst ministry all the time what is it it's nothing but the red horse anointing trying to kill taking away peace so that they kill one another you kill their influence you attack their character brother brenham said you're guilty of it they ran out of word and when they run out of the word they went to name calling but jesus never went back to name calling he would call out their condition no problem that's in the word he'd lay out the scriptures he would tell him who he was but he wouldn't resort to name-calling brother branham wouldn't resort to name-calling he had one name that was ricky and rickett and he was told not to say that no more amen we're not to name corn we're not to attack people we have nothing against people brother branham said it's the system not the people it's the devil on the people when jesus turned around he looked at peter it wasn't peter it was satan he said satan get thee behind me it was the devil that we're fighting it's the enemy it's the antichrist that we're against it's the system that we're against but never the people the moment we go to fighting people we are under a red horse anointing look at every false doctrine that swept through the message starts off in an innocency we just have a thought we're just talking about this we have an idea maybe it could be maybe this is this i'm just saying maybe what if it is and then they begin to accept it and it's something that brother rem didn't say it's a deception it's off the word in some way it's counter to the scripture in some way and now we'll take it and now we believe it and now you put a crown on his head then he changes horses and and every time he goes to take peace from brethren there's one thing god said there's an abomination and that abomination is he that soweth discord among brethren is an abomination and then it's always been an abomination and always will be an abomination you can't change things that are an abomination just like it's an abomination for men to wear a parallel pertaining to a woman or a woman to wear apparel or pertaining to a man or for man to lie with a woman as man or a man as a woman those are all abominations those are abominations that never change so is he that will so strife amongst brethren is the same kind of abomination why because the red horse comes with a sword to take peace that they kill one another and you can't you can't say well it was that doctrine and them and that and that oh my goodness if you think you've been standing in truth you're just as guilty we are all just as guilty what causes most of the problems with false doctrine i'll tell you right now instead of sitting down and saying brother let's talk about this show me what you're seeing i don't understand let's talk about this well i don't agree there but i still love you brother and i can't see it let's pray for one another let's get back together and talk but immediately when something would come that sounds different immediately we'd fight against it that don't sound right and immediately we put it down and start into character defamation well you're surprised you don't believe the message you're off the word blah blah blah blah blah now you can attack the doctrine you can attack the spirit but you can't speak against the person most of the problems we've had are self-inflicted if we were to take the ox anointing when the red came most of these false doctrines would have never set up into a separate camp the thing would have washed its way out but what caused it was the division and now we've got to fight against this and fight against this instead of just stopping and waiting for the spirit to reveal it we begin fighting in strife and it's an abomination against god and it's nothing but the anointing of the antichrist spirit in the message because that's where he's trying to bring deception is wherever god's throne is wherever god is working wherever god is that's where he wants to be happens in your home let's say let's say let's say a man we'll just say it this way let's say a man goes and buys a bass boat right there's nothing wrong with a bass boot right he falls in love with his bass boat it's not a sin to buy a bastard okay but his family's not in agreement his wife's not so sure but it's just such a good idea i'm just gonna get this boat and he starts laying out on weekends fishing starts missing church starts being separate from his family not spending time with his wife and all of that and now now what started off an innocency is very quickly going to bring strife into the home instead of somebody taking the ox anointing they're both going to take the red and red horse anointing and it's going to bring a sword and it's going to bring division and strife in the home because whenever we bring compromise in right now we have to defend our compromise what what if oh what if a man decides you know what all my life as a kid i grew up in and we watch football it's just something we do we just watch football and i'm not going to get a tv i'm not i'm just going to get this little whatever i can watch it on and then he gets more involved and more involved and now all day on saturdays watching all the games and then when it's bowl season oh my goodness you got to watch i mean i followed the team all the way through and then his kids come around and he's watching the game and every time the commercial comes on he's got to flip the device down or tell his kids to leave the room all right and what's he doing he's moving through the white horse for a personal desire for compromise and he slips in through the white horse rider and now when his wife comes and tells him are you sure that's all right what do you mean it's all it's all right there's nothing wrong i'm not doing anything wrong he put a crown on his head and he's moving i'm just trying to relax i work so hard i provide i'm just trying to take some time for me he's moving from the white horse to the red horse why when we let compromise in now we have to defend our compromise because if it's not compromised you don't have to defend it it stands on its own there's no guilty conscience there's no reason to get upset this is what the word says i'm just doing what the bible says but when we allow the white horse to come in through compromise very soon you watch it'll turn into strife and now you have to take the red horse anointing to fight for your compromise see how subtle the devil is friends it's not out there it's not the denominations it's not the pentecostal system it's two vines right here it's where the throne of god is he's trying to come in and he's trying to take and he's trying to rule over the sons of god he's trying to exalt himself above the sons of god he's trying to get me to serve him hal white horse red horse black horse all wound up into the pale horse where do you stop him white horse the word and the word only but it has no arrows it can't hurt me seemingly then when you find out there's strife in your home and there's division and you're defending compromise and you're against brothers because a brother said something to me about my compromise how dare he judge me they're all judging at that church everybody they're up on their high horse no you're on the red horse friend fighting for your compromise hating it when the word is exposing your compromise when the pastor starts to get down to compromise there'll be all kinds of talking what is it sowing seed amongst brethren it's the red horse anointing defending our compromise defending church life i just want to come to church i just want to have a good if i could just have a good church where my family could come and i could just have a place that's safe that i wouldn't get ripped to pieces every week if i could just come and have a nice church where i could come to church and worship god and go home i would be happy and so would the devil that's the words of the antichrist not christ because mary said be it unto me jesus in gethsemane said let it be according to your word we have to die completely die to every thought that's contrary to the word completely die to everything that's different than the message of the hour die die die die paul says i die daily white horse reasoning against the message disagreeing with this kind of preaching because i just want to have a church to go to i just want to have a nice place to take my family why do we have to hear about this all the time because we're exposing the devil starts white moves red after red he goes to black horse and we don't have time for the black horse today brother venom tells a story we'll close with this because it's a perfect display of the ox anointing remember the story tells us the little lady who become a christian and had an alcoholic husband oh my goodness if that don't take the height off of you nothing will a little woman had an alcoholic husband and he would lay out and he would drink and he would fuss and stomp and this woman had a hard time brother brenham said and one day her husband goes down to the bar and he's with his friends and they're talking about what hypocrites christians are and they smoke and they drink do all this and they're not there's no real christian and the man says there is one my wife's a real christian why could he say that because she wasn't living in compromise she wasn't at war with him over his drinking she didn't take the sword to him and fight and cause strife and division because he drank because he was an alcoholic in laodicea we would say she's got a right to be upset yes she has a right to be upset she doesn't have a right to war hey she has a right to be heard she has a right to be upset she has a right to ask him to be different she has a right to do that but she has no right to war and so now this man he tells his friends there's a real one my wife said no you know they don't believe it they've never seen one so let's go home and act real drunk and we'll just cause a ruckus and you see so they go home and they stagger in like they're drunk and they say we want ham and eggs she says okay honey she fixes ham and eggs she seats all his friends what's she doing she's serving him what is she doing she is bearing the burden of christ she taking the ox anointing that bears down under the burden and lays down their life he says we want these and he fixes it and they're in there causing a ruckus she brings it in and he says you know i don't like my exists when he throws she he throws them in the floor she says that's okay honey i'll fix them the way you like them i would have liked to been there see so many times we say i'd give him a piece of my mind that's what moses did kept him out of the promised land we don't want a piece of your mind you need all you can get keep it to yourself right i would tell him you would be moses it's not going to work friends when the enemy this is the enemy brother bennett said sometimes he'll challenge you just to see how you'll react what anointing will you take what spirit will dominate your life when the enemy comes in and raises up a red horse how will you react will you react with the red horse or will you take the ox this woman she's she's mad and she's she's not mad he's mad he's throwing her stuff they go out there and she says honey honey i'll fix you more i'll do it the way you like it and they go on out and they're out there and they hear her in there singing she said snubbing a little bit she was crying she wasn't happy this wasn't easy she wasn't having a good time me and jesus were okay she was crying she's saying jesus had to bear across from me shall he bear a cross alone i don't remember all the words but there's a cross for me to bear and now she realizes she's under the ox anointing she's bearing down as a sacrifice brother ben said those men heard her in their singing and they knew she was real and one said yeah she's a real christian they came in brother rem said she let her husband and all those friends to the lord that night because the only thing that can break the power of the red horse is the ox anointing you'll never break the power of the red horse anointing with the red horse anointing all it is would be an intellectual bait and everybody's throwing down and coming with comebacks put downs and comebacks put downs and come back and i'm smarter and wittier and i finally talk so much you can't talk no more and i won red horse versus redhorse i remember more quotes i remember more scriptures let's go red horse but the only way to break the power of the red horse is with the ox anointing listen friends there's there's a war within you and the devil's trying to get you to take these annoying things and they'll do it in your home and they'll do it with your children and the worst mistake i've ever made is fighting the red horse with the red horse when i started looking at this you talk about one man who's been flattened i've been flattened because i'm guilty of this my whole life my whole life taking the red horse and fighting the red horse but when the red horse comes into your home amen the only way to break the power of the red horse is with the ox anointing now realize friends the ox anointing is not a compromising spirit the ox anointing doesn't give in for the ox anointing means he will not have peace he's giving his life and the church ages when they were when they were being slaughtered if they would compromise and recant they could live but the ox anointing is not one that compromises it's not one that recants it's not one that deviates on one word of god the ox anointing is a strong anointing that bears down under the word under persecution under strife and just keeps plotting alone they never deviated from the word they never changed from the word nobody is saying peace at all cost absolutely jesus said i did not come to bring peace but a sword that they'll kill you thinking that they do god of service they'll kill your character they'll fame your name they'll kill you thinking that they do got a service he didn't come to bring peace but a sword he didn't come so you compromise to have peace in your home he didn't come to compromise that peace at work he came so there'd be no compromise and i would bear down but i won't fight back see this little this little woman she bore down under the burden of her confession of her faith she didn't compromise for her husband she didn't drink a little with him to get up close to him so she could win him to the lord by being like him she stayed coldly separated she didn't drop the bars of her holiness her modesty she didn't drop the bars of her submission to her husband she didn't drop the bars of the word one iota for him but she did not fight him she submitted we don't change the word for peace we stay with the word and it means we'll have no peace and if we stay with the word to make sure we have no peace it means at some point you will have to take the ox anointing and the ox anointing will not compromise for peace it'll give its life for the word and never fight back we've made a mistake i've made mistakes but there's a path called repentance and say lord i'm sorry that was sharp words and cutting divisive language i have been under the power of the red horse anointing i'm sorry lord that i did not understand what i was doing but now i understand what i'm doing and i'm going to take your ox anointing and i'm going to bear under the burnings and i'm going to become a sacrificial beast of burden i'm going to lay down my life brother branham said he was talking to brother levail he had baptized with the level and they went over to get something to eat and brother leville says how do you let people rail on you all the time like that how do you let them say things about you like that and brother branham said you know he said he's one of the finest man i know but he's a little quick on the trigger sometimes brother graham said oh he said he said remember the story of david when david was a rejected king absalom was trying to take over his kingdom he was the rightful king and the rightful spot he should have been there but he realized that his sin had caused this problem and now he's leaving he's leaving humble he's leaving humiliated and there's a man there spitting on him cursing him and one of his one of his servants says i'll take the head off he takes his sword i'll cut his head off and david said don't do it maybe the lord told him to do that don't do it brother ram tells that story then he goes home they start talking about the tax collector reopen the case he's at home and he's talking and there's a question about whether they should go back to arizona or stay in jeffersonville and brotherhood said i don't know whichever i'm fine with it i'll serve the lord either place and then somebody railed out against this tax i said that all that tax collector something or like that he said no more than thinking what i just told brother lee i said don't say a thing maybe the lord told him to do that what did he do he took the ox anointing he wouldn't fight back even in the privacy of his own home sometimes with strong willpower we'll not fight anybody to their face but we'll go home and our family will hear about it all day and all night that person and that and how they they and i can't believe this and blah blah blah it's red horse just the same whether you're facing the person or not you've got a spirit of war a spirit of fighting a spirit of strife you're taking a sword and you're defaming their character amongst your children that's what got those children killed in elijah's day sometimes we'll do it in our minds we'll compromise on something and something will be preached or somebody will say something but they don't understand i don't know and we go off on our minds like a machine gun it's the red horse friends trying to get you to believe it trying to get you to act on it trying to get you upset in your spirit when you have to lay down your life and say if that's the word and the lord reveals it to me i'll do it if that is the word and that's what god wants i'll do it totally different spirit sometimes we'll do it in our minds sometimes we'll do it in the privacy of our homes or in our cars but either place we do it is still the red horse anointing friends we have to take the ox anointing and the only thing that will defeat the red horse anointing is the ox anointing what a lesson we've learned let's all stand musicians if you'd come please brother branham said in the testimony of a true witness he said one of the very first signs of christianity is he refused to kill a man he said that's right and you can kill him more ways than just sticking him with a knife speak against his character many ways you can do it he said one of the first signs of christianity is refuse to kill a man and he said you can kill him not just with a knife or a gun but with words and you speak against his character and damage his influence he said then you're guilty brother branham even went so far and says he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her is guilty already in his heart and brother ben said what about the woman right and brother ben connected it to this he said paul said you fight and you still strive and you bite at one another these things ought not to be brother ram said you're guilty of what killing killing the character killing the influence with what the red horse anointing it doesn't matter what somebody comes against you with you lay down your life and you sacrifice and stay right with the word don't compromise for peace there's no compromise for peace we stay with the word but we give our lives we let them kill us spit on us call us names marcus call us holy roller beat you on the head who prophesied and he never spoke a word back judas come in deception jesus knew what he was coming for he knew he was already sold out he knew judas was a devil from the start he comes to me says friend why have you come can we take that same anointing it's part of christ say god i need an extra dose of your ox anointing i want the spirit of christ on me that i don't fight people i'll fight systems i'll fight devils i'll fight the antichrist i'll fight false doctrine all day long but i will not fight people i won't fight my wife i won't fight my brothers and sisters i won't fight the neighbor i won't fight the stranger but i'll fight the devil and the only way i can fight him when he comes against me with the sword is by laying down my life in surrender it's a high calling paul said i'm i press towards the high calling paul wasn't pressing for a mediocre christian walk paul was not pressing for a church life paul was not pressing just to come to church and go home and everything's okay paul was pressing for the high calling of christ jesus the mark of the high calling paul said i keep under my body lest by any means i should be a castaway that keep under my mighty means to beat black and blue what's he beating black and blue the false vine the outer man so the inner man can flourish this is the scriptures friends you know why you know this is true because it requires everything there's no cheap gospel there's no cheap salvation there's no cheap message walk there's not going to be no cheap rapture man your body you're changing the body's not cheap it's going to take a full surrendered life your home coming into harmony and peace is not going to be cheap amen you to have the full manifestation of jesus christ and your life is not going to be cheap it's going to come at a price and that price is you dying on your altar with your sacrifice and then letting the spirit of christ live in you through the lion through the ox through the man through the eagle praise the lord let's bow our hands friends dear heavenly father we thank you for this word lord it's so rich unto us all these are things we cannot do ourselves lord we recognize by your word that we're deficient in so many ways but lord you've never asked us to have enough you've never asked us to work our way up climbing a ladder of some sort of works program you've asked us to surrender you never said when you get to this station in life i'll do something for you when you finally climb up here but you said when we die if we can go down and the likeness of your death will come forth in the likeness of your resurrection and lord we just want to die a little more right now lord god i realize lord where i have taken the wrong anointing time and time again in my life lord i don't want it anymore i pray that you would give me the ox anointing when the enemy should come in like a flood with a sword to take peace lord and to destroy i pray that you would give me the ox anointing to bear under the burden not fight back to surrender my life to give up my rights to not have a comeback to not speak with my lips but to surrender and stay with your word oh how we love you lord we love you for exposing the devil in our lives i love you for exposing the devil in me lord so that i can pray and he can be cast out so that i can resist him and he can flee you're showing us his hiding places you're showing us where he's working in our lives so that we can resist him there and he will have to flee we will be free from all the influence of the antichrist because of your word i pray god that you would help us to take it sincerely lord with the truth that it's preached in and lord that you would deliver us from these powers that come against us and give us the power of your four beasts lord to combat the devil we just make a full surrender of our lives we ask that you would take us lord wash us by the water of your word you're calling us higher for a reason lord and lord the way up is down we realize that help us abase ourselves in humble repentance so that you can exalt us in due season we love you lord we give you our lives and ask for your blessing to be upon us in jesus christ's name we pray amen one exciting day for the whole sapple family you know when god has been dealing with benny he's been stirring his heart and drawing him and he knows it's the father drawing him and he wants to be obedient we've got to sit down and have a conversation two weeks ago and i just was impressed that he felt a pull when he had a desire to be obedient he knows what the word says and he's going to obey it and we're going to believe with him that god's going to keep his portion of the word then he's coming in full obedience with a full heart to receive all that god has for him and we know that god will keep his word amen benny because you love the lord jesus christ and you want to be identified with him if you accepted him as your sacrifice and atonement i now baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ dear heavenly father as we lay hands on my young brother lord i pray god that you would fill him lord with your holy spirit and power lord let him walk every day of his life anointed by your holy spirit let him never stray away lord but that you would shepherd him and guide him all through life let him be a light a beacon of hope and a dark world that he might lead others to you lord and show them the path that he walked lord i pray that you would anoint him in blessing and bless his family
