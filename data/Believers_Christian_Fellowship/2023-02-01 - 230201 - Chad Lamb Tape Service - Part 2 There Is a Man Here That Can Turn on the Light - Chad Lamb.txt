missing Monday evening he drove his car they did find the car yesterday up here in Mercer County up near St Mary's leg they have no idea why he drove there for what reason they've had no communication they found the car in a ditch and the doors were locked but they don't know so you can only imagine what it would be like if it was your family what our sister Don is going through I talked to her last night again today and she's trusting the Lord to take care of her dad and I just want to agree with her and pray that God will help him to be found and help the family and comfort them in this terrible trial so let's bow our heads together and let's pray together as an assembly oh dear heavenly father Lord Jesus when there's no place for us to turn God we're so thankful that we're not left without help in this world but God you are the Strong Tower that the righteous run into and are safe you're the one that we turn to for every need because you've already provided for us and God we know that you're mindful Lord of each one of us and you're mindful of the things that we go through annoyed the situation for the sister Dawn and her family lord it's such a difficult situation it's so worrying Lord they don't know where Donna's father is Lord but you know where he is and God our sister Donna she declared to me today she's believing and trusting in you and God I pray that you would bless her Lord and that you would let her father be found pray to bless those that are searching that you would give wisdom to those that are looking and God that you would do something Lord to

yourself Mighty in this situation Lord as we look into your word tonight and as we listen to the message that you gave us Lord I pray that you would just open our hearts to receive the truth for this hour that we walk in that our eyes will be opened Lord and that we will live the life that you've called us to live and that will have a tremendous faith knowing what hour we're in and who we are that as we walk through this life Lord there's trial is all about but God you know all about it you've prepared the way and you've showed us so in your word and I pray God you would just give Revelation upon Revelation to us Lord help us God to walk in this life as you would walk in this life and Jesus Christ's name we pray [Music] God bless you you can have your seats for a minute thank you musicians I appreciate it we're going into the second part of our tape service tonight part two of there is a man here that can turn on the light we started last Wednesday we have part two and we'll have one more I believe one more Wednesday which will be next Wednesday if we could take our books out if you have your book and paper form electronic form however and I want to just do a just a real quick review and then we'll go into our questions then we'll read the opening scripture so we don't lose sight of that and then we'll play the tape uh we started from the beginning last time and we made it to page 14 last Wednesday and I'm not going to go through all the questions but I just want to go through a couple of them to refresh us of where we are in the message the first question I asked was what is the subject that brother Branham is going to speak on so we can find that in paragraph 34. the answer that's paragraph 34 on page seven page seven paragraph 34. he says may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word and now odd little text that I heard someone speak said this but I want to take this for a text there is a man here that can turn on the line and now we're going to speak on the subject of light so the text is there's a man who can turn on the light but his subject is light and we heard that as we were going through and we'll hear much about that tonight that brother Benham is talking about life question number three was how does light come when you find the answer to that in paragraph 59 on page 11. we looked in other places but I just want to pull out one sentence here paragraph 59. now remember then light comes by the spoken word of God so the light comes by the spoken word of God and then the last question was life comes by what so now how does light come by the spoken word of God life comes by what let's go to paragraph 74 on page 13. paragraph 74 on page 13. so life is only by the word of God made manifest so the light comes by the spoken word and life comes by that word made manifest amen so you can see the pattern of brother Venom's thinking so life is only by the word of God made manifest life comes only by the word of God made manifest as long as it's just in the book like this it still can be questioned but when it's made manifest and you see the product of what it spoke of being manifested then that is light on the word that's what that's what uh that's what brings the word said so and then it comes to pass that is life and light light bringing Life Light brings life let's go over to page 80 on the next page page 14. paragraph 80. let's read that God's word comes only by the Bible God's Bible is the printed form of the Son of God because the Bible said that it is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's God revealing himself through Christ and Christ is the word and it takes the light of God to shine upon that word to vindicate it to prove that God still speaks life eternal life he speaks natural light brings life life only comes by the Light the word may manifest or made flesh amen and that's what brings life so it's important that we're where the where the word is made flesh amen I want to get into the questions if we can bring the PowerPoint up for the Franco we'll have some questions uh today for part two question number one is what guides you to the light what guides you to the light you'll notice sometimes the questions are worded a little bit funny but they're worded in the way brother Ben's going to speak it so we can catch the context catch it pull it out of the the text what guides you to the light question number two why did mankind need to learn how to split an atom I like this one this one is very very interesting why did mankind need to learn how to split an atom it's amazing what what God has showed us through this prophetic gift in this day it is absolutely amazing why did mankind need to learn how to split an atom scientists just thought they were smart they didn't realize God allowed it for a purpose number three why did they reject the Messiah and like I said before there's all kinds of answers to the question if it's a standalone question we can come up with all kinds of things but I'm looking for the answer that he's giving through this message where we're staying in in the context of this message here why did they reject the Messiah question number four what is light this is very similar to what we asked last time but there's a statement that he makes that I want to highlight what is light what is light and number five we cannot live by what kind of light that's an odd phrase question but you'll find out why we cannot live by what kind of light so there's a certain kind of light we can't live by so we cannot live by what kind of light and we'll find that the prophet answers this question for us we cannot live by what kind of light okay so we are going to begin on page 14. right at the beginning of paragraph 79 it's just a little just one paragraph before where we stopped last time so we'll begin on page 14. paragraph 79 and we'll go all the way to page 33 and we'll go to the bottom of paragraph uh 180. so we'll go to page 33 bottom of paragraph 180. so hopefully you got those questions wrote down let's just stand together quickly and we'll go through the opening scriptures because as we go through the sermons I don't want to lose context of the scriptures that brother random opens with it's something that I've always have a habit of referring back to and so Isaiah chapter 42 verse 1. will be the first reading Isaiah chapter 42 and verse 1. Isaiah 42 verse 1 behold my servant whom I uphold mine elect in whom my soul delighteth I've put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street a bruised Reed shall he not break in the smoking Flack shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth and the Isle shall wait for his law thus saith God the Lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the Earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein I the Lord have called thee in righteousness and I will uphold thee and I'm sorry and I will hold thine hand and I will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house let's turn to Matthew chapter 4. Matthew chapter 4 and we'll begin reading from verse 12. Matthew chapter 4 and verse 12. now when Jesus has heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the Seacoast and the borders of Zebulon and Nephilim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the prophet saying the land of zebulun and the land of Nephilim by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and then you can have your seats we'll turn to page 14 and we'll begin at the top of paragraph 79 brother Franco if you could turn that on for us sometimes that little green lays the Earth dormant all through the winter I like to see the winter wheat sew it in the ground but when that sun gets just right oh it's got to live amen see and he can't live without the sun right and God's made promises for every age and every day and when the light gets right and shines upon that it'll produce just exactly what the word said because he is the light and the light God's word comes only by the Bible God's Bible is the the printed form of the Son of God because the Bible said that it is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's God revealing himself through Christ and Christ is the word and it takes the light of God to shine upon that word to Vindicated to prove that God still speaks life eternal life uh natural eye brings to life life only comes by the Light the word made manifests or made flesh when all the promises become uh in the Bible become manifest is when Jesus Christ the word was made flesh Among Us God always works through man man is God's subject now if it gets a little warm in here for you pull the windows down or whatever you wish dude cut the furnace down maybe the janitor cut the furnace down a little see many are warm and it's warm standing here too so remember that um I'm glad it's warm instead of cold cold I like warm huh warm always brings light life takes fire notice now made flesh when the word becomes flesh it becomes manifested like take the word and put it in the right position the right kind of ground it'll bring forth the the seed will bring forth this kind and the word brought into the right kind of a heart it'll manifest itself it'll bring forth the light it'll break forth upon it all right nothing natural nothing a natural our spiritual can live without God's light amen life can only come then by light nothing natural or nothing spiritual can live without God's light think of that all right but when he sends us the light and does all these things and then re-rejected now that's the pitiful part it's when life is rejected when it's sent to us how could you imagine some man today saying I just refuse to say there's such a thing as a son I don't believe there is a sign and he runs down into the basement and and shuts all the doors and sets back in the darkness and said there is no such a thing as Sun there is no such a thing as light you know right away there was something mentally wrong with that person see there's something wrong when he runs back into a dark basement and refuses to accept the benefit of god-given life there's something wrong with him you don't want us warm raise he doesn't want his health giving a substance he doesn't want to slide to walk in he had rather set in darkness it shows mentally something wrong natural with the man and I say this with all love and respect so is there something spiritually wrong with a man that'll run back into his denominations of creed and refuse to see Bible I want to shining right before Hallelujah goes back into his Creeds and farms and shuts the door and says there is no such a thing as that the days of Miracles has passed there's no such a thing as Divine Healing there are none of these things that was for an apostle the man is spiritually crazy there's something wrong with him he he's pulled down the curtains and rejected the holy spirit that can come upon him if he can if ye abide me and my words in you then the light's shining upon this word ask what you will there's something wrong that he would reject the god-given sources that God has given to us to live by his word the just shall live by faith and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word not part of the word every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and when a man will just refuse that there's something wrong with that person that's right something wrong with his experience that it claims to love God and then refuses God there's something going wrong with the person amen we know that without a shadow doubt he rejects it runs into this place and says honest I don't want to know nothing about it don't tell me nothing about these things I I don't believe nothing about it you don't matter what you say Paul said not long ago I was telling you about he said I don't care if you would bring 50 Cancers and bring 50 doctors to testify him I don't believe I don't care if you'd raise up the dead right before me I wouldn't believe it see there's something wrong with that person amen amen there there's and yet the man was a minister then they supposed to be a minister but just because that organization doesn't believe in in the uh powers of God don't believe that the word admit just what it said the man runs into this basement old musty dirty filthy basement of an organization and refuses the warmth and life-giving Rays of the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ which is the same yesterday man there's something wrong with that person see you'd rather live in that must darkness and so forth and to live in the life of the god and of the Bible said that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever The Works that I do shall you do also even greater than this shall you do for I go to my father there's something wrong with that person without a question at all there's something wrong and do you man let's listen to this across the world wherever you may be there's something wrong with your experience when you say that you love God and refuse his word there's something you refuse a very no wonder that thanks to the church is in his condition and things cannot be done as God promised is because you won't even receive the word or walk in the life amen the Bible said let us walk in the light as he is in the light amen then the blood of Jesus Christ God's son cleanses us from all sin sin is unbelief that if we are walking in the god-given light or the hour then God takes that word that's given for the hour and vindicates it just like he did in Genesis 1 3 he said let there be light and light come forth his word went forth and white followed it and currently the mist and the Darkness went to one corner and the light shine on the other side that's the way God does today he sends his word for this hour amen and the Holy Spirit comes and makes that word live and the Darkness goes on to their Creeds and denominations but light shines because it's a word of God indicated that his word is true Hallelujah now there's nothing fictitious about that that's just exactly scripture yes all right now we find that the the wise man the wise man of the oil followed the god-given substance they Fallen the word of God to the light because it was the word that brought life now you say how do they follow well they were kind of in Mages we understand and then we find out that Balaam the prophet back in numbers 24 17. uh Balaam was kindly of a major himself he was a prophet truly and he prophesied here and said a star would rise out of Jacob and when these wise man saw that the word of God set a star would rise out of Jacob they followed that little god-given token to the source of eternal life so a wise man today who is not blinded by Creeds amen will follow the god-given spoken word till I see the fullness of the power of God moving forward hey they see it and they know that it's here in the scripture God promised it for this day no matter how many observatories how many other things told the wise man where you're out of your mind two years there was some travel they passed by many nations and they say where are you going all we have seen is star in the east and we come to worship Him amen and when they lined up in Jerusalem the denominational headquarters they didn't have the answer they went up and down the streets crime where is he born King of the Jews they know nothing about it so they call on the word to find out they had fallen known that star was leading them to the eternal life guide us to that perfect life and the word is what guides you to the light and the lights what makes the word Vindicated amen notice they were wise man and wise man today not why the wisdom in this world is foolishness to God all your sinus and you people who are depending on some great scholarship or something you know they're telling you how to spit an atom it can't give you life there's nothing can give you life but the spoken word of God is the only order that life can come is through his spoken word that's all right to know how to spit Adam I wish they never found it out but if they they have to do it because this world is hanging today it had to happen to burst these big holes in the earth to let that lava come forth and rejuvenate this world again to make a new Earth where the righteous will walk out of on the dust of them first sin will be forgotten everything has a way of renewing itself and man who is given to live on this Earth by his own wisdom taking a tree of knowledge instead of the tree of life he'll destroy the Earth that God give him to live on those who are still on the Tree of Life shall come to a New Haven Center where there is no sickness or death wrong light Lord send us light it was the angels of God that showed light upon the hill to guide the Shepherds to the eternal life see it only comes by light light can only come by light the Shepherds wanting to know no other king is born they have seen great carrying on when the king is born now he was so secretly born and born in a stable uh in a Manger where the cattle and horses was eating but yet he was a king and the the Angels came down and sang the hymns to the Shepherds in the light the Angels themselves were lights that showed with the word of God they had the word of God and told them the day in the city of David in Bethlehem is born Christ the Savior amen the Angels had the word and the word came by light to God and they followed the word of the angels to the eternal life they found the baby they're wrapped in swallow's claws as they had said foresee life only comes by light notice he wants the word made like or became like the word and that generation he was the word light of that generation because the prophets of Allah spoke of him and here he come and Vindicated he was the light of God's spoken word see all the prophets had uh and say it had been fulfilled in him see the prophets back here with the word like God was at the beginning where he said let there be light and like King now the prophet said a virgin shall conceive bring forth the son they shall call his name Emmanuel for it'll be God With Us now they had spoken the word went out but he lost the light what was he the Fulfillment [Applause] he was the Fulfillment of that word he was a manifestation of that word oh so is it today God's word has been fulfilled at the hour that's the light is God manifesting himself he was a light of the world and when the prophets inspired by the holy spirit said unto us a child is born unto us uh a son is given or a child is given and his name Shall be Called cancer Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father there it was what was he the light that fulfilled that word amen the light that fulfilled that word and Matthew and Saint Matthew the 28th chapter we find and uh when Jesus raised from the dead he also was the light of the spoken word of David we said I'll not leave his holy hell amen neither I suffer my Holy One to see crushing death is in darkness Pentecost that was the light that showed when the Holy Ghost to come Isaiah said in the 28th chapter of Isaiah Isaiah said that with free sip must be upon precept lie must be up online you're a little in there a little hold fast to that what's good father was stammering lips and with other tongues will I speak to this people and this is the rest amen this is the Sabbath I'll give you and all this they were not here walked away and wagged their heads and when on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell upon those people and they acted like drunk men and women staggered under the impact of the Holy Spirit and they'll walk away and wag their heads and said this people's drunk full of new wine and so forth it absolutely was a light the word that had been prophesied made manifest soys in every age the word made manifest come to life is the light of that age [Music] there the word made manifest it's like was it Genesis 1 well God said let there be light and there was light yeah when God said there will be a son and there was a son amen well God said it in Joel 2 28 it shall come to pass the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy of all my hands maids and made sure life pour out of my spirit your young man shall see Visions your old man shall see dreams and all these things that he promised when if the Holy Ghost fell was the light upon that word when the word was made manifest then it become light amen he is the light he's the light that we should follow he is the only night the Angels found light and followed it to him now in all ages God has set forth so much of his word for each age God always sends somebody that that word to get into and show the light of it at the other age it does the same thing always does that he was a full film as I said of all the Divine holy powers of the prophets they were minor Gods when the word of the Lord came to a man Jesus said himself and he was a God yeah you know that he said if your law said in your fathers back there call them who the word of God came to call them gods how can you condemn me say when I said I'm the Son of God okay when the very God himself who spoke the word through the prophets he was a manifestation of that spoken word foreign if the prophet was called to God because he was the manifestation of another prophet's word how can you condemn him when he was the same thing he was the son of God Amen as he shall be called the son of God he was a long promised Messiah that the world had waited on he was a messiah's promise made manifest look at him when he stood there he said if I do not the works of my father then condemn me see but if you can't believe me believe the work sir they tell you who I am you see that blind darkened hour that they live in they couldn't see it they just couldn't understand how could he be that how can he be any Son of God when he's born right down here in Bethlehem if you only know the word said it would come that way amen by his father Joseph is a Carter his mother why is actually believed amongst our Brethren that he was born illegitimately see but yet the word of God said that he said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are the very ones of testify who I am they are the ones that testify me this holy scriptures then what was he God's light no wonder he said I'm the light of the world Amen not only did he say I'm alive and said ye are the light amen if his word is in you bearing record of itself then you are a light of the word notice we find out light of each age May manifest just the same then I want to ask the question as before time gets away why why then were they uh did they turn it down how could they do it when the their very Bible if they was reading was being made manifest before him yeah now study real hard now I remember I'm talking to many people at this time to see not just four or five hundred here but I'm I'm talking to many thousands stop just a minute stop your tape recorder and ask the question why would religious man good man why would Joseph question see why would you because he never searched the scripture why did the priest question one reason they didn't they knew it Nicodemus well expressed it that's right he said Rabbi we know you're a teacher from God no man could do what you do except God be with him we're aware of that but what was it their Traditions kept them from doing it then why were they did they reject the Messiah is be quiet if they reject that light here's a word that they knowed what was coming to pass but when the word was made manifest to show that the word of God had been fulfilled compare that with today ready when they're written in the word that would take place then why did those men reject it teachers because they were living in a glare of another life that's it there's living in a glare that's the thing they're doing today they're living the reason they turn it down is because they're living in a glare of another night see amen now they was living in a glare of what Moses said they claimed they was living in a glad of what another age had passed by and that's the very reason today that this message that Jesus Christ still is the same is turned down because the people are living in glares of other ages the same reason they turn it down now we notice and Webster says that a glare is kind of a false light a glare is a false light is there anything your glass like like a mirage on the road you go down the road many of you driving cars and look down ahead of you when you see that sun on the ground it reflects a light and like a mirage so that there's water all over the road but when you get there there's nothing there it's only a false Mirage the glare of a True Light and that's what the devil's doing today amen it's showing people a mirage a council of churches a group of denominations which will turn out to be false because it's because there is a real life that real life was a shiny Mirage could be there [Music] and that's her living in a glare of another age another thing for us hitting passed on now a glare this Mirage is false it's a glare of the sun that's why they did the same thing a false glare of the True Light now it proved to be that he was the True Light he was alive why do they know that he was alive how could you know he was alive because the word that was promised was made manifest through him so he was the light of that spoken word amen oh that would always make me a Pentecostal Baptist shot always thinking hey see living in eclair but when the true word is living that side what God Said now what if God said in the beginning uh let there be light well and uh there was something else up here that's right yeah see just a mirage see it would have been though what God Said no it wouldn't have been what if God said let there be lot more fog came see it would have been like but the reason light come it was his word manifested and today when God has said such things will take place at this time and you see it doing what is it's a life on God's word it's work being made like manifest itself now they said who do you say we are why I said Utah we know that you're crazy why you're a Samaritan you haven't got your right mind what are you trying to who can tell we know he was born in sin we don't know where you come from we have no record of your identification in our groups wow you're crazy you got a devil see say well you're out of your mind but he was actually the genuine True Light Of God shining and the glory put up their eyes out we are Moses is our God he said if you would have believed Moses you'd have known me [Music] and if you believe Jesus and the Bible you know this hour they said well we're Christians we if you were you know the acts of Christ for this day you know it Jesus said all those prophets spoke of me and if you believe those Prophets You Know Me my Works identify because what they said I Do I Do It and who can condemn me now I still they didn't see it why their eyes were put out with a glare it's either glare of something else that they're taken what the true spoken word was not think of it think of it they claim that they believed that word but they're traditions had turned their faces from the true word to a glass before they couldn't see the real thing so is it today so has it been in every age see the the true word shines but they have been so traditionalized that they can't see that word they're looking at a Clarity they're blind a clair will blind you it'll blind you a little when Jesus said you are blind yeah yeah leading a blind they should have been able to see it to see who he was but they didn't because they was living in that glare now Glarus I said is a false light a mirage a false conception of a true life false conception it's something that that's supposed to look like it but it isn't that now the only way they could tell the difference they cause the very things that Jesus did prove who he was that he was the light they thought theirs in the light but now if you just stop them and consider who is in the life now today if such a racial mistake was made by the church man of that day such a rational thing was there brethren don't you think that it's time that we stopped and considered what is life let us not make such a rational mistake amen but you're doing it right we've already done and do it now same as it was an now stop just a minute and find out what the word says for today if they had stopped and thought here he is fulfilling to the letter exactly what the word said he would do and he challenged them as I'm challenging you I'm challenging you to look in the word search the scripture see if this isn't it out search the scripture so in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify me [Music] here they to testify of this work today it works itself testifies amen that is being done and the scripture says there'll be none so it's alive all the hours God's word said so your traditions and things is exactly what the Bible says like those who wag their heads and walk away all the tables become full of vomit the Bible said that's where they wouldn't believe it they wipe their heads in gentlemen do you realize and brother do you realize this that when you are rejecting the very thing that God's vindicating before you that you're doing the same thing they did going back to your traditional pilot as a dog goes to its vomit if it made him sick the first time it'll make him sick the second huh if the Catholic Church being organized made the first organization brought sickness to the church solo Lutheran methodists and all the rest of them Baptist Presbyterian and Pentecostal amen a dog goes back to its vomit and a sow goes back to her water yeah right yeah we're getting to that in a few minutes the Lord with me glare walking in a glare a mirage a false conception of True Life he'd proved that he was the light because he being in a way in a minority oh my Millions against him there was not one sixth of the people 190th of the people on the Earth never know what he was here not I guess one one hundredth of the Jews or hardly one maybe less than that of his own country Evernote he was there and them it didn't know he was there considered him a false but something because the denomination of told him that's what he was but yet he was the True Light that had been spoken since Genesis in the beginning and ask them to search the scriptures and find out if he wasn't living just in that time if he The Works that he did in fulfill exactly what was promised at that time amen amen what a serious thing it is brother yes we're living in a tremendous time yeah yeah he proved to be the right he was the very light that they claimed they were worshiping they claim to be worshiping that light and so is it today that's right they claim they're worshiping it Pentecostals claim yeah they claim they are it's so blind they can't see it they organizing by the glare in their face a tradition is what some people sat together and said we'll go make this and this and this and that now we're going to come to why that has to happen the Lord's women notice his Works was the Living Word itself what he did was the Living Word itself showing he was that light that have been promised since the beginning of the world he was that light his light on the promised word of the age made it live to exactly what the promise said it would do but they had so turned around until they couldn't sin see but he was the light of that age he was the light that they claimed to be worshiping they thought that they were worshiping the very God of creation but he was living in worshiping the glare and Jesus said you worship me in vain teaching for Doctrine their traditions of man and not the word he is the word that he was the word made manifest they ought to have noted hey I hope that can break through every horse but it is the word made manifest or say oh we have the word well the word everybody pack a Bible it wants to but when the word is Vindicated made manifest well say well we believe yes sir they believed all the well on so does Satan amen those fantasies who could condemn them not believing but they didn't believe the word for the hour they were worshiping a glare of something else that's the same thing you're doing today [Applause] they're keeping up Luther's predict conditions or Wesley's traditions and the rest of them the Pentecostal Traditions but one of them the Pharisees was keeping up their Traditions but behind their Traditions was a true word of God coming to shine forth and what it did it blinded their eyes they couldn't sit because he's watching something else so is it today may God let that soak in yeah I thought it really hits home to the people it should believe it it's later than you think my son Billy Paul he talks in his sleep but he doesn't have dreams very often he had one the other night that suck him up say dream this at a church and and they I had come in here and say well come in fire was flying out of the eyes and I said the time is yours it's over and uh everybody gets screaming I can't my children and me and my wife so I can't get Sarah to ask the blessing at the table and so forth and I said he said I've got to go get lost and the baby I said lost can't come now the baby's too young to know Billy the hour is sure we must go I said it's midnight now before daylight of Jesus will be here if it isn't then I'm a false witness of Christ and somebody spoke up said no man knows men are honor I said Mr iron says sometimes pre non-day life but we're at the time let's go and we got in the car and started we started up the mountain and when we did it was it looked like the light was coming in the skies but dark upon the Earth he said I pulled off Side Road and helped my hands over like this fire still flying from my eyes they said I said Lord I did this at your command I did this just because that you told me to do it this way I did these things according to what you've told me and I motioned to a big Granite Mountain and a a light without hands cut a stone out of the mountain went hundreds of tons and here it come I said turn your hands don't look it'll all be over just in a few minutes oh isn't that a great holy hush come everywhere does this Stone come towards your place it may be later than we think there see that's exactly scriptural you see it's a stone without hands cut our mountains so one of these days it's going to be that way when you're going to scream for something I said to him you've already had that time God has constantly warned you time after time yeah I said even as my own kid or whoever it is now power is here I can only say what he's told me to say and he'll be here and it was and then all of a sudden here he come the stone cut out of the mountain without him Daniel saw that you know back many years ago Billy know nothing about that but it was a it was a dream sent to him from the Lord now see they claimed to be worshiping that very God that they were making fun of and the same thing has reversed again today by the same reason living in a glare instead of the light great light says a shine all right look what Darkness we're in today look what's going on today look at murder rape Strife wise come to pass I believe it was Billy Graham said his last meeting in 10 years now every citizen of California you have to pack a gun to protect themselves you can't put enough law enforcement the people that's going insane shooting murdering grapes everything see it's just gone wild see upon the streets it's a it's a day we're living in a saw my day see but there is a light shine amen if it only look if it only see look into the word and see what's supposed to be in this hour they would know what's trying to be done now they claimed they're worshiping that light so did they claim this Worship in life but they were worship it in a glare of another light instead of the real he was the light Creeds and traditions in their blinded condition had turned them from the True Light of the promised word the word that God had Vindicated by Jesus the light of the world came and made that word live right exactly through his time exactly through the days he'll be cut off in the midst of the 70 weeks that's right which is a three and a half years of his prophecy the Messiah would come the Prince Edward prophesy in three and a half days of this that he'd be cut off from the living and make atonement and that's exactly he preached three and a half years in the very Psalm that David said my God my God why has Thou forsaken me the 22nd Psalm all my bones they stare at me they wag their heads they pass by me 850 years before him when David sung that song in the spirit and it was considered prophecy and given they're singing them songs in the temple when the same sacrifices hanging on the crossings yeah hands and Pierce today pierce my hands and my feet yes sir be there to why they were living in a glare they didn't see the light could you imagine a sensible person doing that no more not going to imagine a sensible person running down the basement and getting a must and pulling these doors together say I refuse to see there's light it's insanity and a spiritual slip somewhere when a man sees that the Bible is promised this to see it living right out before him and made manifest and then continually stay in those Creeds and things out there that rejected [Music] it's a spiritual delinquency yeah that's exactly right here he was now he was he was the light of the world in the world and he came to his own his own he came into the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not right but as many as did know him to them he gave power to become sons of God for them to believe remember we cannot live by yesterday's life yesterday's light is gone it isn't no more it yesterday's light is only in memory yesterday's sunlight is only a memory arts history we cannot live in yesterday's life no more in the same though it's the same Sun the same Sun but each day it brings forth its strength a little stronger to ripen the grain for the Harvest amen the Sun comes today gets a little stronger each day now it'll get a little stronger a little stronger and to finally the weakness laying there it'll go take in life and while the life will come up then a little stronger a little stronger March April May June July she's in the harvesting you see the same sun shining today and and January or December it's up there bathing that snow and melting it down on that green bringing that water it's the same Sun but that wheat could not live in that same sunlight that's right it can't do it see the sun comes a little stronger each day and the green should be a little more mature to receive the sunlight amen that's what's the matter today the grain that was sold in the early fathers back there in Luther and Wesleyan it dwarfed it can't take the sun the sun kills it it refused to grow and it kind of it took itself from the stalk light and come over here and made itself alone little thing to become a husk then no life in it the greens should be maturing and getting stronger as the sun becomes stronger each day now let's watch a minute we watch the church ages there's seven Church ages is those Church ages each one watch how he spoke to them what would do how the grain would mature and come down to this last hour here this last hour that we're living so the churches must do the same thing see the churches now look Luther Luther green and Luther was a green and he sold it all right so was Wesley and also so was Pentecostal so was the Baptist the Nazarene but you see now Luther would not go back and live in the light of the first denomination Catholic no sir he was another line that was God write me something now a little minority come out of that that Lutheran Revival they come along the Wesley Revival and then that well they couldn't go back and do the lutherans and our clown come the Pentecostals and then the Pentecostals organized and done the same thing taking the husk notice but the grain goes right out now we're in another age amen why won't they receive it why won't they see that the grain is matured here's the promised word for this date why don't they see it because they're living in Lutheran glare West Sinclair Baptist Claire Pentecostal glaze they're living in the glare of another light that's the reason they can't receive the light of the total word being a Vindicated as God promised them Seven Seals where the whole mystery was revealed we'll come back and tell why these Mysteries is done like that and yet when that comes in they walk farther away from it than ever amen they're without excuse God has done it through Spirit through Revelations he's he's proved it perfectly by scientific and everything else that it's the truth that it's the truth and still they want to live in a Pentecostal player I am the assemblies I am the one this I'm the Church of God I'm this see living in a glare of at age 40 50 years ago living in a Lutheran living in a Wesley a Baptist a presbyterian or some Nazarene glare of another church age that went on an organized and done the same thing and refused and reject the light when it's actually shining and you're living in a mirage amen but you're not to hurt you but to wake you up you're living in a mirage what if Jesus said well you're blind and you're leading the blind they couldn't he tried to tell him and then they said let him alone if a blind leads a blind they'll all fall in a ditch amen that's the hour of comfortable yes sir go to stagger I can't help it that's right that's all I can do I've done exactly I've done this at your command board since 19 and 33 down on the river when that light there you see shining down his spin right here the Tabernacle and witness to you all these years and everything it says come to pass amen and continue they go on oh my God let the blind lead the block amen amen I'll just wait for that hour he'll arrived one of these days notice living in a glare of Luther living in the glare of Wesley living in them glares back there that's the reason they can't see true life if they would stop for a few minutes and just pick up the vibe and read it they would see that the this is light promise for the hour amen yeah we're going to take some of these things in a minute he promised according to Malachi 4 these things were happening he promised all through the scriptures they would happen see notice Israel also our type in the journey look eating Manna which was her light life they give them strength life is that right Israel could not eat manna that was yesterday it fella amen it was contaminated it was rotten amen it was no good for them they'd die over it the matter that kept them alive yesterday would kill him today the Bible said it got germs in it contaminated and the man they had to get Humana every day and what is it the people that live on man up Luther Wesleyan them back in there you're eating contaminated stuff that's killing you spiritually it's killing you dead in your Traditions yes it is Luther's matter will not work for methodists Methodist Manna would not work for Pentecost Pentecostal Manna will not work for the day see what I mean every day it come day by day fresh and so has it to the church ages Luther's Manna was a message of justification Wesley's message was a manifestation of sanctification Pentecostal was a restoration of the gifts but this is introducing the hatstone contrary to all of it and yet it's the same light for the matured like the same sunshine today will be right in the grain for the Harvest in July see what I mean but the light today won't do any good back there in July is stronger the wheat's more advanced it's ready to take it amen amen certainly is it couldn't take it now it can then the season wasn't right that it is now you can't go against God's nature he's got a law in a contrary that law kills your plant you've got to go according to God's spoken laws and his laws is his word any law is a word spoken and a word is a thought manifested see now we we know that that's true but vision is what the word of God or something foretold or a forecast of an even and a vision that the prophets had in Jesus had Paul hadn't alone I'm telling this day was the forecast and what would happen amen and here we see the forecast being made manifest that people don't even recognize it see what I mean now yesterday's man look here did you ever notice the sun s-u-n has traveled East to the West as this one each time did you notice that and notice the church ages did the same thing what the sun s-o-s-u-n started in the East and civilization has traveled with the sun God's spoken light from the living they've come on following the sun see where it was going life itself when you're born it's like a son you're born right onto the setting of the Sun from your birth to the setting of The Sun man has traveled Westward always oldest civilization we have is China in the Eastern countries Jerusalem and notice she keeps traveling Westward as it goes and as it goes on and on to the West so has the church age travel the same way by the s-o-n of God Amen well Paul their early church start in the East it went from there jumped across the the the the sea over into Germany has made three pulls looking from Asia and Palestine it jumped across the ocean to Germany that was Luther and jumped from Luther across the English Channel over into England by Wesley and from Wesley she jumped to the West Coast to the United States and this if you go any further it's coming back East again amen this is the evening time all right look how the church ages this fall Luther Paul first back in the early age they come down the island irenis and so forth on down into France from there over into Germany over into England constantly going west [Applause] and what does the Bible say about this Slave stage see geographically chronologists anyway you want to take it scripturally first scripture of course first evidence historically any way you want to take it we're at the end the last Church age and watch as it went forward it grew stronger and stronger and so has the real little minority of the church wrote from justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and now to the coming Capstone shaping itself up no more organizations after this there won't be tomorrow Champions see we're on the west just to show you through all types and everything else and look at those three jumps three fools we'll get into that tonight see see how we're at the end time it's just uh s-u-n-s travel like s-o-e s-o-n like s-u-n -u-n the church has come the same thing from the seven Church ages and so forth civilizations moved right on to the west and the church has moved right on to the west and now if we go any further than what we are now we come back East again if you leave the West Coast you go right back into China Japan right back in again seven thousand miles across to go right back to the east again so East and West has met that's all in it we're at the end there's nothing left and the same thing has happened today it happened back there the same thing is met at the West that was met at the East the people living in a glare of another light that was absolutely trying to show forth the light was come and reject it because it got the glare instead of the light oh and there was great light in the land of the Gentiles zeberland nothing of Gallup and Galilee land of the Gentiles this is the seventh Church age remember and each time that sun began to shine in the East is the same shun the shines in the west amen and The Same Spirit that's been all down Through the Ages like that is the same sun today only what is it just like writing in the season the sun is now will be the same Sun it brightens their grand this fall this autumn see but what is it it's this sun plus what it will be amen and today in this last age is what they wear plus this and then they will live back there as a door yeah go down into a busty old inner in our own nominational basement the Creed and puller blinds us I just refuse to sit it's all nonsense and when the very Bible that they claim to believe is being identified by the same Holy Spirit bringing light in the last days did you notice and watch real close Sarah and Malachi hi a lot of that the faith of the fathers to this children the children to the fathers The Same Spirit weren't raised back God or what raises here again the same thing they just Vice diversity exactly sitting right back again East and West is math all right just exactly right under our face and yet they don't see it that's right why no wonder Jesus said just let him alone then they're blind lead the blind they'll all fall in the ditch the light of other ages only reflected this life see the sun today only reflects as a reflection of the Sun that will be this July or August of God for the Harvest and the son of Luther Martin Luther and Wesley and Sankey Finney knocks Calvin Moody all their mothers and great men back in there that had those like John Smith of the Baptist Church and Alexander Campbell the Camelot Church of the so-called Disciples of Christ Christian church and whatever more names he got for him all them men back there in their ages was only reflecting what it will be here at the end and then here are the children immediately after them Founders what do they do they didn't stay on the stalk they pulled away from it and made themselves a little husk thing out here which you get away from the real source of life you have no life ever you take a husk off the plane and play lager in the crown it'll lay down and so are you trying to eat rotten tomatoes from back in that days the Harvest is Right amen Jesus has a tablespoon oh right the food of the day by the gospel like the defense the Saints eat the bread just think the old husk of yesterday see don't plant it back there it's rotten it cannot it cannot stay with it no sir it will not do no good it won't grow it's all for the life and the word is alive amen that's right the husk drops off a little beard Falls away things like that it just denominates itself and drops off it refuses to go on with the life but the light vindicates it oh my yesterday it's oh my how we are to see that see that the rotten things of yesterday don't eat them today okay it's got worms in it you know these little wiggle Tails I call them I don't know why I don't know much about germ not but I know we always call them wiggle tails it gets in anything when it gets a little rotten see I don't want it then hey if you're satisfied with it go ahead but not me but remember you said then why was it good yesterday if you only knew that the very little Hull that was on the wheat at the beginning if it abides in the green it makes the grain further that's the very thing that makes a wheat flour yeah yeah is what was yesterday but if it separates itself from the green and don't mature then it goes away right but if it goes through the process of life-giving process as it dies out it just Blends into something else it makes a grain amen if it isn't where does it come from amen amen you get it amen you get it praise God amen I've been enjoying this message very much um I want to go through the questions now if we can pull you out back up so what guides you to the light let's go back to paragraph 91. now as brother Branham goes through this he adds so much more to it I'm just going to highlight a couple phrases he says here in a few parts he talks about but you could end up highlighting your whole book what guides you to the light paragraph 91 at the top of page 17. now we find that the wise men the wise men of old followed the god-given substance they followed the word of God to the light because it was the word that brought life now you say how did they follow well they were kind of Magis we understand and then we find out that Balaam the prophet back in numbers 24 17 beta was kind of a magi himself he was a prophet truly and he prophesied here and said a star would rise out of Jacob and when these wise men saw the word of God said a star would rise out of Jacob they followed that little god-given token to the source of eternal life so will wise men today who is not blinded by Creeds and will follow the god-given spoken word till they see the fullness of the power of God blooming forth in this hour they see it and they know that it's here in the scripture God promised it for this day so we're looking here he's showing through the through Balaam Balaam laid down a prophecy that a star will rise out of Jacob and they saw it in the heavens amen and when they saw in the heavens they knew that was the prophecy and they followed that word all the way to the manifestation of that word until they found the baby or for the young child when they found the young child let's go down to paragraph 94. oh we have seen a star in the east and we come to worship him and then they lined up in Jerusalem the denominational headquarters they didn't have the answer they went up and down the street crying where is he born King of the Jews they know nothing about it so they called on the word to find out they had followed knowed that star was leading them to the eternal life guide us through thy Perfect Light and the word is what guides you to the light so what guides you to the light the word so that's why we don't just take willy-nilly anything that happens it's got to be a manifestation of the word it's the word that likes us to the light amen and when the word is made manifest it's light and it's life that's the source of life for us amens we must come where the word of word of the word is made manifest where the word is made light and it becomes our life and the word is what guide you to the light and the light is what makes the word Vindicated notice they were wise men paragraph 95 and wise men today the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God all your scientists and you people who are depending on some great scholarship are something another telling you how to split an atom it can't give you life there's nothing can give you life but the spoken word of God it's only where that life can come is through his spoken word so I am so glad amen that God gave us his word amen and then he makes the word live in our age and that brings light and life amen question number two why did mankind need to learn how to split an atom I thought this was absolutely fascinating paragraph 96 at the bottom of this page and that's all right to know how to split an atom I wish they'd never found it out that they have to do it because this world is hanging today it had to happen to burst these big holes in the earth to let that lava come forth and rejuvenate this world again to make a new Earth where the righteous will walk out upon the dust of the wicked where sin will be forgotten everything has a way of renewing itself and man who was give given to live on this Earth by his own wisdom taking the tree of knowledge instead of the tree of life he'll destroy the Earth that God give him to live on but those who are still on the Tree of Life shall come to a new heavens and a new Earth where there is no sickness or death so why didn't man in this scientific age at the end time think about when man began to learn how to split an atom and make an A-bomb amen it was between World War one and World War II it was the same time that there was an end time Prophet on the scene and everything was being set the stage was being set the finishing of everything took place in that man's Lifetime and that's when man learned how to split a nap and made it made an atomic bomb and what did he need to learn that for so that he could blow holes in the Earth crust to let the lava out to rejuvenate the Earth for a millennium my goodness this word is too perfect amen everything is too perfect the timing is too perfect and man will destroy himself man creates his own Hell by nuclear fallout man burns off the Earth by his own wisdom and not taking the word but taking his own wisdom and God allowed him to go that way and God is going to allow man to go far enough to create his own hell on Earth which will bring the purification of the earth amen for a millennial Reign for the honeymoon and who's going to do it it's not God it's man doing it himself so God allowed him to learn to split an atom because God knows amen that he's got to blow the holes in the Earth cross to let the lava out praise be to God he's going to rejuvenate this world with atomic and Volcanic fire and now how will the volcanic Fire come it'll start by atomic bombs so when you hear the news Everybody's scared about atomic bombs they ought to be scared they're going to destroy themselves with them but for us we're not scared because it's a Rejuvenation of the Earth for the millennial reign praise God build more bombs that's what's going on that's why the tension is there that's why the nuclear armed race is there that's what it's all about is a rejuvenation for the millennium that's why we see the news differently than everybody else sees it because we've already been told amen question number three why did they reject the Messiah now uh let me go here to page uh well let's start back let's we'll lead into it let's go to page 113. page 130 I'm sorry paragraph 113 page 21. page 21 paragraph 113. stop just a minute stop your tape recorder and ask the question why would religious men good men why would Joseph question C because he never searched the scriptures why did the priest question one reason they didn't they knew it Nicodemus well expressed it he said Rabbi we know that you're a teacher from God no man could do what you do except God be with him we're aware of that but what was it their Traditions kept them from doing it then when why were they did they reject the Messiah why did they reject that light here's the word that they node was coming to pass but when the word was made manifest to show that the word of God had been fulfilled compare that with today when they're written in the word that would take place what would take place then why did those men reject it teachers because they were living in a glare of another line that is it they was living in a glare why did they reject the Messiah because they was living in the glare of another light of another age amen and brother Benham tells us in the middle of paragraph 114 compare that with today the reason brother Ben is spending so much time talking about Jesus and his ministry and the Pharisees and the rejection is because he wants you to see the parallel with today foreign it's the same thing it's the same thing they're doing today the reason they turned it down is because they were living in the glare of another light now they was living in a glare of what Moses said they claimed they was living in the glare of what another age had passed by and that's the very reason today that this message that Jesus Christ is still the same is turned down because the people are living in glares of other ages the same reason they'll turn it down now this we notice and Webster says that a glare is a kind of a false light a glare is a false light same thing that glares like a mirage on the road you go down the road and many of you driving cars and look down ahead of you when you see the sun on the ground it reflects a light like a mirage look like there's water all over the road but when you get there there's nothing there it's only a false Mirage the glare of a true light that's what the devil is doing today is showing people a mirage a council of churches a group of denominations which will turn out to be false because it's because there is a real light shining there has to be a real light to create a mirage and they're looking back on the reflection of a day gone by amen and missing where the light is shining today amen because they're caught in the in a mirage they're caught in the glare of a previous age but there was a real light shining in that day a genuine True light shining in that day amen but they're stuck in a mirage it's because there was a real light shining that real lights that real light wasn't shining a mirage couldn't be there real light shines and they're living in a glare of another age another thing for its hit and it's passed on now a glare this Mirage is false it's a glare of the Sun let's go over to paragraph 123. on page 22 at the bottom of page 22. and still they didn't see it their eyes were put out with a glare see the glare of something else that they had taken what the true spoken word was now think of it think of it they claim that they believed that word but their Traditions had turned their faces from the true word to a glare therefore they couldn't see the real thing they were blind to it so is it today so has it been in every age the true word shines but they have been so traditionalized that they can't see the word they're looking at a glare and they're blind a glare will blind you there's an arc off of it it'll blind you it it will when Jesus said you were blind leading the blind they should have been able to see it to see who what who he was but they didn't because they was living in that glare now a glare as I said is a false light a mirage a false conception of the True Light false conception it's something that's supposed to look like it but it isn't that so they're stuck in the glare of another age paragraph 133 on the next page he proved to be the right he was the very light that they claimed they worshiped they claim to be worshiping that light and so is it today they claim they are worshiping that that Pentecostal claimant they claim they are so blind that they can't see it they organize and put a glare on their face a tradition that some people set together and said well we'll go and make this and this and this and that now we're going to come to why that has to happen the Lord willing notice his Works was the Living Word itself what he did was the Living Word itself showing he was that light that had been promised since the beginning of the world he was that line his light on the promised word of the age made it live to exactly what the promise said it would do but they had it so turned around until they couldn't see it but he was the light of the age let's keep reading let's read a couple more he was the light that they claimed to be worshiping they thought that they were worshiping the very God of creation they was living and worshiping a glare and Jesus said you worship me in vain teaching for Doctrine the traditions of man and not the word he is the word and he was the word made manifest they ought to have noted I hope that can break through everywhere it's urgency that is the word made manifest oh we have the word why the word everybody pack a Bible that wants to but when the word is Vindicated made manifest why say well we believe yes sir they believe all the way along so does Satan those Pharisees who would condemn them not believing who would condemn them not believing but they didn't believe the word for the hour they were worshiping the glare of something else it's the same thing they're doing today we're keeping up Luther's Traditions or Wesley's traditions and the rest of them Pentecostal Traditions but what of the hour the Pharisees was keeping up their Traditions but behind their tradition was the true word of God coming to shine forth and when it did it blinded their eyes they couldn't see it because they was watching something else so is it today may God let that soak in until it really hits home to the people that would believe it it's later than you think I love at the top of this page when brother Benham said we have the word why the word everybody packs a Bible that wants to the word but when the word is Vindicated made manifest then he goes right to the Pharisees you can't tell the Pharisees that they didn't believe the word they were carrying around Scrolls they were believing the Bible they were believing what Moses wrote everybody today that claims to be a Christian can a Bible and say they believed the word but there's one critical part of the word that they're failing to believe and that's the word that is made in flesh today the word that is light today is the part that they're failing and when they're failing that they're living in the Mirage the glare of a previous age and that glare won't bring life only present day light will bring life that's what's so critical about uh this message coming this hour and what brother bam is trying to get to the people to see is yes you believe you believe in what's been done you believe in what's been said you believe in what's been wrote but you're rejecting Christ today so all of that believing in what's been done amen is not bringing life unless you come to life which is life for the day amen let's look at one more paragraph 156. let's go over to 156 on the bottom of page 28. still in the same question why did they reject the Messiah brother Benham is typing it with this day remember he talks about civilization and the gospel has traveled from east to west civilizations come from east to west it's traveled from China he says the oldest civilization all the way across now it's up against the West Coast United States it can't go any further or it'll be back east in Japan and China again he said so that's an indication that we've come to the end he said the gospels travel the same way he says it went from it went from Palestine across the Mediterranean Sea up into Germany and Europe it crossed the uh English Channel over into England and Wesley's day then it crossed the Atlantic Ocean to come to the United States he said that was three pulls of the Gospel he said now it's going all the way to the West Coast it can't go everything's finished it's done East is met West we're at the end and what they're doing now that this Messiah is here is the same thing they did when the Messiah came the first time showing who's here and who's being rejected amen paragraph 156 here at the bottom of 28. but the grain goes right on now we're in another age why won't they receive it why won't they see that the grain has matured here is the promised word for the day why don't they see it because they're living in Luther and glare Wesley and glare Baptist glare Pentecostal glare they're living the glare of another line that's the reason they can't receive the light of the total word being Vindicated as God promised them Seven Seals where the whole mystery was revealed would come back and tell why these Mysteries was done like that and yet yet when that comes in they walk further away from it than ever they're without excuse God has done it through Spirit through Revelations he's proved it perfectly by scientific and everything else that it's the truth that it it it's the truth and still they want to live in a Pentecostal glare I'm the assemblies I'm the one that's I'm the Church of God I'm this see living in the glare of age 40 50 years ago living in the Lutheran glare living in a Wesley a Baptist a presbyterian or some Nazarene glare of another church age that went on and organized and done the same thing and refuse and read reject the light when it's actually Shining my the same thing that happened two thousand years ago was happening again today I had the question question number four what is the light there's so many answers for this but there's something brother bam says specifically I want to look at and we'll go back to paragraph 125. at the top part of page 23. what is light it says now a glare as I said is a false light of Mirage a false conception of the True Light false conception is something that's supposed to look like it but it isn't that now the only way they could tell the difference because the very things that Jesus did proved who he was that he was the light they thought they was in the light but now if you just stop a minute and consider who is in the light then now today of such a rational mistake was made by the Churchman of that day such a rational thing was dead Brethren don't you think that it's time that we stopped and considered what is life let us not make such a rational mistake but you're doing it you've already done it see and knew it not same as they was then now now stop just a minute and find out what the word says for today so what is the light the light is the word shining today not that was light in a previous day but this is the light the light is what's shining today amen paragraph 159. paragraph 159 notice living in a glare of Luther living in a glare of Wesley living in them glares back there that's the reason they can't see True Light they would stop for a minute and just pick up the Bible and read it they would see that this is light promised for the hour that's the light we need and that'll lead us into the next question question number five we cannot live by what kind of light so we know we must live by light life comes by light but what kind of light will not produce life let's go back to paragraph 150. paragraph 150 at the bottom of page 27. remember we cannot live by yesterday's light so what light can you not what light doesn't bring life yesterday's light what brings life today's light listen did the sun shine yesterday yes did that Sunshine produce life yes but that Sunshine that shined yesterday will not produce life today there has to be a light shining today and you could have went outside and taken a picture of a beautiful bright sunny day and you could have brought the picture in and say this is light that's not light that's only a picture of the light that was shining in order to have light you must have present tense light you to have the real light must be the light today amen remember we cannot live by yesterday's light yesterday's light is gone it isn't no more it's yesterday's light is only a memory yesterday sunlight is only a memory or it's history we cannot live in yesterday's light no more and the same though it's the same Sun the same Sun but each day it brings forth its strength a little stronger to ripen the grain for the Harvest sea the Sun comes today and gets a little stronger each day now you'll get a little stronger a little stronger until finally the wheat that's laying there it'll go take life the life will come up then the little stronger a little stronger March April May June July she's in the Harvest and you see the same sun shining today in January December that's up there bathing the snow and melting it down on the grain bringing it water it's the same Sun but what the wheat could not live in that same sunlight in June so brother Branham is showing us through the church ages it's been the word all along it's been the light of the manifested word all along it was the light it was the light from the first age to the seven eight it's the same line just like it's the same sunlight in January it's the same sunlight in June but what the difference is it's intensifying in its strength as the seed is maturing and so now the the seed that needs to live in a hot June July August light to come to full rapturing maturity amen that plant will not survive in that stage in January it can't live it'll die so that's why if we come to the very end of time when East has met West again when the gospels went through three pulls it's come to the West it can't live in the light of a previous age it'll die it has to have the full power of the final light to bring it to full rapturing maturity that's why even today we can never live in the past we can't live in one we can't just live in the first and second pool brother benham's Ministry but the third pull amen brought Christ to us Amen in brine form and we can't even live on our experience from yesterday we have to have fresh sunlight today we have to walk in the light as Christ is unfolding himself in US it can't be just what happened 50 years ago it's got to be what's happening today we can never stop staying in the present tense truth and staying in the sun there's no time for us to stop and say wasn't that a beautiful light that shone it's got to be a beautiful light that's shining now to keep bringing us into full full maturity into the full light let's look at paragraph 161 on the bottom of page 29. Brother Bear I'm going to use another example to share the same thought the same concept paragraph 161 notice Israel also our type in the journey look eating Manna which was their light life that give them strength life is that right Israel could not eat manna that was yesterday had fallen fell on them it was contaminated it was rotten it was no good for them they would die over it the manna that kept them alive yesterday would kill them today the Bible said it's got germs in it contaminated in the Manna they had to get new Mana every day and what is it the people that live on the men of Luther Wesley and them back there you're eating contaminated stuff that's killing you spiritually killing you dead in your Traditions yesterday Luther's Manna would not work for Methodist Methodist man it would not work for Pentecost Pentecostal Mana will not work for today see what I mean every day it come day by day fresh and so has it through the church ages Luther's Manna was the message of justification Wesley's message was the manifestation of sanctification Pentecostal was the restoration of gifts but this is introducing The Headstone which is Christ the last day the bride so what is introducing The Headstone the last day the bride tree which is contrary to all of it and yet it's the same light for the matured paragraph 177. then then hear the children immediately after them Founders what do they do they didn't stay on the stalk they pulled away from it and made themselves a little husk thing out here which you get away from the real source of life you have no life you take a husk of the thing and plant it out there in the ground it'll lay down and rot and so and so are you trying to eat rotten manna from back in them days the Harvest is ripe Jesus has a table spread where the saints of God are fed on ripened food of the day by The Gospel Light and that vindicates and proves that he is here today amen the Saints eat the bread I don't know about you but I don't want any rotten manna from a previous day and I do not want to live in the glare of a previous age and I don't even want personally myself to live in the glare of a previous experience but I want a fresh experience as I walk in the light as he's in the light as he continues to reveal himself to me I want to stay in that light and not bank and settle down on something he did for me a year ago 10 years ago but I want to keep walking with him as he's in the light I want to see him as he is I want to be where the fresh Manna is I want to be I want to come into that fully matured State as he brings me into that hot August Sun Amen brother Ben he said those that stayed back in Luther's day they dwarfed they refused to grow on as the son they stayed back in Luther's light and they dwarfed they'd never come to full maturity and God help us to come to this message and dwarf to stay in part of it but not go all the way to stay in part of the ministry amen part of the word but not fully accept the revealing of the full word I say God help us not to come to this message endure for anywhere but help me to come all the way into the full expression of Jesus Christ and all that he has for me I want and all that he reveals to me I want to walk in and day by day I want to keep my experience fresh in the Light of Christ amen God help us as we stand musicians if you'll come another bin if you'll make your way up amen God is so good we've listened to oh about an hour and a half or more of this service so far and we haven't even got to the title there's a man here that can turn on the light that'll be in part three amen so God bless you all we love you all let's bow our heads and thank the lord lord Jesus we thank you God just as we are incapable of making the sun rise every day we ourselves were incapable of making your word come manifest but God you who were faithful to your commandment that the sun would shine you who hold the Earth in its orbit Lord you are the one who makes it Shine day by day you bring it in its season you bring it in its strength you are faithful to do it Lord God we're not able to produce or make anything happen but God we're here to receive it Lord as you do it God I pray that you allow that full Rapture son to bring us each one to full maturity help us not Lord to trust in what was done before but help us to walk in the light as you're in the light walking with you day by day as you reveal yourself to us you peel away Lord all of the confusion and all of the denominationalism from us Lord all of the wrong thinking and the human ideas Lord let your light just fade it all away and bring the seed that's within us to full maturity Lord as we walk with you day by day walking in the light that you've given us in this hour through this ministry and the End Time Lord you're the one who opened the seals you are the Seals you're the one you're the mighty Angel that's come with an open book in your hand help us to walk in that light that you've given us and Lord as you as you break away all traditionalism from us bring us to that full maturity Lord in each one of ourselves we love you God we thank you for what you've done you've been faithful to do it we couldn't produce it you've done it but now we want to lay in the presence of the Sun as you bake all the greenness out of us Lord we're trusting in you we're trusting in your method we want to walk in it Lord pray to bless your children as we go from here help us to walk day by day eating fresh manna that you've sent down to us in this day help us to enjoy the son Lord that's cleansing us purging us from all the greenness and immaturity in our lives God help us to lay there we love you father and we ask for your blessings in Jesus Christ's name amen Amen
