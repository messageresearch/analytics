[7:32] friends
[7:33] let's just take our bibles while we're
[7:35] standing and go to genesis chapter two
[7:37] we'll start right into the word while
[7:40] you're turning there i want to make an
[7:41] announcement
[7:43] not this coming sunday but the following
[7:45] sunday
[7:46] august 23rd brother aaron mcgeary will
[7:48] be here ministering for us in the
[7:50] service
[7:50] so be praying for that it's interesting
[7:53] to note that the last visiting ministry
[7:55] we had was aaron mcgeary in march
[7:58] before all the covert broke out and now
[8:01] we've got this
[8:02] long gap and now the first visiting
[8:04] minister will have
[8:06] after that will be aaron mcgeary so god
[8:09] just worked it out that way so we thank
[8:11] god for that
[8:12] she'll be praying for that that'll be
[8:13] august 23rd amen
[8:15] let's look at genesis chapter 2
[8:19] verse 8.
[8:24] and the lord god planted a garden
[8:25] eastward in eden and there he put the
[8:28] man whom he had formed
[8:30] and out of the ground made the lord god
[8:32] to grow every tree that is pleasant to
[8:34] the sight and good for food the tree of
[8:36] life
[8:37] also in the midst of the garden in the
[8:39] tree of knowledge
[8:40] of good and evil and a river went out of
[8:43] eden to water the garden
[8:45] and from thence it parted and became
[8:48] into four heads so i want to look at
[8:49] verse 10 closely and
[8:51] a river went out of eden to water the
[8:53] garden so the the water was
[8:55] the garden was watered by this river
[8:57] that went out of eden and from thence it
[8:58] was parted and became
[9:00] into four heads let's bow our heads and
[9:02] ask the lord's blessing
[9:04] lord jesus we ask that you would bless
[9:06] our time together lord
[9:08] we've come here for a purpose and has to
[9:10] worship your name
[9:12] we've come to commune with you lord
[9:14] we've come to hear from you
[9:15] and we pray o great shepherd would you
[9:17] feed us your sheep now lord
[9:20] while we know your method we know how
[9:21] you've chosen lord to communicate in
[9:23] this hour
[9:24] and we receive that lord we ask that you
[9:26] would take these lips of clay and speak
[9:28] your eternal words
[9:30] give us ears to hear and a heart to
[9:31] perceive all you have for us so father
[9:34] may you be glorified and praised in all
[9:36] we say and do
[9:37] in jesus name we pray amen you can have
[9:40] your seats
[9:43] so we see here in the very very
[9:46] beginning of the book god had
[9:48] planted a garden eastward in eden
[9:51] and there there was a river that went
[9:53] out of eden to water the garden and from
[9:55] then it split into four heads
[9:58] and i wanted to take a look uh
[10:01] this evening if we can at the subject a
[10:03] tree of life fed by the water of life
[10:06] the tree of life fed by the water of
[10:08] life and just take a look at this
[10:10] for a little while we know that the book
[10:12] of genesis in the book of revelations
[10:15] they mark the cornerstone and capstone
[10:18] of the bible
[10:19] if we could understand it that way
[10:21] everything that finishes in revelations
[10:23] began in genesis genesis the seed
[10:25] chapter
[10:26] revelations is the capping off the the
[10:28] capstone
[10:29] of the bible and brother bam said both
[10:31] of them are written
[10:32] symbols so so we're not we're looking at
[10:36] the symbols here and what it means for
[10:37] us
[10:38] because to me under the revelation of
[10:41] the
[10:41] hour as god has brought it so close to
[10:44] us personally
[10:45] that all of these things that we talk
[10:47] about find representation in us
[10:50] and we find the application in us for so
[10:52] many of these things
[10:54] and brother branham says in the message
[10:56] super sign
[10:57] from 1962 nebuchadnezzar built a super
[11:00] city
[11:01] it had hanging gardens and it was a
[11:03] great place it was a pattern of heaven
[11:06] right before the throne flowed the river
[11:08] euphrates and they found out that that's
[11:10] the way the throne of god the river of
[11:11] life by the throne of god is
[11:13] trying to achieve something trying to
[11:15] make it big great big great
[11:17] so he could say see what i done and
[11:20] he goes on and there's another message
[11:22] the sign of the time in 1958
[11:24] he said like in oslo not long ago i went
[11:26] down to the
[11:27] main part of the city and it was a
[11:28] narrow so narrow that an automobile
[11:30] could hardly squeeze its way through
[11:32] because it was made for chariots before
[11:34] they had automotive
[11:36] and we are told that the streets of
[11:37] babylon were 200 feet across and the
[11:40] gates of the city
[11:41] were made some 80 feet tall of solid
[11:43] brass
[11:44] and the walls were 200 feet tall and was
[11:46] wide enough on top
[11:48] that they could run three chariots and a
[11:50] breast
[11:51] a horse race around the city and it was
[11:53] also the great city had gardens great
[11:55] gardens all along these walls
[11:57] and the palace set in the center of the
[11:59] city and every street led straight to
[12:01] the palace
[12:02] rome rome's built the same way it was
[12:05] called by our bible in modern babylon
[12:07] and all roads lead to rome all streets
[12:09] lead to the palace
[12:10] and the palace was built where the river
[12:12] euphrates which irrigated
[12:14] this big shinar valley came down from
[12:16] tigris and irrigated the valley
[12:18] it was a great rich country and this
[12:20] river was built or the throne was built
[12:22] rather
[12:22] so that the river run right along the
[12:24] front of the throne
[12:26] now if my friends hear you bible readers
[12:28] understand that was a pattern of the
[12:30] heavenly throne
[12:31] the river of life flows by the throne of
[12:33] god and the great garden
[12:35] so you see it was a perverted version of
[12:37] glory
[12:38] it belonged and was built and brought up
[12:40] by satan like all other kingdoms of the
[12:42] world
[12:43] are ruled and governed by satan
[12:46] so you can see what nebuchadnezzar was
[12:49] was reproducing as anointed by satan
[12:51] what was satan was trying to reproduce
[12:54] on earth what was in heaven
[12:56] and we find out it's very similar when
[12:58] you look at it
[12:59] and in junction with the garden of eden
[13:01] the garden of eden had this river
[13:03] that flowed through it and and out of it
[13:06] it branched into four heads and
[13:08] and there was there the tree of life and
[13:10] also the tree of knowledge of good and
[13:11] evil and
[13:12] then if you begin to look at the garden
[13:13] eden and you reflect it back
[13:15] to what's being told about the the tree
[13:18] of life and the
[13:19] and the water of life flowing from the
[13:21] throne of god and and all these things
[13:22] you see that eden
[13:24] itself the garden of eden was a
[13:25] reflection of heaven
[13:27] god had made something on earth that was
[13:29] reflected in heaven amen and
[13:31] we see all these same types carrying
[13:33] through and now
[13:34] now satan is trying through
[13:37] nebuchadnezzar
[13:38] through babylon to reproduce what's in
[13:40] heaven but doing it in a carnal way
[13:42] even so that it had great gardens and a
[13:45] river come from the throne by the throne
[13:47] and
[13:47] went out and watered the gardens and it
[13:49] became a beautiful place
[13:51] and so satan is always trying to
[13:53] reproduce what god is doing
[13:56] trying to replicate it let's turn to
[13:59] genesis 13 together
[14:02] this is a as i got into this i actually
[14:05] started on another subject
[14:07] and uh early today god just shifted me
[14:10] in another this direction
[14:12] and this is a really large subject it's
[14:14] huge but we won't have time to exhaust
[14:16] it
[14:17] at all we're just going to hit some
[14:18] points and i want to draw something out
[14:20] of that for ourselves
[14:22] and then maybe the lord sunday will let
[14:24] us move on to my original thought
[14:26] and genesis 13 verse 10
[14:31] and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld
[14:33] all the plain of jordan
[14:35] that it was well watered everywhere
[14:37] before the lord destroyed sodom and
[14:39] gomorre even as the garden of the lord
[14:41] liked the land of egypt
[14:42] as thou comest unto zore then lot
[14:45] chose him all the plane of jordan and
[14:47] lot journeyed east
[14:49] and they separated themselves the one
[14:50] from the other so now we find in the
[14:53] separation of abraham and lot
[14:55] we know that there was tension and and
[14:57] god ordained it because there had to be
[14:59] a separation because
[15:00] abraham had not would not willingly
[15:02] separate from lot
[15:04] and and when he told lot you can go
[15:05] wherever you want lot looked out
[15:07] and he saw the plains of jordan where
[15:10] sodom and gomorrah was and he saw that
[15:12] it was well
[15:13] watered amen like the garden of god
[15:16] amen and there was a garden of god on
[15:18] earth because there's a garden of god in
[15:19] heaven
[15:20] and brother venom reflect he uses
[15:22] phrases like this
[15:24] and so now we see there's one reflected
[15:26] to another reflected and then another
[15:28] reflection
[15:29] but we know the the well watering it's
[15:32] well watered you well water a land
[15:35] to produce fruit a well-watered land
[15:38] produces fruit a well-watered land is
[15:41] desirable
[15:42] and a well-watered land is tender and
[15:44] sweet
[15:46] and so god had a well-water he's got a
[15:48] well-watered garden in heaven he had a
[15:50] well-watered garden in eden
[15:52] and now we find that the the valley in
[15:55] jordan was well watered but satan came
[15:57] in and corrupted it
[15:58] and they took the blessings and they
[16:00] took the benefits of that
[16:02] and they perverted it until sodom became
[16:04] absolutely con
[16:05] perverted and corrupt although it was
[16:07] well watered like the garden of god
[16:10] just like babylon
[16:13] sodom and gomorrah so satan is always
[16:15] running a parallel tract with god
[16:17] trying to reproduce but his reproduction
[16:20] always goes into corruption and
[16:21] perversion
[16:23] every time brother man says in the
[16:26] message super sign
[16:28] nimrod one time he wanted to achieve a
[16:31] way to go to heaven without
[16:32] an atonement so he built a super tower
[16:35] there's many towers but he tried to
[16:37] build a super tower
[16:38] what happened to it it fell along came
[16:41] nebuchadnezzar and
[16:42] he built a super city though he could
[16:44] build these big walls
[16:45] walled wide enough that he could run a
[16:47] chariot race around them
[16:49] the great iron gate and the things that
[16:50] he built put the river right through the
[16:53] middle a type of heaven
[16:54] swinging gardens in his throne right by
[16:56] the river like the river euphrates and
[16:58] like the river of life in the garden of
[17:00] eden and the river of life and the
[17:02] kingdom of god
[17:03] and what happened it fell because it
[17:05] could not stand
[17:06] so god brother branham is drawing these
[17:09] parallels between
[17:10] the the garden and the kingdom of god
[17:11] the garden in heaven the garden in eden
[17:14] and now satan tried to reproduce the
[17:16] same kind of garden
[17:17] in babylon but it fell because there's
[17:19] only one garden of god that can stand
[17:22] amen and it is well watered there's a
[17:26] water coming from the throne of god the
[17:28] water of life
[17:29] flowing out and watering this let's look
[17:32] at
[17:32] john chapter 7.
[17:38] now remember genesis and revelation
[17:42] are a book of symbols don't forget that
[17:47] as we move on don't miss the symbols
[17:49] because so many times
[17:51] you know we're trying to get back to a
[17:54] garden of eden
[17:56] and we want to return and and there was
[17:59] a a message uh friday night when we were
[18:01] up at brother dan ratliffs and brother
[18:03] mcgeary preached friday night
[18:05] and he took a subject on the original
[18:06] purpose and was talking about some
[18:08] things in the garden of eden
[18:09] and it triggered a lot of thinking for
[18:11] me i've been meditating on it a lot
[18:13] and and we find that that that god
[18:17] when he we want to get back to the
[18:18] garden of eden that's our goal we want
[18:20] to go back
[18:21] amen we want to go back where we can
[18:23] walk in the cool of the night and eat
[18:24] the fruit and
[18:25] and all of this but remember those were
[18:27] symbols
[18:29] and it's not that there's not a real
[18:30] garden and there's not that there wasn't
[18:32] a great place where they actually walked
[18:34] on this earth
[18:35] but but god wants to produce amen a
[18:38] garden of eden then you and i
[18:41] god wants us to be able to walk in the
[18:42] cool of the evening with him now
[18:44] amen spiritually he wants us to come to
[18:47] the invisible union
[18:48] amen the bridegroom and the bride a
[18:50] return of adam
[18:51] and eve and he wants to do that now
[18:54] spiritually he wants the symbols amen to
[18:56] be real in our lives
[18:58] now so we're longing to get back to
[19:00] something amen but if we want along to
[19:02] get back to the physical
[19:04] as in so many things in the scripture we
[19:06] must understand and realize
[19:08] the supernatural spiritual that god's
[19:10] desiring to do in our lives now
[19:13] and let's go to john chapter 7 verse 37
[19:18] and look at just a couple things john 7
[19:21] 37 in the last day the great day of the
[19:24] feast jesus stood and cried saying
[19:26] if any man thirsts let him come unto me
[19:28] and drink
[19:29] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[19:32] said out of his belly shall flow rivers
[19:34] of living water
[19:36] so here we come back to this whole idea
[19:38] of
[19:39] a river of life or a river of living
[19:41] water
[19:42] and a living water is water that's alive
[19:44] or has life in it
[19:46] so he says uh if any man's thirst let
[19:49] him come to me and drink
[19:51] so what is jesus jesus is the river of
[19:54] life
[19:55] what river of life the one that flows
[19:57] out of the throne of god from heaven
[20:00] you see jesus is the river of life he's
[20:02] the bread of life
[20:04] he's the throne of god he's the temple
[20:06] of god
[20:07] he's the lamb of god you see christ
[20:11] christ is the anointed word whatever god
[20:14] thought when that comes into an
[20:15] expression that's christ
[20:17] so he can be the bread of life he can be
[20:19] the throat he can be the throne of god
[20:23] and the water of life that comes out
[20:25] from that throne
[20:26] and the tree of life that's watered by
[20:28] that water
[20:31] you understand he can he can be
[20:34] the bridegroom and he can be the bride
[20:39] oh don't you love the word of god
[20:44] amen he can be he can
[20:48] be in our communion and feet washing
[20:50] service
[20:51] he can be the one it can be christ
[20:53] kneeling at your feet to serve you and
[20:55] wash your feet
[20:57] and it can be cr it can be christ
[21:00] washing christ's feet
[21:06] praise be to god so these things are all
[21:09] symbols of god the thought of god god's
[21:11] intention god's desire
[21:13] god's thinking now comes in an
[21:15] expression and he expresses it in word
[21:17] and he expresses it in symbols
[21:18] he expresses it in in nature and reality
[21:21] amen it's all expressing the same thing
[21:24] the thoughts of god
[21:26] amen and so and so christ is those
[21:29] anointed thoughts made manifest
[21:32] so we we don't want to get caught up
[21:35] in terminology and and separate things
[21:38] and this is this and this is that
[21:40] it's all god it's all god it's all god's
[21:44] word it's the expression of god's
[21:46] thought
[21:46] amen it's christ expressed in the throne
[21:49] christ
[21:49] expressed in the water of life christ
[21:51] expressed in the bread of life christ
[21:53] expressed in the tree of life
[21:55] christ expressed in the streets of gold
[22:01] so so he says now i want to read this
[22:04] again if any man thirst let him come to
[22:06] me
[22:06] and drink why come to him and drink amen
[22:09] because when he was with the samaritan
[22:11] woman in john chapter 4
[22:12] he said if you knew who you were talking
[22:14] to you'd ask of me of water i would give
[22:16] you that you would never thirst again
[22:18] what water is he talking about the water
[22:20] of life amen springing up from you
[22:22] a well of everlasting life this is the
[22:25] water of life
[22:26] coming from the throne of god and he
[22:30] says
[22:30] he that believeth on me verse 38 he that
[22:32] believeth on me as the scripture has
[22:34] said
[22:34] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[22:36] living water
[22:38] so now when you come to christ and drink
[22:42] and you drink of christ now what comes
[22:45] out of your belly
[22:46] amen whatever you drank is now coming
[22:49] out of you
[22:51] verse 39 but this he spake spake he of
[22:55] the spirit
[22:56] which they that believeth on him should
[22:57] receive for the holy ghost was not yet
[22:59] given because that jesus was not yet
[23:01] glorified
[23:02] so he's saying if you come to me and
[23:06] drink and receive in my spirit then out
[23:08] of your belly will flow the spirit
[23:10] the holy spirit
[23:13] brother branham said in the message
[23:15] revelation chapter 4
[23:17] from 1961 he preached this after he was
[23:19] done with the
[23:20] revelation of the church ages this is
[23:22] this is uh
[23:24] january of 1961 he said now the first
[23:26] throne was in heaven
[23:28] judgment see the second throne was in
[23:30] christ the third throne is in man
[23:34] so the first throne was in heaven and
[23:37] out of that throne came a river of life
[23:40] then the second throne was in christ and
[23:43] out of that throne came a river of life
[23:47] and the third throne is in man and out
[23:49] of that
[23:50] throne comes a river of life it's the
[23:52] same thing as john chapter 7
[23:56] and so he says in
[24:00] the fourth seal when he's preaching the
[24:01] seals in march in 1963 in the fourth
[24:05] seal
[24:05] he says as the natural wine reveals
[24:07] itself in stimulated power
[24:09] so does the new wine as it reveals the
[24:11] word of god
[24:12] which is spirit now remember
[24:16] when he says if you if you drink out of
[24:18] your belly shall flow with the rivers of
[24:19] living water and he was speaking of the
[24:20] spirit
[24:22] that shall come and now brother branham
[24:23] is telling us now now
[24:25] so does the new wine as it reveals the
[24:27] word of god which is spirit
[24:30] the word itself is spirit
[24:34] but the presence the fourth field the
[24:35] word itself is spirit
[24:38] so the question is what is receiving the
[24:42] spirit
[24:45] the word itself is spirit you believe
[24:48] that
[24:49] let's read it he says let's see who said
[24:52] it and then we'll know whether it's
[24:53] truth
[24:53] saint john the sixth chapter sixth
[24:55] chapter i believe it's the
[24:57] 60 or 63rd verse all right yes
[25:00] it is the spirit that quick and it's the
[25:02] flesh prophet and nothing the words that
[25:03] i speak unto you they are spirit
[25:05] and they are life then brother brahm
[25:08] says the word itself is spirit
[25:11] it's spirit in word form
[25:14] amen because the word contains the
[25:17] spirit the spirit comes with the word
[25:19] the word and the spirit are linked
[25:20] together
[25:21] and we've been through this so many
[25:22] times brother brahm said the spirit
[25:24] the holy ghost was bound amen it was
[25:27] bound
[25:28] why it was bound by in denomination by
[25:30] denominational rivers by creeds and
[25:32] dogmas
[25:33] so the misunderstanding of the word of
[25:35] god and the false teaching of the word
[25:37] of god
[25:37] when the word of god was hindered or
[25:40] bound
[25:41] the holy ghost was bound but it's to be
[25:44] loosed in the evening time by the
[25:45] evening time message
[25:46] the holy ghost back in the church again
[25:49] what came
[25:50] back and what came back in the end time
[25:52] message
[25:53] the full revelation of the full word
[25:55] came back and when the word came back
[25:57] the holy ghost now was unbound to come
[25:59] back in the church again
[26:01] you cannot separate these two things the
[26:04] word
[26:04] and the spirit
[26:08] so the word itself is spirit it's spirit
[26:10] and word form
[26:12] and then you see when it is quickened or
[26:14] brought to life
[26:15] the spirit of the word goes to work and
[26:17] acts
[26:18] now look here i thought a thought has to
[26:21] be a thought before it can be a word
[26:23] and then when it's a thought it's
[26:25] presented it's a word
[26:26] amen when that word comes it comes with
[26:29] the spirit
[26:29] or with the life to make that word live
[26:33] he's not talking about brother man's not
[26:36] talking about
[26:36] just being able to read a text and i got
[26:39] the word
[26:40] no but when you receive amen that word
[26:43] by revelation
[26:44] into the soul when you receive that word
[26:46] that word comes with a spirit
[26:48] and that spirit comes to bring life to
[26:50] that word that you receive
[26:51] so that back out of you comes life or
[26:54] spirit
[26:55] back out of your belly first throne was
[26:58] in heaven
[26:58] second throne was in christ third throne
[27:00] was in man and out from under the throne
[27:02] comes the river
[27:04] of life and the word itself
[27:08] is spirit now let's turn to revelation
[27:15] i hope god will help me tie these things
[27:17] together but if i can't do it
[27:19] god can do it he can do it in your heart
[27:24] revelation 22 17
[27:29] we go all the way to the end of the book
[27:31] of revelations right here at the
[27:32] finishing up
[27:34] and revelation 22 17 says in the spirit
[27:36] and the bride say come
[27:39] see now they're working in conjunction
[27:41] they're working as one
[27:42] the spirit and the bride say come it's
[27:44] not like
[27:45] the spirit is over here saying come and
[27:47] then the bride's over here also saying
[27:49] come
[27:50] but the spirit and the bride are coupled
[27:52] together amen and the spirit and the
[27:53] bride are saying come
[27:55] that voice is now coming from the to
[27:57] through the final voice to the final age
[28:00] it is now coming through revelation
[28:02] chapter 10 verse 8 to 11.
[28:04] eat the book and prophesy again amen she
[28:07] now is the final voice to the final age
[28:09] and the spirit now is speaking amen it's
[28:12] speaking where
[28:13] out of those who have come to christ and
[28:15] drank received his word
[28:17] and now out of their belly is flowing
[28:19] rivers of living water
[28:22] and now the spirit and the bride say
[28:24] come
[28:26] and let him that heareth say come and
[28:28] let him that is a thirst come
[28:29] and whosoever will let him take the
[28:31] water of life
[28:33] freely let's turn back to revelation 19.
[28:42] revelation 19 and 5.
[28:48] and the voice came out of the throne
[28:50] saying praise our god
[28:51] all ye his servants and ye that fear him
[28:53] both small and great
[28:54] and i heard as it were the voice of a
[28:56] great multitude and as the voice of many
[28:58] waters
[28:58] and as the voice of mighty thundering
[29:00] saying alleluia for the lord god
[29:02] omnipotent reigneth
[29:04] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[29:06] honor to him for the marriage of the
[29:08] lamb has come
[29:09] and his wife hath made herself ready
[29:13] now brother ben is going to tell us in
[29:15] proving his word
[29:17] when the marriage takes place because in
[29:20] the message proving his word
[29:21] he said the marriage takes place here we
[29:24] go to the wedding supper but the
[29:26] the marriage the union is here
[29:29] so this is something that takes place on
[29:32] the earth
[29:33] amen when when each member of the bride
[29:36] amen comes to that place amen where
[29:38] they're born again by the spirit of god
[29:40] amen they go into an invisible union
[29:43] with with christ
[29:45] and he says now he says the white i read
[29:47] verse 7 again let us be glad and rejoice
[29:49] and give honor to him
[29:50] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[29:52] and his wife had made herself ready
[29:54] and to her was granted that she should
[29:56] be arrayed and fine linen clean and
[29:58] white
[29:58] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[30:01] of the saints
[30:02] let's read on to verse 9 and he sayeth
[30:05] unto me right blessed are they which are
[30:06] called unto the marriage supper
[30:08] of the lamb and he saith unto me these
[30:10] are the true sayings
[30:12] of god let's look over at
[30:15] chapter 21
[30:18] verse 1.
[30:24] and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[30:27] for the first heaven and the first earth
[30:29] were passed away
[30:30] and there was no more sea and i john saw
[30:32] the holy city new jerusalem coming down
[30:34] from god
[30:35] out of heaven prepared as a bride
[30:38] adorned for her husband
[30:40] now it's interesting that the city is
[30:43] described
[30:44] as a bride adorned for a husband
[30:47] because you know it's not
[30:51] brick and mortar that god is so
[30:53] interested in
[30:56] but it's his attributes or his seed
[31:01] and see you know when sometimes when we
[31:04] get that image or at least for myself
[31:07] sometimes when i get an image of christ
[31:08] and his bride i'm looking at two figures
[31:10] like a man and a woman standing at an
[31:12] altar
[31:13] two getting married together but really
[31:15] the images
[31:16] that image is not correct because
[31:18] christ's bride is not
[31:19] one vessel christ's bride is a
[31:21] mini-member bride
[31:23] so christ's bride is a city
[31:27] is the new jerusalem is the heavenly
[31:31] city every individual stone
[31:34] placed in that city making up the city
[31:36] makes
[31:37] up the bride of jesus christ amen it's
[31:39] not it's not an
[31:41] image of just one man one woman and we
[31:43] know collectively the bride is one
[31:45] but when you look at that that singular
[31:48] pyramid-shaped city coming down
[31:50] all of those stones in there represent
[31:52] individuals it's in the bride
[31:54] making up one bride and the bride is a
[31:57] city
[31:58] because the bride is many and cities are
[32:01] in the feminine
[32:02] and this city's coming down like a bride
[32:04] adorned for her husband
[32:06] amen because he's coming as a king and
[32:08] the king has to come to a place
[32:11] there's no there's there's no kings
[32:12] there's no point in kings or kingdoms
[32:14] if he has no throne to sit on and he has
[32:16] no subjects he has
[32:18] he has nothing it's just a man says i'm
[32:20] a king so what you're a king
[32:22] but a king needs a place to rule a king
[32:24] needs people a king
[32:26] needs a family a king needs a throne
[32:29] and now the throne is at the top of the
[32:31] city because it's been building over
[32:33] seven
[32:33] church ages and now come to the capstone
[32:36] age where
[32:37] the holy ghost is loose to come in
[32:38] fullness christ himself
[32:40] can now come and sit on his throne at
[32:42] the top
[32:43] of the city so the city
[32:47] is a mini-membered bride the city or the
[32:51] seat of christ
[32:52] that city is now christ is joined to the
[32:55] city
[32:56] the king is on the throne amen christ is
[32:58] now the light of the city
[33:00] all of these terms represent they're all
[33:02] symbolic
[33:03] and they're representing what's happened
[33:05] in your in our day today
[33:07] christ has come the light has come all
[33:09] light of all seven church ages and the
[33:11] revelation of the seven thunders
[33:13] the light has come into the city the
[33:15] lamb is on the throne
[33:17] at the top in the cap and now he's
[33:19] illuminating the city
[33:20] and the city doesn't need sun or moon it
[33:23] doesn't need anything natural
[33:24] it doesn't need anything from the
[33:26] previous dispensations amen
[33:28] but now the lamb is here and he is the
[33:30] light the illumination the revelation
[33:32] amen the teacher he is here and he's
[33:35] shining the whole bible
[33:38] and she is adorned amen as a bride
[33:41] adorned for her husband
[33:42] why because this is a marriage union
[33:45] christ is coming into a city
[33:47] christ is coming to his throne
[33:50] where at the top of the city and so
[33:53] you know we we get uh
[33:57] ideas you know and and the symbolism can
[34:00] begin to tie us down
[34:01] amen and not realize that these symbols
[34:04] all
[34:04] are represented right here all around us
[34:07] all over the earth
[34:08] amen are living stones built into a
[34:10] habitation of god
[34:12] they've been building up over seven
[34:14] churches but to be capped off at the end
[34:16] and what what is each stone it's a
[34:19] living word
[34:21] and the living word through each aid was
[34:23] built up and built up until collectively
[34:25] the living word at the end of time
[34:26] becomes the capstone ministry christ
[34:28] comes down and connects with that and
[34:30] when he connects with that he connects
[34:32] with the whole city
[34:36] so what are we waiting for we're waiting
[34:37] for the last member to come in
[34:41] praise be to god so now this city
[34:46] it's like a bride prepared for his
[34:47] husband christ is the king is the
[34:50] husband the city is his people
[34:53] his bride they're joining together he's
[34:56] back
[34:56] on his throne and out from under his
[34:59] throne
[35:00] comes the river of life
[35:03] let's look at verse 5.
[35:10] and he that sat upon the throne said
[35:12] behold i make all things new and he
[35:14] saith unto me right
[35:15] for these words are true and faithful
[35:21] let me see am i in the right spot no i'm
[35:24] in the wrong spot let's go down to verse
[35:25] 9.
[35:27] and there came unto me one of the seven
[35:28] angels which had the seven vials full of
[35:30] the seven last plagues
[35:31] and talked with me saying come hither i
[35:34] will show thee the bride
[35:35] the lamb's wife now remember everything
[35:38] i told you before
[35:39] because now one of the seven angels
[35:44] which of the seven angels showed us the
[35:48] lamb's wife
[35:50] so this comes right to our day one of
[35:52] the seven angels
[35:55] which had the seven vials full of the
[35:56] seven last plagues talked with me saying
[35:59] come hither
[36:00] i will show thee the bride the lamb's
[36:01] wife and he carried me away in the
[36:03] spirit to a great and high mountain and
[36:05] showed me that great
[36:06] city the holy jerusalem descending out
[36:09] of heaven from god
[36:11] having the glory of god and her light
[36:13] was likened to a stone most precious
[36:15] even like a jasper stone
[36:16] clear as crystal he goes on down to the
[36:19] rest of the chapter describing
[36:20] that city and the placing of the things
[36:22] in the city but it's interesting that
[36:24] one of these angels one of these seven
[36:27] angels having the seven plagues
[36:28] amen come to john and said i'm gonna
[36:31] show you the
[36:32] i'm gonna show you the bride i'm gonna
[36:33] show you the lamb's wife and when he
[36:35] looked to see the lamb's wife he saw
[36:37] a city and and brother branham is
[36:41] preaching in future home and he's
[36:43] preaching about this city
[36:44] and he's giving dimensions and he's
[36:46] talking about after the millennium
[36:48] this great fire that's going to come
[36:49] down and a mountain's going to push up a
[36:51] city that's going to rest over top of
[36:54] this mountain and
[36:55] he's going through all of this and show
[36:56] us all of the natural
[36:58] amen that's going to take place and but
[37:00] he but then he says something right
[37:02] there
[37:03] in in a future home and he says i could
[37:06] drop a little something right here
[37:10] and he says that 1500 miles that's about
[37:12] the dimensions that we have sitting
[37:14] right in this church
[37:16] tonight now why
[37:19] you have to ask yourself why is he
[37:20] dropping this is it just purely
[37:22] anecdotal
[37:23] is it just purely coincidence and
[37:24] interesting was the prophet just
[37:26] interested in the fact that we have
[37:27] people here from georgia to maine
[37:29] and from saskatchewan you know was that
[37:32] just a curious
[37:35] set of circumstances and he just wanted
[37:37] to drop something and just point out
[37:38] this is weird hey man i've been talking
[37:40] about a city 1500 miles square and you
[37:42] know what's weird is we got people here
[37:44] representing about that kind of border
[37:47] but what he's showing you is that city
[37:50] is reflected
[37:51] on this earth now the city is
[37:54] here friends amen everything that the
[37:57] symbol symbolized is here
[37:58] amen being symbolized and lived down and
[38:00] fleshed out through the bride
[38:04] what he's trying to drop i'm going to
[38:05] drop a little something here
[38:07] amen this this brother's from jordan
[38:09] this brother's from maine and this
[38:10] brother's from saskatchewan
[38:13] so what i want to interrupt what i'm
[38:16] teaching and drop a little something
[38:18] here where people live
[38:22] you realize the the prophet there's so
[38:25] many things that he's trying to get the
[38:27] people to say
[38:27] but under the third pull he's not
[38:29] allowed to come right out and say it
[38:33] but can you see that that city is a
[38:36] bride
[38:37] and that bride is on earth amen and
[38:39] everything that's symbolized in that
[38:41] city
[38:41] is in this bride
[38:44] there's a throne there's a river of life
[38:47] there's a tree of life
[38:50] praise be to god he says in future home
[38:56] and in here we'll dwell the redeemed
[38:59] these avenues
[39:00] and big freeways as it was parks the
[39:02] river of life will draw
[39:04] run through it and every house will be
[39:06] made of transparent gold
[39:08] and the streets will be made of gold and
[39:10] the trees the trees of life will be
[39:12] there
[39:15] i'll read that again the trees of life
[39:20] will be there
[39:23] and will bear twelve manner of fruit and
[39:25] the kings and the honored men of the
[39:27] earth shall bring their honor and glory
[39:28] into the gates
[39:29] and the gates shall not be shut by night
[39:31] because there is no night there
[39:34] you know uh
[39:37] the if you look at the the house is made
[39:40] of transparent gold
[39:42] now this is a funny statement because
[39:46] what's the point of gold if it's
[39:48] transparent
[39:51] like it's transparent you can see right
[39:54] through it but it's gold
[39:56] see these are it's symbolic friends amen
[40:00] what do you want with transparent gold
[40:01] just get glass
[40:05] but it's showing that the house amen
[40:08] every house in the city is pure
[40:11] it's pure deity on display
[40:14] so what's inside can be seen outside
[40:18] these are these are symbols and they
[40:19] mean something the streets are
[40:21] transparent gold
[40:22] amen there's no corruption you know
[40:25] color is an impurity
[40:27] so this is gold deity not mixed with any
[40:30] more
[40:30] impurity and now you're walking on the
[40:33] word amen with no more impurity
[40:37] the houses are transparent gold
[40:42] praise god and you're comfortable living
[40:44] in them because you have nothing to hide
[40:46] [Music]
[40:48] in this city amen you're comfortable
[40:50] amen
[40:51] don't put me in a house of glass i'll
[40:53] shut all the blinds
[40:55] i'm a private person you know but this
[40:58] this is displaying something brother bam
[41:00] is trying to show us something
[41:02] amen it's transparent glass your life is
[41:05] on display
[41:06] amen nothing is hid this is deity it's
[41:08] coming through the lens of deity and
[41:10] what's on the inside has to shine forth
[41:12] to everyone that's walking by
[41:16] he goes on in future home said notice
[41:19] the river of life perhaps many little
[41:21] streams make it up
[41:23] now in this earth i'm going to close in
[41:25] just a few minutes
[41:27] said in this life i have never seen
[41:30] nothing so quenching
[41:31] as to be in the mountains and find as i
[41:34] preached on the other night that stream
[41:35] bubbling
[41:36] up it's a life-giving resource you'd be
[41:38] tired and thirsty fall down by a good
[41:40] stream
[41:41] way down where germs can't go way down
[41:43] hundreds of feet in the earth
[41:45] is bubbling forth pure genuine
[41:47] life-giving water
[41:49] we appreciate that that's little now the
[41:51] earth has its many streams with
[41:53] refreshing water
[41:54] when you're thirsty and dying you get a
[41:56] good cold drink of that it'll help you
[41:58] to live
[41:59] but look where this one comes from from
[42:02] the throne
[42:03] there is where it gets its life-giving
[42:05] resource comes from
[42:06] under the throne of god where god sits
[42:09] now this water of life jesus says in in
[42:12] john 7 come and drink from me
[42:14] then out of your belly shall flow rivers
[42:16] of living water
[42:17] amen because his throne will be in his
[42:20] bride and out from there will come the
[42:21] waters of life
[42:23] and the spirit and the bride say come
[42:25] come
[42:26] if the spirit and bright say come you
[42:28] realize the spirit and bright are not
[42:30] saying go they're saying come
[42:34] so they're saying come you have to come
[42:35] to where they are to get the drink
[42:40] and so now brother branham is saying
[42:43] it's the life it's coming from under the
[42:45] throne of god
[42:46] amen because when you when you talk
[42:48] about under the throne of god
[42:50] you're going all the way back to
[42:52] original
[42:54] the where did this water come from where
[42:56] did this river of life
[42:58] come from it came from god
[43:01] so if we can follow this river of life
[43:04] all the way back to its original
[43:06] with its original intent with its
[43:08] original meaning with its original
[43:10] revelation
[43:10] amen when we come to the top of the city
[43:13] amen as this water trickles out of the
[43:15] throne
[43:15] and it goes through the avenues and it
[43:17] goes through the streets and it winds
[43:18] its way down the city
[43:20] amen you realize brother bam says it it
[43:23] splits up and
[43:24] it wanders this way and wonders that way
[43:27] and as you come up through seven church
[43:29] ages you can get a little drink over
[43:30] here and a little drink over here
[43:32] but as you get to the top you get closer
[43:34] and closer to the source
[43:36] to the original to the full flow before
[43:39] it's broken up
[43:40] before you can have a little sip here
[43:41] and a little sip here you come right
[43:43] back to the original with the original
[43:45] intent the original meaning
[43:46] original purpose and original thought
[43:51] see where the bride's come to
[43:55] he says now
[43:59] comes from under the throne of god where
[44:00] god sits
[44:02] all of it all of this earth this earth
[44:04] here we live in now
[44:06] everyone whether it be christian or
[44:08] pagan has temples did you ever think of
[44:10] that
[44:10] church is all of them but this one
[44:12] doesn't have any
[44:14] the bible said there was no temple there
[44:16] but the lord god and the lamb is the
[44:18] temple of it
[44:19] the lamb is the light the lamb is the
[44:21] temple the lamb is the throne
[44:23] are you catching this so what is the
[44:25] lamb
[44:26] he's the light he's the temple he's the
[44:28] throne
[44:29] the lamb is the life he is the temple
[44:32] all these temples have objects that are
[44:35] they're worshipping
[44:36] but in this city he is the object he is
[44:38] with his people
[44:39] his spirit his spirit light
[44:43] floods the pyramid city now i realize
[44:46] what brother ben is saying
[44:48] it says that there there'll be a light
[44:51] at the top and that light illuminates
[44:52] but brother ben just called it spirit
[44:54] light
[44:54] we're not talking about natural light
[44:56] we're talking about spirit light that
[44:58] floods the pyramid city
[45:00] like peter and john on top of the
[45:02] mountain the light covered the top of
[45:03] the mountain
[45:04] and the voice spoke this is my beloved
[45:06] son in revelation 21 3 and 4 the
[45:08] tabernacle of god was with man
[45:10] god has tabernacled in man
[45:14] by redeeming him by these three
[45:16] processes now god is going to redeem the
[45:19] earth and the tabernacle in the earth
[45:20] with his subjects of the earth which he
[45:22] brought forth from the earth
[45:24] now god by these three processes which
[45:27] was water
[45:28] amen which was which was water spirit
[45:31] and life amen so he gave the earth a
[45:34] baptism amen with noah's day
[45:36] he burned it with fire amen and he's
[45:38] gonna or he dropped blood on it to
[45:39] sanctify he's gonna burn it with fire
[45:41] under the baptism holy ghost at the end
[45:43] time so that he and his bride could
[45:45] dwell upon it in perfection
[45:47] so he does the same thing to you because
[45:50] you're the temple of god
[45:52] you're the habitation of god so he
[45:55] brings you through justification
[45:57] and water baptism sanctification amen by
[45:59] the life and the blood
[46:00] and now he burns you off amen by the
[46:03] spirit of god
[46:04] why so that the so that the person of
[46:07] the spirit the person himself can come
[46:09] and dwell in you
[46:10] so that there can be amen so that the
[46:12] lamb can sit on the throne
[46:15] where here
[46:18] and out from the throne can come waters
[46:21] of life
[46:30] in the ephesians church age from the
[46:32] church age book he says now
[46:35] that tree back there in eden that tree
[46:38] which was the source of life was jesus
[46:42] in john chapter 6 through 8 jesus sets
[46:44] himself forth as the source of eternal
[46:46] life
[46:46] he called himself the bread from heaven
[46:49] he spoke of giving himself and that if a
[46:51] man ate of him he would never die
[46:53] he proclaimed that he knew abraham and
[46:55] the and that before abraham he was he
[46:57] prophesied that he himself would give
[46:59] them living water
[47:00] that if any man drank he would never
[47:02] thirst again but would live eternally
[47:04] he showed himself as the great i am he
[47:07] is the bread of life
[47:08] the well of life the eternal one the
[47:10] tree of life
[47:11] he was back there in eden in the midst
[47:13] of the garden even as he will be in the
[47:16] midst of the paradise of god
[47:18] so you have to you say what what is
[47:22] christ what is he
[47:23] he's the bread of life he's the well of
[47:26] life
[47:26] he's the river of life he's the eternal
[47:28] one he's the tree of life
[47:31] what is that expressions of christ
[47:35] he was back there in eden
[47:39] you know remember genesis symbols
[47:44] how was he back there in eden because
[47:46] god gave him his word
[47:49] they had the manifest word for their day
[47:51] they had christ they had the tree of
[47:53] life
[47:53] amen they could have kept eating from
[47:55] the tree of life and live amen but they
[47:57] decided to go over
[47:58] eve decided to go over and sample from
[48:01] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[48:02] and she sampled from the tree that was
[48:04] mixed with
[48:05] reasoning and lust but she could have
[48:08] kept eating from the tree of life
[48:10] but she chose to eat from the tree of
[48:12] knowledge of good and evil according to
[48:14] her own reasoning
[48:16] you realize that those those trees are
[48:19] still here
[48:22] those steel those trees are still here
[48:25] amen and we can eat from water we can
[48:26] eat from the other but what we eat from
[48:28] is going to produce a life
[48:30] because you are what you eat and what
[48:32] you eat becomes your life
[48:34] so there's still two trees friends and
[48:37] we can eat from either one of those
[48:38] trees
[48:40] but he he is the tree of life that was
[48:43] back there
[48:44] in eden in the midst of the garden even
[48:46] as he will be in the midst of the
[48:47] paradise
[48:48] of god because what was will be
[48:51] what started in in genesis will be in
[48:53] revelation
[48:57] let's look at revelation 22.
[49:00] revelation 22 and verse 1.
[49:06] and this is really the thought i wanted
[49:08] to get to so i've been working the whole
[49:11] time to get here
[49:13] revelation 22 1 and he showed me a pure
[49:16] river of water of life clear as crystal
[49:18] proceeding
[49:18] out of the throne of god and of the lamb
[49:22] in the midst of the street of it on
[49:23] either side of the river was there the
[49:25] tree of life
[49:26] which bear 12 manner of fruits and
[49:28] yielded her fruit every month
[49:30] and the leaves of the tree were for the
[49:31] healing of the nations
[49:33] now we know this is the tree of life we
[49:35] know that christ was the tree of life in
[49:37] the garden of eden christ is the tree of
[49:39] life and the paradise of god
[49:40] but yet this tree of life is referred to
[49:42] as her
[49:45] and we see also that in the midst of the
[49:47] street and on either side of the river
[49:50] was the tree of life so in the midst of
[49:52] the street on either side of the river
[49:54] is the tree of life
[49:55] if there's a tree of life on either side
[49:57] of the river you have a river and you
[49:59] have a tree of life here and a tree of
[50:00] life here
[50:03] right but it's only one tree of life
[50:07] one tree of life and one expression and
[50:08] one tree of life and another expression
[50:10] are one tree of life and male expression
[50:12] and one tree of life and female
[50:14] expression
[50:15] because the bridegroom tree without the
[50:17] bride tree cannot produce any fruit
[50:20] so it takes male and female to coming
[50:22] together to reproduce itself again
[50:24] and the same thing's true and the tree
[50:26] of life the tree of life is
[50:28] also bridegroom and bride
[50:31] we'll get to that in a minute and so now
[50:35] this this she this this tree of life
[50:40] bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her
[50:42] fruit every month
[50:43] and the leaves of the tree were for the
[50:45] healing of the nations
[50:48] let's go to mark chapter 11. i'm going
[50:50] to take a strange deviation but there's
[50:52] a real reason for it
[50:54] so when you start thinking what in what
[50:56] what in the world is brother chad doing
[50:59] just bear with me humor me just a little
[51:01] bit
[51:03] mark chapter 11 verse 12.
[51:12] mark 11 and 12. on the morrow when they
[51:15] were come to bethany
[51:17] he was hungry and seeing a fig tree of
[51:20] far off having leaves
[51:21] he came if happily he might find
[51:24] anything thereon
[51:26] and when he came to it he found nothing
[51:28] but leaves for the time of figs were not
[51:30] yet
[51:31] this is really important jesus is hungry
[51:35] he wants to be satisfied from this tree
[51:37] and he sees leaves on the tree but
[51:41] but he's hoping to get something from
[51:43] the tree but when he gets there the tree
[51:45] has no figs to give him there's no fruit
[51:47] coming from the tree
[51:48] amen and and it wasn't even the time for
[51:51] figs amen
[51:53] you can say it this way jesus comes out
[51:55] of season
[51:58] jesus came to the tree and we know all
[52:00] his footsteps were ordained
[52:02] everything was right on time but he
[52:04] comes to the fig tree
[52:05] at a time when it wasn't yet time for
[52:08] the fig tree to bear figs but he was
[52:10] he was desiring to get figs from the
[52:12] tree and when he didn't he curses it
[52:15] and let's see here uh
[52:18] verse 14 and jesus answered and said
[52:22] unto it
[52:23] no man eat fruit of thee hereafter
[52:25] forever and his disciples heard it
[52:27] then they move on and then they come
[52:28] back and they realize the tree is
[52:30] withered to the root
[52:32] and they marvel and that's where jesus
[52:33] says that famous line and if you have
[52:35] faith amen the side as the grain of
[52:37] mustard seed you can say unto this
[52:39] mountain be plucked up and cast through
[52:40] the sea and if you doubt not in your
[52:41] heart
[52:42] it'll happen but i want to keep looking
[52:44] at this fig tree
[52:45] because we know the fig tree is a type
[52:47] of israel
[52:49] all right when you see the fig amen
[52:51] budding forth amen know that the time is
[52:53] nine brother bram tells us
[52:54] now very plainly that the fig tree
[52:56] represents israel and when jesus came in
[52:59] his first earthly
[53:00] journey he came to israel out of season
[53:02] it wasn't yet
[53:04] time for them to bear figs because the
[53:05] prophecy said that the nation will be
[53:08] born in a day
[53:09] and that will come at the day of the two
[53:10] witnesses at 144 000.
[53:14] so it looks as though jesus comes out of
[53:16] season amen
[53:17] out of time but it's right on time
[53:20] and he comes to israel amen and there's
[53:23] no figs that he can get from
[53:25] from the nation of israel amen they've
[53:27] got leaves but no figs amen
[53:29] and because it wasn't time for figs
[53:31] that'll come in the future
[53:33] in revelation chapter 11.
[53:37] so he curses that tree amen why because
[53:40] he
[53:40] has to reject he has to reject the jews
[53:44] to turn to the gentiles
[53:47] he has to blind them they have to reject
[53:50] him
[53:50] amen they can't bring forth fruit he's
[53:52] got to reject him and curse them they
[53:54] have to become a cursed people
[53:57] so that he can get a gentile bride
[54:01] so now they they they you say
[54:04] they missed their chance they didn't
[54:06] bring forth fruit
[54:08] he came at a time when it wasn't yet in
[54:11] season they have a time
[54:12] their time is coming when that tree will
[54:15] produce
[54:16] figs and when christ comes he'll find
[54:18] fruit on that tree
[54:21] but i want to look now at the turning to
[54:24] the gentiles
[54:25] because now he's turning to another tree
[54:27] not a fig tree but another tree
[54:30] let's look at ii peter
[54:36] ii peter chapter one
[54:44] second peter chapter one and verse three
[54:50] according as his divine power have given
[54:52] unto us all things that pertain into
[54:54] life and godliness
[54:56] through the knowledge of him that hath
[54:58] called us to glory
[54:59] and virtue whereby are given unto us
[55:02] exceeding great and precious promises
[55:04] that by these you might be partakers of
[55:05] the divine nature
[55:07] having escaped the corruption that is in
[55:09] the world through lust
[55:10] and besides this giving all diligence
[55:12] add to your faith virtue
[55:13] and divert your knowledge and the
[55:15] knowledge temperance into temperance
[55:16] patience
[55:17] to patience godliness into godliness
[55:19] brotherly kindness
[55:20] and the brotherly kindness charity for
[55:23] if these things be in you and abound
[55:24] they make you that you shall neither be
[55:26] barren nor unfruitful
[55:30] what was wrong with the fig tree it was
[55:32] unfruitful
[55:34] it wasn't in season it wasn't bearing
[55:37] but by the time you get to the
[55:40] end of the statue of a perfect man by
[55:41] the time the church
[55:43] comes through faith virtue temperance
[55:45] knowledge as the time the church gets
[55:46] all the way up to the capping of the
[55:48] capstone of charity
[55:49] amen when you come all the way through
[55:52] to the bride age and the capping of
[55:53] charity
[55:54] this if these things be in you in the
[55:57] church in the bride and they abound
[55:59] now the church will neither be barren or
[56:02] unfruitful
[56:04] why because now she will be a tree of
[56:07] life restored back
[56:09] amen julia bridetry restored back to the
[56:11] tree of life
[56:12] and she beareth amen did should bear 12
[56:15] man or a fruit one for every month
[56:17] what does it mean it means this tree
[56:20] never goes out of season
[56:22] this tree every month new harvest new
[56:24] harvest pick pick pick all month
[56:26] new harvest every month this tree will
[56:29] never be barren or unfruitful because
[56:31] it has come to the divine nature built
[56:34] up amen all the way back through ephesus
[56:36] and smyrna and pergamus and thyatira
[56:39] built all the way up to finally the word
[56:41] is restored
[56:42] and the great charity capstone love
[56:44] union
[56:45] marriage whatever you want to say comes
[56:48] to the top
[56:49] and if all of these things be in this
[56:51] bride in the bright age it makes it so
[56:53] that she is neither barren nor
[56:54] unfruitful
[56:55] and christ can find fruit on this tree
[56:58] because she brings forth constantly
[57:04] makes you that you're neither barren nor
[57:06] fruitful in the knowledge of our lord
[57:08] jesus christ
[57:11] let's go to psalms chapter 1.
[57:15] we are all over the bible tonight praise
[57:17] be to god
[57:20] psalms chapter 1.
[57:31] psalms 1 and verse 1
[57:34] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[57:36] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[57:38] in the way of sinners
[57:40] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[57:42] but his delight is in the law of the
[57:44] lord
[57:44] and it is long does he meditate day and
[57:46] night
[57:48] he shall be like a tree planted by the
[57:50] rivers of water
[57:52] that bringeth forth his fruit and his
[57:54] season his leaf also shall not wither
[57:56] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[58:01] say be like a man planted
[58:04] what does he meditate on the word of god
[58:08] his delight is the law or you could say
[58:10] the word of god
[58:11] his delight is the word of god and in
[58:13] the word does he meditate
[58:15] day and night what is the word bring the
[58:18] word
[58:19] is the spirit the spirit and the word
[58:21] come together
[58:24] his delight is the word receiving the
[58:27] spirit
[58:29] in the word which brings the spirit does
[58:32] he meditate
[58:33] day and night what's he doing drinking
[58:35] from the river
[58:39] he shall be like a tree i wonder what
[58:42] kind of tree
[58:44] maybe like a bride tree
[58:47] she'll be like a tree planted by the
[58:49] rivers of water
[58:51] water the water of life the word
[58:54] that bringeth forth his fruit in season
[58:57] his leaf also shall not wither
[58:59] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[59:02] why
[59:02] because he's drinking from the word
[59:05] drinking from the river of life that's
[59:07] flowing from the throne of god
[59:09] amen the pure water of life the pure
[59:12] water that washes the bride the pure
[59:15] water that brings with it life
[59:19] brother bram says in god identifying
[59:22] himself by his characteristics in 1964
[59:25] said i come from tucson where it's
[59:26] really good and dry and i come here
[59:28] and it's really good and wet so there is
[59:30] quite a contrast
[59:32] if you all got all the water over here
[59:33] if you just send it over our way we'd
[59:35] appreciate it
[59:36] but you can't do that of course but i
[59:39] tell you one thing there is a parable
[59:40] there
[59:41] so you just explain you got water we
[59:43] don't got water this is a parable
[59:46] there's a parable there our things in
[59:49] arizona are trees it's full of stickers
[59:52] everything has a sticker it's because
[59:53] it's dry
[59:55] now if that same bush growed over here
[59:57] it'd be a nice lovely leaf see
[59:59] it's without water that's the reason it
[1:00:01] becomes a sticker
[1:00:03] and when the church becomes without the
[1:00:04] water of life it gets dry and sticky too
[1:00:07] sticking and punching and everything but
[1:00:10] where the waters of life flows it opens
[1:00:12] up the leaf and makes it tender
[1:00:14] mellow sweet holy and
[1:00:18] acceptable unto god so may the lord god
[1:00:21] water us tonight
[1:00:23] that we won't be stickers but we'll be
[1:00:25] fine leaves that the wayward people
[1:00:27] might sit down under the tree of our
[1:00:29] shade and find rest to their souls
[1:00:32] brother benham is typing a man like a
[1:00:35] tree
[1:00:37] just like proverbs 1 amen just like in
[1:00:40] eden
[1:00:42] just like in the paradises of god
[1:00:44] brother bear's doing the same thing he's
[1:00:46] drawing a parable
[1:00:47] between a tree and a man
[1:00:50] then over here in arizona he said if you
[1:00:51] take that same
[1:00:53] bush and plant it over here amen it
[1:00:55] wouldn't be sticky it wouldn't have
[1:00:57] stickers on it
[1:00:58] it would leaf would unroll and unfold
[1:01:00] amen and he's showing us what the word
[1:01:03] will produce
[1:01:04] amen because the word amen brings the
[1:01:06] water of life
[1:01:07] with it and you drink from the word the
[1:01:10] water of life

[1:02:05] fruit that is on display with leaves
[1:02:07] that are tender and soft and lush
[1:02:09] and nourishing where the wayward souls
[1:02:11] can come and find
[1:02:12] rest wayward souls lost people
[1:02:17] can come and find rest in our shade why
[1:02:21] because we've drunk enough of the water
[1:02:23] of life that we're not a sticker
[1:02:25] we're not irritable cranky and angry and
[1:02:28] poking everybody but we become
[1:02:30] mellow and soft and tender and loving

[1:03:00] in conflict with everybody around you
[1:03:02] why is there always
[1:03:03] a hateful statement why is there always

[1:03:07] why is there always irritation and
[1:03:09] strife and grumbling and complaining
[1:03:11] and fighting between individuals
[1:03:16] what is it if if if the lamb is here
[1:03:21] if the lamb's on his throne if the water
[1:03:24] of life is gushing forth
[1:03:26] if the tree of life is planted by the
[1:03:28] river of water and drinking forth this
[1:03:30] fresh clean water coming from the throne
[1:03:31] of god how
[1:03:33] how can it have the temperament of a
[1:03:35] cactus
[1:03:38] how can it be as fruitless as the fig
[1:03:40] tree out of season
[1:03:41] waiting someday someday some day no
[1:03:44] today
[1:03:46] amen
[1:03:50] someday i'll be changed someday it'll be

[1:04:11] the right condition
[1:04:13] the right tree just needs the right
[1:04:15] condition it needs the right light
[1:04:17] which has come in this age and it needs
[1:04:19] the right water that's coming this age
[1:04:22] we have everything we need to produce
[1:04:25] the life of jesus
[1:04:26] christ we don't need another move where
[1:04:28] we don't need
[1:04:29] another great a revival we don't need
[1:04:31] any we have
[1:04:32] everything has been given to us the full
[1:04:34] light is here amen to ripen the fruit
[1:04:38] the water of life is here and the full
[1:04:40] intent as it gushed out from the throne

[1:04:45] fruit the light is here the water is
[1:04:47] here
[1:04:48] there is nothing lacking amen we've come
[1:04:51] amen to the divine nature amen through
[1:04:53] seven steps to the capping off
[1:04:56] and if these things be in you and about
[1:04:58] it makes you that you're neither
[1:05:00] unfruitful or barren in the knowledge of
[1:05:02] jesus christ
[1:05:06] where the water of life flows it opens
[1:05:09] the leaf and makes it tender
[1:05:11] mellow sweet holy
[1:05:15] and acceptable unto god so may the lord
[1:05:18] god water us tonight that we won't be
[1:05:20] stickers
[1:05:21] but will be fine leaves that the wayward
[1:05:23] people might sit down under the tree of
[1:05:25] our shade
[1:05:26] and find rest to their souls
[1:05:32] but the man says in christ is the
[1:05:33] mystery of god revealed
[1:05:36] he said when he come on earth he was the
[1:05:39] tree of life
[1:05:41] you believe that what tree of life the
[1:05:44] same one that was in the garden
[1:05:47] so you mean the body of jesus christ was
[1:05:49] back there in the garden
[1:05:53] it was the word it was the word of god
[1:05:58] that was there in the garden
[1:05:59] it was the word of god standing in flesh
[1:06:02] by the sea of galilee
[1:06:03] and it's the word of god that's come
[1:06:05] back to us today
[1:06:08] the same tree of life same one that was
[1:06:10] in eden
[1:06:11] same one all the way through
[1:06:14] and he came on earth he was the tree of
[1:06:16] life do you believe that
[1:06:18] and rome what did they do he had to be
[1:06:21] chopped down
[1:06:22] and he was put on a tree of disgrace
[1:06:24] cursed is he that hang on a tree
[1:06:26] he became a curse for the human race and
[1:06:29] now through that
[1:06:31] he brings forth a bride tree which will
[1:06:33] be the tree of life restored back to him
[1:06:37] catch that was he the tree of life when
[1:06:40] he was here on earth
[1:06:42] he was the tree of life same one that
[1:06:44] was in eden same one as any
[1:06:46] same one that'll be in the paradises of
[1:06:48] god the same one from revelations 22
[1:06:50] same tree of life do we believe that
[1:06:54] that tree was chopped down so out of him
[1:06:57] could come the bride tree which will be
[1:07:00] the same tree of life restored back to
[1:07:03] him
[1:07:05] as husband and wife in the garden of
[1:07:08] eden
[1:07:09] oh glory to god by the same word
[1:07:13] the same god made manifest in husband
[1:07:15] and wife
[1:07:16] the same bride tree back again
[1:07:20] i say friends the bride tree is not a
[1:07:23] secondary tree to the tree of life
[1:07:25] the bride tree is the female part of the
[1:07:27] tree of life
[1:07:30] amen jesus christ is the bridegroom tree
[1:07:33] which is the tree of life
[1:07:34] amen the the bride tree amen is the tree
[1:07:37] of life
[1:07:37] the bridegroom tree is the tree of life
[1:07:39] because when you look in revelation 22
[1:07:41] there's a tree on either side of the
[1:07:42] river
[1:07:45] but in the end of the book she she
[1:07:48] she bringeth forth her fruit in season
[1:07:53] why because the bridegroom the
[1:07:55] bridegroom tree and the bride tree has
[1:07:57] come together again
[1:07:58] christ has been given a virgin bride by
[1:08:00] the spoken word
[1:08:01] to do what to reproduce himself on the
[1:08:04] earth again to do what to bring forth
[1:08:06] the fruit of the tree of life
[1:08:09] the water's been restored the light's
[1:08:11] been restored
[1:08:12] the tree has been restored back to the
[1:08:15] tree of life
[1:08:15] to do what to bring forth the fruit of
[1:08:18] the resurrected jesus christ
[1:08:20] and human beings
[1:08:24] so that we're not stickers and we're not
[1:08:27] pricks and we're not
[1:08:28] poking people and no but we're tender
[1:08:32] mellow sweet humble
[1:08:36] and powerful but not by our own might
[1:08:40] powerful by our faith in the word of god
[1:08:44] and the word of god by word of god god
[1:08:46] is waiting for somebody to take his word
[1:08:48] and believe on it so he can act upon it
[1:08:50] powerful by faith in the word of god not
[1:08:53] by might
[1:08:55] an invincible army because she believes
[1:08:58] the word
[1:09:00] an invincible army because she's
[1:09:01] drinking of the water of life an
[1:09:02] invincible army because she's planted by
[1:09:04] the river of life
[1:09:06] invincible army because god is on the
[1:09:08] throne
[1:09:09] his third throne his church
[1:09:13] the city is represented here in the
[1:09:16] bride
[1:09:17] with a river of life in a tree of life
[1:09:20] and a throne of god
[1:09:22] in a city that's taking the light
[1:09:25] from the lamb and shining that light
[1:09:30] to the whole world why because you live
[1:09:33] in a
[1:09:34] transparent house of gold
[1:09:38] deity tabernacled in flesh
[1:09:42] god wanting to display what's inside
[1:09:46] on the outside let's all stand
[1:09:50] we're not going to go any further

[1:12:01] now it's
[1:12:01] rivers of living water flowing for
[1:12:04] somebody else
