TRANSCRIPT
========================================
when i look at malachi chapter 3 there's of course there's a rebuke there of course there's a curse there but that's not the part that gets me excited what gets me excited is when he begins in verse 10. god himself what he does is he fills out a contract he takes a contract a binding contract and he lays it right in front of you and he's saying do you want to sign it is that what he's done in malachi he's made himself a binding contract he said prove me see if i won't pour out a blessing that you cannot contain this is a contract friends in this contract in order to seal the contract all you have to do is give the tithe an offering that's your signature on the contract and if you sign this contract god himself has obligated himself to this contract and all you had to do amen in order to initiate the contract and the action was to give the tithe and the offering and when you give the tithe in the offering you put god into action because his word won't fail his promises won't fail amen he will never fail to keep his into the bargain amen and when you give your 10 and an offering what you have done you know none of this money is ours we've established that we all understand that we're all in agreement it's not our that god has allowed us energy strength jobs all of these resources so that we can have some goods and then it all comes from god amen it's not ours but god is going to ask us to return unto him a portion to signify that we know where this come from and who he is and that we give honor and respect unto him and in return he says i will let you keep 80 to 90 percent depending on how much your offering is i will let you keep the rest but the 10 in the offering you give to me is security against the rest that you won't lose the rest i'll prosper the rest i'll bless the rest i'll grow the rest of it and it's not yours anyways this is the best deal going if you could find a business model like this you would sign people up in droves it can't fail it won't fail it's a promise of god in the word of god and all he's asking for you to do is catch a revelation of who he is and where everything comes from who the creator is and who god is and to acknowledge it amen by signing the contract by getting yourself in contract with god by paying the tithe and the offering and whatever he's allowed you to remain he says now i'll bless it i'll prosper it i'll stop the devourer from taking from it i'll plug your bag with holes in it now
