[7:24] prayer we just had a prayer request that
[7:25] came in we had a a family visit
[7:29] Sunday they were uh never been here
[7:32] before never heard about the church but
[7:33] they were just drawn and they came for a
[7:35] visit came at the end of service and I
[7:37] had a chance to talk to them and they
[7:39] came last night to the Bible study uh
[7:42] but they were going to come tonight but
[7:43] they called and uh one of the deacons
[7:45] took the call and uh their names are
[7:48] Justin and Felicia Clark but Justin
[7:50] called and said they had a death in the
[7:52] family and requested prayer so they've
[7:55] just come for a visit but they've come
[7:57] because the Lord draw drew them here and
[7:59] I believe it's for a reason amen so I'd
[8:01] like for us to agree together and pray
[8:03] for them as we bow our heads dear
[8:05] heavenly father we thank you Lord for
[8:07] the privilege you've given us of being
[8:09] here tonight we thank you for drawing us
[8:11] for we know it wasn't we who brought
[8:13] ourselves but it was you who drew us to
[8:16] yourself and God we come with joy in our
[8:18] hearts with the privilege of singing
[8:20] your Praises we're so grateful Lord to
[8:22] come to hear your word for we know Lord
[8:25] that you've given us your true word in
[8:28] this last day and we're feasting from
[8:30] your own hand upon yourself Lord you're
[8:33] giving us portions of yourself to help
[8:36] us to grow into your very likeness and
[8:38] we come every service with expectation
[8:41] with gratitude with Thanksgiving Lord
[8:43] knowing Lord that you're changing us
[8:45] from Glory into Glory you're lifting us
[8:48] Lord word by word into your very
[8:50] presence to your very
[8:52] likeness God you know that this couple
[8:55] Justin and Felicia Clark they've come
[8:57] you've drawn them they came for visit
[8:59] they wanted to be here tonight but Lord
[9:01] there's been a death in the family and
[9:03] Justin asked for prayer Lord and I pray
[9:05] that you would comfort them that you
[9:07] would bless them Lord that you would
[9:09] bless the family and may they be a
[9:10] comfort to the family we don't know how
[9:12] closely related this relative was but we
[9:14] pray God that you'd be a friend that
[9:16] sticketh closer than a brother that
[9:18] you'd be the great comforter that you
[9:19] would send your spirit to give
[9:20] Supernatural comfort and as you begun to
[9:23] draw this couple this family to yourself
[9:26] I pray you would continue the work that
[9:28] you've begun to do do that you would
[9:30] open their hearts to the full truth in
[9:31] this hour that you would transfer them
[9:34] by your life by your spirit Lord and
[9:36] that you would bring them all the way in
[9:37] to the fold all the way to yourself Lord
[9:40] that they would come to that invisible
[9:41] Union in this hour for I believe that's
[9:43] why you began drawing them God I pray
[9:46] you'd help us tonight as we look into
[9:48] your word I pray you would take this
[9:50] vessel under your control may I just
[9:52] relax Lord and may you take over and
[9:55] speak your words of eternal life I pray
[9:58] in Jesus Christ
[9:59] name
[10:01] amen amen God bless you all while we're
[10:03] standing let's take our bibles if we
[10:07] can and let's turn to Isaiah 9 we're
[10:10] going to begin with uh Isaiah 9 and6 I
[10:14] just noticed we had a few guests and uh
[10:16] brother Jordan and sister Rebecca
[10:18] Simonson God bless you it's good to have
[10:19] you together we see Rebecca from time to
[10:21] time but it's a treat to have Jordan
[10:22] here as well so God bless you brother
[10:24] Jordan it's good to have you and uh have
[10:27] them together as a family also brother
[10:29] Vernon and his wife iren here God bless
[10:31] you brother Vernon amen they just
[10:33] arrived in the Lima about two hours ago
[10:35] I think and so Brother Kyle picked them
[10:37] up and they've been with Brother Kyle
[10:39] and his family and so God bless you
[10:41] brother Vernon it's good to have you and
[10:42] we're looking forward to hearing from
[10:44] you on Sunday Lord willing amen Isaiah
[10:48] 9:
[10:53] 6 For unto us a child is born unto us a
[10:56] son is given and the government shall be
[10:59] upon his shoulder and his name Shall be
[11:01] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[11:03] God the Everlasting father the prince of
[11:06] peace and the increase of his government
[11:09] shall of increase of his government in
[11:11] peace there shall be no end upon the
[11:13] throne of David and upon his kingdom to
[11:16] order it to establish it with judgment
[11:17] and with Justice from hence forth even
[11:19] forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts
[11:22] will perform this amen God bless you as
[11:24] you have your
[11:25] seats amen we're going to look at a
[11:27] couple scriptures right
[11:29] right off the bat here but I just want
[11:31] to uh make mention of a couple things I
[11:34] I want to zero in on this phrase the
[11:37] government shall be upon his shoulders
[11:39] and that's what I want to take for a
[11:40] text for this evening for a subject to
[11:42] preach on the government shall be upon
[11:45] his
[11:46] shoulders amen and so we see that that
[11:50] uh the word government just means the
[11:52] rule just the Authority or the rule
[11:54] it'll be upon his shoulders and we know
[11:56] that means that he'll the shoulders
[11:58] brother B tell tells us is the strongest
[12:00] part of a man meaning he'll bear it upon
[12:02] himself upon his shoulders amen this
[12:05] government shall be this rule shall be
[12:07] upon him and it and it goes through and
[12:09] tells us he'll be the wonderful
[12:11] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[12:13] father the Prince of Peace so we know
[12:16] that he came in the form of son amen but
[12:18] as form of son he was called wonderful
[12:21] counselor the Mighty God Amen because it
[12:23] was God in the form of his son counselor
[12:27] the uh the Everlasting father that's one
[12:30] of his titles the Everlasting father why
[12:32] because it was the Everlasting father
[12:33] that took on the form of Flesh Amen to
[12:36] to come down his son for that
[12:38] manifestation for
[12:39] Redemption but the end verse 7 of the
[12:42] increase of his government in peace
[12:44] there shall be no end upon the throne of
[12:46] David and upon his kingdom to order it
[12:48] so we know that we're looking forward to
[12:50] the coming Millennium when will come and
[12:52] establish the rulership the kingdom upon
[12:55] the Earth amen and and and he'll take
[12:57] the Throne of David David which was
[12:59] promised to him for he is the son of
[13:01] David the Eternal son of David amen
[13:04] that'll keep the Throne of David
[13:06] eternally praise God so I just want to
[13:09] set that all together so we have the
[13:12] right picture as we move forward because
[13:15] I it's going to take a little strange
[13:16] twist because of something brother
[13:18] Benham said not really strange but we're
[13:20] going to take it a little further
[13:22] Matthew let's turn together to Matthew
[13:23] chapter
[13:26] 19 Matthew 19
[13:29] and verse
[13:31] 4 amen as uh brother Ben had been saying
[13:36] the Abbott family is traveling home
[13:38] right now they should be at the airport
[13:40] right now and they board their flight I
[13:42] think here in an hour or two and fly
[13:43] home and it's been wonderful to have
[13:45] them with us for a few weeks and I
[13:47] really enjoyed the service on Sunday I I
[13:50] really I was blessed and I was
[13:52] encouraged and I began to understand
[13:55] more and I felt like as he was preaching
[13:56] on the lifting of the veil it was
[13:58] explaining my life and I feel like the
[14:00] veil was coming up even higher amen
[14:02] while he was preaching but there was
[14:03] some things he said there that really
[14:05] inspired me I had another thought I
[14:07] thought I'd go to today but I really
[14:08] want to move Amen in this thought uh as
[14:11] he opened that channel and open that
[14:13] door and you'll see how we connect it
[14:15] here in just a minute but Matthew
[14:18] 19:4
[14:20] says
[14:23] uh and he answered and said unto them
[14:26] have you not read that he which made
[14:28] them at the beginning made them male and
[14:30] female and said for this cause shall a
[14:32] man leave father and mother and shall
[14:35] cleave to his wife and they twain shall
[14:37] be one flesh wherefore they are no more
[14:40] Twain but one flesh what therefore God
[14:43] ha joined together let not man put us
[14:45] under amen so that's that's a strange
[14:49] verse to follow up the one we just
[14:52] read amen so let's go to Ephesians
[14:55] chapter 5 let's just support it with
[14:57] another strange verse
[14:59] amen Ephesians chapter
[15:04] 5 in Ephesians chapter
[15:07] 5 uh the Apostle Paul starts breaking
[15:10] down the relationship between Christ and
[15:11] his church and between a man and his
[15:13] wife and he comes to verse 30 Ephesians
[15:17] 5:30 and he says for we are members of
[15:20] his body of his flesh and of his bones
[15:26] amen I I don't don't know how more exact
[15:30] you can get in the
[15:31] language he's not you know with the
[15:35] Apostle Paul I think the reason
[15:37] sometimes I wonder why he uses some
[15:39] language that he uses because you know
[15:41] the scripture is not to just be read
[15:42] like you read in newspaper it's to be
[15:44] pondered over amen it is to let the Lord
[15:47] the Holy Spirit begin to soak it into
[15:49] the depths of your soul and bring a real
[15:51] Revelation we're not to read this like
[15:52] we read a newspaper we're not to read
[15:55] this book like we read other books and
[15:57] he says uh for for we are members of his
[15:59] body of his flesh and of his bones for
[16:02] this cause shall a man leave his father
[16:04] and mother and shall be joined into his
[16:05] wife and they too shall be one flesh
[16:07] going all the way back to the prophecy
[16:09] in Genesis that was given by Adam which
[16:11] Jesus reinstated and and and uh repeated
[16:14] in the Book of Matthew and then he says
[16:17] this is a great mystery but I speak
[16:19] concerning Christ and the church amen so
[16:22] now Paul is talking about this
[16:23] relationship between a man and a woman
[16:25] but he telling you this is a great
[16:27] mystery but it actually is reflecting
[16:29] Christ in his church and so we go back
[16:31] to verse 30 says for we are members of
[16:33] his body of his flesh and of his bones I
[16:37] mean the Apostle Paul could say we are
[16:38] just members of his body are we part of
[16:40] his body but he so wants to he so wants
[16:43] us to get how much we are part of his
[16:45] body that says we are part of his flesh
[16:48] and of his
[16:49] bones he's not saying we're like he say
[16:52] we are amen we're not in a way this is
[16:54] not in a way or this is not in a time
[16:56] he's actually making it an absolute
[16:59] picture that we are members of his body
[17:01] of his flesh and of his
[17:05] bones praise be to
[17:08] God and the reason that I wanted to tie
[17:10] that together with Isaiah 9:6 the
[17:12] government shall be upon his shoulders
[17:14] is because brother brandham does Amen we
[17:16] come now to spoken word is the Original
[17:18] Seed and he says no wonder the people
[17:20] were astonished at his Doctrine did you
[17:23] ever read that Mark 1:22 if you want to
[17:25] put it down the people was astonished at
[17:27] his Doctrine because he taught like
[17:29] somebody that had Authority he knowed
[17:31] what he was talking about the church now
[17:34] should have a double portion of the
[17:36] spirit for it is true like Elijah's
[17:39] garment that fell upon Elisha a double
[17:41] portion the same thing came from Jesus
[17:44] Christ now you say oh brother brandham
[17:45] you're talking about his church that's
[17:47] right that's his body because that's
[17:50] what the Bible teaches us that that the
[17:52] church is his body on Earth members of
[17:55] his body of his flesh and of his bones
[17:58] how much much more this is it's not an
[18:00] analogy it's a reality I believe that's
[18:02] why the Apostle Paul went to the Flesh
[18:04] and to the bones to try to show you the
[18:06] reality of this
[18:08] amen not just a metaphor re it's reality
[18:12] amen amen so now he says the church
[18:16] should have a double portion what did he
[18:18] do he took the the scripture by
[18:20] Authority and he didn't speak as the
[18:22] scribes said did in his day he didn't
[18:24] say well it could mean this or it
[18:26] couldn't mean that it might be this and
[18:27] it might be that but no he was the word
[18:30] amen so when he took the word he
[18:32] properly placed the word and he said a
[18:34] church should have a double portion of
[18:36] that amen why because the same spirit is
[18:38] in the church and he's brought in this
[18:41] day the perfect interpretation of the
[18:43] word so we're not afraid amen with the
[18:45] word that he gave us through a prophet
[18:47] we're not afraid to take that word and
[18:49] say this means this and that means that
[18:52] and this is the Fulfillment of that amen
[18:57] amen praise God that's his body and then
[19:00] he goes on to say isn't my wife part of
[19:02] my body and your wife part of your body
[19:04] flesh of your flesh and bone of your
[19:06] bone by holy Union is that right that's
[19:09] the reason a Christian shouldn't be
[19:10] married to a harlot SE that's right not
[19:12] right no sir because it breaks all the
[19:14] things of God you say oh now brother Bon
[19:17] wait a minute you talk about the spirit
[19:18] of Christ being upon the Bible said it
[19:21] would is that right Isaiah 9:6 he said
[19:25] unto us a child is born son is given
[19:28] name Shall be Called counsel Prince of
[19:29] Peace Mighty God Everlasting father and
[19:32] of his kingdom there shall be no end and
[19:34] the government shall be upon his
[19:37] what and the congregation says shoulder
[19:40] that's that's part of his body my that's
[19:44] his body isn't it his shoulders is his
[19:47] body where is the government on Earth at
[19:51] in his
[19:53] body amen he says Saints shall judge the
[19:57] Earth that's right
[19:58] amen Paul said I dare you to go to court
[20:00] with one another and not take before the
[20:02] church that's right Saints shall judge
[20:04] the Earth where is the government going
[20:06] to be upon upon the shoulders his body
[20:10] the government upon his shoulders that's
[20:12] a part of the body what is it his
[20:15] Earthly strength God's Earthly strength
[20:18] is his word made flesh in his body here
[20:22] on Earth bringing it to
[20:26] pass amen amen why and it's amazing he
[20:30] said the government shall be upon his
[20:32] shoulders amen and we know the whole
[20:34] reason because of the strength of the
[20:35] man and and the and the Key of David on
[20:37] his shoulder we there's so many types
[20:39] there but in this day amen God has built
[20:42] up a body and he's connected the body to
[20:44] the what to the head and where does the
[20:46] head sit the head come from Heaven which
[20:49] is the the word that was the back part
[20:51] of God's mind the mystery that God held
[20:53] the thought that he had amen he he
[20:55] brought the full restored word and the
[20:57] full revelation of the word came down in
[21:00] this day as the headship upon the church
[21:02] and where did that head come to rest it
[21:05] rested on the body on the shoulders
[21:09] amen so his government shall be upon his
[21:12] shoulders amen and and that's referring
[21:14] to Jesus Christ absolutely but Christ
[21:17] and his bride are
[21:19] one we've come to the age of Union
[21:24] Oneness restoration fullness we've come
[21:28] to this in full
[21:30] measure it's amazing that in Isaiah 9:7
[21:34] he goes to the throne of David amen
[21:36] because the Throne of David is his
[21:39] throne but he makes a promise to those
[21:42] in leoda he said and Leo DEA there's a
[21:45] promise to the Overcomer he that
[21:46] overcometh shall sit with me in my
[21:49] throne even as I have overcome and sit
[21:51] with my father in his throne amen and so
[21:54] he's going to take the Throne of David
[21:56] but those who overcome we're going to
[21:58] sit where on his throne as a joint Heir
[22:02] with him in Partnership as one Amen on
[22:06] what Throne the Throne of
[22:08] David So Isaiah 9 and6 it applies to
[22:11] Jesus Christ amen but Jesus Christ has a
[22:14] body on Earth in this day amen it's his
[22:17] bride body
[22:20] amen praise
[22:22] God so many scriptures that we want to
[22:25] look at but we're going to just refer to
[22:26] several of them because we know them
[22:27] well
[22:28] but 1 Corinthians 12:27 says now ye are
[22:31] the body of Christ and members in
[22:35] particular in fir in 1 Corinthians 12
[22:37] let's turn to this one together 1
[22:39] Corinthians
[22:40] 12 and
[22:45] 12 see as we talk about as brother Simon
[22:49] was saying about the lifting of the
[22:54] veil and the lifting of the veil he was
[22:56] talking about the Veil throughout the
[22:58] ceremony how it can create a little bit
[23:00] of a a a a blurred vision a little bit
[23:03] of a indistinction amen but as the veil
[23:06] lifts amen at the end of the ceremony
[23:09] amen then she can see clearly her
[23:11] bridegroom amen and he tied it together
[23:13] to now we see through a glass Darkly but
[23:15] then we shall see amen and we all know
[23:18] we as known will see face to face amen
[23:20] and and what what we've realized in this
[23:23] day and we've preached it many times
[23:24] because brother brandham showed us that
[23:26] when the bride recognized es what she is
[23:29] amen and and she is a further revelation
[23:32] of
[23:34] Christ she is his body she is his she is
[23:38] his body on this Earth she is a further
[23:41] manifestation a further working amen of
[23:43] Jesus Christ as he works through that
[23:46] body and and so as as it gets clearer
[23:50] and clearer I mean we live in we live in
[23:53] the age where it's getting clearer amen
[23:55] it has to get clearer because there's
[23:57] God to be something that comes to give
[23:59] us the confidence we need to take our
[24:01] position because it's absolutely
[24:03] astounding amen what the Bible is said
[24:06] the position that it's given the
[24:07] believer amen is absolutely astounding
[24:11] where it has placed us amen and through
[24:13] the denominational ages it's been such a
[24:15] hard thing to see it clearly amen what
[24:18] the what the body is and the Believers
[24:20] and who they are amen but in the end
[24:22] time God has sent a prophet to help
[24:25] break through the obscurity and all the
[24:27] cloudy and give us a Clear Vision of
[24:29] this word so that we can see who we are
[24:32] because what we've got to do is we have
[24:34] got to be him on this Earth amen we have
[24:37] to move into that position where we have
[24:39] the confidence amen we can't continually
[24:41] walk in uncertainty we cannot
[24:43] continually walk in this opaqueness this
[24:46] this obscurity this blurred vision where
[24:48] I'm not exactly sure who I am or what I
[24:51] am but we have to know by the word
[24:54] exactly who we
[24:55] are because the the task ahead of us is
[24:59] Monumental amen it's going to take
[25:01] somebody who has bold Faith to be able
[25:03] to take the word and move forward in the
[25:05] word
[25:06] amen and if you don't know which word
[25:09] applies to you and you don't know that
[25:11] that you have a right to it and if you
[25:13] don't know that the responsibility has
[25:14] been placed on you and I amen we'll
[25:16] always be holding back waiting for
[25:18] someone else or something else amen and
[25:21] and we've got to know in this hour
[25:23] exactly Who We Are by the
[25:26] scriptures Amen in 1 Corinthians
[25:30] 12:
[25:33] 12 says for as the body is one and hath
[25:37] many members and all the members of that
[25:39] one body being many are one body so also
[25:44] is
[25:45] Christ I love this language amen I love
[25:48] how exact the Bible is he did not say
[25:51] this is how Christ is or this is like
[25:54] Christ or this is similar to
[25:56] Christ
[25:58] he's saying as our body is made up of
[26:01] many different
[26:03] members as the body is one and has many
[26:06] members and all the members of that one
[26:08] body being many are one body so also is
[26:13] Christ so then what is Christ Christ is
[26:16] a many membered
[26:19] body amen and by faith I happen to
[26:22] believe I'm one of those members so what
[26:24] am I part of Amen I can never be all of
[26:27] it in myself that's Antichrist but to
[26:29] make me not part of it is also
[26:33] Antichrist you can get off on one side
[26:36] or you can get off on the other brother
[26:37] Brenham said amen to make me the person
[26:40] of Jesus Christ would be Antichrist amen
[26:42] but to say I'm a messiah or I'm part of
[26:45] it he said now that would be absolutely
[26:47] the
[26:49] truth so you have to see as the body is
[26:52] one but many members and all those
[26:54] members make up one body so all also is
[26:58] Christ if I want to know what Christ is
[27:01] according to the Apostle Paul Christ is
[27:03] a many membered
[27:06] body
[27:09] amen for by one Spirit we all baptized
[27:12] into one body whether we be Jews or
[27:14] Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and
[27:16] have been all made to drink unto that
[27:17] one spirit for the body is not one
[27:20] member but many amen oh praise be unto
[27:24] God you
[27:26] know
[27:28] it's getting to the place where we have
[27:31] to it's becoming so clear it's becoming
[27:33] shocking yeah
[27:35] amen but I believe
[27:37] it like I know it's true but I think
[27:41] sometimes I shouldn't I shouldn't
[27:43] believe this like I shouldn't be able to
[27:45] say that I shouldn't be able to believe
[27:48] that about myself because I know what I
[27:50] was I know where I've come from I know
[27:52] I'm talking Earthly Journey now anyways
[27:54] cuz I I have another Revelation that
[27:56] precedes this one amen
[27:58] but just in the natural we know what we
[28:00] are we know where we've been we know
[28:01] what we've done and it seems I shouldn't
[28:03] be able to say these things I shouldn't
[28:06] be able to believe these things about
[28:08] myself but I can't help it I believe it
[28:10] when I read it in the word I believe
[28:12] it's true and I believe I'm part of
[28:16] it that's why it's becoming
[28:19] shocking that's why you know get to the
[28:22] place where uh uh we actually become
[28:25] Christ to the world Amen
[28:28] and that's not a farfetched statement
[28:30] that's
[28:33] biblical do you know that when I mean
[28:37] doesn't you take a family you take any
[28:39] family believing family when they go
[28:42] into a restaurant and they go in
[28:44] together and they're in Harmony and
[28:46] unity and they're dressed right and the
[28:48] ladies look like ladies and the men look
[28:50] like gentlemen and and they treat each
[28:52] other good and they all sit around the
[28:53] table and they bow their heads and pray
[28:55] and the parents are conversing with the
[28:57] children and children with the parents
[28:58] they're not all on cell phones they're
[29:00] not being smart elic they're not
[29:01] snipping at one another mom's not
[29:03] yelling at her children because she's
[29:05] got interrupted from her popping bubble
[29:09] game or her Facebook whatever
[29:13] and you understand when somebody sees
[29:17] that picture of a believing family do
[29:19] you know what they just saw they just
[29:21] saw
[29:22] Christ why because it's the word made
[29:26] flesh made manif
[29:27] in that family living as a family unit
[29:30] as a dad in headship a mother in
[29:32] submission he gen caring for her her
[29:34] reverencing him them nurturing and
[29:36] bringing up the children what is it it's
[29:38] the actual Bible in
[29:41] flesh it's the scriptures amen it's the
[29:44] scriptures of how to raise your children
[29:45] it's the scriptures of how to treat each
[29:47] other it's the scriptures of how to
[29:49] conduct yourself it's the scriptures of
[29:50] how to dress and those scriptures took
[29:54] on flash and what those people saw was
[29:57] they saw Jesus Christ sitting around
[29:59] that table because Christ is the
[30:01] anointed one the anointed word for the
[30:04] day sometimes we make it so diff it's
[30:06] not difficult it's the life that you're
[30:08] living it's the Bible that you're
[30:10] reading it's the word that you've
[30:11] received now anointed by the spirit
[30:13] coming back out and that is Christ to
[30:16] the
[30:19] world let's go to Revelations chapter
[30:26] 1
[30:32] Revelation chapter
[30:36] 1 we know John on the aisle of patmas
[30:39] he's going to get the the the vision
[30:42] here of the seven Church
[30:44] ages I'm going to skip down uh well
[30:48] let's go to verse
[30:49] n and I John who also am your brother
[30:51] and companion in Tribulation and in
[30:53] Kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was
[30:55] in the aisle that is called patmas for
[30:57] the the word of God and for the
[30:58] testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the
[31:00] spirit on the Lord's day and I heard
[31:02] behind me a great voice as of a
[31:05] trumpet and it's skip verse 12 and I
[31:07] turned to see the voice that spake with
[31:09] me and being turned I saw seven golden
[31:13] candlesticks and in the midst that means
[31:15] in the middle in the middle of the seven
[31:17] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[31:19] man I want you to notice the phrase like
[31:22] unto the son of man and keep that in
[31:24] your mind one like unto the son of man
[31:26] clo with a garment down to the foot and
[31:28] gird about the paps with a golden girdle
[31:31] his head and his hairs were white like
[31:33] wool as white as snow and his eyes were
[31:35] as a flame of fire and his feet like
[31:37] undefined brass as if they were burned
[31:39] in a furnace and his voice as the sound
[31:42] of many Waters and he had in his right
[31:44] hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth
[31:46] went a sharp two-edged sword and his
[31:48] countenance was as the sun shining and
[31:51] his
[31:53] strength amen so we we want to go back
[31:58] um to verse 13 and focus on in the midst
[32:02] of the seven candlesticks in the middle
[32:03] the seven candlesticks represent the
[32:05] seven Church
[32:06] ages and in the midst throughout the
[32:09] middle of the seven Church ages is one
[32:12] like unto the son of man amen and we'll
[32:16] look at what the prophet of God tells us
[32:18] all the way back in the message the
[32:19] seven Church ages from 1954 he has this
[32:23] to say about these scriptures he's
[32:24] breaking them down he said now that's
[32:26] the Bible that's what the spirit said
[32:28] candlesticks all right now 13th verse in
[32:30] the midst of the seven golden
[32:31] candlesticks one like the son of man who
[32:34] what one like him who was this his
[32:40] bride one like him watch How It Was
[32:43] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[32:45] the Holiness of Jesus Christ covering
[32:47] her was washed us from our sins with his
[32:50] own blood all right GED about the paps
[32:52] not a man a woman paps means breast in
[32:55] the
[32:56] Bible G about the paths with a golden
[32:58] girdle the gospel that had the power and
[33:01] glory of God over the body of Christ Oh
[33:03] what a beautiful picture we got here
[33:05] under consideration look at here down to
[33:07] the foot and G about the pth with a
[33:09] golden girdle his head and his hairs was
[33:11] white as wool white as snow
[33:13] righteousness Holiness white speaks of
[33:16] and his eyes like flames of fire looks
[33:18] right through us don't try to hide from
[33:20] him he knows who you are where you are
[33:22] and what you've done yes sir he sees
[33:25] everything we got just a few minutes
[33:27] left to to get to this other Church age
[33:29] if we can and his feet were like fine
[33:31] brass brass is always
[33:34] judgment and he goes down he I'm going
[33:36] to skip down this paragraph he says and
[33:37] his feet was like fine brass as if they
[33:39] had been burned in a fire that's all the
[33:41] draws taken out and his he had a voice
[33:44] the voice of many Waters watch it's the
[33:47] church speaking to him now the voice of
[33:50] many Waters Waters Revelation 17:15 said
[33:53] the waters means thickness and
[33:54] multitudes of people now his voice or
[33:57] his being that was standing there
[33:58] looking like this Christ in his church
[34:02] as the bride and Christ being one like
[34:04] husband and wife is one the church in
[34:06] Christ being molded together with one
[34:08] person the same Holy Spirit and that's
[34:10] the things that Christ did the church
[34:12] does also do you see it that beautiful
[34:15] Church there in Holiness and power and
[34:17] Majesty with seeing visions signs
[34:19] wonders everything just like he did here
[34:21] it is on Earth giving all all praise to
[34:24] God saying I can do any nothing except
[34:27] the father shows me but he shows me and
[34:30] here it is and they come see these
[34:32] things got to take place now Christ
[34:35] molded into one The Voice many Waters
[34:38] many people not just the one it was the
[34:40] whole church the seven churches molded
[34:42] together as one great Ransom body of the
[34:44] Lord the Methodist the Baptist the
[34:46] Presbyterian all that's born again with
[34:48] the Holy Ghost speaking with the power
[34:50] of God that's the body that's the body
[34:53] and yet had in his right hand everything
[34:55] in the Bible has meaning in his right
[34:57] hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth
[35:00] goeth a sharp two-edged sword and his
[35:01] countenance was like unto the sun
[35:03] shining in his strength and out of his
[35:05] mouth goes the sharp two two-edged sword
[35:08] out of the mouth of this standing there
[35:10] Christ and the church as
[35:12] one brother M now takes us back uh here
[35:16] to Revelation chap 1 and he said this is
[35:19] Christ in his bride amen this is Christ
[35:22] in the church one like unto the son of
[35:25] man amen but it's Christ in his church
[35:28] and we see it culminated in this day in
[35:30] the picture of Christ in the formation
[35:32] of his
[35:34] bride she on Earth is representing all
[35:37] seven Church ages coming to the Head
[35:40] amen we know that when brother Bram
[35:43] preached Christ as the mystery of God
[35:44] revealed he goes to Colossians chapter 1
[35:47] and he preaches that that that all
[35:49] important verse that we've quoted over
[35:50] and over and will quote over and over
[35:53] and over because it's the day we live in
[35:55] for this to be in manifestation but in
[35:57] Colossians 1:26 he said even the mystery
[36:00] which has been hid from ages and from
[36:01] Generations but now is made manifest to
[36:04] his Saints to whom God would make known
[36:06] what is the riches of the glory of this
[36:08] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[36:10] Christ in you the hope of
[36:13] glory where is Christ to be where is
[36:16] this great mystery among the Gentiles
[36:17] it's Christ in you the hope of glory
[36:20] what are you you are a member a member
[36:22] of what a member of the body what body
[36:25] you can say church and you can use all
[36:26] kinds of terms but really it's the
[36:28] member of the body of
[36:32] Christ
[36:34] amen and Christ is the mystery of God
[36:36] revealed the prophet says identified oh
[36:38] the devil is howling about this the
[36:40] manifested truth of the promise of the
[36:42] word and her
[36:44] alone they don't have this the answer
[36:46] when Jesus came why didn't those
[36:48] Pharisees he said if I cast out Devils
[36:51] by the Finger of God who do you cast
[36:52] them out by see he stood alone and his
[36:55] church stands alone
[36:57] she is not hooked with nothing but he
[36:59] was identified by God being the body
[37:02] that God dwelt in and the church is
[37:04] identified by his body doing the same
[37:07] thing she is his
[37:11] body the manifested truth of his
[37:14] promised word for the last day and she
[37:16] and she alone stands by it that's why
[37:19] the devil is howling these great
[37:20] organizations to set up something to
[37:22] close her up they'll never do it she'll
[37:24] be taken up not closed up she is now
[37:27] risen and by the power of the Vindicated
[37:30] word promised to her hallelujah what
[37:32] does he mean she is now risen by what by
[37:35] the power of the Vindicated word
[37:37] promised to her she is now risen why
[37:39] because she's seated in Heavenly places
[37:41] in Christ Jesus but she's now risen by
[37:43] the promised word in this day that
[37:45] raised us out of a leody Dean condition
[37:48] raised us up out of Darkness out of
[37:51] misery out of wretchedness out of
[37:52] nakedness out of the apostasy of the
[37:54] lean Church age and brought brought us
[37:56] into his very Presence by the promised
[38:00] word for us amen why did he bring us
[38:02] into his presence so we can say we've
[38:03] come into His presence no he came to
[38:05] unite with us so the headship could come
[38:07] down upon the body so that the
[38:09] government could pee upon his shoulders
[38:11] upon Earth and it could manifest his
[38:14] kingdom in
[38:17] her that's why this came in this hour
[38:21] not so we can say I can believe the
[38:22] message amen we're supposed to believe
[38:24] the message not so we can recognize God
[38:25] sent a prophet supposed to recognize but
[38:28] the whole thing came together to restore
[38:30] a Unity between God and man to restore
[38:33] the the unity between Christ and his
[38:35] bride Amen to bring the invisible Union
[38:37] to bring the wedding to bring the
[38:39] marriage amen so why so that now he's
[38:42] manifesting himself in her on the
[38:47] earth when he was standing there in
[38:50] Revelation 1 remember he was gir about
[38:54] the paps with a golden girdle
[38:58] brother B starts to talk about this and
[39:00] and uh he gets to this in the message
[39:04] the papis
[39:07] vision and I'm going to stop I'm not
[39:09] going to go there yet I'm going to go
[39:11] there next I want to slow down let's go
[39:13] to John
[39:19] 14 John
[39:25] 14
[39:27] you know I love to go to the scriptures
[39:29] and I love to go to them again and again
[39:31] and
[39:34] again cuz as Paul says is you not
[39:37] believe cunningly devised fables no
[39:40] no you not believe something that some
[39:44] Superstition or something somebody
[39:45] picked
[39:47] up but what we're actually believing is
[39:51] what Paul taught what the apostles
[39:52] taught what Jesus Christ taught we're
[39:54] actually believing the word
[39:56] amen amen it's been held in obscurity
[40:00] and it's been been revealed partially
[40:02] and believed partially through seven
[40:04] Church ages but we've come to the age
[40:06] where it's not to be seen partially it's
[40:08] not to be believed partially but it's to
[40:10] be believed in the fullness of its power
[40:13] and that Faith should manifest into a
[40:15] manifested life
[40:18] amen so that these scriptures become
[40:22] life in John
[40:25] 14:7
[40:27] and John
[40:28] 14:7 says if you had known me you should
[40:32] have known my father also and from hence
[40:35] forth you know him and have seen him
[40:38] Philip sayi un the Lord show us the
[40:40] father and it suffices us Jesus already

[41:24] the one in me he's the one doing the
[41:25] works me he's the one fulfilling the
[41:27] word in me how can you ask me to show
[41:29] you the father I've been showing you the
[41:34] father verse 10 believest thou not that
[41:37] I am in the father and the father in me
[41:40] the words that I speak unto you I speak
[41:41] not of myself but the father that
[41:43] dwelleth in me he doeth The Works amen
[41:47] oh I I just love that amen he says you
[41:51] know uh he says now you've seen the
[41:55] father
[41:57] Philip says um show him to
[42:01] us you know when we walk through this
[42:03] world not of our own thinking but we've
[42:05] surrendered our thinking to the word and
[42:07] we walk in this world obedient to the
[42:11] word and our actions and our conduct
[42:14] amen and the fact that we we get up on
[42:17] Sunday morning and all our neighbors see
[42:19] us come out with nice clothes on going
[42:22] to they know you're going to church they
[42:23] see your Bible they see the way you're

[42:32] conduct yourself the way we act at work
[42:34] the way we act at school the way we act
[42:35] when we're out amen the conversations we
[42:38] have everything we do when it's
[42:40] structured by the word amen it's no
[42:43] longer me but it's Christ in me amen by
[42:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's now
[42:47] fleshing out his word in my flesh and
[42:50] now amen what are we doing we're showing
[42:54] Christ am we're showing Christ to the
[42:57] people amen and it's saying you could
[42:59] you could say Amen show me Christ and
[43:01] been like I've been showing him to you
[43:03] all along have you not been noticing
[43:06] amen this is Christ this is the word
[43:08] this is the anointed word on display
[43:11] right before your eyes and you say I
[43:13] want to see Christ you're seeing Christ
[43:16] amen you're seeing the word on display
[43:19] day in and day out this is why the life
[43:21] we livees matters so much amen we can't
[43:24] just go out and continue living our life
[43:27] according to our thinking that's why we
[43:28] die to ourselves and die to our thinking
[43:31] amen that's why when when Simon was
[43:33] talking about the union that takes place
[43:35] in a marriage amen when that turn when
[43:37] they turn around and walk out that girl
[43:40] now has a new identification she has a
[43:42] new name and now her actions amen
[43:46] reflect on her
[43:48] headship which is her husband now
[43:51] because brother benam told us amen that
[43:53] the kind of woman that a man choose will
[43:55] show what character character he has
[43:56] inside and what he's thinking of his
[43:58] future home what he is on inside is
[44:00] reflected so as she goes out bearing his
[44:03] name now Goes Forth as Mrs Jesus Christ
[44:06] amen she's going out walking back out of
[44:09] the ceremony bearing his name and
[44:12] displaying his
[44:14] name in female form Amen to the
[44:20] world and they can get an honest opinion
[44:23] of that
[44:24] man come on now by looking at the woman
[44:27] who's bearing his
[44:30] name that's why the whole scripture amen
[44:34] of headp and and submission is so
[44:36] important because we as Believers if we
[44:38] ruin this picture amen and a woman will
[44:40] not come under her husband's headship
[44:42] and she wants to dictate and run the
[44:44] home you get everything flipped upside
[44:45] down and now you're not showing Christ
[44:47] to the world
[44:49] Amen because he's not bearing her name
[44:51] she's bearing his
[44:53] name amen
[44:56] so now
[44:58] Jesus came in his father's
[45:02] name is that
[45:04] right he was bearing his father's name
[45:07] and what name did the father take he had
[45:09] many titles but he only took one Earthly
[45:11] name when he came in flesh he took the
[45:12] name Jesus Christ
[45:14] amen and he was bearing his father's
[45:17] name and he was showing the father to
[45:19] the people because it was the father's
[45:20] life inside of him he was living the
[45:23] Commandments of of the Lord he was
[45:26] living out the Commandments of the word
[45:27] the Commandments of his father and so
[45:29] doing that he was showing the
[45:33] father
[45:35] Amen brother B tells us the word tells
[45:37] us the scripture tells us God is the
[45:40] word Christ is the anointed word the
[45:43] word for our day Christ is the word God
[45:45] is the word and he said and we are the
[45:48] word
[45:50] amen so we become the word as we let the
[45:53] word flow through
[45:54] usen and so as that life in US amen
[45:58] changes our life and brings our life
[46:01] subject to his life and begins to live
[46:03] his life through our life amen now we're
[46:05] displaying to the world not our life
[46:08] we're displaying to the world his life
[46:10] because before I came to him I had a
[46:12] different thing I projected to the world
[46:14] I projected all kinds of selfishness and
[46:16] foolish Notions and childishness and and
[46:19] and and self-love and all kinds of
[46:21] lewdness and crudeness and all these
[46:23] things I projected that was me amen but
[46:26] there was come a time that I had to die
[46:28] to me and I had to take his name and now
[46:30] he has to live in me and he's projecting
[46:32] something totally different he's
[46:34] projecting submission amen surrender
[46:36] love and harmony with others he's he's
[46:38] projecting something completely
[46:41] different and now we're showing him to
[46:43] the
[46:45] world all that God was he poured into
[46:48] Christ all that Christ was he poured
[46:50] into the
[46:53] church verse 18
[46:56] John
[46:58] 14:18 this is the same chapter this is
[47:01] the same discourse that he just talked
[47:03] about uh you've seen the father and
[47:05] Philip askes show us the father he's in
[47:07] the same conversation with his disciples
[47:10] in verse 18 he says I will not leave you
[47:12] comfortless I will come to you he's
[47:15] speaking of the comforter coming he's
[47:17] speaking of the Holy Ghost coming the
[47:18] spirit of God but what's he saying he's
[47:20] making it personal he's not just saying
[47:22] now I will send you the Comfort he's
[47:24] saying no I will come to you the
[47:26] comforter that he sends is he himself
[47:29] am I will not leave you comfortless I
[47:31] will come to you yet a little while and
[47:34] the world seeth me no more but ye see me
[47:36] because I live ye shall live also amen
[47:40] at that day you shall know that I am in
[47:42] the father and ye in me and I in
[47:46] you now show us Christ
[47:51] amen amen when brother Brenham came to
[47:54] this scripture says at that day he said
[47:57] that's this day amen at that day you
[48:01] shall know that I am in the father and
[48:03] ye in me and I in you so where is Christ
[48:07] he's in his body that's this
[48:12] day now let's look at verse uh
[48:17] 21 same same portion of scripture here
[48:21] says he that hath my Commandments and
[48:24] keepeth them he is that loveth me and he
[48:27] that loveth me shall be loved to my
[48:28] father and I will love him and will
[48:30] manifest myself to him Judas saith unto
[48:33] him not as scariot Lord how is it that
[48:35] thou wil manifest thyself unto us and
[48:38] not unto the world Jesus answered and
[48:40] said unto him if a man love me he will
[48:43] keep my words and my father will love
[48:45] him and we will come unto him and make
[48:48] our Abode with
[48:51] him how are you going to reveal yourself
[48:53] to us and not the world
[48:56] how is this going to be a private
[48:57] Revelation how will you reveal yourself
[49:01] how will you come to me how will you
[49:02] reveal yourself to me and not to the
[49:04] world he brother Jesus makes it so
[49:06] simple he says he that keepeth my
[49:09] Commandments have my Commandments to
[49:10] keep them he it is that loveth me and he
[49:12] that loveth me shall be loved to my
[49:14] father and I will love him manifest
[49:16] myself to him then he asked the question
[49:18] and Jesus answered if a man love me he
[49:20] will keep my words and my father will
[49:22] love him and
[49:24] we
[49:26] so where's the father same place Christ
[49:30] is and we will come unto him and make
[49:33] our Abode with him amen where's he at in
[49:38] his body let's go to First
[49:43] John 1 John chapter
[49:54] 4 1 John chapter
[50:00] 4 verse
[50:02] one said beloved believeth not every
[50:04] Spirit but try the spirits whether they
[50:06] are of God because many false prophets
[50:08] are gone out into the world hereby know
[50:11] you the spirit of God every spirit that
[50:13] confesses that Jesus Christ is come in
[50:17] the flesh is of
[50:20] God and every spirit that confesses not
[50:23] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[50:26] is not of God and this is that Spirit of
[50:30] antichrist where if you have heard that
[50:31] it should come and even now already is
[50:34] it in the world so the Antichrist
[50:37] spirit amen is not just some man the
[50:42] Antichrist spirit will be incarnated in
[50:44] a man at some point but the Antichrist
[50:47] spirit is the spirit that resist the
[50:49] truth that Jesus Christ is come in
[50:52] flesh is currently present tense come in
[50:55] the flesh that's the Antichrist
[50:58] spirit and that's why the world is full
[51:00] of the Antichrist spirit and religion is
[51:02] full of the Antichrist Spirit looking
[51:05] for an antichrist to come and not
[51:07] realizing they're right I'm in the
[51:08] Antichrist and fleshing out the
[51:10] Antichrist because the Antichrist spirit
[51:12] is denying that Jesus Christ is come in
[51:15] the flesh the Antichrist spirit is
[51:16] denying that Christ is here in Bride
[51:21] form that's an antichrist
[51:24] spirit
[51:27] so that that Spirit we
[51:32] resist and now we can judge that spirit
[51:35] because it denies the truth of Christ
[51:38] why is it an antichrist because it's
[51:40] against
[51:42] Christ what Christ Is it
[51:45] against this scripture tells us it's not
[51:48] against the Christ that was nailed to
[51:50] the cross at
[51:51] Calvary this Antichrist spirit is
[51:54] against Christ what makes it against
[51:56] Christ it's against the present tense
[51:58] place of
[51:59] Christ and that's what makes it
[52:01] Antichrist it's not against what Christ
[52:03] did in the past it's you can tell the
[52:06] Antichrist spirit because it's against
[52:07] what Christ is doing
[52:09] now
[52:12] right
[52:14] amen so now we we've went through all of
[52:17] that now I want to back up and I want to
[52:20] start talking back about Revelation
[52:22] chapter 1 again now he he was one in the
[52:25] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[52:26] is one like unto the son of man and he's
[52:29] G about the paths amen and brother B's
[52:31] going to refer to this and when he
[52:33] preaches the patmas vision in 1960 so
[52:36] now let's watch him just a little
[52:37] further as we take the rest of the 13th
[52:40] verse and in the midst that's the middle
[52:42] of the golden candlesticks one like the
[52:44] son of man clothed with a garment down
[52:46] to the foot and gir about the paps with
[52:47] a golden girdle now here's more proof
[52:51] that this Doctrine is right about it
[52:52] being the Lord's
[52:54] day this this picture emerges in the
[52:56] Lord's day
[52:58] amen did you notice him he was not a
[53:01] priest during this time neither was he a
[53:03] king he was a judge so he was in between
[53:07] priest and King
[53:12] amen he was in between mediation and the
[53:15] Throne of David amen maybe he had come
[53:19] as the white wigged one the Supreme
[53:21] deity the judge of all heavens and
[53:23] earth this is the Lord Lord's
[53:26] day
[53:30] amen see do you notice he's not a priest
[53:32] during this time neither is he a king he
[53:34] was a judge notice a priest a high
[53:36] priest then he went into the sanctuary
[53:38] or went in to minister to service he
[53:40] tied himself around the waist tying his
[53:42] girdle around the waist meant that he
[53:44] was serving never tied it over his
[53:46] shoulder but here he comes out walking
[53:48] out with the girdle tied around the top
[53:51] with a sash over his shoulder girded
[53:54] about the paths the breast with a golden
[53:56] girdle gted up high what is it an
[53:59] attorney a judge the judge with the sash
[54:02] over his shoulder where's it at now over
[54:04] the shoulder where's the shoulder it's
[54:06] part of the body where's the body it's
[54:08] on Earth yeah where did the headship
[54:11] come amen when he come as the white
[54:13] wigged one the judge of all heavens and
[54:15] earth when he comes as judge he that
[54:18] that headship came to sit where it came
[54:20] to sit upon the body and now the picture
[54:23] in Revelation one brother said is the
[54:25] Lord's day amen between priest and
[54:28] between
[54:30] King
[54:33] amen sash over his shoulder gted up here
[54:36] not down a priest shows he wasn't in his
[54:39] priesthood now John went all the way
[54:41] over into the Lord's day and saw him
[54:42] coming as judge you believe he's a judge
[54:45] let's just read John 5:22 right quick
[54:48] we'll see whether he's judged or not
[54:49] John 5:22 for the father judges no man
[54:51] but has committed all judgment unto the
[54:54] son amen so his throne will be a throne
[54:56] of
[54:57] judgment the question is who sits on the
[54:59] throne with him amen the one who is one
[55:03] flesh the one who is member of his body
[55:06] of his flesh and of his bones a joint
[55:09] air United together sitting on his
[55:10] throne know you not that you shall judge
[55:13] the
[55:14] world it's only fitting that as he
[55:17] merges into his church he merges in the
[55:20] in the end time in the Lord's day as a
[55:22] judg with the girdle heard about the
[55:25] paps the breast amen with the sash over
[55:28] his
[55:29] [Music]
[55:30] shoulders amen
[55:33] amen that's right he is the judge the
[55:36] Supreme judge and John knows that he
[55:38] wasn't in the day of his prophecy as a
[55:39] prophet neither was he Plum out in the
[55:41] days of his kingship but he was in the
[55:43] day of the Lord as a judge so here he is
[55:46] in between two dispensations priest and
[55:49] King comes as a
[55:51] judge you know we're in the time of
[55:54] judgment yes
[55:55] amen do you know that we're we're we're
[55:58] we're currently under the dispensation
[56:01] of the six seal it's not open in full
[56:04] Fury it can't as long as the bride's
[56:06] here amen CU as long as the spirit's
[56:08] here is holding back the full
[56:10] wrath
[56:12] amen but we're in that period of the
[56:14] judgments of God it's why brother B
[56:17] after he preached the seals took a stone
[56:18] and threw it in the air amen it started
[56:20] Ro he said judgment striking the West
[56:22] Coast there's a series of judgments
[56:24] that's been striking and Rippling
[56:25] through the Earth ever since there's
[56:26] wars and rumors of wars and pestilence
[56:28] and fearful sights and all kinds of the
[56:30] things that are promised to happen are
[56:32] here but it can't fully unleash as long
[56:34] as the bride's
[56:36] here and it's not just because of your
[56:39] flesh it's because what you represent
[56:41] because the life of God is in you the
[56:43] holy spirit is
[56:45] here but he who now lth will let until
[56:48] he be taken out of the
[56:51] way
[56:53] amen he goes on in the church age book
[56:56] he goes through the same section patmas
[56:58] Vision in the church age book now and
[57:00] listen to what he says he quotes the
[57:02] same scripture Revelation 13 He says
[57:04] there he stands one like unto the son of
[57:06] man as the jewel is beautified by the
[57:09] mounting of the ring so is he glorified
[57:13] in the midst of the
[57:14] churches where's he at he's in his
[57:17] church amen that's where this jewel
[57:20] is it is the Lord's day for John sees
[57:23] him standing not as a priest but is the
[57:25] coming coming judge the golden girdle is
[57:27] no longer gird around the waist where
[57:28] the priest must wear it as the minister
[57:30] to God and the holiest place but is now
[57:32] around his shoulders for he is not now
[57:34] the priest but the
[57:39] judge
[57:41] amen it's interesting that in this time
[57:44] I want to I want to finish these last
[57:46] few minutes by just talking about in
[57:49] this time where we're in between priest
[57:52] and
[57:53] King we've had Son of God we have son of
[57:56] man Son of God and then we have son of
[57:59] David but injected between Son of God
[58:02] and Son of David is son of man
[58:06] again and that's the prophetic and we
[58:09] know God we saw the son of man Ministry
[58:12] we saw a son of man revealing the son of
[58:14] man that was Jesus Christ the son of man
[58:17] had returned and was working through a
[58:19] son of man that Prophet amen but that
[58:22] son of man didn't leave the Earth when
[58:24] the prophet left the Earth he because
[58:26] that that a son of man was there to
[58:28] unite The Head and the body together in
[58:30] the wedding Amen to do what to reproduce
[58:33] the son of man again so now that
[58:36] dispensation is in Bride
[58:39] form in between Son of God and Son of
[58:42] David in between priest and judge or and
[58:46] King Amen in the time of Judge and you
[58:50] say then then all of a sudden we have to
[58:52] think oh my goodness you think now now
[58:54] if that's the case if there's a
[58:56] unification here if the white wigged one
[58:59] has descended and come down the Supreme
[59:01] judge of all Heaven and Earth looking
[59:02] down with eyes of judgment and he's come
[59:04] to unite with the body and now the sash
[59:06] is about the girdles about the breast
[59:08] and sash over the shoulders we see this
[59:10] dispensational change we say if we're in
[59:12] judgment is there no more Mercy on
[59:16] that's always the
[59:18] question but I'll tell you this there's
[59:21] only one person that can ever extend
[59:23] Mercy the only person in all of our
[59:26] governments that can extend Mercy is the
[59:29] judge the only place to get Mercy is at
[59:33] the Judgment seat you don't get Mercy
[59:35] anywhere else but at the Judgment seat
[59:37] because the Judgment seat is The Mercy
[59:40] Seat and then the Judgment seat becomes
[59:42] The Mercy Seat when when the blood which
[59:45] is the life is upon the Judgment seat it
[59:48] becomes a mercy seat so what did the
[59:50] blood represent it represented the life
[59:52] what is the life the life is the life of
[59:54] Jesus Christ where is it it's in the
[59:56] church it's upon the Judgment seat
[59:59] making it a mercy seat cuz you can only
[1:00:01] get Mercy at a judgment
[1:00:04] seat if you say hey I've committed this
[1:00:07] crime and I've done this and I've done
[1:00:08] that you've got to go before some judge
[1:00:11] somewhere to get acquitted of that to
[1:00:13] have mercy there's got to be somebody
[1:00:15] that'll be that has the right to judge
[1:00:17] and that person with the right to judge
[1:00:20] is the only one that has the right to
[1:00:21] give
[1:00:22] Mercy the police officer can't give you
[1:00:25] Mercy the one who arrested you the one
[1:00:27] who keeps you in jail none of them can
[1:00:28] give you Mercy only at the Judgment seat
[1:00:31] can you find
[1:00:34] Mercy praise God
[1:00:37] Amen why did he move from priesthood and
[1:00:40] the judge because he's no longer
[1:00:42] covering for the sins of ignorance
[1:00:44] through the church ages he's brought the
[1:00:45] fullness of the word now the fullness of
[1:00:48] the word is available he's not covering
[1:00:50] for sins of ignorance now he's now he's
[1:00:53] here as a judge but he's still offering
[1:00:55] Mercy to those who can come to
[1:00:57] [Music]
[1:01:01] it where's he at the head and the body
[1:01:05] has United in between priest and
[1:01:11] King I'm happy to be here this
[1:01:15] day you know what I don't see myself on
[1:01:20] Earth I take this
[1:01:22] back I was going to say I don't see
[1:01:24] myself on Earth as a judge but I
[1:01:27] do because if you want to give Mercy you
[1:01:29] have to be the
[1:01:32] judge that's right but I don't see
[1:01:35] myself here for condemnation I see
[1:01:37] myself here for
[1:01:38] Mercy I see my role that I'm playing out
[1:01:41] here not condemnation but Mercy but when
[1:01:43] mercy is
[1:01:46] spurned what happens when mercy is
[1:01:48] spurned when mercy spurn there's nothing
[1:01:50] left but
[1:01:51] judgment so I don't see my existence I'm
[1:01:54] not walking around saying lightning
[1:01:56] bolts lightning bolts fire and brimstone
[1:01:58] I don't see myself in my role that's not
[1:02:01] what I'm here for I'm here because
[1:02:03] there's an opportunity while Christ is
[1:02:05] here while the blood is here while life
[1:02:08] is here before the full unleashing of
[1:02:10] the six steel and the tribulation period
[1:02:12] when there's no change in your condition
[1:02:14] while I'm here while we we are present
[1:02:17] while the spirit of God is here in me I
[1:02:19] see myself as a place of Mercy not a
[1:02:22] place of judgment amen I shouldn't say
[1:02:24] not a place of judgment it is a place of
[1:02:26] judgment not a place of

[1:05:29] you listened to Paul's word believed it
[1:05:31] heed it you were reconciled to God what
[1:05:34] happened if you rejected Paul's
[1:05:38] word when Paul and Barnabas amen when
[1:05:41] they went down into a city they preached
[1:05:43] and they were the whole city was hearing
[1:05:45] them gladly amen but then all of a
[1:05:47] sudden amen the Jews stirred up they
[1:05:49] made counsel and stirred up the the Jews
[1:05:51] and The Devout Gentile women and they
[1:05:53] came against him and he says it's meat
[1:05:56] it's proper amen that the gospel should
[1:05:58] have been first preached to you seeing
[1:05:59] that you're Jews but seeing that you
[1:06:02] count yourselves Unworthy of everlasting
[1:06:04] life what is Paul Paul is standing there
[1:06:08] he is a judgment seat and a mercy
[1:06:11] seats not because of his flesh because
[1:06:14] he has the gospel he has the word amen
[1:06:18] Paul had the word for his
[1:06:21] day he had the word of reconciliation he
[1:06:24] had the ministry of reconciliation he
[1:06:26] was beseeching them as if he was God he
[1:06:29] was in Christ
[1:06:31] dead and when they rejected that right
[1:06:35] they rejected God
[1:06:38] Amen when mercy is
[1:06:41] spurned there's nothing left but
[1:06:47] condemnation we are not here to
[1:06:51] condemn Jesus didn't come to condemn the
[1:06:55] world but that the world through him
[1:06:57] might be
[1:06:59] saved but he said he that believeth not
[1:07:01] is condemned already yeah they're
[1:07:04] already condemned they were already
[1:07:07] condemned so he didn't come to condemn
[1:07:10] because they're already
[1:07:12] condemned this world is already
[1:07:14] condemned friends it's going to
[1:07:17] burn not because I said so because it's
[1:07:21] already
[1:07:22] destined they've already rejected the
[1:07:24] gospel they've already turned their back
[1:07:25] on God the denominations have all kicked
[1:07:27] him out amen he's outside yeah the
[1:07:34] denominations they're already condemned
[1:07:37] they've already rejected God they've
[1:07:38] already turned their back on the word so
[1:07:41] I have not come into the world to
[1:07:43] condemn the
[1:07:45] world I've come into the world that the
[1:07:48] world might be
[1:07:50] saved why are you here why are you here
[1:07:53] as part of the body of Jesus Christ not
[1:07:55] to condemn the world but that the world
[1:07:58] Amen through Christ in you might be
[1:08:04] saved what happens when that Mercy is
[1:08:07] spurned there's nothing left but
[1:08:11] condemnation why because they're already
[1:08:18] condemned in the message adoption
[1:08:21] 1960 then if God has sent us to be his
[1:08:24] ambassadors all power that's in heaven
[1:08:28] all that God is all of his angels and
[1:08:30] all of his power stands behind our words
[1:08:33] if we are correctly an ordained sent
[1:08:35] Messenger to the people God has to honor
[1:08:37] the word for he has so solemnly written
[1:08:40] that whatever you bind on Earth will be
[1:08:42] B bind in heaven whatever you loose on
[1:08:44] Earth will loose in heaven and I give
[1:08:46] unto thee the keys to the kingdom all
[1:08:48] such great promises he given to the
[1:08:51] church he's promised amen when when when
[1:08:54] Peter amen when Peter said they asked
[1:08:57] Jesus asked who say you that I am in in
[1:08:59] Matthew 16 he says Thou Are Christ the
[1:09:01] son of the Living God he says blessed
[1:09:03] art thou Simon bar Jonah for flesh and
[1:09:05] blood is not revealed this to you but my
[1:09:07] Father which is in heaven has revealed
[1:09:08] this to you and Upon This Rock I'll
[1:09:10] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[1:09:11] shall not Prevail and I give unto you
[1:09:14] the Keys of the Kingdom whatsoever you
[1:09:16] bind on Earth will be bound whatsoever
[1:09:17] you loose on Earth will be loosed and
[1:09:19] that power has been with the Living
[1:09:21] Church amen that's on the found
[1:09:23] foundation of the revelation of Jesus
[1:09:26] Christ and the revelation of Jesus
[1:09:28] Christ present tense is the inoculation
[1:09:31] against the Antichrist Spirit and the
[1:09:33] Antichrist spirit is against this
[1:09:35] Revelation am has been in every age has
[1:09:38] been in every dispensation is the same
[1:09:41] [Music]
[1:09:44] today so then brother B said doesn't the
[1:09:48] church have power to forgive sins
[1:09:49] doesn't have power to bind the church
[1:09:51] have power to loose and brother Benham
[1:09:53] said said that's correct he was
[1:09:55] questioned on that by a Catholic am he
[1:09:57] said but not the way the Catholic Church
[1:09:59] does it they go to the priest and the
[1:10:00] priest says I make you free do hail
[1:10:02] marage do this pent this that's not it
[1:10:05] he said how did they do it they said
[1:10:06] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:10:08] the Lord Jesus Christ amen and that's
[1:10:10] how their sins were remitted that's how
[1:10:12] they were loose why what were they doing
[1:10:14] they were giving them the true word the
[1:10:16] gospel which is Jesus Christ Christ the
[1:10:19] anointed word for the day and when they
[1:10:21] gave them the word those that took it
[1:10:23] were loosed and freed from their sins
[1:10:25] those that rejected it stayed Bound in
[1:10:27] their
[1:10:28] sin they were already condemned they
[1:10:30] stayed condemned amen but there were
[1:10:33] some who were loosed Hallelujah am how
[1:10:37] will they be loosed in this day amen
[1:10:41] because we have the word of
[1:10:43] reconciliation we have the ministry of
[1:10:45] reconciliation we have been
[1:10:47] given the perfect interpretation of the
[1:10:50] word with Divine Vindication we know our
[1:10:53] day and its
[1:10:54] message this message is
[1:10:57] Christ brother said the message is
[1:11:00] Christ it's not an addition to Christ
[1:11:03] it's not plus Christ it's not a bonus
[1:11:05] Christ this message is
[1:11:10] Christ praise be to God brother B says
[1:11:14] in the fourth seal said if God speaks
[1:11:16] and sends you he backs up what you
[1:11:20] say this is what we have to recognize
[1:11:22] Who We Are amen if God speaks and sends
[1:11:25] you he backs up what you say see notice
[1:11:28] if you an ambassador from Heaven All
[1:11:30] Heavens behind
[1:11:34] you and Heaven is consisted of the word
[1:11:38] so if you're speaking the word all the
[1:11:41] word is behind you all the power of the
[1:11:43] word is behind you not when you take
[1:11:45] your own idea not when you take your own
[1:11:47] but when you have the
[1:11:50] word brother B I'm going to read two
[1:11:52] quotes together as we close close here
[1:11:55] yeah we're very
[1:11:56] close and the message Christ is revealed
[1:11:59] in his own word he says see down through
[1:12:00] the age we started off from the
[1:12:01] foundation from the first church age
[1:12:03] when the seed went in the ground the
[1:12:04] complete seed then it came out through
[1:12:07] the feet Luther come back out through
[1:12:08] Wesley then it come to Pentecost the
[1:12:10] tongues and the lips see now it's in the
[1:12:12] eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth
[1:12:15] and now there's nothing else left for it
[1:12:16] to come but him himself to step into
[1:12:20] that so what comes after Malachi 4 him
[1:12:23] himself to step into that into
[1:12:28] what praise God because that's the last
[1:12:32] thing there is the next is the
[1:12:34] intelligence and we have no intelligence
[1:12:35] of our own it's his what is that the
[1:12:39] headship the word that has come amen we
[1:12:44] have no sight of our own how can a man
[1:12:46] foresee these things he can't do it it's
[1:12:48] God himself it's becoming to a place
[1:12:50] he's governed the body all the way
[1:12:52] through then the complete body of Christ
[1:12:55] is revealed in the form of a bride
[1:12:57] praise God then all the way down through
[1:12:59] but the complete body of Christ is
[1:13:02] revealed in the form of a bride that was
[1:13:05] taken out of his side like Adam did at
[1:13:08] the
[1:13:09] beginning praise
[1:13:11] God then in choosing of a bride he says
[1:13:15] the other he says the one Church the
[1:13:17] false church is pregnated with the false
[1:13:20] word and bring forth the Antichrist one
[1:13:22] day he said the other is pregnated by
[1:13:24] the word of God and will bring forth the
[1:13:27] body the finished body of Jesus Christ
[1:13:30] which is the bride hallelujah amen as
[1:13:34] you are a member but you your body is
[1:13:37] one but many members many members make
[1:13:39] up one body so also is
[1:13:43] Christ and the word those who are
[1:13:45] pregnated with the word of God will
[1:13:47] bring forth the body the finished body
[1:13:49] of Jesus Christ which is the bride the
[1:13:51] body of Christ isn't finished yet yet
[1:13:53] how many knows that a man and a woman is
[1:13:55] one in Christ is one body the word the
[1:13:57] bride will have to be the rest of that
[1:14:00] body and the two together makes one body
[1:14:02] again like Adam was at the beginning man
[1:14:04] his wife are one now she the true bride
[1:14:07] so sold out to him that she uses no mind
[1:14:10] of her own his mind of course is his
[1:14:12] will and his will is his
[1:14:15] word I believe that what has he given us
[1:14:18] his word if we have his word perfectly
[1:14:21] interpreted for our day we have his will
[1:14:24] am how do you know it's his will because
[1:14:26] it's the perfect interpretation of his
[1:14:28] word his word is his will and that's
[1:14:30] what directs us amen amen that's what
[1:14:33] guides us that's the head listen that is
[1:14:37] the head guiding the body amen that's
[1:14:41] right the end time revelation of this
[1:14:43] word being lived by the body is the head
[1:14:48] directing the body prise
[1:14:50] God the paman church age from the Church
[1:14:53] age book he says this this is in pick up
[1:14:55] your pen and write brother Simon
[1:14:57] referred to it said those in the bride
[1:14:59] do only his will no one can make them do
[1:15:02] otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord
[1:15:05] or they keep still n though they know
[1:15:07] that it has to be God in them doing the
[1:15:09] works fulfilling his own
[1:15:11] word he did not complete all his work
[1:15:13] while in his Earthly Ministry so now he
[1:15:16] works in and through the bride amen
[1:15:20] where is he working in and through the
[1:15:22] bride at the end time if he comes as
[1:15:24] judge in between priest and King where
[1:15:27] will he work in and through the bride
[1:15:30] when the white wiwin comes down as the
[1:15:32] Supreme judge of all Heaven and Earth
[1:15:34] where will he go to the body which is
[1:15:36] the bride where will he administer his
[1:15:38] office through the
[1:15:41] bride cuz he did not finish all his work
[1:15:44] in his Earthly
[1:15:46] Ministry now he finishes he completes it
[1:15:49] in and through the
[1:15:51] bride she knows that that for it was not
[1:15:53] yet time for him to do certain things
[1:15:55] that he must now do but he will now
[1:15:57] fulfill through the bride that work
[1:16:00] which he left for this specific
[1:16:03] time he left the work for today and he's
[1:16:07] going to do it through you and I so he
[1:16:09] has to have a complete
[1:16:11] body to finish the complete
[1:16:15] work the work that he didn't complete in
[1:16:18] his first Earthly Journey now he's going
[1:16:20] to do it in through the bride so he must
[1:16:22] complete the body
[1:16:23] to complete the
[1:16:26] work that's the day you and I live in
[1:16:30] this is
[1:16:32] today I want to close with two
[1:16:34] scriptures just to solidify what we've
[1:16:37] been saying in Matthew chapter
[1:16:46] 10 Matthew chapter
[1:16:52] 10 verse
[1:17:00] 11 Jesus sent his sending out his
[1:17:03] disciples to
[1:17:05] preach the Good Tidings of the Kingdom
[1:17:08] that's what he sent them to preach that
[1:17:10] the Messiah is here that the promise is
[1:17:13] being unfold he sent them to preach Good
[1:17:15] Tidings of the kingdom it says into
[1:17:17] whatsoever city or town you shall enter
[1:17:20] inquire who is it is worthy and there
[1:17:23] till you go hence then and when you come
[1:17:26] into a house salute it and if the house
[1:17:28] is worthy let your peace come upon it
[1:17:30] but if it be not worthy let your peace
[1:17:32] return to you and whosoever shall not
[1:17:35] receive you nor hear your words when you
[1:17:37] depart out of that house or city shake
[1:17:39] off the dust of your feet verily I say
[1:17:41] unto you it shall be more tolerable for
[1:17:43] that land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the
[1:17:46] day of judgment than for that
[1:17:49] City let's go down to verse 40 same same
[1:17:53] chapter chapter 10 verse
[1:17:56] 40 he that receiveth you receiveth me
[1:18:01] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[1:18:03] that sent
[1:18:06] me he that receiveth a prophet in the
[1:18:09] name of a prophet shall receive a
[1:18:10] prophet's reward and he that receive a
[1:18:12] righteous man in the name of a righteous
[1:18:14] man shall receive a righteous man's
[1:18:16] reward and whosoever shall give to drink
[1:18:19] unto one of these little ones a cup of
[1:18:20] cold water only in the name of a
[1:18:22] disciple
[1:18:23] verily I say unto you he shall in no
[1:18:26] wise lose his
[1:18:29] reward he sent them out to preach Good
[1:18:33] Tidings of the Kingdom he sent them out
[1:18:36] to preach present tense truth he sent
[1:18:39] them out to preach the
[1:18:41] gospel but he said wherever you go
[1:18:43] salute it and put your peace upon it if
[1:18:48] they're worthy let your peace remain but
[1:18:50] if they're unworthy if they won't
[1:18:53] receive the word if they'll reject it
[1:18:55] then let your peace come back to you and
[1:18:58] as you go out shake off the dust it'll
[1:19:00] be more tolerable for Sodom and gomorah
[1:19:03] in the day of judgment than
[1:19:05] that he didn't send them out there and
[1:19:08] say go condemn and go chat no go bring a
[1:19:12] message of
[1:19:13] peace and if they don't receive it then
[1:19:17] your peace will return unto you and
[1:19:19] shake off the dust and go on that sealed
[1:19:23] their
[1:19:24] Doom they were
[1:19:27] ambassadors ambassadors of the Gospel
[1:19:29] ambassadors for peace but when they were
[1:19:32] rejected they rejected peace and life
[1:19:34] yeah and Jesus said if they receive you
[1:19:37] they receive me they receive me they
[1:19:40] receive him that sent
[1:19:42] me what if they reject
[1:19:47] you what happens when they rejected the
[1:19:50] disciples then he goes on and it's
[1:19:53] amazing where he goes next if they
[1:19:55] receive you they'll receive me if they
[1:19:56] receive me they received him that sent
[1:19:58] me he that receive a prophet in the name
[1:20:01] of a prophet shall receive a prophet's
[1:20:04] reward he that receive a righteous man
[1:20:07] and he's going down by
[1:20:09] strata he will receive a prophet will
[1:20:12] receive a prophet's reward which is a
[1:20:14] whole host of Heaven the
[1:20:16] word he that received a righteous man
[1:20:18] now he's went from Prophet just to a
[1:20:20] righteous man but receive a righteous
[1:20:23] man's
[1:20:24] reward which is
[1:20:27] life and then he goes down lower but he
[1:20:31] that will give a cup of cold water to
[1:20:34] one only in the name of a disciple so he
[1:20:36] just gives it to just one of the
[1:20:37] disciples doesn't have an office not a
[1:20:40] prophet not but he that'll give a cup of
[1:20:42] cold water in one in the name of a
[1:20:45] disciple shall in no wise lose his
[1:20:51] reward
[1:20:53] the same ones that went out with the
[1:20:56] same
[1:20:57] message there are those that receive
[1:21:00] judgment because they rejected it there
[1:21:04] are those that receive life even all the
[1:21:07] way down to reward for someone who just
[1:21:10] gives them a cup of cold
[1:21:12] water and the name of a
[1:21:15] disciple the question is what are you
[1:21:18] here
[1:21:19] for what are you here for
[1:21:23] in the day of judgment under the Sixth
[1:21:26] Seal with the Earth trembling under the
[1:21:28] impact of The Sixth Seal ready to burst
[1:21:30] forth amen with with the Christ on the
[1:21:33] outside with judgments rolling beneath
[1:21:35] the Earth amen reading to belch out amen
[1:21:37] with the full wrath of God about to
[1:21:39] unleash what are you here

[1:21:46] this dispensation why are you here don't
[1:21:49] don't say bride you ask yourself why am
[1:21:51] I here why why am I on this Earth what
[1:21:54] am I doing in this dispensation when
[1:21:55] judgment's all around amen I want to go
[1:21:58] with a word of reconciliation with a
[1:22:00] Ministry of reconciliation not to
[1:22:02] condemn the world but the world might be
[1:22:05] saved if they'll just receive the Christ
[1:22:07] that I'm bringing to them if they'll
[1:22:09] just receive the word amen they'll be
[1:22:14] saved that's why I believe I'm here not
[1:22:18] here to condemn the world's already
[1:22:20] condemned but I'm here that somebody
[1:22:23] might have life I'm here to to spread
[1:22:27] the word sometimes through my lips
[1:22:28] mostly through my
[1:22:30] actions but I'm here to live the word
[1:22:32] I'm here to be the word I'm here to be
[1:22:35] amen one member but that member's part
[1:22:38] of the body of Christ amen so I'm here
[1:22:40] to represent Christ to the world that
[1:22:42] when I come in contact I want my peace
[1:22:44] to go into that house amen and I don't
[1:22:47] want my peace to come back to me I want
[1:22:50] it to stay
[1:22:51] there
[1:22:54] amen I want somebody if they can't
[1:22:57] receive a prophet they can't receive a
[1:22:59] righteous man if they could at least
[1:23:01] give a cup of cold water to one who is
[1:23:04] just a
[1:23:05] disciple at least there'll be a reward
[1:23:08] amen for that why because she is
[1:23:13] him amen that's the dispensation we're
[1:23:17] in today that's why I believe that God
[1:23:20] has placed me on the earth in this day
[1:23:23] he's placed me here for Mercy he's
[1:23:25] placed me here for life because the
[1:23:28] world is already
[1:23:31] condemned that's why when he takes his
[1:23:33] bride away and the spirit goes up when
[1:23:37] the bride goes up there's nothing here
[1:23:39] to hold back the
[1:23:42] Wrath but while she's here the blood is
[1:23:47] here right because brother Brenham said
[1:23:49] now you see why brother Brenham said the
[1:23:51] church is is the blood by the spirit
[1:23:55] amen because the blood represented the
[1:23:57] life and the life of Christ is here in
[1:23:59] his body in his bride and as long as the
[1:24:03] life is here there's a mercy seat here
[1:24:06] as long as the life is here there's a
[1:24:08] chance for life but once the life goes
[1:24:11] no more chance
[1:24:12] amen I'm not I'm not looking forward to
[1:24:16] that I want
[1:24:19] reconciliation let's all stand
[1:24:23] Amen brother Ben if you can make your
[1:24:25] way up and musicians if you could come
[1:24:27] let's just bow our heads and pray dear
[1:24:29] heavenly father we thank you Lord for
