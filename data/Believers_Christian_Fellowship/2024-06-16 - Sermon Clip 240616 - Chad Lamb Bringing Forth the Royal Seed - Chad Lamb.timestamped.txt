[0:00] is sometimes we try to intellectualize
[0:02] things and sometimes that's my problem
[0:04] I'm trying to understand too much and
[0:06] it's not about comprehension
[0:08] intellectually it's about comprehension
[0:10] spiritually it's about a spiritual truth
[0:12] that's Awakening inside of us that's why
[0:15] amen we could describe Christ as the
[0:17] lamb and his wife is the wife of the
[0:19] Lamb so he's the lamb she's the lamb but
[0:21] he's also the lion and know she has to
[0:23] be the lionness I mean you you see all
[0:25] these types and shadows coming down
[0:27] through amen they're all trying to dis s
[0:30] truth to us it's not so that we get hung
[0:32] up and say well is he a lion now or is
[0:34] he a lamb now he's no longer the lamb
[0:36] now he's the lion so am I supposed to be
[0:38] a lamb listen forget about all of that
[0:40] God is trying to take some symbol that
[0:43] you understand and teach you a truth
[0:45] he's not trying to divide himself up and
[0:47] say now I have this nature and now I
[0:49] have this nature it's not like that
[0:51] friends we get all boggled down by
[0:52] details and now is he this or now he's
[0:54] that he's a lamb is he a lamb he's
[0:56] always a lamb he'll always be the lamb
[0:58] when he takes the Throne of David he'll
[0:59] be the Lamb of God but he's also the
[1:01] lion of the tribe of Judah and he's
[1:03] always been the lion and will always be
[1:05] the
[1:07] lion so people get confused with details
[1:10] brother brandham doesn't get confused
[1:12] with details that's why he's a perfect
[1:14] Prophet because he can take the same
[1:16] scripture and use it two different ways
[1:18] because it's all about the revelation of
[1:21] the truth it's not about the details of
[1:23] keeping the words lined out
[1:27] correctly so people get confused and
[1:29] think brother B contradicting himself
[1:31] one time he makes Noah those Noah and
[1:33] those in the ark are the 144,000 Jews
[1:36] that are saved through the time of
[1:37] tribulation one time he makes them the
[1:39] elect seed that's saved from destruction
[1:41] another time he makes them part of the
[1:43] foolish virgin that are saved from
[1:44] destruction amen when was he right and
[1:47] when was he wrong he's always
[1:50] right because it's the truth that's
[1:52] being inseminated by the word and so now
[1:55] we try to say I mean you take any type
[1:57] if you take a type of The Lion and the
[1:59] pride of lion you take that type and you
[2:00] run it too tight you're going to find a
[2:02] place where it falls apart and no longer
[2:04] expresses the nature of Christ because
[2:06] these are still beast in a fallen World
[2:08] in a fallen condition and sometimes they
[2:10] eat their own
[2:11] young that's not the point don't get
[2:14] hung up on the details catch the
[2:16] Revelation that he's bringing to us this
[2:19] day he wants us he's calling for his
[2:22] bride his church his seed the the the
[2:25] the female version of him to unite with
[2:27] him in this day so that he can re
[2:30] produce himself upon the
[2:32] Earth how's he going to reproduce
[2:34] himself she's not going to birth out
[2:36] another Jesus Christ like Mary did 2,000
[2:38] years ago she's actually going to
[2:40] receive the word which is he himself the
[2:43] promised word for this hour which is he
[2:46] himself manifesting himself in the form
[2:48] of a bride Jesus Christ in the bride
[2:51] form and she is going to now surrender
[2:54] to the headship of the word and live
[2:57] that word to the letter by the power of
[2:59] the Holy Ghost ghost has been released
[3:00] by the fullness of the word coming back
[3:03] and that will be him reproduced through
[3:05] the womb of the
[3:07] Bride amen don't let your mind get B
[3:10] well what child what baby and when and
[3:11] all of that it's you it's in you it's in
[3:14] collectively in the bride it's Christ
[3:16] coming forth from the womb of his his
[3:19] his church that has been
[3:21] redeemed amen
