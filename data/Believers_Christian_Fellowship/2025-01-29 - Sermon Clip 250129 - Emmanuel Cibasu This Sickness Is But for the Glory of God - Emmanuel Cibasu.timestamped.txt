[0:00] when we say this Jesus is the son of God
[0:03] there are tendency there's always a
[0:05] tendency to think that there's a father
[0:08] somewhere with the white long beard and
[0:11] Jesus is a son out down here the prophet
[0:15] of God says that a Son of God Jesus
[0:18] being the Son of God means the word
[0:22] wrapped with
[0:24] flesh there's no a father sitting
[0:27] somewhere with a beard it's the fullness
[0:29] of the word of God came down and for men
[0:33] to see it it wrapped itself with the
