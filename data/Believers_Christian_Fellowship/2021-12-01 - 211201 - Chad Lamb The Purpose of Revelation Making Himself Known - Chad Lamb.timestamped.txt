[6:13] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[6:16] for this privilege of standing here
[6:18] together and singing lord songs to
[6:20] praise your name
[6:21] songs of love and admiration for you for
[6:24] all you've done for us
[6:26] and god lord as we come to this portion
[6:28] of the service where we take the word
[6:30] and begin to read it lord we're asking
[6:32] that you would come and provide the
[6:33] supernatural element that's needed to
[6:36] break the bread of life lord that you
[6:38] would give us i sav that we might see
[6:40] and you prick our hearts that we might
[6:43] comprehend lord all that it is you're
[6:45] trying to share with us in this hour may
[6:48] we be changed people lord may we leave
[6:50] here lord having grown some
[6:52] by the revelation that you give to our
[6:54] hearts
[6:55] we ask that you would be pleased and all
[6:57] that's said and done and that you would
[6:58] take your place at the head
[7:00] that you would have preeminence among us
[7:01] as we yield ourselves to you
[7:04] speak your word of life to our hearts we
[7:05] pray
[7:06] in jesus christ's name
[7:09] amen
[7:10] amen god bless you as you're standing
[7:12] let's take our bibles and turn to john
[7:15] chapter 17.
[7:19] i heard the
[7:20] prayer request read for
[7:23] sister lori tamblington
[7:25] and i had the privilege of talking to
[7:27] brother glenn and sister lori today and
[7:29] when i talked to sister lori it was a
[7:31] treat because i was encouraged by her
[7:34] faith amen she was positive on the phone
[7:36] and they're going through a really
[7:37] difficult trial quite a shock all of a
[7:40] sudden to get information that they
[7:42] received is quite a shock
[7:44] but she was standing on the promise and
[7:47] believing she was in god's hand and she
[7:48] was trusting the lord
[7:50] and i got done with that conversation
[7:52] and i was encouraged by her faith so
[7:54] just remember to keep them in prayer who
[7:57] knows what path they have to walk and
[7:59] what they may have to experience and and
[8:01] doctors and all of those things but just
[8:03] pray that the lord would just encourage
[8:05] her faith then give them wisdom step by
[8:08] step to walk the path that he
[8:09] predestined for them and just just
[8:11] remember them in prayer in the next
[8:13] coming days and weeks
[8:15] also i talked to brother jonathan
[8:17] baumgardner and his wife sister irena's
[8:19] father passed away yesterday morning and
[8:22] he had been suffering with lou gehrig's
[8:23] disease and his health had been
[8:25] deteriorating and he passed away
[8:27] yesterday morning so he has gone on to
[8:29] his reward but the baumgardner family
[8:31] will be traveling this weekend back to
[8:33] alabama for the funeral to be gone most
[8:35] of next week so just remember them in
[8:37] prayer remember the whole family but
[8:39] especially brother jonathan and his
[8:41] family as they travel down and travel
[8:43] back and let's just stand together as a
[8:45] body and hold one another up amen
[8:48] also i wanted to announce that the
[8:49] meetings that were scheduled this
[8:51] weekend at brother dan ratliffs have
[8:52] been postponed one week
[8:54] they had a few coveted cases in their
[8:56] church so brother dan decided just to
[8:58] postpone it a week to be safe so brother
[9:00] ben will be preaching up there not this
[9:03] weekend but next week weekend 11th and
[9:05] 12th saturday night and sunday so if you
[9:08] plan on going up make sure you adjust
[9:09] your plans one week for the 11th and the
[9:12] 12th and i'm sure brother ben would love
[9:13] to see your smiling faces and hear your
[9:16] loud amen
[9:18] and just support the gift amen
[9:20] let's look here at john chapter 17
[9:23] verse 3
[9:25] and for a title i'd like to take the
[9:27] purpose of revelation
[9:29] making himself known
[9:31] john 17 verse 3
[9:35] and this is life eternal
[9:38] that they might know thee the only true
[9:40] god
[9:41] in jesus christ whom thou has sent
[9:44] so what is eternal life this is life
[9:46] eternal that they might know thee the
[9:48] only true god in jesus christ whom thou
[9:51] has sent amen god bless you as you're
[9:53] seated may he bless his word
[9:56] tonight
[9:58] i took my title from this quote that i'm
[10:00] going to read out of christ as the
[10:01] mystery of god revealed
[10:03] and it says
[10:04] reveal webster says
[10:07] to make known make known and especially
[10:09] webster says in divine truth that
[10:12] revelation means
[10:14] the revelation it is christ's way of
[10:16] making himself known to his church amen
[10:20] so the revelation it is christ's way of
[10:22] making himself known to the church
[10:24] we we get concepts sometimes when we
[10:26] hear the term revelation and we you know
[10:29] being in the message and and coming to
[10:31] church for so long you hear the term
[10:32] revelation you hear it over and over and
[10:34] over again and some people uh uh
[10:37] have different ideas about revelation
[10:39] and for some it's just maybe information
[10:42] for some maybe it's something that is
[10:44] foreign and far away but when brother
[10:46] branham gives us the definition all of a
[10:48] sudden the definition comes right home
[10:50] amen revelation is christ's way of
[10:52] making himself known to his church
[10:55] what is it it's christ wanting to share
[10:57] himself with you amen revelation is not
[11:00] something that's high and beyond reach
[11:02] for the believing child it is not
[11:04] intellectual knowledge or understanding
[11:07] it's not revelation it's not something
[11:09] that's so deep that you can never get it
[11:11] you can never share it you can never
[11:14] have it it's only for the uh the
[11:16] theologian or for the deep thinker no
[11:18] revelation is christ's way of making
[11:20] himself known to his church
[11:23] revelation is simple amen it's not
[11:25] complicated even though the revelation
[11:27] that's given can be quite deep amen it
[11:29] can go quite deep into the mysteries of
[11:32] god quite deep into the bible but
[11:34] revelation is simple when it comes down
[11:36] to the very core of it it is christ
[11:38] making himself known to his church amen
[11:41] revelation by revelation amen word upon
[11:44] word christ is he's wanting his church
[11:48] to know him amen christ is not he is not
[11:52] standing afar off and seeing who can
[11:54] climb the mountain and get to him he's
[11:56] not he's not seeing who's the the the
[12:00] smartest and who's the most able to dig
[12:02] in and who can put the pieces together
[12:05] no it's
[12:06] his desire to reveal himself to his
[12:08] church
[12:09] god wants to be known he wants to have
[12:11] fellowship he wants to make himself
[12:13] known to you and i amen so god
[12:17] this revelation is his mechanism by
[12:19] which he reveals himself or he makes
[12:21] himself known to his church and we say
[12:23] why did he use revelation because only
[12:26] the elect can receive divine revelation
[12:30] it is the key it is the the way in which
[12:33] that he can make himself known to his
[12:35] church but still be a mystery to the
[12:37] rest of the world that way it can be a
[12:39] secret revelation to the church amen but
[12:42] it can be openly declared but still
[12:44] secretly revealed
[12:46] the ministry of brother branham was
[12:48] openly declared he preached for all who
[12:50] were here amen the messages are still
[12:52] available our services are preached for
[12:54] all who will hear amen the brightest
[12:57] preaching the the the message is going
[12:59] out amen it's for anybody who would want
[13:02] to hear it but the revelation of what's
[13:05] being preached a revelation of what
[13:07] brother branham god is only divinely
[13:10] given to his bride amen
[13:12] so it is the the means by which that he
[13:15] can take amen the word amen and the word
[13:18] can go out in a language with everybody
[13:21] can hear the words that are spoken but
[13:24] there's something else that's being
[13:26] spoken amen
[13:29] amen that's why people can leave the
[13:32] service and you can have such different
[13:34] reports about a church service amen
[13:36] somebody will leave condemned and
[13:38] somebody will leave free
[13:41] somebody will leave having their
[13:42] questions answered and somebody else
[13:44] will leave confused
[13:46] i and everybody you know could sit in
[13:49] the service and understand the language
[13:51] all the words could be clearly spoken
[13:53] amen and all the words could have a
[13:54] clear definition amen but but the
[13:57] revelation is something that god
[13:59] sovereignly gives to his elect and
[14:01] that's his mechanism for making himself
[14:03] known amen he uses preaching of course
[14:06] amen he uses written he uses written
[14:08] language that's what we have the message
[14:10] books in we have it in languages amen
[14:12] for whoever however many languages is
[14:14] translated in we have the bible in
[14:16] english or whatever language that a
[14:18] native speaker would read in but still
[14:21] there's a mysterious element it's not
[14:24] just the words it's the message behind
[14:26] the words
[14:29] so that's why you you can have uh uh
[14:32] like i said you can have meetings but
[14:34] people can walk away from the meetings
[14:35] with such a different uh perspective
[14:38] amen you can listen to a tape but two
[14:41] people can listen to the same message
[14:43] tape and walk away with two different
[14:45] understandings of what the prophet of
[14:47] god was trying to say amen because
[14:49] christ is trying to get
[14:52] we say christ is trying to get the
[14:53] message to his bride but what he's
[14:55] really trying to do is get himself to
[14:57] his bride
[14:59] and the the way he does that is by
[15:02] revelation amen
[15:03] so i want us to just remember that as we
[15:06] we we talked this evening in this sermon
[15:09] that the revelation it's christ's way of
[15:11] making himself known to his church
[15:14] if that's the truth amen which it is but
[15:17] that statement being what it is
[15:19] it makes me crave revelation above
[15:22] everything else amen
[15:23] because we love
[15:24] him this is why
[15:30] intellectual understanding will never
[15:32] compete with divine revelation
[15:36] they're million miles apart
[15:39] amen and it's
[15:41] it's you know
[15:43] it's as far apart
[15:45] as
[15:46] somebody knowing about somebody
[15:50] and having information about another
[15:52] human being and somebody knowing that
[15:54] person
[15:56] like i can know somebody personally and
[16:00] i know the year they were born and i
[16:02] know who their parents were and i can
[16:05] gather all of that by information i
[16:07] could even know what their personality
[16:09] is like i know their favorite food their
[16:10] favorite color
[16:12] we can know all of that in the way of
[16:14] information amen the information can be
[16:16] gathered it can be put on paper it can
[16:18] be put on tape and the information can
[16:20] be shared so that everybody has the same
[16:23] information about this human being amen
[16:26] but that information will never touch
[16:28] the actual contact with that person and
[16:30] knowing them as an individual
[16:33] that's the difference between
[16:34] information and revelation amen
[16:38] brother bram says in the message jehovah
[16:40] jireh then we find that when when seen
[16:43] i'm sorry we find that
[16:45] when seeing that coming little old
[16:47] grandpa like that amalek fell in love
[16:50] with her he's talking about sarah after
[16:51] the body change going to gerrard and
[16:53] went and took her to be his wife think
[16:55] of that see where he turned he turned
[16:58] them back sure he had to
[17:00] the bible the love letter
[17:03] it's something god writes to us
[17:05] he has hid it from the eyes of the wise
[17:07] and prudent and will reveal it to the
[17:09] babes such as would learn
[17:12] so this bible amen is a love letter amen
[17:17] it's a lot of things to a lot of people
[17:19] amen
[17:20] it's a historical text to some uh it it
[17:24] is uh it is a jewish book partially a
[17:27] christian book partially it can be all
[17:29] kinds of things it can contain
[17:31] traditions it can contain ideas and
[17:33] philosophies this bible can be a lot of
[17:35] things to a lot of people but to me it's
[17:37] a love letter
[17:39] and if it's a if it's a book of history
[17:42] i'll read it differently than if it's a
[17:44] love letter
[17:45] it'll mean something different to me if
[17:47] it's if it is a code of conduct i'll
[17:50] read it differently than if it's a love
[17:52] letter if it's a book of doctrine i'll
[17:55] read it differently then it's a love
[17:56] letter so the way we read the bible is
[17:59] dependent on what how we perceive this
[18:02] book and what its intent is to us
[18:06] if it's instruction amen just
[18:08] instruction for life we'll read it one
[18:11] way amen although it contains history
[18:14] absolutely it contains construction and
[18:16] instruction for life absolutely it
[18:19] contains the structure of the church it
[18:21] contains the the law to the jews it
[18:23] contains the message of grace to the
[18:25] gentiles it has all of those things
[18:27] included all of that's true but that's
[18:29] not what this book is to me all of that
[18:32] to me is a love letter from god to me
[18:36] and when it's a love letter amen then i
[18:39] read it differently than i do if it's a
[18:41] code of conduct or a way in which that
[18:44] we're supposed to subject ourselves to
[18:45] live we would read it with a different
[18:47] frame of mind
[18:49] so when we come to the message the
[18:50] message is christ amen
[18:54] in the message amen is is a love letter
[18:57] to us also
[19:00] and we can take the message and we can
[19:01] do the same thing people do with their
[19:03] bibles we can make it information
[19:06] we can make it doctrine
[19:07] we can make it a code of conduct
[19:10] if i if i see the message as a code of
[19:13] conduct i will read the message with the
[19:15] frame of mind that this is a code of
[19:17] conduct
[19:20] and i will get something different out
[19:22] of it than somebody else who reads in a
[19:23] different frame of mind
[19:25] it's like if i read it as a historical
[19:28] happening amen i will i will get a
[19:30] perspective as a historical happening
[19:34] if i read the message as a as a
[19:36] testimony of the life of a great man
[19:38] then that's what i'll get that's what
[19:40] i'll draw out of that but if the message
[19:43] is christ to me a revelation of jesus
[19:45] christ to me then everything i glean out
[19:47] of that will be different amen because
[19:50] of my revelation of what the message is
[19:54] so that's why i mean you can share
[19:57] message books and message tapes with
[19:58] everybody you can listen to a message
[20:00] and say oh that was so good it spoke to
[20:02] me the next person can listen to and say
[20:04] i had trouble getting anything out of it
[20:07] it depends on what our frame of mind is
[20:10] so god has hid his word amen in such a
[20:14] way that it can be available for all
[20:17] but it's hidden from all except a select
[20:19] group that he'll bring revelation to
[20:22] and don't forget the revelation is god's
[20:24] way of making himself known to his
[20:27] church
[20:29] amen let's go to galatians chapter one
[20:41] now when we say all these things
[20:45] the the message contains within it
[20:49] the record of a man of god
[20:53] it contains within it
[20:55] uh
[20:57] conduct i mean it can contains in it you
[20:59] know uh um
[21:01] instructions for conduct instructions
[21:03] for setting up a church that's all
[21:04] contained in it just like the bible
[21:06] contains all of those things but if
[21:08] that's all the further my revelation
[21:10] goes amen then i will intellectually
[21:12] dive into those things and look for
[21:14] those things amen and that will become
[21:16] all the message is for me no more and
[21:19] what will happen is if i look at it
[21:22] intellectually and i look at it as a
[21:24] code of conduct if i look at it as a
[21:26] structure for the church or or
[21:29] the the record of a great man of god if
[21:31] i look at it with those things only at
[21:34] some point i become frustrated with what
[21:36] i'm looking at
[21:38] because i'm trying amen to
[21:40] intellectually make everything fit and
[21:42] get the pieces and get all the rules and
[21:44] get the conduct and get get everything
[21:46] but but god has done it in such a way
[21:49] that you cannot intellectually make
[21:51] everything fit nicely amen or you can
[21:53] study it somebody else can study the
[21:55] message as a code of conduct amen and
[21:57] two people could be studying the message
[21:59] with the same intent and come with
[22:00] different conclusions
[22:02] because brother ben will say it one way
[22:04] in one place in a different way and
[22:05] another amen because god never wanted us
[22:08] just to take it as a rule book amen it
[22:10] was a love letter to us it was an
[22:12] expression of himself to us so if we
[22:14] take the wrong approach to it i mean we
[22:16] somewhere hit a wall and become
[22:18] frustrated
[22:21] i think sometimes many times this is why
[22:23] people have left the message or become
[22:25] frustrated or found fault amen because
[22:28] they're trying to use it intellectually
[22:30] like a textbook amen and it fails
[22:33] intellectually as a textbook
[22:36] but if you see it as the revelation of
[22:38] jesus christ for us in this day then the
[22:41] textbook part goes out of your mind amen
[22:44] trying to make everything amen fit into
[22:46] a tight package so that we know what
[22:47] we're supposed to do goes out of your
[22:49] mind now it becomes jesus christ
[22:51] revealing himself personally to me and
[22:53] then the message is perfect in that
[22:56] revelation
[22:58] it fits the bill every time it is
[23:00] absolutely beautiful in the revelation
[23:02] of christ to us
[23:05] let's look at galatians chapter one
[23:09] verse 10
[23:15] for do i now persuade men or god
[23:18] or do i seek to please men
[23:20] for if i yet please men i should not be
[23:22] the servant of christ but i certify you
[23:25] brethren that the gospel which was
[23:27] preached of me is not after man
[23:30] for i never received it of man neither
[23:32] was i taught it but by the revelation of
[23:35] jesus christ
[23:37] so paul the apostle was not taught the
[23:39] message
[23:41] paul the apostle was given a revelation
[23:43] of jesus christ and that was the gospel
[23:46] that he preached amen
[23:47] we have not been taught christ in this
[23:50] day
[23:51] but we've been given the revelation of
[23:52] jesus christ and that's our gospel
[23:55] paul
[23:56] saw christ
[23:58] paul caught the revelation of jesus
[24:00] christ of the old testament and that
[24:02] revelation opened his eyes to what he
[24:04] had been missing his whole life paul had
[24:07] information but the information was
[24:09] never the same as meeting the person
[24:13] paul knew about the messiah he knew
[24:15] about god he knew about the law he knew
[24:18] he got the details he got i mean the
[24:20] birth date the favorite color the
[24:21] favorite food amen the names of the
[24:23] parents the city he grew up in what his
[24:25] grade point average was in high school
[24:29] you understand
[24:30] in the school of gamalio he had the law
[24:32] he had the text he had all the
[24:34] information amen and it'd be like if
[24:37] somebody is looking for a spouse and all
[24:39] they get was grade point average in high
[24:42] school favorite food favorite color mom
[24:44] and dad's name date of birth city was
[24:46] born in likes and dislikes what sports
[24:49] he played
[24:51] and they say oh i know that person you
[24:53] don't know that person you know facts
[24:55] about that person
[24:58] but when somebody finally comes in
[25:00] contact with that person it doesn't
[25:02] change any of the facts but it changes
[25:05] everything
[25:07] everything changes the information
[25:09] doesn't change but everything changes
[25:12] amen and so many times we are raised
[25:15] amen raised in church raised to be
[25:17] believers raised to be christians and
[25:19] can even be raised in the message and
[25:21] sometimes what we're getting is a lot of
[25:23] information about a person the
[25:25] information is not incorrect
[25:28] there's nothing wrong with the
[25:29] information but you can see how people
[25:32] are having trouble falling in love with
[25:34] information
[25:39] amen but by revelation the information
[25:42] becomes a person and people have no
[25:44] problem falling in love with the person
[25:47] of jesus christ
[25:51] amen
[25:54] so paul
[25:55] was not taught
[25:57] his gospel
[25:59] it was revealed to him
[26:01] when it was revealed to him he went out
[26:03] teaching it
[26:06] but to whoever received it it had to be
[26:07] revealed to him too that's why you
[26:09] cannot read paul like a textbook
[26:12] the schools have tried to read paul as a
[26:15] textbook and they've made a textbook out
[26:16] of the gospels but in in the textbook
[26:19] version of the gospels they have failed
[26:21] completely to miss the person
[26:24] and so
[26:25] the message has brought the person
[26:28] of the word
[26:30] into our midst
[26:32] and the message christ is the mystery of
[26:34] god revealed he says but god's great
[26:36] mystery what the eternal god had as a
[26:38] mystery has been now unfolded in jesus
[26:41] christ then give right down to his
[26:43] church what was once in god's mind is
[26:45] now in the body of christ jesus making
[26:48] love to the church the bride whispering
[26:51] secrets to her
[26:52] amen when when brother branham comes
[26:55] amen and preaches to us the message he
[26:57] does not have to get a new bible
[27:00] he takes the same bible with all the
[27:03] same record with all the same
[27:04] information amen but he begins to he
[27:08] begins by by the spirit of god amen to
[27:11] bring the information and paint a
[27:13] picture of jesus christ to us amen that
[27:16] the schools have missed and god
[27:18] quickened to us what brother branham was
[27:20] trying to bring to us if we're a child
[27:22] of god quickened it to us and we saw
[27:24] it's not information amen this is not
[27:27] historical this is present tense this is
[27:29] my lord
[27:31] this is jesus christ to me today amen
[27:36] brother brahma says in the god of this
[27:38] evil age he says and
[27:40] notice cain he didn't want no blood
[27:42] sacrifice he came down and offered the
[27:44] fruit of the fruit of the fields of
[27:46] beauty upon his altar very religious
[27:49] done everything that just like abel done
[27:51] offered a sacrifice
[27:55] fell down before god in worship
[27:57] obedient every bay but without the
[28:00] revelation of the word
[28:03] cain had sincerity
[28:07] cain had consecration
[28:10] cain had a desire to worship god and a
[28:12] love for god
[28:15] he he was obedient in every way
[28:18] but without the revelation of the word
[28:22] so
[28:23] so cain
[28:25] did a pretty good job as far as taking
[28:27] information and then applying it to
[28:29] worship
[28:31] but he missed something
[28:33] and brother goes on and says and the
[28:35] word was
[28:36] from the beginning
[28:38] god's plan
[28:40] but god revealed by revelation the very
[28:43] thing that he vindicated and punctuated
[28:46] that was right i love that sentence amen
[28:50] let's read it again
[28:51] and god revealed by revelation the very
[28:54] thing that he vindicated and punctuated
[28:56] that was right so when he received
[28:59] abel's sacrifice and not cain's he he
[29:02] received and he punctuated this
[29:04] sacrifice that he was right amen so he
[29:07] vindicated abel's worship and he
[29:09] rejected cain's worship but what was he
[29:12] vindicating he was vindicating the thing
[29:14] that he revealed so he first revealed it
[29:16] then he vindicated and punctuated that
[29:18] it was right
[29:20] amen where did abel get that abel got it
[29:23] by revelation and when he acted upon
[29:25] revelation god come and received his
[29:28] offering and he vindicated and
[29:30] punctuated that this was right that was
[29:31] wrong cain took it purely intellectual
[29:34] with information knowing that there had
[29:36] to bring a worship we had to bring a
[29:38] sacrifice amen there's time to worship
[29:40] god and he knew all of that and he
[29:42] wanted to in himself to worship god amen
[29:45] but he could not receive the revelation
[29:48] of how god wanted to be worshipped
[29:51] so god could not punctuate his gift
[29:55] he couldn't receive it
[29:57] because it didn't come by revelation
[30:02] oh what a lesson for us
[30:04] we can go through the motions
[30:07] we can follow somebody else's revelation
[30:10] we can do things but god is punctuating
[30:12] what he reveals
[30:16] amen read that again now and god
[30:18] revealed by revelation the very thing
[30:20] that he vindicated and punctuated that
[30:22] was right
[30:24] not religion
[30:26] not an altar
[30:27] not belonging to church not making a
[30:30] sacrifice not being sincere but by the
[30:33] revelation of the word of god amen god
[30:37] revealed to him what that his mother did
[30:40] not take an apple that a snake give to
[30:42] her but she had a sexual affair with the
[30:44] person of satan in the form of beast not
[30:47] a reptile but the most smartest subtlest
[30:49] of the field the image of man the only
[30:52] thing that the seed would mix in so when
[30:54] brother branham tells us that abel
[30:57] offered a sacrifice by revelation it
[31:00] wasn't just god and it wasn't just god
[31:02] saying hey now i need a lamb it was more
[31:06] than that there was a revelation behind
[31:08] the lamb amen he knew why it had to be a
[31:10] lamb he knew why it had to be a
[31:12] substitute he knew why it had to be
[31:14] blood
[31:16] so it wasn't it wasn't when abel
[31:18] received a revelation and brought the
[31:20] right sacrifice his sacrifice vindicated
[31:23] his revelation
[31:26] his revelation was not
[31:28] that god requires a lamb his revelation
[31:32] was that the sin in the beginning was a
[31:34] mixture of blood and now there has to be
[31:37] shedding of blood of an innocent
[31:38] substitute and he took the lamb and when
[31:41] he took the lamb and he offered the lamb
[31:43] upon the altar that that
[31:46] oh
[31:47] that revelation was christ
[31:52] because christ is the substitutionary
[31:54] lamb that was offered for us for our sin
[31:57] for what sin for the sin of being born
[31:59] wrong
[32:01] so when abel caught the revelation of
[32:04] what had gone on and now by that
[32:07] revelation he knew what was acceptable
[32:09] worship to god when he brought the lamb
[32:12] he was actually acting out the word for
[32:15] his day and foreshadowing a future day
[32:17] and this sacrifice became an image of
[32:20] christ so it was christ he was
[32:22] worshiping christ by the revelation of
[32:25] his day
[32:27] that's why when noah received the
[32:28] revelation of an ark of safety amen that
[32:31] the whole world could be saved in this
[32:32] ark that ark was christ so when he built
[32:35] the ark that revelation that he had was
[32:38] christ for his day abel's sacrifice was
[32:40] christ for his day what was he
[32:42] worshiping he was worshipping by the
[32:43] revelation of jesus christ
[32:46] when noah built an ark for a rescue for
[32:48] salvation he was worshiping in the
[32:50] revelation of jesus christ so it's
[32:52] always been the revelation of jesus
[32:54] christ all the way down through time
[32:58] and who has caught that revelation in
[33:00] the hour that is given it was always the
[33:02] elect who caught the revelation and that
[33:05] revelation was always christ for that
[33:06] day
[33:10] it's god's way
[33:12] of getting the love letter
[33:15] and redemption and salvation to his
[33:17] elect
[33:19] and that revelation is always christ
[33:26] so when abel comes to bring his offering
[33:30] this is not
[33:32] uh
[33:33] this is not
[33:35] if i could say it this way this is not
[33:38] reading on a piece of paper you must
[33:40] offer a lamb and then giving a lamb
[33:44] but this is catching something from the
[33:46] mind of god that has to do with why he
[33:49] must make an offering to begin with
[33:53] why he is outside of the garden
[33:57] why he is wearing animal skins
[34:00] to cover his naked see it's so much more
[34:04] than just take a lamin and offer a lamb
[34:06] he's caught by a revelation a divine
[34:08] revelation so much more than slay this
[34:12] lamb he now knows why he's outside of
[34:14] the garden he now knows why he must make
[34:16] a sacrifice he now knows why he's
[34:18] wearing a garment of animal skins
[34:22] cain has no idea why he's outside of the
[34:25] garden why he must bring a sacrifice and
[34:27] why he's wearing a garment of animal
[34:29] skins
[34:31] so in this hour amen the message is not
[34:34] a sea and repeat message amen it is not
[34:37] i see and i do and that brother's right
[34:40] i'll do like him and i'll be right amen
[34:42] it is not that we worship by revelation
[34:45] amen god has revealed to us his plan
[34:48] from before the foundation of the world
[34:50] what was in the back part of god's mind
[34:52] amen before amen that the world was ever
[34:55] created and we're worshiping christ by
[34:57] the revelation of christ in this hour
[35:00] not monkey see monkey do repeat after me
[35:04] this is the form and this is the ritual
[35:06] this is how we do it in the message that
[35:08] is not acceptable to god he's not
[35:10] punctuating that he's punctuating and
[35:13] vindicating what he revealed
[35:17] and when we worship by revelation it's
[35:20] vindicated and punctuated that that's
[35:22] right
[35:23] [Music]
[35:25] amen
[35:28] so we're finding in the hour that we
[35:30] live in
[35:31] the the
[35:32] the repeating after somebody else and
[35:34] repeating somebody else's revelation is
[35:36] not working
[35:38] it's falling apart amen there's been a
[35:40] great falling away and it continues on
[35:42] because people now they were just
[35:45] repeating what they had heard they were
[35:47] walking in an order a form a structure
[35:49] amen but when that order informant
[35:51] structure becomes criticized and is
[35:54] questioned
[35:57] it reveals
[35:59] it rev it reveals that there was no real
[36:02] revelation behind it it was just action
[36:06] amen by order structure or form
[36:10] this is the reason why jesus christ was
[36:13] rejected when he came on earth he was
[36:16] rejected because they had the ritual the
[36:18] structure the form they were repeating
[36:20] what they had read they were doing what
[36:22] they were told to do and they were
[36:24] believing that they were righteous in
[36:26] keeping the form and structure amen but
[36:28] when everything that deformed structure
[36:31] law prophets all were pointing to was
[36:34] standing before them they proved that
[36:36] they had no revelation they only had an
[36:39] ability to keep the system
[36:43] they kept the system going amen feeling
[36:46] like there was righteousness and
[36:48] obedience to the system
[36:52] but when christ was standing there who
[36:54] every sacrifice was pointing to
[36:57] all the law was pointing to
[37:01] they didn't love him
[37:04] they loved their system
[37:10] and we find out that no system is going
[37:12] to work in this day
[37:15] not even a message system will work
[37:18] it has to be by divine revelation
[37:22] god has got to reveal to us why
[37:25] why there's a message
[37:28] why he had to send a prophet why there
[37:31] had to be a restoration to the original
[37:33] word why there had to be a breaking of
[37:35] the seals and why there had to be the
[37:37] seven thunders being interpreted in the
[37:38] last day why why why why god is showing
[37:42] us why because he we
[37:44] we need to know that it's not just i
[37:47] heard i do but it's now i see amen this
[37:51] is jesus christ
[37:53] and this is true worship amen worshiping
[37:55] in spirit and in truth
[37:59] so god's
[38:01] plan from the beginning has always been
[38:04] the word
[38:06] and the word is god
[38:08] and the anointed word for your day is
[38:10] christ
[38:12] and when that revelation would come and
[38:13] was acted out by the believers it was
[38:15] another manifestation of christ abel was
[38:18] bringing a manifestation of christ noah
[38:21] was bringing a manifestation of christ
[38:22] moses as the deliverer was bringing a
[38:24] manifestation of christ
[38:26] and what were they doing they were
[38:27] acting by revelation upon the word of
[38:30] god
[38:32] amen
[38:33] let's go to hebrews chapter 11.
[38:45] hebrews chapter 11 verse 4.
[38:50] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[38:53] excellent sacrifice than cain
[38:55] by which he obtained witness that he was
[38:57] righteous
[38:58] god testifying of his gifts
[39:01] and by it he being dead yet speaketh
[39:05] now
[39:06] think about this
[39:09] abel offered unto god a more excellent
[39:10] sacrifice than cain
[39:13] it wasn't
[39:14] that there was more value in one than
[39:17] the other as far as material goods
[39:20] keynes could have been actually more
[39:21] costly than abel's
[39:24] it wasn't that was better in appearance
[39:26] it wasn't better in effort it wasn't
[39:28] that it was it was better by revelation
[39:31] because it was the sacrifice that met
[39:33] the season the hour it was a revelation
[39:35] of the word for that day
[39:38] and so his sacrifice was more excellent
[39:40] than cain by which he obtained witness
[39:42] that he was righteous
[39:44] god testifying of his gifts and by it
[39:47] being dead yet speaketh amen so now god
[39:51] was testifying that this is right and
[39:54] this is wrong
[39:56] god was not saying i don't like fruit
[40:00] i don't like your effort i don't like
[40:03] your all he was not saying that amen he
[40:06] said abel's was a more excellent
[40:07] sacrifice he didn't say this wasn't
[40:09] excellent amen his was more excellent
[40:11] because it was fitting to the hour it
[40:13] was by revelation it was because of his
[40:16] understanding it was because of a
[40:18] revelation that god gave abel that cain
[40:20] could not receive and by the revelation
[40:22] it put him in the action and his action
[40:24] was a vindication of what he believed
[40:29] and when it came that way god vindicated
[40:32] god accepted it and vindicated knowledge
[40:34] that he was righteous
[40:37] because he could receive revelation
[40:41] in the message thirst
[40:45] brother bram says we always say today
[40:47] people try to say we compare
[40:49] we've got to compare bible leaf with
[40:51] bible leave scripture with scripture
[40:53] that isn't the truth
[40:56] i didn't say it brother branham said it
[40:59] that isn't the truth no it isn't the
[41:02] truth the greek word means this and this
[41:04] means that the greeks themselves way
[41:07] back in the nineteenth council and then
[41:08] writers back in there they had different
[41:10] forms one believed this way this greek
[41:12] scholar meant this and the other one
[41:14] said that this one meant it this way and
[41:16] they fussed over it we don't need
[41:18] interpretation of greek scholars or
[41:20] greek words
[41:22] to know him is life
[41:24] the person christ himself amen
[41:28] i want you to catch that phrase to know
[41:30] him as life amen that's that's our part
[41:32] of our opening scripture this is eternal
[41:34] life to know god and to know jesus
[41:36] christ to know him as life the person of
[41:39] christ himself not comparing it's a
[41:42] revelation that god built his church
[41:44] upon and if we don't build upon the same
[41:47] church the bible said abel by faith and
[41:49] faith is a divine revelation see faith
[41:52] is a divine revelation all right this
[41:54] whole thing is built upon the revelation
[41:56] then and unless this is revealed to you
[41:59] jesus said i thank thee father that thou
[42:01] has hid these things from the wise of
[42:03] this world and revealed it to babes such
[42:05] as we'll learn see now the whole thing
[42:07] is built there you've got to know the
[42:10] person
[42:13] so to know him as life brother i'm
[42:15] saying it's not comparing bible leaf
[42:18] with bible leaf in scripture with
[42:19] scripture and original uh context with
[42:22] original god that's not it it comes by a
[42:25] divine revelation amen because
[42:27] everybody's comparing scripture with
[42:29] scripture and coming up with different
[42:31] interpretations of what it means and
[42:33] they one be one will one will be more
[42:35] qualified than the one before have more
[42:37] degrees longer studied whatever amen and
[42:40] they're coming up with different
[42:41] interpretations that's not it but it's
[42:44] to know him as life amen not to know
[42:46] about him but to know him
[42:51] in jehovah jireh he says and the
[42:53] christianity is misrepresented to people
[42:57] all right christianity is misrepresented
[42:59] to people
[43:01] christianity has been represented to
[43:03] people as a declaration of creed
[43:06] christianity is a living being jesus
[43:09] christ the resurrected god that's alive
[43:12] and among us now christianity is a
[43:15] person not a creed
[43:18] to know him is life
[43:20] not even know his word that isn't life
[43:22] know him and he is the word oh get what
[43:26] he said amen to know him his life not
[43:29] even know his word
[43:33] i know this bible
[43:35] but do you know the person of the bible
[43:39] do you know who the bible is written
[43:40] about do you know who the bible is
[43:42] written for amen or do you just know the
[43:46] the print on paper or do you know who
[43:49] who this is all about amen
[43:53] he said to know him his life not even
[43:55] know his word that isn't life to know
[43:58] him and he is the word
[44:01] i thought it said not to know the word
[44:02] but he is the word so we have to know
[44:04] the word you have to know the person of
[44:06] the word not the letter of the word you
[44:08] can know the letter of the word and miss
[44:09] the person of the word you can know the
[44:12] statistics
[44:14] you can know the profile
[44:17] but to know a person is
[44:20] different to know
[44:23] uh to know about a person and to know a
[44:26] person are light years apart
[44:31] we can know we can take all kinds of
[44:34] people from history george washington
[44:36] and abraham lincoln and we could have
[44:38] volumes written about them in biography
[44:40] upon biography and we can know all about
[44:43] them but to know them is different than
[44:45] know about them
[44:47] how firm was abraham lincoln's handshake
[44:52] how was george washington's voice
[44:55] what was his spirit like when you were
[44:57] in his presence
[44:59] did of a calm way or did he have a
[45:00] nervous way about him
[45:02] did he make you feel welcome or did he
[45:04] put you on edge
[45:06] was he gentle with his touch in general
[45:08] with his demeanor was he harsh amen
[45:13] we know all about george washington if
[45:14] you live in america and you had to study
[45:16] in school you know all about george
[45:18] washington but you don't know him
[45:21] his wife knew him his children knew him
[45:23] his friends knew him but you didn't know
[45:24] him
[45:27] and that's why to read historical jesus
[45:29] christ amen is not knowing him
[45:32] to read about him walking by the sea of
[45:34] galilee about him breaking the fish in
[45:36] the load about him telling them to cast
[45:39] their net on the other side that is not
[45:40] knowing him that is knowing about him
[45:44] and most people are content knowing
[45:46] about him most of christianity they know
[45:49] about him amen but god doesn't want us
[45:51] to know about him he wants us to know
[45:53] him amen the message didn't come to know
[45:55] about him the message came to know him
[45:58] personally the person of the word the
[46:00] person that walked the sea of galilee
[46:02] the person that cried unto peter cast
[46:04] dinette on the other side that same
[46:06] person wants to reveal himself to you
[46:08] and i
[46:09] he wants to be known personally
[46:11] intimately he wants to be felt he wants
[46:14] you to know him
[46:17] and to know him as life
[46:21] see the denominations teach to know
[46:23] about him is
[46:26] life that right
[46:29] if you know all that he did
[46:31] and where he was
[46:34] and the sacrifice that he made do you
[46:36] know about him that's life but not
[46:37] knowing about him but knowing him
[46:41] and if i know him
[46:43] then i have the one who said casternet
[46:46] on the other side
[46:48] i have that here
[46:51] the one amen who cried out
[46:54] in gethsemane and surrendered his will
[46:56] to the father he's here
[46:59] the one that hung on calvary and bled
[47:01] and died for my sins and the sins of the
[47:03] world the one who paid the price of my
[47:05] redemption he's here amen
[47:08] to know him now is to know the same one
[47:11] that was there
[47:13] but but we can just show historical god
[47:16] and say no about him amen but if you
[47:19] refuse him amen how do you get him who
[47:22] died on calvary you receive him today
[47:25] he's the person of the word the message
[47:27] of the hour it's christ he's here to
[47:29] reveal himself to a people
[47:32] and he wants to be known
[47:36] amen it's more than doctrines
[47:40] it's more than creeds
[47:43] it's a person
[47:45] it's a life
[47:48] we
[47:49] we can make the message so many
[47:51] different things
[47:52] we can make it a camp an idea a
[47:55] philosophy
[47:57] we can make it a personal mechanism for
[48:01] whatever accolades and praise
[48:04] we could make the message a place to
[48:06] hide
[48:11] but that's not what it was given for
[48:14] that's not why it's coming this hour
[48:16] it's come so that we can know him
[48:19] and to know him is life
[48:22] i want to know him personally
[48:25] i want to know
[48:27] if i could just say it this way
[48:29] i want to know not just about him but i
[48:32] want to know how soft his touch is
[48:36] i want to know how he deals person to
[48:38] person
[48:40] i want to know when he when he comes to
[48:43] me in prayer and he comforts me when i'm
[48:46] nervous i don't want to just know about
[48:48] him i want to know him
[48:51] i want to know the living god amen
[48:54] see
[48:57] the jews
[48:58] they had the same opportunity you and i
[49:00] have
[49:03] how many believe jesus is here
[49:06] the person of the word is the son of man
[49:07] he's here
[49:09] well the jews had the same opportunity
[49:11] you and i have
[49:13] they were there in the day of his coming
[49:15] he come as the son of man he was there
[49:18] embodied in a single body of flesh and
[49:20] he was there among them amen and they
[49:22] knew about him
[49:24] but when he presented himself they
[49:26] didn't want to know him
[49:28] they wanted to keep knowing about him
[49:31] and they loved knowing about him but
[49:34] couldn't know that they didn't want to
[49:36] know him they had no desire for him they
[49:39] only had desire for the information
[49:40] about him
[49:42] they loved isaiah's prophecy but they
[49:44] didn't love the fulfillment of isaiah's
[49:46] prophecy
[49:48] so they were embracing isaiah's prophecy
[49:50] and loving the prophecy but when the
[49:52] fulfillment of the prophecy came and
[49:54] they were to embrace it they didn't want
[49:56] to embrace the fulfillment they wanted
[49:58] to stay amen with the prophecy
[50:00] amen
[50:03] amen
[50:05] and so
[50:07] jesus was constantly
[50:10] in turmoil with the religious leaders
[50:12] and the pharisees because not only did
[50:14] they not want to embrace him they didn't
[50:17] want anybody else to embrace him either
[50:19] they didn't want to know him and they
[50:20] didn't want anybody else to know him
[50:22] they wanted to hold everybody into a
[50:24] historical understanding of jesus christ
[50:27] because the historical understanding
[50:29] kept them in power
[50:32] made them needed
[50:35] they were needed they were the
[50:37] authorities they were the ones with the
[50:39] understanding they were the ones
[50:40] teaching they were the ones giving out
[50:42] the information they were the ones
[50:44] reading the stats
[50:46] he's five foot six
[50:49] 130 pounds
[50:53] they're giving out the statistics
[50:55] but there's the person
[50:57] they said stay away from him i'll keep
[50:59] giving you statistics
[51:02] yes
[51:03] see the message can be about statistics
[51:07] it could be about information but that's
[51:08] not why it came
[51:11] it came to introduce us to the person
[51:15] let's look at matthew 23 i just want to
[51:18] look at some of this dialogue with jesus
[51:20] christ and the pharisees
[51:32] matthew 23
[51:34] and 23
[51:38] in matthew 23 23 he says now woe unto
[51:41] you scribes and pharisees hypocrites
[51:44] if you pay tithe of men and anise and
[51:47] and cumin and have omitted the
[51:49] weightier matters of the law judgment
[51:52] mercy and faith
[51:54] and these oughts you have done and not
[51:56] to leave the other undone
[51:58] you blind guides which strain at a gnat
[52:00] and swallow a camel woe unto you scribes
[52:03] pharisees hypocrites for you make clean
[52:05] the outside of the cup of the platter
[52:07] but within they are full of extortions
[52:09] in excess thou blind pharisee cleanse
[52:12] first that which is within the cup and
[52:14] the platter that the outside of them may
[52:16] be clean also woe unto you scribes
[52:18] pharisees hypocrites for you are like
[52:20] unto white sepulchres which indeed
[52:22] appear beautiful outward but are within
[52:24] full of dead men's bones and all
[52:27] uncleanness
[52:30] they have the appearance
[52:32] of keeping all the word amen
[52:35] they looked like they were keepers of
[52:37] the word they looked like they were
[52:39] lovers of the word
[52:41] and they kept the order they paid tithes
[52:45] of mint and cumin and all of these
[52:48] things they were doing outward works we
[52:50] know that he admonished them because he
[52:52] rebuked them because you know they were
[52:54] blowing a trumpet when they come to pay
[52:56] money into the offering so that all
[52:58] would see and we know all of these they
[52:59] had all the form and all the structure
[53:02] of loving god remember when it really
[53:04] come down to the person himself made
[53:06] flesh they didn't love him they just
[53:08] loved the order and the structure
[53:10] because the order and the structure gave
[53:11] them a position gave them security gave
[53:14] them something
[53:16] and he says you know the law
[53:19] you understand the law as far as pay
[53:22] your tithe give an offering dress right
[53:25] don't don't do this and do that you know
[53:27] the law but you've missed the real heart
[53:30] of it or he said the the weightier
[53:32] matters of the law which is judgment
[53:35] mercy and faith
[53:38] you missed
[53:40] you missed the deeper meaning you got
[53:42] the outside form and then all that
[53:45] became important was the outside form
[53:47] amen but the old testament wasn't
[53:48] written to give an outside form it was
[53:50] to give an understanding of god and so
[53:52] that when he would come we would see
[53:54] this matches that amen the character i
[53:57] find in the law is the character i find
[53:59] in jesus christ
[54:02] because the law contained judgment and
[54:05] mercy and faith
[54:07] but that wasn't important to them
[54:09] anymore what was important is all the
[54:11] outside form and the structure
[54:14] not the deeper not the character of the
[54:17] word what became important was the
[54:20] outside visual of the word but not the
[54:23] character of the word
[54:26] i wanna
[54:27] i wanna say i don't wanna fall into this
[54:29] trap again
[54:31] to where we can go and look at
[54:33] everything the prophet gave us and see
[54:35] it as another structure women dress this
[54:38] way men conduct themselves this way
[54:40] structure your church this way have your
[54:42] services there's a length of time the
[54:44] order of the service dress this way look
[54:46] this way do all of these things and get
[54:49] the outward things all right and think
[54:51] we're safe because we're message
[54:53] believers but there was a deeper meaning
[54:55] to all of that amen
[54:57] and none of that is wrong jesus says
[55:00] you ought not to have forsaken those but
[55:02] done these two
[55:04] he didn't say you wasted all your time
[55:07] and paying your tithe and giving
[55:08] offering and dressing right and doing no
[55:10] he says you left the weightier matters
[55:13] of the law amen you didn't get to the
[55:15] heart of the matter that was the real
[55:17] character and nature of god you've got
[55:19] all the outside form and structure
[55:21] because the outside form and structure
[55:23] is all that mattered to you
[55:28] that's why you can have individuals that
[55:31] can dress right
[55:33] go to church right
[55:35] read the message and they're miserable
[55:37] people
[55:41] they're hateful
[55:43] they're critical
[55:45] judgmental
[55:47] can't get along with others
[55:52] but they dress right they go to church
[55:54] every time the doors are open they're
[55:56] there 30 minutes early they never miss
[55:58] paying their tithes
[56:02] because man wants a structure man wants
[56:05] a form but god's trying to give himself
[56:10] and sometimes instead of getting him we
[56:12] get the structure amen we don't the
[56:14] structure structure's perfect there's
[56:16] nothing wrong with the structure if you
[56:18] get him you want the structure too amen
[56:20] you want everything that he is amen but
[56:23] the whole point was to get him and if
[56:24] you don't get him you've missed it all
[56:27] right
[56:28] these pharisees these scribes they had
[56:31] all of the law they had it into detail
[56:34] but they missed him so i asked what was
[56:36] the point of all their study what was
[56:38] the point of their tithe paying what was
[56:40] the point of their loud prayers on the
[56:42] street corner what was the point of the
[56:43] years at school and the years of
[56:45] sacrificial labor and wearing all the
[56:47] right clothes it all come to not at the
[56:50] end because they didn't want the person
[56:51] of the word they just wanted the form
[56:53] and structure of the word
[56:59] amen
[57:02] god didn't come in this last day to give
[57:04] us another form of structure he come to
[57:05] give us himself
[57:08] and he wants a people that loves him
[57:11] and if we love him we love everything
[57:12] about him
[57:14] we love him we love coming to church
[57:15] early and preparing ourselves for the
[57:17] word
[57:18] not as a form but as love
[57:22] we love him we love dressing ourselves
[57:23] in a way that pleases him because we
[57:25] love him
[57:26] not the structure of the form but we get
[57:28] him and we get him we know him we know
[57:31] what he likes we know why the prophet
[57:33] said these things because we know the
[57:35] person of the word we know this is his
[57:37] character we know this is what he likes
[57:39] this is this is how he would dress
[57:41] himself in this body of life so i do it
[57:43] because i understand who it is that i'm
[57:46] worshiping
[57:48] and so my worship amen becomes a
[57:51] reflection of my faith
[57:55] hallelujah
[57:58] let's go to matthew 15.
[58:07] verse 1
[58:17] then came to jesus scribes and pharisees
[58:19] which were of jerusalem saying why do
[58:21] thy disciples transgress the tradition
[58:23] of the elders for they wash not their
[58:25] hands when they eat bread
[58:27] but he answered and said unto them why
[58:29] do you also transgress the commandment
[58:31] of god by your tradition
[58:33] for god commanded saying honor thy
[58:35] father and mother and he that curseth
[58:37] father or mother let him die the death
[58:39] but you say whosoever shall say his
[58:41] father is mother it is a gift by
[58:43] whatsoever thou mightest be profited by
[58:45] me
[58:46] and honor not his father or his mother
[58:49] he shall be free what he's saying here
[58:51] is is there's a commandment in the law
[58:54] to honor your father and your mother but
[58:56] if the money that you would give them to
[58:58] help support them you give it as an
[59:00] offering to god the
[59:02] the priest and the pharisees and the
[59:03] scribes they were teaching that you're
[59:05] free you no longer have to honor your
[59:06] father and your mother because you did
[59:07] something better you gave it to the
[59:09] treasury
[59:10] that's what this is saying
[59:12] and jesus is condemning them for that
[59:15] kind of thinking
[59:17] because what that kind of thinking does
[59:19] is promoting the system but missing the
[59:21] very character of god god said honor
[59:24] your father and your mother why it
[59:26] matches his character to honor amen
[59:29] those that you come from honor mother
[59:30] and father i honor the weak or honor
[59:32] those in need but the pharisees and
[59:35] sadducees scribes they they had changed
[59:37] it to now if you give that as a gift to
[59:40] god then you're free you no longer have
[59:42] to help support your parents
[59:46] you can see
[59:48] how all the sudden keeping a structure
[59:51] or a form can become evil
[59:56] because now god gave a commandment to to
[59:59] honor your father and your mother amen
[1:00:01] because god has character amen and god
[1:00:04] through the law was displaying his
[1:00:06] character and he says honor father and
[1:00:08] mother they had this form they so loved
[1:00:11] the form and ritual of worship that they
[1:00:13] said you can forsake your father and
[1:00:16] mother if you support the form and the
[1:00:18] ritual
[1:00:22] and let them suffer
[1:00:24] and jesus condemned them for that
[1:00:27] they were trying to condemn them because
[1:00:29] his disciples didn't keep the tradition
[1:00:31] he condemned them because they didn't
[1:00:32] even keep the commandment
[1:00:36] see they caught
[1:00:38] if i could say this way they caught
[1:00:40] a rule but they missed the mind of god
[1:00:45] they caught a a a
[1:00:48] a rule or an order
[1:00:50] but they missed the person of the word
[1:00:53] they couldn't see his nature in the
[1:00:56] commandment all they could see was if we
[1:00:58] keep this form
[1:01:00] we're safe
[1:01:02] this is god this kind of worship
[1:01:07] he goes on to say let's read verse 6
[1:01:09] again in honor not his father or his
[1:01:11] mother he shall be free thus have you
[1:01:13] made the commandment of god of none
[1:01:15] effect by your traditions
[1:01:17] ye hypocrites well did isaiah prophesy
[1:01:20] of you saying this people draw nigh unto
[1:01:22] me with their mouth and honoreth me with
[1:01:24] their lips but their heart is far from
[1:01:26] me
[1:01:27] but in vain they do worship me teaching
[1:01:29] for doctrines the commandments of men
[1:01:32] so isaiah had said they honor me with
[1:01:35] their lips
[1:01:37] amen but their heart is far from me
[1:01:40] so what did god care about most the
[1:01:42] honor with the lips or the heart
[1:01:45] did he care about the form of structure
[1:01:48] the outward paying of tithes or did he
[1:01:50] care about the heart amen what you were
[1:01:53] on the inside and what you believed amen
[1:01:56] let's go to micah chapter 6.
[1:02:00] i want to read just a couple places in
[1:02:01] the old testament
[1:02:14] in micah chapter 6
[1:02:16] verse 6.
[1:02:21] wherewith shall i come before the lord
[1:02:23] and bow myself before the high god
[1:02:25] shall i come before him with burnt
[1:02:27] offerings with calves of a year old will
[1:02:30] the lord be pleased with thousands of
[1:02:32] rams or with ten thousands of rivers of
[1:02:35] oil
[1:02:36] shall i give my firstborn for my
[1:02:38] transgression the fruit of my body for
[1:02:40] the sin of my soul
[1:02:41] he hath showed thee o man what is good
[1:02:44] and what and what dot the lord require
[1:02:46] of thee but to do justly to love mercy
[1:02:50] and to walk humbly with thy god
[1:02:54] you know when when saul had his own idea
[1:02:58] about worship amen and samuel had given
[1:03:00] him instructions from the lord not to
[1:03:02] keep anything alive of the amalekites
[1:03:05] and he kept you know so many good choice
[1:03:07] things choice animals and all of this
[1:03:09] and he was going to offer it as a
[1:03:11] sacrifice when samuel came to rebuke him
[1:03:13] amen he acted like he was doing a good
[1:03:15] thing because what he was doing was for
[1:03:17] the people to see and he had saved the
[1:03:19] choices and he was making an offering
[1:03:22] and this was all for god and god says
[1:03:24] it's not for me at all
[1:03:26] because what i told you was what i
[1:03:28] wanted and i wanted you to slay it all
[1:03:30] but you saved it back for yourself and
[1:03:32] not for me he said do i have delight and
[1:03:34] sacrifice amen is that what i want amen
[1:03:37] but obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:03:41] what god wanted to show love is just to
[1:03:44] catch the mind of god the instruction of
[1:03:46] god and to obey that not to come up with
[1:03:48] some idea of our own amen
[1:03:51] so here he's telling him does it will
[1:03:54] the lord be pleased with thousands of
[1:03:56] rams
[1:03:57] can we i mean can we do really really
[1:03:59] good and god be pleased no what god
[1:04:01] really wants amen more than anything is
[1:04:03] to do justly to love mercy and walk
[1:04:06] humbly with thy god
[1:04:08] what what what does that mean he wants
[1:04:10] you to catch his very character his very
[1:04:12] nature amen
[1:04:14] not just okay thousands of ram god god
[1:04:18] called for animal sacrifices let's give
[1:04:20] thousands of animal sacrifices but if
[1:04:22] you don't walk humbly if you don't have
[1:04:24] a just heart if you don't love mercy if
[1:04:27] you don't have faith what point is
[1:04:28] thousands of rams
[1:04:32] what god wanted was you to catch his
[1:04:35] heart
[1:04:36] and catch his nature
[1:04:39] to catch his person
[1:04:41] and to emulate that
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:45] the the the law was a school master to
[1:04:47] bring us to christ so that we could see
[1:04:49] the nature of god and how perfect it was
[1:04:51] and see the shortcomings that we had in
[1:04:53] ourselves so that we could come to
[1:04:55] christ amen for grace to cover those
[1:04:57] things but not to forget the very nature
[1:05:00] of god in the law
[1:05:03] so they got the form but they missed the
[1:05:05] nature
[1:05:06] and he's saying that's not what i want
[1:05:08] but i want you to do justly
[1:05:11] and to love mercy
[1:05:12] and to walk humbly
[1:05:16] if i can put in my own words
[1:05:18] i want you to catch my nature
[1:05:20] and i want you to be like me
[1:05:23] this is what i want
[1:05:26] i want you to want me
[1:05:31] proverbs 21 says proverbs 21 3 to do
[1:05:34] justice and judgment is more acceptable
[1:05:36] to the lord than sacrifice
[1:05:39] but god told us to give sacrifice death
[1:05:41] there's nothing wrong with the sacrifice
[1:05:42] god told to give sacrifice but he says
[1:05:44] to do justice and judgment is more
[1:05:46] acceptable to the lord than sacrifice
[1:05:50] because if you do the sacrifice and
[1:05:52] don't emulate god and your character and
[1:05:54] his nature then the sacrifice doesn't do
[1:05:56] any good
[1:05:58] this is what the jews proved they had
[1:06:00] mastered the law they had mastered the
[1:06:03] order they had even added to it they got
[1:06:05] so good at god's order and god structure
[1:06:08] they could add to god's order and to
[1:06:09] god's structure
[1:06:11] but they missed the person
[1:06:14] they missed the nature of god they
[1:06:16] missed who he was
[1:06:19] they got the law but they missed the law
[1:06:21] giver
[1:06:23] brother brahm says in christ the mystery
[1:06:25] of god revealed but when christ takes
[1:06:28] takes you over he'll express that word
[1:06:30] right through you because it's him
[1:06:34] he is the word
[1:06:35] and then you can see the expression of
[1:06:36] christ not some illusion of some sort
[1:06:39] but a real genuine christ expressing
[1:06:42] himself right through you how
[1:06:44] beautiful
[1:06:46] amen
[1:06:47] in the message there's two quotes that i
[1:06:49] want to read and they were preached as
[1:06:51] three days apart one's
[1:06:53] 1961 they're both in 61. the first one
[1:06:55] is the god had explained and i want to
[1:06:57] read these two quotes together and then
[1:06:59] talk about them
[1:07:00] so now i said to brother schism and
[1:07:02] brother ness to answer your question i
[1:07:03] said now i do not take either side with
[1:07:06] you brethren i know as long as you fuss
[1:07:08] you're both wrong because i would rather
[1:07:10] be wrong in my doctrine and right in my
[1:07:12] heart than to be right in my doctrine
[1:07:14] and wrong in my heart
[1:07:16] see i said after all it's your heart's
[1:07:18] condition
[1:07:21] amen
[1:07:22] it goes on to say three days later and
[1:07:24] the message getting in the spirit
[1:07:27] says you've got to come back and we got
[1:07:28] to be one i don't care if the man's
[1:07:31] wrong if he's wrong and sincere in his
[1:07:32] heart and you're right in your belief
[1:07:35] and wrong in the acting the way you're
[1:07:38] acting
[1:07:40] i'd rather be in his place than in yours
[1:07:47] praise god
[1:07:49] whose place would you rather be in
[1:07:52] simon
[1:07:54] who invited jesus but gave him no
[1:07:56] welcome
[1:07:57] or the prostitute who washed his feet
[1:08:04] read this again you've got to come back
[1:08:06] we've got to be one i don't care if the
[1:08:09] man's wrong if he's wrong and sincere in
[1:08:11] his heart and you're right in your
[1:08:12] belief
[1:08:13] and you're wrong and acting the way
[1:08:15] you're acting i'd rather be in his place
[1:08:18] than be in yours
[1:08:19] that's right i'd rather be wrong in my
[1:08:22] doctrine and right in my heart god will
[1:08:24] respect it more so if a man is wrong
[1:08:26] what of it help him he needs help love
[1:08:29] him
[1:08:31] well the man is not saying you don't
[1:08:32] need doctrine that's not what he's
[1:08:34] saying
[1:08:35] but he said if i had my brothers i'd
[1:08:37] rather be right in my heart my heart
[1:08:38] right with god
[1:08:40] because correcting doctrine is easy as a
[1:08:43] revelation
[1:08:45] for god it's a snap of a finger god can
[1:08:46] give revelation whenever he wants and
[1:08:48] clear that thing up amen but if your
[1:08:50] heart's wrong your heart's wrong
[1:08:53] amen
[1:08:54] what can god do but with the right heart
[1:08:56] god can always bring more revelation
[1:08:59] and what god would rather have is he
[1:09:02] would rather have us amen with the right
[1:09:05] heart connected to him heart to heart he
[1:09:08] can fix all the wrong understanding
[1:09:10] amen and if we think that right now
[1:09:13] we're sitting here in this room all of
[1:09:14] us together and we all have the exact
[1:09:16] right understanding on everything in the
[1:09:18] message i believe we're we're
[1:09:19] self-deceived
[1:09:22] i believe there's more understanding to
[1:09:24] come how can you say that brother chad
[1:09:25] because i can turn around and look five
[1:09:27] years back and say there were some
[1:09:28] things i had a wrong understanding on
[1:09:30] but by the grace of god i believed my
[1:09:32] heart was right and when my heart was
[1:09:33] right god kept unfolding himself more
[1:09:35] and more and more
[1:09:38] so right now what i want more than
[1:09:40] anything is i want him i want the person
[1:09:42] of the word i want him who's revealing
[1:09:44] himself revelation by revelation i'm not
[1:09:47] interested in just getting doctrines
[1:09:49] right
[1:09:51] because i can get doctrines right and if
[1:09:54] i'm wrong in my heart what good is
[1:09:56] having doctrines right
[1:09:57] [Applause]
[1:09:59] now listen you're talking to somebody
[1:10:01] i'm i'm speaking to somebody i love to
[1:10:03] have doctrines right
[1:10:05] so for me to say this is a big statement
[1:10:07] amen i'm not flippant about doctrines i
[1:10:09] love the teaching of the message i love
[1:10:11] when it lines up i love when it's right
[1:10:13] i love when you can see it amen but but
[1:10:15] for me if i can even have wrong
[1:10:18] understanding and something out of the
[1:10:19] message but if my heart is right god can
[1:10:22] correct my understanding but if my heart
[1:10:24] is wrong before god where am i at
[1:10:27] who will help me
[1:10:30] see
[1:10:31] the the
[1:10:33] the pharisees
[1:10:35] were right in their doctrine
[1:10:37] and that's somewhat debatable
[1:10:40] but they were wrong in their hearts
[1:10:43] but the woman in samaria
[1:10:46] she had a heart desire to know god
[1:10:51] she was a woman who wasn't scholar
[1:10:53] didn't have scholarships didn't have a
[1:10:55] position she wasn't upholding a system
[1:10:57] though she was part of a system
[1:11:02] she wanted the messiah
[1:11:04] and she wanted to know how to worship
[1:11:08] the pharisees didn't want anything but
[1:11:10] further validation and vindication of
[1:11:12] their own self-righteousness
[1:11:15] they wanted to keep the system going
[1:11:17] because the system was telling them they
[1:11:19] were right
[1:11:21] and so anything that would threaten the
[1:11:22] system they hated
[1:11:25] because the system was bringing security
[1:11:27] the system was telling them they were
[1:11:28] righteous amen because they could keep
[1:11:30] the system and keep the rules and keep
[1:11:31] the order amen and even adjust the order
[1:11:34] to suit them so they could look even
[1:11:35] better
[1:11:39] but this little woman in samaria she
[1:11:41] couldn't keep the order
[1:11:43] she couldn't keep everything right amen
[1:11:46] but inside of her
[1:11:48] there was something down on the inside
[1:11:50] that wanted the messiah and wanted to
[1:11:52] worship god and wanted to know what god
[1:11:54] wanted
[1:11:56] the pharisees were only looking into the
[1:11:58] word
[1:12:01] they were looking into the word for more
[1:12:04] self-indication
[1:12:07] but this woman was looking at the word
[1:12:09] wanting to know god
[1:12:11] and when god came on the scene the same
[1:12:14] jesus christ and flesh came to her as
[1:12:16] was speaking to the pharisees and the
[1:12:18] sadducees and the scribes and the elders
[1:12:20] and the high priest they were all
[1:12:21] calling him beelzebub she was seeing
[1:12:23] something different because they didn't
[1:12:25] care to have the messiah they only cared
[1:12:28] to have their structure
[1:12:31] but she wanted something she wanted the
[1:12:33] god who gave the law amen
[1:12:37] and when god presented himself to her
[1:12:40] she caught something
[1:12:42] and she said i perceive you're a prophet
[1:12:46] and when she said i perceive you're a
[1:12:47] prophet she didn't do like herod did do
[1:12:50] a trick show me something do a miracle
[1:12:54] she says our fathers say in this
[1:12:56] mountain we must worship but you say in
[1:12:57] jerusalem
[1:12:59] what does she want to know she want to
[1:13:01] know how does god want to be worshiped
[1:13:04] that little woman wanted to know the
[1:13:06] same thing abel wanted to know
[1:13:10] that little woman wanted to know what
[1:13:12] she was waiting on what abel was waiting
[1:13:14] on
[1:13:16] and when she caught it she caught it
[1:13:18] like abel caught it amen
[1:13:20] and what do you and i want i hope by the
[1:13:22] grace of god we want the same thing that
[1:13:24] woman wanted and what abel wanted i want
[1:13:26] to know how to please god i want to know
[1:13:28] what god wants i want to know how to
[1:13:30] love him back
[1:13:32] not how to love myself not how to look
[1:13:34] good in the eyes i want to know how to
[1:13:36] love him back i want my worship to
[1:13:38] reflect my revelation of who he is and
[1:13:40] who's here and what's going on in this
[1:13:42] hour
[1:13:44] do i want to dress right yes not so
[1:13:46] others will know that i'm right because
[1:13:48] i love him and i want to know what is in
[1:13:50] his mind and i want to act out what is
[1:13:53] in his mind
[1:13:56] not for an order or a structure but out
[1:13:58] of love
[1:14:01] and so now brother branham says these
[1:14:03] things i'd rather be right in my heart
[1:14:05] and wrong in my doctrine
[1:14:08] a man can be complete completely wrong
[1:14:10] in his doctrine
[1:14:12] amen but have the right heart you can be
[1:14:15] right in your doctrine amen but wrong in
[1:14:18] the way you're acting and i'd rather be
[1:14:20] in that man's shoes
[1:14:25] brother branham says
[1:14:27] in the marriage of the lamb
[1:14:29] now remember the first thing that we
[1:14:31] read
[1:14:33] at the beginning tonight
[1:14:34] was that revelation is christ's way of
[1:14:37] making himself known to his church
[1:14:41] amen
[1:14:42] the question is do you want to know him
[1:14:46] or do we want to know about him
[1:14:50] we can come to church
[1:14:52] and know about him
[1:14:55] it's possible
[1:14:57] it's possible and it it it doesn't
[1:14:59] matter what church
[1:15:01] good church
[1:15:02] excellent church
[1:15:04] right teaching but we can go with the
[1:15:05] attitude to know about him
[1:15:08] amen
[1:15:09] but i want to know
[1:15:11] him
[1:15:13] because to know him is life
[1:15:17] in the marriage of the lamb the prophet
[1:15:18] of god says i believe in the baptism of
[1:15:20] the holy ghost i believe in speaking in
[1:15:22] tongues but i think we lay too much
[1:15:25] emphasis on that a man can speak with
[1:15:26] tongues and a woman speak with tongues
[1:15:28] and if her life and his life doesn't
[1:15:30] compare with what tongues you're
[1:15:31] speaking in then it's the wrong tongue
[1:15:34] because the holy spirit will make you
[1:15:35] act like the bible
[1:15:37] it'll bring you to the fullness of the
[1:15:39] stature of christ
[1:15:40] you take a person that speaks with
[1:15:42] tongues enough temper to fight a buzzsaw
[1:15:44] and talk about the neighbors and
[1:15:46] everything like that why you you call
[1:15:48] that the holy ghost
[1:15:51] it cannot be no sir the holy ghost is
[1:15:53] meekness joy peace longsuffering
[1:15:56] goodness gentleness patience faith the
[1:15:59] holy ghost that's the fruit of the
[1:16:00] spirit
[1:16:01] that the holy spirit bears in the church
[1:16:03] of the living god sweetness humbleness
[1:16:05] humility love one for another long
[1:16:08] suffering
[1:16:09] i mean not just the outside acts but the
[1:16:12] inward life
[1:16:15] back in christ is the mystery of god
[1:16:16] revealed he says because
[1:16:19] it just gradually let loose as it as it
[1:16:21] did down through the prophets and so
[1:16:23] forth till it was perfectly made known
[1:16:26] the godhead bodily in christ
[1:16:30] and now the christ in the church is just
[1:16:32] being made known
[1:16:34] before the old testament it was
[1:16:36] gradually let out the revelation the
[1:16:38] revelation the revelation until it come
[1:16:40] to the fullness that god had bodily in
[1:16:42] christ but now christ in the church is
[1:16:45] being now the revelation is the person
[1:16:48] of the word he himself here amen in the
[1:16:52] church
[1:16:54] the whole thing is the revelation of god
[1:16:57] to take eve back to her right position
[1:16:59] again with her husband
[1:17:01] notice and god is the husband of the
[1:17:03] church in the church is his bride
[1:17:06] now god is bringing a revelation but the
[1:17:09] revelation that he's bringing is christ
[1:17:11] in you the hope of glory
[1:17:15] amen and that christ in you
[1:17:18] is not information
[1:17:21] it is not a doctrine
[1:17:24] it is not a teaching
[1:17:26] it is a life
[1:17:29] it is not paying tithe
[1:17:33] it's being united with melchizedek the
[1:17:35] receiver of dies
[1:17:37] it's more than just the structure amen
[1:17:40] it's more than just the form it's the
[1:17:42] person amen
[1:17:45] so he goes on to say
[1:17:48] now peter when he called said thou art
[1:17:50] christ the son of the living god
[1:17:52] now watch blessed art thou simon barjona
[1:17:55] says which means son of jonah blessed
[1:17:57] art thou for flesh and blood never
[1:17:58] revealed this to you you never learned
[1:18:00] it from some school but my father which
[1:18:02] is in heaven hath revealed it to you
[1:18:04] notice what he saith them upon this rock
[1:18:07] that's peter the predestinated seed of
[1:18:09] god that had received this light and
[1:18:11] given the keys to the kingdom upon this
[1:18:13] rock of revelation of who jesus christ
[1:18:15] is he is the full manifested god upon
[1:18:18] this rock not a father son and holy
[1:18:20] ghost and him being the second person
[1:18:22] upon this rock i'll build my church and
[1:18:24] the gates of hell will never shake it
[1:18:26] down never prevail against it i'll build
[1:18:29] my church upon this rock a revelation of
[1:18:31] jesus christ look
[1:18:33] christ in you makes him the center of
[1:18:36] life of the revelation
[1:18:39] christ's life in you makes him the
[1:18:41] center of the revelation christ in the
[1:18:44] bible makes the bible the complete
[1:18:45] revelation of christ christ in you makes
[1:18:48] you the complete revelation of the whole
[1:18:50] thing see what god is trying to do
[1:18:54] he's trying to bring the revelation of
[1:18:57] the mystery but the revelation of the
[1:18:59] mystery is in you
[1:19:01] the revelation of the mystery is not on
[1:19:04] a tape
[1:19:06] that's the information the information
[1:19:08] we can be quickened to revelation but
[1:19:10] the revelation is a life inside of you
[1:19:13] the message amen the message is not just
[1:19:17] print on paper or a voice on a tape amen
[1:19:21] that's the means by which god preached
[1:19:23] the message amen but the message must
[1:19:26] become a revelation and that revelation
[1:19:28] must transpire into a life and that life
[1:19:31] must live out of you the message is not
[1:19:34] just what was preached the message now
[1:19:36] is the life of jesus christ in a
[1:19:38] mini-member body
[1:19:40] and it's not a structure or a form you
[1:19:43] can have the form and it can be an empty
[1:19:45] house
[1:19:47] but that's not the
[1:19:48] message the message is not the form of
[1:19:52] structure of a church and the structure
[1:19:54] of a message and saying we're a message
[1:19:56] church because we you know we don't
[1:19:58] women don't cut our hair we have long
[1:20:00] dresses we
[1:20:02] we
[1:20:02] we talk about brother branham we
[1:20:04] recognize him as a prophet amen that
[1:20:06] that doesn't make us a message church
[1:20:08] amen what makes us a message church is
[1:20:11] the message christ himself the son of
[1:20:13] man alive inside the people that makes
[1:20:15] it a message church
[1:20:19] so it's not about going back to a
[1:20:21] pharisee form a religion or denomination
[1:20:23] amen to have a structure and the
[1:20:25] structure set up right therefore this is
[1:20:28] the message that is not the message that
[1:20:29] can be a messy structure but that's not
[1:20:31] the message
[1:20:33] the message is christ in you the hope of
[1:20:34] glory
[1:20:37] it must be more than the law
[1:20:40] it must be the character that was
[1:20:42] contained in the law
[1:20:44] can we give
[1:20:46] thousands of
[1:20:48] sacrificed rams
[1:20:50] and rivers of oil
[1:20:53] no
[1:20:54] just do justly and have mercy
[1:20:57] and walk meekly and humbly before your
[1:20:59] god just have the life amen
[1:21:03] if you have the life will you offer the
[1:21:04] appropriate sacrifice without a doubt
[1:21:07] but it can't be an empty form
[1:21:10] it's got to be a life
[1:21:13] he said christ in you makes you the
[1:21:15] complete revelation of the whole thing
[1:21:19] christ in the bible makes christ a
[1:21:21] revelation of the bible
[1:21:24] christ in you makes you the revelation
[1:21:26] of the whole thing
[1:21:28] it brings us all the way back to genesis
[1:21:30] because brother bam said the seventh
[1:21:31] seal was revealed all the way back in
[1:21:32] the beginning in genesis
[1:21:34] when god was making his masterpiece and
[1:21:36] he first made the setting for the
[1:21:38] masterpiece and that first part of that
[1:21:40] masterpiece came up but we know he was
[1:21:42] making a masterpiece family the first
[1:21:44] part came up adam but within adam was
[1:21:46] the second part of the masterpiece and
[1:21:48] it was broke out and formed and united
[1:21:50] back together and god said it is very
[1:21:52] good
[1:21:54] what was that when those two you united
[1:21:56] back together
[1:21:58] amen the masterpiece was complete
[1:22:01] when the masterpiece was complete
[1:22:03] it was finished what was it it was the
[1:22:05] revelation of the whole thing
[1:22:08] adam was the revelation of a son of god
[1:22:11] but within within adam was another
[1:22:13] revelation
[1:22:15] within adam was a revelation of the wife
[1:22:18] and the two come back together to make
[1:22:19] the perfect masterpiece family and that
[1:22:22] became the revelation of the whole thing
[1:22:25] christ in the bible
[1:22:28] makes the bible the revelation of christ
[1:22:31] christ in you the bridegroom and the
[1:22:33] bride united back together makes it the
[1:22:35] revelation of the whole thing back to
[1:22:38] the mind of god what god wanted in the
[1:22:40] very beginning he wanted
[1:22:42] male and female expression together as
[1:22:45] one
[1:22:47] he goes on to say
[1:22:49] what is the new birth then well brother
[1:22:52] branham what is the new birth it is the
[1:22:54] revelation of jesus christ personally
[1:22:57] to you amen not you joined a church you
[1:23:00] shook a hand you done something
[1:23:02] different you set a creed you promised
[1:23:04] to live by a coat of rules but christ
[1:23:06] the bible he is the word that was
[1:23:08] revealed to you and no matter what
[1:23:10] anybody says what takes place it's
[1:23:12] christ pastor priest whatever it might
[1:23:14] be it's christ and you that is the
[1:23:16] revelation that the church was built
[1:23:18] upon
[1:23:21] he says in the church age book in the
[1:23:22] revelation of jesus christ he said how
[1:23:24] we need revelation by the spirit
[1:23:28] we don't need a new bible we don't need
[1:23:30] a new translation though some are very
[1:23:32] good and i'm not against them but we
[1:23:34] need the revelation of the spirit and
[1:23:36] thank god we can have what we need for
[1:23:39] god wants to reveal his word to us by
[1:23:41] his spirit
[1:23:42] may god begin by his spirit to give us
[1:23:45] continuous
[1:23:47] life-giving and prevailing revelation
[1:23:50] oh if the church could only get a fresh
[1:23:53] revelation and become by it the living
[1:23:56] word manifested
[1:23:58] we would do the greater works and
[1:24:00] glorify god our father in heaven
[1:24:03] you see
[1:24:04] revelation
[1:24:06] is christ's way
[1:24:07] of of
[1:24:09] giving himself revealing himself to his
[1:24:11] church
[1:24:13] but he says oh if the church could only
[1:24:16] get a fresh revelation
[1:24:18] and become by it by what by the
[1:24:22] revelation
[1:24:23] what will the revelation produce become
[1:24:25] by it the living word
[1:24:28] manifested
[1:24:30] we would do the greater works and
[1:24:32] glorify god
[1:24:33] our father
[1:24:35] in heaven
[1:24:36] we cannot do the greater works and
[1:24:39] glorify god without revelation
[1:24:42] it must be the revelation of jesus
[1:24:44] christ personally to each one of us
[1:24:50] back again in christ is the mystery of
[1:24:51] god revealed he says but the revelation
[1:24:53] came through the blood see
[1:24:55] and through jesus christ who is the
[1:24:57] blood of god creative blood in the womb
[1:24:59] of mary and paul knew him by revelation
[1:25:02] that's how we know him today is is only
[1:25:05] the only way you could know him not say
[1:25:07] i'm methodist that means nothing i'm
[1:25:09] baptist that means nothing i'm catholic
[1:25:11] that means nothing but by the revelation
[1:25:14] that god has revealed the word to you he
[1:25:16] is the word in the word how you know
[1:25:19] it's revealed it lives itself and
[1:25:21] expresses himself through
[1:25:24] you do you know the revelation because
[1:25:27] the revelation takes over
[1:25:30] how do you know it's a revelation of
[1:25:31] christ revealed to you personally
[1:25:33] because that revelation takes over and
[1:25:35] starts living his life through me
[1:25:37] now it's not the form or the structure
[1:25:40] but it's something deeper
[1:25:42] now it's not the outward form of keeping
[1:25:45] a rule or keeping an order or being
[1:25:47] obedient but now there's something
[1:25:49] inside a life on the inside by the
[1:25:52] revelation of jesus christ now pushing
[1:25:54] out the very life of jesus christ and
[1:25:56] when it pushes out the life we'll keep
[1:25:58] the same form the same structure the
[1:26:01] same dress the same church order the
[1:26:03] same all of that but now it's not a
[1:26:05] shell hiding emptiness but it's a life
[1:26:07] on the inside coming up and manifesting
[1:26:09] the life on the outside
[1:26:12] there are there are two things amen
[1:26:15] there's the form of the message
[1:26:17] and then there's the life of the message
[1:26:21] the life of the message will manifest
[1:26:23] the same form
[1:26:25] but the form of the message can never
[1:26:27] produce the life
[1:26:30] we
[1:26:31] we have to be careful
[1:26:33] that we're not just teaching form
[1:26:37] but that we're sticking with the
[1:26:38] revelation of the word that god can
[1:26:40] quicken a revelation to somebody
[1:26:43] because we can keep form but if we keep
[1:26:45] form all we're going to do is make the
[1:26:47] deacons really busy
[1:26:50] and the minister's trying to keep
[1:26:51] everybody informed because we want to be
[1:26:53] a message church we want to be message
[1:26:54] believers and to be a message believer
[1:26:56] we dress this way we don't go here we
[1:26:58] don't watch this we don't
[1:27:01] but that's not what we want friends
[1:27:02] that's nothing i have no desire to have
[1:27:05] anything anything to do with any of that
[1:27:08] what i want to do is preach jesus christ
[1:27:10] amen and he himself can make a
[1:27:12] revelation in the hearts of every
[1:27:13] believer and out of the heart can bloom
[1:27:16] the life of jesus christ and the life of
[1:27:18] jesus christ will dress right won't go
[1:27:20] to those places won't watch those things
[1:27:22] won't look at these things won't listen
[1:27:24] to that it's christ amen living his own
[1:27:26] life through you and i it's not a form
[1:27:28] or a structure it's a living word it's a
[1:27:30] living god we become living epistles
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:27:36] to me that's the message
[1:27:39] that's the purpose of revelation amen to
[1:27:42] make himself known
[1:27:44] he makes himself known to us but then
[1:27:47] through us he makes himself known to the
[1:27:48] world
[1:27:49] that's what the bride is to be in this
[1:27:51] last days
[1:27:53] i
[1:27:54] brother ben said in no way he uh brother
[1:27:56] marcus he he quoted this out of the
[1:27:59] resume of the ages not for one moment do
[1:28:01] i try to preach a message amen to start
[1:28:04] a church or to have people look to me
[1:28:06] brother branham wasn't interested in
[1:28:07] another system
[1:28:10] but he said i have one purpose one goal
[1:28:12] and that's to get people into a personal
[1:28:14] relationship with jesus christ
[1:28:18] i say as a people as a church as a
[1:28:21] congregation of believers let's make
[1:28:23] that our main purpose is to get people
[1:28:24] in a personal relationship with jesus
[1:28:26] christ to preach the word to live the
[1:28:29] word to speak the word but not in a way
[1:28:32] to make another system to make another
[1:28:34] denomination to make another structure
[1:28:36] and if we all stick in this structure
[1:28:37] we're all okay
[1:28:40] the structure can never produce the life
[1:28:42] but the life will always
[1:28:45] always
[1:28:46] produce itself in a life a form
[1:28:50] i want to say god
[1:28:52] give me the deeper meaning of the word
[1:28:55] i don't want to be like cain and no i
[1:28:57] got to bring a sacrifice and i'm going
[1:28:58] to sacrifice i want to do a good job i
[1:29:00] want to make it nice i want to be
[1:29:02] acceptable to god through my sacrifice
[1:29:04] that wasn't able's motive
[1:29:07] cain's motive was to be accepted
[1:29:11] to do good job
[1:29:13] to look the part to do to do it
[1:29:15] thoroughly to be accepted but abel
[1:29:17] wanted to know what does god want
[1:29:22] and i want to say
[1:29:23] it's not about
[1:29:26] it's not about
[1:29:28] all the other things
[1:29:30] those come naturally
[1:29:32] but it's about in christ
[1:29:34] making himself known
[1:29:37] this message came to go deep inside the
[1:29:40] heart of the believer
[1:29:42] and to awaken a seed on the inside and
[1:29:44] bring the life of christ out
[1:29:47] it didn't come to make good church
[1:29:49] members
[1:29:50] but i'll tell you something
[1:29:52] if that seed ever comes alive you're
[1:29:54] going to have a good church member
[1:29:57] you're going to have a wonderful part of
[1:29:58] the body active and supportive and doing
[1:30:00] all the things that need to be done amen
[1:30:02] but it'll come from the life of jesus
[1:30:04] christ when christ reveals himself to
[1:30:06] somebody
[1:30:08] say when we study the message let's
[1:30:11] study it with all of our hearts but now
[1:30:13] let's not study it to have a structure
[1:30:15] let's study it to find him
[1:30:17] let's read it to find him let's listen
[1:30:20] to it to find him amen when we go to
[1:30:22] pray amen let's not pray just to have
[1:30:25] god fix this bless this make this better
[1:30:27] but let's find him in prayer
[1:30:30] let's study to find him let's listen to
[1:30:32] find him let's come to church to find
[1:30:34] him
[1:30:36] and to find what pleases him and to
[1:30:38] surrender our life to him
[1:30:42] god bless you friends
[1:30:44] let's just have him
[1:30:46] let's all stand
[1:30:48] tonight
[1:30:52] musicians if you come i'm going to read
[1:30:54] one more scripture to you
[1:30:56] to close
[1:30:57] out of first corinthians 13 10 you don't
[1:30:59] have to turn there i'll just read it to
[1:31:01] you
[1:31:03] but when that which is perfect has come
[1:31:06] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:31:07] away
[1:31:09] brother brandon read that portion of
[1:31:10] scripture and said but what we do have
[1:31:12] by god's grace
[1:31:13] today is the perfect interpretation of
[1:31:15] the word
[1:31:16] with divine vindication
[1:31:19] so that's the context i want to read the
[1:31:20] scripture in
[1:31:22] when that which is perfect has come then
[1:31:23] that which is in part shall be done away
[1:31:26] when i was a child i spake as a child i
[1:31:27] understood as a child i thought as a
[1:31:29] child but when you become a man i put
[1:31:31] away childish things
[1:31:33] for now we see through a glass darkly
[1:31:35] but then
[1:31:36] face to face
[1:31:39] now i know in part but then shall i know
[1:31:42] even as also
[1:31:44] i am known
[1:31:48] when
[1:31:49] when that which is perfect has come and
[1:31:51] what we do have today by god's grace is
[1:31:54] the divine the perfect interpretation of
[1:31:56] the word with divine vindication
[1:31:59] and when i look into that when it's
[1:32:01] perfect i'm no longer looking into a
[1:32:03] mere darkly
[1:32:05] but i'm looking as face to face
[1:32:11] and that i shall know
[1:32:13] even as i am known
[1:32:16] god
[1:32:17] wants us to know
[1:32:20] he sent his word so that we will look
[1:32:23] and we will see him
[1:32:25] and when we see him
[1:32:26] we will see us
[1:32:29] and we will see us in him
[1:32:31] and him
[1:32:32] in us
[1:32:35] this is far beyond a system
[1:32:38] an order
[1:32:39] a doctrine
[1:32:40] a teaching
[1:32:42] this is a million light years deeper
[1:32:45] than a doctrine or a study or a form or
[1:32:48] a structure
[1:32:50] this is us looking into the perfect
[1:32:52] interpretation of the word and seeing
[1:32:54] him
[1:32:55] and seeing us and him
[1:32:57] and him and us
[1:32:59] in that day
[1:33:00] that's this day
[1:33:02] you will know that i am you and you and
[1:33:04] me
[1:33:06] friends this is the day that he reveals
[1:33:09] himself to his bride
[1:33:11] to come into his bride to live his life
[1:33:13] through his bride
[1:33:15] the systems are dead
[1:33:18] let's not start a new one
[1:33:20] the forms and rituals and structures of
[1:33:23] religion
[1:33:24] they're over with
[1:33:27] let's not start another one
[1:33:29] let's not look for security from a group
[1:33:32] from a structure from an order or from
[1:33:34] keeping rules
[1:33:36] but let's look for a divine revelation
[1:33:38] that comes from the father that lets us
[1:33:40] know what day we're in
[1:33:42] and how he wants to be worshiped and
[1:33:43] let's yield ourselves to him and let him
[1:33:45] live his life through us for that's the
[1:33:48] manifestation of this hour
[1:33:51] amen let's bow our heads and pray
[1:33:54] lord jesus we thank you for the word
[1:33:56] you've given us
[1:33:58] god lord it's
[1:33:59] so much more than we ever dreamed so
[1:34:01] much more than we ever knew it becomes
[1:34:04] more and more all the time lord and
[1:34:07] the more we look into your perfect image
[1:34:10] lord the more we want to be like you
[1:34:13] the more we see of your character and
[1:34:15] your nature
[1:34:16] the more we want to emulate that lord
[1:34:19] but we have no strength in and of
[1:34:21] ourselves we have no ability in our own
[1:34:23] persons
[1:34:24] but it has to be you and us lord
[1:34:27] and as you continue to take the veil off
[1:34:29] of yourself and we see you lord
[1:34:32] you continue to drop the scales from our
[1:34:34] eyes
[1:34:36] and let us see you as you are
[1:34:38] lord we want to become
[1:34:40] into the image that we're beholding we
[1:34:42] want to become more like you
[1:34:44] lord i pray you would take us far beyond
[1:34:48] instrumentalities of man and governments
[1:34:50] and rules
[1:34:52] but lord bring us into a very life lord
[1:34:54] your very life
[1:34:56] bring it into us
[1:34:59] god if there's anybody here lord
[1:35:01] who has been in a form and a structure
[1:35:03] they've been raised this way or come
[1:35:05] into a structure
[1:35:07] and honored it lord and and loved it but
[1:35:09] never went deeper
[1:35:11] god i pray that you would reveal
[1:35:13] yourself to them
[1:35:15] personally lord
[1:35:17] that had become more than just a
[1:35:19] terminology become more than a
[1:35:22] set of doctrines or rules
[1:35:25] god may it be person contacting person
[1:35:29] may it be lord that you're yourself lord
[1:35:33] revealing yourself deep into the heart
[1:35:36] of your children lord may it be a a
[1:35:39] connection lord that goes beyond time
[1:35:41] lord that goes beyond the physical
[1:35:43] elements but a connection that started
[1:35:45] before time lord reconnecting again
[1:35:49] and i pray lord to bring a life lord
[1:35:51] like nothing else can bring lord there's
[1:35:53] nothing else that can bring this life
[1:35:55] but your life itself
[1:35:57] i pray god that you would make it
[1:35:59] manifest within us
[1:36:01] god live your life through us as
[1:36:02] individuals and may we bring glory and
[1:36:04] honor to your name
[1:36:06] lord may we open ourselves to you in a
[1:36:08] greater way may your word lord have
[1:36:10] preeminence in a greater way
[1:36:13] and lord would you reveal yourself to us
[1:36:15] more clearly than ever before
[1:36:18] revelation upon revelation take us
[1:36:20] higher and higher take us out of our own
[1:36:22] forms and our own ideas and far beyond
[1:36:24] our our own uh concepts lord and bring
[1:36:27] us into the very reality of your word
[1:36:30] may it live in us
[1:36:32] may we live in you
[1:36:34] i ask you bless your people lord
[1:36:36] bring quickening power to quicken all
[1:36:38] these things into a manifestation
[1:36:41] for this is the hour we know it lord
[1:36:43] but it's got to be you doing the work
[1:36:46] so now we just yield ourselves to you
[1:36:48] and ask that you would come
[1:36:50] manifest yourself afresh to us
[1:36:53] may we buy that revelation
[1:36:55] become the word manifested in this hour
[1:36:58] we love you god we ask you take your
[1:37:00] preeminence among us
[1:37:02] go with us as we leave here
[1:37:04] let us surrender to you in a greater way
[1:37:07] in jesus christ's name we pray
[1:37:09] amen
