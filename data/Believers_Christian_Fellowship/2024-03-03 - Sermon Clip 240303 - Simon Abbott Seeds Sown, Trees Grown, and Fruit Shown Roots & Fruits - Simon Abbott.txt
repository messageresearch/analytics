so now here we have this is the bride and she's kind of walking up these steps the Revelation is growing so as we're as we're going through these Church ages this this this Revelation is growing reation is growing it's growing we can't help it we we can't help it what is it's the tree that tree that's growing in us the seed is becoming more and more mature and now we get to a point here and here we have have 1963 we have 1963 and now here we have this is the rapture Rapture this one so now we know what the point of the Rapture this Revelation level has to be here it has to be here okay but we are right now and I'm just you know we're looking for the Lord's coming every day we know that but we're saying that we're here right now this is us us it's not the US I'm sorry it's just us this is now so we see this kind of time period look here here it's been this time period you know seals were broken back then nobody really knew what it was on about true it's true let's be honest see he opens the eyes of understanding at a specific point in time when the Lord was walking with him he was preaching the words and the whole time he was the word and yet they didn't have a clue what he was talking about although something on the inside was burning but they didn't even know what it was but it was just it was just like that deep calling to deep I don't understand it but I just believe it Lord but there's a specific time when his when they open their eyes amen it's beautiful and you know Revelation is given it can only be given we know the scripture Simon blessed out th Simon by Jonah not the to but the Father which is heaven Revelation is only given it can't be learned see and the rure the revelation of actually who we are and what it's all about has come kind of nowish am you know it's only now that we're truly seeing who we are mate I'm telling you the first time that I because I mean when we when the Lord brought us out from where we came from and and the Lord began the ministry it was on the back of who we are because I could kind of see who we are I was kind of getting wo hang about how can we be the bride of Christ if we're him the word says that the two shall no longer be Twain but one therefore that makes us kind to him that's what brother was saying back there but no one ever dared to say it because you being a man make S God they crucified the Lord Jesus for saying that they would have crucified the bride for doing that well and and if the Lord does not come there'll be no flesh saved why because the false Vine will crucify the bride for saying that you are God that's who we are that's where we are and the Revelation only just come now it's only just come now why mate these is the last days of the last days we are in the last day I tell you we are so close
