all that we say and do be pleasing to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen then god bless you let's take our bibles and turn to hebrews chapter 13. i want to turn there i just want to greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ and say it's good to be back home we thank you for praying for us we had a really really wonderful trip it was really good to see brother isaiah brooks again and get the fellowship with him and the saints that are there with him in des moines iowa they have a wonderful assembly there called higher ground tabernacle and and we had a great time and i really appreciated brother wesley godfrey and brother enoch dema for they went with me and it was good to have their fellowship there and and i don't know how it happened but enoch got wrangling into giving his testimony for a youth service on saturday morning and so i had a chance to watch it and it was very good and i enjoyed that and so i appreciate brother enoch being instant in season and out of season but he did a wonderful job and also brother jonathan baumgardner and his daughter surprised us by showing up there and i didn't know he was coming he didn't tell me and so that was a very pleasant surprise so we thank them for that it was good to have their support and their smiling faces so praise god and i appreciate your prayers it meant a lot to us and i'm glad to be back and also brother isaiah wants to send greetings he mentioned many of you by name and he wants to send greetings and he remembers the times of fellowship we've had together and he said it was really wonderful to get reacquainted and also he want to make me make sure that i sent you greetings from him and from his church also i just want to ask you i know it was read but just to remember brother stephen francis's family and his congregation there i found out saturday while i was preparing for the saturday night service that he had passed away sometime on saturday and i was quite devastated brother stephen was a very very good friend of mine a very dear and precious saint and one of the finest men that i've ever met in my life and he was so good to me and so encouraging and so kind and i just want to remember his family you know it was it was hardly a week went by maybe every week or every two weeks he would send me a text send me a quote and send me a scripture and send me a word of encouragement and i would send something back and if we went three weeks or four weeks without a quote or a text it was odd it was unusual so he was that kind of man he was very loving and very sweet and very tender and he had a tremendous revelation of the word and he was a mighty preacher and i just i'm gonna miss him missing dearly but he and his wife took covet and they were in the hospital together sister jenny's recovered enough to go home but they were both in the hospital when brother stephen died and he never went home but she was discharged from the hospital she still has symptoms she's still fighting the pneumonia that was caused by that but she's recovering and so she had to go home to an empty house after 47 years of marriage and they were a very very close couple and she's just devastated she was traumatized by the whole experience and i just pray that you just remember her in prayer remember the rest of the family also the work there in newcastle he was a pastor there for 40 years he founded the work there and there's no other church in the area no other message church in the area he was the sole pastor in newcastle for the last 40 years so his loss leaves a big impact but we know god knows all things and he does all things well and so i spent much of the day in tears weeping and praying and it was it was devastating i would say but i still know that god does all things well and there's a purpose for everything and god has a plan and it seems like it was too early seems like he was too young we prayed and i fully expected god to raise him up i was anticipating a testimony you know and i'd rather be on that end of being wrong is expecting god to heal because i expected god to raise him up we've seen god answer prayer so many times it's become such a part of routine of life i just expected to hear a testimony and i was quite shocked when i heard that he had passed on but you know god is good and we're left here to continue the work and after i spent the day just really in shock and in prayer i told god i was because of the life that stephen lived and because of the gospel that he preached and the influence he had on me i'm more determined than ever to preach this gospel the full power of the revelation that god has given us in this day so that his influence would not be in vain and it wasn't just his influence on me but multitudes of others and i'm more determined than ever to be a sounding board for this gospel because nowhere else will this world hear the truth but through his bride and there's a great voice that we had that's now been silenced and he's going on to his reward but i'm more determined than ever to let my voice sound clear and true and not to obscure the revelation and not to water it down and deter from what god gave us but preach it in its fullness because it's the power of transformation and it'll be the power of translation and that is what brother stephen believed and that's what he stood for i don't know if you remember but he preached here in october 2018 and he preached the purpose of the seventh seal and that was brother stephen he always preached the seventh seal and i praise god that that god has given us the same revelation and we're going to continue preaching the seventh seal amen let's just read here in hebrews 13 8 while you're standing and we'll let you have your seeds hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever you can have your seeds i would like to take for a subject tonight and preach on the end time revelation the end time revelation i've been preparing since sunday evening for this this evening and today god had just taken everything i was focusing on and turned it just slightly and so i want to look into that but i want to like i said for a subject i want to take the end time revelation but i i opened with this scripture because this was a major theme in brother brennam's ministry and we're going to see he how many times did he quote this scripture i'd have never went to look it up how many times he quoted it referenced it quoted it partially i would never know but it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and i'd like to say that's the theme of the entire bible that is the theme of brother venom's ministry it was his ministry because his ministry was the purpose of his ministry was the seventh seal and it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so i'd like to look at this this evening and the seventh seal brother brown says notice now for the end of time message this seal he's preaching the seventh seal so for the end of time message this seal so the seventh seal is the end of time message so if you want to know what the message is the end time message it is the seventh seal friends it is the seal it is it it's everything to us it is the revelation of the entire bible it's the purpose that god had purposed in his heart from before the foundation of the world god had a heart purpose and that purpose was to have a bride of his own choosing and that that heart purpose of god is expressed in the seventh seal jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever for the end of time message this seal after he's revealed all the six seals but he don't say nothing about the seventh and the end of time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the bible i want you to lock into that the end time the end time seal what is the end time seal the seven seal the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the bible and remember revelations 10 1 7 1-7 chapter 10 1-7 at the end of the seventh angel's message all the mysteries of god would be known were at the end time the opening of the seventh seal brother branham's clear about that he goes on the in christ is the mystery of god revealed now i want to go back and i want to read one line out of the seven seal message here that i just read and the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the bible amen then the christ is the mystery of god revealed he preaches a few months later he preaches the seventh seal uh the seven seals in march of 1963 then in july of 1963 preaches christ is the mystery of god revealed and he says but this mystery is only revealed to his beloved bride it's a total secret when this end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the bible but then he comes by and says but this mystery what mystery the mystery of the threefold purpose which is the mystery of the seventh seal which is the mystery of the whole bible this mystery is only revealed to his beloved bride that's the only one could see it it's a mystery to the world but it's a secret to her amen further in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride but all this mysteries revealed only as he promised to his bride hell is against the truth of the revelation of this mystery but the bride is standing on it that's her stand what do you hunger why do you hunger church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of the world you let some pastor you let somebody else get that out of you and when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting hungry it's god trying to reveal it to you see the revelation the last day is here god is trying to get this revelation that's the hunger in our heart and he's trying to tell us don't let anything get distract you from this don't let a spouse don't let your children don't let work don't let anything distract you your heart's hungering for this revelation of this end time seal and it's a secret when it begins it's a total secret but this mystery will be revealed to his beloved bride she's the only one that can get it and if you're that beloved bride then it's stirring your heart but don't be distracted this is not the hour to be distracted friends this is the hour to tune in your spiritual dial and dial into what god's doing and not let the cares of life pull it out of us where he says why do you hunger church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you it's a total secret to the world but the father is trying to reveal it to you he wants you to get it he wants you to know it because the love secret is for the beloved bride and this is his love secret let's turn to genesis chapter 2 together genesis chapter 2 verse 21 genesis 2 and 21 and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from him from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and we're not ashamed brother ben told us the seventh seal goes all the way back and begins to open all the way back in genesis and all the way back in genesis you find god in his creation working his way up to a masterpiece and that masterpiece was a man that was made in his own image but but he was going to make a masterpiece family so he would take the woman out of the man and unite the two were so very familiar with this but adam would say now this is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of a man and he says he declares that they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and we're not ashamed it means they were both revealed to one another the husband was revealed fully to the wife and the wife was revealed fully to the husband amen and they were not ashamed in one another's presence because they were one flesh and there was an absolute complete revelation we're coming back to where god is unveiling himself to his bride and the word is unveiling the bride then now we stand with nothing separating us we come back to a revelation of him in a revelation of her and we're not ashamed before one another because he's purged us from our shame he's cleansed us from all unrighteousness and so he's bringing us back to this condition in the message the choosing of the bride he says the other is pregnanted by the word of god he's talking about two churches at the end time the false church has been pregnanted and will bring forth the antichrist amen incarnate the beast but he says the other is talking about the spiritual bride the other is pregnated by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride the see the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride so what is the bride she's the finished body of jesus christ the body of christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and woman is one and christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again or one flesh one body again like adam was at the beginning man and his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word so now we find out brother graham's telling us that the that that she's impregnated the end time bride is impregnated she's impregnated with the word but what she's going to bring forth in this pregnation she's going to bring forth the finished body of jesus christ because the body is not finished yet but this bride is bringing forth the finished body of jesus christ and the two are made flesh completing the body the two are brought together in an invisible union completing the body making the finished body of jesus christ that is what's happening under the seal that's what's happening in this end time is it's finishing the body because there was a restoration of the man but there has to be a restoration of the woman and the two have to be united back together before the millennium can begin to go back into an even condition because god is restoring back god he had given dominion to his son amen in the sixth day he had made adam he had made man and he had given dominion to man but he found that man was alone so he needed to make a help me for him but that help meat was part of him it was the completed body of adam adam's body wasn't finished yet it had to come forth in feminine also so when he brought that part of the body out and he united them back together in one one flesh now god's work and his masterpiece was done and he went and took his rest and when he went took his rest his seventh thousandth year a thousand year rest amen when during that rest his plan was interrupted and there was a fall and god had to leave his rest to start making the masterpiece again because it fell in ruin but god wasn't content to let it stay that way he began working again it took him six thousand years to make the first masterpiece family and while he was resting what made him what made what gave him the ability to go to rest he was able to turn over all of his creation to his son and his son's bride and he had confidence in his son and his son's wife and he went to his rest and let his son be the god of the earth and rule the earth his son and his son's wife together but there was a fall and that was interrupted and he left his rest to come start the masterpiece again to rebuild what had fallen and at the end of 6000 years he's going to bring back amen the masterpiece family he's got he's brought back to man amen in christ jesus and then out of him he struck a blow amen under his rib and pulled out the ingredients to build a wife amen and he's been building through seven church ages of bride and at the end time he's going to unite that bride back to him to be one flesh again the finished body of jesus christ male and female back to one flesh again and then what's he going to do then he's going to put them back in the millennium and he's going to turn the rulership of the earth back over to his son and his son's bride and god will complete the thousand year rest that he didn't complete the first time because he'll leave nothing unfinished so that's why there has to be a millennium there has to be a physical thousand-year millennium where christ reigns on the throne of david and the bride reigns and rules rules and reigns with him over all the earth so that god can finish the thousand-year reign that was interrupted he's not going to let amen his plan be interrupted but he's working it back and he'll take his thousand-year rest when he brings them back when he finishes the body of christ he built the mail up through the prophets through the through the patriarchs and through the prophets and through the psalms he built that one and finally it was capped off by the great had come and it was jesus christ the fullness of the old testament and he took out of him the ingredients for his wife the finishing of the body of jesus christ and he's been building those seven church ages but there's coming a great capping time when he's going to cap and complete amen that building of that bride and he's going to unite the two back together as one and that's the age we live in now and the two together makes one body again like adam was at the beginning man and his wife are one she the true bride so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word so this bride will be so sold out she's not going to use her own mind she's not going to use her own reasoning her own intellect she won't use her own mind she will she will not use her own mind she will use his mind what is his mind it's not a figment of somebody's imagination his mind amen of course is his will and his will is his word and the word has been restored and we have the mind of christ and this bride won't take her own mind but her the headship has come and the headship is the word and the word is his mind and his mind is his will amen and his will is his word and now she doesn't have to rely on her own thinking she just takes the mind of christ that's been given back to us through a prophetic ministry she will stand on that word in that word only in the message it is the rising of the sun prophet says that's what he proved hallelujah that's what easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was god himself the dynamics in the word that made the body of jesus christ cold stiff and dead in the grave shaken the life and rise again and roll away the stone i am he that was dead so dead till the sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the star said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has recognized that he's alive again he was not only the mechanics god's word he was the dynamics to prove it and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others have spoke of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him oh i hope that locks down we've been through this many times but don't let it become common don't let it be another phrase excuse me another phrase that we've heard let it become a living reality in our lives that she is him amen and a man and woman are one and the woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put together and made mechanics and dynamics so he she is the word she is the manifested word but he is the life he's the dynamics of that word and now he is united with the bride so that she's both mechanics and dynamics of the word that's why this is the resurrection in this age it's the resurrection of the bride tree it's the resurrection of the fallen bride amen she's resurrected in this day under this resurrected ministry because the dynamics have come [Music] let's look over at genesis chapter 5. genesis 5 and 1 this is the book of the generations of adam and the day that god created man and the likeness of god made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam and the day they were created so these two were one flesh and when god named them he named them adam because they were one they were not two they were one brother venom gets a question and questions and answers on the seals and the question is the bride of christ and the body of christ the same so listen to the question is the bride of christ and the body of christ the same yes sir now see i don't want to get started on that because i'll preach a sermon on c but i i won't do that but i want to show you when god gave adam his bride from his side she is flesh of my flesh bone of my bone is that right when god give christ his bride the spirit gave the flesh the bride he was pierced in his side under his heart and the water and blood and spirit came forth that became flesh of his flesh bone of his bone we are the flesh and bones the bride will be the flesh and bones of christ exactly that is his bride amen not something different but a continuation of the same thing we can't keep thinking differently amen god has come down and redeemed these bodies so that he can live in these bodies so that these bodies can be the tabernacle of the holy ghost so that these bodies can be his flesh and his bones they're united with christ amen not in a way not in the time but we're united with christ amen the dynamics has come to make the mechanics live so that it is him alive on this earth jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever if we take that scripture and apply it in the past and apply in the future we've missed the whole point of hebrews 13 8 because he's the same today as he was yesterday and he will be tomorrow he has to be the same and the message the seed shall not be aired with the shock alpha says that's what the church is doing today for jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the bride is a part of the groom therefore the word that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day and it's the same word same experience same life amen there was word that has been portioned in the word and the word was with god and the word was god and we know that the word is god and there was word portion for each day and he was the fullness of the word in his day and we were part of that word and this word today is still part of the same thing it's not something different it has to be the same thing and the word being expressed today is the same thing as the same body of jesus christ it's the same life for when god separated adam he was both we find adam was spirit to begin with he made man in his own image created him male and female and then genesis 2 and on he created man and out of the dust of the earth man was created in god's image god of spirit so he's a spirit man then when he became flesh man animal flesh on the earth he is showing portraying here the bride he never taken and made another being but he took part of adam the original creation took from him a rib from his side and took the feminist spirit out of adam left the masculine spirit there and placed it in the feminist part therefore part of his spirit part of his body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word life of his life and that's the way the bride is to christ just laying many of these quotes down we're familiar with them but i'm laying down as a foundation and christ is the mystery of god revealed he says so therefore there is no school no theologians no teachings of the bible among any school that knows anything about it they cannot know nothing about it it's impossible for them to know anything about it god has hid the sense of knowing it from the very elect teachers and everything else it's a personal individual affair with the person that christ is revealed to them and if you say he's been revealed to me and the life that christ produced here in the bible that same life is not in him does not produce itself in you then you've got the wrong revelation and see what brother bran is telling us you can claim to have any revelation you want but a revelation has to produce something amen and the revelation of jesus christ the true revelation of jesus christ in this hour must produce the life of jesus christ it has to be the same life amen not a different life not an altar life but she must have the same life for she's life of his life spirit of his spirit flesh of his flesh bone of his bone amen she cannot show something that he didn't show she cannot have another character that he didn't have she cannot have another nature that he didn't have before she comes from him amen and she was joined back to him and she's the completed body of christ and that's why if you say we're heavily revelated heavily revelated means we should live the life of jesus christ but if we become heavily revelated and we can deny his word and trespass on his word and live like the world and take in the entertainments of the world and feast on the things of the world and do what the world does it shows that we don't have the revelation we think that we have because a revelation amen is the mind of christ we've been given the mind of christ by an open book and the mind of christ will produce the life of christ [Applause] so it doesn't matter if we've said in the message 20 30 40 years it doesn't matter if we've listened to 1200 tapes amen the real revelation of this word will produce a real life and if there's no life amen my question is where's your revelation it's just intellect it's just words amen it's not that christ has been made personal to you it's not that christ has come himself and giving you the revelation of what this means in this day it was more than god sent a prophet amen god was calling a bride to be the finished body of jesus christ he wanted to display on this earth amen what has not been displayed correctly yet amen that there is a wife amen a bride that will stay with the word and not compromise and will not be deceived like all the other ones were deceived the message came to produce that part of the seventh seal that should be our whole life friends that should be everything you see it's not about churches it's not about church services it's not about buildings it's not about conventions it's not it's not about what we so many times think it's about this isn't about having a correct church it's not about having a correct church in church order it's not about correct doctrine i hope you hang with me and catch what i'm saying it's not about just knowing about the bible it's not about a church building or a church service amen it is about christ manifesting himself in the formation of his bride the feminine of jesus christ on display on this earth so it can be seen as a testimony to the world amen that christ is still alive and if we have a revelation and that revelation will allow you to live amen and compromise without uh without uh mean being condemned and being convicted and and repenting amen i say go back and ask for a real revelation from god because the revelation has to produce christ the reason it was revealed the reason the seals were open amen the reason of all that is to reveal christ to the bride to bring him her back in contact with him and him back in contact with her to unite the two as one the reason there was a son of man ministry on the earth amen was to make him so real that it will unite the two together to do what to reveal the son of man again not to reveal a church not to reveal a correct order to the service not to reveal good preaching all of that's part of it but that's not it none of those things are wrong i'm not saying they're wrong i'm saying that's not it what did he want he wanted to live in his bride what did he want he wanted to restore the masterpiece that had fallen in the garden of eden he wanted a woman that would be the very reflection of the bridegroom he wanted a bride that would be so surrendered and so sold out by the revelation and born again by the spirit of god and so given to the mind of god that she will be a reflection of whatever he was the woman was intended to be the reflection of the man the bible says the woman is the glory of the man the woman is the glory of the man and so what is christ's glory what is the glory of jesus christ it's the bride of jesus christ she's the glory of the man she's made in his image she's a reflection of him she comes out of him amen and she receives his spirit and she's united back to him to do what to reflect him not to reflect her own ideas not to reflect her own ideas her own ambitions her own plans her own wants she's here to reflect his life let's turn to john chapter 14. i just pray that god will help me to preach this and the way it's come to me because preaching is foolishness it's it is such a a futile method it's such a uh uh it's such a horrible way to take a revelation that god gives you in your heart and bring it out but it is god's way and so we're dependent on god's ways but john chapter 14 verse 6 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so if you want to get to the father you have to go through christ that means he's the door he's the gate to the father thomas said unto him lord we know not whether thou go i'm sorry verse seven if ye had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him philip saith unto him lord show us the father and it sufficeth us jesus said unto him i have been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that has seen me has seen the father and how sayest thou show us the father believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me not believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake jesus is saying i am a reflection of the father he had no mind of his own he took no mind of his own he took no will of his own he surrendered his will to the will of the father he did that which the father he only spoke what the father taught him he only did what the father showed him he was given the mind of the father and the mind of the father is what he lived by and because he only did what the father showed him and he only spoke what the father taught him he became the reflection of the father amen when you when you see me you see the father philip say show us the father jesus always talking about the father and he says well show us the father he said have i been so long with you that you don't know me when you see me you see the father why because it was the father's life in him and he was the physical uh manifestation of the full thought of god god's thought was now being displayed and jesus christ mind was the word of god his action was the word of god his will was surrendered to the word of god and he became the manifestation of the father and that relationship is the relationship between christ and his bride i mean she's not to take her own thought she only speaks what he teaches amen she surrenders her will to his will and she only does what she's seen him do and she becomes a reflection of jesus christ let's look at verse 18. jesus is still still speaking to his disciples here in chapter 14 he comes to verse 18 he says i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world sees me no more but you see me because i live you shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you show us the father i'm showing you the father same way you could come to the true bride of jesus christ and said show us jesus christ i'm showing you jesus christ if i'm taking his word and living his word if i've surrendered my will to his will if i only speak what he taught if i only do what he did i'm showing you jesus christ in a form brother bam says in christ is the mystery of god revealed referring to this scripture he said now notice god making himself known not we're not supposed to make converse to christianity by a government but by the revelation the christ in you as god was in christ so how are we supposed to make how are we supposed to make converts not through government not through rules not through an adherence to a set of rules or a code of conduct amen we can't make message believers by getting them to act and dress like message believers do you understand that's not conversion amen that's not how we give conversions because it says we're not supposed to make conference christianity by government but by the revelation what revelation the christ in you that revelation the christ in you as god was in christ so what jesus was saying to them amen have i been so long with you don't know me when you see me you see the father that's how god was in christ amen and that's how we're to make converts by being that life of jesus christ on display so that when you see me you see the life of christ what's it going to take surrender to the word a surrender to the word jesus jesus surrendered to the father when when what god did in christ god does christ does in you what signs did god in christ christ does in you oh isn't that beautiful oh my i like that jesus said at that day that's this day so don't this doesn't apply anywhere else it applies right now this is the day this is the time and it's not for another people friends it's for you and i i'm so glad that god gave us a real prophet amen and that real prophet was a real man who could flesh out this word but show us what it was like to live a life and i'm so glad that that man would tell us all his mistakes and he may not have told us all his mistakes but he told us mistakes do you know how discouraged you and i would be if brother benham didn't tell us he had his wife lied to the lawyer and then when he went to pray for the baby god refused him and said how can you pray when you lied and you had to go make that right amen because we're supposed to live the life of jesus christ amen and flesh out christ the manifestation of christ in brine form but brother branham was the wave chief he was that the first one to come to maturity he was showing us what it's like to be mature in christ and he was showing us what it was like to live the life of christ but in living the life of christ he would still tell his wife to lie to the lawyer that wasn't christ but when god stopped him and he come around and repented amen and he repented and he made it all right that was christ that was a surrender to christ that was the display of the humility of christ and the surrender of christ to the will of the father when brother branham got his feelings hurt because they weren't listening to him and he felt rejected amen after he preached the seals and he was going to trap his wife into going up in to alaska and be a guy and he was going to trick her into getting up there and he was just going to be like an old hermit like an old prophet and grow his beard out and stomp out of the wilderness and give a message and go back he was doing that because his feelings got hurt and he had built up a complex i'm so glad he told us that or else when brother branham come to these other scriptures and he says amen as god was in christ christ is in you i would think it's impossible to do it but god had lifted up a vessel in this day and then that vessel was the first part of that word amen that bride word to come to full harvest maturity and it was waved over the people showing that whatever brought this maturity will bring you to maturity and what brought him to maturity it was the revelation of the word it wasn't because he had special genetics or special mom or special death or special training or he had a special temperament amen he had he had a special temperament but that's not what it was it was the revelation of the word that produced the life of the word and when you receive the word and its fullness the word brings a life with it and brother brenham displayed that but i'm so thankful he was honest and he told us about his plan to come to the wilderness and he told us about god rebuking him and then he come and told the church and repented and he said i still can't go out yet i still don't i still feel like they ought to have heard he was still offended and he said i can't go out amen until this feeling gets out of me oh friends when when we preach this kind of preaching amen don't get too discouraged to the point of saying well i'll never live that life you're called to live that life this is the age this is the day amen that day is this day and if god has called you you're the people to do it amen and how will i do it i'll do it exactly the way that prophet did when god corrects me by the word i'll say i'm sorry lord forgive me i'll make it right and when he corrects you by the word and corrects you by the word and corrects you by the word amen it's not about living a perfect life and there's never any humanity left and never any failure but every failure is brought subject to the word every facet of our life when it's illuminated before us we surrender that back to the word there's been many things over the last few years that god has put his illumination of his word on and we've had to make many adjustments amen there's things in my life i've had to adjust and i thought i had that wrong i understood that wrong that's not pleasing to the lord and i had to make an adjustment and i say praise god for the ability to see the word and praise god for a heart that says i want nothing but that word to live in me i gladly surrender my own ideas i gladly surrender is it a struggle yes it's a struggle brother branham surrendered under the rebuke of god telling him if he goes up there he'll become a bomb and his wife will leave him but even after he submitted to that and told his church he was still struggling with the feelings so it just goes to show to manifest this kind of seed life doesn't mean that you're never going to have a struggle that you won't struggle with feelings that difficult things won't happen but what is it it's a surrender to the will of god and his will is his mind his mind is his will his will is his word and it's a constant surrender to his word i don't think he's done shaping us i think he'll continue to illuminate things out of the word and i think it's an opportunity for the expression of the christ to say be it unto me according to your word still in the same scripture and then same quote crisis the mystery of god revealed jesus said at that day that's this day at that day when this revelation is made known what day the day this revelation is made known you will know that i am in the father and the father and me and i in you and you and me when the revelation is made manifest at that day you shall know that i and the father are one i am in the father and the father is in me then when the revelation comes forth then it's i in you and you and me what is that revelation of the end time what is the end time seal the end time revelation supposed to produce when that revelation comes forth then it's i in you and you and me see a revelation puts us in position a revelation is not just more knowledge that's that we can debate actually when you get a real revelation there's no interest in debating it it becomes such a part of your life it's not worth arguing about it's too precious to debate and this revelation is too precious to debate friends and then when the revelation comes forth then it's i in you and you and me see we need the end time revelation to recognize who we really are and what we're called to and what our position is and then it's in you and you and me then we become one flesh there you are see the manifold threefold manifestation what for to bring it back we've got to be let's go to revelation chapter four together revelation chapter 4 verse 1 after this after what after the revelation of the seven church ages after laodicea after christ is put on the outside and he's knocking at the door after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i which i heard the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter when i come to this scripture i just remember something i heard brother stephen francis say he said heaven is another dimension and we believe that right heaven is a dimension is heaven far away heaven's right here heaven's another dimension and in that dimension it doesn't need doors there's not a wooden door there's not a door on hinges that need to be opened amen what is this what's opening it's an opening opening access into heaven because there's a separation of the two dimensions and here's a door that is open into heaven and john is going to go through that door amen and that door is christ it's a revelation of jesus christ that'll bring us up into the heavenly realm and that door is open after these things amen after the jesus christ is put on the outside of the laodicean church age after this look i looked and there was a door open in heaven praise god amen there's a revelation of jesus christ that will give me access back to the mind of god and john goes through that open door let's go to revelation 10. and 7. revelation 10 and 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god singular the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets see john needed to go through this open door at the end of the church ages there's things that the church had to see and we have to go into the revelation that's beyond the church age revelation we have to go beyond this understanding that's beyond the church age understanding just so we can find our proper position and when the revelation comes of the mystery of god amen it opens unto us an understanding of our position of who we really are who god intended for us to be from before the foundation of the world and what god's plan is and where we are in time and what he's trying to accomplish and when the revelation comes then it's you and i and i and you then it becomes the two united together and the feast of trumpets the brother of him says there was three stages of it the martyr's age uh age of the martyr for it and then the stage of the reformer and now the calling out time when finished at laodicea according to revelation 10 the mystery of all the bible would be known to the bride praise god god wants to give the mystery of all the bible so there's a mystery of this whole bible and the mystery is is the mystery of god and god and when it's finished at laodicean age according to revelation 10 the mystery of all the bible would be made known to the bride why did god do that amen why did god open up the door in heaven why did god open the mystery of the whole bible and give it to the bride amen there must have been a purpose in doing all of that amen and i'll tell you it was not i said it before but i said again it was not for church services it wasn't so that we could come to church on sunday and have something exciting to excite the people so that we could go home and say that was a good service that's not the point amen god's not opening up the revelation so that we could go home and say that was a good service go to work on monday and hope to come back on wednesday and have another good service it wasn't for good services amen it was to produce a life and a bride that jesus christ could be manifested reflected in the formation of his bride that there will be a female representation of jesus christ on this earth in the end time that will represent what he's been doing through seven church ages and he caps it off and the end time bride amen is the restored bride tree come back to her position again that's why this revelation came in this hour and if we have that revelation and don't want to live for christ it shows we need to go back and ask god for a clear revelation in the message identification from 1964 the bible says then see god come down and the character of god was in christ so what character was christ representing he was portraying the character of god when he was interacting with pharisees amen when he was interacting with the woman at the well when he was interacting amen with mary magdalene and with his disciples and zacchaeus what was it he was portraying the nature of god amen so that man could see god's nature he was re he was the reflection he was god made visible notice god made visible in the beginning was god he wasn't even god then no god is an object of worship only thing he was was the eternal and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts was expressed to words and word was made manifest what is it it's all god becoming tangible what is all the word it's god becoming tangible so what would the revelation of the whole bible be it would be the revelation of god becoming tangible amen what is the mystery of god the mystery of god is god becoming tangible what is it it's all god becoming tangible and you are part of god and jesus come to redeem those that was put on the land's book of life before the foundation of the world it was in god's thoughts and that's what he come to redeem and then as soon as it strikes to them they see it because the life is in there but if the life isn't in there then what can they do see they don't see it they'll never see it see and the whole thing is jesus said at that day you'll know that i'm in the father the father and me i and you and you and me the whole thing is god becoming material like a husband and wife becoming one together god in his church becoming one what is it the whole thing what's on display today the whole thing see brother branham says i i want to turn to it here i have it not in my notes but i pulled it up he says look christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation see christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god is trying to do what is god trying to do god's trying to show amen this end time message in a people not on books not on tapes amen he's trying to get it from the book and the tape from the bible he's trying to get it into a people so that the word that was in his mind the thought that he had before the foundation of the world would become spoken word and the spoken word will come into manifestation and what are you upon your new birth you're a spoken word creation of god manifesting the very thoughts of god that he had at this end time the thought and the thought that he would have of an endtime bride that's what the revelation is to produce again in christ as the mystery of god revealed he says now you see now you see the seals praise god now you see the seals when he was in his mediatory work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in the book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him so what is the mystery of god it's the mystery of the whole bible what is the bible it's the word of god what is the word of god it's god and everything that's in this book the book of redemption the title deed book the marriage certificate the bible he calls it all the same thing amen and all that's in the book would be him amen you say well my name's in the book but he said all that's in the book would be him so if your name is in the book you're part of him because it's a record of him it's a record of christ it's the lamb's book of life and all that's in the book would be him but i know my name was in the book by revelation i know i was in the book then you're part of him because the book is him and it's all in the book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him oh what's he trying to do god is revealing himself becoming material becoming detangle displaying himself in this earth and we each have a portion of that word to manifest john 1 1 we know it so well it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god were you part of that word then you were in the beginning with god were you in that book well that book is him what are the words in the book the believers but the book is him but the words in that are you and i i'm one of the names that were written there because i'm part of that life not not by my choosing but by his choosing amen by predestination brother says again and god is his own god is his own interpreter what i mean attributes was his thoughts and a word is a thought expressed and then then that was in his thinking and when he said let there be and there was let there be and there was and now remember you christians were in his thoughts before there was a world and you are the manifestation of his thinking before there was before there even was a world you were in christ amen in god in the beginning that makes you then you see his subjects and the whole thing is god himself materializing himself tangible so that he could be handled seen and so forth that's what god is the whole thing so now you realize by these things that i'm reading there's a point i'm reading all this is god wants to be manifest in this day he wants to be manifest in you amen and you're not coming to have church you're coming to hear the word of god so that revelation can produce a life and that life can be what he had in his mind before the foundation of the world and this revelation is the only thing that can produce that life because when the revelation comes then it's i in you you and me so what is god trying to do in you god is trying to reveal the mystery what mystery the mystery of the seventh seal he's trying to reveal it in you like he was trying to reveal it in christ like he's revealed it all the way through it's been revealing god god amen was alone with his thoughts amen but he didn't want to remain in that condition he wanted the fellowship with his thoughts so god was going to allow those thoughts to come and take tangible form what is it it's all god becoming tangible it's all god materializing himself where is he materializing himself by faith i say he's materializing himself right here by the revelation that has revealed it's him and me and me and him by his choosing and because of that revelation amen i want to know what that word says i want to know what to manifest because of that revelation i don't anymore want my own thoughts that's what the revelation has done for me the revelation it doesn't puff up it doesn't create a theologian it doesn't create a debater of the word but that true revelation of this mystery what it does is it created you such a hunger to know his word amen because i want to be a reflection of that word and i don't want anything to stand in between i want to surrender all god i want to lay it all down and you get on your knees and say god i can't do this by myself it has to be you and me you get down on your knees and say god forgive me lord forgive me for taking my own mind forgive me for having my own desires forgive me for constantly amen for fulfilling the desire of the flesh and not the desire of your word i mean it produces in you a desperation this revelation amen you can't walk around uh smug and hottie with your head in the air but you realize in yourself it is impossible to manifest what he's called me to manifest in this day i will do nothing but ruin it i'll do nothing but mess it up but i am totally dependent on him this revelation brings us into despair not despair but desperation for him to manifest himself it brings us into a position and that position brings us into an understanding that it's got to be in me but if it's going to be in me it's got to be him and me and now when i come to church i'm not coming to hear something amen so i could go and say that was a good service amen i'm coming to hear something from the nature of christ so that i know what i'm supposed to be reflecting in this life so that i can catch his nature so i can connect his life so i can get this character and then by feeding on that word as i take in the word and the revelation of the word i become one with the word and the word becomes to live out of me see this isn't something that's done by willpower it's done by holy ghost power but we feed on the word so that the word can produce its own life that's why we reject the things of the world because if we feed on the world amen they'll be a reflection of the world but the revelation listen i tell you you don't cut off the world because the preacher says cut off the world because that's a church life if the preacher says don't get caught up in social media and don't get caught up in the world you say well i better not get caught up with social media i better not get caught up in the world amen that's nothing more than coming trying to come to salvation by governments but what's the preacher trying to tell you the preacher is trying to tell you that you're going to reflect what you're looking at and if you've caught this revelation and you know what your position is and you know the manifestation is ours we ain't got time to fool around looking at the world amen this is the end time under the end time seal it's time to look at this word and begin to reflect what we're looking at [Music] [Applause] it has nothing to do with government has nothing to do with rules it has nothing to do with being a good believer so many people have been deceived because they're able to keep the rules of the church and be able to do it that's not it friends that is not it it is a life that you don't live it's a life he comes and lives through you but how are you going to do it when we're distracted what are you hungering for what are you thirsting for what are we why are we trying to fill it with things that don't fill the hunger what is it what is the seed of god what is the elect of god hungering for it's god trying to give you the revelation it's god trying to reveal himself to us amen we're not trying to stay away from social media so that we can say i'm a good message believer we're not interested in a church walk we're staying away from those things because they will not produce what i've been called to in this revelation because god has positioned me by this revelation and in that position i'm now a queen to the king my eye has to be focused on him i got to know what he wants and what he desires i'm supposed to be on this planet a reflection of jesus christ and if i can't find jesus christ there i'm not looking anymore because i've got to reflect what i'm looking at [Music] it's not about getting doctrine right so we can say we're right it's about finishing the mystery it's god becoming tangible so it can be felt have you ever felt god have you ever washed a brother's feet have you ever washed a sister's feet this bride is becoming the flesh and bones of jesus christ by becoming one with him she is fleshing out jesus christ it's god completing the mystery he showed it all the way back in the beginning in genesis and he's been it fell and he's been working it all the way through to bring it back to the masterpiece family again and when we've been given the revelation our eyes have been opened and we see we've gone through the open door we've seen by revelation the heavenly dimension the plan of god from before the foundation of the world then all we want to do is surrender to him in the message choosing of a bride he's looking for her character the character of christ now just a moment now that's it he chooses a bride to reflect his character to which the modern churches of today certainly miss his program here a million miles because then they deny this being the truth so how could it be and he's looking for the and he's looking for the day for that bride to be formed hebrews 13 8. can i read that again he's looking for the day for that bride to be formed hebrews 13 8. what's hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen what was it when adam amen was made flesh and adam was alone in the garden of eden it was adam the same yesterday today and forever but then god would pull out of adam a portion amen he would make a bride for adam amen and while adam was still asleep and this bride amen was now coming into manifestation what was it it was adam the same yesterday today then when adam amen was awakened and the two were united what was it it was still adam it was always adam and hebrews 13 8 is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen wait he way back he said it was it was christ and moses it was christ and noah it was christ and david what was it it was jesus christ manifesting himself all the way through and now he's looking for the day for that bride to be formed hebrews 13 8 just exactly like it was like he was it's got to be his same flesh same bone same spirit same everything just exactly built up and them to then become one until the church becomes that they're not one i was telling the church at brother isaiah's i said god is not looking for a part-time bride that i'm part-time i'm a bride sunday and i'm a bride wednesday but monday i may not be and tuesday i might slip and no he's looking for a full-time all the time bride this isn't a part-time position friends this is a full-time this is our whole life this isn't something this isn't something we believe everybody has something they believe amen this is something we live this is our life amen so many people have something they believe they have something they believe or they something they believe in they have a code of conduct that comes with what they believe in if they're catholics they believe the catholic faith and they have a certain code of conduct in a certain mode of operation if they're bad the same way if they're men and night it's another way this isn't a message way amen it's not that i believe a message i believe the message it's not a message way it's a jesus christ way it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever anything less we don't have the revelation yet he's looking for a full-time bride praise god he says in christ is the mystery of god revealed the only way you're saved is to know him by revelation praise god if i can take if i can take the presbyterian doctrine and tie you pentecostals tell you won't know you can take the baptist doctrine and show you pentecostals a million things that you know nothing of that's right but that's not it that's not his church that's not his church his church is himself revealed praise god what is this church it's not a set of doctrines it's not a certain mode of operation or a form of belief amen his church is himself believed revealed his church is himself revealed do you see it and expressed by the word itself that he is god see how can you say father son and holy ghost then and be baptized in it heathens right how can you say you know jesus christ he is the word when there's not a scripture in the bible there's not a place where anybody is ever baptized in the name of father son and holy ghost and you jesus only people just use the name of jesus for baptism i'm personally acquainted with four or five jesus and myself so you see what your denomination leads you into that's the darkness the expression of cain who brought fruits instead of the blood but the revelation come through the blood see through jesus christ who is the blood of god creative blood in the womb of mary and paul knew him by revelation that's how we know him today is the only way you can know him not say i'm methodist that means nothing i'm baptist that means nothing i'm catholic that means nothing but by the revelation that god has revealed the word to you he is the word and the word how you know it's revealed it lives itself and expresses his self through you how do you know the words revealed it live itself and expresses itself expresses his self through you the church is himself revealed he says in choosing of a bride again the kind of a woman that a man would choose will reflect his ambition and his character if a man chooses the wrong woman it reflects his character and what he ties himself to shows truly what's in him a woman who reflects what's in the a woman reflects what's in the man when he chooses her wife it shows what's down in him no matter what he says outside watch what he married and we know this is true because when brother branham chose when when god chose brother branham to be the prophet for this age he chose someone that would reflect his character and we could look at that life and say i saw jesus christ live through a human being is that right but that's the same thing he wants in you and i that wasn't just for the prophet remember the prophet was the forerunner he was for running his coming amen he was four running something but were to be the manifestation of what he was for running that life was not just for him we may not have the same gifts and we may not do all the same things brother branham said the whole camp didn't have to be moses they just had to believe in moses we don't all have to be the prophet of the age we don't have to do everything the prophet did but we have to believe in the prophet and have the same character that was in him because that wasn't the character of william branham william branham died that was the character of jesus christ that character we saw that would humble himself that would repent amen that would wait on the lord amen that would would obey the word amen that would stand and face rejection by proclaiming the word that was not the nature of william branham that man died that was the nature of jesus christ the resurrected seed that was in william branham [Music] the reality is god did not come to call you the way he thinks he came to call you he didn't come to call you just the name you have uh bob and larry and all that he come to call that seed that was in you that was meant to be you from the beginning what was it he was calling forth for himself because what life was in this see it was the life of god he says this is further and choosing of right i'm going to read a couple quotes here i'll choosing of a bride now for it's becoming if a christian would choose a wife he ought to choose a genuine born-again woman regardless of what she looks like it's what she is what makes her i say thank god for choosing me it wasn't what i looked like when he chose me but it's what i really was on the inside that he knew i didn't know it he knew it amen he was looking beyond my flesh when he called me he was looking beyond my flesh when he called the apostles he was the the apostles yeah he was looking beyond their flesh when he called his disciples because he looked at a fisherman a man and a fisherman who smelled like fish and was gruff around the edges but he saw more than that he saw more than a tax collector he saw more than just common man he was he was calling forth that seed that was on the inside it's what she is that makes her and then again that reflects his own godly character and reflects what's in his mind and what's going to be in the future for his family will be raised by such a woman for the future plans for his home brother bam says now still in choosing of a bride now here we see plainly the spiritual plan of god's planning for his future home with his future bride comes into view now what's he talking about choosing of a bride amen this is what brother ben's been talking about i got a chance to watch that sermon yesterday morning and i was upset with him because he ruined all my notes for tonight i sat down on the plane and was meditating on the trip back and and tuesday morning i sat down and wrote out a bunch of notes and then i turned on brother ben's sermon i started listening to it and he started ruining all of my notes but i say thank god it was a wonderful service but brother branham's saying now he's talking about choosing the bride he's typing this all out and i know the kind of woman a man chooses reflects the character that's on the inside of him so i don't care what he says he is looks what he marries it reflects what he's thinking in his mind of what he wants his future home to be listen pay attention friends brother baby now says now see plainly the spiritual plan of god's planning for his future home what's he doing god is showing his future home by who he's choosing and the character that's being reflected he's showing his future home because the future home doesn't have compromise the future home doesn't have sin in it the future home doesn't have lust of the world lust of the flesh pride of life that's not in the future home so he's calling a bride that will surrender those things and die out to that and he's showing his plan for the future home the future home will be the word and the word only that's why he's got to have a bride in this age that'll take the word and the word only not man's ideas she won't hybrid it with her own ideas but she'll take the mind of christ has been given and she'll stay with that in that only and what's he doing when he chooses a woman with that character he's reflecting his future plans for his future home in the feast of trumpets since the holy spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost 2 000 years but it's to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy spirit back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time that quote was not for william branham alone that quote was for all the bride every expressed attribute of god the holy spirit back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh that's what he wants to do under this end time seal and you and i it wants to be jesus christ revealed in human flesh see they're coming together it's uniting time sorry wrong quote the holy spirit back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said he promised it now in jehovah jireh from 1964 he said he promised that he would appear in the last days in the form of human flesh again i'll be honest with you friends when i read that quote i used to be like yep i saw that brother brandon malachi 4. and every time i read that quote that's where my mind would go he promised that he would appear in the last days in the form of human flesh again and i would say oh yeah i saw that just like the plains of memory turn us back into certain thoughts that was part of it friends but that wasn't all of it that was certainly part of that and we certainly did see that and that was there to get the attention of the bride amen but not it wasn't for that manifestation and that vessel only but god wanted to do that in the entire bride and here i'm going to finish this sentence i haven't finished it yet he said he promised that he would appear in the last days in the form of human flesh again in your flesh brother brenda is not putting that all in him amen he's trying to show you amen there's been something waved over you to show that the life is back amen it's been bound for nearly 2 000 years but it's back in the church again and that part of the word has come to be waved over so you can see that it's possible to live a life of christ it's possible to overcome laodicea it's possible to believe the word even if you have to repent even if you don't always get it right it's possible to manifest christ in your flesh i'll read the sentence again because i keep stopping sorry he promised that he would appear in the last days in the form of human flesh again in your flesh like he did at the days of sodom wait a second wait a second wait a second did he just say what i thought he said he promised that he would appear in the last days in the form of human flesh again in your flesh oh i'm so glad he put that little phrase in there in your flesh like he did at the days of sodom what did he do in the days of sodom and sodom god come down in a body of flesh and presented himself to abraham he's saying he wants he wants to be in the form of human flesh again in your flesh like he did at the days of sodom i don't know how many times i've read that and said yep brother branham enmissed him saying in your flesh god which was christ manifest in the flesh now in his church his bride see brother doesn't want you to miss that he doesn't want you to miss it he's talking about a mini-membered bride a mini-membered body the flesh and bones of jesus christ see they're coming together it's a uniting time churches are uniting nations are uniting and the bride in christ is uniting see it's uniting time amen the prophet of god says in blasphemous names now then from this and then bringing this into the seven church ages god is building in seven church ages a bride for christ and then down in the unveiling of god in the in the unveiling of god he says like he was in moses when the word was in moses he was god in flesh when it was in jesus it was god in flesh see only thing he'd done was change his mask not his word not his nature he's the same yesterday today and forever what's that hebrews 13 8 but i'm reading this to you friends and as i read it to you i think you know by now we're going to get to an interesting statement because like he was in moses when the word was in moses it was god in flesh amen i believe that when it was in jesus it was gone in flesh amen when it was in brother branham it was god in flesh amen just like it was in sodom but brother brendon already told us he wants to do the same thing in you amen jesus it was god in flesh only thing he'd done was change his mask not his word not his nature he's the same yesterday today and forever he only changed his form he changed from noah to moses the whole thing is god becoming tangible don't forget that statement the whole thing is the revelation of god it's the mystery of god finished it's god becoming tangible he moved he changed from noah to moses what was that god changing his mask he changed from moses to david from david to joseph on down until he came into the fullness of the godhead bodily see it's still the same god amen i hope that gets through see it's the same god but he just takes on another veil he puts on another veil what's he preaching the unveiling of god god was being unveiled all the way through the bible now at the end time he's going to take the veil away he did it in the reformers taking on a veil taking on a veil until finally it came down through lutheran age down through the other age then finally it comes out into the complete what is this age the complete what age have we come to the complete the complete image of one the complete image of the new testament and a bride that's standing upon the earth in the end time it's come to the complete what was it it was god unavail just before it comes a prophet arises again what it does it foreshadows the word what's that prophet doing he's a forerunner he's foreshadowing the word he's showing what's going to come show showing back there revealing what's been done what's been left off what the church will be that the church will not that the church will be not without understanding then when this fades out then like john said i must decrease he must increase then all in all comes into him amen just before amen god he was veiled through the reformers he was he was changing his mask from noah to moses moses to david david to joseph he's changing his mask all the way down through and he's been doing the same thing it's been gone and avail all the way through and now through the reformers through luther through the next stage and the next stage but he said now it comes into the complete the complete image of a bride the completion of the brine but just before that a prophet rises again and foreshadows the word and when this fades out said i must decrease and he must increase see brother branham was foreshadowing the coming word he was showing us what god wanted to do in the bride because brother branham was both the prophet that would forerun his coming but he was also part of the bride and he was manifesting the life of the bride he was both manifestations in one and when he faded out said i must decrease so that he can increase where is he going to increase he's increasing in the bride form see that prophet had to fade off the scene he had to go because he was here just to show amen he was here to show the potential he was here to show the life he was here to display amen the word on display but but if god couldn't keep it there because we would just keep waving the wave she'd been waving the way she'd been waving the wave she but it was to show amen that god was going to bring the whole field to harvest the whole field was coming to harvest maturity and it's not so that we can listen to a tape and mesmerize about how brother bannon made god real you should be making god real it wasn't just him to make god real it wasn't just him to make god tangible but it's you to make god tangible you should be making god real to your children real to your spouse real to the people at work god is becoming tangible so that he can be felt in you and i he wants to be manifest in flesh your flesh just like he did at sodom see we can give somebody a stack of books but i tell you unless they see a life in you there's no motivation for them to read the books but when they see in you a life that matches jesus christ there's something in you god becoming tangible and they say where did you get this and you're different than everybody else you say well i read these books they said let me read that book too because i want what you got amen that's why we don't just fly planes a bit all over the world and throw out message books is that right because life comes when life makes contact there's a display of life when there's a display of life when there's a display when god becomes tangible then the god seed gets attracted to the tangible god that's the way it's been in every age let's look at colossians chapter one as we wrap up i say wrap up so you'll stay with me for a few minutes pay close attention now we really are we're down to the finish i think colossians chapter 1 verse 25 where if i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory not christ and brother branham was christ there absolutely was it beneficial yes did i need it yes but this mystery friends is christ in you the hope of glory it has to be personal it has to be real it has to be alive it has to be something that's leading you something that that's taking over you there has to be something in you that's laying down so that they can live a desire to get out of the way so that god can manifest himself i'm going to read this last quote as i read this musicians you can come on up and brother ben you can come listen to this final quote god's provided place of worship 1965 but he promised just before the coming of the end time the world would would get like it was in sodom when a man come down in human form three of them two angels and god himself that was god the bible said it was now he come down and manifested himself there by turning his back to the tent where sarah was and told abraham what sarah was thinking in the tent that's right now jesus himself said at that day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of jesus christ himself the church will come through justification through luther through sanctification through wesley through the baptism of the holy ghost or the pentecostals and go right on into the perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the self the same self persons he trying to do he's trying to take it back to the condition they were in eden where he called their name adam where they were one flesh whatever adam was the woman was whatever the woman was adam was they come from the same source they were made out of the same ingredients amen they were sharing the same life coming right on into the perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the same self persons god will be so manifest into his bride his church till they will both be the same they are one now you see where we're at now you see what the opening of the seals was to do now you see what the opening of the seventh seal was to do now you see where we're at where are we at we're not in laodicea no we're not there we are we are supposed to be caught up here into the mind of god by a revelation that will bring a manifestation and what is the manifestation it's the character of jesus christ on display in you and me god becoming tangible we can't surrender ourselves enough we can't give up enough friends it's not what you do it's what you surrender yourself to it's not your power it's his power it's not your will it's his will it's not what we do it's what he does through us it's not what we work ourselves up to it's what he has brought to us it's not what we accomplish is what he accomplishes but how will he do it he'll do it when we surrender to him and say not my will but thy will be done i see this is what you're calling for i see this is the day this is the hour when it's got to be you and me and i and you lord let nothing stand in the way let nothing hinder let me not be satisfied with a good service with a good church with a good set of rules and a good doctrine and the ability to keep them that's not it friends that's not this hour there was church ages where those things were acceptable it's not acceptable anymore this isn't the age for a church walk in a church life and and and i have a belief it's not a belief it's a life and it's time for the manifestation of that life in bright form and god knows just how to get the life out and i say all i want to do is surrender to this word that i'm hearing and all i want to do is flesh out what he's brought our way i've seen it i've seen it lifted up and i've seen it waved and i know that that wasn't weighed before me as an unattainable goal that life wasn't way before me as as look at here don't you wish you could be like this don't you wish you could do this that's not why god did that in our day friends that's not why he called the prophet that's not why he lifted him up amen what did he do he was showing us this is what you're supposed to be amen this is what i've called you for in this day this is your potential this is what you're growing to this is your destination and i say god that's what i want my destination to be i want to look like you i want to talk like you i want to act like you i want it to be you in this tabernacle of clay and i don't want it to be anything else i want to die i want to surrender i want to lay my life down and i want it to be you oh god i'm not looking at that life and saying wow look at the prophet i appreciate that life it meant so much to me but i'm looking at that and saying that's where i'm going that's the target that's my destination and i may not be there yet but i know by the grace of the god i'm walking on the path that leads there i know that he's lifting this bride up word by word she's coming into her position to manifest all that god wants her to manifest in this life i say it's the only thing we want let's all stand i know it's the only thing you want it's the only thing i want the devil he he still brings so many distractions and so many glittering flashing things to draw our attention and bring a distraction and then he'll try to bring troubles and and troubles are only meant to bring the life of christ out but he tries to bring troubles and cause us to be distracted by trouble don't be distracted by troubles troubles are here to bring the character of christ out of our lives amen don't don't don't it's not time to be distracted and it's not time to be influenced by anything other than the word but this is time for the manifestation of god this is the end time seal that's been opened god revealing to us what it is supposed to look like in this day and what the bride is supposed to be and he's done that revelation he's given us that revelation so that it can produce a life and i say god i want that life in me i know it's there lord i know it by faith i know it by a new birth experience i know it's there but oh god let it come out amen help me to surrender more is that your prayer is that your desire that you can just surrender more and all of this word can come out and he can become the tangible god so that somebody will say amen i saw god in that vessel of clay right there that man that woman that they made god real to me that he wasn't in a book amen he wasn't a historical god he wasn't a story that i heard in sunday school but i met somebody that made god real to me i said god let me be that that's my desire god i want to be the tangible god on this earth let's bow our heads friends and pray dear god we thank you for this word lord god you're so amazing how you have kept a mystery hidden through the whole bible it's there lord it's there all through the bible this mystery but you were able to keep it under cover lord because you didn't want it to be revealed to the end time you didn't want the enemy to play with it lord so you kept it hidden but oh what grace you showed upon us that at the end time you would peel back the seals and let us see what this mystery has been god you've done it for a purpose and i pray that purpose will be realized in my life there's many here who've raised their hands lord and now they're raising their hearts to you saying lord let the purpose of that revelation be realized in me for i'm here giving you a fresh consecration surrendering myself a new lord let all the distractions fade away out of my life and let me be singularly focused on you you're my headship you're my life you're my all-in-all god i surrender to you a fresh lord god live your life through this tabernacle but i saw what you did in the prophet when he surrendered when he died to himself i saw what you were able to do in a body of clay and i know god that if i can surrender you'll use me for the purpose that you put me on this planet god may i be a reflection of your life lord jesus god let me not be of a bad character because i'm i'm portraying a bad reflection of christ but lord let me clean the glass let me wash the mirror with your word that i might give a pure reflection of your life that others can look at this life and they can see there's god there's a real true and living god god i pray that you use us for your glory that you wash us and cleanse position us mourn and use us for your purpose we give ourselves to you god and we thank you for all you've done for us bless us lord we commit ourselves unto you and trust in you to do to finish the work that you started for we know this is the day and this is the hour bless us as we go from here many go home as they travel keep them safe as they go to work watch over them and bless them and may we lord flesh out this word every hour of every day in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you brother [Music] [Music] us [Music] us [Music] foreign [Music] through me through me [Music] [Music] the [Music] through me [Music]

god you know brother branham's wife she was the one on the end of that phone that had to lie for him and she saw his mistake firsthand and she even asked him is that exactly right [Music] she knew it wasn't right he went and repented but you know i don't think she would say anything else that i saw the life of god in that man you know that's the life that we can live friends your children your wife they'll see you make mistakes but what makes it the life of god and them is in you is when you come back and say that was wrong it wasn't according to the word will you forgive me i want to make that right i don't think sister media would have ever said i thought he lived a pretty good life i thought he was like christ but he made that mistake and i just don't think that was christ in him no she knew it was it proved it was it proved that that was god in that man when he come and he told his church i had a plan i was going to run to alaska i was going to trick my wife nobody in that church was saying well i thought he was the messenger i thought he was the son of god i thought that was god working that man but i've got my doubts now no the the way god dealt with him proved that it was god in that man oh i'm so glad we can be real christians not fake christians real christian we don't have to be plastic and pretend and put on a face at church and pretend in front of people amen no we can be a real christian and say what i just did was not christ it was wrong forgive me i want to be subject to this word and if you live that way friends i don't believe anybody's going to be like well i thought he was a christian i thought god lived in it they're gonna know that it's god in you because it's god that's bringing you subject to his word it is god that you're surrendering to so that he can be made manifest don't be afraid to be a real christian just be a real christian all the time if you fail say that you failed and say god is correcting me so that i can be right [Music] and no none of us i'm not gonna look at you and say well i thought they were probably bride but i'm not so sure enough i'm gonna say that's how the bride acts when she makes a mistake that's how the bride repents it's gonna be a manifestation of the life of god and you and i i'm so glad that we can be real christians not part-time not church christians not around a certain crowd
