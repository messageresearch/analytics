TRANSCRIPT
========================================
when you heard the word you know where you come from you know what was the truth you were always the seed was in you always the word seen the word seen the word the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you came to it so when you heard the message of the hour when you heard the true word for our day when God said let there be light and there was light when God told us that there would be a restoration of the word and there was a restoration of the word when he said Malachi 4 and there was a Malachi 4 when you saw that light shine amen the word heard the word what word the word that was down inside of you as a c genene of God heard the word for the hour and when the word heard the word I'll say it again the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you came to it why because you weren't going anywhere till you heard the word we were born listen you and I were born with the c Gene of God we were predestinated to be children of God to be part of his bride in the end time I believe that with all my heart I believe that I'm part of that and I believe by Grace you're part of that but because we were born that way and there was a germinated seed laying in US it wasn't as though when we were sitting in a Baptist Church or sitting in a Christian school or sitting wherever you were like nope that's wrong this is the truth that's the truth this is wrong I'm bride you didn't know anything the life was there the seed was there it was all there amen but nothing was happening it was not producing any life it was not bearing any fruit it wasn't doing anything why because faith comes by hearing you had to hear the foolishness of preaching you had to hear the word you had to hear the word for your day and see the manifestation of it and when you did the word from before the foundation of the word saw the word and you came to it because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word the word heard the word where did the ears to hear come from from the word where did you get those ears when I was in God before the foundation of the world as an attribute of God and part of God that's where I got those ears from those are the ears that hear the word it's not these ears amen if it was these ears if Faith cometh by hearing the word of God then we're going to sit everybody down and force them into 24hour a day hearing of the word of God cuz that's all it takes no the word has to hear the word the ears of the word have to hear the present tense preaching of the word
