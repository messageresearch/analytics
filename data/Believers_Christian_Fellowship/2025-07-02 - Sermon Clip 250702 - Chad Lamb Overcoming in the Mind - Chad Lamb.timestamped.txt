[0:00] Hey, listen. We've got to focus on the
[0:02] things that are true, the things that
[0:04] are honest, the things that are lovely,
[0:05] the things that are just, the things
[0:07] that be of good report. And if there's
[0:08] any praise, if it's worthy of any
[0:10] praise, think on these things and don't
[0:12] think on the other things.
[0:14] Refuse to let it have access to your
[0:16] mind. And refuse to let your mind wander
[0:18] all in dark, gloomy places. Bring it
[0:20] back to the truth, to the word of God,
[0:23] and say the word is true and everything
[0:25] else is a lie.
[0:28] That absolutely blessed me so much when
[0:30] I read that that we can get ourselves in
[0:32] such a dark spot over nothing.
[0:36] So I'm not going to let myself get in a
[0:38] dark spot. And by the help of God, I
[0:40] want to focus on that which is true and
[0:42] lovely and just and of good report and
[0:44] of praise because that's the truth. And
[0:47] if I've done something wrong, God will
[0:49] tell me. He's not going to let me wander
[0:51] all over the place not knowing. But I'm
[0:53] not going to start making up things and
[0:54] gloomy thoughts and gloom and doom over
[0:57] nothing
[0:59] over nothing.
[1:01] I'd rather go on blissfully ignorant
[1:05] that I've ever done anything wrong and
[1:06] be happy and joyful and a son of God and
[1:09] happy with every day of my life because
[1:10] I have a heavenly father and he loves me
[1:12] and wait for the time that God says,
[1:14] "Listen, you've missed it, but here it
[1:16] is." And then I can deal with it.
[1:18] Then I know I can repent. I can deal
[1:20] with it. I can make it right. But until
[1:22] then, I'm not going to start inventing.
[1:24] Well, maybe it's this and maybe it's
[1:25] that and maybe it's this and maybe it's
[1:27] that and maybe it's me and maybe it's
[1:29] not me. Maybe it's the people around me.
[1:31] Maybe it's my husband. Maybe it's my
[1:32] wife. Maybe it's my parents. Maybe I got
[1:34] an evil spirit on me from generation.
[1:36] Maybe it's the church I'm in. Maybe it's
[1:42] Satan.
[1:44] That's how he works with negative
[1:45] thinking. We got to throw that away and
[1:47] say there's nothing wrong between me and
[1:49] God. And if there is, he'll show me.
[1:51] He's a good father. He's a heavenly
[1:53] father. He doesn't want me to live in
[1:54] gloom. He wants me to be free in order
[1:57] to be free. He's got to tell me what's
[1:58] wrong. And if he doesn't tell me what's
[2:00] wrong, nothing's wrong.
[2:04] Praise God.
[2:06] You say, "Oh, I don't want to be a
[2:08] fool." I'd rather be a happy fool
[2:11] than a gloomy fool.
[2:16] I'd rather be a happy fool. Ignorant.
[2:19] Everybody else can look at you and say,
[2:20] "Your life is all messed up, but I'm
[2:22] happy anyhow."
[2:24] Rather than overanalyzing, coming too
[2:27] critical and trying to analyze
[2:29] everything that happens and become doom
[2:31] and gloom and everything's bad and yes,
[2:36] we'll never have victory in this battle
[2:38] that way. Always be defeated.
