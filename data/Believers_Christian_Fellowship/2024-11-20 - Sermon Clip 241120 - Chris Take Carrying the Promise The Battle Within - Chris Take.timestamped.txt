[0:00] he's he's saying David is is looking
[0:02] back to where he he's remembering his
[0:04] life and he says I remember when I sang
[0:07] his Praises in my childhood days when I
[0:09] heard in my sheep oh God take me back to
[0:12] that place take me back to my first love
[0:15] take me back and give me back my
[0:17] shepherd staff give me back my herd of
[0:19] sheep let me alone back there to worship
[0:21] you don't read ahead he says I want to
[0:24] go back he's hurt he's broken the the
[0:28] the the responsibility of carrying the
[0:30] promise is so great upon him the
[0:33] reproach is so great he'd rather go back
[0:37] right to his days of plowing the fields
[0:40] he'd rather go back to just the staff
[0:42] and the sheep and and and so what's
[0:44] compelling him to return is
[0:47] fear what's compelling him to return is
[0:50] unbelief what compelling him to return
[0:53] is discouragement in his life the word
[0:56] never said go back to being a shepherd
[0:58] of sheep word said you're the anointed
[1:01] king but David saying I don't see any
[1:04] manifestations of that promise in my
[1:06] life right now I do not see that I do
[1:09] not understand how you can do that so
[1:12] God take me
[1:14] back sometimes the fear of the unknown
[1:17] in front of
[1:18] us pushes us to go back to what's
[1:21] familiar but God says Don't Look Back it
[1:25] is vile in his sight to look back it is
[1:30] the mouth of the false prophet is the
[1:32] mouth of the Dragon in other words it's
[1:33] Antichrist to look back says Don't Look
[1:37] Back take the rear ofie mirr off cuz if
[1:39] you look back you're looking to the
[1:41] Antichrist and you'll crash Amen in your
[1:45] life and your Doctrine in your church
[1:47] don't look back but David in his
[1:50] discouragement says can't I just go
[1:56] back but let's not forget he's carrying
[2:00] the
[2:01] promise so now the very thing that
[2:04] becomes that has become his burden is
[2:08] the very thing that's going to resurrect
[2:11] him from the pit it's the very thing
[2:15] that's going to lift him from his
[2:18] discouragement that's sometimes we think
[2:21] that but we're in the heat of the battle
[2:24] something has got to be done we were
[2:26] boys once we're grownup men now the
[2:29] fight is on on I remember when the saos
[2:32] boiled up on the floor and the people
[2:33] screamed and shouted and you couldn't
[2:35] get around the place nowhere here for
[2:37] people but it's not that way today he
[2:39] says the battle is
[2:41] on it's not William brandham the little
[2:44] boy preacher anymore you got to produce
[2:48] something David you have to produce
[2:52] something it's not good enough that you
[2:54] were a shepherd and that you did it
[2:56] really good and you SL slayed the bear
[2:59] and you slayed the L that's good but
[3:01] that's not enough you need to produce
[3:03] something in your life there's got to be
[3:06] something
[3:07] different this time the time is on the
[3:11] battle is on the heat is on the time to
[3:14] be delivered the people Everyone is
[3:16] found written in the book now the time
[3:19] has
[3:21] come David is in his discouragement is
[3:23] trying to go back but something Rises up
[3:26] within David the very thing he's
[3:29] carrying that's causing discouragement
[3:31] Rises up within him and he says
[3:34] but you see he probably knew the story
[3:36] of Job And he says but I know my
[3:38] redeemer liveth but I know that one day
[3:41] I shall see God in this flesh though it
[3:43] be
[3:45] destroyed one day you will see
[3:48] God not when you die not when you
[3:50] Rapture but right now you have a promise
[3:55] of the word given to you calling you up
[3:57] saying you can do it you can do it
[4:01] cuz you're carrying the promise
