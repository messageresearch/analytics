[13:58] than two weeks
[14:00] that's a blessing amen i don't know that
[14:02] we've ever had that but it's been a

[14:09] wesley are back from idaho god bless you
[14:11] guys it's good to have you back
[14:13] amen while we're standing let's turn to
[14:15] luke chapter nine also before we read
[14:18] that i want to give you the results from
[14:19] sunday we had the vote to add to two
[14:22] additional uh deacons and they were both
[14:24] approved by the congregation brother
[14:26] jonathan baumgartner had a 95 percent
[14:28] yes vote and brother ilya luzonov had 91
[14:31] approval so we thank god we thank god
[14:34] for the congregation

[14:37] that god will bless them mightily and
[14:40] inspire them anoint them and use them as
[14:43] they serve this local body
[14:46] amen let's look at luke chapter 9
[14:50] verse 62.
[14:58] luke 9 and 62 and jesus said unto him
[15:01] no man having put his hand to the plow
[15:04] and looking back is fit for the kingdom
[15:06] of god
[15:07] amen you may have your seats
[15:10] so what a statement no man having put
[15:13] his hand to the plow and looking back is
[15:15] fit for the kingdom of god
[15:18] amen and
[15:19] i want to preach a message this evening
[15:22] titled looking ahead it's just something
[15:23] god's been stirring on my heart a simple
[15:25] thought but i want to talk about looking
[15:27] ahead
[15:28] there's so many places to look amen
[15:31] there's so many distractions in the
[15:32] world today amen but i think the best
[15:35] place to look is to look ahead amen
[15:37] let's turn to philippians chapter 3.
[15:48] philippians chapter 3 and verse 13.
[15:53] brethren
[15:54] i count not myself to have apprehended
[15:56] but this one thing i do forgetting those
[15:58] things which are behind and reaching
[16:00] forth in those things which are before i
[16:02] press toward the mark for the prize of
[16:05] the high calling of god in christ jesus
[16:09] i love the fact that the apostle paul
[16:10] says these words because we hold apostle
[16:12] paul in such high regard and he was the
[16:15] one who had private revelation from
[16:17] jesus christ himself he was the he was
[16:20] the one who was responsible for
[16:21] delivering the message of grace amen to
[16:24] bring them from the law and to grace he
[16:26] was the one who was responsible for
[16:28] establishing the new testament church
[16:30] and writing almost all the new testament
[16:33] amen and so this is a man who had
[16:35] tremendous revelation he was the first
[16:37] church age messenger a prophet of god
[16:39] amen he was he was bringing the them out
[16:42] of the the law into the dispensation of
[16:44] grace it was just a powerful powerful uh
[16:47] ministry and all that goes with it with
[16:50] tremendous revelation and the apostle
[16:52] paul can say i'm still pressing on amen
[16:55] i'm still reaching forward amen
[16:57] forgetting those things are behind i'm
[16:59] reaching forward to those things that
[17:00] are ahead and here we are amen when the
[17:03] word has been restored back to paul's
[17:05] gospel and the seals have been open and
[17:08] we've been given so much amen i want to
[17:10] still have the attitude that i'm
[17:12] reaching forth amen i want to be
[17:14] reaching for more if there's more of
[17:16] christ to have i want more of christ
[17:18] amen i'm so thankful for what i have but
[17:20] i don't ever want to be satisfied just
[17:23] what i've had yesterday if there's more
[17:24] available i want the more amen
[17:27] and to think that we've come to the end
[17:29] of revelation is is is
[17:32] is funny
[17:35] god will be unfolding himself throughout
[17:37] eternity amen we're talking about god
[17:39] almighty and we've come to the end of
[17:42] god there's no way we've come to the end
[17:44] of god and all that's been given us the
[17:46] revelation that's been given the the
[17:48] personal revelation that we've received
[17:51] amen is is you know i don't know how to
[17:54] measure how far we've come and how far
[17:56] we have left to go i mean i was talking
[17:58] to some brothers and sisters the other
[18:00] day and i was i was using the analogy
[18:02] amen if if i go from a four-year-old to
[18:05] a five-year-old to no schooling at all
[18:08] and then now i'm graduating kindergarten
[18:11] all right
[18:12] i know so much more coming out of
[18:14] kindergarten than i did before i went in
[18:17] like the level of my understanding the
[18:19] knowledge i've gained the instruction i
[18:21] received
[18:22] i mean i'm light years ahead of where i
[18:24] was
[18:25] but in
[18:26] comparison to where i need to be
[18:29] to graduate in 11 years i haven't even
[18:31] scratched the surface amen and i'm
[18:34] wondering if this life isn't maybe
[18:35] something like that amen we've come to
[18:38] the message we've gotten so much but how
[18:40] much more is there to attain in the
[18:42] things of god how much more of god is
[18:44] there to discover how much more of the
[18:46] message is still waiting to be unveiled
[18:48] amen
[18:49] how much is laying in our books and our
[18:51] tapes how much is in our bible i mean
[18:53] that we haven't even
[18:55] gained an understanding of yet and i say
[18:57] lord help me to be reaching forward amen
[19:00] help me to be constantly saying god i
[19:02] want to see you more clearly than i've
[19:04] seen you before i want to know you
[19:06] better i want to have a deeper
[19:07] relationship with you i want to have
[19:09] more intimacy and a greater
[19:11] understanding
[19:13] a greater vision all the time so i want
[19:16] to be looking ahead amen not relying on
[19:19] what's happened in the past what's
[19:21] happened in the past is wonderful but
[19:22] what's happened in the past is my
[19:24] encouragement to keep pressing forward
[19:28] brother bam gives this story he tells it
[19:30] in several places but i picked it up
[19:32] here in in 1954 god's preparation
[19:36] said it's just like one time one of my
[19:37] managers mr baxter said he was in canada
[19:40] and there was a prize given for anybody
[19:42] who could ride a four inch board a half
[19:44] a city block on a bicycle
[19:46] and they got all the experts down they
[19:48] had one little old boy there and
[19:50] all of them thought he was a really a
[19:52] and all those expert riders who
[19:54] could go downtown and get a box of
[19:55] groceries on their arms and ride back
[19:57] and never touch their handlebars they
[19:59] was going to win this new ivor johnson
[20:02] bicycle
[20:03] and said mr baxter said he got on and
[20:05] went about 20 feet and fell off all the
[20:07] rest of them tried it and this little
[20:09] boy jumped on there and just rode
[20:11] right straight out to the end without a
[20:13] bit of trouble so all the boys got
[20:15] around and said what how did you do it
[20:18] well what caused you to do it he said
[20:20] i'll tell you where you boys what you
[20:23] boys was doing he said you were looking
[20:25] down like this trying to keep on it
[20:28] said i watched the end
[20:30] i watched the end what it was at the end
[20:33] i just kept looking at the end and i
[20:35] held steady and went on through but if
[20:37] you're looking down like this you're
[20:39] wondering and each each little teeter
[20:41] while you pushed over like that and you
[20:43] fall off
[20:44] that's the way christians do
[20:46] brother i'm looking at the end down
[20:48] yonder yes sir somebody might say well
[20:50] branham's a spiritualist he's a witch
[20:52] he's a hypocrite that don't hurt me i'm
[20:55] looking at the end down yonder there's
[20:57] where it's going and i'm writing for
[20:59] dear life because there's a prize of
[21:02] life i want to meet him down there at
[21:04] the end as paul said at the end i fought
[21:06] a good fight i finished the course i
[21:08] kept the faith henceforth there was laid
[21:10] up for me a crown of righteousness the
[21:13] lord the righteous judge will give me at
[21:14] that day not only me but all those who
[21:17] love his appearing
[21:20] so he tells this story in several places
[21:22] but brother brahma said this is he's
[21:24] typing it with what christians do amen
[21:26] we we get so fixated on on things that
[21:30] are going on now amen looking down and
[21:33] making sure uh everything's right and
[21:35] it's so easy to get diverted and so easy
[21:38] to get distracted and easy to fall off
[21:40] but he said the solution is just to look
[21:42] to the goal amen just to look to the end
[21:44] and keep moving towards the end amen not
[21:47] fixating on where we are and not being
[21:50] so uh uh so so absorbed amen in what's
[21:54] going on right below our feet but get
[21:56] absorbed in where we're walking to and
[21:58] if we're pointed in the right direction
[22:00] we're going to make it to the right spot
[22:02] amen
[22:03] we can become so distracted amen with
[22:06] the things that are going on in our
[22:08] everyday life that we could easily get
[22:10] ourselves off course without even
[22:12] knowing it and teeter and fall off
[22:14] because we've become distracted by all
[22:16] the details of what's going on today and
[22:19] trying to navigate amen and today
[22:22] without focusing on where we're going
[22:24] and many times the solution today's
[22:27] problem is readdress what's the goal
[22:29] amen where's what am i aiming for what
[22:31] is my goal what is my direction and if
[22:34] i'll just refocus my goal it'll take
[22:36] care of today's problems
[22:40] amen
[22:41] there's so many times that i find myself
[22:45] over-corrected
[22:47] or under-corrected
[22:49] or whatever because you face an issue
[22:51] and you begin to fixate on whatever it
[22:54] is that's going on and then the issue at
[22:56] hand becomes the biggest distraction in
[22:58] life
[23:00] and you think shouldn't i pay attention
[23:02] if we have an issue if it's a spiritual
[23:03] issue a family issue a church issue
[23:05] shouldn't we pay attention to it yeah we
[23:07] should pay attention to it but many
[23:09] times amen
[23:11] it just becomes a greater distraction
[23:13] amen and and it's not we're many times
[23:16] we're not going to fix the problem by
[23:18] fixating on it
[23:20] how many times have we uh uh
[23:23] fixated on an issue that we're facing
[23:26] and and spent all of our energy and got
[23:28] completely absorbed and studying and
[23:30] analyzing and and and trying to figure
[23:33] out if this happens that will happen and
[23:35] if that goes then maybe this will happen
[23:36] and if i go a little here i'll correct a
[23:38] little here and it never works the way
[23:40] we think it's going to work but we've
[23:41] absorbed all of our time and all of our
[23:43] energy fixating on the issue when what
[23:45] we might need to do in the face of
[23:47] trouble is rise our eyes a little higher
[23:49] amen and find out where christ is and
[23:51] just make it towards him amen just keep
[23:54] pressing forward amen because the
[23:55] solution many times is in forward
[23:58] progress
[24:03] hebrews chapter 12. let's turn there
[24:04] together
[24:21] hebrews chapter 12
[24:25] verse 1.
[24:28] wherefore seeing
[24:29] we also are compassed about what's so
[24:31] great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[24:33] aside every weight and the sin which
[24:35] does so easily beset us and let us run
[24:38] with patience the race that is set
[24:39] before us
[24:41] looking unto jesus the author and
[24:43] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[24:45] that was set before him endured the
[24:47] cross despising the shame and is set
[24:50] down at the right hand of the throne of
[24:52] god
[24:54] so there's a certain laying aside every
[24:56] weight
[24:57] and forgetting it all and running
[25:01] with patience the race that is set
[25:03] before us
[25:04] to keep moving not start and stop start
[25:07] and stop start and stop but to keep
[25:09] moving
[25:11] you you know the story of the tortoise
[25:13] and the hair
[25:15] right
[25:16] the the the tortoise isn't the best
[25:18] runner the tortoise has no chance of
[25:20] beating the hair the hair is so much
[25:22] faster but the hair is overly
[25:24] self-confident and the hair has this
[25:26] problem of wanting to stop and take a
[25:28] break and rest and all that but the
[25:30] tortoise all the tortoise does is keep
[25:32] putting one foot in front of the other
[25:34] and one foot in for the other it's not
[25:35] flashly it's not stylish amen i mean
[25:38] nobody makes action videos of the
[25:40] tortoise and is running i mean this
[25:42] isn't a highlight reel he does the same
[25:44] thing over and over and over but no
[25:46] matter how many times you read that
[25:48] story the tortoise always wins amen
[25:51] and i wonder how many times we tried to
[25:52] be flashy chris christians and big this
[25:54] and big that this gift and this stylish
[25:57] thing and what what we need to do is
[25:59] trust god and just keep putting one foot
[26:01] in front of the other amen keep our eyes
[26:04] focused on the prize not starting and
[26:06] starting and stopping and starting but
[26:08] just continually moving amen towards the
[26:11] goal amen in that goal amen is jesus
[26:13] christ amen to become just like him
[26:17] that's what this message is this message
[26:19] is christ amen the goal is christ the
[26:21] goal is union with christ in christ
[26:23] living in you and i
[26:25] and so not starting and stopping and i
[26:28] ran good for a while and then i stopped
[26:31] for a while and i ran good for a while
[26:32] and i stopped for a while amen there's
[26:35] too many christians like that
[26:37] and and it can look good for a while
[26:39] because while we're running i mean we're
[26:41] witnessing to all kinds of people and
[26:43] talking about the message and i read
[26:45] this and i read that but then all of a
[26:47] sudden they took a break from being a
[26:48] believer for a little while
[26:51] and the tortoise the tortoise doesn't
[26:54] have
[26:55] i mean he doesn't have what the hair has
[26:58] he may not have amen the
[27:01] the the knowledge that the hair has he
[27:03] may not be able to quote things right
[27:04] off like that but he's got one thing for
[27:06] sure he knows the goal and he knows how
[27:08] to get to the goal and he never stops
[27:11] moving towards the end
[27:14] i say praise god for faithfulness
[27:17] we want to be found faithful
[27:19] now jesus it says endured the cross so
[27:22] we need to look unto jesus the author
[27:24] and finisher of our faith
[27:26] who it says
[27:29] for the joy that was set before him
[27:31] endured the cross despising the shame
[27:34] and set down the right hand of the
[27:36] throne of god and so i found this
[27:39] encouraging to me for the joy that lay
[27:42] before him jesus had to fixate on a goal
[27:45] he had to look to the goal and the goal
[27:48] it was beyond calvary amen the goal was
[27:51] for the glory that lay ahead but he must
[27:53] endure the cross despising the shame
[27:56] which means that jesus christ he wasn't
[27:59] looking forward to calvary in the flesh
[28:01] he was actually despising the shame
[28:04] despising the mockery of the whole event
[28:06] it didn't he didn't have to like it or
[28:09] enjoy it but he was willing to endure it
[28:12] because he saw a prize beyond the trial
[28:15] and the prize beyond the trial made it
[28:17] worth walking into the trial
[28:19] [Music]
[28:21] you know he's he said when he comes to
[28:23] gethsemane and gethsemane he's wrestling
[28:25] this out because it's not something
[28:27] that's easy it's not something that he
[28:29] would enjoy it's not something that's
[28:31] pleasant so the wrestling of our lord in
[28:33] gethsemane was a genuine wrestling he
[28:35] was wrestling with his own flesh to
[28:37] bring that flesh subject to the will and
[28:39] word of god but
[28:41] what gave him the grace to move forward
[28:43] for the glory that lay ahead he endured
[28:45] the cross despising the shame
[28:48] and there are some things in life that
[28:50] aren't easy
[28:53] is that right
[28:56] not all of life is pleasant not all of
[28:58] life is easy
[29:00] not all not every part of serving the
[29:03] lord is easy
[29:05] there are some difficulties
[29:07] that lay in there
[29:10] but
[29:11] but can we
[29:12] have a
[29:13] prize
[29:15] in our eyes
[29:17] that makes every obstacle worth the
[29:19] enduring
[29:21] that makes every trial rejection
[29:24] heartache disappointment
[29:26] it's all worth it because i'm not living
[29:29] for the pleasure that i get in this life
[29:31] i'm living for another pleasure that'll
[29:33] come in another life listen
[29:36] the greatest times that we can have on
[29:37] this earth pale in comparison to what's
[29:40] coming
[29:42] the most pleasurable time of our life
[29:44] here the most satisfying event we ever
[29:47] participated in it can't even compare to
[29:50] what is coming amen what is coming is so
[29:52] much greater than what we have amen so
[29:55] so we need to to me this is just where
[29:57] god's dealing with me is i want to start
[30:00] putting my my eyes above this earth and
[30:03] beyond this life and stop being
[30:06] disappointed when life is disappointing
[30:08] but to expect life to be disappointing
[30:10] because i'm not living for this life i'm
[30:13] living for the one that's coming and now
[30:15] my investments my heart my desire all
[30:18] the prize that i want is coming ahead
[30:21] not here i'm not looking for this to
[30:23] become pleasurable my pleasure lays
[30:25] ahead
[30:27] because if we're still trying to make
[30:29] this earth our millennium we're going to
[30:31] be disappointed all the time
[30:34] constantly we're going to be discouraged
[30:36] and disappointed because we will never
[30:38] get this life to work out perfect all
[30:41] the time in fact it's full of it's full
[30:45] of destruction it's full of perversion
[30:47] it's full of corruption it's full of
[30:49] error amen it's full of filth it's full
[30:52] of ungodliness amen and it's not going
[30:54] to get better it's only going to get
[30:56] worse amen it's not going to be a more
[30:58] conducive place for a christian to live
[31:00] it's going to get worse amen so why are
[31:02] we spending all of our time amen trying
[31:05] to make this our little paradise instead
[31:08] of forgetting about this and focusing on
[31:10] the real paradise and moving forward in
[31:12] the gospel moving forward with the
[31:14] message amen and moving forward in
[31:16] revelation and saying god amen it's not
[31:18] this i'm living for it's that that i'm
[31:20] living for
[31:23] praise god
[31:25] we had an event take place at our house
[31:26] sunday that was
[31:28] interesting
[31:30] we got up in the morning got ready i was
[31:32] getting ready to come and preach and
[31:34] just before i left the house
[31:36] the water started rising
[31:39] and the toilets and the bathtubs and all
[31:41] over and i realized we have a
[31:44] something wrong with the plumbing
[31:48] and it was rising and coming up and
[31:50] there was a threat of it spilling over
[31:52] and and all of a sudden but i gotta come
[31:54] preach you know what can you do
[31:56] and so i came on the church i said don't
[31:59] don't use the water don't do anything
[32:01] i'll look at it when i get back so i
[32:02] come to church and and then while i'm in
[32:05] the back getting ready just a little bit
[32:06] before i come out maybe 20 or 30 minutes
[32:09] i get a call from my wife and she says
[32:12] just after you left and then something
[32:14] happened and it started coming out of
[32:16] the toilet like a fountain you know and
[32:17] flowing over and getting on the floor
[32:19] and getting everywhere and i'm in the
[32:21] back getting ready to preach my house is
[32:23] flooding with backed up sewer water and
[32:26] i said
[32:27] oh god you gave me the house if it falls
[32:29] to ruin you'll fix it what can i do
[32:31] anyways
[32:34] because
[32:35] i'm not living for a house
[32:37] i mean i don't want a house you know
[32:39] flooded with sewage like nobody else
[32:41] wants that that's not what i'm looking
[32:43] for out of life that's not my desire
[32:45] amen and thankfully blake was able to
[32:47] run over there and david stayed home and
[32:49] they worked and they got things taken
[32:50] care of so we owe them a lot you know
[32:52] but god provided all i could do was turn
[32:55] that switch off because i got something
[32:57] more important to do it's the word of
[32:59] god it's more important than a house
[33:00] it's more important than backed up
[33:02] plumbing it's more god will have to take
[33:04] care of that because the things of this
[33:06] word are more important than the
[33:07] temporal things of life and god blessed
[33:10] us he took care of us everything got
[33:12] cleaned up everything's fine
[33:13] everything's all right amen but it's
[33:15] just one of those other tests in life
[33:17] and i'll tell you if anything's going to
[33:19] go wrong for me it's generally going to
[33:20] go wrong on a wednesday afternoon or a
[33:22] sunday morning and then you wonder why i
[33:25] mean why it's almost like god don't you
[33:28] know
[33:29] i'm supposed to be preaching
[33:32] but you know we got to become
[33:33] disconnected with the things of life
[33:37] and say god
[33:38] god gave me a house
[33:40] if i lose the house god will give me
[33:42] another house
[33:43] if something goes wrong god will take
[33:44] care of it i'm living for him and he'll
[33:47] take care of me as i live for him
[33:50] but my greatest desire is not a
[33:52] beautiful house the greatest desire in
[33:54] my life is not to have everything
[33:55] perfect the greatest desire in my life
[33:57] is to please him and walk pleasing to
[34:00] the lord
[34:01] to serve him and keep moving in this
[34:03] plan that he has for our life
[34:07] and so we get these little opportunities
[34:10] to find out what we really believe
[34:13] and that's all they are they're just
[34:14] tests that's all they are they're only
[34:16] tests
[34:17] they're not they're not punishments
[34:19] they're not god you know it's not it's
[34:21] not anything other than just a test to
[34:24] find out so that you can see where
[34:26] you're at amen and these things are good
[34:29] for us so we can find out where you're
[34:30] at amen if you you got a call tomorrow
[34:33] that from the bank that says oh there's
[34:35] been fraud somebody broke into your
[34:36] account and they wiped out your savings
[34:38] account for me i would chuckle because
[34:40] that's not a big deal anyways but
[34:43] for some others it might be a big deal
[34:45] amen but but what would we do amen would
[34:47] we lose our minds will we go crazy will
[34:50] we say i mean how am i going to survive
[34:52] amen you're going to survive the same
[34:54] way you would survive before amen
[34:55] because god has promised to take care of
[34:57] us he's promised to watch over us we
[34:59] need to get our eyes back on the prize
[35:02] and just keep moving forward and let god
[35:04] take care of what god's going to take
[35:05] care of if it comes it comes if it goes
[35:07] it goes that's just the way it is but
[35:10] i'm not here for that
[35:12] i'm here to serve god
[35:16] we need to be looking ahead
[35:18] let's go to luke 21.
[35:40] luke chapter 21
[35:42] i'd like to begin reading at verse 25
[35:49] and there shall be signs in the sun and
[35:51] in the moon and in the stars and upon
[35:52] the earth distress of nations with
[35:54] perplexity the sea and the waves roaring
[35:57] men's hearts failing them for fear and
[35:59] for looking after those things which are
[36:01] coming on the earth for the powers of
[36:03] heaven shall be shaken
[36:08] well you
[36:10] know men's hearts are failing for fear
[36:13] because of thing the things that are
[36:15] coming upon the earth
[36:17] but i hope our hearts aren't failing for
[36:19] fear
[36:21] because of the things that are happening
[36:22] in the earth
[36:25] he goes on to say in verse 27 then shall
[36:27] they see the son of man coming in a
[36:29] cloud with power and great glory praise
[36:31] god
[36:32] and then these things begin to come to
[36:34] pass and look up and lift up your heads
[36:36] for your redemption draweth nigh
[36:39] when you see the world falling apart
[36:41] amen and you've seen the sign of his
[36:43] coming amen look up and rejoice for your
[36:46] redemption draw with nigh amen this is
[36:49] not the time to lose heart amen every
[36:52] news broadcast being worse than the one
[36:53] before is good news not bad news amen
[36:57] our redemption draweth nigh
[36:59] amen we have seen his sign the sign of
[37:02] the son of man coming we've seen
[37:04] he's seen it in the cloud we've had the
[37:06] opening of the word the ministry of the
[37:08] son of man and we see perplexity among
[37:10] nations we see distress in the world and
[37:13] men's hearts failing for fear people no
[37:16] longer have confidence in anything they
[37:17] have nothing that they can attach their
[37:19] confidence to amen and so their hearts
[37:21] are failing for fear because they don't
[37:23] have anybody to protect them
[37:25] they don't they don't trust a government
[37:27] to protect them they don't trust in
[37:28] banks to protect them the financial
[37:30] system is not secure they have nothing
[37:32] to protect them amen so their hearts are
[37:34] failing for fear seeing the destruction
[37:37] and the chaos all around but for us we
[37:40] should have a greater confidence than
[37:41] we've ever had before because this is
[37:43] prophecy being fulfilled this is a
[37:45] guarantee that my lord already knew and
[37:47] he's already made a provision there's no
[37:49] reason for my heart to fail for fear
[37:52] because everything's happening the way
[37:53] he said it would happen it's time for me
[37:56] to look up not look down not look around
[37:58] but look up because my redemption
[38:00] draweth nine
[38:01] [Music]
[38:03] in the message the the falling apart of
[38:05] the world prophet says so this world is
[38:07] falling apart let her fall apart
[38:12] that's all right it's going to do it
[38:14] anyhow
[38:20] what did micah say here what did micah
[38:22] speak of the mountains will molt it'll
[38:24] run like wax and pour over like a
[38:25] glacier spurting up and some kind of a
[38:28] geyser rather shall melt and fall away
[38:30] but jehovah will remain forever all
[38:33] flesh is grasp the breath of god blows
[38:35] upon it whether it's flowers grass how
[38:38] beautiful it withers away but the word
[38:40] of god of our god stands forever
[38:44] isaiah 40 was prophesying of the coming
[38:46] of the messiah said that all our creeds
[38:48] denominational systems educators genius
[38:51] and everything else will perish but the
[38:53] word of god shall remain forever upon
[38:55] this rock i'll build my church and the
[38:57] gates of hell can't prevail against it
[39:01] what has god given to us his unfailing
[39:03] word of promise
[39:05] what has he opened to us the unfailing
[39:07] word what has he given us to sure rock
[39:09] the foundation he's given us the
[39:11] unmovable amen the unchangeable the word
[39:14] the revelation that was hid and gone
[39:16] from before the foundation of the world
[39:18] that is what we're focusing on that is
[39:20] what we're hiding and that is what we're
[39:22] standing upon that is what's guiding us
[39:25] amen it can't change it can't fail and
[39:27] we have absolute confidence
[39:30] in the word of god
[39:32] let's look at ii peter
[39:34] now
[39:43] second peter chapter three
[39:51] second peter chapter three verse nine
[39:54] the lord is not slack concerning his
[39:56] promises some men count slackness but
[39:58] his long-suffering to us word
[40:00] not willing that any should perish but
[40:02] that all should come to repentance
[40:04] but the day of the lord will come as a
[40:06] thief in the night in which the heavens
[40:08] shall pass away with a great noise and
[40:10] the elements shall melt with fervent
[40:12] heat the earth also and the works that
[40:14] are therein shall be burned up
[40:16] seeing then that all these things shall
[40:17] be dissolved
[40:19] what manner of persons ought ye to be in
[40:21] all holy conversation
[40:23] and golliness
[40:24] looking for and hasting unto the coming
[40:26] of the day of god wherein the heavens
[40:29] being on fire shall be dissolved and the
[40:31] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[40:33] nevertheless we according to his promise
[40:36] look for a new heavens and a new earth
[40:39] wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore
[40:41] beloved seeing that you look for such
[40:43] things be diligent that you may be found
[40:45] of him in peace without spot
[40:48] and blameless
[40:51] i love this at the end in verse 11
[40:53] seeing then that all these things shall
[40:55] be dissolved what everything
[40:58] what all things your house your car your
[41:02] place of work this building everything
[41:04] shall be dissolved
[41:08] seeing then that all these things shall
[41:09] be dissolved what manner of persons
[41:11] ought ye to be in all holy conversation
[41:14] and godliness
[41:16] amen that that car you love it'll go to
[41:20] the junkyard
[41:23] at some point it'll be parted out it'll
[41:25] be crushed it'll be melted down and
[41:27] poured into another car if time goes
[41:29] that far if not it'll be melted by a
[41:31] different kind of fire
[41:34] your house going to go up in flames
[41:37] everything all the all that glitters
[41:40] around the world all the glow of
[41:42] hollywood the glitter of hollywood and
[41:45] of every uh uh uh the pride of man
[41:47] that's built all of these structures
[41:49] it's all going to burn it's all going to
[41:50] go away every government will collapse
[41:52] every system of men will fail amen and
[41:54] if that be so what manner of persons
[41:56] ought we to be
[41:58] we're not not worried because the
[42:01] government's shaky well the government's
[42:03] shaky praise god all these kingdoms must
[42:05] be the kingdoms of our christ
[42:07] they must become the kingdoms of christ
[42:09] they must shake down amen we
[42:11] we desire to live in peace as long as we
[42:14] can but there's promises that things are
[42:16] not going to get better they're going to
[42:17] get worse amen and as they get worse we
[42:20] don't want to be those amen that become
[42:22] distracted by the worsening condition of
[42:24] the world amen and become teetering and
[42:27] and disillusioned and
[42:29] and stopping and starting but we need to
[42:31] stay focused on what god has given us
[42:33] and keep moving regardless of what
[42:35] happens in the world
[42:39] praise god
[42:42] matthew chapter six let's read this
[42:44] together
[42:46] these are all simple scriptures that we
[42:48] know really really well
[42:53] but the thought is so pertinent for the
[42:56] day chapter 6 verse 19 matthew chapter 6
[43:00] verse 19
[43:02] lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
[43:04] the earth
[43:05] where moth and rust doth corrupt and
[43:07] where thieves break through and steal
[43:10] but lay up for yourselves treasures in
[43:11] heaven where neither moth nor rust doth
[43:14] corrupt and where thieves do not break
[43:16] through nor steal
[43:17] for where your treasure is
[43:19] there will your heart be also
[43:23] that's sometimes why men's hearts are
[43:25] failing for fear because all their
[43:26] treasures are wrapped up in this life
[43:30] everything they have to live for is in
[43:31] this life only
[43:33] but but if your treasure is not here but
[43:36] your treasure is somewhere else amen
[43:38] than the prospects of all this falling
[43:40] apart and a new system coming is not a
[43:43] bad prospect because your treasures
[43:44] aren't here anyways
[43:46] and where your treasure is there will
[43:48] your heart be also amen we want to make
[43:50] sure that we looking ahead and laying up
[43:53] treasures because that's where our heart
[43:55] will be amen and when everything falls
[43:57] apart here our heart will not fail
[44:00] because my heart is safely entrusting in
[44:03] christ who can keep all the things that
[44:05] i've given to him he can be trusted to
[44:07] hold it amen eternally
[44:12] brother said in the message hear his
[44:14] voice
[44:15] he said but there's so many voices today
[44:17] that takes the voice of the lord away
[44:19] from us
[44:20] there's the voice of pleasure
[44:22] so many people are listening to that
[44:24] where they can go and have a good time
[44:26] and many of them are professing to be
[44:27] christians some kind of an old rock and
[44:29] roll come up they just can't listen
[44:32] to what god they say well i'm a
[44:34] christian i read a verse in the bible
[44:35] today yeah jesus wept that's it go ahead
[44:38] but then to really get down and pray
[44:40] they got too much many other things to
[44:42] do there's so many voices in the world
[44:45] so many things to attract our attention
[44:47] from god
[44:49] amen and brother graham talks about one
[44:50] of them having pleasure but there's so
[44:52] many things that distract our attention
[44:54] from god and not all of them that are
[44:56] you know are wicked things sometimes
[44:58] just making a living
[45:00] just working just taking care of a house
[45:03] amen there's times there's weeks in your
[45:05] life where work in a house and taking
[45:07] care of children is absolutely
[45:09] completely consuming amen or when the
[45:12] car breaks and the plumbing goes out and
[45:14] they want you to work overtime all at
[45:16] the same time and then you become
[45:17] completely consumed it's at that time
[45:20] those times that we have to stop amen we
[45:22] have to stop and we got to refocus
[45:24] because if we don't stop and refocus
[45:26] we're going to find ourselves teetering
[45:28] because we're not here just for work
[45:30] that's part of our life we're not here
[45:32] just for the house that's part of our
[45:33] life the things still have to be
[45:35] repaired the things still have to be
[45:37] taken care of the job you still have to
[45:39] keep your job but but we got to remember
[45:41] that that's not the whole point of our
[45:43] life that's part of our life but we're
[45:45] here to reflect the word we're here to
[45:48] manifest the word of god in our everyday
[45:50] life and stay focused on what's coming
[45:52] ahead
[45:54] and so when things pile up that's time
[45:56] to stop amen not to keep moving or move
[45:59] faster but it's a time to say time out i
[46:02] need to refocus
[46:04] i need to realign my vision amen because
[46:07] i find myself teetering i'm wobbling a
[46:10] little bit i need to stop and get my
[46:12] eyes fixed because you be
[46:14] it's amazing to see how much god can do
[46:16] amen when you trust him to get it done
[46:20] amen so many supernatural things can
[46:22] begin to take place but when we stop
[46:24] amen and start focusing on our attention
[46:27] on the problems and the issues and all
[46:29] of that
[46:30] and become distracted and absorbed with
[46:32] that amen then god kind of leaves us to
[46:34] ourself to fix our own problem
[46:37] we're going to sort this out and sort
[46:38] this and sort this out but so many times
[46:41] if we would just keep moving forward and
[46:43] as we're moving forward and keeping
[46:45] focused on what's right and do what we
[46:47] can so many things just come together
[46:50] it's amazing watching people's lives and
[46:53] being a part of people's lives
[46:55] i'll tell you this
[46:57] it always works out
[47:00] what are you talking about brother chad
[47:02] i mean it always works out
[47:04] but what works out
[47:05] everything
[47:08] it always works out
[47:10] how many of you are homeless
[47:13] have nothing to eat today
[47:15] how many
[47:16] it always works out
[47:20] god is faithful to his promised word
[47:23] it always works out
[47:25] i mean your whole world might come
[47:27] crashing down and 10 things go wrong on
[47:29] the same day and i promise you it will
[47:31] all work out
[47:33] it always works out
[47:35] i i've been through people through dark
[47:38] times through difficulties through
[47:40] circumstances and issues and i've
[47:42] watched amen it will stay focused and
[47:44] centered on christ it always works out
[47:47] the finances always turn around the
[47:49] thing always gets fixed the solution
[47:51] always comes it always works out amen
[47:55] don't we we don't want to be distracted
[47:57] when life throws a bunch of hurdles in
[47:59] our way amen just sail over the hurdle
[48:02] and keep running towards the prize don't
[48:04] worry about it it's going to work out
[48:06] this too shall pass whatever you're
[48:08] going through this too shall pass
[48:13] there's so many distractions that come
[48:16] tests that come the devil will try to
[48:18] distract
[48:20] god will allow the test
[48:22] so that we learn how to run the race
[48:24] with patience
[48:26] but
[48:28] but we must stay
[48:30] focused there's some good questions to
[48:32] ask ourselves all the time
[48:34] why am i here
[48:36] what is my purpose in this life
[48:41] and what does this matter long term
[48:45] whatever is going on what does this
[48:46] matter long term
[48:49] because i have been so burnt out about
[48:52] the smallest issues
[48:54] i mean to me there were great big giant
[48:56] issues and i got so burnt out and so
[48:59] stressed and so worried over them but
[49:01] now i'm down the road a little further i
[49:03] look back and it was nothing it was a
[49:05] not it became an absolute non-issue amen
[49:08] but it was like the biggest issue of my
[49:10] life at the time but it worked out
[49:12] everything sorted out and it's not a
[49:14] problem
[49:15] and everything works out
[49:19] just trust god
[49:21] and move forward his word will solve
[49:24] every problem
[49:25] his promise will endure through every
[49:27] obstacle he has never failed to keep his
[49:30] word he will never fail yet to keep his
[49:32] word
[49:34] but we must have confidence
[49:36] in god
[49:38] there's so many there's so many things
[49:41] that we could look at
[49:43] so we go back to the
[49:45] boys riding the bike you know they could
[49:47] look down at the problem at hand and
[49:49] fixate on it and become distracting
[49:52] they could look around at what's going
[49:54] on in the crowd and the cheering crowd
[49:56] and and what's going over here and they
[49:57] could get distracted but there was only
[49:59] one place to
[50:01] look to win the prize and that was to
[50:03] look to the end amen what the goal was
[50:06] and so it's always good to ask my
[50:07] question what's my goal in life
[50:10] why am i here what's my purpose and what
[50:13] is my goal in life is it to to get a
[50:16] certain position at work to save a
[50:18] certain amount of money i mean poor
[50:20] brother dave wood he bust my bubble the
[50:22] other day
[50:24] we were sitting talking and brother dave
[50:25] said i used to think when i get older
[50:28] and i can retire and i can do anything i
[50:30] want and it'll be so great and i'll have
[50:33] this all this time he said then you
[50:35] retire you have no time it's not that
[50:37] great is that right brother dave i said
[50:39] brother dave don't tell me that
[50:42] i'm still dreaming that retirement will
[50:44] be this utopia and everything will work
[50:46] out fine and he said when you get there
[50:48] it's not like that and i believe him
[50:49] because everything that has happened in
[50:51] my life every milestone and achievement
[50:53] that i thought was going to be the
[50:55] answer never was the answer
[50:58] the promotion wasn't the answer the
[50:59] graduation wasn't the answer nothing was
[51:01] the answer amen this life is not
[51:04] this life is not to keep us here to keep
[51:07] us playing in one position but life is
[51:09] structured to keep us moving towards a
[51:11] goal
[51:14] so now i've just thrown away all my
[51:16] dreams for retirement
[51:20] thank you brother dave
[51:26] the devil would love for us to forget
[51:27] who we are
[51:29] why we're here
[51:30] and where we're going
[51:33] he would love to have us as christians
[51:35] going around in circles
[51:37] distracted
[51:38] wobbling falling off trying to get back
[51:41] on falling off
[51:42] he would love to keep us distracted
[51:45] and disoriented and detoured
[51:50] but we have a message
[51:52] we know the mind of god
[51:55] we know why we're here we know what his
[51:57] purpose is for us we know where we're
[51:58] going we know what comes next amen and
[52:01] for the glory that lay ahead we'll
[52:03] endure whatever comes along because the
[52:04] glory that lay ahead is so worth
[52:07] enduring whatever we endure in life
[52:10] brother bram says in the masterpiece
[52:13] he talks about a a vision that he had
[52:16] had of the preview of the bride so then
[52:18] as they started leaving two or three of
[52:20] them in the back kind of get out of step
[52:23] and i was going to holler at them and
[52:24] they was trying to get back in step and
[52:27] i seen them just in the vision just fade
[52:29] out and change from me
[52:32] says and the reason they were dressed in
[52:34] different parts shall come from all
[52:36] nations it'll make up the bride each one
[52:38] had long hair and no makeup and real
[52:40] pretty girls and they were watching me
[52:43] that represented the bride coming out of
[52:45] all nations see
[52:46] she each one represented a nation as
[52:49] they march perfectly in line with the
[52:50] word
[52:52] and then i have to watch her this is
[52:54] brother eminem saying i have to watch
[52:55] her he said they were watching me and he
[52:58] said i have to watch her
[53:01] i have to watch her she'll get out of
[53:02] step with that word if i don't watch
[53:05] when she is passing by if she gets by
[53:08] maybe it'll be my time
[53:10] when i'm oversee when i'm finished or
[53:11] whatever it is what they was getting
[53:13] back trying their best it was getting
[53:16] back just get in line because they was
[53:18] looking out somewhere else watching
[53:20] about that church that just went out
[53:21] into chaos
[53:23] the front ones never the back ones just
[53:25] two or three of them was kind of stepped
[53:27] out a little bit to the right side and
[53:30] looked like was trying to get back in
[53:31] line as they went by they just passed me
[53:34] oh far is here to the wall past me and i
[53:36] was standing there and then i just seen
[53:38] it all move out and leave so brother man
[53:41] we know this this vision that he has of
[53:43] the preview of the bride he sees a
[53:45] perfect bride coming by in review and
[53:48] she's perfect marching and he says not
[53:50] just marching but walking like a lady
[53:52] gracefully marching by amen and she said
[53:54] she was just perfect and and it was
[53:56] beautiful amen then come another one and
[53:59] then the voice told him now we'll see
[54:01] the review of the church and now the
[54:03] church has come by and he said oh it was
[54:04] dirty and it was filthy and it was
[54:06] immoral and it was it was wrong and they
[54:08] were going off into chaos and his heart
[54:11] was breaking and he was so discouraged
[54:13] but then he says but the bride will come
[54:15] again amen and then he finds now the
[54:17] bride's marching and this is the end
[54:19] time bride
[54:20] and the end time bride now is marching
[54:22] the first one was the first bride this
[54:24] is the end time bride she's got to come
[54:26] back again and as she's marching by she
[54:29] was supposed to be looking at the
[54:30] prophet and the prophet was watching her
[54:32] to keep her and step with the word but
[54:35] she got distracted looking somewhere
[54:37] else at the worldly church that was
[54:39] going on from the chaos and when she
[54:41] looked away from the prophet amen she
[54:43] got out of step with the word
[54:47] and brother ben was crying get back in
[54:49] step and when he saw the vision leave
[54:51] she was trying to get back in line she'd
[54:54] not get in line with other believers she
[54:56] was trying to get in line with the word
[54:58] amen
[54:59] and she got distracted by the worldly
[55:01] church and i say god help us not to be
[55:04] distracted by anything but keep our eyes
[55:07] fixed on that voice that god gave us in
[55:09] this day the message that came through
[55:11] the messenger to keep us lined up with
[55:13] the word he was screaming out in the end
[55:15] of his ministry to stay in line with the
[55:17] word amen after the seals he was
[55:19] preaching to the bride stay in line stay
[55:22] in step stay in harmony with this
[55:24] revealed word amen if we'll stay not
[55:27] watching anything else but watching this
[55:29] word amen to stay in step with the word
[55:34] you can see why this is such a
[55:36] distracting time in life why this is
[55:38] such a distracting age amen because this
[55:41] is the age that god will bring the
[55:42] restoration of his word and if we'll
[55:45] focus on that word that word will keep
[55:47] us in line and bring us to our
[55:49] destination and solve every problem
[55:51] along the way but you can see why the
[55:53] devil will create an eden where there'll
[55:55] be distraction upon distraction upon
[55:57] distraction and there'll be every reason
[56:00] for us to be upset disoriented
[56:02] discouraged troubled
[56:04] all around amen because anything to get
[56:08] us to look away from that message look
[56:10] away from that prophet and get
[56:12] distracted and get off step but oh god
[56:15] help us heed the voice of the prophet i
[56:17] mean as he was screaming at the end get
[56:19] back in step get back in step with the
[56:22] word
[56:23] this word was given to us to give us
[56:25] everything we needed to finish the race
[56:29] it was the last thing that was poured
[56:30] into the bride it was the last measure
[56:33] that was given to her to help her to
[56:34] finish the last leg of this race
[56:37] and let's stay in in line with the word
[56:42] first corinthians chapter nine let's
[56:44] turn there
[56:59] first corinthians chapter 9
[57:04] verse 24
[57:07] know you not that they which run in a
[57:09] race run all
[57:11] but one receiveth the prize
[57:14] so run that ye may obtain
[57:16] and every man that striveth for mastery
[57:18] is tempered in all things now they do it
[57:20] to obtain a corruptable crown
[57:22] but we
[57:24] uncorruptable
[57:26] everybody who runs in this race is
[57:28] running but one person is going to get
[57:29] the prize so he's he's admonishing the
[57:31] believers you run like you're the one
[57:34] who's going to get the prize
[57:36] and he who runs in the race is temperate
[57:38] and all things he has self-control
[57:40] because he has a goal he's not going to
[57:42] get distracted he's not going to be
[57:44] moved off course because he wants to win
[57:47] the prize and the apostle paul is
[57:49] telling us this is how we should run our
[57:51] race as christians temperate in all
[57:53] things not allowing pleasures or
[57:55] distractions or other things to knock us
[57:58] off course amen but to be tempered in
[58:00] all things and to run the race so that
[58:02] we might obtain the prize
[58:08] says in the message shalom
[58:10] do as david did
[58:12] put your future into his hands
[58:15] don't look to anything else
[58:17] david said said my time is in his hands
[58:19] you notice here in the psalms where we
[58:21] read it in in 62 my time is in his hand
[58:24] he is my rock what is he he is revealed
[58:27] to me he is the revealed truth my time
[58:30] is in his hands amen oh my there you are
[58:33] my time belongs to him i am his i'm in
[58:36] his hand because he holds the time i
[58:38] don't know what the future holds but i
[58:40] know who holds the future
[58:42] so he who holds the future holds me so
[58:45] why should i think about setting forth
[58:47] this that or the other for the new year
[58:49] i just put myself in his hands and
[58:51] walked like david did my time is in his
[58:53] hands he knew that god held the future
[58:56] david didn't know what the future was
[58:58] but he know god had the future i don't
[59:00] know what the future is none of us do
[59:02] but we know he holds the future
[59:06] we're standing here at the end of time
[59:09] and we're watching the world fall into
[59:11] chaos we're watching everything
[59:14] crumble all around us and we know amen
[59:18] god has given us a vision of what's
[59:20] coming next amen but we don't know how
[59:23] to get from here to there what are the
[59:25] steps what are the obstacles what are
[59:27] the events that shall transpire what are
[59:29] the events on the local level what are
[59:31] the events on a global level what what
[59:33] things are going to transpire we don't
[59:36] know all the details but we know one
[59:39] thing i'm in his hand the one who holds
[59:41] the future holds me i don't have to
[59:44] worry about the next obstacle the next
[59:46] global crisis the next thing i don't
[59:48] have to worry about it because i'm in
[59:50] his hand he already knows about it he
[59:52] knows the destination if i'll stay
[59:54] connected to him i will get right
[59:56] through the next global catastrophe
[1:00:00] i'll go right through the next local
[1:00:02] catastrophe i'll go through my next
[1:00:04] personal catastrophe
[1:00:08] because
[1:00:09] the one who holds the future who holds
[1:00:11] eternity holds me the one who came up
[1:00:13] with the plan to begin with is the one
[1:00:15] who's leading me in this journey i just
[1:00:17] put my hand in his and just walk
[1:00:21] i don't need to
[1:00:23] exert all kinds of mental energy trying
[1:00:25] to figure it out because i won't figure
[1:00:27] it out
[1:00:30] just walk
[1:00:32] just keep moving
[1:00:34] by his grace
[1:00:36] it'll all work out
[1:00:40] james tells us
[1:00:41] go to now you say today or tomorrow we
[1:00:44] will go into such a city and continue
[1:00:45] there a year and buy and sell and get
[1:00:47] gain whereas you know not what shall be
[1:00:50] on the morrow for what is your life
[1:00:52] it is even a vapor that appears for a
[1:00:54] little time and then vanishes away for
[1:00:57] that you ought to say if the lord will
[1:00:59] we shall live and do this or that
[1:01:03] amen we're all guilty of this
[1:01:06] we'll get our calendars out
[1:01:10] do it all the time i do it all the time
[1:01:12] and we'll put events in and fill up the
[1:01:13] calendar
[1:01:15] my calendar is completely full
[1:01:17] and i'm going to do this and i'm going
[1:01:18] to do that i'm going to do that but
[1:01:20] really i have no idea what i'm going to
[1:01:22] do 10 minutes from now
[1:01:24] that's up to god
[1:01:27] i mean i've got things we need to plan
[1:01:28] there's goals that we need to have
[1:01:30] there's nothing wrong with that but i
[1:01:32] hold them all loosely because it may
[1:01:33] never happen and if it doesn't ever
[1:01:35] happen it needs to be fine with me if
[1:01:37] none of those things happen as long as i
[1:01:40] i'm in god's will and i'm walking in his
[1:01:42] hand
[1:01:45] if it god wills we'll do this if god
[1:01:47] wills will do that it's not something
[1:01:48] that we all have to start you know it's
[1:01:50] not a a chant we almost make every time
[1:01:52] we make a plan but it's an attitude we
[1:01:54] must have every time we make a plan
[1:01:57] that i will do this if it's god's will i
[1:01:59] will go here if it's in god's will i
[1:02:00] will do this if it serves god's purpose
[1:02:03] but but i am yielded to god's plan
[1:02:06] all the time
[1:02:08] not my own plans
[1:02:12] psalms 90 verse 10 says the days of our
[1:02:14] years are three score years and 10 at 70
[1:02:17] years
[1:02:18] and if by reason of strength they'd be
[1:02:20] four score years that's 80. yet is there
[1:02:23] strength labor and sorrow for it is soon
[1:02:26] cut off and we fly away
[1:02:30] james said our life is a vapor
[1:02:33] said it's 70 years with strength 80 and
[1:02:36] then it's cut off and we fly away
[1:02:40] and if we look at 80 years or 80 plus
[1:02:42] years compared with eternity
[1:02:46] there is no comparison
[1:02:50] you know we
[1:02:51] we can't help ourselves but come into
[1:02:53] this world with spiritual amnesia
[1:02:56] and all we've experienced is this life
[1:02:58] and we've counted days the way everybody
[1:03:00] else counts days and weeks and months
[1:03:03] and years the way everybody else counts
[1:03:05] time and we've lived and grown and these
[1:03:07] bodies but the word came to break our
[1:03:10] spiritual amnesia and return us to the
[1:03:12] understanding that we are eternal beings
[1:03:14] amen we existed before time we exist
[1:03:18] after time and this little blip in the
[1:03:20] radar really is nothing in our eternal
[1:03:23] existence
[1:03:24] this is a time of testing this is a time
[1:03:28] of character building this is a school
[1:03:30] that we're in so we can learn and gain
[1:03:33] character and learn the things we need
[1:03:35] to rule and reign with christ amen this
[1:03:37] is this is not the goal amen this was
[1:03:40] just part of the plan to get us to the
[1:03:43] goal we need to stop living like this is
[1:03:45] the goal and come back to realizing this
[1:03:48] is just my school amen i don't ever
[1:03:50] remember being in school thinking i want
[1:03:53] to do this all my life
[1:03:57] i hope i get to do this 70 or 80 years
[1:04:00] no i knew this was a short period of
[1:04:02] time and when i this was a goal to get
[1:04:04] me to something else it was to get me to
[1:04:06] independence to a job to a career so i
[1:04:09] could live on my own
[1:04:11] and this life is this isn't the goal
[1:04:13] friends this is just to get us to the
[1:04:15] goal this is part of the training and
[1:04:17] it's a spec amen it's just a spec it's
[1:04:20] nothing amen we need to not uh we need
[1:04:23] to just keep focused on what is eternal
[1:04:25] and what is of true value
[1:04:28] job told us man that is born of a woman
[1:04:30] is a few days job 14 verse 1
[1:04:33] man that is born of a woman is a few
[1:04:35] days and full of trouble he cometh forth
[1:04:37] like a flower and it's cut down he
[1:04:39] fleeth also as a shadow and continueth
[1:04:42] not
[1:04:43] that's not very discouraging i mean
[1:04:44] that's pretty discouraging
[1:04:46] not very encouraging but when we
[1:04:48] understand why we're here
[1:04:51] then it puts everything into perspective
[1:04:56] brother branham says and spiritual
[1:04:58] adoption from 1956
[1:05:01] and there it is
[1:05:02] just one thing after the other and
[1:05:04] sickness on every hand
[1:05:06] i'm so glad there's a way out
[1:05:09] i'm so glad we don't have to stay here
[1:05:11] forever too aren't you
[1:05:13] what would we do if i had to live in
[1:05:15] this pest house forever
[1:05:17] i'm so glad there's an open door
[1:05:19] and that's all the earth is just a pest
[1:05:22] house just as soon as you think we're
[1:05:23] running all right then here comes
[1:05:25] something else along and get here here
[1:05:27] comes something else but i'm so glad
[1:05:29] that there's a way out so happy that the
[1:05:31] lord jesus has come and made a way of
[1:05:34] escape
[1:05:36] brother bam said aren't you glad there's
[1:05:38] something called death
[1:05:40] aren't you glad that as your body
[1:05:42] deteriorates and brother bam told us
[1:05:45] one thing i love about the prophet of
[1:05:47] god amen is he was so real and he was so
[1:05:50] normal
[1:05:52] he wasn't
[1:05:54] a super spiritualist into fanaticism he
[1:05:56] was a normal person
[1:05:58] and he acted in a normal way you could
[1:06:00] relate to him because he wasn't a
[1:06:02] fanatic amen he wasn't he wasn't trying
[1:06:04] to confess that he never had problems
[1:06:06] but he realized he even said now he said
[1:06:09] we've got these aches and pains and we
[1:06:10] know as we get older these things will
[1:06:12] come
[1:06:15] this is a man who preached divine
[1:06:16] healing and had a gift of healing in his
[1:06:18] life that was a minister to him by an
[1:06:20] angel and he's admitting the reality of
[1:06:23] life is as we get older these things
[1:06:25] must come on and they'll come more and
[1:06:27] more as we as we age and he says he says
[1:06:31] i just hope god gives me strength to
[1:06:33] endure it
[1:06:38] he's not even saying i'll never have
[1:06:40] i've got faith he had faith but he also
[1:06:43] knew that this body is sown in
[1:06:45] corruption this is part of the fall it
[1:06:47] has to be reversed everything has been
[1:06:49] changed until that time this is the
[1:06:51] reality that we live in
[1:06:54] i love the prophet of god being normal
[1:06:58] being a human being that you and i could
[1:07:00] relate to
[1:07:02] i want to be real like him
[1:07:04] not a religious fanatic but the reality
[1:07:07] of life and understand my position and
[1:07:09] how to live in this life how to to to
[1:07:12] deal with people how to love people how
[1:07:15] to deal with situations it was all
[1:07:17] demonstrated for us in this end time
[1:07:20] and i thank god for it
[1:07:21] he said these things come i'm so
[1:07:23] thankful there's death to get us out of
[1:07:25] this pestilence he says look at bill
[1:07:27] dowell he said he's 90 years old can you
[1:07:29] imagine another 30 40 years amen can you
[1:07:32] imagine amen your body deteriorating
[1:07:34] down to where you have no mobility no
[1:07:36] quality of life an absolute
[1:07:38] deterioration but you can't die there's
[1:07:40] no freedom there's no way to get out of
[1:07:42] the pest house but it gets weaker and
[1:07:44] weaker and more deteriorated all the
[1:07:46] time i said thank god this is not my
[1:07:49] destination amen
[1:07:51] this this world is not my home i'm just
[1:07:53] a passing through i'm here to gain
[1:07:55] character i'm here to display the word
[1:07:58] i'm here to become the manifested word
[1:08:00] for this day as christ lives his life
[1:08:02] through me i'm here to shine the
[1:08:04] glorious gospel of the end time as i
[1:08:06] yield myself to his hand and let him
[1:08:08] live his life through me i'm here to
[1:08:10] shine as a light i'm here to walk the
[1:08:12] path he has for me and i'm to do it with
[1:08:15] joy in the midst of the troubles that he
[1:08:17] and his wisdom allowed to come my way
[1:08:19] because this is not my permanent
[1:08:20] destination i'm just passing through i'm
[1:08:23] just running a race but i've got a prize
[1:08:25] at the end of this race
[1:08:27] whether it be through the change in my
[1:08:29] atoms instantly or i get to die and go
[1:08:32] on to the sixth dimension either way
[1:08:34] i've got a reward coming amen and i'm
[1:08:36] not living for now i'm living for that
[1:08:38] reward
[1:08:40] and if we stay focused on that amen the
[1:08:42] disappointments of life become minimal
[1:08:46] because this is just another thing it'll
[1:08:48] pass it'll be okay i just want to gain
[1:08:51] the character that i'm supposed to gain
[1:08:53] and move forward and shine the light
[1:08:54] that i'm supposed to shine in this
[1:08:56] problem
[1:08:57] and the problem that comes tomorrow i
[1:08:59] want to do the same thing i'm not
[1:09:01] expecting listen i'll tell you i for
[1:09:03] years i thought once we get past this
[1:09:06] it'll be smooth sailing
[1:09:09] anybody else think that
[1:09:11] when you're raising children or even in
[1:09:13] the church i think once we get over this
[1:09:15] obstacle it'll be smooth sailing once we
[1:09:18] get over this and now my whole
[1:09:19] thinking's changed i'm thinking i might
[1:09:21] as well just stay in this trial because
[1:09:23] i understand this one
[1:09:26] i'm not so eager to move to the next one
[1:09:28] because i don't that one that's a
[1:09:30] mystery to me and that's a little
[1:09:31] intimidating but at least i know what
[1:09:33] i'm dealing with here
[1:09:35] because you realize that this life is
[1:09:38] structured for that there must be a
[1:09:40] press to get the fragrance out of the
[1:09:42] rose amen to get the perfume to get the
[1:09:44] life to come out there must be a squeeze
[1:09:46] amen and we constantly have to get
[1:09:48] squeezed to let the life of christ come
[1:09:50] out
[1:09:53] so let's not be disappointed with life
[1:09:55] let's not live for this life
[1:09:57] let's look for the next one
[1:10:00] you know and i and and and i don't want
[1:10:03] you to misunderstand me and when i'm
[1:10:04] preaching because i still enjoy my life
[1:10:08] there are many pleasurable things and
[1:10:10] blessings that god allows in my life and
[1:10:12] i enjoy him to the max
[1:10:15] like there's times with my family
[1:10:16] there's times
[1:10:18] that i enjoy absolutely enjoy it
[1:10:21] thoroughly enjoy it and i've learned
[1:10:23] every pleasure that god allows to come
[1:10:25] my way i want to throw myself completely
[1:10:27] into it and suck out all the pleasure i
[1:10:29] can because i know there's another child
[1:10:31] coming and more hardship coming
[1:10:35] we become discouraged when we want it
[1:10:37] all to be blessings and all to be
[1:10:38] pleasure
[1:10:40] but we realize
[1:10:42] this is school so everything that comes
[1:10:45] i say thank you lord jesus and i enjoy
[1:10:47] it and i thank god for it and i enjoy my
[1:10:49] life
[1:10:50] i enjoy the pleasurable times it gives
[1:10:52] me i enjoy the times of fellowship i
[1:10:54] enjoy those things and i want to
[1:10:55] continue to enjoy them but i also must
[1:10:58] realize
[1:10:59] that that's just god's blessing because
[1:11:02] he's a good father and he loves to bless
[1:11:03] his children
[1:11:05] but his purpose is for us to make it
[1:11:07] through school
[1:11:09] to graduate
[1:11:11] to attain to something
[1:11:13] to gain the character that is necessary
[1:11:16] for what he knows is coming next
[1:11:18] and i want to be faithful
[1:11:28] paul says in philippians chapter 1 verse
[1:11:31] 21
[1:11:32] for to me to live is christ
[1:11:34] and to die is gain
[1:11:35] [Music]
[1:11:37] but if i live in the flesh but the if i
[1:11:40] live in the flesh this is the fruit of
[1:11:42] my labor yeah what i shall choose i want
[1:11:44] not for i am in a straight betwixt two
[1:11:46] having a desire to depart and to be with
[1:11:48] christ which is far better nevertheless
[1:11:50] to abide in the flesh is more needful
[1:11:52] for you
[1:11:54] paul was not dreading his death
[1:11:58] the apostle paul was not dreading his
[1:12:00] death for him it was a release
[1:12:03] for him it was a stepping into another
[1:12:06] place and to freedom
[1:12:09] and
[1:12:10] i read this quote here of brother bantam
[1:12:12] going
[1:12:14] to the bedside of his first wife and she
[1:12:16] was dying a young woman in her early 20s
[1:12:19] with two babies
[1:12:21] and and she says
[1:12:24] she said bill you've preached about it
[1:12:27] you've talked about it but you don't
[1:12:29] have no idea what it is
[1:12:32] i said what are you talking about she
[1:12:33] said heaven she said look she said i was
[1:12:36] being escorted home by some people's men
[1:12:38] or women or something they was dressed
[1:12:40] in white and she said i was at ease and
[1:12:43] peace said big pretty birds flying from
[1:12:46] tree to tree she said don't think i'm
[1:12:48] beside myself
[1:12:50] she was coming out
[1:12:52] he called her back
[1:12:54] he called her name and he called her
[1:12:55] back and she said why did you call me
[1:12:58] back
[1:12:59] she didn't she was going to a place she
[1:13:01] didn't want to come back to
[1:13:04] brother branham when he went beyond the
[1:13:05] curtain of time he went into the sixth
[1:13:07] dimension and was greeting the saints
[1:13:09] and then he you know he
[1:13:11] he begins to reiterate the story and
[1:13:13] tell us all about it but then he said i
[1:13:15] had a funny feeling i looked back and my
[1:13:16] body was moving on the bed and he said
[1:13:18] do i have to go back amen he in the bed
[1:13:22] next to him was his wife and the other
[1:13:23] room was his children amen but he had
[1:13:26] moved into such a reality such a goal
[1:13:28] such a place that he
[1:13:31] he himself did not want to go back to
[1:13:33] that old life and tell your friends
[1:13:35] there's a reward at the end there's
[1:13:37] anoth there's something better than this
[1:13:39] amen
[1:13:40] don't be discouraged don't be
[1:13:42] brokenhearted don't be downcast amen be
[1:13:45] happy in the face of trial this is
[1:13:47] another lesson this is another
[1:13:48] opportunity to shine this is part of
[1:13:50] god's plan for me for to overcome to
[1:13:53] show that the word will overcome but i
[1:13:55] got something better coming this isn't
[1:13:58] my my place of pleasure that's coming
[1:14:02] praise god
[1:14:04] and the message things that are to be
[1:14:07] brother i said this old earthly
[1:14:08] tabernacle here you know what it is
[1:14:10] this body
[1:14:12] it's like an old colt a coat that you
[1:14:14] wear a coat that you once wear but now
[1:14:16] you have one so much better you don't
[1:14:18] use it anymore what do you do you hang
[1:14:20] in the closet for you've got one better
[1:14:22] you've got a better coat it's more up to
[1:14:24] date than the one you used to wear
[1:14:25] that's worn out what it is that garment
[1:14:28] you are the inside of that there that
[1:14:30] garment only done what it bore your
[1:14:32] image see but you don't need it anymore
[1:14:35] now you've hung it up it's a rag
[1:14:38] and that's the way this old body is it's
[1:14:40] bore the image of the heavenly
[1:14:42] yet it is not you
[1:14:44] you are on the inside of that body you
[1:14:47] the spirit of god is on the inside of
[1:14:49] that body that's what makes the outside
[1:14:51] come in subjections because the inside
[1:14:53] is pulling at sea bringing in line with
[1:14:55] the word of god your inside you yourself
[1:14:58] your being
[1:15:00] brother member said in another place he
[1:15:01] says we've really never seen one another
[1:15:04] before
[1:15:05] you've only seen the earthly that bore
[1:15:08] the image because the real me is a
[1:15:10] spiritual me and the real you is a
[1:15:12] spiritual you amen the life of the soul
[1:15:15] and we've never really seen one another
[1:15:17] before we've only seen the earth that we
[1:15:20] dwell in and interacted with amen but we
[1:15:23] we've never really seen one another
[1:15:25] because you live in that body you're not
[1:15:27] that body and i live in this body i'm
[1:15:30] not this body and when i hear that i'm
[1:15:32] so glad because this body is doing
[1:15:34] things to me lately that i don't like
[1:15:38] i mean i crossed 40 and i was feeling
[1:15:41] pretty good and then all of a sudden
[1:15:42] things hurt that never hurt and things
[1:15:44] are more difficult that never used to be
[1:15:46] difficult and picking something off the
[1:15:48] floor becomes
[1:15:50] embarrassing i thought what's happening
[1:15:52] to me i'm so glad this isn't me amen
[1:15:55] there's a life inside of me that wants
[1:15:57] to live there's a life inside of me
[1:15:59] that's real life amen that must continue
[1:16:01] on this life and this body is
[1:16:04] deteriorating amen it's falling apart
[1:16:06] it's growing in weakness but there's
[1:16:08] another life in me that will never grow
[1:16:10] weak that will never deteriorate that
[1:16:11] will never pass away and when it leaves
[1:16:14] this body it's going to a heavenly body
[1:16:16] amen that will never change that will
[1:16:18] never grow old
[1:16:21] so we don't want to be discouraged
[1:16:24] we want to be encouraged
[1:16:26] there's a purpose in it all
[1:16:28] it's normal
[1:16:30] but i'm going through so much it's
[1:16:32] normal
[1:16:33] and it's okay
[1:16:34] but it's so hard it's all right
[1:16:38] it will be
[1:16:39] okay
[1:16:41] a year from now
[1:16:42] two years from now five years from now
[1:16:45] you're going to have a
[1:16:46] testimony from today
[1:16:49] that says the word works
[1:16:52] i've got evidence
[1:16:54] he's still my healer he's still my
[1:16:55] deliverer he's still the one who
[1:16:57] provides
[1:17:00] he goes on in this quote said this body
[1:17:02] is just an old coat
[1:17:04] and someday what will you do with it
[1:17:07] it was only in in the garment for a
[1:17:09] while that is like the earthly garment
[1:17:11] this body your real body your real self
[1:17:13] is on the inside of this old coat that
[1:17:15] you call william branham or susie jones
[1:17:17] or whoever it is
[1:17:19] someday it will hang on the earth's hall
[1:17:21] of memory of you you'll put it out
[1:17:22] yonder in the grave and somebody will
[1:17:24] put a tombstone up here lies reverend
[1:17:26] so-and-so or john so-and-so or so-and-so
[1:17:29] it'll lie there as a memorial of you
[1:17:31] the people just seen you in this and
[1:17:33] what you was your real you was on the
[1:17:36] inside of that but the old code itself
[1:17:38] just borne the image of the heavenly old
[1:17:40] people have you met made reservations to
[1:17:43] change codes
[1:17:45] have you made reservations for heaven
[1:17:47] remember you must have reservations you
[1:17:49] can't get in without them
[1:17:51] let's turn and look at second
[1:17:52] corinthians
[1:17:54] chapter five and read this scripture
[1:17:56] together
[1:18:02] ii corinthians chapter 5
[1:18:04] verse 1
[1:18:06] for we know that if our earthly house of
[1:18:08] this tabernacle were dissolved
[1:18:10] we have a building of god a house not
[1:18:12] made with hands eternal
[1:18:14] in the heavens
[1:18:16] for in this we groan earnestly desiring
[1:18:18] to be clothed upon with our house which
[1:18:19] is from heaven if so be that being
[1:18:21] clothed we shall not be found naked
[1:18:24] for we that are in this tabernacle do
[1:18:25] groan being burdened not for that we
[1:18:27] would be unclothed but clothed upon that
[1:18:30] mortality might be swallowed up of life
[1:18:32] now he that hath wrought us for the
[1:18:34] self-same thing is god who also hath
[1:18:37] given unto us the earnest of his spirit
[1:18:41] the baptism of the holy ghost is the
[1:18:43] earnest of the spirit it's the down
[1:18:45] payment showing there's something better
[1:18:47] coming
[1:18:48] [Music]
[1:18:49] if you've got the spirit of god dwelling
[1:18:51] in you it's the earnest the down payment
[1:18:53] showing that it's not always going to be
[1:18:55] like this there's something better
[1:18:57] coming
[1:19:00] praise god
[1:19:02] in the invisible union the prophet says
[1:19:04] some of you people that really believe
[1:19:06] this to be the truth that we're entering
[1:19:08] another age we're entering the rapture
[1:19:11] age
[1:19:12] you know the church can't go into this
[1:19:13] condition it can't get any better it
[1:19:15] must get worse how many knows that say
[1:19:17] amen it's got to get worse it can't go
[1:19:20] like this it's got to be something and
[1:19:22] it's moving right now friend it's on the
[1:19:24] move is on for the bride that's the
[1:19:27] truth that's thus saith the lord we've
[1:19:29] entered into the rapture age and the
[1:19:31] move is on for the bride
[1:19:33] i have no desire to stay amen i only

[1:23:53] that my god is a provider
[1:23:56] you know if we could take the right
[1:23:58] mental attitude and we could set our
[1:24:00] focus on the right goal amen and stay
[1:24:03] focused on what the goal is and keep
[1:24:05] moving god will work it all out
[1:24:08] what in your life hasn't he worked out
[1:24:11] what obstacle haven't you overcome what
[1:24:13] thing has he not worked out in life he's
[1:24:15] worked them all out or he is working
[1:24:17] them out but they will all work out for
[1:24:19] his glory
[1:24:23] brother man said in the message go tell
[1:24:25] my disciples from 1953
[1:24:28] this quote here i really loved
[1:24:31] it one of these glorious spring mornings
[1:24:34] when all of it's over and the atomic
[1:24:36] bombs done bursted and the world sent
[1:24:38] her over yonder and she's whirled around
[1:24:40] through the years and been purified
[1:24:42] brought back and the palm trees will
[1:24:44] rise up in the earth again a
[1:24:46] resurrection of all nature
[1:24:49] like god did in the beginning
[1:24:51] going back to eden
[1:24:52] [Music]
[1:24:54] there'll be no pollution in the soil
[1:24:56] there'll be no pollution in the air
[1:24:58] and the palm trees there'll be no germs
[1:25:00] or diseases to ever break them down
[1:25:02] again the apple trees will never get old
[1:25:05] hallelujah shall rise raise up in some
[1:25:08] glorious beautiful morning when the big
[1:25:10] birds are flying from tree to tree jesus
[1:25:12] shall appear here on the earth again
[1:25:18] there is nothing in this life
[1:25:21] that can compare to that
[1:25:25] there is nothing he brother brennan is
[1:25:27] not talking spiritually now he's talking
[1:25:29] naturally physically upon this earth
[1:25:32] that when god created an eden he made
[1:25:34] fruit that he wanted his children to eat
[1:25:36] amen he wanted to have fellowship with
[1:25:38] them amen in the physical form and he
[1:25:40] wanted them to enjoy his creation wanted
[1:25:42] to enjoy his earth enjoy the sunshine
[1:25:45] enjoy the cool water he wanted him to
[1:25:47] enjoy it and he's bringing it back to
[1:25:49] that he'll purify the soil purify the
[1:25:52] air he'll bring everything back there'll
[1:25:54] be a resurrection of all nature and i'll
[1:25:56] be there in a glorified body having my
[1:25:58] atoms changed amen and a perfect triune
[1:26:01] being with a perfect flesh body with my
[1:26:03] theophany amen spirit and with my soul
[1:26:06] that's been regenerated and born again a
[1:26:08] perfect triune person back in the
[1:26:11] original condition amen there to taste
[1:26:14] the fruit that god made to be good
[1:26:16] [Music]
[1:26:18] that's the goal friends that's where
[1:26:20] this all is leading to it's all coming
[1:26:22] back to eden
[1:26:25] and what problem do we have
[1:26:29] that's worth getting distracted over
[1:26:32] when we put it all back into perspective
[1:26:34] and brother banham starts to describe
[1:26:36] what it'll be like amen and he says the
[1:26:38] great birds flying from tree to tree i
[1:26:41] mean can you imagine the the warm air
[1:26:44] and the smell of the fruit on the trees
[1:26:46] and the blossoms of the flowers and
[1:26:48] perfection everywhere and the greatest
[1:26:50] perfection is the perfection inside of
[1:26:52] you no more war with yourself
[1:26:55] no more wrong thoughts no more wrong
[1:26:57] desires no more inhibitions no more
[1:26:59] insecurities no more of anything going
[1:27:02] on inside amen you come back to that
[1:27:04] perfect son of god that he always
[1:27:06] intended for you to be
[1:27:09] and in a perfect environment
[1:27:13] and if you ever get discouraged here
[1:27:15] take this picture and put it out in
[1:27:17] front of you and just keep walking
[1:27:19] because we're going to make it there
[1:27:20] it's a promise it's just a shirt as
[1:27:22] anything else is a shirt it's going to
[1:27:24] happen we're going to sit under the tree
[1:27:27] we're going to hear the brook we're
[1:27:28] going to taste the fruit and we're going
[1:27:30] to worship at the feet of jesus in a
[1:27:32] physical body when he sets up the
[1:27:34] kingdom of david i'm going to see my
[1:27:36] lord amen in the body that he had when
[1:27:39] he was here on earth
[1:27:42] what a reward friends
[1:27:45] what a reward
[1:27:47] i gotta pass through a few days
[1:27:49] a man that's born of a woman is a few
[1:27:51] days and full of trouble
[1:27:53] what's a few days compared to eternity
[1:27:55] in this condition
[1:27:58] what's a few days what's 70 80 90 years
[1:28:02] compared to eternity in that world
[1:28:07] i think sometimes it does us good
[1:28:09] just to go back to the simple promise
[1:28:12] of the restoration of eden and put it
[1:28:14] before our face
[1:28:16] sometimes go back to the most simple and
[1:28:18] basic things of the gospel and put them
[1:28:20] right back in front of our eyes
[1:28:22] to realize
[1:28:24] everything's okay
[1:28:26] there's a promise
[1:28:28] there's a goal
[1:28:30] there's a crown to be won there's a
[1:28:32] prize at the end of this life
[1:28:34] and it's going to be worth it all
[1:28:39] hebrews 13 14 says for here
[1:28:43] we have no continuing city
[1:28:46] but we seek one to come
[1:28:50] we will never be satisfied with anything
[1:28:53] that this life offers
[1:28:56] you buy a new car
[1:28:58] it'll break down
[1:29:00] you build a new house you don't need
[1:29:02] repair
[1:29:04] everything
[1:29:05] i mean everything
[1:29:07] ends up disappointing
[1:29:10] everything that we get so excited about
[1:29:13] becomes a disappointment because
[1:29:15] everything in this life is corrupted and
[1:29:17] deteriorates
[1:29:20] i thought it was going to be so
[1:29:21] wonderful to have my own job in my own
[1:29:22] house and my own my independence and do
[1:29:24] whatever i wanted
[1:29:26] that was a disappointment
[1:29:28] every goal every station in life every
[1:29:32] thing i achieved every physical thing i
[1:29:34] bought ends up being a disappointment at
[1:29:36] some point
[1:29:38] the the
[1:29:39] the garbage yards the the junkyards are
[1:29:42] full
[1:29:43] of people's dreams
[1:29:45] that are now worthless
[1:29:48] but i want to keep this one dream before
[1:29:50] my eyes all the time because it's not a
[1:29:52] dream it's a reality
[1:29:56] for the glory that sits ahead
[1:29:58] let us endure our cross
[1:30:00] even despising the shame not not
[1:30:02] pleasant not liking it but let us go
[1:30:05] through it to get to the goal
[1:30:07] and let me do so with joy in the midst
[1:30:10] of the trial that he sees fit to allow
[1:30:12] to come my way
[1:30:14] for he's molding in me a character that
[1:30:16] i'll need there
[1:30:18] and he's he's bringing something out of
[1:30:20] me that will testify that his word is
[1:30:22] true
[1:30:24] i said god
[1:30:25] i'm your vessel
[1:30:27] have your way with me
[1:30:29] help me keep my eyes
[1:30:30] on that prize
[1:30:32] let's all stand musicians if you'll come
[1:30:40] it's good sometimes to refocus our
[1:30:42] glasses
[1:30:45] you have a bad day turns into a bad week
[1:30:48] can become a bad month
[1:30:50] it's time to refocus our glasses
[1:30:53] it's all okay friends
[1:30:55] god
[1:30:56] wouldn't have allowed it if it didn't
[1:30:58] serve his purpose
[1:31:00] he wouldn't have permitted it he
[1:31:01] wouldn't have signed off on it to come
[1:31:03] into your life if it wasn't for our good
[1:31:06] for his good
[1:31:07] it wasn't going to accomplish something
[1:31:09] for his kingdom
[1:31:10] so now let's just put our eyes a little
[1:31:13] bit higher
[1:31:14] not down on the board we're trying to
[1:31:16] cross not at the crowds on the side not
[1:31:18] at the critics and not at the fans
[1:31:21] let's put our eyes at the end of this
[1:31:24] path and say that's what i got to get to
[1:31:27] i got to get to him
[1:31:29] and i want to be pleasing to him
[1:31:31] let's bow our heads and pray
[1:31:34] lord jesus we thank you for this day
[1:31:38] lord for the word that you've placed
[1:31:40] before us
[1:31:41] for the promise that we have
[1:31:44] god as we're reminded lord of what this
[1:31:47] life is and what's coming
[1:31:49] god help us to take courage
[1:31:52] for god by the opening of the word
[1:31:55] we can feel the sunlight from that new
[1:31:57] world
[1:31:59] warming our souls lord we're laying in
[1:32:02] the sun lord that's bringing a full
[1:32:04] maturity to the scene

[1:32:25] help me lord to see the goal and stay
[1:32:28] focused thereon
[1:32:29] help me to look ahead lord

[1:32:33] here who's been discouraged
[1:32:35] beat up by life and overwhelmed by the
[1:32:38] obstacles and the difficulties
[1:32:40] i pray that right now you would give
[1:32:42] them a fresh vision of what lays ahead
[1:32:45] give them lord an inspiration from that
[1:32:48] vision to take another step forward
[1:32:50] knowing that it will all work out that
[1:32:52] this too shall pass
[1:32:54] that god that you're going to that word
[1:32:57] will never fail that's inside of them
[1:32:59] but it'll accomplish what you sent it
[1:33:00] forth to accomplish
[1:33:02] helpless god to be the manifestation of
[1:33:05] your word in this day
[1:33:07] that it would flow out from us lord in
[1:33:09] every squeeze and in every trial that it
[1:33:11] would just bring more of that fragrance
[1:33:13] lord that's pleasing to you
[1:33:16] god may we be found faithful
[1:33:19] by our own choosing to stay
[1:33:21] committed to you and joyful
[1:33:24] in the path that you have for us the
[1:33:25] wall
[1:33:26] we love you lord
[1:33:28] we ask that you encourage us
[1:33:30] help us to walk with you and keep our
