TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I say God help me whenever it comes head to head with the word help me die quickly when I find out I've been wrong maybe I've been doing something wrong I've been doing it wrong for years I was ignorant I didn't know but all of a sudden God brings the word on the scene let me quickly say I died of myself so the word can take its place and now I can become more of the word made flesh that's the age that we're living in how are we going to do it how's the bride go up word by word how do you surrender word by word decision by decision day by day amen it wasn't one time at the altar it's all over now no it's every day I'm surrendering a little more every day I'm putting myself lower my desires my will my ones and I'm taking the word and letting the word be my my life letting the word be my decision what's your decision whatever the word says that's my decision what will you do whatever the word says that's what I do and that's how the word is made flesh sometimes we make things too mystical where the the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming the word you can say it's so mystical but there's no practical application you go back out and keep doing the same things we always did manifesting the same life it becomes so mystical now where there were the brides the word made flesh she will be the anointed one for this day if you keep it in the mystical Realms you'll keep living the same way we've always lived but when we bring it down to the practicality and say you know what every time I come into a headbutt a Crossroads with this word I am going to take the word and die to myself and put the word and that is how the word is being made flesh in our day that's why she's the anointed when she's anointed by God to lay down her life and let his life take preeminence that's how we are the anointed one and that's how the bride is the word for this day don't just leave it off mystically it'll magically happen it's magically happening when God convicts your heart when God brings you face to face with the word and something inside of you is willing to die that's that is the mystical part taking place right there that's the mystery becoming unveiled that's the mystical that's the Supernatural That's God dealing in your heart amen don't wait for magic potion and fairy dust and all of a sudden I step into a perfect condition no we're growing into it day by day we're surrendering more and more this is the reality praise God it's a lot harder than we thought 20 years ago we thought God would flip the switch and it's all done and I'm the manifested word no we're becoming word we're going up word by word as the word gets clearer I come in greater subjection as the word comes fresh I'm surrendering more as I see how wrong I was I see my wrong motives I see my wrong desire and all sudden I Repent I don't repent from doing wrong I Repent from thinking wrong I'm not repenting from I'm not repenting from doing wrong to my brother I'm thinking I'm repenting of thinking wrong about my brother you see how the words bringing more a more reality bringing more manifestation no more white sepulchers but let it be true on the inside and manifest on the outside so that the visible becomes the manifestation of the invisible
