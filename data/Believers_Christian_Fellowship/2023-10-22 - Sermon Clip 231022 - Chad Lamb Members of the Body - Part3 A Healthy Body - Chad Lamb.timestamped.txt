[0:00] anytime something will get you to leave
[0:02] the ABCs amen you know it's wrong amen
[0:05] something that will get you to leave
[0:06] Fellowship it's
[0:08] wrong because we're not to forsake the
[0:10] assembling together of ourselves amen
[0:12] even the more so as that day approaches
[0:14] that's a commandment and brother Benham
[0:16] said amen that commandment drives us
[0:18] into church we should have a heart to
[0:20] get to church every time the doors open
[0:22] and if our heart's not there he said we
[0:23] need to get to
[0:25] praying but when all of the sudden our
[0:27] heart turns from there and we don't want
[0:29] to be in the fellowship that doesn't
[0:31] mean that God won't move You from One
[0:32] Church to the other God has the Liberty
[0:34] to move his sheep wherever that's not
[0:35] what we're talking about but when we
[0:37] start laying out of church and not
[0:38] connecting and becoming disconnected I
[0:41] if I would search that out I would say
[0:43] there's a complex there somewhere and
[0:45] somebody's believed a
[0:47] lie somebody has received and accepted a
[0:50] lie and they're disbelieving something I
[0:52] had a sister come to me one time and she
[0:54] was so troubled about something that was
[0:56] happening in the church many years ago
[0:58] and she says this happened and this
[1:00] brother came from this church to this
[1:01] church and that influenced this and and
[1:03] you decided to do that and you did that
[1:06] because of what that brother did in
[1:07] other church and the whole thing was a
[1:10] complete
[1:11] fabrication complete 100% there wasn't a
[1:15] threat of Truth in it at
[1:18] all but she saw things and connected
[1:21] them and what happened was she had a
[1:24] complex from a previous Church she was
[1:26] at she had an overbearing Pastor who
[1:29] took control and the whole church fell
[1:32] apart now she's
[1:35] afraid and so she's on the
[1:37] lookout anytime she saw something that
[1:39] she didn't understand then all of a
[1:41] sudden all of a sudden she worked up a
[1:43] whole scenario that was not
[1:52] true what's he looking for an Open Door
[1:56] a bruised cell a weakness amen the
[2:01] minute that that we can get pulled off
[2:04] the word the minute that we can think
[2:06] it's all right to
[2:09] gossip there's a complex driving that
[2:12] somewhere the minute I can speak evil or
[2:15] critical of another brother without
[2:16] going to that brother and talking to
[2:17] them just talk to other brothers there's
[2:19] something driving me to that cuz that's
[2:21] not the
[2:22] word the minute I can lay out a church
[2:24] and not go and be comfortable just
[2:26] bailing out and not going anywhere
[2:27] there's something wrong something's
[2:29] driving that you say what is driving
[2:32] that because the word says don't forsake
[2:34] this sibling together that's the word
[2:36] now there's something in me that doesn't
[2:38] want me to come to the word what's
[2:39] driving that is it an old pain from
[2:41] childhood is it because of something
[2:43] somebody said is it a rejection pain is
[2:44] it a hurt what it what is causing me to
[2:48] want to pull back from the body what is
[2:50] causing me Amen to want to speak evil to
[2:52] somebody what is going on Amen that I am
[2:55] going down this path I think we need to
[2:57] stop and say what is pushing me me
[3:00] because this isn't the
[3:01] word that's not the
[3:07] word amen we may not be able to figure
[3:10] out what our complex is we may not be
[3:11] able to figure out what happened to us
[3:12] as a childhood but we can certainly
[3:14] figure out the moment we step off the
[3:15] very ABC's basics of the word go to
[3:18] church pay your tith love the Brethren
[3:20] speak nice things about one another no
[3:23] gossip no backbiting I mean those are
[3:25] the simplest when we move off of that we
[3:26] need to say wait a minute something's
[3:28] going on here amen amen something's
[3:32] pushing me out from around the word and
[3:35] you know what it's never just about
[3:38] me the devil's trying to destroy the
[3:41] body bring in through a Bruce cell
[3:45] another life and through that other life
[3:51] spread say God please help us
