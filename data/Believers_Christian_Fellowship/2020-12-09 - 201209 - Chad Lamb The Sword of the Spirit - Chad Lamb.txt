seated [Music] revelation chapter 4 and we'll start at verse 1 revelation chapter four i want to continue on just a little bit with the thought that we were on on sunday amen but i just want to look at a specific angle so we might review just a little bit and continue on by the grace of god revelation chapter 4 verse 1 after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven so after this after what after the church ages after laodicea after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne amen it's amazing that after john passes through the church ages then after this he looked and there was a door open to heaven so after when he gets to the end of laodicea now there's an open door in heaven amen and now he can be lifted off the things on earth and to the things in heaven and and the first voice he heard was as a trumpet saying come up hither immediately he was in the spirit and he saw one on the throne he got a revelation of christ the mystery of god revealed the seventh seal amen you can be seated i'd like to just continue on brother branham says you know here in the vision of john he said one man can represent the whole church and he represents the whole church being caught up out of laodicea and into heavenly places amen and so we want to continue looking uh but today i'd like to focus just on the sword of the spirit so i just titled this just for a text the sword of the spirit and i want to read this quote out of um christ is the mystery of god revealed i read it on sunday but i'd like to read it again i mean sometimes when god is is is really opening something and we get moving so fast amen and it just it just you just can't hardly help it amen you get so inspired i mean sometimes i want to just go over it again i want to back up a little bit and just slow down so tonight if the lord will help me i'd like to slow down amen there's no promises but i'd like to slow down a little bit and read christ is the mystery god revealed paragraph 593 oh if i could get the world to see that why there you are there is the body of christ living standing redeemed redeemed oh my justified in his sight why are we justified we are his victory the church is his victory oh i i i feel the same way as the prophet said he said oh if i wish i could get them to see it and i i say it this way i wish i could see it like i i ought to see it because it the the church is his victory the church is his victory amen the church redeemed the church standing on her feet the church walking in the fullness of the truth the church without deception the truth the church of me that is his victory that's the whole point that's this whole purpose that is his victory us here today receiving the word and walking in the full light of the day with the full holy ghost amen measured out in this day this is his victory friends and so it's it's it's i think it's more than we have ever imagined it's more important it's more precious it is the goal it is the purpose amen it is everything and and because it's our lives and because there's such a natural part of us i think sometimes we forget how significant this day is and how significant our lives are in this day i would say in in brother branham's life and we look back and we see what was happening through his ministry and how how perfect his life was ordained and and how his footsteps were ordered of the lord and so many of the the things that he went through and many of the things that he did in the circumstances around his life it was declaring the word it was declaring the age so everything surrounding that prophet's life was so ordained and so significant amen and i would say in the eternals in the invisible realm all around him amen there was such dramatic things taking place but i don't think our lives are any different i think if we could see into that unseen world amen if god if we could break through the barrier of flesh and actually see what's going on in the heavenlies and amen and what's what's taking place in the reality because this is not the reality this is the reflection this is the shadow this is the myth but if we could see in the reality i believe there's just as significant things taking place in the lives of the bride as there was then and so we want to be conscious of this that the church is his victory he wanted to achieve a church he had to restore what was fallen in eden amen because because he set up the pattern in eden amen he cannot deviate from that pattern so in order for god to have the victory he has to have a bride restored and that bride has to be restored in an eden condition and if he doesn't bring the bride back to an eden condition he has not succeeded and that's why the church is his victory amen because jesus christ came as the last adam and he had victory as the last adam but that is not yet a restoration to an even condition because without her amen he is not complete without her the vision is not fulfilled the pattern has not come back in the cycle of redemption back to the original desire amen until you have a bride that is brought back in union with her bridegroom in an eden condition praise be to god so the church is his victory we come forth in this last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory now his victory brother uh his god's victory christ's victory was not that he could get a man on the earth amen that could display the sign of the messiah right because that sign was to attract the attention of the bride of the rainbow covenant trout the the elect seed the elect bride amen so brother brando's ministry was not his victory and we look at that as such a victory i mean for us it was so victorious i mean night after night demons legions of demons were cast out there was a man amen that god had such control and such preeminence and that christ could come down himself and work through that flesh it was god in the flesh of that prophet and he was bringing every spirit in the building under his control it was such a victory such a display of the power of christ such a display of the sign of the messiah amen but that wasn't his victory his victory is you and i connected to this word believing with deception of melting away and coming back in union with our bridegroom that's his victory that was to get this so we look at that with admiration and awe and then and put it on a pedestal and there's nothing wrong with those things but we can't let it stop there that wasn't his great achievement his great achievement was to have a bride restored back to himself again this day is his great achievement what's happening now is his great achievement this is his victory him having preeminence in you and i is his victory that's why every day every decision attitudes thought amen conduct it matters because this is the day this is the goal this is the victory so we can't just leave it all on brother ben he had a consecrated life he had pre-eminence in that vessel that was wonderful i mean he was only foreshadowing he was the first one amen the first part of the word that would come to full harvest maturity and it was plucked up and waved over the people amen showing that whatever brought that first part to full harvest maturity will bring the rest of the grain to full harvest maturity so we cannot stop there and say i've seen it that's it whatever whatever mature that into a ripeness has got to mature us into a ripeness and if the rest of the crop doesn't come to ripeness it's a failure not a victory so this is his victory you and i are part of his victory he come forth in the last days with his glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory amen when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory shows that he he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us what grave what grave the grave of dead denominationalism neither can they keep us that's right we are already potentially arise because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominational creeds to an eternal word of the eternal god which is him his self working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever and when the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it so that the same word moves from the head as the day comes close down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one they are husband and wife their flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life spirit of a spirit listen now now now that this is the words of a vindicated prophet amen and he's pointing right to the teachings of the apostle paul and he's telling us that in this end time amen under the opening of this word that the the head and the body have united and the life moving down from the head and to the body amen the husband and wife said that wife is their flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life spirit of his spirit that is not second class that is not second rate that is not part two amen it's a continuation of the same thing whatever he is she must be awesome he he was that in in perfect flesh that wasn't fallen and wasn't sin born but we are that in redeemed flesh that was born wrong but redeemed back by the blood of jesus christ but it's got to be the same thing it can't be something different amen how do you know bears the same record same fruit same word manifest christ same life same god same spirit same word same book amen same signs the things that i do show you also oh hallelujah my notice the vindicated word in his body is his very victory and the reason of his death what did he die so that he could vindicate his word and you and i see the death now he goes on see the death not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh his spirit went to hell and preached to the souls in prison that right his flesh only died when he raised it up again and quickened it quickened means made alive his flesh which is his body so i want to stop and inject here that in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god amen john 1 1. then you go over to john 1 14 but the word was made flesh and dwelt among us so god brother branham is getting ready to switch gears on us here but you got to catch the way he's going he's saying when he died he never died in the spirit he only died in the flesh amen what was his flesh his flesh was the word made flesh so that word was laying in a dead condition and after three days he raised it back to life but the spirit never died now look what he says next and that's and look his flesh which is his body and that's the word it's been laying dead for years it's been laying dead for years what's he talking about he's not talking about that body of the nazarene amen that was born in a stable in bethlehem he's talking about the body of his word which is the church and now he's saying that that now it's been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in the reformation and now she is standing upon her feet [Music] praise be to god where is his body you are his body the church is his body and it's been laying dead for years he said but why he already foreshadowed it amen when that body which was the word made flesh it died amen the spirit didn't die but the body died amen the word was laying there but now after three days he resurrects it back to life and now uh uh and the in the message brother branham preaches of of the restoration of the bride tree he says it goes to joel to the caterpillar the palmer worm the cankerworm and the locust and he says four stages ate it down to nothing it died in the dark ages the words been laying their dead for years but gradually through four stages it become back to life again what is it it's the resurrection of the word bride amen this is so important to understand amen because because without this resurrection there is no hope for physical material of the earth to ever come in a resurrection this resurrection comes first so that's the word it's been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in the reformation and now she is standing upon her feet she is standing upon her feet what's that the same word that he was that laid in the grave for three days that now amen after this one is laid in the grave from the dark ages amen in the third day he's going to resurrect it back to life oh how i wish i had time to go back into ezekiel and pull out them dry bones and show you said can these bones live again he said prophesy how can prophecy come only through the prophet it's the word of the lord hear ye dry bones the word of the lord and send you skin came upon them and they stood up a mighty army and began to march toward zion glory to god that's him that's him the victory what's him what's him it's that army that was laying there as dead dry bones amen that after prophecy come it restores back to life and becomes a mighty marching army marching the zion he said that's him that's him the victory watch him it's her standing upon her feet it's her coming in the resurrection let's go to ezekiel but the brother said he didn't have time but we've got time ezekiel chapter 37 this is such a principle we've talked about before but we have got to understand that that this bride is now standing on her feet this is the resurrection this is the resurrection of the church now we have to understand that in prophecy when when when in the old testament when we have prophecy prophecy of a disbursement of israel israel had fallen away they were going to be dispersed and go into the nations or be carried into babylon or whatever the curse was he says but i will gather you again and i will bring you back to this place and you will be my people and you will be a nation and all of that but the people he's speaking to are not the people who come back you understand that sometimes these were thousands of years hundreds of years so the people that go are not the ones that come back but to god it's one nation it's one people one israel that one can pass away but this is a continuation of israel and when he gathers them back it's the same he said i cast you away i gathered you back but it wasn't the same individuals that was sent away that came back so when god looks at the church he looks at one church one bride through all ages and she gets dispersed amongst the denominations but he's promised to gather her back and i will bring you back and i will restore you back and i will resurrect you back and what is it it's the resurrection of the whole church but it is manifest in the bride at the end time the whole body of believing bride from the time of christ till now is represented here in the bride all heaven is here backing up this bride because brother man said if you're an ambassador amen if you're an ambassador from heaven all heaven is backing you up and heaven is consistent of the word we're not alone we're not alone amen look at ezekiel 37 verse 1. that's why i think this is so important to understand prophecy when god gathered back to dispersed he brought israel back to him it was the same israel that went that he gathered back he wasn't counting individuals he's looking at his bride because christ has one bride amen it's a many-membered body and it's been built from the hands to the legs it's been built all up amen from the from the first age all the way through has been the building of the bride it's one bride what happens the one happens to all that's why the whole bride fell away in the first age i wasn't there but i fell away with that church we got we were trapped in denomination we were trapped in bondage we were trapped under mis understanding teaching misinterpretation of the word we were all trapped because if the bride was trapped there you and i were trapped there too because they without us are not yet made perfect so there's a link that goes between the elect so now she's standing on her feet who well you know just a little part no she's standing on her feet the bride has come back it's the restoration of the bride tree so we don't want to marginalize what's happening and lose the significance of happening what's happening all right chapter 37 verse 1 the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which is full of bones and caused me to pass by around about and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo were very dry and he said to me son of man can these bones live and i answered o lord god thou knowest again he said to me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them o ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live and i will lay sin you upon you and will bring upon bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that i am the lord so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones come together bone to his bone and when i beheld low the sinews and the flesh come upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind now catch this this is prophesy again prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the lord god come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came unto them and they lived and they stood up upon their feet an exceeding great army oh i want i i just hope that you can catch this i'm going to keep keep keep going here but listen they if they came back an exceeding great army then they've returned back or been redeemed back or the redemption cycle has brought them back to what they were in their original condition that means if they stood up a exceeding great army they went down an exceeding great army if it went down the bride of christ it comes back the bride of christ [Applause] if it was the bride three eight thousand the bride tree come back and now let's go to verse 11. i want to read 11 to 14. then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of israel now listen closely these bones are the whole house of israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for for for our parts therefore prophesying saying to them thus saith the lord god behold all my people i will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of israel and you shall know that i the lord i i am the lord when i have opened your graves o my people and brought you up out of your graves and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and shall place you in your own land then shall you know that i the lord has spoken it and performed it saith the lord now there's a natural spiritual fulfillment to this and the natural fulfillment we're seeing it brother branham pointed out to it amen there was a gathering of all the nations i will bring you out of your graves now listen ezekiel here is prophesying to a group of dispersed people and he's prophesying of a greater disbursement that will come and he says i will bring you out of your graves he will not bring the same ones he's talking to out of their graves the natural fulfillment which is going on today because israel is back a nation in their homeland again but he calls it israel to him it's the same even though it's different people i hope you can catch that and for us i'll bring you out of your graves what graves the graves of denominations amen they were scattered in the nations amen the bride was scattered in the denominations laying dead but he opened up the graves and he brought us back to our own land to our inheritance which is the word so this has already happened for the bride and it's happening for the jews now listen what brother brahm says in the restoration of the bride tree said four killers took it four messengers destroyed it four messengers of death took it away in dogmas four messengers of righteousness restore her back again prophesy son of man can these bones live wish we had time i gotta wrote down here but i have to miss that prophesy can these bones live what's the four stages of that coming forth of that church what's the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones coming forth but the life only come not when the sinew skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when that's when come back that fourth message of life pay attention to that one i will restore saith the lord hallelujah glory praise be to god the fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same signs watch justification brought back the pulp sanctification brought back the bark doctrine of holiness what brought back the leaf pentecostals what is it pentecostals leaves clap their hands joy rejoice pentecostals so he's showing us now in this prophecy of the restoration of the bride tree he said i will restore all that the palmer worm the cankerworm the caterpillar and locust have eaten he said i will restore that and he ties it together with ezekiel 37 the valley of dry bones and he connects these two prophecies together and both of these prophecies have a natural fulfillment to israel and a spiritual fulfillment to the bride and now he says now four stages he said what was the four stages that brought it back amen we know is the insects that ate it down but what brought it back amen it was bone to bone sin you in flesh amen standing upon an army but there was a fourth messenger of life a fourth message of life of four stages of the restoration that had to come back and he starts talking he says justification brought back the pulp and he's referring to luther's day amen and then and then then he says the second stage sanctification brought back to bark doctrine of holiness that's wesley's day and he says now what brought back the leaf pentecostals that's the third stage amen in the pentecostal age is the laodicean church age so now he's saying three messengers brought it back and he's typing it with ezekiel bringing back the bones the sinew the flesh standing there it's come back it's restored back but doesn't yet have the breath of right life so we come back through justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost but in ezekiel there's another prophesying prophesy son of man this is the second time he prophesied prophesy son of man and speak to the four winds that they come amen and breathe the breath of life amen and he says what the fourth was the word itself the word and god are the self-same person it's christ amen the anointed word he says now the fourth was the word itself amen the word made flesh fruits are the proof of the resurrection sign that christ has finally after justification been planted sanctification been planted baptism of holy ghost organizations died out and christ has again centered himself like the cap of the pyramid first line justification sanctification baptism holy ghost then coming of the cap which is what the word itself which is the holy ghost himself which is the full life of the word himself which is christ himself which is god himself which is the life that's come back into the church and when god is looking at this restoration of the church amen he's looking at luther wesley pentecost and now the fourth message of life the word itself amen and when he's looking at this he's just looking at the restoration of the bride he's not saying this group and this part over here with a different inheritance and not really bride but kind of bright no it's all bride building building building building so now i mean we we benefit from luther's day we benefit from wesley's day we benefit from the bats of the holy ghost and the pentecostal revival we benefit from that we are part of that we were there in that revival we were part of that because we're part of the bride that's bride that was the bride life coming through it was him prophesying that he's going to bring us out of our graves and bring us back into our land amen and he's been doing it opening the graves bringing back from the feet amen to the legs to the thighs to the arm bringing all the way back to the cap to the headstone which is the word itself coming back and i would say according to what brother branham said she's standing now upon her feet the bride is back in the resurrection the bride is back amen and all of the bride is represented in this today and you and i praise god let's go to revelation 19. revelation 19 we'll read verse 11. now the same process that god has for his bride the prophet of god come and he declared that the word himself has come the headstone has come the capstone has come to cap off the pyramid he is he is telling us that he is here that this this has happened the great invisible union but but individually as individuals we all have to move through this process justification sanctification baptism holy ghost and then the life itself so we we all have to move through this process so when brother branham is the prophet here he's declaring that we've come back to this prophecy this is the fourth stage of life that doesn't mean i wasn't even born yet but yet the bride was standing on her feet but yet they come back to the fourth stage of life yet it was to come to the bride age even though i wasn't there yet but i was instrumental in this bride in this day but it already come back the bride universe would come back to this position but me bright individual had to move to this position does that make sense and that's what god is waiting for for the last member of the bride to make that transition to that position and so we're out there looking for the last bride and that last bride has to move through justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost and then amen to to the word itself the four stage of life christ injected in that life itself amen and then the rapture will go the rapture has come but then the rapture will go so now now we understand where we're at so it's not like we're looking for something else it's already happened it's already been declared what we're waiting for is each individual member to get to that same place but it's already happened it's already been declared there's been a prophet on the day and the transition says we've made the transition we've moved through the transition we're here she's standing on her feet we're back to the bride we're in the bright eyes this is the restoration of the bride tree so we're not waiting for something else to happen amen we're waiting for every attribute to catch up to this spot now revelations 19 11 and i saw heaven open i think it's so significant we've we've got to the point where every word matters every jot every tittle and even when we read it and we don't understand it i know that that semicolon means something even if i don't yet clearly understand what it is we've got to the place where we know that this word is perfect and it's written a certain way for a certain reason and now we've come to heaven being opened something opened heaven amen and we saw it open in revelation chapter 4 and it was the opening of heaven and i saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he did judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed in a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and the wrath of almighty god and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords amen so we we see this is the lord coming in glory heavens have opened and we see him coming with the armies of heaven and his name is the word of god and we know that that he's coming as the fullness of the word amen and so and the armies of heaven are with him and he's got and he's got a vester dipped in blood he's got a name written and no man knows but his name is called the word of god amen and so and he's got a sword that proceeds out of his mouth and we know all of this is symbolic and we talked about this sunday we're not going to go into all of that but i want to look at the sword and i want to go to the fourth seal he says in the fourth seal and he's got wrote life riding on a white horse and here's a man with three different powers mixed up called death gathered as earthbound delegates i want to go back to revelation chapter 6. let's look at this together because i want to take time so we're going to make ourselves stop and read revelation chapter 6 verse 1 in the opening of the seals here in chapter 6 it says and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and i saw and behold as a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow when a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer so we're going to go through four the first four seals we're going to see that there's somebody riding on a horse and he starts on a white horse moves to a red horse moves to a black horse and brother bram said it's the same writer all the time he's just changing the horse that he's riding on and i also want to note just through those so we can keep our minds in tune that that when he gets off of the white horse they get onto a red horse the white horse doesn't stop writing brother brenner said that rides all the way into eternity so coming like christ looking like christ but being a deceiver to try to trick the people looking like it's righteous but unrighteous that deception continues on today then he moves to the red horse and he takes up a sword and he begins to fight amen to force people to believe his doctrine and to kill those who don't believe his teachings amen and that's that that power that horse rides on today and he got off of that and he got onto the black and then he got onto the pail but when he gets onto the pail in the fourth stage because the fourth stage is always the declaration because the fourth stage of life declares who's here the word himself the fourth stage i'd say of death and let's read it in verse 7. and when he had opened the four seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed him this is the first time the horse rider has been given a name amen and that's his name of the horse rider from the beginning all the way through his name is death amen and brother branham's saying now he's preaching in the fourth seal now he says now he he goes he's contrasting this horse rider with the horse rider in revelation 19 which is christ and he's comparing these two right now he said he's got wrote life how does he got wrote life when you go read revelation 19 it doesn't say he's god wrote life on him it says that his name is called the word of god and he said the word is life amen the word is god which is eternal life which is zoe it's his word because the word was god and the word was with god amen so now when he says he's got word he says now his name is life he's got life riding on a white horse and here's a man with three different powers mixed up called death gathering his earthbound delegates and christ is gathering as heaven-born subjects saints he's got death wrote on him christ got life wrote on him those with him are on white horses also and they are called the chosen before the foundation of the world and they are faithful to the word amen oh i like that called chosen before the foundation of the world then faithful to the word by their own choosing did you catch that they were called the ones that were following them on white horses were called and they were also chosen called and chosen has nothing to do with the individual that's falling on the white horse that's something god did before the foundation of the world but look at that third title that they have they are also called faithful and brother behind said faithful by their own free moral agency faithful by their own choice they are called they are chosen and they are faithful praise be to god i want to be faithful by my own choosing chosen before the foundation world and then faithful to the word by their choosing all stimulated with new wine and oil just riding right along coming down to meet him they know the thunders will issue the thing course pretty soon see watch how does he do so if he's the word in his name is the word then the word is life the antichrist anti is against so anti is against the christ the word so it's got to be a creed or a denomination which is against the word why i don't see how you're going to miss it do you understand how could you miss it i don't know how you're going to do it but that's true anti is against isn't that right take a take away from that's what he had was he's riding his mixed up horse we see it right here in the word of god we see it right here right there in the seven church ages here he brings it right back and the seals opening up and showing them things that that's went on in the church ages anti is against the word see why creeds why are we so against creeds and denominations because they are against the word here we see life and death coming to the final struggle what in the fourth stage under the fourth horse rider death amen what's he doing he's leading the church to spiritual death amen and where where is christ leading them christ is leading them to life he is life he is the word and the word is life and so now you see life and death coming to their he said their final struggle amen and i'd say the final struggle is going on now life and death coming to the final struggle the white horse of true life the pale horse of mixed creed you see the thing coming to a real showdown now now listen in the fourth stage when the message of life has come there come an opening of the seals that reveals the full mystery of god and the full mystery of god is life and anything that's against that is death i i want you to understand how real this is and how important this is because the fourth message is life the fourth message of life the fourth stage is the word itself and the word itself is come and the word itself is here and it's the full manifestation of the word which is the mystery of god revealed which is christ the mystery of god revealed which was the preaching of the seals that took the mystery off the whole bible to find christ in the whole bible and anything that's against that revelation of this end time revelation of christ is death and will bring death i hope that's clear so it's a face-off between life and death and anything that's against this life is anti praise god and the invisible union of the bride of christ says but you remember when it went down and the grain began to ripen that you find before that grain can ripen everything in that stalk has to be dead so he's talking about the stalk of the wheat plant or the corn it comes up and it grows from luther wesley to pentecost comes the tassel then it comes to grain but before the life can move all the way into the grain which is the fourth stage of life which is the restoration of the bride tree which is the bride in the resurrection on her feet now before that can come everything in the stalk has to be dead come to the fourth stage under the fourth steel amen move from white horse to red horse the black horse now to pale horse to death so now life is only in the grain there's no going to denominational systems for life life is only in the grain everything in the system is dead amen the pale horse has been riding for two thousand years and is riding wrote all those subjects to death eternal separation from god so that's it has to be death before the grain can ripen everything in the stalk has to be dead and that's true for us friends everything in our old stock thinking everything in our old denominational ways and the things that we had been taught since we were children and we thought were cold hard fast but go contrary to what the prophet of god brought us amen everything in the old stock has to be dead amen we've got to come to the fourth stage of light which is the true revelation of this word and anything that was misunderstood coming through justification and sanctification and the baptism holy ghost now has got to move into the message of life which is the revelation of this hour and everything else has to be dead hallelujah can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again if life is in the grain again everything else is dead what is it just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground the same jesus in bride form where is life where is that fourth stage of life where is the the resurrection of the mighty marching army in ezekiel 37 where is it it's the same jesus in brideform amen if you want to look for the ripe and grain it's in bride form if you want to look for the fourth message of life it's in bride form if you want to look for the white horse rider it's in bride form because the white horse rider is the holy ghost so prophet said in the fourth seal the white horse the great white horse rider the holy ghost and the holy ghost is here in the bride been loosed by the evening time message in the evening time by the end time message the holy ghost back in the church again the fourth stage of life the message of life same grain that went in the ground the same jesus in bride form that's why they're hollering and don't get nowhere they don't know his new name under this victory of redemption they don't know where he's at but it's the same jesus in brideform the restoration of the bride tree the bride has come back he's brought the bride back into her position and united with her amen and that life now is in her the same jesus in bright form same power same church same thing same word the same word sucked up through these and come out here and come to a head here and all that life that come through here picked up its people now it's forming up into the head for the rapture let's go to revelation chapter 10. this is why i say when brother branham was here he was the word made manifest do we believe that he was the very word of god the prophecy now in flesh and that prophecy in malachi 4 amen was now in flesh the prophecy in luke 17 30 was now in flesh the prophecies that have been laying there of a forerunner was now in flesh when jesus says elias shall surely come shall first come amen he was standing there manifesting that promise that jesus made he was the word made flesh but he was coming to forerun a coming and and now i would say that coming is in flesh there there is the same jesus in bride form in flesh that word is in flesh it's the manifested word for this hour and that life is poured into that flesh that flesh manifestation of the word and so we say john the baptist his ministry when that word was made flesh it was significant everything in his life was significant everything around him mattered amen the whole heavens the whole plan of god was moving around that individual would you agree when brother branham was here it was the word made flesh and everything in his life was significant and everything in the heavenlies was moving around that manifestation of the word it was indicating the time they were in amen it was the move of god that was on [Music] but we got to take it to our day we can't leave it there amen everything in the heavens everything the battle between life and death is going on around the manifested word amen because that's where christ is is in the manifested word the word for this hour the word that is taking on flesh and manifesting itself out in flesh that's where the battle is that's where the struggle between life and death is that's where all heaven and hell is meeting amen because he's anti-word he's anti-this manifestation of jesus christ in the formation of his bride that's where that messenger of death is trying to get to trying to diminish trying to discredit god's word praise be to god i hope by the time we're done that'll be a such a fact amen there won't be something in our mind that we're wondering about to be such a fact amen that 200 000 000 demons were unleashed amen and they come out of the euphrates in the sixth seal amen but in the sixth vial they crossed over into the religious realms because the waters had dried up and brother branham tells us what's happening he said the religious system was still holding it they couldn't get in to all the protestant churches that old babylonian religion the kings of the east amen the catholic religion couldn't merge over and move in to start taking over the promised land taking over in the church because euphrates still had water in it but under the sixth seal they could come out and he said where did they go into the armies of hitler mussolini and stalin and brought a bitter persecution against the jews but after the war where did they go amen he shows us it's the sixth vial they're crossing over now into the ecclesiastical realm the catholics are now that spirit i hope you don't think it's just some backroom meeting where the pope is meeting with the head of the lutheran and now it's a spirit that was moving in because there's no word to keep it out there's no barrier and now that spirit is moving in that spirit of idolatry amen is now moving in to the protestant church and taking over and he said where are those demons that are moving in they moved in to the armies of hitler mussolini and stalin amen they weren't trying to destroy the armies of hitler mussolini and stalin they were moving into those armies to destroy the elect chosen people of god now the spirit of the kings of the east are moving in to the religious from the ecclesiastical not to destroy the ecclesiastical realm but to use those armies of protestant catholics to destroy the elect chosen people of god and the first attacks are spiritual amen teaching against the word contradicting the word trying to bring confusion on the word spirits moving in ecclesiastical realms not physically trying to kill you spiritually trying to kill you not physically arresting you and bonding binding you but spiritually binding you into the prison house he said where do those spirits go amen a loose upon the church now loosed upon the bride but they'll never accomplish their goal because god has another plan for his bride revelations chapter 10 verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spaking to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went into the angel and i said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take eat take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said to me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings prophesy again what message the fourth message of life the breath of life to come into the army brother branham already did this the prophet of god had to eat that book and prophesy again he ate the book and the seals and after the ministry after the seals it was prophesy again but the bride has to follow the same pattern i'm going to read a super familiar portion of the of the message out of the church age book in the laodicean church age it says yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is its own mouth be so god is turning on her he would confound her through the prophet and the bride i hope you can catch that the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come now now this is a simple statement the spirit and the bride say come but this simple statement has such huge impact because the simple statement means you cannot stay where you are and be safe you cannot stay in where you are and be okay you cannot stay where you are because where i am is where the spirit is because the spirit and the bride are speaking together amen they're speaking simultaneously and the spirit we know is speaking through the bride and the spirit and the bride is saying come what are they saying come to come to the water of the fountain of life and drink freely so what they're saying is i am at the fountain of life i am with the fountain of life amen you cannot stay where you're at amen do you realize what the message of the bride is the message of the bride in this day is not you are all fine everything's okay don't worry about it just live a nice clean life the message of the bride is come leave the denominations leave the graves amen gather back into the homeland you can't stay where you're at and be okay we got to be careful what our message is and preach it the right way amen we know that there's an ordained foolish virgin i know that and ordained 144 000 and they will be given life amen at the white throne judgment not previously having it they don't have it the only way to have it now is to come to this water only place to get it friends amen so we're not diminishing from there is a there is a group amen that will receive life at the white throne judgment they have their place we're not taking from them but our message is not a foolish virgin message we're not here to say you're fine there stay there you're okay there amen the only message that i got in this bible is come come leave the nation leave the denomination it's got death throat on the door ichabod's over the door you can't stay there anymore you have to come to the water of life and drink if you want life i think sometimes in the message we got afraid of our message we got afraid to preach the message that's given us in the scriptures amen what the prophet told us we started preaching a message that was palatable and nice and you've got your place i've got my place and that's not saving anybody friends that's not helping anybody people have to know the truth amen there is no ark outside of this word there is no water of life outside where the spirit and the bride are drawing people too which is the water coming from the throne of god so we cannot water down our message we cannot compromise our message we have to stick with the message that's given us in the bible amen we're supposed to eat the book and prophesy again what does prophesy again mean that does not mean a new prophecy [Music] if somebody says i'm the bride i'm prophesying again i've got some things brother branham didn't get to that's not the bride because the bride has to prophesy against is she's got to prophesy what's already been said they're under their messenger not beside or above they're under their message and so our duty is to say what the tapes say to preach the message that the prophet brought not the message that's comfortable not the message that sounds nice not the message that makes people feel good but the message out of the bible come it's so simple it's so simple till you go to do it it's simple here and in the 17th verse of chapter 22 of revelation it's simple the spirit and the brightest they come we say amen you go to your neighbor and say come you can't stay baptized you can't stay luther you've got to come if you want life if you want to get in the ark if you want to connect to jesus christ today you've got to come drink of the water of life it's a big deal friends it's a big message he says he says the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from god that message is direct from god the spirit and the bride for she is his mouthpiece his voice is in her but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first age if you've not been repudiated yet i i beg you to check your message it's the truth friends if you say i can preach the message in such a way it doesn't cause any offense to a denominational believer you're not preaching the message it's just not the message [Music] oh lord that'll get me in all kinds of trouble but it's it's the truth anyhow friend it's the truth anyhow amen the seed shall not be heir with the shock but the original interpretation of this word he that understands my word and will believe on him that sent me he that understandeth that is he it's been made known to brother man it's typing this he's not saying he that heareth that you just heard the word you did you hear what that preacher's saying yeah i heard him he said that's not it to see that understandeth he that is who it's been made known to jesus said no man can come to me except my father has drawn him all that my father hath given me they will come to me my sheep my doves hear my voice a stranger they will not follow what is the voice of god that's a good question so we're going to get an answer from the prophet because the prophet is the one who told us that that god's voice will be in her and now he says what is the voice of god so if you want to know the voice that will be in her the voice of god that will be in her he's going to answer the question now what is the voice of god is the word of god the word of god is the voice of god the only time that the bride is giving the voice of god is when she's speaking the word of god and i want to tell you this it's not a denominational interpretation of the word that is the word of god in this day it's the word with the full revelation and the full understanding of christ the mystery of god today living word amen today [Music] that is the word what good would it have done for paul the apostle to go into the synagogue and say you know because i don't want to offend them and i've got an open door to preach here i'm not going to cause any offense i'm just going to stick with just moses because that's the truth why did they stone him why did they kick him out of the synagogue why was the whole city in an uproar amen because he wasn't willing just to stick with the portion of truth that they would agree with he had to bring him to present-day truth and present-day truth was taking all that was in that word and bringing it to today and saying this is the plan of salvation this is the water of life that's why they kicked him out of the synagogue if he would have showed up and just says i'm just going to preach on calvary today and talk about how the sacrifice of jesus christ was such a wonderful thing they would not have run him out amen bringing it to modern terms you see what i'm saying if he would have just showed up and said i want to talk about how god was so good to us in the exodus journey and how he took care of us and provided for us and if paul had just left it there and not brought it to the present day exodus that was going on they would have never kicked him out of the synagogue [Applause] but paul was not there to make them like him paul was there to say come come leave the dog must leave the traditions of the fathers and come to the truth praise god praise god what is the voice of god it's the word of god what is any man's voice but his word it's the word of god they'll hear the word of god in the resume of the ages the prophet says i sincerely believe that the spirit of god has been speaking to us not only teaching us the truths of the ages but he has been faithfully dealing with hearts that they may turn to him that is the reason for all preaching and teaching for it is in the preaching and teaching of the word that the sheep hear the voice of god and follow him again in the resume of the ages with this great power the church system will persecute the true bride this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching why will they try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching they won't keep churches from teaching and preaching but they will keep the bride from teaching and preaching because her teaching and preaching is the voice of god it is the voice of god he said try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it but before the antichrist in person takes over this complete world system of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the lord god will catch away his bride for the great married supper of the lamb but before that time they will try to keep the bride from teaching and preaching the word i tell you she's going to be teaching him her teaching and preaching is the voice of god and the voice of god in this day is saying come leave the system leave the lie amen the the the scale has been taken off the bible is open we see the tactics of the devil from all the way back in cain all the way through amen the bride can see the trail of the serpent so you can see it from cain and his false religion all the way through nimrod's false worship see it all the way through to the pharisees and the sadducees all the way through to those who would even come in the new testament church and try to corrupt the teaching of paul all the way through to today that would try to corrupt the message it's the trail of the serpent and the bride can see it because the bride can see it she can declare it and because she can declare it amen he's got to stop that voice but god won't let him stop that voice listen i'll say it this way don't ever quit the message don't ever quit declaring it don't ever get preaching it the hotter it gets and the more intense it comes down keep preaching it because that's your ticket out of here it is your escape clause it is you're a ticket to a translation it is moving you from this dimension to the next because the more they hate the message and the more they want to stop it there's a promise that before they shut her up she'll be taken out so i say make them want to shut her up amen give them a reason to get into action just tell the truth say these systems are leading people to death amen spiritual death spiritual separation from god amen they're not leading people to god they're not leading people anywhere near to god amen the systems the denominations the doctrines of men are they they're being led by a pale horse rider leading them to eternal separation from god and i say proclaim it because that's our message come leave those things it's death come to life there's a final struggle going on between life and death amen and and the word is in the bride amen brother brahm says in christ is the mystery of god revealed he said identified oh the devil is howling about this oh pay attention to this friends the devil is howling about this the manifested truth of the promise of the word in her alone [Music] that doesn't sound nice shouldn't it i mean shouldn't we say like it could be over there too wouldn't it be politically correct and nice to say well this is what i believe but i'm not trying to force it on you i mean it's okay for you to believe what you believe i believe that's the not the message of revelation 22 17. the message of revelation 22 17 is come and that's what the spirit's speaking that's what the spirit is not going to say anything different so if we're saying something different then it's not the spirit speaking through the bride somebody else is speaking another spirit this is what the devil is howling about the manifested truth of the promise of the word in her alone they don't have the answer when jesus come why don't those pharisees he said if i cast out devils by the finger of god who do you cast them out by sea he stood alone and his church stands alone she's not hooked with nothing but he was identified by god being the body that god dwelled in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil is howling these great organizations have set up something to close her up they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up she is now risen and by the power of the vindicated word promised to her i'm going to read that last sentence because we've heard it so much we might miss it they're going to set up something to close her up we know that they'll never do it so if threats come they'll never do it do you understand the threats come that's a good thing pressure comes that's a good thing because we have a promise instead of them in the closer up they'll never do it shall be taken up not closed up praise god now look what he says now she is now risen will she be taken up yes will it be a physical escape yes will there be a physical translation but she's already taken up friends the bride is already resurrected the church is already standing on her feet she has already risen up that's why she can hear what the spirit says that's why she can become the voice of god that's why she has the word to give to be the voice of the god that's why she knows what her message is and the messages come because she's already risen up this church is back the church that fell the bride that he wanted to marry the bride he wanted to be united to to fulfill his purpose that he showed in eden that bride is back friends and that's what the devil's howling about because she knows who she is she knows what she stands for she knows who the antichrist is and she knows what he's trying to do and she's willing to say it she is now risen and by the power of the vindicated word promised to her we've been raised by the word it's lifted us into heavenly places for us friends the heavens have been open for us there's been a door open there's been a spiritual climb that has taken place just like for john john was in the spirit and he's seen the seventh seal and we've been lifted up and seen the same thing amen and the heavens have been opened and we've seen the word coming in power and manifestation and all heaven here to back it up we've seen it friends it's a reality to us the heaven is open the heaven is no longer close to us like it was through the church ages but after the church ages when the word has come the heaven is now open to us friends and all of heaven backs us up why because heaven consists of the word and all the word has come i could use a little backup you've got the back up it's here the whole word is here praise god i love it oh praise god i take too long let's go to ephesians chapter six i always shorten my notes get them whittled down think that would be quick we won't take very long god forgive me ephesians 6 and 10. we'll go quickly now ephesians chapter 6 verse 10. finally my brethren be strong in the lord in the power of his mind put on the whole armor of god see this is a battle this is a fight this is the last struggle so we've got to put on the whole armor of god that's why paul is speaking this way because this is a fight the apostle paul is writing this brother ben and brought us back to this because this is warfare spiritual warfare amen and the trumpet has been blown that last seventh trumpet that contains all seven previous trumpets and the gospel trumpet has been sounded declaring spiritual war the final of the battles for the gentile age and so this is war put on the armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places i know it says high places but almost everywhere else that's used in the bible the same greek word is interpreted heavenly place translated heavenly places or heavenlies so where are we fighting amen if you don't have a vision of the of the heavens open you don't realize where the battle is amen we are on earth but we are fighting a heavenly battle we are fighting powers in the heavenlies amen powers in the heavens let's keep reading wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day i say this is the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth have we been given the truth amen cover yourself with the truth amen and having on the breastplate of righteousness what righteousness imputed righteousness why because we have the faith of abraham and our heart is covered by that faith amen and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace oh this is so interesting your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace amen this is war what are we talking about peace we've got armor we're going to fight a battle we've got a shield we've got our loins gert with truth we've got a breastplate of righteousness we're going to find we have a helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit what in the world are we doing with these shoes of peace because friends the only way to peace is to march forward amen you've got to have shoes to continue this journey because we can't stop and have peace we can't go back in half peace the only way to have peace is when the god of all peace shall brew satan under your feet shod with peace amen the only way there will be peace is when antichrist is slain by the word we'll have peace and the only way we'll have this is if this army continues to advance in the kingdom of god and move up in the revelation of god and move forward in the word of god that's why it's so detrimental amen so many times we think if i just let down on the word i'll have peace because the more we push the word the more we advance in the word and declare the truth by revelation the more pushback we get and it's easy to think if i want to have peace if i had less trouble and less criticism and less conflict amen if i just if i just pause for a minute i'll have peace i tell your friends you'll never have peace the only time we'll ever have peace is when our enemy is completely destroyed and he's not going to be completely destroyed until this bride has finished her mission on this earth so we have to have the shoes of peace moving us towards peace and above all take the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation protect our minds with the revelation of our salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto all perseverance and supplication for all saints if you notice in the armor we have armor with shoes covering we only have one weapon and that weapon is the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and it happens to be the same thing that was sticking out of the mouth of the white horse rider it was the word of god and the same thing that was in his mouth came into brother banham's in sabino canyon in his hand something hit his hand and he saw a sword it fit his hand just perfect he said he heard a voice see that's the king's sword he said oh a king sword they knight a king maybe he said no the king's sword which king is that king of kings and lord of lords the one on the white horse amen the the sword that was coming out of his mouth was put into the hand of a prophet amen and that prophet had that word in the hand and he took that word and he gave it to the bride and the bride has the sword of the spirit which is the word of god not a different sword not a lesser sword it's the same sword it's the word of god friends amen what weapon do you have forget reasoning forget effort forget trying forget all of those things the only victory we'll ever have in pushing back the enemy is if we take the word and the hand of faith and we take the feet shod with the preparation of the gospel and move forward with the sword we've got to keep moving with this word we've got to keep advancing on any antichrist spirit that comes against this word we can't slow down we can't back down we cannot stop we've got to march forward with the sword in our hand in the first seal brother man says christ has a sharp sword and watch it comes from his mouth the living word that's the word of god revealed to his servants where did that revelation go it came to me it's come to me i hope it's come to you and the rising of the sun it said and the sun the eson the sun the son of man the sun has got to be revealed again you believe that in the bride in the last day the sun has got to be revealed again in the bride in the last day and the quickening power has got to come quicken them out of these dead denominations and creeds to a living word of the living god brother brown says in the breach talk about a jubilee talk about a time when the land walked forth see the book's even sealed in heaven the mysteries are see is my name there i don't know i hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represented that redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world and he took the book open the book and tore off that seals and sent it down to earth to the seventh angel to reveal it to his people where did the word go amen from the lamb to the seventh angel to the people what do you have in your hand right now you've got the same sword that was coming out of the white horse rider's mouth amen and what did he do amen what did brother branham say that sword was to do the scripture said to smite the nations and brother bannon says it will come to slay the antichrist amen and who is our enemy in this day anything that's against the word is our enemy and anything that's against the word is antichrist and the only way to defeat the antichrist is with the sword that was coming out of his mouth in revelation 19 and that was put in the hand of a prophet and it was given down to us and now you're not left defenseless say man you're not left without a weapon amen you've been given the weapon that's guaranteed victory if we'll hold on to it and keep moving forward but if we put it down if we back up if we get tired of the fight amen we're going to be here losing but praise god this bride is going to win oh my now listen to this he tore off the seal sent it down to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people oh my what happened the screams the shouts the hallelujahs the anointed the power the glory the manifestation oh an old john who had been standing there our brother crying why he said everything in heaven everything in earth everything in the sea heard me holler amen blessings honor my power to be the hymn that lives forever and ever talk about a happy time when them seals broke john must have looked in and seen past the curtain of time and said there's john what happened when the seals broke amen the mystery was revealed and john was able heavens were open and john was able to see there's john he said i'm part of the mystery i'm part of the book amen when the seals open he could see himself in the mystery he could see himself under the seals he could see himself in glory and i tell you friends that's that's the great purpose and the opening of zeals to an individual is so that you can see yourself in the book you can see yourself on the other side amen you can rejoice and say made it am i going to make it i've already made it i'm already there there's no chance for not making it i'm already on the other side i'm already under the seals i was already in the book i'm already there i've already got a body eternal in the heavens how can i not make it oh you see what god has done in this day the reason he's made her an invincible army is he's took the seals off of the book he's took the seals off of our lives and if you can stand like john and you can peer beyond the curtain of time and you can say there's chad praise be to god there's no way i'll not fail i'm already there i have representation in heaven how do you know because he opened the seals because he showed me the mystery he revealed it to me praise be to god oh what a happy time no other everything in heaven no wonder everything on the earth no wonder everything under the earth heard john shouting i'll tell you something right now amen i guarantee the shouting that's going on with you right now because you realize you're on the other side you'll never be defeated there's no chance of you not making it because the seals have opened the mystery of your life and you see yourself on the other side amen there's a shout going on in heaven right now and heaven hears it now and everything under heaven under the earth hears it now that's what the war is about hell is on the earth heavens on the earth and they're fighting over this revelation of the truth in her alone it is the threat to the devil's kingdom it is the thing that will bring him complete destruction john must have looked and seen past the current time and said there's john oh he was so happy said everything in heaven he must have really cried out didn't he everything in heaven everything in the earth everything beneath the earth every creature and everything else heard me saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and power and might and riches belongs to him why when the revelation come that the lamb the redeemer our kinsmen had come back from the throne of mediatorial and had walked out here to take his possession what caused all the shouting what caused when he realized that he's already redeemed when you realize that the kingdom redeemer has come he's done with the mediatorial work he's done the work of redemption now he's come to claim his possession and when he comes to claim his possession amen the possession realized is that they're the possession it's no longer a mystery am i this or am i that or which doctrine's right or how do i be right or do i do hail mary's do i live a right life do i believe what luther preached how or do i know that i'm his possession am i the redeemed it was a mystery through the church ages but in the end time john realized when he saw the lamb come and take the book he realized he was the possession amen because after the church he's there he's there redeeming through the church agency they're mediating to the church ages but when he's done mediating for the church age believers now when it comes time amen to move into his possession in the bright age he can come forward from the work of mediation and he can come and take the book and lose the seals and come down and possess his possession and that's what's happening right now friends amen that's why brother brahm said there they know he was a redeemer on earth and they're hollering because they don't know who he is they don't know where he is all they know is a past manifestation they don't know where he is today he is currently possessing his bride he is claiming his possession he is here in his bride the son must be manifest again in his bride the same jesus christ in bright form jesus christ in the formation of the bride and the spirit and the bride they come hebrews 4 12 says for the word of god is quick and powerful what word the same one that came out of his mouth the same one that he's put in your hand the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit what does that mean it means he can separate you from you so you can know who you really are amen in this life you've been so close to that earthly spirit so bound in the tabernacle of fallen flesh of hybrid flesh so tight amen there's nothing that can separate the earthly carnal spirit from the soul but this word that's coming out of his mouth and it's coming this last day when the right horse rider has come down amen and he and he gave that sword that word to the to the to the prophet and the prophet gave it to the bride and now the bride has the word amen that will cut between the bone and the moral that'll cut between the soul and the spirit so that you can properly identify who you are and you can say what a great day that was when i realized i was not the son of charles and ella branham what did that it was the sword of the spirit that had come in this end time mother branham didn't say that till after the seals [Applause] and when they see the seals open when you see the redeemer come when you've got the sword that come out of the white horse rider's mouth it'll cut you to the separation of the spirit and the soul and you can see what john saw you can say i'm not the son of my mom and dad i'm not just an earthly vessel i'm not the product of a physical union but i was there before and i'm over there now [Applause] amen that's what this word does friends and that's why when we compromise on this word we're keeping people from finding their identification because it's this revelation under the seals that give people the ability to cut between the spirit of man and the soul that comes from god this is the only message that will do it this is the only revelation this is the only sword of this revealed word in this day that will separate the spirit from the soul and the spirit and the bride say come where is that white horse rider he's writing his church in the resurrection that the prophet of god said this is the resurrection that the church has now risen that the church is standing on her feet that the church is back where is the right horse rider he's riding his church in the resurrection all the way to glory who is the white horse rider it's the holy spirit when did the holy spirit come back in the church at the at the end time message the loosing of the seals and the end time message is there any is there any doubt where he is is there any doubt where the white horse rider is is there any doubt where the word is brother bennett says in the pergameon church age notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until he was first shown him by the father this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride where is the sword in the bride where is the white horse rider christ he's riding his church in the resurrection where is the holy ghost the life it's here the fourth messenger of life is here the white horse rider is here the armies of heaven are here this last great battle between the antichrist and christ is going on here the last great struggle between death and life is here it's going on here friends there is nothing else to preach there is nothing else to preach there is nothing else that will help but this word of life because it doesn't matter how much we can preach a message that makes the flesh feel good it doesn't matter how much you can preach a message that will comfort the spirit if you don't have the sword that can cut between the spirit and the soul there is no deliverance for anybody there is no deliverance in the social gospel there is no deliverance in a historical gospel there is only deliverance in the sword that has been placed in our hands in this day and that sword can separate because why because it can peel off the mystery of christ and you can find out i've been part of christ all along i was in the logos that came out of god amen i'm an attribute of god a child of god always been part of god always will be part of god where did i find that out i found it under the seals amen i found it under the seventh church age messenger when he revealed the mystery of god and the mystery of god was christ and i'm part of christ [Applause] in being part of christ i'm part of the revelation of the mystery of god when god wanted to become tangible god wanted to be manifest in his attributes god wanted fellowship with his attributes i was there in god then i was one of those attributes and now he saw to it to bring me out in this time and bring me through this faith so that he can unite back with me there's nothing else to preach there's nothing else to talk about there's nothing else to live for praise be to god i say preach it preach it until they want to shut us up because they'll never do it preach it until the whole system gathers because when they're just about to accomplish friends it's not about being antagonistic it's not about being it's not about fighting it's about bringing deliverance to people the only way to bring deliverance there's no other message in this day there's no other plan for salvation in this day there's no other ark of safety in this day the only place to be is in christ and christ is this revelation of this word the only place to say come to is to this fountain of life it's not antagonistic it's not argumentative it's the truth and it's the only truth and it's the only way to connect with god and it's the only way to unlock eternal life and it's the only way to see beyond the curtain of time the heavens have been opened there's nothing else to preach god is good the spirit and the bride say come come to this truth come to this fountain come to this manifested word god bless you saints let's stand musicians if you could come i hope with everything in me that you've seen the opening of the seals and in the opening of the seals you look beyond the curtain of time and you say well well that's me i'm secure i'm safe i've arrived i'm safe for more harm i'll never be defeated i'll never be cast down i'll never be deceived i'll never be separated from the love of god why because the seals revealed who i really was because the sword of the white horse rider that word that's coming out the living word coming out of his mouth that's been given to the servant has come and separated the spirit from the soul in me and i can see who i really am praise be to god let's bow our heads and pray heavenly father we love you lord god for those of us who have seen beyond the curtain of time for those of us who've seen our name on the book under the seals lord we rejoice like john rejoice shouting for heaven to hear shouting for hell to hear because the hell will never touch us lord while we've been delivered we've been set free lord from the bondage of corruption and the bondage of of ignorance lord we've been set free we've been given eye safe eyes to sea and ears to hear god i pray if there's any here that have not appeared beyond the curtain of time i pray god you'd break the seals to them now i pray to bring the sword down and cut away the spirit lord so that the soul can be born again so that there can be a new creation in christ jesus so there can be an accurate identification of self lord i pray that you would do it by your power lord lord i've done what you told me to do i wielded the sword lord the sword that you gave the prophet has been in our hands and we have wielded it now as true as we know how to and i prayed god that you would come to the lives of your children and you would separate now the spirit and the soul and now you would open that soul for a new birth you'd pour your spirit in and bring that lexi to life lord under the preaching of this word for we do it in obedience to you at your command lord and we now receive it by faith in jesus christ's name bring your children to life bring your seed to manifestation lord god let us go forth from here preaching a true message not a compromised message lord not a watered down message but lord let us go forward with the sweet sword in our hand preaching the truth lord so that others can go free let us cry with truth come come to this water of life god bless us your people forgive us lord for our setbacks forgive us lord for our laziness forgive us lord for our fears move past all of that lord and have your way in us let us surrender more holy lord more fervently let us give on ourselves to you we ask it in jesus christ's name bless your people lord bring life by the preaching of your word may the water strike the seed may a true revelation of a true identification come to anyone here that's not received that true identification yet let it happen lord i pray in jesus christ's name god be praised move on us lord have preeminence be pleased with all we say and do nor let us proclaim the truth let us proclaim in our actions in our lives and our families and our words and our deeds let us proclaim this truth in jesus christ's name we pray amen the
