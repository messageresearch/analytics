TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is it the time of grace we're living in yes is the time of grace is it the time of judgment we're living in yes is the time of judgment is this the time of judgment and time of grace overlapping goshen is in egypt technically goshen is in laodicea technically goshen is in egypt the bride is technically in laodicea the bride is not in laodicea because she's in the goshen and goshen is a position in christ goshen is not a location but goshen is a position both coexist we are in laodicea and we are not in love odyssey it depends on what where you placing everything is that right and that goes with everything that i'm talking about same thing with the blood when moses got the children of israel from egypt there was no blood in egypt well there was blood in egypt because there was blood in goshen grace and judgment coexist it now depends on what side are you in what side are you in because the grace and judgment both exist and this is what happened in the token uh dispensation are we in a time of judgment yes we are in a time of judgment because the lion of the tribe of judah has shown up up there is that right no we can say we are not in the time of judgment because we still have access to the blood so the blood is still with us but it is in goshen with the bride is that right so the blood is with the bride and is negotiation so if you want the blood you can say are we in a time of judgment i would say yes because the darkness is everywhere in egypt the darkness is is now loud this year it's a total chaos but yet there is a group of people that still have access to that blood they still have access to the light
