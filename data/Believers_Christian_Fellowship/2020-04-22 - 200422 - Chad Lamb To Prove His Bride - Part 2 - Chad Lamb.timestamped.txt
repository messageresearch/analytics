[4:06] possible
[4:08] amen let's take our bibles while we're
[4:10] standing and turn to isaiah
[4:12] 55. we'll read this together
[4:15] uh i just talked to brother gene petri
[4:17] just a few minutes before i left the
[4:19] house to come here and
[4:20] he's improving he's seeing improvement
[4:23] in all of his vitals and everything and
[4:25] he talked to his doctor today and his
[4:27] doctor said if things keep going the way
[4:28] they're going he
[4:29] he looks to be able to send him home on
[4:31] friday and so
[4:33] i told brother gene i said hey we'll
[4:34] come and get you we'll take you home
[4:36] however
[4:36] he said brother i'm willing to walk home
[4:38] you know
[4:40] he wants to get home really bad but i
[4:42] thank god you know he was using a very
[4:44] high level of oxygen they couldn't send
[4:46] him home because there was no way for
[4:47] him to get that much oxygen
[4:49] and he was using 12 liters a day and he
[4:52] said that's got to get down to six or
[4:53] below before they can send him home
[4:55] so i asked him today i said what was it
[4:57] at and he says eight
[4:58] it dropped four liters in one day as his
[5:02] need so his lungs are working better
[5:03] they're absorbing auction out of the air
[5:05] better
[5:06] and so he's he's doing better but let's
[5:08] just keep praying that god
[5:10] and brother gene petrie spares that he
[5:12] can go with no oxygen
[5:14] and then go home friday with no oxygen
[5:15] but let's just pray
[5:17] and then he also found out sonja his
[5:20] daughter sonya
[5:21] had been running a low grade fever so
[5:23] they went to have her tested for coveted
[5:24] and she did test positive
[5:26] she's not very ill she just has low
[5:28] grade fever and feeling tired
[5:29] but we need to pray for the whole family
[5:31] they've all been together in close
[5:32] contact
[5:33] we just need god to intervene for them
[5:36] and brother gene can come home and they
[5:37] can all
[5:38] recover and do well together so don't
[5:41] don't forget them when you're praying
[5:43] let's look at isaiah 55 together isaiah
[5:46] 55
[5:47] and verse 6.
[5:51] seek ye the lord while he may be found
[5:54] call ye upon him while he is near let
[5:57] the wicked forsake his way and let the
[5:59] unrighteous man his thoughts
[6:01] and let him return unto the lord and he
[6:03] will have mercy upon him and to our god
[6:05] for he will abundantly pardon
[6:08] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[6:09] neither are your ways my way saith the
[6:11] lord
[6:12] for as the heavens are higher than the
[6:14] earth so are my ways higher than your
[6:16] ways
[6:17] and my thoughts than your thoughts
[6:20] praise god let us bow our heads and pray
[6:23] heavenly father we thank you lord jesus
[6:25] for this opportunity to be together
[6:27] we thank you god that you allow us lord
[6:30] to open the pages of this bible once
[6:32] again
[6:32] and read from it lord and god we
[6:35] appreciate the privilege of being able
[6:37] to hold a bible and being able to be
[6:38] literate and read
[6:40] but we need more than that lord tonight
[6:42] we need you to bring divine revelation
[6:44] on your word
[6:45] we need you to unlock this word to our
[6:47] hearts lord that we can connect with it
[6:49] on the level that you want us to
[6:50] understand them i pray god that you
[6:53] would bless your people as we hear your
[6:54] word
[6:55] that you would use lord the gift within
[6:57] this vessel for your glory
[6:58] that we could have ears to hear in our
[7:00] heart to perceive all that you have for
[7:02] us
[7:02] this evening in jesus christ's name we
[7:04] pray amen
[7:06] you can be seated let's turn to romans
[7:09] chapter 11
[7:10] and read from there also
[7:16] i think it goes without saying that his
[7:18] ways are higher than our ways
[7:20] and his thoughts higher than our
[7:21] thoughts but but it's amazing although
[7:24] we know this we know it
[7:25] soundly we know it firmly we've
[7:27] testified to the experience of seeing
[7:30] it yet we always tend to fall back to
[7:32] our own thinking
[7:34] it's a trap you know we get trapped in
[7:35] our own minds our own thinking or
[7:37] our own uh understanding from years of
[7:40] experience and the way we interact with
[7:42] the world and
[7:43] so the constant fight is to take the
[7:45] word
[7:46] and if the word's different than my
[7:47] thinking reject my thinking and take the
[7:49] word
[7:50] you know the biggest problem we have is
[7:52] reasoning
[7:53] and reasoning is our enemy i mean it's
[7:56] not it's not doing us any favors
[7:58] reasoning is our enemy
[7:59] and we must fight that and have the mind
[8:02] of christ which comes from his word and
[8:03] we need the spirit to
[8:05] to to unlock the word for us so that we
[8:07] can see it the way he wants us to see it
[8:09] let's read here in romans 11 33
[8:13] all the depth of the riches both of the
[8:15] wisdom and knowledge of god
[8:17] how unsearchable are his judgments and
[8:19] his ways past finding out
[8:22] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[8:24] or who hath been his counselor
[8:26] or who has first given to him and it
[8:27] shall be recompensed unto him again
[8:30] for of him and through him and to him
[8:33] are
[8:33] all things to whom be glory forever amen
[8:37] so god's ways are higher than our ways
[8:39] who has ever given him counsel
[8:41] who's had a better idea who can advise
[8:44] god who can give him a piece of
[8:45] information or give something to god
[8:47] that god will owe him something back
[8:49] it'll never happen that way god god's
[8:52] ways are so much different than our ways
[8:54] as human beings
[8:55] that we have to learn to reject our
[8:57] thinking and reject our ways
[8:58] and take his way above all else so
[9:01] that's what we're constantly doing all
[9:02] the time
[9:04] let's go to the book of acts acts
[9:05] chapter 1.
[9:08] i'm just continuing on with the same
[9:09] thought from sunday so it's the same
[9:11] title to prove his bride
[9:12] this will be part two but i want to look
[9:15] at
[9:16] acts this isn't really part of my uh my
[9:19] thought this is just something that god
[9:21] awakened me to this weekend and i want
[9:24] to read this scripture and
[9:25] and just remind you what the lord
[9:27] reminded me of
[9:29] verse 8 acts chapter 1 verse 8 but you
[9:32] shall receive power after that the holy
[9:33] ghost has come upon you
[9:35] and you shall be witnesses unto me both
[9:37] in jerusalem and all judea
[9:39] and in samaria and unto the uttermost
[9:41] parts of the earth
[9:42] now if you'll remember that was the text
[9:45] that we took our thought from
[9:46] for our watch night service if you
[9:49] remember and i had completely forgotten
[9:51] and god brought this back to my memory
[9:52] over the weekend
[9:53] that at watch night i said that my
[9:56] vision for us as individuals and for the
[9:57] church
[9:58] is that you'll be my witness starting in
[10:00] jerusalem and in judea and de samaria
[10:03] and to the uttermost parts of the earth
[10:04] and that jerusalem is us our own selves
[10:08] that the word must be alive that we must
[10:10] be witnesses within our own self of the
[10:12] word
[10:13] and then judea our family and then
[10:15] samaria and our area
[10:16] and our friends and extended family and
[10:18] then to the uttermost parts of the earth
[10:20] and that was for me what i got god was
[10:22] calling for us to be our focus
[10:25] and what a great way to accomplish that
[10:28] purpose amen
[10:29] i felt god impressed me to bring that on
[10:32] watch night and that that should be our
[10:34] goal that that first that that the
[10:36] doctrine is sound in me that i
[10:38] have a real connection with jesus christ
[10:41] and i'm really living a genuine life
[10:43] from my heart and there's no hypocrisy
[10:45] in me that i
[10:46] i am what i proclaim to be all the way
[10:48] through
[10:50] that that you feel the you know that
[10:52] that that that
[10:53] we are filled amen with the spirit of
[10:55] god and we're living a true life
[10:57] and then from there we strengthen our
[10:59] families
[11:00] amen and then from the families to our
[11:03] associates in our area and our community
[11:06] and then to the uttermost parts of the
[11:07] earth and so god shut down the uttermost
[11:10] parts of the earth we can't travel we
[11:11] can't go anywhere
[11:12] i had a trip planned and for easter i
[11:15] was supposed to go
[11:16] for easter to preach easter convention
[11:18] in two different countries
[11:20] and god shut that down in fact he shut
[11:22] the whole world down amen
[11:24] nobody's going anywhere so we don't
[11:26] worry about the uttermost parts of the
[11:27] earth amen
[11:29] and then you know god limited some of
[11:31] our
[11:32] our our socialization some of our travel
[11:34] even in our community
[11:36] and even some people's work and limited
[11:38] that and brought us back into the home
[11:40] amen so we don't have to worry about
[11:42] that
[11:42] and so god give us a little more time
[11:44] some of us have a little more time
[11:46] to focus on the word and be in prayer
[11:48] and all this stuff so
[11:49] god we felt like that was god directing
[11:52] us
[11:52] amen but if god thought we missed the
[11:54] point he was going to make sure
[11:56] that he set the scenario right so that
[11:58] we could start in jerusalem
[12:00] and then in judea and then in samaria
[12:02] and maybe if the borders ever opened to
[12:04] the uttermost parts of the earth
[12:07] so when god hit that when that come back
[12:09] like a memory to me
[12:10] i said oh praise god this is exactly in
[12:13] line with the way he was leading us
[12:15] anyways
[12:16] and it looks like a disaster but it's
[12:19] exactly god fulfilling his purpose
[12:21] he he wants he wants us to start with us
[12:26] if we're going to run with a message we
[12:28] have to have a message we can't just be
[12:29] running
[12:30] and we shouldn't have you know half of
[12:32] it or or half the life but we need to be
[12:35] filled with the word amen we need to
[12:37] be the word on display and we need to
[12:39] spend enough time with god
[12:41] that god can root out all of those
[12:43] things that are contrary to him
[12:46] amen you know god is god is able
[12:49] to shut down i mean he shuts down
[12:51] whatever he wants to shut down
[12:53] he shuts down travel he shuts down
[12:55] entertainments i mean
[12:57] even people who are struggling with
[12:58] sports praise god it's not a struggle
[13:01] he shut them down you know all of these
[13:04] things
[13:05] god has a way of shutting things down
[13:08] the in in putting us in a place where
[13:10] his will can be accomplished in our
[13:12] lives
[13:13] and and sometimes it's uncomfortable and
[13:15] it's not pleasant and there's
[13:17] there's maybe some sacrifices that we
[13:19] have to go through but god is going to
[13:20] accomplish his purpose
[13:22] he's going to get us and if that's what
[13:24] he was if the leading that i felt was
[13:27] correct
[13:27] amen and i believe it was with all my
[13:29] heart at watch night that that's the
[13:30] direction we should go in
[13:32] god has just made it so much easier to
[13:34] accomplish this purpose
[13:36] so i'm thankful i'm thankful that god
[13:39] can prepare us and god can come along
[13:41] and do
[13:41] what sometimes we're incapable of doing
[13:43] ourselves
[13:45] we wouldn't have shut down our
[13:46] fellowship and socialization and travel
[13:49] willingly and voluntarily we wouldn't
[13:51] have shut that down
[13:52] so god did amen because this is this
[13:55] matters to god
[13:57] and and i feel like if we can catch what
[13:59] he's doing and already we have and so
[14:01] many
[14:02] of you have testified that you're
[14:03] feeling stronger
[14:05] stronger in the lord more time to
[14:07] meditate on god think about what we're
[14:08] doing
[14:09] more time in the home to strengthen the
[14:11] family more family alter more family
[14:13] prayer time more devotions more
[14:15] discussion on the word of god
[14:16] more hearing the prophet's voice in the
[14:18] house more and more and more of those
[14:20] things
[14:21] amen is exactly what we need and god is
[14:24] strengthening
[14:24] us from jerusalem our home base amen and
[14:27] then judea
[14:28] our family bases and then moving out
[14:31] from there as he opens that up
[14:33] but but thank god amen he's kept things
[14:35] in the situation they need to be long
[14:37] enough for us to get strong
[14:40] so this is not to weaken us this is to
[14:42] strengthen us
[14:44] this is not for the weakening of the
[14:46] church this is for the strengthening of
[14:47] the church
[14:49] even times the times that we couldn't
[14:51] gather together was not for the
[14:52] weakening of the churches for the
[14:53] strengthening of the church
[14:55] and still we can't all gather together
[14:57] amen it's not possible right now but
[15:00] it's for the strengthening of the church
[15:02] it's for the strengthening
[15:03] why because this building is not the
[15:05] church
[15:06] so it it's not for the strengthening of
[15:08] the building the structure the edifice
[15:10] has nothing to do with that the church
[15:12] is the bride it is the people
[15:14] it is the dwelling place it is the
[15:16] temple of the holy ghost and god wants
[15:17] to strengthen that dwelling place
[15:20] individually as families as a local
[15:23] congregation and moving out from there
[15:25] but praise be to god
[15:27] he set up the circumstances that he's
[15:30] driving it the way he wants it to go
[15:32] and i'm thankful because i'm seeing i'm
[15:34] seeing it produce fruit
[15:36] i'm seeing the trial produce fruit i'm
[15:38] seeing the circumstances produce fruit
[15:41] and i thank god for that because his
[15:42] ways are higher than our ways
[15:45] his ways he who can find them out
[15:48] who can instruct him who could have told
[15:50] him this was the best way
[15:52] who would have come up with this plan
[15:53] and say god i think the best thing that
[15:55] you could do
[15:56] is let a worldwide virus break out shut
[15:59] down everything
[16:00] amen send us home from work and force us
[16:02] to be at home more
[16:04] that was not in our mind that was not
[16:06] our idea but god has everything under
[16:08] control
[16:09] he knows what he's doing nothing's out
[16:11] of control with god
[16:13] so i'm going to read this quote from
[16:16] that we read from sunday
[16:17] to kind of set the stage for the thought
[16:19] and then move from there
[16:21] and the god of this evil age he preached
[16:23] in august of 65
[16:26] said what would god call a people out of
[16:27] this evil age for his name
[16:30] why he's asking a question why for what
[16:32] reason would god call a people out of
[16:34] this evil age
[16:35] for his name he said the reason is is to
[16:38] try her
[16:39] his bride when she has made manifest
[16:41] been tried been proven
[16:43] proven to satan like it was at the
[16:46] beginning so shall it be
[16:47] at the end so how was it in the
[16:50] beginning
[16:51] amen the the the bride adam's bride was
[16:54] proven to satan but she failed she
[16:56] didn't pass the test
[16:58] but we're coming full circle back to the
[17:00] proving again of the wife
[17:02] of the last adam only she's
[17:04] predestinated to pass the test
[17:06] do you realize friends what what an
[17:08] accomplishment that is for god but also
[17:10] what a consolation that is for us
[17:13] that she's predestinated not to fall
[17:16] you know because if we just look at
[17:18] ourselves you could say
[17:20] you know in myself as a human being i
[17:22] would say i'm destined to fall
[17:25] i'm destined to fail on the human side
[17:27] if i look at myself and my human
[17:29] abilities and my mind and my strength
[17:31] and my willpower
[17:32] and all of these things that we have as
[17:34] a natural part of being a human
[17:36] it's destined to fail it will fail it
[17:39] will fail over and over and over again
[17:41] that's why we can put no confidence in
[17:43] willpower or ability or intellectual
[17:46] understanding
[17:46] our confidence is in the word of god it
[17:49] will happen because he said it will
[17:50] happen
[17:51] not because i'm able to make it happen
[17:54] you know what a consolation because if
[17:56] it was up to us
[17:57] to reverse what eve did we would just
[18:00] keep continuing to fail in eve's failure
[18:03] but it's not up to us god and brother
[18:05] man said god put himself in partnership
[18:07] with man but it's not a partnership
[18:09] where
[18:10] where it's one of those things where god
[18:12] needs your strength and he needs your
[18:14] ability
[18:14] and god's just sitting idly by waiting
[18:16] for you to get strong enough
[18:18] he's on partnership he just needs your
[18:20] vessel
[18:22] to accomplish his purpose because he has
[18:24] to do it through man
[18:25] he's on partnership with you but not
[18:27] partnership and your strength or ability
[18:29] it's not that kind of partnership he
[18:32] just needs the tabernacle you dwell
[18:34] in and he needs to bring life to the
[18:36] seat he put in that tabernacle
[18:38] so he needs you to get out of the way
[18:40] that's the partnership
[18:42] the partnership is stay out of my way
[18:46] while i do what i'm going to do oh
[18:49] hallelujah so he's got he's got his own
[18:51] partnership to accomplish his goal
[18:53] but our end of the deal is not to get in
[18:55] the way
[18:56] and run around and figure a bunch of
[18:58] stuff out our
[18:59] our purpose and our goal should be to
[19:02] die
[19:03] as much as i can possibly die to my
[19:05] human side
[19:06] to forget everything i've ever known
[19:08] amen to count it all is done
[19:10] amen to lay aside all of my reasoning
[19:12] and all of my ability
[19:13] and just die and be humble and be lonely
[19:16] and be nothing so that he can take this
[19:19] nothing and he can do what he's always
[19:20] predestinated to do in this hour so what
[19:24] do i have to do
[19:25] nothing just believe him and get out of
[19:27] the way
[19:28] because you're predestinated this bride
[19:31] is predestinated not to fall
[19:35] and if it wasn't that way it would there
[19:37] was no way you could keep from falling
[19:41] if it wasn't for the predestinated plan
[19:44] of god
[19:44] there's no way but because it's the
[19:48] predestinated plan of god
[19:50] it cannot fail everything's going to be
[19:53] all right
[19:54] that's a great consolation so why in
[19:57] this evil age
[19:59] why in such a dark evil age would he
[20:01] call out a bride for his name
[20:03] why after you know there's been so many
[20:05] ages and so many days gone by and
[20:07] different dispensations
[20:09] and none of them was the age that he was
[20:11] gonna bring forth his bride and
[20:12] perfection
[20:14] it was building a bride absolutely but
[20:16] this is the time that he's gonna bring
[20:18] his bride
[20:19] into perfection and what time does he
[20:21] wait for he waits for the worst
[20:23] possible time i mean
[20:27] i'm talking humanly speaking from a
[20:28] reasoning perspective
[20:30] amen when everything is stacked against
[20:33] the bride
[20:34] and everything in the world has come to
[20:36] the peak of this evil age in satan's
[20:39] eden
[20:39] where he has full sway over everything
[20:42] the news you read he's in control of it
[20:44] amen the images that are on display he's
[20:47] in control of it
[20:48] he's in every government he's in control
[20:51] of it
[20:52] the laws that are passed he's in control
[20:54] of it everything that's going on all
[20:56] policy
[20:57] he's in control of it this is satan's
[20:59] eden he is the god of this evil age
[21:02] and he's in full power and full
[21:04] authority in
[21:05] in this world
[21:09] and that's the way god wants it and
[21:12] humanly speaking be like that's the
[21:13] worst
[21:14] time amen to bring forth your bride but
[21:17] in god's mind that's the best time
[21:20] to bring forth his bride because he he's
[21:22] in
[21:23] he's he's in a showdown he's in a war
[21:26] amen with his enemy lucifer amen and he
[21:29] wants to prove
[21:30] to satan that she's not like eve and
[21:32] what better way to prove it
[21:34] than to let satan say now now i'm going
[21:36] to give you 6 000 years
[21:39] and you can do whatever you want i'm
[21:41] giving you free reign
[21:43] whatever you can convince the people to
[21:45] do whatever
[21:46] you and your horde of demons can move
[21:48] the people to do
[21:50] i'm giving you free reign to do it
[21:54] and when you get it perfect
[21:57] when you've accomplished everything that
[22:00] you want to accomplish and you've got
[22:02] everything wrapped up as tight as you
[22:04] can get it wrapped up
[22:05] that's when i'm going to bring her forth
[22:06] and you can test her with everything you
[22:08] got
[22:09] every every entertainment every pleasure
[22:13] i mean you can bombard her with the lust
[22:15] of the eyes the lust of the flesh the
[22:16] pride of life
[22:17] and and fill her senses full of it
[22:21] fill her mind her ears her eyes
[22:24] i mean every sense is full of the pride
[22:28] of life
[22:28] the lust of the flesh and the lust of
[22:30] the eyes the three things that eve was
[22:32] tried by
[22:35] and now we live in a world that is
[22:37] absolutely
[22:38] inundated with those things
[22:41] and that's when he's going to bring her
[22:43] up and say see and she won't fall
[22:45] she's predestinated not to fall
[22:49] amen so god
[22:53] for some reason he likes to work against
[22:56] the odds
[22:57] if you read through the bible god loves
[22:59] to work against the odds
[23:01] i mean no matter how many they bring
[23:04] they bring
[23:04] tens of thousands and then to camp
[23:07] against jerusalem to come against israel
[23:09] they bring hundreds of thousands god
[23:11] says hmm
[23:13] we got too many oh they've got 150 000
[23:17] plus cherries well let's get it down
[23:19] let's get it down let's see
[23:20] i think 300 will do that's the way god
[23:24] likes it
[23:25] he likes his city under siege he likes
[23:28] his army outnumbered
[23:30] i don't understand it but i know god
[23:32] loves to prove his word
[23:34] that's what the prophet tells us his
[23:36] thinking's not like our thinking
[23:38] his ways are not like our ways god loves
[23:40] to work out of humility
[23:42] amen he loves to work out of weakness
[23:45] amen when jesus came there was no beauty
[23:47] that we should behold him
[23:48] he had no strength might ability no
[23:50] pedigree he had nobody on his side
[23:54] and in fact the closer he came to the
[23:56] purpose he was on earth
[23:58] the fewer people would even associate
[24:00] with him so as he grew in weakness
[24:02] god was growing in his ability to show
[24:04] forth his power
[24:06] and when jesus was utterly weak
[24:10] in the flesh he was he was as weak as he
[24:13] could be
[24:14] in captivity amen arrested in bonds
[24:17] beaten
[24:19] mercilessly to where he could not carry
[24:20] his own cross
[24:22] because he was so weakened in the flesh
[24:25] marred his vision so marred he didn't
[24:27] even look like a man
[24:29] as weak as he could get in absolute
[24:32] weakness
[24:33] and defeat he had the greatest victory
[24:35] he's ever had
[24:37] and if that's the way god likes to work
[24:40] amen why should it surprise us
[24:42] when he keeps pulling the rug out from
[24:44] under us and taking away
[24:46] strength and taking away comforts and
[24:48] taking away things that we begin to lean
[24:50] on
[24:51] if we're leaning on anything besides the
[24:53] word of god god's going to
[24:55] take it away from us until
[24:58] we're standing with nothing we have
[25:00] nothing we don't have a proper
[25:02] understanding like we should
[25:03] uh brother remember if we if you think
[25:05] you know anything you know nothing as
[25:07] you should
[25:07] that's what the scripture says we don't
[25:09] have enough understanding enough wisdom
[25:11] enough experience enough strength we
[25:13] don't have anything and so anything that
[25:15] we're using to compensate for our
[25:17] weakness he's taking it away
[25:20] taking away reputations taking away
[25:22] perceived strength
[25:23] taking away numbers taking away
[25:26] everything
[25:27] take it all away so you have nothing to
[25:29] depend on but the word of god
[25:31] and with the word of god in the word of
[25:33] god alone amen this bride will stand
[25:37] and she will reverse what has been done
[25:39] in the garden of eden
[25:40] with nothing but faith in the word of
[25:42] god
[25:44] hallelujah there's so many times we want
[25:47] to
[25:48] see something you know we want to see
[25:51] something mighty
[25:53] we want to see something powerful and
[25:55] then it gives us faith once
[25:57] once i see something happen then it
[25:58] gives me faith to believe
[26:00] but god wants us after faith to believe
[26:01] when you see nothing happen
[26:04] when there's nothing on the surface
[26:05] moving when nobody's
[26:07] having a dynamic display of anything but
[26:09] everybody's in their homes
[26:11] praying quietly with their family amen
[26:13] that's when god's doing something
[26:16] and that's when we we just want to see
[26:18] something
[26:19] amen and then i can believe and i'm
[26:21] encouraged amen but god is getting his
[26:23] bride into a different place
[26:25] amen where she can believe when she sees
[26:27] nothing
[26:29] it's a hard place to be as human beings
[26:32] but it's where god wants us
[26:34] so why why would god call a people of
[26:37] this evil
[26:37] age for his name the reason is to try
[26:40] her his bride
[26:41] when she has made manifest been tried
[26:43] been proven proven
[26:45] to satan like it was at the beginning so
[26:47] shall it be at the end
[26:49] it goes down two paragraphs later he
[26:51] says we find now
[26:52] this evil age is to prove to satan she
[26:55] is not
[26:55] like eve that she is not that type of a
[26:59] woman and she will be tried
[27:00] by his word the bride as adam's bride
[27:03] was tried
[27:04] by the word only this one
[27:07] won't fail in 1954
[27:11] brother brahm says in the message god
[27:13] has provided away
[27:15] see how god does testing god permits you
[27:18] sometimes to get a little worse
[27:20] after you're prayed for just to test you
[27:24] that is not what we like to hear
[27:29] but he says god does that you know with
[27:32] the denominational mindset
[27:34] that's counter as counter to the
[27:36] denominational mindset
[27:38] because the denominational mindset is
[27:39] god is a good god he wants to bless you
[27:42] he wants to do good for you
[27:43] and right many of us spend our time in
[27:47] denomination with the nominational
[27:49] mindset and we understand how some of
[27:50] that works
[27:53] but but he says he permits you sometimes
[27:57] to get a little worse after you're
[27:58] prayed for
[27:59] just to test you the testings and trials
[28:03] of faith
[28:03] but he that endureth there it is hold on
[28:06] take god at his word
[28:07] believe every word of it no matter what
[28:11] anything
[28:11] else says or does believe it anyhow
[28:14] no matter what the circumstances look
[28:16] like believe
[28:18] god anyhow so we've got to quit
[28:21] using our eyes to have faith
[28:25] and you say well of course brother chad
[28:27] but i mean it's the same trap we always
[28:29] fall into
[28:30] where our eyes and our ears and our mind
[28:33] are bombarded by negative messages and
[28:35] and over and over more negative and more
[28:37] negative and more negative
[28:39] and all of a sudden it gets harder and
[28:41] harder to encourage yourself in faith
[28:43] because of what the eyes see in the ears
[28:45] here
[28:46] and what you read in text messages
[28:48] coming across i mean we've been in a
[28:50] long grinding trial
[28:52] long one person gets well another person
[28:55] gets sick
[28:56] and very sick and it grinds on and
[28:59] there's nothing else we'd like to hear
[29:00] then
[29:01] everybody's better and there's no more
[29:02] problems but god is allowed one after
[29:05] the other for the drag
[29:06] four weeks five weeks until until we're
[29:09] tired
[29:10] and the only thing that we can do is
[29:12] stand on the word
[29:15] god's word doesn't change he'll let it
[29:17] grind on if he wants it to grind a
[29:19] little longer what's he doing
[29:20] he's grinding all of you out of you he's
[29:22] grinding all of me out of
[29:25] until we say you know what not what i
[29:28] read on a text
[29:30] is going to encourage me anymore not
[29:32] what i hear with my ears or see with my
[29:34] eyes
[29:35] but what i see in this bible is where my
[29:38] encouragement is going to come from
[29:40] because he's made promises and he's the
[29:42] one who's able to keep them
[29:43] i never could do anything to begin with
[29:45] but now i'm more sure of it than i ever
[29:47] was before
[29:48] there's nothing i can do to bring to
[29:49] pass the word of god all i can do is
[29:51] believe in it and wait for him to bring
[29:53] it to pass
[29:55] all that's required is faith in his word
[29:57] that's what he's asking for that's what
[29:58] he's looking for he's always been
[30:00] looking for faith in his word
[30:01] he's always been requiring faith in his
[30:03] word and when he finds a
[30:05] somebody who can believe his word then
[30:06] he moves on the word and brings it to
[30:07] pass
[30:09] but he does it his way sometimes he lets
[30:12] it get a little worse after you prayed
[30:14] for
[30:15] just to see what you'll do
[30:18] no matter what the circumstances look
[30:20] like believe god
[30:22] anyhow let's go to john chapter 11.
[30:27] i want to look at a story or two here in
[30:30] the bible and then
[30:32] in the new testament then i want to look
[30:34] at job for a little while
[30:39] john chapter 11.
[30:43] i'm going to begin at verse 3.
[30:50] is the story of lazarus he's sick
[30:53] says verse three therefore his sister
[30:54] sent unto him saying lord
[30:56] behold hume thou loveth the sick
[30:59] when jesus heard that he saith this
[31:01] sickness is not unto death key in on
[31:04] that
[31:05] jesus said this sickness is not unto
[31:07] death
[31:08] because the disciples are going to get
[31:10] confused because of that statement
[31:14] see god is not obligated
[31:19] to make things easy for a carnal mind to
[31:21] comprehend
[31:23] he's not obligated to make it simple to
[31:26] a carnal mind
[31:27] he makes it simple to the mind of christ
[31:30] and he makes it simple
[31:32] by revelation but he's not obligated to
[31:34] make it
[31:35] simple to a carnal understanding
[31:39] this sickness is not unto death but for
[31:42] the glory of god
[31:43] that the son of god might be glorified
[31:45] thereby
[31:47] it says now jesus loved martha and her
[31:50] sister and lazarus
[31:52] when he had heard therefore that he was
[31:53] sick he abode two days still in the same
[31:56] place where he was
[31:58] then after that he saith unto his
[31:59] disciples let us go into the jail again
[32:02] so he gets word that he finds out
[32:05] that lazarus is sick and he says this
[32:08] sickness is not unto death but the glory
[32:10] of god
[32:11] and he makes a statement he knows he's
[32:13] sick they sent him to him because he was
[32:15] really sick
[32:17] but then he hangs out for two more days
[32:21] amen it doesn't make sense
[32:25] to the carnal mind because
[32:28] they're asking him there's a reason
[32:30] they're notifying him lazarus is sick
[32:33] and you find out when he shows up on the
[32:35] scene both sisters say lord if you had
[32:37] been here he had not died
[32:38] they were calling for jesus to come and
[32:40] pray for lazarus
[32:41] they were calling for him to come and
[32:42] change the scene he knew
[32:44] he was sick he knew that they come for
[32:47] him but
[32:47] yet he had to wait and not go right then
[32:50] because if he went right then it
[32:52] wouldn't work out the way god wanted to
[32:54] work
[32:54] because sometimes it's got to get a
[32:56] little worse
[32:57] before it gets better because that's the
[33:00] plan of god
[33:01] sometimes it's got to get a little worse
[33:03] before it gets better
[33:09] so verse 11 these things said he and
[33:12] after that he saith unto them
[33:14] our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go
[33:16] that i may wake him out of his sleep
[33:18] then said his disciples lord if he sleep
[33:20] he shall do well howbeit jesus spake of
[33:22] his death but they thought
[33:24] that he had spoken of taking of a rest
[33:25] in sleep
[33:27] then said jesus unto them plainly
[33:29] lazarus is
[33:30] dead he just said the sickness is not to
[33:34] death
[33:36] can you imagine being a disciple that
[33:38] day well i mean that's
[33:40] take place over two days but didn't we
[33:43] hear him did did i hear him wrong
[33:45] peter andrew help me out here did i hear
[33:48] him right
[33:49] he said the sickness is not the death
[33:51] but he just says lazarus is dead
[33:55] mother is dead and i'm glad for your
[33:57] sakes that i was not there
[34:00] to the intent you may believe
[34:03] nevertheless
[34:04] let us go unto him jesus says
[34:08] it was good for you that i didn't go
[34:13] but in waiting he died yeah that's a
[34:16] good thing
[34:18] you understand we can never use the
[34:21] carnal mind to understand god and we can
[34:23] never figure god out
[34:25] we have to be very careful that we never
[34:27] try to use reasoning and logic to
[34:29] understand god because god doesn't
[34:30] operate by reasoning and logic
[34:33] and reasoning and logic will never
[34:34] understand god you can only understand
[34:36] god by faith
[34:40] it says our friend lazarus or i'm sorry
[34:42] he goes down to verse 15. i'm glad for
[34:44] your sakes that i was not there
[34:46] he's now dead and i'm glad
[34:51] amen i love the lord and i love his word
[34:55] to the intent that he may believe
[34:56] nevertheless let us go unto him
[34:59] let's go down to verse 21. he shows up
[35:02] martha runs out to him and then he said
[35:04] martha unto jesus lord
[35:05] if thou has been here my brother had not
[35:08] died
[35:10] see they had known of jesus
[35:13] raising the dead before they known of
[35:15] jesus healing the sick
[35:17] right they have known of jesus to be a
[35:19] healer of the sick
[35:21] and they've even known of jesus to raise
[35:22] the dead but here she comes and she
[35:25] knows
[35:25] she knows without question that if jesus
[35:28] had come
[35:29] lazarus wouldn't die she's got absolute
[35:32] faith in what she's seen done before she
[35:35] has
[35:35] absolute faith in the ability of jesus
[35:37] to heal the sick
[35:38] without question there wasn't a question
[35:40] in martha's mind
[35:41] that if you had been here he would have
[35:43] not died
[35:46] so she's got a degree of faith she
[35:49] believes
[35:51] he says verse 22 but i know
[35:54] listen what she says but i know that
[35:56] even now whatsoever thou will ask of god
[35:58] god will give it thee i know he wouldn't
[36:01] have died
[36:02] but what he what even right now whatever
[36:04] you ask him god will give it to you
[36:07] then jesus said unto her thy brother
[36:10] shall rise again martha's in them i know
[36:13] that he shall rise again in the
[36:14] resurrection at the last day
[36:17] going back to her understanding of the
[36:20] bible and she's not wrong
[36:22] but she's not right she's right but
[36:25] she's missing the point
[36:29] amen jesus said under i am the
[36:31] resurrection and the life
[36:33] he that believeth in me though he were
[36:35] dead yet shall he live
[36:36] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[36:39] shall never die
[36:40] believeth thou this she saith in them
[36:42] yea lord i believe that thou art christ
[36:44] the son of god
[36:45] which should come into the world
[36:49] skip down to verse 32 now mary comes her
[36:51] sister
[36:52] then when mary was come where jesus was
[36:54] and saw him
[36:55] she fell down on his feet saying unto
[36:57] him lord if thou had been here my
[36:59] brother
[36:59] had not died out of the mouth of two or
[37:03] three witnesses
[37:04] they are a believing family they believe
[37:07] in the power of god to heal they believe
[37:09] in the ministry of jesus christ
[37:11] they believe he was the son of god that
[37:13] was coming to the world and they knew
[37:14] beyond a shadow of doubt
[37:16] if jesus would have been there he would
[37:18] not have died
[37:21] they don't understand why he delayed in
[37:23] coming two days
[37:24] they don't know why lazarus is dead they
[37:27] don't know why he came late
[37:29] his disciples don't know why he said the
[37:31] sickness is not in the death and he says
[37:33] lazarus is dead
[37:35] and i'm happy for your sex i wasn't
[37:37] there do you understand they don't
[37:38] understand any of this right now
[37:40] none of this makes any sense to them
[37:42] right now amen and if you've ever been
[37:44] in a trial and right in the middle of it
[37:46] not
[37:46] anything makes sense nothing's working
[37:49] the way it's supposed to work
[37:50] nothing makes sense you can't even
[37:52] figure out what god is possibly doing in
[37:55] all of this
[37:56] it's backwards from what i think the
[37:57] word says it's different than what i
[37:59] know about the lord
[38:00] it's different than what he's ever done
[38:02] with me before
[38:05] amen but you know that he can deliver
[38:09] you you know that he's a healer
[38:11] you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that
[38:13] if he was here you would be healed
[38:15] so why is things happening the way
[38:17] they're happening
[38:19] because it's good for you that he didn't
[38:20] do it earlier
[38:22] it's good for me that he didn't come
[38:24] quicker
[38:25] amen praise god oh i hope that i can get
[38:29] to where this becomes a natural
[38:31] expression for
[38:32] me not not that i have to wrestle it out
[38:34] on
[38:35] nights of endless prayer before i
[38:37] finally settle down and say god's in
[38:38] control
[38:39] i want to get to the places the pride of
[38:41] jesus christ where whatever happens i
[38:43] can say praise god all as well
[38:45] because his word's not going to fail he
[38:47] knows where i'm at
[38:48] if he delays his coming if he lets it
[38:50] get worse it's all good
[38:53] amen i i'm i'm tired amen
[38:56] of carnal reasoning i'm tired of a
[38:58] fleshly mind
[38:59] i'm tired of natural education and
[39:01] understanding in science i'm tired of
[39:03] leaning on those props
[39:05] i want to be able to lean solidly on the
[39:07] word of god and say he will show up in
[39:09] time
[39:10] he will deliver according to his word he
[39:12] will do what he's promised to do and
[39:14] he'll do it at the perfect time
[39:18] amen that's where he's trying to get us
[39:20] that's where i want to be
[39:22] i want to be just like martha who says
[39:24] hey if you had been here he had not died
[39:26] but even now whatever you say
[39:27] it'll be amen
[39:31] i say god help us not to miss what
[39:32] you're doing
[39:34] verse 39 jesus comes to the grave and
[39:38] verse 39 jesus said take ye away the
[39:40] stone
[39:41] martha the sister of him that was dead
[39:43] said unto him lord by this time he
[39:45] stinketh
[39:46] for he's been dead four days
[39:49] now she just said if you had been here
[39:52] he not died
[39:54] and g but she said even now whatsoever
[39:58] you ask god will give it to you
[40:01] she she's a believer friend she's not an
[40:03] unbeliever
[40:06] but he's been dead for days i mean she's
[40:09] a believer
[40:10] but it's been four days she believes in
[40:13] christ and knows he's the son of god
[40:15] but it's been four days you see how
[40:18] quickly human reasoning slips in
[40:22] and none of us can fault her for that
[40:25] because we would all be in the same
[40:27] situation as martha was
[40:29] we can't condemn her for that we can't
[40:31] falter for that
[40:32] but but you can see how quickly human
[40:35] reasoning enters in
[40:37] and blinds us to what god is doing
[40:39] because
[40:40] it's not reasonable he's been dead four
[40:42] days he's going to stink
[40:44] don't roll the stone away what are you
[40:45] rolling the stone away for anyways
[40:47] you're going to let all the smell out
[40:50] he wasn't rolling the stone away that
[40:52] let the smell out he was rolling the
[40:53] stone away to let lazarus out
[40:56] he wasn't worried about the stink that
[40:58] was going to be fixed in a moment
[41:01] but she knew that corruption sets in
[41:03] after 72 hours
[41:04] corruption had already sat into lazar's
[41:07] body and decay had already begun
[41:09] but the prince of life was there to
[41:11] reverse the gay
[41:13] they had seen sick healed who weren't
[41:15] dead yet they had seen dead raised up
[41:17] who had just died
[41:18] amen but they hadn't seen somebody who
[41:20] began to decay
[41:21] already raised up to life
[41:24] but just because it was new was no
[41:27] reason to disbelieve
[41:30] just because he did something he'd never
[41:31] done before is not a reason to
[41:33] disbelieve
[41:35] and these are believers but reasoning is
[41:39] our enemy
[41:41] history is our enemy our human mind
[41:45] is the it's the enemy to our faith
[41:52] praise be to god let's read that again
[41:54] martha the sister of him that
[41:56] was dead saith unto him lord by this
[41:58] time he stinketh
[41:59] for he has been dead for days jesus said
[42:01] in her said i not
[42:03] unto thee you already missed it i
[42:06] already said ahead of time
[42:08] said i not unto thee that if thou would
[42:10] has believed thou should have see the
[42:11] glory of god
[42:13] then they took away the stone from the
[42:14] place where the dead was laid and jesus
[42:16] lifted up his eyes and said father
[42:18] i thank thee that thou has heard me i
[42:21] knew that
[42:22] thou hearest me always but because of
[42:25] the people which standeth by i
[42:27] said it that they may believe that thou
[42:29] has sent me
[42:30] now jesus is praying out loud but he
[42:32] didn't need to pray out loud
[42:35] lazarus would have come out of the
[42:36] ground if he would have whispered it or
[42:37] thought it
[42:40] but he said it for the benefit of the
[42:42] others so that they could hear what he
[42:43] had to say
[42:46] and when he thus spoke he cried with a
[42:48] loud voice lazarus
[42:50] come forth and he that was dead come
[42:53] forth bound hand and foot with grave
[42:55] clothes
[42:55] and his face was bound about with napkin
[42:58] jesus said to him
[42:59] loose him and let him go what did jesus
[43:02] show up for
[43:04] for this moment he showed up after
[43:07] the fourth day after he's been dead four
[43:10] days
[43:11] and he shows up to deliver him from his
[43:14] bondage
[43:14] to deliver him from his death to deliver
[43:17] him
[43:18] and set him free
[43:21] now let's look at verse 45 and 46.
[43:27] i read this today and i've read this
[43:30] over and over again
[43:31] but sometimes i read something that
[43:32] strikes me different and i started
[43:35] laughing i mean
[43:36] i read this and i was belly laughing in
[43:38] my office
[43:39] because it struck me different this time
[43:42] verse 45 then many of the jews which
[43:44] came to mary and had seen the things
[43:46] which jesus did
[43:47] believed on him but some of them went
[43:50] their way
[43:52] to the pharisees and told them the
[43:54] things jesus had done
[43:56] that's when i started laughing they were
[43:58] telling on him
[44:00] for raising the dead they were tattling
[44:03] to the pharisees
[44:04] to get jesus in trouble for raising the
[44:07] dead
[44:08] for losing the bound for preaching
[44:11] resurrection in life to him that had
[44:13] been dead for four days
[44:14] and because he lived and because they
[44:16] loosed him some believed
[44:18] but others ran to the pharisees to tell
[44:21] on him
[44:23] that struck me as so funny they're
[44:25] tattling on jesus
[44:26] for raising the dead
[44:28] [Applause]
[44:29] like it was a bad thing like he
[44:31] shouldn't have done it without their
[44:32] approval like
[44:33] like somehow he's wrong
[44:36] how was he wrong in what way did he do
[44:38] wrong but see they're so
[44:40] bound in their minds by religion and
[44:43] tradition
[44:43] amen when they seen him come and do
[44:45] something without the approval of the
[44:47] pharisees without the approval of the
[44:49] religion
[44:49] and he came and did it just by the
[44:51] leadership of god
[44:52] amen they looked at it and to them they
[44:55] they were disturbed by what they saw
[44:58] and they had to run and tattle
[45:01] why because they were bound by that
[45:03] jewish religion
[45:04] but jesus come to break the jewish
[45:07] religion
[45:10] i wrote down here in my notes jesus
[45:12] disrupted the religion of the jews
[45:14] but not the word of god jesus was a
[45:18] total
[45:18] disruption to the religious system he
[45:20] was a total disruption
[45:22] to the hold that they had and they kept
[45:24] the people bound by the law
[45:26] amen and they they put themselves in
[45:28] control of the people and they had a
[45:29] whole religious exercise
[45:31] that people had to be exercised by amen
[45:33] but jesus come
[45:34] to break that yoke and break that yoke
[45:37] and break that yoke
[45:38] to set the people free what he was doing
[45:40] for lazarus is what he intended to do
[45:42] for the entire jewish nation
[45:44] for the whole nation of israel for all
[45:46] of them he intended to come and set them
[45:48] free
[45:49] but they didn't want to go free they
[45:51] wanted to stay in the grave clothes
[45:53] because it was familiar because they
[45:57] were already accustomed to it
[45:58] because it had become normal they wanted
[46:00] to stay there
[46:02] instead of accepting the freedom that
[46:03] they could have but freedom meant
[46:05] walking a path they had never walked
[46:07] before freedom meant
[46:09] following the lord wherever he would
[46:11] lead and leaving the familiar and
[46:13] leaving
[46:13] the great heritage that we've had and
[46:15] walking in newness of life
[46:17] that was scary because they'd never seen
[46:19] it done
[46:22] but praise be to god amen he's loosed us
[46:25] from our grave clothes he's rolled away
[46:27] the stone
[46:28] amen there was there was a church that
[46:30] had been bound into nominational systems
[46:32] but
[46:32] but he came amen and in the fourth stage
[46:35] of the restoration of the bride tree he
[46:36] brought her back to life
[46:38] that's why he said what a resurrection
[46:39] that was what a resurrection this is
[46:42] because the son of man has come to bring
[46:45] resurrection power
[46:46] to those who are trapped in religion and
[46:48] denominationalism and bring him out
[46:50] and loose him from the grave clothes why
[46:53] because after 2 000 years it stinks
[46:57] it's rotten it's failed everything man
[47:00] has done to make a religious system is
[47:02] absolutely rotten
[47:04] amen and god is not worried about the
[47:06] smell that's in there because he's going
[47:08] to bring us
[47:08] out of there there's corruption in
[47:10] religion there's corruption and
[47:12] denomination
[47:13] amen but he's bringing us out without
[47:15] corruption
[47:17] and he says loosen loosen from the grave
[47:20] close
[47:21] set him free you would have thought that
[47:24] every jew every pharisee sadducee herod
[47:29] every jew would run and say praise god i
[47:31] want to serve a living god
[47:33] i want to serve a god that raises the
[47:35] dead after four days
[47:37] i want to serve a god like that but they
[47:39] did and they ran to the pharisees to
[47:40] tell on jesus
[47:42] do you know what that man did he's done
[47:44] raise the dead
[47:47] we can't let that continue
[47:52] we don't want somebody to raise people
[47:54] from the dead
[47:56] and loose them from their grave clothes
[47:59] what's going to happen to us
[48:01] if we let that continue
[48:04] oh my goodness spirits don't die
[48:08] they just continue right on unfolding
[48:11] and unfolding and unfolding
[48:13] you get a people that'll take god at his
[48:15] word and believe god at his word and
[48:16] stand on the word of god
[48:17] somebody can't wait to go tell somebody
[48:20] tattle it on them tell on them
[48:21] and say can you believe what they're
[48:22] doing they're taking a stand on the word
[48:24] of god and they're believing god
[48:28] we can't let this stand my goodness why
[48:30] not
[48:31] let people believe brother branham said
[48:33] if i didn't have enough faith to make
[48:35] the word of god work i sure wouldn't
[48:36] stand in the way of somebody else who
[48:38] had enough faith to make it work
[48:40] i'd encourage him if you've got enough
[48:42] faith to get out of the boat and you
[48:43] heard the lord bid you come
[48:44] walk i want to see you walk i want to
[48:47] see somebody walk on water
[48:49] i want to see somebody free from glade
[48:51] growth i want to see somebody get healed
[48:53] i want to see somebody to be delivered
[48:55] i want to see somebody fly higher than
[48:57] anybody's ever flown in the word before
[49:00] i don't want to say this is the limit to
[49:01] flying high because we've never been
[49:03] past here and if you go past here i'm
[49:05] going to tell the pharisees on you
[49:09] don't tattle on me for spreading my
[49:12] wings and flying
[49:14] don't tattle amen just fly with me
[49:17] friends just try it once
[49:18] it's good like we were saying sunday
[49:22] peter got out of the boat none of the
[49:24] rest of them got out of the boat
[49:26] but the boat wasn't safer than the water
[49:31] the perception was the boat was the safe
[49:34] place
[49:35] but they had already lost faith in the
[49:36] boat before jesus came walking on the
[49:38] water
[49:39] but when jesus come walking in the water
[49:41] it was so different than anything
[49:43] they've ever seen before
[49:44] they decided to stay with the boat that
[49:45] they already knew wasn't working
[49:50] my goodness friends we human beings are
[49:53] pathetic creatures
[49:55] and i say we because i'm a pathetic
[49:57] creature
[49:58] as a human being i'm worthless and i'm
[50:00] miserable and i'm no good
[50:02] and i'm never going to get it right but
[50:03] as a seed gene of god i'm predestinated
[50:06] to believe that word
[50:07] and if i don't get it right the first
[50:08] time i'll try the second time and if not
[50:10] the second the third time but there's
[50:12] coming a time that i'm going to fully
[50:13] believe
[50:14] every word and it's going to manifest
[50:16] completely in this body of flesh
[50:18] and if i fail a thousand times it
[50:20] doesn't matter because there's going to
[50:22] be a time that it's going to work
[50:24] so don't condemn me for it failing time
[50:27] after time after time
[50:28] amen you should be encouraging me to try
[50:30] it again
[50:32] i encourage you to try it again i mean i
[50:34] want to see
[50:35] somebody that stinks
[50:38] get out of the grave and come walking
[50:40] forth and jesus said
[50:42] unbind him amen i want to help unwrap
[50:44] the bindings
[50:46] i want to pull the napkin off of his
[50:47] face and say god bless you brother
[50:49] you smell good to me
[50:55] somebody can run and tattle to the
[50:57] religious leaders and to the pharisees
[51:00] but i want to help unwind disclose
[51:03] and i want to say man let's see that
[51:05] again let's do that again
[51:06] where's the next one
[51:10] jesus bids peter he comes walking on the
[51:13] water
[51:14] brother bam says it was scary to them
[51:17] it looked spiritual spooky
[51:21] why they've never seen anybody walk on
[51:22] the water before
[51:25] spooky but he calls out
[51:28] it is i be of good cheer
[51:31] be not afraid whenever we get in trouble
[51:37] and we know the boat's not going to work
[51:39] anymore the place we're in isn't working
[51:42] the doctor has failed our job has failed
[51:45] our money has failed
[51:46] when we get in whatever boat we're
[51:48] riding in when it's failed when it's
[51:49] come
[51:50] to the end don't be scared when god
[51:52] starts to do something he's never done
[51:54] before
[51:55] and when he starts to show up in such a
[51:57] unique way that you've never seen it
[51:59] and i've never seen anybody delivered
[52:01] this way don't be afraid of that
[52:03] as long as you can hear him say it is i
[52:06] be of courage be not afraid
[52:10] and peter has something in him that says
[52:13] wherever he is that's where i want to be
[52:17] oh i encourage you all to be like that
[52:20] amen
[52:20] but make sure you don't go
[52:22] presumptuously
[52:24] make sure you wait for him to say come
[52:26] on
[52:27] make sure we follow the leadership of
[52:29] the lord
[52:32] he said come peter goes out walking on
[52:34] the water
[52:36] what was holding him up
[52:40] faith nothing but
[52:44] faith because when he looked around at
[52:47] the waves and began to doubt
[52:50] he sank proving that the molecules
[52:53] didn't change in the water
[52:56] it was faith he was walking on
[52:59] because when he doubted it could no
[53:01] longer hold him up
[53:03] and he began to sink and god had to
[53:04] rescue him
[53:07] but peter made it further by faith
[53:10] than any of the other disciples had ever
[53:12] made
[53:15] so why criticize peter for failing
[53:18] why point a finger at him and tell him
[53:20] you failed and it didn't work and you
[53:22] tried
[53:22] and you proved that it doesn't work all
[53:24] he proved was it works
[53:27] it works he failed so what he walked on
[53:30] the water
[53:32] don't condemn him for the failure amen
[53:35] bless him encourage him amen maybe next
[53:37] time he'll make it a little further
[53:39] maybe next time a little further it
[53:40] doesn't matter how many times he goes
[53:42] under
[53:42] the fact that he was able to walk on the
[53:44] water is the impressive thing to me
[53:46] the fact that somebody is able to take
[53:47] god at his word and believe it i don't
[53:49] care if it fails from time to time
[53:51] i don't care if they look around in the
[53:52] storms in doubt and god has to rescue
[53:54] them
[53:54] but hey if you've ever worked for you do
[53:56] it again
[53:58] and don't be afraid to do it the next
[54:00] time don't be afraid of something
[54:01] unusual or something different
[54:03] amen just hear his voice calling and say
[54:05] can i come
[54:06] and when he says come just
[54:09] we can't be afraid we can't be so tied
[54:12] up
[54:13] amen in religion amen that we can't move
[54:15] forward
[54:16] when god calls us to move forward and we
[54:19] may think we're free from that but we're
[54:20] not free from that
[54:22] he's breaking us free from that bit by
[54:24] bit day by day
[54:25] he's breaking us from that and i say god
[54:28] break it from me
[54:29] i don't want religion i don't want a
[54:31] system i don't want my own system and my
[54:33] own religion
[54:33] i just want the reality of your word in
[54:35] my life
[54:37] i got it's got to be real amen
[54:40] but if it's going to be real like the
[54:42] bible was real if it's going to be real
[54:43] like the book of acts was real
[54:45] we better get used to hearing this voice
[54:47] and doing what nobody else is doing
[54:50] because that's how the book of acts was
[54:51] that's how the entire bible was
[54:53] amen they were always doing something
[54:55] they had never done before
[54:56] what about the woman who touched the
[54:58] hymn of his garment to be healed
[55:00] what bible verse was she reading what
[55:02] story out of the scriptures encouraged
[55:04] her to do that
[55:07] what was it i mean where did she get
[55:09] that idea it was
[55:10] inspiration she was inspired and she
[55:13] knew within herself
[55:14] if i can only touch the hem of his
[55:16] garment i will beat every
[55:18] every made every bit whole so she
[55:20] crawled through the crowd and she pushed
[55:22] her way through and brother ben said she
[55:23] got on her hands and knees
[55:25] and weaved her way through and just
[55:26] touched him of his garment
[55:28] and she was instantly healed
[55:30] [Applause]
[55:32] based off what bible verse
[55:35] it was an inspiration that came to her
[55:38] from god
[55:38] and she had enough of something in her
[55:41] to move on that inspiration
[55:43] and it worked
[55:46] jesus he comes to a meal
[55:50] and a woman brings an alabaster box and
[55:53] she breaks the box of very precious
[55:55] ointment and begins to anoint
[55:56] him and anoint his feet and wipe his
[55:58] feet with her hairs
[55:59] and the disciples look at that and they
[56:01] say what a waste why
[56:03] why did you pour the whole thing out
[56:06] because you realize to anoint somebody
[56:08] doesn't take a whole box
[56:09] of precious ointment it only takes a
[56:11] little bit i mean a box of precious
[56:13] ointment could anoint thousands
[56:16] maybe 500 maybe 1500 i don't know
[56:20] but it could anoint more than one person
[56:24] so it looked like an absolute waste when
[56:26] she broke it and poured it all out
[56:28] and they begin to criticize the woman
[56:30] for doing that
[56:32] but jesus says don't say leave her alone
[56:36] she is anointing me for my burial
[56:42] she's anointing me for my burial none of
[56:45] you understand what she's doing
[56:48] and she may not even understand what
[56:50] she's doing
[56:51] but there's some force some power some
[56:54] anointing
[56:55] moving her perfectly in the will of god
[56:58] without a bible verse without jesus
[57:01] himself telling her to do it
[57:02] that god was anointing and moving upon
[57:05] this woman and she was
[57:06] in the flow of the word she was moving
[57:09] in step with the word
[57:10] and she broke she may not have
[57:12] understood clearly why
[57:13] but something compelled her to pour out
[57:16] the oil amen
[57:17] and he says she's anointing me for my
[57:19] burial
[57:21] why because they buried him quickly and
[57:24] on the sabbath day
[57:26] they put together all the spices to
[57:27] anoint his body but he rose before the
[57:30] women ever put it on him this is the
[57:31] woman that anointed him for burial
[57:33] because the normal process was going to
[57:35] be broken
[57:37] did she know it probably not the
[57:39] disciples certainly knew it but jesus
[57:41] christ knew why she was anointing his
[57:43] feet
[57:43] and it was a perfect worship why because
[57:46] it was a worship
[57:47] done by revelation that's what made it a
[57:51] perfect worship
[57:52] she did it by inspiration she did it by
[57:54] revelation
[57:56] i've been praying i said god let me live
[57:58] by revelation amen
[58:00] not so much form and formalism and you
[58:03] know i gotta
[58:03] have an hour of prayer time and read a
[58:05] chapter a day i don't mind praying an
[58:08] hour a day and i don't mind reading a
[58:09] chapter a day
[58:10] but i don't want formalism i want the
[58:12] life
[58:14] and i don't want to be satisfied that i
[58:16] checked all my boxes on religious duty
[58:18] that day
[58:18] and somehow everything's okay with me i
[58:21] want to be
[58:21] okay with me if i check none of the
[58:23] boxes
[58:25] why because i'm born again by the spirit
[58:27] of god by a predestinated seed of god
[58:29] moved and anointed by the spirit of god
[58:32] to move and get in action when he calls
[58:34] me into action
[58:35] not a performance but an action amen an
[58:38] action by the move of the holy ghost
[58:41] it's got to be reality we're in the day
[58:43] where it's got to be
[58:44] nothing but what was written in this
[58:45] bible the same kind of life the same
[58:47] kind of manifestation
[58:48] the same kind of moving by inspiration
[58:52] it'll never leave the word friends don't
[58:54] worry about that the spirit of god will
[58:55] never leave the word of god
[58:58] it'll never go beyond the word of god
[59:00] but it might do something you didn't
[59:02] expect him to do
[59:03] and he might do it in a way you never
[59:05] anticipated and it might be something
[59:06] you've never seen done before
[59:09] praise god anyhow
[59:12] see jesus was the master at breaking
[59:14] religion
[59:17] remember when he and his disciples were
[59:18] walking through the corn
[59:20] and they began to pluck ears and eat
[59:21] them
[59:24] i could just see him walking through and
[59:26] pulling a head of barley off
[59:29] rolling it around blowing the chaff and
[59:31] tossing the grain in their mouth
[59:33] walking along talking with jesus and
[59:35] going through this whole process
[59:37] and the pharisee says how come you let
[59:40] them pluck corn on the sabbath day
[59:44] what are you doing and jesus has to
[59:47] educate them in the law
[59:52] he wasn't going to get sucked into their
[59:53] trap of religion
[59:55] he was going to get sucked into their
[59:56] understanding of the sabbath and the
[59:58] sabbath laws
[59:59] all he says is didn't you read when
[1:00:02] david was hungry
[1:00:03] how he went into where the priest was
[1:00:05] and he ate the show bread that was only
[1:00:06] for the priest to eat
[1:00:07] and he gave to those that were with him
[1:00:08] and they ate too
[1:00:11] the question the the the question
[1:00:14] without being asked is
[1:00:15] how could he do that and still be
[1:00:18] righteous with god
[1:00:20] because that was for the priest only
[1:00:21] only the priest could eat the show bread
[1:00:23] but david takes it
[1:00:24] why because david was hungry and he was
[1:00:28] faint and he needed to live
[1:00:30] and the law amen god's word was not to
[1:00:33] kill man god's word was to move
[1:00:35] it was to move god it was to move man
[1:00:38] towards god
[1:00:41] and they would rather use the law to let
[1:00:43] a man starve to death with showbread
[1:00:44] sitting on the table
[1:00:48] that's what religion does to man
[1:00:51] would rather you die than touch that
[1:00:54] bread that's right there in front of
[1:00:56] you
[1:00:59] religion is dangerous
[1:01:03] and now his disciples are hungry
[1:01:06] they've been laboring they've been
[1:01:07] working with him in the ministry and
[1:01:09] they're walking through
[1:01:10] the field and they're plucking amen
[1:01:12] which is according to the law
[1:01:14] those as there's a traveler passing by
[1:01:16] in a stranger he's allowed the pluck
[1:01:18] what he can eat as he moves through
[1:01:20] not gather but pluck and eat they're not
[1:01:23] leaving the
[1:01:24] law because why
[1:01:27] they're walking with the word you think
[1:01:30] jesus is going to let them do something
[1:01:32] contrary to god's word
[1:01:35] but it might be different than their
[1:01:36] understanding of the word
[1:01:39] but it wasn't contrary to the word and
[1:01:42] he asked them what about david
[1:01:44] well of course they can't answer that
[1:01:46] because you can't make david
[1:01:48] unrighteous so he says
[1:01:52] don't you even know man was not made for
[1:01:55] the sabbath
[1:01:57] man is not the servant of the sabbath
[1:01:59] but god gave sad the sabbath for man
[1:02:02] the sabbath was instituted so man could
[1:02:04] rest not so man would become the slave
[1:02:07] of the sabbath
[1:02:09] but because of religion they reversed
[1:02:12] the original purpose that god had made a
[1:02:13] sabbath for
[1:02:15] and instead of giving a man rest and
[1:02:16] refreshment and strength
[1:02:18] they used it they would have used it to
[1:02:21] take away
[1:02:21] strength and refreshing from the
[1:02:23] disciples
[1:02:26] oh let jesus christ break religion
[1:02:30] now just god just break it away from me
[1:02:33] and let me just follow after you let me
[1:02:36] see your word the way you intended it to
[1:02:38] be seen
[1:02:40] every every word every every ordinance
[1:02:43] every
[1:02:44] article every bit of the word let me see
[1:02:46] it the way you intended it to be seen
[1:02:49] not the way man through his mind
[1:02:51] interprets the word but the way you
[1:02:52] intended it to be
[1:02:56] praise god
[1:03:00] when jesus had a multitude follow him
[1:03:03] out to the wilderness
[1:03:05] he asked the disciples he says hey um
[1:03:08] we're going to get bread that we can
[1:03:09] feed them
[1:03:12] well i mean obviously there's no store
[1:03:15] there's nothing with them philip asks i
[1:03:17] mean a logical question
[1:03:19] i mean he says 200 penny worth of bread
[1:03:21] it will suffice where would we get that
[1:03:24] jesus is trying to get his disciples to
[1:03:26] move away from reasoning
[1:03:31] move away from reasoning and he says
[1:03:34] he said this to prove them because he
[1:03:36] already knew what he would do
[1:03:38] see jesus is never without a plan
[1:03:44] yeah several weeks ago we talked about
[1:03:45] getting up to the red sea
[1:03:47] brother bam says he's not a bad general
[1:03:51] he just looked like a bad general
[1:03:54] but really and looking like a bad
[1:03:56] general proved he was the best general
[1:03:58] of
[1:03:58] all because pharaoh the general of his
[1:04:01] army
[1:04:01] says oh they've entangled themselves in
[1:04:03] the wilderness now they're trapped
[1:04:05] now i'm going to go wipe them out
[1:04:07] because he thought he was a smart duck
[1:04:08] and he thought
[1:04:09] hey the pillar of fire was a bad general
[1:04:11] not realizing that the pillar of fire
[1:04:13] had outsmarted him again
[1:04:16] and god will make things look bad
[1:04:18] because what is he doing he's
[1:04:19] outsmarting satan
[1:04:21] again and outsmarting him again and
[1:04:23] again and again and again and again
[1:04:25] and he does it through weakness and he
[1:04:26] does it through humility and he does it
[1:04:28] through inability
[1:04:29] and he does it when you hit a dead-end
[1:04:31] road and there's no place to go
[1:04:32] he opens up a way where there seems to
[1:04:34] be no way
[1:04:35] [Music]
[1:04:36] why because he's the master at war
[1:04:41] he's the master general so he calls him
[1:04:44] and
[1:04:44] says feed them he already knew what he
[1:04:46] was going to do he always has a plan
[1:04:48] hey rest assured he always has a plan
[1:04:52] no matter what happens he's always got a
[1:04:54] plan
[1:04:57] what what are you going to do 200 penny
[1:05:00] worth it's not sufficient
[1:05:02] then andrew as a genius
[1:05:06] he says well we've got some fishes and
[1:05:09] loaves
[1:05:11] but then he says but what are these
[1:05:13] amongst so many
[1:05:16] it was reasoning and i don't blame him
[1:05:20] and i'm not mad at him for it and i
[1:05:21] don't think he's a bad believer
[1:05:24] but you realize it was reasoning he was
[1:05:26] limited in his thinking by reasoning
[1:05:30] philip was limited in his thinking by
[1:05:32] reasoning
[1:05:33] but he says what are these among so many
[1:05:36] and jesus says
[1:05:37] that's enough make them sit down
[1:05:41] bring them to me everything's going to
[1:05:43] be just fine
[1:05:44] and you begin to break and break and
[1:05:47] break
[1:05:48] and break
[1:05:52] he lets us get in these positions to
[1:05:54] break our reasoning
[1:05:57] he lets us get into hopeless places to
[1:06:00] break us away from human reasoning
[1:06:04] oh like i said i wish that there was a
[1:06:07] key that i could stick in my ear and
[1:06:08] turn
[1:06:09] and shut off reasoning i wish i had the
[1:06:12] ability to shut off my own thinking
[1:06:14] and to shut off reasoning amen and just
[1:06:16] turn it off so i can just hear god's
[1:06:18] voice only and none other
[1:06:20] that's all i want but god is learning to
[1:06:23] us to fight that reasoning and to push
[1:06:25] it back
[1:06:25] that's the thing we have to overcome
[1:06:27] he's not going to shut it off he's going
[1:06:29] to give us his word he's going to move
[1:06:30] on us by the spirit and we've got to
[1:06:32] we've got to take it and move forward
[1:06:37] praise god let's
[1:06:41] let's turn to the book of job i want to
[1:06:44] switch gears and look at job for just a
[1:06:46] few minutes
[1:06:58] job chapter 1. i want to read this quote
[1:07:01] first
[1:07:05] 1963 awakening jesus
[1:07:08] could you imagine job enjoying being
[1:07:10] broke out with boils
[1:07:12] no i can't imagine him enjoying that
[1:07:15] could you imagine joe being broke out
[1:07:17] with boils and all these things gone
[1:07:19] losing all of his wealth and his
[1:07:21] children and everything it wasn't very
[1:07:23] easy
[1:07:23] but god was proving to satan that he had
[1:07:25] somebody he could put confidence in
[1:07:30] maybe he's trying to do the same thing
[1:07:31] in your case and the rest of you
[1:07:33] oh they'll forsake you they'll oh no job
[1:07:36] they couldn't make job do that no sir
[1:07:38] he's only trying to prove them remember
[1:07:40] in a few minutes he said oh you have
[1:07:42] little faith couldn't you understand
[1:07:43] about breaking the bread and feeding
[1:07:45] five thousand
[1:07:46] don't you know i'm the same jehovah that
[1:07:47] fed them for 40 years out in the
[1:07:49] wilderness
[1:07:49] out of ovens out of heaven when i poured
[1:07:51] it out every night
[1:07:53] what are you scared about don't you know
[1:07:55] i dried up the red sea one day
[1:07:56] don't you know i opened the earth and
[1:07:58] swallowed the unbeliever one day i
[1:08:00] measured the earth and spurred it off
[1:08:01] out in space yonder
[1:08:02] and he's in the ship now that's not
[1:08:04] mythical that's the truth
[1:08:07] same now he tries to prove us and see
[1:08:10] where we'll stand or not
[1:08:12] take a revival away start an argument in
[1:08:15] the church
[1:08:15] just to see what you'll do
[1:08:19] god would do that god would take a
[1:08:22] revival away
[1:08:23] i thought god only gave revival i didn't
[1:08:25] know god was in the habit of taking them
[1:08:27] away
[1:08:29] i thought the devil took it away and god
[1:08:30] gave it
[1:08:32] guess what god can give a revival
[1:08:36] and satan can give a revival
[1:08:40] it depends on what the revival's about
[1:08:42] that's right
[1:08:44] hey amen amen
[1:08:47] we've got to have we've got to have the
[1:08:49] mind of christ we've got to be led by
[1:08:51] the spirit of god
[1:08:52] amen just because something sweeps
[1:08:54] through god god can give a revival but
[1:08:55] satan can give a revival
[1:08:58] but i only want the one god gives can
[1:09:00] god take away a revival
[1:09:02] yep god can take away a revival so he
[1:09:05] said
[1:09:05] he'll take away a revival start an
[1:09:08] argument in the church
[1:09:14] just to see what you'll do that's why
[1:09:18] when things happen don't jump on it so
[1:09:20] quick
[1:09:22] when things begin to and there's a
[1:09:24] murmur or you hear a complaint or one
[1:09:26] person's grumbling in another
[1:09:28] don't jump on it so quick just hold
[1:09:30] steady maybe god's just doing a little
[1:09:32] testing
[1:09:33] amen to see amen to see if he can mature
[1:09:36] as believers and see
[1:09:38] where the character is amen maybe he'll
[1:09:40] allow a little murmur a little complain
[1:09:43] a little rumor to spread a little hey
[1:09:45] did you hear
[1:09:46] amen don't jump on that so quick and
[1:09:48] don't repeat it so fast
[1:09:50] maybe just watch that thing and say hey
[1:09:53] i
[1:09:53] hey i've seen this before this isn't my
[1:09:56] first time around the horn
[1:09:57] i jumped on one one time and it let me
[1:09:59] look like a fool
[1:10:02] sometimes god will let that happen just
[1:10:04] to see what you'll do
[1:10:10] turn satan loose among you
[1:10:14] not god he wouldn't turn satan loose
[1:10:17] among you
[1:10:18] have you ever read the bible
[1:10:22] you think you think god didn't know the
[1:10:24] serpent was in the garden
[1:10:26] you think that escaped his knowledge
[1:10:30] you think you think that he never heard
[1:10:32] the conversation he had with eve
[1:10:36] praise be to god turn saint louis among
[1:10:39] you see
[1:10:39] to see how you'll stand let him strike
[1:10:42] you with something
[1:10:43] see what kind of stand you'll take job
[1:10:44] said though he slayed me
[1:10:46] yet i'll trust him amen amen that's it
[1:10:50] let's look at job chapter six or chapter
[1:10:53] one sorry verse six
[1:10:55] job chapter one verse six
[1:10:58] now there was a day when the sons of god
[1:11:00] came to present themselves before the
[1:11:01] lord and satan came also among them
[1:11:04] and the lord said unto satan whence
[1:11:06] cometh thou then satan answered the lord
[1:11:08] and said from going to and fro in the
[1:11:09] earth and from walking up and down in it
[1:11:12] and the lord said unto satan has thou
[1:11:13] considered my servant job
[1:11:16] thank you lord amen
[1:11:20] you realize satan was not mentioning job
[1:11:23] to god
[1:11:26] job was safe he had his home
[1:11:30] his children his business his reputation
[1:11:34] everything was fine with job and satan
[1:11:37] was not accusing job to god
[1:11:39] satan wasn't asking to try him satan
[1:11:42] wasn't even mentioning his name
[1:11:45] it was god who mentioned job to satan
[1:11:51] praise me to god he said the lord said
[1:11:54] unto satan has thou considered my
[1:11:56] servant job there is none
[1:11:57] like him in the earth a perfect and
[1:12:00] upright man
[1:12:01] one that feareth god and askew with evil
[1:12:04] then satan answered the lord and said
[1:12:06] the job fear god for not
[1:12:08] has not thou made a hedge about him and
[1:12:10] about his house and about all that he
[1:12:12] hath on every side
[1:12:13] thou has blessed the work of his hands
[1:12:15] and his substances increased in the land
[1:12:17] but put forth thine hand now and touch
[1:12:20] all that he hath
[1:12:21] and he will curse thee to thy face and
[1:12:23] the lord said unto satan behold
[1:12:25] all that he hath is in thy power only
[1:12:27] upon himself put not forth thine hand
[1:12:30] so satan went forth from the presence of
[1:12:32] the lord
[1:12:34] do you realize when he says does he
[1:12:36] serve you for not you've hedged him
[1:12:37] about and protected him and everything's
[1:12:39] safe
[1:12:39] you realize that's how job wanted it
[1:12:43] hedged about protected
[1:12:46] on a hedge that god put around me that's
[1:12:49] where job wanted to be
[1:12:51] that's where i want to be where do you
[1:12:53] want to be do you want to be hedged in
[1:12:54] or unhedged amen
[1:12:56] he's hedged in does he not fear you for
[1:12:57] nothing he's hedged in amen but you
[1:12:59] remove the hedge and let me touch him
[1:13:01] amen let me take all that he has
[1:13:03] and he'll curse you and god said okay
[1:13:05] i'll take the hedge down
[1:13:07] so that you can get to him oh man
[1:13:13] it was a good thing job wasn't standing
[1:13:15] there during this conversation
[1:13:18] i could just see him over in the corner
[1:13:20] excuse me
[1:13:22] i have an objection your honor
[1:13:25] but god designed it this way why he
[1:13:28] wanted to prove job to satan
[1:13:31] this this contest was between god and
[1:13:34] satan
[1:13:34] amen job was just the battlefield but
[1:13:37] the battle was between god and satan
[1:13:40] he gets over here uh let's go down and
[1:13:43] read verse 20 in the same chapter
[1:13:45] then job arose he lost everything i mean
[1:13:47] he lost everything even his children all
[1:13:49] died
[1:13:51] and job arose and ran his mantle and
[1:13:53] shaved his head and fell down upon the
[1:13:55] ground and worshiped and said naked i
[1:13:57] came into my
[1:13:58] i came of my mother's womb and naked
[1:14:00] shall i return thither
[1:14:01] the lord gave and the lord hath taken
[1:14:03] away blessed be the name of the lord
[1:14:05] and all this job said not nor charged
[1:14:08] god
[1:14:09] foolishly i say god help me
[1:14:12] that's the way i want to live my life
[1:14:14] help me learn
[1:14:16] let's look over here at chapter 2 verse
[1:14:19] 1.
[1:14:20] again there was a day when the sons of
[1:14:22] god came to present themselves before
[1:14:24] the lord
[1:14:25] and satan came also among them to
[1:14:26] present himself before the lord
[1:14:28] and the lord said unto saint from whence
[1:14:30] cometh thou and satan answered the lord
[1:14:32] and said from going to and fro in the
[1:14:34] earth and from walking up and down in
[1:14:35] him
[1:14:36] and the lord said unto satan hast thou
[1:14:38] considered my servant job
[1:14:40] he just passed the test so his reward
[1:14:44] another one see nothing works the way we
[1:14:48] think
[1:14:49] we always think i pass the test i get
[1:14:51] the merit badge i've got a trophy now
[1:14:53] everything's fine
[1:14:54] i proved i was a son of god and god's
[1:14:57] not gonna let anything else bad happen
[1:14:58] to me but that's not the way it ever
[1:15:00] works it's never worked that way
[1:15:01] don't expect it to ever work that way
[1:15:03] our expectation should be that god wants
[1:15:05] to prove to satan as bride is not like
[1:15:07] eve
[1:15:08] that she'll not fail by the word amen if
[1:15:10] god that's god's desire in this evil age
[1:15:13] and satan seemed to prove to satan
[1:15:15] that she's not like eve then god is
[1:15:17] going to prove to satan she's not like
[1:15:19] eve
[1:15:19] it'll prove it today and he'll prove it
[1:15:21] tomorrow he'll prove it the next day
[1:15:23] and the week after that and the next
[1:15:25] month because that's what he wants to do
[1:15:28] in this evil age is to prove to satan
[1:15:30] she is not like eve
[1:15:32] and if that's god's purpose then we
[1:15:34] better get with the program because
[1:15:36] that's the program
[1:15:38] and if that's the program he'll allow
[1:15:40] one thing to strike
[1:15:41] after another after another to prove to
[1:15:44] satan she is not like eve
[1:15:46] so let's not act like eve and fall back
[1:15:48] on reasoning
[1:15:51] amen hold your place here let's go back
[1:15:54] to genesis
[1:15:56] chapter 3.
[1:16:02] let's just come fresh i just got to hit
[1:16:04] it right now
[1:16:10] chapter 3 this is the temptation of eve
[1:16:15] verse 4 and the serpent said unto the
[1:16:16] woman you shall not surely die
[1:16:19] for god does know that in the day you
[1:16:20] eat thereof then your eyes shall be open
[1:16:22] and you shall be as gods knowing good
[1:16:24] and evil
[1:16:25] and when the woman saw the tree was good
[1:16:27] for food
[1:16:28] it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree
[1:16:31] to be desired to make one wise
[1:16:33] she took the fruit thereof and did eat
[1:16:35] and gave also into her husband with her
[1:16:37] and he did eat i want to look at this
[1:16:40] verse six carefully
[1:16:42] when the woman saw the tree was good for
[1:16:44] food
[1:16:46] it was pleasant to the eyes tree to be
[1:16:49] desired to make one wise
[1:16:50] she took you realize
[1:16:54] from eve's vantage point with human
[1:16:57] reasoning
[1:16:58] when she looked at the tree of good and
[1:17:00] evil now you have to realize it's good
[1:17:01] and evil
[1:17:03] and if god calls it good there's good
[1:17:05] there
[1:17:06] i mean really good god didn't call it's
[1:17:08] not fake good
[1:17:10] if god said it's good it's good if he
[1:17:12] said it's evil it's evil so it's a
[1:17:13] mixtree of mixed good and evil but
[1:17:16] the serpent when he got her to look at
[1:17:18] it and she began to look at it
[1:17:19] she could only see the good
[1:17:24] and the good was really good do we
[1:17:27] understand that
[1:17:28] she wasn't looking at evil there was
[1:17:30] good there but there was also evil
[1:17:33] it was mixed together and when she
[1:17:35] looked at this she said it was pleasant
[1:17:36] to the eyes
[1:17:37] good for food a tree to make one wise
[1:17:40] and she took an eight but god had said
[1:17:44] don't eat it so what did she fall back
[1:17:47] on
[1:17:48] was it the word of god or reasoning
[1:17:52] she trusted her eyesight she trusted her
[1:17:55] reasoning
[1:17:56] she trusted her understanding she
[1:17:58] trusted her intellect
[1:17:59] and she took a good hard look at that
[1:18:01] tree and she inspected that tree
[1:18:03] and she saw that the tree was good for
[1:18:05] food
[1:18:06] and it was a desirable tree and to make
[1:18:09] one wise
[1:18:10] and she looked at it and with her
[1:18:11] reasoning and her understanding
[1:18:13] and her intellect she couldn't see a
[1:18:16] problem and when she couldn't see a
[1:18:17] problem
[1:18:18] she left the word of god trusting in her
[1:18:20] reasoning
[1:18:21] and partook of the tree this bride won't
[1:18:25] do that
[1:18:26] there's coming a time where this bride
[1:18:28] won't do that any longer i should say it
[1:18:30] that way
[1:18:31] amen we failed by that and failed by
[1:18:33] that but there's coming a time that this
[1:18:35] bride is going to be so removed from
[1:18:37] reasoning
[1:18:37] from her eyes from her intellect from
[1:18:39] her ears from the reasoning and
[1:18:41] understanding of everyone around her to
[1:18:42] where she looks at it and you can say
[1:18:44] yeah it looks good but the word says
[1:18:47] tell me what's wrong with that i can't
[1:18:49] see anything wrong the way you explain
[1:18:50] it makes sense to me
[1:18:51] i understand what you're saying it's
[1:18:53] very reasonable but the word says
[1:18:55] [Applause]
[1:18:57] we've got to get to that place where
[1:18:59] it's what the word says but this and
[1:19:00] this and
[1:19:01] you understand this and if you take it
[1:19:03] from this angle but the prophet of god
[1:19:05] told us thus saith the lord dust us
[1:19:07] and us i i understand and i don't fault
[1:19:09] you for going that way
[1:19:10] but i can't go that way because i don't
[1:19:13] want to cross this line of the word
[1:19:16] i'm standing on the word and if this is
[1:19:18] what the prophet said thus saith the
[1:19:19] lord i'm standing on it because he was a
[1:19:21] vindicated prophet
[1:19:23] yes what you say sounds good what you
[1:19:26] say looks good
[1:19:26] i agree with you i don't i can't explain
[1:19:29] to you anything bad about it
[1:19:32] but god said and i'm staying with what
[1:19:36] god said
[1:19:38] oh i'm a fool for christ
[1:19:42] which is the anointing the word whose
[1:19:44] full are you
[1:19:46] brother i say got to be a fool for
[1:19:47] somebody might as well be a fool for the
[1:19:49] world
[1:19:50] they won't understand you can't explain
[1:19:52] it amen you can't get anybody else to
[1:19:54] understand it
[1:19:55] but the word says and i'm standing on
[1:19:56] the word because i know it won't fail
[1:19:59] and sometimes when you stand on the word
[1:20:01] it looks like
[1:20:02] it fails you realize
[1:20:05] job did nothing wrong
[1:20:10] job was standing on the word the
[1:20:12] revealed word for his day
[1:20:13] was a sacrifice an atonement a covering
[1:20:16] for his sin
[1:20:17] and he stood completely amen on that
[1:20:20] word justified by his faith in the word
[1:20:22] for his hour
[1:20:24] and he knew that it worked and he
[1:20:25] believed in it he never doubted that
[1:20:27] word
[1:20:28] and god said he's perfect and there's
[1:20:31] none like him on the earth
[1:20:33] but what did his perfection get him
[1:20:39] what did his standing on the word amount
[1:20:41] to what did his perfect life come to
[1:20:44] when god himself could stand before
[1:20:46] satan and god who never lies
[1:20:48] could say he's perfect there's nothing
[1:20:51] wrong with him there's nothing
[1:20:52] like him what did all of that perfection
[1:20:54] and all that perfect life and all that
[1:20:55] faith did him
[1:20:56] it got him death for all of his children
[1:20:59] seven sons and three daughters
[1:21:02] it it got him the loss of all of his
[1:21:05] material goods
[1:21:07] it got him the contention of his wife
[1:21:09] and eventually got him broke out with
[1:21:10] boils from the soles of his feet to the
[1:21:12] top of his head
[1:21:13] that's what a perfect life got him you
[1:21:16] realize
[1:21:17] we're living the life for god not for
[1:21:19] our material gain and not for our
[1:21:21] benefit
[1:21:22] but because we love him amen because we
[1:21:24] want to serve him
[1:21:25] because we've been put on this earth to
[1:21:27] be for his purpose
[1:21:29] to manifest his life and if he's going
[1:21:31] to manifest his life
[1:21:32] through first covering me in boils then
[1:21:34] that's exactly what it's got to be
[1:21:36] friends what was the reward
[1:21:40] of his living the life and believing the
[1:21:42] word it was a trial like none other had
[1:21:45] gone through
[1:21:45] that was his reward
[1:21:49] see reasoning is not going to work
[1:21:52] reasoning will never work
[1:21:54] it doesn't make sense my thoughts are
[1:21:56] higher than your thoughts and my ways
[1:21:58] are
[1:21:58] higher than your ways you tell me how
[1:22:02] you could ever
[1:22:02] justify in human reasoning that it means
[1:22:05] like your child you come to your child
[1:22:07] you say guess what you have made your
[1:22:10] bed perfect every day this week
[1:22:13] and you did all of your math lessons and
[1:22:16] all of your school
[1:22:17] perfect 100 on everything and i haven't
[1:22:20] had to remind you one time to do what i
[1:22:22] asked you to do and you even did
[1:22:24] above and beyond you did extra and you
[1:22:27] followed my word perfectly
[1:22:29] oh i'm so happy now let's go to the
[1:22:32] bedroom and we'll give you a spanking
[1:22:38] what you understand friends that's what
[1:22:42] job got
[1:22:43] that's exactly what job got
[1:22:47] but job said god giveth and he taketh
[1:22:49] away blessed be the name of the lord
[1:22:53] job was learning to trust god
[1:22:57] we're back here in chapter 2.
[1:23:03] he again mentions job verse 3 and the
[1:23:06] lord said unto satan has thou considered
[1:23:07] my servant job
[1:23:09] that there is none like him in the earth
[1:23:10] a perfect and upright man
[1:23:12] one that feareth god and skew with evil
[1:23:14] and still he holdeth fast his integrity
[1:23:16] although thou movest me against him
[1:23:18] to destroy him without cause
[1:23:21] and satan answered the lord and said
[1:23:23] skin for skin yea all that a man hath
[1:23:25] will he give for his life
[1:23:27] but put forth thine hand now and touch
[1:23:29] his bone in his flesh
[1:23:30] and he will curse thee to thy face and
[1:23:32] the lord said unto satan behold
[1:23:34] he is in thine hand but save his life
[1:23:37] so he goes down and he breaks him out
[1:23:39] with boils
[1:23:40] let's read it here verse seven so it
[1:23:42] went satan forth with present from the
[1:23:44] presence of the lord and smote job was
[1:23:46] sore boiled from the soul of his foot
[1:23:48] into his crown
[1:23:49] and he took him a pot shirt to scrape
[1:23:51] himself with all and he sat down among
[1:23:52] the ashes
[1:23:54] then said his wife and him dost thou
[1:23:55] still retain thine integrity curse god
[1:23:57] and die
[1:23:58] but he said unto her thou speakest as
[1:24:00] one of the foolish women speaketh
[1:24:02] what shall we receive good at the hand
[1:24:03] of god and shall we not receive
[1:24:05] evil we'll take as good will we not take
[1:24:08] his evil
[1:24:10] will we only receive blessings will we
[1:24:13] not receive
[1:24:14] cursings that's a good question
[1:24:19] will we only receive good will we not
[1:24:21] also receive the evil
[1:24:25] go ask that in the denominational church
[1:24:27] [Music]
[1:24:29] but the question is a good one for us
[1:24:32] we want god always to give blessings
[1:24:34] always to do good
[1:24:35] and sometimes the good thing that he's
[1:24:37] doing looks bad
[1:24:40] sometimes what we would call evil is
[1:24:42] something god's working for good
[1:24:45] and we've got to be willing to take both
[1:24:48] why because he's our father and he knows
[1:24:51] we've got to have confidence in him
[1:24:58] he said let's read that again what shall
[1:25:01] we receive good at the hand of god and
[1:25:02] shall we
[1:25:03] not receive evil in all this did not job
[1:25:06] sin
[1:25:07] with his lips i said oh god help me
[1:25:11] help me help me help me lord
[1:25:14] brother branham said in the reaction to
[1:25:16] an action from 59
[1:25:18] god tests like job they accused him that
[1:25:21] he was a secret sinner
[1:25:22] and job was righteous there was no man
[1:25:24] on earth like him
[1:25:25] and yet god let the devil take
[1:25:27] everything he had and when they accused
[1:25:29] him of being a secret sinner
[1:25:30] he knew that he was righteous before god
[1:25:32] he knew he had done no sin
[1:25:34] but god lets those things happen to see
[1:25:36] what you'll do
[1:25:38] you see and he and satan had a
[1:25:40] proposition satan said
[1:25:41] i'll make him curse you to your face god
[1:25:43] said you can't do it
[1:25:45] and the test had to come and your test
[1:25:47] comes and my test comes
[1:25:49] and we all go through those testings the
[1:25:50] bible said if we cannot stand that it
[1:25:52] proves that we are illegitimate
[1:25:54] children our testimony was not right
[1:25:57] we're not
[1:25:57] real children of god but we become
[1:25:59] illegitimate we're not the children of
[1:26:01] god we just claim to be
[1:26:03] when the test comes and we forget god
[1:26:06] and we forget who we are and we lose all
[1:26:08] hope and faith that proves we weren't
[1:26:09] who we said we were
[1:26:11] right that's a big statement
[1:26:14] in the message look from 1963 he says
[1:26:16] job when even all of his friends had
[1:26:19] turned him down
[1:26:19] everything was wrong job kept looking
[1:26:21] towards the sky somebody said you're a
[1:26:23] secret sinner
[1:26:24] you're looking job what are you looking
[1:26:26] up that way for because
[1:26:28] you've done sin god has done prove that
[1:26:30] he's what he's done to you you're a
[1:26:32] secret sinner job
[1:26:34] job knowed he wasn't a sinner he had met
[1:26:36] exactly every word god required
[1:26:39] that burnt sacrifice what was job
[1:26:43] looking at
[1:26:44] job wasn't looking so much at his
[1:26:46] conduct as he was looking at his
[1:26:48] faith in the word of god god had
[1:26:51] required a burnt sacrifice
[1:26:52] and he had offered a burnt sacrifice and
[1:26:54] that was an atonement for our sins
[1:26:56] and so he was righteous and sin free not
[1:26:59] because he never made a mistake
[1:27:01] but because he had faith in what god
[1:27:03] told him to do to atone for his sins
[1:27:06] it was his faith in the revealed word
[1:27:08] for his day that job had
[1:27:10] and job was resting confidently in that
[1:27:14] he could answer down his friends who
[1:27:16] would come to me had three friends who
[1:27:17] come to them
[1:27:18] and begin all to accuse him saying now
[1:27:21] job
[1:27:21] now why don't you just go ahead and
[1:27:22] admit it
[1:27:24] why don't you just go ahead and fess up
[1:27:26] to what you've done because god doesn't
[1:27:28] do this to people unless they've done
[1:27:30] wrong
[1:27:34] oh praise god help us never to be guilty
[1:27:37] of that same kind of accusing spirit
[1:27:40] when we see a brother or sister going
[1:27:42] through something difficult don't you
[1:27:43] automatically assume they're wrong
[1:27:45] before god
[1:27:46] that might be good evidence they're
[1:27:48] perfect and upright
[1:27:49] and and perfect in all other ways
[1:27:53] don't be one of job's friends
[1:27:56] come on job come on god will not receive
[1:27:59] a hypocrite that's why these problems
[1:28:00] are happening to you
[1:28:02] there's no come on job you can't fool us
[1:28:06] we know all about god we're the experts
[1:28:10] on god
[1:28:16] nothing's changed nothing's changed
[1:28:20] every spirit that was alive then is
[1:28:22] alive now
[1:28:26] the spirits that were against job then
[1:28:28] are against the bride now
[1:28:32] job now we know all about god
[1:28:37] and i can tell you for sure that god
[1:28:40] doesn't do these things to somebody
[1:28:41] who's righteous
[1:28:43] you've got sin in your life
[1:28:47] what a friend come on job
[1:28:51] now you keep justifying yourself and you
[1:28:53] keep saying there's nothing wrong with
[1:28:55] you
[1:28:55] job wasn't looking at his conduct he was
[1:28:57] looking at the burnt sacrifice
[1:29:00] job was looking at the word of god amen
[1:29:03] you could job didn't say job was not
[1:29:07] saying
[1:29:07] i've never told a lie i haven't ever
[1:29:09] been mean to my wife
[1:29:10] i never did a bad business deal he
[1:29:12] wasn't saying that he was saying i'm
[1:29:14] righteous because he told me to offer a
[1:29:16] sacrifice i offered a sacrifice
[1:29:18] i did what he said to do i believed his
[1:29:20] word i fully believed his word and
[1:29:22] operated in it i'm clean from all of my
[1:29:25] sin
[1:29:27] can we have that same kind of confidence
[1:29:29] when bad things happen to us
[1:29:31] can we look back on our life and say i
[1:29:32] fully believe the word i believed this
[1:29:34] message with all my heart
[1:29:35] i stood on and everything he said did i
[1:29:37] did it with everything i know to do
[1:29:39] if there's something i did wrong it
[1:29:40] wasn't in my knowledge because i fully
[1:29:43] believed the word and stood upon it
[1:29:45] if we can get to that place then we can
[1:29:46] just stand still and see the salvation
[1:29:48] of god
[1:29:49] because god's doing something
[1:29:53] amen he knowed he wasn't a sinner
[1:29:57] he had met exactly every word god
[1:29:59] required the burnt sacrifice
[1:30:01] that burnt offering was all god asked
[1:30:03] for god only asked for the burnt
[1:30:05] offering
[1:30:05] and job knowed he had made the burnt
[1:30:07] offering sacrifice
[1:30:09] god only asked you to believe his word
[1:30:11] amen he don't ask all those isms and
[1:30:13] creeds and everything else
[1:30:14] he asked you to believe him
[1:30:18] and believing him is the sign of
[1:30:20] righteousness
[1:30:23] he says in the message recognizing your
[1:30:25] day and its message from 1964
[1:30:28] job never recognized that it was god as
[1:30:30] long as the devil can make you believe
[1:30:32] sometime that the little trials you go
[1:30:33] through is god's punishing you
[1:30:37] oh praise be to god
[1:30:42] as long as the devil can make you
[1:30:44] believe sometime that the little trials
[1:30:46] you go through is god punishing you
[1:30:47] it was god trying to show him something
[1:30:51] it wasn't a punishment god was trying to
[1:30:53] sow him something
[1:30:54] job never recognized it till he saw a
[1:30:57] vision
[1:30:58] like moses when moses saw the vision the
[1:31:00] pillar of fire in the bush it was
[1:31:01] vindicated
[1:31:03] job in his question see job had a
[1:31:06] question
[1:31:09] see the whole time that god is in this
[1:31:11] contest with satan
[1:31:12] have you considered job he's perfect
[1:31:15] there's none like him on the earth
[1:31:16] he says oh if you do this and this he
[1:31:18] said go ahead and see he doesn't he
[1:31:20] comes back and says hey try him again
[1:31:22] i mean did you still consider him look
[1:31:23] you even tried to destroy him you moved
[1:31:25] me against him and he didn't sin
[1:31:29] he says do him again because god knew
[1:31:31] down in job's heart was a question
[1:31:34] job wasn't a sinner job wasn't a center
[1:31:38] he wasn't off the word but down in his
[1:31:40] heart was a question and god wanted to
[1:31:41] answer the question
[1:31:44] so you realize whenever something hits
[1:31:46] when trials hit
[1:31:47] god's doing many things at the same time
[1:31:50] god can accomplish many purposes with
[1:31:52] the same trial
[1:31:55] god is showing and proving i have an
[1:31:57] elect seed
[1:31:58] who will stand on my word to say there's
[1:32:00] a contest between god and satan
[1:32:02] and god is going to win this contest
[1:32:03] because he knows what's in job
[1:32:05] but he also knows down job as a question
[1:32:08] a question about the resurrection a
[1:32:10] question about
[1:32:11] hey you know i see a tree go down and
[1:32:12] come up i see a flower go down but what
[1:32:14] about man he goes into darkness and
[1:32:16] never sees light again
[1:32:18] and god is in a contest with satan but
[1:32:20] also going to answer job's question
[1:32:22] all at the same time not because
[1:32:26] job's a sinner but because job's a son
[1:32:32] it was god trying to show him something
[1:32:34] job never recognized it till he saw a
[1:32:36] vision like moses when moses saw the
[1:32:38] vision the pillar of fire in the bush it
[1:32:39] was vindicated
[1:32:40] job in his question if a man dies can he
[1:32:43] live again
[1:32:44] i see a tree die it lives again i see a
[1:32:46] flower dies it lives again
[1:32:48] that was his question but man layth down
[1:32:50] and giveth up the goat he wasted the way
[1:32:52] his sons come to mourn and perceive
[1:32:54] it not he perceive it not and that thou
[1:32:56] would hide me in the grave until thy
[1:32:58] wrath has passed
[1:33:00] he couldn't understand why a flower
[1:33:02] would die and live again how a leaf
[1:33:03] would go off a tree down
[1:33:05] and lay on the ground and come back
[1:33:06] again in the spring he said man layth
[1:33:08] down and
[1:33:09] where does he go i believe god but what
[1:33:11] happens to a man
[1:33:13] but then one day the lightning began to
[1:33:15] flash the thunders began to roar the
[1:33:17] spirit came upon the prophet
[1:33:18] and he saw the coming of a man who would
[1:33:20] put his hand upon a sinful man
[1:33:22] and a holy god and bridge the way then
[1:33:25] he screamed
[1:33:26] i know my redeemer liveth though the
[1:33:28] skin worms destroy this body
[1:33:30] yet in my flesh i'll see god he
[1:33:33] recognized what the resurrection was
[1:33:36] god was in a contest with satan but he
[1:33:39] was also going to teach
[1:33:40] something to a son that would help the
[1:33:43] son overcome his question
[1:33:46] and job was willing to rejoice let's
[1:33:49] look at job 40
[1:33:50] let's turn over to chapter 40.
[1:33:58] job has this discourse with his three
[1:34:01] friends
[1:34:02] and the scripture says they came from a
[1:34:04] long way they gathered together to
[1:34:06] comfort
[1:34:07] job that was their purpose to comfort
[1:34:09] him
[1:34:10] and in comforting him they began to
[1:34:12] accuse him
[1:34:14] of being a sinner and no doubt they
[1:34:16] thought they were doing him a favor
[1:34:17] because if they could just get him to
[1:34:18] confess this trial would end
[1:34:20] like if you just fess up to what you did
[1:34:22] wrong if you just a fess up to being a
[1:34:23] hypocrite if you would just tell us all
[1:34:25] you've lived a double life
[1:34:26] i'm sure god would take all this away
[1:34:28] and everything would be fine
[1:34:29] but you realize that they had another
[1:34:32] motive
[1:34:37] because the scripture says he was the
[1:34:39] greatest man of the east
[1:34:42] he was the greatest man of the east
[1:34:47] and these friends come to him to comfort
[1:34:49] him but they never speak one word of
[1:34:50] comfort
[1:34:52] all they speak is accusation you know
[1:34:55] why
[1:34:56] because they weren't the greatest man in
[1:34:57] the east
[1:34:59] that's exactly why there was envy
[1:35:02] in their heart and all they could do was
[1:35:04] accuse him
[1:35:06] point out possible problems and possible
[1:35:08] failures
[1:35:09] possible hypocrisy see the devil plays
[1:35:13] on all of our emotions
[1:35:15] and he creates envy and he creates pride
[1:35:18] takes pride and envy
[1:35:19] and does all he does to separate
[1:35:21] fellowship
[1:35:23] and say god don't ever let me be like
[1:35:24] that
[1:35:26] let me love my brother truly and
[1:35:29] genuinely
[1:35:30] but job also had a question in his heart
[1:35:33] so the friends
[1:35:34] they had a problem job had a question
[1:35:37] god
[1:35:37] had a battle with his enemy how many
[1:35:39] things is god accomplishing in one trial
[1:35:42] he's doing it all don't ever don't ever
[1:35:45] get to the place where you see a try and
[1:35:46] say oh god was doing that for that
[1:35:47] purpose
[1:35:48] that might have been one of many and
[1:35:51] don't don't come to the conclusion too
[1:35:53] quick
[1:35:55] amen chapter 40 verse 1
[1:35:58] now uh these three friends speak and job
[1:36:02] contest with them and it's not a
[1:36:04] pleasant conversation
[1:36:05] and then elihu speaks and elieu is in
[1:36:07] the place of god brother bram said he's
[1:36:09] the type of christ
[1:36:10] and he begins to set job straight when
[1:36:12] he sets soap job straight
[1:36:13] he's teaching job a lesson because job
[1:36:16] had been complaining
[1:36:18] job wasn't a sinner he didn't sin
[1:36:20] against god he was a perfect and upright
[1:36:22] man but when he hit his trial
[1:36:24] he started saying oh i hate the day i
[1:36:26] was born
[1:36:28] i wish that i'd never come forth from
[1:36:30] the womb i wish that
[1:36:31] i i was cast forth and i was buried as a
[1:36:34] baby and i never saw the light of day
[1:36:36] and i could rest under the ground
[1:36:37] what was he doing he was complaining in
[1:36:39] the midst of his trial
[1:36:41] he wasn't a sinner he wasn't unrighteous
[1:36:43] he believed the word but when it got hot
[1:36:45] and heavy
[1:36:46] he started saying i hate the day i was
[1:36:48] born i wish i had never been conceived
[1:36:51] all made dark be the night where they
[1:36:53] said a man child is conceived
[1:36:56] oh i wish i could say i've never done
[1:36:58] that
[1:36:59] i wish i could say i was more righteous
[1:37:01] than job but i've i've cried the same
[1:37:04] tears and believed the same thing
[1:37:05] and said it's too much for me it would
[1:37:07] be better if i were dead
[1:37:09] and job never should have done that
[1:37:11] because job was in the place of god
[1:37:13] and job was a tool god was using to
[1:37:15] fight his enemy and he was fulfilling
[1:37:17] god's purpose but in fulfilling god's
[1:37:19] purpose he was saying i wish i had never
[1:37:20] been born
[1:37:21] i wish i could have just laid and died i
[1:37:23] wish i would have never been conceived
[1:37:28] and this is going on with his battle
[1:37:29] with his friends and his friends have
[1:37:30] their own thing going on
[1:37:32] and he's got his own thing going on and
[1:37:33] god's answering a question
[1:37:35] and he's complaining and elihu comes and
[1:37:37] sets him straight and says hey
[1:37:38] you better not be complaining god is god
[1:37:41] and everything he does is righteous and
[1:37:43] don't you be whining
[1:37:44] and job started saying this is not fair
[1:37:47] i mean that's not an exact quote you can
[1:37:49] go and read it but what he's saying is
[1:37:50] this isn't fair
[1:37:52] i haven't done anything wrong this isn't
[1:37:54] fair and i wish i could say i've never
[1:37:56] said that either
[1:37:58] but i'm just as guilty amen
[1:38:01] he's saying this isn't fair i didn't do
[1:38:04] anything wrong
[1:38:05] i don't deserve this this ain't fair he
[1:38:08] said i don't know why god is doing this
[1:38:10] and ellie you ellie begins to rebuke him
[1:38:12] and say are you making god unrighteous
[1:38:16] i mean you're saying you didn't do
[1:38:18] anything wrong and this isn't fair are
[1:38:19] you making god unrighteous and unjust
[1:38:22] be careful he wasn't wrong in saying he
[1:38:25] didn't sin
[1:38:25] there was nothing wrong with that he
[1:38:27] wasn't a sinner he could say i'm a
[1:38:29] believer
[1:38:29] but to say this isn't fair now we've got
[1:38:32] a problem
[1:38:34] now he's sideways making an accusation
[1:38:37] against the righteousness of god
[1:38:41] when we get a trial we got to be careful
[1:38:43] friends we don't complain
[1:38:45] don't start throwing out complaints and
[1:38:46] don't start saying this isn't fair
[1:38:48] i've always paid my tithes why am i
[1:38:50] having a financial problem
[1:38:52] i gave more than ten percent i paid
[1:38:55] tithes and i gave offer
[1:38:56] god this isn't fair you better be
[1:38:58] careful because what you're doing is
[1:38:59] accusing god of being unrighteous
[1:39:03] and we've got to say god whatever you do
[1:39:05] is perfect
[1:39:08] though you slay me let yeah will i serve
[1:39:10] you
[1:39:12] so elieu becomes comes to set him
[1:39:14] straight and after ellie who speaks
[1:39:17] here comes god in a whirlwind
[1:39:21] and it says moreover the lord answered
[1:39:23] job and said
[1:39:24] shall he that contendeth with the
[1:39:26] almighty instruct him
[1:39:28] he that reproveth god let him answer it
[1:39:31] then job answered the lord and said
[1:39:32] behold
[1:39:33] i am vile why shall i answer thee i will
[1:39:36] lay my hand upon my mouth
[1:39:38] once have i spoken but i will not answer
[1:39:40] yea twice
[1:39:41] but i will proceed no further then
[1:39:43] answered the lord unto job out of the
[1:39:45] whirlwind and said gird up thy loins now
[1:39:46] like a man
[1:39:47] i will demand of thee and declare that
[1:39:49] unto me will thou
[1:39:51] also disannulle my judgment will thou
[1:39:53] condemn me
[1:39:54] that thou mayest be righteous he's
[1:39:57] asking him
[1:39:58] oh you're complaining all you're saying
[1:40:00] is not fair
[1:40:01] all you're saying you didn't do anything
[1:40:02] wrong you don't know why god's letting
[1:40:04] this happen to you
[1:40:05] are you disannulling my judgment
[1:40:09] and he asked another good question here
[1:40:12] will thou condemn me
[1:40:14] that you will be righteous will you
[1:40:17] condemn me
[1:40:18] so you can look righteous
[1:40:21] job wasn't a sinner job wasn't an
[1:40:24] unbeliever
[1:40:24] but in his complaining he was stepping
[1:40:27] too far
[1:40:30] he said god help me never to complain
[1:40:31] again
[1:40:33] amen help me god please help me
[1:40:36] chapter 42 god speaks again job's going
[1:40:39] to give another answer
[1:40:41] then job answered the lord and said i
[1:40:43] know that thou canst do everything and
[1:40:45] that no thought can be withholden from
[1:40:47] thee
[1:40:49] who is he that hideth counsel without
[1:40:51] knowledge therefore have i uttered that
[1:40:53] i understood not
[1:40:54] things too wonderful for me which i knew
[1:40:56] not here i beseech thee
[1:40:58] and i will speak i will demand of thee
[1:41:01] and declare that unto me
[1:41:02] i have heard of thee by the hearing of
[1:41:04] the ear but now my eye seeth thee
[1:41:06] wherefore i abhor myself and repent and
[1:41:09] dust and ashes
[1:41:11] job just got put back in his place
[1:41:16] who can say it's not fair who can say
[1:41:19] it's not right
[1:41:20] who can say this shouldn't be happening
[1:41:22] to me how can you say those things
[1:41:25] just we've got to let god be god no more
[1:41:29] it's not fair
[1:41:30] no moreness isn't right no more but just
[1:41:33] saying god i don't understand but i
[1:41:34] trust you
[1:41:36] it doesn't make sense to my mind but i
[1:41:37] believe you anyhow
[1:41:39] and i know i fully believed your word i
[1:41:41] know i have fully trusted in you
[1:41:43] and i'm going to rest and wait for you
[1:41:45] to show me whatever you want to show me
[1:41:47] teach me lord and have your way in me
[1:41:53] now job had a question
[1:41:57] god was going to answer satan wanted to
[1:41:59] prove himself
[1:42:01] or god wanted to prove himself to satan
[1:42:03] so we have the satan showdown between
[1:42:04] god and satan
[1:42:05] you have the lesson of job then you have
[1:42:08] the envy of the three friends
[1:42:10] and then you have job whining and
[1:42:12] getting corrected i think there's a lot
[1:42:14] happening in this trial
[1:42:16] i think the trial has something for
[1:42:18] everyone
[1:42:22] brother bam says show us the father
[1:42:23] 1961.
[1:42:27] even it's the oldest book in the bible
[1:42:29] job when he was broke out with boils
[1:42:31] looked like
[1:42:32] everything had gone against him and his
[1:42:34] christian or his religious friend said
[1:42:36] job you've done evil
[1:42:37] many people want to say because
[1:42:39] somebody's sick that they did evil
[1:42:41] that's not the truth job was a perfect
[1:42:44] man god said so
[1:42:45] but sometimes god lets affliction hit
[1:42:47] his people to test him for their faith
[1:42:50] he was testing a saint not rebuking a
[1:42:53] sinner
[1:42:55] oh can we let this be true can we let it
[1:42:57] be true in us
[1:42:58] and can we let it be true in somebody
[1:43:00] else like we want it to be true in us
[1:43:02] but can it be true for somebody else he
[1:43:06] said
[1:43:06] he was testing a saint not rebuking a
[1:43:09] sinner
[1:43:10] and god does that to test
[1:43:13] now let's look at job 13.
[1:43:17] and i want to look at chapter 13 for a
[1:43:19] second and look at
[1:43:20] job's answer to his friends this is
[1:43:23] another place i really started laughing
[1:43:25] hard
[1:43:26] today chapter 13
[1:43:31] look at verse one lo mine eye has seen
[1:43:33] all this mine here has heard
[1:43:35] and understood it they keep telling him
[1:43:37] stuff that he already knows
[1:43:39] god doesn't accept a sinner god doesn't
[1:43:42] address a hypocrite
[1:43:43] and i mean he said and job is saying my
[1:43:46] eye has seen all this
[1:43:48] my ear hath heard and understand it what
[1:43:51] ye know the same do i know also
[1:43:53] i'm not inferior to you surely i would
[1:43:57] speak to the almighty and i desire to
[1:43:58] reason with god
[1:44:00] but you are forgers of lies you are
[1:44:03] physicians of no value
[1:44:05] that's when i really got a good chuckle
[1:44:08] you come to comfort me and be a
[1:44:10] physician and heal me
[1:44:11] you're physicians of no value i already
[1:44:14] know what you know
[1:44:15] i already know god judges sinners i
[1:44:17] already know god doesn't accept
[1:44:19] grace but but that doesn't explain my
[1:44:21] situation because i'm not a sinner and
[1:44:22] i'm
[1:44:22] not a hypocrite i know what you know
[1:44:24] i've seen what you said i've heard what
[1:44:26] you've heard i'm not inferior to you
[1:44:28] i want god to speak to me you are
[1:44:30] forgers of lies and you are physicians
[1:44:32] of no value
[1:44:35] you're worthless i said god
[1:44:39] i don't ever want to be a physician of
[1:44:41] no value when i see a friend or somebody
[1:44:43] in a trial
[1:44:44] i don't want to be that kind of a
[1:44:45] physician but god knows how to correct
[1:44:48] his children it's not up to me to
[1:44:49] correct his children
[1:44:50] amen if i see a brother amen regardless
[1:44:53] of what i think
[1:44:54] god is able to instruct a brother i'm
[1:44:56] just there to be a brother
[1:44:59] why can't we just pour the oil in why is
[1:45:02] it we always have to have the answer
[1:45:04] why can't we just pray for one another
[1:45:07] why can't we just support one another
[1:45:08] why do we always have to prove that we
[1:45:10] know the most and we know why you're
[1:45:12] going through a trial and we know
[1:45:14] exactly why this is happening
[1:45:16] and i can answer on behalf of god
[1:45:19] god got angry with those three friends
[1:45:21] because he says
[1:45:22] do you speak on my behalf
[1:45:25] as if we know why god's doing everything
[1:45:28] he's doing as if i can say
[1:45:30] this is happening because of this and
[1:45:31] this is the reason because of that
[1:45:35] physicians of no value can't we just
[1:45:38] pour the oil in
[1:45:40] and say i love you brother i'm praying
[1:45:42] for you
[1:45:44] you know by saying to a brother i see
[1:45:46] you're in a trial
[1:45:47] i love you be of good cheer god's just
[1:45:50] testing you'll come through the test
[1:45:51] god will prevail maybe god wants to
[1:45:53] teach them something
[1:45:55] maybe there's something wrong he's going
[1:45:56] to correct
[1:45:58] but do you really know what it is
[1:46:01] i don't want to be one of the three
[1:46:03] friends of job
[1:46:05] because god rebuked them sharply
[1:46:09] he wasn't pleased with their all-knowing
[1:46:12] all-understanding speaking on his behalf
[1:46:15] giving job the reasons why he's going
[1:46:16] through a trial and they were completely
[1:46:18] 100
[1:46:19] wrong even though the things they said
[1:46:21] were exactly true
[1:46:24] they were true they were speaking truth
[1:46:26] if you look at the things that they say
[1:46:27] in their discourses
[1:46:28] those verses are quoted elsewhere in the
[1:46:30] psalms and even jesus will quote
[1:46:32] what the friends are saying because
[1:46:33] they're speaking truth but they're
[1:46:35] misapplying the truth
[1:46:36] to job that's why he says you're forgers
[1:46:39] of lies
[1:46:40] not because they weren't speaking the
[1:46:41] truth what they said was true but when
[1:46:44] they said job was a sinner they now were
[1:46:45] a liar
[1:46:49] he says now god doesn't accept a sinner
[1:46:51] you're a sinner that made them a liar
[1:46:53] but saying god doesn't accept a sinner
[1:46:55] is true
[1:46:58] so much so that david would quote
[1:47:00] eliphaz
[1:47:02] in the psalms
[1:47:07] it was truth but it was truth misapplied
[1:47:11] to a son of god just because we know the
[1:47:15] truth and know the scriptures
[1:47:16] doesn't mean we've got that we know what
[1:47:19] god's doing
[1:47:22] what's wrong with saying i love you
[1:47:24] brother and i'm sorry for what you're
[1:47:25] going through i'm going to pray for you
[1:47:26] and may god deliver you
[1:47:28] amen as if somehow if we do that we
[1:47:31] remove the rod
[1:47:33] we're not the ones with the rod the
[1:47:36] great shepherd is the one with the rod
[1:47:38] if the rod's going to come down the
[1:47:40] rod's going to come down regardless of
[1:47:41] what you say
[1:47:43] why can't we just say god bless you
[1:47:45] brother i'm sorry i'll be praying for
[1:47:47] you
[1:47:48] may god help you why can't we be a
[1:47:51] physician of value
[1:47:53] and let god be the judge and let god do
[1:47:55] what he's going to do
[1:47:57] why can't we just have brotherly
[1:47:58] kindness and love each other
[1:48:00] what happened to brotherly kindness you
[1:48:02] know if you don't have brotherly
[1:48:03] kindness you'll never have capstone love
[1:48:06] and if we can't have brotherly kindness
[1:48:08] forget the capstone friends
[1:48:13] somehow we feel like if i'm nice to this
[1:48:16] brother and i think he's made a mistake
[1:48:17] and if i show
[1:48:18] love somehow i've taken away god's
[1:48:19] judgment you can't take away god's
[1:48:22] judgment
[1:48:25] are you a better judge than god
[1:48:29] are you a better at afflicting the right
[1:48:32] kind of punishment than god
[1:48:36] i say if we're going to make a mistake
[1:48:38] let's make the mistake on the side of
[1:48:39] love
[1:48:40] and give too much give too much love
[1:48:44] too much brotherly kindness too much
[1:48:46] forgiveness too much benefit of the
[1:48:48] doubt
[1:48:48] too much believing in a brother too much
[1:48:50] just assuming he's okay with god
[1:48:52] i want to err that way let me just
[1:48:54] assume everything's fine with him of god
[1:48:56] god will take care of the rest i don't
[1:48:58] think god will fault me for assuming
[1:48:59] he's fine
[1:49:01] i don't think god's going to look down
[1:49:02] at me with anger for saying i love my
[1:49:04] brother god i pray that you bless him
[1:49:06] even if what god's doing is punishing
[1:49:08] him if i still pray for his blessing i
[1:49:10] don't think god's going to be angry with
[1:49:12] me
[1:49:14] why because i'm not god and i don't know
[1:49:17] so if i have to make an assumption why
[1:49:20] is it always easier to assume the evil
[1:49:23] why can't we just assume the good you
[1:49:26] know we do this with our friends all the
[1:49:27] time
[1:49:28] you find out somebody tells you your
[1:49:29] friend did something you assume
[1:49:31] automatically he didn't do it because i
[1:49:32] know his character
[1:49:34] and you later may find out he did do it
[1:49:37] but your first assumption is he didn't
[1:49:39] but when somebody tells you
[1:49:40] something about somebody you don't like
[1:49:42] you automatically assume it's true
[1:49:47] that's flawed humanity but that's not
[1:49:49] the nature of god
[1:49:52] why is it so easy to believe something
[1:49:54] bad about somebody
[1:49:55] you don't like but it's so hard to
[1:49:56] believe bad stuff about somebody you do
[1:49:58] like
[1:50:00] do you think that's righteous judgment
[1:50:02] that's the fallacy of mankind
[1:50:06] i say god help me to love
[1:50:10] my brothers whether they're an heir or
[1:50:12] not merit help me to love them
[1:50:15] amen and i want to assume the best
[1:50:20] somebody tells you something about a
[1:50:21] brother assume it's wrong
[1:50:25] assume it's wrong until it's been proven
[1:50:28] that's what the bible tells us to do
[1:50:30] assume it's wrong assume the best
[1:50:33] believe for the best
[1:50:34] believe in your brothers and sisters and
[1:50:36] believe that they're righteous and holy
[1:50:38] and god loves them
[1:50:39] and everything's just fine and don't
[1:50:41] worry
[1:50:42] if something's got to be exposed god
[1:50:44] will expose it
[1:50:46] he doesn't need you to be the all-wise
[1:50:48] one to help him
[1:50:50] he'll do it so job
[1:50:53] this is job's good advice and i'd like
[1:50:55] to take it home for us
[1:50:57] be for but ye are forgers of lies you
[1:51:00] are all physicians of no value
[1:51:02] oh that you would all together hold your
[1:51:04] peace it should
[1:51:06] and it should be your wisdom
[1:51:12] amen that's good advice friends let's
[1:51:14] just take it home to ourselves
[1:51:16] amen your physicians of no value all
[1:51:19] that you would just hold your peace and
[1:51:20] be quiet
[1:51:21] it would be counted unto you for wisdom
[1:51:23] you'd look a whole lot smarter than you
[1:51:25] look now that's actually what he's
[1:51:26] saying
[1:51:29] amen i say god make me a physician of
[1:51:32] value
[1:51:35] amen i want to be an instrument of
[1:51:37] healing
[1:51:38] not punishment i want
[1:51:42] to be an instrument of love not hate
[1:51:45] i want to promote a brother not be
[1:51:47] jealous of a brother and have to pull
[1:51:48] him down
[1:51:50] i want to be any brother that i'm around
[1:51:52] i want to see if we can get them higher
[1:51:53] and higher that's what the bible says
[1:51:56] honor them
[1:51:56] amen esteem them greater than yourself
[1:51:59] that's the bible
[1:52:01] why is it so hard to do that when they
[1:52:04] see job the greatest man because god
[1:52:05] made him the greatest man
[1:52:06] all of a sudden when he's in trouble
[1:52:07] they can't wait to get to him and say
[1:52:09] it's because you're wrong here you're
[1:52:10] wrong you're wrong here you're wrong
[1:52:12] here why
[1:52:13] because we would be living in 2020 and
[1:52:15] we'll do the same
[1:52:17] thing today that they did back then
[1:52:20] what a lesson for us i don't ever want
[1:52:22] to be that way amen
[1:52:24] i'd rather come to job and say job i'm
[1:52:26] praying that you come out of this
[1:52:27] greater than when you came in i pray
[1:52:29] that god will bless you more
[1:52:30] i pray that you're you're you'll
[1:52:32] increase in every way because that's
[1:52:33] exactly what god
[1:52:35] did he got double of everything he lost
[1:52:37] [Applause]
[1:52:39] and if you would be talking to him like
[1:52:41] that you would be on god's side
[1:52:48] amen let's jump over here to back to 42.
[1:52:56] after god's done with job he turns to
[1:52:58] eliphaz
[1:53:00] the first of the three friends verse
[1:53:03] seven
[1:53:05] and it was so that after the lord had
[1:53:06] spoken these words unto job
[1:53:08] the lord said to eliphaz the temanite my
[1:53:11] wrath
[1:53:12] is kindled against thee and against thy
[1:53:13] two friends for you have not spoken of
[1:53:16] me
[1:53:16] the thing that is right as my servant
[1:53:18] job has
[1:53:19] therefore taken to you now seven
[1:53:21] bulldogs and seven rams
[1:53:23] and go to my servant job and offer up
[1:53:25] for yourselves a burnt
[1:53:26] offering and my servant job shall pray
[1:53:28] for you for him
[1:53:30] will i accept lest i deal with you after
[1:53:32] your folly and that you have not spoken
[1:53:34] of me the thing which is right like my
[1:53:36] servant job
[1:53:38] god knew exactly what their problem was
[1:53:42] their problem was envy and when god
[1:53:45] deals with the problem
[1:53:47] they jumped on job when job was down
[1:53:50] boy that's brave
[1:53:53] they got on job when job was down
[1:53:57] but then when god corrects them he says
[1:53:59] you've not spoken to me the thing that's
[1:54:00] right that was your own doing
[1:54:03] and now to be right with me you've
[1:54:06] got to humble yourself to the one that
[1:54:09] you've been accusing
[1:54:10] all this time oh god knows exactly how
[1:54:15] to fix
[1:54:15] us rotten human beings he knows how to
[1:54:18] hit us where it hurts the worst
[1:54:20] he knows how to bring shame in a basis
[1:54:22] and he knows how to fix the problem
[1:54:25] [Music]
[1:54:26] i said god help me help me
[1:54:29] help me help me i don't want to be like
[1:54:31] job's friends
[1:54:33] i don't want to be a whiner like job i
[1:54:36] just want to believe your word
[1:54:38] i want to be like job at the end of his
[1:54:40] trial i put my hand over my mouth
[1:54:45] i've spoken once and i won't do it again
[1:54:46] i spoke twice but never
[1:54:48] never again oh if we could just get
[1:54:51] there right now
[1:54:51] god teach me this lesson now god before
[1:54:54] the next trial hits teach me this lesson
[1:54:56] right now
[1:54:57] i just want to be quiet and i want to
[1:54:59] trust you quietly
[1:55:00] and if i say anything i want to say
[1:55:02] something that's in the word
[1:55:04] like i know my redeemer liveth nothing
[1:55:06] else
[1:55:08] god's promises are true nothing else
[1:55:11] not this isn't fair i don't know why
[1:55:13] this is happening god knows
[1:55:15] god knows i paid my tithe god knows i
[1:55:17] did right like are you mad at god
[1:55:20] please don't be don't be upset at him
[1:55:22] don't accuse him
[1:55:23] just say hey bless god praise the lord
[1:55:26] he's perfect in all of his ways
[1:55:28] and then put your hand back over your
[1:55:29] mouth and if you ever take your hand off
[1:55:31] of your mouth
[1:55:31] just take your hand off your mouth to
[1:55:33] praise him and then put your hand back
[1:55:35] over your mouth
[1:55:37] i want to be where job ended
[1:55:40] amen and i don't ever want to be like
[1:55:42] job's friends
[1:55:44] i want to be a physician with real value
[1:55:47] to my brothers and sisters guess what
[1:55:50] do you think things are going to get
[1:55:53] easier
[1:55:55] do you think trials are going to get
[1:55:57] less frequent
[1:55:59] that's not my expectation and do you
[1:56:02] think once the media starts getting
[1:56:04] involved
[1:56:05] that they'll always report the truth
[1:56:07] about your brother or sister
[1:56:13] amen what if the news got involved
[1:56:17] and something happened something
[1:56:20] happened in the church or something
[1:56:21] happened
[1:56:22] the news got involved do you think they
[1:56:24] would tell it exactly right
[1:56:28] and do you think that would be a
[1:56:29] challenge to all other message believers
[1:56:35] what if you hear over new zealand such
[1:56:37] and such happen with this pastor or what
[1:56:39] if you hear
[1:56:40] up in russia such and such happened with
[1:56:42] this church or what if you're here
[1:56:44] i don't care what you hear believe for
[1:56:46] the best
[1:56:48] believe they're a child of god believe
[1:56:49] everything's fine believe they're fine
[1:56:51] between god because how in the world are
[1:56:52] you ever going to know anyhow
[1:56:54] they're in russia they're in new zealand
[1:56:56] they're in south africa they're
[1:56:57] who knows where they're at don't ever
[1:57:00] believe
[1:57:00] evil about a brother or sister believe
[1:57:02] the best
[1:57:03] and if you need to know something god
[1:57:05] will make sure you thoroughly know it
[1:57:07] and when you thoroughly know it
[1:57:08] then you know what to do next but if you
[1:57:10] don't know and there's no way for you to
[1:57:12] know
[1:57:12] do not pass judgment
[1:57:16] just say god bless my brother i've heard
[1:57:19] he's in trouble
[1:57:20] i've heard there's a problem in the
[1:57:22] church i've heard that there's an
[1:57:23] investigation
[1:57:24] i heard that there's this and i heard
[1:57:25] there's that god will you help my
[1:57:27] brother
[1:57:27] will you bless them will you bring them
[1:57:29] through this
[1:57:31] if they're wrong will you show them so
[1:57:32] they can be corrected if it's just evil
[1:57:34] against them will you shield them from
[1:57:35] all evil were you bringing themselves
[1:57:37] greater than they went in
[1:57:39] will you bless them abundantly will you
[1:57:41] give back to them double
[1:57:42] all that they had can we pray that kind
[1:57:44] of prayer
[1:57:45] i think that's what god wants in this
[1:57:47] hour he wants his bride to come together
[1:57:50] and not to be divided and not to be so
[1:57:52] envious and
[1:57:53] jealous and poking at one another and
[1:57:56] believing evil about one another
[1:57:57] we should believe only good about one
[1:57:59] another
[1:58:01] [Music]
[1:58:02] amen god be praised
[1:58:06] let reasoning die god's proving his
[1:58:10] bride
[1:58:11] and he'll use negative news to prove his
[1:58:14] bride
[1:58:16] he'll he'll put you in the place of one
[1:58:18] of job's friends just to see what you'll
[1:58:19] do
[1:58:20] he'll put you in the place of job to see
[1:58:22] what you'll do
[1:58:24] you can be in either place you can be in
[1:58:26] the trial or you can be the friend
[1:58:31] and god's watching what we'll do whether
[1:58:33] you're in the trial
[1:58:34] or whether you're the friend god's
[1:58:36] watching what we're going to do
[1:58:37] and god cares about what we say
[1:58:40] he cares about how we react it's
[1:58:44] not it's not the problem that's the
[1:58:46] problem it's the reaction to the problem
[1:58:48] that's the problem
[1:58:50] god will let the problem to check the
[1:58:52] reaction to the problem
[1:58:54] i say god give me your character
[1:58:57] and let me die to everything else
[1:59:00] the tests are going to get harder
[1:59:05] the news is going to get worse
[1:59:08] and social media is not the place to
[1:59:10] find out the true story
[1:59:15] social media is not the place to get the
[1:59:16] scoop
[1:59:20] but you just believe the best it all
[1:59:23] sounds bad
[1:59:24] how do you really know well so-and-so
[1:59:26] said so-and-so said they heard from so
[1:59:28] and so
[1:59:28] that's not good information that's not
[1:59:31] even biblical
[1:59:34] we're not supposed to judge a matter of
[1:59:36] what we get off facebook or instagram
[1:59:39] or whatsapp that's not how we judge a
[1:59:41] matter that's not scriptural for
[1:59:43] righteous judgment you can't judge it
[1:59:46] from afar
[1:59:48] you can't judge it from a text you can't
[1:59:51] judge it from a post
[1:59:52] i say if i do anything let me say god i
[1:59:55] want you to bless my brother
[1:59:56] they're in some sort of trouble would
[1:59:58] you help my brother and call them a
[2:00:00] brother
[2:00:02] call them a sister when you go to the
[2:00:03] throne of god because you've got no
[2:00:05] reason to believe they're not
[2:00:08] all of this nonsense of trying to decide
[2:00:10] who's bright and who's not bright forget
[2:00:12] it all
[2:00:12] call him brother call him sister brother
[2:00:14] branham could look down at the worst of
[2:00:16] the worst of denominational rooted in
[2:00:18] their denomination
[2:00:19] refusing to leave and he say brother so
[2:00:21] and so
[2:00:23] how can we not call somebody else in the
[2:00:25] message brother and sister
[2:00:27] when brother branham will call a
[2:00:28] catholic man brother
[2:00:33] i think god needs to give us all a good
[2:00:35] spanking
[2:00:37] and put us back on the right track so we
[2:00:40] can have the right kind of love
[2:00:41] for our brothers and sisters the right
[2:00:43] kind of attitude towards every situation
[2:00:46] that we can be found fighting for the
[2:00:48] right and never found fighting against
[2:00:50] god
[2:00:50] please god i don't ever want to fight
[2:00:52] against god
[2:00:54] i always want to be on the side of right
[2:00:55] and the only thing i know to do is
[2:00:57] believe the best
[2:00:59] pray for my brother and pray that god
[2:01:01] for my brother says that god will work
[2:01:03] it all out and god will bless him
[2:01:04] abundantly after it's all over
[2:01:07] and he'll take care of the rest why do
[2:01:10] you think trials come
[2:01:11] to prove us why do you think something
[2:01:14] comes
[2:01:15] what happens if something bad happens to
[2:01:17] a brother or sister sitting right next
[2:01:18] to you
[2:01:19] it's to prove you too it's to prove them
[2:01:22] but it's also to prove you
[2:01:24] what if you hear something about a
[2:01:26] brother i can't believe that
[2:01:29] i've been to church with him for 20
[2:01:30] years i can't believe that's true
[2:01:33] it's not just to test him it's to test
[2:01:36] you too
[2:01:37] to see what you'll do i say god let me
[2:01:41] be a physician with value and help me
[2:01:44] never to be a forger of lies
[2:01:47] and if i can't do anything else let me
[2:01:50] keep quiet and shut my mouth for then it
[2:01:52] would be accounted to me for wisdom
[2:01:54] and not open my mouth and prove what a
[2:01:56] fool i really am
[2:01:58] but to shut my mouth at least somebody
[2:02:00] will think i'm wise
[2:02:02] even if i'm not that's what the proverb
[2:02:05] says
[2:02:06] god bless you saints god's teaching us
[2:02:09] how to endure trials
[2:02:11] by what by trials and are they getting
[2:02:14] easier
[2:02:16] who would say that your trials are
[2:02:17] easier now than they were a couple years
[2:02:19] ago
[2:02:20] nope i don't have any takers on that
[2:02:23] they're getting harder why because he's
[2:02:26] bringing his bride into perfection
[2:02:29] have we failed absolutely have we done
[2:02:32] like job yep
[2:02:33] have we done like job's friends yep are
[2:02:35] we guilty
[2:02:36] every one of us i've seen god i've heard
[2:02:39] him speak
[2:02:40] and i'm a based and ashamed of myself
[2:02:42] and i bore myself
[2:02:45] that's a good place to be friends that's
[2:02:47] not bad
[2:02:49] can god work with that yes he can he
[2:02:51] blessed job because of it
[2:02:53] and job got back double
[2:02:56] i say we're learning how to be like
[2:02:58] christ this bride is learning to have
[2:03:00] the character of christ on display
[2:03:03] in every trial and they're not going to
[2:03:06] get
[2:03:06] easier they're going to get harder
[2:03:10] why because he chose this evil age
[2:03:13] to call a bride for his name because he
[2:03:16] wants to prove to satan she's not like
[2:03:18] eve
[2:03:19] she won't fall back on reasoning her own
[2:03:21] ideas
[2:03:22] her own thinking her own judgment but
[2:03:25] she will stand on this word
[2:03:27] in the word only god bless you friends
[2:03:30] let's stand
[2:03:31] musicians if you'd come i want to read
[2:03:34] one scripture while we're standing
[2:03:37] i just had you stand so you pay
[2:03:39] attention to me for a few more minutes
[2:03:42] i want to read romans
[2:03:45] chapter 8.
[2:03:48] romans 8 and 31
[2:03:55] what shall we then say to these things
[2:03:57] if god before us
[2:03:58] who can be against us he that spared not
[2:04:01] his own son but delivered him up for us
[2:04:03] all how shall he not with him also
[2:04:05] freely give us all things
[2:04:06] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[2:04:09] god's elect
[2:04:11] help me god not to ever ever do that
[2:04:14] because the blood of jesus christ has
[2:04:15] freed them
[2:04:16] and the foreknowledge of god has chosen
[2:04:18] them help me
[2:04:19] never to lay a charge to god's elect
[2:04:22] because if i do that
[2:04:24] i'm on the same side satan's on because
[2:04:26] he's an accuser of the brother
[2:04:28] and help me god never to be an accuser
[2:04:31] of the brethren
[2:04:33] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[2:04:35] god's elect it is
[2:04:36] god that justifieth who is he that
[2:04:39] condemneth it is christ that died ye
[2:04:41] rather that has risen again
[2:04:42] who is even at the right hand of god who
[2:04:44] also make intercession for us
[2:04:46] who shall separate us from the love of
[2:04:48] christ shall tribulation or distress or
[2:04:50] persecution or famine
[2:04:52] or nakedness or peril or sword as is
[2:04:55] written for thy sake we are killed all
[2:04:57] the day long
[2:04:57] we are counted as sheep for the
[2:04:59] slaughter nay in all these things we are
[2:05:01] more than conquerors through him that
[2:05:04] loved us
[2:05:05] for i am persuaded that neither death
[2:05:07] nor life
[2:05:08] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[2:05:11] nor things present nor things to come
[2:05:14] nor
[2:05:14] height nor depth nor any other creature
[2:05:17] shall be able to separate us from the
[2:05:18] love of god which is in
[2:05:20] christ jesus our lord
[2:05:24] so we're in a hard trial
[2:05:27] so what can it separate us from the love
[2:05:30] of god
[2:05:31] has it changed anything in the mind of
[2:05:33] god has it changed the word one iota
[2:05:36] has it changed god's plan no we're in a
[2:05:39] hard trial
[2:05:39] has anything changed nothing has changed
[2:05:43] if anything we've just he's revealing
[2:05:46] himself to us and we're learning more
[2:05:47] and more
[2:05:49] we're growing and increasing in our
[2:05:51] understanding of him
[2:05:53] brother ben says in the smyrna church
[2:05:55] age out of the church age book
[2:05:57] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[2:05:59] no signs of god's disapproval
[2:06:02] neither are bright skies and still water
[2:06:04] signs of his love and approval
[2:06:05] his approval of any of us is only in the
[2:06:08] beloved
[2:06:09] his love is elective which he had for us
[2:06:11] before the foundation of the world
[2:06:13] does he love us oh yes but how shall we
[2:06:16] know
[2:06:16] we shall know because he said so and
[2:06:19] manifested that he did love us for he
[2:06:21] brought us to himself and gave us of his
[2:06:23] spirit
[2:06:24] placing us as sons and how shall i prove
[2:06:26] my love to him
[2:06:28] by believing what he said and by
[2:06:30] conducting myself with joy
[2:06:31] amidst the trials that he and his wisdom
[2:06:34] allows to come to pass
[2:06:38] i love god that doesn't prove nothing
[2:06:44] you can shout it on the housetop you can
[2:06:46] tell your neighbor
[2:06:47] i love god that doesn't prove nothing
[2:06:49] but how do i
[2:06:50] prove my love to him by conducting
[2:06:53] myself
[2:06:54] with joy amidst the trial that he and
[2:06:58] his wisdom allows to come my way
[2:07:01] that's how i prove my love to him not by
[2:07:03] saying it
[2:07:04] not by shouting it not by writing it in
[2:07:06] a paper that doesn't prove nothing the
[2:07:08] proving of my love to him
[2:07:10] is conducting myself with joy amidst the
[2:07:12] trial that he
[2:07:13] has allowed to come my way i pray
[2:07:16] i tell you it's easier to tell a
[2:07:17] co-worker than to conduct ourselves with
[2:07:20] joy in the trial
[2:07:22] it's easier to shout out from a
[2:07:23] houndstop it's easier to spray paint it
[2:07:25] on a bridge
[2:07:27] it's easier to put it on a bumper
[2:07:28] sticker than it is to conduct ourselves
[2:07:30] with joy in the midst of the trial
[2:07:32] that he and his wisdom allowed to come
[2:07:34] our way i said god
[2:07:37] i desire in my heart to prove my love to
[2:07:39] you
[2:07:40] help me lord help me to put my hand over
[2:07:43] my mouth
[2:07:44] unless i can say i love you unless i can
[2:07:46] say
[2:07:47] thank you first thessalonians 5 18 says
[2:07:51] in everything
[2:07:53] give thanks in everything give thanks
[2:07:57] for this is the will of god in christ
[2:07:59] jesus
[2:08:00] concerning you unless i can say in the
[2:08:03] middle of a trial
[2:08:04] thank you jesus i'd like to keep my hand
[2:08:07] over my
[2:08:08] mouth and when my brother's in a trial
[2:08:11] unless i can be a physician of value and
[2:08:13] say i love you brother i'm praying for
[2:08:14] you
[2:08:15] i want to keep my hand over my mouth
[2:08:17] keep quiet so that i can appear wise
[2:08:21] i don't want to know the word
[2:08:25] i want to be the word i don't want to
[2:08:29] know about god
[2:08:30] i want to be the manifestation of god
[2:08:34] i don't want to know the word i want the
[2:08:36] word living in me

[2:08:44] living word

[2:08:48] doing everything
[2:08:48] opposite to what he told us to do in his
[2:08:50] word and the way i conduct myself in a
[2:08:52] trial and the way i treat a brother in a
[2:08:54] trial
